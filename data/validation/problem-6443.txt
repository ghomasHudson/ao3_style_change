“I love you so much, kiddo,” Tony says, pressing a soft kiss to Peter’s cheek and smoothing a hand over his hair, almost wishing he could stall time. He carefully sets Peter down and draws his blanket over him, watching the rise and fall of his chest. Before he leaves, he clicks on the lamp that’s shade with cut-out shapes throws crescent moons and stars on the muraled walls.
It’s an hour flight from New York to DC. Tony can cut that time. He’s done it once or twice before by a few minutes, and that was in older versions of the suit. Rogers just has to keep himself breathing until Tony can reach him, and that thought is a
“I’m almost positive you’re lying about the x-ray vision. C’mon, Spangles. No cake, no strippers, no fireworks?” Tony bellyaches, closing the map on his phone with directions to the nearest chain store. At least, he’d been willing to search for legal TNT. “No fun. What kind of birthday is this? It’s downright un-American.”
“You ran away,” Tony states at the threshold of Steve’s room, balancing his two bowls of soup on a tray. “Literally, you don’t run away from anything, and you just booked it. Seriously, a cartoon cloud of smoke was left in your wake. There’d be a Steve-shaped hole in the door if the kitchen actually had a door. You need to unburden me of this hazard. I’m swooning, and that’s like the second time in twenty minutes, fyi.”
To quiet it, Tony snatches a glass of champagne from a passing member of the waitstaff. Sipping dutifully and manufacturing his expression into one of engagement, he rejoins the group of surgeons that has doubled in size since he left.
“Ugh, don’t continue,” Tony replies with a wave of his hand, only half-joking because he remembers typing that  embarrassing monster out, unable to shut up about Sylvia, symbolism, and self. It’s one thing to get written feedback but the prospect of talking about it twists his insides.
“Fabulous timing, babe.” Tony waves him in and there’s a glint to his grin that has nothing good in store for Steve. “Please come over here and agree with me.”
“Yes, I got that connection. I take it back. You’re very imaginative when you want to be,” Steve says with a slight laugh that sounds as clogged as Tony feels but his eyes are crinkled at the corners and his smile is happy if a bit confused. “Why didn’t you give this to me last night?”
“I was terrified that one day you’d be blindsided with it and find out from someone who doesn’t love you. Who wouldn’t be kind or take care with how they told you. I didn’t think you deserved that,” Steve tells him. “Or you could have discovered it on your own and the thought of you being alone and reading that in black and white. That scared me. You deserve better than that. I was afraid of you finding out and hurting and me not being there to fix it. Not being there to take care of you. I’m still terrified of that. The thought of you in pain—”
Steve pauses considerably with a pinched mouth, like he’s readying himself, like maybe he doesn’t want Tony’s help and he’s piecing together a way to put it politely. “Tony, listen. There’s something that—”
“Nope,” Tony says with a soft pop and then he collects a slow and full kiss that Steve is only too happy to give, muggy as it may be. “Just trying to remember the moral of a story about a turtle and a rabbit, you know?”
“Ugh, you don’t even know if you’re going to like the first movie,” Tony says, adopting a put-upon tone. He falls into the couch, flings aside a pillow that digs into his kidney and rustles out the candy from under his ass. “You do this every time. You and your second chances. Alright, JARVIS, you heard the man. Queue up the first two
“It’s hell. Almost every day is terrible and you’re essentially just surviving second to second.” Tony pauses thoughtfully. Clearing his throat, he combs through Steve’s damp bangs and continues, “It’s like drowning, you know. Trying to live underwater. It’s hard to breathe and everything is fighting against you. Every direction you look seems endless, not much solid ground to walk on.”
Along with one in the morning, Tony spies Peter in the rearview mirror, bopping with his legs swinging to the radio. And Tony is waning, a middle-aged father who’s up against it and judging his younger self for ever taking sleep for granted, so he takes a few left turns and pulls into a late night drive-thru, ordering a coffee over Peter's enthusiastic hellos to the voice coming out of the speaker box. Sympathy beats out awe and shock on the face of the purple-haired twenty-something manning the window when they roll up, and that’s just perfect.
Tony grabs Steve by the hips and presses a hard kiss to his lips, once and again. And then it slows, shifting into something more intimate and involved, like they can’t kiss each other enough. It leaves them both breathless by the end, tucked into each other. Tony clutches Steve’s sides and sighs deep again, like he’s trying to shake something loose.
. Grabbing the hem of Steve’s sweater, he has it in mind to reward himself, has it halfway up when Steve stops him with a gentle hand.
“Sorry, sorry,” Tony murmurs absently, laughing with an amused Steve before cajoling hot kisses from him. He recedes down under Steve’s jaw and sweeps his throat with a procession of near-kisses, brushing and licking over his nipples. Tugging at them with his teeth, Tony is rewarded with Steve’s bright and hooked cry.
It feels like making up for wasted time and fate course-correcting them to a path they should have been on from the very beginning.
“Eh, we can put that on the shelf for now. Think you do that well enough on your own. Too well. I’m saying he deserves some happiness and, from what it sounds like, so do you.” He lurches up. “Now, it’s gonna be a while before he’s back here which I’m sure you’re aware of. You feeling Mario Kart?”
“I’m excellent. Kuwait is sweltering. Sand is dry and water is wet, Tony. What are you doing calling me at, let’s see, it’s fourteen-hundred hours here and that’s seven in the morning your time. And you’re too well-dressed to be going to bed,” Rhodey notes after a brief appraisal. “What’s wrong?”
“When we fought together in the Battle of New York, there was a moment. It wasn’t sepia-toned or saccharine, not that kind of thing. We were fighting for our lives, and we pulled off this, god, video game move with my repulsors on his shield,” Tony starts, recalls, he can almost taste the buzz still. He continues, “No rehearsal, no practice, or even really having to try. I knew what to do, and he knew what to do, and it fell into place with ease. Everything with him is that effortless. It’s been there from the get. It’s not about Pepper, but if you’re asking where she comes in, it’s right there.”
Steve’s breath catches and his nerves start leaping like lizards. He can feel sweat at the base of his spine; anxiety takes possession of his fingers because suddenly things are moving awfully fast but Tony quickly steals them back. He turns Steve’s trembling hands palm up and places one kiss each to their love lines. Steve would hardly know better but he’s sure that the gesture isn’t commonplace in the narrative of a one night stand. It’s unspeakably sweet, and Steve finds himself caring less and less about what brought Tony here. It’s just. Well.
In response, so well-versed in Tony, Steve pulls off. He grips Tony’s cock, working tight, fast, and relentless--hitches spilling out of Tony. With a spark in his eye and smirk that’s nothing but wolf-wicked, Steve reaches behind Tony’s balls with his hand that isn't preoccupied, teasing his hole before crooking just in with a blunt finger.
His trip to the market is far less complicated because, thankfully, chicken soup is still chicken soup.
Surrounded by his motley cast of teammates, the place feels full. Nursing a cold beer and pressed against Steve’s warm side, Tony really couldn’t ask for more. That is, until Thor rests his hammer in the middle of the coffee table and Tony can’t deny that he’s always wanted a chance at that.
Sam goes on to craft a tale encompassing Rogers’ commitment to saving his brainwashed best friend who he thought was dead. He fills in the holes where Rogers and Romanoff were on the run and reveals that Fury isn’t actually dead. And it’s not to say that Tony isn’t shocked. Of course he
“It wasn’t your fault. It wasn’t,” Steve says, lips not leaving Tony’s own, salted and sure. “There’s nothing to forgive.”
It’s late, five cups of coffee shared between Tony and Sam, when the surgeon returns and updates them on Steve’s condition. They were able to stop the bleeding and he made it through surgery successfully, but due to the heavy sedation they had to administer in the operating room, Rogers won’t wake up until morning, at the earliest. With a worn smile, she suggests that they rest while Rogers does.
“I want to go home,” Steve says irritably, and it sounds like a tantrum to his own ears, like he needs to be coddled. And this is one of those moments where he second-guesses how the future has reshaped his mold because he feels downright spoiled at times. He wonders what his mother would think. He misses the summers spent with her, the two of them fanning themselves and counting up loose change to split a shaved ice. When its too-sweet syrup would eventually mix with the sweat on their fingertips, she’d let him pull her into the street with him and rinse it off under the spray of an opened fire hydrant, the two of them careless. That he misses enough to be heartsick over, but the thick, stifling air that nearly filtered the neighborhood in a bronze haze if he squeezed his eyes just right? Somewhat shamefully, not so much.
Warm like a furnace, Tony laughs and wraps his arms around Steve’s middle, hands under his armpits; he tucks a number of kisses between Steve’s neck and ear. “I need lube. Do you keep oil around or something like that?”
“I don’t—I wanted to come to you with something halfway eloquent. I’ve been thinking about taking him in, Steve.”
After a stretch of silence, Rhodey’s voice is non-judgemental and calming, and Tony takes it back; he needed to make this call.
“Or when you’re giving out your home address to terrorists,” Natasha supplies and the retort is oddly comforting. “Tony, if we could have been there—”
“Are you kidding? I’m terrified,” Steve admits, trembling all the way through, everywhere. He can’t keep still at all. The happiness is so fragile and new. He skims his palms against whatever he can reach, past the limits he’d set before.
He’d keep it alongside the sight of Steve straddling Tony, guiding Tony’s cock into him and sinking down with a slack mouth until he’s flush on Tony’s hips. Into the echelons, Tony would etch the peace on Steve’s brow when he starts rolling into slow thrusts like there’s nowhere else he’d rather be. He would permanently catalogue the ratcheting hitches in Steve’s exhales when Tony starts driving up into him, how Steve falls forward into Tony’s embrace after a particularly sharp thrust, reaching for Tony’s hand and twining their fingers.
Tony’s quiet in the car on the drive back to Manhattan, and that gets Steve’s attention and concern. Tony lies badly and can’t even function under the pretense that he gets away with it because when he tells Steve that he’d forgotten about a teleconference with SI’s board of directors—like he would even care—Steve’s looks at Tony with a resultant expression of confusion and hurt. It’s there and gone in a flash but it sticks with Tony like dirt under his fingernails. It doesn’t leave him when they return to the tower and part ways with the uneasy promise to meet for dinner, Steve to his floor and Tony into the safe haven of mechanical guts, wiring, and code.
“Yeah," Tony murmurs, rueful and fond. "Imagine if we’d waited a few months to get hitched, he could be the drunk one instead of you." He smirks, gently knocking Steve on the shoulder.
Sheepish and still pink across the cheekbones, Steve laughs. It’s louder and self-deprecating and familiar; it breaks the moment. “You don’t have to hold my hand, Tony.”
Peter plucks at the hem of his shirt, smiling faintly. “Okay. Um, thanks, Mr. Stark. Tony. I really—thanks. I’ll see you guys later.”
“Er. I--I don’t know,” Peter stammers, quickly closing the chat. He rubs at his neck and backs away. “No idea.”
Steve exhales and his face crumples with the effort, creases into vulnerable lines. It’s somehow worse than the sight of him being shot, his stillness on the silt edge of the river, and his muted and gauzy breaths after surgery. Hands in his lap, Steve’s impossibly small and silent for a long minute before speaking.
Steve is always glancing at the motor oil on Tony’s face with a clenched jaw, but, one morning, told social proprietary to fuck off, taking his nasty, sweat-soaked shirt and proceeding to clean Tony’s face with the hem of it.
Maneuvering into position is entirely slapstick. Hilariously, they fling their shirts to the backseat, and shimmy out of their jeans and underwear like they’ve caught on fire, and toss those behind their heads as well. Steve has to bodily haul Tony over the slushbox, the knobs of knees have near run-ins with parts of the anatomy that they definitely should not ever come into contact with, and when Tony overzealously handles the lever on the side of the seat, the two of them flatten in a breath-stealing swoosh.
Steve steps close, and Tony’s missed him. Like his entire being. He’s missed the composite they make. He tells him exactly that, filter laid at the wayside.
Tony learns that while Steve never punched Hitler, that’s pretty much where the propaganda ends because the man lives up to the legend. He knew this before, peripherally, but the picture gains shades and definition. Tony will catch Steve murmuring under his breath with the New York Times app opened on his tablet. He’s seen Steve leave a lengthy and aggrieved response to a bombing in Afghanistan in the comments section and share an article on the rise of homelessness in their backyard to his Twitter. Tony’s watched him pen a letter to a pair of orphans who lost their parents to a house fire in Oregon and send it off with a hand-drawn cartoon of the Avengers.
Steve’s expression turns thoughtful and bright. “That’d be awfully convenient. We can go with that if anyone asked.”
“They’re fading,” Steve says muffled by Tony’s skin and sounding north of regretful. “Your freckles. Going away with summer it looks like.”
“Then I think we’ll be alright,” Steve says. He shivers at the idea of it, the promise, and the fact that he finally has this. It’s terrifying, and it’ll be complicated with the life they lead. However, they’ve got each other. They’ve bled for this. There have been sacrifices. Steve believes. “We’ll make it alright.”
“Shut up. That was unbelievably horrible,” Steve says, even though he does let out a soft and rough laugh. It’s not at the pitiful joke because it was truly awful; the thrill stems from elsewhere. A love—that still resides on the tip of Steve’s tongue, imploring to be spoken but feels too early, what they’ve started only three months young—for this amazing, godsend of a man, and the sweet freedom he brings with him. Steve’s hands stroke Tony’s dear face, close at his jaw. He kisses him, hoping that Tony reads the gratitude thick in his mouth, the love threatening to burst Steve at his seams. With his heart playing hopscotch, Steve asks, “Can we do that again?”
Steve doesn’t come—doesn’t get to follow Tony that far—and hates himself for even hoping, for trying to seek forgiveness so cheaply.
Steve flips it around and back. “I don't know. There's no postage stamp as far as I can see. You’re more imaginative than that.”
“We’ll keep at it,” Tony says. He scrubs the heels of his hands into his eyes because they’ve been at this for a stretch of days that feels like forever, and whatever’s going down in Washington isn’t kosher, and dear
Steve tries desperately not to fidget, tries to remember that Tony would never hurt him, and tells himself to stop being ridiculous. He attempts to check his psychosomatic chill, but his fingers shake all the same until—suddenly at Steve’s side and a mirror of earlier—Tony’s quell them.
Tony doesn’t do Steve the insult of asking if he’s sure. He softly kisses Steve, and when Steve’s got his knees spread, Tony’s back with slick and stretches him open with a finger that maddeningly turns into three.
“This is your world, birthday boy. I’m only living in it,” Tony says, extends a hand. “Lead the way.”
"You’ve got a conference call with your department heads in about an hour, right?” It’s more of a statement than it is a question and it’s in a tone that Tony is practically wired to respond to.
“You got no idea, Tony. Love you, love you. Can’t get enough of you. Perfect. You’re the best,” Steve says, a fog of humid heat over Tony’s lips, shuddering in both breath and hips. Tony pitches up and clenches down on Steve’s cock, is rewarded with Steve’s surprised grunt and a hard snap that would have Tony skidding to the headboard and beyond if not for Steve ordering him not to let go in a jagged exhale. The secure band Steve's arm makes around his waist holds Tony in place while Steve’s thrusts grow devastatingly forceful, angles sharp and perfect. The room begins to favor the more brazen and obscene sounds of their fevered fucking, the slap of sweat and skin drowning out their low guttural noises.
, before the freshman, who’s only taking an engineering class to impress the girl he has a crush on by the way, is propping his hip against their table. Which yeah fine, Tony can kind of relate to wanting to impress the person you lo—like but still, the more Lang barrages him with questions, the longer Tony goes without knowing what Steve was about to ask and god, Tony really needs to know what Steve was about to ask.
she asks, and it’s steeped in concern; it’s perceptive and gentle—well-read in the language of Steve Rogers.
JARVIS had notified Steve of Tony’s distress and neither of them had slept that night, going through the videos on the server and footage—Peter catching cars, stopping bank robberies and muggings, and interceding multiple
“Thank you,” Rogers says. With a slight chuckle that rumbles into an amused laugh—and maybe some of the painkillers are still lingering, it’s so unrestrained—he says again, “Thank you.”
“That is the distinct cadence of teenage disownment. What’s this, your second infraction in two weeks?” Cap observes from his position on the couch, hunched over and sorting through mission reports that are more than likely past due. Peter spies leaflets of sudoku.
Placing kisses that swirl all over Steve’s cock and nuzzling Steve’s sac, Tony asks, “Is it alright if I touch you here?”
“Can’t help wanting to protect the people you care about, Cap,” Tony responds wryly, shrugging. “Not that hard to understand. Especially when you get lucky enough to even have people in your life to give a shit about. What makes things—people,
“If so, I have definitely have the world record on the longest concussion, by far. Probably pretty dangerous. What do I have to say to convince you, huh?” Steve’s forehead falls to Tony’s softly with a sigh. He nuzzles with his nose, impossibly close and devastating; his eyes are thoughtful and yank Tony to a tenuous edge of something more. “Or is it something that I can’t
In the gym of the compound, Steve gives a right hook to the kevlar punching bag, and it swings bodily into Tony, who catches it and staggers.
“Okay. Here’s another tip and then I’m gonna start charging. The first rule, and most important by the way, is to try not making a noose out of the tie. Jesus, you could put a tomato of out business right now,” Tony says, loosening the knot and re-doing it like a dance that he’ll never forget the steps for. Letting go is harder than it should be. “There. That’s better. You’re perfect. You're also the most earnest person I know. Stick with that and you can't lose.”
Steve is terrified that's it too much and more than fate meant to deal out to him but he wants this, with Tony and with Peter. He’d fight the world for them. He’s a soldier who’s prepared to fight the world for them.
Tony doesn’t mind being outfoxed in a sparring session when it ends with him on his back, Steve solid, broad, and rutting on top of him. It’s nice to pivot his hips under the welcomed weight, to feel them fit together perfectly before they trade handjobs, their fists furious and elastic waistbands cut across their thighs. It’s a literal thrill ride to be lifted from his office desk and fucked practically boneless against the wall, Steve’s strength infallible and unfaltering.
“Yeah,” Steve says, and Tony heaves off him to fish around in the drawer. It leaves Steve cold in a myriad of ways that he doesn’t want to look too hard at. Hearing the lid pop off his small pot of vaseline, he turns this head, cheek resting on the fold of his arms to admire Tony. Steve wants to memorize how the lines of him move as he greases his purpled cock that curves slightly to the left. “That gonna work okay? I use it to oil my baseball mitt.”
Tony inches in, looping Steve’s arms around his neck. His lips graze Steve’s ear and the brush of his peculiar beard causes him to shiver. Confidently, Tony whispers, “You’ll be amazing.”
Two nights in a row, Steve dreams of being thirteen again and plunged deep into a bout of pneumonia. His heart jack-knifes in his chest because at his bedside, he hears the fervent prayers of Father Doyle and Ma’s terrible hitching sobs, variations of a goodbye.
“What? Um, no. This car is your responsibility, young man. What I did was just common and complementary practice. Like fucking you in cars isn’t even spontaneous anymore--admittedly, I need to step up my game. I have a thing of lube in all of my glove compartments. And, yes, that did sound just as dirty as I intended. Ugh,
The water in the cup rocks over the brim and Steve grabs at it before it can soak the bed. He sets it aside, checks over the IV and the beeps of the monitoring devices. He takes Tony’s unsteady and too-thin hand. He’s pleased that Tony doesn’t wrench it away, that he gets to keep holding on. He fixes his eyes to Tony’s and it’s difficult to stay resolute under the shade of his hurt, the weight of betrayal there. “I have to do this. You know that.”
“It’d be nice for us both, having someone around. By no means do we have to be attached at the hip. Or besties tied by the testes.”
So Tony puts the condoms back and just makes with the lube. On his haunches between Steve’s legs, Tony dribbles it over his fingers until they’re slick. Once satisfied, he carefully presses one digit inside Steve who groans in return, his hand clamping down on Tony’s forearm when the finger goes crooked.
Tony holds his eyes straight-on and his words bear the weight of experience. “My interest is that half of the world is on fire and time isn’t something I have much of anymore. My interest is that I’ve wanted you since the moment I first saw you, second chances don’t come around often, and I won’t forgive myself if I don’t do something about it.” He finishes carefully, like it’s vital that Steve understand. “I mean, we don’t have to do anything you don’t want to. That should be clear. I only want what you’re willing to give. Christ, I’d be thrilled just sitting here with you. Honest.”
Steve doesn’t entirely buy Tony’s fish story: that he’s got a Cousin Vinny on the frontlines who used to work with Bucky at the Navy Yard a few years back and that all three of them had a night out drinking hot buttered rum the winter Steve was conveniently laid up with bronchitis. Steve doesn’t buy that Tony had his wallet picked because Steve caught the glint of a nice, heavy watch in Tony’s jacket pocket when he slid into the booth across from him. Tony had even almost palmed it before seemingly remembering himself and checking the clock above the bar instead.
Yes, Steve hails from departed days but Tony knows that adolescent life wasn’t that different in the forties. He knows Steve is aware teenagers don’t clamor to hang out with their parents on a Saturday night, knows he’s asking for Tony. Privately, he squeezes Steve’s knee, thanking him.
“A nice one I hope,” Steve says, all faux innocence. Jacking Tony in a wet slide, his lips skim the skin of Tony’s hipbone. It’s tender and turns obscenely so when Steve buries his nose in the juncture of groin and thigh, inhaling and groaning like he loves it.
It’s a ludicrous question because Tony hasn’t been breathing evenly for some time now and there's no way that Steve's ears haven't picked up on that. He turns around, means to try for anything but sounding like an idiot but Steve steals every word from him. He’s looking at Tony like there’s nothing in the world for him but Tony. Eternal seconds click away as Tony soaks the expression in, involuntarily fishmouthing.
His side hitched on the passenger side door, Tony explains the seats that are the color of a coffee with two creams, and Steve would bet are as soft as butter. “Here we have a subtle homage to that delicious jacket you don’t wear nearly enough.”
The city streaks around them in traffic light gradients, neon signs glowing through the windshield. And Tony has passed the tower for the third time when he checks the digital clock on the center console and winces. “Pete, you are kicking my as--cot.” Sighing in defeat, he confirms, “Yep, you’re kicking my ascot.”
“You know an astute individual may have guessed that you’re the last thing I want to see when I wake up.”
Tony opens his legs to accommodate him, happily welcomes the settling of sleep-warm skin against skin. He braces on his elbows, dampens his lips and reaches out to touch Steve’s chin for no reason beyond the fact that he’s very attached to it, to all of him. He bends to snatch a quick kiss. “You have something in mind?”
Steve trembles in a fit, scrabbling his fingers over Tony’s shoulders, and his nails must bite because Tony grinds particularly hard with a sharp hiss and the angle shifts deeper. It feels achingly right. It always does, and Steve realizes that he wants this forever. He wants it more than he ever missed the past, he wants it more than having victory over evil, he wants it more desperately than he wished for the dead to come back to life.
“No. No.” Steve shakes his head, and all Tony can see are the bruises that haven’t faded. “If Bucky wanted to kill me, I’d be dead.”
“Yes, it’ll come back in a few minutes,” Tony replies before his sex-drenched laughter fills the room, and Steve is very into the way it lights his eyes.
With the hand that isn’t splaying heat near Steve’s sternum, Tony pulls him off. His fist isn’t loose enough for Steve to shove into; he can’t do anything but take it, the punishing strokes that work him syncing up to the ones coming from behind.
The first thing Steve notices is the steering wheel that’s covered for an unveiling. But from the passenger’s side, Tony points out the placard that sits on the dash, instead. Engraved, it reads: 1967 Camaro RS Steve Rogers, a special edition. “How about that? Jeez, you really thought of everything.”
“This is moot anyway,” Rhodey says. He tips his half-finished beer to Tony’s right. “Your boy’s got it.”
Steve would spin an array of arrows to excerpts he particularly liked, emphatic underscoring and exclamation points that would leave Tony preening.
Odds are, Steve had been referring to the city, but in a short time, he manages to make the tower resemble something like home. After a tour that ends awkwardly in the open space of Steve’s studio—
“J, I wanna revisit the tea Natasha spilled all over the internet,” Tony says. Every hardcopy he’s looked over goes nowhere and maybe a fresh pair of eyes will catch something in the file-dump. It’d be nice if Tony actually had a fresh pair of eyes, but his insomnia-cured and strained vision will have to make do. “Keywords: Stark, Maria, Howard, accident, Winter Soldier, Barnes.”
“Yes—however, not that. Or whatever your imagination conjured up outside of that. With the last few leads on Barnes turning up cold and having not come up with anything in weeks, I was thinking. Steve, we won’t stop looking. We
“Late dinner. I don’t usually come out this way but I’ve had a hankering for broccoli and cheddar soup since the cold front moved in and this is the best place in town to get it,” Steve explains. “Also it’s nice to take a much needed break and get away from grading the mountain of papers I’ve got back at home.”
“No, don’t,” Steve says louder than necessary, overconfident and maybe too steeled, but it stops Tony from leaving and that’s what matters. “I want to try. It’s unbearably hot and—”
“I’m not drinking flower water, Steve,” Tony complains, punctuating the sentence with a cough. He rubs at his chest. “Shit that hurt. I’ve got that meeting with the mayor, remember? That’s boring enough on its own. Me going without caffeine is an extraordinarily bad idea.”
It doesn’t take long for the cube to lose its shape between Tony’s workman fingers, and another takes its place, this time rounding the opposite nipple and slipping down with leisure over the shallow and quick up-down-up-down of Steve’s chest. It bisects Steve’s middle to eventually die in the humid heat of his groin.
“I told you to hide and I meant it. You won’t come back. You can’t go because if you do, you will not come back,” Tony stresses, speaking over Steve as if he said nothing and
Tony's surliness doesn't discourage Steve and he didn't expect it would. Next to him, the couch gives and there’s a scratch of pencil against paper.
“Motion denied. He’d make a great usher. He's very polite,” Steve replies with a full-blown smile and shining eyes. “Or maybe. Huh. We will need someone to park cars. And it’d be convenient to have someone for cheap.”
And through the remainder of the morning and afternoon, he gives Tony no reason to believe that he is.
“Got some sort of betting pool going on, Wilson?” Tony asks, squinting after taking off his sunglasses.
“Your husband’s pretty pissed at me for marooning you in 1942 Brooklyn but I told him I work better without having death glares shot my way and sent him to get a snack.”
“No one here is innocent of that.” Steve takes a deep breath and his time. “I want to get this right, too. We can’t turn back time, not really but we’ve got a pretty long history of what not to do. Maybe that’s just as good.”
this entire time then? You know your father has Feelings™ about online piracy. It unsettles his scruples.”
“True enough but studies show that ten out of ten would prefer their French roast not tasting like, what was it last time, smokey topaz? Who can blame me?”
might be a first,” Tony replies. His attempt at a leer, that comes out nearly cross-eyed, gets Steve to remember himself and jerk his hand away. “Thanks, Dr. Rogers, but I just need some morning joe and I’m good to go.”
“Tony, you can’t,” Steve impresses, sounding strangled and tight. Tony peers up to see Steve’s nails are biting into Tony’s sheets, churning them with white-knuckled clutches.
“I didn’t mean—” Rogers starts, dry and then he swallows. Tony gets up to pour him a cup of water. Rogers takes it with a smile, anemic but better than the alternative. Tony sits and watches Rogers take a few long pulls from the cup. He hands it back to Tony after he’s done, gives his thanks, and Tony sets it on the bedside table.
“What? What are you doing?” Steve asks in wonder, barely. Tony responds with another swipe, spreading Steve even wider and licking a delicate swirl bookended by God’s name and a curse.
wastes no seeping into his bones. Tony laughs again, this time without humor because this is what he deserves for suffering an apparent lapse into insanity and giving credence to anything freaking Scott Lang has to say. For letting his want and hope pen a fiction that almost passed as believable inside his head. “Of course this is for your class. And you needed my help so…”
The email arrives three days into fall break and the new alert Tony setup, a fitting chorus by Van Halen, comes through the speakers of his workshop.
“Only if it matches what you want. That's what matters most of all, Peter. What's best for you. He won’t do this if it makes you uncomfortable. He’ll do whatever you want. What do you want?”
“And while he’s out running around the city, literally, with his best friend, I decided that I’d take the time to call mine since I’m nothing if not an opportunist. So I need you to give me one of your epic lectures. Please.”
Which is nice but a no-go because Tony can’t imagine much better than Steve falling apart right the fuck now.
Steve is happy that he was at least able to give Tony something in wartime. It’s the least he could have done.
,” Steve says, moving in, slinging a leg between Tony’s and hiking it up just right. “Might cut it this weekend. Dunno.”
“I feel miserable.” That’s the God’s honest truth and then some if Tony’s willingly admitting to it. “Can’t fall asleep for the life of me,” he grumbles.
Drawing his leg up under him with his bare foot hanging over the edge of the couch, Steve nimbly unwraps a caramel melt. “This is kind of late notice, but Sam’s got the weekend free so he’s coming into the city. Thought he could stay here. That’s fine, right?”
Rhodey stares at him, distinctly unhappy with his answer. “Are you kidding? You live with him. You can’t do that to yourself.”
“Gotcha, but if it’ll help, I’m all for it,” Steve replies, and with that, he’s watching Tony move off the bed and disappear into the connected living space. Distantly, Steve can hear Tony fiddling around; the open and shut of the fridge door has been a common noise throughout the day.
“You’re the worst disciplinarian. I love it,” Tony murmurs softly from a nose away when he comes up for air. He presses a heady kiss that ebbs to chaste against Steve’s lips, soft and softer like he’s remembering something new each time. He sits back on his heels, running his hands up seemingly whatever part of Steve he can reach, upsetting the grain dusting outer thighs and skating inner thighs and hips. He grazes Steve’s stomach that momentarily caves in under the gentle attention, and then retraces back down. “Is it alright if I touch you?” Tony asks, now not budging an inch.
The only suitable reaction, the only thing that Tony can do, is lick the leftovers of his name from Steve’s lips.
“I understand that,” Steve says. He silently wonders how many times Peter has sought solace here, in the faint scent of paper and ink and the rich sprawl of the bookshelves. “You want to be alone? I can go.”
Tony looks at him intently, and he apparently finds something that has him nodding. He jerks a thumb over his shoulder toward the bathroom. “Towels first? Otherwise we’ve got a whole sheets-to-rags situation, and, don’t get me wrong, that can be hot, but it’s mostly just uncomfortable by the end of everything.”
A quiet settles between them and even if were tensionless and easy, it’s still a luxury that Steve can’t afford. The team gave him time to watch over Tony but he can’t steal much more than he already has. He’s memorized the edges of Tony--the new lines and shift of paper-skin and the rise and fall of his chest washed under the warm light--fully intent on keeping the picture until it branded the back of his eyelids. That way he could take it with him into the dark.
. “Meaning I’m actually surprised they let me book a room here and don’t have me blacklisted considering last I was here—and let’s take into account that I was like seventeen, if that—I drove an Audi straight into the swimming pool. Stuff of legend.”
“Let me hear it, Steve,” Tony urges after a long stripe. He uses his teeth to bite at the meet of Steve’s ass and thigh. “Tell me it feels good.”
There’s insomnia-made colors under his hunted eyes and his hair is coming out of place, teak fringing over his dark frames. There’s stubble outside the outline of his beard, leading to a wrinkled collar and the off-center knot of his tie that ducks into a crew neck decorated with dog hair. Tiny details that Tony wants to selfishly keep for himself. His thumb finds the half moon at the corner of Steve’s pink mouth, presses it gently and reveals a sad smile that nearly robs Tony of the air in his lungs.
Steve’s gaze idles over him and then he squints at the brightness in Tony’s eyes, the switch-blade glint of mischief. “Restraint, huh? Why do I have a feeling that it just couldn’t fit?”
“...gotta remember that as much as it’s about you being prepared, it’s also about your dad getting used to this,” Steve is in the middle of saying. “It’s asking a lot of him. Give him time, Peter, and he’ll come around.”
The sun is sinking in a gorgeous purple-pink persuasion and the lights that garland through the big backyard are just flickering on when the strings start up again.
“Any chance Steve can get an invite?” Tony asks, laughing. He turns to Steve. “Oh my gosh, I finally know what to get you for your birthday. You’d want the Millennium Falcon, right? No way you would actually construct a weapon for the evil Empire.”
“No, it was my fault. Here let me--” Tony says once he’s able to string together words. He hurriedly picks up his bag. “Total safety hazard. Don’t want to break anyone’s neck on my first day. It couldn’t get any worse than that, right?”
Peter is assisting his dad with repairs on the armor when his phone chimes. To free up a hand, the other tangled up in copper wiring, he places his screwdriver between his teeth. He swipes open a message from Ned to reveal a screenshot of a tumblr post of his dad standing on an overturned apple box, victoriously holding the Netflix logo out of Mickey Mouse’s reach. The text underneath, in spectacular hand-me-the-bleach cringe, reads:
Tony, bless him, has the grace to sound fond. “That’s sweet of you, but I have plans for that. I’ll let you know that I am very, very tempted, though; you’re so much fun.”
“Try not to keep Daddy up too late. He’s even grumpier than you if he doesn’t get a solid eight hours,” Steve smart-alecks with a wink that will always put a curl of heat in Tony’s stomach and get him to short-circuit to a certain degree.
“Sure. I’ll take good care of you, baby. Make it amazing for you,” Tony promises, his tone and the following kiss rough and sweet. With a quick, parting squeeze to Steve’s cock, Tony fluidly rolls them onto their sides and spoons close. Intimately, knees tuck behind his. “There we go. Can you keep your legs together for me? Nice and tight?”
The first assignment Tony gets back post-kiss has an A inked in scarlet at the top corner—not unusual but Tony can’t help noting the irony. Steve’s additions don’t get any more interesting past that, however. The notes that he bothered to make on the next eight pages are so customary and flat, Tony is half-surprised there isn’t a smiling kindergarten sticker emblazoned with ‘great job’ at the end.
Steve hums in agreement, watching them with a fond and tired smile, like there’s no place he’d rather be. Tony gets the feeling. With his hand stroking Peter’s dark, unruly hair, Steve murmurs, “He needs to go down soon, though. He hasn’t been up this late in months, and I don’t want his schedule thrown off. Remember how long it took to get him sleeping through the night?”
The whole thing makes Tony laugh, and it’s a sound that Steve immediately decides he likes. Passing a hand through his bangs and moving them to the side, he smiles back in kind, sheepish and what he hopes is endearing. “How’s this for a first impression?”
to call Steve when he comes across a kid in a Cap shirt or when the baseball season gets interesting but he’d actually do it. Jokingly needle Steve about the Yankees and soothe his bruised Brooklyn sensibilities with seats behind home plate at Citi Field and a Nathan’s hotdog.
“Har, har,” Tony mutters into a nudging kiss that’s slow, long, and sweet, careful of Peter between them. He drags out of it with much reluctance and kisses the pout of Steve’s bottom lip once more like he’d forgotten to cross his Ts. “Have no idea why I put up with you.”
“And leaking every classified secret of a super organization is what exactly?” Tony shakes his head. “God, I always knew that Stern was an asshat though. I think I might save the image of his arrest as the background for my phone.” Tony looks her over. “So how are you? Don’t get much opportunity to catch up when you and Rogers are running around getting shot at by ninety-six-year-old assassins with bad eyeliner.”
Utterly transfixing, Tony laps at his easy grin before diving in for a peck from Steve’s lips. “You blush so pretty for me. Christ, take a look at you,” Tony says in a vibration more so than actual words, and it shifts into an involved sort of kiss that tastes like salt-skin. It’s thorough and solid with Tony’s hands possessively playing counterpart. Radiating heat, they skid up the still quivering surface of Steve’s middle, brush the vulnerable hollow above his collarbone, and fork at his throat to turn his head just so and create a deeper angle that allows for a high tide of tongue. Steve shivers into the plying kiss and the press of thumbs beyond his jaw. He bows his spine out of the sheets and flexes back in intervals, wanting to get away from the wrought and sticky friction—he can feel
“Oh, that you’re still an idiot,” Tony says with little heat, “but to a lesser degree because I get it. He’s your best friend. I get that. But know this, Steve. I’m not letting you lay on the wire here.”
“I was holding three, two-hundred pound men with the other hand, Tony,” Steve argues and the pout somehow deepens.
“Okay then,” Tony says with a nod after mulling it over. He thinks it’s time to tell Steve—he has another promise to keep—and it’s getting harder and harder not to say it. But he won’t do it yet. Tony could very well ruin them, but he’s not going to ruin Steve’s birthday.
“You kept visiting and you were so kind and helpful and I didn’t know how to break that because it felt so good.” The pull of his lips trembles, like rocked water, makes a set with blue eyes that are beginning to swim. “It was the best thing I’d felt, every moment with you has been like that. Things either hurt less or they don’t hurt at all, and I didn’t want to hurt you. I still don’t. But I can’t do this with you, care about you this way and keep this secret. They can’t both fit in my heart.”
“Right. So JARVIS has been keeping an eye on everything SHIELD since it went belly-up. There wasn’t much to write home about at first, fringe players, mostly, that local law enforcement had a handle on, but now, dangerous weapons are starting to pop-up in regions that definitely shouldn’t have access to the grade of technology that they do, which means that trinkets the Chitauri left behind are being sold to major hitters.”
—is a collection of brandy-colored eyes that glint like firelight, clever hands with tidy nails and blue collar calluses, and a mouth with edges distractingly familiar but shoots off in a way that’s unlike anything else Steve’s ever heard before. At twenty-four, Steve is a coat-hanger frame riddled with ailments and draped in hand-me-downs, a pair of knobby knees that get pins on the hike up to his fifth-floor walk-up, and a type of mouthy that only attracts a bully’s fist. Steve could have stood a haircut two weeks ago. So he can’t fathom what Tony sees, has no idea why he would bother looking at Steve twice, but he had. In the sparse O’Grady’s—its usual crowd long thinned out by the war—Tony had found Steve tucked away in his preferred dimly lit corner, staring out at a silent street that had more tin cans traveling it than pedestrians and keeping a warm, unspilled beer in a slow rotation between his fingers.
“You know what? This was stupid. I’m a genius but the heat knocks off at least twenty IQ points. I should have known better. I’ll put this back, and we’ll just forget about it, okay? Won’t mention it again,” Tony says, breaking the deafening quiet that’s plummeted into dead air. He shakes his head, and the doubt writ on his face yields to decision. He’s opting for retreat, and that is what untangles the nerves for Steve, has him sort out that he does want this—to shake off this debilitating and manacled hold the ice has on him.
After Steve leaves them with another round of kisses and ‘good nights’, Tony looks down into Peter’s bright and thoughtful gaze. “You wanna hear about Daddy’s latest game-changer in renewable energy?”
“He’s probably already had the sex talk, yeah? I don’t have to put the two of us through that? That’s been covered?” Tony asks, dramatically put-upon, once Peter has shuffled out.
Alongside the growing skirt of daylight, a miserable hangover had greeted Tony the next day. Steve sputtering through awkward morning-after talk had only made it worse, his hands a busy flurry in Tony’s face and dizzying. To save himself the trouble of lengthy jail time, Tony had smothered him with a cotton-dry mouth rather than with a pillow he’d been half-seriously contemplating. And after that? Well Tony discovered that he quite liked kissing Steve and being kissed by Steve even when sober, maybe especially. He’s also likes being touched by him, likes the way his fist fits over Tony’s cock and brings him to full-mast with clever ease.
“Apparently it’s going to be an hour before they can get the cooling unit working again,” Tony says when he returns to their hotel suite. He shrugs off his button-up and slings it into the corner chair of the bedroom to join Steve’s already discarded outfit. He skins out of his tank top and once that’s balled up, it follows the shirt.
They stay at Sam's until the next day because Steve did promise Sam a pie and he’d pinned Tony under a disapproving glare when Tony talked about driving to New York on fewer hours of sleep than it took to get there.
Tony nods, releasing a gust of air. “Okay. Peachy keen. That’s great. I’m trying to be patient but I’m also trying not to wait you out. If you want to say no, I don’t want to wait for it to become a yes because that doesn’t help anybody. It’s been a hard balancing act, let me tell you. It’s just—Steve, you can say no. You don’t have to keep dropping hints for a way out. You can just say it. We don’t have to get married, Peter doesn’t technically need two legal guardians. You don’t have to be his—his anything.”
Weeks later, the smell of smoke won’t leave Tony and neither will the sight of Steve, his lips stained with blood and the extent of internal damage so critical he’d been kept in the hospital for several days.
“I’m not answering that.” Steve sighs, a bass note of defeat. “You know that I’m no good with this stuff, Tony. I've never had a talent for putting on a show and I have nothing in common anyone here.”
Tony nods, covers his hand in the gauntlet once more. He keeps the faceplate flipped up so Rogers can hear his voice, and, for his own peace of mind, he orders JARVIS to de-weaponize the suit, although he’s sure it’s already been done. “Is it safe to move him?”
—he’s still in a half-doze. But he sobers up painfully at the bleary sight of Tony getting dressed. Too soon, Tony looks just like he had the minute he walked into Steve’s life. Even with knowing they had nowhere to go but here, logic fails to console Steve as he fakes sleep, shutting his eyes.
“It’s good, so good, I swear,” Steve nicks from the bottom-shelf of astounding, marvelous, mind-blowing, limited to single syllables, and panting in patches as Tony tongues the underside of his cock and into the slit at the head.
” Steve moans, his skin a uniform for his trembling and seemingly meant to burn under Tony’s attention. A finger drags along the crease of his ass, dipping in to stroke over soft skin hidden there before he’s spread open and bared with thumbs.
“You shine up like a new dime, slick,” Tony says, draped in casual but his voice is marginally uneven to his own ears.
And that’s. Woah. He wonders at how many hands Tony has. However, Steve trusts Tony, so he nods, throat working hard.
“It’s soon,” Tony quickly says, sounding as though he’s repeated it to himself ad nauseum. Steve doesn’t doubt that he has. “But, Christ, he’s barely sixteen. He’s younger than I was. He’s a kid and there’s no one else. He’s the only Parker left. And maybe it’s impulsive. Scratch that. It is without question impulsive. I’ve got the market cornered but it feels—something feels knocked out of place, like I won’t be put right if I don’t do this.”
“Jesus,” Tony breathes. Despite his poking and prodding at Rogers at the start of everything, despite feeling the need to worm under his skin, he knows that Rogers isn’t the perfect boy scout. He’s a soldier. Tony knows this, but to see his desperation so visceral and animal is something else entirely.
With a flare of pride, Steve studies the grip Tony has on the water, how his fingers tighten. He’s getting stronger, sitting up on his own, and Steve couldn’t help the small smile if he wanted to. “You definitely could.”
Without preamble, Tony gets up from his chair and steps around the desk. He makes room for himself by pushing aside the random leaflets and papers that litter the surface of it, the fucking New York Times crossword in progress and the pen resting over the tiny boxes, Steve’s wireless keyboard that could definitely stand an upgrade. He sits in the cleared area and pulls on Steve until he’s standing in the vee of Tony’s legs, pleat and denim friction.
“Fuck.” A whimper caught in the tumble of a groan breaks out of Steve. He lengthens his spine, toes curling into the prim texture of hotel towels. “That feels, oh my God, Tony.”
“It’s safe,” Tony starts, hoping Steve’s face won’t dim when he follows with, “in New York. At the tower.”
They’re squabbling over whether or not go for a best out of seven when Steve jingles through the door, keys and what looks like half of the market in his arms. He stops in blatant surprise, mouth open, and now that Tony’s kissed him, it’s pretty much all he wants to do. “Oh. Hey. Um.”
“That is a horrible excuse and Dad is a terrible influence on you,” Peter says. He picks his fork up and spins its handle between his fingers. Lifting a brow and at a length, he asks, “So is this happening then?”
Stranger than fiction, the light’s fragments shape into a man’s silhouette. He greets Tony with bright relief. “Stark!”
Steve bites into it and thirty-one flavors flit across his face, none of them good. Tony sympathizes with an audible wince and passes him a decorative napkin to spit into.
Eventually, the hand towel lays sodden and cube-less and gets kicked out of the way as Steve is rolled flat on his back. Tony settles between his legs that fall away on reflex, and is overcast above him, his hardness nudging at Steve’s own rallying erection. Steve lifts his hips to fit them together; he relishes the hiss it draws out of Tony and wants to wear it like a badge. Steve doesn’t think he’ll ever tire of those noises and the buzz he gets from knowing he has the capability to do that, startle Tony out of his cool.
“Seeing pink elephants?” Tony asks when Rogers rouses from sleep for the third time. It seems like it might stick this go-around. His blue eyes no longer shine like marbles. They look focused and clear from the drugs finally, the brightness more natural.
Resting his knuckles on Tony’s forehead, Steve frowns. “I think it’s the flu. You’re roasting hot, Tony.”
“Tell me, babe.” Tony’s fucking Steve hard and quick, and not slacking off a bit. Each pass over his prostate soaks the notches of Steve’s spine in sparks. Steve rolls into them. “Tell me how much you want it. Tell me it’s good for you. I love you like this, spread for me. Look at you, taking me in. Shit, you’re so tight, Steve. You gotta tell me.”
Here in his bedroom, carefully moving over and in Steve, Tony can’t unsee it. He can’t unrattle that rude laugh from the back of his head. Under him, Steve watches Tony like sees right through to the other side of him. He twines their fingers near the headboard, a tight hold that clenches with every cry.
“Talk about your prehistoric.” Tony nabs dim sum off Steve’s plate and pops it in his mouth. “Not that we have to get married but it is easily doable. C’mon, you’re looking at a well-connected man. What do you want, Sparklers? Dealer’s choice. We could jet off to a private villa, jump in line at the courthouse downtown, or get vodka-soaked in Vegas.”
And it’s truly a crap day because Tony’s heart is doing the impossible and picking up a hammering and precarious beat under his sternum, one that he didn’t even know he still had the instruments for, that snuck in while Tony wasn’t paying attention. Impossibly, it beats and breaks for Steve. Impossibly, because Tony was so sure that Pepper had taken it all with her.
“C’mere. It’s okay. It’s good. You’re gorgeous. Christ, you’re gorgeous everywhere,” Tony murmurs and in the next heartbeat, his tongue soothes over the Steve’s sensitive rim in a gentle coax, moaning shamelessly.
“One question, Stark,” Steve starts, once he’s gathered his wits. He swipes his tongue across his bottom lip because Tony’s focus has always started at Steve’s mouth. The hard swallow he gets in return is incredibly rewarding. “How’s the suspension?”
because everything is base and he’s aware of little else aside from the heat on his cock and the electrifying chill against his hole.
“He’s still looking. The chances weren’t that great to begin with, though, so I don't have my hopes up.”
“Eyes front, Steve. There’s nothing to say sorry for. I love it,” Tony says, wiping his reddened mouth. And hearing that four letter word in the context of his bedroom, despite every intention and indication of a one-off, steeps Steve’s spine in shivers. “I love seeing that, the look you get when you come. And I think you needed it, yeah?”
“Such a fucking minx,” Tony laughs, husky-curled when Steve hooks a heel to his calf, grinding up lazy and smearing what’s left on his stomach with Tony’s precome. He tag-teams it with a lick just beneath Tony’s ear, his lips closing around the lobe and holding it hostage for a lengthy moment between his incisors. For it, Tony grips Steve’s thigh with fingers like brands and rocks against Steve in a way that is remarkably blatant, making a point to wring a noise with little dignity out of him, tally up several of them. Testing the elasticity of Steve’s edges, Tony teases Steve’s nipple, pulling and pinching just so. He cranes his neck to work it over with a broad and hot sweep of tongue before he sets out on a purpling hickey that Steve’s going to have to cover up with concealer before leaving this room again.
Tony still hasn’t made up his mind when he strides over to Steve’s position at the bar where he’s nursing a club soda of all things. His tie is crooked and affection steals a few heartbeats from Tony.
has dulled the details of what he believed would always just be fantasy--holding another man close, his weight and smell undeniably real, having a man watch him the way Tony is now, like Steve’s something precious and desired. He doesn’t know what to ask for and says as much.
“You’re welcome,” Steve manages, hauling himself up. He clears his throat and avoids looking Tony in the eye. “You should get some rest. I’ll check up on you later, okay?”
“Yeah,” Steve says. He means to convey more but it’s cut off by a whimper that sharpens into a cry when Tony’s hand slide to his front and tease his nipples, pulling and pinching. Tony starts fucking him in earnest and Steve pushes into the fast and filling rhythm that Tony gives him. Incredibly, it’s even better, the two of them moving together. Steve isn’t going to make it, isn’t up to the task. The familiar firebrand of an orgasm is coiled in his belly, draws up his balls. He clutches around Tony’s cock and rides back, seeking. “I’m too close. Touch me. I need you to touch me.”
“I hear ya. I do,” Steve voices, tripping his fingers over Tony’s shoulder, seemingly fascinated. “But we could have dinner at that Mediterranean grill that you love, take in some actual live music. Oh and that gelato stand should be up by now. Stracciatella, pistachio, marsala. Which one was your favorite again?”
Tony runs a hand down his slick back, trails down and over Steve’s ass and up again. He rests his forehead at Steve’s temple, kisses his cheekbone and the slope to his shoulder which he then lightly bites into, gets a shiver.
“Um, yes, sleep. Sleep is awesome and we love it and Daddy is so tired. We’re putting you to sleep. How about some warm milk? You like that. Let’s try that. Or a banana? Natural source of melatonin, good sleepy carbs. Bananas?”
Cursing under his breath that’s coming hard, Tony’s hips work in shallow thrusts. He rasps, “Feels so good, Steve. It’s too—jesus.”
When there’s a rare gap in Lang’s extensive rigamarole, Tony says, “Listen, I’m happy to answer your questions, really, but can they wait until, like, Sunday or you can send me an email? I know you have my email address because I’ve given it to you at least twice.”
Eventually their teasing wanes into a hush. There’s a scuffle of not quite kisses and smiles against mouths.
It’s quantifiable and not, because half the time Tony can’t even articulate it to himself, especially when he’s only half of it and more than likely Steve doesn’t feel the same way, but even given that, it still feels irrevocably right.
“What’d you get?” Tony asks, rocking on his feet and nodding at the bag in Steve’s grasp. He pushes his glasses up a bit.
“Just.” Fingers squeezing Steve’s, Tony exhales shakily, nosing under Steve’s ear. “Open it, please.”
Steve Rogers’ idea of a first date. It’s quaint, with the sweet-smelling air, cobwebbed haystacks, and the riot of harvest colors. It’s so wholesome and charmingly original, so incredibly Steve, that Tony’s insides twist with affection even as rotted pulp squelches under his sneakers.
“You think?” Steve pulls Tony’s hands tighter around himself and kisses his fingertips. “Go to sleep.”
“I really, really like him, but he can never be made aware of that fact,” Tony breaks first after a soundtrack of stacking and closing cabinets. He comments conspiratorially, “He’s way too much fun.”
“It started too early,” Tony opens with. “I kissed you and suddenly everything went to hell. I thought when that eventually happened, we’d have more to fight for. That’s what I thought, and then you left—er, well I kicked you out—and I knew that we do have something worth fighting for. I’ve learned from experience that perfection is never going to happen. It doesn’t exist but good does. And I’m pissed at you, Steve. I am. But I think that you and I, we’re good. And I don’t believe that’s worth losing on account of what your brainwashed best friend did before you and I even met.”
“Steve, all I can think about right now is checking the internet to see if Peter is too young to be ordained because I want to say I do as soon as possible,” Tony tells him, half-serious. He is wholly serious when he adds on, “I want to marry you. I cannot anticipate a happier moment in my life than marrying you.”
To his left, Tony confers with Rhodey on the ethics of using the armor. Tony thinks it should be permissible. Rhodey is willing to concur on one condition: that he also gets to use War Machine.
“Yeah, you’ve said,” Tony cuts him off again, clipped. It’s whiplash to have not long ago been so moved by that loving tenor and now, now it’s infuriating to hear—a firebrand coil tight around his spine. “So if there’s nothing new, I’m gonna go upstairs, and I’d really appreciate it if you made yourself absent. It would be extremely considerate of you, Steve. I mean, you are invested in my best interests, right?”
“Hmm. Huh. Alright. I’m saying it now,” Peter states calmly even though his jaw pulses with indignation. MJ calls it
Steve wheels around at the wheeze, and there’s Tony, staring and stupefied with his bedding a train behind him.
Every bit of Steve’s senses collapse to the fever pitch of Tony’s hand on him, the quick rise of a very present and undeniable heat. Dexterous fingers curl around his cock and stroke him sure and slow, slick with sweat.
“I’m sorry,” Steve gasps out, and it incites a seismic shift in him, cracking down to secrets that are buried and feel ancient. Sobbing, he says, “I’m sorry, I’m so sorry, Tony.”
Propped on his elbows above Tony, Steve hesitates before continuing. He finds his words by running the tips of fingers over Tony’s bare skin that’s mottled in shades of pink. “Peter’s parents. May and Ben. I’ve been thinking. Peter’s used to being under the guardianship of heterosexual couples. I’m sure he’s accustomed to—”
Tony’s at the door, no recollection of getting there or to the anger that gets him to wheel around on Steve. “You didn’t know how? You just say it, Steve! You just tell me, for fuck’s sake!”
--it’s instantly too much. Steve bites his cry into the flesh of his lower lip and comes before he even knows to warn Tony, greedily chasing with a thrust up and tangling his hand in Tony’s hair because he can’t stand not to.
It’s Friday night and Tony is two jack and cokes deep. It’s a good night. He can’t decide if it becomes better or worse when he spots Rogers at a till, stuffing a few bills into the sad tip jar while handling a carryout bag, but Tony makes up his mind to follow him out all the same. Over the din of the bar and a top 40 hit, he promises his table that he’ll be right back. Maybe.
The sight--the fact that he gets to have Tony in this way, that Tony can find pleasure in what Steve gives him--makes Steve feel enormously wanted and grateful and lucky all at once, coils a fierce ache throughout him, in his groin. His thrusts lose their timing and turn shorter and arrhythmic, pounding into Tony. He reaches for Tony’s leaking cock as his own release nears, stroking him off.
“Don’t sweat it. Don’t do that. We’re good.” Tony steps close to him, is careful not to hover. With his best efforts, he keeps his restless and empty hands to his sides. Quietly, “Hey, Steve. Hey, are you okay?”
With Tony’s hand in his—Tony’s ring on his finger—Steve shrugs, unconcerned. The spring evening is unseasonably hot; even Tony’s shed off his jacket. He looks lovely in his slate-colored suspenders.  “I took them off in the grass. Left ‘em.”
"Of course. Sure." Steve studies him. Peter looks tired, dressed in sweats and hair dampened with what Steve guesses in sweat. Alongside Tony's workshop, the gym has also been a favorite of Peter's since moving in. “Are you alright?”
“Still nothing on Romanoff?” Tony asks as he checks out the blue light panel running the facial recognition software, seemingly endless in its search and never lingering on a thumbnail for longer than two seconds.
“Sorry, Cap, I didn’t know that anyone would be here,” Peter says, his soft tread stopping at the threshold and his figure darkening the library’s doorway.
So, despite being bordered on all sides by affection, Steve balls up the wrapper from his straw and flicks it right at him.
Christmas Eve is exchanging gifts early and Steve crying as he unwraps a restored black and white photograph of Joe and Sarah Rogers coming through Ellis Island more than a hundred years ago. It's the first picture of them he’s ever owned. He tells Tony the story his mother had passed down to him: the camera she’d seen, how startled she’d been by its flash. Eyes like Steve’s are wide and her thin hand clutches her husband's. There’s strength in the angle of her jaw, also so much like Steve.
Tony’s eyes blink from confusion to worry and his hands unglue from Steve’s skin. Embarrassment clings to Steve like ice, drawing him out of the heated fog that good sex had half-plunged him into. He quickly stammers over Tony’s concern. Damp and shakily, with a frightened pulse, he lets Tony know that he wants this, that he’s
Tony is mostly definitely flirting but Rogers is better than that because not only is he undoubtedly a knockout, intelligent, and in possession of a sense of humor that metaphorically charms the pants off Tony; he’s honest-to-god good. The sort of good that always struck Tony as a myth, presiding by morals and code—a compass that doesn’t waver past true north. Of course Rogers is excellent at what he does—the captivating leader who sparks inspiration and work ethic in their students, even the ones like Tony who are only taking the class as an elective—but more than that, it’s palpable how teaching is a religion to him. For all intents and purposes, his path in life. It’s a faith that he wouldn’t undermine easily, not for something as frivolous as a crush, not for someone like Tony. He’s just too good but damn if that goodness doesn’t make Tony want him all the more.
“Innovative isn’t the word I’d use since I bought it, online at that, but now I’m thinking that I could have made it. You sharpie and bake it, right? Huh, maybe next birthday but anyhow when you went to use the restroom at the gallery, I ran it by the girl at the counter. You know, never dismiss the chance for an objective opinion. She approved, said it may not actually work but that you’d appreciate the thought,” Tony says. “So there.”
Tony engages him in a lengthy stare but aside from that, there isn’t much protest. Because of this, Steve chooses to take pity on Tony and not comment when he does ponder his feet and yank up the hem of his pant leg on his shuffle out, muttering a handful of expletives.
Tony’s phone ringer interrupts whatever spiel Steve has planned, startling them both, and Tony is grateful for the excuse. Tony pulls it out of pocket and reads the number; he apologizes to Steve as he gets to his feet. “Sorry, I gotta take this. We good?”
For a stretch, their mouths weave a keep-away and hide and seek sequence, aiming to exhaust a multitude of kisses with messy handfuls of hair and tender touches, with elegance and without. They exchange ice—shrunken, bitten, almost liquid, compact, and malleable—between used lips that quicksilver from cold to hot and back again.
“Right. Okay then. Two shakes and I’m yours,” Tony says and then he’s swiftly gone and back with an armful of towels. He instructs Steve to get off the bed before laying them out.
He and Tony go until the ice is completely gone, and, at the end, Steve catches himself greedily chasing after it.
“I don’t—it’s just,” Relate to it as he may, the frustration in Peter’s voice claws at Tony. “I mean, you’re so cool about it and he’s treating me like I’m still a little kid. And it feels like. It’s like he hates that I have these powers. It’s almost like he hates—”
“We don’t have to, Steve. God, I could go out and buy a fucking fan at a dollar store or something—”
to lose,” Steve says, wounded. It scrapes out of him, like the words are pulling his heart out and hanging it on a line. And finally Tony’s steady sureness wavers; he sounds no better when he answers back, “Yes.”
And it’s Steve’s turn to wonder and soon every moment they’ve ever shared jars him open and shakes him up hard, unsticks and pieces together everything that he didn’t want to look at wholly. The times he felt a prickling on his neck from behind, the glances that lasted and lasted until they shied away, the touches that seamlessly shifted from shades of enmity to something far beyond fraternity, like they’ve always been familiar, smoothing down patches of arms and over hearts. For a second time, a revelation of love settles inside of Steve.
“In mind?” Steve asks, curled lips over teeth and curled fingers around Tony’s cock. He gives a couple dry pulls, rounds off at the sensitive head that’s already leaking a mess that Tony honestly can’t even bother to be embarrassed about, before stroking back to base slick and easy. “No, not exactly. More in hand, I’d say. Was thinking of treating myself a little.”
“Unless I’ve misread the situation, when you get Barnes back, it won’t just be a buddy-buddy reunion.” He fits himself between two barstools, keeps another between him and Steve. He leans back and crosses his arms before him. “I mean, it’s cool. C'est la vie and whatnot.”
Steve wholeheartedly agrees. He crooks a grin and smooths his hand down Tony’s back. “Like a second house?”
“It was the only outcome. Tried to work around it but—” His clears his throat because it suddenly feels like a funnel filled with kerosene, her words burning all the way up to the back of his eyes. “It wasn’t fair to keep putting her through all of that grief and worry, hoist all of my shit on her.”
“Guess not,” Steve replies, sheepish. He takes the gift and gently tugs the ribbon free, peels away the wrapping paper, and smiles wide when he sees the outside of the shoe-sized box. He barks out a laugh and almost crushes the thing, pitching forward.
“Yeah. That would be great but I was never counting on that to happen.” Steve shrugs, conveys a grudging acceptance. “This is just as good. Tony, you’re my friend. Same as Buck.”
“I’ve got you,” Tony promises, loitering at the inside of his thigh with sucking kisses. He steadies Steve’s cock, a touch Steve’s missed so sorely after only knowing a short while, and licks a wet strip from base to head before taking Steve deep in his throat with one smooth move.
“Get to bed on time and maybe before I leave tomorrow, I’ll really show you what’s not kid-friendly.”
“No way to know for sure, right? He said it. I am in a painful limbo with zero exit signs.” Sighing, Tony rubs at the headache forming at the base of his skull. “But he wouldn’t have said anything if he didn’t trust it was the truth, and god help me but I still trust him. I just—I don’t know where else to to go. I’ve overturned every stone I can think of.”
“I’m Tony.” Steve’s hand is warm in his, filled with heat, and so, so much trouble. Swallowing, he continues, “Tony Stark.”
Tony’s nose presses to the skin behind his ear. His smile stamps over Steve’s pulse and his fingers curl in the cotton of his shirt and the waist of his jeans, splaying over his belly. It feels good. With a small laugh that ships a shiver down Steve’s spine, Tony says, “You know that we’ve got a state-of-the-art dishwasher? If you’ll observe, it’s about five steps to your left. It even has laser technology.”
Face half-mashed in a pillow, Tony wakes up to a finger tracing patterns down his back. His brain still sluggish with sleep, he lazily follows the invisible line Steve draws on him, how it goes lateral, slants upward, and then straightens to the left. Curiously, the shape grows a tail.
It’s akin to keeping a house of cards steady, guarding his secrets with his pulse quickening wildly and ready to leap out of his skin, but Steve tries. “Tony, it’s fine. I want you to get better, and I’m able to do these things for you. I’m happy to do it. You said it yourself that you’re miserable. I remember being sick; it's impossible to forget. I remember how much better I felt having someone who—having someone there for me.”
He swipes what’s leaked to the corner of his mouth, sucks it from the inner bend of his thumb and likes that Steve watches. He likes it even better that Steve hales him up, tracking after his own taste that coats the roof of Tony’s mouth, the space between his teeth and cheek.
“Just like that,” Tony gasps out. All at once, his navel pulls in, tremors run along his thighs, and his back bows, his upper half heaving forward. He clutches at Steve with biting nails, cutting soon-to-be welt paths down his arms. Steve hisses and distractedly Tony slurs, “I’m sorry. Sorry. My bad. Just don’t stop.”
“But I can’t accept you tanking on an exam so what I want is for you to retake it and then I’ll speak with my supervisor regarding my misconduct,” Steve says and Tony’s head snaps up at that utter ridiculousness.
“I don’t want to hurt you,” Steve says like it’s killing him and more important to him, and because of that, Tony answers:
“Nearly every result after her retirement is an auditory file. It appears that SHIELD had surveillance on Agent Carter as recently as April of this year. Transcribed, the second to last recording does fall within our search.”
“Probably isn’t good parenting to just hand over keys to a teen without a license, though,” Tony says and he presses a kiss to Steve’s lips. Settles at three because this warmth spreading in him is difficult to contain. Reminds him of the sunshine he woke up to. He can't possibly keep it to himself. “Depending on when we tie the knot, we could station him at the coat check.”
Steve shoots him death glares but they’re belied by a blush in his cheeks and he doesn’t argue. Peter throws in Kylo Ren’s TIE fighter as a suggestion but really whatever Steve wants
Everything about sex with Tony is unbelievably fantastic but this part right here just might be Steve’s favorite part--specifically wonderful--watching Tony’s hand slip along the short hairs that arrow down his stomach, reach back between his legs, and press deep into the crease. With his fingers pumping in and out of his ass, Tony grins knowingly at Steve, a devilish shape around happy, groans that serve to drive Steve crazy and make him ache.
“He’s my best friend,” Steve replies meaningfully, as though it amasses everything. “Bucky's alive, Tony, and the guy I knew is still in there. I couldn’t even—I won’t give up on him. I can’t.”
Steve presses his lips together against a laugh and starts packing up his things. He generously motions for Lang to take his seat. “It’s alright. I have to head out to the elementary school anyway.” Because Steve actually loves teaching and wants to do it for the rest of his life. To Tony, he asks, “Is it alright if I pick you up tomorrow? At like three? Or if you really have your heart set on that zombie shark thing—”
“Am I the only one who heard the declaration that you just made? This is not just going to go away. Tony, I have never seen you like this.”
“Well you don’t have a monopoly on that,” Steve counters, smirking. His hair sticks up in tufts and there’s no saving it at all, sweat clings to his crown and shines between his eyes. Tony is helplessly charmed.
“Tony and I have been through the repulsor addition discussion a little more than once,” Steve shares with a laughing smile. “He’s learning but it is a slow-moving process. You get used to it.”
Steve wrinkles his nose at that exact articulation but insists, “You and anything does it for me, if I’m honest.”
“Are you?” Tony asks. “And that’s not my being a smartass and or trying to be difficult. It’s a question that I honestly can’t figure out the answer to. I’d be both surprised and impressed if you knew.”
Tony’s fashionably late entrance into the grand ballroom diverges slightly from the smooth strut originally intended. He walks in and like a tether, his eye catches Steve and abruptly the entire world record-scratches. He’s sure of it because how can the universe not stop and take notice of Steve Rogers, so gorgeously cut in a dark blue tux that angels would weep? Tony had picked it out so he knew that it’d look good when he'd handed over Steve's measurements to his tailor but not this
Christmas Eve is frankly obnoxious because Steve is That Guy and Tony’s heart has long unfolded to a truth that feels as permanent as evergreen. And it must be love because Steve’s in the kitchen covered in flour-handprints like some sort of bakery bandit, with loud fuzzy socks on, the sleeves of a hideous sweater shoved up his glorious forearms and Tony isn’t running in the other direction.
“Some would call that bravery stupidity. Both parts.” He cleaves closer, pets down Tony’s stomach, and toys with the navel that sticks out. There’s not an inch of Tony’s body that he doesn’t like. In another life, Steve believes he could even love him. “What’s it is like over there?”
So he misses the better view of Steve coming, instead feels the echo of it through his chest, the warmth that fills the condom with a promise just short of perfect, and Steve’s fingers moving up and down Tony’s ribs. It’s something he does often as if to make sure Tony’s there. Always, always touching Tony.
“Why didn’t you say so? Yes, anything, please,” Steve says, instantly onboard with whatever Tony has up his sleeve and simply tired of melting.
“It really wouldn’t be a day ending in ‘y’ if you didn’t.” Rogers says, turning away from an actual chalkboard and dusting off his hands. He’s got a smirk on his face and Tony has learned that smirk, know that he’s being invited to continue before the words are even uttered. The smirk softens to a smile and the world shrinks to the two of them. Rogers tips his chin. “Go ahead, Tony.”
Due to Tony’s lack of faith in governing bodies, Steve’s door is flanked by a pair of Stark Industries’ guards, but they’ve got an approved shortlist and Natasha Romanoff is on it. Tony sidles up to her after stepping out of the elevator the next morning and finding her, still dressed in the outfit she’d worn on Capitol Hill. He joins her in watching Steve’s unconscious form through the window. “He doesn’t bite.”
Steve gifts him with a flat and unimpressed look. Oddly, Tony finds it’s spectacular and he just grins. “Did the sycophants wear you down already or did you just miss me?”
After Tony nods, Steves adds another carton to his eco-bag on top of the one for a red, white, and blue fruit tart he’s been wanting to try for dessert and actually made Tony print out the recipe for. Steve grabs a thing of strawberries and Tony isn’t near to hives at the sight of them.
“Whoa. What? What?” Peter asks, each one rising in decibels because that’s just wild and categorically false. “No, I didn’t. I’m pretty sure I’d remember something like that.”
“Can I--are you?” Steve asks, feeling himself twitch in the tight clench of Tony’s hole, trembling and gasping at each flex of his hips.
He seems surprised to see Tony, to hear his name, but pleasantly so, the corner of his lips ticking up before he’s bearing a smile with devastating wattage. Steve gives up on opening the door of a car that is absolutely illegally parked and that alone brings a stupid grin to Tony’s face. “Tony! Oh hey! How’s it going?”
Tony presses his lips on whatever salt skin he can reach to soothe. Steve's damp forehead, his nose, the tremble of his mouth. He says, “Come on, babe. Let yourself go for me. Fuck, want to feel it. Come for me. Please, come for me.”
Steve helps carry May Parker’s casket up the steps of a small church in Queens on a mizzling Sunday in late August. It’s a private gathering—he, Tony, and Happy, a few of Peter’s friends and teachers from school, and May’s co-workers. Steve isn’t sure how religious May was, if she ever actually stepped inside of the church that, according to Peter, with its baroque arches and lush flowerbeds always caught her eye but the pastor’s words are kind and compassionate. Peter trembles at the podium, cheeks wet with tears when he speaks despite his attempts to keep stony-faced and between the two of them the service is short but it’s nice all the same.
“You have many upsides,” Steve tells him easily and, yeah, he’s thought about it but, “There’s no guarantee that’d be any better, really. Another place could be having the exact same issue, and considering it’s even hotter outside, it’s not worth the trouble. At least here we know it’ll be fixed soon. We’ll just have to"--he winces here, hates how lulled his brain is and the lame phrasing it washes to the surface--“sweat it out. An hour. We can do an hour.”
“Sam’s important to you and he’s good people. What’s not to appreciate?” Tony replies with a shrug. He reaches for another bag and finds something labeled chili-lime sweet potato chips. “Kind of don’t want to let him have these though. Um, what are these and why don’t they have them at our—the one back in New York?”
“I’m already regretting this,” Tony replies smartly. “Total recall while high is cheating by the way.”
“That’s an exaggeration of events, Tony,” Steve says dryly, recovers the lube and dribbles it across his fingers. And because he’s Steve, there’s a lengthy, precursory of warming—slippery, dexterous, and poised to set Tony right off. And because he’s Steve and is no better than Tony with sex on the horizon, when he’s back, has removed the arm from Tony’s face, he’s everywhere and in. Sure fingers sink into Tony and stretch him open with twists that are familiar and strategic, deliberate strokes that ripple sparks throughout Tony and light up his spine when they rub across his prostate, tug on his rim.
“I’ve got a while,” Sam replies before finally sipping his coffee, but Tony can still pick out the nerves.
Unrelenting, Tony sucks hard around the hot, thick length, gag reflex long forgotten as he inches down further. He makes encouraging noises around Steve’s cock, and when Steve comes, Tony greedily devours everything.
“You have too many jokes for a man who just had, from what I could comprehend, an earth-shattering, mind-blowing, astronomical-charting—”
“Only all too well. I perfected the skill of navigating to the nursery as a freaking zombie. Had to save your life when you fell asleep in the shower.” Tony sways with their little fifteen-month old night owl.
In sweatpants and a t-shirt that doesn’t fit, Steve raps against the glass and, like always, greets DUM-E first, fist-bumping the bot’s arm affectionately. Steve grins at the happy whir he recieves before plopping down on the couch and tucking into what he’s claimed as his corner with his sketchbook, charcoal holder, and whatever candy of the week he’s purchased on a run. Steve claims keeping it in the workshop will stop him from eating too much of the party-sized bag. The strategy hasn’t worked in the three weeks since he’s moved in.
“Hold on to me?” Steve asks, flushed and blue eyes turning black. He's absolutely gorgeous and Tony’s never loved anything or anyone the way that he loves Steve.
Tony watches them talk animatedly, takes note of how they’re no longer paying attention to the muted TV in the background close captioning a Saturday morning cartoon Peter is a fan of and Steve pretends to allow during breakfast even though he’s clearly obsessed with it as well. Absentmindedly turning a strawberry to mush with the back of his spoon, Tony thinks on this nutrition thing that Steve has implemented due to Tony’s doctor showing concern over his blood pressure ranges. Tony thinks on how Steve also took up the lifestyle change in solidarity even though Tony bitches about it constantly.
“Yeah? Not exactly shocking. It’s a good one. Very virtuous tale, right up your alley,” Tony replies. His soot-colored eyelashes are spiked with sweat and canopy a brown that tracks over Steve’s face, glitters even with the lack of light. His damp chest swells on a deep breath and then recycling it out, he says, “So that was just the warm-up. You still with me?”
Before he’s aware of what he’s doing, Steve hovers his hand just over it. He looks up for permission, looking for any inkling of a ‘no.’ “Can I?”
He drops to Rogers’ side, and relief floods him when JARVIS confirms that he’s still alive, reassuring alongside the color in Rogers’ lips and the thready pulse that shivers, a trill in it’s thump-thump rhythm, against the skin of Tony’s fingers. There’s no water in his lungs, JARVIS tells him reassuringly.
Tony eases away, his heart big with affection. He steals touches to Steve’s nose, eyelids, and cheekbones in the departure. He places a palm over the side Steve’s face carefully, stroking with his thumb. “Yes, we can do anything you want.”
Like he belongs there, Tony makes himself comfortable on Steve’s mattress. “Well, there was no telling when you’d be back from sulking.”
“I didn’t draw you from the water, but I found you. JARVIS did the actual calculations, so he should get the majority of the credit,” Tony adds as an afterthought.
“No,” Sam says with a shake of his head and steps aside, gestures Tony through the door. “He’s at the farmer’s market.”
“And that’s why you still can’t fly.” Tony raises his hands in a show of surrender. “But okay, fine. I give, you win. If retro and stretchy everywhere is how you wanna rock it, keep on, keepin’ on, young buck.”
“Serves you right,” Tony chides. “They’re cracked actually. Two of them. But of course they would only feel bruised to you. The serum is doing its job, and you’re on the mend. The worst of it is pretty much over.”
—enrapt with a painting’s dramatic blend of color and complimenting the bravery of one artist’s multimedia display. The exhibit is a tribute to African heritage and culture, and Steve doesn’t pretend to know everything that each label and panel refers to, picking the curator’s brain like a teacher’s pet whenever he has a question and increasingly curious at the tangents the answers introduce. Tony is way too old to find anything adorable but he’s charmed by Steve’s passion, finds him endlessly attractive when he sinks into a crouch to better admire the sculptures, hands close but not touching, fingertips hovering over the contours and swells of the man depicted.
Steve opens his mouth to respond but Tony kind of doesn’t want the answer so he speaks over him. “Think about it this way, it’s for a good cause. You like those, Cap. That’s practically your modus operandi. Just remember that the better you schmooze, the bigger the checks are and the more you’re helping the Annies and Oliver Twists of the world. Also this would probably help considerably.” He gestures to Steve’s bowtie. “You mind?”
, hits send, and turns his attention back to DUM-E’s code, swallowing around whatever just leaped up to his throat.
“It’s okay,” Tony starts, gesturing vaguely. “If you don’t want to do this. I’m not gonna hold it against you. It’s not a deal-breaker for me. I don’t know if it is for you but—”
“Shit. JARVIS,” Tony starts urgently, tapping his wrist and waking up his newest suit, “contact the nearest hospital and tell them that they have Captain America incoming with two GSWs. Send over all of his cleared medical records.”
Tony stares at him in wonder. “Steve, that's just...well the encouraging news is that we’re not the first fools to ever be in love. Miscommunication is fairly common. So we've got that going for us.”
“And now they’ve all pretty much decided they want to push our study session a day back,” Tony says, editing on his laptop with one tab dedicated to google docs and another open with a draft of stern email that borders on passive aggressive, telling the Circuit Analysis class to be sure to bring in the study guide he’ll be attaching
“God, yes, so much,” Steve admits, trembling and nodding. He can’t bother to care what sort of man that makes him. Just, “Please say it again.”
“Thought you said—” He’s cut off by Tony’s hand tightening at the base of him and then jacking up to the leaking head with a truly spectacular corkscrew. Tony’s just too good at this, and Steve's next words come out on a gasp. “What happened to cooling me off?”
“Maybe that’s alright,” Steve says low but the indifferent pitch is gone, same as the quirk of his playful smile. He’s looking right into Tony’s eyes without a hint of sarcasm.
“For fuck’s sake, I’ve made it this long, Mom. Don’t get into a snit. Also you’re a hypocrite.” Tony pops a piece of caramel into his mouth, delights in the crystalline burst of salt and spread of sugar on his tongue. “Yum, this is a new favorite. More of this. So you and Wilson have big plans?”
“Gravity is running rampant in these parts. Think I might have tripped over one of Peter’s,” Tony flails a hand out, gestures vaguely, “doohickies.”
“Yeah, I think I did,” Tony says, breathlessly. Now that it’s out there, he’s experiencing a little delirium, can hear chaos in his ears. He shrugs, goes for causal even though his heart is slamming against his ribs. His hands are shaking. “We’ve got a good thing going here. I love you. You love me. We've got a kid to love. I think he loves us back. Why not do this thing?”
Regardless, in time, Tony pulls off of his own volition. He rests his forehead against Steve’s temple, breathing heavily in a pattern that echoes the
With eyes that catch and don’t abandon Tony’s gaze, Steve withdraws his fingers and Tony’s body, like always, takes Steve’s cock in like it’s just another part of itself.
“Tony, that’s—oh,” Steve moans. His body rolls fluidly under the attention, ribs rippling under the wet heat Tony stripes down the line of Steve’s stomach. He thrusts shallowly, seeking. “Please, please, you gotta.”
“Hey, hi. I, uh, I saw you inside.” Tony jerks his thumb over his shoulder. "I just wanted to come out and say hi. So, you know, hi.”
Tony’s name punches out of him when he rises from the bedside chair; it covers the distance between them. He only lets go of Tony’s hand to hold him by the jaw, brush his fingers over the rasp of his beard and thread the other into his hair, and to finally kiss the incredulous set of his mouth.
“Need you, Tony,” Steve begs, and Tony’s whole life feels pieced together at the words. No, he’d keep this instead.
Without needing to be told or maybe he just understands the half-formed words Tony devolves into, Steve gets a hand on Tony's cock. He hooks an arm around Tony and with his free hand pulls him off, stroking with gained know-how that’s vicious and gives no quarter. And in soft contrast, he nuzzles at Tony’s temple, nose, and mouth--all along the way, murmuring heartfelt admissions. It takes embarrassingly few of them for an orgasm to truck through Tony, causing him to clench down hard and see stars.
And when she finds it, when peace flashes in her eyes and she clenches tight around him with a broken hitch in her cry, Steve can’t fault her for that either but envy soaks the spine that he sinks into damp bed sheets.
Steve is cut off by a particularly nasty hacking fit that’s pitched in Tony’s suit-jacketed elbow, the sound transportive, worryingly familiar, and squeezing a painful fist in Steve’s chest.
The kettle interrupts them with a shrill whistle, and Steve fixes the tea with the boiled water and a generous spoon of honey. He hands it over once it’s steeped and stirred to his satisfaction. “Back to bed with you,” he says.
“Anytime,” he barely gets out, verbally weak in the knees. “So the demanding public beckons and I have to mingle for a minute. Are you good or...?”
“We could go out,” Tony suggests in a hurry and a little too loud, speaking over whatever the hell is vibrating in his insides and up his spine. “Maybe taking a break wouldn’t be so bad? For a couple of days. And being Tony Stark comes with a spotlight but for every spotlight there’s a VIP room. We could do a restaurant or a bar.”
He hasn’t seen Sharon in two years, and he’s grateful to find her. There’s little fortune in being left behind, but Steve thinks that maybe it’s a sign. Godforsaken or not, Steve still believes. You hold on to the chances you’re given, especially when the world turns to ash around you.
Tony blinks at him in confusion, seemingly having no clue what to do with what’s been dropped in his hands. “You don’t have to do this.”
. Tony would laugh because what a fucking line but Steve’s reaction is a telltale. It’s guilt wrapped in shame. He starts to stammer out an embarrassed apology that Tony quickly rambles over because he doesn’t want Steve to take it back. “It’s fine. I do come here all of the time, you know? I drink. Not that that started at exactly twenty-one and, truth be told, I probably drink more than I should but I am twenty-one. So I’m of age. Way past it. Steve, it’s okay. It’s fine. It’s fine.”
As Tony’s grip tightens, so do Steve’s lungs, like he’s handling them one and the same. The symptoms of fever reveal themselves in a sequence that Steve recognizes, harsh breaths lighting up his lungs within sweat-pebbled skin. His backbone squirms like it wants to curl in on itself but it’s worth it to pant out Tony’s name, shunt his hips in counterpoint to the brand-bright pulls on his leaking cock. Steve had no idea that a fever could feel good.
Tony keeps his promise, though. He pays for the steak dinner they get delivered to the penthouse, sticks the sparklers he got at the gas station in King’s County when Steve wasn’t looking into the tart, eats more than half of it and is earnest in his pursuit of the mascarpone and gingersnap crumbs left over in the pan.
“Sir, I’ve managed to locate Captain Rogers,” JARVIS says, nearly four hours after Rogers has gone off Tony’s grid. Tony is trying not to acknowledge exactly how impressive that is. His workstation still has the black and white image of Rogers’ face hidden under the bill of a baseball cap pulled low, caught in the act of pilfering his Smithsonian owned uniform.
“No one’s going to.” Snorting a laugh, Tony takes the baking sheet off of the counter and dumps everything on it into the trash. “They’re better suited for the incinerator, honestly, but it’s too far away.”
Steve eyes leap from the folder to Tony, a tightness between them that Tony can’t quite put a name on, more potent than anxiety or fear. The grip he has on the dossier floods his knuckles white. “Is there. Did you—did you find anything?”
“Unfortunately, that doesn’t stop," Steve says because he's never going to lie to him. "But it’ll stop breaking your heart each time you think of her.”
“All of them and you know that. That list is enough of a turn-on that I’m considering a third round.” Tony nods because chances of him saying no were non-existent. “Okay, yeah let’s do it, I’m cultured. Not to mention sugar deprived.”
“Everyone your age has a Netflix account. You don’t have a Netflix account? Are you okay? Should I be worried?” Dad pauses, bringing up a finger. “Wait a second. How have you been binging
