“He is the only one I trust to get me obscure items,” Tony agreed and gestured to his jacket. “I could not be upstaged by Brendon.”
Natasha had texted Wanda on Christmas morning, asking if they could go shopping together for the New Year’s Eve party.
Okay, I use some Russian and make references to a) a deleted scene from Civil War and b) a choice Natasha made in the comics (though I don't recall which run specifically) that I think should be noted to avoid any confusion. I clarify some of the Russian along the way, but I'm going to masterlist them right here-- please note I do not speak Russian and had to source the words from the internet in various locations, so if you do, please correct me if I'm wrong.
Their food arrived, leaving the table in silence for a few minutes while everyone all dug into their respective plates. “What about you, Pietro?” Clint was scraping the last dredges of grits out of his bowl. “You’re never home.”
“I’m sure you want to go say goodbye to your friends,” May sniffed and dabbed at her eyes once more. “So I’ll see you later, okay?”
“We spent so many hours observing how Bucky, Steve, and Pietro’s patterns. They were never infallible. I just wanted to replicate that in the programming,” Peter murmured distractedly, watching the fruit of their labor fall as Bucky pinned one of them to the mat and disabled it before moving to the next bot.
A knock on the glass startled both of them. Their shared reaction to turn towards the door must have been delayed by the early morning hour, only in time to see that Peter was waving as he ambled through the door. “Did I miss my invite to the science club brunch?” He held up a bag of bagels in offering, putting them in the middle of the table as he pulled up a chair.
It was easier to skip the dwelling, the agonizing over possibilities, in favor of meeting Wanda in the garage. Nat lifted a hand and waved, seeing Wanda’s silhouette speaking to Pietro and Sam outside of the car. Happy had agreed to drive them today, back on security detail after a short holiday break, and familiar with all of the ins and outs of traveling in the tourist season. Sam waved back to her, lacing his free hand with Pietro’s and tilting his head toward the elevator. Pietro gave Natasha a nod as she approached, which was more than she’d expected, before he followed Sam’s gentle tug away.
The men turned their heads in horror to the sound of Wanda’s voice at the door. No one had heard her open it, and she was hesitating in the hall, waiting for her brother’s answer.
“You always wear red,” Nat dismissed gently. “Well, and black. Unexpected would be, I don’t know, sparkles.”
Nat was a creature of habit, gravitating toward black in most of her choices. Eventually, she settled on a halter dress that was dip-dyed red on the bottom, flowing and comfortable with a slit in the leg that would show off a pair of heels. Wanda assured her it was beautiful, complimenting her skin tone and not competing with her hair. As Nat handed her card to Geoff, she had to hold her breath to savor the look on Wanda’s face. The excitement was blatantly clear, and it felt like they had their footing once again.
Tony hadn’t expected the first step into Steve’s floor to be stepping onto what appeared to be a silk tie. He picked it up, cautiously looking ahead to see if there was anything else he should avoid between here and the hallway. The coffee table— cufflinks. Why on earth did he need to wear cufflinks to Peter’s graduation? This was the opposite of blending in. Stark shook in head, focusing on the trail of breadcrumbs that would clue him in regarding which room he might find Rogers in. Four steps— a (now wrinkled) dress shirt. Handmaiden was sounding more and more accurate as Tony gathered the shirt from the floor and stopped outside of the bathroom door. Knocking a few times with no response, he threw the door open, only to be met with an empty room. Empty, that is, aside from the shoes and pants that lay in a pile on the floor. Was he wearing anything he had put on this morning?
His comment teased a smile to Wanda’s lips as laughter spilled into the air between them. She nodded, finding his words so ridiculous after what she had just shown him. Bucky’s hand wrapped around her shoulder as he let go of her fingers, enveloping her in both arms with one hand pressed to her hair. It would have been easy, to melt into his embrace, to tip her head in hopes that he might meet her halfway. Yet, none of it felt right-- not now, when he had only her own desires implanted in his mind. She had to let him decide for himself.
“I spent so much time in the apartment, when we came to live.” Pietro nudged his sandwich aside to prop his elbows on the table, resting his face on his folded hands. “I am comfortable, now. I spend much of my time with Sam, and with the team.”
“The kid shoots webs already, I don’t think we need to employ another projectile here,” Tony declared as he chewed thoughtfully. “Next suggestion.”
“This is the groundwork,” Natasha declared. “You start where you’re comfortable. What can we add to this that would make it completely different?”
Scott stuck his tongue out, ever-childish, but obliged Bucky’s order and downed the last cup of beer on the table. “Come onnnnn team, we’re counting!”
Modest should have been an applicable descriptive word for a team party. Steve would have also accepted simple, low-key, or any related synonyms. He certainly did not expect the rapid flurry of activity that had happened in the last week, all at the bidding of one Tony Stark. Still, it was easier to just be pulled along for the ride and humor his boyfriend rather than point out that no one needed lavish clothes, food, or drinks to have a good time.
“You make it work,” Tony admitted, circling the room to get a good look at both of them. “Of course, I pay Elijah to make it pretty fail safe in the first place, but you know what I mean. Barton, Steve, get on with it.”
I don't know where to start in terms of notes. This semester was rough, and I'm about to go into my last. That means infrequency, again, but hopefully not 4-5 months of it.
“But they won’t,” a voice from the hall startled both of them, causing Clint to jump further into Sam’s office. “You are giving them no credit, Clint.”
Tony reached for a bagel as Bruce raised an eyebrow. “Pardon me, I like fresh bagels!” He stuck out his tongue as he got up in search of cream cheese, undeterred by Bruce’s judgemental eyebrow.
Wanda shook her head, dispelling Pietro’s assumption. “I am telling you the truth, Sam. I am angry that they treated me like a child, unable to think for herself or handle her emotions.”
“Tell me, therapist,” she snapped, “do you think my depression merely ended after time passed? Do you think that so many people dying at my hands got any easier?”
“Do you think I need your power to read you, Wanda?” he taunted. “Your actions, your posture, your energy itself tells anyone about the fear that is buried in you.”
Barnes unfurled what appeared to be a leather jacket. Tony was unable to help himself from examining it, leaning over to peer behind Bucky’s shoulder as they silently judged the jacket. He couldn’t stop himself from bobbing his head in a content nod, internally musing that it couldn’t have been a better choice for Barnes if he had picked it out himself. Well… actually, it was probably a better choice considering he hadn’t picked it out. Steve knew Bucky better than anyone, and it showed in even the smallest gestures. Moto-style and weathered in all the right places, everything from the brushed-gray stripes on the biceps to the vintage pockets looked like a smart marriage of two New York City eras that Barnes embodied. He looked at Steve over Bucky’s shoulder, hoping his eyes conveyed approval.
“Don’t let anyone take that from you,” Clint said seriously, dropping a few bills on the table. “I learned that the hard way, and I won’t let it happen to either of you.”
Steve rolled his eyes as Clint consented to some all-black ensemble, the only notable item being a leather jacket that looked entirely too expensive.
This chapter was extremely difficult for me to write. Sometimes, when you have a plan, it can cloud what you need to be doing-- and I'll own that I over-planned this chapter. Stepping away was helpful, and allowed me to finish it after too many failed attempts.
Peter had texted Clint to ask if Natasha would occupy Wanda, a sure signal that there was something about the bots that needed to be discussed. Clint tossed his phone to Nat, raising an eyebrow as she sighed.
“Then don’t sound so wounded,” she muttered into her pillow, not bothering to roll to look at Tony. “Look, I’m comfortable, so you can harass me from where I am or come back later.”
A month ago, it might have felt like a slap. Now, it was worth clinging to, and Nat gave Wanda a genuine smile in return. “You look beautiful. Ready to go?”
A chorus of consent (and requests) rang out as Elijah waved, dragging the rolling rack of clothes out with him.
Leaning in to wrap Steve in an embrace, Tony settled his head in the crook between Steve’s shoulder and neck, watching Peter talk to the twins and Clint. He didn’t know what to do with overwhelming emotions, even the positive ones. In the two years since he had approached Peter, Tony Stark had developed a slew of emotions he hadn’t felt since he and Pepper had gone their separate ways— and some he didn’t know he could feel. Watching him fight alongside the team evoked pride, sure, but it also paired with something that Stark could only define as genuine fear. He had never looked at another person and knew without a single wavering doubt that he would do anything to protect them, that he could love so fiercely, nor act so recklessly in the name of another person’s well being. Clint picked that moment, Tony wrapped comfortably around Steve and watching Peter, to look right at him. If it had been anyone else, Stark may have stiffened or looked away— instead, he met Barton’s gaze with every unspoken emotion that he was puzzling out. Steve slipped his arm around Tony’s waist in unknowing tandem to the moment Clint looked away, eyes cutting to Pietro and Wanda before nodding. The answer was as unspoken as the questions; those feelings come without warning, they aren’t fleeting, and they don’t fade.
“Can someone please explain why Ant Man just came out of a stripper cake?” Pete asked, looking entirely earnest.
Sam slid down the wall to sit next to Pietro’s pillow. He reached out for the younger man’s hand, nudging at it to wake him up. The darkness didn’t conceal tear-swollen eyes when he blinked awake, unsure of who was there with him.
“I know you’re awake, and I know you heard us— maybe not every word, but you heard us talkin’ about you. Wanda, if you aren’t ready to leave your room right now, we can just talk right here. You need to talk to someone.”
“Is ‘something red’ a good answer?” Wanda snorted, picking up a black dress only to tuck it back on the hanger a moment later. “I don’t know. I want to wear something that is unexpected.”
“Maybe,” Tony allowed, mouth half-full of a street taco. “Depends on what everyone wants to do. I didn’t plan any games.”
“Wanda’s lucky she won’t be fighting these things hand to hand,” Barnes declared as he flopped to his back. “The hell did you make these out of?”
“Thank you, Mister Stark,” Peter responded as he shook Tony’s outstretched hand. “Hey, um, if you don’t mind, could you take a picture of Aunt May and I?”
Wanda couldn’t help but laugh, beelining for her brother to tug him out of the chair for a hug. “You look quite dashing.”
May grinned, slipping an arm around Peter’s waist as he slung one over her shoulder. The memory would make her happy, as much as he wasn’t a huge fan of pictures.
Bruce couldn’t bite back the laugh as he picked up the cup, sniffing it to confirm the contents-- a London Fog. “You didn't mix up our cups and it isn’t even 7am. Color me impressed.”
“Sorry, Spiderling, this is mine— and you can’t borrow it!” Tony looked pleased with himself, nodding to Elijah as he gathered hangers and a garment bag. “Next contestant, I need to hang this up.”
“They said we would change the world,” Wanda answered sadly, “and so did Ultron…” Her voice broke into another sob.
“Elijah?” Tony was beaming. “I know it’s 2am, but listen— yes I know. Elijah. I need the jacket Brendon wore for the last premiere.” Steve heard a pause and shifted so he could lean his head back to watch Tony pace in front of the windows. “Yes, the gold brocade. What? Come on, there’s no possible way that was the last one. You and I both know I will pay double.” Another pause and Tony was smirking, shooting Steve a thumbs up. “I expect it before New Year’s Eve. Yes, for a party. Sure, I’ll send Afranco my best. Goodnight.”
“They don’t always evade,” Bruce mused. “Which means your programming features have been realistic, Peter. They need to be able to take hits. You’ve made them reasonably realistic to humans— no person would be able to evade or counter every attack, even an enhanced one.”
Tony tugged them both in closer, grin broad and genuine (and maybe a little inebriated) as he heard the click of Bucky’s phone a few times. “Did you get a good one?”
“She went out with Natasha, Dr. Banner,” Pietro supplied as he appeared in the kitchen. “I presume they will be gone long enough for us to have a conversation.”
Sam didn’t bother knocking and Natasha didn’t bother changing. Sitting on the couch, she pulled her knees closer to her chest, her face resting against them with Clint’s shirt bunched around her. He couldn’t miss the haunted look on her face, the one he’d seen during some of their sessions, that was the closest to fight or flight as she would ever show. Nat met his eyes and stood to follow him to Wanda’s door, taking care not to step on Pietro in the dark. Before she could lean down to nudge him awake, Sam shook his head, gesturing that he would handle it. Natasha exhaled before nodding, going to her and Clint’s room to check in on him.
“They’ll have to do.” She was tired, having spent weeks training for upwards of six hours a day before Peter and Bruce had taken the bots back for maintenance. “The coffee is good, though.”
“I go to therapy with Sam. What else is there to do?” She was tired. There wasn’t any point in going to the gym, to the dance studio, or even eating breakfast with anyone at the bar in the Commons kitchen, when she was tired. The serum wasn’t doing it’s job. “I’m tired, Tony. Are you here to tell me all the things I’m doing wrong? I think I hear quite enough of it from James.”
“No. I stayed in, on Tony’s birthday-- I was not ready to face the height. But now, it seems too beautiful to be afraid of.”
Not long after, the Avengers began to fill the observation deck. Clint and Nat arrived first, both looking anxious and tired. Pietro highly suspected that neither of them had slept much the night before, but that was neither here nor there. Sam, Steve, Peter, Bruce, and Tony arrived together, with Bruce bearing the brunt of the anxiety in the room.
Nat clicked her tongue, picking through their separate piles until she pulled a cranberry, velvet bodysuit out of her own selections. Hanging it over the door, she knocked to get Wanda’s attention. “Put that on. Trust me.”
She fiddled with her orange juice lid, one hand still clutching the blanket at her shoulder. “So you knew about them.” It wasn’t a question. Sam nodded, waiting for her to continue. “I have been in my room. I did not wish to talk to anyone.”
He remembered how Tony had sat on their bed in the beginning, wondering if he was going mad, and Steve thought he could finally understand how he’d felt back then. There were too many coincidences. Too many things coming together. And Tony was standing in front of him and he didn’t remember what they’d shared.
. He’d sort of hoped to put an end to their fight like that. He’d wanted Steve to realize that they had both just wanted to look out for each other and that’s what teammates did so: No harm done, right?
“‘m holdin’ my liquor jus’ fine,” Rhodey answered with an eyeroll. Together, they made their way through the crowd, holding on to each other even while shaking hands and saying their goodbyes.
Steve stared at him, still panting. Was he okay? He shook his head, looked at his hands. How could he do something like that? This sort of thing had never happened before.
Big-Ant-Guy, however, proved frustratingly strong. There was no way he was relying on natural strength—his suit had to be a marvel in itself and Tony had some vague memory that he’d seen blueprints of this, but he couldn’t put his finger on it. The process of size alteration had to generate huge amounts of physical force and momentum, which would be scaled beyond that of normal humans. In any case, he paid Tony back every punch. Every kick. Every anything Tony threw at him to finally get to Steve. It was damned irritating, and had T’Challa and Rhodey not swept in and taken him by surprise Tony might have been a puddle on the ground by now.
“It’s just a name,” Steve said, the hand still resting on Tony’s cheek caressing his jawline. “It doesn’t define who you are. And who you are, Tony, is a good man.”
“Guys?” a worried voice asked via the comm line, but there was mostly just white static and garbled feedback. “Is—
There was something in Tony’s eyes that he’d never seen before. It looked as if for some reason, he wanted to hate this, but couldn’t.
It was still dark outside when Tony woke up, and he had a hard time remembering why he, a forty-six year old man, had deemed it a good idea to lie down on a goddamn hardwood floor. His back hurt, his neck was stiff, and there was a weight on his waist and another across his legs. Then he remembered. He was lying in one of the guest rooms in Clint’s farm, and he’d had his reasons for not using the bed. Reasons that… hadn’t been reasons at all, seeing as how Steve had apparently joined him on the floor last night, instead of using the actual sleeping surface.
His heart felt as if it was going to stop out of pure, insupportable rapture and when he came back to himself he found Tony completely limp beneath him, still panting into the curve of his shoulder.
“I…” Maria sighed, pointing at Tony. “I didn’t mean it like that, just… you’re the last person I ever thought would want kids. Is that Steve’s doing?"
Tony sighed tiredly. This was getting really old, really fast. “It wasn’t Barnes who killed any of those people,” he said with every last grain of patience that he could muster.
Last night, Reed Richards and Bruce had both confirmed that he’d been hit by the Time Gem. The traces the Infinity Stone had left on him were unmistakable—apparently. He’d been hit by the Stone’s power and flung through time, catapulting him here.
“Ultron didn’t go after JARVIS ‘cause he was angry,” Bruce explained from the workstation. “We believe he attacked him because he was scared of what he can do. So JARVIS went underground—dumped his memory, but not his protocols.”
“Sam,” Steve said before he could even finish the thought. There weren’t a lot of people in DC  he trusted, but he did trust Sam. “We should be as far off the grid as possible.”
The correct answer was ‘zero’, but Steve felt his reservations crumble. “How about I quickly return your favor this morning and I’ll try to be there on time?”
Tony nodded, hating that there’d be radio silence from here on out, but with Ultron controlling basically everything, there was no way around it. He felt Extremis steadily restoring itself, and it was more powerful than ever, but using it would be too much of a risk at this point. He'd have to wait until it was stable enough. “I’ll join you as soon as I can,” he said.
Rhodey stared at him, and everything in his face translated to ‘No chance, buddy’. “So it’s true?” he asked. “You guys are actually doing this?”
“That stuff though…” Tony said, still scrubbing his skin furiously. “It’s like falling into field of stinging nettle and posion ivy which is inhabited by a hive of fire ants. It’s not contagious, Jo confirmed so, but I feel like peeling off my skin.
With that he was gone. Tony groaned and flopped back to the mattress. The next time he woke up, the coffee next to his bed was already cold. The RV was abandoned, and Tony released a long sigh and tried once more to get up. He glanced around the room wearily as though daring the hand of God to knock him back down again.
For whatever reason, it hadn’t even occurred to him up until now that Tony might have fallen asleep outside as well. His senses hadn’t been attuned to his presence so far. He didn’t know what he had been expecting, when waking up next to Tony, but it wasn’t what he saw now.
“Son of a bitch,” Tony breathed. His head was buzzing, white noise masking every other sound. He glanced at Natasha and saw what he’d already known he'd see. It had been foolish to believe this had been Bucky’s doing. “We gotta get this to Ross.”
“A pleasure,” Stane said, twirling his cane again. Then, to Tony, “There are a few contracts you’ll have to sign. I prepared an abridgment you can read in your office. I’ll handle the details.”
The insult had no punch. Tony clearly wasn’t angry; rather, his entire being almost thrummed with energy.
“Joke, Steve,” he said, chuckling as he leaned up to kiss him again. “Just joking. Can’t wait to have you inside me.”
Tony smiled. “Then I don’t see the problem. We can’t get married, obviously. But by all means, I’m offering you all the pleasantries of becoming my husband. I could take you to Florence and Paris and Barcelona. Everywhere you want.”
He didn’t know how much time had passed before the car came to a stop. Tony groaned as Bruce nudged him gently. “Sorry, I need you to stay awake.”
Steve nodded. And there was no fear in his eyes any longer. The tears had dried. No more hesitation—only resolution.
“Watch it!” Steve rushed to turn it on for him. “You’ll make yourself bleed again.” He pulled the covers back and sat beside him to inspect his bandages while Tony took in the room. Steve had brought him to his floor, but considering the sterile gauze that was neatly wrapped around his middle, he’d obviously been to medical before.
“Okay…” Steve said, and there was that frown again. “You know, Tony, you’re being kinda vague for someone who’s from the future.”
But he knew better. Tony wouldn't react well to being confronted about things he said when he thought Steve was sleeping. He might not deny it, but Steve couldn't predict a reaction either way, and he didn't want to break the spell just for the childish act of asking if Tony really meant it.
All the energy left Steve. “I didn’t want any of this,” he urged. “Don’t think this isn’t breaking me.”
He walked over to one of the benches and sat down on it. “How can he know that? He hasn’t contacted me.”
Tony hummed and looked more amused than anything else. “I might have to tease you with that once you get back. You never said you had feelings for me this early on.”
"I sorta figured that out," Steve supplied. He nearly said something more along the lines of being relieved about that but... Tony already looked ready to detonate, and Steve didn't want to be the one to set him off.
Steve slowly brushed a finger along Tony’s left temple. “Be careful, alright? Knowing that you and Vision will fight him where I can’t reach you… I don’t like it.”
known—and simply hadn’t talked to him about it. “I know they’d been your first choice. And, sure, I think they have a point that now isn’t the best time. It sure won’t get any calmer in the next weeks, and we can’t know when things will get back to normal, but…”
That had him chuckle, as his fingers drifted along Tony’s back. “And after?” he asked, and for the first time, the question didn’t make his insides clench uncomfortably.
that he can, but… Steve, what’s going on?” Natasha asked, outright frowning now. “You’re keeping something from us, aren’t you?”
Fuck, it was just like Steve to do something like this. The guy simply couldn’t let someone else take the brunt of all the dirty work. He’d been happily diving into his death. Laying down on the wire like he’d always said he would.
He set both hands on Tony's hips and pressed forward in smooth, slow thrusts, meeting Tony every time he moved back. Soon, he was in to the hilt, engulfed in heat and wetness and pure perfection. "Christ, you’re hot," he murmured, nipping at Tony's neck as he pressed tightly against his body, not yet ready to start pulling out again. "So hot…"
Finally, with a moan of defeat, Tony opened his eyes and concentrated on the task of pinpointing the source of the sound and making it stop.
“Did you get a hold on Bruce and Thor?” Steve asked, leaning forward to where Clint and Natasha were sitting.
When Tony stood up, stretching his arms and kneading the muscles in his neck, he jumped a mile when the room’s speakers suddenly gave off a low beep.
He frowned, then cleared his throat. Right. Pepper had said something about the room having no phones and he’d be contacted via the speakers, instead. Stepping up to the monitor that was installed next to the workshop’s exit doors, Tony activated the camera, then looked up at the face of one of the tower’s receptionists. “Yeah?”
After a moment, Tony raised an eyebrow at Steve. “Don’t get your panties in a twist, I was just saying… didn’t mean anything by it.”
Steve was sitting in front of his favorite easel, a canvas set in place and a brush in his hand. The page was still perfectly white and Steve was stalling, not wanting to taint it just yet. For the better part of the last hour he'd been trying to decide what method he felt like going with. Eventually, he put down the brush and reached for a pencil, giving it a considering look.
"That’s the point," Steve said, his eyes still roaming Tony's perfect back. How could a guy look this good from behind? It was unreal.
The pitch of Steve’s moans rose and fell with every jerk of Tony’s hips, and Tony didn’t know how much longer he was going to last at that pace. He couldn’t remember ever having fucked someone this hard, and Steve loved every second of it. His upper body was slumped forward in perfect submission, his forehead pressed into the armrest. Tony watched intently as he was panting, digging his fingers into the cushion so hard his knuckles turned white.
Steve took a deep breath, clearly weighing very carefully what he could say and what he couldn’t. “I think it’s safe to say that we get along really well these days.”
. “Not having you around is pulling him down,” Tony said. “Trust me, he’s moody as hell and it’s really starting to go on my nerves. So if you’d kindly get over yourself within the next year, it’d be real great. And anyway—” He cast Barnes a grin. “—you know Steve. He won’t stop trying, no matter what you do.”
Natasha released an exaggerated breath and twisted in her seat. “Steve has found someone to get him laid, something he has been grossly in need of since—quite frankly—I’ve known him. And even you admitted last night that Tony was the least likely person in the world to hurt him. So please put an end to your irrational objection right now.”
“I did,” Steve said. “I’d almost forgotten what it’s like to eat a meal without providing one at the same time.”
"Maybe some other time," he said, running his fingers along Tony's arm. He didn't want to reject the obvious attempts at helping him, but Steve felt the only help he really needed at the moment was some peace and quiet, and the reassurance that Tony was here with him despite what'd happened. He tried to smile, and found that he could. It didn't even waver as he glanced at Tony's face. "You're taking this better than I am," he admitted, turning to kiss his forehead.
“Who are you?” he asked. He pointedly put his right hand on the table, his watch gleaming under the bright electric lights. One movement and he’d have the Iron Man gauntlet at the ready. The guy wouldn’t even know what was coming for him.
“Look, Tony. They want to have a good time, just like we do. I mean, I know you like Nat, and Sam, and Steve. Or you used to, at least. Bucky—not so much, I get that, but… we all won’t be seeing much of each other as soon as freshman orientation begins, so I’d actually thought this was a good idea. We’ve been friends for a long time, and I kind of figured you would like to spend a bit more time with…”
There were very few things that elluded Tony’s understanding. How HYDRA had managed to wreak that much havoc in one single human brain was beyond him. True to Bruce’s predictions, once an implant was deactivated, the memories seemed to all but flood Barnes’ mind. And ever since, his unconscious body had tensed and shook and bled in random surges. It hadn’t been a pretty sight to begin with, but the last attack had really taken the cake—fuck, the whole goddamn bakery.
Steve smiled at the sight, he just couldn’t help himself. Tony’s hair was tousled, his shirt had holes in it and there were about a dozen stains on his arms.
“Stop!” Rhodey said, turning around and reaching for Steve’s hands. “Fuck, Steve. Stop twisting yourself in knots over this. Indries is dead! Tony knows that—we
As Steve looked down on the remaining sparring partners, he did wonder whether Wanda and Pietro would ever be able to really fit into the team. After everything that had happened to them, it seemed they hadn’t found the thing to live for yet.
Taking a deep breath, Tony pointed towards the time machine. “That was the last adjustment,” he said. “Everything’s good to go now. We shouldn’t miss your window.”
Tony moved a tiny bit closer to Steve and patted the now free space next to him, rolling his eyes when Bruce gave him an insecure look.
Tony smiled, warm and happy—and it seemed to be enough for now. He drew his lips down Steve’s body, kissing and licking every inch of flesh he came across. Eager hands turned to the fastening on Steve’s jeans, born with single-minded intent that made Steve’s heart pound faster than he thought possible.
“Dammit Natasha, this is not…” Tony heaved a great breath. “It’s not about who we are right now, or who we are for each other. It’s about bringing them in before someone
Nothing ever changed. He woke. He travelled. He killed. He slept. From his seat in the plane, he stared down at the world and waited for it to make sense. He sat for hours and waited for the voice inside his head to make sense.
They traded a flurry of blows and high punches and Batroc got him right in the stomach, knocking him down some steps. Steve fell and bruised his upper arm on the railing. Batroc flung up his hands against the next blows instinctively, then realized that it was only a deceit. But in his moment of distraction, Steve was able to slam his elbow into Batroc’s neck and knock him out.
He fidgeted a bit at that but said nothing. It wasn’t that easy, not by a long shot, but Steve obviously wouldn’t budge on this. And whenever his mind was set on something, Steve could be as unmoving as Mount Rushmore.
"It's waving at me," Steve realized then, ignoring Tony's degrading words. "You made it yourself?" he asked, approaching the mechanical wonder. The arm lifted a little, then lowered, as if inspecting him, maybe measuring him up.
It took him another beat of contemplation, but eventually Tony dragged the towel off and away, scowling at him. “There.”
Tony huffed, sounding almost amused. The mist abandoned his eyes for just a second, and Steve found him looking at him with flecks of guarded adoration. “Could’ve had it all, huh?”
JARVIS hesitated a tad too long, obviously torn between being honest to Steve and acting in Tony’s best interest. Tony and Steve were putting him in that conflicting situation every other day, and while Steve was sure that JARVIS liked him in every way an AI could, he usually sided with Tony.
“Steve,” Tony whispered, feeling all kinds of useless. This had never happened before, not since they’d gotten together—not since their first night all those months ago. Steve had always been very still while sleeping next to him, and besides a few mumbled words here and there, he’d been quiet. Now, he seemed to be one step from screaming,
Bucky’s first real error was one of timing. He took a stab at Steve when he was already moving away, and his knife got stuck in the handrail next to them. The sharp blade sank deep between the metal bars, and before he could pry it loose, Steve had pushed him away.
“Guys…” Steve started in warning, then trailed off when a robotic voice suddenly resounded in his ear piece.
The words had a lump form in Steve’s throat, and he couldn’t find a way to answer properly. He knew—
Steve stilled—as he always did whenever Tony showed him unexpected affections. Especially in public like this. But the others truly didn’t seem to care—they just smiled at them.
It would make Steve happy. That was all that mattered. The fact that he was currently so tired he couldn’t see or think straight was immaterial.
And time travel was tricky business. It was so easy to change what had been—and what would be. If someone travels back in time, anything that someone did would serve to create the future he lives in. Or it may create a different future altogether.
As Steve opened his eyes a few days later, the sun was already high in the sky, and there were voices and footsteps and sounds everywhere, as if the walls and the floors were always buzzing with life.
The last days had gone by so slowly Steve swore he could feel each damned minute melting into the next. He never really left medical, mostly sleeping in one of the spare beds in the empty examination rooms. With Tony spending hours upon hours in Bucky’s room, there wasn’t really a reason to go back up into the penthouse. So he just sat there, staring at the blackened out glass front, watching Tony and Bruce filter in and out of the room, and each tick of the clock felt like the twist of a knife. One more minute, he thought. One more minute until Bucky would wake up.
“Come on, Steve,” Tony said, shaking his head in amusement. “I’m not asking you to be my assistant.”
“Because we’re married,” Steve said, huffing as he stared first to the ceiling, then back at Tony. “How did we ever get together?”
Next to him, Tony jerked bolt upright. They’d been sleeping in the shelter, or not-sleeping, in Steve’s case. It was a bit pathetic, the endless minutes Steve had been staring at the wall in front of him as he listened to Tony’s breathing.
"Thanks, Tony," he said, getting to his feet and marching towards the exit. Turning at the door, he glanced at the genius. "I…" What? What else did he have to say? An exasperated smile rose to his lips. "I'll be back… later, maybe. If that's alright with you?"
Tony nodded shortly and watched as a van came to a skidding halt next to them. Steve rushed over to open the sliding door. He quickly scooped Tony’s form up after throwing his shield into the car.
Tony nodded, holding onto Steve tightly, trying to give him some sort of solace. He knew, better than anyone, that nothing could be done to erase whatever memories were haunting Steve. He couldn’t change the past, he couldn’t make him forget, he could only stay at his side until the trembling of his muscles calmed.
Tony stared at him for a long, incredulous minute, unknowing what to say. Finally, he resorted with a weak, “Really?”
“Anyway,” Rhodey said, “I liked Steve when I met him, but you wanna know when I realized he’d be really good for you?”
Tony watched her as she unrolled a length of gauze, pulling him forward into a hug so she could wind it round his chest, and then around his abdomen. She slowly finished bandaging, then began returning the equipment she’d used into the box. By the time she spoke up again, Tony had almost forgotten what they’d been talking about. Above them, rain roared loud against the walls, as though the raindrops drumming on the roof were trying to wash away her words.
“Steve?” Tony called, frowning as he paced the length of the hallway, pausing periodically to look down on the various books that were deposited in the large boxes. He remembered how much Steve had looked forward to reading some of the new political thrillers Natasha and Bruce had gifted him with for Christmas. The books had clearly not been opened once.
Tony huffed, and Steve saw his hands flexing. “Hate to break it to you, but constantly staring at me from across the conference table isn’t trying to have a conversation.”
“Extremis is much more powerful than before. We’re guessing it copied some of Ultron’s code, and when it rebooted, it overheated a bit. That’s why the eyes stay black. And because they stay black, they’re bleeding. Not pretty, but not dangerous either.”
“Yeah, not really,” Tony shot back on a little chuckle. With a low groan, he rolled around until he was lying on his back, only one foot still touching Steve. “First time I realized I liked both girls and boys was while watching Saving Private Ryan, and that kinda stuck…”
“Ready to go?” Steve asked, and a messenger bag slung over his shoulder. He sat down on his bike and pointed the second helmet expectantly at Tony.
A long stillness settled between them—Peggy’s eyes now darting from his face to the photograph in his hands. She worried her lower lip between her teeth and made a humming sound.
Whatever comment he’d planned to throw at Steve for generously gracing him with his rare attention faltered at the sight of Steve’s smile. His huge-goddamn smile that lit up his face like a Christmas tree.
And yet, Tony felt all remaining strength slowly draining from him. Why had he ever thought he could do this on his own? Lifting up the blanket, he wrinkled his nose and fought off the rolling nausea that threatened to overcome him. Too little sleep, too little food, too little time.
“I like you…” Tony’s eyes fell shut with the lilt of a particularly deep thrust, a wrangled gasp escaping his throat. “Rough.”
“Charles Spencer,” Tony answered. “His mother walked up to me after the presentation. Showed me this.” He paused. Smiled. “Charlie’s a great kid. Computer engineering degree. 3.6 GPA. Had a floor level gig. An Intel plan for the fall.”
When he finally looked up to meet Tony's eyes, he saw him looking back at him, and had to smile. "So that's what it takes," he said, resting his palm over Tony's belly, fingers tracing along his abs. "To get us to meet, I mean."
Steve’s eyes searched him, and though the Iron Man mask couldn’t give anything away, it still felt as if Steve was trying to read him. “Bruce… was that your idea?”
“As far as I know the last pair is at Fort Meade,” Sam answered, then cleared his throat. “Behind three guarded gates and a 12-inch steel wall.”
“Doesn’t matter,” Steve said. “Tony already said… he said it was just ‘a’ future, not necessarily ours. The Tony from the other time said something similar. That time travel always creates divergences.”
“Whoa,” Tony exclaimed theatrically. “Would you look at that? From Russia With Love finally found their way back to humanity.” As Tony walked by, he dropped a noisy kiss on Steve’s lips, humming appreciatively before sauntering to the coffee machine.
Chuckling, Steve ducked his head a little and let go of Tony in favor of starting to work on his own uniform. "Not sure about ‘human-perfection’, but you're right about the rest." He was already unclasping odds and ends on his own clothes, letting them clatter to the ground where they will. He was going to leave some of it on, but it wouldn't be fair to stay clothed again when all he really wanted was to feel Tony's body against his own.
“Rhodey, he’s… well, the best friend I’ve had in as many years.” Tony took a long sip of wine. “We studied together, and he’s worked for the company for some time before he made a career of his own in the military. He’s eager to make your acquaintance. Everyone is.”
Tony honestly had no damn clue what he was going to do when Steve got back, because… It was laughable, wasn’t it? Completely mad. A part of him was still sure this was a mistake, a joke,
"Yes Sir, Captain Rogers," Bucky retorted from the kitchen chair. He was staring at Steve with an intense expression. Steve felt himself tense a little before pulling out the frozen pizza and set to get it into the oven.
to you. Deliberately. And here you sit, trying to make me feel better about dumping your best friend when he needed me most.”
“That’s the hottest thing that ever happened to me,” he admitted quietly. “And that’s saying something...”
Tony cleared his throat and settled back onto the sofa bed, turning his attention to the ceiling. Next to him, Sam was softly snoring, and everyone else was fast asleep, too.
Steve… well, he looked like shit. At least as much as someone like Steve was able to. Eyes sullen, hair astray, stance hunched, both arms wrapped around his own torso. There was no guilt on his face, of course there wasn’t, but he was looking at Tony’s reflection in the glass with an intense sort of regret.
Bucky sighed, glancing at Natasha. "See, if it were anyone else I'd be calling bullshit. But with this guy..." He shook his head regretfully. The redheaded lady crossed her arms and tapped a forefinger over her bicep, a universal expectation position that had Bucky trail off, then clear his throat.
Because Tony deserved to know how much he affected Steve, how much love Steve had for him and how happy he was that they'd managed to find each other despite the fumbling beginning.
He didn't know how long the doors had been standing open, and didn't bother to check as he hurried for the showers.
She was quiet for a moment, eyeing him curiously. Then, she gave him a thin-lipped smile. “It has its advantages, yes.”
Steve paused, the razor freezing between his fingers, and his eyes flickered to Tony’s reflection in the mirror.
He sighed softly, once again so distracted by his own thoughts, he didn’t notice anything amiss until, suddenly, Natasha stood next to him.
There was a beat of silence, followed by a heavy sigh on Tony’s part. “Please let us talk about this,” he asked, his voice quiet and with a sigh of his own, Steve came to a halt, and turned around where Tony now stood a few meters behind him. “I want to explain.”
Steve’s hands smoothed up his thighs until he had two handfuls of Tony’s ass and he leaned over to kiss his neck. The whiff of his scent, musky and heavy hung in Steve's nose like a drug, and he grabbed the lube from Tony before moving to hastily arrange Tony in a more comfortable position.
you,” Steve spat right into Ultron’s face, trying for distraction. He hadn’t survived as long as he had by being overly cautious. He’d made it by taking calculated risks that brought big pay offs. And right now, he had to keep Ultron busy at all cost. “The man you hate most has all the power you have, access to everything, healing powers, but he also got a healthy human body. Something you will never have.”
Afterwards, they all climbed down the RV and stood side by side, watching the semi-eclipse bouncing light off the pavement before it vanished into the shadows.
Steve found himself frowning at the completely absent-minded expression on his face, but didn’t call him out on it. He had no idea what had happened inside HYDRA’s hideout, but there would be time to ask him later.
Another sigh, this one of resignation. “Right,” he said, flexing his shoulders as he unpacked the sandwich. “Slave driver.”
Tony slumped in his chair, drumming his fingers uneasily on the table edge. But when he spoke, he sounded calm. “It takes time,” he said.
And Ian loved her, too, babbling away excitedly when Natasha asked him questions, calling her ‘Asha’, ‘Asha’, over and over again while he made grabby hands at her. Two-word-sentences still seemed to be it, for now, but Steve was sure that rather sooner or later, he’d really be talking their ears off.
Tony just smiled dopily, and with a surprising amount of dexterity, he managed to put a hand on Steve’s cheek, tracing the line of his jaw with his thumb.
A helpless groan left him at Tony's single word. Steve knew that even if Tony never said he loved him again, it wouldn't matter. It would be things like this that would make it clear enough. He gave a few sharper thrusts, complementing them with nice, tight strokes to Tony's cock. Trust Tony to say the sappiest thing when Steve was doing everything he could to make him lose all control.
“Tony and I will check your implants again tomorrow,” Bruce offered. “It’s… Maybe they’re still sending off signals, but there’s gotta be a way to turn them off for good.”
Tony stopped in mid sentence when he heard someone raise his voice above the loud techno music right next to their table. He and the girl were alone by now, since Rhodey had discreetly retreated to the dancing floor, and the rest of the girls’ friends had obviously gotten the message and scattered to the other sitting areas.
Suddenly, the light went on, the neon lamps blinding them for a moment. All Steve could make out were glaring spots of light; spaced throughout the ceiling, and a sense of space. When his eyes adjusted, Steve saw that they were in a large underground room filled with computers and outdated machinery. Old metal filing cabinets lined each wall. Wires crawled over the floors and walls in organized tracks.
Barnes favored him with a weary glance, before turning his eyes to the contract with undisguised confusion. “Nat signed the same thing?”
Tony closed his eyes, as he pulled up his pants. “I really hate you, Rogers,” he mumbled, then dropped down in the seat, dropping his face into both hands.
All of a sudden, echoes of Extremis started buzzing in his mind. The connection came back online on the next beat and it felt much stronger than it had before Ultron’s attack. Within seconds, it spread all over his body, settling deep inside him along with the endorphins rushing through his blood. The mixture was a constant pressure, cresting, and yet, in the end his climax hit him from nowhere. Without warning, Steve wrapped his fingers around Tony’s hard-on, and only seconds later, Tony cried out and came. And as his muscles contracted around him, Steve groaned and followed. Emptying himself into him, before falling limp in his embrace.
Bucky shrugged like it didn’t bother him all that much, which, as they all knew, was a lie. “I’ll have eyes on you, won’t I?” He glanced at Tony.
“Ten days ago, I was in Washington, minding my own business,” Steve said coolly. “Then I get this call from Natasha who says someone's issued a kill order for James Barnes. And that you were on board with it. I was… I needed to get him out, and you wouldn’t move. You didn’t… I told you he didn’t do it. And I
He turned his hand around, linking his fingers with Steve’s. They both stopped eating at some point, and Steve looked at him with a matching frown on his face.
me, Nick, and you have my word—this was the last damn time I was building something for you, SHIELD, or
Stane had sounded so sure of himself, like there was no way in this world or the next that Tony would ever doubt him.
“Goddammit!” Tony cursed. On his back once again, he just barely managed to roll out of the way and escape another hit. The suit had obviously taken a few bad hits already and Steve had a feeling it wouldn’t withstand that force any longer.
In the last few days, he’d always awoken in Tony’s embrace. Every morning, he’d feel him against him, nude and soft with sleep. Today was no exception.
“I made an interpretation based on my information that most people seem to be attracted to a more forward approach.”
Tony sighed heavily. Honestly, he still had trouble believing that Rhodey had somehow managed to score Carol Danvers. Rhodey was a nerd at heart, just like Tony. He didn’t look the part anymore (somewhere between 14 and 18, Rhodey had left his gangly Steve Urkel-self behind and actually started to muscle up, lose his glasses, and look for all the world like some younger Idris Elba. It was very disturbing.), but he was still every bit a science geek when it came down to it. How a girl like Carol, who wasn’t
, and that’s… I tried to mess it up. Tried last night—wanted you to hate me a little. So yeah, I took a low blow with that kiss. It’s not cool to do that to a guy, I know…” He sighed angrily. “Fuck, I’m all wrong.”
Tony snorted, shaking his head. While FRIDAY was based on the same programming that had been JARVIS’s core, it just wasn’t the same. JARVIS had… understood him. He might not have agreed with Tony’s decisions most of the time, but he’d always known what Tony needed to hear.
"I just told you, I do trust you," Steve said quietly, then watched Tony retrieve the bottles. He sprang into action, helping Tony get soaped up as well. Just because Tony wanted to take his time in bed didn't mean they had to take their time in the shower as well. They'd already spent so much time skirting around the issue, anyway.
He had no idea why Natasha had suddenly decided that this was the best time to bring them back together. Either she knew something he didn’t, or… or she had sensed that Tony had reached his breaking point.
They were sitting on a large log next to their fireplace. Tony was busy fiddling with his tools and a piece of wood, while Steve just sat there, gazing into the strange yellow sky.
“This will be all kinds of horrible, I hope you’re aware. I look like a very handsome, blond truck ran me over, and they will not let me live that down easily.”
“—that James decided to join the party,” Natasha continued, sending Steve a sweet smile, and Tony found himself sighing in relief. There were moments when he really,
. He almost yelled for JARVIS to tell whoever was calling to go fuck himself and then remembered: The Congress was meeting today. Shit, he was supposed to be back in DC by noon.
“Stop at the lab,” Tony said before he’d even made the conscious decision to speak up. He couldn’t just leave like this, no matter how chaotic things had gotten in those last weeks. Rhodey he could call, sure, and he’d already invited Bruce to meet him at his lab in New York next week, but Steve…
Natasha raised both brows in a manner that said she hadn’t expected that answer. And maybe that it was the good kind of surprise. She shared a look with Bucky, who cast her a warm smile in return, and Steve had to bite his lower lip so he wouldn’t comment on that.
you, Steve.” Tony sighed, rubbing a hand over his forehead as he raised himself to his elbows. He looked positively ravaged, pants tented, hair a mess, lips kiss-swollen—and Steve had to look at the ceiling to not do something stupid like try to convince Tony that having sex right now was a
“Tony,” Bruce called with his typical hushed composure. “I have a really bad idea.” A beat when that merited no reaction other than deepened stares. “But I think it might work.”
Now, he was alone, and he felt it with every fibre of his being. There was no one there to share all of this weight with. No one.
Pepper put the fork in her hand back on her plate and leaned forward, turning her full attention on Tony. “Alright. A ball, then. But if we do this we have to invite all of our business associates and acquaintances, too, I hope you’re aware of that.”
Steve could sympathize. He’d really thought Bucky was out of the woods, too, that it was finally over and that he’d regained control over his mind.
At the end of the line, however, Steve was suddenly confronted with a pair of cold, unblinking eyes that drew his attention. They belonged to another elderly man, one with a bald head and a stone façade of prestige and self-importance. He held a long cane in one hand, with a black shaft and silver ornaments decorating its handle. There was some kind of orb on its top and Steve noticed him rotating it back and forth as he regarded him. While he held the cane firmly at his side, it didn’t look like the man depended on it as a walking stick.
Wilson was still looking at them expectantly, so Tony cleared his throat, straightening up a bit. There was no way he’d walk into that room, looking as he did now, without everyone knowing exactly what they’d been up to, so he might as well use that resilience as a direct counterpoint. He ignored the slightly wobbly feeling in his knees and set himself in motion. With a snarky, rebellious smirk, he took that first step towards the exit and cast Steve a pointed look over his shoulder. “You heard the man,
Wanda and Pietro were still standing side by side next to the cradle, looking down at it thoughtfully. Wanda had that determined, troubled look on her face, but she seemed otherwise calm. The two talked quietly from time to time, their words foreign to Steve’s ears, casting short glances at the team. They didn’t look exactly guilty, but there was regret on their faces, and Steve decided that it would be enough for now.
“Don’t let him shut you out,” she told him. “I know it can get rather isolating out here and Tony often travels to town to attend conferences. Or he used to, before he let Obadiah take over for him. But please don’t let him draw back again.”
Tony brushed a hand over his chin, as if only now remembering that he didn’t exactly look like he usually did. “Right.”
TS 0:13 A.M.>OK, you’re excused. A slime monster in Beijing, though. Really? That’s not remotely original
He had all but accepted the fact that he might never talk to his best friend again. And now this. A road trip. In a RV. A ridiculously large and luxurious RV, sure (this was the Stark family, after all), but a RV nevertheless. He and Tony would spend every waking hour together, cook together, visit cities together, hell, they would probably sleep in the same room.
Because even though God had cast Tony out of Heaven, He’d also made him the brightest of His angels.
This chapter is a bit shorter than my usual (I aim for 5000-7000 on average), but I hope you can all forgive that since I updated on schedule! :) Infinite thanks to h34rt1lly for dealing with how neurotic writing this chapter made me feel. Chapter title taken from a lyric in the song "Your Way With Words Is Through Silence" by A Day to Remember.
“No, you are right. I do not wear sparkles or glamour. Why not do it? It is only one night, after all.”
Bruce stepped in front of him, putting a hand on Peter’s shoulder as he shook his head. “I don’t think you understand how proud of you I am for this work. The things you’ve created here with just a framework program I had in place… Peter, it’s incredible. If you keep working, you’ll be able to design this from the ground up yourself.”
“Wanda, I thought you were just grabbing your—” Natasha’s voice died in her throat as she appeared at Wanda’s shoulder, the tension palpable.
“No, Natasha,” he seethed, “they were more than that. Wanda, they were accidents! I don’t know what it will take to make you understand that you are not a weapon. You are more than some ticking time bomb, sister, and you are capable of more than destruction. This isn’t how I wanted you to hear this, but fine, at least you’re listening to me. Dr. Banner and Peter have been developing something for you, consulting Clint and I all along the way. I know you’re scared— scared of what’s happened, scared of yourself. But you cannot live your life in fear. You will never move on if all you do is hide from something you cannot control. It will only get worse, and you will become more deadly than you have ever been. Someone will prey upon your fear, your unpredictable power, and what then? They have found a way for you to practice without ever interacting with another person. There’s no one to hurt. Please, just listen to them talk about their bots and you’ll understand what—”
The waves were still crashing against the shore. And somewhere, Indries’ boat was being lifted to the surface and there was a body inside it.
He said it so simply. As though it meant nothing. Tony had known it by now, of course. And yet, hearing the words spoken aloud gave him some blissful kind of liberation. It filled his insides with warmth that he had feared lost to him forever.
Wanda hummed. “He is trying,” she said and just as her words left her lips, Ultron’s body began to twitch and shake, as if he’d lost control over his own limbs. Bucky was struggling, and in the next second, Ultron’s hands lost their grip and he was falling rapidly through the cloudy sky.
Tony ground his own middle against Steve’s, his hand favoring him with a good squeeze. Steve gasped lightly, his chest rising and falling in shaky motions. Slowly, Tony leaned forward, his fist sliding up and down Steve’s length. He paused for a moment, savoring this, before he bowed down, licking Steve from balls to tip and sucking his length into his mouth. His lips brushed just slightly along him, his mouth caressing him with tenderness. Eventually, he was bobbing his head with slow leisure. His fingers gently massaged the base of Steve’s erection as his mouth trailed the length of him back and forth.
Watching him go, Tony let himself drop back on the bed. Here he was—back in 2015. And if this didn’t work out, the whole changing-your-future thing, he at least had a few more months before he had to fight against Steve all over again.
Steve grinned and brushed past Tony, tugging at his hand and pulling him along. “Come on. They’re selling tickets in the gift-shop.”
“Well, he decides he’ll be spending half a week in the lab, and that’s exactly what he does. Which leaves you sitting here, waiting for him. Would he even come up here if you asked him? Right now?”
, was smearing some oily fluid that was leaking out of his chest plate with the back of his gauntlet. Sam had apparently also hit his cooling system. Lovely.
“But… why?” he heard himself asking. His voice was loud and brash, something he’d always tried to swallow down whenever talking with his boss, but today, he just couldn’t.
Turning to look around his own familiar room, Steve shrugged, then looked back to Tony with a small, wary smile.
A trembling breath squeezed through Steve’s lips as Tony pulled his own t-shirt off of himself. Instantly, he lowered his hands to the skin Tony had revealed. He was aware that Tony was watching him closely, but didn’t care. His eyes were fixated on his chest—his chest that he could touch freely now.
The assurance obviously did not convince Steve, his hand still at his hip, a frown marring his brow as he looked up. “That’s gonna bruise. I held you too hard, I was—”
The truth was that Tony had killed his wife, Steve thought miserably. The why’s and how’s wouldn’t matter to those people. Tony had killed her, and that was it. It wouldn’t matter to them that Indries had done everything in her power to push Tony into doing the unthinkable. And it wouldn’t matter that Stane only did what he did to get the company under his control, and use Tony’s inventions in any way he saw fit.
“Hell if I know.” he said. “Why don’t you go ask him? Preferably before he wakes up the entire tower.”
He’d deal with it, obviously. It wasn’t as if he’d ever had any hope of sparking Steve’s interest. That was a ridiculous thought. But seeing the reminder of his marital happiness still felt like a punch to the gut every damn time.
After a while, the halls of Stark Mansion slowly became familiar. However, the distance Tony kept between them was only growing with time. Steve still cherished whatever moments he had with him, but they often left him emotionally drained.
Steve smiled indulgently and stepped closer, pulling Tony into a hug and kissing his forehead. “At least we can be sure he’ll learn from the best.”
Steve simply stared, searching Tony’s eyes for whatever he wanted to tell him. “What do you mean? What didn’t you know?”
“Sirs,” JARVIS chimed in as they made their way through the living room. “May I give my sincerest congratulations?”
“I haven’t,” Tony said, huffing. The hand on his shoulder moved a little, brushing a thumb along Steve’s neck. “But you’re my other half. I can be honest around you. Took me a while, but… I’ve learned not to give you any bullshit. Not about the important stuff, anyway.” He smiled, soft and sweet and so unlike Tony that Steve couldn’t help but wonder what else he’d missed in all the time he’d known him. “What’d be the point?” Tony went on. “Since we got married… I… Whenever I think about where I might be in five—or ten years from now, I think about you first, and that’s… amazing. And something like that… it’s too damn important to chance it.”
“Peter. It’s fine.” Tony pointed at Steve, whose mouth was already half-open, and shook his finger. “Remember, lecturing disabled. Enjoy yourself, old man.”
“At the risk of you trying to play dress up Barbie with me before I get a chance to get out of the car, yes, I’ll gladly go with them,” she sighed before following Clint to the car.
Before Bucky’s scowl could morph into whatever rebuttal he was about to throw back, something black flew past Tony’s face. He didn’t have time to blink before a familiar metal arm snatched whatever foreign object out of the air. Steve, now fully clothed and looking rather smug, leaned against the door frame. A simple cerulean button up, left open at the collar, paired with gray slacks and a pair of Doc Marten loafers. At least he didn’t leave room to be lectured.
“She hasn’t left her room in three days, Sam. Pietro’s sleeping in the hallway outside her door. All I hear is her sobs and I just,” Natasha had to stop speaking to take a breath, wiping her eyes to ward off the tears that threatened to spill over. “Someone needs to save her, Sam, because she won’t save herself.”
“She cannot hide from herself forever!” Pietro roared. “If we just keep relying on time to get her to heal, we will go nowhere. Lagos and Sokovia were—”
Now Natasha was really laughing, joining the hysterics Barnes had stirred up as Tony continued to look between them.
The elevator pinged, entirely unnecessarily with Steve’s eyes glued to it in his time-oriented distress, in time for Bucky and Tony to clink glasses as a toast to the beginning of a party or disaster. Pietro and Sam stepped out first, arm in arm, with Clint trailing close behind.
“At least you’ll ‘blend in’ with all the other dads!” Nat tossed over her shoulder as she disappeared into Clint’s room.
“Now I have to try twice as hard to compete with you,” Natasha joked as she picked up a few dresses. “I’ll be right back.”
Peter was wide-eyed as he looked through the glass of the observation room, studying the bots that he had been assisting Bruce with as they sparred with Bucky. Bruce’s eyes were fixed on the patterns, noting the timing, the degree of indentation when they were met with a vibranium fist (they weren’t supposed to be indestructible anyway), and other necessary maintenance or upkeep aspects that needed to be factored into their cycle planning.
“Well, to answer your question,” Tony said sarcastically as he picked up a pair of black jeans off of the rack before giving the tattooed-man a thumbs up, “Elijah here will show you what he’s picked out. He has some combinations that you can take as is, or mix and match— try not to stress him out, that’s my job.”
“That was Barnes, not me!” Clint countered, picking up Sam’s drink and walking off with it. “I swear, you will never see the payback coming, Wilson.”
“At,” he paused, groaning before continuing, “2:41am? I take it this cannot wait until a reasonable hour?”
Pietro was now clad in grey jeans and a wine-colored velvet blazer, paired with a crisp stone grey button down that Elijah insisted he leave open at the collar.
Hello all! Summer has been kind to me and allowed me to make up for my long absence. I'm back with another chapter! Thank you to h34rt1lly for being my beta in record time.
Reference to Alexi: In one of the comic runs, Natasha is briefly married to a KGB spy by the name of Alexi Shostakov, aka Red Guardian.
“It feels good, no?” Wanda commented, a faraway look on her face. “Another milestone down— and now you can do whatever you want.”
“I don’t know,” Steve said truthfully, though he remembered a green light coming for him, which would mean…
A smile rose to Tony’s lips then, as he ran his fingers along Steve’s chest. He could feel love settle within every nerve of his body, as though he and Steve lived under the same skin. As though a broken part of him was finally righted, and Steve had all along been the one person who could make him whole.
He wasn't worried about admitting he loved Tony, but he felt a little like pulling him by the nose about it. And besides, it'd been pretty obvious for some time now. The admission only made it sweeter.
“We might be the first humans who’ve ever seen these,” Steve said at some point, because he just couldn’t stand the silence anymore. He glanced at Tony. “Isn’t that crazy?”
“You said we could work on the Accords,” Steve said, sounding hopeful. “Make compromises. Is it too late to negotiate? I told you I’ve read the draft, it’s… you did a good job with it.”
Of course, Steve never mentioned his dreams to anyone. The men and women he went on stage with were nice enough lads, but Steve wouldn’t know what to tell them, anyway. The dreams, strange as they were, were his. Completely his. And he wasn’t in the mood to share.
“You should be,” Tony whispered. “You’re so young, Steve… You should be free to experience new things every day. See new cities, meet new people. Not be confined to a house and its long-lost ghosts.”
Lifting his gaze again, Steve realized Tony was staring at him intently. And there was something in his eyes that gave Steve pause. A flare of insecurity. Uncertainty. Doubt. “We’re gonna get through this together, aren’t we?” Tony asked quietly.
Tony scoffed. “Okay, you know what? That’s enough therapy for one day. Steve’s a big boy, and so am I. We survived so far.”
“It is!” He sat up again and swirled his cup of coffee around, probably looking like a five-year old about to throw a tantrum. “These past months have been horrible. All I want to do is be in my big empty penthouse, lie in my big empty bed and wallow in self-pity. It’s a wonder I even made it to the meeting.”
Tony sighed again, and Steve knew he really wanted to talk about this, knew there was more he hadn’t said yet, but it never seemed to be the right time.
, no matter how painstakingly clear the evidence had been at times, Steve had somehow always found a way to pass it all as jokes, delusions—or just strange coincidences.
Steve gasped at the pain—at the pleasure—, he couldn’t even be sure, completely out of his mind with the feelings.
Tony knew that the first month of any new adjustment was supposed to be the hardest, and in many aspects, it had been.
It was strange. Thinking about Steve. Thinking about him in this completely different light. It wasn’t even so much a different light but a—
He cupped Steve’s face, leaning in a little, as always leaving it to him if he wanted to kiss right after. But Steve only smiled and tugged him in, no reservation whatsoever as Tony opened his mouth to deepen the kiss.
Tony snorted, perfectly aware that she was making fun of him and his drug-addled brain. Finishing with the gel, she pulled a pad of white fabric from her med kit and started taping it over his wound. “Bruce did a very good job with pulling the blade out,” she said as she worked. “You’re very lucky he was around.”
Tony rolled his eyes, and sighed. It was a useless debate; one he and Steve had entertained several times before. And Sam clearly was thinking very much alike his best friend. “Sorry to burst your bubble, but that’s just… oh, what’s the word… bullshit. You still don’t get what’s going on here.”
Tony sighed, opening the blueprints of Mark Forty-Three. Building something always distracted him from whatever was weighing heavily on his mind and so he set out to make improvements on the suit’s chest-plate, first.
Back then, Steve hadn’t realized how significant it had been that Tony had told him all that. Only later, when he had asked Rhodey if he could show him a photo of Jarvis, he’d realized that Tony had
Tony said something, and Steve's mind raced to catch up. "Yeah..." he said when he realized what Tony was asking. This was okay. Weird, but not bad. It wasn't good, really, but his nerve endings, confused and stimulated, were tingling with a need for more input.
you?” Tony repeated on a frown. “I… Come on, we both know that’s not what this is about. You realize I’m in my mid-forties now, right? You haven’t aged a day. Let’s be realistic here.”
“Wanda,” Vision called, his tone deeply worried. He had stepped into the foyer that led out of the living room but immediately stopped in his tracks when she waved him off. Vision’s eyes longingly followed her until she walked around the next corner.
Yeah, Tony had figured as much. It was what he wanted to do as well. To hide and just… not think about what had happened. Because at the end of the day, it was too much for one human mind to handle.
“Long time since I got to see you with one of those,” Steve mused, nodded at the tablet, and quietly closed the bedroom door behind him.
“There was this… terrible noise…” the robot went on, shuffling forward as the cables hanging out of the broken suit swung back and forth at its sides. There were tears in the alloy and dozens of holes in the metal casing, making the suit’s oils and coolants leak onto the floor. The helmet was broken and skewed in a way that had its features look as if it was grinning. “I was tangled in… in…” It cocked its head, as if only now finding the fitting word describing his jumbled thoughts. “
Another thick silence filled the air between them. Then, Rhodey relented. “She was… enigmatic. Charismatic. She certainly was beautiful,” he told Steve quietly. “I can’t even tell you what it was, exactly, but there was something about her drawing you right in. Everyone I know was fascinated with her. She just had a way of making you admire her, you know?”
His eyes had been sealed shut for days. When people came into the room, he heard them but didn’t watch. He knew the voices all belonged to Steve’s team, and was able to identify each of them without much struggle. Sometimes it would take a few minutes to drag the face matching the voice out of his exhausted mind, but in the end, he remembered.
“That’s not why you’re here and you know it,” Steve replied. Hell, they were really walking on eggshells. One wrong step and their fragile truce would shatter to pieces.
Carol huffed. “Who here didn’t see that coming?” She turned to Rhodes and shrugged with a smile. “Guess that leaves us to the king bed.”
That brought a tight-lipped smile to Tony’s face. “Which is a completely foreign concept to you, isn’t it?” he asked, his voice far more venomous than it should be, because Steve had at least
Unexpectedly, Peggy stirred at the sound of his voice. Slowly, she opened her still beautiful blue eyes and reached for his hand. She didn’t make a sound, and Steve watched as her mouth fell open, mimicking the shape of the words he spoke.
It was a lie, Tony knew that. The truth was, he was tired of constantly being reminded that he was partly responsible for tearing so many people apart. Friends. Lovers. He knew Vision and Wanda had been onto something, and it might’ve taken a while before ever-so-polite Vision would’ve made a move, but now, there was no chance for them whatsoever.
. His mouth hadn’t moved much, by any means, but the way he’d touched Tony—the way his lips had molded against Tony’s—it had been so much more than Tony ever had experienced from a mere kiss.
He grabbed Steve’s left arm and twisted it behind his back, spinning him up and around so that he faced Rumlow. Once in that ironclad grip, even Steve had a hard time escaping it, and in the second it took him to take stance, Rumlow had opened up his chestplate, revealing a—
Steve was terribly confused and had no idea how to react to that. He might have been giving off mixed signals, he knew that, but so had Tony.
"If that were the effect of the thing, we would've been in trouble by now," Steve said. He watched Tony take a seat beside him, even as Bruce stood back, and then asked the next, obvious question. "Any results on the tests, Dr. Banner?"
Something inside Steve’s desperate gaze shifted then. The despair slowly leaked out of his eyes, and was replaced with something that warmed Tony from the inside.
Peggy rolled her eyes at that, and ran a hand through her white hair. “Oh I almost forgot,” she said, and Steve could
Steve visibly swallowed as he took in the shield, its new paint-job—blue and red and very shiny. New and untainted.
Steve hummed, surprised that he could almost imagine it to be true. The idea of having Tony at his side throughout it all was… strangely comforting.
“There’s something we need to talk about.” With that, Tony sat up, and with a little prompting, Steve let him go, rolling on his back instead. Tony mourned the lost closeness immediately, but stood up nevertheless.
“What?” Steve asked, staring down at him. “Don’t be stupid.” As he ran, he made a vague gesture at Natasha, and Tony saw her talking to someone on the phone.
Steve could practically see as panic began to take a stranglehold on Tony’s throat, and he knew he did his best not to break down.
When there were hands on Tony’s shoulder about two seconds later, he startled a bit, only relaxing when he noticed the red nail polish. “You gonna gloat now?” he asked after a moment.
Bucky was looking at him with a strange expression. He’d just picked up another log, raising his axe to split it in half. “So, when are we doing this?”
Tony nodded his head politely. “Thanks, I had a… good time here. I appreciated the freedom to work on my own projects. And Dr. Banner was a huge help from the start. You should really give him a raise.”
-here, obviously. This isn’t exactly cozy, and we could still sort-of-die down here, but... I’m just not sure we would be here if it hadn’t been for Natasha and her little bar-setup, I tend to be blind towards things that might be good for me, and I’m just… glad we got that chance.”
“Yeah,” Tony agreed. “Kinda figured that one’s a pick and choose type of thing. Selective respect, you know? Wouldn’t want to be
Tony went into motion then, opening the kit and taking out some wipes. “Everything alright?” he asked conversationally.
Steve only rolled his eyes. The look on his face was a mix of irritation and frustration and ‘Not the point, Tony’.
That didn’t seem to help. Coulson brushed passed Maria without tossing her a second glance and slammed what looked to be a SHIELD file on the desk in front of Tony.
to. Actually, what he wanted to do was to put Ian down in one of the sterile-looking cribs and let him cry himself out. The sound of his wails was slowly but steadily driving him crazy.
The room was buzzing with chatter and laughter, and Steve simply let himself revel in it for once. At some point Maria sat down at the table across from Steve, raising her glass at him. “Really, congratulations to the both of you,” she said. “Pepper told me it hasn’t been easy.”
“Oh! That’s why you...” Steve stopped abruptly before betraying the fact that he had been awake when Tony had touched him earlier. “I heal fast. You know that.”
Natasha sighed. “I’m here because this is where I’m needed. I’m not on your side on this. And I’m not on Steve’s.”
“Soon,” he shot back, wiggling his brows in mock-question. “Only you would call this ‘soon’...” He huffed, moving one hand off of Steve’s thigh, moving it towards his groin and rubbing the bulge there. “You can think all you want but I kinda got lube and condoms covered the day after you and Barnes stormed my lab.” He grinned mischievously, pointing towards where he hoped his messenger bag was still leaning against the nightstand. “Front pocket.”
Sam stayed with Tony for the time being, letting him have a last look at his wings, before teaming up with the others later. His main job was to distract the Helicarriers’ Phalanx guns on deck and, well… not get killed in the process.
A long moan ripped through the air, when Tony shoved his mouth so deep onto Steve’s cock that Steve felt his head brushing the back of Tony’s throat. Steve’s hands trembled with a combination of self-loathing and arousal. His hands were on Tony’s shoulders—he could’ve stopped this moments ago. Tony’s body was muscled enough, but they both knew he wouldn’t stand a chance against Steve’s strength. And yet… this wasn't something he’d felt before. Nothing even close to this. Tony was swirling his tongue around him, before pushing his mouth so far down on him as it would go. A hand had busied itself with Steve’s testicles and it was damn hard to form a decent thought.
Tony blinked twice at the name before allowing a small smile to cross his lips. A hand found Steve’s face, and Tony pulled him closer, pressing a soft kiss against his lips. “Sorry.”
Somehow, sleep seemed to be far away now. He just wanted to lie there, drowsy and content in spite of what had just happened.
“Yes.” Rhodey smiled. “He’s apparently very worried about you. And guilty. The guy looked like a kicked puppy down there. What happened?”
He had a feeling he was slowly getting the hang of it, even the internet, but he still felt too slow, and most of what came out of people’s mouth was way over his head.
Steve smiled at him, a giddy feeling rushing through every single vein of his body. “So we’re doing this?”
For a few weeks, Steve had to share a bed with Bucky. It was in that hazy period following the death of his mother—the death that had rendered him an orphan. In the rush of those cold, lonely days, he had shared a bed with Bucky at least a dozen times. Bucky had often shoved at him, kicked him, and hogged the blankets.
Clearly, Tony wasn't happy about having to wait, and Steve's resolve was starting to wear thin, too. How awful could it be to just let Tony into his bed and enjoy what he so obviously wanted? They were both interested, both capable of consenting. What was the problem again?
to know this couldn’t be right. We have dozens of enemies who can hack into SHIELD’s database without breaking a sweat, you
Tony snorted, then laughed; he just couldn’t help himself. Usually, Steve was able to hold back his release as long as he wanted. He always, stubbornly, made sure Tony came first, without—seemingly—any strain whatsoever.
Steve opened his mouth, but no words were forthcoming. On a second thought, Tony made to crawl into the hospital bed, and cautiously laid his head on Steve’s chest. Steve shifted a bit, stroking Tony’s hair and kissing his forehead a few times. “Thank you,” he said eventually, his voice very soft.
Ian was wrapped snugly in a blue cotton blanket. Tony walked closer, smiling when the first ‘happy birthdays’ and awed noises arose. He held the baby close, patting its tiny back, and Steve felt a sudden rush of pure love move through him.
“Hey, man,” Steve said in a manner that was entirely too casual for anything he could begin to relate to present circumstances. He pursed his lips and looked up at Sam with an apologetic expression. “I know this is, uhm, a lot to take in, but… we need a place to lay low for a few hours.”
Bucky cleared his throat. “That’s nice. Really. But can we please get back to something that might be potentially relevant to everyone here and not your daytime drama that is—don’t get me wrong—not all that entertaining.”
“Hey!” Bucky called, now reaching over as well. Ian squealed at the attention, and Steve’s heart did a little jump when he reached for one of Bucky’s metal fingers without an ounce of fear. “That’s right. Who’s your favorite uncle?” Bucky cooed.
Steve really didn’t want to think more about what had happened last night, but he couldn’t forget it either. Tony was there, and dream or not, it was definitely the same Tony he’d kissed only hours ago.
He sat with Tony for hours, patting his head, and stroking his hair, before he eventually made his way back outside.
Steve hadn’t exactly expected to be welcomed with open arms. He had known that being around Tony would be a mild steppingstone, at best. But it still came as a surprise as to how many things could actually go wrong in a single day.
He reached out, and rested his hand on Tony’s shoulder, just for a moment, before sliding it forward. Tony closed his eyes and savored the sensation of Steve’s palm sliding against his. But then Steve pulled it away, and lightly—God, so lightly he could barely feel it—he traced a finger back and forth along Tony’s collarbone.
Jarvis smiled. “You could, but Master Anthony is still working. So you might as well join me on my morning walk through the house, if you’d like.”
Steve grabbed for a pack of first aid compresses from his utility belt, and pushed it against the wound. Meanwhile, he could hear Sam and Bucky walking through the lab behind his back, opening drawers and cupboards with hectic movements.
“I didn’t think you’d come,” Tony said. His tone wasn’t loud, nor was it accusatory; but it surprised Steve nonetheless. Did he really think that? How could he not have expected him to come after what had happened tonight?
“Traitor,” Tony accused the baby. “I told you not to learn new things when I’m not around. Your first word will either be ‘Daddy’ or ‘Mechanical Engineering’. How does that sound, poppet?” He waited, then looked at Steve conspiratorially. “He’s not talking yet, but he loves the idea.”
Tony closed his eyes briefly. Now that he was looking for it, Extremis could feel the new presence surrounding every known space in his head. It was not unlike communicating with JARVIS usually felt like—a steady omnipresence buzzing at the edges of his mind—but this was bigger, and… it was growing,
He pressed his face into Tony’s neck, breathing him in, before—ever so lightly—he started kissing his skin. He nibbled at his earlobe with his teeth, then continued kissing his way all across Tony’s throat. His hand crossed his belly and pushed the sides of his jacket away so that he could reach his belt.
A sharp sound left Steve at that, a combination of surprise and laughter and pain. He blinked a few times, to make sure Tony wouldn't see how close he was to tears. It felt at once completely ridiculous, the two of them sitting on the floor and crying over memories from past lives, but at the same time absolutely heartrending.
Fighting the urge to simply stand up and leave the corridor, Tony pushed his face into his waiting hands. He could feel his heart beat against his ribcage, could feel an intense buzzing taking home in his head, drowning out every other sound.
He kept the gut-wrenching parts to himself—the people they couldn’t save, the lives they’d left behind—but he saw it in Tony’s eyes that he understood anyway.
There were short tries when he raised himself on his feet with a hand on the reading chair. He didn’t quite walk yet, but Tony knew it wouldn’t be long.
Steve’s circling fingers were gaining speed, and of their own volition, Tony’s legs drifted apart, his clothed feet sliding soundlessly on the stone floor. The answering chuckle in his ear just flared the fire in his groin, and the next sound to escape Tony’s parted lips was undeniably more of a moan. Steve’s fingernails were lightly scratching the sensitive skin of his dick, his touches remained soft, and Tony felt himself going mad from the building tension. Part of him wanted to smack him and tell him to get on with the show, while the rest of him thought he might just orgasm from this alone.
They were standing side by side next to a table in front of the RV, and chopped vegetables. It felt like a lifetime ago, them sharing a beer, talking about everything and nothing. Just them and this blissful togetherness… and without all this baggage they had now.
She didn’t struggle, instead falling to her knees. “I needed to know,” she gasped, staring down at Tony.
“Of course I thought about that,” Tony said. “Even suggested it to her. Offered her money. She laughed right at me. Said she’d make it the scandal of the century. She’d tell the most horrid things about me, make up various perversions, tell I beat her, used her, raped her. She said she’d ruin not only me but my entire family. Pepper, Rhodey. Everyone. I couldn’t do that. So I made a deal with her. We’d handle our marriage as a business contract. Be the perfect couple in public. Stay out of each other’s space otherwise.” A pause. “At first, she played the game brilliantly. But after a while, she began to grow careless and in the months that followed… she drained me of everything. She couldn’t just do as she pleased, she wanted me to suffer. She threw one party after the other, fucking whoever made eyes at her. So I drowned my pain in booze and… I don’t really know what sent me over.” He brushed both hands through his hair as if he was ready to tear it out. “Do you really want to hear this?”
“And I love you. As long as that is still true, we can work out everything else, easy as that.” A gentle smile crossed his face. “Life doesn’t give you second chances without reason. We’re probably on our sixth by now, that’s gotta count for something. And don’t doubt for a second that you’re making me happy, because you do. Every single day.”
“I’ll work on something,” Tony promised. Ross thought he was very clever with his supervision nonsense, but it wouldn’t be much of a problem to outsmart him. "You can see him and talk to him every day. And you’ll be back with us before you know it.”
With whatever strength he had left, he was able to drag his eyes up to Tony’s, though they were half closed, and his chest was heaving with the promise of a volatile orgasm. He smiled at him, his hair wrecked from Steve’s fingers and his eyes dark and glassy. Suddenly, his back arched away from the bed, his muscles clamped around his cock and his mouth opened in a silent cry.
“Not recently.” Steve sighed. “She got worse, and then we were too busy with…” He trailed off, looking at the ground, as he pulled back eventually.
At that moment, Bruce entered the floor via the stairs. He’d been the only one aside Natasha who hadn’t been called in for the mission. He rubbed his sleep-mussed hair and looked only mildly surprised when he saw all of them standing around in full uniform. “What are you doing back so early?” He looked around, frowning. “And where’s Thor?”
The door swung open before Steve could really think of what he'd say when he saw the people inside the room, but the guy who stepped out—tall, robust and scowling heavily—didn't even spare one glance in his direction, not even a hum of acknowledgement, before storming off.
. And I saw you wearing it today when we left. Your hair’s different, your gear isn’t updated and your uniform: It
Right now, he could move on from that. Sort of. He wasn’t so sure he would be able to for much longer, though.
There was an expression on Bruce’s face that Tony—hands down—had never seen before, not in all those years they had worked together now. “Let’s, uh, just change the sequences, then you can re-upload the software. I… Good job, Tony.”
“I set you up with a thousand dates, a thousand,” Bucky yelled. “And you never even cared to tell me I should be finding a fella for you? Are you kidding me?!”
“Not yet,” Tony said, then snorted when he saw Steve’s disapproving expression. “I will—in a bit. The 2018-Avengers have just arrived in Latveria. Reed is already tracking their movements. And that means we gotta prepare everything from our end.”
When King T’Chaka of Wakanda took stance at the podium, Steve had definitely lost track of time. He had been so deep in thought that he hadn’t even noticed Tony sitting back down next to him.
Tony pointedly didn’t rush at Steve, and Steve didn’t try to fight him either. Which was good. As long as Ross had his team watching his every move, there was no way to talk to him.
A whimper of repressed longing scratched at Tony’s throat, and he hooked one arm around Steve’s neck the next moment, leaping into the kiss with everything he had. Exploring Steve’s mouth with liberation that seemed too long coming. One of Steve’s arms wrapped around his waist to haul Tony into him, and Tony felt his warm breath on him, his heart beating against his chest and all those other things he had so long waited for.
—but that was just how Steve was; he was always close, and always a bit handsy with the people he liked.
Prep was good and well, not that he didn’t enjoy it, but they’d been doing this for years, very regularly, and letting Steve stretch him on his cock was one of the simpler pleasures. This was as much about love as it was about reassurance. And for that, Tony didn’t want to wait any longer.
He had to pretend there was something in his eyes when she said that. If she knew the effect those words had on him these days, she didn’t show it.
The day passed, and the next as well. A week later, Tony felt himself sinking into an endless tedium of moping, and everything, even his courses, only seemed to remind him why he now officially hated Steve.
So this was apparently happening now. For a moment, he was a bit unsure about what he should be doing with his hands, if it was truly alright to touch Tony like he wanted to.
“Tony,” Steve prompted, stopping in his tracks and grabbing for Tony’s hand so he’d come to a halt, too.
Spider-Man didn’t hesitate. He jumped over Tony’s back and was on his feet just in time to send the newly shrunken Ant-Man into the wall again.
“Don’t move, lemme do the work.” Sliding his fingers out of his hole eventually, Steve angled Tony backward a bit, letting his hand take the weight of his thigh. His cock slipped between Tony’s legs, bumping into the space from behind, and he could feel the clenching and contracting of his leg muscles, shudders rippling through him.
Tony laughed. Steve was a precious human being sometimes, he really was. “What, sex-pollen not made it to your ‘to-read list’, yet? It’s a thing. You should google it. Probably with parental control on, though let’s be clear: I’m not volunteering.”
“I’m aware of that, thank you,” Tony said, grinning deviously. “To be completely honest with you, I’ve never liked to stick to the rules and Stark Mansion follows mine, anyway. If I want to kiss you, for example… it’s solely my decision.” He paused, smiling as he sipped his coffee. “Well, and yours, of course.”
“Yes, I do,” Tony replied. “Ian needs both his parents. And I got to deal with the UN, get that sentence off of their heads, or everything will blow in our faces. Still, someone has to make sure Ian has food, and clothes, and gets his nighttime story, and his afternoon walk and…”
“Yeah, didn’t know the CIA was rolling in this kind of money,” Tony eventually answered. He grabbed a glass of champagne and a soda from a circulating waitress and handed the champagne to Steve. “Did I tell you how ravishing you look tonight?” he asked before Steve could do something like tell him how he would’ve been okay with a soda as well. He really wasn’t in the mood to be reminded of his alcohol abstinence. He just wanted this evening to be as normal and uneventful as possible.
