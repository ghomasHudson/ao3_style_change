Gwen smiled as she popped a piece of popcorn into her mouth. "You don't have to thank me, Peter. Just so long as you don't try to hide stuff from me."
Steve squeezed his eyes closed, breathing in the glorious scent of Tony's hair as he struggled to come up with a plausible excuse, and found nothing.
But Peter only shook his head, his eyes so filled with self-loathing that Tony's breath caught. "But‚Äîbut, I
But here, Steve could only guess what the team would potentially be up against. There was little doubt in his mind that when the Chitauri did return, they would do so in far greater numbers, and with the power of potentially multiple infinity gems spurring them on, Steve had no way of knowing just how powerful they might be.
The time had finally come.
"No, no, that's okay." Steve squeezed his eyes closed, pressing his palm to his chest. Peter was okay. He was safe at home, sleeping in his bed. "Just‚Ä¶ please tell him that I love him once he wakes up in the morning. And that I'll see him soon."
"He's gonna be fine," Steve said firmly. Grunting, he tucked Tony to his chest and got to his feet, frantically glancing around for T'Challa. They had learned on their very first trip to Wakanda that their medicine was very advanced, so if he could just get Tony inside somewhere, then‚Äîthen‚Äî
"All right. Entering the quantum tunnel in five‚Ä¶ four‚Ä¶ three‚Ä¶ two‚Ä¶ one‚Ä¶ mark!"

I can‚Äôt wait to see what you think!  Please don‚Äôt forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment!  üíï
"I'm not," Steve whispered. He wound his arms around Tony's waist, his blue eyes sweeping across his face. "I just‚ÄîI just want you. Here. With me."
"No, it's not," Dad interrupted. "But‚Ä¶ gods, Pete, you're only eleven. You shouldn't even have to know any of this stuff, much less be concerned about it."
‚ÄúYeah, I know.¬† You‚Äôve gotta go,‚Äù Peter said, his upper lip curling into a sneer.¬† And he thought he was whiny.
As soon as Tony heard Steve shut off the water, he rolled back over, assuming his usual position as Steve asked JARVIS to turn off the lights and slid under the blankets next to him. Draping his arm across Tony's waist, Steve curled his tall, strong body around him, pressing him as closely as their sleeping clothes would allow. Steve was shirtless, as he always was, and Tony delighted in the feel of his husband's soft, smooth skin against his, and the spearminty scent of his breath.
"Uhh," Tony said, barely able to get the words out. "Steve‚Ä¶ he's‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶ Sam, is my kid okay?"
‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶ yeah, I did say that, little guy,‚Äù Steve finally said.¬† ‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶‚Äù
Peter winced, shifting on his feet. "Yeah, I know, but‚Äî"
They had come way,
"Yes!" Steve said. "JARVIS, please tell him we're fine‚Äî"
‚ù§ = you wish you could kudos again
Now‚Ä¶ it almost seemed like these files were coded in such a way that‚Ä¶
"Oh, and that always tends to go well," Sam said, rolling his eyes. "Do we know what kind of biological it was?"
"Yeah, if you can call twenty metres tall just 'big'," Peter said as he leapt from a huge pile of attack dog carcasses, landing about five metres behind one of the Gamorrean guard aliens. As soon as Peter's feet touched the ground, he launched two webs at the thing's head, yanking him down with one hard tug.
Another sharp stab pierced Peter's heart, this time of pain and worry. He didn't like thinking about Gwen going away at the end of the school year, and usually tried his hardest to forget about it.
And he could only imagine how many pictures and videos they had posted on all the social media sites.
"Yeah, well, can't say I'm too shocked about that. Thor's appetite's probably big enough for three people. Or three super soldiers, as it were."
At the moment Peter couldn't tell what was worse: the fact that his entire family was out there being forced to fight against a bunch of Chitauri-enhanced suits, or the fact that he was essentially stuck inside an impenetrable box, unable to help them.
"Shh, honey, it's okay," Tony whispered. He wound his arm around Steve's neck, turning his head so he could kiss him. "It's okay, baby. I'm here."
As soon as Rhodey stepped away Steve offered Tony his arm, leading him towards the exit doors. They were only a few steps away when Tony heard a laugh, a high-pitched, screeching laugh that was so vaguely familiar that he whipped around, tugging Steve with him as his eyes focused in on the far corner of the hallway, where a man dressed in an expensive, custom-made suit was speaking to Senator Davis and another man who appeared to be an Army general.
Steve was quiet for a moment, his thumb tracing soft circles on the back of Tony's hand. "I do think it's selfish, yes," he finally said. "But I also don't think it's very wrong of us to be selfish in that way. He's our son, Tony, and it's our job to protect him. And in certain cases I think that includes protecting him from himself."
Those were the simpler times, back when they were just training for the next possible alien invasion and trying to figure out what the hell was wrong with Peter.
He should‚Äôve known the day was going to go to shit the moment he got off the elevator, when he saw the look on Pepper‚Äôs face.¬† Pepper had been Tony‚Äôs assistant since Peter was two years old, and so had seen Tony go through a lot of crap.¬† But Tony had never, in over a decade of knowing her, seen her look so uneasy as she had been when she handed him his coffee that morning.
"Thanks, J," said Tony as Steve's shoulders dropped in relief. "And I suppose Toomes is still refusing to talk?"
There was no way in hell, Hel, Hades, or any other version of a horrible mythical underworld where Dad would
"Yeah," Steve quietly agreed, forcing a smile. "Make yourself comfortable, Scott. We'll all speak again in the morning."
"Oh gods, Tony, look at you," Steve said as he hit that spot again, his blue eyes so dark they were almost black. "I wish you could see how beautiful you are right now,
Finally done with his teeth, Peter shuffled back to his room, burrowing down into his papa's old blankets as Grandma adjusted his IV lines and helped him take a couple sips of water.
Shuri let out a soft chuckle as she finished placing a fourth cloth, gently patting Tony's shoulder. "There is no shame in that, Captain, for my brother was made in a similar fashion. It is both a gift and a curse to be placed in charge of defending the lives of one's people, but you and your team are to be commended. Because of you, we have beaten a most formidable enemy, and now Wakanda can breathe freely again." She flashed Steve a reassuring smile. "Mr Stark is stable for now, so I will go and check on your son."
"Which is the gauntlet," Peter cut in, just in case any of the so-called Guardians of the Galaxy were unsure.
"JARVIS, how much longer for the firing range upgrade on that drone?"
"Did you see the latest Lego catalog?" he asked. "There's a new Death Star set that's coming available in about a month!"
‚ÄúOoh, but I am not only in your face, am I?‚Äù he says.¬† ‚ÄúFor we are all in each other‚Äôs faces while we wait for our chance to swim.‚Äù¬† He lets out another creepy cackle as he leans down in front of Steve, eyeing him like he‚Äôs planning to take a bite out of his nose or something.¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôve sometimes wondered why that is, exactly.¬† Hmm, Steven?¬† What do you think?‚Äù
There was a pause as Wanda pondered Peter's words, her hands wringing and twisting in front of her, generating little flashes of red.
Tony and Steve locked eyes, a slight smile playing on both their lips.
"You've got me," Steve answered as he started fumbling with the button on Tony's pants. He was so hard it was almost painful, and his desperation wasn't helping his shaking fingers at all, which once again Tony seemed to notice as he stilled Steve's hand.
While Tony wasn't usually one for hyperbole, it turned out that the king wasn't joking. Aside from the five-course meal, which was incredible, the team was also treated to a traditional African dance performance as well as a fireworks display that would've put New York City's best New Year's Eve show to shame. By the time they had said all of their goodnights and dragged a half-asleep Peter to bed, Tony could honestly feel a few tiny trickles of optimism attempting to break through the solid iron wall of fear that had been building up inside him ever since the first space attack back in October.
And besides all that, he couldn't even tell Ned how he'd managed to catch Gwen's computer before it hit the floor, because no one except their Avengers family, Dr Cho, and Director Fury knew the truth about Peter's enhancements.
"I know, Steve, okay?" Tony snapped, instantly regretting his harsh words when Steve's face fell. "Jesus, honey, I didn't mean‚Äî"
"Thank you, James," Steve said as he shook Rhodey's hand. "We both really appreciate your support."
"Well‚Ä¶ it's a pretty competitive internship, so I'm guessing they need to interview a lot of people. And there's five slots, so that probably means more interviews too."
"Excellent!" Gwen exclaimed, smiling as she flipped her index cards. "Cindy, in what U.S. state did Winston Churchill make his famous 'Iron Curtain' speech in 1946?"
And maybe even offer another layer of protection for him as well. Because while Steve didn't believe that Peter was in actual danger, or at least not at the moment, with the way things were getting murkier by the second it certainly wouldn't hurt for Peter to have two more people to help watch over him when his dads couldn't.
But this nightmare had been different. This time, there had been no words for Tony to scream, and no breath in his lungs with which to scream them, and as such, it was taking Steve a few extra seconds to catch on.
‚ÄúThanks, J,‚Äù said Tony.¬† ‚ÄúGo on and get washed up now, yeah, bud?‚Äù
Steve rolled his eyes. "Yep, see ya later."
"You got it, buddy," Tony said as he ruffled Peter's already unruly curls. "Go on and start your homework now, yeah? Papa should be home soon with dinner."
"You know what? I think I will." Steve shot Peter a wink as he readied his pencil, grinning when Peter leaned over to watch. He had never enjoyed it when people watched him while he drew, but with Peter he found that he didn't mind at all.
Discovered by chance three miles off the Langaran coast about five years prior to the Battle of the Continents, Howard had been researching possible ways to utilise the oddly glowing cube right up until the Battle of the Continents and his subsequent arrest for treason. And ever since then, the military government had kept it locked away in some secured vault somewhere beneath the Air Corps base while their scientists attempted to come up with ways to use it to develop weapons of mass destruction.
Sam gave a nod, stepping up right next to Peter while Bucky leaned in, whispering something into his ear.
"Way too close," grumbled Dad from the floor by his gimbal. Dr Strange held out his hand, helping Dad back to his feet. "Thanks for that shield thing, by the way."
And, if that wasn‚Äôt enough, all four walls of his cell were covered in ice, the only exception being the small, square window, through which the man was now intently peering at him.
"Then it's done." Tony threaded his fingers into Steve's hair, kissing the top of his head. "Not a problem."
Steve refused.¬† Every single time.
"Yeah, sure," Steve shot back. "Says the guy who was almost an hour late for his own first date, hmm?"
Thor looked confused. "Is your given name not James Buchanan Barnes?"
‚ÄúOh God!‚Äù Tony cried as he rushed over, barely catching himself before he grabbed onto Steve‚Äôs shoulder.¬† He stopped with his hand in mid-air, his heart nearly tearing in two when Steve let out a soft, frightened whimper.
"No," Thanos suddenly said, and Steve gasped as all of his blood froze, transforming his heart into a solid block of ice.
Since Tony was already wearing his ring, Steve lifted his left hand to his lips, kissing the ring over its three embedded stones. Tony's lower lip was trembling as Steve lowered his hand, sucking in a deep breath.
Just then the colonel grabbed Winter Soldier around his neck, slamming his head back against the hard metal of the chair. "–≠—Ç–æ –≤–∞—à–∞ –æ–±—è–∑–∞–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –ø–æ–¥—á–∏–Ω—è—Ç—å—Å—è, —Å–æ–ª–¥–∞—Ç!"
"No, no, honey, you were perfect," Tony assured him. "No one except for me could tell that you were rattled."
All of which would create literally thousands of jobs, covering most of the planet. And, thanks to Colonel Phillips, who at the request of the new Langaran president had agreed to stay on as Commander of the Air Corps, Dad was now in charge of overseeing the design and manufacture of both the new commercial airliners and the airports themselves, while Papa had already been tasked with overseeing the training of the hundreds of new potential pilots in both classroom instruction and practical flying experience.
"Yeah, 'cept he's not my friend," Tony stated. "Saving his life is more of a professional courtesy."
Nothing like the only son of a billionaire to be the perfect score for some less-than-scrupulous people looking to make a few million bucks.
And give him hope that there might be more to come at some point in the future. Preferably the
He needed to tread carefully.¬† Very,
"Yeah, okay, but I don't think that's gonna work," Lang said. "You see, if Hank doesn't stop this Darren Cross guy, then‚Äî"
"I did indeed, sir," answered JARVIS. "Master Peter is currently engrossed in a video chat with Miss Stacy."
Steve smiled, showing off the glorious dimple in his cheek. "How 'bout a shower first?"
"When I get back," Steve said after a few heartbeat's pause.
"Well, isn't that what this newfangled thing we're starting tomorrow is supposed to address?" asked Sam. "The next phase or some shit like that?"
"Yeah, but that's only an excuse," Uncle Bucky said. "The thing is, I never even questioned it. My ma and papa never talked about it. We had Stevie over at the house just about every single day, and he'd be wheezing and hacking and running that steamer thingy of his all the time to try and help him breathe, and no one even questioned it. It was just how things were."
"Okay, great," said Gwen.
"C'mere, sweetheart," he said, pulling Tony onto his lap. He opened his sketchbook, taking out the two portraits that he'd finished only the day before and handing one to Tony. They were identical, two copies of the same picture of he, Tony, and Peter standing in front of the massive tree that Peter had told him so much about. The three of them were posed as for a photograph, with Peter in the middle and Tony and Steve on either side, their hands resting on Peter's shoulders.
"Nope, nope, I'll be fine," insisted Bruce. "Just need to work the kinks out a bit first. I'll be ready."
Tony shook his head, curling even further in on himself. Normally he would've jumped at the chance to tinker with another alien ship, especially after his experience with fixing Thor's.
"So, Clint and Bucky were talking some more about their next set of raids, and‚Äî"
"That's why we're all doing what we're doing, honey," said Tony, his arms tight around Steve's waist. "Whatever it takes, right?"
‚ÄúAhh, Rogers!¬† Can you not hear that crowd?‚Äù Schmidt suddenly barks in Steve‚Äôs direction, still waving his arms around like a drunken ballet dancer.¬† ‚ÄúIt is invigorating, is it not?‚Äù
"You know, my mom's making fried chicken and mashed potatoes for us," Gwen said as Peter ripped open his third bag of Doritos. They were sitting on the floor of her bedroom, a three thousand piece Harry Potter puzzle scattered in front of them. "And I made sure to remind her about the peppermint."
"Yeah, but this would all be a whole helluva lot easier if we knew where Thor was," said Bruce. "It's not like him to be gone this long."
"Steve, we all know that," Bruce said carefully. "Every single one of us knows that. But from HYDRA's perspective, Peter is a boy with a very unique genetic makeup that in their eyes would make him the perfect candidate for a Winter Soldier." He glanced sheepishly at Bucky, who gave him a quick nod. "All of the other enhanced individuals that we've encountered, including the other Winter Soldiers, yourself and Bucky, and even me, were enhanced after the fact. Artificially, if you will. But Peter, his is a natural phenomenon that started to develop when he hit puberty, and as far as we can see, one that's still developing as he continues to grow. His strength is still increasing, his senses are still becoming more enhanced, and right now we don't really know when that'll stop. Forgive me for saying so, but a person like that would be very attractive to HYDRA, or anyone else with nefarious intentions."
Which to Peter didn't make any sense at all. In order for the Meridians to fire a beam of that intensity at the precise moment that Captain Barnes's aircraft emerged back inside the planet's atmosphere, someone over there would've had to have known first that Langara had sent aircraft into space, and second, the exact time and location of Captain Barnes's reentry.
He was cut off as Steve added a third finger, his hands clutching the sheets in a white-knuckled grip. "Baby,
He had no doubt, though, that if Mr Jarvis were still alive, he would do whatever he could to help them. While he had never been too overtly vocal about his dissatisfaction with the Langaran military government‚Äîbecause most intelligent adults knew that anything they said could be used as ammunition for a possible sedition arrest‚ÄîTony had been able to glean enough from what Mr Jarvis did say to know exactly how he'd felt about it.
"And you weren't given a choice in the matter?"
Unable to speak, Steve had simply kissed him, carrying him off to their bedroom a short time later so he could show him his appreciation.¬† Of all the gifts Tony could‚Äôve given him, he had somehow managed to come up with the best possible choice.¬† Being able to get out of the city from time to time, with all of its noises and nosy people so he could enjoy things like ice skating, hiking, and other simple activities with his family sounded so wonderful to Steve that he was practically salivating just thinking about it.
"Better?" Tony asked once they were cuddled up in bed, his head resting in its usual spot on Steve's chest. He noticed that Tony felt a bit warmer than usual, but it was so slight that he brushed it off as either his imagination or as a result of the litre of coffee Tony had consumed since dinner time.
Before Thanos, at least, but still. The Avengers just‚Ä¶ didn't lose. They might get knocked down, as that old, goofy song went, but they always got right back up again.
Tony yelled, or rather hissed since he couldn't yell. He cupped Steve's cheek in one hand, turning him so he could see his tortured blue eyes. This one was going to haunt Steve for a long, long time, Tony could
But why in the
Peter's cheeks immediately flushed pink, and he winced. "Uhh, yeah. I just‚Ä¶ when I went to brush my teeth, I guess I kinda squeezed the toothpaste tube a bit harder than I needed to, and it‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ it kinda exploded, so then I had to clean it up. Sorry."
‚ÄúAhh‚Ä¶‚Äù¬† Tony trailed off as he made a tiny adjustment to the valve, creating a point three second delay in the release of the fuel into the main body of the missile.¬† ‚ÄúOkay, so‚Ä¶ run it again for me, yeah?‚Äù
"I'm off tomorrow, sweetie, okay?" she added. "So I'll see you in a couple of days."
"And I know he's never wondered that for a single moment, Tony," Steve said quickly. "Not a single one."
"Yes, I understand," Steve cut in. "Thank you."
‚ÄúSo, you still gonna be at school on Monday?‚Äù Ned asked.
Tony scoffed, burrowing impossibly closer. Apparently Mr Super-Strategist had struck again.
Someone was attempting to mess with the code, and it wasn't Dad. And since no one had seen Grandpa in weeks, Peter was pretty sure it wasn't him either.
"Well, then you should fit right in, right, Pete?" Tony said. "Maybe the two of you and the twins can build a functioning food replicator while we're down here."
so completely
"No, not unless something really weird happens." A knot rose in Tony's throat. "Mine‚Ä¶ I never got as bad as Pete. My defect was pretty much the same as his, but‚Ä¶ he should've had his surgery over eight years ago, after he was first diagnosed, so‚Äî"
"Then I think we should get started."
DUM-E gave a rather fearful warble in response, one that prompted Peter to give him a reassuring pat on his arm. "Aww, it's okay, boy," he said. "This isn't gonna hurt. Right, Dad?"
And while Steve felt kinda bad that he had chased Sam away, he still couldn't bring himself to slow down. Running had always helped to clear Steve's head, and at the moment he could use all the help he could get. Especially since the phone call he had made to his ma after leaving Phillips's office had only managed to muddy the waters even more.
, after all, but to Tony he was still just a kid, still just his little Petey, and he'd be damned if he would allow anything to happen to make his little Petey have to grow up any faster than he already was. And that included naming him an Avenger while he was only a sophomore in high school.
dinner, the one that had started with him getting basically interrogated by Chief Stacy and ended with him puking and writhing in pain from eating a piece of peppermint cake.
"Ten, nine, eight, seven‚Äî" Steve started, his next word lodging in his throat as another Meridian aircraft suddenly appeared about a hundred and fifty metres directly in front of him, his eyes going wide as he took it in.
"Pretty obvious, Steve," Bucky said. "Obvious enough for everyone on the team to have figured it out. And Phillips."
Peter hadn't realised how tightly he was holding his fork until he looked down and saw that it was starting to mould to his fingers. He loosened his grip, trying to bend it back without looking too obvious as he struggled to think of a response.
Since it was a beautiful, sunny day outside they took Steve's motorcycle, arriving at the cozy restaurant Sam had chosen just as Sam was helping Bucky out of the passenger seat of his car.
"No, not exactly. But‚Ä¶" Papa trailed off, glancing back at King T'Challa, who was standing at the head of his warriors, flanked by General Okoye, his sister, Shuri, and another tall, broad dude who looked like his bodyguard. The king's lips twitched as he gave Papa a nod, one that Papa grimly returned.
‚ÄúI know you are,‚Äù Steve cut in.¬† ‚ÄúBut we said we would do this together, right?‚Äù
"You told him
"Okay, but I didn't,
"Yep," replied Dad with wide eyes. "And that was‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ that was something, is what that was. And I thought
Steve grinned widely. Peter Edwin Stark was absolutely the sweetest kid he had ever seen, and there were many times when Steve still couldn't believe he was able to call him his son.
Tony nodded, sucking in a slow, deep breath. Steve was right. Peter was fine. It'd just been a bad dream.
and finally settled on the most perfect
‚ÄúI sure think so,‚Äù says Steve.¬† ‚ÄúI honestly can‚Äôt believe no one‚Äôs recognised his potential before now.‚Äù
And it was continuing to drop like a rock.
And it had all been accomplished with the input and expertise of the three Stark-Rogers men.
"Yes, I am," Peter said, quite triumphantly. "Pleeeaaassseee?"
Since a lot of the team members were still getting over jet lag and such, Steve had set their first official training session for the following Monday, but had asked if he, Tony, and Peter could begin working on some manoeuvres beforehand.
"You're welcome, little guy," Papa said as he handed Dad one of his weird-looking green smoothies. "And Uncle Sam and Uncle Bucky are coming over in a few minutes to watch a movie with us, does that sound okay?"
‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶‚Äù Peter said with a rather sheepish shrug.¬† ‚ÄúI don't get into
"Uhh, it means more than just a friend," he replied sheepishly, turning his face into his pillow. "Kinda like how Dad and Papa like each other, only not quite so‚Ä¶ intense."
‚Äîwell, um‚Ä¶ so‚Ä¶ how, exactly?"
"Yes, sir," Steve answered, raising his eyebrow in what he hoped was a clear message that no, everything was
And while attempting to dodge a teammate's aircraft that had just gone up in flames.
If JARVIS was able to find what Peter hoped he would, then that meant that‚Äî
"Just‚Ä¶ keep him with you until we figure this out, okay, Buck?" Steve asked.
"Yes, he's completely fine," Steve assured him. "His burns weren't nearly as bad as yours, Shuri said they were just like a second-degree sunburn. He was healed up in a few hours."
"Yeah, and I'm still not convinced that the two attacks aren't related." Tony slid his hands down the sides of Steve's back, slipping his fingers underneath his bulky sweatshirt and tight undershirt to ghost across the soft skin just above his waistband. "Coincidence my ass, there's no way you can tell me this second attack wasn't because of the first, even if it wasn't by the same people or group."
"Yeah, it does," answered Steve, looking out the big kitchen windows. While there was still a thin layer of snow covering most of the yard, the sun was bright, the trees were starting to bud, and the ice covering the lake was starting to break apart.
"Just a holding facility," Bartlett said. He handed Tony a business card, pointing to a phone number. "You can call that number on Monday to arrange for‚Äî"
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still trying to figure that out,‚Äù replied Fury.¬† ‚ÄúBut it seems as though a few of the scientists that were brought on after World War II had some ties to the organisation that weren‚Äôt discovered in time.‚Äù
The rest of Sam's reply was lost in a barrage of fire from three Wakandan aircraft as they looped back around. Swerving to avoid being hit, Tony screeched to a halt just in time to witness Scott Lang, who was roughly the height of a five story building, take out another of the ugly-as-hell flying whale creatures with a single left hook.
‚ÄúHey, Lorraine?‚Äù Steve calls as he wheels his chair over to his dividing wall, poking his head around it.¬† ‚ÄúDid you make this four o‚Äôclock appointment for me?‚Äù
"Copy that, Cap," said Natasha. "I'll be ready. And say hi to my –º–∏–ª–∞—è –æ—à–∏–±–∫–∞ for me, will you?"
‚ÄúI‚ÄîI‚Äôm so sorry I woke you,‚Äù he added a few moments later.¬† ‚ÄúI didn't‚ÄîI didn't mean to‚Äî‚Äù
And with their relationship as new as it had been back then, Steve knew that Tony was still haunted by those arguments. He would never admit such fears to Steve's face, but Tony's nightmares never lied, and were often far more telling than he was while awake.
"Damn, honey," he said, completely awestruck. "You're just fucking
Dare I say that after that shower, I've actually worked up a bit of an appetite."
the wizard had said, and even though he was weird and apparently enjoyed speaking in riddles, Peter couldn't imagine why he would say something like that if it wasn't true.
"Tony, don't!" Steve said, grunting as the agent cuffed his hands behind him. "Please, sweetheart, don't. Don't give them anything that they could use against you."
Tony huffed into his pillow, biting his lip again as Steve carefully worked him open, nearly sobbing once he finally pulled out his fingers and laid down next to him, rolling Tony onto his side.
Pursing his lips, Bruce carefully covered him with a blanket as Tony's helmet retracted and he leaned over him, his face twisted in anger.
"It's okay, sweetheart. I've got you," Steve murmured as he drew Tony gently against his warm,
"Oh really,
"Oh sure," said Tony. "But since you're still perfect, I'm pretty sure that's not going to happen."
"Yes, please," Peter answered with a rather emphatic nod. "And don't forget your sketchbook, okay?"
"It's not ideal, but I'm kinda used to that by now," admitted Tony. "Each pilot carrying twice as many satellites means they'll have to deploy them all, which means they'll each be up there twice as long, but‚Äî"
‚Äîand if he'd be interested in‚Äî
Yet another reminder of how badly he‚Äôs managed to fuck-up his life.
to him. The whole entire thing had just been one gigantic lie, and like a complete and utter
Instead of responding Steve ducked his head to kiss him again, sliding his hand under Tony's shoulder.
"Okay, so‚Ä¶ what do you think, J?" he asked, stopping suddenly to squint at something that turned out to just be a tiny flicker in the projection. "How's it looking?"
Tony thought firmly.
And it didn't help that Dad and Uncle Bruce had just recently uncovered a campaign funding trail from a company run by the late Alexander Pierce to not only President Cole, but also to several of the recently-elected senators, a fact that Dad had refused to pass along to Papa without Uncle Sam being present.
"Gee, thanks," Natasha said, tossing Clint a wink.
he said, the words so garbled they were unintelligible as Tony bobbed up and down, licking and sucking just the way he knew Steve loved, his free hand sliding under Steve's ass to tease at his crack. It had only been a few seconds, but he was already so close he knew he couldn't hold on any longer. "
"Captain Rogers! Can you describe what space is like in ten words or less?"
Just like him.
A pregnant pause settled over the bathroom as Steve attempted to glare at Tony, his lower lip starting to shake after about only three seconds.
Peter shook his head, gulping down more water. "No, no, I figured it out! Whoever did this wasn't only after Papa, they were after Phoenix too! Without JARVIS, no one in Langara can control the satellites, which means‚Äî"
"The purple stone is the Power Stone," said Wong. He stepped over Dr Strange, his hands clasped behind his back. "He must have retrieved it from somewhere offworld."
Once again, Tony was struck speechless, wishing for the umpteenth time that Steve was there with them. A quick glance over at his son confirmed that he was thinking the exact same thing, which, while not helpful in the slightest, at least made Tony feel just a tiny bit better.
Tony huffed out a sharp breath, pondering his next words carefully.¬† It was true that the United States had no official stake in the violence in Sokovia since it was supposedly an internal conflict.¬† But he also knew that while Sokovia was nowhere of interest, it was also on the way to everywhere of interest, meaning that just about everyone who was anyone was interested in who was controlling it at any given time.
And while that agreement hadn't made Rhodey an official member of the Avengers, given the facts that he still divided most of his time between D.C. and Edwards Air Force Base out in California and used his armour to complete specific missions for the Air Force, the entire team still considered him to be a sort of honorary member, someone both Tony and Steve knew they could count on if they needed him.
"Yes, Senator?"
"So, Uncle Sam's offered to cook dinner for us tonight," Papa said as he drove out onto the street. "He and Bucky are coming up around six if that's okay with you."
Tony watched as Steve sauntered away, resisting the strong urge to say the hell with dinner anyway and chase after him. While they hadn't exactly been celibate since that awful night when Steve tried to burn off his skin, Tony had been extra careful to avoid using sex as a crutch when Steve got particularly bad, instead calling Sam to help talk him down.
"Yes, sir, I understand that this is a pretty unique case, but‚Äîno, sir, I don't believe at all that Captain Rogers' intentions were hostile‚Äîyes, sir, I know that, but this happened almost seventy years ago, which is why I believe that the statute of limitations‚Äîyes‚Äîyes, sir. I understand, sir, thank you for your time."
This was going to be when he proposed, first to Peter, and then to Tony, and while intellectually he knew that the chances of either of them turning down his proposals were slim, a small, very nervous part of him still believed that they might say no.
"Yeah, I do," replied Peter. He didn't bother to add that Dad had had this particular phone custom-made for him for his fifteenth birthday. "Dad gives them to me to field test before they're produced. I help him find bugs in the operating software, so‚Äî"
"Mmm," Tony muttered under his breath. He bit back his retort that parts of New York were still trying to dig out from under all of the Chitauri junk, including some areas not too far from the Tower, but since the Triskelion was in D.C. it therefore had to have priority.
"Let's not do this again anytime soon, yeah?" he said as Steve kissed the top of his head. "In fact, I'd really prefer to never have to do it again. Like, ever."
‚ÄúThere you go,‚Äù Natasha says with a grin.¬† ‚ÄúNow you‚Äôre learning.‚Äù
Tony was only a few steps away from the mess hall when the lights suddenly cut out, plunging the entire building into complete darkness. He managed to swallow his gasp before it could escape, halting in place as he fumbled to turn on the handlamp and hoping that his heart would work its way out of his throat before he returned to Steve.
Steve grunted, patting Peter once on the back. "Peter, I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Have a good night."
"The boy's gonna be fine, –°—Ç–∏–≤–∏," Bucky said, breaking Steve from his thoughts. "It's just a movie date. We used to go on 'em all the time."
"Anything, honey."
Almost instantly, Steve‚Äôs stomach transforms into a solid block of ice, sending freezing crystals shooting throughout his entire body as the realisation that he just placed fucking fourth finally washes over him.¬† For a moment, he‚Äôs too frozen to move, completely dumbfounded as to how he could have screwed things up this badly.
"Shit, baby," he choked out as Steve practically swallowed him down. "You're so good, Steve, so goddamn good." His fingers wound into Steve's hair as Steve's hand slid underneath Tony's ass, squeezing it as he hummed his approval, the vibrations rippling up Tony's body like waves as he was finally pulled over the edge.
"Ah huh. And you people worked for Fury?" Carol asked.
"Your Highness! Are you‚Äîare you all right?" Steve forced past his dust-coated throat as he quickly scanned the wreckage for the rest of his team. His heart gave a leap when he saw Sam crouched down a few metres away, his wings covering Natasha like a huge carbon fibre umbrella. Bucky and Thor were both curled behind a tipped-over couch, a bit dazed like he was, but seemingly unharmed.
Before Bruce had even finished speaking, Tony felt a hard tug right behind his navel, gasping as less than a nanosecond later he was transported into the tunnel.
Steve gulped, his cheeks going pink. "I didn't give them one, did I?"
One might've thought that after surviving being bombed, kidnapped, experimented on, and nearly suffocating in the middle of the desert, Peter might've earned some kind of get out of jail free card on any further life-altering trauma, but apparently the bombing/ kidnapping was only the warmup. It was barely a year later that the wormhole from space opened up over their Tower home, allowing the Chitauri aliens to invade New York City. And then that led to the huge mess with Project Insight and trying to figure out how to deprogram Uncle Bucky, which then led to Obie breaking into the Tower to kidnap Peter
‚ÄúThat is again correct, Master Peter.‚Äù
"Nice one, honey."
‚ÄúDon't worry!‚Äù Steve tries to call as his arm flops back to his side.¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going anywhere.‚Äù
He was Captain America, for heaven‚Äôs sake, and Captain America didn't give in to bullies.¬† No matter who they were.
"Did I ever tell you that you're an excellent father?" Steve asked as he and Tony made their way to their suite. He'd meant the comment as a sincere‚Äîif not a bit rhetorical‚Äîcompliment, and so was alarmed when Tony's head whipped up to look at him, his brown eyes alight with fear and self-deprecation. He immediately paused in the hallway, reaching for Tony's elbows. "Sweetheart, what's wrong?"
"And he's doing okay? Getting better?"
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm telling you,‚Äù Peter whispered as he pulled up another document, the un-redacted version of the employee file for Regina Williams.
"Dad, Papa, look! They're starting!"
Tony huffed in frustration as he turned to face Peter, ducking down as he tried to make eye contact. "Yeah, well, first of all, I never said that you said anything like that. And secondly, you can drop this whole attitude thing that you've got going on right the hell now, or you can mosey right on back upstairs to your room, understand? I'm already edgy enough about this whole thing without adding all of your excess teenage grump."
"I love you, sweetheart," he said softly. "We're in this together, don't ever forget that."
"Godddamnit," Tony whispered. He had never been great at staying angry at Peter, and this apparently was no exception. Shaking his head, he stepped forward, placing both hands on his son's shoulders and vaguely aware that the maroon cloak was still following him around like a lost puppy. "Good grief, buddy. Don't you think for one second that I blame you for any of this. But you were supposed to go home, not follow me here, and now there's no way to let Papa know that you're okay."
"It's all right, Tony," said Bruce. "I can head over to New Asgard with Thor and take a look at things first, and then you can just come over when you're ready. No one expects you to be away from your son while he's recovering."
‚ÄúYeah, Mags,‚Äù Tony finally forces out.¬† He clears his throat, giving Mags what he hopes is a convincing smile.¬† ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù
Steve swallowed, his face frozen in what he hoped was a neutral expression. "No, sir."
Of course, they still needed to actually get their hands on the tesseract, and Phillips still needed to inform the pilots that the mission they'd be undertaking would be placing them at very high risk for getting arrested for treason if something went wrong, but at the moment Tony didn't feel like thinking about all that. He was planning to program Peter's latest upgrades to JARVIS once the day's simulator sessions were complete, and as long as those worked‚Äîwhich they would, of that Tony had no doubt‚Äîthen the pilots carrying out Project Phoenix would be as well-protected and well-prepared as Tony and Colonel Phillips could get them.
"Yeah?" said James, crossing his arms. "What of it?"
Yet another raid where they didn't find Steve, or really anything else that was useful. Out of the three HYDRA bases that they uncovered, only one looked like it had even been in use during the last fifty years, and which was far too small to be anything other than an outpost of sorts.
"No, I'm‚Äî" he started, tightening his grip on Tony's shoulder as he drew in another deep breath. Peter was okay. Tony was okay, and now he was okay. It had only been a bad dream.
"Yeah."
With any luck Peter was already situated on Asgard, but knowing Tony, he was probably holed up in his lab, running himself ragged with trying to find him. Tears stung Steve's eyes as he imagined his beloved husband going mad with worry, refusing to eat or sleep and snapping at anyone who attempted to help him.
"No, honey, nothing's too good for you," Tony said. He brushed Steve's lips in a soft kiss before squeezing his eyes closed, biting down hard on his bottom lip as Steve let out another wanton moan. "You only deserve the best."
Steve shifted on his feet, crossing his arms. "Two of our guests searched Thanos out a few months ago."
Peter was so lost in his morbid thoughts that he completely forgot about watching the clock, nearly jumping out of his skin when the bell rang to end the period. He packed up his computer and books with shaking hands, kicking himself for not paying closer attention.
"But, you were right." Steve swallowed hard, choosing his next words carefully. "I can't‚ÄîI can't do this on my own. Not anymore, so‚Ä¶ Sam and I, we made a plan, and I'm gonna‚ÄîI'm gonna try and work on this."
So dangerously close, in fact, that as she shifted the stack of books to try and set them down on her desk one row over, the laptop proceeded to do just that. In a flash Peter shot forward, leaping across another desk and managing to catch the computer just before the corner would've hit the hard vinyl floor.
But since he couldn't, he simply tensed his abs and sat up, his arms curling around Tony's body as he buried his face in Tony's shoulder, gasping as Tony shifted on the bed so his knees were pressing into the mattress, trapping his cock between them.
‚ÄúNah, bud, you know I don‚Äôt mind,‚Äù Dad replies.¬† ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not too much in the shop at the moment anyway, so the timing worked out fine.‚Äù
‚ÄúUh huh, that sounds good,‚Äù answered Peter.¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna take my stuff to my room.‚Äù
No, he'd have to wait until the experiment was over, and all of HYDRA's remaining influence over him was dead and gone.
That had also been the first time that Tony had shown his tender, nurturing side with Steve, which Steve had already seen him demonstrate in spades with Peter.
small human. Like the size of a bug, small.
"You've got your glasses and earplugs, right?" Dad asked as the elevator doors closed.
"I'll stop by and check on him tomorrow afternoon," said Dr Cho as she and Uncle Bruce got up to leave.
"Okay," he murmured, his pencil flying around his thumb as he read over the lines of code. Just as he'd suspected, everything that he'd programmed since Dad had installed JARVIS's initial matrix was perfectly fine, which meant there had to have been some monitoring program installed on Dad‚Äôs computer way back before he first started that had somehow flagged the program as something someone needed to look at.
Thank you so much for all of the wonderful comments!  I‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre enjoying the story! üíó
asked Mr O'Carl.
"Yeah, but that's kinda the point, ya know?" said Ned. "We go to Hawaii every summer so we can get out of the busy city. So we can lie around on the beach all day and swim in the ocean and watch the sunsets. But now when they come out here, we're gonna have to show them around and stuff."
In an instant, Obie‚Äôs face transformed from its sickly steel-grey colour to boiling hot red, so much so that for a moment, Tony was afraid his head might actually explode.
"Damn." Tony sat back as he removed his glasses, scrubbing at his eyes. "Now there's a thought, hmm?"
carefully wrapped his purchases in brown paper, tying the package with a piece of twine while his teenage son scooped out Little Steve's ice cream, giving him an extra half a scoop when Little Steve thanked him.
Sam started, as barely a second later none other than Dr Strange himself stepped through the circle, dressed in the same wizard's robes he'd been wearing when Thanos' alien accomplice had taken him aboard his ship.
A soft pink flush crept up Gwen's cheeks as she smiled. "Well‚Ä¶ I tend to remember things that are important. But seriously. If everything that your dad's been through already hasn't killed him, then I doubt his heart's going to all of a sudden give way on him." She gave Peter's hand a squeeze. "And, pardon me for saying, but it seems like you've been under just as much stress as him since school started, and I'm sure your heart's just fine too."
"No, mo gr√°," Steve said as he lifted his head, his chest still heaving as he trailed his thumb across Tony's cheekbone, his eyes so full of love that Tony could barely look in them.
Steve smiled slightly as he nodded, slipping his hand around Tony's waist and pressing their foreheads together. "Home. That sounds great."
"We need to get going now, his O2 sats are only eighty-two percent," the second medic said. "I've already informed the hospital."
Tony nodded, his thumb brushing back and forth across Peter's knuckles. "And I had no idea, absolutely no idea on what the hell I was doing with a baby. The mom‚Ä¶ she cut off all contact with Pete the moment he was born, and Rhodey, he tried to help me as much as he could, but he didn't really know anything about babies either, and then with Howard right there in the house, but still not really
Steve thought as he gritted his teeth and threw another punch, this time a hard left jab, the pain that he felt upon impact driving him to punch again even harder. Over and over again, Steve slammed his fists into the tough canvas and leather, pointedly ignoring his rapidly increasing pain level until he realised that he could no longer feel his fingers. He stepped back, shaking out his hands as he squeezed his eyes closed, breathing in deeply through his nose. He knew that he ought to stop, maybe take a day or two off from punching to give his hands a chance to recover a bit, but he just couldn't bring himself to stop.
"Which I completely agree with," Tony said. "Hell, there's no telling what that kid would be out there doing without us putting our foot down all the damn time. But honey, I don't think we can tell him no here, I just don't. If we try this experiment on Bucky and it works, then Pete should have the option of trying it too. He deserves to be free of HYDRA's poison."
"Nah, I don't think so," said Papa, his frown deepening. He looked up as Uncle James and Uncle Sam touched down on Dad's opposite side, while Uncle Thor, Uncle Clint, Auntie Nat, and the twins fell in behind them.
After returning Tony‚Äôs tentative smile, Steve focused his attention on the board.¬† So far it was almost surreal how well the evening had progressed, especially since Steve had been so nervous before Peter showed up at the store that he‚Äôd actually thrown up, nearly scaring Ashes half to death in the process.¬† He‚Äôd then proceeded to annoy the snot out of her when he decided to change his shirt about twenty minutes before Peter arrived, trying on three different ones before settling on his favourite light blue button-down.
Keeping his right hand flat against the bed, Steve released the headboard and began hopping towards the bathroom, stopping at the end of the bed to balance himself on the footboard. The bathroom was still about ten paces away with nothing more for him to grab onto, but once he was able to get to the doorway he would hopefully be okay.
"That's in England," Gwen finished, closing her locker door. "Yeah, that one."
Maybe it was time to start working on another override protocol for JARVIS, and finally see what they'd been hiding ever since they got back from Mongolia.
A knot rose in Steve's throat at the question, and the way Peter had asked it. The entire drive over to the hospital Steve had been trying to convince himself that he should back off a bit on the visits, especially since he felt bad for constantly lying to his teammates about his whereabouts. But all of those efforts had flown out the window almost the moment he entered the room and saw Peter's face.
"JARVIS, show me what it would look like if the targeting range was doubled?"
"But nothing about what we've found here, okay JARVIS?" Steve said. "If he asks, just‚Äî"
"And you," Steve said firmly.
‚ÄúNope, but I have a feeling you're gonna tell me anyway,‚Äù said Tony.
"No, it's not," added Gamora.
Of course, Peter seemed to have connected most of the dots of what had happened‚Äîif not all of them, which presented its own dilemma. Like Tony often said, sometimes Peter was just too smart for his own good, and Steve knew that he and Tony were going to have to sit down privately with him at some point and explain everything that had happened, as difficult as it was going to be. It would be far better for Peter to hear it all directly from his dads rather than try and put a bunch of jumbled pieces together on his own.
Intellectually, Steve knows that it doesn‚Äôt really matter anyway.¬† That dwelling on the stupid,
"Yeah, yeah, okay," Dad cut in. He sat down next to Peter, blotting his forehead with the towel still hanging around his neck. "How much of it did you eat, bud?"
Steve carefully rearranged himself on the bed before taking the bag from Tony's hand and setting it down. "No, you're not fine, and it's also okay that you're not." He held out his arms, which Tony didn't hesitate for a second to crawl into, curling into Steve with his head on his chest.
don't try and keep secrets from me. I can't‚ÄîI just can't handle it."
Not that they likely would've done it if he'd asked anyway, but it still might have helped to ease some of his guilt.
"Well, then, what?" snapped Uncle Bucky. "We can't just leave him alone the whole damn day, Sam! Then he'll really start to catch on."
They found Scott Lang lying on the padded bench in his cell, his hands folded behind his head as he contemplated the ceiling. As soon as he noticed Steve he shot to his feet, nearly tipping over in his haste to salute him.
"Love you too, buddy," said Tony, grinning slightly at the wide smile on Peter's face as he greeted Gwen. Steve knew the fact that Gwen was aware of Peter's secret still worried Tony‚Äîit honestly worried him too, but he preferred to not think too much about that‚Äîbut so far neither she nor her father had shown any indications that the team's trust in them was misplaced. George Stacy had even participated in Steve's rescue from the HYDRA bunker, and assisted in the capture and arrest of Quentin Beck and Justin Hammer, the two HYDRA scientists working out of it.
Tony scoffed, shaking his head as he carefully took Peter's hand. "I don't‚ÄîI don't know about that‚Ä¶ You'd think a hero would be able to protect his own kid better than‚Äîbetter than this."
Phillips laughed. A loud, raucous laugh that Tony hadn't heard from him in‚Ä¶ well, probably ever.
Tony gave a single nod, quickly downing the rest of his coffee. "What time did you tell Bruce to come up?"
‚ÄúYou close at what, seven?‚Äù Tony asked, grateful when his voice didn't wobble.¬† ‚ÄúI can be here at five till, and JARVIS can have our food waiting for us when we get to the Tower.‚Äù
"I only require Mr Lang's signature for his employment paperwork," replied JARVIS. "Once that is complete, there is a car waiting at the building's entrance to transport him to the airport."
"Guess Flash is trying to show off his new car," Peter said. He swung his backpack over his shoulder, shaking his head.
bad.‚Äù
"Yeah, yeah, okay honey," Tony said quickly. He brought Steve's hand to his lips and kissed it, the scratch of his facial hair against Steve's scorched skin causing him to flinch. "That's a new one, isn't it?"
Tony tilted his head, eyeing the bathroom door warily. "Well, he definitely
"And that's what gave you the knowledge to design an aircraft that can fly into space?" Steve asked. "Astrophysics is the study of space and stars and how they relate to each other, isn't it?"
And while he knew that the days ahead wouldn't be all sunshine and roses and white-sand beaches, nightmares never just go away when their root cause is gone, after all, Tony knew that at least one of his nightmares, perhaps even the one he most feared, was now only just that.
‚ÄúCome on, Pete, let's get you bundled up before you start shivering,‚Äù Dad says as Peter climbs out of the pool.¬† He drapes Peter‚Äôs towel over his shoulders, rubbing his hands up and down Peter‚Äôs arms as Peter burrows down into the warm fluffiness.
"He has? How?" Bucky asked, confused. "Seems to me he's got a pretty cushy job for a civvy. I bet there's a ton of people out there who would kill to have a job like his."
"Very good, sir."
"Yes, I do," Steve said firmly. "'Cause without you and Peter I don't know if I ever would've opened my eyes enough to see what was going on around me, and that's just inexcusable. No one should ever be that blind, Tony. Not ever."
"Yeah, okay, but‚Ä¶ I'm right, aren't I?" Peter asked. "Dad and Uncle Bruce found something in the data?"
‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù asks Steve.
Tony thought, proudly despite himself.
Steve let out another sharp moan as the pleasure coil began to wind deep inside his gut, spiking as Tony's fingers on his ass slid over to brush across his crack. He shifted, capturing Tony's lips again in another bruising kiss as he wrapped his hand around Tony's, slowing the speed of his strokes. He was close, so very close, but he wasn't ready for it to be over just yet. He wasn't ready for their little window of early-morning bliss to close. There was so much uncertainty ahead of them, with the mission and with Peter's health, and Steve just wanted to stay inside their cozy and intimate bubble as long as he possibly could.
"We'd have to kill Thanos first," Steve said softly. "As soon as he places the stone in the gauntlet, we'd have to kill him."
And then he was there, standing in front of Steve, his polished red and gold armour shining brightly even in the dim light of the bunker. HYDRA had altered his suit design, making it bulkier with more obvious weaponry, similar to James' War Machine armour, and the mask was shaped into the most menacing frown that Steve had ever seen, but Steve still knew it was him. There was no way that Hammer would go through his whole song and dance routine if it wasn't.
‚ÄúVery good, sir.‚Äù
"No. I'm gonna stay and help," Peter said firmly just as yet another suit flew in through the hole in the roof, aiming directly for Uncle Sam. Peter immediately launched another web, catching the suit around its neck as it flew overhead.
Steve's belly gave a violent swoop, his hand tightening on the shield. "Okay. Can you give me your best guess?"
"I know," Steve said softly, his cheeks blushing an adorable shade of pink. "But the Mediterranean is clear and warm and sunny, nothing like the water that I was‚Ä¶ frozen in." He didn't say frozen in
Even Peter has told Steve as much, in his adorable, twelve-year-old boy way.
A bright blue light flashed from his palm, indicating a direct and destructive hit. Immediately, Tony pivoted, aiming another shot towards the floor-to-ceiling windows lining one half of the lab.
The prepared speeches were next‚Äîin which Peter gave a daring and brave speech comparing the rise of modern terrorism to cancer that earned him a standing ovation from not only the entire audience but also the opposing team‚Äîfollowed by the Super Quiz round, which Tony knew was Peter's favourite part of the competition.
"Yep. That's my –º–∏–ª–∞—è –æ—à–∏–±–∫–∞," Natasha said, tossing Steve a smirk. "Good thing your kid is cute, Rogers."
In all of Steve's life,
Or maybe he had noticed and had simply chosen to ignore it, not wanting to delve any deeper in the inequality of it all since he'd finally gotten what he'd always wanted.
Peter bit down on his bottom lip so hard that he nearly drew blood. He knew he should probably just keep his mouth shut and try and enjoy the rest of the meal, but he couldn't just sit there and listen to his family be insulted, or just brush off the fact that such a high-ranking police officer couldn't seem to see that Peter had been doing good things with Spider-Man, not trying to interfere with his police force.
Tony's fingers brushed across Steve's lips, his eyebrows knitting into an even deeper frown. "All right, so, do you want to talk about it? 'Cause that's probably a better idea than trying to burn off your skin, don't ya think?"
A huge thank-you to my wonderful betas jehbeeeh and allthesinnersandallthesaints üíó
Too exhausted and overwhelmed to argue, Steve simply smirks as Thor glances up towards the sky.
Hurrying back to his quarters, Steve readied for bed, setting his alarm for 0520, an entire hour later than usual due to the new class replacing his typical 0600 morning briefing. Ten minutes to wake up and get dressed, forty minutes for his morning run, ten minutes to shower, thirty minutes to eat breakfast, and then on to class.
"The drone is armed and ready, sir," JARVIS replied.
And how much he wished they were Tony's arms instead.
Couldn't seem to fight his way out of the mental ice threatening to freeze him yet again, to hold him down until he had no choice but to drown.
Especially about him.
"But his airline ticket was from New York to Savannah, Georgia?"
suddenly said. "We should get to Earth and join in the fight. They will need our help."
It wasn‚Äôt until he had taken out the tenth such tree that he realised that the sun had dipped completely beyond the horizon, leaving him alone in the dark with only the soft light from a crescent moon and his enhanced eyesight to guide him.
Which didn't take long, given that Steve had just fucked him into the mattress the night before.
‚ÄúUh huh.¬† That‚Äôs what I said,‚Äù replied Peter.¬† ‚ÄúAnd before you go off laughing at me, don't forget about the time that you stepped on your own shoelace and face planted right in the middle of the entire lunchroom.‚Äù
"And the Asgardians, you said, Captain?" Thor spoke up from his seat next to Bruce. "You said my people were there as well?"
With a frustrated sigh, Steve closed out his queries and shut down the workstation, giving the cadet at the desk a brief nod on his way out the door.
All of which meant that they were rapidly running out of time. If Tony didn't figure out how to restore Steve's power soon, then‚Äî
Steve shot him a deep frown. "That doesn't sound very convincing."
"My vision's still wonky too," Steve admitted. "I'm‚ÄîI'm‚Äî"
was supposed to take down HYDRA, and I thought that I had. I guess I was just too damn arrogant to think that by taking down the Red Skull that HYDRA would just cease to exist."
Peter sighed.
"No, I don't think it's quite that either," Gwen said with a huff. "It's more like‚Ä¶ I'm not sure he knows what to think, actually. On the one hand, he's just a normal guy, a police officer in charge of trying to keep the Midtown precinct a safe place, and he's really good at what he does. His officers are loyal, they never have anything but good things to say about him, and his percentage of cops that turn dirty is the lowest in the entire state and has been for years." She paused, tapping her fingers on her lunch tray. "I think part of it is that he's envious. 'Cause I mean, he is just a normal police chief running a precinct that also houses the Avengers‚Äî"
Tony frowned, pursing his lips. "If you'll allow me to finish,
He broke off as Peter pulled hard on his shoulders, forcing them both to the barren, dust-covered ground. Tony's heart froze when he saw that Peter's legs were already gone, so consumed with terror that the entire universe shrank down to just his son's frightened face, and the hand he reached up towards Tony.
"–î–∞. –°–¥–µ–ª–∞–Ω–æ."
‚ÄúYeah, you heard me,‚Äù said Tony as he pulled a schematic up on his monitor, something he‚Äôd been tinkering with off and on for the last few years.¬† ‚ÄúAnd I want whatever drug trials we were involved in restarted ASAP.¬† Like, yesterday.‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, come on, Pete!‚Äù Tony says, starting to lose his patience.¬† ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt this the kind of something that I, as the parent, should be asking you,
Rumlow's bright pink lips curled into a sneer, one so awful that an ice-cold shiver raced down Steve's spine. "What makes you think i was gonna sell it to anyone?" he said, letting out a laugh that was so slimy it made Steve's blood run cold. "Hey, how's that kid of yours doing, hmm? He still getting those‚Ä¶ what'd you call them? Premonitions? Does he still think I'm a bad guy who's gonna come and get him during the night?"
Tony had been prepared to risk everything for Steve.¬† His company, his livelihood, and Peter‚Äôs inheritance.¬† And then‚Ä¶
"Probably just can't believe that his old man actually got asked out," Tony muttered. "Oh well. Long as the kid's happy." He looked up at the clock again, gulping when he saw it was already 2045. From what Tony had already seen of Steve the man was never late for anything, which meant he only had to amuse himself for about another fifteen minutes until he showed up.
pleaded Bruce. "We really don't have time for this!"
Somehow, over the years, the genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist had managed to drop the playboy part of that equation, replacing it first with father, then with husband.
Steve breathed in slowly, deliberately relaxing his shoulders. He'd been hoping that not even O'Brien would dare to stoop that low, but apparently even the small amount of credit that Steve had tried to grant him had been misplaced.
"Well, I'm sure we could get something brought here before that if you need it, Pete," Tony said as he meandered around the suite, running his palm along the polished wooden furniture and bright linen fabrics. "We wouldn't want you passing out in front of a king, would we?"
"Um‚Ä¶ I've gotta‚ÄîI need to use the bathroom, so‚Äî"
"But, sweetheart, I need to tell you‚Äî"
Steve's jaw clenched as he looked away, biting his lower lip as about a hundred different emotions bounced across his mind. "What, so you think I've just been using you? Tony, I
It felt almost surreal to watch as Ma and Sharon arranged all of Peter's medical equipment and IV lines onto his bed. Once everything was packed up, Sharon climbed up onto the bed next to Peter, manually pushing air into his breathing tube as Sam and Bucky guided the whole thing down the cleared-out hallways and elevator and into the procedure room that Howard and Colonel Phillips had set up in the basement. As soon as they stepped inside and caught sight of Howard, who was barking orders at a couple of electrical technicians like he'd been doing so his entire life, Tony flinched, his hand clutching Steve's so tightly that his fingers started to tingle.
"All right," Tony said, clearing his throat. "All pilots of the Phoenix aircraft, let's do a comm check."
Steve thought as he held out his arm for Tony‚Äîhis
"Oh man, I am definitely looking forward to that again," Bucky said as they exited the hangar, heading for the locker room. "That was incredible!"
üò£ = the angst is killing me!
‚ÄúTony, that doesn't mean that you don't need sleep,‚Äù Steve says gently.¬† He takes a small sip from his water bottle, grimacing as the ice-cold liquid hits his very empty stomach.¬† He suppresses another shiver, trying to keep his teeth from chattering.
"Maybe not all of it," Bucky cut in. "Stevie, there was a ton of stuff in there and Peter didn't have the energy to go through it all, so he just did some quick searches for a few keywords that we've been wondering about."
A huge thank-you to my awesome betas, allthesinnersandthesaints and jehbeeeh! üíñ
And, even worse, that they had taken his best friend, who Steve had believed to be dead since 1944, and brainwashed him into becoming the most lethal assassin of the last half century.
Steve just had to trust Tony. Which he did, implicitly. Then he had to come up with a new plan for the impending battle in Wakanda that didn't include him.
Tony repeated over and over as he clung to Steve‚Äôs arm like it was the only thing holding him upright.¬† Tony had been so shocked when Steve had told him he wanted to accompany him when he confronted Obie that for several moments afterwards, he actually could not speak.¬† Could only stare in awe at the incredible man in front of him, who would willingly risk his own still-fragile recovery to help Tony face the man he had once believed he loved more than his own father.
"Tony?" Steve cried as the transmission began to skip. "Sweetheart, please, be careful! I love‚Äî!"
"Tony, it's‚Äîit's Peter!" Steve choked out, his fingers curled around Tony's arm, clinging to him as if his very life depended on it. "I didn't‚ÄîI didn't catch him! I didn't‚Äîand then he
Peter raised an eyebrow, eyeing Steve warily. "Uhh, I just wanted to let you guys know that we're gonna be leaving soon. Auntie Carol said it was way past the time for Uncle James to get off his feet."
"So you think he'll fight back?"
"Uh huh. You gonna come and do history with me when you're done, Papa?"
Tony nodded, swallowing past the lump in his throat and attempting to smile at his husband, even as he knew Steve would be able to see right through it.
‚ÄúOkay, JARVIS, here we go,‚Äù he said.¬† ‚ÄúDo me a favour and find me the SI employee file for Regina Williams, will ya?‚Äù
"Oh, sure," Steve said. He stepped back, still holding onto Peter's hand as Sharon listened to his heart and lungs and checked his pulse, smiling and patting his shoulder once she was finished.
"Peter," Papa said sternly, or as sternly as he could with his ragged, pain-laced voice. "You shouldn't be here by yourself."
A lump the size of a marble rose in Tony's throat.
The Chitauri had finally returned.
"JARVIS, is Peter all right?" Steve asked, brushing soft kisses across Tony's temple and forehead.
"Master Peter is currently sleeping peacefully, Captain, with his vital signs within his normal parameters," JARVIS replied. "However, he did experience a short period of restlessness approximately forty-five minutes ago."
"Let's begin. Serum infusion beginning in five‚Ä¶ four‚Ä¶ three‚Ä¶ two‚Ä¶ one‚Ä¶ mark."
"Hey, I know guys that got engaged when they were seventeen and then got married on their eighteenth birthday," said Uncle Bucky. "Or knew, I guess. They're probably all dead by now."
‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶ the pharmaceutical scientists?‚Äù Pepper stammered.¬† ‚ÄúDid I hear you correctly?‚Äù
Steve tipped his head back against the headrest, lolling it sideways to look at Tony. "Well, we could always just build him a treehouse. I'm sure he wouldn't mind that."
am I here?"
sounded a lot more like Captain America instead of a panicking husband and father. Maybe Tony had actually managed to get through to him.
"That's our boy," said Steve. "JARVIS?"
Peter yelped. "I was out for another
‚ÄúOh God!‚Äù he sobbed into the back cushion of the couch, dabbing at his leaking eyes with the hem of his t-shirt.¬† ‚ÄúWhy?¬† Why‚Äôd it have to‚Äî?¬† Why did he have to‚Äî?‚Äù
Until they were able to meet with the SHIELD geneticist and hopefully get some answers for Peter's strange symptoms, Steve had a feeling there would be a lot more exploded eggs in his future.
What he wouldn‚Äôt give for a good deep-tissue massage right about now.¬† Maybe he could spring for one once he was done building the Jericho model.
If anything, they had gotten even worse. And that worried Tony.
And trying to get Uncle Bucky's name cleared was yet another thing causing Dad and Papa a bunch of stress, especially with the presidential election looming in just a few weeks. The sitting president was still very friendly to the Avengers, but according to the latest network predictions he wasn't currently doing well in the polls, and Peter knew that Dad and Papa were worried that he was going to lose the election.
"Yeah, sure, if you call sitting in a luxury box the size of your apartment and eating a five course meal, 'normal'," said Ned, rolling his eyes. "But anyway, I am glad that you weren't attacked by a monster again, that must've been so scary."
"Well, I'm just sorry that we didn't know what was going on," added Papa. "Maybe we could've helped?"
‚ÄúOh, you know,‚Äù Tony said with a shrug.¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs me.‚Äù
What he did know, though, was that aside from helping his ma, there's no way Steve would change anything that had happened.
If he had known ahead of time that this mission was going to involve him trekking through freezing-cold mountainous terrain, he might‚Äôve hesitated a bit before agreeing to Director Fury‚Äôs request.¬† It was putting it mildly to say that Steve was not too fond of the cold, and while the uniform he was wearing‚Äîmade by Tony‚Äôs own hands‚Äîwas insulated well enough, the crystal-clear skies above him combined with the fact that it was already well below zero could only mean that after dark the temperatures would plummet, leaving it dangerously cold even for him.
At least since it was a desert there weren't any bodies of water that he had to worry about, so hopefully little to no chance of being swallowed up by ice again. Ever since the incident at the lake Steve hadn't been able to bring himself to be immersed in water, something he knew hadn't escaped Tony and Peter's notice. Tony because he and Steve had taken to enjoying the occasional bath together over the summer at the Compound before that fateful afternoon, and Peter, well, mainly because he was so observant and perceptive that one could almost say he was empathic.
‚ÄúI've got you, honey, okay?¬† You're okay.¬† I‚Äôm here,‚Äù Tony added as he sent Steve‚Äôs tie flying to land on the jacket, quickly going to work on his shirt buttons.¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, Steve.¬† It‚Äôs gonna be okay.¬† I
"Just get him the hell outta there!" Tony cried. "Even Steve can't hold his breath forever!"
"Very good, sir."
"I do advise extreme caution, Master Peter," said JARVIS. "You are venturing into an unknown situation."
And often hidden in dark, spooky places.
"All right, that's enough," said their teacher as she stepped into the classroom. "Now then, who wants to begin the discussion regarding the formation of the European Union?"
"Bye," he called to Gwen as the truck pulled away. As soon as she was out of sight he slumped back against the seat, closing his eyes.
‚ÄúYeah, well, seeing as how I‚Äôm the CEO, and therefore outrank you, then I‚Äôm pretty sure
Bruce let out a frustrated groan as his screen suddenly flickered, erasing all the text on it. "No offence Tony, but can you leave me alone with this for a bit? I need to concentrate."
"Dad probably means the Spider-Man," said the oldest boy, causing Peter to freeze. "He really doesn't like him, even though I thought he was cool."
"Copy that," Steve said. "Once you're done head straight towards the main entrance and keep your eyes peeled. We're on our way now."
"How's it going, big guy?" he asked.
"'S all right, Papa?" he murmured.
There was no turning back now.
"His temp is climbing back up, it's just taking awhile," Bruce replied. "Since he can't regulate his body temp well the icy water dropped it really low really fast, but yeah, he'll be all right."
"No problem, kiddo."
"Yeah. They're both pretty cool."
"Steve," Tony said softly, cupping Steve's cheeks in his hands. "It's getting late, and you have another patrol in the morning. Why don't we just get back to the base, hmm? We can work all that out tomorrow?"
"Mmm, I'm not sure if that's any better," Tony grumbled. He actually liked Peter's girlfriend, especially since it was obvious that she adored him, but being the daughter of a deputy police chief, Gwen Stacy probably had access to plenty of information that wasn't readily available to just the average citizen, and the last thing that Tony needed was Peter finding stuff out secondhand.
"Son of a bitch!" Clint grunted as he stepped back to draw another arrow, aiming at the same spot. "This is like some kinda souped up vibranium ice or something!"
"Have we completely lost ya there, Scott?" Tony asked, shooting Steve a rather sly wink.
I swear this ass of yours was sculpted by those ancient Asgardian gods Thor's always going on about."
And, it would appear, twenty-eight years of rationing lifesaving medical care to those civilians. Especially civilians with the last name of Stark.
Stepping inside the room, Steve was greeted by a young boy, maybe ten or eleven years old, with probably the biggest and sweetest brown eyes that he had ever seen partially hidden by a mop of brown curls that hung across his forehead. The boy's skin was ghostly pale, nearly as white as the various bandages covering the three separate intravenous tubes attached to his skinny arms and neck, but he smiled politely as Steve approached him, letting out a weak, wet cough as he raised his hand to wave hello.
"You feel helpless," Gwen cut in. "And that's totally normal too, and anyone who thinks otherwise is just a big jerk."
Something in Rhodey's tone prompted Tony to look up at him, quirking an eyebrow.
About three seconds later a bluish holographic model of something that resembled a catalytic converter appeared in the open space next to Peter's bed. Tony's eyebrows knitted together as he walked slowly around it, running his fingers along his unkempt goatee as he tried to figure out how the thing was supposed to look.
If Rhodey thought Tony was bad at taking care of himself then Howard was at least a thousand times worse, and with no one else in the house to encourage him to clean up his empty whisky bottles or pick up his dirty clothes, Tony was fearing the worst.
"Good. Dismissed."
, so I had no choice but to pick him up. And then I tucked him to my chest, with his tiny head resting over my heart, and he grabbed onto my shirt with his little fist and fell asleep in about three minutes. And once he was out, Rhodey made sure that there were bottles and diapers within reach and took off. And then it was just the two of us. And I didn't let Pete out of my sight for longer than a few seconds until Rosa came to live with us."
‚ÄúI know exactly what you mean, sweetheart,‚Äù he whispered.
And no amount of begging, pleading, or bribing could get him to change his mind.
"Of course, Captain," replied JARVIS. "Your 0600 alarm has been deactivated."
And, even better, Peter didn't get sick either, finishing out his school year with straight A's, his position at the top of his class firmly in hand.
"Gladly, Colonel," replied Carol. "Steve, you think that‚Äî?"
Steve gave a nod, running his tongue over his bone-dry lips.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yes, yes, my dear, I've heard that story already," said Maria. "By the time you were sixteen you were already living on your own‚Äî"
"Good. 'Cause as much as I might like you, I'm not really in the mood to take a missile shot for you at the moment, is that clear?"
It wasn't easy to eat pasta and seasoned bread with only one hand, but Tony managed, finishing off his entire plate as he and Steve talked. It was yet another thing that fascinated him about Steve, he was just so easy to talk to. He listened without any hint of impatience or boredom, never tried to interrupt, and always asked such relevant and interesting questions that proved that he wasn't just giving Tony lip-service, he actually seemed to care about what he was saying.
Tony tapped his chin, giving Steve a quizzical look. "Nah, doesn't sound familiar. JARVIS?"
"Thanks, bud. Sleep well, yeah?"
They ended up making a total of ten pizzas, six of which were eaten by Peter, Papa, and Uncle Thor. Once everyone was done eating Peter helped Dad finish his work on Uncle Thor's new eye while Papa gave him a condensed version of the HYDRA prison battle, including a rundown of the upcoming criminal trials that were scheduled to begin by the end of the summer. Uncle Thor was also very interested to learn more about Wanda and Pietro Maximoff, who were spending the summer with Uncle Clint's sister-in-law and her family on their farm in rural Indiana. Once they all had arrived back in New York, Wanda confessed that she and Pietro had been held at the HYDRA prison for almost three years, so Papa worked it out with Director Fury that they would spend the summer quietly recuperating, then return to live at the Compound right before the school year started so they could both attend a local public school.
Of all the low, scum-of-the-earth ways to circumvent the failure of the Registration Act, this wasn't one that Tony ever saw coming.
"Facial recognition confirms one of the men to be Dr Stephen Strange, former head of neurosurgery at New York Hospital."
He managed to make it through the rest of his classes and Decathlon practise without further incident, although it took nearly every ounce of his strength to avoid launching his pen at Mr Harrington when he tried to give the team a pep talk towards the end. Peter was so used to his papa's amazing and inspiring pep talks that while he was sure Mr Harrington meant well, there was just no way that he could compare when all he could talk about were students puking before the competition.
"Dad," Peter croaked. "Dad, don't you think‚Äî?"
Family, not work, like Howard, and definitely not his social life, which, while occasionally fun, had really brought Tony more pain and embarrassment than anything.¬† The amount of times Tony had been fined or arrested for getting too drunk and causing damage at some chintzy nightclub out in Jersey was not something that he enjoyed remembering.
Tony let out a frustrated growl. "I said, we need to fix your ship so we can get off this goddamn rock."
"Okay, we're starting to get a bit off track here," Steve cut in. "Regardless of the laws of physics, obviously Mr Pym was able to create these particles way back in the eighties, right?"
"Are you just gonna spend the next two hours teasing me,
"Seems like you're a bit more than 'kinda' tired," Steve said as he took Peter's popcorn bowl. "C'mon, little guy. Time for bed."
Apparently you could take the super soldier out of the 1940s, but you couldn't take the 1940s out of the super soldier. And judging by the fact that Steve still tried to brush Tony off whenever he asked if he was okay, Steve still had a long way to go.
series.¬† He crouched down, intending to just glance past them, when one box in particular caught his eye.
"And you've finished all the diagnostics on the new Iron Legion suits?"
He just sometimes needed a reminder.
"Yep," Tony said firmly. "We're all kinds of stubborn."
And try to reign himself in. Because despite everything he'd tried to tell himself about keeping Steve at arm's length, at least at first, Tony could already tell that it was going to be much harder than he had anticipated.
"I will," replied Natasha. "And say hi to my –º–∏–ª–∞—è –æ—à–∏–±–∫–∞ for me."
"But it is, sweetheart, don't you see?" Steve said. "It's about both of you, and‚Äî"
No wonder the damn wizard wanted to keep a tight hold on it.
‚ÄúYay!‚Äù Peter said as they headed towards the door.¬† ‚ÄúHave a great night, Steve!¬† See ya tomorrow!‚Äù
"Yeah," Peter finally said, giving them both a huge, genuine smile. Because he meant it.
With a heavy sigh, Peter closed his laptop screen and hunched over, folding his arms on top of his stack of books as he struggled to keep his eyes open. He knew it was rude to not pay attention in class, but the honest truth was that he just didn't need to. Everything Ms Warren was discussing he already knew, and thanks to how often he got to work with Dad and Uncle Bruce on their stuff, he could probably even teach the class himself by now.
"Oh, thank you, Captain," he said through his mouthful. "I am
You know it‚Äôs 2020 when there‚Äôs as many currently named tropical storms/ hurricanes as I have children üòë.  I‚Äôm praying that everyone in the path of those storms, as well as the continuing wildfires, stays safe! üíñ
The project was now finished. Or at least as much as it could be until Dad could input it into his computer and test it out, but finished nonetheless.
"Mr Stark, if you would please continue," said Phillips.
But Steve only shook his head, like the damn stubborn soldier that he was. "I shouldn't have to rely on my son to help me, Tony. I'm the parent, and he's the child. It doesn't work that way."
‚ÄúRelieved, Papa?‚Äù Peter asked as he tucked his head down on Papa‚Äôs chest.
"And yet, these suits now remain in the possession of Stark Industries, rather than the Department of Damage Control," said Davis.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a damn good thing at least some of the schools are still teaching civics,‚Äù Steve‚Äôs customer suddenly said as he came up next to Tony.¬† ‚ÄúI swear, so many of these young people nowadays don‚Äôt even know the difference between the House of Representatives and the Senate!‚Äù
As if on cue, Peter felt his cheeks heating up. "I wasn't as red as a tomato‚Äî"
"Okay, well, we've still got a few more days before the targeting range will be up to snuff," said Tony. "When were they planning on taking off?"
Steve sighed, shifting slightly on the bed. "Yeah, she was. One of the strongest people I've ever met. Besides you and Peter, of course."
‚ÄúOh, yeah?‚Äù Tony snapped.¬† ‚ÄúWell, fuck you and your disgusting homophobia, Obadiah!¬† Fuck you for being a goddamn war profiteer who sold out his own country‚Äôs servicemen just so he could make a few extra bucks!¬† Don't you get it?¬† People are
"Thank you, Steve!" Sam gasped, his face ashen and streaked with tears. "Thank you for saving him!"
"Yeah," Peter whispered. "I can't wait." He glanced out his window, noticing that the sun was already dipping below the treeline in the distance. "It's gonna be dark soon, Dad."
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù answered Fury.¬† ‚ÄúThe main manifesto of HYDRA is to induce chaos, and there aren‚Äôt many places that have seen more chaos than that area.‚Äù
"Holy shit," Peter whispered as he practically ripped the glasses from his face, tossing them across the bed as he let his eyesight relax into its honeycomb-like state. The shiny object reappeared, clearer this time, and moving parallel to the ground, almost as if it was circling something.
"Nah, not too much," answered Ned. "Flash got a new car for his sixteenth birthday, he keeps posting all these dramatic instagram stories bragging about it."
"Tony!" Steve cried over the comm. "Tony, tell me‚Äî!"
"Uh huh." Peter gave a sigh as he leaned back against the seat, briefly closing his eyes. He wished he could be more excited about the dance, especially since Gwen seemed to be, but at the moment all he could think about was the fact that Papa wasn't going to be there to see him get ready, and that it seemed almost wrong for him to be having fun while his papa was missing.
Materials that Tony would only be able to obtain if his proposal was absolutely foolproof, and then only if General O'Brien happened to be in a good enough mood once he presented it.
‚ÄúAh,‚Äù said Steve, just as softly as he snuck a glance up at Tony.¬† ‚ÄúBut not your dad, hmm?‚Äù
Tony had just finished turning Peter onto his opposite side and readjusting his pillows when JARVIS spoke up. "Pardon me, sir, but Dr Banner is requesting your presence in the laboratory. Captain Rogers is already there."
General O'Brien cleared his throat, his expression one of thinly veiled amusement mixed with suspicion.
I‚Äôm sorry üòû but this had to happen.  Steve just couldn't go on like nothing was wrong anymore.
"You keep that bouncing up and you're gonna end up drilling yourself right through the ground," Bucky said. He clamped a hand on Steve's shoulder, putting a halt to his nervous fidgeting. "What the hell, Stevie? You went to space twice and you weren't this jittery."
As soon as he stepped through the doors, Peter began a silent countdown, smirking when the two security guards fell into step behind him exactly eight seconds later.¬† Happy always liked to brag that his guards were invisible, that they blended it, and Peter had never had the heart to tell him that they just didn't.¬† All were big, burly, broad-shouldered guys at least six feet tall, many with previous NFL or WWE experience, who wore all-black suits with white shirts and black neckties, like they had just been teleported from the
Peter smiled tiredly. Papa's stovetop hot cocoa was practically legendary in the Tower, and something that he never turned down.
"All right. And what about you, Buck?" Steve asked as he clapped a hand on Bucky's right shoulder. "You still okay with all this?"
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the theory,‚Äù says Tony.¬† ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs just scratching the surface.¬† The possibilities could literally be endless with something like that.‚Äù
He just needed to
"Yes, especially the boots," Steve said softly. "I wish you'd try and get some sleep. You look tired."
Tony could almost hear their scoffing now. "
He could‚Äôve easily passed for one of Peter‚Äôs security guards.¬† Not exactly the type who would usually be found in a bookstore.
They had returned from Italy three days before, just in time to celebrate Peter's seventeenth birthday with the rest of the team. As usual, everyone had spoiled him rotten, showering him with gifts of Lego sets, more geeky t-shirts from Bruce, an authentic set of Asgardian armour from Thor, and, probably his most favourite gift of them all, a wooden and crystal chess set made by Noj Dubrovnik, one that Natasha ordered custom-made from Russia just for her precious –º–∏–ª–∞—è –æ—à–∏–±–∫–∞.

‚ÄúOkay?¬† So?¬† That doesn't mean that‚Äî‚Äù
"Okay," Peter said. "Thank you."
name on the side of the building.¬† And that means there‚Äôs absolutely
"All right," Steve said after a short pause. "Is there any way JARVIS can find out who accessed this information?"
"So, anyway, I was thinking," Peter said to Gwen as they slowly shuffled out of the gym after practise. Peter had to admit that he was getting excited for the big competition, as Gwen had proven herself to be just as capable of a captain as Liz and their team was really whipping into shape.
Papa‚Äôs eyebrows knitted together as he buried his long fingers into his hair.¬† ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs almost exactly what I told them!¬† I told them I needed to get away from there and try to forget about all of it!‚Äù
"No!" Peter squeaked, once again chomping down hard on his bottom lip. He had witnessed his dads arguing plenty of times, as they both could be stubborn as hell when they wanted to be. But the thought of them actually coming to blows, of physically
Thankfully, by the time Uncle Sam's car pulled into the school's parking lot on Friday afternoon, Peter's mood had brightened to the point where he was practically vibrating with excitement. Gwen had stored her stuff in the school's office all day, and was now clutching the handle of her small suitcase, her other hand threaded through Peter's arm.
"Eh, it's technically his house, but it‚Äôs more like he lives with us," Peter said as his huge brown eyes clouded over with sadness. "He and my dad don't really get along all that great, but‚Ä¶ he's old, and he doesn't have anywhere else to go, so‚Ä¶" He paused, biting his full bottom lip as he shook his head. "I don't really wanna talk about it anymore."
Steve sputtered out a laugh. "Tony‚Äî"
Unfortunately, Steve knows all too well what that‚Äôs like.¬† He‚Äôs been like that for almost an entire year now.
The mission is here!
Peter gave him a rather sheepish grin, shrugging. "Well‚Ä¶ I added a bit more stuff about the use of vaccines in soldiers during the war, since you and Papa both mentioned being given a whole bunch of shots before you were shipped out on your assignments. And then‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ there's just so much interesting stuff out there about how they used to treat common illnesses and injuries that was just totally, like,
loudly, shifting from foot to foot.
Peter shrugged. "Other than a bunch of frozen plains and a couple HYDRA facilities, not too much."
"That's not what he wants," he murmured. "All he wants is to be a normal kid. To go to school, and climb trees, and have sleepovers with his friends. He never wanted to be a hero, Steve. All he wanted was a chance to just be a kid."
"Mmm," said Dr Strange. "See, Stark? I do know how to fight."
"Yeah, you're probably right," Steve agreed. He cupped Tony's cheek in one hand, brushing a soft kiss across his lips. "Were you able to fix Bucky's arm?"
The real question was: what exactly could he
"Pete, is that you? What the hell are you doing?" Dad yelled as he flew by, aiming blast after blast at the suit he was tailing. Dad's armour was dented and covered with dings and bullet holes, and looked to be on the verge of completely losing power. From Peter's perspective, he definitely needed the help.
Steve reached for Peter's shoulder, giving it a gentle squeeze. "Absolutely," he said. "We can come every single night if you want us to."
"Do you know when he's coming back yet?" asked Gwen. "He's been gone for a while already, hasn't he?"
"Uh huh," Peter whispered, gulping. "I know."
Maybe he should take up boxing, in addition to his daily runs.
"Really?" Steve said excitedly. "I thought we could even invite the rest of the team if you want, it might actually help distract Peter a bit if we did‚Ä¶ you know‚Ä¶ so‚Ä¶"
Steve pleaded, rapidly gulping air. "What if‚Äî?"
Steve's eyebrows knitted together as he brought his hands to his waistband, untying the drawstring. "Um‚Ä¶ okay, but I thought that‚Äî" He paused when he noticed Tony reaching for a light blue bottle on the bedside table, recognising it as the same cream that he had applied to Steve's sunburned skin on their honeymoon. "Oh. Sweetheart, you don't have to do that, it'll probably heal up on its own in a few hours, so‚Äî"
in the mood to listen to another one now.¬† Gingerly, he takes hold of Tony‚Äôs shoulders, turning him to face him.¬† ‚ÄúNow, I‚Äôm only gonna say this once, because that‚Äôs the only time that‚Äôll need to be said, all right?¬† This.¬† Is.¬† Not.¬† Your.¬† Fault.¬† So, as your Captain, I do not want to hear even another peep about it.¬† Is that understood?‚Äù
"Yeah, that's right," answered Tony. "Unless the employee holds a personal patent on something, anything they've worked on or developed is considered to be Stark Industries property."
"I don't know, babe. I'd hate to give Barton any inclination that he was actually right here, but‚Äî"
"I'm gonna give you back to your dad now, kiddo, okay?" Rhodey said. "Promise me that you'll take it easy?"
"Okay, well, Captain Rogers is correct," said Anthony. "The X-302 aircrafts are the first to use the new arc reactor propulsion systems, and judging from what I've seen and by your daily flight reports, they seem to be performing well."
"Yeah, and he can concern all he wants, but she's still gonna end up going," Peter said bitterly. "'Cause once she gets in, not even her dad's gonna be able to say no. I mean, how could he? It's Oxford!" He sniffed as the waitress set their overflowing floats down in front of them, his eyes burning with tears as he tried to unwrap his straw with shaking fingers. Apparently he was still a lot more upset about it than he'd thought.
"No, sir," said Papa. "Thank you, sir."
"Yeah, it was probably either left over from Zola or someone who was working with him," replied Tony. "And we never really did break into Zola's algorithm for Project Insight, we only got the info on the Winter Soldier through a tiny back door, so‚Ä¶"
Standing to his feet, Tony pulled out his phone. "JARVIS, exactly how much does Mr Lang here owe in back child support?"
"Eh, I can see why it'd be attractive," said Tony. "I know one of the things that Pete misses the most is being able to play outside. I'm sure one of the first things he'll do after his surgery and recovery is try to climb up a tree."
He broke off then, his lower lip shaking. "I can't‚ÄîI can't go through that again, Steve, and neither can Pete. We just
And once we do, we're gonna kick HYDRA's ass so hard that they'll regret ever trying to hook their claws into any of us. All right?"
Tony thought, frowning as he glanced back up at the wormhole. While the flow of Chitauri had slowed down a bit, they were still steadily coming, and would likely continue until their supply was exhausted‚Äînot likely‚Äîor until Thanos decided to try something else.
"And does that sound like something you'd like?"
"Eh, I'm doing okay," Peter said as he rubbed at his nose. "I finished my drawing of Mrs Bird and her chicks yesterday, do you wanna see it?"
what he wanted to find, and Peter's patience was rapidly approaching its breaking point.
The dim image of the Georgia coastline suddenly appeared on Peter's laptop, not much more than waves crashing against rocks and the occasional seagull.
The door to the store was locked when Tony pushed on the door handle, not too surprising since Steve didn't open until noon on Mondays.¬† He tried knocking on the window, thinking that if Steve was in the back or something he‚Äôd still be able to hear him.¬† When no answer came after the third loud knock, Tony pulled out his phone and dialled Steve‚Äôs number, his heart hammering as he waited for him to answer.
They had celebrated Steve's birthday a few days ago, his ninety-sixth‚Äîor thirty-second, however one chose to look at it. After a huge dinner and dessert that Peter had prepared almost all by himself, Tony and Peter had presented Steve with a brand-new Harley-Davidson motorcycle, a 1958 Duo Glide model that was nearly identical to the bike Tony had given Steve for his ninety-second birthday, shortly before the Malibu house was bombed. Ever since then, Tony had searched far and wide for another like-new Duo Glide with no success, and had finally just ended up commissioning the people at Harley-Davidson itself to custom-build one for him.
"Tony?"
Tony threaded his fingers through Steve's hair, massaging his scalp with his fingertips. "If it were anyone else, I'd tell you that you didn't have to worry," he murmured. "I'd tell you that I was absolutely certain that it'll work because I've always been able to get my stuff to work."
"That's not for sure yet, little guy," Papa said. "Chief Stacy has a lot of concerns about her being so far away, and‚Äî"
Peter thought, shaking his head to try and clear it.
"No, I don't, little guy," Steve murmured into his son's wild hair. "But you don't need to worry about me, okay? You just try and have a good day today."
As soon as the screen went blank, Steve huffed out a sharp breath, dropping his chin to his chest. All unique perspectives aside, the disaster they were currently going through wasn't anything that Steve had even ever imagined, much less experienced. World War II had disrupted a good deal of the known civilised world back in the day, but this‚Ä¶ this was something else.
"And that right there is exactly the problem, Steve! You don't understand! You can't see what you're doing to yourself, but I can, and honey, it's not good! And it just keeps getting worse!"
Breaking the world record would sure be a nice cherry on top of a gold medal.
The first trip had had Steve reliving the day Director Fury and Agent Coulson presented him with the mission to rescue Tony and Peter in Afghanistan. Steve had been only a few days out of the ice then, and still so confused and sad about nearly everything that was happening that he'd been unable to sleep, scared that he would somehow wake up and find himself back in the ice. Tony had felt awful after that one, telling Steve multiple times that he had intended to capture the time where Steve discovered them in the middle of the desert when he'd saved Peter's life, but his calculations had been just slightly off. Steve had brushed him off, telling Tony it wasn't his fault, but it had been more difficult to let go of than Steve had wanted to let on, making his already-touchy mood even more so.
"Rhodey, how many more?"
"That's 'cause that's exactly what he's doing," Bruce cut in. He looked up at Tony, who nodded in apparent agreement. "It's like his skin is losing its cohesion, and his cell membranes are just‚Ä¶ dissolving."
‚ÄúAh, Earth to Tony?‚Äù¬† Obie snapped his fingers in front of Tony‚Äôs nose, sending his heart into his throat.¬† ‚ÄúYou still with me here?‚Äù
Tony couldn't even bear to attempt to think about it objectively because there was just no way he could lose Peter and survive. No way at all. The fact that the country would also lose one of its top minds was a very, very distant second.
"Yeah, Sam, thanks," said Steve. He released Tony, sucking in a deep, shaky breath as he glanced down at Bucky and Peter. "Go ahead."
"Yeah, and something tells me that HYDRA doesn't exactly allow their scientists to resign," said Steve.
"Absolutely no harm in doing that," said Tony. "But even so, I'm sure Pepper's mentioned something to you about my modern art collection that's just sitting in storage, hasn't she? It's worth millions, but both of our homes are completely decked out in Steve Rogers originals because I like 'em better."
‚ÄúThen that includes this.‚Äù¬† Steve jerked his head, referring to his uniform.¬† ‚ÄúTony, I haven't worn this since I got out because I was trying so hard to forget I‚Äôd ever served in the first place‚Äî‚Äù¬† He broke off, swallowing against the rising knot in his throat.¬† ‚ÄúBut now‚Ä¶ knowing what I know‚Ä¶ I feel like I owe it to them.¬† I owe it to all of my teammates that got hurt or were killed over there in Sokovia because of the pathological greed of the very people who should‚Äôve been trying to protect them the most!‚Äù
If Dad and Steve's date went well enough, then maybe they'd even end up getting married someday. Uncle James had told Peter a while ago that he was planning to propose to Auntie Carol soon, once he was able to work up the courage, and Peter knew that the Air Corps strongly encouraged their pilots‚Äîespecially their test pilots‚Äîto marry and have families since it gave them some semblance of stability in their pretty unstable lives.
"And you are correct, the Air Corps hasn't yet developed any sort of rocket fuel. The propulsion system for the space flight engine is of a completely new design, and one that I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to divulge at the moment."
But at least now he smelled better.
Tony wound his arms around Steve's neck, tugging him down for another kiss.
To Tony's relief it wasn't Phillips who stepped inside the cramped, overstuffed office, it was Rhodey, his face falling as he took in Tony's disheveled appearance.
Steve‚Äîwas missing.¬† Presumed to be kidnapped by HYDRA, an organisation that was supposed to be dead.
"All right," said Steve. He grabbed onto a piece of pipe sticking out from what used to be a utility shed, pulling himself up on top of it as he scanned the area. "Tony, there's one more coming up on your three o'clock, and Clint‚Äî"
"I will." Peter sat back against his pillows as Ms Sharon exited his room, her word choice hitting him about three seconds after she'd closed the door.
‚ÄúKeep your eyes peeled out there, yeah, Barton?‚Äù Tony adds as Clint heads for another tree.¬† ‚ÄúSteve says those cannons pack a wallop.‚Äù
If anything, it had grown.
It honestly wouldn't shock Steve too much if that were the case.
‚ÄúThanks!‚Äù Peter exclaims between his heaving breaths, which thankfully aren‚Äôt progressing into the tell-tale chest tightness he always feels right before he starts wheezing.
At least, he was until Tony started going over the details of Beck's proposal. As soon as Tony uttered the words CTX-616, all the colour drained from Steve's face and he grabbed Tony's hand, squeezing it hard.
Tony huffed, reaching for Steve with grabby hands. "Then get back down here, hot stuff. I need to touch you."
And Tony needed to be ready for it.
Tony knew that it wasn't completely over yet. While several arrests had already been made in the couple of days since the battle against the Chitauri-enhanced Hammer suits and most of the remaining HYDRA agents were on the run, Tony knew that it was going to be awhile before things managed to get back to some semblance of normal. The fact that the Secretary of Agriculture was currently the acting President of the United States was just one example of how deeply HYDRA's roots had managed to take hold inside the U.S. government, with many of the other major world powers experiencing similar fallouts in their own governments once the news stories started coming out.
Tony was not the kind of drunken, fucked-up father that Howard had been.¬† He was breaking the cycle of shame.
"Okay, and you still love him, right?" asked Peter. "Your accident didn't change that?"
"Don't worry, Tony," he said softly. "Your secret is safe with me." Guilt sparked in his gut, just for a second before he was able to squash it down. Steve was very adept at keeping secrets, but it didn't take a Tony Stark-level genius to figure out that keeping a big secret from someone you were trying to begin a relationship with was probably not the best idea.
"Ah, it's okay," said Peter. "She and Uncle James are pretty smooshy too, they just don't show it as much as you guys do."
"She's not my girlfriend!"
SHIELD's mobile offices were only about a hundred or so metres away, set up inside a series of high-security trailers, the outside of which was being guarded by two tall, bald women wearing dark red armour and carrying long, pointed spears. Steve was still about five metres away when the two women snapped to attention, crossing their spears in front of the main trailer's entrance.
And now, Dad was being tormented in his dreams with an eighth, the worst of them all.
"The cop, Stacy, he's keeping an eye on –°—Ç–∏–≤ while we try to figure out how to get him outta his box," said Uncle Bucky. "But by my count, we've still got about ten or so of these damn things left so it might be awhile."
Even as his body was soon begging for more.
"Sam said probably in a couple of hours, but you know how Pete gets when he's at stuff like that. As long as he has a running supply of food, I could see them staying until they close for the night."
Several heartbeats passed before Steve‚Äôs pain-addled mind was able to catch up with Doctor List‚Äôs proclamation, and all of the ramifications behind it.
Which just made it even better.
"Uhh, yeah?" asked Tony. "What'd they find?"
‚ÄúNow, Captain,‚Äù he said, shaking his head as though he were admonishing a struggling student.¬† ‚ÄúI am sure you are aware of how impolite it is to not acknowledge someone who is speaking to you?¬† Surely your dear mother taught you better manners than that?‚Äù
"Hmm. Well, I guess we'll see if she's as smart as they‚Äî"
Suddenly one of the largest missiles that Steve had ever seen appeared from somewhere off his left wing, hitting the enemy aircraft square on its underbelly barely a second before it would've impacted the nose of his X-302. Steve cried out in shock as he yanked hard on his stick, managing to avoid the worst of the resulting explosion just in time as he scanned the skies for the aircraft that had saved him.
"We are indeed, Captain," said JARVIS. "The first satellite deployment will occur in exactly three minutes and thirty-five seconds from my mark. Mark."
With a heavy sigh, Tony climbed out of the car and headed towards the house, hoping that at least Howard would be passed out or something so Tony wouldn't feel compelled to acknowledge him. He'd only decided to brave going home in the first place because he didn't feel like going on his first date in almost a decade wearing a two-day-old cadet's uniform. Such a gorgeous man as Steve Rogers deserved for Tony to at least smell like he hadn't been living in his tiny office for the past two weeks.
"Well, we'll be out on the baseball field if you change your mind," Bucky said. "Enjoy your drive."
"Yeah, I guess I can see that." Sam let out a heavy sigh, shaking his head. "I dunno, it all just kinda sucks though."
"Is everyone all right?" Steve asked quickly. "Was anyone hurt?"
"Shh, honey," Tony whispered. He turned his head just enough to cup Steve's cheek. "It's okay, I'm here. I love you, and I'm always gonna be here."
‚Äîhe didn't realise he was pouring it way too fast until the burning hot coffee sloshed over the rim of the cup, dribbling down over his fingers.
Tony's heart gave a flutter as he looked into Steve's gorgeous blue eyes, those eyes that were a clear window deep into his soul. He was still sometimes taken aback by how much love he saw in those eyes, even during the smallest of passing glances. He knew that he shouldn't be. Steve had demonstrated his love for both Tony and Peter too many times to count. But Tony still couldn't help it.
"No, I don't imagine he does," Dad said as he ducked back behind his workstation. "Just give me a minute here, and‚Ä¶"
It had been about a week or so after they had all returned to the Malibu house from Afghanistan. Peter had been helping Steve get accustomed to life in the twenty-first century, while Tony had been spending nearly all of his time down in his garage workshop, building the first of his eventual army of armoured suits and plotting his revenge on the Ten Rings. Steve and Peter had made dinner that evening, and, after practically dragging Tony upstairs to eat with them, Peter had then proceeded to beg him to watch a movie afterwards, telling him that he hadn't seen him more than a few minutes since they'd been back.
"Sounds good," Steve answered, strong and clear. "Takeoff in T-minus three minutes."
"When can I see you again?" Steve rasped as he pressed his forehead to Tony's. "Tomorrow night? Please?"
"I know it," Tony whispered, wiggling his hips. "And you can start by opening me up now."
"I didn't," Ned replied. "Mom didn't know, only that she's the daughter of a new deputy police chief."
Steve reached for Tony's hand as soon as Peter was out of earshot, his face etched in worry. "Tony, he's acting like he has to prove something to someone."
"What's he coming up for?" Peter added, squinting at his laptop screen as he added a missed apostrophe. Papa was out running with Uncle Sam, and Dad was on yet another emergency conference call with the Department of Damage Control, and it wasn't like Uncle Bucky to just ask to come up without being invited.
"And hopefully back again, correct, Mr Stark?" Steve asked.
"Yeah, yeah, that's what I figured," muttered Tony. "JARVIS?"
"Not leaving here until I do," Tony said firmly. He cupped his son's greyishly pale face, planting a quick kiss to his forehead. "Go with Uncle Sam now, buddy, he'll take care of you."
"What?" exclaimed Steve. "But the trial mission was still sanctioned by the government, so I don't understand how‚Äî!"
‚ÄúGood afternoon, gentlemen,‚Äù a nice, blonde-haired lady says as Peter and Dad step inside.¬† ‚ÄúYou must be the Starks?‚Äù
"Yes," said Tony as he took Steve's elbow. "We shall."
He should've guessed that everything would start going to shit as soon as Steve took off. With absolutely no indications that anything was out of the ordinary, Tony had suspected that O'Brien and his lackeys were hoping to lure everyone into a false sense of security before bombarding them with everything they could throw at them as soon as all the pilots were airborne. The fact that O'Brien had even attempted to make it look like it was Meridia who was causing all the trouble was almost funny, since Tony now knew that there was no goddamn way anyone could've gotten a hold of his X-302 design unless someone had specifically given it to the enemy.
"Go and see your kid, Tony, that's an order," Phillips said. "Tonight or tomorrow night, I don't give a damn which, but I'm not going to authorise those simulations as ready until you do. Is that clear?"
Meaning that Thanos and his minions were now being forced to search for the Soul Stone the old-fashioned way. By digging for it.
"What if we don't need that final variable?"
of Clint‚Äôs arrows as they fly through the dry, frigid air, each landing directly into their intended targets.
Peter sniffed, pushing his glasses up his nose as he shoved his hands into his pockets. He wanted to tell Gwen what was wrong‚Äîwell, actually, that wasn't quite the truth. What he
Tony wished he could've been a fly on the wall during the tongue-lashing Howard got from Aunt Peggy once he got home, though. He's pretty sure it would've helped him feel a bit better.
Tony‚Äôs bottom lip started to shake.¬† ‚ÄúThat may be,
I need you inside me!"
"Maybe," said Steve. "But based on what you've told me about the armament that group was packing, I'm not sure if we would've been able to get you both out alive. You said they had enough of your weapons to supply a small country."
this thing just doesn't wanna give up the ghost!" Clint grumbled as he fired yet another electric arrow at the monster, managing to hit its arm just as it was about to slam into Tony. Tony quickly doubled back as the creature roared, hitting it with his repulsors but still not managing to cause enough damage to destroy it.
Slowly, Steve withdrew his fingers, chuckling as Tony immediately grabbed for his shoulders, pulling him up for a deep, sloppy kiss. "You gonna fuck me now,
From what Steve could see, Thanos had not yet arrived in this Wakanda, just as Thor's arrival had preceded Thanos in their own universe.
"Very good, sir. I am sure Master Peter will be most grateful."
"Those 'ole Dodgers play all the way across the country now, and they didn't even make the playoffs," said Sam. "So why don't you just quit your whining and let me gloat for a bit here."
Tony‚Äôs hand was shaking so hard as he reached into the inside pocket of his jacket that he could barely grab hold of it.
"No!" he said in the best rendition of his Captain's voice that he could muster. "I won't‚ÄîI won't do it! I won't fight him, so you may as well let him go!"
Steve no longer had to hide, to run from himself.¬† Away from everything that made him who he was.
As usual, Steve had been absolutely right. This vacation, the almost three glorious weeks they had spent in Italy with Peter so far, had been just what the three of them had needed to help recover from the pure hell of the last year. The estate was private enough to keep them hidden from reporters and any other overly-curious people, and yet, thanks to the fully-stocked kitchen and regular grocery deliveries, Steve and Peter could still cook and bake to their hearts' content, all while completely spoiling Tony rotten in the process.
And even more so if it was preventable.
"And she likes you?"
‚ÄúAh, here we are, sir,‚Äù JARVIS said a couple minutes later.¬† Tony blinked as the first page of a file appeared on his screen, frowning as he noticed the harsh black lines striking out most of the text.
The monster roared again, drowning out any reply that Steve might have made. "Skin to skin contact," he muttered as he quickly laid Peter across his lap, shrugging out of his leather jacket and t-shirt before tearing Peter's Spider-Man suit right down the front, exposing his skinny chest. He then gathered Peter close, chest to chest, wrapping his jacket around Peter's back like a blanket and tucking his head under his chin.
It reminds him of that
And Peter, the son he loved more than his own life, was not only healed, he was a national hero.
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just say that they‚Äôre way above your pay grade, and leave it at that,‚Äù Fury said.¬† ‚ÄúAnd since we don‚Äôt know how far up this thing goes yet, I‚Äôd be extra careful about where you open ‚Äòem.‚Äù
Tony loved Steve way too much to be able to turn his back on him.¬† And so did Peter.
"Which is exactly how it should be, little guy," Papa said in his Captain's voice. He shot Dad a goofy look before laying his hand across his knee. Papa never liked it when Dad talked about himself like that, which he only tended to do when he was especially stressed out. The debriefing must not have gone very well.
Even the news that Loki's sceptre had been taken had been kept a secret, with the official word from Director Fury being that a malfunctioning, out-of-control satellite crash was to blame for the attack up at the Compound.
Including, and probably most of all, himself.
Steve cleared his throat, still trying to work all of the non-existent water out of his airway.
And instead of the mental freakout that he would've expected after such a groundbreaking revelation, Tony only felt peace.
Nebula frowned, tossing her sister a concerned glance. "I believe it to be very important."
A slight smile stretched across Carol's lips. "Well, 'cause that's me. I was Avenger."
"Well, anyway," Betty said after a rather awkward pause. "Anyone up for a game of Clue?"
"Oh gods, baby, you know I'll do anything for you." Tony gasped as Steve's lips reached his pelvis and his aching erection, pressing small kisses all along its length before taking him into his mouth. The moan that escaped from Tony's throat was loud and wanton, his fingers burying into Steve's thick blond hair as Steve trailed his calloused fingertips all along his sides and hips, pleasure bursting through his body like fireworks.
"Um, I've probably got one in my room somewhere," Peter said. "Do you need‚Äî"
"Stevie," said Uncle Bucky. "'Cause I'm pretty sure if he were here right now that he'd say the exact same thing."
There was a three heartbeat or so pause while Mr Harrington glanced between Peter and Papa, his face finally drawing back into his exaggerated
‚ÄúYeah, Tony!¬† I kinda figured that out!‚Äù Steve snaps, a bit too harshly when Tony‚Äôs eyes go wide.¬† ‚ÄúSorry, I didn't‚ÄîI mean‚Äî‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, for one thing, you‚Äôve got those big purple circles under your eyes and that greyish look to your face that you only get when you're super tired,‚Äù Peter began, pointing at Tony with his spoon.¬† ‚ÄúAnd two, your shirt‚Äôs on backwards.‚Äù
‚ÄúOkay, so?¬† It was still a publicity stunt!¬† Just a little kid‚Äôs fantasy that happens to be a fairly decent tax shelter!‚Äù barked Obie.¬† ‚ÄúBut for some reason that I cannot understand, you‚Äôve turned it into something that‚Äôs trying to take over our real reason for existence!‚Äù
Almost.
"Or even a roof," Steve said with wide eyes. "Thor would probably try and light the stove with his hammer, and then‚Äî"
"All right," Peter said. "How?"
"Mmm, you and your plans‚Äîoh
"No, don't be doing that," Howard cut in. "Maybe this'll be what he needs to finally get over all that nonsense about the dark. The boy is six, he shouldn't be still‚Äî"
"We're not going to lose him. It's gonna be okay. He's gonna be okay."
Tony didn't only love Steve with all of his heart and soul and everything else he had in him, he felt
Stunned silence fell across the area, with the smooth, calm lake an ironic expression of serenity now that the battle was over, but Steve was anything but serene as he reached for his husband again.
"Yeah, and I told you that it's not gonna happen!" the man continued. "Those goddamn flying suits of his are making it impossible to get anything!"
Steve thought, the only words his mind seemed capable of forming.
"Come in?" a small voice responded, weak and timid.
"I said, it's not unfair," Peter repeated. "Papa didn't ask to be frozen like he was. He thought he was gonna die when he crashed that plane."
Steve dropped his chin to his chest, his thumb trailing across the back of Tony's hand as shame welled up inside Tony's gut. The last thing Tony wanted was for Steve to feel guilty about being arrested and tortured by the very same organisation he had sought to destroy for most of his adult life, but if there was anything that that godawful month had taught Tony, it was that Steve was a vital part of his very being, and that he would literally shrivel up to nothingness without him.
Peter thought, rather grumpily.
"Yeah, I know." Steve had even checked in on his ma just the previous afternoon after leaving the hospital with the intention of telling her all about Tony, only to spend the entire hour or so he was there trying to fix a broken door on one of her kitchen cabinets.
Satisfied with the drawing‚Äîfor the moment, at least‚ÄîPeter flipped towards the front of the notebook, rereading the code lines he'd finished writing after Grandpa had left for the afternoon. He had been adding bits and pieces of information to JARVIS' code ever since Dad had told him that he'd gotten him uploaded, and he was hoping to give these latest upgrades to Dad before the extra-atmospheric test missions began. Dad had told Peter that Steve had gotten the highest scores of his entire team during the simulations, which meant that he and two others would be heading out on one of their trial missions soon. And while Peter knew that Steve was really smart and could no doubt perform the complex calculations that he'd need to do on an actual mission, if he could figure out how to have JARVIS monitor the calculations for him and his two teammates, Peter thought that would be even better.
"But you didn't break up with him, right?"
"Except that's not something currently up for debate, buddy," Dad retorted. "Deal with it."
"I guess I'm okay with it as long as we can station guards by the theatre," Papa finally said. He glanced back to look at Peter. "But only if Uncle Bucky can go with you, so you'll still need to ask him."
"Goddamnit, JARVIS, what the hell's taking so long!" Tony snapped just as his frozen ears picked up the sound of his suit flying towards them, followed by the tell-tale
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs so awesome!‚Äù Peter murmured as he studied the drawings, which were obviously drawn freehand with the oil-based markers that worked so well on glass.¬† Whoever had drawn them was obviously very talented.
"Yes. It's hard to maintain a working civilian government when you're constantly giving in to the military. From what I was able to learn from my father, even the president's own top general tried to advise him against certain things, but he either wouldn't or couldn't listen."
"Shh," Steve said again, weaving his fingers into Tony's hair. "Peter's stronger than both of us, sweetheart. It's why Stane was so afraid of him, and why HYDRA targeted him. But it's also the very same reason why he'll be able to get through this. And once he does, he'll be free of them forever. I know it hurts, but we have to let him do this. We have to let him show how strong he is."
you, Papa!"
‚ÄúThere's a spare office two doors down from here,‚Äù Tony said quickly.¬† ‚ÄúTake as much time as you need.‚Äù
"Well, that's definitely the truth," Peter muttered. "Not like it's been driving Papa bonkers lately or anything."
Tony yelled, shoving Steve backwards so hard that he stumbled backwards into the fence, with Tony taking advantage of his momentary disorientation to aim a series of repulsor shots at the creature to distract it just before diving down into the frigid water.
Steve shushed him with another kiss, sloppy and wet as he kicked off his pants, pleasure shooting through him like bolts of lightning. "You still haven't told me what you want, sweetheart."
Peter scowled behind his mask, his shoulders sagging.
Steve grinned, almost involuntarily. He and Sam usually ate breakfast together after their runs, with Tony and Peter joining them most of the time as well before they brought Peter to school. Just another way to ensure that Tony ate something other than coffee every now and then.
"Uh huh!" Securing his web, Peter grabbed onto Thanos' fingers, grunting as he tried to get them to uncurl. "We gotta get his fist open!"
"Well‚Ä¶ it's not so much what he did, it's just‚Ä¶" Pepper paused, tapping her pen against the desk. "He submitted a proposal for a new project a couple of weeks ago, and after I looked it over‚Ä¶ I don't know, I had a couple of the other R&D supervisors look at it too, and they're not quite sure either, but it just seems‚Äî"
A three or so heartbeat pause followed before JARVIS answered.
Grabbing the blanket he'd set aside for the picnic, Steve hurried out of his room and headed down the hallway toward the mess hall, finding the usual array of sandwiches, bags of chips, and fruit that were the typical diet staples of the evening and overnight patrol crews.
"Yeah, yeah, can't forget the troubleshooting." Phillips handed the papers back to Tony, tilting his head. "Will that give you enough time to go and see your kid too?"
‚ÄúEh, I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs about time for you to get to bed, buddy,‚Äù Tony said.¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs after eleven already, and‚Äî‚Äù
He had tried to die to stamp them out, after all.
Whenever he was well enough to be outside, that is.
Grabbing his polar bear, Peter stuffed the plush animal under his chin as he took out his History textbook and opened his laptop, getting to work on the essay he was writing about the origins of the Civil Rights movement.
"I think that's a great idea," Peter said. He gave Dad a big hug, then reached for Papa, burying his nose into his neck. "Promise me that you'll listen to Dad and actually rest, okay? Even super soldiers need to heal."
Tony's throat tightened as his eyes filled with tears. "No, not exactly. I‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ I just told him I needed some time. To think. Buddy, he
"Move in where?" asked Peter as he lifted his head, his eyebrows scrunched together. "We got a new house?"
"Tony," Strange said, causing Tony to startle so hard that he bumped his nose on Peter's head. Slowly, he turned, catching Strange's eye just as he began to break apart. "There was no other way."
"That's not exactly what I'm worried about, Tony," said Steve. "If that drug gets into the wrong hands again, then‚Äî"
Tucking Peter's blankets up to his neck, Tony pecked a quick kiss on his forehead and headed out of his room towards the lab, where he found everyone crowded around Bruce's workstation and Bucky holding a copy of a Russian-English dictionary that looked to be at least a hundred years old.
Taking as much of the possibility of human error out of the equation as possible would only make things better, and Peter wanted to do whatever he could to make sure that Steve was able to get home safely.
"It's gonna get really bright now, Tony," Steve warned, his arms pebbling with goosebumps as the familiar whirring noise of the radiation machine began its thundering crescendo. As the basement grew brighter he attempted to cover Tony's eyes, only for his hand to be batted away.
"It's okay, Tony," Steve said. "I'll be all right‚Ä¶ eventually. I just‚Ä¶" He paused, looking up at Tony through his lashes. "Do you think we could go check on Peter? I know JARVIS said he's okay, and I promise I won't wake him up, but‚Ä¶ I just‚ÄîI just wanna see him with my own eyes, so‚Äî"
In fact, it was way too similar to the look Bucky's eyes held when he attacked Steve on the Project Insight helicarrier, as the Winter Soldier.
"Yep, we're on it," said Natasha. "Just as soon as we get cleaned up."
"I'm just sorry that I didn't get to say goodbye to him."
"You cannot be serious," he'd managed to say, clutching the sketchbook with shaking hands.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Okay, just‚Ä¶ can you remind me exactly what these gems are again?" asked James. "Not all of us were as involved in the incident in New York as others."
"The Bronx," Gwen said. "I used to go to the Bronx School of Science."
"I could ask you the same goddamn thing!" cried Dad. He pressed his armored foot harder into the bald guy's chest. "'Cept I would've been a bit more polite about it!"
"–°–æ–ª–¥–∞—Ç?" the colonel asked again, obviously frustrated. "–¢—ã —Å–æ–±–ª—é–¥–∞–µ—à—å?"
Dad shot Uncle Sam a playful glare. "You're damn lucky you're useful around here, Wilson, or‚Äî"
"Tony, we've already been through all of this," Steve said. "Let's just listen to Bruce, okay?"
"I won't," Steve said firmly. He caught Tony's hands, pressing both palms against his heaving chest, over his heart. "I won't, Tony, I promise. I love you so much, there's nothing I'm going to do to jeopardise it."
A split second later Tony's repulsor fired, which finally caused the crack to open about a third of a metre, just barely wide enough for Steve to fit through.
Tony sniffed as he started the car, pulling out onto the street.¬† Leave it to Mr Perceptive himself to read Tony like a goddamn picture book.
"Oh, it is so not fair to use my own weapons against me," Tony groaned. "That's like the ultimate in playing dirty." He tugged hard on Steve's hair, bringing his head up to seal their lips together while he slipped his hands underneath Steve's waistband to grip his ass.
"My father was an Air Corps pilot too," she began. "He loved to fly, loved the notion that by being up there in the air that he was helping to protect our country, and us by extension."
"No, you're not." Steve lifted his head, kissing Tony on the forehead. "But we will be again, sweetheart. I promise."
"Uh huh."
"Don't say child," Peter warned. "Just‚Ä¶ don't. I can stop a bus with my bare hands, I'm not just a child."
Not exactly an easy undertaking. In essence, Natasha had taken on the jobs of both Nick Fury and Steve, and while normally Steve would have protested having her take over duties that he considered his, at the moment he couldn't seem to find it in himself to be upset about it.
"I bet it kinda sucks for you though, being a kid in a house full of superheroes, doesn't it?" asked the guy. "Don't you ever get jealous? I know I would if it were me."
"Rhodey?" Dad said as Uncle James stepped into the room. "Got any new news?"
"Good." Tony glanced up at the clock again, his heart skittering when he saw it was already 2035.
"Okay, then, how about you acknowledge that there's nothing we can do about it right this second, and try and get some rest, all right?" said Papa. "Dad and I have arranged for you to ride back to the Tower with Sam and Bucky once we get back."
He did at least manage to work some more on his shoulder exercises, and can now raise his arm above his head with only a slight amount of pain, rather than the raging firestorm he forced himself through earlier.¬† He‚Äôs still not planning on getting into the water today, especially since he has no swimsuit or towel with him, but maybe in the next couple weeks he can start thinking about it.
"JARVIS? Still looking okay?" he asked.
"Home," Steve said, attempting to nod as his hand came up to cover Tony's. "I want‚ÄîI want to go home."
As soon as Stacy was out of sight, Steve pulled out his phone. As he'd suspected, the first text was from Bucky, informing him that Peter and Gwen were seated five rows in front of him and that he could see them both clearly from his position, and also that Peter had purchased enough popcorn, drinks, and candy for at least six people. He had even bought Bucky some sour skittles, which had become his favourite candy since he'd moved into the Tower.
An awkward pause followed, finally broken when Mrs Stacy cleared her throat. "So, Peter, Gwen tells us that you're in Academic Decathlon as well?"
‚ÄúYou're lying,‚Äù he said, low and tight.
"It was," Steve said, rather sheepishly. "I'm not ashamed to admit that I enjoyed it. I'd always wished for a brother or sister, but after my papa was killed Ma insisted that she'd never fall in love again, so‚Ä¶ Bucky was the closest thing I ever had to a brother."
"Uh huh," Peter rasped, shuddering at the horrible sound of his voice. Thanks to Thanos' chokehold, his throat now felt like it had been rubbed with sandpaper, making him sound like he'd suddenly developed a three-pack-per-day smoking habit.
"Good day, Captain Rogers," said Chief Stacy, offering Steve his hand as he glanced over at Bucky, who gave him a brief but polite nod. "And‚Ä¶ Uncle James, I believe?"
"Ohh," Peter said, wincing. The thought of his beloved Papa being even remotely connected to that horrible general was almost too much. "Um‚Ä¶ if it's any consolation, I'm really glad that's not who you married."
"No. We should still draw straws," Steve said as he turned to Thor. "This isn't something you should do just 'cause you think you need to make up for what happened."
"I'm sure our diplomatic relationship with King T'Challa will eventually grow to include a technology exchange, Tony," Steve cut in. "But for the moment, let's just concentrate on getting home, all right? Which means you need to be resting as much as possible."
Tony let out a chuckle from the driver's seat of their speedboat, shaking his head as he watched Peter's fumbling attempts to reattach the waterski to his left foot while still bobbing up and down in the lake about five metres from their dock. He and Steve had been skiing double for most of the afternoon, and Steve was now attempting to teach him how to drop a ski.
A pink blush crept up Steve's cheeks, and he smiled, revealing the dimple that Tony firmly believed could launch a thousand ships as he reached behind him, tugging the t-shirt over his head and tossing it onto the floor. Tony grabbed onto Steve's wrists, gliding his palms up his beautiful arms to his broad shoulders, then down to his pecs and abs, pleasure shooting through him like an arrow with every tiny hitch in Steve's breath.
They were both quiet again, until Steve cleared his throat.
"Can you roll over for me?" Steve asked, his beautiful face so flushed and eager that he could've asked Tony to bring him the moon on a platter and Tony would've scrambled to do so. He stole another quick kiss before turning onto his stomach, rutting lightly against the sheets as Steve grabbed a bottle of what looked like massage oil off his bedside table and poured some into his hand.
Besides, who would want to marry a Stark?
look. "And about a fifty percent tip. That didn't hurt either."
Tony tipped his head forward, thudding against Steve's collarbone as Steve's arms wound around his waist. "I'm just thinking, what if we're coming at this from the wrong direction?"
face, as Peter would say.
And if it worked, then the therapeutic possibilities would literally be endless.¬† Dad had already told Uncle Sam that he would allow his counselling clients access to the device free of charge, and had already begun exploring options for a small-scale mass production, once Dad could make absolutely sure there was no risk of it falling into the wrong hands.
"I know," said Steve, his heart doing a flip as he watched Peter leap from Tony's back, aiming directly for one of the Chitauri speeders.
He was just never going to allow Peter to leave the Tower ever again, once they managed to make it home. It really was that simple.
"Hey, now!" exclaimed Sam. "Who gave you permission to go ripping on Nawlins? In the summer? When it's‚Äî?"
üò£ = the angst is killing me!
Smiling, Steve dipped his head to kiss him again, whispering a soft, "Thank you" against his lips. "Goodnight, Tony."
"That's very good advice, Gwen," said Mr Harrington from his seat over by the bleachers. "No sense in punching holes in your confidence, you'll all be plenty nervous on the day of the competition as it is. I've had quite a few students over the years that end up barfing their guts out into the trash cans right outside the auditorium before the speeches, and that's a terrible time to be tasting your own vomit in the back of your mouth."
"Why am I here?"
Tipping his head back, Doctor List let out a laugh, one so stereotypically evil that Steve could‚Äôve sworn he had stepped straight out of one of Peter‚Äôs movies.
Pressing another kiss to Tony's temple, Steve pulled the two chairs shoved against the back wall over to the bed, guiding Tony down into one of them.
Steve heard Tony say just before he reappeared inside the training dome. For a moment, he felt frozen, his arms aching to hold his son and unable to comprehend why Peter wasn't here, when he had literally just seen him, alive and well.
Tony's eyebrows shot up. He knew Steve had signed the lease on the lake house before he'd left on the Phoenix mission, but Tony hadn't counted on them being able to move in so quickly.
Actually, he couldn't seem to remember anything that had happened since he'd been tossed into that cell. There were flashes sometimes, flickering images of being attacked and trying to fight back alternating with overwhelming feelings of terror and helplessness, but the constant pain in his body and the worry over his husband and son were enough to make even those brief moments of clarity fade almost as soon as they appeared.
"No, not exactly," Peter answered as he accepted the ice pack, draping it over the back of his neck as he blotted his sweaty face with the towel. "Thank you, Gwen."
Steve thought as he taxied out onto the runway.
Somehow, no matter how weird or outlandish Phillips‚Äô coaching techniques might have seemed at the time, they always ended up being useful.
The corners of Steve's lips twitched into a smirk as he reached for Tony's waist. "Oh, really? I can't say that I'd noticed."
"Ah, yeah," Happy admitted, his eyes downcast. "Yeah, he sure did."
"Steve only
"Oh, so you're not much older than me," Peter said. He sucked in a deep breath, contemplating his next question. "Have you been here a long time?"
"Yeah,
It took several heartbeats for Fury‚Äôs words to completely sink in.¬† Growing up with Howard Stark for a father, Tony had heard of HYDRA before, but only in that weird, disconnected way of someone who never believed they would ever have to deal with them.¬† Kinda like the mob.¬† Or some made-up supervillain like the Joker.
"Hey, you guys," came the shaky voice of Bruce, looking more terrified than Steve had ever seen him. Steve knew that Bruce had spent years on the run in some of the most dangerous places on the planet, so there wasn't much that scared him. And, as far as Steve knew, Hulk wasn't scared of anything.
And Peter did know, he really did.
"Wow, Rogers, you really are in a courtly mood this morning," Carol said with a laugh. "What the hell is up with you?"
"That time was not pleasant for any of us, Your Highness, but especially not for Tony and Peter," Steve said firmly. "As I'm sure you can understand."
Like he has every time, even when the rest of the team started joining them, and Clint took over choosing most of the movies.
"More magic!" Peter said as he landed another blow, disappearing just as fast.
Setting down his notebook and pencil, Peter lay back against his pillows, briefly closing his eyes. He was getting so tired lately from just the tiniest things. Even drawing, something that he used to be able to do all day back when he was first admitted, was starting to wear him out. Just in the last week or so he'd gotten to the point where he had to take a break about every ten to fifteen minutes, making it that much harder to actually get anything done.
"Ah huh," Phillips said, tapping his fingers on his desk. "And it's not gonna be any more dangerous for the pilots to be carrying four satellites each instead of two?"
He trailed off, not finishing his thought, but Tony didn't need him too. He already knew what Steve was getting at. And it made sense, he supposed. Not only did Steve come from a time where the father of the house was supposed to have all of the answers‚Äîor if he didn't, he was supposed to fake it, like Howard‚Äîhe also was a world-renowned military strategist. During the war, it was Steve's strategic missions with the Howling Commandos that were responsible for taking out the entire Nazi deep science division, even sacrificing himself in order to thwart the psychotic Johann Schmidt's carefully laid plans.
"I've never heard you sound this clear, Peter," she said. "Mr Stark, I'd still recommend that he stay overnight, and we should probably run some scans on his heart to make sure that it's structurally intact, but‚Äî"
Gwen stared at him for several heartbeats before finally nodding. "All right. But what're you gonna do when I'm not here to change the subject for you? Are you just gonna avoid thinking about everything for the whole summer?"
"Steven Grant Rogers, I love you," he said as he slid the ring onto Steve's finger. "I love you because you not only did you take the time to get to know the real me, but that once you did, you still chose to love me anyway. And with this ring, and in front of these witnesses, I promise to love you and only you, for the rest of my life."
"I just really wish this didn't have to take so long. You know how much I love waiting."
They took seats over by the window, leisurely sipping their hot drinks as they watched the various people walking by outside. People-watching had always been fascinating to Steve, and he'd been known to sit inside shops or outside on park benches for hours when Tony was busy in the lab or at a meeting, just observing humanity and occasionally sketching in his sketchbook.
But that was a conversation for another time.¬† On this night, Steve had far more important things to take care of.
"If I have to," answered Peter, letting out a frustrated groan when Gwen rolled her eyes. "Okay, okay, I was joking."
"It's okay, little guy!" his image said. "Just hold on a little while longer, I'm almost there!"
And, not surprisingly, Dad had thrown a fit once he found out, rushing to do a complete background check on the man who's name turned out to be Spencer Smythe, a war vet who had been medically discharged, likely for mental health reasons.
"Right away, sir," said Rhodey, jerking his head towards Carol. He was a bit less excited than Tony would've expected too, but Tony quickly brushed it off. Everyone had been working their asses off for almost five days trying to keep two whole countries from falling into panic and bring Steve home at the same time. Tony could understand if they weren't running around leaping for joy.
he thought, pinching the bridge of his nose. It was definitely time for more coffee.
"I'd very much appreciate it if you would allow me to accompany the team from New York, Mr Stark," said Stacy. "I know I'm not a superhero, but my experience as a SWAT team member should at least allow me to hold my own, and it'll be a lot easier to coordinate with the FBI teams from the field than from here."
"There may be no dreams in the nothing, –ü—Ç–µ—Ä, but that doesn't mean they won't be waiting for you when you come back," said Bucky. "And you need to want those dreams gone! You need to chase them away so they never come back! Before I did this, my dreams were the worst that I've ever had. Images of what I was all folding in on each other. Every single person I killed flashing across my eyes like a moving picture. I see everything that I tried so hard to forget. Torture. Slaughter. And training others to do the same. So much blood, so much horror that I would wake up vomiting, but it never helped. None of it helped until I was free! And I want you to be free!"
Whatever it took.
"No!" Steve yelped, stopping Tony's words with a hard kiss. "No, please sweetheart, don't apologise. There's no need for it. I love you too. I love you so damn much, and I'm just‚Äî"
"Phillips didn't say who it was," he said. "Only that we're supposed to behave."
‚ÄúYes, Mr Stark?‚Äù
"'Night, babe."
Johann Schmidt, in the lane to Steve‚Äôs left.
He remained there for over an hour, until the water started to run cold and his skin was screaming in protest. Avoiding the mirror, Steve carefully toweled himself off and threw on some clean pyjama pants and a t-shirt before making up the bed with fresh sheets, tossing yet another set of torn bedding into the trash.
Especially since based on the trajectory that Steve had calculated right afterwards, the yellow beam of light had originated from Meridian airspace.
"Deal. And I love you too."
Tony leaned back as the computer began to whir, idly sipping his coffee as he watched the screen flicker with each update of the now fifteen layers of encryption.
If he was honest he probably should've figured it out a long time ago, given the fact that Steve was a pilot and all. Steve hadn't ever told him specifically what aircraft he flew, only that he flew patrols, which was pretty much what most of the pilots in the Air Corps did anyway, and since Peter hadn't been at all interested in hearing about Steve's work as a pilot they hadn't talked much about it since.
"So you think I should make the width of the containment vessel five millimetres instead of four?" Peter asked, marking a note next to his brand-new drawing. "That'll end up making the whole thing about ten percent heavier, which'll‚Äî"
"Tony," Steve said with a sigh. "I told you‚Äî"
Peter decided to save it anyway, just in case, and had just clicked on the next file when he heard Papa's heavy footsteps in the hallway, heading towards his room. He quickly closed both laptop screens, grabbing his tablet just as Papa knocked on his slightly opened door.
"But only if he's in a good mood?" asked Gwen.
"Hey, little guy," Papa said softly as he glanced over at Peter. "You doing okay?"
And thank you to ads1008 for the beautiful moodboard! üíñ
Peter wasn't a baby anymore, but that didn't mean he didn't still enjoy being babied a bit when he was sick, and he had to admit that Dad and Papa were very good at it.
Flash's eyes went wide as he raised his arms. "Well, okay then, Princess. Your wish is my command."
Tony sniffed, kissing the top of Peter's head. "Next week, once I'm done with all of the space-flight simulator programs."
Tony felt Steve shake his head. "No, it's not just the shampoo," he murmured. "It's just‚Ä¶
Tried, but ultimately failed. It was almost like the more he tried to not think about it, the more he did.
Steve pursed his lips, blinking more sweat from his eyes as he tried to suck in a deep breath. His cockpit was so hot he felt like he was literally melting inside his flight suit, and the storm raging inside his mind wasn't helping.
Or something like that.
Steve tells himself firmly.
"Mmm," muttered Papa. He glanced down at Peter, and Peter responded with a slight shake of the head. This wasn't something for them to get into yet another argument over, especially since Dad had just said the D.C. site was almost done. They'd been bickering enough lately about Dad's heath as it was.
"I'm okay, –°—Ç–∏–≤–∏," Bucky said sharply. "Don't need ya worryin' 'bout me"
‚ÄúB-but, Daddy,‚Äù he said in a shaky voice, biting down hard on his trembling lower lip.¬† ‚ÄúWhat‚Äîwhat‚Äôre we gonna do?¬† We can‚Äôt‚Äîwe can‚Äôt just leave Steve there all alone.¬† He‚Äîhe‚Äôs not‚ÄîDad, he's not okay.¬† He‚Äôs not okay all by himself, in that tiny little place.¬† He needs us.‚Äù
"I know, Papa," Peter said, just barely able to suppress an eyeroll. Papa had already told him that about a million times. "Ned and I will be waiting for you, just like we talked about."
"He did?" Steve asked, smiling widely.
And unfortunately, aside from making sure Tony got enough to eat, switching him to decaf in the evenings over his protests, and encouraging him to sleep more, Steve didn't really know what else he could do to help him.
‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù Steve says instead.¬† ‚ÄúIt doesn't matter now.¬† I've got you.¬† I've got you, and I‚Äôm not letting you go.‚Äù
"Only if they have time to do a background check on Liz's parents first," Peter grumbled, rolling his eyes. "And even then‚Äîwait a second." He paused, wracking his brain. He knew there was something‚Ä¶ "I'm pretty sure that Liz's dad works as one of the salvage contractors for the Department of Damage Control, and if that's the case then it would mean Dad already did a background check on him. So‚Äî"
"I'm so glad that you had fun, little guy," Papa said as he tucked him into bed a few minutes later, kissing his forehead. "Maybe next time we'll all go."
"Good." Natasha glanced around at the path of destruction left behind from the battle, shaking her head. "You guys about ready to get out of here? Hill said the local fire brigade's got everything under control now."
Tony rolled his eyes.¬† ‚ÄúWhy?¬† He been trying to call or something?‚Äù
"How the hell do you know me?" he asked.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Oh my God!" Peter hissed, immediately clapping his hand over his mouth. "Liz's dad is one of the people trying to steal from Damage Control!"
"As for this dinner invitation, Dad and I are fine with it as long as you wait until after we get home. It should only be a couple more days, all right?"
Not only is Steve no longer relaxed and loose, but Shostakov‚Äôs playful slap landed right on the most painful part of Steve‚Äôs shoulder.¬† Steve knows he didn't do it on purpose, as so far he‚Äôs managed to keep his injury a secret from his competitors.
‚ÄúAnd he hasn‚Äôt been off by a single penny yet,‚Äù Steve said, his fingers firmly tucked around his belt.¬† ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a pretty smart kid.‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah, sure.‚Äù¬† Now that the confrontation was over and Obie was gone, Tony was starting to feel like he needed to do a bit of his own decompressing.¬† And if he was feeling that way, then Steve had to be feeling it a hundred times worse.¬† He gave Rhodey a quick hug, clapping him on the back.
"No, it's not," said Uncle Bucky. "But then, neither's what you're going through. It's all just a bunch of bullshit."
‚ÄúYeah.¬† Thanks, Nat,‚Äù says Steve.¬† ‚ÄúI appreciate it.‚Äù
It was one of the main reasons why Papa had been so insistent on working with Peter, so he didn't have to go through anything like that.
‚ÄúThat's my man,‚Äù Dad said proudly.¬† He pressed a quick kiss to Papa‚Äôs hand, over his wedding ring.¬† ‚ÄúAll right, honey.¬† Show us how it goes.‚Äù
Mr Jarvis used to say whenever Tony had been bullied at school, or gotten into yet another screaming match with Howard while he was drunk. And while at the time Tony hadn't quite believed the statement itself, he had at least trusted the sentiment behind it, knowing without a doubt that Mr Jarvis had always had Tony's best interests at heart.
"JARVIS, do a sweep for bugs, will ya?" Tony asked as soon as he and Steve stepped inside their vast penthouse. He slid off his coat and suit jacket, draping them over a chair as he loosened his tie with fumbling fingers. Steve quickly did the same, hanging both his and Tony's jackets up so they didn't wrinkle.
"I said, I'm
"Oh, really? Well, I'm sure we can find something to do to pass the time," Sam said. He reached for Bucky's hand, giving it a squeeze. "We've been wanting to head back down to New Orleans for a bit, and‚Äî"
"Oh gods, Buck," Steve said softly, his voice heavy with guilt. "I am so sorry!"
Guilt flashed across Peter's huge brown eyes as they locked with Tony's, just for a second before flitting away again. He looked so exhausted that Tony was surprised he was still able to stand, with his cheeks even paler than usual and big purple circles under his eyes, and while Tony could understand being tired‚Äîneither he nor Steve had been sleeping well lately‚Äîthis seemed like a lot more than simple school-induced stress and fatigue.
‚ÄúOkay, so‚Ä¶ what does that mean for us?‚Äù
‚ÄúJ?‚Äù he said as his stomach did a flip.¬† ‚ÄúIs something else going on here?‚Äù
Scrubbing a palm down his face, Tony heaved a sigh as he closed out the hologram. "Go ahead and start the render on these, J, I wanna be able to get 'em installed ASAP."
As always, I can‚Äôt wait to see what you think!  Please don‚Äôt hesitate to leave me a comment, and don‚Äôt forget to hit that kudos button!  üíï
‚ÄúI am afraid at this time I cannot locate an official requisition for the other three thousand rifles, sir,‚Äù JARVIS stated.
A sentiment Steve could also sympathise with, given that he still had no idea if Tony and Peter had survived the snap, or even where they were.
"Yeah, I guess," Steve said quickly. "How're the twins doing?"
üê∞ = it‚Äôs so fluffy!
Steve huffed, frowning at his husband even as he knew he was right. Steve was a huge proponent of making sure that his teammates stayed as healthy as possible, and that included regular sessions with Sam Wilson, their resident counselor. But like Tony said, Steve often had plenty of excuses to not make or keep his own appointments with Sam. He usually tried to brush it off, saying that he and Sam's frequent morning runs together were good enough as they often discussed various things related to the team. But Steve also knew that if Tony tried to use a similar excuse on Steve, there'd be no way that Steve would let it fly.
, 'cause this isn't the only thing on my rather packed agenda today, so we need to be moving things along now."
"Oh Christ, I'm not talking about you, you idiot!" Dad snapped, shooting Quill a harsh glare. "I'm talking about my
Again, Tony shrugged. "I s'pose it could be. I can see if Fury still has any of the stuff for me to analyse."
"Yeah, he really is." Steve paused, wondering if he should even bother to ask. "Um, do you know if his father's been able to come in and see him at all?"
"But I'm sure he eventually figured out that it was weird," said Peter. "Papa's too smart not to."
Steve's eyebrows shot up. "You do?"
"That's what Phillips said," replied Steve. "And I don't think he'd be joking about something like that."
Which Steve supposes is just as well.¬† Even though he liked his old one since it meant he didn't have to re-shave his chest every other day, and it helped him to achieve a world-record time, there‚Äôs no way he could have afforded a new one for this Olympics.¬† Even with his TYR contract.
"Sweetheart," he said as he curled his arms around Tony's waist. "I don't know how else to say this, so I'm just gonna say it. I need you to tell me what's going on with you, and that means everything, okay? Even the stuff that you don't like talking about."
‚ÄúDad!‚Äù Peter hisses, rolling his eyes when Dad just laughs.¬† They quickly fall into step behind Mr Rogers, who leads them down the stairs to the first sub level.¬† Peter can smell the chlorine coming from the pool area even before Mr Rogers opens the door, his eyes going wide when they step out onto the pool deck to find the university‚Äôs swimming team just finishing up an afternoon practise.
His lungs so full they were near to bursting. Not able to breathe out.
"Hey, Tones," he said softly. "I guess I don't have to ask how you're holding up, huh?"
Tony rolled his eyes. "Yeah, bud, although I wouldn't've exactly called it a fight. Mostly he just kinda stood there like a lost puppy while I yelled at him, and then he told me the same things you just told me."
"Not at all, sir."
"Okay," Tony repeated, trying hard to keep his expression neutral even as he wanted to scream at the unfairness of it all. Steve had been so relaxed, so happy before they had walked off the plane, and now it was all shot to hell in only a couple of minutes.
"Nah," he said. "Pete's much better looking than me."
"Two large peppermint teas and a chocolate croissant, please," Tony said to the young lady at the counter, who immediately started gushing as she recognised them. Tony smiled as she fumbled with his change, giving her a twenty dollar tip as she handed them their drinks, the clean, pungent smell of the peppermint already working to soothe Steve's frayed nerves. Peppermint had been banned from the Tower and Compound because of how dangerous it was for Peter, so Steve took full advantage of any opportunity that he had to enjoy a cup of his favourite tea without it posing a threat to their son.
There was a short pause while JARVIS calculated.¬† ‚ÄúI would place a conservative estimate at approximately ten standard doses per hour, sir.‚Äù
"Yeah, yeah, copy that," said Sam. "Just don't forget that our army isn't endless, unlike the enemy's. I'd definitely take a few more of that giant dude though. Where the hell'd he come from?"
"Good," Steve repeated. "Now, why don't we eat while it's hot, then you can explain to me what this contraption is?"
"Very true, sir."
Not surprisingly, Tony was able to read his mind.
"That's true, your papa is pretty nice. Must be those old-fashioned manners." Ned rolled his eyes, leaning closer. "I think my mom has kind of a crush on him. She's always talking about how good he looks in his uniform and stuff."
But then he broke away, giving Tony an apologetic smile as he kissed the tip of his nose. "I'm sorry, sweetheart, but I really need to get going. But I'd love it if you stayed here till I got back. I'm sure you're not usually up this early, are you?"
"The differences that will lead to our victory," said Gamora.
"Are you Tony Stark?" she asked.
"Really?" Tony said, pausing in his search for some protective goggles. "And why's that?"
Tony thought, grimacing.
"I'm not gonna let you slip away from me," he murmured as he brushed a stray hair from Tony's forehead, his heart fluttering when Tony let out a soft moan. He had been so out of it when Bruce first started working on him that he became combative, insisting that he didn't deserve to live after losing Peter and that Steve and the rest of the team should just let him die. It eventually got to the point where Steve had to physically hold him down so Bruce could start an IV, nearly sending Steve into a full-blown hyperventilating attack once it was finally placed that James was just barely able to talk him through.
Thank you so much for all of the wonderful comments!  I‚Äôm so glad you guys are enjoying the story!
"Sam, get Pete outta here," Tony commanded as soon as Sam landed next to Tony, a wool blanket clutched in his hands. "And call Barton, we need those explosive arrows of his."
"Steve, both Killian and Stane tried to kill us because
Things are apparently a lot more cut and dry when you're twelve.
"That's much better," Tony said proudly. "So,
"Well, according to Uncle Thor, Nidavellir is actually a real place too," said Peter. He glanced furtively around the lunchroom, grateful that the rest of the students seemed to have resumed their own conversations. "He told me that's where his hammer was forged."
"There's more incoming outside the dome!" he called from about fifty metres up, pointing towards the mountainous forest surrounding the city. "Steve, I'm pretty sure this is it!"
"Oh Christ, Pete, I'm so sorry," Dad whispered as he drew Peter back into his arms, his armoured fingers massaging the back of Peter's neck. "Buddy, I'm sorry. I'm just so worried about Papa, and‚Äî"
No other way than to sacrifice Peter, and however-many other millions of people.
"Oh, so now you wanna get all doctor-y on him?" Tony asked. "Well, too late, Strange, you don't get to hear his little secret. Just suffice it to say that he's a helluva lot stronger than he looks
"'Cause I knew it would just get you upset," Peter replied. "And you've already got enough stress at work without adding more to it. Especially since it's not even a big deal."
"By all means, bud," answered Tony. "Just as long as you save some for Papa." Then he took Steve's face in his hands and tugged him down for another kiss, the tip of his tongue teasing along Steve's bottom lip for just a second before he pulled away.
Thor glanced down at his axe, twirling its handle in his hand. "I understand that, Captain. But if I can somehow make up for what I failed to do the last time, then I would hope you would allow me the opportunity. I am the strongest Avenger. It should be me."
A flood of shame suddenly washed over Steve, one so strong that it nearly knocked him off his chair. Growing up without a father had been awful, a fate that Steve wouldn't wish on anyone no matter who they were. But growing up with a father who'd been accused of treason and all of its accompanying ramifications‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ Steve wondered if that maybe had to have been even worse.
"We need to take out the ship," Tony said, ignoring Steve's shocked, "
Steve grunted as his head began to slip forward again, managing to catch himself just before it dropped. He was so tired that he could barely keep his eyelids open, and had already managed to wrench his neck three separate times trying to stay awake.
He could now easily out-eat Papa, which, according to Dad, was supposed to be just about impossible.
"Tony and Peter were taken away from Earth in pursuit of the Time Stone," he continued. "So if I had to guess, I'd say that Thanos decided to go after it first."
Every single time. At least he'd remembered to bring Peter a new notebook since Dad had taken his old one. Peter couldn't wait to hear how JARVIS was going.
Not when he had a chance to be the first Langaran to ever fly in space.
Even as most of the time they seemed to be the only options available.
"Mmm," muttered Tony, once again cursing the fact that Steve could read him like a book even in the near-darkness. Like Steve, Tony always‚Äîusually‚Äîslept bare-chested, so as to maximise skin-to-skin contact with his beloved.
"Well, someone's gotta keep this guy in line," Sam said, jerking his head towards Bucky. "In fact, I'm pretty sure he still owes Steve for those drink rounds we had way back when."
"I will take what you said under advisement, which is all I can promise you at the moment," T'Challa finally said. He got to his feet, followed by Steve and the rest of the team. "Now, if you will excuse me, I must make arrangements to return my father's remains to our home‚Äî"
"Gods, I hope you're right," whispered Tony. He sucked in a deep breath, eyeing Steve warily. "This is all your fault, you know. If you hadn't been so goddamn charming, and sweet, and altogether
"Uhh‚Ä¶" Peter stammered, wincing. "Hold that thought."
"Yeah, that's what I'm seeing down here," said Tony. "Hold on, let me see if I can get him back up."
‚ÄúBut no games with Ned till it‚Äôs done, yeah?‚Äù Tony adds.¬† ‚ÄúIf you're gonna be swimming every day now, you‚Äôre gonna need to get your rest, so you might just have to tell Ned that his Minecraft hut will have to wait for a bit.‚Äù
With a quick shake of his head, Tony turned back to Phillips to ask for his dismissal, and was startled to find the colonel staring directly at him.
"Gee, thanks for the vote of confidence," Tony grumbled, shooting Rhodey a raised eyebrow. He pressed his palm to his chest, feeling the rapid flutter of his heart as he rechecked the readings on his data pad yet again.
"Yes, yes," Sharon said as she quickly detached the radiation hose and unsealed the container only a second before Peter violently jerked, gasped, and immediately began to choke.
Emoji Key for those who don't know what to say in the comments!
‚ÄúOh yeah, I‚Äôm sure,‚Äù Peter said.¬† He reached into his pocket for his wallet, pulling out his credit card and handing it to Steve.¬† ‚ÄúLike I said, my dad doesn't mind when I buy books.‚Äù
"Now, you know that's not the smartest of ideas!" Tony called as the two boys took off, holding up his hand to block the dust kicking up from Pietro's blink-and-you'll-miss-him exit. "Ah, like they'll ever listen to us."
After dropping off his jacket in his quarters and grabbing a book, Steve was just rounding the corner towards the mess hall when he nearly ran headlong into Colonel Phillips, the Air Corps commander, barely avoiding upsetting the full cup of coffee in his hand.
