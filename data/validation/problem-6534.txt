"Van Dyne's coming over with the parts," Steve informed Tony, as he waded deeper into the smoke filled area.
Then Tony got it. It was lovely, really, how unguarded his expression was when he figured Steve couldn't see him. "You mean Peter Quill," he said slowly. And then
He stops, breathing hard. Opens his mouth to say something else, but instead he tastes rain on his tongue and waits.
"How can I concentrate, I'm receiving fucking Berger waves in abnormal quantities. Am I emitting too, by the way?"
"I'm afraid not, boss." Friday rose to the occasion, bless her. "Do you want me to cancel our book club meeting, maybe?"
A surprised laugh escaped from Steve’s lips, transforming his face into something more familiar. “What?”
He couldn't stop thinking about his last conversation with Captain Rogers – their only actual conversation, really. Rogers had seemed very human, and almost sweet at one point. They
For a moment there, it seemed as if he was going to say something else, but then he said, "Okay." It rang weirdly; I could see the lines of his body, still taut as a violin string.
The thought was hot and frantic as they skied off the way they’d come, down a very gentle incline of the marked path, and then further southwards. Side by side. Steve’s left hand still held firmly in Tony’s right. Both of them holding their poles in opposite hands. Tony had tugged Steve up and dragged him off with a renewed enthusiasm, and somehow,
too much, and then more. And then, on the up-slide, Tony's thumb strokes roughly over the head of Steve's cock, just once, over the most sensitive spot, and at the same time, he presses hard against his prostate with his other hand. The burst of pleasure is so intense Steve sees white for a moment, and he shouts incoherently, and he thinks he's going to come, now, right now, just a...
about to walk down the red carpet one by one, like the seven dwarves? Really? Everyone else is going to be entering in pairs..."
Steve looked around for a second, as much as he could for the smoke, trying to survey the situation. He couldn't see his own viper, and he felt instantly guilty he was looking for it at all. The fires weren't under control. These people needed help.
Tony gasps for breath, still gripping his own cock in his left hand, still milking it for sensation. The flogger falls from his fingers, but he's hardly aware of it.
. Tony dived in front of him, yelling himself, because you never know when a gun might go off, when a finger might jerk involuntarily, and a bullet end up in a wrong, blond head, and make Tony's world narrow down to a single bullet hole, forever.
Cap was standing over Quentin Quint, his head inclined, a patient half-smile on his lips. He seemed a tad distracted.
"What do you think, cuddlecakes?" Tony asks with forced cheer. At that word, Steve's eyebrow twitches in an extremely ironic manner, but no one who doesn't know him would notice, of course. "Can we live with separate beds for two nights?"
"Do you want this?" Something in Steve's tone was sheer stubbornness, ticking boxes one by one, trying to remove Tony's arguments.
"You do. I know the look. You are going to deck someone. Steve, are you going to deck someone? Because I think that would be highly frowned upon here."
Tony delegated him some veggies that needed cutting up. The planned menu, to Steve, seemed weird and endearing and he had to admit he never expected they'd be making mac and cheese soup and meatball pops with dip and tiny tacos and pizza muffins and dozen other kid-friendly dishes that, to him sounded like breakfast food. Everything was as healthy as possible under the circumstances; everything was also made from scratch, apparently by Tony. Steve found the idea absolutely adorable, which he wouldn't quite dare tell Tony; still when he
"I batted the branch aside," the man said brightly. Was that a hint of a shiver in his voice? Okay, everything else aside, the cold was getting severe and Tony needed to get him into the car and to move on. "But I, uh, skidded on the ice and collided with the car. Yeah. Well. Hey, I do know about the hobbits, though, I've read that book," the guy added.
That was what Bruce, the newly appointed court wizard, had called them once, while they were preparing for their first battle together. And, while Natasha had to admit it had a grain of truth to it – they were indeed an unlikely group – it had been years ago. Things were different now.
would have been more accurate, but no one could really be bothered to say all of the words any more. Of course the full name had to be that long, of
The phone was ringing again, so Tony took pity on Happy and tried to reassure him – again – that everything was all right.
He thought a shiver went through Steve, but it was probably just chills. Good that Tony had given him a blanket.
Speaking of Rhodey, he seemed mightily nervous tonight, for whatever reason. He had decided to wear his civvies, and, unlike Tony, he was very conservative in his choice of suit.
Tony had asked, even as it slowly dawned on him that she'd meant something completely different. And yes, he'd been seeing those dolls around. He remembered now.
“Yeah?” Steve said. His voice was as choked as Tony’s, Tony noticed, but it was definitely good choked.
lifetime away). And he kept wondering what would happen if the life support systems had really given out. There were emergency lockers with protection suits, like the ones they were wearing now, at key points, but people panicked. People got stupid when they panicked. He kept seeing the faces in his imagination. Oh,
And now, plainly, it was enough to feel Steve against his back, so near, so warm, seemingly so vulnerable all of a sudden, and Tony was gone, done for. Although the old hurt was still there, quirking an ironic eyebrow at him, he just wanted to fix everything for Steve, somehow, make everything work out for him.  The urge was overwhelming, and, taking everything into account, pretty silly.
Because Tony's arm was rising on its own, and Tony wasn't sure what the limb's intentions were (maybe to check Steve's pulse, like in the vision? But that was too morbid. Or perhaps to touch him on the shoulder, to make sure he was real. Or maybe, just maybe, to shake his hand like a normal person would). But the motion seemed to break the spell, and Steve closed the final distance between them, and all of a sudden Tony went rigid with nervousness, and he thought:
"So," Peter said. "How come you aren't over there?" He nodded his head toward the other end of the ballroom (still miles away). "Kyrumpting."
And then Tony remembers he's supposed to stay reserved, so he pulls back, wipes the smirk off his face. "We should go," he mutters. But then, with an urge for petty vengeance – because he doesn't want Steve's touch to feel this good – he narrows his eyes and grabs Steve's hand in a steely hold. "Come on,
Tony: Not really, but by the little I've been able to find out, I think he's borderline safe to talk to.
"Would you like me to do it some more?" The query is deceptively mild, but Steve jumps to answer without much thinking, because he doesn't have much thinking left anyway.
But today wasn’t about safe, or about pushing, it seemed, so what he said instead was: “I let them know I’m not feeling so well. I’ll drop by the resort tomorrow. No biggie, Cap. Don’t worry about it.”
All of a sudden Tony could feel him – Steve's shoulder against his chest, Steve's face abruptly so close to his own, unnaturally close, his breath on Tony's cheek like a heatwave. He turned his head, a minuscule motion that seemed to last centuries. He met Steve's gaze. Expected to find accusation there.  Didn't. He didn't quite know how to read that expression – eyes wide, unblinking, lips half parted. Blood roared in his ears like a thousand heavy engines. Steve's fingers still dug into his shoulder to the point of bruising pain. Were his lips inching towards Tony's? Or was it the other way around?
Tony puts both his hands on Steve's upper thighs, squeezes for a second, strokes Steve's skin with both his thumbs, roughly. Then he reaches out takes Steve's balls in his palm, as if weighing them. The metal is cold, and Steve shivers in response. Tony squeezes, first gently, then sharper, more decisively. He plays with them for a moment, tugs, keeping it on the verge of discomfort. He lets his other hand hover over Steve's cock for a second, and Steve's cock jumps to meet the metal. Tony hums for a second, or so Steve thinks, although it could be just the whir of the servos.
. Steve wasn't saying anything, though. He just sat there, motionless, like a roadmark. His face was a complete blank. Tony knew that blankness, that glassy expression. It enkindled all his nasty instincts. He struggled up and decided to go take a piss instead.
He found a set of the first ten books in the series on Amazon and ordered them to be delivered to the Compound. Sam had been teaching him to use modern technology over the past couple of years, and two-day shipping was a revelation to Steve.
Normally he’d be fully invested in whatever he was reading. It was one of the things he’d preserved from his old life—sitting in the morning to read the paper. But something was stuck in the back of his mind. A distraction that wouldn’t go away.
Thanks for reading! Like most things I write that start out as smutty oneshots, I decided there's more I needed to say in this little universe. I'm eternally grateful for you people who read my stories and encourage me to keep going.
He’d lost track of time by the time they finally broke apart for good, clothes and hair rumpled, lips swollen and red from the effort.
So he pushed too hard when Tony was reckless. Didn’t cut him any slack when he dozed off in meetings or was distracted with plotting out new schematics. He didn’t like having to do it, but it was an easy role to be in. Comfortable, even. He was Captain America, and he knew how to take charge of an unruly soldier.
The next morning he popped out of bed, eager to put on the outfit he’d laid out the night before. The same khakis and tie, but this time he sported a white button up and tweed blazer. He briefly paused, considering the comment Clint had made yesterday about elbow patches, but shook off his worry and focused on getting the tie knot just right. ‘Let everyone else laugh, Tony seemed to like it, and that’s all that matters,’ he told himself.
It would be worth it. To fuck that smug look right off his face. To make the perfectly perfect Captain America beg for more. Beg to be allowed to come. Because of course, Tony would edge him on. Wouldn’t let him have any release until he had earned it.
Steve laughed again. “Admittedly, that was a pretty fucked up thing that just happened, but I know what it’s like to feel backed into a corner, like you have no options. I felt the same way in there, that’s why I stuck it out. Well, that and the fact that I was having a really great time with you until they started feeding you all that stuff you had to do and say in the headset. Plus I like to think I’m a pretty forgiving guy, and you clearly felt awful about it.” He paused, debating on whether he wanted to include the next part. “And, it’s been like 3 years since I had a date, let alone anyone I liked, and as much as I do enjoy spending Saturday nights binge watching tv and cuddling with my cat, sometimes it would be nice to have an actual person to binge watch those shows with.” He smiled sweetly at Tony, who accepted his outstretched hand, and pulled Tony up to stand next to him. He didn’t let go of Tony’s hand as they walked back onto the sidewalk. It was warm and much lighter than his own, and he found that it fit perfectly.
Steve set the book on the living room coffee table, staring long and hard at it, before retreating to his room to change.
And then they were kissing again, laughing and exploring the feel of each other’s bodies. And it was exactly what Steve had hoped this would be like. Maybe even better.
He licked tentatively, finding that he tasted salty with just a hint of sweetness. The dark look in Steve’s eyes told him that Steve was enjoying this just as much as Tony, and he studied every slow movement as Tony made a show of licking him clean, suckling on each finger, making steady eye contact as each of Steve’s digits popped out of his pop with an audible wet sound.
“That’s it,” Steve’s voice was part amused, part exhausted. “We’re going home, and I’m going to take a shower and scrub until I can’t feel my skin anymore. And I’m going to pray that Symbiote doesn’t stain.”
His breath hitched, caught in his throat and he felt a pang of guilt. This was utterly gorgeous, but Steve had never intended for him to see this, he knew. He must have forgotten to close his work up in his tired state.
They ate, everyone eager to fill up, and Steve found his eyes wandering to Tony. He seemed back to normal; teasing Rhodey about his date the night before, and asking Bruce for advice on one of his projects.
“They like to do that, leave a cliffhanger that makes us wonder if Tristan and Sawyer will really end up together. It’s part of the appeal I guess?” Tony gave him a gentle smile, his eyes focusing on Steve’s for the first time since they’d started talking. He patted the empty space on the ground next to him, and Steve took it as an invitation to sit on the floor, his back against another workbench.
Tony lost track of time, and it wasn’t until Steve was prodding him gently that he was stirred from his laser-focus. Steve looked exhausted, and Tony suddenly felt the way he looked. He’d poured all his energy into the battle and the synthesizing process afterwards. He hadn’t stopped to consider the strain today had put on his body, and he was grateful to Steve for keeping him in check. He’d probably have worked another 12 hours if not for him.
Steve looked around for a clean cloth, and lightly dabbed at the blood on Tony’s temple. Tony, to his credit, didn’t complain, even through Steve was sure it stung.
Apparently Steve was into dirty, messy sex, the kind that left you sweaty and covered in come. Tony could work with this.
Today I saw you on the news. Some filler story about your ongoing green initiative. You looked happy. Are you happy? I hope you are.
Steve stood there a while longer, contemplating what Tony had said. ‘You should dress like that more often.’ He couldn’t help but smile to himself as he touched the worn cuff of his grey sweater.
Wait, I forgot people don’t write ‘dear’ at the beginning of a text message. I know you were teasing me, but I’m regretting that I refused to let you teach me Text Skills 101. This would probably be a lot less embarrassing if I had let you.
Except sometimes I think I do. Maybe you knew it would break me just a little. Maybe you were scared to own up to the truth. Maybe you care more about him than you ever cared for me. Maybe history counts more than I thought. Maybe none of this makes any sense.
Fuck that. He was Tony Stark. Iron Man. Not Iron Soldier. And if Steve couldn’t see that, then that was his own damn fault. Fuck him.
“Yeah, we’d given up on asking about that a long time ago,” Steve said, still trying in vain to hide his laugh.
Steve’s eyes widened, his breath catching, lust rushing through his veins. “And maybe we could finish off with that ending chapter from Number 2?”
Eventually Steve stirred out of his fantasy, sweaty and spent and covered in the uncomfortably cold sensation that was his own orgasm.
Tony laughed and said he understood that; that he was a PhD student at MIT and needed money for school. He grimaced, and Steve could tell there was a deeper story behind that. They talked for a bit about Steve’s art and Tony’s studies, and he was delighted to find out that Tony was just as interested in art history as he was, though their specific areas of interest were different. Steve was a big fan of the Impressionists and Baroque painters, whereas Tony knew about architecture and modern art. Still, it was nice to find out they had things in common.
Tony was the one who usually lavished under the warm water, letting it steam up until he could hardly breathe from the heat. He loved to crank up the temperature until it felt like his skin might melt off his bones. It was calming and eased his aching muscles at the end of a long day fighting to protect New York. He didn’t even mind the jabs that came from Nat and Clint about what he spent all that time in the shower doing. That was his business and if he happened to partake in a little fantasizing while scrubbing off the day’s grime, then so be it. And sure, maybe sometimes the fantasies would include a certain blonde haired blue eyed hunk of All-American muscle. All right, those sometimes had turned into every time recently. But no one needed to know that. This was his time, and he could fantasize about whoever he damn well pleased, thank you very much.
He should be reviewing contracts Pepper had been hounding him about. He should be delving into the new test products that R&D had been working on for him. He should be at least checking his email, which had an alarming number of unopened messages.
That had earned him a lazy punch to the shoulder from Sam, and he breathed a sigh of relief as the conversation moved on to Rhodey’s new love interest. Nat was being especially nosy about finding out who she was.
Steve relaxed, perhaps realizing Tony wasn’t backing up, wasn’t going to run. He gave a tentative lick to Tony’s lower lip, and that was all the indication Tony needed to stop holding back. He kissed Steve, a desperation growing in his chest. A need.
Guess I wouldn’t mind that. I’d be dead so it wouldn’t really affect me. I’ve been thinking more about what I’d write if I were actually mail you something. But that’s too much to process. So instead I’ll just keep writing to the Steve in my head. My Steve.
“Don’t be so dramatic, Cap. Afterall, I thought that was my job. Can’t have you going all soft on me now.” Tony shot him a cocky grin as he spoke, and he loved the eye roll Steve gave in response. “So sassy, Rogers, what would America think about their favorite heart throb if they knew he was a sarcastic bastard half the time?”
Steve nodded his head, confused by Tony’s insistence. “Yeah, but we’re not starting setup until 10, I figured I’d catch up on the news and make some breakfast in a bit. Do you want me to make you some?”
Steve shuddered, trying in earnest to fling what once was the Symbiote they’d just fought off from his bare flesh. When they got the call that there was a disturbance in lower Manhattan, they knew some kind of green humanoid was rampaging, but they hadn’t expected it’s tentacle-like appendages or the thick mire that coated it’s amorphous skin.
Clint was alright, and Natasha too. They were pretty funny when they weren’t fucking with him. And Thor had always been kind to him. He was a little out of touch, but Tony liked that. He liked that Thor wasn’t embarrassed by things he didn’t understand. And even Bruce, as shy and uncomfortable around them as he was, would liven up when faced with a scientific problem. They’d had enough late nights debating how to troubleshoot tech problems that Tony might even call him a friend. Maybe.
Ever so gently, he turned the page, his fingers trembling and heart pounding against his reactor. He knew this was wrong. Knew this might be a betrayal of Steve’s trust, but he had to know, had to find out if he was right about this.
At one point Steve half-thought Tony was going to reach out to touch the soft fabric of his sweater, but Tony kept his hands to himself.
Teammates. That’s what they were. Glorified coworkers. Tony had made that damn clear from the start.
Sometimes I still have nightmares. The image of your face flashes through my mind. The pain. The anger. The hurt. That I caused.
One of these days I might finally send something. One of these days I might stop writing these. I can’t decide which would be less painful.
Steve’s eyes were fixated on Tony as he spoke, it made his heart do funny things and he could feel heat rising to his face. Nevertheless, he kept explaining his plan, answering Steve’s questions and bouncing ideas off of him for the mathematical calculations that might come into play.
And then he dismounted from Tony, regretting the long moments without contact while he selected his implement. A paddle would do nicely. This one was pliable and would deliver a delectable sting, thanks to the leather surface. He gripped it in his hand, then walked the brief steps back to Tony, who had been silently waiting for him to return. He saw Tony’s eyes were still closed, and his breathing had steadied once more.
There was something about enemies being forced to work together that made Steve’s heart flutter. And if they just so happened to be astonishingly handsome and gay, so be it.
A moment of panic flashed across Tony’s face. Steve grinned, amused that Tony hadn’t noticed him before, and asked “What are you reading? You seemed really into it.”
Once he was satisfied with his preparations, he’d rest a heavy hand on Tony’s back, guiding him forward and down onto the floor. Steve would love the way Tony’s plump ass was on display. He’d gently turn Tony’s face so he could see a little of what Steve was doing, taking care to make Tony comfortable while he laid there, his naked chest panting slightly against the ground.
Steve considered for a moment before saying, “How about we pretend we didn’t both just get conned into an awful situation because we’re desperate to pay our bills, and go have a normal date? We can start all over again and you can finish telling me about your arc reactor, which sounds absolutely amazing, by the way, and I can tell you about my asshole best friend who means well but has a funny way of showing it, and maybe on the next date we can go wander The Brooklyn Museum and you can try to convince me that contemporary art is more meaningful than the classics?” He stood and offered Tony his hand.
“We should get you cleaned up. It’s not a deep wound, but it still needs to be bandaged.” Steve hoped desperately that he wasn’t overstepping.
Tony fakes that he’s about to run up, and the soldier takes one more step back, just close enough for Steve to pull up on the metal bar and get his leg’s wrapped around him.
Tony spins around from his place at the kitchen counter, awaiting his first cup of liquid gold of the day.
Steve comes just as gorgeously as Tony remembers, his hot cum hitting Tony’s chest, painting across his abdomen and falling slowly into his navel. Tony’s an absolute mess and he’s never been so satisfied in his life.
He makes a half attempt to grab his phone, but now that the adrenalines worn off, Tony’s hands are shaking.
Tony’s in his workshop, cleaning up some scrap metal he has laying around. Rhodey’s braces are prepared and ready for another test run tomorrow, so it’s all just a waiting game from here.
Until Tony himself is reaching a hand out to intertwine his fingers with Steve’s and looking up at him with the same brown eyes that have quite literally rocked Steve’s entire world tonight.
Tony hums, tapping a finger on his chin and pretending to think about it, “I want you to take a hit of this blunt and shotgun me.”
Steve wastes no time shucking Tony's jeans down over the rest of his thighs and reaching back to pull his own shirt over his head.  Tony's met with quite a view, Steve's body is only ever impeccable and his chest is still slick from the temperature. He reaches out to grab onto Steve's shoulders and pull him back into another heated kiss.
“Well that’s all I have to hear,” Tony starts, before letting his arms drop from around Steve’s neck as he begins posing, contorting his arms and legs all different ways, the funniest vogueing Steve’s ever seen someone attempt and he can’t help the bubble of laughter that escapes his chest, doubling over as the sound only makes Tony get more dramatic with it.
“I’d be honored to meet your work in progress one of these days, I swear it.” Steve says, trying to catch Tony’s eye again, wanting him to catch on to his sincerity.
Loki’s out of breath as he tries to reply, “I wanted to turn her small again, so I could be the one to raise her, and have her be loyal to
So he listens to what Rocket has to say, and they have an admittedly half-cooked plan done by the time the sun is setting over the Wakandan fields.
Christ, he needs a drink. But Natasha is already casting glances at him every few seconds, so that will just have to wait, if they make it out of this.
Not to mention how tense it’s been between him and Steve, since their drunken one night stand a few months ago. Tony would have been fine with them just brushing it off and forgetting about it, but instead he had to start harboring feelings for the guy and now with this mission in the way, they’ve been at a standstill. Did he mention how much he hates undercover missions? Let alone the type that has his right wrist cramping from how many times he’s had to tug a quick one out in the bathroom because Steve decided to wear one of those skin tight henley’s again.
“You look so fucking pretty like this,” Steve praises, his eyes half lidded in pleasure, “God, Tony, I want to make a mess of you.”
, fuck Steve,” Tony mumbles, wondering when the feeling in his toes will come back, and Steve just sits back on his feet, smiling warmly up at Tony, the picture of innocence like he didn’t just swallow Tony’s entire load in one mouthful.
Spinning around and facing the other man, who has stupidly taken a few steps back, Tony catches a look from Steve and instantly a plan is formed.
She took his hand and apologized for not telling him about Bucky’s involvement in his parents’ deaths. Explaining how she felt that it wasn’t her place to reveal that to him, but then realized how she had been wrong about that.
“Cap, we’ve got to get a move on.” Sam interrupts the stand-still, throwing worried glances to the security cameras that Ross is sure to be watching.
“He might have hacked into Ross’ home security system, set the sprinkler system off inside his house, then hacked into his home network and sent President Ellis a
It didn’t last long, but Steve kept coming around, kept checking up on him, being so fucking earnest in that special way only Steve has. But, Tony was suspicious, sent Pepper to shoo him away with fake excuses.
Using the gauze from the first aid kit, Tony cuts some up and applies pressure to the wounds, willing Bucky’s healing to clot his blood faster. He brings his other hand up to press down onto Bucky’s groin, hoping that pressure on both the wound and a major artery will stop Bucky from bleeding so profusely.
Natasha sends him a grim smile, “It was Ross, I got in contact with a few people who owe me favors, and Ross has a bone to pick with our rogue team.”
Bruce and Natasha join them, and Steve watches as they all check him over, none of them mention how Tony trembles in their arms.
“She’s over here,” Tony says, before moving to the back of his lab to show Steve where he has everything set up.
Tony still wanted to be mad at her from their conversation when Rhodey’s diagnosis was up in the air. His comment about her not being able to shake the double agent act was petty, and he knew it, that’s why he said it. Their friendship has always been full of insults, going straight for the jugular. And despite all that, at the end of the day still protecting each other fiercely.
It promises that all its proceeds go to the local children’s hospital and as a former sick kid himself, he can’t really say no to that. Not to mention the added benefit of avoiding spending another Saturday inside his apartment, dwelling on the deadline of his final art project hanging over his head like a bomb waiting to go off.
Walking back into the room, Tony see’s Steve crouching in front of Bucky effectively covering him from Tony’s view.
Oh, yeah, that’s a big no. Tony had sent both calls from Steve straight to voicemail, he can barely handle texting. He doesn’t want to imagine trying to suffer through a phone call.
“Was there really any doubt?” he replies, one eyebrow cocked playfully, stepping up to Steve again, to grab his hand and pull him back into their shared space. “You got a name, footloose?”
“Get down!” Natasha’s yelling now, and Tony hits the floor so hard he’s gonna have bruises across the entirety of his knees and shins.
Tony goes back to glaring daggers into the man’s face before knocking him out with one punch to his face.
Steve chuckles, shaking his head at the ridiculous nickname, pointing down to his own nametag on his chest.
Tony moans from deep within his chest, he could spend forever here with Steve, in the half dark room, together and high, feeling the best he has all week.
He swears his heart almost stops as he looks to the crap cell phone Steve sent him (he has developed a habit of carrying it with him from room to room), only to see that its quiet.
As he listened to the steps in the corridor outside, not hearing any, he felt unhealthily rational. He'd turned the full circle again, this time with considerably less hope as an outcome. A part of him didn't even want to bother with this, but he quenched the thought.
A peculiar hunger in his soul won over the feelings of propriety and guilt. Sneaking around like a thief, he opened the armoire; took a peak inside all the desk drawers, one by one. Looked through the few toys in the basket under the bed. In the end he stopped in front of the bookshelf, and ran a finger along rows upon rows of kids' books, interspersed with some textbooks and manuals. Reading the spines. This time around, absorbing every word.
"I'll hold you to that," was the final thing Tony said for some time, and he said it just so that he'd have the last word. And then, for both of them, it was high time to stop talking.
For the umpteenth time since the conversation started, Tony wished he could see the guy's face. Parking by the roadside and turning the lights off in order to make a phone call might not have been his brightest idea. The lights did make his headache worse, though.
," Tony said quietly at his elbow, as if reading his mind. It figured. He and Tony had this weird, instinctive understanding when they weren't trying to gauge each other's eyes out. "Everything before this big threat, we handled it, one way or another," Tony added.
Unhurriedly, Tony pulls his finger out, reaches for the lube, adds more. And then it's the new coldness against his hole. The muscles are pretty lose by now. Still, the stretchy pain is there, perpetuating the agony of want in his cock. And, true to his promise not to be gentle, Tony chooses to push his fingers in side by side, twisting them first to the one side, then to the other, as he forces them deeper in. Steve catches himself
, he thought, without a doubt this time, and hated the fact that it still stung and itched like a million tiny mosquito bites.
As Steve opened his mouth, probably to offer something else conciliatory, Tony heard himself say: “Gee, keep me company, that’s mighty big of you, Captain...”, and crap, it was too sharp, too mocking, too
Steve struggled to think. But as he felt Tony's erection against his own, a new tide of sharp wanting washed over him. That was that, all the inhibitions fell away, for him.
" he said very pointedly. "Just in case you were wondering. This is not checking you off a bucket list or anything." This made it all sound so much worse. He should just shut up, really, once in his life, just shut up and not say anything for the next three days.
He considered the note for a moment, then crumpled it in his hand and threw it across the room into the paper bin (it was a perfect hit).
When he got back, Steve seemed to have something on his mind. "I know you don't want to talk about the divorce – I don't mean to, but I have to ask you something."
There was an itch of wanting in his palm, and if he didn't touch Steve he would go crazy. What was it with touching his chest and retracting, anyway? What was that about? He reached out and, never looking down, pretending nothing was happening, took a hold of Steve's hand. Steve sucked in half a breath, but still just stood there, motionless.
Tony: And come on, this is serious, freedom of the press, media constipation by government order, and all that shit. I'm finding a lot of stuff here I don't like; we can't ignore it.
A peculiar excitement was coursing through Steve. He kept staring at the page, but his mind couldn't focus. He realized he'd read through at least three passages without being aware of one single word, so he went back and, painstakingly, started again. Tony was so close and warm and present, next to him on the bed. Steve had to fight not to keep glancing at him.
They'd never really talked about this. "Brilliant. Brash. Distant." Steve couldn't help a tiny, wistful smile that sneaked onto his face. "Always kept you on edge. You never really knew what hit you or where you stood with him."
"If that's what you want?" he says carefully, and Steve is silent. It doesn't look like a happy type of silence, though. "But," Tony goes on, swallowing nervously, "we could also try strings, if you like? I'm good with strings. I'm... I'm
He has no idea what he's going to say to Steve if he finds him. Still, finding him, talking to him is crucial.
Tony: Honestly, my main problem is... Look, I'll happily pay for anything, but if I really have to pay for someone to listen to me rant, then I don't want it. If that's the only way I can get it, I don't want it.
And Steve's arms around him made him feel almost like he was a part of a completely different world, a world that wasn't half so bad, a world you could actually make something of, if you tried. They were warm and solid and weren't letting go of him.
Strangely enough, his eyes never locked on Steve's. He was doing his best not to look over, true. Maybe Steve was avoiding him as well. Maybe what happened on that gurney was too much. For the umpteenth time Tony promised himself to stay away and leave the guy alone, especially if Steve was in a mild state of brain fog due to exhaustion and painkillers.
It was the same way with that breakup conversation. Tony hadn't been able to talk to people about what happened with him and Pepper, and then he was spilling his thoughts to this Steve. Not his guts, but his
go, not now and not ever, because that wasn't who Steve Rogers was, and that was all there was to it, really. The warmth in his chest made his breath hitch.
Tony: I'm serious. I know you won't talk to me now, but you should talk to someone. Talk to Nat. She's been through shit. She'll understand.
Really, why would he? He was supposed to be the experienced one. I, not so much. I'd had just a few partners in my life, but mostly I was just fumbling around blindly. And he'd slept with Steve, his Steve, so this wasn't really a completely new territory for him, while I could approach the Tony from my timeline only in my dreams.
The sight of Tony, in bed, with eyelids heavy and spots of color in his cheeks did things to Steve he wasn't sure what to do with. He stopped at the door, swallowed.
At the same time: "Captain Rogers was very brave," someone stated by Tony's elbow just as Steve let out an amused snort. Irritated, Tony turned to see Justin Hammer, appearing out of nowhere and insinuating himself into his personal space. Capital.
Tony was never too good at dealing with dislike. When it came from someone like Hammer, sure, he could bask in it like a cat. But when someone on the 'decent person' part of the spectrum dared show it, Tony's mind suddenly went all
Which was when Tony realized he was lying on top of Steve, whose arms were still wrapped around his waist; their faces were so close that the mist of their breath mixed and combined in the icy air. Which was
He imagines Tony looking him up and down, he can almost feel the searing eyes on his skin. He knows it's all in his head, knows he's getting himself worked up. But Tony's presence is like a shot of something ice cold, so cold that it's almost hot, and it makes your head swim, and Steve hasn't had something affect him like this in ages.
was fit to decide someone else's fate in a spur of a moment, to take that responsibility upon himself and neatly transfer a part of it to his superiors. Neatly, like a line in a manual. As if life worked like that.
"We should probably try to come up with some sort of a plan," he said when Steve seemed finished with exercising and started pacing purposelessly.
— and the bond blew open under the force of an emotion too big to control, like metal bending in the face of a high-pressure blast from one of Dernier’s explosives.
Steve flushed again, as he was pretty sure he was intended to, but he did it, angling his other leg out, too, so that Tony had a good view.
He rested a hand against the wall, the cold seeping through his gloves. Exhaling slowly, he swore his breath fogged slightly in the dim light. But it was gone when he blinked.
It at least started with a moderately demure Queen Anne neckline, decorative gold embroidery standing out against the indigo-colored velvet, but it ended with a tight skirt only a couple inches below Gwen’s crotch.  At first when Gwen held the thing up against herself, she thought that was a sizing error, but then Stark had looked up, meeting Gwen’s eyes and quirking one brow in a dare.
The HYDRA minions looked at each other and then back at Steve. Finally one of the largest minions stepped forward, cracking his knuckles menacingly. That was the same guy who’d cracked them before. He must make a living cracking knuckles menacingly.
this, though.  Those few brief tastes of this power he’d had so many years ago— and many more years than they seemed to him now, too— it was only his own self-discipline that had kept him from becoming an addict.  But Tony, Tony was his own personal vintage, the Rogers Reserve blend, and Steve could taste Tony all he wanted...
After a second of regard, the sharp brown gaze became slightly sardonic, but the curiosity and greed remained.  “My dad used to rave about you, you know,” Stark said, her voice pitched lightly, glibly, but with an undertone that hovered on the edge of cruel.  “That marvelous Captain America! How amazing she was, how good!  Guess it's too bad his little girl couldn't follow in her footsteps."
They stood there for a moment, the silence stretching between them. He was suddenly uncomfortably aware of how close they were.
Silence spanned between them, Tony was unsure of what to say, scared to implicate himself too deeply.
He burst through the door, searching the cluttered room for any sign of Tony, and spotted him lying on the floor, on his back. Tony was glaring at the Iron Man suit hoisted above him in the air, and threw his wrench on the concrete floor, muttering about metal parts being ungrateful.
“Do you think I could borrow number 11? The boxed set I bought only has 1 through 10, and I’d really rather not have to wait a couple of days to find out what happens next.”
He’d spent hours doing study after study of Tony. It was remarkably flattering to see the attention Steve had paid to him, even when he’d been too lost in his work to notice.
Tony could hardly keep himself alive, Steve mused, so it fell on him to keep Tony from self-destructing.
It was peculiar, the wait staff had been almost overbearing before Tony arrived, constantly refilling his water when he’d hardly drank any, asking if he was ready to order every few minutes. But ever since Tony arrived they’d been out of sight. Come to think of it, he hadn’t seen anyone who worked here come out from the kitchen for quite a while. That irritated him even more. He was starving, and if he was going to be forced to sit here for god knows how long, at least he could get some food while he was here.
And really, what had just happened? He had been lurking outside of Tony’s bedroom when he happened to hear the crash of machinery falling on Tony’s face. Not that Tony needed to know why he was conveniently close. But that moment in the bathroom had felt different. Quiet somehow. Like they weren’t Iron Man and Cap in that moment.
Tony stepped closer, his chest jutting up against Steve’s, and gave a small thrust of his hips towards him as well. The resulting widening he saw in Steve’s eyes was well worth it. He ground against him, and could feel the other man’s hardness against his own.
“Just trying to work out the math for a new prototype that’s resisting being built,” he said by way of an explanation.
Tony let Steve guide him to one of the shared bathrooms, where they kept first aid supplies. Steve set to work, focused on cleaning the wound and dressing it, while Tony took in his outfit, clearly fascinated by the style choice.
That made Steve burst out laughing, a throaty, deep sound that echoed in the alleyway. Tony gave him a shy smile, before cracking up as well. They laughed until they were panting for breath and leaned into each other, Steve feeling grateful for the solid weight of Tony’s body against him. It felt centering, grounding even.
He really had no one else to talk to, and he didn’t want to think too hard about how pathetic that made him.
“That doesn’t sound like the words of a man who’s earned his pleasure, does it now?” Steve drew out the words, voice lilting as he teased Tony. “It sounds to me like our sessions aren’t doing much good. And here I thought you were learning to listen to me when I told you to be quiet.”
And suddenly Tony was ripping something out of his ear, some kind of ear bud or hearing device, Steve couldn’t quite tell. He shoved the electronic piece into the assistant’s hand, and took off the mic pack they’d attached to him as well, dropping it to the ground with a loud clatter.
He made it through breakfast with minimal commentary on his wardrobe choices, even after Sam and Nat came back from their morning run. Sam seemed more preoccupied with the fact that Steve hadn’t been joining them recently.
Steve spent the next day curled up on the living room couch, working his way through books 4 and 5. Book 5 had dragged a little, and the side plot involving Brock was funny, but a distraction from what he really wanted to read about: Tristan and Sawyer.
There was a groan from what Steve assumed was the kitchen. “Fine,” Sam called out, “But I’ll have to write you a check, I’m all out of cash right now.”
“Nice outfit, Cap. It suits you. You should dress like that more often.” Tony gave him an uncharacteristically shy smile, and then breezed past him, leaving Steve alone in the bathroom, mind racing with what had just happened.
He’d nearly made it back to his bedroom when he realised he’d left his watch on the workshop table. He half-considered leaving it for tomorrow, but he felt a little naked without it, and it bugged him to not feel the cool weight of it against his skin. Tony sighed and doubled back to retrieve it, padding quietly in the dim hallways, careful not to disturb anyone’s sleep.
“It seems especially bad. He was up at 6 am reading some book, didn’t even notice me talking to him, and then he freaked out and tried to hide it. But you know Tony, he made it seem like everything was fine. If I didn’t know him so well I probably would have thought everything was normal.”
Tony. He had to find Tony, had to talk to him about this. His mind was racing as he stepped onto the busy sidewalk. Where was Tony? He couldn’t have gone too far yet. He had to find him.
Tony shot him a guilty glance, shrugged his shoulders and finally spoke again. “They get snowed in at a Christmas tree farm for the holidays. The beginning is a little trite, but there’s plenty of late nights next to fireplace so far. And the innkeeper is the same as in the volume where Tristan is a highwayman who accidentally robs Sawyer’s coach. It’s a nice little touch.”
Tony was a fucking disaster waiting to happen. Sometimes Steve worried the man had little-to-no sense of self-preservation. He’d walk into dangerous and unknown situations, cracking jokes all the while. He’d shrug off injuries that made Steve wince from how bad he knew they must hurt. And he’d go on days-long binges of coffee and junk food when he was working on his projects--that is if he ate at all.
“Yes, I think that’s exactly what you need, to be taught a lesson about respect.” Tony’s whimper turned into another groan as Steve leaned down to whisper in her ear, “And if you’re very good I’ll even let you come.”
He’d forgotten that it was locked. He’d been reading those books so long that he hadn’t even remembered that.
He managed to catch Tony’s eye when he’d wandered into the kitchen to grab lunch. He gave a friendly wave and a nod. Tony looked weary, but offered a small smile in return. It made Steve feel a glimmer of hope that he hadn’t completely ruined things. Tony had smiled a little brighter when he noticed the book in Steve’s hands.
Steve would avoid asking for help, would pretend he didn’t actually want to watch the movie he was struggling to pull Netflix up to watch, or didn’t need help setting up an email account, but Tony knew he was avoiding things because it was easier than admitting he needed help. The world saw him as this big dumb blonde with sexy muscles, and while Tony had to admit the sexy part was spot on, Steve was anything but dumb. He could calculate the right angle and speed to throw his shield in his head, in the middle of combat. He could still quote practically every line from movies he’d grown up seeing in the 30s and 40s. And he could keep up with Bruce and Tony when they talked science, albeit with a few pauses on their part to explain the specifics of quantum theory and the like.
The next day came far too soon for Tony’s liking, the sun’s glare beating in through his half-open blinds.
Tony sputtered, making another grab for the hardcover book, and Steve couldn’t help but give him a sheepish grin as he handed it over.
“So the books, huh?” Tony asked as they walked to the door of his workshop, clearly trying to sound casual. “Did you start reading them before or after that morning in the living room?”
They were standing in the middle of what used to be a busy New York intersection, but was now mostly rubble and a surprising amount of the same green goo that was splattered over both of them. Tony had it worst, it clumped in his hair, oozing slowly down his face and neck.
Steve’s expression faltered when he noticed the sketchbook, cast aside in his sleepiness. He glanced at Tony, who was suddenly making himself very busy with his work.
Steve did his best to smile confidently down at Tony, the anxiety creeping back into his gut. “I heard all that noise and thought you’d been hurt. I should have known better.”
“See, I used to be a Monday and Wednesday kinda gal, but we recently had to make the Tuesday/Thursday switch to accommodate another doctor’s schedule. Is it worth it?” Tony joked back.
Tony laughed, the sound growing from a tentative chuckle to something real, and warm. “You’re not wrong. You’ll just have to wait a while. He comes back in the one where they have to slay a dragon. I think it’s number 17?”
Tony closed his eyes, leaning back into his chair, embarrassment washing over him in waves. “I’m, I’m sorry Steve. I didn’t intend to, but I came back to grab my watch last night and it was just laying there. I never looked at it previously, but I saw the way you’d drawn me. How beautiful you’d made me, and I couldn’t resist. I never meant to break your trust.” He couldn’t bear to look at Steve now, the shame rising in his throat like hot acid.
He helped clean up afterwards, setting the dishwasher to run its cycle, and then realized everyone else had plans for the day. His only plans were to try to run into Tony, but it didn’t seem likely. They hadn’t heard from him all morning.
And Tony really did like Dr. Cho. She was funny and didn’t bullshit them about Rhodey’s progress. And she was damn good at her job. Everyone here was actually pretty fantastic, now that he thought about it. Maybe Rhodey had been right about this place. They just needed a little financial support, and Tony was more than happy to provide that if it meant his best friend was getting great care.
And Steve just laughed, a quiet, nervous laugh, and bent down to touch his forehead to Tony’s, his bashful smile relaxing into an easy grin.
He could feel his need growing, his cock pressing hard and wet against his jeans, and suddenly Steve’s hands were roaming, caressing the exposed skin between his waistband and where his shirt had risen up. His touch was light and sweet, but it made him feel things that he hadn’t felt in a long time, outside of his very private fantasies.
He wanted him to know just how good it could be to break the rules. And then, when Steve finally, desperately started stroking himself, chasing his pleasure, Tony would reward him. Would fuck him so deliciously that Steve would be shaking, utterly spent.
Steve blinked after him, in shock about everything that had just happened. Had he really just admitted to Tony that he’d read the books? This plan was already off the rails before it had even begun.
His hair was rumpled, still a little messy from sleep, and he was wearing his comfiest pajama bottoms. The ones with stripes that he’d had ever since he’d woken up from the near-70 year rest. They were getting old, holes in one of the pockets, and there was a little grease stain on the side from a day he’d forgotten about the bacon cooking and had to keep it from catching fire. But he loved these pants. They reminded him of a simpler time, and were one of the first things he’d ever owned in modern day.
Tony never knew what Steve drew, never felt comfortable asking, to be honest. He’d been tempted more than once to glance through the book when Steve wasn’t there, but no, he’d be respectful of Steve’s privacy. If he wanted to show Tony what he worked on in the workshop then he would, but until then Tony would do the right thing and resist. Even if it got mighty hard to resist temptation sometimes.
He wanted this so badly, wanted to know Tony in a way no one else had, wanted to be given the trust he gave no one else.
He closed the door to his bedroom, making sure to double check the lock, just in case, and then tore into the box, pulling out the ten-book collection. Each cover had a sensual moment illustrated on it, and the artist had done an excellent job portraying that book’s theme. Volume 8, The Lusty Billionaire and the Secret Librarian was especially sultry, and Steve secretly looked forward to reading that one.
Steve’s mission as Captain America had never really been his from the start. He could recognize now that he was a pawn from the get-go. But Tony. Tony had seen destruction and cruelty in the world, had recognized his own involvement in contributing to it, had raged against the man he’d been. People liked to talk big about Tony being the man he is today because of Howard’s money and last name, but he was so much more than that. He was his own creation. He’d torn down the man the world knew him to be, and rebuilt himself from the parts. And it made Steve ache with want.
He settled into his chair at the workbench and picked up the jar of acrid green Symbiote slime. It almost seemed to pulse, but Tony couldn’t tell if that was just his imagination. He knew there was nothing left of the Symbiote it had once been secreted from, he’d immediately run tests to check that when they returned to the Tower. But there was something odd about this stuff. And he wanted to figure out how it worked.
It’s idiotic, but I half wish you were here. You knew him. Knew what he was like. Not fully, not the way I did, but maybe you could catch me. Tell me if I’m veering too much into Howard territory. Some days I can’t tell what’s really me, and what’s me running from him shadow. You never were afraid to call me on my shit. Some days I miss that. Guess today is one of those days.
“Hey there, you okay?” Steve gave a little wave with his hand holding the newspaper to get Tony’s attention. It took a couple seconds, but the dark haired man finally looked up.
A blue t-shirt that was probably a little too tight, but showed off his impeccable muscles and classic blue jeans. This was him. This was his comfort zone. After trying on so many different versions of himself, Steve let out of huff of relief to be back to his old clothes. Though he might keep the cardigan that Tony had said brought out the blue in his eyes in rotation. Scratch that, he would never get rid of that one.
He carefully flipped back through pages and pages of sketches, some in charcoal, some in graphite pencil, a few in what appeared to be Tony’s fineliner drafting pens.
Steve’s hands roamed lower, lower, until they caressed the sensitive skin just above the waistband of his pants, and that hungry look deepened.
Steve had been waiting on his date for 45 minutes, and he would have left by now if not for the camera crew that was there to film the show Bucky had signed him up for. Bucky was forever trying to get Steve to go on dates, so he supposed this was inevitable. ‘There’s only so many Saturday nights you can spend alone sketching and watching The Office reruns until your best friend tries to set you up on national television,’ he thought. Still, being on the show came with a pretty sizable cash prize, and he’d been struggling to find freelance jobs this month, so he wasn’t going to be too picky about how he paid rent. He just had to get through this date, let them air it on some cheesy show about modern romance, and he’d be set. The producers had been very clear about the fact that he’d need to stay through the whole date to get the money though. They’d had some issues with people trying to bow out 10 minutes in, still expecting the cash, they’d said. It made sense. Besides, how bad could a blind date be?
Tony smiled up at him as they sipped their coffee. Steve had perched himself on the desk, his full lips curving into a sweet expression as he drank from his mug. He looked freshly scrubbed and delectable. Tony could see the water droplets still shining in his hair and the slight flush he always got after emerging from a steaming shower. It was adorable and made him want Steve all the more.
Once Tony had closed his eyes again, Steve moved his hand to the other side, rubbing firmly, before striking once again. He kept up this pattern of rubbing between blows, varying which side he focused on. He kept a steady eye on Tony’s reactions, taking note of the pink blossoming across his ass.
What will my pickle and peanut butter sandwich be? I hope it’s black coffee. I always did love the way you scrunched your nose up when I offered you a taste.
Steve just smiled that kind smile again, but Tony thought he could detect a hint of a smirk in there too, like maybe he knew just how flustered he’d been making Tony.
It wasn’t fair, it wasn’t. But Tony was not about to complain because Steve was going faster, putting more pressure on the underside of his tip with each upward stroke and he didn’t know how much more he could take until he lost it.
I hate that it helps. I hate that I miss you. You always loved telling me when I screwed up, when my calculated risks had some poor math behind them. I always hated when you were right. Most times you were right.
He grasped onto the edge of the hardcover and pulled it out, careful not to spill dirt on the carpeted floor.
Tony froze for a second. Even his breath seemed to have halted. He looked up at Steve, and then shoved the book behind the chair he was sitting in.  “Just suit stuff. Trying to improve the thruster output for my jets. It’s not quite as efficient as I’d like.” Again, that would have seemed perfectly reasonable, except he’d set the book into a plant pot behind him. Tony was fiercely protective of his stuff, especially if it was related to his work. He’d once griped for days when Bruce had accidentally spilled coffee on some of his notes. He’d banned anyone from bringing food or drinks into his workshop ever since.
Tony’s eyes darkened, “Now you’re just toying with me. You know I loved that scene when Tristan finally admitted he loved Sawyer.”
It was himself, in soft blacks and greys of the charcoal Steve often worked in. Tony hunched over his desk, eyes concentrated on the containers of various chemicals before him, his delicate hand grasping at a pipette. His features were gorgeous, a striking mixture of hard lines and soft curves. Steve had apparently paid special attention to his lashes and lips, they glinted in the drawing’s light source and gave him an almost ethereal appearance.
I'm gonna sit with this ending for a while. I can't decide if there's more story that needs to be told, but I'm pretty damn pleased with it so far. I hope you are too!
He imagined commanding Tony to strip naked, and kneel, hands behind his back, as Steve tied them together. He’d check to make sure it wasn’t too tight, but there was no way Tony would break free. Steve had spent years learning how to tie perfect knots as a boy, and they would certainly come in handy for what he had in store for Tony.
“Saw what?” he asked, trying in earnest to keep staring at the chemical analysis results on his tablet in front of him.
When he reached the doorway, he gave a quick knock, expecting a response. When none came, he peered in through the opening. That was odd. Tony always kept the door closed.
Although to be fair, this one was already starting off rough. The camera people seemed irritated to be standing around not able to film any usable material, but one of the production assistants had insisted that his date, Tony, would be there shortly. Apparently he’d gotten mixed up on the time and was rushing to arrive. Steve briefly considered asking if he could just go home, but he really needed the cash, and it was getting towards the end of the month.
‘Come to think of it, Tony rushed out pretty much right after me.’ Steve mulled over. ‘There’s no way he forgot—’
By the end of the hour-long appointment, Tony had honestly forgotten about trying to sneak back to check on Rhodey.
And if Steve happened to be too stern after missions, or wanted to analyze the video footage to show Tony just how reckless he was being, who could blame him? Nothing seemed to get through to Tony, so he’d had to resort to being more brash about things.
The whimper Tony gave in response was delicious, full of fear and surprise. But Steve knew he was turned on by the idea. Tony was rutting his hips up against Steve’s cock, desperate for release.
But somehow it makes things a little easier. When I can feel my chest caving in and the world goes blurry I think about what I’d write to you. And it helps.
They hadn’t done more than make out, but it was enough, for now. Steve figured they’d have a lot more time to figure out the rest.
But Tony had been just as absent as usual. Everyone else assumed he was obsessing over something mechanical, but Steve knew differently.
Tears were running down Tony’s face, and before Steve could respond, he bolted out the door, leaving Steve in shocked silence. He sat there for a few long moments, processing everything that had just happened, and then he stood up and followed after Tony. He could hear the show people scrambling to figure out what to do next, calling out his name in a sorry attempt to get him to come back, but he didn’t give them any attention.
He repeated the question, and Tony gave a clipped response, looking annoyed, but there was also something Steve couldn’t quite place. A shade of embarrassment perhaps?
He had skipped lunch and dinner, and it was catching up to him. Steve decided to remedy that, and shuffled towards the kitchen. He was contemplating what would happen in the next volume. Would Tristan find a way to make it up to Sawyer? And what about Brock, the curse specialist who had been introduced in the third book? Steve had a feeling that the author would try to use that to create tension between the men in book 4.
He saw a form fill his peripheral vision and then suddenly there was a person sitting down next to him, on his left side. Tony gave them a glance, startled at what he saw.
Steve wasn’t very familiar with Romance novels, usually preferring swords and spells over descriptions of throbbing tumesences, but he had to admit that the series sounded fun, and maybe even a little bit sexy.
Very private fantasies that just so happened to be about the man who was holding him, sucking on his bottom lip and groaning into his wet mouth in the most deliciously obscene way.
He turned to face Steve, his cheeks on fire and his hand shaking, and Steve was rising, leaving his chair to stride towards him, and it felt like the world might implode around him and he wouldn’t give a single shit about what happened. Because Steve was suddenly leaning down very close to him, his wavering breath close enough to feel.
“Brought you some food and coffee. Figured you’d be here all night and would forget to eat,” Steve’s voice was low and calming, but it startled Tony all the same. “Sorry Tones, I know you get caught up in the work and don’t always hear us come in.”
I can’t decide if everything that happened between us was a mistake. Maybe we were destined to end on these terms. We certainly were headed down this path. But know that I regret how it ended. When I needed you to pull me back, needed you most of all, you pushed me over the edge. Guess I always thought you’d be the one to stop this in the end. Guess I was wrong.
And then Steve was leaping off of the couch, not really thinking about what his body was doing. It was all instinct. He bounded towards the chair, and peered over it into the darkness of the potted tree.
He wanted to let go, to break free of the expectations that the world had for him. He wanted to build himself into a newer, better version of himself. One that was all Steve Rogers and not the Captain the world wanted to see.
Tony wanted to kiss him until he was panting, begging for more. And then he’d fuck him roughly, slamming into him so hard that they’d risk breaking the bed.
Steve chuckled in spite of himself. “Somehow I think you’ll survive. Besides, you have me. And you love antagonizing me.”
I’m gonna try this again. Call it a rough draft. Maybe I’ll clean this up and actually get it sent your way. How do you even mail a letter to a superhuman fugitive? If anyone could figure it out it would be me.
Steve stilled, it seemed like Tony was perfectly safe, albeit frustrated, and he was about to turn to leave when Tony noticed him.
This is by far the longest, most intense smut I've ever written. It was a challenge, but I think you'll enjoy it
“Whoa, what’s with the elbow patches, Cap?” There was a sudden gleam in Clint’s eye that made Steve uncomfortable.
They continued talking, and Tony found himself settling into the ease of the conversation. Steve talked a bit about their friend Sam, who worked at the hospital, and about his hobbies. He was a painter, apparently. Had always loved art as a kid, but didn’t start pursuing it seriously until after coming back from the war.
Thank you to everyone who read the first part and asked me to write a follow up! You all seriously inspire me to keep writing. I hope this does Steve justice.
And the fact that the very object of his sudsy fantasies was still showering was not lost on Tony. In all reality Steve was probably just grossed out from the result of the fight and was making good on his statement about taking a long hot shower to get clean. But part of Tony wanted to believe that Steve was having a little fantasy time himself.
Rhodey would be accompanying him; Jarvis would stay behind, keeping an eye on their supplies and the Iron Man suit. It was just like so many of their other adventures, and Tony was so damn glad that the war was over and he no longer had to deal with the sound of machine fire, the metallic smell of blood, and the screams of the dying and injured.
The ice had retreated from the man’s head, so Tony felt relatively comfortable reaching out to tug off the mask that hid most of the man’s features from view. He was even more handsome now, and Tony could see that his hair was blond.
to find Tony either already asleep—it was quite late—or not in bed at all, if he were still in the lab.  He had maybe, at the outside, expected Tony to wake up when Steve got into bed.
until Gwen was struggling to deepen it.  Whenever Gwen pushed, though, Tasha just pulled back, arching an eyebrow and waiting for Gwen to dial it back again, tantalizingly close but too far for Gwen to just take over.
“Thank you for telling me.” Steve’s hand tightened reassuringly where it was still covering Tony’s. “This is probably selfish of me but…I’m glad you found me.”
Tony waited for a few moments after Rhodey went off to the truck, watching Steve in the back of the truck. He tried to picture Steve betraying him – Steve
Tony’s head was turned away from Steve, looking towards the video screen, which showed Steve’s rear view in larger-than-life high definition.  Steve’s balls were dark, his cock still engorged, although softening.  The position spread his ass cheeks just enough to show off the blue, droplet-shaped head of the plug nestled squarely between them.  The steel ring of the sperm plug was a barely visible glimmer between his thighs.
Tony didn’t answer, busy focusing on his next handhold and where to place his feet. The prickling at the back of his neck was even stronger now, and he actually felt like he was swimming (climbing, really) through something strange.
“I was telling you a story,” Tony grinned.  He reached down with his spare hand and pressed up, putting pressure behind his balls.  “About how I would love to eat you open.  Right?”
Mr. British didn’t answer, though, so Gwen subsided into her bonds, the cold, and the emptiness of the room in front of her.
“I don’t fancy camping down here,” Rhodey said once they were upright again. He rubbed ruefully at the back of his head, where he’d bumped it against a rock that had decided it wanted to ruin his day.
The screen was large—of course it was—and even craning his neck, Steve couldn’t see all of it.  He saw enough to recognize his own
He picked the shield up, eyeing it speculatively. It wasn’t exactly possible to study it in the dim light that Rhodey’s flashlight offered, but his fingers itched to try out a few more experiments and see what it was made of. Metal, sure, but what
“Pretty great, in fact.  I would say.”  Steve started scrubbing at the dried flecks on Tony’s chest.
. And with a shield? Who carries a shield nowadays?” Rhodey reached over to tap his fingers against said shield. “Maybe for Halloween…”
“You can’t just go walking in there!” Rhodey said, shaking him slightly. “We haven’t seen any traps yet, but maybe that’s because
Rhodey studied him for a long moment, eyes dark. “All right,” he said finally, clapping Tony once on the shoulder and squeezing reassuringly. “I trust you. But if he does something…” He trailed off threateningly, the corner of his mouth curling up.
that, loved the intensity of it.  Tasha made a low sound of satisfaction at Gwen’s exclamation, and then it was
Steve was so grateful to hear the instruction that he didn’t hesitate a second.  He reached behind himself, got a firm grip on the base, and pulled slowly, but steadily.  He wasn’t sure what to do with it once it was out; it
Apparently, Tony remembered that moment, too:  he instructed FRIDAY to play the video from the beginning, listening in on their conversation about the “experiment,” lazily jacking himself as Steve-on-screen began to fidget.  It was, Steve knew, a moment before Steve-on-screen was going to look around and see the restraints now attached to the chair...
Tony touched him before he realized he was reaching out, moving over to tug him into his side. He almost froze when he realized what he was doing, but Steve was moving into the embrace like he’d expected it, body shivering violently against Tony’s.
His asshole was twitching from the change, from being held open so long and then released.  It felt, just as Tony had described, swollen and puffy.
), but Steve carried himself with such aplomb that Tony couldn’t help but want to climb all over that.
“A cave?” Tony shrugged, dropping his eyes to peer into the darkness that awaited them. “Pepper will probably come up with some kind of neat description, but that’s all I’ve got.”
It was completely improbable (not impossible because clearly Tony was seeing it happen with his own eyes). But then…this was vibranium they were talking about…
I started this as part of the main fic, decided it didn't fit, and kept it and finished it because I thought it was cute.
he had planned, and going forward was really the only way to test it.  So he just said, "Thanks, FRIDAY," and attempted to lounge sexily.  (Being able to adjust his pose using the camera and video screen helped.  He had casually set out a mirror-sided tissue holder on the bedside table so that he could see exactly what the screen showed, even with his back turned.)
Then why hadn’t Tony seen a single poster to that effect? He hadn’t been part of the war in 1940, at least not the extent he was in the latter three years, but one couldn’t avoid seeing the posters asking people to buy war bonds. Considering how far he’d traveled, he’d seen a lot. And if Steve had been selling them…
“Is that a bad angle?  Your shoulders are tilted, that looks uncomfortable...  You can set down the plug, you know.”
Before Tony could answer, Steve squeezed and stroked, pumping both of their cocks together so that Tony groaned.
Rhodey gave him a look when Tony told Jarvis that he and Steve would be sitting in the back, a look that said he and Tony would be having words.
Tony froze, looking up at him with a betrayed expression.  Steve just rolled his eyes and took Tony’s arm, steering it across Tony’s body.  “Looks like that’s something we both have in common,” he pointed out before dipping his head to kiss Tony’s palm.
“Ah, a captain, hm?” Tony evaluated Steve with a new eye. Still, that uniform definitely wasn’t Army-issued. Not unless the Army suddenly decided it was a great idea to outfit all their men in red, white, and blue. Could one get even more patriotic?
He waited until Steve had managed an affirmation, the bastard.  Steve’s cock was throbbing, the whole length of it.  The head around the stopper was agony.
“Fast forward,” Tony said when the three replays were done.  “Annnd... stop.  God, I will never get tired of this moment...”
He started to move, and Steve clenched his hands into fists at his side as Tony rode him.  He hadn’t been told he could touch, for one thing, and his strength for another...  As Tony bounced him into the mattress, the plug pressed into him on every stroke.  Steve moaned wordlessly and tried for kisses, which sometimes Tony gave him—other times he missed, bounced off-course by the rhythm of the fucking—and Steve tried to think about it, tried to focus on that missed rhythm, because otherwise he was going to come too soon, too soon—Tony needed him to last for him, needed Steve to stay in control while Tony used him...
It was enough for Zemo to aim the gun again, this time at a Steve who was now on his feet and barreling towards them.
Steve shuddered, nodding slightly. He shifted, dropping until his forehead rested against Tony’s left shoulder and the tension seeped out of his muscles. It was like feeling someone turn from ice to water, and Tony felt honored that Steve trusted him enough to show that.
It was strange, but not entirely out of the realm of possibility given all the other shit Tony had seen in his adventures. It was just…magic.
But was it saying hi or goodbye? (Or maybe he was definitely overthinking it because there was no such ghost here.)
Steve smiled at him, the expression soft and gentle. Tony’s breath hitched at the sight, and his chest warmed (definitely not because of his poor heart). Abruptly, he had the urge to kiss Steve and it was only because they were in the back of a jostling truck with no safety equipment that he didn’t.
For his part, Tony wasn’t entirely sure how he was supposed to react. A serum? What kind of serum? Evidently not the Zemo kind since Steve didn’t look crazy. He said as much, grinning all the while.
“It rather does,” Rhodey admitted slowly. “A bit flashy, a bit loud… Yeah, that sounds right up your alley, Tony.”
Opening his eyes, Tony found himself staring at the canvas of a tent. A warm blanket was thrown over him, and he was lying on something that probably wanted to be soft but due to age had lost all hope of ever being soft again. He was shirtless, but his repulsor pump was covering the glass plate protecting his heart, so it must have been some time since they shocked his heart back to life and recharged the apparatus.
Tony wasn’t claustrophobic, but it was getting slightly hard to remember that with how long they’d been in here with only his flashlight for illumination. Having Rhodey here helped, but what didn’t was the squirming in his stomach or the buzzing in his ears.
Steve. And, if he was being honest, he’d been a lost cause the moment Steve opened his eyes in that cave. The moment he’d even stepped foot into that cave, really.
“I didn’t always look like this. It was the serum.” Steve’s smile was pained. “It fixed everything. And I think…maybe it can help you, too. If it’d work on anyone else, it’d have to work on you.”
But Tony's mouth was already closing over one of Steve's nipples, and Tony was right, of course he was right, and Steve did like this—maybe a little too much, truth be told, because Steve immediately started arching and pushing into the warmth and wetness of it.  It was only when Tony put a hand on each of Steve's shoulders and threw his weight behind them that Steve was able to settle down, letting Tony have his way with him.
“It’s okay,” Steve said, sounding like it really was (even though it wasn’t because holy shit this wasn’t
it was.  His mouth dropped open, slack, as he twisted his fingers together.  The stretch was...  It was satisfying.  It didn’t hurt, but it reminded him of the soreness he used to feel after boxing practice, anyway:  like his body was happy to be doing something it shouldn’t.  He pulled out and then shoved back in again, and again, and then scissored his fingers and thrust once again at a different angle.  He could feel his body adjusting to the stretch, enjoying being held open in a way it had never been held before.
Gwen was happy to oblige.  She hadn’t had this much fun since Dernier had taught her how to turn flour sacks into explosives last year—or seven decades ago, she supposed, depending on your perspective.
Gwen felt a little bad for her.  “I don't think anyone else has guessed,” she offered.  She shrugged as much as she could, still strung up like a Christmas goose.  “I really did have the advantage of getting it all at once.  Lets me see the larger pattern.”
Tasha used her hands first, and Gwen was going to remember that, remember the feel of being touched delicately, being spread open, examined,
Tony paused at the door and turned back, eyes dark.  “Whatever you’re thinking about,” he said, “I want it.”
A faint hue dusted Steve’s cheeks. “Maybe…” He averted his gaze. “I’m glad you’re awake, Tony. When you passed out…your heart
“I found you this time, didn’t I?” Tony teased gently, rubbing at the corner of Steve’s eye with his thumb. “Didn’t even know I was looking.”
"Long day," he explained.  He shrugged and dotted a kiss onto the small patch of gray at Tony's temple, the tiny one that Tony refused to admit was there.  "Maybe tomorrow?"
“He was,” Tony said. “The man he is now…” He swallowed, a pang wrenching his heart. “He’s as good as dead after what HYDRA did to him. It’s a serum, and it took years to take effect on him and turn him into what you saw. He’s modified it since and they…they want me for the next Zemo. Only it won’t take as long if they ever manage to get their hands on me.”
“Easy, Steve.  God, look at you...  I could watch this forever, you’re just so...”  Tony’s words trailed off as Steve brought his hand out of his hair again, sucking his thumb into his mouth.  A glance at the mirror showed his lips were red and glistening already where they wrapped around the digit.
Jarvis and Rhodey had taken the opportunity to cause some chaos of their own and Tony was about to join them when the guy he was aiming for went down with a startled yelp.
Hours of sitting in the dark on a bumpy truck didn’t exactly appeal to Tony, but he did have Steve here to help pass the time.
“I’d probably fuck you with my fingers for a while, definitely until you were ready and pleading for it—no, don’t bother now, I know—and then I’d have to think about what I wanted.”  There was another slick sound behind him, and Steve clenched his hole uselessly around his fingers in frustration at not being able to guess what it was.  “I could just take you, of course—I like receiving, but when you’ve got an ass like that open and begging to be filled, well...  There’s not a lot of times when you get an opportunity like that...  I could also use a ring.  You’d like that, I think; you like things that push your boundaries.  Do you know about these?”
“I’m not going to be wearing the suit out here,” Tony said. “The most strenuous thing I’ll be doing is some rock climbing. It’ll be fine.”
“Hey now.” Rhodey sounded offended, glancing down at his not-insignificantly muscular arms in doubt.
Steve was standing right before him, shield up in a defensive position and his legs braced. Tony carefully got out behind him, gun in one hand and finger off the trigger.
Something was still odd, but Steve wasn’t a bad guy. Rhodey probably still harbored doubts, but Tony didn’t (couldn’t).
“How passionate,” Zemo sneered, readying the gun for another shot. “I had no idea you cared so much for your bodyguards, son.”
Tony resisted the urge to retort, instead focusing on staring at the steadily melting ice. The shield was almost out, the star already peeking out from the ice that had encased it.
him – Steve doing anything that seemed remotely villainous, but the picture just didn’t come together. Instead, it gave him a kneejerk reaction of
A shiver ran through Tony. The skin on the back of his neck prickled; when he closed his eyes, he could almost picture what Steve must have looked like as Captain America. He’d seen the outfit already – ruined and tattered as it was (and now stuffed into a bag while Steve wore some of Rhodey’s and Jarvis’s spare clothes) – and Steve didn’t lose any of his commanding presence even in rather ill-fitting clothes (probably had more what with how the shirts just couldn’t really fit over his broad shoulders and amazing muscles).
Steve drifted for a minute after he came, panting on the bed and thinking of nothing as Tony rested his head against Steve's thighs..  The world was fuzzy and soft on the edges, and Tony's hair was just long enough to curl around Steve's fingers as Steve carded his hands through it, a rhythmic, soothing motion.
For a terrifying moment, it felt like the truck would tip over on its side, but then it stabilized. By the time the vehicle was back on all four wheels, Tony’s teeth were grinding and his jaw was so tightly clenched he would probably have jaw pain tomorrow.
Steve shuddered, eyes closing briefly. “It was so cold,” he whispered, trembles wracking his muscular frame.
Steve acknowledged the statement with a nod and a rueful smile. “I was the result.” He gestured with the arm that Tony wasn’t touching (he hadn’t even noticed he’d never let go), hand encompassing his entire (very impressive) body. “I’m still not sure what it did to me beyond the obvious, but clearly it went beyond that since I could survive being frozen in a block of ice.”
Tasha blinked at the intact, upright flute for a second.  “Not long now,” she said, distracted.  Her hand raised to flutter next to her ear, pressing on the conch for a second the same way the techs at SHIELD did before moving on smoothly, rubbing her dangling garnet earrings as if that had been the whole point of the movement.
first time kissing even though it wasn’t. His cheeks flushed and his heart pounded in his chest, beating against the repulsor plate protecting it from the world.
With an incongruously cheerful chirp, a loudspeaker in the corner kicked on.  A cultured male voice, British, tenor, somewhere between the ages of twenty and fifty, greeted her, “Captain Rogers.  Please stay where you are and do not attempt to move.  Your return to consciousness has been reported.  Food is being prepared for you.  An automated server will be with you shortly, and after you, with the other prisoner.  Her condition will be dependent on your good behavior; if you try to escape, she will find that decision... unpleasant.”
Gwen bucked again, but that just drove her snatch harder against Tasha’s knee, sliding them together and
The snow crunched under Tony’s foot – the one that had stepped into the room before Rhodey held him still. It was soft, like it was entirely fresh and not in the middle of a mountain cave that had taken them several hours to traverse. It was…impossible (but clearly not since it was here, so maybe just improbable? He hated magic).
“It’s…” Tony’s eyes scanned the craggy rocks not far from their current location. “It’s not far,” he found himself saying.
“No, it’s just you,” Rhodey disagreed. “I’m not part of this weirdness except as a witness to you meeting a new best buddy.”
that infused his words.  “This is the greatest present I’ve ever gotten in my life, and it’s not even my birthday.  And I know this isn’t your thing, not really.  You just thought it would make me happy, right?”
“I’d sink back on your cock.”  Tony reached down and threw Steve’s legs apart, nudged him until Steve was sitting square on the plug, pressing it into himself.  He threw his leg over Steve’s so that he was sitting in Steve’s lap, grabbed Steve’s dick and wiggled until Steve could feel the slick, loose entrance of him pressed against the head.
She looked like she expected Gwen to say something, but there didn’t seem to be much point to that, so Gwen hung out in her bonds and waited for Tasha to lose patience.  Eventually, Tasha edged her way in front of Gwen and stood, arms crossed, glaring up at her.  When she finally spoke, it was a sulky mutter.  “...How’d you know?”
Tony waited for him, but when Steve didn’t manage to come right that second, he went on.  “Once you were all swollen—engorged—and so sensitive after coming, then I would give you a little more.  Small probing jabs of my tongue, followed by those deep, plunging kisses.  You know the kind.  A little bit of suction.  I’d suck your pretty red asshole until you were begging for it.”
Tony shoved those thoughts in a dark corner to be brought back once he was in his own bedroom, focusing on the here and now. Zemo might be temporarily knocked down, but there were still his minions to take care of.
“Yeah.”  Tony’s words were low and fervent.  His eyes on Steve felt like warmth off a fire.  Steve found his hand moving, small little movements that wouldn’t jostle too much.  “Oh, you’re so good, Steve.”
Tony staggered into the chair like a dying man.  "Okay," he said, "okay.  That, that's—fine.  We can do that—
Steve frowned, and sucked absently on his fingers, which were still hovering next to his face, as he tried to think.  He pulled them out of his mouth again with a pop.  “I could, I’m just... less close.  Than I would be, otherwise, I mean.”
a distortion.  He could feel it, at least.  And when he twisted again, the torsion dragged at the sides of his hole, and that
Tony didn’t hesitate before wrapping an arm around Steve’s broad shoulders, keenly reminded of when he’d done this before in a dark cave. Just like that time, Steve leaned into the touch, resting his head on Tony’s shoulder.
He stroked them again.  They were both close already, he knew.  It wouldn’t take long... He slowed his strokes, lightened his grasp.  He rubbed his thumb sweetly under the head of Stark’s cock, trying to make Stark beg.
It was freezing cold away from the warmth of the campfire, and Tony wrapped his arms around himself, shivering as he walked over to the base of the boulder. “You okay out here?” Steve didn’t like the cold. …Right?
“Nothing much, really,” Steve said casually, shrugging. “But you’ll have to go through me, and I guarantee that won’t be easy.”
Taking the flashlight Rhodey handed him, Tony turned it on and pointed it into the darkness to get a better idea of what they were in for. There really wasn’t much to see beyond the fact that there was indeed solid ground a good dozen feet below them. The cave went on further, but the light of the flashlight didn’t go that far.
and that was all Steve needed to be a little bit brave.  "I thought you might like to watch, maybe."  Steve tilted his head at the screen.  "Either angle."
Steve broke away with a ragged gasp, pressing his face to Tony’s neck and shuddering. His face felt hot against Tony’s skin and his breathing rapid like he’d run a marathon without stopping.
“Or!  Or.  We could attach it to a wall.”  Tony was spitting the fantasy out as a torture, now; Steve listened, his hips hitching helplessly as he drove the plug in and out of himself.  “The vibe.  Attach it sideways and let you rut back against it like a bitch in heat.  Like you’re doing now.  Would you like that?”
And if Steve was American (which his occasional Brooklyn accent gave him away as), then there was little reason for him to not know who Tony Stark was (even if that made Tony sound really conceited).
Her dress that day was a lovely A-line thing.  It clung close through her torso to the top of her hips and then flared magnificently.  The bodice was strapped, with a sweetheart neckline that Gwen both loved and hated at the same time.  The color was bronze, but the lower hem had an ivory flower splashed across it.  It was
"Soft," Steve answered.  He felt like he was soaring, flying, as he watched Tony’s face go dark and intent.  "I was surprised—good surprised.  I thought it would scratch."
She smiled at Stark again, because she was free from SHIELD for one night in a dress she was certain they had not signed off on, with a dangerous woman Gwen was certain they didn’t entirely approve of.  And because she thought Stark might find the sheer warmth of her smile either confusing, or confounding, or both.
She froze, her gaze darting back up to Gwen nervously.  Gwen beamed and kissed her in response, gently.  No pressure; it wasn’t the time for that.
(being practically married to electricity to keep his heart pumping was not something he wanted in the long run. Longer run).
“There’s more where that came from,” Steve said, no longer in a defensive position. It should have looked ridiculous given he was in borrowed clothes that were at once a bit short (his pants were an inch above his ankles) and too tight (the seams of his shirt looked like they were liable to burst at any moment and Tony would be first in line with a loud
normal.  Steve twisted it a little, pushing at the sides of his entrance, then withdrew for more slick.
Tony realized he’d been staring rather dopily at Steve for too long to be brushed off as casual. He managed a relaxed grin and shook his head, jogging lightly over to the truck and accepting Steve’s hand as he clambered into the back of the truck.
Steve smiled.  Meeting Tony’s eyes, he licked the last of the pearly mess off his palm.  Tony had liked that, he remembered, when he had done it last night.
“Ha.” Rhodey scratched the side of his neck, looking to the side. “Seriously. There’s something off about this place.”
Steve shot him a look as nonplussed as he actually felt.  It would probably be unfair of him to send Tony a vision of himself on his knees, slowly slicking himself and working himself open, waiting, eager,
But Steve had gone up against HYDRA before, hadn’t he? So it was likely that he and Zemo had crossed paths. Even if Zemo didn’t seem to care.
Regardless, this tiny village in Nepal was the opposite of the war front. It was so small that it didn’t even show up on any maps. The mountains had lot of those villages, but it was this one that Tony was interested in because of its proximity to what he was looking for.
“And that suit of yours,” Steve said, grinning. “The one you told me about. It must have made them furious that they couldn’t figure it out. I can’t believe you can fly in it.”
Steve liked watching Tony; liked observing the world, in general.  Something about taking note of the tiny details was satisfying to him, was one of his strengths as an artist.  In architectural studies, he was able to note down the imperfections in form which brought realism: the broken downspout on the far corner, the uneven cornices, the cracked sidewalk...
It wasn’t just a star, Tony realized as he kept the light trained on it. It was surrounded by what seemed to be circles of color. It was clearly metallic, gleaming in the light in a way that the snow and ice didn’t.
Tasha was already wet by the time Gwen managed to get her mouth on her, her folds glistening with her own juices, smelling salty and musty, tasting delicious.  Tangier than Gwen’s own slick.  Her labia were dusky colored and slim, the inner lips showing between them in a line, a single drop of clear liquid threatening to fall from them.  Gwen caught it with her tongue, licking up along the delicate inner skin to Tasha’s clit.
he came so hard, and he must have been shouting, because his throat felt hoarse once he came down.  He was still tipped back and spread open, and the ejaculate had smeared all over his abs, droozling down to pool around the hand he had holding his balls up.  He absently let them go to scoop up the jism and smear it across his chest, not even thinking about it, just wanting to be marked.  When he was done, he licked his hand clean.
Tony shook his head in answer, meeting Rhodey’s eyes in the increasingly dim light of his flashlight. They would need to get out of here soon. Tony’s light was still good to go, but they hadn’t planned to spend more than a day spelunking.
No, this had been a special occasion; Steve was sure of it.  And Tony hadn’t been expecting him back, so who
“It’ll be advanced science,” Tony said, nibbling at the edge of his ration and trying not to think about the consistency of what he was chewing. “Science we haven’t gotten to yet.”
And then she heard it: a chuckle, warm and devious as chocolate but sending a chill along Gwen’s spine.
“I…” Tony blinked, the light on the star wavering as his hand dropped slightly. There was…something else in there. Something much darker than what he’d seen so far.
“Tony being good in there?” Rhodey’s voice was loud, startling both of them. “He’s not supposed to do anything strenuous despite what he might be trying to tell you.”
Contrary to what most people thought when they pictured mountains, it wasn’t like there were flatlands one moment and then – bam – mountains the next moment. There was always a gradual adjustment, sloping hills, some not-so-sloping hills, and mountain peaks in the distance.
“You’re gonna kill me.”  Tony said it like it was a revelation.  “And I’m gonna die happy.  How’re you feeling right now?”
Reaching out to touch the ice again, ignoring Rhodey’s disgruntled muttering, Tony noted that it still had a ways left to go before it was entirely melted. He wasn’t planning on going anywhere in the meantime, so sitting and waiting here would have to do it.
I like to imagine you’d get these some day. Some well meaning historian would find these letters years after my death and would show them to you. And they’d probably write a whole book about my secret letters and the insight into our relationship they offer.
The production assistant shook her head angrily, and Steve could hear Tony tell her, “I’m not fucking doing this any more! I was told all I had to do was show up late, pretend I was mildly bored and make sure the conversation was a little awkward. I wasn’t happy about it, but there was no way I was going to pass up that much money. This, however? This is just downright cruel! He’s a really nice guy, and he doesn’t deserve any of this! God, I hate myself that I let it get this far. No amount of money is worth fucking with someone’s head like this. I’m done. I’m done with your fucked up little game and I’m done being an asshole to a really sweet guy who has absolutely no clue what’s going on.”
He probably wasn’t Tony’s type, but something in his head told him he had to at least try. That he’d spend the rest of his life regretting it if he didn’t.
You’ve made me a better person, Tony. Knowing you, being friends with you--hell, loving you, has made me a better person.
Steve shot him a warning glare, “And what would they think if they found out their favorite cocky billionaire was a nerd who spends most nights tinkering in his workshop when he’s not arguing with Clint over which Star Trek movie is superior? Would really put a damper on that playboy image if they knew you hadn’t been out on a date in years.”
He shifted again in the ornamental chair. It was starting to dig into his lower back and he wondered if he could ask the wait staff for a different one.
“That’s what I thought, hm?” Steve kept eye contact with Tony, whose head was still turned sideways, one cheek against the floor. “Maybe my methods outside the bedroom aren’t enough, it seems like you need to be held accountable for your words and actions. Punished, one might even say.”
Mindlessly, he rutted up into Steve’s hand, chasing the sensation. He probably looked like a desperate mess, but he didn’t care, not when it felt this good.
So he settled for stolen glances across the meeting room table. And if Steve happened to notice the way Tony’s eyes lit up when one of them had made coffee, or the way his body would sink in relief when he settled onto a couch after a long night in his workshop, Steve could tell himself he was just concerned.
He needed Tony on his side. Needed his brilliant mind and creative problem solving. But Steve wished he didn’t have to worry about Tony’s ability to keep himself alive, let alone thrive.
So he threw weeks worth of work on the ground, reveling in the way it echoed, and waited, knowing that Steve couldn’t resist telling him to respect the shared space of the compound. Fuck that. He had bigger plans.
The slime dripped on Tony’s shoulder, green and viscous. He shuddered from the chill of it, and raised a hand to wipe it away.
Steve had laughed hard at that, “I know exactly what you mean, Bucky threw a fit when I suggested using my savings to have him see a specialist at a private hospital. I gave up on that idea real fast, so we’ve been coming here ever since. Plus Dr. Cho is great. We’re lucky to have her here. I still worry so much about him, but the work they’ve done to help Bucky is incredible.”
He was straight up rambling now, his usual collected charm totally gone. There was a wild look in his eyes and he seemed anxious to get Steve out of the room.
Tony wanted to see him plead for mercy. Because of course Steve would be good. If Tony told him not to touch himself he’d listen. He’d be a good boy and would do whatever Tony told him. And that pissed Tony off too.
‘I guess I’ll just have to go back to being myself again,’ Steve thought to himself. ‘No more lumberjack or explorer or suave billionaire identity to channel anymore. Just me.’
As Steve turned to leave, unsure of what to say but wanting so badly to stay by Tony’s side, he felt Tony grab his arm.
The living room was dark and peaceful. Steve settled onto the couch, eager to find out about the results of a local election. He finished that story, then one about proposed school bus drivers’ salary increases. And then one about a hit and run that happened in broad daylight.
Warm and soft and so so right. Steve closed his eyes and relaxed into the kiss, all pretense and anxiety washing away. This was just him and Tony, doing what they’d been destined to do for a long time. He deepened the kiss, chasing after the warmth and wetness that was Tony’s mouth, and as he brought a hand up to cup the back of Tony’s head, he could hear the moan Tony let out, full of pleasure and want and need. He never wanted to stop hearing that noise. A sound just for him. A sound he’d made happen.
“I think that sounds like a perfect plan,” Tony smirked up at him, pressing his body up against Steve’s in the most delicious way. “Maybe we will get that perfect ending we talked about.”
“Rhodey. Uhm. I’m here for my best friend Rhodey. He got injured while serving too. We’re hoping he might be able to walk again, but it’s not looking great so far. I was in Afghanistan, on business, and I got pretty badly injured there. I can only imagine what he’s going through though...” He rubbed at his chest, it still twinged with pain sometimes.
I know you thought I was choosing Bucky over you. I guess in that moment you weren’t wrong. But in my head there was no you vs. him. There was just me, always trying to protect my friends. And when the world was coming after Bucky, I did what I always do, and looked after him.
And it was easy. Easy to love him. Easy to tease him and flirt and wish for more. Easy to imagine what their life could be like if he had the guts to tell him. Easy to imagine what it would be like for Steve to love him back.
And Steve saw the man he was now. Self-sacrificing. Generous. Deeply loyal. Those were all things he admired about Tony. Things that made him so attracted to him.
Fuck him. God, sometimes Tony wished he could. He wanted to shove Steve up against the wall after a frustrating mission and take out all his anger. He wanted to pin him down until little bruises formed on his gorgeous smooth skin. They’d start fading almost immediately. Fucking serum. He wondered how tight he’d have to grip onto Steve’s hips to make the marks last more than a few minutes. How hard would he have to bite to leave marks on his chest?
“Uhm…” Tony would pause, mind going uncharacteristically blank as he struggled to think coherently through the fog of desire. “I’ve been very good. I’ve done what you asked me to. Please.” That last word would come out as little more than a breath, so quiet Steve could barely catch it.
That was real, wasn’t it? No pretenses, no alter ego to hide behind. That was the real you, in those late nights when your hair was rumpled and you had grease stains on your shirt. In those moments I could see a future. I could see you.
I always did like to rile you up. The way your neck would rise with heat. And your jaw would lock into place. And the vein in your temple that would pulse. I still see it now. See the way you’d square your shoulders, straighten your back. I guess old habits die hard. You always looked like a soldier in that moment. Not the Captain everyone else knew you to be.
But Steve. Steven Fucking Rogers. They’d butted heads from the start. At first Tony kind of liked him. He liked teasing him and the way Steve would turn crimson at Tony’s jokes. Tony had even suspected that Steve liked being challenged on occasion.
“After,” Steve admitted reluctantly. “I may have gone back to find out what you were reading and gotten some inspiration”
Tony found that his inventions turned out better when Steve was around. He was calmer and more clear headed about the task at hand, and it didn’t hurt to have someone to bounce occasional ideas off of. They made a good team, on and off the battlefield, Tony was realizing.
“It’s just so unlike you, man. You used to drag my ass out of bed at 4 am on Sundays just to get to the trails before sunrise,” Sam insisted.
The first book, The Lusty Billionaire and the Reluctant Botanist had been such a breakout success that the author had signed on to a massive book deal.
He glanced at the chair, heat rising in his cheeks as Steve entered, a blissful smile on his face as he sipped from his coffee mug, another one proffered to Tony by way of his usual table slide method. He kept humming, and it was most definitely that song, Tony decided. He felt proud to have introduced Steve to a new favorite.
He darted a look in Steve’s direction before handing him a glass full of assorted pens he used for drafting, which he kept around for the times he felt the need to do it old school style.
They turned to see Natasha a few feet away, a plate of food splattered on the ground. She didn’t seem to care about it, as she called out, “Sam, Clint you owe me money!”
Tony’s breathing was frenetic as he pumped into Steve’s hand. He took one last shuddering breath before giving in to his orgasm, a thick stream of wet come splattering on Steve’s hand and chest. He panted, collapsing into Steve’s arms, His cock twitching in response to Steve rubbing the head, tiny aftershocks that made him gasp.
He groaned, wanting more. No, needing more. He’d spent so fucking long thinking about this, never expecting his fantasies to be acted out. And fuck, this was really happening.
“Yes! Bacon and eggs would be great. Why don’t you start on it and I’ll go get changed?” Tony sniffed at his shirt, “I’m pretty sure I’ve been wearing the same clothes for days.”
After the meal, Bruce and Clint offered to clean up. Tony had vanished almost immediately, mumbling about needing to talk to JARVIS about something. Everyone else dispersed into different parts of the compound.
So maybe this blind date had been a disaster after all, and he was totally gonna make Bucky cough up the money he would have earned for putting him through that, but he’d met a really interesting guy, who’d felt awful about the things he’d been talked into doing. And besides, this would make a really great story to tell about how they got together.
It lay open on his stuffed chair, and Tony hadn’t meant to see it, hadn’t wanted to pry, but it was what was drawn on the page that truly made him take notice.
He’d given Tony a look when they entered for the first time since the remodel, but hadn’t asked him if he was responsible, so Tony took it as an acceptance of his peace offering, so to speak.
But instead, he was staring at his phone’s home screen, fingers hovering over apps to be selected. But he just kept staring, unsure of what to do next.
Thankfully, the slime came off fairly easily with soap and water. Something about the molecules of the alien ooze worked surprisingly similar to oil molecules, Tony posited. Before his shower he had managed to slough off a fair amount of it into a container for further study, and he was glad he’d had the forethought to save it. This stuff was fascinating.
“I like this version of you best,” Tony said, eyes fluttering closed. He shifted on his side, opening his eyes again to peer up at Steve.
And then Steve would trace his fingers feather-light against Tony’s tanned skin, noticing the shivers he caused. He wanted to savor this moment. This perfect moment when Tony was laid before him, eagerly submitting to him. He’d tease Tony, fingers dancing down his spine, caressing his ass and ghosting along his sides. Steve loved the foreplay of it all. He loved the idea of getting Tony worked up until he was begging for more.
They both sit on Steve’s bed, and he makes Steve lean back against the wall so Tony can straddle his lap. His nerves try to swarm up in his stomach, but he nips them down quickly. Steve would never judge him, at least not
