It’s not a practice he’s unfamiliar with: Howard is not a fan of the whole concept, and his mom taught him from a very early age how to hide them, be it with clothes or jewellery or makeup.
"That will be all, Ms. Potts."
(And how he’s terrified, even if he won’t admit it to himself, that the flowers on his soulmate’s skin -if he does have one- disappeared along with the scars on his own body.)
He doesn’t wonder, and doesn’t think about it at all.
Steve gets older, and the soulmarks don’t appear.
The night before his parents’ funeral, Tony presses his fingers against his flowers until his hands go numb from the cold.
Next part should be up relatively soon-ish! It's written, just missing final edits. Meanwhile, leave kudos or comments or both! Don't be shy.
(He feels immediately guilty afterwards, remembering the way Ma seems to shrink within herself whenever she looks at her own gray patterns.)
His shirt is ripped open, and for the first time Tony sees the flowers that cover a large part of his neck: Yinsen had described the flowers as a beautiful purple, full of colour and life.
As it was bound to happen, the topic of soulflowers comes up among the Commandos: one night in a break between missions, around the campfire, when they’re sharing their rations for that day’s dinner.
Iron Man helps him get it back.
(Reminding him he’s not alone.)
Good thing nobody does.
In another life, he thinks they could have worked out as something more than friends.
The ones on his neck are wilted, grey. Dead.
By the time he has buried Ma and the war comes, Steve has grown resigned to the idea that he doesn’t have a soulmate after all.
Bucky gets drafted.
(Jarvis and Anna do match, though, and Tony likes the way they look at each other whenever he watches them from afar. He is a child, with a child’s dreams, and he looks at his own flowers and imagines looking at someone the way Jarvis looks at his wife.)
in the first place.
A conversation with a German doctor later, Steve gets his chance.
But in this one, she brings him coffee with a tired smile and says, “Will that be all Mr. Stark?”
Steve does; he has always been small for his age, so he has no problem in climbing onto her lap and cuddling close. She cradles his face in her hands, brushing a rebel strand of hair from his forehead.
,” she says, placing feather kisses on the top of his head. “You’ll see as you get older.”
Steve stares a tad too long at his Ma’s flowers, wilted and dry, marking the absence of his father, before asking about his own.
Bucky wants to take the girls dancing. Steve is decided to try again.
Steve tries to believe him, he does, but the more time passes and not even the tiniest of petals appears, the less he believes Ma’s words, the less he believes there is someone for him.
He smiles back at her, incredibly grateful that she decided to stay; not because she is bound to him by fate, but because she chooses to.
means 'my love'. If anyone speaks Gaelic and could confirm or correct me, is very welcome to do so.
(See the end of the chapter for
She doesn’t ask about his own; it’s not proper. He limits himself to nod, and to point out another alley where he was beaten to a pulp.
In the middle of laughter from the rest of the Commandos and completely distracted from the topic of soulflowers, Steve shoves his best friend with one shoulder, cheeks coloured red and a grateful look in his eyes.
. He gives one last look to his blank hands before closing his eyes; for the first time, he is grateful he has no one to leave behind.
Tony doesn’t plan to.
Erskine’s flowers are wilted, like his Ma’s were.
Steve is way too nervous and has too many things on his mind to feel self-conscious about being shirtless in front of everybody else, but he still feels the stares, and he knows they wonder where his flowers are.
Soulmarks like that, on the face or neck, tend to be worrying, but Peggy handles the stares and hushed questions with the same grace and poise she does everything else.
Steve is well on his fourth try to get into the army, and Bucky
(Whenever things in Tony’s life get too taxing, whenever Howard’s disappointed stare cuts too deep, whenever his classmates’ sneers and thinly-veiled insults are too much to handle, Tony presses his fingers against the flowers: the freezing feeling anchoring him to reality, if only for a moment.)
“I’m going to my family. You go back to yours.”
means 'little one' or 'little man', and
Pepper is the second person Tony trusts enough for, well, everything.
“Even with all that, you just feel it. In your head and chest and heart. You know when you see ‘em for the first time.”
At some point, Morita asks Steve if the serum did something to his soulmarks. Caught completely off guard, Steve doesn’t know how to say he didn’t have
Bucky, as always, comes to his rescue by asking if the serum did something to, ehem,
He’s in his workshop, metaphorical elbows deep in binary code to a (hopefully) better AI than Dum-E, when he sees the flower on his forearm become transparent; it doesn’t hurt, but it tingles in a strange way, and Tony can’t, won’t, stop staring at it until it slowly but surely regains its colour again.
Creepier is the way he laughs when he says his flowers burned along with his skin.
In a cave in Afghanistan, Yinsen is bleeding out and there is nothing Tony can do about it.
(Absurdly, and only for a fleeting moment, he wishes he had a couple of scars on his left eyebrow.)
“Why are you here,” Tony asks with a tongue that feels made of lead, cursing through his teeth the sunlight that manages its way into the room.
) he notices that all his scars have disappeared: the one on his knee, from when he wanted to prove Bucky he could jump over the ladder and failed miserably; the one on his forearm, from that time he got too close to the fire and Ma scolded him for hours. All the marks that made a map of his life on his body just, gone. Erased by the serum as if they never had been there.
At school, he goes out of his way to keep the damn things covered.
Vaguely, he wonders how much older they must be than him, since there are so many scars on their body already.
He shakes his head, takes a deep breath, enters the pod. He doesn’t have time to care about the rest.
Tony will deny it later but, at the moment, he outright panics.
Bucky is the only other person he knows that doesn’t have any flowers either, and it doesn’t bother him half as much as it does Steve.
When Steve first gets the chance to look at his body after the serum (when his chest isn’t heaving from running, when he hasn’t just chased a madman, when he hasn’t just seen a good man
(Sometimes, and only sometimes, he wishes he had wilted flowers, like his mother. A dead soulmate might be better than none at all.)
Red Skull’s face is creepy enough on its own.
She sits on the chair in front of him. “Come here,
According to google,
Tony Stark loses a part of himself in the middle of an Afghani desert.
When Steve first asks about the wilted flowers that cover his mother’s back, he is six years old and his Ma has barely started on dinner.
parts of his body.
At some point when Tony is forty years old, his soulmarks stop feeling ice cold. Tony, currently dying of palladium poisoning, doesn’t notice it.
Steve doesn’t wonder if it means they are gone from his soulmate’s body as well.
Her smile comes easier this time.
“You idiot.” Rhodey shoves him with one shoulder even as he helps him sit upright. “Because I care.”
Steve barely, and just barely, pulls his punch just enough not to fully shatter the man’s jaw.
Peggy has a couple of tiny flowers curled around her left eyebrow.
That doesn’t mean he has to
It’s one night after he has pulled Tony off the floor of another bar, after he has led him back to their dorm, half dragging Tony, half trying to keep them both standing. Rhodey doesn’t leave, doesn’t just dump him in bed and waits to see if the next morning hangover will teach him not to drink too expensive liquor with strangers (it won’t); no, Rhodey stays and helps Tony into a very cold shower and leaves a glass of water and two aspirins for when he wakes up.
One by one, they lose colour and, for a moment, it looks like they will disappear completely.
) someone offhandedly comments how it was a good thing Bucky didn’t have any soulflowers. Less people to inform of a casualty like that.
She is a powerhouse all on her own right, confident and beautiful and wickedly smart, refusing to put up with any of his bullshit with an amount of dignity he wishes he could imitate.
It’s one of the rare instances where Ma is not in her hospital uniform, but is instead wearing something more comfortable, with a lower neck that allows some of the dead leaves to peek outside. Steve is supposed to be working on his homework, bite-marked pencil between his fingers, but Ma’s back was turned on him, and he got distracted by the sight of the grey flowers Ma usually takes so much time hiding from view.
He curses the fact that he can’t get drunk for a long time.
He understands why; if all of his medical conditions didn’t immediately get him rejected, he supposes he would have gotten the call as well. Soulmate-less people are easier to send to war.
also, I think that Steve's father wasn't really a great man...? but for purposes of this fic he will be, pls and thnk u.
She starts telling him about soulmates, about scars and flowers and the beauty of both. She shows him the scar on her pinky finger, and tells him about how his father had a pattern of flowers and vines on the very same spot. They are a blessing, she says, a way to connect soulmates to one another, to always carry a piece of them within you.
“So many people forget that the first country the Nazis invaded was their own.”
She is exactly what he needs.
Her smile falters as she tells him that, when a soulmate dies, the flowers die with them.
Tony is born with blue flowers covering his skin. Under his right knee, over his left forearm, on the lower part of his stomach… There are too many of them and Tony spends hours memorising them, tracing the patterns they make with the pads of his fingers.
Sometimes, heartbreak isn’t pain. It’s just nothing but numbness.
“Yeah.”
Instead, they break up on a Tuesday, with the rain pelting the windowpane and the midnight silence stifling.
“You’re just afraid you’ll lose.”
“And I have the serum. You don’t—”
Tony groans, ready to fling himself off the balcony.
“Oh.”
Ever since Tony pulled him out of the ice, Steve’s been in love with him. It wasn’t difficult to. Tony’s the first person who truly made him feel welcomed in the future, who sheltered him from SHIELD for as long as he could, who gave him a home. Tony, who is smart and funny and kind and everything Steve loves.
Tony’s eager to argue, to ask Thor to ease the weather for them. But one look at him and Tony knows that wouldn’t be the best idea.
It’s a tight fit but they manage to make it work. Tony slots in easily between Steve and Natasha, his face buried in Steve’s chest. It’s everything Steve dreams of.
The good captain looks terribly uncomfortable in his sodden uniform. Tony could imagine how he feels, especially with that ugly cowl plastered to his face like a second skin.
The engagement ring is nothing glamorous – a titanium band with a gold inlay and a tiny ruby nestled in the middle. Steve even had it engraved with the words ‘
Usually, Steve would throw on his usual outfit – a T-shirt or a plaid shirt, layering it with a jacket depending on the weather. A pair of jeans. Boots.
If only Tony isn't straight.
Clint rolls his eyes, leaning against the doorway with his arms crossed. “I’d take more offense to that if I didn’t know better.” He raises an eyebrow, giving Tony a once-over. “You chickened out again?”
Tony frowns, glaring down at the drink. “This isn’t coffee.”
“Tony!” he hears that voice call him over pulsating beats. “Is that you?”
Steve scowls, dropping his hand. “Tony—”
“The stocks have skyrocketed. And you know how often the board’s been on my ass since I became Iron Man.”
“Yinsen?”
Steve’s eyes drift down to his shoes.
“—and that’s why everyone isn’t allowed to buy, own, or eat Snickers ever again.”
“What those kids were saying.”
“It’s fine.”
“No, we weren’t.”
Guilt seeps into his heart. Tony can’t stand the sight of a kid getting upset, especially because of him. Even after all this time, Kamala’s still a little starstruck and nervous around all of them. Tony gets it. He’s known Steve for years and he still pinches himself about it from time to time.
“Steven Grant Rogers,” Natasha begins, a hint of amusement in her tone, “never thought I’d see the day you quit on going after what you want.”
“Didn’t need to know that either.”
But then he remembers why he never did all the other times before.
“Hey, JARVIS?” Steve begins as he dresses. “Could you order my usual from Gustavo’s?”
“What was that about?”
“Nah, it’s no biggie. Anything for my favorite Avenger. Besides, there are Muslims in SHIELD and the Resistance and well, I’m pretty sure you know I don’t drink anymore.” He leans forward to whisper conspiratorily. “We don’t need everyone getting super rowdy here, anyway.”
“I didn’t think salsa dips were a thing on Asgard.”
“You know he’s going to hate this, right?”
“Yeah.” Tony’s grin fades, dropping his milkshake onto the ground. “Yeah, we did.”
“When we first met.”
Steve sighs, slumping. “Sharon—”
They take their leave with their jackets in hand, not before Tony leaving a hundred dollar tip. Next to him, Steve breaks into a smile that looks surprisingly fond.
? Earth to Spangles?”
Once, Tony attends an exhibition Steve is participating in.
She rolls her eyes, nudging her head in Tony’s direction. “Typical Tony. Of course you’d forget to talk about me to one of your best friends. Sounds like
Steven Grant Rogers who Tony once loved.
Natasha frowns, pursing her lips.
“This isn’t about quitting,” Steve snaps. “This is about common decency. I’m not going to come between their relationship just because of—of…”
“Yes, really. I wouldn’t have asked her to go out with you if I did.”
Steve hates him. And Steve will always hate him. Because he’s from the Infinity War line and Tony’s from Civil War
Tony quickly collects himself, snorting in response. “Didn’t I tell you that the best kind of entrance is a fashionably late one?”
Steve reaches for his hand towel, dabbing the sweat trickling down his head and cheeks. “Uh, JARVIS? Who—”
Each time, Steve would tell him, “You should stop. I don’t want you to keep getting in trouble.”
As hilarious as it is to watch Hammer pale and cower, Tony would rather avoid a scandal. Though then again, that’s definitely unavoidable given that one, Hammer’s a snitch and two, there’s probably reporters and journalists moonlighting among the rich and famous right now.
Tony flinches.
All of his friends stand on the other side, clutching bags of takeout and fiery determination radiating from them.
, he thinks because it’s easier for Tony not to.
He never expected Steve to look and sound wounded.
Tony cocks an eyebrow.
Steve straightens in his seat. “You heard me.”
“Thought you’d go for the Frosted Flakes.”
“Because he’s on the run.”
“Come on, Cap,” Clint says. “We all know Tony needs some pick-me-up. Locking himself up and moping over his last breakup isn’t healthy.”
Steve being bisexual is old news, given how he came out to the press after being bombarded with questions about Tony’s sexuality back in the early days. But the fact that
Steve who’s dressed as Captain fucking America without his cowl on.
sorry,” Steve says, smirking. “Well, sorry not sorry.”
“That’s how it is,” Tony echoes.
“I think it’s a great idea.”
Steve’s standing on the other end of the room, throwing his head back in laughter as he converses with Dugan. His shirt sleeves are now pushed up his elbows, showing off his toned arms.
Tony groans, pocketing the ring box. “Jeez, Rogers. Why’d you think I brought it up in the first place? I was so gone for you back then. So,
Tony’s lips part, most likely to call him out on the deception, when thankfully Natasha cuts in.
It’s a thought that’s been circling Tony’s mind since the moment he was shot out of the sky. Rhodey had insisted on accompanying him like he always does. Tony had been dangerously arrogant, insisting Rhodey take on a nearby convoy instead. After all, Tony’s done this one too many times before. He could destroy Nazi bases with his eyes closed if he tried.
One morning, he wakes up. Packs his bags and decides,
She jabs a thumb to her chest. “Ex-Air Force.”
Steve has always been a shitty liar, even to himself.
Without alcohol, what’s to stop him from losing himself again?
“I, uh—” Steve rubs the back of his neck, his cheeks darkening. “I didn’t— I didn’t mean to—”
“Steve?”
Like the angel she is, Sharon helps him slip away before the exhibition ends. Steve’s definitely going to give her a raise. Or set her up with an Avenger.
“But what if I ruin things?” Tony whispers. “What if—”
“I— Er—” Tony harrumphs, his face a deep crimson and wow, Steve did this. Steve made him blush this intensely. It’s something. “Marry me?”
“Nah. Don’t worry about it.”
Steve jerks back as if he’s been stung.
Tony quirked an eyebrow. “What makes you think I don’t?”
Everyone else offers their own goodbyes, their own grins smug. Steve has no idea why. They probably know what Tony’s gifting him.
So with his mouth sealed shut, he meekly does what he’s told.
“So… Does it matter?”
Goddamn alcohol. Goddamn Howard.
“You fucking idiot. I—”
When they tell the team over brunch later, they’re met with wordless stares.
On one hand, Steve’s happy that Tony has someone else in his corner. But at the same time, why?
“Do you?”
Steve smiles but it’s uneasy. “What can I say? I’m your fucking self-sacrificing idiot.” His body goes taut. “I mean, unless you, uh…”
Natasha pins him with a look that’s both comforting and knowing. “I can’t tell you what to do. But I do think you should give it a go anyway. Tell him.”
Not that their friends are against their so-called relationship. In fact, they’re enthusiastic about the whole thing.
“I like your mom.”
He knows he’s being stupid. Being petty for no good reason.
Tony understands the feeling.
“I didn’t mean you, Shellhead.”
“Even after he dumped you?”
He steels himself. “I don’t know what you’re—”
“I’ll be fine, Tony,” Steve says, hoping he sounds assured. “Super soldier serum, remember?”
Reed shakes his head, flashing him a smile. “Not at all, Captain. I think I should steal my wife for a dance as well. Congratulations on the engagement once again.” He gives them a nod in turn and a knowing look at Tony as he takes his leave.
“She was,” Steve agrees, popping the handful of candy into his mouth. “She was really kind.”
Iron Man meets Captain America. It’s both the best and worst time of Tony’s life.
“Yeah?”
“Yeah. Said a relationship wouldn’t last very long if I keep stepping on their toes.”
“If you want to.”
“Tony, I was wondering if— Oh.”
The rest of the night is spent in Steve’s bedroom, ordering in pizza and huddling together in a pile as they talk about anything and everything.
Steve blinks, meeting Natasha’s cool gaze as the pain in his side ebbs away. She has an eyebrow raised knowingly.
Steve never replies to a single one of them.
That didn't make sense either. Only a handful of people knows of his heart or how it works. None of them are Captain America.
“You’re smirking at me. Something tells me you have a
Sif breaks into a grin of her own. “You are much too kind. Ah. Before I forget.” She brandishes the bouquet in her hands. “For you.”
Tony doesn’t get to break things off the next morning.
“Let him go,” Thor says, his eyebrows knitted together.
Tony feels himself wrap his fingers around Steve’s wrist, his heart pulsing against his ribcage and on the brink of ruining everything the both of them have carefully built together.
“I’m sorry,” she says, cradling her mug of tea like it’s her lifeline. “I should’ve told you.”
“Hey!” Clint exclaims. “I can totally keep a secret. I wouldn’t be one of SHIELD’s best, otherwise.”
Stupid,
“I know,” Carol says, her smile bright and blazing. She turns on her heel, slipping the pancake onto an empty plate. “But knowing you, you’ll just end up rambling about the time I saved your ass from MODOK—”
“Well, you can nag me about it later,” Steve says, detaching himself from the doorframe. “Meet me up on the rooftop.”
“Uh-huh, sure. I’m not the one who insisted I go through ten pairs of shoes.” Tony's eyes rake over Storm, drinking him in. “Wow. You look… Wow.”
“Why wouldn’t we go out?”
There’s a letter addressed to Steve, written in an all-too-familiar scrawl. It talks about how boring school is, how mean people are over there, how the food sucks.
Tony freezes.
“I said, I’m fine!”
Steve sighs, dropping his hands in his lap and hanging his head in resignation. “You know, it’s okay if you don’t feel the same for me. I get it. It’s just that you said something about confessions and I just thought—”
Steve looks exactly the same since Tony last saw him. His hair is the same shade of blond when it’s damp and his blue eyes are still undeniably piercing in the firelight. There’s even the same spread of freckles across his face, the same spread of freckles Tony used to trace once upon a time.
The next day, Steve leaves him a drawing between his locker, of Tony with head thrown back in laughter.
Steve’s cheeks redden. “Didn’t think I was going to be walking in on an impromptu piano lesson.”
Steve almost claps his hand over his mouth as once again, several pairs of eyes zero in on him, most of them in mirth.
He wonders if Sharon and Jan even went to the bathroom.
He reads it once, twice, thrice, over and over until the words are seared into his brain.
When Steve and Natasha resume their spar, Steve makes sure to jab harder and dodge faster, to try to win. He knows he’s getting reckless. Sloppy.
It’s also a little turn-on but he’ll never admit that. Yet.
Tony snorts. “I wasn’t crying to Inception. I’m pretty sure the rest of the gang said all that to make you cave in. Or jealous. Maybe jealous.” He frowns. “I just realized that you’re a crazy jealous bastard when you want to be.”
“What I am hearing from you is that you are afraid.”
Steve frowns. He hates it when Tony brushes off any concerns about himself. The fact that he'd rather compromise his safety over creepy pumpkin lights says a lot about Tony as a person.
Steve.
Tony groans. He’s never going on a mission with those two ever again. He’s also never going to blurt out his plans during battle ever again.
“Shit,” he mutters to himself, jabbing at the elevator buttons, whiling, hoping that it’ll come. It better come because goddamn it—
“Still fashionably late, I see?”
Tony’s heart pounds against his rib cage. “You weren’t supposed to hear that.”
. Be swallowed up by the honking and the shouting, the cold, by the nameless bodies and neon lights. Swept up in the moment like he’s the nobody he always wishes to be.
“C’mon, Tony.”
“Yeah. And they started dating a couple of years after. Try again.”
“You’re my friend. I can help.”
“As you should be.” She shakes her head. “Seriously though, there must be something that—”
?” Tony splutters. “Am I even— Am I even allowed—”
Besides the fact that Carol and Tony are stuck like glue together, (Steve couldn’t get Tony all to himself for the entire evening but whatever, he’s not upset about it, not at all) the rest of the party goes smoothly. And Steve doesn’t open Tony’s present with more enthusiasm than everyone else’s. Nor does he  pull Tony into an embrace, all because Tony remembered how much Steve was eyeing the Faber Castell Polychromos Color Pencils, let alone got him the full set for his birthday.
There are a lot of things Steve knows about Tony – that his favorite color's red. That his love for coffee’s unparalleled. That Tony has no interest in inheriting his father’s company but wouldn’t mind working in the R&D department.
Steve rears back as if he was slapped.
Steve manages a smile. “I’m fine.”
“Yeah?”
Steve grins, feeling anchored. “Just Clint and Thor arguing about Mario Kart.”
“Well,” he says, tasting salt and heartache. “I’m sorry I couldn’t make you happy. I’m sorry I wasn’t good enough for you.”
“You sure?”
He hears before he sees them, their voices loud enough for Steve’s ears to pick up.
“Not that kind of dip. The kissing kind of dip.”
Hammer doesn’t seem as happy about the turn of events though, his smile thinning. “Captain Rogers! What a pleasant surprise. I didn’t expect to see you here, considering you’re always absent.”
“What’re you doing here?” Tony asks, cringing at how rough he sounds to his ears.
It speaks volumes.
“Just the two of us is fine,” Steve interrupts hastily.
“Uh-huh, sure. Whatever you say. Liar.” Tony takes a chance to bury his fingers through Steve’s hair, amazed at the shiver that he elicits. “This isn’t like… You weren’t caught up in the moment, right? I mean, moonlight and pianos? Very romantic. We could just forget about it. If you want. I can totally—”
Jan’s wonderful. The only problem is that she can’t fill the gaping hole in his chest.
me, Rogers. I will not tolerate Reed Richards’ slander. He is my friend and you will give him the respect—”
He'll never figure out how the Fantastic Four could stand him.
Steve scowls, annoyed at both Tony and himself. But mostly at himself. This is what he gets for having a crush on his best friend, his best friend who he so happens to work with and live with and knows him in ways Steve doesn’t know himself.
“It’s been months, Steve.”
Tony silences him with a chaste kiss of his own.
Tony's mouth parts. Then closes. Then parts again.
Steve chuckles, shaking his head. “I don’t think I could pull that off.”
Tony’s blood sings at the possibility. Beckoning. Hoping. Wishing—
“Yeah?”
,” Clint continues, “this is totally gonna work. They’re both hot and they both know they’re hot. They’re both smart and they both know they’re smart. She loves chardonnay. He loves whiskey.” He spreads his hands. “Match made in heaven.”
“Nope. My music teacher in elementary school taught me. Ma used to work long hours at the hospital so I had to walk home alone. The bullies figured I was an easy target and I didn’t have Bucky at the time so I’d hang back for an hour or two until I was sure they weren’t around. My music teacher saw me loitering around once, invited me over to the music room, and gave me piano lessons to pass the time. Been a thing we did ever since.”
For the millionth time tonight, Tony’s world is turned upside-down.
Tony frowns, his eyes roving around Steve’s face before softening. “Alright, guys,” he says, clapping his hands. “Clear the room. Steve and I are gonna have a lovely chat alone.”
Tony shakes his head. “No, no, no, no. Nope. You’ve gone insane. Absolutely insane. Is it the lack of oxygen? Or maybe five years in—”
If only Tony’s not straight, maybe Steve would’ve had a chance. After all, Bobbi and him do have similarities. And if Tony would give Bobbi a shot, he could definitely give Steve one too.
Steve whips his head up, his eyes widening. “Of course not! Why would you think— Oh.”
“Share—”
“Tony?”
Whenever Tony does something, he gives himself to it. Playing an instrument is no different. It’s easy to lose himself in his music the same way he loses himself in his work, to let the symphonies consume him whole, to let his senses be overtaken. He only surfaces when a song ends but it’s always fleeting, his fingers itching to start another.
eyes, Tony wants. Needs.
“Figures,” Clint mutters.
“Fine, fine,” Tony grumbles, marching over to Hank and Bruce instead.
Plus, there’s the Ferris wheel. Tony once told Steve he loves Ferris wheels. To him, Ferris wheels are romantic. Steve wholeheartedly agrees with him. It's the perfect place to talk about buried feelings and to—
But then he remembers the way Tony’s features soften whenever he looks in Carol’s direction, how he easily laughed with her and let down his guard, how he leaned over to press a kiss—
Captain America always does.
“Not long,” Steve says after a pause. “When you started playing Elton John.”
There’s an odd intensity behind Steve’s blue,
Tony's eyebrows arch. “You’re not giving it a go?”
It’s midnight when they first meet.
Which again, sucks so, so much.
“So I thought I’d kiss you first.”
He shouldn't have kissed Steve while he was high on adrenaline and rage, shouldn’t have let Steve fuck him against the wall of his workshop, shouldn’t have offered Steve to do it again and again and again because Tony’s been in love with Steve since New York burned and he never could resist fire and pain.
“No problem. We should — go. Ms Romanoff needs to introduce me to the rest of them.”
“I’m not a prostitute.”
He watching him, intently. Tony watches back. He reaches across the table, lightly pats his hand.
You’re not really supposed to use that word these days, but Tony doesn’t mind. He knows Steve means it in a good way, mostly. He fucks his mouth up and down Steve’s length, taking him whole, feeling him twitch inside him throat. It’s sloppy. There’s drool on Tony’s chin.
“Come to bed,” Steve says again, and his hands wrap around his waist. It’s safe. It’s more safe than Tony has ever felt. He hates it. “I want to see your face when I wake up,” he whispers, kissing along Tony’s throat.
“I hate soup kitchens,” he admits. “I like helping, I don’t mind the work but – even I hate them, okay? So you practically saved me.”
It’s pretty boring, but relatively satisfying, sex. Tony cups his head, lets his fingers brush through the blond hair, intimate. “I know my place,” he says, easily, “your bed only.”
“Is he right?” Steve sounds sad.
“You use the gag. You get to tie my hands, but it lasts no longer than ten minutes.”
“Yes you are,” Mr Cain agrees, snapping his fingers. There’s someone lifting him under his arms, picking him up like a child. He smells familiar.
“I don’t know, kid. We’ll see. But hey, now that Natasha and St— “ He coughs, clears his throat. “Steve know who you are — you don’t need me. Not really.” He passes the device back to him, awkward. “There you go. Good as new.”
that special injection, huh?” Tony wheedles. “You think you could have got someone like me when you were 90lbs soaking wet?”
They’re all ruined in their own way.
“Well, if you’re around again…”
“Enough to fuck anything that moves? Jesus, Stark, he’s going to spread the word. They’ll all think you’re easy. Next thing you know, there’ll be rumours, people will look at you the wrong way – “
Tony nods. "I think it's broken."
Tony blinks. “What?”
“No,” Steve says, earnestly. “This works best. I mean – being alpha, and having an omega. It makes sense. It’s good, to have natural leaders, and – “
“Go and have fun, Steve. It’s Christmas.”
“Shh, Captain, settle.” Natasha says, pressing one hand to his shoulder. “Just relax. You’re safe, now, 100%. We’ll talk more when you wake up, okay?”
“Where is he?” He hears Rhodey ask. Sarah says something in reply, but her soft voice is nothing more than the rumble of cadence through the floor. Tony huffs a breath, kicks his legs against the wall of the closet, tries to breathe. He’s being stupid. This is stupid.
“We were always taught it was cavemen,” Steve says, frowning. “Like, the alpha would take the beta men to hunt, and the beta women would be left with the omega.”
Tony takes back his hand. “I was upset,” he hears himself say, distantly. “Pierce helped me, because I was – very upset. I wasn’t thinking clearly. I kissed him,” he remembers, but he can’t remember why. “I wanted to say thank you. But I wasn’t
“To him?!”
“Come with me,” Steve says instead, “I need to show you something.”
what’s in that file. He
Two more orderlies. They’re both very kind. Tony explains he doesn’t like the way the doctor’s talking, and that he’s tired. He asks if he can go home. The doctor’s say he can go back to his room, and they’ll bring him dinner. He asks if he can see Steve. They tell him no.
Bruce is silent. Eventually, he asks, “Was it an accident?”
“Do you want to talk?”
Which means, it will not be anything good.
“You seemed distracted,” the alpha says in a stern voice, like he’s giving Tony a lesson. “I asked, had your lawyers looked over the contract I proposed?”
But his wings flex once, beyond his control, knocking back into Steve, who just presses harder. “Oh,” Tony swallows his groan, curling his hands into fists. His shoulders tense, arching up like a bow.
he thinks, vacantly.
“Can I ask what your type is?”
he’d hissed, visceral. But Tony had lied.
He doesn’t. Tony sits there, hands between his knees, eyes shut and head tipped up, painted in an alpha’s spend. It’s cooled on his skin by the time Steve’s hand grips his throat, tugs him up to straddle his lap.
“I don’t want to interrupt and I’m really sorry, it looked like you guys were having an, an amazing moment, but if I don’t get to eat something I’m going to get so angry you have no idea.” Bruce rifles through a cereal box. “I’m really sorry.” He says, mouth full, flakes falling down his shirt. He swallows “I said I would see what’s taking so long. If anyone asks, Tony had a mild seizure and you needed my medical advice, okay?”
She’s sitting on their porch, her arms folded, swinging in the large hammock Tony installed during the height of summer. “Are you going to miss it?” She asks.
if he’d had time, but he figures people will get the message.
His nose is pressing into the soft spot behind Tony’s ear. “Sweet thing,” he murmurs, voice croaked and rasping, “you’re such a – such a sweet thing.”
“You haven’t lost everything,” Peter says, shuffling forward. “Strange said this was endgame. There’s hope. And – “
He strokes his neck again. “You’re going to stay here,” he says, “because you’re in no shape to leave.”
He’s only been out of the hospital a few days. The first week, maybe two, he was so out of it – could barely string a sentence together, and still too ill to be moved. He’d had Steve. Steve had stayed, for all of it, even though Tony will admit he wasn’t the most appreciative. He had been angry, the times he hadn’t been dribbling; the pain made him tetchy, and he was still drinking his meals. It hurt too much to stretch the skin on his jaw talking, and eating. So mostly he’d let Steve read to him, while he stared at the ceiling, fluorescent lights blurring until he slipped away.
“Why?” Tony asks, irked. “Is it my fantastic conversation? We’re not together, Steve. You don’t love me, Steve. You don’t owe me your pity, and I don’t want you breathing down my neck. So fuck off and go and have fun like I know you want to.”
Tony forces his head up, gasping. “Steve’s dead,” he says again, and he shakes his head, he looks so confused “Steve’s dead.”
“What happened?” Steve says gently.
"Shit," Steve blurts "shit his nose is bleeding."
“No.”
He switches off the nightlight. In the dark, Tony’s scars seem to burn, like brands. Sharp bracelets. He entertains this thought: a warm day, the smell of freshly mown grass. There’s a child, small and blond, running into Alpha’s arms, and he picks him up, swings him round until he’s screaming with laugher. Tony buries his nose into the crown of his baby’s head, fresh and soft, burbling happily on his lap. And he leans back against the tree trunk, so Alpha can kiss his cheek, and ask him about his day.
really want to know what u think about steve in this chapter. i feel like tony was abit of an ass -- i would have probably walked out, too.
In the short lived months where Steve tries to make a life in Washington, Tony would visit. Ostensibly on business, mostly to fuck. It worries Steve that his apartment was bugged; did Pierce hear that? Was Rumlow laughing at him? Steve hates the idea that any one of those bastards could hold that sort of information over Tony, or over him. That Tony’s moans could be put down to memory and stored, that his laugh broken down and memorised for further reference, the way he would sing to the records Steve played manipulated and changed into a poor mimic.
Tony doesn't remember that. "Ding dong." He says. Like a doorbell. Do doorbells ring? Maybe they chime? Phones ring, definitely, although his is always on silent. Were his ears ringing? Maybe someone was trying to call him? God, Natasha just doesn't make sense.
Tony hears himself make a huffing sound which might be a laugh. Nick smiles. “Ah-ha,” he says, leaning back in his chair, “so you
Now, Steve helps Tony into the jumper he brought with him. It’s fall, and there’s the first bite in the air. Tony’s fingers have little fine motor control, the nerves damaged from where they were severed, so Steve has to zip up the throat and then help push his arms into the plushy parka Natasha had bought for this purpose. He pushes Tony’s feet into new, soft sneakers, and wheels him to the entrance, signs some last papers. Tony has to sign something too, but his hands are shaking so much it’s near impossible, his once slick signature now just a shaky squiggle on a dotted line. He drops the pen but it’s enough for the attendant. They give Steve Tony’s prescriptions in a plastic box and tell him, to his face, with Tony sitting right next to him and yet somehow invisible to the nurses, that Tony can’t be allowed to have control over these because he will almost certainly try to overdose.
“No,” Thor says shortly.
Steve is still watching, him, eyes half-lidded, relaxed against the chair. “Thank you,” he says, between kisses, soft and delicate. “Thank you for protecting me, Captain.”
“Do you ever play with your hole?”
“Ooh, got some new tighty-whities?”
“You always have an answer.”
“Tony — do you remember what we said yesterday? Could we go over the thinking exercises?”
“Isn’t that getting a bit old?” Tony pauses, rests his hands on the rail. “How is everyone? Back there.”
“To Hong Kong? To this particular hotel? I don’t follow.” Tony flags down the waiter, fishes in his wallet for another $100.
Strange has cleaned up well-enough. He floats them chai in his study, goes to the effort of pouring it by hand, maybe to avoid looking at Steve directly. "So," he says, "congratulations are in order."
“They were feeding. The vampires were feeding. Off of, off of those people.”
“They must have been married a long time.”
“I never loved you,” Ty says, easily.
Tony wrenches back his wrist. “I’m a big boy, Nick. I can make my own decisions.”
Tony doesn’t have anything to say. He lies back down. He thinks, it had to happen eventually. It’s not like he could hide what he is forever.
“Shirt off,” Steve tries to compromise.
They diagnose him with shellshock. Well, shock. PTSD, give him a battery of sedatives and tell them it’ll pass in time. The palace is empty with no king to hold court. Wakanda, like the rest of the world, mourns. They’re not impervious. All that secrecy, all those years of protecting their own, and for all the good it did them in the end.
His left eye is swollen all shut. Rumlow had – picked up his head, slammed it into the floor once, twice. He’d beaten him real good. Tony feels more like pulp than anything else, but he thinks the drug is blocking the worst of the pain. He tries, again, to open his eyes; Steve is blurry mass in his right eye, a slit of colour in his left.
“Anything.”
“Like this? No.” And Steve smiles, because he’s made a joke – it’s funny, because Tony didn’t do it properly. It’s just a joke. Tony laughs, too, but maybe later than he should of, and too loudly, because Steve looks concerned. “I used to like it,” he continues, delicately holding Tony’s chin. “I used to like it when the bitches – I mean, the boys would wear it. But I don’t think masculine omegas really use it, anymore.”
“He sold up. Yeah. Why? Does it bother you?”
Tony freezes. "Worse?"
“There’s been some food delivered,” Sarah says casually. “Would you like it?”
Steve is standing, back to the helicopter, arms crossed. “You’re late,” he says, irritated.
Sure. Tony can do cards. He fishes out the pack from one of the kitchen drawers, throws it down onto the table.
Tony’s mouth is dry. “I think they’re trying to kill me,” he whispers.
For awhile, there's just the clink of cutlery and the rasp of knife over toast. Tony bites into the bread with a crunch, the flavour bursting over his tongue. "So," he says, wiping his fingers "last night."
He’s looking at him, straight in the eye, direct. His thumb is – pressing, slightly. Grinding the bones in his wrist. There’s a shiver running down Tony’s spine. “That depends,” he says, proud his voice is still even, “how would you show me?”
(See the end of the chapter for
and people loved it on him, and it hadn’t been daring anymore, it had become something he had to have to project this stupid fucking image he built for himself, and –
Steve nods. “Yeah,” he breathes, grinning. “’Course I am.”
folded, ready to be tucked away.
Tony and Steve have a miscommunication.
"Tony," Natasha says "Tony. Tony. Tony."
The cloth is laid to rest over his brow. Tony feels a trickle of water tickle his temple as it rolls, staining the pillow below.
“Sure. You get here often?” The man smiles, genuine. His hands are in his pockets, the top two buttons of his shirt are undone. What is he, some kind of – male model? He’s American, but Tony has never heard of him. There aren’t many Americans here tonight, and Tony was sure he knew most of them.
“Something like that,” he says, not really knowing how to respond.
“Yes,” Thor says “yes, that would do.”
Steve swallows. “But we’re stuck,” he says, quietly “we can’t get out from here.”
just like Tony said he would – “
But see, he gets it. Constantly playing the game, all that manipulation. Tony’s had to fight for so long to get what he has. Even then, people trip him up, knock him down, and worse: use him. Always, they fucking
He stubs his cigarette on the wall, flicks it into a puddle. “Richards,” he says, slowly. “What’s the matter? I didn’t say anything to offend you, did I?”
Tony’s already done the math. “Steve,” he says, reluctantly.
“I should have known,” he says, bluntly. “The second that sample landed on my desk. I should have figured what it would be used for. I should have – pushed harder. To figure it out, I mean. But then, SHIELD’s been SHIELD since I joined. Like bedrock. I couldn’t have figured…”
The weird, screaming moans don’t last too long. Doesn’t matter. Tony’s already gone.
Steve hadn’t known what Tony wanted him to do with this information. “But you look healthy,” he had protested, “you’re still young.”
Steve flushes. “And – you,” he finishes. “Okay, I see your point.”
"What do I want?"
He sighs, puts his scotch on the table and rolls onto his knees, kneeling up on the couch. “I’m not,” he says again. “When have I ever – “
With steady fingers, he unbuttons Steve’s pants, pulls down the zip. He hooks two thumbs beneath the waistband of Steve’s briefs and carefully drags them over his cock, tucking them beneath his balls. “Captain,” he says quietly, and then he leans forward and presses kisses, lips barely ghosting skin, against the line of Steve’s cock.
“I should have found one,” Steve grieves. “I could have, if I’d tried harder. If I’d been better.”
So this accidentally got plotty. Lots of it. Just a warning -- it's not going to be a sweet, happy story. Which isn't saying that there isn't an eventual happy ending, but both characters go to some DARK places and do some bad, bad things.
he presses, pushing up on his forearms. “Who you been fucking?”
Steve has to lever Tony into a wheelchair and settle him down, wrapped in a fluffy robe Clint had probably picked up from the quinjet supplies. "Where are we going?" He asks.
And thank you!! Again!! For!! Waiting!!
Strange leans forward. "You want to know, why it had to be him. You want to know, how do you avoid it."
They hadn’t spoken. In fact, Tony hadn’t said anything to any of them, short of fixing a smile on his face and reading his acceptance speech. After, he’d been cordial at the reception back at HQ. He shook their hands, made small talk about sports, about the markets, about the Middle East. He had posed publicly for a photograph with Bucky, his arm wrapped around Barnes’ shoulder, and had left as soon as was socially acceptable.
“I asked for it,” he agrees.
He hates him for being so good. Understanding, and pure. He genuinely wants the best for me, Tony thinks. He wants me to be comfortable. He doesn’t want to
“You. That so hard to believe?”
“Sustainable development.”
Steve doesn’t know. His mind has come up dry, and empty. It’s still raining. The world is still watching.
Pierce shakes him, impatient. “I never left, last night. Pierce isn’t – he isn’t – he isn’t our friend – “
If he loved you, the first voice spits, he would have listened to you. He would have compromised with you. He never would have left us in Siberia to go with Barnes, he never would have set the dogs on your trail and left you to rot –
“Uh, Rhodey hold on. Just give me a sec, I’m handing you to Sarah.” She nearly snatches it from him, wrenching it desperately from his grip.
“You’re – jiggling, did you know that? And sucking your thumb.”
he thinks, or, he knows.
“He couldn’t have gone far,” she snaps. “Bring him back.”
“I’ll see what I can do about the dog, Tony,” Pepper says gently.
His lungs ache when he breathes, but it's good. Deep, and sturdy, it means he's alive. Matched with the heavy bass that Tony feels beating through his chest, his neck, down to the tips of his fingers and toes, it feels steady. Strong. The pillow beneath his cheek is a rough tether to the real world, and Steve's hand in his hair makes him float. Anchored, secure, and the aches begin to ease, bone deep and long suffering.
“You know, of course, the things that were put inside him, how hard, etcetera. Your son,” Steve muses, “God, just nineteen, huh? His whole future ahead of him.”
“You’re fine, Tony. There’s nothing you need to change, nothing you could do,” Steve soothes. He’s stroking Tony’s head, and Tony is luxuriating in it, leaning into his chest.
“Don’t cry,” Steve blurts, and he kneels down, rubs at Tony’s knees, tries to prise his hands from his face yet still avoid the scars. “Shit please, Tony, don’t cry. Don’t. I can’t make Bucky leave but – but we can. I swear, as soon as you’ve put on some weight, as soon as you feel better, we’ll go. We can go anywhere you want, just you and me, alone. Just us, Tony, sweetheart, it’ll just be us.”
Gus chuckles, props himself up where he begins to slide. “Captain, I have little time for your animosity. Surely, maybe, we can put aside out differences in aim of a common goal?”
“He is… expendable,” Pierce says, regrettably. “I wish he wasn’t, but he is. So you should sit yourself back down. Or else, the soldier will shoot him, and my men will shoot you. And we don’t want that, do we? No unnecessary blood-shed, when this could all be resolved so peacefully.”
Steve sighs. “That I’m jealous. Why would my –
With this new medication, Tony’s moods oscillate wildly. God fucking forgive him, but even Steve’s fuse begins to grow short. One moment Tony is laughing, the next he’s sobbing, then ten minutes later he’s ripping out the pages from Steve’s books and using them to clog all the sinks he can find.
"Get him to a hospital." Natasha says, suddenly. "Get him up, c'mon, let's go."
He shimmers, blinks out of time, out of space, into nothingness. “No,” Steve rasps “wait, no. Come back! Where — “
He slides his arm around Steve’s, curves his body there like it was built for it. “Interesting guy,” he murmurs, looking over his shoulder, awkwardly waving. Killian is still watching them
“I’ll look,” Bruce says quietly, kneeling in the – leaves, and dirt. And dust. “Hey, Tony. How you doing?”
“Calm down,” Steve manages, but he sounds panicked himself. “Look, we’re leaving. See? I’m leaving. I’m driving away, here. We’ll come back another day, it’s fine, it’s fine Tony, it’s okay.”
“I know that you’re a genius. I know you used to be happy. I know – “ what, Steve, what, that he still has it in him? Why don’t you think before you fucking speak, he tried to kill himself, he’s not going to get better overnight just because you get down on one knee and tell him you love him.
“There were thirteen on Tony, when I last counted,” Steve tells him. “I know for a fact it was more originally, but I can’t prove it, so you’re going to get lucky.” The rain is making it hard to keep his cigarette alight. “By the way – he doesn’t have scars, anymore. So don’t go thinking you left a mark. You didn’t.”
After Tony’s first few contracts, he’d gone through his teenage rebellion. He’d started wearing baggy sweaters with pants that were too tight and hair that was greasy and a beard unshaved. His mother had despaired. He’d stuck pins for punk rock bands on his shirt and pasted their posters on his wall, alongside a scandalous picture of a beta pin-up girl, who he wasn’t supposed to like and – quite frankly –
“Cheat,” he snorts against his skin, nipping at his earlobe. “I don’t even want to punish you for it. Just want to hear you feel good.”
Slowly, Steve curls his hand in the back of Tony's hair. He pulls back his head, tugs him off his cock, face flushed and dribble making it's way past his swollen lips down his chin. A string of pre-cum slips and joins the mess making it's way down his neck, and Steve thumbs at his lower lip, feels the wetness. "I want to fuck your mouth." He says, mildly.
Damn.
“Are you hungry?”
“You’re fond of him.”
“Sure. Free country.”
“I can’t. I can’t do that.”
“Excuse me.” Tony blurts, stumbling to his feet. “I have – kitchen.”
Steve grasps him, squeezes. He sighs slightly, leaning back into the chair. “I think – to at least start repaying me,” he clarifies, “you should open those pretty lips.”
“You’re not in DC.”
He gasps. “Yes, I am,” he agrees, licking his lower lip, “I am, very, very bad Steve. I’ve been very bad, without you. I’ve done lots of b-bad – “
Tony’s head is spinning. He doesn’t want Pierce to leave him. He wants to bury his head into his neck.
would really like to know what people can tell about tony's history -- like, what was the picture, what do u think happened, etc. it helps me know if i'm showing enough without telling, if that makes sense
Good. Relaxed. The way you do when you know you’re safe, and protected, guard let down. The way he felt when he was a kid, and sick, and safe in his dad’s arms. But he has enough wherewithal to remember, this is a drug, and he’s in a meeting. And he needs to stay sharp.
The man waves a hand. “Oh, I don’t know about that,” he says, leaning heavily against the bar, hands clasped. “I mean – I literally didn’t know. Apologies. I’m not a part of that world.”
“Yeah. It said, when you were a kid, you got contracted out to the old head of Cain & Partners.”
He doesn’t even know what. But it sounds familiar. Dare he think –
Tony doesn’t honestly know. He’s been drinking for three days straight, and the days and nights have blurred. He shrugs.
“Believe me,” he’s saying, looking genuinely pained, “I don’t want to have this conversation any more than you do.”
“Good. Are you sleepy, Tony?”
“I’m not going to do anything stupid,” Steve says, calmly. “Are you okay, Tony? Are you injured.”
also, *spoiler* there's some suicidal ideation on Natasha's part but it's very brief.
But something had changed, in the year that Steve had been away. Tony’s eyes were often empty when open. When he laughed, it was delayed. When he smiled, it never reached his eyes. At night, he would kiss Steve on the cheek, roll onto his side, and nothing more. The first time they made love post-civil war, Tony barely made a sound, sighed when he came, and cleaned himself up with clinical efficiency.
“Mr Cain. You don’t need to tell me my own history,” Tony says shortly. He carefully – carefully – schools his fingers not to twitch against the armrest. Any tell is an indication of submission, it always is with men like Fury.
“How’s that possible? You were fucking, you ‘shared a bed’, how could have not been there all the time?”
Tony taps the flat face of the device twice and it lights up with the Stark Industries logo. “Needs an update, but sure. Wasn’t he in prison or something?”
“You can – uh,” he clears his throat, looks away. How can someone so cold sometimes be so damn sweet? “You can call me Captain.”
He kisses him, quick, unflinching. If Pierce is startled, he only shows it by curling his hands in the front of Tony’s shirt. Tony, understand, is so good at this; they
“You’re going to tell him,” Pierce says, sternly. “You’re going to see him. Tomorrow.”
and he wanted it then. I won’t have any of this – this liberation bullshit – “
Your son. Your flesh and blood, your
“I just want to see you.”
This time, Steve calls again. Tony is fascinated with the persistence, and a little frightened – he doesn’t know what he’ll want on the other end of the line. Apologies, explanations. Steve had been so scared in that room, and he had done awful things.
They both know there’ll be a next time.
Tony relaxes. “I haven’t gone out of my way,” he says, honestly. “Only when I needed to.”
When he’s not working, sleeping, or eating, Rogers seems to spend his time at a day club, where he talks to veterans. He helps out, apparently. Talks about the good old days. He’s made some friends there; centennial, close-to-death, friends.
Richards balks, gurgles with fear, trying to push him away. “You can’t – this is barbaric, this is inhumane – “
“No time, I guess.”
; perfectly selfless.
Natasha is the last one Tony sees.
He screams, hands reaching to slap Peter away, but only hitting air. “
“I’m sure I’ll find some other way to shut you up,” Steve says, nipping at his nose.
He’s bleeding again. Drip. Drip. From his nose. Steve gently tips back his head with his broad, strong hand. Smears it away with some water. Tony shuts his eyes.
You don’t need to protect me, that’s – absurd, Tony.”
So Tony nods at him, enquiring.
He enters anyway. “I made breakfast.”
“But what about – your clients, your job. Your father! You said he was sick.”
He’s brushing his forearm over his face, again and again, reflexive. Like he’s trying to push out bad scent, pollen. “Tony?” He groans, digging his hands into his eyes, “
Tony would be silent, but he’d stroke Steve’s hair anyway. Sometimes, if Steve was really bad, he’d tell him that, if he could, he would reach back in time and give Steve everything he wanted and more, and Steve would sleep with that fantasy in his head, a world where he has Tony and Bucky and Peggy and all his friends.
It should be reserved for Steve. Which means, Steve doesn’t plan on sitting down.
“ – man-sized, with the little sticky tabs and everything – “
No. No good dwelling on that. Too many other people have, too many other have brought Tony down and made him act without any thought to his well-being. Not Steve. Tony tells Steve he wants to go down, Steve does everything he can to bliss him out. Tony says he wants to try a spider gag, Steve buys him a spider gag. He does this for him. He does it for Tony.
“Don’t touch me!” And Tony spins. He pants, slams his fists against the wall, again and again, and then cracks the door when he leaves. And Steve slumps in his chair, with Sinatra still playing in the background and his unopened presents resting on the couch.
“I mean – I could do without the crowd. You’re such an exhibitionist.”
Tony tries, because… he has to listen, for a reason. Pierce is blurry, more colour than man. Everything is blurry, shapes and streaks, not real.
“You know how sometimes you hear of just — medical miracles?”
and this is what we’re left with.”
Tony does, letting it rest on the pillow next to his head. “Okay,” he says, “done.”
“C’mere,” Tony says, vaguely.
The gag fits neatly between his gums and his cheeks. It hooks around the skin there, pulls his mouth open wide. He realises, he doesn’t know what to do with his tongue. Steve manhandles him, sits on the couch and makes him straddle his waist. “Is that comfortable?” He asks, strangely considerate.
“I imagine it’s been designed to – get people like you to let your guard down,” Fury says, pointedly.
Tony hadn’t thought of it that way. “You’re right,” he says.
“I think Ross would just kill him, actually,” Steve says absently.
“Do you know how to dance, soldier?” One of them asks. “I’m sure you do, somewhere. I’m sure you used to be quite the bitch-magnet, huh?”
“I’m sorry.”
Natasha tells him that, the night Tony died, they find him scrambling around, trying to patch him back together. “You were holding a foot and sobbing,” she tells him.
Steve seethes, slightly. “You’re not taking it seriously. Someone could – hurt you, if you just walk around, flaunting your weaknesses.”
“He was kind to me,” Tony says quietly. “That’s all. He was just being kind.”
“Smoking,” Tony says, and the realises he’s not holding a cigarette. “Just getting some air,” he corrects.
“Let’s drink,” Steve says suddenly. “We should drink.”
“I’m fine.”
None of the aptly sum up what exactly Tony feels.
with him, I didn’t even plan on sleeping with him, I barely knew… Steve, I was – I – “
“I might not ask nicely, in the future.”
“I know when Christmas is.”
They all bring him little gifts. Some fresh fruit, or bread, or cake. Wanda comes with a stack of books she said Steve found in his bedroom, and Tony is grateful, at least.
Fury folds his hands. “You know what I want,” he says, placidly.
Steve hires a woman. He doubts there will be any other incidents like the one before, but there’s a part of his brain that just tells him hiring another man will be the wrong thing to do. She’s Irish, she’s lived in the USA for ten years, and she always greets Tony with a “and how are we doing today, Mr Stark?”
Tony’s eyes are closed. He grunts.
“I said, do you agree?” Pierce presses. His face is blurry. His lips are moving, and sound follows after. Disconnect.
“It’s 20 degrees out. It’s snowing.”
Tony winces as Pierce twists his fingers.  “Steve,” he says, croaky.
“Flying, if I’m honest. It felt like I was flying, one last time.” He turns, as if speaking to someone Steve can’t see. “Not much longer.”
Instead of returning to their cabin they stay out that night, on the lake. Tony and Steve, side by side, staring up at the stars.
“And what would you have done?” She demands.
“It’s not because of you.”
alpha – you made the right call. You protect the omegas and children first, Steve.”
“Okay,” Pierce says, leaning back, “I hear you. I’ll take you at your word, From Stark. But keep it in mind. I’d like to see an omega in the senate by the end of my life.”
It had been. Far more intimate.
I've been considering a sequel to this since I have plot bunnies that are just, ugh, not leaving my head but that I can't fit in here without an overkill. If you have any opinions, please leave them below!
“Why, the public, of course.” Pierce says it, and he sounds like he means it, but his lips are twitching upwards. “I hope that doesn’t upset you.”
“Leaving so soon?”
“Where did you get the money from?”
“He might as well have,” Peter sneers. Steve doesn’t know him well, but he thinks it’s an ugly look on the boy’s face – too young to have seen this much, too young to own this much hate. Or – no. Not hate; camouflaged pain.
uh yikes
Steve won’t let himself waste away. Having witnessed Tony’s decline, he knows he can’t just spend the rest of his life in bed. It would be hypocritical. There are things he needs to do, people who deserve his help. But currently he’s stuck between feeling like the scummiest individual to have ever walked the planet, coupled by the fact that without Tony life feels very much empty, purposeless, and without meaning.
He flinches when Pierce touches him. “Easy,” he’s saying, “just roll over. That’s it, easy, easy. Head on pillow, just like that. Breathe in deeply, Tony. Can you do that for me? Just take a good deep breath, it’ll calm you down. I’m telling you to do it, so you should.”
“Why did you wear these clothes?” He asks, picking at the fishnet on Tony’s chest.
“I didn’t think I was given much of a choice,” he replies, and he wants it to sound like a jab but for some reason his words are half-mumbled, and it feels more petulant than anything else.
Fury’s smile is just a touch triumphant. “You can control him.”
“That’s really good, Tony,” and his voice is so warm, “I am very, very glad to hear that, you understand? It means a lot to me.”
“Okay,” Tony is starting to pull on pants one-handed. “He’ll metabolise it,” he says, fairly confident.
“No,” Steve says, sounding like he’s humoured. “You didn’t mention it. But I figured.”
He twists, sinks down into a puddle. Breathes in and out, even though it feels like his heart wants to beat out of his chest.
This appears to peak Tony’s interest, if only mildly. “What are we doing here?” He asks, voice throaty with disuse.
He shakes his head.
“Well, uh,” Tony sighs, pushing his head back into the pillow, dragging the tips of his fingers down his throat, “I, uh,
Rhodey. He’s still alive, flesh and blood and family. Happy is somewhere, in New York, building a shrine for Pepper’s loss out of the things she left behind. He has this team, still, somehow. The first ones, the last ones.
“These things take delicacy, Secretary. It’s a matter of – “
“Excuse me?”
Tony hides his smile, looks down at his drink. “All three, I think, maybe.”
(On a side note, you may wonder how I’ve felt about this all these years. The truth is, Tony, I stick to my religion, at it’s basis although I can no longer say I believe in a God. And I know you ignored most of my conversion attempts, but the Catholic church, at it’s core, believes in peace. I can tell you honestly that I abhor war, but appreciate what your father was trying to do)
So he’s not alone. He had been so scared that he was alone. He doesn’t know why – it never scared him before. He tells the person,
Tony breaks away first. He stares intently at his tablet. “You seen this?” He asks, clearing his throat, “some seals sat on a woman’s tent.”
"Still green."
“Okay.”
“How long has it been going on?”
Tony grunts. It feels strange having someone else shave him, and even now he rankles at the idea of having someone else do it for him.
“I often am.” A beat. “Well, good-bye then, Tony.”
“How urgent?”
“Tony,” Pierce says gently, “I think you’re beyond having to worry about that.”
"No," Steve says "not like last time. That was stupid of me."
She unclips her earring, rests it on the counter. She’s still wearing her evening gown, but has swapped the heels for soft moleskin slippers.
Tony thinks he’s crying again. Eventually, he falls back into sleep. His cries become whimpers, which turn into breaths. Achingly, gently, Tony rolls him over, sets him back on his side of the bed. He drops his own head back down on the pillow.
“Then what’s the big deal? Want a light?”
(What if they’re more?)
“It says, property of HYDRA. The soldier has one, too. Because that’s what they are. Do you like my pets, Steve?”
“This is my advice,” Tony says, probably too harshly. “Use T’challa. I can’t help you. I don’t have the mental capacity or will. I can’t — face that world anymore, understand, kid? Do you get it?”
You don’t understand, you weren’t there, he said – there was one way. And he knew, he knew, he knew! He didn’t tell him, didn’t – didn’t – “
Steve’s eyes flick to his, and away again. “I like it when you talk,” he says quietly, fiddling with something in the kit. “Talk to me about something.”
Tony wets his lip. “Do you?”
"You did. You have a concussion."
“You know about the helicarriers,” Pierce continues, “you can thank him for those.”
Steve stops, and turns. “Excuse me?”
He doesn’t reply. She notes something on a clipboard, offers to give him a sedative. He refuses. She runs through the symptoms of shock, as if Steve didn’t already know.
“So he went ahead and started to talking to people. We got a written confession out of Wanda, alongside another proclamation of innocence for
“He is,” Pierce agrees. He blows smoke. Tony’s nose twitches; maybe it’s the study, or the cigarettes, or the slight hint of scotch on Pierce’s breath that sets him on edge. “What do you think of him, From Stark?”
“Yeah. Sure. I loved you, very much.”
“This it?” Tony pants, pulling up his head, meeting Steve head on. “C’mon, buttercup, you can do better than that.”
He fucks Tony’s mouth until he comes, releasing Tony enough that he can pull off. Holding himself in hand, he finishes on his face, his open mouth, his tongue. He’s moaning, unashamed, his knot thick in his fingers, gripping himself to the point of pain to mimic the feel of an omega’s hot, tight hole.
Rogers.”
Tony screams into the palm covering his mouth. He’s crying with the sheer pain of it, unending crescendos, over and over. The ever-sensitive skin behind Tony’s ear is subject to the hot, burning pad of Killian’s finger, held there, singing and scalding the skin from the muscle, frying him alive. He screams so hard he fears his voice will break, his lungs explode, his heart burst out of his chest. He thinks – he thinks the worst is over, when Killian takes his hand off his mouth, takes his burning nails away from his sensitive, secret spots.
“You’re welcome.”
Tony bows his head. “I’m sorry,” he says, not begrudging. “You’re right. At least is was painless. He wouldn’t have known.”
She sits him down in a living room and brings him coffee. It’s still cold outside, but someone has been by and already warmed the house for them. Tony doesn’t question how it came fully furnished with Tony’s favourite appliances, but later he will think Steve had something to do with it.
“I hit you,” Steve murmurs, not looking up.
Or he can can do something. He can move, act, be.
Steve slowly lowers his head back against the rest, closes his eyes. Tries to think through the fog round his brain.
They’re in front of Killian’s door. He’s fumbling for his key. “Actually,” Tony says, shaking his head, “God. I’m sorry. I just have – the worst headache.”
He’s got to get out. He’s got to get safe.
He straightens the napkin. He brushes his knuckles over Tony’s cheek.
“It’s been a long few days, actually,” Ross close-enough sneers at him, downing his drink. “We lost men.”
Steve sighs. "I don't know," he murmurs "sometimes I think it's getting worse."
"Where's'a bump?"
“Uh. No. I mean – it’s just an expression, you know? That’s kinda what you’re dealing with, with me, Steve.” He leans forward, kisses his nose. “I’m old blood. Going back far enough, my ancestors would have warmed the beds of kings.”
“You will.”
He isn’t crying. He sees colour, for the first time in weeks. “No, but see – “ Steve smiles, “he kept them. I thought he’d had them burnt, he told me he’d…”
“Sarah helps,” Tony admits. “She gets me focused on the little things. You know, gardening. Walking. Cooking. Is that crazy? I’m really fucked up, Jim. I — I go to sleep at ten every night and get up early so I can walk my dog and make breakfast. Am I mad?”
“Tell me to stop,” Steve tells him again.
Bratty. Tony’s heard that before, from many lover’s lips. They all think they can fuck with his hindbrain – that they’ll be the one to crack him like a nut, tame the untameable, have him eating out of their hand like a pretty pony. “If you say so,” he grits out, because Steve’s nails are digging into the sensitive skin behind his neck, and he’s just laid another bruising blow against the soft spot where ass meets thigh.
Now, he’s shaving his beard. He’d grown it because it had been daringly nouveau, striking, conformingly anti-conformist back in the 90s when liberation was supposedly at its peak. All the omegas had been growing beards. It was like burning your bra. Except then, it became expected, and Tony had started to trim it every day, perfectly, and had bought all the serums and creams to keep it neat, and had dyed it religiously, and it had become
Tony raises his brows. “Just how kinky are you, Captain?”
He’s never heard Steve sing.
Steve’s eyes look sad. “You really can’t see why I’m upset, huh?”
That hurts, more than Steve cares to admit. “But he always liked you,” he pushes. “More than any of us, he liked you best.”
“Mostly. We’re not…” a long pauses. “You know, it’s mostly a – physical thing.”
“I get that,” Steve says, understanding, voice soft. “If you wanted… I can just make you something here. We don’t need anyone else, if you don’t want that.”
“I know I haven’t been great,” Gus says, mouth slack, breathing laboured “but, but if I die c’n I ask you a favour?”
Anyway: the guests who get seats. T’challa, and an entourage, sitting at the front. Maria Hill, who is pretending not to cry, and Sharon, who rests her head on her shoulder, holds her hand, rubs her knee. General Ross (sorry, Mr Secretary of State), President Ellis, a few ambassadors, UN representatives. The entire board of Stark Industries, Tony’s acquaintances, what few, extended relatives he actually has (a cousin once removed, a great-aunt), and, shockingly, friends. Friends of Tony’s that Steve has never met, but men and women who are now crying, dabbing their eyes. People he grew up with, people he worked with, people that are part of a life Steve never really knew about. The life of a real person.
“What kind of question is that?!”
“It’s okay. You’re not yourself.”
Tony looks sad. “Yeah,” he says “I know.”
“Trust me,” Tony asks. He’s looking at him, now. He means it. “Because – what’s happened, I don’t think – if you had told me ten years ago – “
“Are you serious?”
"Please."
He scents the air, visibly. “You’re
Tony sighs. He rests his head on his hands, debates whether he should tell the guy to just stop or whether it’s worse to spare his feelings. “Uh,” he frowns, “oh, yeah. It feels good, sweetie.”
The sharp movement sends him reeling, the whole world spinning. It's like, it's like vertigo, or when you hand upside down and get up too fast. He's twirling around and it's making him sick.
He always loved Tony more than Tony loved him.
Steve turns to Tony. “You sure?” He asks, almost cautiously hopeful. “We can’t bring him back if we don’t like him.” And by that, he clearly means, if you don’t take care of him and leave him to starve while you lie in bed.
The men behind the glass are panicking. He realises it’s Rumlow who dragged him clear. “Get him
“You didn’t know. So it’s alright. Now you do. I guess — I understand why Steve is worried. He invested a lot in me, you know, trying to fix me. There were days I wouldn’t leave my bed at all, wouldn’t eat or drink, would just lie there. He and Natasha forced me to live. I can’t say that was easy for anyone.”
He’s later than usual. Their meetings don’t normally run this long. In the meantime, Tony has drunk. Has drunk?
“I don’t know. I don’t know if we’re in love. I think we love each other.”
Steve’s hand on his waist. “Tony,” he says, “I wondered what was taking so long.”
“Why is there a gun in your coat pocket?”
"The bond. Does it feel different to you?"
"It would help if you'd just accept."
“Jesus,” Fury mutters, “Secretary – are you feeling okay?”
him, get
Pierce eases his head back down onto his shoulder. “You are,” he says, succinctly. “You’re not like other omegas, are you Tony?”
Still. He figures he owes Pierce a favour, what with his poor show after the helicarrier debacle. He’s wearing a new pair of panties beneath his neatly-pressed pants, a rose-pink he thinks Steve will appreciate when he takes them off tonight. Preferably, with his teeth.
“I just want to swim,” Tony says, scrunching his bare toes in the leaves. “I won’t be long.”
Tony might think.
“Shouldn’t have to.” He grunts slightly, softening inside him.
And he is. It’s his first time outside of the state of New York in three years, but he’s — okay. It comes back to him, like riding a bike. He wonders what was ever so hard about this to begin with — it’s difficult to remember when he felt so hopeless he tried to end his life. If he had, he wouldn’t know what it felt like to fall asleep in the sun on the porch, or watch Peter go to college, or see the world turn, advancements made, people change. He tries to remember what he found so
“Yes.”
“Trust me,” Killian murmurs, “this will be unlike anything you’ve seen before.”
“Oh, Christ,” he hears Rumlow mutter. Crumpled picture, in his hand, and – even
“And you.”
there are photos? People are going to know. It’s just not going to work. I wash my hands of it all, Stark. You’re more trouble than your worth.
Okay, so I'm not entirely sure how long this is going to be. I've been writing it as I go along so I've never really had a definitive plan. I have a rough sketch of how the rescue mission is going to but I just don't know how many chapters it will take.
The pheromones Steve’s pouring out make him more receptive, give rise to the opposite scents and hormones inside Tony’s body. When he comes, it’s brief, and smooth, almost superficial, like he’s in heat. “Thanks,” he hears himself sighing, leaning forward, grinding himself against Steve’s face through the aftershocks.
Got it.
“Why not?”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Are we going up?"
Nick doesn’t move to deal them.
WARNING: Graphic torture in this chapter. I've contained it to one so not to let it drag on, and the comfort will be up very soon!
Tony clears his throat. "Gus." He says "You were an ass. But you tried your best. And... maybe there was some good inside you, somewhere." He thinks "And I'm sorry Lana couldn't be here. You should know that at least someone loved you, at the end."
Does Tony say,
The lipstick is smeared. He’d tried to paint it, neat, onto his lips; it was wobbly, and then the repetition of it, the drag of thick wax across his skin felt good, and he got… distracted. He knows how to do it the way they like it, they taught him. They had wanted him in pretty make-up and silk panties and lace suspenders. He can do everything that he needs to do.
I wouldn’t sound so sure, Steve says.
“You’re the one holding me up. Begging for attention.” Steve laughs. “Hell, I think you’re the one who’s jealous.”
Tony looks up. “Sure about what?”
They nod, bow their heads.
It’s a life or death situation, and Tony is genuinely terrified, but his overriding thought is what a desperate piece of shit this guy is. “I don’t tend to want to bone guys who stalk me,” he starts, and recoils back when Killian rests his palm a hair’s breadth from his face. He shuts his eyes, winces, breath coming in pants; this guy could easily scar him for life, just like that. And Tony is powerless.
Sarah bites her lip. “Canada,” she says. “I’m moving to Canada. I want to get this photography business off the ground, and my brother says he’s willing to lend me some cash.”
like fifty year of hard-won omega liberation is nothing but a trick, an allowance, or maybe some kind of elite scheme to stop the breeding of healthy children.
“I want him on SHIELD payroll. He’ll be given top clearance, he won’t even need to attend basic. He’ll be running an elite team, working regular, keeping busy, helping people. It’s what he needs. It’s what we need.”
Like they were
“You were here?”
“Are you trying to suggest that Pierce would seriously risk my neck over this?”
Tony realises he’s been rubbing at his throat, where the burnt, mottled skin used to be. “I don’t know what kind of relationship you think we have. We haven’t – I’ve barely seen him in months.”
“And he was my friend,” Steve finishes. “The bonds of brotherhood, based in blood, that no force could…” he trails off. They’re watching him, and his words have stalled.
Richard’s face is pale, drawn, tight. “That wasn’t me,” he whispers.
“Oh yeah?” Tony’s heard this routine before. He wonders what Pierce wants from him.
“I did love you. I do, still, love you so fucking much, Tony. How could I sit here if I didn’t?”
Tony’s head falls forward, his brow against Steve’s, shivery, sweating, panting. “I don’t sleep well,” he blurts, “I don’t sleep well these days. That’s why I’ve been waiting up.”
“You were there, Stark. You saw what happened,” a frown creases Diana’s scarred face “it wasn’t quite in the plan. I suppose Gus couldn’t bear to let it go my way one last time.” She sighs, swipes imaginary lint from her new suit. “Ah, well,” she says “not much that can be done now.”
he doesn’t
“You shouldn’t touch me if you don’t want me to touch you back.”
“Not secrets,” Steve relents. “It’s – when I saw them huddled there, I didn’t see them. I saw you.”
“I don’t.”
"Tony?" Steve says "What's okay?"
“It looks awful,” Steve croaks, “Jesus, Tony.”
“Oh yeah?”
“No! You fucking bastards, you bastards you take and you take, everyone takes from me — “
He yawns, and Steve wordlessly hands him the coffee. He drinks without even asking what it is, holds it between two hands like a kid with a sippy cup. He had his hair smoothed back for the gala; now it’s all loose and skew-if on his head.
Natasha stares. "No, Tony, no. Do you understand that you are concussed?"
A beat. “You shouldn’t tempt me,” he says, “I have work tomorrow.”
Tony pulls himself forward, resting his head on Steve’s shoulder, wrapping his arms around Steve’s. He can feel him go clammy, unused to touch, not quite sure how to reciprocate. “You killed my ex-boyfriend,” he reminds, gently.
The human looks like he’s sucking a rock. “Fine,” he says, “good point. But if I’m crucial, then it’s up to me what happens next. Strange thinks I’m important. It should be my word – “
Steve looks at him, abruptly. “Walk with me,” he says.
“Back in my day, this wouldn’t have even been an issue,” Steve sighs, trailing his finger around the bottom of the arc reactor, tapping his nail against the metal housing. “You would have been second in command, there would be no question of – not sleeping together. We just would. Hard mission, take it out in each other’s bodies,” he mumbles.
per usual, i love comments, whatever u can! a few ppl asked abt the omega story from the snippets and i should have a chapter out soon, but i've rewritten it, like, completely,
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony's face scrunches. "Clint," he says "Steve! I am, I am the pilot."
A long silence. Then: “That’s, uh,” Steve says.
“I don’t think he tells you everything,” Pierce repeats, loosening his tie while Tony’s forgotten how to speak. “You’d be surprised what alpha keep to themselves.”
"I hope you're okay." She says again "You won't remember this, will you? Fine. But anyway. I hope you're not too scrambled."
Tony eyes it suspiciously. “What is it?” He asks, picking it out of the packaging, sniffing at the lid. “I don’t need to eat it, do I?”
“That she got someone to pull strings? Probably T’challa. And I know Steve’s behind it, somewhere. He’s so fucking guilty.”
He tips his head to the side, exhales smoke, eyes soft. He checks his watch. “It won’t be hard,” he says again, reassuringly. “After a few months, after a year – you won’t even think about what you’ve lost. You’re so responsive. You’ll always do what makes your alpha happy.”
They reach the base in the early hours of the morning. It’s dark, but Steve can maybe just about imagine a pink lining across the bottom of the sky. Tony doesn’t let him push him and instead walks, following just behind Steve, into the main entryway, which is blessedly empty. “You’ll have your own room,” Steve promises “your own bed, soon. I swear. But – just for the first few days, we need to keep an eye on you. You can take my bed, I’ll sleep on the couch, it’s fine. You won’t even notice I’m there.”
Steve stops, lets the sponge float in the water. He tips up Tony chin, gently, two fingers: “You back with me?” He asks, softly.
Tony blinks at him. Yeah, he’s done. He tries to shuffle out the way; the shower curtain is covering the floor and there are tufts of hair glued to the linoleum with water. He’s so fucking embarrassed.
“I’m telling you to move back.” And then: “I don’t know why you had to leave like that,” Tony blurts. “We were good, and I liked you. And I know I messed up, what I did with Killian, and I paid for it, but – I’ve been thinking, and I want to change for you. Be better for you, if that’s what it takes.”
Steve kisses his hair, fondly. “They were very welcoming, sweetheart,” he says, sighing.
And then Pierce puts his head in the pillow, he breathes, and he forgets what.
Pierce clears his throat, lowers his voice. Leans closer. “The incident with Stone,” he murmurs.
Peter blows air, mutters. “Yeah,” he says, kicking dirt.
They cremate him. Gather his ashes. The village is removed, quaint. High in the mountains and as beautiful a place as you could find. If anyone notices two Avengers walking around, they don't mention it.
“Now you get it,” Steve says slowly, rolling up his sleeves.
Killian sits back, smiles, buttons up his jacket with one hand. “Apologies,” he says, “I’ve stolen your time.”
The glass is cool on his spine. “Stop,” Steve says. “Strip the rest of the way. I want to see.”
Steve is establishment, and alpha. When Tony wears his scent, no one even dares look his way.
“That’s it,” Steve preens, happily. “There, just go easy now, Tony. I just want to talk, and have you listen to me.”
“Pierce,” Tony says, when Steve rolls onto his side to face him.
That’s reassuring. Steve is stroking his skin. “I love having you like this,” Tony hears himself say, voice distant, slipping into sleep. “It’s all I want.”
Tony accepts this. He doesn’t want to see Nebula now, her twitching lips, her dark pits for eyes. The stew is good, the meat tender, almost too spicy for his tastes. “Thor was just telling us what happened,” Bruce says, closing the lid on the pot. “He says Asgard is gone.”
"Good boy." Steve murmurs. He passes another slice past Tony's lips. "Are you still hard?"
Peter is sobbing again, but this time it’s angry, unrestrained. He’s trying to tug free, even as Steve steers him away from the crowd. “Calm,” Steve says, not a balm, a command; the kid doesn’t want kind words, Steve knows. He wants order. Steve has been here before.
Fury takes that in his stride. “You seem to have a firm grip on him.”
specific thing. He knows that Natasha likes to go to the movies by herself, and Clint keeps disappearing to Iowa, and that Bruce has an alpha fetish. He knows all kinds of things. He keeps tabs because they’re living in his home, and it’s important to – to know what you’re dealing with.
“Right. Ask him. Next time, think it through first. You can’t afford to lose focus because Tony is dead.”
He trails off, pointedly. Tony shuffles on the chair.
“And did you save anyone?”
“Nice of him. Do I get to find out his name?”
He kisses him, bites his bottom lip.
No one urges him to date, or anything like that. But there is something in the air. There is an unspoken line: ‘Get better.”
“’kay,” Tony mumbles, not really sure what Pierce means, but not… caring. Not knowing enough to care. He’s almost asleep, deep somewhere, anyway. He realises at some point that he’s naked, but he’s not cold, and so…
Tony frowns. “Oh,” he hears himself say.
“I don’t,” he says stubbornly, because Steve doesn’t understand the
“Too much, I think. Hundred, hundred-twenty maybe.”
Neck in a brace, he can’t move. He can only desperately strain his eyes, left, right, brow beading with sweat. There are no friendly faces. The ground beneath him is moving too fast.
He hears crashing in the kitchen. It doesn’t sound like decaf. Aimlessly, he decides to investigate, although he suspects he knows the cause; Steve has – crushed a mug against the countertop. And now he’s bleeding. “It’s fine,” he says.
Tony never treated him with kiddie gloves, Steve remembers. Cared for him, made sure he was safe, sure – but not to the point of indulgence, or coddling. Peter’s old enough. He deserves truth. “Did Strange talk to you?”
“I don’t know if ‘busy’ is the word, but sure. I’m not bored.”
As Tony often does, when he’s alone, and reflecting, he thinks about his dad.
“I’m sorry,” is the first thing Steve can think to say. “For what happened.”
“Have I?” He asks. And the atmosphere sours. Just like that.
“It’s complicated. I think Steve is damaged. Not as much as me but – still damaged. He thinks he loves me. He’s obsessed with me, I don’t know why. He chose Barnes over me. Anyway that’s why the hospital wouldn’t let him see me. I figure they knew we were — toxic for each other.”
Steve turns. “I love you, Tony. You know that.” And there’s reproach in his voice, isn’t there? He sounds like he’s scolding a child.
Tony manages to draw a square. It’s probably the closest he’s come to drawing a line without wiggles. Once, Tony was known for his steady hands. He could draw schematics without rule, dead straight, even while roaring drunk (because it came in handy more than once.) Now he struggles to write his name. It’s not a bad thing, necessarily; it’s not like Tony will ever need to sign anything important ever again.
“The line is in your rearview.”
Tony stares at him, uncomprehending. “Neuh, sabaltin,” he says, coherently.
"Wait and see." Steve says, standing and making his way over the coffee table that was pushed out the way for their scene. He selects rope, soft and worn, perfect for a good wrist bind, and a blindfold. From the bowl of fruit, he picks up a tangerine.
“No, we’d buy a place. Are you forgetting I have money?”
Tony’s eyes widen. “Not like this,” he says, “yeah. Yeah, you know – I, uh,” he shakes his head, “I saw some stuff, up there – “
Tony snorts. “So that’s a no, then.”
“I’m sorry,” Sarah says quietly.
This time, he dreams about sunsets and blushed skin and strawberries mixed in yoghurt. Pink-tinged and pretty.
“Steve,” he says, softly. “Hi, darling. Good to hear your voice.”
The doctor pads away, but Tony’s mouth is still so dry. If he strains hard enough, he can see the cup, sitting on the bedside table, still full. He licks his lips, tries to roll towards it. He cannot move.
Steve’s nose twitches. “Where am I?” He asks again, slurred, eyes clouded. He shifts his knees between Tony’s thighs so they’re spread; apparently, Steve has just realised the person beneath him is omega. He’ll fuck him, if he has to. Anything to keep him here, and keep him grounded.
“Soldier,” Pierce says, gently. “You can do as we agreed.”
“Do you want to leave?” Steve asks, genuinely. “Do you want to leave here?”
“To someone. Like, with Pepper. I loved her, but… I didn’t think we could last. And I was too scared to commit. So we broke apart. Like that. And when you’re talking to that person, all you can think is, I love you, I really fucking love you, but I couldn’t bear to lose you. And probability tells me we’re going to break up eventually so… better just rip off the bandaid.”
“Yeah. The look in your eyes, Tony, God – oh, God, oh
“I didn’t say that.”
“Uh huh,” Tony insists, clenching down, pushing back, working on getting Steve deeper, closer. “Want to see you.”
Tony is pouring the bleach into a large cup. He’s mixing in vinegar. He wants to die.
One hand still in his hair, the other pinching at his lips, feeding fingers into his mouth between gum and cheek, because he can, because Tony would never bite back, docile as he is, and Steve knows it. He pulls back Tony’s head, takes back his hand, and works his cock. “This is what happens,” he says, voice a mix of solemn and lust-laden croak. “I didn’t want to do this, Stark,” he lies, “but sometimes, bad boys need to be taught a lesson.”
so I'd just like to clarify that Diana is completely insane.
Tony’s heart is in his throat. “I don’t know,” he tells him, carefully. It’s as close as he can get to,
Don’t you dare, growls the first voice. Don’t you dare let HYDRA bring him here. What will they do to him Tony, what will they do…
“Poor Tony,” Pierce sighs, briefly patting his hair. “You must be exhausted.”
“Ah,” Pierce says over his head, discarding his phone to the side, brushing down his hands. “Rumlow. So glad you could make it.”
Steve always feels light-headed, when Tony mentions that. It’s like piercing a balloon. It reminds him of reality, that Tony is older, and human, and he suffers physically in a way Steve never will. He swallows, puts down his chopsticks and says, “Oh yeah?” As casual as he can manage.
“You’re implying it.”
"Home." Steve says, succinctly, pushing him down the corridors.
“Don’t say that,” Steve says weakly. Tony was scared, he knows. Of the dark, of what lay beyond. Ultron, and civil war, it was all just – him trying his best. “When you say, he’s gone – “
“Do you?” Pierce laughs. “Well. You don’t have a track record of holding
“They would… help… me?” Gus mumbles, eyes closing.
Tony frowns, picks apart the contents of the package. “I didn’t know you had gags in the thirties,” he swallows, keeping his voice even.
Should he tell her? Tell her how close he came to slitting his wrists?
“You shouldn’t threaten me, Rumlow,” Tony smiles, knocking twice on the door. “Steve doesn’t like it. It raises his blood pressure.”
Steve stares at him. And then: “It was nothing,” he says, “you said you were tired, is all.”
Steve’s hand grasps at his cheeks, pinches them together, tugs his head forward viciously. “Always have an answer, huh?”
Steve laughs then, swallows, nods. “I haven’t said anything, yet.”
Steve hovers. “Are you okay?” He asks eventually.
“Sir,” someone replies, respectfully, and some of the footsteps fall away. Tony blinks hurriedly, shuffles himself back further against the wall. He can’t even scent well, because his nose is blocked with mucus.
“No.”
“Shut up, guard-dog,” Tony frowns, without looking round. And then he follows, off into the crowd.
He doesn’t know.
It hurts to have his hair pulled, Steve steering him like he can’t waste the words on instructions, tugging him back off the railing, pulling him down to his knees. “Is the floor cold, sweetheart?” He mocks, kicking apart Tony’s bent knees with his boot.
"I bet it does." Natasha says dryly "How are the ears?"
Without much fuss, he pours the rest over Pierce’s face. Then, unstoppers another, this time pure vodka, and does the same. He shuffles around Pierce’s jacket, his rising and falling chest, to pick up his lighter.
“A three-month probationary period,” the doctor continues, suitably chagrined. “After that there’ll be an official assessment as to his readiness to be back in the field. I mean – if that’s in the cards for you,” he says, questioning.
“It’s fine. It’s so fine, it’s totally fine, actually,” Tony smiles, sickly sweet. “We were having a good night, weren’t we? I thought maybe we’d put on some Netflix, open a bottle of wine, you’d fuck me nice and slow and then we’d go to bed happy, but – shit, I don’t know, Steve. Maybe I was deluding myself, huh?”
Tony blows air up against his brow, feels his hair lift. “One sec,” he breathes.
“Yeah. The hardest choices require strong wills, you know? I mean, unless you wanted me dead, but then – I figure, you wouldn’t be standing in my tower, hugging me.” A brief silence. Tony clears his throat, and flicks his eyes away, the way he does when he’s – shy. Unsure.
Soon, though. Soon, it will be.
“He’s my dog.”
He’s not alright. It’s not alright. Nothing is
but the words don’t connect in his head, and all that comes out is a mumble, a murmur. The person tsks.
He shuts his eyes. One of Steve’s hands are resting on his thigh, holding him; the other is leaving his hair, tracing a very light line down his cheek, to his chin; tipping it left and right. “Are you drunk?” He asks.
“Okay then,” Steve says, simply. “Not like you not be chatty, is all.”
"And the bar. I liked what you said, about, you know, about being under your desk. I like that idea."
He wakes in a bedroom. He can’t remember moving. He hands are not bound, and he’s free to move. There’s an ensuite, no razors, and Mosely rests over his feet.
Tony stares. "The ears?"
Tony frowns. “Did I? I don’t – I don’t remember…”
Steve gets one more burn in. And then he lights up again.
Okay. “Look at you,” Tony grouses, “big macho alpha, huh? That’s impractical, Steve. There’s a trashcan, like, right there. You could have just thrown it away.”
“I know,” Tony says quietly, as if he needs to be chagrined, as if he’s at fault.
“It wasn’t – he wasn’t trying to kill himself,” Steve says, almost desperately. “He said he wanted to swim, it’s his meds, they’re screwing him all over the place. He was fine this morning, up and alert. An hour in he was practically drooling.”
Tony curls his head into Steve’s shoulder. It surprises him; a few days ago, he was afraid that Tony wanted him dead, that he hated him for what he did, resented his presence. Now, though, he tightens his grip. “Do you really still love me?” He asks.
She’s wrong, the first voice whispers. Or she’s lying. She’s with them. They all want you dead, they’re all out to get you, torture you, they all want you to suffer –
Steve braces his arm on the wall, above Richards head. Leans close. “Tony,” he breathes, “was sixteen.”
"Do you want to say a few words?" Steve asks, quietly.
"Oh? Is he our new fearless leader?"
Steve can’t understand what made him seek out Bucky so much. This is where he’s at, now, regret, wondering what he could have done differently to make Tony live. He was happy when he thought Bucky was dead, so what made him forsake everything once he found out he was alive? Would Tony have stayed? Could they have repaired their relationship the real way, not the sticky tap and glue mashed together disaster that happened after Steve returned from Wakanda? Rhodes’ words keep playing around his head. It’s guilt, obviously, what he’s feeling. God, it’s guilt. It’s guilt, it’s guilt, it’s guilt.
Why did Steve make him do this? Why did he make him do this, why has he made him come down here, they all hate him, hate him, hate him, Wanda smiles gently and she’s laughing at him, they’re all laughing at him, he’s going to scream, he’s going to scream at all of them, he wasn’t ready for this he isn’t ready, why did Steve have to make him he was always making him why couldn’t he just –
“He hasn’t got so much time for you, huh,” Rumlow says at his back, watching Steve disappear down the hallway.
“If I wasn’t chipper, I’d cry,” Tony grins, fishing out a pack of cigarettes. “Want one?” He offers, holding it under Rogers’ nose.
Strangely, he doesn’t think about the contracts, or the things he told him. He doesn’t think about the things he did to him, either, because that’s no use now. But he wonders what makes a man that way. To put your child in those situations, for your own gain, or worse. Tony couldn’t do that. He’d rather never have children, ever, than have to put one of them in harm’s way.
“I did, didn’t I?” Tony had forgotten, what it was like to have so much money you didn’t need to keep track of where it was going. “Did you… use it?”
He moves on to Tony’s tie, undoing the knot and sliding it across his shoulders, shoving it in his back pocket. “One day,” he continues, plucking at the buttons of Tony’s shirt, “Buck’s satchel goes missing. Now, he doesn’t remember so well, because he was drunk out of his damn head, but he knows for sure he and the pretty bitch were fooling around, drinking, smoking, having fun. And after he wakes up, the bitch is missing, and his satchel – with everything, all his money, his tickets, his photographs from home? – all gone.”
“I don’t follow.”
“Shut up,” he mumbles. “I mean – “ he looks up, panicked. “Don’t tell me that, Cap.”
With love,
“Here.” She passes him a bowl.
Steve allows himself to consider it, just briefly. Half the population gone, what next? Regroup. New lines in the sand. Maybe even new countries, new leaders. Maybe they
Tony clears his throat. “Jealous,” he says, evasively, at Steve’s retreating back.
“Billy might have slipped some vodka,” Pierce mutters, like he’s annoyed, “at a kid’s party, would you believe? Who would do something like that, huh?”
“No, I – “ Tony tries to smile, easily, like Thor does. It turns out flat. “I don’t want to interrupt – “
“She is an artist, Captain,” he breathes “she’ll do a lot worse than this.”
“I’d never been,” Steve says eventually. “I’ve never seen the falls.”
your reason? A picture of you, being a slut? Well I’m glad it upset you, Tony, it upsets me, too. Am I supposed to think my omega did things like
He wants to say,
He thinks, back to the in-between times. An ‘off’ in the on-and-off that was Pepper and Tony’s relationship. He looks at the sinew of Tony’s neck, and remembers resting his head there once, listening to his pulse.
Steve snorts. "You're such a princess." He says as Tony's hands grip the edges of the bath, as he fights to keep in a moan. "And you're always so stiff."
“We have more,” the girl asks “if maybe a puppy isn’t your thing? Usually they go so fast… but we have more mature dogs too!”
It barely lasts 10 minutes, all things told. When Steve finishes, he finishes with style, a heavy grunt, one final thrust. Tony is bizarrely tempted to tell him to keep it in, let him knot – but the realities of being tied root and stem when some poor cleaning-person comes wandering through isn’t a great one.
“Yeah, it – very – very detailed, so. Thank you.”
Pierce laughs, claps the back of Tony’s head, heavily. “I don’t think he can talk,” he says. Tony hears the flick of his lighter, the ignition. Spark, and then smoke.
“Someone should,” Steve shakes his head “say a prayer, or something.”
Tony blinks. “Now?” He croaks “Looking like this?”
“For you? Always.”
He slips his arm beneath himself, starts to push up – Steve knocks him back down. “Stay,” he orders shortly, pacing to the observation window. He cracks his fist against it once, twice. Slams his body against the wall.
Tony smiles, dozily. “You’re such a traditionalist,” he sighs.
“You know how I know you’re clever? The other bitches we tested on could barely string a sentence together by now. Which is strange, because you really are
“No. I thought, maybe, I could help. Save people, I mean. I thought — ”
He clicks a button, the slideshow moves on. A picture of a small village, somewhere in Eastern Europe. Old Nazis who figure themselves HYDRA’s spiritual successor. The few shop-fronts burnt husks. And then a photo, with the upper face blurred, of a young man, bleeding from the mouth, dead on the floor.
It’s dark, it’s late. This is probably an exercise in futility. It’s nice to see that people still leave flowers, cards, memorials. That Tony is not yet entirely forgotten.
“For what it’s worth – I don’t want you to change for me. And we’ll talk about that. But I appreciate what it cost you to say that, Tony. And I really love that you – care enough, about to me, to offer it.”
Steve shifts his grip so he’s supporting Tony’s lower back with one arm, spits on his hand. “Aww,” he simpers, “you’re a desperate little fella’, aren’t you?”
Tony turns. “Is that some kind of joke?” He asks, desolate, half-way to angry.
"I'll talk to him," he hears Rhodey saying. He listens to his footsteps, coming up the stairs. The knock on the closet door.
Rhodey uses a chair, now.
That’s all you have to say. That’s all he has to say.
“Rut,” Tony hears himself say. “So, those alphas – all in rut, and then – “ he winces. “The omegas.”
Tony kisses him, because it’s what he knows to do.
“Yeah well common sense won out. He couldn’t be seen to be letting Wakanda be the earth’s first line of defence.”
“He doesn’t lose.”
No, not possible. The old man can’t die. He’s unkillable, he’s – fucking eternal.
Steve turns. “Why did you take me?”
“It only heightens what’s already there,” Steve scoffs. “Those poor – huddling like that. I can’t,
“If I can do anything – “ Steve starts, and she waves him away.
Such trust. Nick will be so happy with his latest acquisition. “Great,” Tony tells him, shortly. He takes another drag, flicks ash into the sky.
want to know? Will it bring you some sense of closure for me to tell you the truth?"
The driver frowns at him in the rearview. “What?”
Tony looks unnerved. “Well alright then, weirdo. That’s only seventy years of history you’ve misplaced. C’mon. Ugh,” Tony absently kicks away some rubble from the entrance, “this is going to be a bitch to fix-up, you know? By the way – this might be a little harsh on your taste-buds. I know you’re stuck in spam and condensed milk time, which is… famously not great. Does a guy like you get refeeding syndrome?
“And — and are you sure? You want to go.”
Steve is moaning, coming, finally. “Fucking hell, that mouth – Jesus, Stark, fuck,” he breathes, using Tony’s mouth to push into the pleasure, “you swallow that come, don’t you, you filthy whore. God, that’s it, Stark, you beautiful bitch. You beautiful fucking bitch.”
Tony agrees. If Pierce says it’s not safe, it’s not safe. “Easy now,” he’s saying, “I’m can’t pick you up, From Stark, so can you stand? If not, Rumlow will help, won’t you Brock?”
again.”
Tony leans into it. Pierce’s eyes are shut. He wraps his right hand in Pierce’s hair, slides them there, lovingly, a caress, the same way he touches Steve. And he curls his left hand, wrist broken,  around the lip of the decanter, heavy crystal.
“Even if I hadn’t loved, you would be the reason. You ran off with my team and left me with nothing other than my brain dead best friend. You didn’t speak out at my trial. I had no one to back up my defence that Wanda catalysed me building Ultron. I lost everything, my money, my job, my friends. I mean, I could have tried to cooperate with you I guess,” Tony reasons “but why? The rest of the world agreed with me, America agreed with me, not you. And I thought — I don’t know, hey, maybe I’m the innocent one, right? I just thought that you would support me. I just — stupid, stupid Tony, I just relied on you, like an idiot.”
“Jesus, Tony – “
“He told you.”
Tony eyes it warily, and then stares at Steve. He stares back, uneasy. And almost imperceptibly shakes his head.
“You’re not the first monster I’ve met, Diana,” Tony says, laying himself on the table. “You’re not shocking me, here.”
“How often do you wake up thinking your somewhere else?”
Thor shrugs. “You would be better asking Loki, he always paid more attention to philosophy. Natasha took me to a church once, I’ve been told about the Christian notion of heaven and hell. I suppose every culture, universally, has a different name for where their good people go.”
talk? Or do you not want to? Because, I don’t know which one is more a cause for concern.”
“Did he approach you? Did he want to talk?”
“This is fantastic news, what the hell is wrong with you?”
Steve covers his hands. “I know,” he says, quietly.
Steve hears himself – laugh. Laugh? “Hi, Morgan,” he smiles, “you doing okay?”
Quiet. Breath is held, no one talks.
Tony mouths.
There are a few other people milling around, laying flowers, saying prayers. Tony pulls his beanie hat down firm over his head, keeps his eyes trained on the ground. He moves quickly, keeping his pace firm. Last year, when he came here, he’d had a driver with him. And there had been press following him, wanting to get his reaction. And they had played the clip over and over on the news that night, talking about how Barnes had killed his parents and what this meant for the Avenger’s amnesty.
Then, he says “Somewhere, behind these walls,” another rasping breath “are the elder vampires. Left, for, for thousands of years, to rot, and go insane with hunger.”
Tony shakes his head. “I just – lost myself, for a second,” he says, and Steve spins him around, clutches him to his chest.
“Not my – you’re bleeding.” Steve stumbles back. His face scrunches. “You’re
Tony shuts the drawer, throws his sleep clothes on a chair. “Do I seem like the type of person to just lie back and take it?”
His apartment is warm. Tony’s left the lights on for him, and there’s a traybake wrapped in foil waiting for him in the oven. Thoughtful, although Steve’s not hungry. The door the bedroom is slightly askew; near enough silent, he slides through and peels off his damp coat, slings it over the chair to Tony’s vanity.
"True."
Tony doesn’t trust him, he realises. He keeps saying that,
The name drifts across his brain. He feels dozy, pleasantly buzzed.
Tony holds out the drink. “He asked about our little incident in the stairwell.”
Tony looks up, but keeps his eyes down. Steve’s earned a little bit of submission, after that show. “Uh huh,” he says.
“Anything.”
“What do you mean?”
“The incident with Stone.”
It’s quiet. The clock is ticking.
“If you’ll have me.”
. Tony can’t remember… he can’t remember anything after the 23
He sighs. "There are lots of moving pieces," he starts. "For starters, most of it hinged on a rat pressing the right buttons with its fat ass. So, just to give you a sense of the scale, Tony Stark only got to even give his life because a rodent was looking for a snack."
“Well, it’s right,” Steve says staunchly. “I’m not quite sure where people’s decency has gone.”
True. But Steve has taught him.
“Oh yeah?” Steve wipes his mouth with a tissue.
“Were the alphas nice to you? I know they can be – I know it’s all very old-fashioned.” Tony smacks his lips, sleepy. “If they were mean, just ignore them. It’s old money, they hate everyone that doesn’t have a polo stick up their ass.”
Some things need a slighter hand.
“I won’t. I’m not going to ask you anything. This is the last time I mention it. But Tony – fucking hell, don’t think I care about how this looks, or how people would – I don’t give a shit, you understand, Stark? I look out for my own. I look out for my fucking
He whimpers. “I’m sorry,” he says, and Steve growls in frustration, shakes him. He cries out, can’t help it; the shock of sharp pain sends his nerves skittering, takes him by surprise.
“Live without me? Why not? We’ve been apart before.”
“You’re shaking,” Steve frowns, taking his hand. “Sweetheart, I’m sorry. I know this is hard. It’s not what I want. But in the long-run – “
“They’re not angry,” Steve says again “why would they be angry at you? C’mon, Tony, no one is – no one blames you for anything, nothing was your fault. They’re worried for you, we all are. Come on, let’s just get some breakfast okay?”
“Tony was an important man,” Clint answers. “People wanted to say goodbye.”
“You hard yet?” They mock the Soldier. Time stretches, and they still kiss, until either is given permission to stop. Tony thinks: this man is not willing. He knows it, feels it in his bones. Pities him. At least Tony – he’s used to it, by now. He was born for it.
“The general says you should bring the suit,” Maria Hill tells him, arms crossed. She looks exhausted, her hair pushed back with a band rather than neatly clipped at her nape. “Oh – and coffee,” she adds, holding it out.
The curling, wiry hairs of his groin are tickling Tony’s nose as he pushes in so deeply Tony feels the bulge in his throat; he can’t breathe. He can, but – he can’t. He wants to beg so fucking bad.
"After -- after I got him back for the first time, the doctors recommended joint therapy. Subs, I don't know, it's easier to recover with the aid of a dom, right? You like to feel supported?"
“If he’s been taken, I want a block on all vans leaving the city,” Pierce is saying, shoes clipping against the marble floor. “They won’t have got far. Rumlow, with me. We take each floor, there’s a chance he drank too much and – “
Tony has to go to Washington to sign off on the documents granting him his assets. He has to press. It’s Natasha who is helpful, who sorts out a tailor, and has new clothes bulk bought and shipped to the house. She arranges the plane tickets, and the interviews, and gives Tony lines to learn.
“You’re being too nice,” someone grunts. The man on top of him eases off; Tony arches his back, rolls his head. There’s a woman straddling his waist, and her nails are sharp. She grips Tony’s cheeks, scratches them down his throat until she finds his soft spot, then digs them into his nape.
Thor smiles, looks at Steve from the side of his eye. “It’s a difficult concept to explain.”
“You mean, for
Steve has to laugh. Oh, sure,
Feeding a sub is one of the most intimate activities a couple can partake in. Trust, on behalf of the sub and adoration on behalf of the dom. Steve believes it's the foundation to any strong relationship.
might be interested.”
Tony’s vision is prickled with black dots. His head is spinning. He feels his eyes rolling back into his head.
Right. Because apparently, there’s something about Tony that just screams ‘tie me up and use me, I deserve it!’ He narrows his eyes, considers.
Their faces are close, their noses almost touch. “Uh,” Tony says, distracted briefly. “Here’s a thing,” he admits, aware that it’s been playing on his mind since Fury mentioned it, “I don’t – remind you of my dad at all, do I?”
It rings out, and he doesn’t try again.
“Shhh,” Killian is soothing again, holding his neutral hand over Tony’s lips. “That’s no good, Tony, I need time to explain. The other option, the
He can’t breathe. He makes himself as small as he can, no one will find him, he will snap and bite his teeth at them. He had done this, he remembers now, crawled away during the worst of it and tried to make himself small, to plead, but they had taken his ankles and dragged him across the floor, and it had burned his chest as he clawed at carpet, and after he’d found microfibres under his nails –
Rogers, how naïve can you get – “
“You come here, pretending to – what, be a friend? And then tell me, ‘congratulations on your engagement to your dead fucking dusted fiancé’.”
But this is your life’s work, and your innocence, and your legacy, and to be frank I’m not going to let you throw it away over three days worth of work. Understand?”
“You would have used Stone once,” Steve says quietly. “And he would have given you things you needed, at the time. But that didn’t stop you from flinching when he touched you, and I’ll bet, Tony, that it didn’t make the things he did feel good, or not hurt.”
“I’m aware. I’m thinking, we might have a common goal.”
“Do you regret it? What happened with us?”
The whole thing feels very sad. It’s more than Rogers being too pure for his own good – he’s not just helping them out of the goodness of his heart, although that probably plays a role. He’s there because he’s lonely, or desperate, or both. Because he’s not adjusting, or whatever.
“No,” Tony says quietly, letting him cup his cheek, “I like it, though. Sometimes. When you say, bred for this, I like to think – maybe I was. That it’s where I belong, to just be with you. Made for you. There’s a lot of security in that, Steve.”
“Ross wants to see us,” Natasha mentions, scraping crumbs from the counter. “He wants to talk about the chain of command.”
agency, and it only really becomes relevant whenever I do something that goes against the fucking grain,” he spits, maybe more angry than he was aware.
“Are you done.”
You don’t understand, okay? Don’t tell me you do. You don’t know what it’s like, all I have to be, all I have to do, is be good at one thing. I just need to keep you safe. I need to, I
“Heal everything. Heart and – and body. All the scars, everything.”
“I’m sorry,” Steve murmurs, because he is, really. He lost his family.
“Do you really want to test it?”
Tony thinks, ugly. He hates every alpha that ever lived, hates his fucking place, hates his dependence.
"Steve, the way he hit the ground, he's lucky to be alive. Yes, dribbling is normal."
“Exactly. History. But I know you have a vested interest in the future, don’t you, From Stark?”
"I hope so. This is his fourth concussion this year."
“When you talk about lines,” Steve continues, “is that your mom? Is she from an old line?”
“Not at all,” Tony lies, nodding and smiling at a passing General. “Just remind me – this is for – “
“But I want to help.”
Tony. They weren’t supposed to go so far,” Pierce admits, “I don’t think he wanted you to be damaged like that, but things got out of hand. Look at you,” he murmurs, “you don’t understand, do you? We had
They televise this, because people want to see. They’ve been lining the streets. On earth, and elsewhere. They carry him. They lay him, draped in a flag, at the podium. The world wears black.
Natasha nods. “It does, doesn’t it?” She says. “Remember, Clint, I worked very hard on it.”
“Need what?”
His eyes drift to the soldier.
“Well then that’s admirable.” Steve says grudgingly.
He holds up his hands, counts off his fingers. “When people want to hurt you,” he starts, “do they torture you? Or do they try to upset me, to get to you?”
“Good,” Pierce tells him, and then: “
“Rope,” Tony says, simply.
Steve sits him at the island table, sets a glass of water in front of him, and makes some calls. He can hear his voice, measured, calm. “… three. Yes, three. Is that bad? No, I think he just misjudged. The pain was worse this morning. He’s fine, totally fine, he just mentioned – okay. I’ll do that, then. I’ll make sure. Thank you, thanks.”
“When you, uh,” Steve sniffs, scratches his eyebrow with his thumb. “Whipped his feet. Did you think that it might have gone too far, then?”
“Tony,” he says again “if, if you can hear me, just, just do something.”
“I’m not sure chances of becoming a superhero would be an option.”
“I’m sorry,” Pierce says quietly, watching him closely. “We knew there would be risk.”
And Pierce stares at him, realisation slowly dawning. “He gave it to you,” he states. “Why?”
Tony is still sitting on the edge of the bed, and he's still wearing the smock, but there's a drip in his arm. "Why is there a drip in my arm?"
Steve stands, mounts the stage. The coffin is behind him. He reads what’s on the cards, and people murmur and nod like he’s saying something very wise, so touching, as if just the fact it comes from his lips doubles its worth.
It means you’re a good liar, Steve tells him.
Tony taps out two fingers on Steve's thigh, bracing his hands on Steve's knees. "Good boy," Steve says, slightly breathless "that's great. You, you just get to work and I'll -- " Steve loses words for a moments at Tony sucks at his head "I'll just sit here."
Tony covers his head with the blanket, pulls it up over his shoulders so his bare feet peek out the other end.
“I’m okay.” He says, eyeing a humous dip. “Just me and my,” he looks at the bowl “salad.”
“It was after Ultron,” Steve tells Tony quietly one night, not long after Steve returns from Wakanda. “That’s when.”
Tony pitches forward, hands fisting in Steve’s shirt. “He’s in my head,” he hisses, “don’t you understand? He’s been in my head, all these years, ever since I sent that nuke into space and saw it all, that death, and the pain, and the sinking black holes of a collapsing star – “
Steve’s lips twitch. “Yeah,” he says, “not so funny now, huh?”
“Good.” Steve says, and turns back to Tony.
“We were,” Steve blurts. “We were still — “
“Understandably.”
“I get to touch you?”
“Uh?”
A week later, and by the time he gets home, he’s shivering.
“Yes. I like testing things, actually. It’s kinda my job.”
Tony shuts his eyes, and spreads his legs. “Yes,” he says, staring up the ceiling.
It’s not that Tony felt he was owed anything – he isn’t. But he’d still been… sick. Ill, with what happened with Killian. And while he never expected Steve to be there, the idea that he’d felt no obligation at all…
Pierce laughs. “Are you sure? That’s very specific Tony.”
“You find it hard to control yourself sometimes, Steve?”
“… three months,” Mr Green is still talking. “I’d like to give you a firm hand, From Stark. I can be very generous, too. Of course, you’d need to be attending the various events I have – as part of the charity, you know – but I’m sure that’s nothing for a thing like you.”
“Jesus,” Steve sighs, letting his head rest on the back of the tub. “Have I fallen into some kind of parallel universe? I’m sitting in a bath, I’ve got $300 worth of lobster in my belly, and I have a sweet bitch practically
She’s proven wrong when they step into the living room and find Clint, the rest of the Avengers except Sam, who had headed back to his parents for the holidays, and Carol noisily chatting.
An awkward silence shrouds them, only broken when the elevator closes shut.
“Steve's been a wreck since you guys stopped being fuckbuddies,” Natasha interrupts gently. “He misses you.”
He didn’t plan on this. They didn’t plan on this. Tony could tell the truth – that he grew up loving and then hating the man, that his heart almost stopped when he heard that Steve was still alive, that the first time they met when the city was on fire, Tony almost drowned in those, blue
ugly, and there are way too many wrinkles on his face, and everything about him is just plain ugly.
Steve clears his throat. “I should—”
“You said you’d keep things simple.”
Steve who has the exact same name as Captain America.
He shakes his head. “Because you’re Tony.”
“They’re not as good as what you do, trust me.” Tony plucks a card from the basket, flipping it over and thrusting it towards Steve. “I mean, this is amazing. I don’t know how you managed to sell these.”
The elevator doors open. They step into the common area.
As always, Steve is early. He takes his usual seat, whips out his crayons, and tries to ignore the empty seat next to him.
Now would be the right time for Taskmaster or Batroc or any random villain to swoop in and kick his ass because
One outing turns to two to three and then Tony could barely keep count because all the days somehow bleed together when he’s with Steve Rogers.
Thor frowns. Bruce and Natasha exchange glances. Clint raises his hands in surrender.
“Then
It gets sold the next day.
“I know, I know.” Her lips curl upwards. “But the thought still counts, you know. Very sweet of you to willingly wax poetic about me.”
Tony smirks as he fishes his phone out. “You possessive dog, you.”
“I do want to tell you,” Steve says hurriedly. “I really do. I just… I just need time.”
, it says in that scrawl he knows all too well and just like that, his world is turned upside-down once again.
“She helped me choose the ring.” Tony peers down at the ring box in his hand, a fond smile playing on his lips. “Well, technically
Tony shrugs at him, wiggles on Steve’s lap. He’s wet, and Steve is thickening beneath him. He could do with a nice fuck, maybe – what does he have to do to convince him?
“Well, I got busy,” Tony says, by way of explanation.
“Tell him to take me home.”
“You’re such a – “
Steve sighs. “I guess. He’s – it’s good to be around alphas sometimes, you know? I know he’s aggressive. He’s good at his job. From what I’ve seen, that’s all that counts.”
Barnes doesn’t even need two hands to hold him. He manages to drag him out only holding him to his chest, and then Tony’s screams alert the others. Steve, Natasha, Sam. Tony kicks, and spits, and tries to bite, but they push him to the ground. He screams, and screams, and screams.
“No, for — everything. You gave her money, covered the cost of treatment. You… paid.”
He gathers up the come and saliva, draws a figure of eight on Tony’s throat. “You’re going to stink of me,” he says, sounding far too pleased. “They’re all going to know. Let them, next time. Let them try talk about one of my own.”
“I’m talking world-ending events here, Rogers. Slightly higher stakes than what to eat for lunch.”
The guests who get seats: Potts and Rhodes. Tony’s big friend, the boxer, whose name Steve can’t remember. Natasha, Vision, Helen Cho. Clint has come, and is sitting silently with his wife, his children, who are crying even though they never knew Tony, not really. Sam is there, stoic, head down, hands folded in his lap. Vision looks out of place in a suit, yet listens the most intently out of all of them as a religious man — what kind of religion, what denomination? Why is there someone like this at Tony Stark’s funeral at all? — talks about ashes to ashes, heroism, sacrifice. Steve keeps thinking about how heavy the coffin had felt, and how awful it was Rhodey didn’t get to be a pallbearer, and how in another world it could have been different, and Tony could be carrying Steve.
Real? Alive? Here. Somehow, after all of them have died, he is here, he has made it, and – what is that? That feeling? Is it anguish?
“You need to step away now, Captain,” someone says, “I’m sorry, you’re just too big to fit, and we need to treat the burns.”
Pierce laughs. “No. I… I’m immensely grateful to the Captain,” he says, honestly. “I suppose – I would be lying, if I said I didn’t worry. About him, about his mental…”
Steve doesn't drop his wrist. He tightens his grip, almost imperceptibly, eyes desperate, vulnerable. "Don't leave." He says "Please, don't leave."
not a freak with no hair. He hates himself for not even thinking about it. About how Steve is going to have to pretend he likes it, as if he didn’t always love pulling his fingers through Tony’s curls. Tony knows he did; Steve never said it, but he knows it. Which is the selfish part, because he
“I don’t think it,” Tony answers, but his heart’s not really in it, not when Steve is dragging a nail across the sensitive join where wing-bone meets skin.
him --
Tony dutifully shuts his eyes tight, letting Steve wheel him out to where a nurse it waiting to collect the chair. The wind is blowing her hair in her face. "Captain," she says "do you need help loading him on board?"
To be used.
“What carrot did Howard dangle in front of you to get you to agree to that?”
Tony thinks. Effortless. Sleep comes quickly, like falling into ink.
Tony’s breath catches, briefly. He’s shorter that Rogers – no surprise, little omega doesn’t match up to souped-up-super-soldier. Contrary to what his Napoleon complex sometimes tells him, he can’t actually go toe-to-toe without the suit. And he very much does not have the suit at this moment in time.
"Home." Steve says again "We're going to the quinjet, and then we're flying home."
“Well, it’s been seven months, Steve.”
As usual, comments are amazing! Especially on the OC's, I love to hear on how you think they're flowing.
Steve looks up. “I’ve been meaning to say,” he starts, “when he was – after he used the gauntlet. I know he wasn’t – that he wasn’t all there, but what you said to him? When you told him, that we would be okay, that he could rest?”
“Well I’ll try to give them a good show.”
“No!” Tony cries, and he bodily pushes Steve away, punches his chest. “No! I don’t want — FUCK!” He screams, bending double, expelling the curse from deep in his chest. “Everyone fucking leaves me, everyone. My parents die, Pepper goes, Rhodey’s dead, you — you and your stupid, stupid little friend, and your fucking egotistical conflated sense of moral superiority, I gave you everything and you left, and even Sarah, Sarah — “ Tony falters, swallows hard.
Steve narrows his eyes. “Fury talked about me,” he says, because he isn’t stupid. “He thinks what happened in the stairwell was a loss of control.”
There’s a rolling cheer, a ripple of laughter and delighted screams. Tony frowns, buries his head in Steve’s neck; the light is too bright. Someone is pulling off his shoe – who is pulling off his shoe, if he’s in Steve’s arms? He cracks open his eyes, he can’t make out their faces. Blurred. Blur of pink skin and light hair. All of their hands.
"Thirsty?" Steve asks, watching Tony lick his lips clear of juice. He nods, shifting forward slightly, mouth parting enough for Steve to tenderly tip the top of the bottle into his mouth. He guzzles eagerly, and when they're done, Steve dries his chin, hand cupping his cheekbone and thumb smoothing gently over his skin.
"I think," Tony sighs as Steve works out a kink from his neck "I think it comes under objectification. Just -- there. Keep working that spot, would you?"
Tony nods, slowly. “It’s… nice to be here.”
“Well, tell him I’m…” Tony is trying to flatten his hair. He catches his reflection in the window. He wants to tear out his eyes.
Thor holds out his hand, demanding, cursing his brother’s existence. “Always gets away,” he’s muttering, “this is like the halls of learning all over again, guess who’s left holding the snake when all is said and done – “
"No."
He hears Diana cluck her tongue, hears the drag of metal on metal as she prepares her knives. He thinks about all those evil things out there in the dark. He thinks of Thanos, he imagines Diana coming up against him, and he smiles to himself. She is pathetic.
“Really, I mean it. It’s like — “ Steve halts.
Tony does. He can’t remember.
“Not for you. Just – “Tony shakes his head, “in general. But if I’ve been a bitch – that’s why. I’ve just been tetchy. I cross lines, I say shit that isn’t funny.”
No one ever uses that word, Tony thinks mildly. They probably should, because then he could get used it, and he wouldn’t get that awful buzzing in his ears when it’s brought up. “What about it?” He asks, mildly.
Dawn is just a strip on the horizon. The air is clean, and clear. A sharp chill in the air.
Steve snorts, scratches his hair. “You have no idea,” he says. “It’s been a really long day. A hard few – weeks.”
A whole life lived. Birth to death.
“But look at us now.”
“I had a wife,” Gus says, mostly to himself. “I had a wife. And she was taken away.”
“Can you — could you ever forgive it?”
Tony does.
Steve reads the news over his shoulder. “Huh,” he says, shaking his head. “I guess he’s going to be keeping his hands to himself from now on.”
When you were born, I was sick. After, how many children, two, three, four, my lost girl, when you were born I could not bear it. Could not bear you. With your crying and your shrieking and up all hours of the night. Howard would leave early and come back late and I was with you all day. And I'm ashamed to say that there were times I simply ignored you. I would go about my day as if you didn't exist. I'd hear you crying in your cot and I'd be able to tune you out, even when your face turned red from the screaming.
“There’s a common theme, then”
He hears Steve sigh, can imagine him kicking off his shoes, lying back on his couch. He wonders what kind of couch Steve has. He wonders if he even has a couch.
Tony knows what that means. They’re saying, if you cooperate, you’ll go home. We’ll set you free. He knows that means he can’t surrender. No surrender. “I’ve faced worse than you,” he snarls.
“Not really.”
Before Tony responds, he’s putting two fingers inside him no prep. Tony is tight – he could have done with the stretch. Still, Steve is anything if not efficient. He fucks him carelessly, almost lazily, seeming to enjoy the sound of Tony trying not to moan at the feel of his fingers, helpless, forced to accept the pleasure. “Is that good, sweetheart?” He drawls, accent all Brooklyn-sharp.
"Go away," Tony whispers.
"Fine."
Tony kisses his cheek. “No, bad boy. I think he’s learnt his lesson. Will you come to bed, now?”
“God, stop – whining,” Tony teases, drawing back. “C’mon. We can fix this, then you can – punish me,” he adds, “even though the world and their mom is gonna know it, I’ll allow it on this occasion, okay?” Tony would like to feel something. He’d like to feel nails in his skin, fingers in his hair, bruises and bites. He’d like to feel himself again, even if only for a short time.
“You shouldn’t have made this personal, Pierce.” Steve’s voice is measured, which is more dangerous than anything. “I think you’ve misjudged.”
"Don't." Natasha says "Don't wake him up. He needs the rest."
Steve smiles at that. There is an air of Thor around the dog, big and bulky with his long haired plume. He seems regal, loyal – like Thor, wherever he is.
“A small inheritance from my dad. I sold my apartment. A few savings. Enough.”
Tony feels severely put-out. "But I always fly." He says as Steve pushes him into the elevator.
“You have a heightened self-worth, Stark,” Fury scoffs.
“Be better?” Steve asks, quietly.
"Cockwarmer." Steve says, with just a hint of sarcasm. "Is that another thing we should put on the list?"
“That’s enough of that, then,” Fury says, snapping the tube out of his hand, quickly depositing it back in the baggy like it’s radioactive.
"You're welcome, Tony." Steve says, half soft, half smug. He's only human; the idea of reducing his sub to this through careful touches and chosen words affects him as it would any other dom. "Are you ready to come?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve watches her retreat. “She was charming,” he says. “I didn’t know you went for beta women. Did you date?”
“Fuck off,” Tony hears himself saying. “Just – fuck off, Rogers. Who are you? Who the fuck are you to – you shouldn’t have even looked, you read a couple pages about me and think you know anything? That you’re a fucking authority, that you can psycho-analyse me? Fuck
“Good morning,” he says, too cheerfully. Tony doesn’t know if Steve is genuinely happy he’s here or just trying to put on a brave face. “How are you feeling this morning?”
“It’s fine!” Tony bites out, kneeling, trying to scrape the glass back together. “It’s fine, it’s fine, it’s fine. I’ll just,” he laughs “had an accident, so – I’ll fix it, you, you go and deal with Nat – Natasha, I mean, you – ”
"It's passcode protected."
“If I answer, will you come to bed?”
“Like an idiot. I
"Breakfast!" Tony announces, and he hears a clatter. He blinks, searching for Natasha. "Where'd she go?"
“You’d like that,” Steve tells him roughly, fucking back in, scratching the back of his head and sighing, biting his lip. “Yeah you would. Be fucked and knotted on the floor like a dirty slut, taking it outside of heat, show you who’s boss. You’d like that, wouldn’t you Stark?”
“Up,” he says, gently, gripping Tony’s hands and helping him stagger to his feet. “Pants. Shirt.”
“It’s fine.”
Steve – hooks his arms underneath his legs, lifts him up bodily. He doesn’t even ask if Tony can walk. “Keep your eyes open for me,” he says. “Talk to me.”
“We need to
Steve’s throat feels thick. “Well, it was my pleasure, darlin’. Don’t need to thank me for it, just doing my duty.”
“It’s not,” Tony tells him, “you’re going to drip blood in my coffee.”
“You… gonna let me go?” There’s an instinctual, hind part of Tony’s brain that is flaring mild panic signals.
Tony looks away. “I don’t want to,” he mutters.
so vulnerable compared to Steve. He could do anything to him. He couldn’t stop it.
“Yes, Ty, my number one sexual fantasy would be
“No. Like I said, it’s something you need to see. He – there was a drug.”
“This must be so hard for you,” Pierce seems to smirk. “An alpha like you, sitting there, hands on your knees like a good boy. Biology seems to dictate that, at a certain point, an alpha like you would come to throw me down. But, here we are.”
“Jesus.” Richards covers his face with his hands. “I don’t know. It was so – “
But then he also asks for Steve sometimes. He asks if he’s coming back. He asks if he can go home, because Mosely is waiting for him. He asks if Mosely can come here. He thinks even Steve could stop HYDRA from hurting him.
“Consider me convinced.”
“So stop talking about it,” Tony hits back. “
“Not a thing?” Tony asks, sceptically.
It’s a small metal roller-ball, the kind you would get on the cheap lip-gloss that came with the teen magazines Tony read as a kid. He scents it, delicately, once. “Oh,” he says.
Again, Tony almost feels bad for him. Almost.
Tony clamps his hands over his ears. He tells them to leave him alone, he’s sorry, and next time he’ll be better. He’ll fix, he always fixes it, just leave him alone. If they leave him alone he’ll bring them back, rewind the clock. “I’m sorry,” he says, rocking back and forth. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry – “
Pierce leans forward and stubs his cigarette out in the tray. Tony flinches, stupidly, but Pierce doesn’t see. “You know,” he says, “it’s been gratifying watching you, From Stark. Immensely gratifying.”
“Me.”
“No,” says someone, voice – haggard, familiar. “Not Tony, Tony’s – he’s gone, in the sky, flew off. Jesus, Cap – “
He sees Steve coming and going. Mostly, they ignore each other. Sometimes, they fight.
“I won’t ask again,” Pierce warns.
“Earlier, you said – you didn’t know what you did wrong, to make me leave. I just hope you know it’s nothing you did, Tony. It was all me.”
Days pass like this. Weeks. Tony, inevitably, puts on weight. His mind – while not shaking itself of lingering fears, paranoia, and crippling depression – starts to stitch itself back to together. The days have structure and clarity. He starts to read again. He starts to have higher thinking processes again. He starts walking, and is shocked to see that spring has been and gone, and the days are getting warmer, the sun longer, the flowers already bloomed.
“Nothing to be sorry for,” Steve says roughly, clearing his throat. “You’ve been there for me, Tony. You’ve, uh. Given me a home. So, I’m here for you now. Whenever you need me.”
Tony lifts his chin, smiles up at him. “Sure, sweetie. Mr Kieran – “
"You're allowed to sleep, you know." Steve says. "I'll just wake you up to check on you."
Steve corrects himself,
“I’m wet,” Tony says, bluntly. He grinds himself against Steve’s pants. “Do you want to, or not?”
Tony frowns, tendrils of sleep fading from his mind. He lost his maker, Gus, Gus died at the border. And his imprint, his imprint is Steve, so why—
Tony raises an eyebrow but doesn’t open his eyes. “A shop,” he says, slowly.
Steve pushes off the wall, frowns, rifling in his inner pocket. “He wanted it?” He asks, casually. “Who wanted it?”
“How old are you?” Tony asks abruptly one morning.
“If you can clear out the coffee table, I could maybe go for a dance.”
“I’m smarter than him.”
Head pressed forward, and getting air down his trachea is like breathing mud through a straw. His lungs won’t expand enough, the vest doesn’t let them, and he can’t gulp because of the gag.
Pierce smiles again. It doesn’t reach his eyes. “C’mon,” he says instead of answering, “I have a gift for you.”
yh poor tony
“It didn’t work. I ran out. Then he stabbed me. Thought I was gone, for sure, he – said he knew me. ‘Stark’, he said. That he knew me, you know? And then he put his hand on my head – “
"I should be better for you."
for tech, no no, I know you’re — “
He crouches behind Tony's back. "How are your knees?" He asks.
“Sorry, am I not supposed to?”
bed, not in some random room in the tower.”
"I was thinking about our list. All those things you want to try out." Tony pushes back his head to look up at Steve, see him smirk.
A bus, passing by, honks it horn, loudly, aggressive. “What the fuck you doing?” The cab driver asks, hitting the break.
Tony made it. He’d had it, before – Before. He’d kept it under his bed. Steve had found it, one night.
Tony shuts his eyes. “Uh,” he manages, mind blank. “I was real – it hurt, this morning. I got confused, I got the days mixed up. That’s why I took too many.”
“You were at Auschwitz?”
“Why would someone want to rile me up?” He asks, depositing Tony in a secluded hallway away from the main ballroom.
“I promise.”
Tony might say something like, no time, or, good enough, but Steve is already picking his way delicately through the down, each brush, each pluck, sending cascading shivers up his spine, filling his head with that delirious buzzing.
Steve favourite was a sushi bar a block away from the tower. It used to make Tony laugh, how impressed Steve was by the automated counters. He thought it was like stepping into a sci-fi novel, he thought raw fish was something so exotic, and so like every other part of their relationship, Tony indulged him.
They pass him around. He disappears from inside himself.
Tony runs the pot under the water and taps his fingers against the counter. “I was with Steve,” he says casually. “We went for a drive.”
Sarah fishes some tissues out of bag and wipes down Tony’s cheeks. He hadn’t even realised he was crying. “Right,” she says, and her voice is thick even if her tone is matter-of-fact. “Well, would you like to leave here?”
Thor claps him on the back, and Tony stumbles. Blanket wrapped around his shoulders, he follows like a ghost, settles on the edge of Bruce’s cot, as far from the rest of them as he can be. No one mentions it.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve shakes his head. “I’m not getting naked. Strip, or I’ll strip you, walk, and leave you to explain to the next tech passing through why you’re tied naked to a chair.”
“In – in-between,” Steve stumbles, slightly. “We would – you were on and off, in-between. But never – Jesus, Pepper, never when – “
“He’s right,” Peter says, sadly. “You shouldn’t get so worked up over me, Mr Stark.”
They stand there. Tony’s hands are still bloody.
Tony's lips part without a thought. He stretches his mouth wide, waiting for whatever Steve wants. "Stick out your tongue."
“Because I was happy. I was so happy.” Tony turns back, and his eyes are glazed, either with the need to send himself away or the border of tears. “I thought I had everything.”
“I guess you… got those other calls, right?”
“In the car. I said I’d take him off Steve’s hands. They were very good to him, but I think he misses you.”
"I live to please." Tony smiles, dipping a finger into the jam and sucking it clean.
“Tomorrow. Hold off on the walk and we’ll go together. Get to work on some of that ball throwing technique, hey?”
Tony shrugs. He’s pleasantly surprised. “Sure,” he says “I mean – you should check with Steve.”
“Forget my file.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Nick snorts. “I’d say so,” he agrees, leaning back in his chair. “Glad you’re feeling more yourself, Stark. Even if it still strange to have you so quiet.”
Steve blinks, and looks up. Mosely rests his chin on Tony’s leg. “Why?” He asks, slowly.
“Yeah,” is all Tony says “they were.”
“Didn’t sleep last night, really. Didn’t eat, either,” and now he’s realising he’s
the first voice mutters,
Steve is very – calm, would be the word Tony’s looking for. His face gives way nothing. “I was under the impression you wouldn’t make it,” he says, voice cool.
There are clothes stacked on the bedside table. Another subtle hint. Tony accepts this with just a sigh, stripping off the filthy white shirt that was once Steve’s and now resembles a bloody, grey rag.
“Of course I did,” Tony says truthfully, hating himself. “You know they all saw, right? Pretty much all of them. I wouldn’t put it past Fury to have a copy for blackmail.”
Steve moves forward, casually, with an easy grace. “Did I ever tell you about the bitch from La Rochelle?”
“But if you let me do the things I do because it’s a transaction, not because you like it,” Steve presses. “Then I’m no different to him, really. Or any of them. Because I’m just using you, and you take all that awful shit, even if you don’t like it.”
Lana told him, long ago, about a man driven insane by the loss of his child. His first made. And she had explained, how, she had heard, through her studies, that it would be possible to replace the child’s blood with his makers.
“And now, Captain Rogers.”
“They’ll heal,” Gus mumbles, and he looks very much like he wants to sleep “just, leave me, let them heal.” And he drops his head back against the wall, goes completely limp. He’s not sleeping, his eyes are cracked open just the slightest, but his breathing is even, in and out, in and out. He’s just not quite all there, mentally. Steve wonders if right now he pictures his home.
you weren’t happy about it. I didn’t listen on purpose, I just thought… in case he tried to hurt you. I just felt he wanted to hurt you. I could sense it. I have good instincts, Tony.”
The next time, Tony has moved back to New York. It’s been seven months since their one night stand, and Steve hasn’t thought much of it since. In that time, Tony has taken on a terrorist group and won by the skin of his teeth. He says he doesn’t want to be iron man anymore, that he’s going to stay in New York while he recovers.
“I got a cab,” he explains, “had to wait in the rain.”
“Tony…”
“How many?”
See, they’d all held him there, too. Touched him on his neck, carded their fingers in his hair and pulled. Stroked, too – petted, like a dog.
“Tony,” Steve says, simply, “you’re right. I agree.”
“I never stopped.”
It’s hard to think of anything at all, save for the cock in his ass. “Knot me,” he moans, “oh fuck, knot me, Captain.”
“Cute. I think I’d rather keep the dominance play to myself, thanks. Plus, there’s spunk in my eyelashes.”
Tony thinks, it’s probably important to Steve.
“There wouldn’t be rules. You’d just know. At first, it might be harder for you – maybe, you’re so used to just doing what you want, touching who you like, you’re not used to being owned.” Steve slides a hand up Tony’s chest; he cups his throat. With his thumb, he strokes the skin behind Tony’s left ear, probably enjoys his shiver, the way his mouth opens, just slightly, helpless to it. “Maybe at first, I need to be stricter. I have to tan your ass a few times, because you’re being more than bratty, or because you try sneaking off with some young stud who thinks he can take you away. But I always think, secretly, you do it because you like it. Being put on my lap, I mean. Having me show you your place.”
to help you!”
She may join the elders. She had said that, once. Talked about how she would love to join them, live among them. See how life once was for their kind.
“HYDRA isn’t hiding behind every lamppost, Rogers, it’s not 1939.”
“It won’t kill you,” Fury admits, “I know that much.”
– he’s been whipped and beaten and choked. The pain gone, on that surface level; they must have given him good drugs. But inside, somewhere all calcified and rocked over…
“To who?”
Steve’s chest tightens. “He never mentioned he was interested.”
He lets go of Tony’s hair. He can’t hold himself up. He pitches forward into Pierce’s shoulder, smears drool against his crisp white shirt. “There there,” he soothes, stroking his hair. “Shh. It hurts, doesn’t it? Being so open. Like a wound.”
“Here,” Pierce says, gently, buzzing them into his office. “I know it’s not luxury, but – it’ll be a relief, right? To get away from all that brass.”
So Tony is wrapped in the gown Sarah got him for his birthday, and his matching slippers, gratefully accepting the coffee she’s passing around, balking slightly under her warning eye. Natasha is sitting, legs crossed, flicking through one of Sarah’s albums. Peter is fidgeting.
Carefully, tentatively, Tony raises one of his hands, makes it cup the back of Steve’s head. “I’m here for you, Steve Rogers,” he says as calmly as he can. He strokes Steve’s hair.
A slight breeze lifts the hair on Tony's head, the back of his neck prickles; in that moment he feels something pass through him, over him. He thinks about death. He remembers the life after closing. And he smiles, because although some things fade away, no one is ever truly gone.
Tony nods. "Or pear."
Steve shuts his eyes, fingers twitching on Tony’s wrist, holding it to his nose. “T’hurts,” he mumbles, then groans, face screwed.
You should have known when you took him, Steve says heavily, that I would never give you peace.
Tony licks his bottom lip. Steve’s pupils blow. “Why’d you love my mouth so much?” Tony asks him, genuinely curious. “What kind of fetish is that?”
“Hold on,” Steve says, finalising the knot. “My team is coming, there’ll be help soon.”
“Well, then I’ll make sure, okay?” Steve kisses him, just gently; Tony sighs happily, lifts his chin.
He shrugs a shoulder. “I’ve been expecting it.”
"Tony -- don't joke. Don't joke about -- about the nightmares, it's not funny."
Okay, so, first of all a massive thank you if you're still reading this! Also, thanks to EVERYONE who has commented, kudosed, etc, you are the reason I'm still writing it!
Tony exhales slowly. “A bad business.”
Steve isn’t really one for parties, Tony has learned. At least, not parties where the main aim is to schmooze, and make small-talk. Tony thinks… Steve is probably the kind of alpha that likes a fucking punch-up. Smokey rooms and pool, too much cheap alcohol and even cheaper omegas. The uptight room full of brass and their wives probably isn’t his style.
Tony shakes his head, smiles. “No. In the academic sense, understand? I’m instrumental. I’m – built for a purpose. Or, I’m used for a purpose. Not like you. You’re just – an end in yourself.”
“I travel,” he says.
"We're fine." He smiles, taking Tony's shoulders. "C'mon," he says "up you go."
They spend a Saturday shopping, because Tony wants to. He talks Steve into buying a new suit, and so then Steve dutifully trails around while Tony sprays perfumes and compares shades of rouge he’ll never wear and holds up ties to see which best matches Steve’s eyes. It’s indulgent of him, and Tony appreciates it, hooks his arm when he offers to carry the bags, kisses his cheek when he rolls his eyes and mutters that he didn’t fight a war to be a pack mule.
In this chapter we kinda reach the turning point in the plot so
“Killian.”
“What if it is?” He whispers, frantically. “What if they’re in my head? What if they’re all trapped, somewhere, and they’re trying to tell me – “
“Mmm?” Tony presses, drowsily. They’re tangled again. Steve curled against his chest, their legs entwined, no saying where one starts and the other begins.
“Dad wanted him to sell up.”
the second voice admonishes.
good company, as I’m sure you know.”
Tony’s tongue traces his lower lip. He knows what Steve wants to hear, he thinks. “Knot me like I deserve,” he breathes, “I fucking deserve it, to have my – my pussy used by you,
Steve sits up. “Seriously?” He laughs. “Am I? I am, aren’t I? I’m your – your taboo? God, of
Pierce stubs out a cigarette in an ash-try. “It won’t be hard,” he’s saying. “I know you don’t believe me, but there are studies that prove it. They’ve repressed them, of course,” he tells Tony earnestly, “they repress anything that goes again the current
“Know? No. I’ll tell him when you’re gone. Unless you want to see him, that is.”
“Why?” Tony snaps “Why, do you want him, too?”
“Tony,” the alpha breathes, fucking into him shallowly. “Take it, Tony, you beautiful bitch. Yes, yes – do you like it? Do you like me inside you, Tony?“
huh?”
There are people talking over his head. He tried to drown himself, someone says, Steve we can’t be prepared for that.
It’s dampening, to say the least.
“The same man?”
Peter screams. “You should have told him! Told him the truth, from the start! You – you – “
“Don’t understand?! Tony, someone — was it Wanda? She’s covered by the treaty, isn’t she? Do you think — “
“So could I.”
A quick kiss to the crown of his head. “I never stopped loving you, Tony.”
“And love,” the human points out. “You must, because when he said he killed your sister – “
Still, losing the child has hurt him, or maybe just losing in general. Nebula thinks, this is a man who is not accustomed to losing. Loss, maybe. But he’s a man who likes to win.
Steve shrugs a shoulder. “He’s an influential man.”
“Or I’m using you,” Tony says tiredly. “Does it matter? As it happens, I sometimes like having my hair pulled and my face slapped, okay? We’ve been over it. Stop overthinking it.”
Tony’s eyes narrow. “Subordinate.”
Are there days when you can’t get out of bed? When everything dissolves into mush? When you want to drop a weight onto your skull and let it push you deep into the ground? Is that why you drink? Because it could be excusable, Tony. If you get help.
“Good?” Steve’s voice is hard. “Is this funny to you, Stark?”
“But you could?”
“That’s it,” Steve urges, grunting. “Just like that, you sweet little bitch.”
Tony nods, agreeing. “So bad,” he says, not really thinking.
Steve blinks. "Seriously?"
Tony shivers, pitches forward. He thinks – he doesn’t think. He’s not thinking, at all, exhausted, and shut off. And Pierce is stroking his neck. “I think he’s dangerous, Tony. Do you trust me?”
There’s something sad about it, Tony decides. Two people, both pretending they don’t know, or care.
“The rest?” Steve asks.
“Doesn’t matter,” Tony mutters. “I don’t have a right to mourn. Not when we’ve all lost so much.”
“I don’t know. I guess at least now I can pay you back everything you gave Sarah.”
Tony points. He shuts his eyes. He hates this. It’s pathetic, and childish, but he hates changing the dressing.
Steve’s place is nice. Homely. There’s a record player in the corner, and it’s stuck on something nice and bluesey, mellow. The living room smells like smoke – Steve must’ve been smoking, but then, the smell makes him feel sick all over again.
