"Tony, are you serious?  You were dying?  Why didn't you say anything?"
The soldier stared at him, blankly, not knowing what the Avengers were or who Tony was.  He doubted very much that Tony could kill him, though. No one could. People had certainly tried.
"And I thought maybe... maybe he was still alive. But that man I met in there wasn't Bucky. I don't know what he was, but Bucky, the Bucky
At the conference, a week ago, Donner had said "no."  And now Donner had gone the way of Astray. Had been "trickshotted," as the omegas at the conference called it.
Piper smiled, a gesture that seemed automatic rather than sincere.  As if she just smiled every time Eric spoke to her. Tony found Piper to be extremely unsettling, both because of her age and because of her weird Stepford-wife vibe.  Also, Tony was feeling a lot more awkward around Eric. Sure, Tony had slept with his fair share of girls younger than him, but Piper was very distinctively a
."  He turned to Steve.  "Sorry, you probably don't get that reference.  It's a really funny TV show. Go look it up!"
He'd just rounded a bend and was starting to think he had a fighting chance at actually holding his own when he saw it.  There was a person on the track.  Pit crew?  Tony couldn't tell, didn't have time to tell.  He didn't even have time to react.  The car in front of him was suddenly in two pieces, and then there was a massive, body-shaking crash.  Tony couldn't have said exactly what happened.  He saw the man, saw the car in front of him spin out, and he could've sworn that the guy flung something at him...but what the hell could he have done to stop a car going over two hundred, anyway?
. Of the drag of Tony's fingertips and the wet heat of his tongue. Steve could feel himself responding down
"About what Happy told-- never mind."
Steve undeniably blushed when Tony gestured to his erection. Maybe it was his forties sensibilities...but it didn't matter how many times they did it and in how many positions, Steve would always be at least a little bashful when it came to sex. You didn't talk about it back in the forties, certainly not in public at least. Steve knew he blushed far too easy and he would probably be more embarrassed by it if he didn't know Tony liked it.
There a bruise blossoming on his neck by his gland. It wasn't a huge one but it was a nasty shade of purple. Steve caught Aria staring at it and he just shook his head at her.
He decided to change the subject.
"Building robot suits and blowing things up isn't a good coping mechanism, either.  Steve's in heat and he's extremely vulnerable right now. You need to go talk to him."
His gaze traveled up to the words on the wall.
"He designed weapons, you moron.  Overseas, they call him the Butcher, the Reaper, and the Merchant of Death," said Hill.
"You sure you're ready to see me like this?" Steve asked, voice soft and tone genuine as his gaze flickered up to Tony's face, studying it intently.
"I was drawing you," Steve admittedly quietly. "I saw you working and I couldn't help myself. You were so lost in the moment. You can...see it, if you want," he offered, voice soft and expression gentle.  "You should really try and eat some of the pancakes."
"Suppressants aren't all bad if you don't take too many.  They prevent heats, pregnancy... personally I don't want to deal with that shit," interjected a man suddenly, shouldering into their group.
Tony frowned.  "Steve," he said.  He scooted around to face Steve on the bed.  "...the whole
He frowned. He looked down. His leg felt... strange.  Tingly. Steve reached down and pulled- was that a
By the time JARVIS announced that he had re-calibrated his self-awareness programs, Tony was fast asleep on a pile of old photos, the bottle in his hand nearly empty.
"I think we should do a scan," Natasha suggested quietly. "To search for...scar tissues that might have survived the whole serum process.  Scar tissues that might be below the surface, that we can't see.  If they're there, then we'll need to start looking for him.  Because the only way for him to have shown up like that would be if he was alive."
.  Male omegas can impregnate betas or other omegas.  Just... not Alphas."
"...not been sleeping great lately, I don't know, I just can't handle rotating shifts."
, Steve.  Beverly Hills Parking Authority is ruthless like that.  Seriously, the Mark IV was never designed for flight, hurry up and open the window more, I'm coming in, move it..."
Clint's grip on the phone tightened.  "Wh-what? ...you... you found... you found Barney?"  His voice was rough with sleep and he wasn't sure if he was dreaming or not.  "...is he..." Clint's voice sounded dangerously close to cracking. "...alive?"
"Pepper, let's get out of here," blurted Tony.  "Let's be spontaneous.  I don't wanna spend the week doing press statements, let's go to Italy, or... or we could hit up Amsterdam... we're in Europe, let's live a little, be healthy... we can get a little place in Venice, relax, have a
.  You need to establish a causal relationship between behavior and outcome.  Now, there is one exception. Who wants to guess?"
"...awesome?" supplied Tony.
"Cut," said someone off screen.  "Boom mic."
"They were both recent, I think.  Like, only a few years," said Tony hopefully.
"And that heat! Jesus. That was awful. I hadn't one before in this century and I had forgotten how shit they are with the serum. Before they'd lasted like a day or didn't even start at all. I got to spend a whole week in preheat. It was awesome," Steve recalled fondly. He would paint fanatically in preheat, his imagination completely boundless. He'd never produced such raw and honest art work outside of it.  Preheats, like postheats, could be fun.  It was the heat itself that was crippling.
"Ruined," said Karpov darkly.  "I've had him nearly thirty years and they've reduced him to a mess.  That damned witch... I don't like her. Never have. The control we have over her and her rabbit, it's tenuous at best."
.  I-- I don't even like to work with them."  A pause.  "The problem is--"
"Naw," said Tony.  "Look, Aria, I got this for ya.  I probably remember the words... uh, lemme think...
The wet hair plastered over his forehead and dripping into his eyes took away some of the seriousness Tony was clearly trying to convey.  Also, he clearly couldn't stay still; his fingers were moving on his arms, playing invisible piano chords, and his knees were bouncing, jiggling really.
"What?"
Gleason frowned.  Tony let out a half-whine and half-growl as he reached between his legs.  "Okay, okay, I'm good, right? We're good? ...can we go bone now?" Despite his protests, Tony had to admit, he preferred having Gleason look him over than some jerk from SHIELD.  He sort of knew Gleason, and he and Steve got along well, and Gleason also had Pepper's blessing. Gleason was about as close as Tony would ever come to actually liking a doctor.
"Whatever.  Just saying, good on you, for making your trio work."  Jasper flicked his cigarette.
Tony reached for Steve's hand.  "...thanks for doing this, guys.  You need funding, bill it to S.I., okay?  Me n' Pepper'll take care of it. C'mon, Steve..."
She smiled.  "Well, congrats.  Is this... your brother and your mate?"
And the press, too? Well this day was just getting better and better. Aria was going to
"Ty didn't come; something about not wanting to make people feel uncomfortable," Steve said regretfully. It saddened him, really. And how many more kids like Ty would they have on their hands after 84... hundreds? It was an awful thought, to think that their lives had been ruined with such a burden. Steve wished that Ty had turned up, just to say a big 'screw you' to men like the reporter from First Alpha.
"We need to find Steve," said Natasha.  Her gaze turned to Sitwell. "Where is he?"
for the first time a part of him wanted it to be special. Maybe it was cheesy. Maybe it was his old forties values peeking through.  But maybe that wasn't necessarily a bad thing.
"The house staff has all already seen me naked, and you've got nothing to be ashamed of, Rogers," said Tony, throwing a grin over his shoulder.  He widened his stance a little, trying to stand on tip-toe and knocking over a small bowl of potpourri.  "Oops, dammit... CORRINE!" he shouted suddenly.
"Over a thousand actually," said Tony, looking proud of himself.
The rational part of him was slightly scared by this.  Steve wasn't normally
Tony noted that not all the wristbands were red.  Some were blue, some were black, some were green. His curiosity was piqued.  He spotted Eric and Piper mingling with another pair, a man and a woman, the woman in a ridiculously ornate collar.  Eric was wearing a green wristband.
magazine.  Hanging out with Pepper and sitting through meetings had been terminally boring.  But safe. It had been safe.
"Because they're degrading, Tony," said Pepper, who didn't look a bit amused with Tony's Socratic line of questioning.
"It's always about you, isn't it?"
"You're not from SHIELD?" Steve asked, admittedly surprised. He'd expected one of those straight faced scientists from when he'd been seeing Bucky in simulations, or someone like them.. .not this woman. She looked approachable, calm, and seemed to be genuinely worried about Tony. Which was sweet.
Trickshot held up two fingers to his forehead and tapped.
Maybe Steve sounded crazy. But he could work with that, if HYDRA thought he was losing it.  Actually, crying and acting hopeless might be a strategically good choice at the moment.
He obeyed, spitting the stuff into a trashcan.  They were backstage, next to a folding table that had been set up and was slowly but surely buckling over a bunch of camera equipment that had been set up on it.
him either," Banksy said. "He can sell you again any day he chooses to Donner. You need certainty and you need stability for your baby, and that isn't going to happen with Gideon. He thinks with his stupid knot, not his heart. He doesn't treat you like you deserve to be treated."
"It's like a semi-heat Steve. It's like a good 60% chance. You know that... right?"
Steve's run was much  like the others. He ran along the beach and back again and would usually run until he felt satisfied. It would take hours and hours to tire him like this. One other male runner along the beach stopped him at one point for a selfie but that was all and Steve was left relatively undisturbed. It was peaceful.
Tony let Steve pull him to his feet.  The headache that had come so suddenly had vanished just as quickly, leaving Tony only with a shaky memory of it.
"Are you kidding?  That would suck. Poor kid would always end up being overshadowed by Christmas, and cheap people would get him one gift for both holidays."
"Never mind.  Anyway, Banner flipped out and was tearing around the campus destroying everything.  They had to bring in the National Guard.  The best part?  They were using my sonic cannons!  AccuTech's stock
"I thought that was...I thought you were okay with it," Steve filled in, suddenly feeling awkward. He didn't know how Tony felt. Would he forgive him, did he think he could do? He reached out to Tony when he turned around but then quickly pulled his hand back, feeling nervous.
"Tony. You're your own person, I'm
Tony cocked his head.  "...no one's ever told you you were a good omega before?" he asked.  "But... but your... your old Alpha..."  It hurt to say those words.  Hurt like a knife to the heart.  But it wasn't just acknowledging that Steve had been bonded formerly.  It was that no one had ever bothered to acknowledge what a great guy Steve was.  Steve's face was open and honest and expressive, his jaw and cheekbones prominent, his lashes long, his hair perfect.  But that wasn't what Tony liked.  It was the quality lurking just under the surface of that.  Steve represented something Tony would never himself achieve.  He'd seen it only once before, in Yinsen.  A sort of Zen-like calm, a strong but silent, humble adherence to a set of moral guidelines.
"Please read them carefully before sign--"  (Tony was already scrawling his signature on them.)  "--ing."
"There you go, dude," said Lola.  "
They stopped by a Thai takeaway and picked up food on the way home. Steve hoped that if he pandered to Tony's favourite foods that that might up his chances of getting him to eat something.  He devoured a container of pad thai noodles on the drive home; as always, his metabolism demanded constant fuel.
"You seriously think you can out run a guy that can fly?" Steve said, voice hitching a little.
"What the
Steve looked to Tony. He was fed up of dealing with this.
"What makes my body try to reject it?" Steve asked quietly. "I don't even remember it happening."
.  Do I have to wait until Christmas to unwrap you?"  He gestured downward to drive his point home. Sometime between Steve's hip wiggle and the tongue coming out, he'd gotten an erection.
It was past three in the morning when he realized he'd forgotten to come to bed; the only reason for his moment of clarity was that he had slipped on a gauntlet and hooked it up the arc reactor, and was trying to test the range of motion, and ended up knocking over the coffee Steve had left him.
"Hey.  Hey, it's okay, we're coming for him," said Clint, putting an arm around him.  (A pointless gesture, since Tony couldn't feel it in the suit; aside from the helmet he was in full combat gear.)  "Steve's tough. He's gonna be okay."
Every time he thought he was going to surface, his brain shouted hazily at him:
Maybe it was normal for Steve to feel emotional right now.  Hormones and junk.  They would feel better in a few days.  They hadn't even know they were--
He could begrudgingly appreciate at least one thing about Steve's old Alpha.  Bucky had wanted to protect him. Tony understood that. He still hadn't told Steve his inner thoughts (or rather,
So he was bonded to a total psychopath who didn't love him.  So what? He was Iron Man.
them.  And think about the good you could do if you got their omegas alone for the night!"
Danielle came over to put an arm around him and gently lead him away.
"Life's weird," he reflected softly.
Happy.
The effort to get out of bed was monumental but Tony forced himself to.  His ankle throbbed when he stood but he was almost glad for it.  He felt like he deserved it; his Expo had killed six people and knowing who one of those people had been had thrown the whole mess into his face, up close, on display. It was Gulmira all over again.  Tony had to admit, grudgingly, that as much fun as Iron Man was, he seemed to face a lot of death in it.  Never his own, only people he didn't want to see die.
in my life."
. Yeah, okay, look, I'm sorry I slapped your ass, you can stop whining about it..."
"Oh my goodness, where did you find them?" was the first question posed to Steve.
The piano music washed around them as Tony cuddled closer to Steve to nuzzle his neck, taste the hollow of his neck and his collar bones, smelling him, learning him all over again.
"Correct, sir."
to have your head in the game."
Tony shifted his weight uncomfortably.  "Is the bedroom okay to... look him over?  Steve already ruined the sheets there.  No offense, Steve.  It's okay.  They were cheap sheets."  (They were worth $17,000 but Tony felt it was the wrong time to tell Steve that.)
"Yes, of course.  Your contact details, Dr. Thompson?"
"Let's just... focus on us.  On our..."  Tony pause a beat.  "...our bond.  Our pairing.  Yeah?  We got a week off, that should be more than enough time to get all the mushy stuff out of the way before we go back to the regularly scheduled off-the-record government-sanctioned spy stuff, right?"  A pause.  "Oh.  But, just, on the down-low, I would kind of like to... um... do a test run.  Make sure SHIELD doesn't see anything they're not supposed to.  A brain like mine is kind of a minefield, you know?  With great intelligence comes great psychoses.  Another movie you should watch, by the way:
Dr. Brennan looked like she was a bit unsure how to proceed with Tony in the room.  Also, understandably, she looked a bit worried about him. Tony didn't resemble Tony much.  With the full beard (which still had some dried blood in it from Tony being punched in the face), and the glasses, and the stained, baggy clothes, Tony could have easily walked down the street and been unrecognized, so long as he covered the arc reactor.  Much of Tony's look dependent on confidence and swagger, which had evaporated after the scandal in January.
He wasn't aware he was remembering until morning.  He'd been sitting in the bed, head in his hands, making a keening noise.  He looked up; light was coming in through the window. He could still feel weird pangs of arousal, and he didn't know why, and they were so intricately mixed with guilt that he could hardly stand it.  He pressed his forehead against the window with a groan of misery. He didn't understand. That was the worst part. He didn't understand these memories or these feelings. They were foreign, without context, but they haunted him like ghosts.
"It's a political comedy show and they're two of the performers who are here for Steve!" hissed Pepper.
Pepper shot an annoyed look at Steve.  "After all this time you ought to know he hates having his wrists touched," she admonished him.
Steve gasped at the first wet press of lips and tongue and had to stop himself from bucking up automatically at the touch, forcing himself to let Tony explore as he pleased. The way he teased at Steve was maddening and soon he was letting out soft little whines and squirming, his entrance becoming wet. It was almost too much. Steve hadn't been touched like this for over two months (and he'd barely touched himself in that time, either; the serum definitely upped his sex drive, but while he and Tony were separated, he had simply lost interest in sexual gratification).
...typically, the two of them noticed each other's panic attacks easily, but Steve, outside on the phone with Gideon, was not currently aware of anything but his own emotions.
"Hey, good job out there, Rhodey," said Tony sincerely.
"Good. We went to England for our anniversary and Tony's birthday."
After they'd dropped off Donner, Happy drove them to the nearest emergency room without waiting for them to ask him to.  The rest of the night was sucked up into a series of X-rays and resetting of one of Tony's fingers.  One of the nurses brought Steve a coffee and gave an affectionate eye-roll. "...even the great Tony Stark gets into feral fights, huh?" she said.  She was also an omega, a tough one. "I swear, you should see the sorts of ridiculous injuries that Alphas come in here with, all the time... and they always say the same thing.  'I won, you should see the other guy.' Like that is all that matters to them... ugh,
Pepper had tried to interject several times, but Natasha steamrolled her way through the explanation and the line went dead before she could ask any questions.  Pepper stared at the Blackberry in her hand in shock, then looked up at Tony.  She was still trying to wrap her head around some of the finer details, like Steve having a living mate (wouldn't he be like a hundred years old?) and Tony wanting to be in a ménage à trois with her (fat chance).
Music blasted in from the living room. It was music Steve didn't recognize.
"I don't remember my birthday.  Oh my God, my brain, Pepper, my brain's my second or maybe even my first best feature-- top three, definitely--"
for a second before he'd gone and kissed Angelia in front of Becky, then the latter would never of slapped him and cut holes in half his shirts.
"Great!  I'll just have the staff do it for me and bill my room, then," said Tony cheerfully.  "...hey, Donner. What happens to omegas like Ashtray?"
you would react this way--"
Steve had already worked his way through an entire bread basket; they hadn't gotten their meals yet.  Tony was on his second drink.
Tony gave Steve a soft smile.  "I'm always okay," he said, reaching up to run his fingers through Steve's short, soft hair.
"Oh! No one can remember."
"If I was Steve Rogers I wouldn't have mated in the first place," Sitwell said, clearing his throat.
The moment he and Sam were out of earshot, Natasha grabbed Steve's arm in a vice-like grip.  "
Tony lifted out a gun with a silencer, examining it closely.  "...I'll be damned. This is from the Freedom line," said Tony, sounding flattered and disgusted.  The Freedom line had been commercially available for barely over a hundred days before Tony had halted all production.  The few weapons that had been sold were collectibles of the highest caliber, only used in elite teams; the United States only had enough to give out to the SEAL teams and even then, the SEALs sometimes fought over them.  "This is a Mediator II," said Tony, turning it over. "This is one of the best goddamn guns I ever-- oo." Tony's love of tech was quickly overriding his misgivings about getting Shanghaied into this mission. There were dark clothes and night vision goggles and weapons of every imaginable sort.  "It's like Natasha sent us a care package," joked Tony as he pulled on a dark jacket and a black cap.
behind.  Where's Stan?"
Brent was tapping away on a tablet, his brow drawn tightly together in thought.
The omega just nodded, glancing between him and the blood on the wall.
He threw himself over the omega, protecting his body.  The movement was instinctual, natural.
Rhodey swiped the sock aside and sat down while Tony ran over a couple of prostitutes.  He wasn't sure how to address the elephant in the room; Pepper had already warned him that Steve's name was forbidden.
"Hey, Tony!"  Eric was waving.
good.  I've an an IQ over 200, I can count cards... I'll fucking
"Please sir, it's important."
Tony beamed at Pepper.  "It's Christmas Eve. Can we go up to the lodge?" he asked, ignoring the offered hand.
Pepper found a stressed-looking Steve in the living quarters. He was dressed smartly, perhaps a little windblown from his bike ride over, his hair slightly puffed up. His usual perfect appearance was showing cracks. He was pacing with his hands running over his face, clearly trying to calm himself down.
He would probably kill him.
Steve blinked, not really knowing what to say.  "Er...okay?" he said.
take those," hissed Natasha.
Tony cut the jets and let the suit drop; he felt the heat of a missile pass over him, where he'd been seconds earlier.
He watched the tight line of Bucky's soldiers as the scientists left. The man was stood with his back rigid and Steve could see the dim reflection of his face in the glass; he wore no expression. It was sinister the way Bucky shut off, became robotic. But he'd just disobeyed a direct order from his handler. And that gave Steve hope.
And Steve was
Tony was taking a break, playing Pong inside his helmet.
"Tony, you know I support your fad diets, but this juice cleanse... how much of that stuff are you drinking?  I don't know that it's healthy," said Pepper.
"It's so good to see you! My Stevie." Tracy reached up to squeeze his cheeks with a grin. "We have to go out again sometime. That was so much fun. Who knew a 90-year-old guy could dance like such a whore, huh?" She laughed, slapping Steve on the ass good-naturedly.
"Are you okay?"  They'd both stopped.  Tony was still knot-hard and pressed into Steve, but the feeling of uncontrollable lust and primal mating need was gone, courtesy of that bitter taste in Tony's mouth.  He was still plenty hard and plenty turned on, but his brain had rebooted from "fuck" mode and now he could think rationally again.
"I can't wait to be home and in bed," Steve murmured. And he felt like, oddly enough... even with Bucky, and the conference, they were going back
The soldier nodded, not entirely following.  He didn't want to speak out of turn and he always wanted to be agreeable.  Smoking was one of the very few luxuries afforded to him. Being spoken to like a person was another.  Karpov was clearly in a good mood.
"People call me Mac," supplied Agent Mackenzie.
"If you're going out again I might go see the crowd outside," Steve said tentatively. "Say hi. Sign a few protest signs. I don't know. But I can't walk around without you in there and I've been banned from the omega area so..."
"F-fuck..." Steve saw stars as Tony's teeth sank into his neck. His whole body was singing. He felt like he was on fire, an echo of their past mating but perhaps even more intense. He shuddered against him, squirming under his grip a little to test it but the Iron Man grip kept him down. A shiver trembled down his spine. "Tony. Tony he's-"
Steve stared down at the envelope curiously then looked back up at Aria."If it's possible I'd love to meet up with Irshad. But I think she can say everything I'd say on air and more. She was very impressive when I met her before."
"...no, he's still an arrogant, conceited, self-absorbed, smug jerk," finished Natasha.  "...but he makes Steve happy.  And he's a straight shot."
Brooke looked thoroughly undaunted.  "...so... threesome?" she suggested.
"Yeah.  It's below the surface.  You couldn't see it from the outside but apparently he's still bonded to some guy from the roarin' twenties."
"Sir, would you like to turn on the autopilot?  Your current course so far has suggested that your inebriation has compromised your ability to fly."
"Everyone we knew."
He rounded on Pepper.  "This is your fault!  You hired an omega!  This is why I only deal with betas... because they do
"Killing him won't change what he did," Bucky echoed suddenly, making eye contact with Steve.  "Killing Johann Schmidt just made you more like him. You enjoyed doing it but it wasn't a good feeling."
"Stay," Steve said softly in a pseudo request.
He whined as Tony licked over the bite on the back of his neck. And then he cried out as his alpha's knot squeezed into him and let out a strangled sound at the stretch and...and...Steve gasped as Tony hit a spot inside of him that made him see stars as he angled his cold just right. "Oh...oh...oh-ah...Tony...T-Tony please..." he begged, trembling around his cock as Tony teased and pleasured at him just right. His whole body sang with pleasure and his thighs quivered. Steve was panting with each thrust, his hips moving pliantly with it. Little, soft breathless and desperate sounds escaped too, his pleasure totally at Tony's mercy. Steve's cock was hard and curved against his abdomen, smearing precum over smooth, pale skin.
There was a shaky intake of breath on the other line, then Clint said, with a sort of forced optimism, "That's how come I learned lip-reading.  Without Barney I couldn't sign anymore. He was the only one who understood me.  After they took him away no one could talk to me, and I couldn't talk to anyone else, either.  Being mute for three years, it's a hell of a thing, Steve. ...anyway, I... I tried to find him, but even with SHIELD... we weren't ever able to track him down.  I know he changed hands a few times but the trail run cold. And if there's one thing you oughta know about Barney, it's that he was a fighter, like you. He'd never give up. If he was alive, he would have come and found me." Clint voice cracked.  "...he was just like you, Steve. He said to me-- he said,
He spotted Hal's friend, Abby, chatting animatedly with a sandy-haired boy who was smiling nervously next to the girl Piper was talking to.  Without Eric around, Piper, as usual, had perked up, and she and the other girl seemed like they were getting along very well.
Tony relaxed in the suit and jetted due east, admiring the beauty of the world below him, the streets lit up with the orange glow of streetlamps, their courses painted with the red of taillights and the white of headlights.  Tony had always liked driving at night.
"Steve's gonna get me all dirty again, though," said Tony, giving her a wicked smile.
"Nope, cut, we're not having him say that," protested Aria.  "Steve, try not to say shit, please--
Tony waved at the barkeep.  "Hey, can I get another margarita over here?"
!  It's not like a damned mental tattoo that just sticks there; conscious is
"JARVIS, I need you to scan anything that comes into this house for EM signals," called Tony.  "If anyone's trying to bug this place, I want to know about it."
Lydia was putting away the rose gold one, giving them their privacy; Kitty was watching them out of the corner of her eye, clearly fascinated by Steve's presence.
"You know, Tony, we've gotten a lot done today.  You can skip the last meeting if you want."
He and Nat timed their entrance perfectly; all their training together had paid off, and they moved in sync. Natasha knocked a few guards out with tranq darts on the way in and Steve simply snuck up behind them, squeezing at their neck until their stilled and their throat stopped lurching against his forearm. Steve knew there was always a chance of killing them with such a technique, but it was a chance he was willing to take.
Tony rolled his eyes.  JARVIS's program, left alone, tended to evolve.  It was, after all, a learning program; when left alone, JARVIS, "bored," would scour the internet for any and all data.  He had no interest in any one particular piece of information; information was information to him. Tony could go into his code and see what he was "looking" at, and it ranged from top-secret, classified files lifted from the Pentagon, to information on the dietary habits of the black-chinned hummingbird, to translations of the Brady Bunch theme song in every available language.
"I don't understand," he said in a low voice.
, Tony Stark, I will
Bucky obeyed.
Even if Steve wanted to come out, Tony doubted SHIELD would let him.
"Yeah, yeah, a scan," agreed Tony distantly.  "Makes sense, find out if- wait, what?" Natasha's words hit him.  "Scar tissue?  What scar tissue?  ...in his brain or something?  ...is that what's wrong, does Steve have a head injury?"
"I think there's some sort of card game but I don't get it," admitted Clint sheepishly.
He didn't know how to answer that.
"She means, do you confront him," Brennan said. "You know, tell him to stop."
"Kids aren't really going to fit in with the whole army thing, I think," Steve pointed out gently. "Especially with the charity too, and Iron Man. I mean... I get shot at once or twice a month," he joked and the audience laughed. They probably didn't think it was true.
Steve was slowly starting to feel the effects of the coffee.  It had helped.
"Pants!" yelled Rhodey after him.  "...he's not just gonna be Porky Piggin' it, is he?  ...does he normally work naked? No, don't tell me, I don't wanna know."  He shook his head. "Listen, Captain, as long as I've got you alone, I also need to ask a favor.  A couple of favors. Virginia Military Institute, West Point, and the Air Force Academy have asked you to give a commencement speech for their graduations.  All three are this May. I know you and Tony have a thing planned for June, what with your anniversary but... it would mean a lot to the boys in uniform to see you throw on the Cap uniform and give them an inspiring speech.  ...but if you could, you know, leave out the omega stuff and just talk about being in the armed forces, you know... patriotic stuff. ...I sort of already promised USAFA you'd do it." Rhodey stuffed a few papers in Steve's hand.  "Here's the info. Thanks man. I owe you one."
Outside, the phone conversation had taken a turn.  Gideon's voice softened slightly. "I would like it, Captain.  Very, very much. In fact, it would be a dream come true for me to have a night of your company.  And to be honest, I might not want Donner anymore after that... he is, after all, only a pale substitute for you.  But do you
let you separate us," said the boy firmly.
"Vanko," he said.
He heard a soft splash next to him.   He reached out with one hand for Steve's without opening his eyes.  "Steve, I need another beer.  Also, listen to this song, it's a classic.  Actually, can you just get me a bottle of whiskey?  ...and my phone? "  Tony felt so relaxed, weightless and warm, floating naked in his pool with a cold drink and a pair of sunglasses shielding his eyes.  He was glad he could share this level of hedonism with Steve.  Seeing Steve panicking over the tesseract had been... alarming.  A combination of old-timey superstition, Tony thought, and the shock of seeing something from his past rear its head in the 21st century.  Hopefully, Steve would forget all about it, and Tony could study it in peace.  He had access to a large portion of SHIELD's operatives at his fingertips, plus boxes and boxes full of his father's old notes that he'd never gone through that might contain some secret.
the one that found
Tony let out a shriek and jumped away, shaking himself off.  "What the
"I bet I could catch that peacock."
"How's it look?" asked Tony.  His goatee was twitching slightly as he repressed a grimace; one of the residents was gently moving his ankle around, checking the range of motion.
"Oh, my gosh, really?  ...okay, you can blame Dave on that one, he made the pamphlets.  POSSV stands for Partners of Survivors of Status Violence."
"How the hell would I know?" asked Tony.  "You know I think traditions are stupid.  I didn't expect two hundred orchids, but here we are."  He checked the tag on one of the new ones: it was from the Secretary of Defense.  He checked over the vase of tulips but there was no tag.  Something was bothering him, a lot, but he wasn't sure what.  Maybe it was just that the tulips looked weirdly out of place.  Tony expected orchids, not tulips.  Who sent tulips?  Even Tony, who operated well above normal society, knew that orchids were the go-to flower for bonding.
"It's okay," said Tony softly, hoarsely.  "My omega. It's okay. You did good." Under his fingers Steve was trembling and he felt... weak.  It was disconcerting, seeing Steve so utterly broken like this. Tony felt guilty and confused because this wasn't Steve, or at least, not the Steve he was used to.
"How about this?" Steve asked and lifted the prototype of his shield up from under a sea of wiring. "This big enough?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Trickshot's watched Tony and Steve go, his face a stormy mask.  Tony had already begun to think of him as "Angry Clint."
He relaxed a little.  "We really dodged a bullet."  He paused.  "Metaphorically, I mean.  Not literally.  Literally you... you got shot."  He laughed a little awkwardly.
"Interesting choice of words... reforge," said Dr. Brazinski thoughtfully.  "Bonds don't typically break except under extreme circumstances.  And as you well know, bonding is not always a conscious decision.  I think that's the primary concern here, Steve.  That, as reasonable as you are, when you're put in a position between choosing the team and choosing your Alpha, you'll default to your instincts.  And, off the record, between you and I?  If you were an Alpha, no one would be questioning you like this."  She sighed and shrugged one shoulder.  "From what I see, you have a pretty clear head about all this.  I don't think we need to belabor the importance of you separating your personal life from your professional one.  Historically, you've been excellent at compartmentalization.  So I'm going to go ahead and let Fury know that, in my professional opinion, you're cleared to continue operations." Dr. Brazinski reached for the computer's mouse and gave it a shake it wake up the machine.  She peered at the screen over the top of her glasses, clicking around, glancing at Steve occasionally.  "By the way, be advised that the nature of Howard Stark's death is highly classified.  And that precludes you from informing anyone.  Even an Alpha you're pair-bonded to.  ...
The room went silent and Malick froze.  Malick looked down at the collar in his hand.
"How come you puked on the floor?"
"That depends on whether Malick actually loves him, or not. If he loves him, he'll forgive him. If he doesn't see him as a person..." Steve trailed off. The thought of Donner at one of those auctions sickened him. But he'd told Donner to call him if he ever wanted to leave Gideon. If things got that serious Steve sincerely hoped he would call.  Or maybe Donner had family and he'd just leave Malick and go to them.  He hoped, whatever Donner chose, it was
She glanced over to Steve. "Вы должны сказать ему."
"But behaving certainly isn't throwing toast all over the floor," Laura pointed out. She seemed so normal Steve was struggling to work out how she fit into two assassins' lives.
"Listen, maybe Steve's just browsing a farmer's market or something," said Phil reasonably.  "You know how bad he is at charging his phone. Don't you think maybe you're over-reacting?"
"You're avoiding the question.  Can female Alphas get knocked up?  Can you knock up male Alphas?  Can you guys have kids?  Dish."
There was a sudden sound, the shearing of metal, and the car in which Tony had been sitting fell apart into two pieces, a snaking piece of metal severing it like a hot knife through butter.  Tony stared.  Whoever the guy on the track was, he wasn't a friend.  He was a threat.  And against every sensible thought Tony had ever had, he knew he needed to take him down.
He wanted to get a look at Steve's neck.
...if you think about it, this is the position we were in earlier," Steve pointed out to try and cheer him up as he passed Tony a helmet before putting on his own. He got on first, Tony pressed up behind him on the seat. Steve smiled when he felt arms around his waist and revved up the engine. After his Alpha gave him the address he was headed out of the apartment block car park and onto the road.
Tony chuckled slightly under Steve.  "Er.... yeah, actually, JARVIS says what I tell him to say.  Don't worry about it, Steve, seriously, Pepper is a bro, she's totally non-judgemental, I mean... she's caught me choking myself like, at least a half-dozen times probably."
"How is it selfish of me to want you?" challenged Tony.
Everyone's talking about it.  Do you know what Twitter is?  You're trending on Twitter.  ...Nat's really worried about you, though.  She says you looked like shit when she dropped you off last night.  I just got back from New Mexico and you won't
"No, Peggy!" said Steve hastily, grabbing a napkin and shoving it at Tony.  "I kissed Peggy, right before I-- before I went on the worst plane trip of my life. It was nice, to have that." While he was
Tony's head snapped around.  The last person in the world he wanted to see right now was Justin Hammer, but there was he, smiling at Tony, and... one hand was gripping Steve's.  Tony immediately felt his hackles rise, the hair on the back of his neck standing.  He wasn't sure why.  Steve was just his assistant.  Who cared if Justin was shaking his hand?
"I don't want--" began Tony.
"...rough night?" asked one of the scientists conversationally on the other side of the cell, watching the two supersoldiers grapple.
, thought Tony.
Steve sat down in their bed. The jumper was big and pooled around the curve on one shoulder, almost making him look normal-sized.  Almost.  Nothing could ever quite disguise his super serum bulk. He was having one of those days where he missed being small again. A part of him wished he could just curl up in the sheets and disappear. Whenever he had a cold or was feeling poorly he used to bundle himself up in blankets. Bucky would get home and surprise him by pouncing on the bed and tickling him. Steve would laugh so much his face would go red. Once he'd actually not being able to breathe for too long and started having a coughing fit; Bucky had felt so bad...
"Look at his little bum!" giggled Peggy; in Steve's presence, she always seemed younger, more girlish.  "Oh, he was such a little explorer... no sense of anything but his own curiosity..."
"...you want to ride it?" asked Tony softly, playing with Steve's chest.  "...oh... but you've never... it's easy... just treat me like your personal sex toy, your personal dildo... be selfish, for once.  Just have fun."  He squirmed a little under Steve, pushing his erection against him enticingly.  "You're in control.  Go hard or fast or soft or slow, whatever you want.  Treat yourself.  ...show me what you like, Steve."  He set the bottle onto the floor of the bath so he could put his other hand on Steve's hip.
"Do you understand me, Tony?"
Steve whimpered as Tony pushed into him and his body accepted the intrusion easily. Steve was still tight around him, though, having taken no fingers beforehand. He could feel every inch of him and his hole clenched at the stretch. When Tony pressed in a little further and adjusted the angle Steve cried out as he grazed over that sweet spot inside of him.
Steve's mention of the other Avengers helped Tony sober up a little.  He hiccuped, looking down.  Feelings of guilt and embarrassment.  Tony was used to feeling guilty; he was plagued by it, ever since Afghanistan.  But embarrassment was a new one.  Tony Stark was not a man who was easily embarrassed.
"It's a good thing we did a test run," she said quietly.  "I don't think he'll pass.  There's... a problem."

Outside, the sunshine was bright and brittle, and the mountains were covered in a heavy blanket of snow that glistened like diamonds.  Tony had been at the lodge for the last week, unplugged, which was unusual for him. Not unusual for him was wandering around in a pair of MIT sweatpants and drinking liquor straight from the bottle, listening to Excision instead of Pepper.
"I'm from SHIELD," Steve said quietly. Technically, that was classified, but it felt like Pepper had a right to know after Steve had manipulated her like he did. "And I never sent over any designs but they did ask me to, for the record." Steve almost smiled. "I was just sent to see if Tony was right for the Avengers Initiative."
Pepper punched it in.  Nothing happened. She tried again.  Still, red.
"The last thing Steve needs right now is a shrink picking his brain apart," snapped Natasha.
"You took your collar off," observed Tony, looking at Steve with a hint of disappointment.
It was so weird to think of where they were a year ago; Steve felt like such a different person. He'd been so cynical and narrow-minded in his own way... so absorbed in his own moping and problems that he didn't notice anyone else's. Despite all the shit he'd been through, he knew now that that didn't entitle him to anything.  The culture shock of the 21st century had put Steve in a bad place, and it was only in the last year that he felt like he was really, truly becoming integrated, and taking charge of his own destiny again.
"Let's just make sure we get them inside then leave them to it." Aria muttered. "I wanna go home to my bed."
He leaned his head atop of Tony's as the other leant against him and let his eyes slip shut. Steve sighed softly.
guy again, the teenager with the silvery-blond hair.
The picture wasn't what Tony had expected but he was fine with it.  In the suit, the disparity between their height and musculature erased completely.  Cradling Steve in his arms, he looked every bit the strong, powerful Alpha he wanted to be.  He looked like a fucking badass.  There was real concern on his face, but his stance was wide and dominating.  Steve looked almost small.
Tony sighed.  It didn't really mean much, coming from JARVIS.  Maybe if it had been Jarvis...
"Life working for SHIELD is never uneventful," Steve breathed in diplomatic answer and Ty half smiled in understanding.
Dr. Brazinski swiveled very slightly in her chair.  "The question, Steve, as well as the problem, is this.  First of all, you recommended recruiting Mr. Stark to the Avengers Initiative, and that motion is already in process. But SHIELD, understandably, is concerned that your current relationship is going to undermine your efficiency at work.  Thus far, we haven't had any problems with an integrated team; case in point,  Agent Romanoff follows your orders.  But asking an Alpha to follow his omega, well... that's trickier.  And from what I've gathered, Mr. Stark's attitudes are a bit more old-fashioned.  The second problem is that the Winter Soldier- and yes, Steve, he is real- the Winter Soldier is an assassin who intelligence believes works closely with HYDRA.  If there's an association between that assassin, and your pair-bonded mate, are you going to be able to make a judgement call?  If things get down to it?  I suppose that's the basis of both problems, in a nutshell.  Could you make a judgement call in battle regarding Tony?"
"I'll go order for us," Steve told him, pressing a kiss to Tony's temple before pulling away to go order. He knew their take away preferences well by this point.
"Anyway, can you come over?  I'm... um, I'm pretty... pretty legitimately shaken up."  Tony's voice betrayed him in that moment. His tone, which had been one of light, forced casualness, wavered a little.
"Sure," Steve said. "That would be swell."
"I'll ask Colonel Karpov if he'll let us out," he said.  He rarely asked for anything and when he did it was always a necessity.  This, he felt, qualified as a necessity, though. His omega wanted this and it was clear there would be no mating until Steve got his way (he'd always been stubborn).  "...he makes sure I get what I need," he added with conviction.
Tony shook his hands out of Steve's.  "Sorry.  I'm cranky from a lack of alcohol.  I've been keeping an eye on the news.  It's not all positive.  And going through all of my dad's shit..."  He swung a leg over his chair and sat down heavily, dragging over a pile of wires and circuits and loose bolts and beginning to play with it again.
"Look, I don't even care about Steve coming back, I just-- I just want to make sure he's safe--"  Tony's voice was shaking. "--that Bucky character is a dangerous maniac, a stone-cold killer.  Who
Before he was consciously aware of what he was doing, Tony had attacked Sam and the two were rolling around on the floor.
"Oh, thank you," said Tony breezily.  "Uh, about the knot. You can... take that out, though, right?  Let's say, hypothetically, you didn't want to leave it in... maybe you... had somewhere to be or something..."
Wisdom smiled.  "Oh, I wouldn't say that they want
"YES!" yelled Pepper back, before turning back to her phone. "No!  No, no, no, that yes wasn't for you... I meant no."
"...hey, are you doing okay, Tony?" asked Dan.  He looked and sounded genuinely worried. "I know March is a bad time for you..."
Steve swallowed, watching the steam billow up as he poured the boiling water into the mug and watched the amber color bloom into flavor. "I was frozen.  I-- I remembered crashing a plane into the Atlantic, and then I woke up here.  You know what it's like drowning in ice cold water? Not fun. It actually took me over four hours to fall unconscious...never told anyone that before. Guess I just let people assume I got knocked out straight away. I don't know why they thought I did."
Steve.  Jesus Christ, I never stood a chance."
"Steve can take care of himself," said Tony.  He was surprised to discover he meant it.  He trusted Steve.  Not that he had a choice, after the most recent Barnes affair.
In the other room, he was texting, trying to get in.  He needed to talk to the man who'd nearly killed him.  Needed to find out who the hell he was, where he'd gotten the arc reactor design.  He was calling in every favor he could to go see him and he was pretty sure he was in.
On his side of the door, Steve stood on shaky legs and moved to pull on a pair of boxers. He needed to gather himself up. He downed a bottle water. Then another one. He still felt hot all over. Before he knew what he was doing he was trying to open the door, and then-- shit. Steve blinked. He'd broken the door handle off. Oops? He stared down at it in his hands and then dropped it to the floor.
," he added, feeling acutely offended.  Everyone in the lobby was eagerly taking pictures with their cellphones, despite their various maladies, and security had been called to shoo a crowd from the doors.  Calls from the Expo were pouring in and the combination of a sudden influx of patients along with Iron Man in the ER lobby was causing the hospital to fall into chaos.  Dr. McCloud had every right to be furious.  But in Tony's mind, insulting the suit was a bit much.
Steve sat cross legged on the porch next to Nat and Clint, cradling his drink between his hands. It should have been too hot for him to hold still but the serum meant Steve didn't mind it. "Is that your polite way of telling me I need to do more 'human' stuff?" Steve asked, no bite in his tone. He didn't have to turn his head to know they both smiled. That's what friendship was.
Tony closed his eyes and nuzzled into Steve's throat lovingly; he heard Pepper and Rhodey retreat, leaving the two of them alone, and Tony made a small mental note to thank them later for being there for him, even when, lately, he'd been a fairly huge ass to them.  (Although, he defended himself, he
"Oh.  Right.  Well, go fall in love, then, or sky-dive into an active volcano, or whatever betas do instead of bonding."
"You know, to see if you're compatible."
"He was
"I have literally never gotten one of those."
"Oh, give me a break, the other one you're eating for is like the size of a pinto bean!" snapped Tony.  Donner quelled a little. Banksy and George both looked like they were about to admonish Tony for snapping at Donner, but before they could, JARVIS suddenly spoke up.
Even though it was April, neither Tony nor Steve had made any particular plans for their anniversary in June, nor for Tony's birthday in May.  They'd been too busy with Steve's projects. Tony, at least, had assumed Pepper was probably on top of things. Worst case scenario, they could auction off all the orchids on eBay and still probably make a fortune.
Natasha held up a thin manila folder and a small cardboard box that looked like it might contain a necklace; the contents rattled.  "Steve. These are for you."
"If we didn't think he was a mole of some sort, we would be doing this through official channels," said Clint.  "You know if we're wrong, HR is going to have a field day?"
"Pep.  Question.  Could you wire me ten million dollars?"
"Oh.  ...two Morgans," said Tony, trying to edge away.  Shit. He'd slept with one and attempted to sleep with the other and now they were confronting him together in front of... what was her name?  Helen Morganquest or something?
"So he
"...Steve," he began.  His voice cracked. He cringed at himself, cleared it softly, then repeated, "Steve.  It's me. I'm here for you. And I'm... sorry. If you can hear this, get outside, now.  We're gonna rendezvous in--"
name," said Banksy firmly, then caught Tony's eye and nodded in agreement, mouthing,
"Yeah, no, I'm awful with kids.  You should talk to Steve, he's better at this than me."
When Tony was ready Steve gently eased them down in bed, throwing the towel away as it wasn't needed anymore. He dragged the duvet over them and placed a hand on Tony's chest so he would know he was there.
All three were Alphas.
And then he was staring in the mirror in his bathroom, breathing heavily, feeling dizzy, his fingers tracing the bruises around his chest, his neck stiff, painful.
Then Steve really got down to business. He sucked the head into his mouth and swirled his tongue experimentally, Tony's sigh telling him all he needed to know before he sank down lower and the head was nudging the back of his mouth. Steve moved at a steady, slow pace, teasing at Tony as he let his jaw go slack and take him all in. It was a lot easier a second time around now he knew what to expect.  He kept going until he'd taken all of Tony's cock into his mouth and the head squeezed into his throat. He wanted to gag around it but he forced the urge down, focusing on taking all that Tony had to offer. Steve's eyes flickered up and he had a challenging look in his gaze as if to say:
"Um, sure? Who are you with?"
However, when he peeked into the office Aria and Pepper used, only Aria was there.
"  Karpov gave him a slap.
"Oh Stevie. You know, they say blondes are airheads for a reason."
and they'd given up on watching it, because it hit too close to home for him.
Sam cast a disparaging look at Tony; the coffee spill had completed Tony's look of hobo-ism.
me. It's like...they just won't let me be happy. After everything, they j-just..." Steve screwed his eyes shut. "...why won't they leave me
Tony smiled sadly at Steve in his leather jacket and his wind-swept hair.  Steve had to be the most bad-ass omega he'd never met.  He was going to miss him.  "...you, uh, you really think I'm..."  Tony made quotation marks in the air with his fingers.  "...
He was about half way through, using cross-hatching to make the clouds pop out on the page, when his fingertips suddenly felt cold and his hands began to shake. His teeth threatened to chatter. He dropped the pencil onto the floor, probably breaking the lead inside. Steve didn't understand what was happening. He stared down at his hands with a frown...maybe it was phantom pain from the ice (he'd gotten in it in his toes and neck before). But this didn't feel
"We'll get a test run done after the Expo," Steve assured him. "We'll still have a few days between that and your test. Normally they do the cardio the day before-"
"Scared?"
"But what?"
Steve stirred.  Tony had been sitting by the bed all night, staring at him through heavy-lidded eyes.  He was on his sixth cup of coffee. He'd thought Steve would never wake up; it was already morning and Steve had slept through two nurse changes.  Everyone ignored Tony, for which he was grateful.
"In the balls," repeated Tony.  "...although if you were trying to bone him when he did that, y'know, obviously--"
"Well.... yeah," said Tony awkwardly.  "I'm gonna go... over there now. Nice to meet you guys."  He tugged Steve's hand. He need to get the fuck away from this couple.
Tony let out a small, soft sigh of satisfaction and placed both of his hands on Steve's head, spreading his legs and leaning his head over the back of the couch.
Steve wanted to sleep, yes ...but it was his Alpha, and he couldn't leave him unsatisfied.  The imperative to please him hit Steve like a ton of bricks.  Steve didn't hesitate to sink down off of the bench in the bath to the floor of it, now on his knees between Tony's thighs. This felt right. His heat thrummed through his body, thrilled to finally be like this in front of Tony as he ducked his head down.
"Steve," mumbled Tony.  "I want you to move all your stuff in.  It's been two weeks.  Even though it's stupid and old-timey and totally clashes with my style.  I'll pay for the shipping.  Hold on, I gotta check my arc reactor before bed."  Without waiting for Steve to reply, he tugged down his shirt and pulled out the reactor.  Steve had gotten used to Tony pulling it out and digging around in the hole in his chest; he did it nearly every morning in the shower.  He gave it a few swipes and then crammed it back in.  "All's clear," he reported.  "Good night, 'mega.  See you in the morning."
"Sir.  If you retire, who do I take orders from?" he asked.  He'd always assumed he'd be retired before Karpov, but the way Karpov was talking now, he wasn't so sure.
"Okay...sending you the number over now." Pepper paused. "Stan, can I just ask? What was it that made him...exactly?"
Tiberius hummed. "I can imagine."
"...it
"Are you
He took Steve's hand and gently tugged him back out.  He needed to ask Pepper for a new shirt.
"Holding his hand?" Sam hissed. "What the actual fuck is going on?  Also, don't you dare talk shit Stark. You left him first--"
"Perfectly normal and healthy."
idea how many YouTube views I'm gonna get?"
"Get some rest, Captain.  ...and Mr. Stark, you look like you could use a nap, too," said Gleason.
"...no.  Just... a personal favor," said Tony.
Wordlessly, he held out the pack of cigarettes to offer the omega one.
Dr. Gleason raised a hand in greeting.  Despite all of them being familiar, Ty's smell still kept most statused people at an arm's length.  Like a disfiguring scar, it was disturbing and impossible not to notice.
"I'll get Banksy.  Just stop giving him options, okay?" said Tony.  He hung up, then turned around and snapped his fingers at Pepper.
Tony leaned forward and kissed the back of Steve's neck, still rubbing his shoulders.  "No, I mean... sorry... I mean I didn't want any other Alphas to... to have you.  But I'm... I'm being a dick, obviously, you can have whoever you want."  Tony shivered as Steve pushed his hair back.  "Although... for the record... I'm told there's at least one eligible billionaire here now, you might want to check that guy out, I hear he's pretty awesome."
Pepper went back down to the basement.  Tony had finally moved; he had picked up one of his guitars and was plucking a few chords half-heartedly.  It wasn't his usual spirited performance of "Black Betty" or "War Pigs."  Pepper wasn't sure what it was.
Words could not express the disturbing possibility of a person being so broken that their bond no longer worked.
"...did you said regret?"
He was no less impressed when she tore across the stage toward Vanko and, with a flying leap, landed on his shoulders, wrapping her arms around his neck.  He stumbled and the second whip loosened enough for Steve to get free.
Steve blinked slowly. "Er. No. Sorry."
"Yes."
Now it was like they were strangers.  Tony had gone to work, come home, exchanged nothings.  Now he could watch TV and drink whiskey and the two of them would go sleep in the same bed without touching.
"Colonel," said the soldier with delight, pressing against the glass.
Steve opened his eyes and reached for Tony immediately, clearly still half-asleep.
"Oh, what, you think because you're fast, you're better than Captain America?  I bet Captain America thought he could handle himself, too!"
He knocked before entering.
"There was a UN center for refugees but it was so overcrowded they stopped taking the rabbits.  She wouldn't go without me."
"...you might want to slow down," said Sam, unable to keep the judgement out of his voice.
Tony snorted a little.  "Weren't you born in the twenties?  They sent a guy from the twenties to try to figure out how the suits work?  Without an RT node in the middle, you can't power them anyway... no one knows how to make them except--"  Except me, he'd been about to say.  Except that wasn't true anymore.  There was a scary-looking Russian guy who'd nearly killed him, who was currently rotting in a jail cell in Monaco.  The thought chilled his blood.
"How come you need us?  Why can't someone else do it?" asked Tony loudly.
. I know what it feels like to have to have someone cheat on you and I wouldn't do that to you. It's the worst feeling in the world. It makes you want to die, or worse," Steve said, his voice shaking.  "I didn't want to- what happened with Bucky had nothing to do with you. I don't care if everyone in the whole goddamn world thinks I'm a good omega - what matters to me if
"So now that things are settling down with you two... people want to know.  What can we expect in 2011?"
Steve walked
Tony flashed Pepper a stupid grin; she pressed her lips together.  She was wearing a long sweater-dress and clutching a binder (a schedule of some sort, no doubt; she loved schedules) and looking more than a bit frazzled.  She'd probably been dealing with Hammer for at least an hour, by the look at it.
JARVIS was not the only one who was immune to the seeming impulsiveness of Tony's questions and demands.  Pepper had long-since gotten used to it.  And the agent she'd recommended to Steve, Aria, was another woman who, used to juggling the requests of eccentric celebrities, had ceased to question them.  She'd admitted to Pepper that Steve was an easy client because he was polite, reasonable, and agreeable.  His lack of knowledge about modern technology was a small price to pay considering his overall general respectfulness.
"Not exactly," said Steve.  He remembered how Donner had cringed away from him whenever Steve tried to talk to him.  "He's Gideon Malick's old mate. We met Donner at the conference. Donner didn't walk out but he ignored Gideon in front of everyone and Gideon severed the bond and now he's been--"
Bucky was relieved when Pietro and Wanda finally came out of the bathroom.  He was having difficulty following the press conference on television.
"Oh, come on, you can't just gloss over how you met.  It's the love story of the decade!  Come on.  Tell us all about it," insisted a woman across the table.  "We don't all have the benefit of being on the World Security Council, you know."
"Tony, I'm a
He stopped in front of them and  slipped his hands into his back pockets. When he smiled it didn't quite meet his eyes.
Steve was setting his phone away; there was no doubt in Tony's mind Steve had probably just ordered several hundred dollars' worth of food.
Judy rolled her eyes a little.  She had been going over some legal do's and don'ts with Steve in between letting counselors and volunteers ask for his autograph.
Yes, Steve, tweeting is the bird thing.  God, I hope ownmega starts trending, that's a great hashtag."
"If there's cameras everywhere, where do we mate?" asked Bucky.  He didn't like Steve's constant fretting about cameras. It was making him uneasy.
than enough," snarled Tony.  "Do we have to do this here?  Can't we go back to my place?  ...I think I only tore apart one room.  ...I'm not working without alcohol and maybe a pizza.  Barton, order me a pizza."
Hammer had begged for a spot.  Hammer had been trying to reverse-engineer Tony's suit designs.  Hammer would do anything to upstage Tony, especially at his own expo.
Tony choked on an ice cube and Boswell leaned over to slap him on the back.
"Oh, I see..." Steve hummed, feigning seriousness. His blue eyes were bright with mischief, something swimming beneath the surface. He was never usually his confident, not in a sexual sense anyway. But the endorphins from his final sprint were still pulsing through his system. He rested his hands either side of Tony's hips on the desk, not glancing down at his arousal almost pointedly.
can go to his
Actually, that had all been addressed in Frond's book.  They were evolutionarily designed to be fucked, to get pregnant, to have babies.  When they were in heat, they wanted one thing, and that was completely natural. Tony shoved the thought aside; he hated how Frond managed to make such a convincing argument for treating them like shit.
with them?
Someone pushed another glass into Steve's hand; a small group had begun half-chanting, half-singing "fuck 'em!"
Tony sat up with Steve and wrapped his legs around the other's waist, kissing him languidly.  He wanted to forget the bunker for a while. Forget Lab 9, forget that omega that seemed to flick in and out of existence, forget the men both he and Steve had killed.
Tony surfaced from sleep only partially, vaguely aware that Steve was sitting up, pulling away from him.  He grunted with displeasure and squeezed Steve's waist.
.  (The man was an Alpha and Steve found it comical that, since he'd come out about his status, people were constantly offering to help him with things.  As if being an omega negated his super soldier strength.)
"I grew a beard," he said.
.  I've only had four heats before," admitted Piper quietly, her pale skin flushing even deeper.  "I guess I was a late bloomer... heh. I, um, I had one with Eric before though but we didn't, um, I didn't get, y'know."  She looked down, fiddling uncomfortably with all the little bracelets on her wrist.
, was Jarvis, on the very edge, almost off-camera, his attention directed not toward the camera at all but toward a fussing bundle in his arms.
?  I can't take it off.  It's locking, you see."
Maria handed Tony a magazine.  On the glossy cover was a picture of Tony kneeling in front of Steve, putting the band on his finger.  Tony flipped it open. "
When JARVIS said it was working, the words didn't quite sink in. Steve blinked dumbly, a strange yet warm sensation clouding his chest. He swallowed thickly. Tony was going to be okay. He was okay. He wasn't dying. He was....
...maybe it was because Steve was old fashioned. Especially an omega, in the forties, wouldn't sleep with anyone but his Alpha.  Not ever. Or at least, he
Tony was torn between going after the guy and helping Steve.  He couldn't leave Steve alone, could he? Steve was vulnerable like this.  He only needed to bump into one Alpha guard and...
Tony looked over at Steve excitedly.  "What'd you think?"
"Rhonda Marlin,
The evening was a quiet, gentle one, one that Tony hadn't realized he needed.  There was a string quartet and a massive ice sculpture, all the trappings of a life Tony had been used to before Afghanistan, before Iron Man, before SHIELD and Steve.
"Okay... okay, you look okay..." murmured Tony quietly.  Steve had leaned his head on Tony's shoulder, an awkward position for him, considering their heights.  Tony reached up to stroke the back of his neck.
Tony groaned, turning back toward the stairs.  "I'm still gonna wear my chucks!" he yelled down at Pepper.
Steve glanced over at Tony. "Are you at least going to arm us?"
He was torn between feeling excited about the possibility of a threesome with a gorgeous redhead and threatened by a more dominant Alpha hitting on Steve.  He would have been panicking more but he'd popped some molly, and was feeling extremely good. He couldn't really remember why he'd felt bad earlier because so far this was a great party, and also, Steve was drunk, something Tony had never witnessed before and was fascinated by.
"I put a new core in.  It's a new element I kind of just made up just now, no biggie.  Is it working?"
sure what had gotten into him, but he didn't really care.  He needed to get some energy out and as he settled into the seat of his car, he felt much calmer than he had inside, facing off with Hammer.  He checked the gauges and sighed contentedly.  Here in the car, he felt at home.  He didn't feel sick at all.  The seat was comfortable and low to the ground and inside the helmet he felt not unlike he did when he was Iron Man.  Hell, he felt more comfortable here than he ever had inside.  He revved the engine experimentally, enjoying the sense of power it gave him.  For some reason, he hoped his PA, the omega, was watching.
If Steve hadn't been so stuck in his own head he might have noticed something was a little off with Tony. But right now his thoughts were racing at a lightning speed and he felt sick. Steve's hands shook but calmed a little at Tony's touch again.
Combined with his natural ability to fake confidence, Tony was breezing through every test easily.
"I admire your use of puns but strongly dislike your blatant copying of my suit design.  Flying robot suits are my
"We're not all big like you.  No omega is," said Ten softly.  "I want an Alpha to protect me. I don't want to get attacked every time I go into heat."  More were nodding.
Wanda looked sympathetic; she reached out and put a hand on his knee.  "Later, James. I need a nap. It's exhausting to be in someone else's mind and to control their thoughts.  But listen. The bond is there. Someday you'll be able to do it yourself, if you try hard enough."
"We're really gonna do this, aren't we?" he whispered.
"Hey!  Judy said not to--" began Tony, but his voice died on his lips.
.  His mind was blissfully empty and he was completely, utterly focused on the slight movements of the steering wheel, twisting around curves, avoiding other cars, the only sound the buzzing roar of engines.  This had been a good decision.  A
Steve sighed in relief as he stepped into their suite. No DeSoto. No anyone. It was bliss. He stole some toast that was leftover from the morning and then moved to take off his collar as he swallowed a piece whole. He was beginning to doubt the auctionees would walk out...he was asking too much of them. It was too big of a risk. Steve wasn't just asking them to be brave; he was asking them to be reckless and risk a lot. And he felt kind of awful about that. Steve really had no right to do that.
Steve, gentleman that he was, quickly closed the door. He was bright red. Also (he would
He leaned forward and nosed the back of Steve's neck, then reached up to trace his mark.  Steve shivered a little; Tony paused, his finger still on the outline of the scar, then traced Bucky's, too.  Another Alpha's mark on his omega was grotesque, but it was a part of Steve as much as anything else was. And Tony had grown used to it, the same way he'd gotten used to Ty's weird smell or the way Pepper always got up infuriatingly early even on weekends.
"I had him," Tony growled at Steve.  "I didn't need your help, Steve, I
Steve bowed his head in respect and murmured softly under his breath. "
"Vanko..."
Then he was cut off my Malick approaching. Typical.
"Weren't you going to get coffee?" he asked.
Gleason was getting out more wipes from his bag, presumably to clean Steve up down there. "How does it feel?" he asked as he pulled on a new set of gloves.
He spotted a male omega dressed up in hotel uniform and managed to get him to take his jacket to go up to their room.
"I wanna burn these clothes," said Tony.  In the airy hotel room, he swore he could smell smoke and blood.
He felt like he was sleep-walking.  Maybe he was in shock.
"Please.  He's my mate.  I gotta stay with him. He needs me," pleaded Tony.  Even though he'd let go of Steve, he was still hovering so close that the nurses were having difficulty irrigating Steve's hand.  The suit was bulky and unyielding but Tony felt like it was literally holding him together.  He knew it was dirty and damaged but without it he couldn't protect Steve and even though Steve had been protesting the entire time Tony had been clinging to him, Tony was half-convinced he was on death's door.  "
.  He felt it in a place he rarely had access to.  Steve made him feel...
"...hey, Eric.  Any idea where Suite B is?  I wanna check out that, uhh... that workshop on how to properly mate an omega."
"I'm outside, on the PCH, pretending to be bird watching.  A couple of kids just hopped the fence."
"We're taking the kids now. Please step away ma'am," Judy said, hands on her hips.
He pushed a bowl of pasta towards Tony. It was bacon and cheese and leek. He'd already eaten himself.
They came back from England with Steve holding the heavy metal briefcase under his arm.  Nick Fury and Maria Hill were waiting for them at the airport.
"Yep," Tiberius said. He turned on his heel and walked out.
"He doesn't want you," Steve snapped. The childish part of him wanted to ask
"Steve!" exclaimed Banksy with delight.  "Have you looked at the news? Project 84 is
It was like Steve was some kind of puppy that had been brought along for shits and giggles.
"Nope," Agent May said and walked behind Tony so Steve could see her face as they headed to the exit. Pepper went out first, slipping through the gap in the pillars Steve had made earlier. "You do need to go to the hospital, though, for the record."
"Mostly," Steve repeated, sounding tired. Tony had only come downstairs twenty minutes ago. How much could a man drink in twenty minutes?
"Why?"
The soldier stared blankly at him.  He clearly did not comprehend the story fully.
"You also offered the children two million dollars so they could pay off their debts," Brennan added. "You think the Alphas from the conference won't eventually find out?"
"...I don't see how asking for a Happy Meal--" began Tony defensively.
"You called us.  We came. Surely you're happy with the way this has all turned out?" said Karpov.  "It's what you wanted. To assume your rightful place in the world, as an omega." He gave Steve a vicious little grin.
Steve lifted his hand to answer. "Hey, it's-"
The rest of the day passed easily, like a weight had been lifted off their shoulders. An important conversation had been had. To say thanks, Steve ordered a chocolate hamper to Clint's house for the kids. Steve practically had his scripts nailed by the end of the day. He'd always had a decent memory. It wasn't memorizing that was the problem so much as the delivery of it.
"Steve, I miss you... I wanna go home, I miss Brooklyn... Stevie... my Stevie..." he mumbled.
"You asked me to organize an Expo in your name, you showed up late and hung-over to the opening ceremonies, you've been gone
"Mmmm... good boy... so juicy..." teased Tony.  Steve was arching, whimpering almost continuously, and a quick, lazy glance up showed Tony what he would have known without looking; Steve was rock-hard, his cock weeping precum, and his hips kept twitching, seeking either something to go inside him or something to put himself inside of.
"...Hammer's trial.  The total lack of consequences following that stint in Malibu back in May.  The fact you're getting
There was a sudden loud thump and Wanda dropped to the floor.  Gleason stood behind her, his briefcase aloft. "Oh my goodness... you really are one of my more high-maintenance patients," he said to Steve, peering down at Wanda through his glasses.
Steve purred at the praise as he tilted his head into Tony's touch, mouth sinking down further onto his fingers in the process. He was barely coherent enough to speak now anyway and it felt good to have something in his mouth.
Gleason ran a hand over his face. "Well he wasn't 'fine.' It looks like he was... with some rather unkind people. There's bruising on his neck and his sides. There's especially dark fingerprint marks on his left thigh. They must be very painful. We did a rape kit, but it looks like it'll come back clean.  So there's nothing we can do there...if he thinks anything wrong has been done to him, he's not saying anything about it. Or even admitting it to himself. It might be easier this way.  Nothing broken, no permanent damage done.  So at least there's that."
He let Tony tuck his head under Steve's chin as he kept murmuring to him and promising to him that it was okay. "We're both here. We're both okay. I'm not going anywhere Tony. I'm staying."
A small shadow shuffled up to the edge of their tent. A small hand grabbed the edge of the flap. "Ew."
"She and Ana are down at the stables, sir.  I don't think they expected you up for another few hours.  I imagine she'll be back shortly."
"I'm in such deep shit, my eyes are brown," said Tony, feeling miserable.  Hopefully, Pepper was calling his lawyers; hopefully, SHIELD would be merciful (fat chance); hopefully-
He reached out for Tony's hand, their fingers brushing together. "Do you actually want to eat out--" His blush darkened. "--like, for real.  Whatever you want," Steve said softly, running his fingers along the inside of his wrist. "I mean it Tony."
In Steve's absence, Tony had finally given in to all of his worst habits.  Since his capture, Tony's relationships had been short and especially fractured, and Steve could now say with some certainty that that was a deliberate attempt on Tony's part.  Tony had no interest in letting anyone get close to him, which, considering Stane's betrayal, was perfectly understandable. Bonding Steve had created a vulnerability as constant and as obvious as the glowing reactor set into the middle of his chest; when things had gone south, Tony had collapsed in on himself, unable to cope with it.
Tony wrapped his arms around Steve, setting his chin on Steve's head and closing his eyes.
"Happy, even a stopped clock is right twice a day.  They say everyone's a closeted omega. They got a couple right but that's like shooting an automatic rifle randomly into a forest, getting a deer, and saying you're a great hunter.  I'm telling you, those rags are
That was until he saw the Mark 6 still in the room, looming almost ominously. It was kind of unnerving and humbling at the same time...to have something stronger than him in the same place. Steve noticed Tony noticing his staring at it and walked back towards the bed. The bruises it had left had faded (super serum perks, and they hadn't been that bad, anyway) but Steve could still remember how cold and strong those metal fingers had felt.
Maybe the anxiety wasn't his.  Maybe it was Steve's.  Steve looked genuinely worried and also a little incredulous that modern pregnancy tests worked.  Tony stroked his thumb on Steve's shoulder, waiting with him.
The thought sobered him enough that he was able to let Pepper drag him away before the press attacked them, but the moment they were in the car, Tony felt like someone had punched him in the head all over again.  The thing is, it wasn't a bad feeling.  Tony suddenly felt sharp, alert.  His heart was pounding; his head was swimming.
"Stan?  Did you... I gotta know... did you shack up with anyone?  While you were in heat?" asked Tony.  "...is that an Alpha?  ...you just went home, right?  You're one of those strong, progressive omegas who doesn't have an Alpha, right?  ...right?  ...Stan, who is that?"
"You know, going down to the Y."
Fury was standing there glaring at them, car keys in one hand.  "Don't make me turn a hose on you," he warned.
But Tony was grounding. He dragged Steve back to reality.  He was kissing Steve's shoulder blade.
Steve reached up, fingers brushing the rim of the arc reactor beneath his mate's shirt. "Are you okay, Tony?" he whispered.
Steve raised an eyebrow.  Tony was suddenly acting weird. He'd gone from teasing Steve in the shower to telling them they...didn't have to have sex? This was confusing. He wasn't sure what Tony really wanted. "Hey," he said softly and turned to face Tony, letting their naked legs tangled together comfortably. "What are you thinking about; I can practically see the cogs turning in there," he tried to joke with a half smile as he reached up to push Tony's damp hair from his forehead.
He took a few steps back, wanting to find its source, but it was gone.  He took a few steps forward, turned, cocked his head.  Nothing.  He took a step to the side.  Had he imagined it?
and he disliked the idea of Steve's image being plastered all over town.  Also, it was more of the "strong, independent" omega message... the one that didn't leave much room for Tony.
to do this.
A single boy was lying on one of four cots; he started awake, eyes wide.  "
Steve was still on the phone, and Emily had been taught it was rude to interrupt people on the phone, so she went back to the tent to sit in the dirt beside Tony.
Steve frowned. "What?"
