“No. You didn’t. You think you did, because HYDRA’s messed with your perception of what’s real and what’s not. It’s mixing you up, giving you false memories. You’re still coming off whatever it was they pumped you with.”
“No, there is absolutely no way to defend this,” Steve waved a hand incredulously across the room, looking at Tony as he stood, clad only in a pair of black boxers and covered in splotches of various colors of neon paint, “I have been staring at you for ten seconds now, which is a lot of time to try and think of some explanation, and I really haven’t found one.”
Tony looked at her, but her eyes didn’t waver. It was him who broke the contact, instead turning to Bucky as he cleared his throat. “I’d, uh- probably be dead,” he admitted quietly, earnestly, “you were the one who tracked me down, remember? Told Steve where to go find me. Then you spent… you spent so much time working on a way to fix up my head, reverse what HYDRA had done. You gave me hope, Tony. That…” Bucky shook his head and looked away, “that was something I hadn’t felt in a long, long time.”
It was like every nightmare he’d ever had, rolled into one sickening reality. He knew that it had been a trap; the whole mission had been a set-up, designed to get him over to where they could take him captive and… and ‘rewire’ him, as they’d called it. He knew that he’d had moments, flashes, afterwards, where he’d been coherent. Where he’d been aware. He’d seen the piles of bodies at his feet, remembered the sound of a neck breaking under his hands.
“And your dad… that was just what he did. That was… he was something I couldn’t solve. Unpredictable and impulsive and a real goddamn idiot sometimes, but I learnt how to see the good sides of it, rather than searching so hard for the bad. It started being less like water and oil and more like a well-fitted machine. We were still totally different people, with totally different upbringings and outlooks- but we
“I know you can.” Rhodey’s hand gripped his again. “But you’re hurt, okay? Just let us take care of you. You gotta stay safe until help arrives, and any movement could risk opening up the injury. You know how high the chance of infection is after cauterisation.” Rhodey’s face was solemn, and he shook his head. “Right now, our main priority is keeping you alive. So lie back and take a break, alright?”
Tony paused for a moment, watching Steve work. “Uh, it’s sort of… complicated. His brother, Loki, had been missing for a few days, and I ended up picking him up at some rave downtown. Kinda messy, that one. Thor- Thor didn’t come into our circle because he liked the lifestyle, really; he came in because he needed a way to look out for his brother. But- y’know- once you’re in…” Tony shrugged a bit clearing his throat, “it’s, uh- a difficult system to get out of.”
“I missed you,” Steve blurted, unsure where he was going with it exactly, but knowing that he needed to get Tony to believe Steve was still invested in him. Which he
There was a cool hand resting over his, and Steve looked down at it, noting how it moved, how it was attached to the rest of Bucky’s body- real and living and breathing.
Steve heard Tony exhale ever so slightly, and felt with amusement as his pulse suddenly spiked. Neither of them said anything, but Tony shifted a little after a few moments; shuffling closer until his body pressed against Steve’s.
He wanted to be sick. What the hell must Steve think of him? He’d been bigging it up for the whole fucking month. Then he’d gone and said all that, like
Steve had been the first to hear it. Sat in Tony’s workshop in the compound, drawing like he always had and pretending everything was normal, he’d suddenly realised that there was the faintest little beeping noise coming from somewhere around Tony’ desk. FRIDAY was still online, but she no longer operated any of the equipment in Tony’s workshop, so Steve assumed something must have started malfunctioning. He looked up and waited for the beeping to stop.
The Avengers were a bit of a hit-or-miss when it came to children. Natasha and Thor were, generally speaking, hopeless at them, and always ended up saying things they shouldn’t in front of small people. Bruce could be okay sometimes, but only if he knew that the kids weren’t afraid of him (which they rarely were, even if he was Hulk they’d still love him). Clint was great; he just told them jokes and did magic tricks and they tended to fall in love.
“Mm, Barnes indeed” Steve turned back around and thrust a bowl of popcorn into Tony’s chest, “he’s calling it Bertha,” he said sadly, “and he made me apologise to it. I think I’ve been traumatised.”
he breathed disbelievingly, “this is… this is so fucking cool. I can’t believe I got to marry you! How did I do that?” He asked, “God, I’m so fuckin’ lucky. Oh, hey- let’s have sex!”
The classroom was loud and everyone ignored him and you know what, Steve liked that just fucking fine.
“What’s your fucking name?” Tony jammed a finger at him violently before pointing upward, “I’ve got a lawyer upstairs, his name’s Ray Wallace- look him up, because he’s going to make sure you go down for assisting in an unlawful kidnapping, buddy—”
When he’d managed to take out all his pent-up frustrations on the bag in front of him, he quickly took a shower and then slipped back downstairs, going over to the couch and picking up his sketchbook. He’d draw for a little while, then try find Tony again, have another discussion – this one hopefully a little calmer.
She didn’t move, and he felt the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end. He didn’t like people not listening to him in his workshop.
In response, Peter drooled a little bit, and Thor wiped it away with an absent finger. “Perhaps we can save the lessons for after mealtime?” He asked, leaning over and shoving Clint’s face away promptly. That made Peter cackle, and a chewed-up piece of chicken fell out of his mouth and onto the high-chair below.
. The team had to spend a good ten minutes cleaning everything out while Tony just waited miserably in the corridor, thinking over everything he was going to have to stop doing for a while. He couldn’t tinker on the armour, he didn’t even know how it worked any more. He couldn’t respond to calls or visit hospitals in the suit, not until he actually worked out how to pilot it again. Couldn’t train with Thor or go over routines with Steve.
The door pushed open with a small creaking sound, but Tony didn’t turn to look at him as he stepped in. The room was too quiet; the lack of sound like an oppressive shroud. Steve felt as if he couldn’t breathe through it. He stepped a few more paces further into the room, and still Tony didn’t look at him. He knew he had to say something, but he wasn’t sure what. What the hell could make any of this palatable? Steve had been talking out of his ass when he’d told Rumlow that Tony might be more open to conversing with Steve. Tony would hate him now. Viscerally. And Steve couldn’t even blame him.
Steve was shaking. He was shaking and his eyes were wet, and he looked up at Tony, ashen and exhausted. “I think we need to break up,” he said softly.
“No one is grooming anyone into geniuses,” Natasha cut in firmly, her face a little pinched as she added “he might not even
Steve looked up to the sky each night and waited for Tony to come home. He knew he was up there, somewhere. He’d gone up in that ship, and he would come back. Steve was sure of it. This was the only bit of hope he had left now, and he couldn’t let go of it.
He stopped half-way down the stairs and made a face to no one in particular. He really just wanted to get home and curl up in bed, honestly- maybe with ice cream. And facing Tony after what had happened earlier was just… no.
Steve glared at him. “I’ve been getting into fights with fuckers like you long before I met Tony,” he said, raising his fists as Ty snarled, “you’re nothing special, Stone- no matter what you might think, all you are is another entitled asshole. And Tony is fucking
The dull, droning voice of his teacher went through one ear and out the other as Steve stared blankly out of the window into the corridor and tried willing himself to focus. Monday mornings were a terrible invention; the person with that idea really should have thought that through before they’d gone and decided on it.
“Yeah,” Rhodey breathed out a big sigh, “yeah, I think… listen, I don’t wanna start making random diagnoses here, and I’m not a trained professional, but Tony hasn’t been to see one of those in years, and this is- it looks like it. It always has, to me. My dad, he, uh, he served. Sometimes the same things would happen to him.”
“Thank you,” was all Tony said, soft and earnest, nose brushing with Steve’s as he looked up, “you’re the best.”
Clint scoffed, turning to Steve, who was stood cooking eggs on the stove. “Cap, you can vouch for me here, right? I am the master at hide and seek. No one beats me at hide and seek.”
Shuffling with a sleepy grunt, he shifted his head and then laid it back on the pillow so he was facing the other way.
Eventually, a teacher yelled at them from across the cafeteria and Thor dropped Tony again, face sullen. Tony shot him a particularly scathing look, hitting him once in the arm before turning back around to Steve. “As I was saying, I hate Thor. He’s a terrible person.”
“I know it’s just you,” Tony snapped, “you just told me you were going to touch me, Einstein- you losing your memory in your old age or something? Jesus.”
"We don't have a cot," Steve said, fingers flexing against his side before lifting, just a little, as if he wanted to touch the kid. But a second later he thought better of it, and then let his hand drop again.
Well. Steve refused to saw ‘awed’. It wasn’t awe, obviously. He really wasn’t- he wasn’t good enough to inspire that sort of reaction.
Luckily, Tony’s face was obscured by Steve’s chest, so no one saw the way his cheeks warmed up and his eyes pricked. Family. He’d always thought he was the only one who’d considered the Avengers that way- but here Steve was, saying it was reciprocated. Tony wasn’t used to people caring about him like that. Not even his real family had done that before. This was new, and scary, and-
Well. That certainly didn’t bode well. If Clint or Tony or Steve or Natasha or Bruce or Thor didn’t call them, then it begged one rather obvious question: Who the fuck did?
been rather disastrous. “You know, sometimes I get confused about why people tell me you’re a handful, and then I remember Italy and I think ‘oh yeah,
“What’s he got?” Natasha asked, cocking her head over to Steve. The man just shrugged, a little bewildered.
“It was me, wasn’t it,” Steve whispered, mouth falling open in horror. “When I… when I grabbed you. I made them.”
were different. Steve wasn’t abusing him. He was just.... stress relieving. On Tony’s face. Yeah. Anyway- Tony had seen what Steve did to the
All he could think of was how pale Tony had been. Bruce said he’d lost a lot of blood; that he’d been in and out of consciousness over the last few hours, but he didn’t seem to be coming out of this last bout of sleep this time. His body was weakening, fighting a dozen different problems at once. But it was going to be fine. Tony would be fine, help would arrive, and then Steve could finally do what he’d been meaning to do for months and just ask the man on a date. He’d been so cowardly about it; hoping that Tony might move first, wondering if Tony even liked him at all—but now he could see it, clear as day. He should have done it months ago. Should have done it as soon as he felt it.
Against his better judgement, he found himself typing a message back. He kept it short—again, there were now other, more pressing things on his mind. A simple
Tony’s eyes fell shut to the sensation of Steve’s fingers moving delicately across his skin, and he sighed contentedly. “Wanna know something?” He asked, lips curling as he smiled.
“Ugh,” Tony whined, but let his cheek sag against Steve’s shoulder in defeat. In all fairness, he was pretty exhausted.
He kissed her forehead and then tossed a tub of icecream her way, which she plucked from the air easily. "It comes with the territory," he admitted with a shrug.
“Yeah, well,” Steve leaned down to kiss him again, a familiar press of lips, “then I remembered you needed to sleep.” His hands settled, firm and big against Tony’s hips, and he squeezed gently before beginning to unbutton Tony’s shirt. “Don’t get excited, just givin’ ya a hand.”
Tony jerked to a stop, eyes sliding away from Steve’s. He clearly had been trying to think about anything other than that. “Yeah,” was all he said, voice a little too rough to be casual. He stood at Steve’s side, med-kit in hand, and looked down at him, face creased in concern. “So, you fancy telling me what the fuck is going on?”
“What did I tell you about every man for himself, Tony? He knows our position now, we’re gonna have to move-”
Steve stared at him through the glass window and thought of all the time they’d missed out on. It’d been two years. Two years without Tony by his side, but here he was now, offering. Even if it wasn’t going to go back to normal. Even if they couldn’t ever get that part back. Steve would take this. So he nodded and stepped through the door.
“Group hug!” The God yelled, and Steve was laughing, tears still in his eyes as he rolled Tony into his arms and leaned over him, making sure he wasn’t crushed as four other superheroes launched themselves on top of them, whooping and yelling and (In Clint’s case, anyway) removing their shirts to swing them like lassos.
,” he groused, but he raised his hand and pressed it over Steve’s as he said it and then turned into him so that they were chest to chest. When he leaned up to kiss Steve, his mouth tasted like toothpaste. “Go back to bed,” his voice vibrated against Steve’s mouth, soft and low, and when Steve pulled back Tony was staring up at him with stars in his eyes and a smile dancing over his face. He was so goddamn perfect.
His heart twisted and it hurt in his chest. A billion thoughts shot through his head, each one of them carefully analysed. Something got stuck in his throat, and he swallowed it down as he looked away. “I don’t think he’d want me to,” he mumbled. Why the fuck would he? Steve had nearly killed him. He’d nearly… fuck, fuck, thinking about it made him want to throw up, to scream, to tear his own fucking hair out and lock himself away.
Steve chuckled again, and then he finally sat back, pulling Tony a little higher onto his chest so that the top of his head was resting under Steve’s chin. They both leaned back; heads once more titling to the stars above them, and admiring the strange contrast their peace and tranquillity brought to the still-bustling streets below them.
“We'd like to make a few things known about Tony,” Pepper answered swiftly, no hesitation in her voice as she looked down at him. Rhodey nodded, face turning more serious again as he stepped back a little.
“Hi,” Tony said, a little out of breath as he leaned against the frame of the door. He didn’t look too great himself, which made Steve feel a little better. There were black smudges across his white shirt, and his hair was even wilder than usual. “So, I’m gonna start with the fact that I’m really sorry.”
“Well I’ve got a double period of it, so the next hour’s gonna be fun too,” he mumbled, rubbing his eye and then sighing dramatically, “how much do you think Mr. and Mrs. Wilson will disapprove if I just say fuck it and drop out?”
He and Bruce both stared at one another for a second. Then Steve made a strangled noise in the back of his throat and let the gun fall limply at his side. He rushed forward. “Tony.”
Tony paused his work, turning to look at Steve with a dead expression on his face. “Never say those words to me again.”
“Don’t panic, it’s okay,” the warm baritone spoke closely to him again, and a hand fell over his shoulder once more, “I just got you some water. Would you like it?”
He hadn’t done much else other than think and stare at the wall while people had come into his cell and asked him questions, taken samples and monitored his brain for changes. Bruce had told him that the transmission had been severed after the ‘Cognitive Recallibration’ Thor had given him with his hammer, but they needed to make sure. For Tony’s sake. So Steve stayed put, didn’t even move off his bed, and let himself go over everything that he had done over the past few months.
Smiling to himself, he shoved Sam off and sat up, brushing down the mess his hair had become. “Is that someone’s phone?” He asked everyone, hearing the vibrating noise.
Suddenly, his hands were shaking uncontrollably and he was terrified. Completely, totally terrified. Tony would undoubtedly be calling to end things between them. It was the only logical step after this, and Steve understood, of course he did, if he were in Tony’s shoes he probably wouldn’t even do his partner the courtesy of a phone call. But Tony was a good person, so Tony would be calling ahead- letting him know that he tried, he did, but he just can’t date a weapon of mass destruction. It’s too risky. Steve got that, he was in full agreement that Tony deserved a million times more than what Steve had done to him, but-
Tony sighed, downing his coffee in one before slamming it onto the counter and checking his watch. Bruce had said he'd be up to begin the tests at eight. Clint could survive for an hour with a small child, right? Tony didn't need to worry. Hell, Tony would probably be more of a risk to Peter than Clint was. He wasn't exactly a figurehead of responsibility himself. "Look, I actually do have to get to work," he said, turning back around to face them and folding his arms. "Steve, make sure Clint doesn't try and feed him Cheetos and soda for breakfast. Clint, if you sing to him, he likes that. Or just unwrap some of the boxes in the hall and see if some of the toys can distract him. Bruce'll come down soon, and then we can find out if he really is yours." He rubbed a hand over his face and tried to untangle some of his curls with a wince. "I have to get ready. I'll see you all when I get back."
Why are you so Goddamn intent on trying to… to keep me safe, to look out for me? Why did you decide to talk to me? Why do you
Rhodey nodded. He glanced back to Tony. “Bruce has your back,” he said, leaning down and pressing a quick kiss to Tony’s overheated forehead. “It’s gonna be fine. Love ya, man.”
And then, without warning, Tony shot an extra twenty feet into the air. He yelled in surprise, unaware that he’d even been commanding the suit to do such a thing- maybe it was about body posture, except he still couldn’t fucking remember, shit, he was forty feet up now and counting, how the goddamn hell did he pilot this thing-
Did they even want him to be there, or had this just been pity? How many times must this have happened without him even noticing it? God- all of them, they actually had things in common with each other, didn’t they? They were soldiers and spies and actual heroes, most of them having come from nothing and worked their way up. They had a bond with each other, all of them. Natasha had Clint- the two were almost inseparable- and then Bucky, whom she shared an obvious history with and was clearly devoted to. Bucky had her and Steve- another pair with a lifelong history, inseparable, brothers in arms. They’d fought the war together. Steve had traversed the globe in an attempt to bring him home. And then there was Sam- he was close with pretty much all of them, bonding easily with shared experience of service, and was just a nice enough person to fit in snugly almost immediately. Then Thor and Bruce came as a pair too- the scientist and the God, both of them finding a strangely beautiful harmony in one another. As a unit, they all came together and just
get to put their hands on Tony in the foreseeable future, then that was just an added bonus, really.
He crouched onto his haunches and then pressed his fingers to his lips, before moving them down and letting them rest over his mom’s name. “Love you,” he murmured, “I’ll come back soon.”
Tony had essentially just bared his entire soul to him, and Steve had… no idea how to react to it. Part of him wanted to shake him senseless for thinking so lowly of himself, and the other half was having to be restrained from just launching himself at that idiot boy and kiss the smoke right out of his mouth.
Steve, baby, sweetheart, darling, honey-pie, could-bounce-a-quarter-off-that-ass-Rogers! Listen, my love; our friends are staging an intervention!” He called out delightedly, ignoring the shove he received from Clint in order to turn and run toward Steve, jumping theatrically into his husband’s arms.
“Whatever you say, Stark,” Steve rolled his eyes and felt Tony’s breath on his chest as he laughed. It was comforting, and after that they didn’t say much else, happy to drift off in one another’s space under the soft moonlight of Rural Ohio. Tony’s fingers trailed aimlessly up and down Steve’s arms, centring themselves on his hands after a while and linking them both together lazily. His eyes were closed, mostly asleep, but Steve watched the faded smile twitch on the other man’s mouth as his touch traced ever-so-softly across the base of Steve’s ring finger. He probably didn’t even know he was doing it.
All of them frowned. “Tony, I thought it was pretty obvious that you’re benched for now,” Natasha told him, and Tony blinked in shock, feeling the way those words ricocheted painfully around his brain.
A bird called out a morning song over in the trees to the side of him, and he smiled fondly. At least mom would be happy here. It was peaceful.
“What, no, I was the one who invited you,” Steve argued, batting Tony’s hand away before he could extend it forward, “this is my treat, alright?”
Tony just sighed. “I’m sorry I hurt you,” he said, which was probably all he’d heard before shutting off. Steve bit back on the urge to groan in despair- Tony was the king of self-blame, and no doubt he’d be feeling guilty about this for weeks to come.
“I-“ Steve started, before shaking his head and laughing incredulously, following Tony’s footsteps as they trailed around the outskirts of the huge brick wall that circled the perimeter. Tony was looking at the wall, searching for something- and he ended up ducking behind a massive bush at the end of the road in order to continue his scan of the brickwork.
Tony breathed out a sigh of relief and looked back down at the lifeless LMD in front of them. He swallowed down the guilt as he tugged the screwdriver back out and then rolled it over onto its stomach.
“Oh, baby,” he whispered sadly, knowing that Tony probably hadn’t slept well ever since steve had started acting like the world’s shittiest boyfriend, three weeks ago now.
“Shut up, we’re spooning now,” was the response he got, which, Steve could admit, was ridiculously endearing. Hearing Tony’s sleepy voice, muffled by Steve’s shoulder, tell him with a sulky tone that they were spooning and he needed to be quiet was far cuter than Steve would ever have thought possible.
Pulling out his phone, he saw the texts from Bucky and Peggy wishing him luck, and grinned despite himself. Moving away from Brooklyn and over to Manhattan had been hard- not being able to see both of his best friends whenever he wanted was even harder- but they were still there. And he was going back down to see them after school, so it wasn’t the end of the world. He could get through this.
He looked back down to his leg, remembering the first instance that they’d seen the geneticist’s cradle in action on Clint. He sat up and poked it gingerly, wincing when it touched the sensitive skin. “Ow,” he muttered, before poking it again, a little softer this time.
They raced down the hill, turning sharp around the corner and then slowing down, just so Tony could swerve near Zeke and stick his middle finger up as the boy waited by the bus stop at the foot of the hill. Steve looked back, watching Zeke yelling something unintelligible behind them, and laughed harder. He just wished there’d been a puddle to drive over.
He needed to find Natasha and yell at her. He was fast regretting the decision to introduce them to one another- God only knew what other terrible decisions they were going to make in future.
“Steve, look,” he said eventually, fanning out his hands and then curling them back in again, “I don’t want you to think you’re just another…”
Tony looked slowly around the room, hearing Clint stand up from the couch, having apparently sensed the growing tension around him. “Take Peter to your floor, Clint,” he ordered, pointing a finger, “now, quickly, before they get up here.”
They were both stood in Tony’s kitchen, and the stupid cookies Steve had tried to teach Tony how to bake were probably getting a little overdone by this point, but it felt like too much wasted time to bend down and turn the oven off- especially when Tony was right there, waiting for him with his beautiful mouth and ridiculous, gorgeous face. He was happy to let them go and mark them off as a lost cause- he had to prioritize, after all.
“I have him, he’s safe, and I will drop him off in twenty fucking minutes. They are all the Goddamn words you need, thanks.”
Tony had the good sense to duck away from the first right hook sent flying his way, but he missed the knee that rose up to meet him, and it clipped his ribs painfully. He tossed himself to the side and gasped. “50,000, J!” He yelled.
“That was not unwelcoming, oh my God,” Tony squeaked in mortification, dropping his head into his hands, “that was… that was ‘this can’t be real, in what universe is it possible that I am allowed to have this’. Not… never unwelcoming.”
“This is so weird, isn’t it?” Tony blurted, sniggering to himself as they arrived at the garage and then began walking over to his matte-black audi, made inconspicuous for Steve’s sake. “We’ve become the helicopter parents of a child we don’t even know.”
“Don’t be paranoid,” Clint said nonchalantly, and yeah, Tony was definitely skinning him, “just get over here and see for yourself! They were totally words, by the way, before you try and rebuke me.”
Tony just looked at him intently for a moment, before snapping out of whatever trance he was in and then blinking a few times. “I’m… oh, right, okay, yeah, shit-“ he shuffled hurriedly to the side, ignoring the protests from Clint and Sam in order to make room. His elbow caught on a drink as he moved clumsily and he swore, hands jerking out to pick it up. When Steve looked down at him curiously, the back of his neck had turned red again.
Of course, his heart promptly jumped all the way up to his throat when he saw Tony sat in his spot. It did that whenever he saw Tony anywhere, though, so he was fairly used to the feeling by that point.
Tony winced a little at the Bucky part, and inwardly Steve made note to try and make sure Bucky was on his best behaviour when they next saw eachother. Obviously Tony hadn’t quite warmed up to him yet- and Steve didn’t blame him. Bucky
Steve always felt so angry whenever Tony got hurt. He snarled and growled and made sure that anyone who laid a finger on him paid for it, always. HYDRA knew it. AIM knew it. Every villain on the face of the Earth was aware that when you hurt Tony Stark, you hurt Steve. And when that happened,
“Steeeve,” he started one night, while laying across the other boy’s lap and chewing on a bowl of popcorn, “can we put a horror movie on?”
Steve shut his eyes and nodded solemnly. “I apologize in advance. Now get down here and kiss me again.”
“Nah. You can’t make Thor look all sad right now. It just makes you feel like you’ve kicked a puppy.”
“Why can’t you just fucking clean up after yourself?” Steve snapped at him as he shoved the plates into the dishwasher and then shut it with a slam, “it’s literally so easy. Eat, finish, put away. That’s it, Tony, Jesus Christ-”
Steve looked up, and his eyes darkened as he bent down and kissed Tony, hot and hard and passionate. “’Cause you’re mine. Some of the guys, back in the day; they’d give their tags over to their girls. It was a promise. A part of them.”
Steve watched the space his body had occupied, mouth hanging open and blood dripping down his chin. This felt surreal. He’d… fuck, he’d barely even been awake three minutes ago, and now here he was, lying on the floor, confused and hurt and absolutely fucking furious.
So, mind made up and resolve temporarily strengthened, he said his brisk goodbye’s and marched out of the building, head bent low and teeth biting so hard into his lip that he could taste the copper coating his tongue. He didn’t stop. Didn’t think. Not until he’d gotten into his car and sped out, back to his tower. Clint rang him, leaving a voicemail to ask why he’d left so fast. Tony ignored it. He turned his phone on mute and then threw it violently into the back seat, leaving it behind as he pulled up into his drive fifteen minutes later. The tower felt cold to him, even though he knew it was temperature regulated. He wasn’t sure at what point he’d stopped calling it home.
Back in the bedroom, Steve’s morning alarm went off. It was five in the morning. Yesterday, Steve had been going on a run right about now, Tony grumbling about the early hour in the same way he did every single day.
“Ever since you met that boy, you’ve been getting into more trouble. You’re doing all this on his behalf, and what’s he doing for you exactly? Getting you suspended?”
It hurt. Tony tried to sleep through it, but the pain persisted deep under his chest and kept him awake, stewing, thinking and thinking and thinking.
He shuddered and closed his eyes as hot water sluiced over his shoulders. Tony was in their room, having pushed back the trip by a few days while they sorted all of this out, and Steve was taking a shower to get the grime of the police station off him. He’d remained there for a few hours, watching in on the interrogations with quiet intensity that he wished would burn through the mirrored glass, just so that Redford would squirm. He hadn’t ultimately been able to do much though, and so eventually he’d headed home, back to Tony, whom Happy had escorted back to the tower as soon as he’d arrived on the scene. Steve had made sure to do a proper examination of him once he’d dealt with Redford, but Tony genuinely hadn’t been touched. In fact, nothing had. Forensics hadn’t found a bullet embedded anywhere, so for whatever reason, Redford must have shot straight up in the sky.
Tony frowned for a moment, wondering whether that was a general question, but then he remembered that Peter had been in Thor’s room for the night, and so undoubtedly this strange trance-like state Thor was in now was a result of the trauma that one could only endure after dealing with a cranky baby for longer than three hours.
“You’re not allowed to drink, though, mister,” Clint flicked Steve on the nose and shook his head, “you’re too young.”
The last thing he saw before Bucky jumped out and shut the door behind him was his best friend’s reassuring smile.
Steve laughed, giving Tony a look filled with so much adoration that Tony didn’t quite know what to do with it all. He took a mental snapshot and stored it away for later, heartbeat increasing in his own ears as he felt Steve’s hands settle on the buttons of Tony’s own jeans, deftly undoing them while keeping his mouth fixed on Tony’s throat. He was an excellent multitasker—even better than Tony, thanks to his truly astounding coordination. Tony briefly thought about the sorts of things he could do with his hands, and then very quickly pushed it away. He was
Fury took one look at him, and the expression on his face, and he sighed deeply. “I think you and I need to have a talk,” he said, and then gestured for Steve to follow him back down the hall, away from Tony, away from all of it.
Steve narrowed his eyes and leaned forward. “Bucky Barnes, you better have a license to drive this bitch-“
They made out energetically against the door for at least ten seconds before Tony finally pulled back a little, pressing one last tiny kiss to Steve’s mouth as he went. “Good enough?” He asked, lip pulling upward in satisfaction.
Steve went with a fond sigh, mumbling under his breath until Clint thwacked him over the head and told him to savor the night, rather than grumble.
“You do that,” Steve stroked the hairs off Tony’s forehead, pressing a kiss there before hopping around to his side and getting comfy next to Tony. There was a rather ominous creaking noise, and Steve felt something snap underneath him, but he didn’t want to deal with that right now. Tony would fix it all in the morning. Hopefully.
, I suppose.” He felt his cheeks heat and pursed his lips. It sounded so childish when he said it aloud.
“Mmm, nice to see you too,” Steve murmured, looking up at him through his long blond eyelashes, stuck together from the bathwater. “Wanna join me?”
The older man nodded, and heavy silence fell once more. Steve wasn’t even sure where to begin, so he started with an apology. “Mr. Wilson, I am so sorry—”
"Hmmf," Steve let his cheek rest in his hand and speared another lettuce leaf. Phone removed, shitty History grade and food that tasted like ass. Yeah, he was in a bad mood, so sue him, "if you piss me off today I'm removing your shins."
It was stupid, really. He probably should have expected something like this to happen eventually, because he’d always sort of known it would. And it felt kind of stupid and overdramatic, saying it like that in his head- and maybe he was overreacting, maybe it had just been making a fuss over nothing- but Steve couldn't really think about it all that pragmatically in his head, not when he was like this. Not when he got upset.
He was fucking tired. What the fuck was it with people setting off fireworks a week in advance to the fucking celebration? It made no fucking sense and Steve was sick of coming back to himself after a minute of sheer panic and realizing he’d crawled under his fucking bed to stop the non-existent shrapnel burying itself in his skull-
As soon as he'd gone down and picked it up in the armor (because people left weird shit outside the doorsteps of the Avengers tower, and Tony always practiced health & safety in those instances), he'd called a meeting immediately, completely gobsmacked. Most of the team had been asleep, seeing as it was three in the morning. Tony himself had been getting ready to pack up and head to bed, curl into Steve and have his usual battle for a little bit of blanket that the goddamn supersoldier always loved to hog.
“JARVIS?” He said, gripping to the wall for support. His mind was offline, so he was not sure what force was compelling him just then, but whatever it was, it decided on a plan of action and stood him up straighter, forced his eyes into focus.
Eventually, he got to a point in the morning where he couldn’t stay any longer. He’d already missed first period, and he didn’t want to let Mr. Wilson down any further by not sticking to his promise. He was loathe to leave Tony’s side, but he didn’t have a choice.
Oh. That was… perfect, actually. “Yeah,” Steve said with another smile, “yeah, I’d like that. You might have to wait in your car for a bit though- I’m five minutes out myself, so you’ll probably get there before me anyway.”
And, for whatever reason, it seemed to do the trick. His lopsided lips and wonky teeth gave Steve the opportunity to breathe in deep and and then exhale, once, twice, three times- until he seemed to relax more against the pillows he was resting on.
He moved his hand, cupping it around Tony’s face and stroking his jaw as they both slowly drifted back into a sleep, this time wrapped up in one another’s arms; Steve clad in his baggy T-shirt and Tony with nothing but his boxers.
By that point in whatever lullaby it was that Steve was reciting, Peter had gone almost completely silent, his cries reducing to a few muffled whimpers that eventually faded into nothing at all, his eyes locked on with Steve as he sang. Tony could admit, he was doing much the same. Steve
Steve just sighed fondly, leaning his head back against the uncomfortable rest of his bus-seat. “That’s not how friendship works you know, Thor. It’s a two way street.”
Confused at first, he blinked his eyes open blearily, wincing at the bright blueish light that buzzed up on his phone. He sighed in irritation- someone was ringing him.
Of course, seeing that no fight was to be had, the people quickly began to disperse, most of them shooting curious glances at Steve as they went. He was still holding on to the material of Tony's jacket, pressed up pretty damn close in what had been his attempt at stopping the rampage. Although after the parting words he'd heard from the asshole, Steve was surprisingly ready to go a few rounds with him on his fucking own.
an annoying voice in his head chimed in helpfully, sounding rather like Peggy Carter. He scowled, and in his mind's eye, he could see the way Peggy would have been smiling at that particular nonverbal response, one eyebrow raised fondly as she said '
have been the product of a little too much alcohol and a stunning lack of inhibitions that did it in the end. In my defense- it seemed like a great idea last night.”
“I’m not Loki,” he said in response to his younger version’s declaration, but as he knew, the words fell onto deaf ears. Within three seconds they were fighting, and Steve had to hand it to his younger self, the guy sure was spritely. He got a good few hits in, and Steve found himself pinned into a chokehold by the other version, scrabbling at the floor as he tried to get out of the grip.
“Now you’ve really fucked it,” Tony told him quietly, looking up at the ceiling as Fury began to turn a shade of deep puce.
“He’s fine,” Bucky assured hurriedly, standing up with Steve, pushing against his chest, “but you’ve got to stay here for a bit, okay, you’re hurt-”
He shut his eyes and ended the call with a shaking finger, while Tony was mid-sentence talking about how he was grateful Steve had come to help, and that he’d trusted him.
The kid nodded enthusiastically. “Yeah- look, let me make it up. There’s a party at my friend’s tonight- a tonne of people are going. You should come. Starts at eight, down by The Revel, you know it? Anyway- invitation’s there. Just…” he bit his lip and looked around once more, before starting to back off again, “tell Tony we’re cool, yeah?”
“Hey, hey,” suddenly Rhodey looked concerned, and he stepped forward, arm going out to touch Steve’s shoulder gently, “he’s fine, what do you m- oh.
It didn’t, not really, not to the overprotective mess of anxiety that was making its home in his brain, but he didn’t really have much choice. So he agreed quietly and then ran a hand through his hair, leaning forward and bracing his elbows against his knees. He wanted to go over there and check up on Tony himself- something felt wrong, and Steve couldn’t put a finger on it, but he knew that it was there. It was probably just his anxiety, like he’d said before, and he knew that Tony was more than capable of looking after himself- he just worried anyway. Steve was very good at that.
Steve finally sat up then, spotting Tony standing in front of him, looking at himself in the full-length mirror and rubbing gently over the love-bites on his neck. He was indeed clad only in his boxers, and Steve cocked his head as he observed that ass without shame. It was a fucking great ass.
He forced his legs to work, running with Steve as the man raised his shield behind them and threw the two of them forward, just as an explosion ripped through the hall and a concentrated detonation hit the armor Tony had been standing in only seconds ago.
“I’d say it’s more difficult for you to keep up than it is for me,” Steve cocked his head and smiled a little, and Tony glanced up when he caught the look. His lip curled- not amused, as such, but maybe a little bit pleased.
But honestly, Tony, despite all his many issues, knew that Steve would. He couldn’t deny Steve’s love for him—not here, not now, when they were sat up in some uncomfortable fucking tree in Ohio where Steve had whisked him away in response to Tony’s earlier mental collapse.
JARVIS lifted him off the ground gently, the boots firing up. He’d locked the joints, which was good, otherwise his knees would have buckled under the force. God, he really had forgotten every single damn thing, huh?
Tony’s face fell a little and he looked away. Steve just frowned and kissed him again. “Yeah, I know,” he agreed with a small nod, “I do the same thing. Kinda.” There was a short pause before Tony’s face turned into one of intrigue, and Steve took that as the cue to continue. “Sometimes, when I’ve had a nightmare, the only thing that keeps me from falling apart is the sound of your heart. If I hold my breath and stay still, I can hear it. And it—it helps me go back to sleep again. Nothing calms me down faster than hearing the sound of you… just being alive, next to me,
Steve made a face. “You don’t even know me!” he spluttered, “you’re not… you don’t like me, don’t be ridiculous. You think I’m dorky and uncool.”
“I’m pretty sure there’s something coming,” Steve answered on autopilot, and then gasped in a mortified little breath as Tony looked up at him in delight. “Oh my God, I’m sorry, Bucky just does that all the time-“
Tony thought viciously as he grabbed a bolt from where it had almost rolled off the desk. Steve had boundaries and Tony hadn’t respected them. Steve had feelings, and Tony had hurt them. Tony didn’t blame him- he’d punch himself too, if he was in his own company for more than three minutes. The fact Steve had been doing it close to three years was incredible.
“Shirt,” Tony prompted when Steve did nothing, small smile dancing around his mouth, “I’m gonna need to actually see the injuries before I do anything with them.”
His fingers worked, all his focus entirely engaged on the man as he twirled and spun and worked his magic upon the room. Soon enough, there was another little sketch sat roughly in the corner of his sheet, and Steve smiled happily. The man really was perfect- his whole aura was something Steve felt as if he could physically latch onto and draw for days on end.
“I am the view,” Tony shrugged, dropping the box and the bottle in order to run his hands through Steve’s hair.
Everyone snorted, and Steve poked the LMD with his foot. “Guess that’s one way of putting it,” he said grimly, looking up at Tony. There was blood all over his face- another sort of terrifying aspect about the serum. He bled more rapidly than other people, thanks to the speed at which his blood cells reproduced. It tended to make him look half-dead every time he got a facial wound, which didn’t exactly soothe many of Tony’s worries. He was going to have to make sure that Steve iced that later on.
“Nice ego boost to know that I can help you even when I’m not conscious,” Tony said with a smile, but there was a note of genuine care to his tone, and Steve appreciated it. Tony’s fingers skirted up Steve’s chest, fiddling delicately with the buttons at his throat. “I love you so much, you know that, right?”
Steve just nodded, holding up his empty hand. “My mom’s ring. Gave it to me in her will,” he said numbly.
Which was quite possibly the furthest thing from the truth that anyone could possibly be, but that was just Tony for you.
Steve clamped a hand over his mouth before he could ramble further, smiling up at him. “Tony, I get it,” he said firmly, “it’s fine. Stop worrying."
Tony shrugged helplessly, shuffling the tiny thing around a fraction. "Someone left him at the door ten minutes ago," Tony said, keeping his voice quiet. He knew what babies sounded like when they screamed. He did not want that right now. "I tried to trace them, but they didn't pass any of my cameras. They just... dumped him and left."
“We’re gonna make Howard Stark pay for this,” Rhodey said, and Steve nodded vehemently, “it might take months, or years. But we’ll do it.”
He smiled into the pillow, rubbing his eye tiredly and yawning. He didn’t bother opening his eyes- still too tired for that. It took a long time for him to wake up properly in the mornings, and everyone knew his rule about consciousness before double digits. Plus, he knew Tony was awake next to him- he could feel the other boy tracing patterns into his back softly- and he didn’t want to disturb that. It felt nice.
Before he could do anything else, though- before he could cave, break under HYDRA's force and just give them what they wanted- he heard something. A distant whirring, steadily getting louder. Louder. Familiar.
Down the line, Natasha cursed. “Soon as I cut it, you know the protocol, Steve. The whole building gets put on lockdown and the holding cells are all checked.”
Loki sat down gingerly in the armchair, far away enough to still seem unattached to the situation, legs crossed casually. But he kept his eyes on Tony as he sipped at the water in his hand, and Steve did the same. He was due to be woken up again soon, although it had been a good few hours by that point, and he seemed stable enough. Didn’t mean Steve was going to let up, though. Not until he was certain.
“Tony,” Steve asked, raising an eyebrow and grabbing his shoulders between two hands, “what’s wrong?”
- he could see it burning orange, slightly unnatural through the polluted smog, but beautiful all the same. It was just beginning to sink to the West, the light wrapping around buildings and casting shadows into every corner.
“I hate you, Tony,” Clint said from behind them, and both he and Steve rolled their eye simultaneously as the archer trudged into the room, “I do not get up anywhere close to this time unless the world is ending. What the hell is the problem?”
How was he even supposed to begin? “I’m sorry,” he murmured, looking down, “it was a school bully. He was being fucking awful, to me and to other people. People I care about. I got angry.”
Steve practically whimpers the next time he breaks away, gently untangling Tony’s hands from his neck and shivering. “Uhh, uh. We can’t. You need… you need to get some rest, Tony, you’ve ha-
But Steve never wanted to leave this spot, right here in Tony’s arms. What was the point? He couldn’t think of anything worth leaving for.
“Ah, super secret genius stuff,” Bucky said with a sage nod, “fair enough. Go change the world, Tony. We’ll see you when we get back.”
They all nodded, satisfied with the arrangement. Tony informed JARVIS to switch from training protocols to normal fight-mode, and he saw Natasha swiftly shove a new mag into her gun. He looked to Steve, already suited and booted. “Ready?” He asked.
Steve nodded, tiny and broken, “Black out in the gym, sometimes, but not for long. Only been sick twice, yet. And hallucinations- Just the one, and it wasn’t for long- only Peggy, when Clint brought her up- but it’s nothing, okay, Tony,
Yeah, there it was. The kicker. He knew, of course, that the way he’d handled the entire thing had been pathetic. It just… it still felt like a stab in the chest to realise the others thought so too. That they knew there were a hundred things he could have done, but never did. He licked his lips and turned back around, ducking his head. On the first day, when he’d just woken up, the whole team had watched as he’d cried nonstop for fucking hours, but he hadn’t shed a tear since he’d found out what had really been going on, and he didn’t intend to start again now. Because it wasn’t worth crying about, not any more. Hell, it hadn’t been worth crying over to
Peter shrugged, wishing it didn’t feel as tense as it did. Why the hell did parents have to argue anyway? It was stupid. T
,” Thor muttered, before sighing and then getting down on his knees so Steve could slip off again. “Just wait until you want to do something against the rules-
God, he just had to stop pissing around and work on getting his head fixed. Removing the stupid cognitive block. He desperately needed Iron Man back, before he lost them all for good. Maybe it was in his head, but they just… they didn’t seem interested. If this bullshit carried on any longer he was going to start losing them for good. They were going to see him for what he really was: someone not worth having around. And if they’d already seen War Machine in action, then he barely stood a hope in hell even if he did manage to retrieve his memories of the suit. Rhodey was just… a better fit. It was clear from the way they all spoke of him; with such high regard and admiration in their voices.
The LMD advanced, but was tackled to the floor by Steve before he could get close to Tony. Natasha scrambled back upright too, aiming her bare foot at his head and slamming it down against the tiled floor. Steve’s face was twisted in pain from the awful high-pitched screaming that JARVIS was blasting, and the immense discomfort was enough to distract him just enough to let the LMD break free of his grip, headbutting Steve viciously. He hissed in pain, reeling back, and a second later the LMD grabbed Natasha’s ankle and squeezed. Tony heard bone break through the room.
“Steve,” Tony began, and when he dared to look back up again, he saw Tony was staring at him a little helplessly, shaking his head and reaching out for his wrist.
“Steve,” the familiar voice, with all of the inflections Steve had used to hear in the mornings when the world was easier and softer and Tony still cared about him, spoke up through the room again. The acidity in his tone was gone now, and Tony’s face broke out into a tired smile as he shut his eyes and side. “Oh, Steve. You stubborn, reckless, selfish asshole. I wish… well, for a lot of things. Mostly that we’d been together when this went down. Maybe it wouldn’t all have gone so wrong.” He sighed. “I’m sorry, for what it’s worth. I never gave you a chance to apologize, to even try and fix things. Too angry, I guess. Too bitter. But you know— well, I suppose you don’t, but—I, uh. I never stopped. Loving you, that is. Hell, there were plenty of times when I wished I could. Plenty of times when I hated your guts. But even then, I still… yeah. You’re still my sure thing, Rogers.” He glanced up and quirked his mouth upright, probably remembering every time when Steve had been the one to tell him that, arms wrapped around Tony’s midsection and holding him tight as they laughed together.
“But you’re just so pretty from the back, sweetheart,” he said, “can’t help myself.” To prove his point, he grabbed Steve’s ass and squeezed playfully, watching in amusement as he jolted and bit down on a small noise. He turned and shoved Tony lightly, waving to Peter.
“Why’s that bad?” Steve asked him desperately, wiping at a trickle of blood before it could get in Tony’s eye. Head wounds always look worse than they are, he told himself sternly, forcing himself to breathe. Tony couldn’t afford for Steve to lose his cool right now.
“WHY DID YOU LEAVE!” He shouted again, feet turning grass to mud as he slammed the sole of his shoe down on the earth, “WHY COULDN’T YOU JUST HAVE- could have-“
It caught him by surprise. He hadn’t been ready to hear such heart-clenching words. Bucky, Bucky, Bucky—it didn’t make sense, Loki shouldn’t even know about him, that had all been before his time on Earth, it couldn’t be tr—
Tony paused for a moment, eyes darting around the room—out to the window, where the rest of the world remained, sharp and harsh and unforgiving. Steve had checked that morning; everyone was still going nuts over the stupid video. If Tony went to work today, no doubt that would be all he’d get goddamn asked about. Steve didn’t want that for him—not ever, but especially not now. He deserved peace.
He jumped, hand curling quickly over the stupid napkin and covering the thing from view. He turned, looking up at Tony with a smile and a shake of his head. “Nothing, doesn’t matter-“
Behind them, Clint was huffing and complaining as he made his way back down, but he was completely ignored.
“Paul,” Steve leaned forward and leaned his head into his heads, shutting out the rapidly approaching migraine and just focusing on breathing, “please… please, can we just talk about this tomorrow? I know I let you down. I know. I can’t tell you how sorry I am for that, after everything you’ve done for me. But I… I can’t do this right now. Please.” He looked up, hating how weak his voice sounded, how he could hardly see through the wetness pooling in his eyes. “Just let me see Tony.”
“As soon as you stepped through that threshold and saw him, what was the first thing you did Steve?”
Tony’s stomach dropped in fear, and Steve took another step forward, slowly advancing with a shake of his head. “Oh really,” he said with a sneer, and Tony thought about calling the armour- but God, the armour was for
Looking back with an eyebrow raised in question, he watched as Bucky glared menacingly one last time at the jacket, before sighing a little. “And…I guess the jacket isn’t so bad, really,” he muttered, before turning around quickly and marching into the living room.
“You need’a stop checkin’ your watch every two minutes, buddy,” Bucky patted him on the arm heavily, halfway along the road to rip-roaring drunk as he sipped on one of the obnoxiously strong bottles of mead Thor had brought along and glared solemnly.
,” he told them with a huff, flipping his head and stroking the faded fabric of his favourite yellow and green scarf lovingly, “you just don’t know shit about style, any of you.”
“Yeah, I touch because I know what it is!” Tony snapped, “I have mechanisms in my suit that insulate me from currents and laser beams and death rays. You’re all… fleshy and exposed, Jeeze, Steve-“
Steve pulled his head up and spat at her feet. It was red with his blood. “Go fuck yourself, Nazi scum.”
you’re scared. You’re talking about running from home and leaving your whole life, everything you know, all semblance of stability behind in the dirt. If you weren’t scared, I’d be fucking terrified of you.”
“Tell me what happened in Gulmira,” Steve blurted, walking over to the desk and leaning his hands down against it. Had it been anyone else, it would have been a threatening pose, but Steve knew he just looked desperate. It was the one thing Tony had done that Steve couldn’t explain away, the one thing that seemed like truly senseless violence. “Tell me why Iron Man wiped that whole fucking town off the map and flew away a few hours later without a care in the fucking world.”
The smile on Tony’s face dimmed a little. “Good,” he said after a beat, looking away from Steve, “Keeps you on your toes, doesn’t it?”
At that, Thor did actually glance up at him with a small twitch of his lips. “Please don’t punch anyone,” he said firmly, “I don’t want any injuries, on your side or theirs. Plus Tony might kill me.”
, to try and make a conscious thought to plan ahead when you start off with those brazen ideas of yours, so that you have a little support with you in the aftermath of them. Otherwise… God, I don’t even want to think about what could happen.”
He had a feeling that over the course of the next few weeks, things were going to get pretty fucking difficult.
Visiting all the schools the next day was hard. Tony hadn’t ended up actually getting much sleep at all, and despite the fact he’d thoroughly taped his ribs, they still ached with every movement. He didn’t let on about it though, because he didn’t want to try and explain it away. Just bent down to greet all the little children and smiled at them through gritted teeth that he hoped were still non-threatening enough.
He’d met him at a bar on the rougher side of New York, just over three years ago now. Leaning over the counter and asking for a drink with a slick smile on his face- he’d been gaunt and thin and desperate, Steve knew the type. Later on, he’d find out that that had been the night Tony had run from his abusive partner (an abusive partner that now lay somewhere at the bottom of the Hudson, last time Steve checked), but in that night, all Tony had been to Steve was a man too vulnerable for a place like that.
“After your lesson, if you want,” Steve said, unable to hold back his foolish smile as Tony’s eyes widened in excitement.
“I really do have to go do a bit of work before I come to bed,” Tony told him with a pulled face, “I kind of left in a rush.”
Before Steve could even tell him he was never speaking to him again, Tony had scrambled to his feet and then pulled Steve up with him, hauling them higher up onto the roof. Steve just held tight to Tony’s hand and let him lead them up, until finally stopping on the peak of the roof, right next to the chimney. With an unceremonious thump, Tony flopped onto his butt and sat down comfortably. A second later, Steve followed.
There was silence in the office, as Steve sat straight and kept eye contact with Fury. His head was beginning to ache from where it’d hit the wall, and there were pains up and down his body. He must have been punched more times than he’d thought.
“Because the buses are cancelled thanks to the snow and Bucky’s going to be here in about five minutes, so we might as well just wait for him,” Natasha said, whilst her fingers zipped quickly along her phone. She was wearing a thin leather jacket and a lacy shirt, and yet was the only one of them who seemed unaffected by the cold. Because she was a witch. Steve was sure of it.
He scrolled down, coming to a picture of the Iron Man suit, and then winced in pain as the image sent something throbbing at the back of his head.
still die,” Richards pressed, shaking his head, “your past self is not you. He wouldn’t feel it. You’re two separate entities and
The fort withheld for another three minutes, until Bruce rugby-tackled Tony through the center and into the blanket-wall, bringing the whole contraption down on top of them all. There was a lot of screaming as they were all suddenly crushed by pillows and sheets, and Steve’s asthma meant he could hardly even breathe, but he was still laughing as he stuck his head up out of the mound and then untangled some sweet wrappers from his hair.
, of course, but just because he’d probably get into even more trouble when he laughed at their suggestion.
All this time, and it’d never been Loki who’d said those words to him. Never been Loki who’d catalysed Steve’s friendship with Tony Stark all those years ago, bringing them closer together in a way that would change his life forever.
Steve sighed, palming his forehead and shaking his head, holding off on a tiny smile. “Is this what it’s always like with you?”
These days, the Avengers weren’t called out to fight as often as they’d used to- there were more superhumans there to deal with the lower level stuff, and Avengers were usually an Emergency-Only call. Of course, that didn’t mean that their days were any less busy, of course. For some reason, the list of things to do never quite seemed to cease, and so Steve took special pleasure in finally closing the last file or throwing the last punch before he allowed himself to go and finally take a break back in the communal rooms. There’d usually be some sort of food lying around- the team ate at different times except for Sunday Dinner which they did as a unit, and so Steve, being one of the later workers, was usually left to pick at the remains. He didn’t really mind. That was the way he’d grown up, and Bruce sure knew how to knock up a good curry anyway.
Tony was, incidentally, sat three rows ahead of him; leaning back lazily on the chair as he twirled a pen effortlessly between agile fingers. He also hadn’t acknowledged Steve at all- same treatment that he’d been getting ever since he’d seen Tony last, crashing on his couch after the emotional breakdown.
With a gentle sigh, he turned on his heel and made his way back upstairs, Tony snoring gently behind him.
He heard Tony say something else, but he’d already turned and walked out of the door, shutting it gently behind him. He walked on, unsure of where he was headed- the hospital was quiet on these corridors, empty aside from the occasional nurse hurrying by. Steve kept going, face tight with the effort of holding everything back, and after ten seconds or so he broke off into a small run, hands extending and reaching out for the door of the men’s room at the end of the corridor. He pushed it open, too rough and too fast, because he felt the wood groan and splinter under his force. It made him jerk his hands away, stumbling into the bathroom and going backward until his back hit the cold tiles of the opposing wall. He looked on, horrified at the door.
Steve pulled away, just a fraction, and looked up at him. His eyelashes were stuck together with sleep, his hair still tangled and messy. He sighed, expression tainted with a tang of concern. But he didn’t push. “If you’re sure. Just call me at lunch-break, okay?”
“Is it because you felt sorry for me?” Steve asked quietly, “because you knew- you knew early on, you said it yourself. You could tell I wasn’t okay. Is that why?”
He watched Tony’s eyes open, staring at him so intensely, like the answer to the universe lay somewhere in his eyes. It was also such an immense feeling, when Tony looked at him like that.
“Asshole!” Tony made to shove him but Steve ducked away from the flying arm, snuggling in close to Tony’s back again and resting his chin on Tony’s shoulder.
But he knew, as soon as he heard those words from Rumlow’s mouth, that this was genuine. Footage that clear couldn’t be faked. Words that enunciated couldn’t be computer-generated.
The room was quiet when Tony managed to get in. Which was weird, because Steve would usually be in bed by that time in the night. He looked over to the clock- 3:15am. Definitely too late for Steve to still be awake. There was a sinking feeling in his gut as he looked up. “JARVIS, where’s Steve?”
make this... you don’t deserve that. Ever. You could be the most terrible, annoying person in the world and you still wouldn’t deserve to be hit by him. My mom told me that herself- I’ve seen what it leaves people with. I knew what my own dad did to her when he was alive. You… Tony, you never deserve that.”
The rest of dinner was spent talking about other subjects- mostly all the gossip Darcy had accumulated over the week, because apparently people cared about that sort of thing and she knew literally everything. Literally. Everything.
Both of them huffed in amusement, before settling down into a few moments of silence. Tony could still hear the heart-monitor on the other side of the room, confirming what Tony could hear under his own fingers. He knew that he wasn’t going to forget what had happened any time soon. Then again, there were a lot of things that he couldn’t forget. That was, unfortunately, just part of the package deal. Tony could live with it- at least it would only return in his dreams, and not reality.
Steve frowned, walking forward. “Thor, are you okay? You told me you don’t smoke unless you’re, y’know… sad. Or stressed.”
He stifled a yawn into his hand and then rubbed at his eyes, checking the clock on his desk. 2:29am. The rest of Stark Industries was completely shut by that point in the night, everyone else having long since drifted off home. But Tony was catching up on all the work that he’d been letting build up over the past month or two, and so he’d chosen to stay up and try make his way through the ever-large mountain of folders and files. It was boring work, but easy. Allowed his mind to focus on other things; blueprint designs and team plans and such. His hand scrawled out a signature that Pepper had circled for him, and then he moved onto the next form absently, paper shuffling under his hands. He’d opted against music that night thanks to the headache currently threatening to spill into a full-blown migraine, and so the office was strangely silent. Just the crackle of paper and the scratch of a pen, and then the occasional click-clack of fingers on a keyboard. Pepper said that she enjoyed silence like this, but Tony couldn’t fucking stand it. Made him antsy as hell, if he was being honest.
Bucky threw his hands in the air. “Steve, I hate to break it to you pal, but you’re a fuckin’ mess right now!” He yelled angrily. “You are vulnerable, whether you like it or not. You don’t have people looking out for you and then Stark’s coming along, makin’ you think he’s all that- and you saw him get on that bike after taking a massive drink of whatever the fuck- he’s not fucking safe and he’s not fucking good for you!”
“If you keep making friends with the popular kids, you’re gonna push us up the hierarchy without even meaning to, Rogers,” Clint kicked him again, and Steve jumped, swinging back around to level Clint with a glare.
There was a short silence, broken only by some awkward shuffling on Sam’s part. Bucky and Peggy seemed rather taken aback; shooting one another short looks of confusion.
Or not- based on the way both Tony and Thor were looking at him, he guessed there was some sort of tension there.
He nodded. He couldn’t stop seeing the diminutive form of Peter, one month old, crying and screaming for someone to hold him, never being touched. Being called ‘Test Subject’. Nothing more than an experiment.
That boy- that stubborn mess of a boy- was kissing Steve softly, smile still lingering around his mouth and damp hair from a speedy shower still tickling Steve’s cheek. It was hard to believe, really. Even harder to think that it was
He shut his eyes and pushed the guilt down for a moment in order to scoop Tony up and begin carrying him out of the room, feeling the beautiful sense of familiarity and home that he’d been missing for weeks now.
Steve didn’t respond. Couldn’t, not properly. Loki didn’t say anything after that, but Steve watched his fingers flex against the steering wheel and the car sped up a few more notches. Were they to be caught right now, the boy would most certainly be getting a hefty fine and probably a revoked license.
She leaped into his arms freely, and with a small laugh he caught her easily, hoisting her up onto his hip. “Hey squirt,” he replied, giving her a quick kiss on the forehead as he stepped further through the corridor, “is your father trying to make dinner again?”
( He didn’t want to admit to himself that he’d felt scared going up to bed recently, but it was there. In the corner of his mind, waiting to be acknowledged.)
?” Was, of course, the first thing out of Bruce’s mouth. He turned away from the desk he was leaning over and stared in dismay at the deep purple bruise that had started to form along Tony’s jaw and cheek, and the butterfly bandages that he’d hastily stuck on to close up the cut.
, all he could feel was water, all he could taste was sand and dirt and blood in the back of his mouth, Obie was there and he was laughing and Tony had no one left in the world to trust anymore-
“You won’t, swear, me and Nat decontaminated it when we picked it up, you’re sitting on like, three layers worth of antibac wipes.”
“How do you feel?” She asked quietly, looking down at him with her big brown eyes and tucking a little strand of hair behind his ear.
Steve processed the information. All of it. He acknowledged the obstacles, he noted the machine that Reed had now identified to him as the one he would need to use, and he assessed the risk. “So if I were to die there,” he said slowly, watching Reed’s face fall, his mouth open as if to begin his rebuttal, but Steve just spoke over him. “If I were to die there, like the Tescillians were intending on doing after getting rid of us… things would be okay?”
Tony paused for a moment, eyes drinking in Steve and his tired face, his wet hair, his badly-fitted clothes. Then he rubbed a sleeved hand over his eye and yawned, the other set of fingers curling softly around the collar of Steve’s jacket. “C’mere, baby,” he muttered, still half-asleep.
Peter gurgled in response, fat little legs poking Tony's midsection. Still glaring suspiciously, Tony set the coffee maker to work, one hand keeping Peter from tumbling off the counter as the other grabbed for his mug. He needed a damn big caffeine fix this morning.
It looked as if a few of them were still curiously waiting for more to come, but Steve, along with the help of Sam, stared them all into submission- and one by one, they turned back the TV and settled down again.
And, apparently, Tony did too. Because he hovered for a second, just a single second, and then tilted his head and leaned down, capturing Steve’s mouth in the softest of kisses. It was obviously nervous, Tony’s mouth barely even pressing against his own, and the world was roaring so loudly in his ears at that point that Steve didn’t think he’d have been able to concentrate on anything else if he’d tried.
His eyes were still open when Steve turned him, pulled him up into his arms. The ghost of his smile stuck to his mouth. A memory. “Tony, wake up.”
Sensing Tony probably wasn’t going to respond, Steve’s smile dropped a little, although in fairness it had been shaky to begin with. He swallowed and stepped forward. “Listen, Tony—”
“TONY!” A light slap on the face pulled him back into the room, and he blinked wearily, hearing a moan fall from his lips. “Stay with us, Tones, you’re gonna be okay. We’ve got you.” That was Natasha again, sat between his legs and looking at him determinedly. She waved a hand behind her. “Rhodey, look around this hut, see if there’s anything useful here. Bruce, I have a blade tucked in my rucksack. Turn on that portable stove in the corner, see if there’s still gas in there. If not, we can rig up a fire.”
Most people wouldn’t think Tony Stark could survive for a single minute outside of city life, but they didn’t know him like Steve did. Back when Ultron had been on the loose and they’d gone to take refuge at Clint’s farm, Steve had noticed how… comfortable Tony had seemed in the environment. It had been clear that he’d quite liked the serenity of it all, and despite the fact that a giant maniacal AI was trying to kill them all at the time, Tony had seemed calmer than Steve had ever known him. Truth was, Tony really did like that sort of thing. As they’d gotten closer and eventually begun to date, Steve had realised as much pretty quickly. Tony loved technology, sure, but he was more than happy to be without it, too. Steve hadn’t missed the soft smiles and bright eyes whenever they’d had an excuse to get out of the city and into the country for a little while, even if it was only for missions.
A few paces away, Steve watched Clint straighten up from the rock he’d been resting on. They’d only just taken out the last HYDRA operative, but it’d taken its toll. Clint was sporting a rather spectacularly broken nose, and Steve himself was pretty sure a bullet had clipped his shoulder. “It’ll take hours to get down there in these conditions,” the man said, voice nasally as he wiped a trickle of blood off his chin and then waved a hand across the terrain, still obscured by the harsh winds and spiralling snowfall. “Tony might not have that long.”
“Do you think you can ride on the back of my bike?” Tony asked, frowning and looking down at Steve’s still-bare chest.
To the left, Bucky groaned. “Oh God, Peggs, our predictions were correct. Give him a relationship and he’ll turn into the biggest sap you’ve ever met. We’ve unleashed a damn monster-“
“Yeah,” Steve laughed quietly, “yeah, she was terrifying if you got on the wrong side of her, for sure. And God forbid you didn’t take out the trash when she asked- you’d think I just got up and spat all over the window or something.”
“I’ll tell you one day. I will. I swear,” Tony promises, shutting his eyes and feeling Steve’s arms wrap around his waist a little tighter.
“DON’T!” Everyone else in the room suddenly screamed, and Tony jolted in surprise, stumbling back a few steps as he lost his balance.
“Hands are going up to my ears, nope, look at this-“ Tony ducked under Steve’s arms and leaped on his bed, slapping his palms against the side of his face and covering his ears quickly.
When he recognized Steve, his eyebrows rose a little, and the sharpness in his eyes increased a little. “Oh, it’s you. The new one.”
When he did nothing other than open and shut his mouth a few times, Tony chuckled again. Steve looked away, silently cursing himself. “God, I gotta get better at this,” he mumbled, feeling his cheeks heat up as they always ended up doing around Tony.
He eventually located the bottle, half-empty and sort of gross, really, but he swallowed a large mouthful anyway and then opened up his screens, pointedly ignoring Steve as the other man stared at him. Eventually though, it got too much, and he turned enquiringly. “Are you going to do that for the rest of the night?”
“He doesn’t talk about it,” Sam finished sadly, “yeah. I get it. Right. You want me to pass you over to dad? It might be better if I just give him a warning first.”
Steve made a displeased noise in the back of his throat, but then walked over and slid the plate onto Tony’s desk. “Yeah,” he said, “but I’ll be back soon. Please don’t get kidnapped while I’m gone.”
He just prayed that it still held the meaning it’d used to. Until then, well… they could just focus on healing. Both of them.
They worked tirelessly and seamlessly, having drilled this three other times previously. And although Tony loved to complain about the way Steve worked them, he and the rest of the team all understood their value and knew that they really did improve their performance out on the field. Unfortunately, Steve also knew they understood, and so never let them have a single inch of leeway either. And after an hour of ruthless training regimes, it left them a little bit weary, to say the least.
Tony looked up at him, breathless, stroking across the bruises on his face with delicate fingers. “I won’t let them hurt you,” he breathed, shaking his head, “I promise, I’ll keep you safe.”
He bristled. “I’m fine," he bit out with a roll of his eyes, "I’m just tired of waiting for you to all stop looking at me like I’ve been diagnosed with terminal cancer. Kind of puts a downer on my mood.”
There was a deep sort of ache in the center of Steve’s chest as he looked at Tony, and the resigned tiredness behind the boy’s eyes. Unknowing of what exactly to say, he just looked back down at Tony’s hand again, thumb brushing across the back of his palm. It seemed to relax Tony a little, because he breathed out softly and let his head drop a bit, until his cheek brushed the side of Steve’s hair.
to make himself miserable. But Steve had always loved to be optimistic. He loved to live in the present, act now, suffer later. He took life as it came to him. But Tony just wasn’t like that. He was a futurist. A realist. Living the way Steve lived was never something he was going to be able to do.
“Don’t even finish that sentence,” Steve told him firmly, turning to Tony and shooting him his woeful eyes. “I’ll start worrying.”
“How are you gonna do it?” Steve asked quietly, although he knew. He just… he needed to be sure. “You can’t just walk into a Military base and demand your weapons back.”
“Tony?” Steve said in confusion, voice hoarse, “Tony, what’s… are you okay? What’s- what’s wrong, are you- oh God, your reactor, where’s your reactor, Tony-“
“Not my problem,” the man mumbled, before slipping downward again, moving to Tony’s throat and then scraping his teeth gently across it, “I jus’ wanna keep you right here. Pepper… irrelevant.”
For most of the talk, he liked to think he did pretty well. The kids laughed and interacted as Tony instilled those basic life values that they already knew but Tony had been told were mandatory to repeat. They were a good group, and all of them sharp-minded. That was one of the things Tony really loved about children: their potential. It was somewhat reassuring to listen to the people who would save the world one day, and hear them talk about how they all made a class-effort to try and save a bee that had gotten trapped in the classroom.
Tony bent down, kissing his forehead softly. “They can look out for themselves. Seriously- how many times have both me and Bucky ‘died’? We’re nightmares, honestly, it’s a wonder you keep us around, I’m pretty sure we’ve been cursed.”
He poured his coffee with unsteady hands, clutching it between his fingers while he stared at the mess of the kitchen. He was going to have to clean all this up. And cancel the party tomorrow. Not that any of them would show up anyway, once Steve broke the news to them. Tony was kidding himself when he called them friends, to be honest. They were Steve’s friends who tolerated Tony. They weren’t going to care when Steve dumped him.
A hand fell softly onto his fist, small and warm. Steve looked sideways at Natasha and tried to copy her smile, but it fell flat. “I need him to come home, Nat,” he choked, “I don’t… this is the only thing I have even the faintest of hope in. Even if it’s unfounded. Even if I know deep down that you’re probably…” He looked away and shut his eyes. Not thinking about that. Absolutely not. “I just have to hold onto this. I have to.”
He watched Steve as the man applauded Peter’s excellent work, bouncing him up and down in his arms excitedly and looking over at Bruce and Tony every two seconds to make sure they were still watching in case Peter said anything else. The last time Tony had seen the guy this happy was probably when he’d been introduced to Meryl Streep that one time back in 2013, which was saying something, because Steve
“He once moved an entire classroom onto the roof with a bunch of his friends, you know,” she said casually, twirling her fork through the spaghetti absently as she recalled what had happened. “It was because of his physics teacher. Everyone hated him- he was shit at his job and took it out on all of us. But yeah- I can’t remember the story very well- something about the teacher giving the whole class an hour’s detention for nothing and saying-“
have a life outside of you guys and I didn’t really feel like getting shitfaced on a Thursday evening. Call me crazy.”
The communal living room was filled with all the friends that the team had been able to find, and together, they had procured a large banner and written the word
“He’s enhanced,” they both said at the same time, and Tony sunk lower onto the floor as he gently began to try tugging Peter off Steve’s arm.
I’m getting a fucking divorce,” Tony snapped, and Steve shook his head, pressing his fingertips down gently at the back of Tony’s head and scratching, pulling another impromptu purr from the other man’s mouth before Tony could even help himself.
But Steve was gazing at him, soft and relieved and with that indiscernible emotion that he previously hadn’t been able to pinpoint, but was now quite clear: adoration. That… how had Tony not noticed that before? Steve didn’t look at anyone else like that. Tony was supposed to be
By the time he and Steve had gotten down to the communal kitchen, Natasha and Thor were already there, and Bruce was trailing in with a yawn a pair of squinty eyes. “What’s the problem?” The man asked croakily, “and can’t it wait a few hours? The sun’s hardly even up yet.”
“So what do you think’s gonna happen to that version, then?” He asked, fingers stroking over Steve’s bare forearm. “The whole Civil War thing might still happen. We still might break up.”
“Okay, have you got Sleepyhead the Seal? He won’t go to bed without it.” Tony watched Steve look around the kitchen absently, one hand still laying softly atop Peter’s little head as the child sat tucked in Thor’s arms. “I gave you Sleepyhead, yeah?”
Across the road, the man was still shouting things, and Steve didn’t hear a word of it. He took off running, barging past people, slipping in the slush under his feet as he narrowed the distance down and down and down and down. The body on the floor wore the same coat as Tony, buttoned up to the throat, ending at the top of his thighs. A gloved hand rested, relaxed, upon the icy concrete.
Steve cracked a smile that was tinted with a little worry, and he sat down in the chair next to Tony just as the door opened once more and Bucky swept into the room, eyes going immediately to Tony. He’d been away on a mission ever since Tony had gone missing, so this was the first time Bucky had actually seen him post-capture. For a second, his gaze was concerned and his hands clenched, but then he made a conscious effort to try calm himself. “Did they kill you?” He asked eventually, raising an eyebrow.
“I’ve got him.” Reed’s fingers squeezed reassuringly around Steve’s arm, and Sue didn’t say anything more as they made their way into the elevator. Steve heard her sniffle. She hadn’t known Tony well—at least not as well as Reed had. Maybe it was Steve who was upsetting her. He could imagine that watching someone fall apart like this would be difficult to watch. She must pity him.
In answer, Steve lifted the lid again and then plucked the janitor’s cap off Tony’s head, before shutting it quickly once more. He checked his watch as he started to push the trolley back out of the door, biting his lip as he did so. A search would be going on right this minute, every holding cell being checked. Interrogation rooms might miss the first sweep, but once they established that Tony Stark was supposedly on that floor somewhere, they would check every inch of the place. And once they found the interrogation room empty…
There was another thing Steve had noticed while they were busy doing nothing, and it was that Tony seemed to be touching him more. He was affectionate as it was, and that was something Steve loved about him, but it seemed to be exacerbated these days. If he looked back over the past few weeks, he realised it wasn’t something that had been brought on by the short getaway either. Tony held his hand whenever he could. He laid on his side and rested his head against Steve’s chest in bed, even though Steve knew it must make the reactor ache. Whatever opportunity arose, Tony used it to keep him close. Steve didn’t mind, not in the slightest, but he was curious about it.
Tony rolled his eyes and then turned back to his desk. “I’ll sleep when I’m dead,” he responded as Steve’s footsteps began to back up through the workshop, and he heard Steve’s huff of laughter start up behind him, making something warm light up under his sternum. He loved making Steve laugh.
Tony looked at him with blank confusion. This was not right. Steve should be angry with him. “You said you wanted to talk,” he muttered, “You said… after our fight, when I was a stupid asshole, you stormed out and then you called and said you wanted to… and you want to break up now. Which is fine. Well. It’s not fine, but I get it. I get it.”
Tony shut his eyes and resisted the urge to groan with happiness. "Oh thank God," he murmured, "thank fucking God, Steve, you are a genius and I love you."
“They can’t come,” Tony told him, looking almost panicked- the same face he’d been making down by the car, when he’d swept all the dirt out of it, “it’s bad enough having you over, but all of
no, we’re not here to… no. No, Steve, nothing happened to him, he’s probably fast asleep in his bed right now, I swear.”
He wished he’d just fucking worked it out. Wished he hadn’t been so pathetic over the whole thing- oh, poor little Tony, Steve’s hitting you, it must be because that’s just what you deserve, huh? He hadn’t even Goddamn considered the fact that Steve would never touch him like that in a million fucking years. No, no, it’d been all about
She didn’t say a name, but he got the feeling he knew what she was talking about and felt his heart jump a few paces faster automatically. “I… what do you mean?”
Peter nodded, and then looked at him. “What the Goddamn hell is going on?” He asked, and Steve remembered that to this kid—hell, to all of them, the past five years just hadn’t happened.
“ ‘Normal’ people?” Steve repeated the phrase shakily, finally breaking the silence with Tony’s own words, and no, no, Tony hadn’t meant it like that, and he jumped off the counter, opening his mouth to say as much—but Steve held up a finger in warning, his jaw tight, eyes ice. “I don’t fucking
to view it. He felt like he owed it to the boy three floors above him, even if Peter wasn’t even aware of anything that was going on. Someone had to watch this happen and care about it. No one else who’d been seeing this ever had.
“Tony-“ Steve began, but the other man had already settling his fingers into Steve’s hair, and dammit, it felt so good. Steve hummed happily and shut his eyes, head resting back against the couch cushions. He supposed he could accept defeat this once. Although Tony would undoubtedly moan about his sore neck in the morning, as he always did.
The elevator ride up was silent, and he stared at the wall the whole time, the echoes of the little boy’s distress starting up in his ears, muted and horrible. He wanted to be sick. He knew, objectively, that that had been going on before Peter had arrived to them. He wasn’t stupid. But there was a sharp reality to it all now that Tony hadn’t had before. There was solid evidence of what they’d done.
However, it turned out he didn’t need to. Tony found him. “You know, Maria says she loves me three-thousand,” he started with as he came into the room, and Steve looked up enquiringly while Tony just pointed his finger at him. “Pretty sure that means she loves me most, seeing as you’re somewhere around the 1 to 2 thousand mark.”
“Hey, should we invite Jane?” Steve hurried to change the subject, pulling out the first thing he could think of from the top of his head, “I mean, Thor’s coming, and according to Bruce they’ve totally been pining after one another.”
Tony scowls, and shrugs. “Left them out somewhere- but I don’t need them to see my own two feet, Steve, only reason I fell was because your pants are-”
“It’s all good,” Bucky waved off the gasp of horror from Steve, “I told him to do it. To even out the score, y’know? I think I deserved at least one punch.”
“Yep,” Steve choked, because if he was going to die, he would die in the pit he had dug himself into with pride.
“Tony, what the hell is—” Steve obviously came to the same conclusion right at that moment, because suddenly his breath caught and his eyes widened. Tony felt the pressure on his arm increase a hundred-fold, the armor creaking as Steve’s grip tightened. Tony wasn’t looking at him, but he didn’t need to in order to know that all the blood had drained from his face at once, turning him gaunt, pale, terrified. “No,” he said simply, copying Tony’s sentiment with a disbelieving voice. “Oh God. No.”
when they wanted to, and Tony had no idea how much he was even holding back. He should probably make sure he didn’t get Steve angry enough to do it again. That’d just be messy for everyone.
Of course, two seconds later it was ruined as the door Steve had been leaning against was yanked open, sending him tumbling backward and into Peggy’s waiting arms. She latched on to his flailing hands, pulling him in with an excited yell. “Oh God, you finally ballsed up and kissed the boy!”
“I think that’s pushing it, Sir,” JARVIS told him, to which Steve added, “yeah, babe, I wouldn’t go there just yet.”
He was sick and frail, but that didn’t stop him from tearing Steve a new one in front of everyone, ripping off the arc reactor and smacking it down into Steve’s hand bitterly as he told Steve exactly what he thought. Steve didn’t say a word, and wondered if he’d ever stop letting Tony down. All he could do, once more, was catch Tony’s arms before he could collapse and then carry him over to the medbay to get some more rest. That was where he stayed vigil, right outside Tony’s door, so the man wouldn’t have to wake up and see him, and maybe a little bit so that Steve didn’t have to see him either. There was something so utterly soul destroying about seeing Tony like that; so weak and fragile, all that spark and life that’d been in him, crushed by the weight of his loss and his sickness. It hurt.
He shook his head and shot one last fleeting glance upward; watching Polaris glitter through the atmosphere.
, when they woke up and felt hungry or needed to poop or whatever it was that babies did in the night.
Steve turned to Tony- but the other boy had tensed up, and when Steve raised an eyebrow, Tony… shook his head?
“I was supposed to be able to save people,” Steve said suddenly, wiping his eyes with the heel of his palm, “the serum was supposed to… what use am I if I couldn’t even save the people who mean the most? What’s the point?”
They didn’t get woken up that night, which was surprising. Peter decided that five in the morning was as good a time as any to rise and shine, however, which meant they did have an abominably early start. At least they’d had more than three hours of rest this time, though.
Tony ended the call before Clint could talk any further, letting the phone drop into his lap whilst he turned to eye Steve. The man seemed to be attempting to hide a smile. “Now if we go home it’s going to look like we actually listened to him.”
Steve softened and moulded himself around Tony’s form, cheek pressing into the other man’s hair. He could feel Tony go still against him, ear pressing closer into Steve’s chest in what was clearly an attempt to hear his heartbeat, and Steve was happy to indulge him for a little while. “Sandra asked if we could milk the cows while we’re staying over,” he mumbled, before adding, “that’s the farmer’s name, by the way. Sandra and Owen. They were real nice to me.”
The next Tuesday, Tony found Steve waiting for him, as usual, by the front of the school. He was alone, his foot scuffing the ground and his hands stuffed into his pockets while he hung around and looked for Tony every few seconds. The other kids kept their distance, and Steve looked sullen enough that Tony almost didn’t blame them. When Tony had first met the guy, he’d been pretty terrified of him too. Although not for the same stupid reasons, mind you. Mostly because Steve was so startlingly attractive that Tony always wondered whether he’d been going into cardiac arrest whenever he’d been around.
“No. But I have you.” He broke off, biting at his lip for a second before continuing. “You can cut the CCTV from where you are, right?”
As Steve flicked the switch, holographic foes flickered to life, their routines and fight-styles scrambled from the thousands of options Tony had randomized. Natasha crouched, immediately taking out her blade and slicing through the first one that approached. “Okay, GO!”
Steve looked at him a second more, before nodding once and then moving back to his place against Tony’s shoulder, both hands now curled around eachother. Tony didn’t speak again for a while, eyes moving noncommittedly along with the images that flashed up on the TV in front of them for a few extra moments until he cleared his throat again.
is wrong with you! Steve, if it weren’t for you, I wouldn’t even fucking be here! And not just because you saved me from fuck only knows how many shots and explosions and aliens, because you saved me from my
It was 4am. Everyone was asleep. No one would notice him slipping out, and he’d left his note for them in the morning. Turns out it was easier to explain his absence on paper than it was face to face.
Clint just waved a hand and flopped back onto the rug. “Remember reschmember. S’all love in this house, baby.”
She shoved him back, sending him falling into Clint’s waiting arms (damned psychic twins) and then shrugged. “I think he’s just waiting outside for Thor, actually, and as for the Bucky situation- I didn’t
“No,” Tony said without even meaning to, his voice coming out raw and ragged as he took a step forward, “no, you can’t let them do this. You don’t understand--”
“He pushed me off the bed and I hit my nose,” he said quietly, “it looked real bad. But he didn’t… as soon as Howard left, he just pushed me back under and told me to wait there. For three hours. I was bleeding all over the place, I was asking to talk about it, but he wouldn’t. Just walked off.”
He was aware that it was probably only a matter of time before HYDRA found them in this cabin. The organization was nothing if not irritatingly persistent, and right now this little faction of Avengers were sitting ducks. Maybe the rest of the team had already been dealt with, and now HYDRA were coming for the stragglers. Either way, Tony wasn’t stupid enough to know that the longer they stayed here, the more danger they were in.
to him- they never left that drawer; not in the ten years Tony had known him, why the hell was he putting them around
Steve wiped his nose against his sleeve hastily and then pulled his concentration back to the matter at hand. He wasn’t going to waste his thoughts on Howard fucking Stark, not when the man’s son was currently bleeding out in front of him. “Hold still baby,” he whispered as he pressed a sticky gauze pad against the largest cut on Tony’s forehead once he’d finished with the butterfly stitches. Tony winced when the pressure was placed on his head, but he followed Steve’s orders.
“Thank you,” he choked harshly, sobs interrupting each syllable, “thank you, I never- thank you so much, thank you-“
Steve felt his dislike of Ty knock up a few levels higher as he turned, looking at Tony in concern. Tony himself was busy hitting Thor in exasperation and then turning back, staring firmly over Steve’s shoulder and avoiding his gaze.
“It’s not your job to try and soothe my ego, Steve,” Tony said with a self-deprecating smile, “this was just me and- uh- all of my dumb issues manifesting themselves in equally dumb ways. You couldn’t have done much.”
He sighed and then sat up straighter in his chair, pulling the stupid contraption back into his tinkering range. Bruce had tracked him down earlier that night to say that he’d noticed the alien orb they’d obtained from the previous fight was still transmitting a signal to something, which meant they had a rogue alien still running loose in New York somewhere, and now Tony was trying to develop a locator that would be able to follow the frequency to wherever their unwelcome visitor was still hiding. It was pretty dull work, really,  but it was currently the only thing keeping his mind occupied, so he wanted to devote his entire attention to it if he could. He wasn’t tired anyway.
Bucky had survived, the first time around. Steve could survive this. He could get Tony- curl around him, take the impact for him- he was enhanced, he could do it.
Steve grinned. “Yeah, thought so,” he said good-humouredly, leaning over the table to pat Sam on the shoulder, “but I still want my fucking shoes back, or I’ll get Tony to go beat your ass.”
“Well, in your defence, he caught you off guard. And he had a big pointy knife.” Tony put his tablet on the desk, and then a second later after a little internal debate, he picked it back up again and flicked a finger across the screen. “We’re dealing with a black eye, some swelling around the face, torn bicep tendon, and a hole in your side. Luckily I am amazing, and I know an even more amazing woman who can work magic on cell tissue. The knife-wound is pretty much all healed up. Might be a bit of tenderness for a while. Had to forego all the other more cosmetic damage though. She doesn’t like to stay around here very long, what with my whole ‘evil villain’ schtick, and the fact that if she gets caught near me she’ll go down for aiding and abetting. Bit of a downer, but that stuff’s gonna just have to heal on its own.”
It was messy. It was home. Steve smiled fondly around the room and wound his ankle around Tony’s absently as he tucked into his dinner enthusiastically, and felt Tony’s eyes fall on his profile a second later, the corner of a warm smile catching on Steve’s periphery. He turned, watching Tony’s mouth continue to move as he squabbled over something utterly mundane with Clint while his eyes fixed themselves to Steve over Clint’s head. They shared a smile, and Steve thought absently,
“Should’ve tried to knock some sense into him,” Steve mumbled, “or, failing that, just knocked him.”
Tony shot him another look, face smug as he watched Steve try and pull his eyes away from Tony’s mouth. “Hot, right?”
“Quit starin’, creep,” Steve said, not looking up from where he was plumping Peter’s little pillow, and Tony just grinned as he slipped off the bed and then padded over to wind his arms around Steve from behind, chin resting on the man’s shoulder.
Tony paused, watching the ceramic shatter across the floor, spilling cereal across the white tiles. Steve was looking at it too, his face blank.
But Steve was no longer listening. Reed’s words didn’t matter anymore; he’d said enough. There was a way to save Tony and keep the universe from collapsing. All Steve had to do was die.
“I want to give you everything, though,” Tony spoke desperately, and when he looked up at Steve, it made him feel like he was something holy, “it- it scares me, how much you mean to me.”
Steve remembered everything he’d heard about the name Tiberius- what Thor said, what Steve had seen for himself. He felt as his dislike for the guy racked up a few more notches. “Why the hell does Tony even hang out with him if he’s such an asswipe?”
—he can’t even eat on his own, Clint,” Steve shook his head and leaned down, spearing a potato into his fork. “Maybe wait until the kid can say a full sentence before signing him up for MENSA.”
“Yeah, probably for the best,” Tony smiled at him and rolled his eyes, before turning back to Steve and clicking his fingers, “oh! That reminds me- on a completely unrelated and irrelevant note, how willing would you be to part with your phone for 24 hours or so? Just out of curiosity.”
Steve stared at him for a fraction of a second, and then he turned away, mind already on other things, more important things. He looked for Tony in the screaming crowds.
Steve felt something inside him go cold; that final little bit of doubt shrivelling into nothingness and revealing only the cold, hard truth: Tony really hadn’t been lying, and SHIELD really was corrupted. Rumlow was clearly part of it, too, just like Tony had said. Steve tightened his jaw and lifted his hands defensively, glancing briefly over to Tony. He was still working at the window, but he kept glancing in their direction every few seconds with an anxious look in his eyes. “This isn’t a fight you need to take up with Steve,” the man called out, diverting Rumlow’s attention for a fraction of a second, “I’m the one who knows enough to get you locked up. Steve couldn’t even touch you.”
Tony’s mouth went tight, and he resisted the urge to sigh in frustration. Instead, he just turned back in the direction of the door again. “I was actually thinking that we should try enforcing that night-time rota again,” he said, fingers fiddling with the hem of his shirt, “I know we never really established it in the first place, but it would probably be better if Peter alternated between rooms, y’know.”
Steve had realised, in those moments when he’d rushed through the hospital in a frantic search for Tony’s room, nearly beside himself with panic and fear and goddamned delirious
“And that is not going to happen,” Natasha finished evenly, propping herself up and then reaching over for the small pile of nutrient bars that they had. She ripped the wrapper off and then broke off a chunk, then held it up to his mouth. “Eat.”
He felt Tony’s smile, and it encouraged him to continue. Pulling away from Tony, he wrapped his hand tight around the other boy’s neck and pressed their foreheads together, eyes falling shut as he focused on just trying to breathe. Everything with Tony, everything about him- it was racing, and it was intense. Terrifying. Amazing.
“It doesn’t ever get easier, huh?” Tony finished quietly, his expression heavy for a moment as he smiled tiredly up at Steve, who just pursed his lips and nodded.
Of course- actually standing there and looking at the words which marked out his mom’s name; looking at the place she was buried, dead and gone and
Steve just shrugged smugly and held his arms open. “Well, no one’s stopping you from staying here,” he said, although Tony raised a disbelieving eyebrow.
“I love you too, Steve, Christ,” Tony felt shaky as he said it, endlessly relieved that Steve didn’t seem upset, “you like it then? The idea, I mean?”
Tony broke off, and Steve sat there in stunned silence as he watched Tony sink his head into his hands and sigh deeply. “Anyway, everyone thought it was very funny. And it was! HD definition, got to see the wreckage of the godforsaken car and the footage of them rushing her into a stretcher and everything! Fun, yeah, it was- it was fun.”
Steve was bare-chested, but the pants of his uniform were still on. Dark red pretty much covered him; blood dripped off his hands, soaked through his hair, splattered over his back. Steve showed no signs of physical injury, so Tony assumed that it wasn’t his own.
It was stupid and he knew it. This wouldn’t help anyone. Wouldn’t make anything better or absolve him of any blame if he listened to it. Were his therapist here right now, she would currently be telling him to do the exact opposite, probably. Talk to him about unhealthy thought patterns and his tendency to put all the responsibility on his shoulders when he didn’t need to.
Tony shot Steve a look, and Steve pressed a finger to his lips. The person below them was breathing a little heavily, like he’d been running, and then they both heard the scrambling of feet as they stepped on top of some sort of furniture.
Leaning in and deepening the kiss, he brushed his tongue against Steve’s mouth, feeling it skate over his canines. He made a small noise in the back of his throat as a thousand scenarios popped into his mind. “Sorry for being a fucking asshole,” he mumbled, because he wanted Steve to really know he meant it.
The days at school seemed to pass by with remarkable speed, and before Steve knew it, November had swung around, littering Steve’s day with sharp breezes and generally shitty weather. He didn’t particularly mind about it- he’d always loved the rain, and baggy sweaters were exactly his kind of style. It also inspired him into drawing more; he was never sure what exactly brought about that change when the colder months came along, but this year he was going to take advantage of it. Tony’s proposal- the one Steve should really have disregarded months ago- still hung somewhere in the back of his mind, and he thought of it occasionally. Entering into a competition like that would be about as useful as throwing a piece of art into a literal void and just hoping someone caught it- but no matter how many self-deprecating thoughts Steve had on the matter, there was always a niggling
A murmur of agreement flew around the cramped hospital room, and Tony wanted to say something, but he found he couldn’t speak. His throat was tight and his eyes stung, and God, he felt close to a breakdown.
He forced himself not to panic. That wouldn’t do either of them any good. And if he was lucky—if the world was kind to him, just for once, then maybe there wasn’t anything to worry about at all. Maybe this really was just an innocent miscommunication.
But that was a whole different thread of hurt that Steve wasn’t feeling ready to tug on just then, not to mention irrelevant to the fucking matter at hand. Steve blinked away the memories and straightened his back in order to look down at the file. His personal life wasn’t important. Not when he was seeing a report which told him that the very same man Steve had fallen for all those years ago —the one Steve would have done anything for—was Iron Man. Supervillain. Terrorist. Traitor.
Apparently, though, bathing was the same no matter what age you were. Tony sat the kid down in the water promptly after discovering as such, grinning at Peter’s surprised expression. “You ever had a bath before, Munchkin?” He asked, swirling the bubbles around and watching as Peter gazed down at them. “What about bubbles? Ever seen them?”
The little church where Steve had set up these meetings made John’s voice echo out, and Steve had the fleeting thought of putting carpet down, adding more furniture, just putting
“The combination of mustard yellow and bright green is one of the biggest fashion crimes of the century and if you had any sense, you would burn it to a cinder,” Thor told him anyway, whilst Steve just stuck his tongue out and wrapped the fabric tighter around his neck.
Steve grinned lazily, waving a hand over to Bucky and then pushing him away so he could talk to Tony- well, not privately, exactly, but with less involvement from surrounding parties- “yeah. That. S’nice you’d… do that for me.”
Since their bare-all conversation during bath time just over a week ago now, Steve’s whole attitude toward Peter had done a 180. It had taken a little encouragement here and there, and Tony still saw the brief look of panic in the man’s eyes when Peter started to cry while Steve was holding him, but Captain America was nothing if not adaptable. It seemed that all he’d needed was someone to say that they trusted him not to mess up, and suddenly Steve was all over the little boy, picking him up and tossing him into the air easily with a huge beam on his face or helping out with mealtimes, ever-patient and collected even when Peter threw his mash potatoes all over the room.
He didn’t have to be the genius he was in order to figure that out. Pops hadn’t come back from the mission two Fridays ago; they’d hurried him off to hospital instead. And then three days later, once he’d been given the all-clear, dad had brought him home, where they’d proceeded to have  a huge argument. Right in front of Peter.
Steve couldn’t say he’d ever experienced it before, no- but he knew what it looked like, and it looked like Tony. If the stumbling around didn’t give it away immediately, then the red-rimmed eyes and faded smile stuck to his face sure did. Tony was gone- completely fucking gone.
On the third day in, when Tony was busy at the kitchen counter preparing dinner for the two of them, he decided to just go ahead and ask. “You’re pretty touchy-feely these days,” he began casually, sliding up behind Tony’s back and observing what was cooking away in the pan. “Is there any particular reason, or are you just a little bit more overcome with love and desire for me than usual?”
it. If Thor hadn’t rushed in and tackled him before he could throw another punch, he would have done. He would have beaten Tony to death.
Tony snorted derisively at Steve’s blank face, lips pursed in a thin line. He was shaking, Steve realised. “You think I’m gonna get a trial, Steve? Think Brock Rumlow is gonna throw me in a cosy jail cell after this? Hell no. As soon as there’s a quiet moment, he’ll take me somewhere secure, torture me for everything I have, and then put a bullet in my brain once he’s gotten what HYDRA wants from me. I know too much now. I could bring down their whole 90-year operation.” His face turned bitter as he leaned closer to Steve.
He shook his head and pulled out his book from the depth of his bag, trying to focus on the work at hand. He hated math- couldn’t for the life of him understand how all those numbers formed any sort of sensible process- but that was really why he had to concentrate on the lesson, rather than getting so caught up in his own head.
He was nearly there, he could feel the energy leaving Loki as Steve choked it out of him, and the whole goddamn day had been a nightmare filled with aliens and Demi-Gods thinking they were fit to rule the Earth, so honestly, Steve was taking quite a lot of pleasure out of this.
“Shut up,” Rhodey said fondly, ruffling his hair, “you’re only jealous because you can’t make traps with us.”
He supposed that was all true. When Tony had said he was leaving, all Steve had been thinking was that people who deserted needed to be punished. And it had… it had all felt
“I love you,” Steve said, not fast at all, nor blurted. The words were calculated, thought out. Steve wanted to say them. “I love you so, so much.”
“You had one job,” Steve declared, raising a finger at the child in the centre of the group, “put him to bed at a reasonable hour so that he doesn’t get cranky. It was so simple.”
Tony thought he should probably have learned how to argue better with Steve by now. It had been two years, after all.
Steve just wanted to run from it, as far and as fast as he could, he wanted to curl up and sob until he woke up and everything was back to normal again, and more than anything, he wanted Tony to
They stood in silence for a moment, before Tony opened his mouth again. Steve, however, got in first.
Steve hoisted his bag higher up on his shoulder and made his way over to the cafeteria, eyes going to his table in the corner of the room. There were crowds of people in the way as usual, but he dodged them all expertly and pushed his way over, making a face over to Sam as the other boy spotted him and grinned- because that asshole always
Steve sighed, shaking his head. “I didn’t expect them to. Die Hard 2 is nothing compared to the first, anyway. I don’t blame them for finding making out with one another more interesting.”
He palmed a hand over his face and then headed over to his office on the other side of the hall. His phone was buzzing repeatedly in his back pocket as it had been all day, but Steve ignored all of the messages in favour of pulling up Pepper’s number and then dialling it instead. He knew that she was still awake- they’d been texting back and forth for the past few hours. Sitting down in the chair behind his desk, he flipped open the computer lid and then slipped the phone between his neck and ear, waiting until the call went through before beginning to talk.
The phone was pulled out of his hands by Bucky with a short sigh, and then Steve just watched, numb as his friend took over where he couldn’t.
Steve watched, still in somewhat of a daze as one by one his friends departed into the night, leaving him with hugs and smiles and promises of interrogation later on. He still felt a little light-headed. Maybe he hadn’t been getting enough oxygen, what with all that
Steve nodded with a smile. “Top of the world, thanks,” he answered, and Thor laughed his own response before dropping Tony with a thud.
“Not sure. They’re the only ones we’ve heard about, but there’s still a good fifty more heavily-armed enemies running around here. Thor’s saying he can hardly keep track of all of them outside.”
“Peteroony,” Clint got down to eye level with the little boy, ignoring whatever it was that Bruce had been going to say, “can you say ‘Bruce’ for me? Come on—say ‘Bruce’.”
Tony kicked out the brake and then yanked his own helmet off, turning to Steve with a wild smile on his face. “Where does it look like, Steve? We’re at an abandoned mansion.”
Tony caught it wordlessly, swallowing as he stared down at Steve and watched him with his stupid dumb eyes. His mouth opened as if to talk, but nothing came out. He just looked sad again.
“You don’t fuck around when you’re playing hide and seek,” Steve answered solemnly. “It’s every man for himself. You could hide with someone for a whole game and have their back, but once they get caught? You ain’t on the same side no more,”
Maria looked at Steve and inconspicuously shook her head. Tony just tutted and said something else about betrayal, but ultimately admitted his defeat as he handed Steve his mobile and then pointed to the drawer where the takeout menus were kept. “Maria Stark, you are lucky you are my daughter and I love you, otherwise this lack of faith in my cooking skills would have deeply wounded me.” He took the ruined pot of…. Whatever it was, off the stove and then slipped into the seat next to his daughter, talking to her in a quiet voice as Steve ordered their usual from the nearest Pizza delivery. For the billionth time, Steve watched the two of them and thought about how amazing Tony was with her. Before doing this, before making the decision, Tony had been torn. There were so many kids without homes or families now, and they’d both wanted to have a child—but his husband had been so nervous, convinced that he was going to do everything wrong.
He opened his mouth a few minutes later, but the words died in his mouth as he glanced down and saw that Tony was fast asleep in his arms. His hair was falling over his eyes, mouth hanging open vacantly as he slept soundly for what was probably the first time in a few days by that point.
He watched as Steve’s gaze turned to him, face creasing into a look of mild disdain. “What’s wrong with this?” He responded with, throwing a pale hand over to the TV which was currently in the process of loading up the episode of Grey’s Anatomy. Steve was obsessed with that show. In fact, Tony was pretty sure Steve would trade his relationship with Tony for that show.
It had been the only thing on his mind ever since he’d heard about it. The audio of what had happened to Tony that night- how the events had transpired, how it’d all fallen apart. JARVIS was brilliant, and the recording would be invaluable in court, but for now Steve needed it for a different purpose.
“Hey,” Tony said after a minute, his breath ghosting across Steve’s hair as he tilted his head downward.
day he was gonna grow. Then at least he wouldn’t get neck cramps from looking up at tall people all damn day.
“Sleep well,” he murmured, slowly slipping out of Tony’s grip and untangling himself until he was stood straight once more and looking down at Tony, who had slumped into the place Steve had just been occupying. He paused for a moment and then turned away toward the shelf in the corner of the room, pulling out a slightly dusty blanket from within and then draping it carefully over Tony’s sprawled body. Once tucked in, he wandered over to the boy’s feet and began unlacing his shoes, careful not to be too jerky and end up waking him again. However, aside from a few sleepy murmurs and little twitches, Tony remained unconscious.
When Bucky noticed it, his mouth dropped open. Steve just grinned up at him, wandering closer until he was near enough to pat on the shoulder. “For the record,” he said in amusement, “
They talked for a long time. About everything. About Siberia, the Accords. About Steve not telling him of his parents’ true cause of death. Tony got angry, and cried, and Steve tried to find a way to encapsulate everything he wanted to say but he couldn’t do it, so he cried too.
She was the only one who appeared to be left in the living room; everyone else having eventually gotten bored of Peppa Pig and drifted off to bed or wherever else they chose to spend their night. Natasha herself was reading a book, serene and almost cute in her little pink pajamas.
Tony stopped, letting his nose fall into Steve’s messed-up hair. “Point is, you are not solely responsible for our wellbeing. You, at no point in history, have ever been to blame for either of us ‘dying’. Because I know, without a shadow of a doubt, that you would do everything and anything in your power to make sure that does not happen.”
They fell into a comfortable silence after that, a few of them dropping straight off to sleep amongst the pillows. Steve heard Thor’s loud snoring as he spread himself out like a starfish and smushed melted chocolate into his cheek. The only person who still looked relatively perky was Peggy, who was still throwing marshmallows into the air and catching them, perfectly content to do that all on her own until she drifted off as well. Steve himself was lying on Tony’s chest, his cheek pressed over the other boy’s heartbeat and his eyes shut, dozing lazily. He could feel Tony’s fingers brush over the skin of his arms, and they felt somewhat like drawings- equations, perhaps- but Steve was too sleepy to pin them down, and it felt nice. Tony’s touch was always so gentle.
Tony nodded, hoisting Peter a little higher up into his arms and then pushing into Steve’s hold in an attempt to just find something to ground him. He felt wildly off-balance. Furious and angry and heartbroken and scared, completely fucking terrified. “He was two months old,” he whispered, “it’s a miracle he even… God, they didn’t—I just—”
“Like I’m stupidly in love,” he admitted through a slow exhale, shutting his eyes and vowing to himself to burn the memories of this night into his memory so he never forgot the way Tony had looked when they’d broken apart for a second to catch their breaths.
Tony’s eyebrows raised up to his forehead, and Steve couldn’t help but grin. Yeah. He felt that. “Oh, yowza, that’s a bit of a bombshell to drop in the middle of a fight, huh? Don’t blame you for losing your cool.”
