Gamora nods. "Hopefully not for much longer."
"Tony," Steve admitted through gritted teeth.
Tony nods. "Zemo won?"
Tony pauses and goes tense, but his gaze is steady and reassuring when it connects with Steve's. "Then I'd just have to 50 First Dates this shit."
Steve can't. Unlikely? Yes. Surprising? Definitely. But it does all make a kind of sense. Here, instead of fighting and keeping secrets, Tony and his Steve are partners. He has his doubts over what they've achieved, but who knows? Maybe without the secrets and the division things could have been this way. "How did we fall in love?" He asks. Not because it's impossible or doesn't make sense. As odd as it still seems to Steve, he's already seen how good they can be together here in this world.
Steve sighed. "Sure, I'm keeping my eye out just in case. But that doesn't mean he's the only reason I wanted to come here."
Tony froze. "Okay, there are two things we need to address here, because holy shit. Firstly that you have self-image issues like woah. You should really see someone about that, 'cause you're kinda acting like a crazy person. Which brings me to the other thing, which is that I'm beginning to think you only asked me out as some weird test of my sincerity and that you never actually wanted to go out with me."
"I know, Buck, I know," Steve said, trying his best not to laugh.
"Which is why we gathered up the people who've survived it before," Tony says, which, yes, Steve had known that but...
"Tony, come on," Steve said. "I may be capable of getting a date myself, but I'm not exactly supermodel level. None of them would be interested."
For now he grabbed a sketchpad from the sofa and flipped through to find a blank page.
Bucky didn't look convinced but didn't press the issue any further, instead opting to go back to scouting out potential hook ups for them both.
That's what this is. Steve thinks about a picture of him and Tony sat in a giant doughnut. "Hi, Tony. I was just wondering if you have time for a coffee? I'm back in New York."
"Hi, guys," Tony greeted them all.
It's technically still mid-morning, but they both order burgers and fries and nothing is said while they wait or while they eat.
"The word you're looking for is bisexual," Tony said. "Or, you know, if you want Pansexual probably applies. Hell, show me an alien and you can probably use Omnisexual like Doctor Who guy." He paused. "Also, just so you know, there are male supermodels. It's not a gendered term."
"Right," Steve says slowly, because he remembers being told about something similar in his own world.
"You've got your memories back," Tony says.
Steve shakes his head with a laugh. "No. Maybe tomorrow. Or at the weekend."
"You?" Bucky asks. "The nightmares been giving you grief again?" He eyes Steve closely as he responds, checking for the lie.
"Then hand it over," Tony says casually, like this isn't the being who recently stabbed him through the middle and murdered innumerable people. "What have you got to lose if we can't do anything with it?"
Thanos squares up. "But you didn't."
"I didn't think you'd..." Tony said, nearly proving Steve's doubts, before continuing. "I mean, sure. Don't look a gifthorse in the mouth, right? Where do you wanna go?"
"Last I checked, Ross doesn't have any say over our holiday plans," Tony says, then hold up a hand when Steve goes to correct him. "Or Bucky's right to healthcare. Not since we booted him off the Accords."
Nebula keeps digging.
Tony's expression closes off. "What about them?"
"Roadrage," Natasha said. "I have to attend six of these before I get my bike license back."
"Upset?" Steve resisted the urge to laugh at the absurdity. "Over something some nobody said to you? You hear worse every day from people who actually matter."
Sunglasses guy let out a low whistle. "I assume he had it coming?"
"Make up?" Steve asks, monotone. He takes another bite of his breakfast. He has nothing to say to Tony until he takes him off the bench.
Tony didn't answer but somehow avoided being standoffish about it. Waiting for Steve to get to the point.
Tony looked thoughtful for a moment then stood. "Then how about we dance in here. Just you and me."
"An $800 phone," Peggy corrected. "And we all know you were lucky to get this far without a court appearance."
"I wanted to ask if you'd give me the chance to prove it," Steve said with a rueful grin. "I know you've got no real reason to believe me-"
The way he looked Steve over made Steve feel a hundred times worse than the bouncer managed.
"And what do the scans say?"
A new start.
It takes him several moments of slowly coming around in a cocoon of heat and comfort and what feels like it must have been actually decent sleep, before he realises the source of the warmth is lying next to him and not his own trapped body heat in the covers. His eyes flicker open, a confused frown already creasing his sleep lax face.
"Hey, it's okay," Tony reassures him when he can't get the words out. "Whatever you need."
Tony's lips quirked up. "Maybe a little."
So Steve gives an overview. His illnesses, his parents names and occupations, his mother's death, meeting Bucky, his school career. As far as they can tell there's nothing different there, so they move on to the war. His attempts at joining up, Project Rebirth, the Star Spangled Man performances, the Howlies, Bucky's fall, Peggy, Redskull.
"What?"
Steve focuses on breathing, on remembering where he should be, what he was doing the last he remembered. "How did I get here?"
"JARVIS, can we get a scan on Steve?" Tony asks without taking his eyes off Steve.
Virginia smiled.
Steve and Thor eyed each other.
"We're going out, and you're wearing this," Bucky told him.
"Hi," Steve greeted.
Steve gave him a tentative smile. "No thanks. I'm getting a lift from a friend."
Steve did as he was asked and ignored the disappointed looks their audience gave them.
"It's noon, they've had all night and half the day," Bucky said, laughter still coating his words. "You've slept half the day away. I'm gonna have to take you out more often if it gets you living like a normal person."
So Steve does. Through SHIELD and Ultron, and The Winter Soldier, and HYDRA, Tony's mouth getting tenser and his eyes getting harder with each new detail. Steve skips the boring days, the months and months of attempted normality, the ins and outs of searching for Bucky, but he relays as much as he can remember about people and significant events. Every mission, every world event, the things he heard about the other Avengers and Tony.
In the end, both Bucky and Peggy came to the airport. They took a cab instead of Peggy's car to avoid the airport parking charges, but they insisted he wasn't getting in the cab without them, and Peggy offered to pay the fare.
Steve grimaces. "Worse. A lot worse."
"Yeah," Tony nods. "Voluntary treatment for PTSD and brainwashing. He's doing okay. You visit a few times a week when there's not a mission."
"Well, now it's human gauntlet time," Tony says.
Steve grits his teeth. "I still know how to fight."
Nebula ignores him in favour of inspecting a part which she seems to find satisfactory.
Steve glares. He doesn't have an answer. He doesn't know what he'd do if he was facing Wanda across the battle field. He'd stop her from hurting anyone, obviously, but could he let Tony and the Avengers hurt her? Could he let them lock her up?
"It seemed kinda... I dunno, mean, to build a suit to take the guy down and not give him access. Like I was ganging up on him or something," Tony says.
"Cool," Tony said, sounding like he was trying to be casual. "That's... cool."
Once Steve had deflated and run out of words Tony shook his head with a grin. "Feel better?"
"And short? And broke? And asthmatic?" Steve shook his head. "It's not just muscles I'm lacking."
Two weeks later when he wakes up in Tony's bed after their usual nightmare support system, Steve stares at Tony without waking him. It's peaceful and comforting. None of the anger or fear or grief is there anymore. Whatever happened back- No. Whatever Steve remembers happening, this Tony didn't have anything to do with it, and even if he was looking at a Tony who did... Well, this world's Bucky just goes to prove that maybe it's more about what Steve did. It's hard to be angry when evidence of Tony being right surrounds him.
Peggy sighed.
Steve looked automatically down at the silk shirt. "So?"
"Anything out of the ordinary now or within the last twelve hours," Steve replies.
Tony grinned at the challenge. "We'll see about that."
Tony nods and leans back. "What about stuff about your life. Is it just your relationship with me, or do you have different friends here? Did you have other stuff going on back home? A hobby or a volunteering gig, or maybe a girlfriend? Boyfriend?"
Bucky, as the one that was dressed of the two of them, went to answer it while Steve took his breakfast over to the wobbly little table they crammed into the one available corner of the kitchen.
Steve clenches his jaw and gives Natasha a helpless look that she seems puzzled by more than anything.
The brunette shrugged as eyes turned to her. "Pass."
"Shuttup," Steve mumbled, feeling himself flush in annoyance and a little embarrassment. "I just... thought you were humouring me."
"I don't understand why you're not doing something," Steve pushes. "If your Steve is really out there somewhere then don't you want to get him back as quickly as possible?"
"Weren't expecting... Seriously, you had no radar whatsoever for when someone's putting the moves on you, do you?" Tony said. "No wonder your friend thinks his purpose in life is to be your overbearing wingman, he's probably worried about this exact situation happening. Maybe if he was there for all our interactions we'd have avoided a lot of awkwardness."
"And your Steve?"
"There are other tests Dr. Cho can perform, and I myself would like to examine your aura," Strange says.
Steve rolled his eyes. Sure, they were nice clothes but that was overdoing it more than a little. "Take a good look. They're going back in the box and back to Tony."
"Do we fight that much?" Steve asks.
Tony puffs out a breath that's nearly a raspberry, lips vibrating together, a clear dismissal of Steve's concerns. "We've fought gods, and the guy who literally destroyed half the universe. Redskull is small fry."
"And?"
"Steve?"
"Buck..."
"Wow," Tony says. "If I'd have known all it'd take to get our love life back up and running was fancy chocolate cake..." he trails off at the expression on Steve's face.
"Yes," Steve says, sees no point in denying it. "But if he wasn't, I'd still be here."
Steve hesitated just past the door to the apartment. It wasn't that he was ashamed of his place, or even that he thought Tony would care how big it was or what the furniture was like. It was more that the apartment was...personal. Bucky didn't even bring conquests back there. But Steve was fast beginning to realise any rules he lived by before had no place in a relationship with Tony. He stepped in and turned on the lights.
He turned back to Tony. "I'm sorry for hurting you. I didn't mean to, but I did. I should have thought harder about what I was doing and why, and I shouldn't have treated you like that. It's all on me and I really am sorry."
Tony pulls a face but doesn't say anything.
Tony pulls a face. "Waiting?"
"Right," Tony said, smiling now. "Or you could order in. I'm two bad days away from a stress ulcer as it is, I think maybe I should avoid foods that can burn a hole through my stomach lining."
"At the hospital. He's fine. He's good. You saw him yesterday, remember?" Tony says gently. His face is getting more and more drawn with concern, the lines around his eyes tightening as he searches Steve's face for evidence of what's wrong.
Steve didn't have the guts to try to contact Tony in any way after that. He had a cellphone number Tony had given him when they agreed to go out, but calling it or even just texting seemed a far more challenging task than it should be. He had no idea what he'd even say. So group rolled around again, and it was like a truce had never been called. Worse, because now it wasn't just Tony but also Bruce and Virginia who kept fixing him with disappointed or hostile glares.
Steve shook his head. "No. Tony dates supermodels and actresses. He just likes to give people stuff."
"Pepper?" Tony holds his gaze for a second, scrutinising. "We didn't stay broken up in your version, did we?"
Steve looks around doubtfully. "Are you sure you know what my favourite food is?"
Steve reacts instantly, leaping past the people on the outside of the circle to wrap his hand around Tony's where it grips the stone.  "Together," he insists even as a wide eyed Tony tries to pull away. Maybe all he can do is buy some time, let the stone destroy him first before it gets around to Tony. Maybe he can protect Tony, let himself be the conduit even as Tony has control. Or maybe he'll just die with Tony, which sounds oddly right. That either as enemies or lovers, their end comes as one. Whatever happens, he's not letting Tony do this alone.
Gamora smiles again. "Something like that."
Rocket manages to finagle his ship's sensors to accept input from FRIDAY, who he actually seems to like, and together with knowledge of where a guy called Starlord had thought Thanos would be headed to before the final battle they manage to find Tony.
"I think I sorta was," Steve admitted. Between Virginia's attack and Fury's glares at both him and Tony throughout the session he may as well have been.
"But all the supermodels..."
Bucky pulled an offended expression. "I'm your best friend, your wingman. I helped you write and practise your apology speech."
Steve shook his head. "I can't get him back, Buck. I told you, he hates me."
"Explain," Fury said.
Virginia made a noise like he'd confirmed her expectation. "And if he doesn't want anything to do with you?"
Tony grins. "Baby, that was the best date of your life, and if you don't get back to normal soon then we're going to do it again to refresh your memory."
"About wanting Ross gone? You bet your ass we were. Bruce managed to dig up all kinds of dirt for us that we wouldn't have even known to look for. It's a wonder he ever got to be put in charge of the Accords in the first place," Tony fumes, clearly not over this world's version of events. "I bet he would've celebrated if Zemo had won. Stupid prick."
"Her brother died," Steve explains. "Ultron attacked Sokovia and Pietro died. She joined us and helped us take Ultron down. She and Vision have a... had a thing."
"Yeah, sure. But your knowledge of our team and our enemies and our fighting tactics is not all there," Tony argues. "Hell, if the Maximoffs broke out are you going to tell me you'd help us get them locked up again without hesitation?"
It's claustrophobic as always, the noise and the small space and not being allowed to move, but it's over relatively quickly.
Tony pauses. "How would he find you?"
"What about the fifth stone?" Steve asks.
Thanos smiles again, and even Steve has to forcibly repress a shudder. "The gauntlet may be gone, but the stones are still powerful enough that I can't let them fall into the wrong hands. Even if the use of them would kill you."
"Bruce," Fury said, at to Steve's ear it sounded a little desperate.
The next group session Fury had them ranting at each other again. This time, in a strange reversal, Steve found himself partnered with Tony without having anything Tony related to rant about.
Steve grins at the fervour in Tony's expression and reaches for his hand. "I liked the movie."
Thor nods and turns to smile at Rocket, who came along for the hell of it. "We may depart."
Bucky made an apologetic face. "Sorry, but you know I've got a point. You should dress nicer, you look good like this. Really good."
Steve tilts his head to look at Tony lying next to him. "What?"
Steve rubs his eyes. "I'd really rather not."
They track down Redskull easily, and disturbingly, he's only too happy to go with them. Steve's guess is that genocide only appeals to Redskull when he gets to choose who dies.  He's still going to keep more than one eye on the villain though.
"Yeah?"
Then: "How do you have JARVIS if you also have Vision and Ultron?" Steve asks. Not having been overly involved in the creation of any of them, it hadn't occurred to him until now, but... "Why didn't Ultron destroy JARVIS? And how did you make Vision without..." He doesn't know quite how to put what he understands about Vision's creation into words.
He goes to visit Bucky. How could he not?
God no. No. He can't be trapped again. Conscious this time, perhaps forever. He can't even feel his breath quicken, isn't sure he has lungs anymore. "What do you mean?" He asks, and it's really more of a plea for what he's thinking to be untrue.
"You're not going out in the field with your brains still half scrambled," Tony says firmly.
The only full length mirror in their apartment was in the bathroom and it was all fogged up after Steve's shower. A traitorous part of him wanted to go look, see if Bucky really wasn't exaggerating. He'd never really been bothered about his looks, but it'd be a lie to deny he'd like to look more attractive. With a best friend like Bucky he was never going to get much attention, but it'd be nice to feel like he was worth a second glance.
The gauntlet is broken, which they'd known thanks to a source of knowledge Nebula refused to reveal, burned out in the surge of power Thanos' apocalypse had required, and Thanos thinks they can't fix anything without it.
Steve's way to deal with his problems was usually to draw or to go punch things at the one gym in town where he didn't get stares when his enthusiastic attacks on the punch bags resulted in asthma attacks. Bucky refused to have a punch bag in to apartment in case Steve killed himself with it.
"Yeah, I'm sure selling cell phones and renewable energy is a dangerous job," Steve said.
"Dr. Strange," Steve greets, glancing at Tony, who is squinting at the scan like he actually knows what he's looking at.
"Because we don't generally ask for help from people who tried to kill us?" Tony says slowly. "If you want to go down that road then I'll be honest, it does give us a lot more options, but I'm not sure if they're the kind of options we want."
"I like to multitask," Tony replied.
"We just don't get along, Thor," Steve said. "We're not each other's kind of people."
"Hello, friends. I am Thor," the big blond guy announced. He had an accent Steve didn't recognise, and spoke with more confidence and a heck of a lot more volume than anyone else in the room. Considering Fury and Tony that was quite a feat. "I am told I must master my anger to avoid altercations with those who are inebriated."
"Yeah," Steve says faintly. "Yeah, I'm just... Processing. Things happened a lot differently where I'm from."
Another wince. "You'll forgive me if the thought that you're some other Steve and my husband is who knows where out there in the cosmos and probably every bit as scared and weirded out as you but without me there with him is a scenario I'd rather not dwell on until we've ruled out the alternative. Besides," Tony adds. "Helen's a geneticist with medical and neurological training. If anyone can figure out if you're original flavour Steve or not, it's her."
"Not yet," Virginia said over her shoulder without turning to look. She led them through to an area where they were briefly checked over by some form of security Steve wasn't entirely sure was TSA and then on to a private lounge area. "You can wait here. I'll bring Tony through once he's landed."
"Go to bed," Steve ordered, headed to do so himself as soon as he'd brushed the fuzz off his teeth.
Steve winced. "Ouch."
"What's wrong with my clothes?" Steve asked despite himself.
Tony shot him a considering look then dug his phone out of his pocket, going back to typing away at it instead of looking at Steve. "We're good. You can go get on with your life guilt free. See you around. Or not."
Virginia sighed as if she was humouring a small child she didn't much like. "My cab driver kept calling me 'sweetheart'."
He was waiting for Peggy to pick him up when Tony breezed by, knocking his shoulder and following it up with a completely insincere 'sorry man'.
"It's home," Steve says, though he's got to admit, the temptations of this world are great. Bucky's alive and doing well, Steve's not a fugitive, the Avengers never split up, Ross isn't a problem anymore. And what does he have waiting for him back home?
"If we can figure out those things there's a good chance any other questions will get answered along the way," Tony says. "So. Let's draw up our list of suspects again. Maybe have a longer chat about what it is that you remember differently."
"Not really," Steve admits. "But I know this isn't where I'm from. I think the differences start after the Battle of New York. Or a little after. When I came back after travelling."
Bucky laughs. "Don't ask me. He's a swell guy, but you fellas can tear each other down like nobody's business."
"Look, maybe we've been going about this wrong," Tony says, in yet another pointless attempt at making Steve feel better. "Maybe we shouldn't be focusing on the 'what' or the 'how', maybe the 'who' and the 'why' are more important here."
"He didn't survive," Steve protests. He can't wrap his head around the idea that Redskull is alive. He doesn't want to. "He touched it and he disappeared. It... vaporised him or something."
Tony broke off, looking unsure on whether or not to continue.
"Good. When you have the time, we've come up with some options for you for a cover so you don't have to be Captain America in public. We also have a shortlist of possible living accommodations," Hill tells him. "Drop by and we'll go over them."
"Cool. Remind me to send a thank you note to Bruce," Tony says.
Bucky joins him not long after, dressed in soft clothes, with his hair loose around his face but clean and neat and healthy looking in a way Steve hasn't seen it in forever. He's not as skinny as last time Steve saw him in Wakanda either, not gaunt or sallow or tired looking.
Tony laughed.
Tony looked him over. "Tell me if I'm getting carried away here," he said, then leaned in even further.
Tony still looks sceptical. "Okay, but where would he be if he isn't dead?"
"Can I see it anyway?" Steve asks.
Tony looked him over like he hadn't really considered that before. "I mean, you may not be on the cover of Men's Health anytime soon, but some girls dig skinny."
"Is there anything I can do to make it right?" Steve asked, taking an involuntary step forwards as if to stop Tony.
After lunch they head over to see Strange again and have one of the most surreal meetings of Steve's life, which considering his track record is impressive. After so few formalities that Steve's still wearing his jacket, Strange touches two fingers to his chest and the world goes wonky. When he turns around he can see himself slowly falling over.
"How about we just order some food, watch a movie or something and you let me know if I get too handsy," Tony suggested.
Steve meant to answer promptly but got distracted by just how hot it was that Tony couldn't even shut up when they were making out, something Steve never anticipated finding attractive. Was it weird to find that attractive? He didn't really care.
Cho stops her conversation with Strange for a moment. "Given that you don't remember your relationship with Tony, we can gauge that your altered memories go back at least five or six years," she says. "But if you were a different person who'd lived those years differently then we'd expect to see a degree of difference from the last scan you had, and that difference just isn't there. Or at least, not to a conclusive degree. But then if something were interfering with your memory recall, we'd expect to see that when asking you recall questions during the scan, and that also didn't occur. Your brain lights up just the same as it would without any memory impairments."
Steve forcibly pushed down the implications of 'pretty people' and lack of sleep. What Tony did was Tony's business, and it didn't change anything. "Sounds like you had a good time."
The kids and their families showed up an hour later, each being guided to a place ready to begin.
"You wanted him to kiss you and you were, what? Confused? Scared?"
"Good," Fury said in a warning tone. He looked around at the group. "I'm sure I don't have to tell you that everyone gets angry. Every goddamned motherfucker on this planet wants to knock another person's teeth out on a regular basis. The difference between you and them is that they have some goddamned self restraint."
It's Tony.
Once they've picked up Dr. Foster, they don't quite know what to do with themselves. They're still waiting for word from Thor, leaving them with no idea where they should go, and nothing to do until then. Steve doesn't quite expect the painful clench of his heart when Tony says he's going to go see Pepper and let her know he's alright, or how sick he feels when Tony makes a rude joke about catching up with his fiancee. He supposes he should have.
"So why am I still with him?" Steve asks. "Why do I stay married to him?"
Steve shrugged.
"Dude, seriously? Did you just use our session to recruit staff?" Clint complained.
Steve forced a smile himself.
So how is he here?
"I dunno, I mean I am crazy hot," Tony joked. "I wouldn't blame you for pulling out all the stops to land this."
"So that was a date?" Steve questions doubtfully.
"Well, 'your world' is just sounding better and better by the minute," Tony quips. "If you're right and my husband is back where you came from then I'm going to have to deal with years worth of night terrors and hourly check ins when I get him back."
Steve ignored him and finished getting ready, once again in the clothes that Tony bought. He felt a little self conscious wearing them for a date with the guy who bought them, but he was going to pull out all the stops. Tony would have no excuse for rejecting him, he'd have to admit the truth.
Steve aimed a loose slap behind him and set the box down on the kitchen chair to pull out the clothes. When the trousers were removed Steve spotted a smaller box, this one containing a pair of shiny black shoes when he opened it. A nagging suspicion grew, creeping up Steve's spine. "I didn't order these."
"I have nothing to lose," Steve argues. "If one of us has to die then-"
"As in, hold them prisoner?" Steve asks, disturbed. "Who?"
"Tony," Steve warns, and it's supposed to alert the man to Steve's intention to try to take the gauntlet by force, but Tony's irritated face says he didn't take it that way.
"I..." He looks at Tony. You've got your memories back. He hasn't skipped over those months, he just lived them out of order. "You were right."
"October fourth, two-thousand-and-twelve," Hill replies promptly. "Is everything okay?"
"One, how do you know that? Two, how do you know that? And three, are you sure?" Tony asks. "Because it wouldn't be the first time he faked it. He's pretty good at the whole 'trick' thing, being that he is, you know, the trickster god and all."
"Now that's we've all had a little catharsis, we can get back to our regular group," Fury said, gesturing them back to their seats.
"Or, well, you and Natasha. When Bruce and I first came up with the idea for Ultron, you both insisted that we do any work on quarantined servers," Tony tells him. "I blamed it on you watching Terminator for the first time not long before, but given the alternative I guess I owe Skynet an apology. Ultron only managed to get out after we knew he was a thing. He went after JARVIS, but I managed to get him backed up before Ultron could do too much damage. Vision was made with some of the code left of what Ultron thought were the only copies of Jay."
Steve blinked. He had no idea where Thor was from, but wherever it was they must learn English from very old textbooks. He straightened as the rest of the group turned to him. "I'm Steve," he managed through a suddenly dry throat. "I pick a lot of fights, and it's affecting my life and relationships." He didn't mention the part where he had to be here by order of the court. Even though others already had, it was somehow even more embarrassing to admit than the fact his anger caused Peggy to leave him.
"We're waiting on Bruce," Tony says, slowly, like he's repeating himself to a particularly dense person. "He's running late. Should be here soon."
Tony's face lights up, though his expression is cautious. "I'd like that."
"Do you want a ride?" Tony asked as they exited the building.
"I..."
The very idea of describing the mess that's been the last six years makes Steve's mouth dry. "I'd rather hear about this world."
"The hospital, why's he in the hospital?" Steve asks, though any reason for hospitalisation has to be better than what actually happened. Every time Steve gets Bucky back he loses him again.
"Just you is fine," Steve says and means it. He wishes he could have Bucky there too, but Bucky is where he needs to be and Steve isn't selfish enough to really want that to change. "Can we... I don't want you to take this the wrong way, I'm not... I just don't want to be alone, it's not..."
"Hipster?" Steve asked despite himself. He had never thought of that word as coming within five miles of describing him.
He did. There wasn't even a doubtful up and down scan first.
"Hey," Steve greets as he slides into the passenger seat. If he'd known cars could be like this, he might have actually been tempted to get his license.
Steve shakes his head and says nothing.
"It transported him," Nebula corrects. "I heard the story from Thanos after he retrieved the soulstone for himself, of the wraith with red skin who protected the stone. Iron Man told me who he was when we discussed it."
Peggy pulled up scant seconds late, and by the look on her face she'd clearly seen his interaction with Tony, even if she couldn't hear it.
"Alright, Stark," Thor orders. "That's enough. Loki has agreed to help us."
Thor furrows his brow. "Thanos had no reason to keep him alive or to lie about it and it was he that felled Loki."
JARVIS is just giving him the results of the scan, a whopping no abnormalities on that front too, when Tony returns, handing Steve a cup of coffee and climbing back onto the bed.
"What about Ant Man?" Steve asks. "I already know Wanda is a no go."
Steve grimaced.
He looks at the plate in front of him. "Dessert?"
"Yeeello? What can I do for you today Captain?" Tony says as he answers. His voice holds neither the affection of the other world's Tony, nor the resentment of the Tony from Steve's world. It's... refreshing. A new start.
"You ready to dance yet?" Tony asked.
"Only Jane's held a stone for more than a moment directly, and there aren't enough former wielders. There are six stones and only three survivors," Steve points out.
Steve blinks. "Does he have the armour?"
"Oh, that." Tony takes the phone back. "It's one of my favourite spots to eat out in public. You're inaccessible enough to avoid the crowds, you don't have to dress up, and it never fails to get that vein in Fury's head pumping."
Virginia met him outside the building, or he would genuinely have had no idea where he was going. Apparently Tony didn't do aeroplanes with other people and had come in on a private jet.
"Pepper?" Tony said, turning around to see where his companion had got to.
Tony shrugs. "Mostly JARVIS."
"Occasionally funny? Occasionally?" Tony sputtered. "I'm hilarious!"
"Hmm?" Steve questioned.
"I mean, when the Avengers are unanimous and get the Winter Soldier to voluntarily surrender himself, it pulls a lot of weight. Not to mention Ross's piss poor management of the Zemo situation," Tony says. "If you hadn't already told me about my parents months before Zemo's stupid plan, who knows what might've happened? The guy was trying to bust up the Avengers and Ross was practically complicit!"
Another laugh, this one awkward. "Yeah, I don't think those supermodels would appreciate you giving me their numbers."
"Stark?"
"Like a couple of randy teenagers? I like it," Tony said, grin growing wider and eyes flicking over Steve's face with apparent glee at Steve's embarrassment.
"I think I'm in the wrong world," Steve says, because as much as he doesn't really trust Tony these days, if anyone can help him figure out what's going on it'll be Tony.
Steve thought about it. The Bucky voice piped up again. "Fine. Here goes." He took a breath and ordered his speech in his head. "I came to apologise for what I did. I hurt you, and there's no excuse for my behaviour. I would like to make it up to you and offer an explanation if you're willing?"
Bucky watched him for a moment. "You're awful eager to run into a guy who was hanging all over you last time I saw you together."
"That's..."
Steve just shrugged. "Technically it's a second date. And while I'm..." he fought hard against the blush that threatened to erupt as he continued, determined not to make a big deal of this, "definitely interested in getting in your pants, for right now I was more talking about stuff like back at the airport."
"Sure," Steve replies. It's hard to say no to Tony when he has that smile on his face, even though right now Steve would rather crawl off somewhere to panic over what he just did. It hurts a little to think that he's only found that out since being in this world. Tony back home never smiled like that.
That thought sends Steve back into his chair.
"I thought I was supposed to be the insecure one in this relationship," Steve risked joking.
"Hi, I'm Virginia," the second redhead introduced herself. "I ruptured my previous bosses' scrotum."
"Scan complete. Captain Stark is in perfect health. No abnormalities detected," JARVIS says after a moment. "Would sirs like me to start the coffee machine?"
"But there is a reason," Steve pushed on. "A stupid reason and one I should have figured out long before I did, but one I'm hoping you can understand."
"Okay, I'm thinking memory loss might be a more logical explanation," Tony says, then holds up a quelling hand when Steve opens his mouth to protest. "I'm not dismissing the idea, and we'll look into it. But we're also going to the doctors in the morning, or I guess later in the morning, to get you a proper CT scan and the opinion of a professional. But right now, JARVIS says you're healthy enough and no one is going to appreciate being woken up by our shit at this time of night yet again, so how about we get back in bed and try to get some more rest before then, okay? JARVIS will monitor you, make sure nothing goes any further south."
"Delivery for you," Bucky saud when he came back, examining a large, oblong box in his hands.
"Some asshole cut me up at a junction on the way here," Natasha said.
Steve shakes his head. He's sure there's something the sorcerer isn't telling him. "I guess I'll get going then."
"Steve?" Tony sits up fully, meeting Steve's panicked gaze head on. "Hey, it's okay, we're fine. Everybody's fine. You're safe. Whatever it is, we'll deal, okay?"
"Oh, like you're one to talk," Tony says dismissively. "Mr. I-signed-up-to-be-injected-with-an-unknown-substance-by-dodgy-government-types. At least I knew what I was injecting myself with."
Steve glares at him but can't bring himself to divert too much attention from the taste of the dessert in his mouth. It seems such a waste to swallow. The little attention he does spare is caught up on the fondness and happiness on Tony's face as he more or less ignores his own dessert to watch Steve enjoy his. By the time Steve finishes his dessert, Tony's eaten less than half of his. Despite the lessons drummed into him by his own and Bucky's mothers both, he can't quite summon the willpower to stop staring hungrily at Tony's serving.
Virginia rolled her eyes again.
"I'm fine," Steve says, not liking the note of worry in Bucky's voice. "Nothing's happened."
Tony shrugs. "Sure. We'll go over it when we get home if you want."
"Dated is a strong term for it, but I think we've established that, yes."
There's a man Steve recognises from the news talking with Tony and Dr. Cho when Steve gets up to the shielded room where Dr. Cho is looking over the scan.
"The hospital," Steve admits, though he has no idea if Tony will know what he's talking about. He doesn't know how he feels about the way Tony's holding him. It's awkward being held like he matters by a man who he remembers as hating him. But it feels good too. Warm and solid and a perfect way to assuage the feeling of being alone. He wonders if Tony knows that. If he's done it for his husband before now, if the other Steve has these nightmares too.
Fury sighed. "Is this gonna become a problem?"
Fury looked ready to press her on the details, but the guy with the dirty blond hair started his own introduction before Fury could do more than open his mouth.
It took very little time to get to the club, but it felt like hours with the awkward silence Steve couldn't find a way to break. Tony played on his phone the entire time and Steve began to feel both vindicated and pissed off.
"All in all, if we're acting as a connected gauntlet then we should be able to direct the power through just one person," Tony explains.
Redskull sits in a containment field Nebula set up, covered in Tony's nanites to prevent him from so much as scratching his nose. Steve still feels the need to look at him every other second to make sure.
A feeling of dread trickles down Steve's spine.
He's been in this world for three weeks and he's no closer to proving that this isn't his world. Every test, whether medical, scientific or mystical, comes back at best inconclusive, at worst hinting towards it being a case of shifted memories, not a shifted world. It's frustrating and terrifying and... honestly a little tantalising. He wants to go home, he does. He needs to fix things there. But there's no one left back home who'd be working on bringing him back, and everyone here is leaning further and further away from Steve's claims. His chances of getting home are slim. And stepping out of the mental health unit for the third time in a week, having just had lunch with a Bucky who is not only physically healthy, but getting there mentally, too, makes it difficult to remember that this isn't his Bucky, that he needs to go home.
The jump backwards was as much a surprise to Steve as it was to Tony.
"You're attracted to me?" Steve asked doubtfully. It didn't seem likely. Maybe he misinterpreted Tony's words.
"So yeah, I put this together in case it was me that got the iffy memory, and then I just kept it going because why not?" Tony concludes.
"It's just a shirt, Buck."
"Tony, shut your mouth before I shut it for you. You've had your turn," Fury said.
"Thanks for waiting," Steve tells him. Having lived with Tony as his husband for two years, he can't imagine what it must have been like for Tony, dealing with the him that arrived here straight from hell, not having his husband for months.
Peggy shook her head without a word.
"What, do you think I'm easy?" Steve teased, to cover the way his stomach had just dropped. His eyes strayed to Tony's mouth.
It was a massive shock to Steve when the session started and the guy with the eyepatch turned out to be their therapist. Out of everyone present, if Steve had had to put money on who might actually kill someone it would have been the eyepatch guy, who introduced himself as 'Fury', no first or last name, whichever 'Fury' wasn't, and no suffix. The irony of the name was not lost on Steve.
That does make Steve grimace. No matter who he's talked to about home, or what the subject of the conversation has been, the comparison is always depressing. Everyone he's talked to about it ends up looking at him like he's crazy for wanting to go back. Maybe he is.
The waiting was hellish. The lounge was comfortable enough, with deep sofas, large windows and a TV playing the latest news segment fixed to the wall. A woman who wore a uniform that looked several times more expensive and professional than Steve's best suit but also like she might step into a nightclub at any second kept bringing them refreshments and a digital clock on the wall kept them informed of the local time in at least six different places, making the whole thing seem more like they were the ones on a private jet waiting to land. It was over an hour before Virginia returned, Tony a little way behind her, eyes covered with obnoxiously large and expensive sunglasses and attention on the cell phone in his hands.
Steve reaches up to feel the truth of the statement. Lowering the touch over his face finds the beard back in place as well.
"I don't mean to be harsh," Virginia continued after another moment of examining Steve. "While I don't condone your actions and I am deeply angry with you for hurting him, I understand that these things are not always intentionally hurtful. However, Tony has more on his plate than any one man should have to deal with, and I will not let you add to the pile. He's a good man, he doesn't deserve the fallout of whatever it is you're going through right now."
Steve laughed. "Good to know."
"Well, you see, my company works in green energy," Tony began. "Pretty important stuff, I'm sure you'll agree, but my shareholders, old gents that they are, have decided weapons is still the place to be and we should still be selling people stuff to blow shit up with rather than stuff to save the planet with. It's an uphill battle, but we all have our burdens to bear."
"He isn't," Tony says, eyes flickering to Steve's fists and back again.
Bucky stifled a laugh. "No one's calling you a thug. You're just a little... scrappy. Learning how not to pick fights with guys three times your size isn't a bad thing."
Tony waved a hand up and down Steve's body. "That's why he didn't want to let you in. It's the clothes."
Tony held his hands up in mock surrender. "Just sayin'."
Tony wakes up to a face full of hair that smells like expensive shampoo. He wraps his arms tighter around his newly wedded wife and tries not to dwell on what it cost to get them here. The world's been set right. That's all that matters.
Nebula glares and Tony moves to the co-pilot seat.
Tony raises his eyebrows but doesn't argue. "Alright. Anything you want to know about besides how you could ever make the mistake of marrying me?"
They're walking back from the movie Steve pressed Tony into taking him to, despite Tony's grumblings about having his own home movie theatre in the mansion, and Tony's ripping holes in the plot of the movie in a way that would normally drive Steve up the wall. Instead he laughs at Tony's comments, realises that maybe it's actually a sign that Tony enjoyed the movie, that he's invested enough to care about these stupid little details.
Steve nods. As he'd thought. "So you built the Hulkbuster to battle the Hulk and then gave the man who turns into the Hulk piloting access?"
Steve tried to ignore him, but sessions had a strict no phones rule and there was little else to give his attention to.
Steve is the one to drop their locked gaze at last, unable to bear the look of determination and devotion in Tony's eyes. He really does love this world's Steve.
"What if it is a memory thing, but I never get the right memories back?" Steve asks while Tony dishes out a meal Tony apparently learned to cook from his husband. He's been thinking about that. Not because he thinks it's true, but because he wants to know how this Tony would react to that.
The bouncer begrudgingly let them by. Steve would have preferred that he didn't.
"Yeah, you know. Cool. Awesome. Rad," Tony says.
"Okay," Steve muttered, and psyched himself up. He moved in closer to Tony, leaning into his space at an angle that only made it feel more unnatural and forced. Then he decided to hell with it and flung his leg over Tony's, shifting into his lap. He took a moment to enjoy the slight look of surprise on Tony's face before kissing him.
Thor wasn't the only member of the group to like Tony. Virginia and Bruce had hit it off with him from the first and second sessions, and the others all seem only too happy to laugh at his jokes and swap witty one liners and friendly insults. Even Jessica seemed to get on okay with him. They were all friendly towards Steve, too, but somehow their agreeableness with Tony only made Steve more annoyed with the man.
Steve looks down at their joined hands. He supposes he shouldn't have expected a huge reaction from Tony, and he didn't really, but despite how deceptively easy it feels, it also feels like letting go. Like admitting that maybe this world's Steve is just Steve, and he's already home. He squeezes tighter.
"Rhodes said you have security on the suits so people can't steal them," Steve says. "So only preauthorised people can pilot them."
With a final look around the scene, at the mess nothing can fix if they can't fix it together, Steve nods.
"I asked Stark out," Steve said.
"So," Tony said when nothing more was forthcoming. "My turn."
"Vision? My Vision had a thing with Maximoff?" Tony says, mock aghast, and Steve wonders if that was the nail in the coffin for his believability.
"Wants to get in your pants," Bucky finished for him.
Steve looks up. Strange had said something similar before, and even Thor had speculated on the motive as being important.
Nebula doesn't even look at him.
Bucky did of course help him with his boy troubles. His lifelong quest to get Steve in a relationship or at the very least laid was not at all affected by new revelations regarding who Steve might be willing to get into a relationship or get laid with apart from that his efforts now had a focus.
Other world's Steve had had to punch one of them out. That's what other Tony had said. Even without him, Tony had got so close to defeating Thanos. And if he hadn't have experienced the other world, Steve probably would have thought the guy was just exaggerating.
"I'm coming with you," Bucky said when Steve updated him on the situation.
"I don't know!" Steve snapped. "It seemed more likely than the alternative."
"I'm fine," Steve says, but his voice is tight and breathless.
"Gamora."
Tony wrests the gauntlet from Thanos' hand with a loud noise of satisfaction. "Got you this time!"
It wasn't that Steve had an issue with...that. But he'd never gone out with a guy. Okay, so he'd thought about it, but everyone did at some point. It didn't mean they actually wanted to do it, right? Steve liked to think he was open minded, and it wasn't that he'd never consider it, but why was Bucky bringing it up now?
They finished in time for lunch and Steve found himself sat across from Tony to eat. He was somewhat surprised that Tony was eating with the rest of them rather than leaving to go eat at some fancy restaurant. When he said as much Tony pulled a face.
"Is everything alright, Captain Stark?"
"You think?"
The look on Tony's face is heartbreaking. So surprised at Steve's words, so disbelieving. He doesn't speak for what seems like forever. "Nebula knows some things about Thanos, and maybe about the gauntlet. We have what could be optimistically called a plan, but we need to pick up some people."
"We know we're not together in your version of events. We know Thanos won, we know Zemo managed to hammer that wedge in good and proper. What else?" Tony continues, seemingly without needing Steve's input for now. "We'll start from the beginning. What's the first thing you remember after waking up from the ice? No. Wait. Before that. Let's start with the basics. Your parents, childhood. Stuff we can confirm is the same in both versions."
Tony grins. "Cool."
"So, much happened since your last visit?" Bucky asks when silence descends. "You rescued any more orphans? Tony revolutionised any new fields?"
Bucky pats him on the shoulder with a wry grin and heads for a bookshelf full of board games. "They took away Monopoly, too much fighting, but there's a couple of games left that aren't a total loss."
"Tony? Why'd Tony buy you clothes?"
Steve scrambled to catch up, his friends trailing behind him a little way. "Has he landed?"
"And that's supposed to make it okay that you risked your life for no good reason?" Steve asks, though he begrudgingly admits, if only to himself, that it is a pretty good result.
Bucky gave him a look. "Tony Stark. I know that's why you wanted to come here."
Fury looked very much like he wanted to roll his eye. "I find it difficult to believe that's the last thing that made you angry."
"Hmm?"
Steve laughed. "I was expecting better pickup lines from New York's resident playboy."
Steve walked away to his seat.
"Sure," Tony nodded. "Wants to be the best wingman he can be, right?"
"I swear I'm not stalking you," Tony told him. "This event's been planned for a couple of months, I haven't even known you that long."
"Hell if I know, I've only met the guy once," Bucky said. "I guess I do have more dating experience than you though."
The redhead not wearing designer shoes was the first to speak. "Natasha."
Nebula and Tony exchange glances.
"I told you months before," Steve says, monotone. He looks up. "We were unanimous?"
"Maybe," she says. "Having been a part of the stones, having died for one of them, I can tell you that isn't certain. Life and death aren't as defined when you have control of the universe."
"At least one of you has the balls to actually share," Fury said. "Please, give us a rundown of how this happens."
Steve may or may not have gone straight from work to go clothes shopping that Monday. He couldn't afford anything like the clothes Tony had bought him, but he took the time to try things on properly, make sure they fitted properly, and even bought the skinny jeans the sales girl pushed on him. It was an embarrassing experience as always, finding clothes that fit him that didn't come from the kids section and enduring the smiles of the sales people who clearly thought he was adorable, but he walked home with clothes he actually thought he looked okay in.
"It's... hard. To think about how things went for you, when I know how they went for me," Steve admits. "That just us being together makes that much difference... it doesn't seem real."
"One down," Tony sighs as he sinks into the pilot seat.
Steve thinks over his options for a moment. He can't really complain about Tony benching him without letting Bucky know why Tony is benching him. Distraction it is. "What is there to do around here?"
Steve's heart lurches. He turns to look at the glow of the time, date and weather that JARVIS displays on the window every morning. He's skipped forward in time by months.
Steve glared. "No. That Tony isn't attracted to me. He's just patronising me like everyone else."
Tony takes a swig of said beverage. "It doesn't affect you, and I'm so addicted by now this amount is more likely to send me back to sleep than to keep me awake."
Tony scrubs at his face and tries to sit up, ending up propped up against the headboard looking only mildly more awake than he was a minute ago. "Honey. we haven't been in space in weeks. We haven't been to Wakanda for a little while either. And clearly I am not missing, I am right here, just like I was last night and the night before."
Virginia folded her arms. "Why do you want to know?"
"Captain," Hill's voice comes clear and steady through the line. "We got an alert that you're back in New York. Did you enjoy your vacation?"
Steve can't help the small smile that gets from him. When did Tony start making him smile instead of frown? "I don't know. I just... I don't want to be alone right now."
Tony did give him a number to reach him on after the Chitauri invasion, if this world holds true to his own up to that point, but it went through Miss Potts before reaching Tony, and Steve would rather not talk to her at the moment.
He nearly crashes his motorcycle.
The strangest part of it all is that he really does feel married to Tony now, but Tony hasn't touched him since the chocolate cake incident. For the last few months it's all been plausibly platonic near-cuddling, supportive words and no-pressure flirting. He sometimes wonders if Tony resents it, or if he's really as okay with it all as he seems. Maybe it's something in the middle. But Tony never lets on if he's frustrated or angry or upset that his physical relationship with his husband has all but disappeared. Instead he laughs at Steve's slip ups, sits quietly with him after his nightmares, and teases him over just about everything. It's not the intense, love-hate, fight and fuck thing Steve had half expected when he first woke up to find himself married to Tony Stark.
"Anyway," Steve said, trying to get back on track. "My size and my health have always been this... thing. This obstacle. No one takes me seriously-"
"Coffee," Pepper croaks, head half buried in the covers.
The auction went well. Steve bought a bunch of the kid's paintings and sculptures but he wasn't the only one. Tony bought a picture of a robot and a few people in the crowd bought random pieces. Steve himself had a collection of panel art posters up for auction and they all went. Steve tried to ignore the fact that they all went to Tony, who as far as Steve was aware didn't know they were his work. They raised a surplus by the end of the day, and not only would they be getting a careers and training center, but two new computers and a printer to boot. Tony even offered to install everything for free himself so they could use the money they would have spent on installation on buying printer ink and paper.
That's... a little mind boggling honestly. The thought of Tony and Bucky sharing the holiday, Tony agreeing to go in to see Bucky, forgiving him for what happened... Steve honestly can't wrap his head around it. "And Ross just let that happen?"
The dish arrives a short time later, and Steve has his suspicions about how fast their order was completed but isn't about to complain. The sooner he can get out of here the better.
"I doubt I need any introductions, but I'll do it anyway. I'm Tony, I'm here for punching a reporter in the face when I was drunk," Sunglasses guy said. "It wasn't the first time and I doubt it'll be the last."
"Why not?" Tony asked. "It's fun. You like fun, right?"
Virginia came back from the coffee machine and sighed at something about her phone. Fury had yet to get her to stay off it for more than fifteen minutes at a time. "Tony, stop flirting for two seconds and tell me who this guy is and if we want his investment."
Steve rolls over to find Tony next to him. It never gets old. He wraps his arms around his husband and tries to drift back off.
Tony looked bewildered for a split second before the shit eating grin was back full force. "I'm told I can have that affect."
"What can I say, I've got a soft spot for blue eyes and square jawlines," Tony said with a wink.
Steve looks back at the soft cake-like dish in front of him. Maybe it is a cake?
"Go ahead," Tony said. No doubt Virginia had told him already what Steve was here for.
"But he'll be back next week, right?" Steve asked, even as Bucky's voice in his head asked if he was really going to give up at the first hurdle. He badly wanted to tell the voice that this was real life and not one of the romcoms Steve wasn't allowed to tell people Bucky watched, he couldn't exactly run through an airport declaring his feelings, but in the end he conceded the point. "Has he left already? Is there any way I can contact him?"
"So do you!" Steve all but yelled. "You're in the sessions too!"
"Go for it," Steve said.
Steve shrugged. "Sure. I can tell you now that me dancing is not going to happen."
Tony glares at him. "Like hell you will."
Virginia tilted her head. "Not bad. Fine. Go ahead with your explanation."
Tony nods like he's won the argument and moves to go back to the coding upgrades he's been making to the Iron Man suit.
There was no good answer Steve could give to that. Apparently no answer was still a bad answer.
Tony makes a strangled noise and pulls his face free of the pillow. "Really. I'm starting to enjoy this too much. I know I said I'd take it slow, and no pressure and everything, but there are aspects of this that are beyond my control."
SIX YEARS LATER
"That's about the gist of it, yeah," Tony confirms.
The city around him is glaring and tall and though it shows clear signs of damage, the damage from the Tony's battle with Thanos' minion on Earth is gone, as is the damage of losing half the population.
They fall asleep on the sofa, both still in their suits but minus the ties, the take out they picked up on the way home sits half-eaten on the coffee table and JARVIS lets the late night infomercials play while they sleep.
"Damn," Tony muttered, staring at Steve and not releasing him from where he was held against Tony's body.
This week he was asked to come in to help cover an event. A major donor was doing a publicity drive to try to get funding for a careers advice and training center to attach to the outreach building where Steve did art. It was a good thing, the event was open to the public and there was going to be a science activity held for the kids that Steve was supposed to help with. Science was never really his subject, but he was assured all he was really needed for was to make sure the kids didn't hurt themselves.
"Sure," Steve nodded a little too enthusiastically. Leaving the ball in Tony's court was the easy way out, and for once Steve was going to take it.
"Get out of my seat," Nebula says
"You know what I mean," Steve says and kisses his husband, not letting up long enough for Tony to derail the sappy moment.
The next session saw Steve carefully carrying the box in, clothes and tissue paper carefully reinserted, and dumping it on Tony's lap.
Steve tried to think past the rush of blood to his face and the way he felt a little dizzy. Had Tony been hitting on him? "You were hitting on me?"
"When we got the stone from Loki's sceptre and the Hulk went crazy and you saw Peggy in the forties and everything went to shit?" Tony says. "That happened for you, right?"
"Nicely done," Virginia said. "How long did it take to script that out?"
Strangely, group seemed to be helping with Steve's anger issues. He wasn't sure how, all they seemed to do was rant about whatever had gone wrong in their day, and he and Tony were forever bickering. But the next time Steve got into a confrontation, this time with some guy who thought he could muscle Steve into paying for his groceries faster, Steve was able to keep his head and politely and firmly tell the guy to wait his turn.
Fury raised an eyebrow.
"Why?" Steve complained. "Isn't it enough forcing me out to humiliate myself without making me play dress up first?"
"Seemed like the thing to do," Tony agrees. "Each suit even has a different list. Pepper can pilot all of them, of course."
Tony scoffed. "I'm not insecure, I just wanted some clarification on what exactly it is that we're doing here. Besides, it's not like I have a whole lot of evidence to back up the idea of you liking me for more than my hot bod."
"Take me to another one."
The car is less flashy than most of those Steve's seen Tony drive, but still undoubtedly expensive. The interior still smells new, and the seat heats around Steve while the air conditioning keeps a fresh breeze around his face.
"Well, yeah. I mean, I'm not sure our relationship could've survived 'Honey I Built an Evil AI in the Basement Without Telling You'," Tony says, like it should be obvious.
The fact that Tony himself raises the idea is confusing to say the least. Why on earth would he suggest that? Maybe it wasn't real and this was Steve's mind trying to tell him that through Tony's image. But that didn't seem quite right.
Tony nods. "Maybe it isn't. I mean, from my perspective, this is all real and I'm real. But from yours, how do you know this isn't some weird coma dream?"
Steve breathed out in relief at the implied acceptance. "Well, I hadn't really got all that far. I thought maybe we could try another date. Not at a club though. You could come to my place, I could cook you dinner or something."
"I'm sorry," Steve says.
"So you would have let him kiss you?" Peggy concluded. "You wanted him to."
Steve smiled and met Tony's eyes so he knew the next words weren't serious. "Oh, I still think you're an arrogant, self centred jerk."
Steve shifts, mind lighting up with suspicion. "That wouldn't have to do with his girlfriend dying, would it?"
Anger management group was held in a run down office building and looked like a study group when Steve peered in through the glass panel in the door.
"It could be worse," Tony said, though he didn't explain how. "Hey, if you want I could give you the numbers of some supermodels. Maybe then your friend would stop hassling you over getting a date."
The retelling gets all the way up to Loki and The Battle of New York before Tony stops him.
"Easy," Bucky laughed.
"That's my name," Tony agreed.
The next time Steve wakes up cold and alone from a nightmare, he doesn't have the willpower to stop himself going to Tony. If he has to live in this world for now, then he might as well soak up the benefits, right? Besides, it's not like Tony's made a single move on him since he's been here. It can be platonic. Like last time he shared Tony's bed and comfort.
"'Nother nightmare?" Tony asks, gradually coming around. He shifts closer instead of away as he wakes.
Steve nods reluctantly. He'd pretty much come to the same conclusion every time he'd tried to do this himself or with a doctor or team member over the past few weeks.
"Why not? It's not like I give their numbers to random strangers," Tony said. "They'd know I'd vouched for you."
It feels like being kicked in the chest. Or maybe like having the shield rammed into it. "Tony..."
"Not me," Loki says. "I just don't really care."
"What you did was very brave," a voice tells him.
"Have you considered that that may not be your height that's causing that?" Tony interrupted. "Maybe it's your smug self-righteousness or your propensity for using violence instead of words to solve your problems."
The cab ride back from the courthouse was predictably quiet, no one quite knowing what to say to comfort Steve when they all agreed with the judge.
Tony hummed and didn't respond properly for a few moments. "So, I just want to clear up a few things about my relationship with the press. They're scum sucking leeches, which we all already know. But my personal experiences have been having sex tapes and nudes leaked without consent, being harassed while recovering from being held captive in Afghanistan for three months, and being accused of being a mass murderer for my old business partner selling weapons under the table, while simultaneously being attacked for no longer manufacturing or selling weapons. I've been called the Merchant of Death, a manwhore, a lunatic, an alcoholic and drug addict, had reporters sleep with me for a story, break into my dorm at college, try to gain access to my medical records, spy on my personal life, and deliberately provoke me. I am here for the mandated sentence only. I am not here to learn to count to ten or take deep breaths or talk about my daddy issues. My anger is perfectly under control. I just don't feel the need to control it around reporters."
Virginia smiled sweetly at him. "I'll just be a moment."
Steve avoided looking at anyone as he tried to decide whether honesty was the best policy in this case. "I...um," he attempted.
SHIELD medical looks the same as ever, as does Dr. Cho when she guides him to an examination room, Tony trailing behind. After a brief physical and a set of questions not dissimilar to those the medical staff had asked him when he'd first come out of the ice, Dr. Cho leads them into a room with a CT machine and directs Steve into it.
From the way Tony froze and narrowed his eyes at her over his sunglasses, Steve guessed there was more to it than that.
"No," Bucky said. "Peggy and Angie are heading over as we speak, and they will be on my side in this, and you will go out wearing this."
Eventually Steve cracked. "It was just a stupid phone."
At their next group session Tony sat next to Steve and stayed there, and he didn't antagonise Steve even a little bit. Thor gave them both beaming smiles and pats on the back before they left.
"Maybe that wasn't the start of it, maybe it's just one of the symptoms. I don't know much of what happened in this timeline, for all I know it could have been something that happened while I was travelling, or even when I was still in the ice." Steve shrugs helplessly. "It could take forever to work out what the first difference really was."
"Yeah, you know, for the meds," Tony says. He looks at Steve and sighs. "Right. Memory. The meds were Bruce's idea. Something he and Betty worked on a couple years ago as a potential Hulk inhibitor."
Bucky rolled his eyes and shoved the shirt forward again. "Whatever. Just don't pull off any labels."
"You aren't going to tell me 'I told you so'?"
"Absolutely."
Steve nods.
Begrudgingly, Steve took the clothes and headed back into the bedroom. He dumped them on the bed with as much care as he could muster and went to get a towel for a shower. If the shirt was really silk he was not doing anything to risk messing it up before he could return it.
"You're not listening!" Tony snaps. "I don't think you are some other Steve. I don't think he is lost out there somewhere. We've not had a battle or an encounter with a weird object in over a month! A month, Steve! Whatever is going on with you I want it fixed every bit as much as you do, but Strange is a Doctor, a neurosurgeon actually. He'd tell me to get you examined first anyway and send him the scans. Richards would probably want the same thing before he did anything, and I'm not too keen on bringing him in as it is. I told you I'll call them and I will, but we're doing this first."
"I'm not keeping them," Steve insisted.
Tony pulls out his phone and fiddles with it a moment. He slides it across the table to Steve. "Since you came back from your tour of twenty-first century America. It took awhile before things got serious, but that's when we started."
Thor beamed as Bruce gestured him into his turn. "A man at the coffee shop this morning insulted my dear Jane. Though, as always, she defended herself admirably I must confess to an almighty urge to punch him."
Steve felt his face twist up in confusion. "I can't work out if that's supposed to be a compliment or not."
"Your aura, your chi, your katra, your lifeforce," Strange says. "I've encountered Captain Stark's before and I should be able to detect any differences."
"You though..."
Steve wasn't lying when he said he volunteered with the homeless. Twice a month he wheedled out the time to work in the local food bank, and once a week he did an hour of work doing art with the children of homeless families at an outreach center. It was the kind of thing Peggy called sickeningly wholesome with a fond smile before handing over a box of canned goods to take with him.
"I didn't mean it like that," Steve protests, but it's half hearted at best and Tony's face remains unconvinced. "What about Bucky? You said he's in hospital."
"Just a shirt that doesn't make you look like a kid playing dress up in his dad's clothes," Bucky pointed out.
"Shut up," Steve said. "It's not a real date. He'll either not turn up or he'll make an excuse not to do it again. I'm proving a point."
That's the final straw, and Steve storms off to find something he can punch without leaving permanent damage. He'd almost forgotten for a while there that this Tony Stark is still Tony Stark. Sure, it's a version that has a vested interest in making Steve like and trust him, but at his core he is still the same man. A man Steve can barely tolerate on a good day. A man whose stubbornness and arrogance raise Steve's hackles like nothing else.
Steve doesn't reply, unable to process his own feelings on the matter, let alone Tony's.
"Prove it?" Tony asked. "How?"
Tony's face shut down. "Nice meeting you, Stan." He walked away to where Virginia was waiting by her car and Steve could only glare impotently at his retreating back.
Steve moves closer to Tony. "You called him."
Nebula traces her fingers over the orange coloured stone without touching it. "My sister died to give Thanos his power," she says, seemingly mesmerised by the stone. "I searched every one of Thanos' data stores for a way to bring her back."
Tony raised his eyebrows at the clear subject change but went with it anyway. "Sure. Anything I like the look of."
He'd told Tony about his parents, Bruce was still around, Ross was off the Accords, Bucky was in hospital...
"I have an apology to make. And an explanation, not that it excuses what I did," Steve said.
Steve opted to be on their ship as they went to find Redskull, while Rocket, Thor and Natasha attempted to lure Loki out of hiding. He knows he couldn't have brought himself to leave Redskull to other people, but he sure wishes he could. "So, where to next?"
"Is that a yes?" Steve asked hopefully.
Bucky laughed. "This shit could only happen to you, man. Only you."
Bucky groaned. "Do you wanna be alone forever? Do you Stevie? 'Cause you're gonna be alone forever if you don't... If you don't..." He frowned, seemingly forgetting what he was saying.
"Whatever," Steve sulked. He didn't need backup for this. He wasn't that romantically hopeless, no matter what his friend circle seemed to believe. Tony had liked him before without any help from them after all.
Steve crossed his arms. "Says the guy wearing a red and gold dinner jacket and tennis shoes."
"I used to de-brief you before every mission," Tony leers in deflection.
"Why did I marry him?" Steve asks aloud, because in all their conversations over the last few months it's become very apparent that a staple for conversation for this world's Steve and Bucky is complaining or gushing about Tony by turns.
"I don't not want there to be groping," Steve said awkwardly.
"The Maximoff kid? You think she's behind this?" Tony frowns.
"Check out the front page," Bucky told him.
"I'm serious, Tony. What if you never get your Steve back?"
Both Tony and Natasha give him surprised looks at that, and he tries not to feel offended. It's not like he never asked for opinions or options. He was team captain before, he had to have the final say, that didn't mean he didn't listen.
The hospital is nice and neat and clean and nothing like the horror stories Steve's always heard about mental hospitals. The room the orderly shows him to is quiet and peaceful and smells a little of lemon floor cleaner. There's comfy furniture and a TV mounted on the wall.
"Just... so I know...," Tony said in between the pulling apart and meeting of their lips, "this isn't... just... a sex thing... right? I mean... it's fine if it is... but it doesn't.... feel like... just a sex thing."
Tony squeezes him. "Sucks. Wanna watch a movie or go to bed?"
Steve nodded tightly and continued setting out tool sets.
"We need everyone who's ever held a stone and lived," Tony explains. "Unfortunately there are less people than stones at this point, but we'll just have to try and hope for the best."
There were five men and three women. None of them looked happy to be there.
"Depends what you count as a date," Tony says, and the eyebrow wiggle he gives prevents Steve from asking what other events might have qualified.
"It's not that I don't believe you, I just think we should wait for Helen before we go calling in the cavalry." Tony climbs back into bed. "And I wasn't lying about waiting it out."
"How many times do you think you can pull this fake death thing?" Tony asks, ignoring Thor apart from a friendly pat on the arm. "I mean, do Asgardians not have that fairy tale, or fable, whatever it is, the one with the kid who keeps lying so they let a wolf eat him?"
"Let's just get some rest, get you in to get your head examined, and I'll make some calls while you're in with the doctor, okay?" Tony cuts him off. "I know whatever this is has gotta be terrifying, but I'm not entirely convinced you're not having the super soldier equivalent to a night terror or something. Maybe it'll all be better in the morning."
"Oh, Professor Plum, you underestimate my ability to multi task," Tony replies.
Steve turns over feeling warmer than he has since the ice. Something inside him has felt like it's never thawed out, and usually when he wakes up it's either in cold sweats or feeling like he used to in his old Brooklyn apartment in the middle of winter when the heating gave out. So the warmth is a novelty.
Tony looks up at him. "What, right now?"
"But-"
Steve winced. "Sorry about that. Again."
"Other than the whole airport ambush, you mean," Tony said.
"What? No. I like it here," Steve argued.
Tony considered a moment longer. "Come with me."
"C'mere." Tony sits up straight and pulls Steve in so he's the one on Tony's shoulder. Steve doesn't resist. "Wanna tell me what flavour it was?"
"You gonna tell me what happened?"
"That depends," Tony said. He looked Steve in the eye, "If we're going to do this I need to know that you actually want to, and that it's not just some weird poor self-esteem fuelled fantasy."
"Yeah, well, I guess that's what happens when you've got a gorgeous husband to snuggle up to at night," Bucky teases. "Must be real good at keeping the bad dreams away."
There was a pause of expectant silence while Steve tried to work out why he just said that and where he was going with it. Tony drummed his fingers on his arm and looked at his watch.
Steve gritted his teeth. "No."
They did go to New York to collect Dr. Foster as she was there collecting data about the appearance and disappearance of Thanos' minions, but Steve opted to go with Tony to California, where it wasn't so familiar, wasn't quite so painful to see what their failure had caused.
Their first argument since Steve's world or memory change comes as a slap in the face of the idyllic relationship Tony's been working so hard to keep going.
"Hey, I'm not the one who started it. You told me I pissed you off before I'd ever said two words to you," Tony said. "Then you called me an asshole and blamed me for Obie's double dealing."
It was every bit as good as the airport.
"You really aren't used to the team being an actual team, are you?" Tony asks. It doesn't sound sharp or accusatory, more sympathetic. "If you don't get your memories back, remind me to dig out the 'family album'. You'll get a kick out of it, I'm sure. All the best team moments, both in and out of battle."
Steve wanted to argue for going and meeting him directly off the plane, but her expression stopped him. She might have a point. With three of them there waiting for him the second he stepped off the plane back from a trip he went on specifically to get away from Steve it might seem like an ambush.
"Tony just..." Steve didn't know how to describe the weird bubble of wealth and influence Tony lived in. Tony bought expensive gifts the way other people might by someone a drink, hooked people up with life changing opportunities because he could. Virginia wasn't the only one in group who had been on the end of Tony's networking. Steve overheard him and Bruce talking about a research position Tony swung for Bruce, and Thor's girlfriend had apparently received a large grant from Stark Industries towards her research. It wasn't anything special about Steve that made Tony throw expensive clothes at him, just Tony's impulse and ability to see a need and fulfil it. If anything, the fact he just got clothes instead of a career probably meant Tony liked him less than any of the others.
"Except Loki," Tony amends.
"Fair," Tony conceded. "So what exactly are you asking for here?"
Tony's in his bed, or rather, he's in Tony's bed. He doesn't even recognise the room he's in. How did this happen? How is it possible? He went to bed in Wakanda, worn out from grief and fighting and the utter devastation of having lost. Thanos won.
Steve didn't say anything. It had seemed logical at the time... No, that was wrong. It had seemed... right? He'd wanted to move back in, to see if Tony would really kiss him.
It's a space station barely big enough to deserve the name, and Rocket goes to haggle docking fees with the guy in charge, Thor at his heel for intimidation purposes. Apparently around here a raccoon isn't likely to get good prices but a good looking well muscled god helps.
"I guess? I mean, no stone unturned and all, but lets save that plan for a last resort, right up there with giving Asgard a call and asking to chat to Loki," Tony says.
"Not really," Steve admits.  "Who are you?"
Tony nodded and moved like the conversation was over and he had somewhere else to be.
"Stevie?" Bucky asked, concerned when Steve didn't speak for awhile.
"No, you're not," Steve argued. "You're deliberately belligerent and you pick on me in group."
Tony twisted to greet Thor, who gave an easy smile and sat in the chair next Bruce without complaint. He turned back to Steve. "Seriously though, it's great to see you out of the granddad clothes. You've got a hot hipster thing going on now, it's way better."
"I am only entrusting this to you as I have learned to fear the power of the stones," Redskull adds.
"Asshole," Steve said.
"Hi," Steve managed through his suddenly dry mouth. It would be a lie to say he hadn't pictured having to give his apology in front of an audience, his exposure to an inordinate number of romcoms meant he'd pictured everything from the dramatic airport scene to the heartfelt confession in the middle of a rainstorm, but picturing is a lot different than doing.
The VIP lounge was nowhere near as glamorous as Steve was expecting. Sure, it was relatively private and there were comfy sofas and mood lighting, but it didn't ooze wealth and privilege. It was just a comfy spot to escape from the crowds. Steve took a seat on one of the sofas and Tony followed, sitting close enough that he was pressed against Steve's side despite the abundance of available space.
"You look like you've just been scolded by the headteacher," Peggy said as Steve climbed into the car with her.
Steve closes his eyes for a moment, trying to take some form of reprieve from everything for just a moment. When he opens his eyes, Tony has strategically placed himself closer to an exit, with both Natasha and Nebula between them. It stings. "Why do we need Redskull?"
"You're ridiculous."
"You still don't believe me, do you?" Steve asks, though it isn't really a question.
Tony grinned. "You'll forgive me if I've been a little hesitant to make a move after the last time I tried it."
"If you play dress up you won't humiliate yourself," Bucky argued.
"Tony."
"Yeah, yeah. I'm fine," Steve answers numbly.
He had a point, Steve had to admit. And boy did it make him feel guilty. Group was supposed to be a safe place and he made it the opposite for Tony. Not that Tony hadn't turned around and done the same to Steve. Still. "So why be nice to me now?"
Tony's expression grew even more baffled. "Which of the numerous times I've hit on you or called you hot or pretty didn't clue you in?"
Steve pulls a face and carefully ignores the majority of what Tony just said until he can make more sense of it. "Honey?"
Steve licked his lips.
"Not that I know of," Steve says.
Tony doesn't flinch, either taking the question for what it is or ignoring the sting of what was accidentally implied. "Same way anybody does. We spent time together, got to know each other. I gave you a proper introduction to the twenty-first century and thoroughly abused the process. We figured out we were attracted to each other, talked about it, got around to the romantic stuff and the physical stuff. It's not some mystical process."
Watching Tony guide the kids through how to connect things safely, how to attach the limbs and power source, what kind of personalisations they could make, and telling them stories about robots he'd made himself was a whole other experience to the one Steve had anticipated.
"This is a date, right?"
While waiting, he ran his eyes over the other attendees. A meek looking man in a sweater with curly dark hair and a pair of glasses perched on his soft features sat to the right of the sunglasses guy. To the left of sunglasses guy was a redheaded woman with a perfectly sculpted pontytail and a very expensive looking outfit. To her right sat another woman, this one brunette with a leather jacket and a posture that screamed 'look at me wrong and I'll cut you'. Standing by the coffee machine were a shorter guy with dirty blond hair and another redheaded woman. The two remaining men were to either side of Steve himself. On his left a tall man with an eyepatch and a glare that could kill. To his right a huge blond guy who looked far too cheerful to need any form of anger management, though he looked rather uncomfortable with the situation.
"Uhuh," Steve says.
A flicker of hope passes through Thor's expression before vanishing. "I do not know if such a deception would be possible. If it were, then my brother would certainly employ it, but even if he lives, I know not where he would go if not to find me."
Or at least he thought he was. Two hours later as they watched the end credits to a film Steve couldn't even remember the name of, let alone the plot, he was about ready to snap. Tony had barely touched him from the moment they walked in the door. Just the occasional hand on his arm, a slight nudge with his shoulder when he thought something on screen was particularly funny.
"How do you know that's when I started dating Tony?" Steve asks.
"You don't have to do that, it's not far," Steve said.
Tony shakes his head. "Whatever."
Steve feels despair creep over him at the hopelessness and defeat in Tony's voice. After so much time in the other Tony's company, he'd forgotten what that had sounded like. A futurist with no clear vision of a happy future. "We need to fix it."
Tony opens his eyes at last, though the squint they open into barely classes as open. "You talking to me?"
The kids were enthusiastically supportive of the idea of making robots.
She smiles at him, and he gets the unbearable impression that her face isn't quite used to smiles. "Sacrificing yourself is hard enough, but letting someone else decide what that sacrifice means? You must trust him a lot."
When the session drew to a close Steve hovered, wondering if he should attempt to approach Tony. A pointed glare from Virginia stopped him.
"So, yeah. My money's on your brain tricking you into thinking all the worst case scenarios have happened. Maybe Loki got involved, or some other bad guy, or maybe it's just a weird side effect of serum enhanced PTSD. I don't know. But if 'your world' is real, then surely you should be able to think of at least a couple of things that were better there," Tony says.
"Participation is mandatory," Fury scowled.
"And are you?" Steve couldn't help but ask.
"Yes, think. There's none of this that isn't speculation, but it's the best shot we've got if we want our world back," Tony snaps. "Look, we're not asking you to lay across the wire here, we've already got all the volunteers we need. We just needed you for the fighting part."
"Sure," Hill says, the tiniest seed of doubt in her voice. "Use it wisely, he can and will block you from calling it if you piss him off."
"Thanks."
Tony shrugged non-noncommittally. "It's an ongoing thing. Virginia, think you could bust some more balls for me? The pay is high and the benefits are excellent."
"The Tony I know would be spouting theories on alternate universes by now," Steve says and realises it's true. The Tony from back home probably wouldn't have even thought of calling the doctor first.
"What's that supposed to mean?" Steve asks.
Steve tried and failed to suppress the twitch of his lips.
Steve steps forward without even thinking about it. "I'll do it."
Steve sits up and leans over to see the person's face, then promptly freezes.
"And yet you wanna go back there?"
Steve pauses as he looks over a few of the images. "Why did you put this together?"
"Starting on my left, introduce yourselves," Fury commanded. "I would like to take this time to remind you that I am here because I have been where you have been. If you fuck with me I may well go back there, and believe me ladies and gentlemen, that is not something you want to see."
"They do. You're just a dick so we treat you like one," Tony said.
"Went a little crazy until we realised it was actually improving my brain and not scrambling it. Then he ripped me several new ones and got JARVIS to agree to block my workshop access unless I was supervised for the next two weeks."
Bucky was attempting to do something with Steve's hair when Peggy and Angie arrived. Peggy's eyebrows shot up at the sight of him. "You weren't kidding about the clothes."
"Tony," he said as the final few titles rolled across the screen.
Steve grinned and kissed him harder.
Bucky raised his eyebrows. "I wouldn't bet on that."
Steve floundered. He had no idea what to say. In the end he blurted out, "I tried to join the military when I was twenty-one."
"What? Why?"
Steve's whole body is clenched, teeth to fists to stomach. "That's not for you to decide. You don't have control over me."
"You're you again, aren't you?" Tony asks after Steve has proven without a doubt just how much he wanted to be involved with a turned on Tony.
"Well, a ship would be a start," Tony says, tossing a scrap back into a heap of similar, equally trashed looking parts. "Ours kinda crashed into bits of the moon Thanos threw at me.
Tony pulled a face. "Don't you think that'd be a little bit over the top? Why the hell would I take it this far to humour you?"
"Why would anyone want to do that?"
"Guilty. But in fairness I was upset," Tony admitted.
Tony takes a long slurp of his drink, staring at Steve the whole while. He releases the straw and swallows. "Why don't you tell me what we're like in your memories or world or whatever?"
The world fades until nothing but the power of the stones remains, and then it's all gone.
"By saying you're attracted to me, by going on a date with me," Steve explained.
Bucky takes one look at his face and pulls him in for a gruff hug, hand patting solidly at Steve's back.
Bucky fixes him with a look that says he knows Steve is holding something back, but he lets it slide for now. "I'm doing good. The, uh, the new meds seem to help with the sleeping thing. Finally found a dose that doesn't wear off before I've even hit the pillow. Got nine hours last night. Feels like I'm brand new."
"He's not going anywhere," Tony says confidently.
The thought of dancing out there where everyone could see was bad enough, the thought of doing it while with an actual celebrity whose presence would attract the attention of half the room to Steve's awkward flailing was unthinkable. "I prefer to avoid public humiliation where possible," he said with a wince.
"I'll load up Redskull," Steve offers, because the speculative glances Natasha and Thor are shooting his way are making him uncomfortable. Also, someone needs to load up Redskull, and Steve wouldn't feel comfortable if it wasn't him. Not that he doesn't trust the others, he just needs to make sure the villain isn't going anywhere.
It wasn't the answer Steve was looking for. He was looking for the reason why this Steve and this Tony gave each other that chance. "But you still fought on the helicarrier?"
"Told ya," Tony says with a wide grin. "Was that not worth the trauma of putting on a tie?"
"Understood," Steve agreed gratefully. He couldn't say he appreciated the interrogation or the invasion of privacy, but it was worth it. Looked like he was going to get a dramatic airport scene after all. Bucky would be thrilled.
He gets back to work, of which there is just as much as the firefighters had promised, as soon as the food hits his stomach, and he doesn't stop until Tony appears at his elbow when he grabs a drink of water.  He's moved on from the building by then, now working on car pile ups, on being a living Jaws of Life helping the paramedics get access to injured passengers of cars whose drivers were destroyed or were hit by other cars who had. Tony shouldn't have been able to get so close without Steve noticing, but sometime in the other world he'd become so comfortable with and used to Tony's presence that he lost his wary awareness of the man. Tony being close by was natural, comfortable, not worthy of attention when other things held his focus. Because where else would Tony be?
Bucky scanned him with raised eyebrows. "Well, damn, Stevie. This what you've been hiding under khakis and oversized shirts all these years?"
Steve sighed. "Yeah."
Fury's gaze drifted on to Virgina.
Tony looked at him oddly. "I hear worse from people who know nothing about me beyond newspaper headlines. Not from people I have to talk about my issues in front of."
When he appears on the threshold, letting light in from the hallway beyond, Tony wakes, squinting towards him silently until he finally crosses into the room and swings the door softly shut behind him. Tony says nothing as Steve buries himself under the covers, just lies back down and slings a warm arm over Steve's torso.
Virginia's eyes narrowed. "I want to hear your apology."
Steve prepared to commence his usual dancing, but Tony pulled him in close before he could begin. He could've warned Tony that wouldn't make it any better, Peggy had tried her best to get him to dance like a normal human being and there was no reason to believe Tony would succeed where she'd failed. It did feel different, though. Tony was firmly in control, his hands wrapped tight around Steve's hips, pressing them close and guiding Steve's movements. Steve looped his arms around Tony's neck and went with it. If he ended up breaking Tony's toes or something then he wouldn't feel at all guilty, he had warned Tony after all.
"Is it important that you do?" Steve asks with a frown.
Steve spat his drink all over Bucky's sleeve.
"So," Tony said at last. "Think you can get rid of your roommate tonight?"
"Steve," Tony greeted neutrally, then looked around at Bucky and Peggy, "and Steve's friends."
"Here, let me," Angie said, stepping up to take over whatever it was Bucky was doing to his hair.
"Coffee," Tony says decisively when they finally stop.
Steve knew about the auction. It was a mishmash of things the center itself had produced and donated items of various price brackets. Steve had spent the last few weeks helping the kids in his art group make projects to be auctioned off.
"But there are other worlds," Gamora says.
Tony winces. "I already called Helen Cho while I was getting coffee. She's on her way, but she won't be in the city for another couple of hours, and she's the only SHIELD goon I trust, doctor or no. She told me to get you to calm down and rest until she gets here."
Tony made no move to come closer, leaving it all up to Steve.
Steve nodded. "Sure."
Steve spends the time milling about the mansion trying to orient himself. He finds the kitchen, a couple of bathrooms, a number of spare bedrooms and rooms he can't even guess at the function of. By the time he's grabbed a bowl of cereal and found the gym, JARVIS tells him Dr. Cho is in the city and will be ready for him at SHIELD medical within thirty minutes.
"Welcome to our world," Virginia muttered under her breath. Given the way she immediately attached herself to Tony, Steve was inclined to ignore her too.
Tony blatantly checked Bucky out before turning back to Steve. "You wound me. And I thought we had such a bond." His eyes flicked to the bouncer. "Larry, it's cool. Let 'em in."
"Hell yes, and I made sure the whole board knew about her history with the male anatomy. They're terrified of her, it's great," Tony said, standing to go deal with whatever it was Virginia had asked.
"Don't worry," she told him. "I consider it to be a bonus. You've obviously thought this through."
Steve shakes his head. "There's no reason to think that'll happen. And if it does, then we'll deal with it. But I can't sit around not living my life because of 'what ifs'."
Bucky grinned smugly. "Nope."
His phone rings and he digs it out of his backpack with some difficulty, finding it to be the old flip phone SHIELD first gave him as a stepping stone to the pocket sized computers everyone else was using. He flips it open and answers without checking who's calling. It doesn't matter at this point, anyone that has the number should be able to answer at least some of his questions.
"It means we're not a perfect couple. We fight, probably more than we should, there are weeks where we barely see each other with my work and your... stuff. I don't take enough interest in your interests, you get too annoyed at my commitments and the time I spend in the lab," Tony shrugs again. "But we're happy for the most part. We make it work."
Tony finds him in the kitchen at breakfast the next day, looking drained and a little sheepish. "You didn't come make up before bed. I forgot you didn't know we do that."
"True enough," Tony admits.
"Then it's safe to say she did the same thing in your version of events. God. Why would you trust her after that? What, did she just say 'oops, sorry, I'll be good now' and you invited her to fight with you?" Tony says. "How did you know it wasn't an act?"
Strange rolls his eyes. "Everyone knows when you started dating Tony. It was a top news story for months. Impressive when we'd only recently had an alien invasion."
"You should think about it. If you can figure out a 'why', you might be able to figure out a 'who' or a 'what' or possibly even a 'how'," Strange says, walking back to his body.
Steve resisted rolling his eyes and was glad he did, because in that split second he saw Tony's eyes dart away in an uncharacteristic display of uncertainty. "Tony, I like you. A lot. I thought I made that obvious."
Steve fumbles for a moment. "Sorry, but could you tell me the date?"
"I have no idea. But I know it was him," Steve said, stroking a hand up the opposite arm. The shirt was damn soft.
"Tony," Fury prompted.
"Tony," Steve says in relief, seeing the man more or less whole and healthy and alive in front of him. He hadn't let himself dwell too much on the idea that Thanos might have killed this world's Tony, he honestly wouldn't know what to do if that had been the case, but some part of him had been holding his breath until the second he heard Tony's voice arguing over the necessity of a ship part that Steve couldn't even repeat the name of.
"Don't give me that look, I got nothing to do with it. It's you and your crazy husband," Bucky protests. "So did you come here to complain or to take your mind off it?"
"So, you come here often?" Tony asked.
The corridor outside the lounge was empty and Tony stopped a short distance away from the door.
Steve laughed. "Sure. I'll picture myself on a nice beach somewhere."
Tony shrugs. "I'll give Strange and Richards each a call. If they can't help, I'll call Foster and Thor and ask them if they think it's Aether related."
"Your first selfie, I believe," Tony says, shaking his head. "A whole road trip across the United States and not one selfie. I consider that to be the moment you truly became a part of the twenty-first century."
Virginia rolled her eyes, but she was suppressing a fond smile. "Happy won't be here with the car for another fifteen minutes," she said casually, as if it was only an update.
"And you're okay with that?"
Thor smiled broadly and reached out to shake Steve's hand.
Virginia nodded. "He'll be back tomorrow. I'm supposed to collect him from the airport." She paused. "You can come along. But if Tony wants you gone, you leave. Understood?"
Another week and Steve's ready to pull his hair out. They've run out of tests. Tony tries his best to reassure Steve when he voices his frustrations, but no matter how many assurances he gives it doesn't change the reality that no one can figure out what's going on with Steve. Or that, increasingly, the only person who doesn't think it's a memory issue is Steve himself. Tony says he's keeping his mind open, but he's thought there was no world swapping right from the start, for all his help in putting Steve in contact with anyone who might be able to prove otherwise.
"You're famous," Bucky laughed and bit into a bagel.
"Physically or existentially?" Tony asks.
"Sam from the VA up in Washington?" Tony asks, with raised eyebrows. "Sure. I mean, not bestest buddies or anything, but he helped you out with Bucky." He pauses. "You kissed Sharon? Really? Isn't that a little...weird? I mean, she's Peggy's niece, or did you not know that at the time?"
Tony was gone before Steve could retaliate, easing into a crowd of admirers and heading for the bar. Bucky turned to Steve the second he was gone and shoved him in the shoulder. "How the hell do you know Tony Stark?"
The thought of Tony giving up is shockingly sharp, a clenching of Steve's heart that makes him realise that maybe Tony's right. Maybe he can feel that way. The man in front of him is nothing like the one Steve thought he knew. Not necessarily because it's a different world, but maybe because Steve hadn't known the other Tony at all.
Tony scraped his plate clean and drained his cup of juice. "You planning on bidding or you helping out?"
"So you did hire Virginia?" Steve asked, because he'd half thought they were sleeping together. Hell, maybe it was both.
"Right," Tony said, sounding like he was waiting for the other shoe to drop.
Natasha's face doesn't move, but Tony must see the answer in it even before she says, "Gone."
"Because this isn't exactly the first time we've done this, Steve," Tony says. "I had that head injury where I lost two months of memory, you had that spell put on you that made you think you were back in the forties, and those are just in the last year. Not to mention the nightmares. I get that it's serious, and I get that you're scared, but half of the stuff we've been through that's anything like this wore off after a couple of hours. We know you're healthy, we know we're safe. Maybe we should just wait it out a little while before we start panicking."
Steve thinks about it. Sure, they got Wanda and Vision on the team, but they're gone now anyway. He got to know Scott but he's not sure that didn't happen here as well, and he really wasn't fond enough of the guy to call that necessarily 'better'.  He doesn't want to be married to Tony, but apparently this world's version of him is happy with the guy, and really, isn't it better than being at war with him?
Steve rolled his eyes. "How?"
"Nuh-uh," Tony mumbles into the pillow. "Not fair."
After it was all over Tony offered Steve a lift home.
Earth is still reeling, and Nebula's presence goes either unnoticed or is so far down the list of priorities that no one bothers them. The same probably couldn't be said for Redskull were he among them rather than tied up on the ship with one or more of them taking turns to guard him.
"Behind it? No, of course not! I meant she might know something."
"Steve," she said, looked Bucky and Peggy over with a sceptical but unsurprised expression and turned to walk away without another word.
"Thanks," Steve says. He glances around at the billboards and lights and signs, his eye catching on an advertisement for the new solar powered Stark Phone charging port. "Do you have a direct number for Tony Stark?"
Tony blinks. "Well, yeah. But that's no excuse."
"My move? My move is to pretend it never happened and try to ignore that he hates me now," Steve said.
"Go out with me," Steve said.
"The Hulkbuster suit," Steve explains. "He's been using it since he's been having... issues summoning the other guy."
"Seriously!" Tony finishes, with emphasis.
"But I'm fine! No ill effects!" Tony says cheerily, arms splayed wide. "I might actually make it into my low hundreds now, when before... well, let's just say I wasn't about to break any longevity records."
Bucky shrugs, loose and relaxed, a smile tugging at his lips.
"Uhuh," Bucky said doubtfully. "Stevie, you'd tell me if you started liking guys, right?"
"Yeah. I just wanted to...check," Steve said.
"What does that even have to do with anything?" Steve was close to pulling his hair out. Or actually hitting Tony. It could go either way.
Tony blinks right back. "Armour?"
"What's going on?" Steve demands to know.
At one point Steve was helping a little girl with her robot and Tony came to look, congratulating the girl on her design and taking it from Steve's hands and easily fitting a part that Steve had been struggling with before handing it back. Tony's hand grazed down Steve's back as he left and Steve shivered.
"I'm going to die," Steve affirms, though her tone didn't seem to back that up.
By the time he takes a break it's well past lunch time, and his body reminds him that effort like he exerts regularly needs equally regular meals. He wants to keep going, the guilt driving him almost to tears as he lifts chunk after chunk of concrete, beam after beam of the building's frame, but the firefighters around him urge him to take a break with steady, grim reassurance that there'll be plenty for him to do later that he'll need his strength for.
Steve's smile is brittle and he knows Bucky sees it, even though he doesn't acknowledge it.
They don't head for the 'sanctum' wherever that is, instead heading for a burger joint where they hide in a booth in the back where no one seems inclined to bother them.
Virginia tilted her head thoughtfully.
"So," Bucky said, dropping a tomato onto the cutting board in front of him. "What's your move now, lover boy?"
His world's Tony would never trust Steve's hand around his neck, no matter how gentle or affectionately placed.
A grimace surfaced at her demand no matter how hard he fought to remain neutral and earnest. "As you know, I don't have the best self image and I overreact when I think people are treating me differently because of my size. That was the conscious reason for my actions, however there was another reason I have only recently discovered myself. I like you. When I asked you out, I think I was actually asking you out, even if I didn't know it. My reaction at the club was more to my own feelings and actions than to yours."
Bucky picked up the shirt and gave a low whistle. "Yeah, I get that. This shirt feels like silk!"
"Okay. That's a good start," Tony says. "Do you want me to call Tasha or Bruce or someone to come hang out? Or you good with just me?"
Steve stood up to greet him and Tony finally looked up from his phone.
"What isn't wrong with them?" Tony scoffed. "They're the wrong size, they look like something a suburban father of three would wear, and your shoes look like the bastard children of a pair of sneakers and a pair of funeral shoes."
"Stark?" He asks in a voice more rough from the sudden overwhelming grief and shame he feels than the lingering sleep in his system.
They entered through the VIP gate and Steve became very aware that Bucky would likely be waking him up with another paper with his picture on it in the morning. Tony bought them both a drink and nodded to the dancefloor. "I'll get you out on there later, but how about we head to the VIP lounge for a bit first?"
Steve didn't know whether the guy's attitude or his assumption everyone must know who he was pissed him off more. The fact the guy's face actually did ring a bell once he'd spoken was almost as bad as either.
"We came to bring you home," Natasha says, coming up in front of Steve, probably to lessen Tony's threat perception. "Thor's here, too. Bruce is back home with Pepper."
"Well duh. I like to think I know my husband from just any old Steve," Tony says with an exaggerated eyeroll.
Tony's face did something funny before settling on a grin. "You'd be surprised." He shifted to face Steve a little more. "I'll admit, my pickup lines are a little rusty. I don't usually need 'em. We could just skip ahead to the making out."
"I'd really like-" Steve broke off, needing to do his best to win Tony over before he lost his chance, but not sure if he should given the resigned look on Tony's face that even the glasses couldn't quite cover. "I'm sorry for what I did, and there's no excuse-"
The raccoon, Rocket, agrees to ferry Steve off into space after a long argument in which Steve eventually manages to convince him that Tony is their best hope at fixing this. That the man who is with him, Dr. Strange, is their second best shot. Natasha and Thor insist on going with him.
Bucky shook his head frantically, advancing on to negating hand gestures until Tony caught sight of him and laughed.
Tony nods and goes back to the parts. "Along with half the population of the universe."
"What? No. I don't want them. What would I do with them?" Tony said, pushing the box back towards Steve.
"But why this? Why can't I wear something not gifted to me by a drunk asshole?" Steve plucked at the shirt in its position on his bed.
And just like that the ball was back in Steve's court. He coughed a little and ignored the fact he'd completely lost his battle against blushing. "Could we, I dunno, make out for a while?"
"No. You know what? I don't have to deal with this. I've got my own shit going on, it's not my job to fix your issues," Tony snapped.
Steve flinches and looks around, expecting to see the Vision in a corner of the room or something.
"Loki's dead," Steve tells him.
Steve looks at the man in front of him and imagines what it must be like to be the other Steve, to live this life and know it's his. "You said you've been married two years. How long have you been in a relationship with... other Steve?"
"As long as you picture me there with you," Tony said with a wink. He was doing a lot of those lately, and Steve had to tell himself it was weird and not oddly charming.
"Doesn't matter," Steve said, already cursing himself for taking it this far but unable to back down as always.
Steve opens his mouth. Closes it again.
"You," Tony says nonsensically.
In spite of himself Steve can't help but respond. "Dislodge what?"
A shrug. "Most of the time."
Steve memorises the number she recites, then hangs up as politely as he's able with the buzz building under his skin. His thumb hovers above the call button for an interminable amount of time before he can bring himself to press it. And then he waits.
"Hey, Steve," Tony said, taking off the sunglasses he was still wearing for some reason even though it was ten o'clock at night. "Didn't picture this as your scene." He stopped, seemingly ignoring the sudden crowd of people trying to get in close, taking pictures and a couple even asking for autographs.
Steve didn't know if the strong urge he had to move away was stronger or weaker than the strong urge he had to move closer. Instead of doing either he just stayed frozen, caught up in the smirk on Tony's lips and the heat where their bodies were pressed close.
"Because I'm constantly accosted by people who deliberately provoke me," Tony argued. "I don't pick fights. I finish them."
From pulling up outside the restaurant to sitting at their table, Steve was questioning whether this Tony really knew his husband, but the second the server who took their order (something in French that despite his rough fluency, Steve wasn't quite sure of beyond something that sounded suspiciously like 'gateau') leaves Tony turns sparkling eyes on him. "Don't give me that look. I swear, this place does your favourite food ever."
"That's good, Buck. I'm glad to hear it," Steve says softly. He knows the Bucky from back home hadn't got more than an hour at a stretch since he broke his programming. He never got the chance to figure out a way to sleep through the night.
"Hey, we can order more dessert. I'm pretty sure they'll even let us take it to go if we ask nicely," Tony suggests with a grin that makes Steve relax despite himself. "We can ditch the ties and eat it at home in front of the TV."
Steve fumbled for a reply, because sure, what he did was a little messed up, but he'd been over this in sessions. He wasn't ashamed of being a little guy, he knew he had value.
Steve ground his teeth. "Saving the world, huh? Is that before or after you sold weapons to mass murderers?"
"I do want this, I-" Steve cut himself off as Tony's pointed look zeroed in on his mouth. "Oh." Right. Well, it was how he'd tried to determine if Tony was really interested.
Tony barely pauses in reaching for his coke. "I dunno. I guess some combination of opposites attract and my stunning charm and charisma."
Jessica narrowed her eyes back.
"My face is too pretty to stay mad at, you're really going with that?" Steve asked doubtfully.
Steve held his hands out of the way, refusing to take it. "Well, I don't want them either."
"Take it slow?" Steve asks puzzled into near alertness.
True to his word, Tony spends the next two weeks dragging Steve into home cooked meals, trips to the movies, a walk around Central Park, a trip to a coffee shop in Brooklyn that this world's Steve liked, and to anywhere and anything that might trigger Steve's supposedly missing memories. Tonight they were going out for dinner.
Steve nodded, though he wasn't really sure what she was saying. He knew he didn't do it to hurt Tony. Even when Tony's very existence grated on him he hadn't wanted to deliberately hurt the man. Well, not more than one solid punch to the face, and even that he wouldn't have carried through on. Probably.
"Well sure," Tony said and leaned back in. "Glad we got that all cleared up."
The power is tangible as it seeps into Steve's pores and links him to Tony where their hands meet. As it washes over him he deliberately resists any thoughts that could be interpreted as instructions beyond keeping Tony safe, and as he does so, he sees Tony relax. The tingling pressure builds to the point of pain and then keeps going. There's no sign of discomfort on Tony's face though, and that's what's important here. Steve knew the risks when he put his hand over Tony's. If he's truly honest with himself, Steve isn't entirely sure about letting Tony do this, letting him be in control and leaving him to deal with the aftermath, beyond trust in Tony's good intentions Steve is well aware of the difference between intention and reality. But he's fought Tony before, demanded he cede control, tried to take it from him, and it ended with half the universe dead. And if it all goes wrong, well, at least Steve will find comfort in the knowledge that he and Tony both did their best.
"Just remember," Strange calls out as he leaves. "Sometimes the 'why' is just as important as the 'how'."
"Time to go," Tony tells him.
"You," Tony says simply.
"See? Not so bad," Tony murmured, leaning in teasingly close.
Steve considers. "This is me asking you on a lot more dates."
Tony's grin grew wider. "You, Rogers, are anything but easy."
That wasn't what Steve meant, but he has a feeling Strange knows that. "You can't do anything more than that?"
"Noted," Tony said.
"Nothing," Steve said. Then, because he was stubborn, not a complete imbecile, he launched himself back into Tony's space, though without the attempt at dancing this time. "Sorry, I just wasn't expecting that. Try it again."
"Yeah."
"No," Tony interrupts with enough unleashed fury to shut Steve up. "This isn't about me giving a shit about you killing yourself. This is about the fact that whoever is in the middle of this circle gets to control the fate of the known Universe. I don't even really trust myself to do this, but for some reason these other people do."
"Fuck should I know? You're the one sat up in bed at," Tony rolls to glance at the bedside alarm, "half four in the morning, calling me Stark and acting like a weirdo."
"I moved away," Steve said. "It was instinct! I tried to move back in but he'd caught on that something was off."
"Hello," the guy with the curly hair and the regular glasses spoke up and then cleared his throat. "I'm Bruce. My temper gets the best of me a lot, and it's like I change into a whole other person. I want to learn how to stop."
"Want to go to dinner?" Steve asks.
Steve resisted the urge to argue. There was no way Tony would believe him if he tried to say his self-esteem wasn't that bad. "Sure."
"After coffee," Tony agrees easily and without a hint of doubt.
Steve sputtered and sat upright. "What the hell, Buck?"
It was obvious who did order them, though Steve couldn't for the life of him imagine why, or how Tony got his measurements.
"Sure," Steve said blandly.
"Are we going to fight or are you going to continue your petty posturing?" Thanos asks.
"You just made coffee," Steve points out stupidly.
"Steve," Tony greeted, seeming mildly surprised. "So this is the place you volunteer."
Steve picks up the phone, a picture of Steve and Tony sat together inside a giant doughnut open on the screen. Tony's in the Iron Man armour which explains how they got up there, and both of them are laughing as Steve holds out the camera for the picture.
The fights is... Quick. Tony wasn't just posturing with his confidence, and to Thor's obvious surprise they manage to take Thanos down if not easily then efficiently. Maybe it's because his urgency is gone, or maybe it's because he isn't able to control the gems to gain the advantage, or maybe it's that all of them together, Avengers, Guardians and villains, is just too much for one entity to withstand for long. Or maybe, a small voice Steve's trying hard to ignore ever since this world's Tony mentioned Pepper's name, maybe it's because Tony and Steve together, fighting side by side will always win.
"And you don't believe me that I'm in the wrong place," Steve says.
"Says you," Tony scoffs.
"You've dated male supermodels, but you're attracted to me?" Steve pressed. Because the more he thought about it the less likely it seemed, for all his previous dwelling on the idea.
Steve considered his options. "When you said we'd see how it went with the whole 'level of acceptable groping' thing, I thought that'd mean there was, you know, groping."
Neither Steve's own friends nor Virginia and the confusingly dressed server seemed inclined to give them a moment or offer any kind of assistance.
"So, why would he do that?" Bucky asked. "He only knows you from your group stuff, that barely merits him acknowledging your existence when running into you, let alone getting you into a club, getting right up close and personal to talk in your ear and then buying you expensive gifts."
"Wait, Wanda? You were friends with Wanda Maximoff?" Tony says incredulously. "Wow."
Steve can't imagine a reason why he wouldn't want to be involved with that and expresses this sentiment with his hands.
"Still," Virginia said with a significant eyebrow raise. "What is it you're hoping to get out of this?"
"Yeah, you covered that already," Tony interrupted. "You're good."
"Yeah," Steve sighed. "He means well."
"You're not exactly part of the body positivity movement are you?" Tony said with an amused expression. "You know what they say: all bodies are beautiful."
"I wanted to make a difference," Steve continued. "To help people. But they turned me down. Not much use for someone like me, I couldn't pass the physical."
After their last session Tony had left the box of clothes lying on the floor when he left, and loathe to waste anything Steve had picked it up. It was stowed in his closet, untouched.
"There a lot of things I can do, Captain Stark," Strange says, eyeing Steve's uncomfortable shift at the name with interest. "Whether or not they'd be helpful is another matter. You're welcome to join us for meditation, you'd be surprised what kind of stuff that can dig up."
"Why?" Tony asks with genuine curiosity.
Steve nods, mind stuttering over the part where one of them has to die. He's bet his right arm that Tony plans on that person being him. He can't let that happen. Tony has Pepper to go home to, a future, a clean energy company that deals with disaster relief that the world desperately needs.
Brown tousled hair and the top of someone's shoulder.
Steve has no rational explanation for what happens next. He goes from staring at Tony's food, to watching him raise a bite to his mouth, to staring at a small glob of chocolate on Tony's lip, to sucking the chocolate off Tony's lip so fast he suspects the cake is literally magic rather than just tasting that way. Tony's mouth is warm and tastes of the dessert mixed with just a dash of the sherry Tony's been sipping since they sat down. He kisses back without pause, seemingly unsurprised by this turn of events, though in all fairness, from his perspective as a guy who thinks Steve is his husband, it's probably not all that shocking. For Steve it's life changing. Because he likes it. A lot. The way Tony's lips are just the right level of firm, the way he moves his tongue, the way Tony's bottom lip feels between his teeth, the feel of Tony's pulse beating fast and strong beneath the fingers Steve cups around his neck.
"Sorry," Tony says. "Not helping. Look, tell me that this version of events doesn't line up. Tell me you and me together wouldn't stop Ultron or Thanos. Pick a detail, any detail that you think is impossible or doesn't make sense."
"Do you still want to kiss him?" Peggy asked.
"And then I get mad," Steve said. He tried to find a point to what he was saying, some note to end on. "If people would just treat me like a human being..."
Tony blinked.
"Well, yeah. You were a dick. But he hated you before, right? You won him over once before," Bucky pointed out. "So do it again."
Natasha shrugs. "You'd have to ask Thor."
"Pair up," Fury said as he entered, holding a cup of the much maligned Starbucks.
"Mean is the right word. It's like it tries to attack you in Steve's place," Bucky said.
There's a moment where Steve thinks Tony isn't going to answer, that he'll just avoid it and sweep right past it, then Tony rubs a hand over his mouth and steps in close. "If you really are from another world, then we will get you back there and get my husband back. And if you aren't, if you're my husband then I've got to believe that I'll get my Steve back. Even if you don't remember. Even if I've got to somehow make you fall for me all over again, even if we have to start from scratch. Hell, even if this whole thing repeats the second I do and I have to spend the rest of my life convincing you that you want to be married to me. I don't give up on stuff that matters."
Tony smiles tiredly. "And what if you lose it all again? We don't know how your head got scrambled in the first place, there's no way to know if it'll happen again. It could happen in the middle of a battle."
Tony brushed by without any indication that he'd noticed Steve's pause. "So, just so I know, what are the parameters of this? What level of groping is permitted here?"
"I said no, Steve. End of," Tony says.
Angie smiled at them. "You look good, Rogers."
"For now," Virginia confirmed.
Fury looked at Jessica.
"Yeah, sorry," Steve says, and starts up a conversation about a trashy show he watched that morning. It's nice, and relaxed. And it's more of Bucky than he's seen since the train.
Tony turned to him with a puzzled frown. "Um, yeah. I thought that was pretty clear. But, you know, you're the one who asked me out, so..."
Steve's heart, if he still had one, would have stopped at that. "Like... Like alternate universes?"
"C'mon, you know you wanna get all up on this," Tony said with a deliberately cringe worthy shimmy.
Tony blinked again. "What?" He looked over the box, before recognition lit in his eyes. "Oh! Right. I forgot about this." He raised the lid and peered in. "I was more than a little drunk when I ordered these. And if it helps, my AI took your measurements and got your address to organise the delivery without me being involved. I don't know where you live. I mean, I could find out, but I don't currently know."
Steve elected not to dignify that with a response. He never got into a fight with someone who couldn't hold their own against him. In all fairness, that wasn't a whole lot of people, but he stood by his principles. And he didn't get physical with women or children, no matter how awful they were.
When the judge ordered court mandated anger management sessions Steve could already see the expressions on his friends' faces without turning to look. Bucky would be trying to hold back a laugh, and Peggy would look resigned and not at all surprised. She'd been telling him he needed to get his head shrunk for years.
"Why did you ask me here?" Steve asks. Surely the astral form thing could have been done back at the hospital?
Because Steve's luck was terrible, this happened just as Tony headed towards the VIP entrance.
"Erection, Steve. I have an erection," Tony says. "And if you don't want to be involved with it then you really need to let me go now, because it's getting very involved with you already."
Tony seems to fight very hard not to pull a face when Steve says 'where I'm from', and he almost manages it. "How'd it go down for you?"
It wasn't that he was always angry or that he didn't realise he overreacted sometimes, although he usually only admitted to it when Peggy was giving him unimpressed looks over her first aid kit, it was more that he didn't know how to turn it off. Counting to ten didn't work, neither did the breathing exercises his mother always used to try to get him to use. When he got angry, he got angry. His only options were to express that anger or try to get away from its cause before he could snap. It wasn't always hitting things either. He shuddered at the thought of how much worse that would be. Usually it was just a whole lot of mouthing off, occasionally escalating when the other person (or people) had a temper of their own.
Bruce shifted awkwardly as all eyes turned to him. "The gas station attendant was chatting with the guy in front of me. I just wanted to pay and get out of there."
Steve looks around at the distressingly few remaining members of his team as they look to him for the next move. He doesn't know. He hasn't thought about how to fix it in weeks, since he stopped entirely believing the whole thing was real. In the end, he says the only thing that makes any sense to him anymore. "We need to find Tony."
He actually got someone's number while they were out. Surrounded by Bucky, Peggy and Angie that was unheard of, but Steve somehow went home with a napkin with a name and number scrawled across it by a pretty girl with a shy smile and bright red lipstick.
Steve's eyebrows raise, but he resists the urge to ask about that battle. They have time later. Hopefully.
Steve forces his eyes away from Tony's tired face before he can give himself away.
"Why would they want to send you to another reality?"
"Humouring you how?"
"That's not quite how that one goes," Steve says, mouth curling into a smile at Tony's antics in a way he wishes it wouldn't. Tony isn't his here. Wasn't in the other world either, really. This one belongs with Pepper, the other with his own counterpart. He's ruined any chance of it being another way.
Once Bucky's mission was complete and two pretty girls were stood across from them sipping drinks and laughing at Bucky's antics, Steve's mind went back to Bucky's early line of questioning. It wasn't that Steve thought Bucky was right about Tony, more that now that he thought about it Steve kind of wished he was. He told himself it was mostly for gratification. He wasn't lying about the kinds of people Tony dated, he'd seen some of them in magazine headlines just since he'd known Tony. For Steve to rate attention next to people like that... Not to mention that Tony himself was a very good looking fella. If Steve was into guys he probably would be attracted to Tony. He could imagine it quite clearly.
"You mean, when you started dating Tony," Strange says with a quirk of the lips. "Odd that that should be the base of the branching timelines."
Steve thought he might have a dislocated shoulder when Thor was done.
Tony nodded. "Cool. Okay then. See you next week." He turned to walk backwards halfway to his car. "And remember to do your deep relaxation tonight."
"He is dead," Thor says with a mixture of certainty and sorrow.
Steve didn't go home with a phone number this time, but he had to admit that was at least partially down to his lack of interest. He'd barely tried to talk to the girl Bucky pushed at him, and as always he didn't dance. The girl probably thought he was a total stick in the mud. It didn't bother Steve half so much as it bothered Bucky.
"Okay, maybe I misread the moment," Tony said. "But that seemed like an overreaction. What's going on?"
"Too many people," Nebula replies, voice rougher, harsher than Steve was expecting. "We also need room to hold someone."
Steve opted not to continue. He had nothing else to say anyway, especially not in front of Tony.
Tony waved him off. "Just a little gay panic. We're fine. So... what exactly did you want to happen here?"
Tony scoffed. "Right. Well, tab's still open, help yourself. I'm outta here."
"Huh," Tony says. "I dunno, but he's running late so he better be bringing something to the party."
"Aww, c'mon. Seriously? How did I not know about this before?" Steve complained. "You're usurping my coming out."
"Well, yeah," Tony admitted, somewhat baffled by Steve's approach. "But I'm also attracted to blond, skinny idiots with pretty faces and long fingers. I'm a man of many tastes."
Somehow whatever nervousness Steve had surrounding the situation or his inexperience with men got shoved to the back of his mind at the taste of Tony's mouth, still sweet from the cola they'd had with dinner. The feeling of Tony's arms wrapping strong around him didn't make him feel small or overpowered, but wanted, like Tony wanted him so much he needed to press them together tight enough that nothing could take Steve away.
Tony's arms tightens back up around him. "Of course."
"For me."
Steve's grimace returned.
"Tony!"
"After?" Steve says tentatively. "I don't know if she messed with your head in my world. I never heard anything like that."
"He's pretty unique looking," Tony says. "It didn't take much to piece it together when Nebula told me."
"We're in astral form," Strange says with a hand wave that says he doesn't feel it necessary to explain further. "Your hair is longer."
"I'm not getting into bed with you," Steve says.
"Captain Stark's blood pressure and pulse are elevated, but within safe parameters. Scanning for additional information now," JARVIS replies. And of course it was JARVIS. Steve should have connected that dot sooner, but it's been so long since he heard JARVIS' voice.
The food had arrived promptly and they'd demolished it before they were two thirds of the way through the movie, and so now there was nothing to distract Steve from how far apart they were on the couch. It wasn't a gaping chasm, no dramatic amount of space, but it was at the level Steve might expect from a friend, not a date. As nervous as he'd been when they first sat down, by now he was just frustrated. He may not have experience with guys, or much experience at all, and he may have only admitted to liking Tony or any man very recently, but he wasn't one to shy away from what he wanted. And what he wanted was Tony.
"I can't live my life on the bench, Tony," Steve says.
Tony raised one eyebrow and stared Steve down.
After the success of their last outing, even if Steve had mislaid the girl's phone number, Bucky managed to talk Steve into another night out. This time he didn't even have to enlist Peggy and Angie to get Steve to dress up in the clothes Tony bought. He did, however, have issues getting Steve to do anything with his hair. Steve just wasn't one for the tousled look, he didn't think he could pull it off.
"Captain," Strange replies shortly, before going back to his conversation with Cho.
"What? No. There's no way Virginia will agree to that," Steve argued.
"But at the time, you and I were fighting about the usual stuff, plus me being a breakable human who shouldn't taunt terrorists and I got a little carried away in the redesign," Tony explains. "The stuff I shot up with was barely even the same virus, and it hadn't been tested. So when it started messing with my brain, I may have got a little worried about... possible dementia. Or brain damage. Or death."
"And he won, presumably?"
Fury's gaze turned to Steve and he raised his eyebrows in question.
Bucky sighed and fell over onto the couch. "Just want you to be happy."
Steve nods dumbly, forcing his thoughts away from the word 'husband' and what it implies. Once Tony's out of the room, Steve gets out of the bed himself and digs around until he finds a t-shirt he recognises as his own along with a pair of joggers in his size. He glances to the window, which is either tinted black or is showing an unusually late sunrise for this time of year. "JARVIS? Could you scan the, um, the mansion?"
Steve doesn't know what to do with that, like a lot of the stuff he learns about this world and this world's Steve and Tony. It's too perfect, too flawless. Sure, Tony still built Ultron, but he did it with Steve's knowledge, and he did it with safeguards in place, and they won and JARVIS didn't get destroyed but Vision still got created, and Wanda and presumably Pietro got locked up but neither of them died and they're safe. It's all neat and tied up and nothing like the messy reality he knows.
"Can we go to bed together?" Steve asks, then clarifies, "just to sleep."
Tony smiles and kisses her hair before getting out of bed. Getting the coffee is the least he can do.
And Tony. When he'd first got here, Steve hadn't known how any version of him could marry Tony. Arrogant, vain, flashy Tony. But also, he's discovered, affectionate, dedicated, reasonable Tony, who hasn't pushed him once during this whole ordeal but who has shown him love and support despite his resistance. Tony who hasn't kissed his husband in months, but who hasn't complained or tried to rush anything, who's dated him from scratch as if it's a privilege to do the whole thing over again.
Steve knew he wasn't wrong in calling himself an acquired taste. Between his physical issues and his anger issues he could be a lot to deal with, something Bucky reminded him of often with affectionate quips about angry kittens. Peggy once told him the reason they didn't work out was because Steve was always itching for a fight, and she wasn't wrong. Peggy could hold her own in an argument and did so without trouble, but that didn't mean she wanted to be dragged into Steve's crusades every day, nor that she wanted to get into arguments with him whenever he got stir crazy from bed rest for whatever illness he had this time.
"And you....?" Peggy pressed.
It still isn't easy to fall back to sleep, images of Redskull's face and Thanos's gauntlet and Bucky dying drifting across his mind no matter how hard he tries to dismiss them, but the presence of another human being beside him eases some of the terror the images bring with them and he does eventually slip into the black.
Tony huffs a breath of frustration. "We're not entirely sure. We know Dr. Foster held the reality stone, Loki may well have held the mind stone without the scepter and even if he didn't, that close proximity for-"
It used to be amusing, Bucky's relentless quest to get him a girlfriend, or at the very least laid. Now it was more annoying and humiliating than anything. The lengths Bucky was willing to go to were worrying at times.
"Mhmm," Tony replies. "Ridiculously decadent dessert that this restaurant does spectacularly well. Try some."
A moment later and Steve is back in his body. Or rather the body of the Steve from this world. "Is that it?"
Tony sighed and removed his shades so he could rub at the bridge of his nose. "Look, I don't want to sound like an asshole, but I really don't care. I've got better shit to worry about than a guy not liking me back and-"
Tony didn't seem to be feeling any awkwardness, just delighting in Steve's. He sat calmly watching while Steve fumbled for a way to get from saying to doing, and displayed no inclination to help him out.
"How are we going to look into it?" Steve asks.
"Energy can't be destroyed. It can be dissipated or displaced, but not destroyed. You can't ever go back to our world," Gamora tells him. "I suppose in that way, you have died. You used up all the potential you had in that world, there isn't room for you in it anymore."
"It's basically a gateau," Tony enlightens him, confirming Steve's suspicions and his earlier attempt at deciphering the name. "Just a very expensive one that happens to be the head chef's signature dish."
"You had Thanos here too?" Steve asks. "How did you beat him?"
Fury eyed her like he wasn't sure she was being honest, but whatever he decided he nodded for the next answer.
Virginia rolled her eyes at the address and left.
When it became clear Tony was taking his usual seat after all Natasha took the one next to Steve. When Fury entered he looked genuinely surprised to see the small swap around in seating arrangements but said nothing, taking his usual chair and calling their attention to him. "So far we've concentrated on figuring out what sets you off, what the roots of your behaviour are. This time we're going to be working on actual techniques to keep control when those triggers are pushed."
"I owe you an apology," Steve said at last. "And an explanation if you'll accept one."
"I was in a hospital room. It was dressed up to look like the forties, but I knew something was off. The radio was playing an old game, and everything smelled wrong," Steve begins. "The nurse came in, and she was just... off. I wondered if I'd been captured, so I made a break for it."
Steve froze. "What?"
"What isn't?" Steve asks, undeterred in his quest to get as much cuddly skin on skin as he can.
"It's no problem. Call it an olive branch," Tony said. "Truce?"
"Why would it be just a sex thing?" Steve asked, put on alert by Tony's overly convincing casualness. "I did a whole airport movie moment thing. I know guys like me have to put in a little extra work, but don't you think that'd be taking it a little far for just a sex thing?"
Bruce raised his hand, then looked around nervously and dropped it again. "I get out of control. It's like I can't think straight."
"Old Buckeroo doing okay?" Tony asks. He pulls away from the curb and joins the mild after lunch traffic. The question actually sounds genuine, as it always does from this Tony.
Peggy patted his knee comfortingly. "Did you tell him you wanted to kiss him?"
"Don't underestimate him," Steve warns.
"Yeah, after weeks of making it clear you thought I was an arrogant, self centred jerk," Tony replied.
"Because no matter what problems we have, you and I together, we're pretty good at solutions," Steve says confidently. Then softly, "I need you. The whole universe does."
"Please never use the phrase 'hot bod' again," Steve said. "And again. Airport. Big romantic scene, remember?"
Steve took an empty plastic seat in the circle and waited for something to happen.
"What am I going to do? Try to stop you?" Tony scoffs. "It'd be pointless even trying, but I wouldn't anyway. The guy's been through a lot."
"Am I right in thinking your words were directed toward Anthony?" Thor asked
Virginia's gaze turned coldly considering. "You might consider some introspection. What you did," she shook her head. "The only reasons I can think of are that you wanted to hurt Tony, which seems plausible but unlikely, or that you have some self-discovery to do before you're ready to face your true motivations. Either way, stay away from Tony until you can figure it out."
He was wearing the skinny jeans and a Superman t-shirt at the next group session and had to grit his teeth when Tony whistled at him.
"Just... Take them back." Steve had no idea what Tony was talking about, but the gist of it being that Tony didn't know his personal details was a little reassuring.
"I don't know."
"Earth," Tony says. "Pick up Dr. Foster. I know Thor wants to do it, but he's on Loki duty, and if he's around I'll never get to talk science to her."
Steve snorted in disgust. "You can't even take responsibility for your own actions."
Steve chuckles and noses into Tony's neck.
"Thor told us," Natasha says. "He sounded pretty sure. Thanos killed him."
Fury's glare was back, but this time Tony didn't back down. "Do I have to remove you from this group?" Fury asked at last.
"You're also insanely thoughtful and generous, and I don't just mean with your money, occasionally funny, and yes, you do have a the hottest bod," Steve said.
"I just didn't want to leave it until the next group therapy session, if you even turned up, and have to go through another hour of awkwardness before I even had a chance to speak to you," Steve continued.
"My what now?"
Sunglasses guy shook his head. "So you're out of a job now?"
It takes far more convincing to get Pepper to give up access to FRIDAY so they actually have a way to track him down once they're up there. In the end it's Thor who manages it, Pepper having refused to even speak to Natasha, and only talking to Steve long enough to tell him the whole thing is his fault. She doesn't have any reason to dislike Thor, and like the majority of the galaxy, she's easily charmed by him.
Tony put the box on the floor and turned back to where he was talking about something that sounded far too complicated to be coming out of Tony's immaculately groomed face with Bruce.
Tony sighs. "Yeah, I know. But I don't know how to get around this one. I won't put the team at risk because you don't like being sidelined. I won't put you at risk, either. I know you can take care of yourself, but there's so much about the way we operate that you just don't know anymore."
Tony pouts. "I want a turn. I've never flown a spaceship before." He stops. "Well, not one that wasn't crashing at the time."
"Fine. Then we'll just stay like this all tense and worried against the doctor's orders," Tony grumbles, but he doesn't seem surprised.
If Steve steered them back towards the club they bumped into Tony in last time, well it was a good club. Nothing wrong with that. He also wanted to see if Tony was right and the bouncer would let him in now he was dressed nicely.
