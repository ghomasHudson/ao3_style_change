Tony leaned back into the bed as Steve shifted himself into his arms. Steve positioned himself over Tony and then pressed his body into him so they were touching from their chests to their legs. They both were starting to harden and rubbed into each other to encourage the process along.
Steve narrowed his eyes and asked, “Why are you dragging this out? Why keep me alive? If you’re going to destroy me just do it already. Why all the theatrics?”
It hurt more than it should have to ixnay a way to save Peter but Tony could not lose one of the most important people in his life to save another just as important person. And if it did not work and Tony lost both of them, he really doubted he could go on living. Losing Peter had nearly destroyed him. He could not imagining surviving if he lost Steve too.
His wrist was bare, not even a tan line was there to mark where the watch had been there only minutes ago.
not married. The stupid law was being debated in the courts at that moment but it felt like it was taking forever...Did he fix this before the marriage too?
“Am I the reason you haven’t moved on? Are you staying behind because I am such a royal fuck up? Do you think you can fix me?”
“…Are you upset? And not by this, this is devastating, but…by the interview?” Tony asked curiously, his voice rumbling more through the Iron Man speakers.
“We’re going to come out and get married all in one night,” Tony said. “…Actually, we’re planning to do it in two days. We wanted to do it tomorrow but Pepper would kill us if we gave her such short notice!”
He handed the duffle bag to Steve and said to the super soldier, “I’ll expect a full report about what really occurred in the past. Stark was not very forthcoming but I hope we’ll have a better conversation. Take this as a token of our future appreciation.”
“Wait…” Peter raised his head and looked suspiciously at Tony and Steve. He asked, “Then why are you two here?”
“Not anymore,” Steve murmured indignantly. He had not worked for SHIELD since Hydra was discovered in their ranks. He and the Avengers may work with them whenever the world was in peril but they no longer took orders from them…
The video switched to a different camera. Jarvis focused the image on a pair of feet walking into the screen. It revealed jeans and then the dark sweater. And then…Steve.
Peter’s grip tightened exponentially. Wade lightly patted the top of their conjoined hands and cheerfully greeted, “Heyia, Mr. Stark!”
Steve shivered. Bucky must have been restating something that had been said to him. He clenched his fists and his nails bit into his skin. He wanted to tear into whoever said these things to his friend.
Mary entered cautiously. She opened the door slowly and regarded the men before her with a steady stare. She was tense with square shoulders and her mouth was clenched in a hard, thin line.
He did not know they were home until Happy had opened the door and lightly touched his shoulder. Upon looking to him, Happy smiled sadly at him and stated, “We’re back.”
Tony shot Steve. He felt the pressure change in his blasters as they cut through his body. Everything that was under the heart of the blasters must have been destroyed: flesh, bone, organs…How much could Steve heal? How much could he survive before it was too much?
“Give me ten minutes and if I’m not back by then, then you can come in with all of your American Glory,” Tony said dryly, dislodging Steve's hand from his side.
He leaned heavily into her and tried to take comfort from her nearness but…but all he could think about was Steve.
This was going to be way harder than facing down Schmidt or a nefarious villain. With those guys it was actually easy, you fight and one wins. There was no winning for Steve or Tony when it came to what they wanted from their relationship.
Steve took off his shirt and tied off the bottom to make it into a makeshift bag and then used it to collect the pieces in it to keep them all together. The main body of the reactor was the first piece he added and it was crumbled like a balled up piece of paper. It made Steve uneasy. How on Earth was Cable going to fix this?
Tony’s words prompted Steve to round the counter. He kept his hand in Tony’s the entire way. Tony started off with being adorable but his proclamation made Steve want to smother the rest of Tony’s words with his mouth.
going wrong. Steve and Bucky were going to die; Tony was dying; and now Howard was meddling in his business thanks to Steve.
Peter sighed to himself and then turned to his boyfriend. Wade was still in his cocoon. Practically all of the blankets on the bed were wrapped around him. Peter asked with a smile, “How am I supposed to cuddle with you with all of that in the way?”
Uncle Thor paused several blocks away, floating above the skyscraper, and surveyed the area. Peter took the opportunity to asked, “Where are we going to go?”
Steve glanced up to Tony and saw the pained emotion in his eyes. Tony squeezed his hand and reminded him, “Babe, to me, just a couple of days ago
Bucky grasped the side of Steve’s face and whispered, “I was always behind you, always watching.” Bucky crouched over Steve and grabbed his jaw tightly and hissed, “I could not let that bastard kill you.
“I know you will be,” she whispered. “You're a strong boy, like your Uncle Ben. One day you'll look back on this and laugh.”
…Steve told her about him wanting to masturbate to the photos. That was the only way she could have known. So was Natasha being protective of her friend or…was Steve interested in making this fake relationship…real?
Peter was wrong about the texture of his lips. They were rough around the edges but his kiss was soft. It was like the gentlest of caresses, as if Peter were something precious. Even his hands held him softly. It made whatever annoyance he felt from their mess up of a first kiss melt away and Peter was lost to the feeling of being so perfectly cherished by another being.
His voice was broken. He might not want them to do it but he knew they would take it all again. He was strong, a super solider, and to control him they must have taken memories away from him along with his freedom. He knew it and accepted it.
Tony rolled his eyes and grumbled, “I’m not like that any more. I’ve gone and fell in love with Captain America for crying out loud!”
She had only just recently discovered the connection Steve had to her soulmate. The day she found out she went straight to her rooms and looked him up online, knowing there had to be pictures of him with Steve during World War II.
He was not allowed a name and, if he had one, it did not matter. His master decided he did not need one so that was that.
“I know right?” Clint cut in. “Out of all of us, I always assumed Tony would be the one with a rugrat crawling around not Steve. Steve would be the las—!”
Wade glanced at the time glove and murmured, “Right about…” There was a distant explosion and then the building rumbled around them. Wade withdrew both of his katanas and said, “Now.”
He pulled back but as their eyes met, Steve and Tony automatically pulled together again and kissed. It was the first time they shared a real, honest-to-God kiss between each other without the shadow of it being fake in the background. They held each other like their lives depended on it and pressed into each other so tightly they could barely breathe.
Steve watched him go and then put the food into the fridge. He paused and looked down at his hand, examining the ring that will forever be adorning it now.
“…Okay, but wait a moment,” Tony said and he slipped from Steve’s side to quickly remove his shoes and pants. Upon Steve’s sleepy scrutiny, Tony explained, “I’m going to lay with you until you wake and if you don’t wake up I’m going to leave your side and you sure as hell better wake or so help me…I –
Dad had been screaming over Uncle Bucky’s communicator moments before the explosion and his yells had been filled with desperation and horror that made Peter’s blood run cold. But with the explosion, his father’s screams fell silent and it unnerved Peter more.
Tony raced across the room and to Steve’s side. His eyes fearfully took in the dark splotches and his eyes grew larger as he saw the big one on his back. He grabbed Steve’s hands and gasped, “Are you becoming one too? Are you going to turn into Venom??”
He leaned back, listening to the reporter talk about Tony’s supposed sickness, while he watched the last of the renderings to his new suit unfold. He frowned a little listening her talk about his "mental" breakdown. Why was it crazy for him to not bring any more weapons of mass destruction into the world?
It was hard at first being separated so from Peter. Steve had not left Peter’s side since he first met his son at two-years-old. It hurt hearing from Peter about his new friends that they could never meet, especially more so when he got a crush on his cubby-mate, a girl named Gwen Stacey. They could never meet the girl or any of his other kindergarten friends but that did not stop Tony from researching all of them. He probably knew more about Peter’s friends and their parents than the children knew themselves.
Steve’s intuition instantly screamed something was wrong. SHIELD had them on speed dial. Steve asked, “Are their communications down?”
Steve kissed him to silence the inane babbling for a moment and then he chuckled, “You are ridiculous.”
Tony relaxed with his promise and nuzzled his head back into the juncture of Steve’s shoulder. He whispered, “We’ll find a way, Steve…”
They were in D.C. and driving home would take a few hours so Happy took them to a nearby hotel that Pepper must have approved. No reporters were outside but, come morning, Tony knew many would be waiting outside for them, looking for answers about what had occurred between them in the hospital.
“Captain Rogers testified, under oath, that he did not touch this woman. Could someone else have taken the sample and placed it on the dress?”
And…Tony sighed again, slightly shaking his head. His mind was coming up with all sorts of wild theories and foolish ideas. But his father was looking at him like this, not because he was his future son, but because he was a key to an advanced knowledge.
With that thought his mood soured…but only slightly. After tonight, he was reminded to not wallow in the past or what could have been. There was nothing they could do to stop the trial or change the fact that they did not start dating two years ago. The only thing that mattered was the present and Steve was presently very much in love with the man in his arms.
The tour had ended with returning to the living room but Wade did not extract himself from Peter’s back. He nuzzled his face into Peter's neck and asked, "What shall we do now?"
"It might not work. If Natasha doesn't die, the soul stone might disappear," Steve whispered fearfully. "This can create a paradox,
Steve nodded in satisfaction and then changed the subject as he pulled up photos Bucky took during the mission.
Loki stood by the railing holding Peter over the side and watching the toddler cry. Peter’s feet kicked uselessly at the open air and his strong, tiny hands were clenched over his head. Steve felt his gut plummet down the hundreds of stories Peter could fall. All Loki needed to do was relax his grip and Peter would fall hundreds of stories to his death.
Out of the two of them, Steve should have been able to find someone. His heart was so big and filled with so much care and love that anyone who’d take him would have been the happiest person in the world. He had always imagined Steve meeting a girl with a zeroed out implant and both of them falling in love and starting a family and getting a dog…just living the American dream, despite the odds stacked against them. If anyone could do it, it was Steve. Now he replaced that imagined woman with a man and gone were the kids, gone was the picket fence, and all he saw for Steve was more grief than he deserved.
Get to know the man who had an affair with his mom and then left her once she got pregnant with Peter?
“…You are not leading this where I think you are leading this,” she threatened. The arms crossed against her chest tightened.
Cable offered him a razor and shaving cream when his scruff became noticeable, but Steve forwent it, not wanting to shave until their mission was done and Tony was safe. When his growing beard itched, he’d imagine Tony’s reaction to it and his fingers running through the coarse hair. With the serum, everything in him was faster, including his hair growth so within the week the scruff was gone. He trimmed his beard so he didn’t look shaggy but didn’t touch his hair…he just pulled it back when it got too long like Bucky had in the 21st century.
Steve lightly drew the backs of his knuckles just above Tony’s reactor where Tony’s skin was scarred from numerous occasions. The dark veins from his palladium poisoning were gone but a few left behind faint white marks. Steve traced one of those marks, probably remembering the last time they were together...it had technically been decades ago though, to Tony it’d felt only months.
“When are you going to let him play with kids his own age?” Tony asked, knowing exactly where Steve was looking.
With Steve’s fingers clutching tightly at the bedsheets and no longer teasing his body, Tony moved down to give Steve’s lower half with his complete attention. He kept one hand on his cock and then stuck a lube-soaked finger into his hole. Steve back arched up and Tony patiently waited for him to stop cursing as the warming spread into his sensitive insides.
Coulson stepped forward. Good, one of the few SHIELD agents he could stand. Cable nodded to the future Director of SHIELD and said, “Hello, Agent Coulson.”
They ended up ordering out and got Thai delivered for dinner and stole some of Thor’s strawberry mochi for dessert. They ate in the early evening so it would not be too cold as they ate on the roof and watched the sky as the sun set. The buildings around them glimmered and the rosy glow of dusk swashed all within its sight with its flushed hue.
Peter felt colder without Venom. Before the last of the mass left him, Peter’s hand closed on reflex and he willed some of Venom to stay with him. That little bit wrapped itself around his wrist and warped into a dark-faced watch.
Tony was nestled into his side. His head lay on his chest and Steve’s arm was wrapped protectively across his back. Tony had hooked his leg around Steve’s and had drawn it between his legs. He could not believe it but Tony had a hard-on pressed against his thigh.
Howard unhappily looked down at the failed formulas he worked on the night before and he once again darkly wondered what the future held for Howard and, eventually, the family he’d have.
“I love everything about you,” Tony whispered, crossing his arms behind Steve’s neck. Steve drew his arms around Tony’s back and kissed him.
A hologram opened above one of the worktables and Tony scrambled over to the screen as Jarvis opened the video. The team came up behind him and Natasha lay a supporting hand on his shoulder.
“’Throw my pillow at you,’” Steve quoted in a tease and Tony growled into his flesh. Steve chuckled as he closed his eyes and lay his head on top of Tony’s.
“Get out of there you two!” Steve said. He saw battle-ready helicopters flying in on the flat screen and his heart dropped. He yelled, “MOVE!”
“Ah, ah, ah,” Kilian tutted, pointing his gun at Pepper’s head. “Move another step and she’s dead. You two are friends, aren’t you?”
Steve’s fingers twitched against him when he mentioned the surgery but he did not pause in the wrapping. He asked, “Are you a soldier?”
They all spoke at once, their voices merging into one large noise that was utterly indistinguishable.
Peter glanced behind him at the rather large crack in the glass. A normal person would have probably been hurt…
,” Bucky cursed. “Why didn't you say anything, punk?” He sighed heavily, rubbing his forehead, and demanded, “Tell me everything.”
Steve’s gut dropped at Gabe’s words. He quickly looked to Peggy and saw the confusion in her eyes too as she processed Tony’s words. He then looked to Bucky and Bucky met his gaze with alarm growing in his expression.
The Winter Soldier got up in the meanwhile and walked across the bridge, to where Steve had knocked away his gun, and picked it up.
Tony focused on the closest soldier with a ray gun. He was firing at any moving figure and already destroyed two jeeps, killing the men inside. Tony moved without a second thought.
‘I am sorry, Ms. Potts,’ Jarvis interrupts. ‘Mr. Stark is currently unavailable and has demanded no interruptions. He has put his workshop in lockdown.’
'Jesus Christ!' Tony's voice comes back to him immediately. 'For fucks sake, Cap, this is a little delicate, can you not make me jump?'
'Whichever,' Tony dismisses. 'Are you coming with me or do you need to deal with the reports coming out of R&D?'
'In fairness to sir, on this occasion, it cost nothing as it was already in his possession,' Jarvis replies. 'To truly answer your question, however, I would estimate its value in the region of fifteen million dollars. Conservatively.'
She’d heard rumors of a super soldier working in the shadows for the KGB. They called him the Winter Soldier and he never missed his mark. It seemed those rumors weren’t false and the man himself just happened to be her soulmate. But…her side throbbed from the bullet wound in her side. She pressed her hand over it to staunch the bleeding. He supposedly never missed his mark and she was the first to not receive a kill shot. Was it really because he wanted to question her on her motive? He could have just told his master she attacked him. What if he had inherently known she was his mate?
“You keep your controller to the left and I’ll keep mine to the right,” Wade murmured into his ear. He pressed himself against Peter’s back and Peter inhaled sharply when he felt Wade’s arousal press into him.
Marcel provided his own therapist to testify about Tyler’s mania. She stated that her symptoms had nothing to do with trauma but from an ongoing mental disease. The doctor had interviewed, Tyler prior to trial, and was assuming she suffered schizophrenia but could not say so definitely without further sessions.
However, he barely noted it with the tremendous emotional pain of having Peter ripped out of his arms constricting his heart.
Steve grinned and growled like Peter as he said, “I like the lion!” He attacked Peter, curling his fingers like claws and tickled Peter. Peter laughed excitedly and kicked in his arms.
Bruce adjusted his glasses nervously and nodded. They plunged into the equally dark and narrow corridor with no more than a whisper.
He and Solo stuck an odd, unspoken deal. Solo taught him how to live out on the streets and about the new century he found himself in without question. Steve protected Solo from the less friendly homeless and from his own mind.
Steve should have been worried about the Hulk. He should have been evacuating the room and trying to calm Bruce but he could not calm himself. He was their leader and he was supposed to be clearheaded in any situation. But he did not give a damn about anything but Peter at that moment.
Tony was his soulmate. he should have trusted him instead of jumping to conclusions. they both had pasts...Hell, Steve denied he was gay for years. Neither of them were perfect...
Tony grasped his hand and led him the rest of the way to their bedroom. Once in the room, Tony spun back around and wound his arms around Steve.
Tony’s mind was racing at full throttle at the possibilities. More to himself, he said, “I could get something like that for Pete…”
It was titled, “The Victims on all Sides” and would become the image to represent the marginalized problem of mental health in the United States. To the masses, it represented a sadly recurring theme in the country that needed attention, but to Steve it epitomized the worst day of his life.
However, after listening to Peter and Bruce’s conversation and hearing the level of emotional pain Peter was in, she was shocked to learn it could go
The man’s smirk rose a tad on the right and he replied, “Rhodes is enjoying the company of the Mandarin. And you are only in the way of my fallback target.”
Peter knew Friday would tell his parents he was there the moment he had stepped into the building. When neither first appeared, he had assumed they were giving him his space. How long had Tony been out there?
“No, you are involved. When you put your mind to something, you can accomplish anything!” Steve argued the very thing that gave him hope, because his soulmate was amazing. If anyone could do this, it was Tony.
Howard pulled back from the hug, smiling happily at him. He tapped Tony’s chest, right above his heart again, and murmured, “I am fine with that. As long as I know
“I need to speak with Tony privately,” Steve murmured to Peggy, lightly squeezing her arm. She jutted her lip but her expression held the promise of getting answers later. He nodded to her and then looked to Bucky.
“Yeah…I'm sticking with the Commandos,” Tony dryly murmured to his father and Steve grinned triumphantly at Howard. Howard melodramatically shook his head and sulked off. Tony had to hold in his laughter at the sight.
The plane landed in the meantime and several bodies jumped and flew out of the plane. One in particular, walked toward them with a heavy tread.
When Tony woke, he woke with a clearer mind that was quick to examine the events that transpired before he fell asleep. The effects of the alcohol in his system were mostly gone and the slight headache it left him with could be cured with some aspirin.
Barnes hovered in the background, making the hair stand up on the back of Tony’s neck despite the uneasy truce they’d called.
Since then a week had passed, in which, Steve never left his son’s side. He had to fill out an abundant amount of paperwork, promise to let Bruce watch his development, and swear to check in with the SHIELD Science Division bi-monthly. It was an intrusion into his life but it was all worth it.
“Peter stopped him,” Steve whispered, tracing his son’s form on the screen. He turned to Bruce and Steve clarified, “They
Peter sighed and closed his eyes, nuzzling his face into Steve’s chest. His skeletal hand rose and lightly touched his chest where Steve’s dog tag was beneath his shirt.
After that, Tony had to be thinking of backing out, Steve knew it. Was it too late? Only the lawyers knew and they hadn’t even told the rest of the Avengers yet. They could pretend this never happened and find him someone else to be in a fake relationship with.
Tony kept kissing him, but his hands trailed down, carefully pulling off Steve’s layers. Steve did the same, keeping their kiss slow and loving and their movements easy so not to disturb their mouths.
Tony grasped his arm and murmured, “Jarvis is checking on anyone who’d be classified as your ‘friend.’ Peggy was the first and Jarvis says she’s fine.”
“He has some stuff at my place already, but I’ll send Pepper by in a few days to pick up whatever more Peter might need.”
The flash drive did not lead them to Nazi zombies, but, it did lead them into the Nazi/Hydra equivalent of Skynet which Tony thought was pretty awesome. Until Zola, a Terminator-wannabe, tried to kill them. But then again, the 90s-animated supercomputer lived up to its super villain persona and told them its evil plan before trying to kill them.
“…He’s right, though” Steve murmured wetly to Peter. His mind reflected to Tony’s caring nature and how upset he would be to see them in such a state. “Tony would not want this…”
With a warm, loving voice, Steve reminded him, “I’m here now and forever, love. I’m here to stay day and night. I’m here.”
“You think this was the reason Norman is letting Harry here? To scope out your lab?” Steve questioned. Harry had been coming to the tower for years. Steve doubted Norman would keep putting any spy technology on his son if that was his original intent.
“You are not doing this at this hour,” Steve moaned. Steve lifted one of his arms off Tony’s side and wearily rubbed his face.
“Holy Crap, it’s Cap,” the Clint hissed as his eyes focused on the image. In a blur of motion, he drew out his phone with quick reflexes.
“If these days are my last, I don’t want to spend them denying what we are…You’re my soulmate, Steve,” Tony whispered, he turned his head and kissed the palm of Steve’s hand that cupped his cheek. “I don’t just want you…I
He was instantly reminded of crying into Sam’s shoulder over the man who currently held him and flushed.
They propelled themselves across the living room. Their hands never leaving the other’s body and their mouths only separating to catch a much needed breath. Steve fell back onto the couch and Tony fell on him, the motion elected another groan from Steve. He loved the feeling of all of Tony’s weight on him.
Even with the ice covering him, the color to his skin and remaining clothing stood out in stark contrast to the white landscape and he was spotted within minutes.
Steve was looking deeply into his eyes and gently ran his thumb over his cheek. He broke the eye contact with a sigh and enfolded him to his core within his limbs. Tony nestled into his embrace and, in the warmth of Steve’s arms, felt like his heart would finally slow down.
Tony crossed the room and entered the kitchen. He worriedly kept an eye on Steve as he went to the coffee pot. He poured out a mug for himself and then scurried over to the other side of the counter to get a barrier between himself and his…friend?
Jarvis directed Tony to Bucky’s location, which was where Tony usually found him most days, on the private balcony outside Bucky’s room. The metal shutters were up all over the house and had been for a long time, attesting to Bucky’s feeling of safety in Tony’s home. Tony saw him through the windows, lounging on his chair reading his latest history book by the faint light of the setting sun.
The others checked in and were being delayed by masked men who shot at them. But Steve and Tony had yet to meet any opponents.
, anyone home?” Tony said sarcastically, stepping closer to Steve. Steve jerked back and Tony’s brows shot up in surprise. He raised his hands in a calming motion and placated, “Hey, I mean no harm. I just want to make sure you mean no harm to me either…I can’t find any information on you and, since my movie trivia is up to date, that usually means you’re either a hitman, in the witness protection program, or an alien intent on invading Earth. Who are you, Enigma? What do you want with me?”
Both Tony and Peter had already been cleared. Tony had a few scrapes and bruises and Peter was relatively unaffected but that was probably because he had inherited Steve’s healing factor.
”You love me?” Tony pressed, cupping his jaw. “You’ve said it before but...” Tony’s eyes searched his and then he whispered, “This is different, isn’t it?”
“Mmmm,” Tony hummed, lightly running his fingers down Steve’s smooth back. “Sounds like a very good future to me.”
He led them up a stairwell and then stopped her two levels down. He whispered, “The lab is through here.” She nodded and went to open the door but he stopped her. She looked at him questionably and he continued, “The technicians in there have a series of words they can say to immobilize me. We have to take them down as soon as possible.”
“I don’t know. Venom tried to eat Stark too and their fight was dragged outside,” Mary replied. “It was so wild that Stark did not even notice Venom expel you from his body.”
Howard’s jaw dropped and Tony hugged him one last time. He murmured to him, “Keep working on finding me the cure for my poisoning and never stop your search for Steve.”
“Tony,” Steve disbelievingly whispered his husband’s name under his breath. What was he doing here??
MJ had messaged him late last night asking him if: “This was for real?” and forwarded him a copy of his birthday invitation.
Just as he lightly bit down on Tony’s collarbone, Tony reached out and carded his fingers through Steve’s hair. Steve glanced up and met Tony’s gaze. Tony whispered, “I love you too, beloved.”
Fury shook his head and murmured, “Of course you found yourself mated Captain America, Stark. Go big or go home.”
Peter grinned, liking that he was able to make this larger, stronger man, quake with a simple noise. He hummed noncommittedly and turned his head, recapturing Wade’s lips. And, because he liked to tease Wade, he let off a tiny moan of pleasure for victoriously reclaiming Wade’s mouth.
“It’s been a month since your timers went off and you’re still…not, well, a couple,” she replied. “It’s…” She grappled for a word. “It’s…”
“You were amazing,” Steve told him with a light squeeze. Steve blushed and dropped his eyes. He whispered, “I wish I could have done more for you…”
Tony tossed the blankets off his legs and got off the cot with a groan. He was moving so stiffly that Bucky swooped in to help him straighten. Tony tensed at his touch but relaxed and let Bucky help him to his feet.
“Hey, babe, what’s going on?” Steve asked, strolling into the lab. Steve’s fingers traced over Tony’s equipment, caressing it without disrupting any of the sensitive materials as he approached Tony. Steve knew enough about Tony’s projects how to touch them in the right way. Tony watched his fingers and shivered with their progress. After all of these years, even the little things Steve did made him want him more. He hoped he wasn’t going to screw this up.
Tony reached over to him and adjusted one of the metals on his chest. Steve wore his formal, tan military uniform and Tony was wearing his most expensive suit.
“How am I supposed to live on knowing it was all brought about by sacrificing my best friend’s life?! No matter what happens now the future is bleak to me!”
“Did…Did you two have a nice talk? Uh, was the coffee good?” Tony asked awkwardly. "You two had coffee, right? It's like your thing."
Steve and Pepper shared a chuckle and then exchanged a knowing smile at Tony’s expense. At that moment, he knew he and Pepper were going to get along fine.
Steve broke their kiss with a chuckle as Tony’s roaming fingers tickled his sides. He ran his fingers through Tony’s hair and murmured, “What are you doing?”
Steve and Tony exchanged shocked glances. Mary seemed to be tolerating their attentions today and yesterday she could barely believe Peter existed. Steve nervously chewed his lip. Tony nodded, giving him the go-ahead with the answer.
!” Pepper steeped into the room and her face paled as her eyes focused on them. She spun around, facing away from them, and hissed, “Tony! He just got back!! You couldn’t wait five minutes!?”
Around noon, there was a call over the police scanner about a deceased male with egregious injury found in Brooklyn.
He knew the feel of Venom’s jabs and the damage they wrought. Hell, he was still recovering from the latest punctures but, never in a million years, did he think the symbiote to turn on Peter like that! Hyperventilating, Wade fell forward, just catching himself with his hands and gasped, “Baby boy?!” Could he hear him?? Venom had torn apart Wade’s insides, had he not had his advanced healing ability, he’d be dead right now.
Pepper’s flush grew a little redder and she snipped, “Sorry to interrupt Tony-Funtime but you need to preoccupy yourself with getting in front of the press instead of getting into Steve’s pants!”
“Tonight…” Steve began, his tongue feeling thick in his mouth. Tony side-glanced at him and his brows rose in question when Steve struggled to find his words. Blushing like a virgin he most definitely was not, Steve looked down at the basket of coals in his arms and murmured, “Tonight…why don’t we spend it in my room before...you know, I don’t have one anymore.”
Natasha reached over and pressed the power button on the remote, turning off the television. She murmured, “Perhaps it would be best to not watch TV for a while.”
Things are awkward at first. There was no escaping it. Tony and Bucky may have forgiven each other but the history was there between them and they had to figure out how to operate around each other again with this new baggage. But…they did it.
He walked over to Steve and stared into his eyes as if he was daring him to break eye contact. He leaned over the tub and placed a hand high on Steve’s thigh for leverage. As he turned on the tub, he gripped him tightly and his hold curled inward coming within centimeters of his crotch. Tony arched his back as he turned on the water and Steve squirmed under his touch, moaning lightly in the back of his throat as his eyes trailed down his naked backside. He was so tempted to reach out and pull Tony into him but held back. The doctor told him not to do anything physical and if he tired Tony would put an end to the little game they were playing. And Steve still had yet to make any moves yet.
“Fine,” Steve said and Tony grinned. Steve’s heart instantly swooned at the sight. How could he already be pinning for his smile? Steve bit his lip and added, “Tony?”
Tony leaned back, slipping out of Steve’s gentle clasp. He felt exhausted, so he whispered, “I think I need to sleep...”
Steve closed his eyes and imagined him and Tony as old men, leaning into each other and sharing mutual smiles as they watched young versions of Peter running around.
Tony was not searching the city grid nor obsessing over any little tidbit of information. No, Tony was ordering takeout just like it was a normal night, like their son was not turned into a monster and trying to eat innocent people.
Peter pointed to the picture from his birthday which Steve had snapped of both of them eating giant cake slices. Harry looked at the entire wall first starting at their picture then spanning to take the rest in.
Century without your guidance. And you and your smile gives me hope for a future…a future I could never have with Bucky.”
Howard arrived first and wasn’t prepared for the entire team of the Howling Commandos jumping out of the Jeep, but he was more unprepared for the fragile looking version of his future son. He deteriorated much more in the days since he left. He barely recognized him. He didn’t even wake as Dum Dum helped Jim move the stretcher with him on it out of the back of the Jeep.
Grinning triumphantly, Pepper stated, “We can prepare the press statements and have them released while they are at the party.” Turning to Coulson, she said, “We can also schedule interviews with the major news conglomerates so they will not be overly accosted when they leave! We can control this, Phil, and Steve will be safe in the Tower. It’s the safest building in New York.”
Tony lightly ran his thumb over Steve’s knuckles and whispered, “I will do all within my power to make sure you won’t suffer this new future.”
He had raced there after the battle and begged two women to get off it, quickly explaining his need for it. They ecstatically relinquished the bench to him and hovered nearby to witness his first meeting with his soulmate. He ignored them in favor of wiping his sweaty palms on his trousers. Because of the battle, he felt completely unprepared for his mate.
“Neither of us are…heck, we still have glass on the floor at home and we don’t even have a wall in the kitchen! He can crawl out into open air! It’s nowhere near baby proof!! But…But I don’t want to give him up…” Steve inserted one of his fingers into Peter’s tiny palm and Peter tightly grasped it. “I wanted…want to start a family with you, Tony…and both of us expected it would happen later but you know our luck with timelines.”
Tony tossed Peter the ring case and his son caught it. He looked at what he caught and his eyes widened. He quickly opened it and gasped, “Woah…How are you going to do it?”
When they reached the floor, the doors opened and they could hear the raised voices. Bruce flinched and said, “I think I am going to wait here…Jarvis can tell me when it’s safe to approach.”
“WHO DARES ATTACK US?!” Thor demanded, clutching his hammer in front of him, ready to attack wearing only a loincloth. Peter twitched awake at Thor’s exclamation and peered sleepily at the gathered company.
Tony shook his head and pressed his fevered forehead against Steve’s arm as if hiding would solve the problem.
Tony tried to relax against him but Steve was suddenly kissing him. First, gently on the top of his head, but then he pulled Tony’s head back and his lips trailed down his face until he reached his mouth. Steve’s mouth was hot and wet and he softly but thoroughly kissed Tony, making his toes curl.
Steve sat up straighter and Bucky's expression became blank. Steve recognized it as the expression Tony called the "Winter Soldier stare." It was a dead stare, devoid of emotion. Bucky hadn't used it in years. He had only slipped into that headspace when he was in a strong emotional state.
“So you two met at the V.A.?” Tony asked. Tony didn’t even know Steve was attending V.A. meetings. What else did he not know about the super soldier?
“He’s my soulmate, obviously,” Tony would reply for him and they’d move on, both smothering chuckles at the reporters’ expense.
He healed slowly due to the cold but his eyes were moving, taking in the cell as he planned his escape.
He got a little queasy but the flight was over before he knew it. It usually would have taken him much longer through his usual route with public transportation.
'No! It wasn't his fault; he told Pete not to open the cabinet under the bar and I freaked out,' Tony snaps. 'Can we drop it now?'
‘What can I say? I needed a hug,’ he smirks; his expression daring Steve to comment that that is exactly what he wanted.
'I'm on my way and yes; like we discussed. And get some photos of me near a hospital on the internet dated over the last few months. Make them the normal 'omg it's Tony Stark!' postings and we'll see if anyone joins the dots and guesses about Jim.'
'You work really fast,' Bruce shakes his head again, impressed. 'So, if this second baby is yours...'
'I already told you you'd get a repeat performance,' Tony tells him as Steve stares hopelessly at the alley wall.
'I don't,' he agrees quickly, 'no, Steve is... But this is my kid, Pep; aren't I supposed to do everything I can to provide for him?'
This of course allows Pete to roll over his right arm and resettle with his back against Steve’s side.
Steve had actually forgotten that there are four other ‘people’ in the room with them. Dummy is looking at him strangely.
'Alright then,' Tony opts to ignore him and just steal his phone. 'They're good,' he approves as he flicks through the couple of shots Steve has taken before handing the phone back.
Steve hopes the sudden warmth he feels at the mere concept of having a family doesn't show on his face,
‘Oh. Oh! Jarvis, are you upset with me too? Because of my reaction to you being… you when I was downstairs?’
'What about Florida?' Pepper gestures. 'What about the coding meeting? The publicity shots for the Gala? The budget meeting on Monday?'
'When you referred to them as a pack of short sighted jackasses with all the forethought and technical knowhow of llamas I'm sure you meant it with the highest level of affection.'
'Sir would undoubtedly agree with you,' Jarvis sounds amused. 'Perhaps you would like to go to the other room where you can play with the toy cars Agent Barton has brought down from the penthouse?'
'Just tell me if you don't like it,' Tony shrugs and rests on one elbow as he sticks a finger into his mouth. 'All right?'
Steve howls and his hips snap up as he empties himself down Tony's throat. His hands clench tight into the bedding and he stares blindly up at the ceiling,
Pete is quickly enamoured with the little toy cars and sends them shooting off in all directions across the polished floor. Tony sits cross legged next to him as he puts stabilisers onto the shiny red bike and Steve shakes his head before starting to remove various toys from their packaging.
Steve has his hands fisted in the material of Tony's t-shirt and he kisses enthusiastically as Tony tows him out of the lift and walks backwards into the lower penthouse. Tony turns the soldier as he reaches the sofa, he tugs down Steve's clothing and then pushes him down into the seat.
'Well, yes,' Pepper smiles. 'But I'm sure one of his main reasons, which he hasn't actually admitted to, is that he thinks Steve will want to take the baby.'
'Cap's a morning person,' Tony tells her, as if that explains everything. 'I'd generally find that offensive but he feeds my kid breakfast so I let it slide.'
'Because...' Steve visibly squares his shoulders even as he lowers his voice, 'because we're about to become a family and I can't just ignore that. I'm not happy with you right now, but I get that you're sorry and that you're trying to make it up to me the only way you know how.'
Tony realises he has one hand pressed to his arc reactor and his other arm is hugged around his waist.
'Tony,' Steve gazes at him beseechingly, 'I thought we were friends; tell me how I can make you trust me?'
'They're for you,' Tony tells him and hands them over before taking several hurried steps backwards.
He means to go straight to the kitchen to get himself a drink, and offer one to anyone else who's here, but he's barely two steps out of the lift when Pete is suddenly attached to his leg.
'Kids like to laugh at me when I juggle knives or shoot things like a badass,' Clint grins at him. 'They think you'll keep them safe.'
Steve watches Tony turning elegantly on the dance floor with Pepper and wonders, not for the first time, how two such good friends couldn’t make it work.
'Hey, sorry about that, Cap,' Tony switches back to English. 'Just arrived at my place and had to check my tailor was on his way.'
‘I can find out quickly enough what I’ve created in that time and what I’m working on. I don’t think there’s anything else I really need to know.’
He can practically feel how Steve isn't convinced. In the edge of his vision he can see Steve trying to catch his eye so he fixes his gaze on his son instead. He's lining up cars, probably ready to send them all shooting across the room.
'I'm going to worship you, Steve,' Tony promises as he presses his finger in further. 'I'm going to make you feel amazing.'
'He's healthy; the serum changed you fundamentally,' Bruce reassures him, 'the illnesses you had as a child won't be passed on to your children.'
'I'm going to worship you, Steve, you have no idea...' Tony presses kisses down his neck until he reaches  his t-shirt. 'Off,' he instructs and tugs on it.
'I'm not,' Pete hasn't quite managed the tone of true exasperation that Tony uses. 'I'm trying the colours.'
'I'm just going to play with Pete until Rhodey gets here,' Tony rallies enough to throw up his media smile. 'You can go polish your shield or whatever.'
'Even better, it turned itself on,' Tony walks in a circle and swears a few times before continuing. 'The readings since then are stable though.'
Steve's heart tries to soar, upon hearing such good news, and plummet, upon understanding what that means for them, at the same time.
The explosion sends Steve in a graceful arc over the wall and plummeting towards the concrete far below. Tony, of course, immediately zips after him. Just as he’s caught hold of the shoulders of the suit something shoots between them and blasts Tony away.
'Dada?' his son's voice pulls his attention from rechecking his deployment design for the induction chargers.
Tony lounges against the wall just inside the door to his penthouse bedroom; there's a sleeping super soldier in his bed.
'Someone should have stopped her,' Steve can hear his own distress. 'How could nobody notice what she was doing?'
'She can choose a favourite,' Pete offers generously. 'As long as it's not one of my favourites because they're all mine really.'
'Your mother...' Steve trails off. He knows that, regardless of what he just said, Tony's walls will be up for this conversation.
Natasha hums and moves to a console against the wall. After a few minutes she's apparently hacked in.
‘If you’d just stay at medical then I wouldn’t have to come and bother you,’ Steve points out reasonably.
'You only came here because you wanted to take him out!' Tony gestures wildly. 'What could have possibly been so interesting that it distracted you both?'
‘The armour is a level down from you, sir, in a laboratory,’ Jarvis reports. ‘I am preventing anyone from learning anything from it.’
'I didn't think so,' Tony glares at the generator some more. 'Fine, we'll monitor it really fucking closely for now and strangle Reed when he comes for it tomorrow. Makes sure all the barriers you can put up are up; I don't want this happening again.'
'That's all, Mr Stark,' she smiles. 'I'll let you know when the more serious side of the press decide to comment on the actual point of the press conference.'
‘Peachy,’ Tony smiles tightly and adjusts something within his chest cavity. The bleeding has stopped and the space for the reactor is shiny and new again but the skin around it looks raw and inflamed.
'It was his tip,' Steve tells him, 'that makes it his mission and his data. You're the one that made him a consultant and not a full Avenger.'
'Peter has been asleep for an hour and five minutes,' Jarvis tells him promptly. 'I have been monitoring his REM cycle and believe it would be best to wake him in ten minutes or so, if he does not wake on his own.'
'Good point,' Tony waves a hand. 'Make it a conference call; I'll sit in if I can and record it if I can't.'
'You know that poison-that-wasn't-a-poison I got hit with a while back? Well, I was studying it and I had this idea for being able to...'
The next person to move in is Pepper who arrives ahead of her boss, with all of his tech from Malibu, so it can be set up when he arrives.
'I'll see you tomorrow for breakfast?' Steve cuts in as Tony stands, being careful not to jolt his son.
Before Steve realises it he's spent all morning playing with Tony and Pete, and he only realises then because Jarvis makes an unsubtle hint to Tony about it being lunchtime.
'Do you know anyone who might be interested in hooking up with a blond super soldier?' Natasha asks.
''May I',' Jarvis corrects into his earpiece. 'Sir, Captain Rogers is in the hallway and wants to know if you wish him to enter.'
'Clarke,' Tony continues to ignore him and addresses the young man with his arms tightly crossed against his chest standing against the wall. 'Charge me for one of the latest Stark phones.'
'Steve,' Clint hisses, 'all it would take is one bad guy to recognise the kid and they'd know they're in the money. Can you imagine how much money Stark would hand over to get that kid back?'
‘It’s actually quite a boost to my ego that you must think that I built this from scratch in the last… how long Jarvis?’
Tony has consented to staying in his medical room but only if certain conditions are met, though he doesn’t word it quite like that.
'I will,' Tony agrees quietly and allows himself to be towed to the sofa. Pepper curls herself against his side.
Steve heads to the gym after Natasha and Bruce finish their pancakes. Clint hadn't yet surfaced when he left, but that isn't overly unusual.
‘Alright, this time you really get the credit,’ Tony wraps an arm around her waist and takes a sip of the martini.
Just yesterday You handed Steve a handful of broken glass; Steve feels that Tony’s trust in them may be undeserved.
Tony looks over at the phone silently for a moment then swallows heavily and looks Steve in the eye,
'Jarvis,' Steve turns to root through the kitchen as Pete turns his attention to the entire zoo of plastic animals Tony bought, 'shouldn't there be people working on Pete's room?'
After breakfast Steve loads the dishwasher as Pete plays with his zoo animals. Tony goes to get dressed and then reappears tapping away on a tablet.
'Not just when we meet,' he settles onto the sofa opposite her and skilfully ignores the photographer. 'I've always got a lot going on.'
‘All my stuff is on the server,’ Tony rolls his eyes and walks over to drop down next to Bruce. ‘Jarvis, media server choices on the TV please.’
'I may have dared to enter a 24 hour mall on my morning run,' Steve admits, 'and they had some clothes in his size. You don't mind, do you?'
'So I've been told,' Steve shakes his head and moves to the fridge, he smiles at the drawing stuck to the door. 'Would you like another coffee?'
'It's not a valid concern,' Pepper shakes her head. 'This is where things get messy. I can't be certain, because he always acts a little strangely around me, but I think Steve is crushing on Tony.'
'Great,' Tony smiles at him. 'You know you can always tell Jarvis if you need me and I'll come straight there, ok?'
'Cap is going to come up and spend time with Jim whenever he wants,' Tony confirms with a tentative smile.
Large metal shutters, at least a foot thick, come down from the ceiling and completely block any view of the lab.
'Some water would be great, thanks,' Steve steps around him and into the conference room. Natasha and Clint follow him and then close the door.
'No,' Tony tells him emphatically as he carries him to the mess that is the main room of the penthouse.
'No,' Tony agrees, 'but what happens now will be. Seriously, Pep, what would happen? Split custody? Jim spends the weeks in the penthouse and the weekends with Steve?'
'Fondling is good,' he adds and forces himself to keep his eyes fixed on Steve for the slightest sign of discomfort.
'What the hell am I going to do if what I've just made for Richards is completely inexplicable even to the man who designed it?'
'We need to talk, Tony,' Steve hunches his shoulders a little as he shoves his hands into his pant pockets.
'English, French, Japanese, German, Russian and Chinese,' Tony rattles off. 'And I can flirt in Italian.'
They spend the rest of the afternoon messing around in the workshop with Pete and the bots. For dinner the return to the penthouse to join Pepper. Rhodey cooks steak while Tony manages a salad to go with it as Pete and Pepper curl up on the sofa and read a story off of Pete's StarkTab.
The next evening he’s watching a movie with Clint and Bruce. Clint is on the far right of the right hand sofa with Bruce to his left and Steve is on the left sofa, sitting so that he’s basically next to Bruce.
‘It’s alright, I’m fine,’ Tony rubs one hand over his eyes, leaving the other against Steve’s chest.
'I can't keep myself from your skin any longer; I take off the gauntlets and get my hand into your pants. I start stroking you slowly just to hear you whine. I want to hear you beg me to finish you. Do you think I'll be able to make you beg, Steve?'
''I'll be back in a couple of days,' Tony slips a hand under Steve's chin and tips his head back to claim a kiss.
'Captain,' she leads him to a library and gestures him into a seat before sitting across from him, 'I owe you an apology.'
Tony pets his son's hair and turns to make for the door before stopping again when Pete lets out another wail,
After lunch Steve leaves Pete napping and Tony adjusting some sensors that Jarvis reports are out of alignment.
'Yeah,' Steve nods as he watches Tony pour himself a scotch. 'Once I became...' he gestures to himself awkwardly, 'this... I figured kids were something I could hope for in my future. I still hope I can, one day. It's more daunting now though. Not that I was great at meeting people before,' he shrugs.
'Bruce is my favourite science bro,' Tony tells his son as his brain summons up how much he had wished Howard would just take the time to talk to him. 'And we're going to get his opinion on that machine I've acquired.'
'No, Captain,' he thinks he hears a weapon being primed and then disarmed. 'I'll be fine. Jarvis will be able to contact me if you need me.'
‘Doesn’t matter,’ Tony dismisses, ‘now’s fine. Stand there. Your feet shoulder’s width apart and your arms straight out to the sides.’
'Jarvis,' Pepper pinches the bridge of her nose once the doors to Steve's floor have closed, 'can you check if Rhodey would be available to speak to me?'
It’s then that Steve notices there are wires hanging from Tony’s chest and attaching to something under the desk. On the desk are two arc reactors; one is flicking on and off and has clearly been pushed to the side, the other is glowing solidly. It’s the second one that Tony’s fiddling with.
Of course the other thing that Steve worries about is the computer that seems to be monitoring his entire existence.
Steve gives him a very bewildered look and seems to be trying to think of an appropriate response before Tony cuts him off by sucking hard on his jaw.
Of course, when he thinks about it, he realises that Tony trusts him not to hurt Pete but not not to hurt Tony himself.
He makes good time and does a quick aerial lap of the block before landing at the back entrance to the SI store. Jarvis makes quick work of the security lock and he steps inside.
'That,' Tony waves a hand at the generator as he accepts his squashed toast from Dummy, 'gives off a spike of energy at six in the morning and sends me back in time by a day.'
Why did he not think enough to realise that if Pete isn't with Tony, and not with him, then of course the other members of the team must be looking after him?
'There is space 'backstage',' Jarvis suggests, 'should you wish to wait to the side for sir to finish his announcement.'
'Without knowing exactly how this happened I cannot offer you any suggestions to avoid future occurrences.'
'Please, Cap,' Tony silences all protests. 'Just look after him. Do not let him out of your sight. Don't even let the SHIELD doctors take him anywhere. You stay with him at all times. Promise me?'
'Ok,' Steve walks across the room. 'Don't worry; your Dada hasn't gone far. Jarvis, what's Tony doing right now?'
'Hey, Dada,' Pete beams and climbs up to straddle his stomach. He pats his chest with one small hand, 'it's day time, Dada.'
‘I've seen the way you look at him,' he gets a look. 'I'm not surprised if he thought he had a shot.'
There's something touching his face; he tries to pull away but the grip is strong. He thinks he makes a whimpering noise but then there're a very familiar pair of lips on his own.
'Ok,' he watches his son climb down from the chair before Steve hands him his beaker. Pete glares intently at the milk as he walks slowly across from the kitchen. Tony opts to help him put it onto the table and smiles as Pete scrambles up onto his chair ready for his breakfast.
And like that, he saw hope flare into Steve’s eyes like a mighty inferno, burning away the despair, and Tony’s heart pinched with guilt. Tony couldn’t tell him that it was utterly hopeless. He couldn’t let Steve die with it on his conscious. The super soldier gasped, “Yes! What??”
“Urghhgahh,” Bruce moaned, falling back into the couch. He was covering his mouth as if he was holding back vomit but the telltale green tinge on his skin was not from sickness.
He knew Steve had blue eyes. He’d stared into those blue eyes countless times but…for the life of him, he couldn’t remember the shade of blue. Were they lighter or darker than the poster?
“Master Parker, you are breaking dozens of protocols set up by Sir and Master Rogers. I cannot delay in telling them as it goes against my programming,” Jarvis stated from his pocket.
Wade gripped Peter by the hips and pressed their waists together. Peter was reminded that it was a man who he held as he felt Wade’s hard sex pressed into his and, dear lord, he didn’t wear a jockstrap like most supes with a form fitting uniform so Peter felt every inch of him.
“Master Parker?” Jarvis questioned and Peter giggled, thinking it all a name game. Natasha’s stance relaxed slightly as she looked at his son.
They were hiding under a table when Tony texted him, looking for a meetup and Peter muttered dejectedly, “I have to go.”
She bit down on her lip tightly and cupped his cheek. She whispered, “You, Steve Rogers, are the strongest, most brilliant man I have ever met…and you don’t deserve this.”
“Yes, Natasha. I want to know,” Steve whispered, the tone of her voice making him slightly apprehensive.
“You, James Buchanan Barnes…” Tony said, already feeling giddy at the idea. “I want you to learn everything you can about him.”
Peter smiled at his uncle but his insides churned nervously. He noted that his uncle did not say yes and wondered about her being “agreeable” again. It depressed him greatly to think his own mother would not want to see him.
Peter maneuvered his body so that he was kneeling on his knees in front of him. Wade’s legs were already spread open for Peter but now he folded his legs around Peter’s waist. Peter slicked himself up more and then held himself with one hand as he positioned himself. Wade willed his muscles to relax. He knew it was going to hurt. It’d been years since he was with another man. The initial stabbing sensation made all of his muscles contract but this was nothing compared to having his arm severed or being tortured with a hot poker. It was a mild discomfort compared to what he was used to.
Smiling widely, Tony stated, “Cap, I decided I can’t navigate the past by myself and have determined you will be the perfect candidate to help me. I can’t go to Howard because he’d just use the opportunity to try to learn about my tech and there’s no way I’m letting my dad do that because he’d totally try to replicate it and change the future. So, you are my best bet to try and keep the future intact…”
Steve squeezed Tony’s hand and, without opening his eyes, continued the account from his perspective.
“It has to do with me,” Cap said with a sigh. “He met me before he should have and now the future is all thrown off because of it…”
“Get out of my house,” Peter snarled. “I am not going to listen to this, even if it comes from Captain America and Iron Man.”
“No,” Peter gasped. Knowing Gwen, she would knock him across the head and call him a dummy for acting this way. He smiled sadly, imagining her doing just that.
The Parkers gave Peter was the most precious. It was a quilt, hand sewn by May of all of Mary’s old shirts. Peter regarded the blanket made of his mother’s shirts with an unreadable expression. When he learned that most children had a mother and a father, Peter had asked Steve where his was and Steve had to explain how she was gone. His son never asked about her again.
“You big idiot,” Tony murmured into his mouth but then wrapped his hands behind Steve’s head and returned the kiss.
Tony smirked as Steve sighed heavily. It was the best he was going to get from her. Bucky and Natasha traded quick, knowing smirks when Steve wasn't looking.
Steve let Tony manhandle him and his husband settled on top of him and kissed him as filthily as he promised. Steve groaned and ran his hands over Tony’s body. He was so much more away of the ring on his left hand as he gripped Tony’s hips or dug his fingers into his back.
‘Hell yeah!’ Wade replied, making Peter smile and the nervous feeling, that was starting to creep into his belly, dissipated.
“Yup, good ol’ Sneaky, just sneaking around, looking for Skelator’s sneaky red faced cousin,” Sneaky replied, rocking on its heels.
Tony wanted to hold him and hear his voice but, instead, he closed his eyes and remembered the warmth of his arms and the tender tone of his voice. He thought back to all the cherished memories he shared with Steve and they were able to calm him down.
“All of you are blasphemers!” Tony hissed, he elbowed Natasha, who was sitting at his side and demanded, “You aren’t going to join them too, are you?”
When Tony got outside and flew up, Friday stated, “Venom has escaped the perimeter with Peter and Steve requires medical assistance.”
“Okay, that may be a little different,” Wade noted breathlessly as pleasure surged through his entire body.
The robot’s gaze finally broke away from Steve and looked to Bucky. Its color changed without warning and blended in with the light walls of the room. It stated, “The official title for this unit is Mark 15 but, with its stealth capabilities, I…My maker thought it appropriate to call me ‘Sneaky’.”
Steve shook his head and murmured, “I’m the luckiest man out there. I was given the most amazing soulmate…”
Tony groggily woke to the song of “Star Spangled Man” playing from Steve’s phone. Tony grinned into the covers as Steve groaned loudly.
“How did you know I was here?” Steve asked, his voice so low it could have been a whisper. His eyes flicked around Tony’s body, taking in his injuries as an excuse to not have to meet his eyes. He felt guilty when their eyes stayed connected for too long.
“Amazing!” Peter replied extatically. “I’ve been testing out Venom and it gets more spectacular the more I use it!”
“Just never bring him here again, Thor,” Steve stated and the large man nodded. Clint grunted in agreement.
Wade sprinted up the stairs, his footfalls loud from his heavy tread. Venom tried to drag him to the window but Peter dug his fingers into the wall and the symbiote shrieked in frustration.
He pushed Steve over with a grunt so there would be enough room for Tony and then curled into his side. For a moment, Tony closed his eyes and let the heat from Steve’s body soak into his skin and listened to Steve’s easy breathing. He pretended it was like any other night and Steve would wake in the morning.
Steve jolted to a stop and Tony grinned widely as he met Steve’s shocked gaze. Tony’s gaze fell to take in Steve's body and his eyes became more heated. Steve’s flush deepened. He chose wisely with the bathrobe.
When his dinner hour came around, Tony hadn’t noticed because Jarvis wasn’t there to notify him. It was Panzer himself who knocked Tony off his bench and ordered him out of there. He was certainly more direct and forceful than J. Tony laughed as he got off the ground and happily smiled at Panzer as he left the garage.
He could not ask Tony for forgiveness but he selfishly needed it. He could not imagine being separated from him, even just for a day.
Peter knew exactly who Tony was talking about and countered, “Wade is nothing like Obadiah. Wade cares for me.”
Bucky bared his teeth in an angry grimace and slowly withdrew his hands from Steve’s torso. Bucky slipped off his hips then the bed and turned his back on Steve as he stepped away from him.
Steve grasped his friend’s shoulders and stated, “Yes, there is a robot but it is not here anymore. It went flying after the Red Skull.”
“The last statement will be stricken from the record,” the judge stated and turned to the medical examiner saying, “Only give us your professional opinion, sir.”
Steve snorted and wordlessly pulled Tony to the car. Happy opened the door for them and Steve murmured, “I need to watch some of these romantic comedies, the clichés you are listing off are getting ridiculous.”
“Sounds good,” Tony replied and then took another long drink as he struggled to figure out what was going through Steve’s head.
Iron Man floated several feet above the ground and had his arm pointed at the door with a small gun sticking out of it. Tony slowly lowered his arm and the gun sealed away into the armor like it was never there. Iron Man floated to the ground and Tony’s face shield popped open. His husband’s mouth hung slack with shock and his eyes were wide and glistened as disbelief and hope warred within his gaze.
Coulson bit down on the inside of his cheek and rocked the flesh between his teeth nervously. If this continued the psychiatrist would deem him mentally unsound and they will have to detain him.
“Ass-guard?” Tony repeated with a smirk. He rubbed his mouth, barely muffling his chuckle. The hologram before him was playing the same ten second clip repeatedly of the fight between a robot and a giant blond man with an overly large hammer. Very little information was being let out and the little New Mexico town where the fight occurred was shut down. But SHIELD databases contained a plethora of information which Tony was eagerly digging through.
Tony buried his face in his hands and whispered, “I always knew you were dead in the back of my mind, but I just…I don’t know…I stupidly believed maybe you weren’t…That maybe whatever was left of Hydra had found you and put you in some kind of comatose state to study you and that you were still there…still
After a while, Steve knew he was not going to be going to sleep anytime soon and Peter seemed to have fallen into a deep sleep. Steve tentatively looked up.
Tony spun around and broke away from his hold. He said, “Alright, looks like the Mini-Mark 14 is totaled! Hand over the controller.”
“I wish you could tell me your name,” Steve murmured to the little boy. He sighed and lightly pressed his forehead to his mate’s and whispered, “I wish I could be living again and find you…”
yet to find out who he was. Tony completed one task but this one was still nowhere near done. He pinched his chin and murmured to himself, “
Wade glanced up to Peter’s father. He looked wrecked. His eyes were red and his appearance sick, like he was going to vomit, but his eyes began to burn as they focused on Wade.
Peter looked to his father and couldn’t keep the fear out of his voice as he gasped, “Dad, talk to me, it can read my mind and I need to keep my thoughts preoccupied.”
Steve and Tony had been sticking close together ever since Tony revealed himself to him. Originally, Tony stayed by the man’s side for safety. He needed help navigating the past and Steve was his biggest asset. Tony had also done so with Bucky but,
The hands on Tony’s shoulders began to tremble in Tony’s silence and, slowly, those same hands slid across his chest until Steve’s arms engulfed him in an embrace and Steve pressed his face into Tony’s shoulder. Steve whispered, “Why must you be so stubborn?”
Where it went…he had no idea. The Chameleon made it specifically to help Norman with his endeavor. But with the endeavor completed what would the robot do now?
“First, I’ll go back to pacing,” Tony replied and went back to the said activity. “And then your guess is as good as mine.”
Hours passed since he last saw Tony, but, when he met up with Bucky at the mess hall for lunch, he finally saw the man.
“Tony’s floor,” Steve answered for him. He blushed, maybe he was moving too fast. Tony might still be mad at him. Steve stammered, “I mean…well, if that is alright?”
Venom was boiling in its filthy container and, with its expanding consciousness, it began to understand the meaning of ire.
“It hurt Aunt Tasha’s feelings,” Steve murmured in explanation. He looked sympathetically up to the camera that was usually Jarvis’s eye but was currently shooting a direct video feed to Bucky. He murmured, “It is no one’s fault but it still hurt her all the same…”
It was only a couple of months until Bucky’s death…it’ll be close, but, he might be able to make it…well, physically make it. He didn’t know how he was going to handle losing two friends and doing
“That’s fine; but tell him to keep his phone on him and if there is any sign of danger to tell Jarvis,” Dad retorted.
“I love you too, Tony,” Steve whispered back fervently. Steve leaned into Tony, hopping to let some of the embarrassed heat he was radiating seep into Tony, but he found his soulmate to be just as warm as he was. He looked more closely at Tony and saw that he was also nervous. He was clenching his jaw and his eyes revealed the fear he was trying to hide.
"Clark Kent had glasses." Ironman wasn't going to reflect upon the realization that Steve's new look was actually kind of attractive. (It must have been worse for Tony, hurting somewhere deep inside their head.)
"Here I thought you were a tech god." A beat. Tony spun in search of the Legion, finding it nowhere in sight. He scanned the room a third time, focusing this instance on just the machines and gizmo's lying around. "They're hollow?" He questioned, full on blasting Doom's submarine-plane open. The hood shot off, smacking the ceiling, completely empty inside. "Okay, what in the hell is going on?"
"Shut up, for the love of Christ! Tony wanted to. We missed you too, I guess." Ironman scratched the back of his head, almost feeling shy. "So you're going to thank him."
Meanwhile, Ironman gently arranged himself comfortably against Steve's side as Steve went on babbling like an idiot. "I designed the uniform, Steve," He said in annoyance, mostly because Steve was so surprisingly warm. Serum, he had to remind himself. "You never asked," he said in reply to Steve's comment about hand holding. Ironman would have absolutely rejected him, of course. Well, at least for awhile, anyway. Tony, he had no clue what Tony would do, being gentler and that much more receptive to Steve's mere existence. Tony loved Steve first, really.
It soothed Tony's broken heart enough that he switched focus onto the room they happened to find themselves in. It really was exceptionally dark, but it there was enough light, once his eyes adjusted, to spot the glittering of machinery and tools scattered in disarray. There were various tubes and from what Tony could see, something that looked like a mini-submarine towards the end, near the wall. Stark--hah!--amongst the vague darkness were the beaming eyes of his Iron Legion was standing at attention a few feet where Steve and him were bound together.
Tony bolted behind the counter, using the stairs to reach the storage room. He blew off the lock to the safe with a set of faulty repulsors he deemed beyond upgrading and smashed open the first bottle he saw. It was his petty sense of self-satisfaction that convinced him storing all his most favorite, and most expensive brand of whiskey here was proper proof he’d beaten the unending need to drink.
"I can earn it. Even if I gotta spend the rest of my days doing it, Tony. This life... this life's been cruel. I need stop mourning it, I ...I do, too." He gestured with his fingers. "I love you, too. Wow," he laughed wetly, and it was then that Ironman realized there were tears staining his cheeks. "We're awful aren't we?"
"Good." Ironman regrettably pushed Steve away; only briefly. "We need to get everyone else out, ASAP."
He became angry, thinking about having kissed Steve just because Ironman kissed Steve. He’d let his emotions get the best of him. Steve cared, but caring only meant so much, in the end.
And, strangest of all, the rest of the town took him as kindly as they took the rest of each other. He avoided the bar and no one such as murmured the need for a drink when he was present.
"Okay," Steve breathed, turning serious and moving to start strategizing using that big, dumb, impressive brain of his. Sometimes Tony envied having a photographic memory and Steve's easy ability to learn new information at light speed. Steve probably couldn't help that sometime he wasidiot.
“I...” Tony tried saying. “I don’t know what I’m thinking anymore Steve. I hate looking back and seeing my mistakes, but how do I function anymore without--” He lifted the bottle in his hand, “Without this? Dammit, I can believe I just told you I love you."
Steve would understand. He was always a kind and gentle man, patient when it mattered. He'd be happy to learn Tony discovered how horrid singing sober genuinely was.
Steve huffed a laugh, "You practically laid on me. I'm your serum-enhanced boyfriend, I kinda like cuddles. Plus, uh, you're cuddling back." He shrugged, his mouth tilting upward into a tiny, god-awful smirk. Ironman tried to muster every ounce of rational thought contained in his and Tony's collective brain before blatantly ignoring all of it--Siberia, their parents, the quiet falling out after Ultron--and jolting forward, kissing Steve with everything he had. Steve moaned against him, reaching to cup a hand around his cheek, taking charge.
“Drink your tea and eat something. I’m your assistant, not your nanny.” She said, leaving him to his ghosts for the evening.
Steve failed to hear anyone else inside there with him, and he hated that it made him feel so relieved. Then he felt the worry start to course through him.
"Oh," Steve said softly. "I- I understand, Tony. I do. We have--we have a lot of issues to work through."
Ana died not too long after, and Jarvis hadn't been the same since. That next year he and Jarvis started making a little memorial for her near the tree, lit with candles and dressed with Ana's favorite flowers. Then, when Tony was finally older and his mother could finally be around more (never his father, his father would never have the time), they had to go and get in a car crash just before his mother's big holiday gala, leaving him and Jarvis all alone. And finally ... finally, years later, Jarvis had died too.
The lights flickered on, succeeding in nearly blinding Tony momentarily before he could comprehend how uncomfortably close Doom was standing next to him.
"Indeed," Doom agreed. "Doom often enjoys mixing the formidable knowledge of science and sorcery together." Uh-huh. "This is how Doom has made time-travel achievable." Okay. Sure.
Whatever Parker thought he saw or didn’t would need to be dealt with regardless. It’s just the same shit, he repeated to himself. Same as it’s been since the beginning of forever.
Steve ended up giggling, "Tony, you're covered in grime. My clothes are already dirty now from you touching me."
"Love each other. I know. Please, believe me, I know. I know it's going to- to hurt. Maybe more so than knowing what we've done to each other."
“I politely asked her to step out on this one,” Steve answered, draping himself on the door frame. His voice was deep and soft, gentle, like all the times he’d helped Tony find his bed in the middle of the morning.
Except, "Doom knew we'd help them once we realized," he said, landing next to Steve and leading the way back to the lab.
"Hydra didn't hurt me. You did." Ironman swallowed back the venom on his tongue, the vicious words he wanted to cut Steve open with. To make Steve hurt just as much as they were still hurting now.
Tony chuckled, deeply amused. “How chivalrous of you.” He joked, but then he refused to meet Steve’s eyes. “Steve you needn’t be worrying about me right now. You should be home or, I don’t know, at least with your friends.”
Tony froze, and then after a moment, burst out howling in laughter. He was instantly nauseous and felt the burning desire to taste something strong and bitter on his tongue. “Oh, this'll be good.” He said. Better deal with it now, he thought. There would plenty of fresh sheets of iron waiting for him when they got back.
Neither Ironman nor Tony could argue with that one. But there was something to be said about an egotistical dictator that freely stole other's inventions without care or concern like a massive dick: bad news. "You've got yourself a deal," Ironman agreed, unfortunately. What else did Doom have on them, and of theirs besides the single Iron Legion unit? That was Tony's entire basis for diving in headfirst like a moron, because Tony constantly lacked any sense of self-preservation. Yet, it was also clear that Doom was seeking something other than just assistance with his ridiculous time machine, and both Ironman and Tony reckoned it had everything to do with their new armor.
"The point," Steve continued, "is that I'm simply a guy wandering through Europe. I haven't put on this uniform since ..." He swallowed and turned his gaze to the floor, restlessly fumbling with his fingers. "Since Siberia. The Iron Legion was conveniently nearby, and I thought.. Well, I thought, because I knew, Tony, I knew what it meant. How much it'd hurt to see yet another person stealing your tech... I--I knew I had to do something."
“You don’t need to be scared of me or whatever it is you’ll think I’ll do. I’ve had the time dwell these past months, same as you. And I’ve realized I’ve loved you too. I’ve always loved you, too.” Steve said. He squinted his eyes. “But I’d like to note you’re an insufferable jackass.”
Funny, that. Doom suddenly taking claim for their Legion and all. "A strange invitation, but alright. Invite accepted." Ironman obliged. "Though I meant what I said before with me and Cap," he said through his teeth. Tony seemed more forgiving than Ironman. It was a vile thought, imagining sharing a room with the man. Ironman was pissed that Steve thought he could just step in so thoughtlessly, like they couldn't handle their own battles. Now they were stuck with him and then Tony thinks he can depend on him? The man that left them to freeze, wounded, inside that bunker!? Ironman clenched his jaw.
"Hey, I get that reference." Steve gave a shit-eating grin, all-the-while still glowing bright pink up to his ears.
“Tony, don’t be stupid.” Though he was touched Tony remembered him mentioning Bucky and Gail those couple of times.
“Cap.” Tony interrupted him, hesitantly moving towards Steve and the bouquet. “Steve,” Tony corrected himself, “are you trying to ask me out? Like, on a date?”
Tony blinked in confusion, dazed. “I’m, I’m sorry?” He latched his hands onto Steve’s shirt, clinging so tightly as if he might die should he let go. His skin tingled where Steve started caressed a thumb along his jaw.
“Sheriff,” Tony said. He stared at the bottles, idly arranging them so they were flat on the ground in a desperate attempt not to run. He was getting better. He was trying. Maybe he was hiding instead of running this time, but God, he was trying.
"More than you can imagine," Steve replied, sorrowful. He began to walk towards the lab's entrance, "There's a chance there's a transport of some kind tucked away in here, figuring that we got here somehow. These guys, and the guards. But, since the place is mostly deserted we could blow a hole in the wall instead?" There was a hopeful glint in his eye. "We could, uh, finishing yelling at each other after?"
Tony scrunched up his nose in distaste, "Worried? You were Frenching me for like a whole thirty minutes over there!" He pointed down the hall with an arm. Apparently Ironman’s hints went right over Steve’s head in the heat of moment.
Of course, once Tony had his hands on both of his said new toys, he opted to tear off a few of the evergreen's branches just to set them on fire with his torch, only to regret it after the whole lab was starting to smell. Yet it was still cathartic, releasing all that anger. All of his anguish and sorrow. By the second branch, however, he felt bad, remembering his mother and Ana--Ana's candles lit aflame each day of December till the New Year. Thus, he changed his mind and had Steve help make a couple of candle holders out of his scrapped armor parts and thought it was better to let the rest of the team have this tree to decorate too. (It could be the scapegoat tree that Hulk and Thor got to destroy later, because God, that was only a matter of time.)
"Hey, Tony," Steve said, hurt, but finally shifting his weight off Tony's much more lithe frame (he wasn't small, how dare you even think it).
“Imagining you asking Fury to herd cows might be an even better gift than this,” Tony laughed. “But only if you named one Betsy just for me. And you let me cuddle her from time to time.”
“My rules. I’ve decided my birthday should be an all week affair like you like to do.” Tony mostly slept, in all honesty. Or did mostly what he always did anyway, but Steve wasn’t above using it to his advantage.
He let Tony direct him towards a large chest brimming with sex toys, including several anthropomorphic styled dildos and an array of strap-ons. There were cuffs and whips, and two differently colored collars, soft as velvet. “I want you to feel better,” He said, picking one of the smaller anthropomorphic dildos that was, in fact, a long tentacle. It was firmer than any of the others, and a deep purple.
Doom was curt, "Yes. It's exactly as I say, Iron Man." He put particular emphasis on Iron Man. "We were burdened with brilliance create the impossible. Doom strives to achieve what is beyond humanity’s simple-minded concept of the future. Are we not alike in this way?" he challenged.
Steve was alive, and Steve was helping water to his lips and pressing close to him because loved him. Steve was alive and he loved him.
"I don't think it's the armor itself he wanted ..." Tony murmured, scowling beneath the helmet. His lackeys were one-hundred percent fleshy-tissued humans, but Doom himself--. He stomped over to it and slammed his foot against the head till it snapped off, the wires of Doom's decoy sizzling and snapping visibly in the air. "Figures," Tony sighed. He commanded the faceplate to slide off and open with a flick of his eyes. "He wants the technology, per say. He probably doesn’t give a rat's ass about the armor itself."
“I’ll fuck you,” Steve said, keeping to the side of the bed. “I should have offered on the way over.” He was flushed at the thought.
"No," Ironman agreed. "Here, look," he flicked up a hologram from their gauntlet projecting news articles Friday translated into English covering Doom's biography. The people they rescued might have spoken English, but if they did they weren't interested in revealing such information. Friday could filter their hushed conversations across the field where they sat in several small piles should Ironman command it. Ironman preferred to value their privacy.
From the corner of his eye, he spotted Steve quietly edging himself around the control panel. Steve was mostly too brash and lacked subtly, preferring to barge in and tank enemies, as Peter described it. Still, Steve somehow pulled off being so invisible on the rare occasion he could scare Tony shitless passing down the communal hall. There were three other henchmen in lab-coats, adding to a total of four other people plus Doom.
"Wow, you've just unlocked the fastest route to get me to hate you," Ironman said. "Am I gonna get a stern talking to, hmm? You're missing the spatula and apron, but, you know, the armor and cape actually might work to your benefit. Kinda can't smack my hand when both of my hands are still bound together, though." He gestured, resting on his elbows and giving his hands a little shake.
"Alright, fine." Tony set his jaw, "Come here a minute." He waved Steve closer and pressed their chests together, Tony standing on his tippy-toes so he could whisper into Steve's ear, "I need you to dismantle whatever Doom's got on us. Get whatever he's stolen of mine and anyone's tech. Anything and everything."
“This is pretty much exactly like Viagra, except I think it was designed to promote breeding. Who and what, I’ll advise to ignore. The results must have been quite …unsatisfactory.” Tony was worried. “The only way out of this is to have, you know,” He gestured vaguely with a hand and Steve tried not to glare a hole into his head.
“Tony,” Pepper startled him out from the darkness, taking hold of his shoulder, “I think you’d like to catch your breath.” She advised.
Tony gasped and focused on breathing. Just breathe, in and out. In and out. Gotta make Brucie-Bear all sorts of proud.
“The flowers are mostly just for show, but technically they’re just as edible as all the rest,” Steve said, explaining.
He got himself to make a round or two days later on the main floor. It was bustling with customers and fans alike when he stopped dead, eyes locking with Steve’s beautiful pair of blues. They widened, hopeful, as Steve hesitantly stepped forward, breaking into a smile.
Tony really wanted to ask about the whole talking in third person thing, but then he'd have to admit publicly he basically did it too. Who in the seven hells even knew what Doom would do with that kind of information? Yet it sat on the tip of his tongue, waiting to burst out from his mouth. He’d been good at this once--focus. Focus. Most of Doom's rambling sounded like absolute bull ripped straight of an old seventies comic book or something and Tony had half a mind to just smack the back of Doom's fancy wrench against the panel.
"Tony, let me do it," Steve argued immediately, stepping forward. He took Tony's hand very gently into his, bringing it to his lips and softly running his lips over Tony's knuckles. Tony couldn't help but flex his fingers, suddenly helpless in the moment. Steve had absolutely no idea. He had no clue about the difference between them, Tony and Ironman. That didn't stop the fluttering between Tony's ribcage. Nor did it stop how he was preening over Steve choosing to kiss Tony's hand and not Ironman's.
As if reading his mind, Steve explained, "Pep suddenly remembered she had some kind of CEO thing to take care of." He shyly held up two tall flutes filled with peach colored champagne and he said, "She left us something to celebrate with though."
Before Steve could break the archer’s heart, Tony leaned in and said, “This may very well be zombie ground zero.”
Just as Tony leaned back to meet Steve’s gaze in his confession, he leaned forward and pulled one of the muscles in his chest and couldn’t hold back a hiss of pain as one of the veins felt like a bolt of lightning striking him in the movement.
Either way, he stopped a mugging and posed for half a dozen tourist photos. It was a normal night. No one was staring at him or whispering about him. With the mask, he was only the same-old Spider-Man.
“Well, I can honestly say that this was the best sex I’ve ever had being bottom,” Peter dryly retorted with a sly smile.
Peter’s hands were under his shirt but Wade’s hands could find no disruption in the new black Spidey suit he was wearing. He groaned in frustration and cracked open his eyes. The sight he saw made him hiss in fear. Peter’s suit was
“No, wait,” Wade stopped Peter again. Wade’s body (and at least one of his voices) was all gung-ho about continuing. However, Wade’s soul innately knew it was wrong and his very heart clenched at the thought of being with Peter only for lust.
Tony was sitting in the same chair he had been the last time they were in SHIELD Medical, after the attack in Central Park. His eyes glowed in the reflection of the tablet on his lap and he was covered in the same grime and wearing the same clothes he fought in. Steve easily surmised that he had never left his side which drew a small smile to his lips.
They rose together, bumping their shoulders as they did, but Bucky practically ran out of the room and to his soulmate’s side. Steve watched with a fond smile as Bucky kissed Natasha and rubbed her belly. He then picked up Stepan and sat where he had been and put him on his lap. He kissed his son’s cheek before he started grabbing food for himself.
Steve cast an uneasy glance to Tony. Tony wasn’t acting like the rest of the men who’d been drilled to work through their exhaustion. He hadn’t even put down his tent yet.
“Yes, me,” Schmidt replied with a grin. He stepped into the room placing himself between Steve and the only two men in world he loved. “You didn’t think you were the only one to have survived, did you?”
As he expected, after a second of shocked filled silence, the audience jumped to their feet and screamed. Steve grinned widely as cameras flashed and Marston’s jaw fell open as if unhinged. It took much longer for the audience to settle down but Marston’s grin returned in a flash. He traded a thankful, knowing glance with Tony and let his audience calm themselves down.
BTW since these events are taking place in the middle of a WWII military operation, so please let me know if I  misinterpret Army procedures or historical facts!
“What is that?” Tony asked and was rewarded with a groan from Steve. He grinned and said, “No, really tell me what it is, the concept escapes me.”
Because he couldn’t change the future and his sweet super soldier had to die or he was cursed to become Hydra’s puppet.
Steve let out a breath he did not know he was holding and gasped, “Good, good, I was a little worried but I figured you could handle yourself.”
“He’s not good,” Coulson stated to both of them. “When the paramedics arrived, they were going to announce him dead on scene until Natasha made them check for a pulse. If he didn’t have the serum, he’d be dead. As it is, we had to fly in specialists to work on him, even in this condition, his skin is tougher than what usual doctors are used to.”
Peter’s eyes shot up to his father’s and he looked at him with wide eyes as his shock and hope warred for dominance in his gaze. Had Tony…? Did he put Wade on the list?
Steve was the first in the room and Peter sat up to embrace his stepfather. Steve murmured, “Welcome back, Pete.”
“I saw,” Bucky hissed, his voice filled with emotion. It was an anger he heard countless times prior from Bucky whenever he was referencing Hydra, the Nazis, or bullies. It was a voice that belonged to the old Bucky. Steve shivered.
“The DNA is evidence enough,” Steve stated morosely. He leaned into Tony and lay his head on his shoulder. He closed his eyes and tried to get the good feeling back.
He went into the deli and ordered a large roast beef sandwich with everything on it plus a large soda, two bags of chips, and a dozen cannolis. With his metabolism, this would be enough to abate his hunger. The deli owner wanted him to take it all, free of charge, but Steve insisted on paying and even left the man with a hefty tip.
Steve gently returned the grasp and whispered, “It’s okay, Peter. I know you didn’t mean it.” Steve voice broke off a little and he took a deep breath to battle his emotions. He gently put his arms under Peter and picked him up, whispering, “Let’s get you home.”
He also wanted his old life as the nobody Peter Parker who could wear his Spidey suit under his clothes without a care…but he was never going to get that back. Would it be the same with this feud between Wade and Tony?
The spell was broken when Peter took his first strangled breath. The sound of it gurgled in his throat.
No one interrupted him which he was grateful for, but he was even more grateful for Tony. His fiancé did little things to always remind him that he was there with a small squeeze to the hand, a rub to the shoulder, or a quiet whisper of love in his ear.
The rest of the Commandos had no idea what was going on. Tensions were high and the other men knew truths were being withheld from them. With Tony traveling with the group, it’ll be much harder to keep quiet about the truth of his condition.
Natasha was silent and only spoke when she was spoken to. There was never any doubt she was not following the conversation, though her expression revealed nothing. She methodically ate away at her pancakes with strawberry syrup.
Peter snorted as he slid off him and glanced around Wade's room before his eyes settled on a small, empty trashcan. He picked it up and asked, “Can I keep it in here?”
Steve could not let what was happening with Tony and Bucky distract him. Peter was the most important person in his life and he needed to take care of him now. He knew for a fact that Peter displayed not just one but two new powers yesterday. He had to get Peter to Bruce
Eddie stared at the beaker with hard eyes and then slowly raised his head with his fists relaxing. He whispered, “If it had something stable to latch on…we could piggyback its stabilization. It needs a stronger core…”
Natasha bit down on Bucky’s lip, her blood mixing with his. She drew her fist back as far as she could and punched him across the jaw. Bucky was thrown back and made no move to catch himself. He stumbled back and must have landed painfully on his tailbone.
“He did not remember me,” Natasha countered without turning around. She stated, “He remembered you. His subconscious clearly is telling us his true feelings on the matter. Let me go.”
Steve’s numbing shock seemed to leap off him just as Venom had and he smiled so widely at his husband that his cheeks hurt. He bound across the room and lifted Tony into a tight embrace.
Between the super soldiers and the Asgardians, the cake was completely devoured quickly. They moved on to the presents next. Steve sat on one of the bunny’s legs with Peter on his lap and together they opened Peter’s gifts.
“If I don’t take risks then I might as well be a shut in the rest of my life,” Peter countered. He tossed some clothes into his bag and said, “The worst that can happen is that the paparazzi find me before I can get back in my webs. Then I’ll just weather through it and grab the first cab I come across.” Peter shouldered his bag and said, “I need to cross this hurdle. It’s my life now.”
They walked a few feet toward the car before Tony finally found his voice and sarcastically stated, “Well, that went better than I expected.”
In the other bed, Peter and flinging his limbs wildly and Wade was holding him to try to keep him from hurting himself.
Tony gently ran his hands over his back and murmured into his neck, “It hasn’t been an hour yet, but would you like another reminder that I love you?”
It was the way he stared at him though that convinced him. Even though he was still so small, Peter stared at him with an unwavering gaze that the older version had used when he stared down the Sinister Six.
“Well I should help those fools in R&D with the technical side of the investigation,” Tony murmured. Tony smiled at him but there was nothing in it. It was hallow and devoid of emotion.
Bucky continued, “Well around the time Stepan was born, I remembered a safe word that can stop me. As soon as I hear it, I fall unconscious.”
Bucky helped Natasha up and, once she was standing straight, he pressed his hand onto her belly with a small but loving smile.
Tony was walking ahead so he didn’t see Bucky’s reaction but he could feel his glare burning into the back of his head. Tony grinned, glad he was still able to tease his teammate. He barely noted the heat of his glare as it was coupled with the ever-effervescent warmth of Steve’s smile. He glanced to his side and was correct in presumption, Steve was smiling warmly at him.
“Savage,” Wade hissed comically under his breath. Despite it being a whisper, everyone heard it and Tony looked even more destroyed.
Wade groaned and put his hands on Peter’s ass, pressing him closer to Wade. His baby boy was hard, it was like a freaking iron pipe pressing into him. This couldn’t possibly have happened so quickly. He had to have crawled into his window with it. The knowledge that Peter broke into his house with a boner was strangely arousing.
Peter stuck his thumb in his mouth and peered at the Avengers questionably, not going to sleep like Steve had requested. Steve sighed deeply and ran his hand over Peter’s head. He murmured, “It is going to be alright, Peter.”
Tony took down one of the flying alien fighters but he almost took out Clint in the process as the wreck fell on his position. Tony would have known Clint was there if he had been
Cap cut him off and said, “No. Sneaky is right. We shouldn't meddle with the past or future. Put everything back where you found it and pull your people out. We'll empty the room and then put a guard on it and then we won't use it until we send Sneaky home.”
James launched himself at her and grabbed her throat with both of his hands. His grip was crushing as he exerted his full strength. His face was ugly and pinched as he hissed to her one single word:
Tony hit him with his blasters and Steve could smell the man’s flesh burning from where he was but the stranger moved as if he were unhurt.
Bucky gently pulled himself out of Steve’s grip and slid in front of him onto the bike. Steve moved back to accommodate him and buried his face in his back.
The article commented on the media speculation that ensued. It was speculated that the resentment between Richard Parker and Tony Stark grew as a result of Parker buying out the biological department of Stark Industries, forever destroying the foothold Stark Industries had in the biological sector.
Wade couldn’t meet him that night because he had something going on with the X-Men. Peter texted him sporadically but he mostly worked with Eddie on their breakthrough. Everyone else left the lab by end of shift but they continued to look over their slides and mix their chemicals, measuring their every drop with abated breath.
“Soon,” Tony murmured, pressing another kiss onto Steve’s lips. He stepped back and said, “I need to get dressed before I start kissing you again or else I’m just going to end up stripping you!”
Bucky sat down heavily onto the bed and Steve and Tony positioned themselves in front of him. Steve and Bucky exchanged meaningful looks but did not reply. Tony pressed, “C’mon, I heard what you two said, I wasn’t born yesterday. In fact, technically, I haven’t been born yet.”
Steve shrugged and pressed a quick kiss onto Tony’s lips before rushing over to save the scrambled eggs.
Wade was kissing Peter where ever he was able and, while Peter was cupping his face like he was precious gold, he saw something odd on Pete’s wrist.
Peter moved faster than his eyes could follow. One second he was standing on the ground and the next he was flying through the air. Wade flailed his arms and grabbed onto his boyfriend with a frightened yip. Peter laughed and wound his arm tighter around Wade’s waist. Wade was only too happy to hold onto Peter and press himself against the man’s body. Peter’s strong muscles moved under his hold, propelling them up, to the top of the Tower, and Wade’s naughty mind could only think of what those same muscles were capable in bed.
!” Tony whooped and cocked his gun with an excited grin. He charged forward and Steve raced after him.
After he crossed the Brooklyn Bridge and was in his old neighborhood, he knew he was going to make it. He spotted a tunnel open to the sewers and went in without any hesitation. As a kid, he explored these tunnels all the time with Bucky. It was partially his childhood home. None of the bullies dared go too deep but the more reckless Steve and Bucky dared.
“Stay in the bed, Petey,” Steve murmured as he shuffled across the room. There was a dresser and after opening half a dozen drawers, containing medical supplies and hospital gowns, he came across some sweatpants.
Tony threw back his head and laughed. It was, by far, the best way to stop a villain’s ranting so far.
“I think you need to turn around and think on that question a few more hours,” Tony grumbled into Steve’s stomach. Steve lightly patted Tony’s head and ran his fingers through his soft hair.
Peter’s eyes dropped to Wade’s smile and he huskily whispered, “I think your mouth will do a better job at that.”
“A lot of people lost their lives when they looked into these eyes. From now on, when people see these eyes, I want it to be in process of saving them,” Peter stated the same argument that won over Dad. He inhaled deeply and said, “I also want these eyes to be the eyes the Goblin sees when he eventually faces me.” The Goblin had resurfaced a few years ago and was trying to get his foot into the criminal empire of New York. The beast was not as bold as he was when he first appeared. The Avengers had yet to face him but they had fought with the beast’s forces and heard its name whispered in fear.
“If Bucky is fine with it…” Steve started to say but Tony clapped his hands together before he could continue.
The robot owed them retribution but not now. No, right now it was going to help them find a way to save Peter.
Tony leaned heavily on the edge of Steve’s bed during the short exchange and stared at Steve’s unchanging expression. He was waiting for a reaction but nothing was happening…
Behind him, the Captain was put onto a stretcher and they wheeled him out. Fury got to his feet and stated, “Had you not attacked us. Both of you would have been detained for questioning. We could have examined the Captain’s mind and determined his mental state this being AWOL was only our excuse to legally get a hold of him. We have to make sure he is not a danger toward the public.”
“You’re going to have to go through a little fanfare before you can get home,” Natasha informed him as he sat down across from her. They were in a limo. Steve had never been in one before so he inspected the lavish interior with a curious eye.
He pulled back to see the truth in her eyes. Her face was open for him to easily read her love, concern, and sorrow.
“Good morning,” Steve whispered. Tony’s gaze rose to his and his smile grew into that loving smirk of his that he only showed to Steve.
End it did, but when they returned to the dreamworld, Tony was filthy, his skin sunburned and bruised but he wore a weary smile.
Tony stared at the doors and was immediately at war with himself. He too wanted to be by Steve’s side but he didn’t think he could bare seeing them cut into him.
The suit came to a sudden halt in front of Steve then opened so Tony could jump out of it. Steve jerked forward to catch his husband and pulled him into a tight embrace.
Steve would tease him sometimes for being a ladies’ man but he never told him to stop. He understood the loneliness Bucky felt. Bucky tried to get him to join him sometimes but Steve always denied the request.
Steve cupped Tony’s face and kissed him again. He held his face lovingly and kissed his lips tenderly and softly. He continued until Tony’s relaxed beneath him and he started to cry again. His tears were not from despair or anger but from joy. Steve found himself emulating Tony and hot, happy tears fell from his own eyes and both of them found each other unable to kiss anymore because they could not break their smiles.
Clint removed a few knives, a gun, and a thick wire with handles on the end before stepping back and saying, “He’s clean.”
“One: If you had to put it together in the workshop it’s probably not a good idea to use,” Steve stated. “Two:
Tony glanced back at Steve. He smiled sadly at him and turned back to the crowd, saying, “I, myself, had garnered a reputation for one-night stands with men and women but what Steve and I share is not anything like that. He’s made me a better man and…I-I love him.” Tony paused and took a steadying breath before he continued, “Whatever comes of Tyler’s accusations, I will stand by him no matter what because I know this man and he’d
“And are you still assisting him?” Tony asked. Bruce stiffened noticeably and shifted slightly from Mary’s side.
“Like you’re going to devour me,” Tony whispered huskily. He rose out of the chair and loomed over Steve.
“No!” Tony gasped and jerked forward sharply. He froze, conscious of Peter. His son grumbled under his breath but settled back down and continued to slumber. Tony waited a moment to make sure he truly was still asleep then turned his attention back to his phone and whispered, “Show me the visual. Don’t tell SHIELD a word until I say.”
Tony nodded, unable to voice a reply due to his clenched jaw. He forced himself to stay rooted to the spot as the friends departed, leaving the decrepit house and Tony feeling just as decrepit as the building around him…
“We think so,” Coulson replied with a nod. “But we don’t want the public to know his condition or…how it occurred.”
Peter stepped in, wearing the boring Stark Science Division Intern lab coat and the round glasses that made his eyes look twice as big. Peter smiled at Tony and greeted, “Hi, Dad!”
It seemed like such a faraway motion. What with his family being split and so recently glued back together, not to mention the media, still printing stories about him and Steve and Peter…their lives felt like a scattered mess that’d take forever to clean up…
Peter’s family had protected him from all sorts of danger throughout his life but there was a period when he was not under their watchful care. Peter may not remember the first years of his life but he could never forget what that tingling sensation meant.
What he didn’t expect was to see Bruce be the one standing and interrupting the proceeding. Bruce was visibly shaking with his fists clenched at his waist and his eyes a dangerous shade of green.
Tony knew Steve had mistaken SHIELD for Hydra but hearing those words come out of his mouth still made him tighten his hold on his super soldier.
“I never imagined Captain America bunking down in a place like this,” the stranger stated, breaking the silence. Steve laughed and Tony’s faltered in his steps.
Tony clenched his fists wanting with all of his heart to pull Steve back to him and assure him they would all be alright.
He wished he could touch him…to feel his warmth and the beating of his heart. He wanted to hear his “hourly” reminder that he loved Steve and then Steve would wholeheartedly agree to loving him as well. He wanted to hold his hand or…even go back to simply pinching his arm again. He’d be willing to even just look at him…watch him from afar if that meant he could visually confirm he was alive.
“Oh my God, Steve, what are you doing?” Tony groaned, arching in Steve’s direction to get him to continue.
Steve reached his floor just when Jarvis got back to him. The AI stated, “Sir will be glad to join you but he said he hopes you will not ‘eat’ him in front of your son as it might not be appropriate.”
“And how are we supposed to do that Mr. Front Cover of Every Celebrity Gossip Magazine?” Wade countered.
Steve stepped back and held Peter closer to his chest. The nurses and doctors came forward and started to prep him for surgery but he kept his eyes on Steve and Steve kept his eyes on him until he slowly backed out of the room and then was gone.
Steve grinned and trailed his hands down the spots he wanted Tony to touch him. Starting at his chest, he cupped his pecs then circled his nipples with his thumbs before drawing his hands lower. He started to sway his hips but also began to tremble under Tony’s intense gaze. All his attention was focused on Steve and his hand was rubbing his crotch making Steve wonder how hard he was. Steve’s mouth dried as his imagination ran wild and he licked his lips.
Over the last few weeks, the continuous frown had only encouraged Howard to smile more, but Howard’s smile slipped a little as he remembered last night.
He’d get Steve out of there and probably end right back in his master’s hands. His master would torture him again for defying orders but the Soldier would survive it, just as he would survive the memory wipe that would destroy all of the new memories that had arisen.
The glasslike Hulk cage also arrived but it sat empty on the landing on top of the tower. SHIELD was crawling all over the island. Venom popped up all over but always disappeared before Avengers or SHIELD came in force.
“You don’t have everything,” Fury finally retorted, making Tony switch focus from gazing lovingly at his fiancé to glaring at the SHIELD director. What’d he mean by that?
“Yesssssss,” Tony hissed excitedly. He sat up and brought the phone closer to his face to get a better look.
Pepper had increased the temperature and heat in the reactor, overloading the plasma that generated the energy. The impressive light show had been the reactor releasing that backup of energy. By the way Obadiah’s suit was sizzling, he must’ve gotten hit by the main body of the blast…just as Tony should have too.
Tony was quick to admit that he missed and needed Steve but he never verbally told his lover. When he was gone, he may have slept less and sulked a little…
"B-Bucky?" Steve gasped in disbelief. All of the Avengers heard him gasp the name and they stopped whatever they were doing and looked to Steve.
“What –?” Tony reached up and touched Steve’s beard and then noticed he was also wearing different clothes.
Bucky followed Steve after the meeting so he was there when he told Tony the length of the planned march.
“I just got goosebumps watching that,” Sneaky stated. “It was like watching a history reel in the flesh.”
To escape Steve’s shocked gaze, Tony dropped his head and buried his face into the couch by Steve’s shoulder. He felt blood rushing to his face as he murmured, “…Sorry.”
Steve looked over his shoulder to where he pushed the women aside and begged, “What is this?? How do we stop it?!”
“Did I say heart condition?” Tony said in a lighthearted voice. He tapped on his chest and said, “I meant –
As Steve fought, all he could think about was Peter. Was he okay? What if this Doctor Doom decided to attack the tower too? What if Peter threw a tantrum? What if he hurt Ben? What if Ben was not keeping such a good eye on him and he swallowed something? What if he got into something he was not supposed to? What if? What if? What if? The “what ifs” tumbled around his head making him crazy with worry.
“Fiancé, as in I’m going to marry this handsome piece of Cap in New York as soon as the law is passed,” Tony reiterated to Fury with a big grin on his face. The smile wasn’t even the patronizing one he usually gave Fury. It was 100% genuine joy. His arm was wrapped around Steve’s side as he was there and ALIVE and they were going to get freaking married!! His heart was so full with love that he couldn’t stop smiling. His facial muscles seemed stuck in the position.
Tony grasped Steve’s shirt and murmured, “I am only human and even I make mistakes…but I don’t want tonight to be one of them. Let’s stop arguing about this. Steve… I just want you and me –
Tony enthusiastically described all the different foods they were eating and were he got them. He was proud of the fact about knowing the best places to eat in New York. From there they dived into normal conversation and talked about Peter, the Avenger's, the silly rumors the media came up with for them, and just life in general.
Natasha used Steve’s distraction and broke away from his hold. She stiffly walked away from them and straight to Peter. She encased Peter in a hug and murmured, “I’m sorry, Peter. I will come back later.”
Marcel looked at the photo again and then back to the medical examiner. Marcel’s eyebrows also pinched together and he gasped, “I just can’t get over the fact that this is wrong. The stain should not have been on this dress.”
“That won’t happen again. He knows that we are together, he understands that I choose you,” Steve stated. Tony opened his mouth angrily to retort but Bucky spoke first, shutting him up.
He reached out to Steve but did not reach out enough. He pulled his hand back before he got too close. He looked like he wanted to touch Steve more but was also questioning if it was alright. He tightened his hold on Steve’s hand so much so it was as if he was trying to strangle his fingers.
Steve was propped up on the bed with a few fluffy pillows and was sitting at an obtuse angle. He parted his legs for Tony to crawl between them and then Tony collapsed onto his soulmate’s chest, making Steve let out a little “oomff” upon landing.
“And let’s get there first squirt,” Tony interrupted. “I’m only going in there for a minute so that is your time limit. Use it accordingly.”
And now he was kissing the same man and he wished that moment would never end again because he’d never have it again. The magic would end.
Peter was small boy for his age and sat in his arms weighing barely over twenty pounds. The doctors had already told Steve he needed to add another ten pounds on his boy but it was a hard endeavor since Peter seemed to have inherited his fast metabolism.
The woman sighed heavily then pulled the form out of the paperwork she was holding. She must have been waiting for him to do this. His going against medical advice must have been common knowledge in SHIELD medical by now. He had done it after nearly every mission they sent him on.
He felt more than saw Tony’s entire body jerk in reaction to his statement. Steve glanced at him and, for a few seconds, clearly saw the unmistakable hurt in Tony’s eyes before his friend hid it. Before Steve could even consider what that meant, Tony tapped the cushion beside him, signaling for Steve to return his side. Steve cautiously slid back to him and stopped just short of touching him.
He finally decided to check the sites he visited more frequently, Youtube being the first. He glanced at his subscriptions, and was happy to see none of the people he was following took an interest in Tony Stark’s secret child. But, then he went to the trending videos and saw three about him in the top ten.
That was not at all like Peter. Peter wouldn’t have left after such an emotional exchange. That wasn’t him. That was not the caring superhero Wade fell for. What was wrong? What was Wade missing? Wade clearly fucked up with the dinner but what else was he not getting??
In the end, he did what he wished someone else had done for him after the Hulk’s first transformation.
Before he could get another word out, the house totally collapsed. Tony’s breathing quickened and became labored as he fought to escape.
But his heart broke because that meant he had to let not only Bucky die...but, Steve, this amazing man, die too.
Steve cupped the side of his face and promised, “We’ll help you however we can. With your dad, Bruce, Scott, and Vision – we’ve got some of the smartest men on planet here, all able to help. We'll figure something out.”
Wade had been listening in and turned bright red upon Peter’s statement. He scoffed, “I wouldn’t call it
Steve nodded, already imagining snuggling into Tony’s arms and not letting him go for another century.
“Y-you first,” Steve garbled as he tried to come up with an explanation. The man clearly recognized his name so it must still be synonymous with Captain America. What was he going to do??
They crawled onto the bed together and simply lay there for a moment. Steve’s eyes took in Tony’s nude form and obvious arousal before finally settling on Tony’s face. Tony too was checking him out and, when his gaze returned to Steve’s, he smiled at him.
. Peter hadn’t dated or really seen anyone in years and Tony knew exactly why. He was one of the very few people Peter opened up to about Gwen and his phobias about dating again. He knew how serious this was to be Peter.
“So, then you two are like official-official, you’re not like experimenting or anything?” Tony asked.
He agreed to do these interviews…but he expressively stated to his team that he did not want to lie about Wade. He’d eluded reporters’ questions before, but he never outright said that he was not in a romantic relationship with him. Wade still wanted it to be a private affair and Peter did not want to be accidental cause of their outing.
Steve could have pulled back but he kept his face buried in Tony’s chest and lightly kneaded the muscles in Tony’s back. Tony could not help but remember the inquires he wanted to make but did not want to this moment to end. As it was, this moment was confirming something Tony thought impossible.
Steve also smirked at the irony but added, “Luckily, the ‘figurative vultures’ cannot fly whereas you can.”
“There is no way you are joining the Avengers,” Steve countered. The last thing Steve wanted was for his son to risk his life as a superhero. He always envisioned Peter living a relatively normal life and never using his powers other than lifting the couch off the ground to look for the remote.
She grasped him and lowered herself down slowly. They moaned together and then slowly started to move and make love.
Tony bent over the tub and turn it on. Water rushed out of the facet and Tony pushed away from the tub. He slowly drew his hands up Steve’s body and then gently cupped Steve’s jaw. Steve dipped down and met Tony halfway to softly kiss.
“Tony’s going to chide you for using flowers that mean ‘I’m sorry’ but…I just wanted you to know I think it was a great gesture. I think it reached her,” Steve whispered.
Steve was handcuffed to the wall by a magnetic cuff and was pulling at it while fighting off over half a dozen men. An electric baton was jabbed into Steve’s side and his entire body tensed with pain. With a snarl, Tony broke into the elevator and took out half its occupants by slamming into them. He went straight for the man wielding the baton and smashed him into the wall. Tony grabbed him and knocked him into the wall a few more times until his body was flopping like a rag doll and only then did he drop him. He turned around to see Steve had used his distraction to tear the cuff off the wall and take care of the remaining men.
Tony smiled and promised, “Every day.” He placed his hand on the back of Steve’s neck and drew him back down. Steve returned the kiss with everything he had. He could not imagine a time before feeling so happy and loved.
This was it. This was the plane Cap had crashed into the Atlantic to save New York. It was Cap’s tomb and inside were the remains of the legend himself.
Mary paused as she looked around the room. Steve waited for her to answer his question. Eventually, her eyes settled back on him. Her expression was unreadable but her eyes were calculating as she studied him.
Eddie said something about testing Venom outside and Peter nodded and his friend left. Peter sat down at one of the stools and held his wrist, petting the piece of Venom he had and feeling comfort from its presence.
Peter had pushed with all of his strength so his father went flying from the bed, hit the opposite wall, and crumpled to the ground with a groan. Fresh blood began to trickle down the older man’s arm where the needle delivering his father’s pain medication was torn out of his flesh.
Tony nodded and Steve slipped out. Steve instantly went in search of the quartermaster on duty and was able to get some shoes for Tony. He’d glanced at his feet and guesstimated the time traveler’s size but he was pretty confident he guessed right. After that, he strolled back to his room, stopping to check in with a few sentries.
The man looked annoyed and Steve wondered how long he had been trying to get his attention. Standing by at the base of the rubble, by the team, stood the other detective.
“He does not know how to act around you,” Steve said gently. He didn't react at all negatively to Tony’s pessimism, another sign of how perfect he was...
It was vastly unprotected compared to the future mansion he’d live in with his family, in upstate New York. It’d be so easy for Norman to go in there and slowly choke the life out of him.
Steve had expected Tony to say all of that except the proclamation of love at the end. It was the only point in the speech that Tony had stumbled over his words but regardless he had stated to loving Steve.
After around three hours of walking he finally arrived in Brooklyn and where his old apartment once was. The building had been torn down and in its place was a laundromat. He had been hoping to see the old apartments retrofitted but he was sadly disappointed. He stared at the new building for a long time remembering his old life in the apartment he shared with his best friend who was now long dead…even though it felt like he’d lost him only a month prior. For a while, he doubted he was on the right street even though he had confirmed it twice already. The apartment was gone and with it another connection to the past…
As he got closer, Steve was able touch the bottom of the pool so he strode the rest of the way to Tony. The water parted around him in robust ripples and dripped down body his body, tracing all the places Tony wanted his tongue to explore. His hair was damp and clung to his scalp closely and Tony wanted to muss the usually perfectly styled hair.
“H-How could they be so vicious to me? I-I’m a person, just like them but they treated me like the s-scum on the bottom of their shoe!” Steve was still hyperventilating but Tony could hear him catching his breath and he nestled his face in Tony’s chest. Steve also had been trembling but that stopped almost as soon as he was in Tony’s arms.
Steve walked up behind him and wound his arms around him and leaned into his back. Tony leaned back, pressing the back of his head into Steve’s shoulder.
“None of this was one the schematics!” Tony hissed, more to himself as a curse. All of them but Thor had also seen the building’s old layout and understood his frustration. The door to the warehouse was supposed to open up to one large, open room that had once been used to store shipping containers. Instead, it opened to a small room, not much larger than a closet. The opposite wall had three doors, each with a number above. Between doors one and two, was the message Bruce was referring to.
Steve smiled warmly at him. That’s right. He was back in the present. Steve no longer had to struggle with events to save the future. He only had to live it now…with Tony.
James sat up. The side of his face was already swelling. She held his arm tightly, desperately wanting to pull him back into her arms.
“I give it fifteen,” Natasha replied, looping her arm through Clint’s. She wore a long black gown with matching elbow length gloves.
, they would have taken pictures and called the news and your face would have been all over the television within the hour! And everything your pops and I have done to keep your identity a secret would have been for nothing!”
“Peter,” she whispered, her voice filled with distress. “Peter, your father, Richard, he raised you, he loved you, but…”
Steve chuckled and lightly caressed his fingers down Tony's cheek. He whispered, “And good morning to you too, sweetheart.”
Simply thinking about it, however, brought him joy. He couldn’t wait for more dates with Tony. Every day he had with his fiancé was precious.
“Not the one you’re thinking of,” Steve whispered, his flush growing deeper as he imagined the inappropriate thoughts running through his lover’s mind.
They kept their mouths connected as long as they could. Shallowly gasping for air whenever one of them tilted their heads or move their lips right. But it finally became too much and they broke apart with sharp gasps.
“They’re hyacinths,” Bucky murmured in explanation. He coated his pancakes in syrup then placed the bottle down back down from where he retrieved it. He cut into the food and shoveled a large piece into his mouth.
He spared one last glance to the chaotic future they were leaving behind and prayed to God that they’d find a way to fix it.
With the new projected voice, Steve inhaled sharply in Tony’s ear and Tony stopped breathing altogether.
“Stop hogging, Peter, it’s my turn,” Wade whined and squeezed between the press of his parents’ bodies. Steve and Tony laughed as Wade pulled Peter into his arms and properly nuzzled his face into the side of Peter’s neck. Any cold that had lingered in his bones totally disappeared when Wade was able to properly hold him. Peter sank into his arms and Wade whispered to Peter, “Let’s go home…”
Steve gripped his mug tighter, overcome with emotion, and whispered, “I can never thank you enough, Father…You’ve done so much for me and barely know me…”
“I…I’ve got an update,” Tony said, his gaze flickering between Steve and where Peggy and Bucky stood together.
“You don’t think I didn’t notice?” Steve teased but Wade didn’t hear it because his heart was beating against his rib cage so powerfully that he could only hear the drumming of his body. He flushed, imagining Peter talk about him in such a way and his stomach tightened with either elation or indigestion…maybe both.
Steve’s eyes quickly scanned the room but didn’t see the suit. Was Jarvis there, hiding with its superior technology? Or was it gone?
“The statement I put out last night about Peter being your son went through better than expected. Since he has been in your life, people don't see you as abandoning him. It helped that you admitted to being his father and keeping silent about it more for Peter than for yourself. There's a lot of curiosity about who Peter is because he's lived such a quiet life though. So we've had a lot of people trying to dig something up and some of Peter’s ‘friends’ have shared personal content from his private social media accounts. So, not only do they know about his love of Star Trek, but they also know about Gwen’s death. They’ve been focusing on that and the Parkers’ deaths. They're making him out to be the sad orphan and are mostly pitying him right now in the news segments…But they went as far as to camp out in front of the Stacey's so I put them up at a hotel with security.”
That was when he recognized the all too familiar grip of Venom over his mouth and constricting his body.
Without a word exchanged, he and Tony spun around and ran from the building. They ran over a metal bridge, running parallel with the direction the crane was moving.
Schmidt picked up his head and glared at Natasha with blood beading on his thin lip. If it could be called a lip? Tony wasn’t sure what to classify Schmidt’s thin mouth but the question that formed immediately disappeared as Natasha hissed, “I swore I would kill you for what you had done to James.”
“Good night, Mr. Stark,” Steve replied. He caught Tony’s hand as he pulled away and squeezed it before letting go. He jogged to the elevator and Jarvis had it open and ready for him.
When Dum Dum fell into a chair and didn't get up, Tony quickly finished his beer with one last swig and announced, “I'll step in.”
“The detail is here,” Natasha informed them and spun around, leaving them alone. Bucky clenched his fists.
Peter’s relief was so powerful that his legs trembled and he slumped to the ground. Not being able to return to his family was horrible but Venom agreeing not to kill anymore was marvelous. Maybe, with time, Venom would be more willing to let him see his family. But, in the meantime…
Cable chuckled and said, “Oh, it will be, but it won’t be involving you much, don’t worry.” His hand hovered over the glove, but he paused and said, “Goodbye, Cap, Stark. I think it’s safe for me to say you two can finally continue that reunion now.”
Steve. He remembered you but still I held back my indignation. We were fighting Hydra, of course that would bring back memories of that period in his life. And when they wiped his mind again and he did not remember you it did not hurt as much.” Natasha paused and stopped her pacing. She gripped her side where she was scarred by Bucky’s bullet and whispered, “And when he saved you from drowning I felt some glimmer of hope that he might have remembered us both…Because that day he shot me, he also did not kill me. He might have remembered me back then too…
“Venom does not concern me, it’s the electricity. You made be a synthetic human but the components that make and do not make you human are all susceptible to electricity,” Bruce argued. Wanda instantly grasped Vision’s bicep and the android leaned into the young woman, placing a comforting hand over hers. Bruce turned back to Wade and stated, “You are the only one in this room that can handle both the electricity and Venom.”
“O-Our baby,” Steve gasped as he grabbed the front of Tony’s shirt and curled his fingers into the fabric. He pulled Tony closer, pressing their chests together, wrapping their arms around each other’s backs, and burying their faces into the other’s shoulder. Despite the embrace, they both trembled. Steve cried, “
Under the hot spray, Peter held him with heavy arms and leaned into him. Warm water fell on him from all over. Wade had to blink the water out of his eyes every few seconds, making it tempting to close his eyes like Peter was doing but didn't want to take his eyes off him.
“Yes, it did,” Steve replied. “When Uncle Bucky remembered the safe word, he was so happy that he cried…He was terrified of losing control and hurting us. So, please, don’t treat it like a joke.”
Peter’s hand tightened even more on Wade’s and his fingertips dug into his flesh. He glanced at his boyfriend and saw Peter’s mouth had tightened into a thin line. He must have also noticed his father refusing to use Wade’s name. Wade lightly caressed the side of Peter’s hand with his thumb and Peter looked to him. Wade smiled gently at him and pressed his shoulder into Peter’s letting him wordlessly know it was alright.
“Stark, we're going to have to have you exit the suit while you are on premises,” one of the agents advised him.
If he lost Wade, Peter couldn’t imagine ever finding love again, because Wade was it. He was the love of Peter’s life and he wouldn’t trade him for anything. Peter had trusted his fragile heart to Wade and he knew it would now only survive in Wade’s hold…and Peter would not have it any other way.
‘Come on, let’s get you seen by medical,’ Steve moves to usher him towards their approaching transport.
He's spent enough time on his own now, though, so he makes himself get the lift to the communal floor.
'Sir,' Jarvis calls out, 'Colonel Rhodes has approved of your chosen names for the children. He will be calling you later when he's able.'
'Anal?' Tony presses a kiss to his nose. 'No, not for your first time. You want to be the catcher though, in future? That's good. I mean I'm versatile; I'm good at it all but if we're talking preferentially I'd rather play dominant.'
'He'll be happy you're here, Cap; he was telling me you should stay in our room if we couldn't find one for you.'
'Voice mail,' he reports. 'Jarvis? Jarvis, it's Steve. Jarvis, we need to talk to Tony. It's really very important...'
'Yeah,' Tony shrugs, 'but if he could see me at all Maria never touched me. At Pete's age he was my hero; he kept her away and he sometimes told me stories. I mean, he was mostly drunk when he did that and the stories were always how amazing Captain America was and how no one else could ever compare, but it was more than I got from anyone else so...' he shrugs again.
He really needs to have a talk with Tony now; clearly he's not made Tony properly aware of his belief that, despite Tony's own assertions, Steve does consider him a full member of the team. He needs Tony to know he would never withhold that sort of information from him on a technicality.
'Already did,' Tony shrugs. 'Jarvis, what says 'sorry I fucked up telling you about how I fucked up by not telling you about our son'?'
Steve is going to throw caution to the wind and just make a grab for Tony but before he can Hulk swings his arm towards Tony.
'Good morning?' Steve doesn't mean it to sound like a question but he's busy wondering if he should step back onto the lift and flee from their stares.
It's so hard to imagine that this nervous little boy could ever become Tony Stark as he knows him now.
‘Sorry!’ Steve blushes and lets go. ‘I don’t know why I did that. It’s great to have you back, Tony. I’ll… see you later.’
Steve chokes out a laugh and then tears are streaming down his face. He makes a gasping sobbing noise and presses his face against Tony’s neck.
‘You ever reset a shoulder, Cap?’ sounds over the comm. immediately followed by a chorus from the rest of the team, even as they’re still fighting, telling him not to be stupid.
'I agreed the permitted names with Rhodey over a decade ago,' Tony makes his excuse, still watching Steve. 'I had a bit of a hero worship thing going on; you can blame Howard.'
'I won't tell him,' Pepper finally agrees, 'but we're going to talk about this again when I get there.'
Steve ends up moving into StarkTower after he’s toured around for a little and it is nice to have somewhere to call his own that isn’t surrounded by SHIELD agents.
'It is not yours either,' the AI adds after a small pause. 'If sir were to add another person to the very small list of those he trusts, it would undoubtedly be you.'
Natasha and Bruce make similar, but less enthusiastic, motions towards greeting their fellow Avenger. Quickly the exchanges establish that there's nothing wrong and Thor is just visiting.
'That's great Tony,' she can feel his enthusiasm and grins back at him as he strips off his suit. 'What was wrong with that suit?'
Two days later Tony comes down from his penthouse, rubbing sleep from his eyes and looking, to Steve’s eyes, beautifully dishevelled in worn silk pyjamas.
'If you hurt him there's a good chance the world will be plunged into a economic depression that it won't be able to recover from,' Clint tells him with a grin.
'Well, ok,' Steve's flustered look is hidden when Tony just looks back down at his work. 'When do you want breakfast?'
He walks over to his partner, gets between him and the kitchen table, and straddles his lap. He's kissing Steve before the bigger man can object.
'Oh, like either of them would argue with you...' she mutters. She forgets how sensitive the mics are in StarkTabs.
‘No,’ Tony snaps now. ‘You don’t get to freak out about that. You get along with him perfectly well; I’ve heard you talking to him.’
‘Oh, fuck, are you crying?’ Tony sounds positively horrified. ‘Christ, Steve, don’t do that. I don’t know how to deal with that. Butterfingers, get Steve a… a cup of tea! That’s a thing. Steve, it’s ok, you’ll have some tea.’
'Tony?' Pepper's voice sounds out a moment later and her face is projected on a screen over the bed.
Steve pulls him back into a hug that has his face tucked against the bare skin of his friend's neck.
Jarvis English?' Steve puts half a sandwich into Tony's hand in the off chance it will trick him into eating it.
Tony pads along after him, just wearing some loose pants, as he gets Pete dressed and pours him a beaker of milk. He's getting the ingredients together for French toast as Tony slumps next to the coffee machine and refills his mug.
Steve jolts in surprise and gazes over at him with wide eyes. Eyes which turn adoring as he looks Tony over.
Dummy manages to bring him a plate of toast and only drops, and runs over, one of the pieces. Tony eats it all anyway.
'You're generous and selfless,' he looks like complimenting Tony may be causing him pain. 'Show him that you want him involved in your sons' lives.'
‘I’m saying that the reactor casing is being corroded inside my chest,’ Tony glances up again. ‘I’m saying that the people attacking that bank were probably only doing so to get our attention, though they probably expected it to take longer than it did. I’m saying that I need to figure out how to neutralise this or receiving the new reactor won’t help.’
'Definitely,' Tony groans as he pushes himself upright. 'You go make sure there's some in the pot for me, ok?'
The boy tucks himself tighter to Tony's chest as they go outside, burying his face against the arc reactor and away from the wind that races across the deck. They move quickly over to the jet and up the steps as the flight crew finish the preparations for take off.
'Oh, I'm going to kill him!' Pepper declares as she pushes passed the doctor to stand closer to the window.
Steve feels strangely lonely after he leaves the penthouse. It's incredible how much he already adores that little boy and his regard for Tony has reached new heights after seeing him as a father.
Steve shoots him a strange look and then just laughs as he walks past Peter playing with his nerf gun and sits beside him,
