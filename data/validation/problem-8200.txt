Daybreak found Tony sitting on the floor of his bedroom, in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows, staring out at the horizon. The light eventually awakened Steve and Tony heard as Steve’s thick arm reached to touch the left side of their bed, heard rustling as he sat up to investigate where Tony might have gone. He heard Steve exhale as he most surely spotted him sitting on the floor in front of the bed. He felt the vibration of Steve’s steps on the hardwood, felt him stop just shy of a step.
There’s a whole lot of questions Tony wants to ask Vivi about this little surprise with the most prominent being, ‘why?’ but experience has taught him that there’s no prying anything out of the woman when she has that gleam in her eyes. Regardless he doesn’t have to wonder long because in seconds, they’ve reached Stephen’s floor. The hallways are all sleek looking and polished, exactly the kind of place Tony would have liked to live in once upon a time. The kids stick uncharacteristically close to their parents, their eyes taking in the clean lines and scented halls with weary admiration.
Steve didn’t mind.
Logically Steve understands that he is overreacting. He sees the ‘kid’ in his bike gear, the smell of sweat clinging to him and knows the boy was just trying to deliver the order as quickly as possible. He also knows that his miso soup leaking onto his tempura is not a crisis… and yet…
There’s no pity in Steve’s eyes, nothing but the profound shared understanding of the damned.
Like Steve’s life wasn’t worth shit.
He should go home… talking to Tony will calm him… Tony will understand…
“Why?”
Especially after Rhodey went back to the US Military full time.
“Sir?”
It was moments like those that made him thankful his husband’s middle name was discretion… Steve ‘Discretion’ Stark.
Tony was smiling up at him.
They choose the name of Dr. Evelyn Baker and go a little overboard with it. “The more realistic it is the more likely he will accept the invite.” Siggy explains as she dictates the Facebook profile to Harley.
Shortly after that, Steve was able to successfully secure the acquisition of Advanced Idea Mechanics into Stark Solutions, placing Killian’s business partner Maja Hansen as the lead scientist on the project.
That’s just the way it was.
Since there was amusement in Steve’s smile, Tony wasn’t sure if he was getting teased since, but then he remembered that his husband wasn’t a joker. The relentless banter he shared with Rhodey, Bruce or even Pepper had never been a thing that he and Steve did. Steve was serious man, he recognized humour and loved to laugh, but he just wasn’t one for banter.
“See Loki, you have so much in common already.” Vivi shares a conspiratory gleam with Sigrid who looks particularly proud of herself. “Well I think it’s time for us to let y’all talk in private. Come on my loves.”
“Yeah, I heard the trail had gone cold, but it’s so exciting that you were a part of it!” In reality Tony had hardly really heard anything about it, not because it hadn’t been on the news but because he’d simply not cared enough to go hunting for the story. The height of the Avenger killer fever had coincided with the worst of Tony’s illness so he’d mostly been too preoccupied to give anything else much thought.
Tony was beautiful like this, creatively fulfilled, feeling like he was part of a team of geniuses all working together to better the world. For decades, Steve thought he would never see Peter Parker again. He thought him lost in the frenzy of multi-dimensional creation, then one day ten years ago, he appeared. Peter was all grown up, the owner of a PHD in bio-engineering in his own right. It turned out that Ben Parker hadn’t died in this reality and so Peter had simply gone on to lead a normal life, (well as normal as any genius could). He’d actually been the recipient of several SI scholarships along the years so he’d always been somewhat affiliated with the Starks in one way or another. Steve just hadn’t bothered to search.
‘By all the gods in the universe was I ever this young?’ Steve took in the smooth clean shaven skin of the other Steve, the haircut, the clothes, the look of him. There was something about this kid that made Steve want to punch him in the teeth. Beside Captain America, Bucky Barnes lay on a medical table but even like this he put Steve Stark on edge, there was something unhinged about his eyes that Steve didn’t trust. And finally, by the foot of the bed, looking like a deer about to hit a car, Sharon Carter (a footnote in his list of conquests) had the stupidest expression he’d ever seen on her face.
“What?”
“Uncle Tony?”
“Uncle Steve!”
There was something new in Steve’s eyes, something wild and panicked, as if something was coming undone.
The girl looked to be in her mid-twenties. She had dark black hair, caramel coloured skin and the look of Regime-raised all over. She walked like a soldier and said nothing as Commander walked her to one of the couches. Once they were all settled, Steve retracted the armour.
It's time for a group chat chapter! These are always my favorites ;) I hope you enjoy it!
They were silent after that, both lost in their own thoughts as Tony finished cutting Bucky's hair, cleaning up the edges with his electric razor. When he was finally satisfied he stepped back and nodded appreciatively.
Which, well. Steve could use all the help he could get with those.
He grunted when Tony’s nails scratched over his shoulder, desperately trying to grab hold while his other hand was a blur on his cock. Steve could see tiny drops of sweat on his forehead and he itched to wipe them away, or maybe just lick them off –
Surprise! This chapter is really short but I hope you still enjoy it. Thanks for reading!
“Excuse you, DUM-E broke the vial. I just happened to be there.”
“I had Jane fetch us coffee from Beanies.”
Tony's heart twinged with a sudden rush of affection. “I always enjoy our time together.”
“You're a pig,” Natasha said flatly as Steve's brow furrowed in a thoughtful frown. He almost seemed a little tense, his hands clutching his beer bottle in a tight grip. Not that Toni was staring at him or anything. “At least Toni keeps it classy.”
“You look beautiful,” Steve said, his voice weirdly quiet and subdued as though he wasn't sure if he should even say it.
Tony picked up as much of the fallen pie filling as he could before he folded the tray and put the whole thing in the trash. Steve was already in the shower when he joined him, wrapping his arms around his waist from behind.
“Thank you.” The honest relief in her voice made Tony's stomach twist with guilt. “Anything else I can do for you today?”
Steve's hips started twitching under his hands where Tony was holding him down, and Tony could feel the tension building as Steve's back arched, his breathing coming faster and faster as he bent over Tony, his free hand clenching in Tony's hair.

“Yeah, well, I have a problem with that!”
“Well.” Tony laid his head back down on Steve's chest, rubbing circles into his tense stomach. “We'll deal with it when it happens. It's gonna be fine.”
“I'm sorry,” he choked out. “I know it's disgusting, I know what it – that it looks horrible, but I swear, I wanted to tell you so many times and I'm sorry that I wasted so much of your time –“
Steve was pretty sure he tore the buttons clean off as he shoved his pants down his legs, just far enough that his cock bounced up against his stomach, and Tony's eyes went dark.
to touch me?” he asked, not quite sure where this sudden brazenness came from, but Tony just grinned knowingly, his eyes twinkling with mirth.
“Right.” Tony watched Steve's throat bob as he swallowed. “So, uh. Who goes first?”
“Then put your back into it.”
That was a relief. Steve read through the form before he signed it, sliding it back over to Ms. Potts who tucked it into a folder.
“No, no, I understood you just fine.” Pepper steepled her hands under her chin, looking at him from across the desk. “So, let me get this straight. You enjoy spending time with Steve, a

, why was he having so much trouble with this?
Tony choked on the rest of his sentence when Steve suddenly thrust up into him,
Tony’s nest. That much was clear when it was basically a three person job to try and get Steve out of it once he’d fallen asleep there. Not that Tony was actively trying. But the conclusion that Steve seemed to enjoy soft fabrics did lead to Tony conducting a series of experiments to prove his hypothesis, if only to himself.
“Is that good?” Tony asked and Steve nodded numbly, trying to force a smile onto his lips even as his worst fear came to life right in front of him.
“Yes, but do you like the idea of being bonded with one of those alphas you mentioned?”
Tony snorted, the tension breaking as Steve joined in his laughter on the other end of the line. “Jesus Christ. Don't scare me like that.”
“Don't forget to take pictures,” Tony mumbled, and Steve's eyes snapped open, looking down at Tony before he nodded determinedly, grabbing the external shutter that Pepper had mounted to the camera. “Make sure you get my good side,” Tony said with a wink, and Steve gave a strangled laugh that abruptly cut off when Tony finally put him in his mouth.
Steve stilled the drumming of his fingers on his own cup, swallowing hard. “Sorry.”
“Great,” Steve said, his voice barely more than a croak, and Mr. Stark gave him one more smile before he walked away, a spring in his step. It took Steve a second to tear his eyes away from Mr. Stark’s…
. Please, just –“
“Alright.” Tony yawned, not even bothering to cover his mouth. “Sorry.”
Another hit actually
“Thank fuck,” Clint groaned, popping his neck as he stretched, folding himself out of the chair. “I need a shower or three.”
“Oh, uh. I mean, if we – yeah, sure. I guess.”
“He's so
"Okay. You just want me to talk?"
“You don't know what I'll do!” Steve protested, still holding out the vibranium cuffs Tony had made for the occasion. “It's safer this way. Fury said it could take anywhere between fourteen and twenty hours before it hits –“
“Of course it was.” Bucky smiled humorlessly. “Don't you read the papers?”
“Alright. Everyone say 'I'm feeling lucky',” Tony said before he hit the button on the side of the machine and it whirred to life, spinning the drum as the tickets inside tumbled all over themselves. Tony walked around the machine until his back was facing the camera before he bent over the table it was standing on, propping his head up on his hands and watching the tickets fly round and round.
“Yeah. If you want to.”
“So, Thai. What's the verdict?”
ticket in the raffle?” Tony asked incredulously, shaking his head. “Jesus fuck. What are the odds?”
Steve chuckled, lubing up his fingers before he leaned over to kiss Tony, propping himself up on one elbow. Tony let him in with a swipe of his tongue and Steve waited for the moment that Tony’s shoulders sagged as he melted into it before he started tracing his wet fingers down Tony’s ass, circling his hole. Tony hummed, arching a little when Steve pushed the first one inside, mirroring the action with his tongue.
“And clean up on aisle four,” Tony said with a nod at the mess they'd made of the pie – and the floor surrounding it. “Hot damn. You really went for it.”
Steve looked off to the side, his face tense as he worried his lip between his teeth. “I can't sign the Accords as they are now. If we could get them amended...”
“I’m not, I’m just saying –“
Best regards,
Tony glanced up as Natasha folded herself into the armchair next to him with the grace of a cat, her eyes twinkling with barely concealed humor. He sighed. “Am I about to get trolled?”
“And got tested?” Steve interrupts with a beginning frown on his forehead.
Steve laughs, even though it’s a little winded still. “I do, baby, I do. Thank you so much.” He leans down to kiss the top of his son’s head before leaning over to do the same to Tony’s mouth. “Thank you,” he whispers against his husband’s lips.
“Overbearing,
“Pete, I still have some work to do. Someone needs to bribe Santa for all those presents your Papa is going to get. But I’ll tell you a secret.”
“It’s ok, baby. You don’t have to say anything if you don’t want to or can’t think of something. You can just sit here with me and show Papa you’re there. That ok?”
Tony tried to push it all down, tried to concentrate on
Thankfully he doesn’t have to coax an answer out of his mind because his son dashes into the room again, this time jumping on the bed and dragging at both Tony and Steve.
“You will.” Tony kisses him again. “My son is very talented.”
Peter eyes first the phone in Steve’s hands, then his Papa skeptically. Knowing where this is heading, Steve has to work really hard to suppress the smile when he asks if he should turn the speaker off. Peter needs another moment to decide, but then nods wildly, holding out his hands to accept the phone. Steve does as he’s told.
They finished preparing the chicken Tony had picked out to be their dinner and once it was cooking away in the oven they took care of the tree. Tony could see that Steve still had problems, bending down, picking things up, still favoring his right side, but the man was stubborn. He didn’t let Peter know he wasn’t alright. Tony was still worried. If he could have it his way Steve would be in medical, not wincing when he wanted to lift his son into his arms. A task he was usually able to perform even with Tony without breaking a sweat thanks to the super soldier serum, never mind their son.
“You sure about that?” a deep voice suddenly rumbled in his ear. Tony froze. What. No, that couldn’t be - it couldn’t be Steve, his Steve -
For a moment longer Steve’s gaze bore through him, right to the back of his skull. Then his eyes flew back to Peter. Tony still couldn’t breathe right, but it was getting easier, knowing that Steve should’ve, would’ve dropped everything if he had been able to.
That the kid is even aware of how close to Bruce’s birthday they actually are (or how close that is to Christmas) is a miracle, Steve thinks. He wouldn’t have thought Peter to have a grasp of that already. Sure, he’s a smart kid, but usually he still lives from day to day, maybe until the weekend if they have something planned, but Steve can’t argue with his logic. They are close to Bruce’s birthday and Steve hasn’t even started decorating yet, a task he usually starts with as soon as Natasha’s birthday’s over.
He just wants to declare as much to his son when Peter practically freezes in his spot, green pencil he’s been drawing tinsels with hovering over the paper. Before he can ask about it, though, the pencil falls and Pete scrambles off his seat
“Pep’s almost literally throwing daggers at me right now,” Tony soundly interrupts him. “Bye, bye, love you, gotta go.”
Sometimes Steve hates being right. “Yeah, I do,” he sighs.
“Our son,” Tony whispers into Steve’s ear, correcting himself without being prompted. “And you’ll love it. I promise.”
He’s burst out of his bubble when Tony sighs. He sounds as reluctant as Steve feels when he starts his next sentence with, “Hey, you two, listen…”
She leans in conspiratorially, whispering, “Bruce has a pot in the kitchen. But you’ll have to be careful. He’s still in cooking-mode.” Meaning, close to letting the Hulk throw out everyone sneaking into and/or standing around uselessly in his kitchen.
“How about,” he suggested as a way of distraction, “we go upstairs and see what’s left in the fridge for dinner?”
“You’re lucky I already love you because with that attitude you’re walking a thin line, Rogers.” Tony passed by his husband and followed Peter into the kitchen. Steve only smirked.
“And hasn’t been thrown out yet?” Steve frowns. That’s… mysterious. When Bruce cooks he usually doesn’t allow people to stand in his way and disturb his Zen. “Huh.”
“Straight as Uncle Clint!” Peter grinned broadly. Tony couldn’t help but return it. And hadn’t he taught that expression to the kid himself he would’ve been scandalized. Birdbrain sure had been the first time he’d heard it before he’d broken out in laughter that continued for the better part of team/family dinner.
Tony knew, too. There was only one thing that wouldn’t make Steve cry from joy in the course of December. He couldn’t remember exactly what he’d done in the shop that day, but on December 16
that you wouldn’t even be home for Christmas! And-“
At which Steve simply shoves him towards the edge of the bed. “Out. Get out of my bed.” Thankfully Tony’s awake enough by now that he doesn’t fall, but simply laughs while scrambling off. Steve shakes his head, but soon joins in his jovial mood. It’s Christmas after all and he’s actually dying to find out what they’ve come up with.
Tony watched with rapt attention as his boys made their peace. It made his heart feel light in a way it hadn’t in a couple of months.
“I do, Buck. Still can’t believe it sometimes.”
“I love being your incorrigible man,” Tony says in that soft tone that makes Steve’s heart bloom. His smile wobbles a little.
“Then I’ll have to pick the one from three and a half weeks back, the first Sunday in Advent. The one where you showed me the snowmen you crafted and painted in preschool. You looked so happy and proud of yourself, and all I wanted to do was kiss your cheek at tell you how much I’d loved one of those on my desk. That was the one that made me miss you the most because I wanted to tell you how proud I was.”
“Then we’re good to go.”
“Can we talk to Papa today?”
Bucky straitens his back. “I’m a former assassin. I can work this.” He’s off before Steve can complain about the presence of alcohol in his house when they’re expecting kids.
“But we’re going to have one, right? Right, Papa?”
“Please just tell me you didn’t buy another island.”
Steve can only smile. Maybe he’ll get into the spirit after all.
Tony understood the remark. After all, he’d never set foot into a kitchen before they’d had Peter besides for coffee. But since they’d had an infant around and Steve had been unnecessarily caught up at his day job at SHIELD Tony had taken it upon himself to get a warm meal on the table at least once a day. FRIDAY had been an enormous help with that, preventing not only once that he’d set the whole kitchen on fire.
“You’re mocking me.”
“So I was just talking about what we’re planning for-“
Again, Peter only shook his head, mumbled something about needing the tree to be pretty. Tony thought maybe he missed his Papa even more than he let on. As the artsy type in their family it usually was Steve’s part decorating the house in December and the tree a couple of days before Christmas. Usually Peter was the best little helper he could ever have, according to Steve. Much better than Tony had ever been, as he’d told his husband in a quiet moment a couple of years back. Tony had sulked for about three minutes. Was he to blame for the fact that he had never participated in decorating a Christmas tree in his life until Steve had barged in? He hadn’t thought so. Didn’t think so still.
Pete throws himself into his lap, tightens his arms around Steve’s neck in a tight hug that his Papa can only wholeheartedly return. Until the allure of the blinking tree and more importantly, the presents under it, becomes too much and Peter’s off to tear through them, drawing soft smiles from both his dads. He’s sitting in front of the first one, the one Sam’s brought over, Steve thinks, when he hesitates. Without saying a word he gets up again, takes Steve’s hand and drags him over to the dining table and accusingly points at it.
“It has to stand here,” he pats his hand right where he wants his present to be displayed and Steve immediately complies, “and the drawing on the-“
Faster than both Tony and Steve could react the boy had struggled free from their embrace, jumped off the couch and glared at him with fire in his eyes. “So you didn’t watch them! You can’t even pick one!”
Peter is way more excited for his Papa to open his present than he is about opening his own and that should’ve made Steve at least a little suspicious. But as it’s Christmas morning he doesn’t think too much of it. Instead he pulls Peter over to the couch so that he can see Steve opening the present. Tony joins them, sits down on Pete’s other side and watches with a big smile over the kid’s head as his husband carefully pulls at the ribbon.
Now it’s Steve who pulls him closer, wrapping his body as best around his husband as he can with a steaming hot cup in his one and Tony’s pretty face in his other hand.
“Is that Daddy?”
“Well, we should say it more often then, since it’s very much true.”
He looked down to see Peter had mirrored his pose. Patiently he waited for the kid’s verdict.
Tony didn’t know where the kid got that from, but he wanted Christmas to be perfect. This year it wouldn’t be. His Papa still wasn’t home.
Or tried to, at least. He hadn’t calculated that it was usually Steve’s job to hang those damn branches up into one of the doorways. That Tony had designed unusually high in some kind of genius crackpot idea. Because
Tony smirks at him. Propping his elbow on the wall, he peers down at Steve’s sketchpad.
“You have been nothing,” Obie says, moving around to stand in front of Tony, “but the giant, time-travelling albatross around my neck. Oh, come on, don’t look at me like that, kiddo.”
. You know me, 100% impossible to set on fire. Wish I could say the same for that mailbox.”
“And that’s why you let me live.”
Tony salutes him, “Aye aye, Cap,” and then he leaps to his feet, rubbing his hands together. “Enough chitchat. Chile. HYDRA. What have you got for us? Show me the souvenirs.”
“That’s not important.”
“You’re a really clever computer,” Steve points out.
After a little while, Steve gets up and heads back to the elevator, where he hits the button for the basement.
He listens to Bucky pause and breathe and then leave. He wiggles his fingers, which hurts, but only barely now, lost in the comfortable haze of Mr Barnes’ borrowed whiskey. The bedsprings creak next to him, beneath the weight of another body.
“The light quality?” Steve suggests.
“What’s that got to do with money?”
“You must be Captain Rogers,” she says. “You’re – wow, you’re really wet. You’re just in time for Dancing With The Stars.”
“It’s cosy. Not everyone needs a whole tower to feel comfortable.”
“Ms Potts is currently in a meeting, reviewing the budget with heads of department,” JARVIS says. “I’m sure you would be welcome to join her until your meeting with Colonel Fury.”
He crams his hands deep into his pockets, staying put. He knows he’s too damn short to search for Bucky in a crowd like this, and here is where they last saw each other; the least he can do is make it easier for Bucky to search for
Natasha quirks an eyebrow, her eyes flickering to Tony, but she reaches behind her – without looking; she must have memorised the room’s layout and its contents the second she stepped inside – and snags a dishcloth. Wrapping it around her hand, she pulls the gun towards her and lifts it up for a closer look.
Steve runs his hand across the scarred desktop, then ducks down to look underneath.
“Did you invite the whole street along?” Tony says, lifting the faceplate to peer incredulously down at him. “Are we gonna have a parade?”
It’s not at all comfortable, being lugged through the sky like a sack of potatoes while he clings onto the all-too-smooth armour for dear life. He can’t even keep his eyes open long enough to admire the view, but it’s worth it for the sensations alone. For the wind in his hair.
The boy stood in the middle of the room, Christmas tree in his back, and looked torn between shame, regret and reluctant joy. Tony hadn’t seen his face with emotions that mixed since he’d come home from preschool and told them some of the other kids had teased him because of his parentage.
There has been a big discussion about the festivities and how they would take place this year. Covid is spreading, and fast. And just because Steve is a super soldier and can neither contract nor transfer it, he doesn’t want to be responsible for any of his friends,
“Hey buddy,” Steve pressed out through clenched teeth. Tony was this shy of ripping the kid away from him, grabbing him by the scruff of the neck and dragging him off to the med wing five floors down. Steve only shrugged Tony’s death glare off with one shoulder before leaning in again.
Peter’s glance darted from Steve to the ground, to Tony and back to Steve. It was somewhat unsure, but he was just as stubborn as his Papa. Certainly stubborn enough to pull through with what he’d started.
His eyes are still glinting dangerously and Steve doesn’t know if he should be suspicious or excited for what’s to come.
Peter thankfully didn’t hesitate. His bottom lip was still trembling. It only caused Tony to tighten his arms around his son. He hated seeing Peter in pain. Maybe he might spoil the kid, but he didn’t care. Peter had to go through a childhood of one parent mostly missing. Wasn’t that enough? No, now his Papa had decided to take on another damn mission.
“And I love you, Tony Stark.”
be glad it’s only a handful more days until Christmas.”
Staring at him intently with wide eyes, Peter stilled noticeably so suddenly Tony was instantly worried.
“You ever realize you’re a really lucky guy, Stevie?” Bucky’s hand lands heavily on his shoulder. Steve’s smile only widens.
“Guess we broke Papa, big guy,” he hears Tony murmur somewhere next to them. It’s enough to prompt Steve to swallow down the lump in his throat and wipe away his tears after he’s pulled back.
Steve just wants to propose they settle down with a book or a movie and cuddle on the couch some more when the kid is seemingly struck by lightning and struggles to get out of his arms. Steve has trouble not letting him fall, surprised by the sudden change of pace, but over the years he has managed to accommodate rather well. He suspects the kid has a plan of his own.
The rest of the team came just in time for the chicken to be served. It was a wonderful, peaceful evening. Tony let the joyful babbling wash over him, practically soaked up the atmosphere. It had turned into a tradition to spend Christmas Eve with their fellow Avengers, with their friends, their found family, having a meal together and exchanging presents that would rest under the tree until morning.
Hands raised in defense, Tony leans back again. Steve can see in the crinkles around his eyes that he’s stifling the smile. A little smile on his own lips, he concentrates on lifting the lid to finally see the contents of the box.
One memorable morning, when his brain’s still half asleep, he even suspects Tony’s bought another island (as nice as that vacation had been, he needn’t have
“Of course I do.”
“Alright, alright. I’m right behind you.” He drags a hand over the kid’s hair. “I’ll convince Papa to make us breakfast while you go brush your teeth.” Gently, he pushes him off him and goes untangling himself from the covers. Steve thinks his heart bursts with love for his two men. Infatuated as he is, Steve pulls his husband close before Tony can make his way out of the bed, pressing another kiss to his lips that ends in smiles on both their lips.
“You two make me age with every minute I don’t know about your secret present.”
“Guess what?” Tony breathes into the small space between them. It still takes Steve a couple of seconds to recover from that kiss and gather his thoughts enough to speak.
As he lifted Peter onto his lap he put up a smile for his son. “What are you doing down here? And without socks or shoes?” The scolding tone had made itself at home in his voice. A side effect of having the kid for almost six years now, Tony suspected.
Tony spun around on his chair, facing his son. Peter stood in the workshop,
“… and, and Auntie Nat thought she could wrap them faster than me, but I’ve wrapped enough presents that I’m fast as light! Even faster than Papa!”
“Daddy?” Peter’s voice was soft, but when Tony made some agreeing noise, he continued. “You’re allowed to miss him, too.” It sounded like he wanted to say more, but somehow couldn’t bring himself to. Tony waited it out, gave him the time he needed. In the end, Peter added in one long breath, “Last week Miss Knight said it’s alright to miss your friends when you can’t see them in preschool or for a play date and it’s the same with Papa, isn’t it? Right?”
“Daddy! Papa!” Peter barges into their bedroom, slamming the door against the wardrobe. “It’s Christmas!” And storms out of the room again just as quickly, clearly making his way into the living room.
The scream that wakes Steve in the morning is ear-shattering. For a moment he thinks something’s happened, that Pete is actually in danger because of - whatever, but the scream is immediately followed by an obvious squeal of joy and that makes Steve relax back into the sheets. Tony next to him only groans once before flopping down face first onto Steve’s chest.
“I can feel you’re overthinking it. It’s Christmas Eve, babe. Let that high-functioning brain of yours have some holiday time, too.”
When he comes into their bedroom this time he jumps right into Tony’s lap, pushing Steve almost bodily out of the way. It only makes Steve chuckle lightly as his husband maneuvers their son out of the way enough so that he can sit up.
He’s still tense when he sits down next to his son, but Peter soon manages to distract him. With his babbling and sudden joyful, almost put-on mood he should be more suspicious of the kid’s motives, but he’s so strongly reminded of Tony that Steve decides to not look too closely. Instead he lets himself be swept away, lets himself get lost in working with his hands and helping his son along with his works, supplying advice about Natasha’s soon-to-be sparkly unicorn ornament and Pepper’s canvas-sized painting depicting all of the Avengers clustered around a massive, decorated Christmas tree on the common floor. At that point Steve realizes they haven’t even done
He pulled back a little, looking at his son. Tony swiped the kid’s brown hair out of his face and placed a kiss on the top of his head.
“I am, buddy. Thank you for making this Christmas so special.”
It really was Steve’s luck that Peter decided he wanted in on the cuddling now, too, because otherwise Tony would’ve given him another piece of his mind right then and there. The kid collided with their legs and Steve swayed uncharacteristically. Tony felt the need to support and steady his husband. But since he was Tony Stark he made it look casual.
, and that had nothing to do with him being prude, thank you), but Peter’s giggling makes him abandon that idea rather quickly.
son?”
Tony was halfway off to sleep himself when the bundle at his side spoke up again, drawing in Tony’s attention.
Peter’s voice was so small, like it was every time he asked when his Papa was gone. And every time it broke Tony’s heart a little more.
When Peter couldn’t get three words out in a row without yawning Bruce suggested they called it a night. The kid protested to that heavily, but was interrupted by his own yawning regularly, making the adults laugh softly. It took a little convincing, but in the end the other Avengers were allowed to leave and Steve maneuvered the three of them onto the couch. The TV was on, showing some kids movie on low volume, in hopes of lulling Peter fully into sleep.
“How ‘bout now?”
Oh, things have to be serious if the kid brings out ‘Dad’.
“He won’t watch it anyway! He never calls and he never watches the videos! I heard you say it on the phone!”
Steve actually groans. Much to his surprise, it’s ultimately Pete who saves him from more silly jokes.
The more details he takes in the closer are his tears to spilling.
Steve just laughed, heartily, left arm slung around his middle, and it sounded like bells. Tony didn’t care how cheesy that sounded, but Steve’s heartfelt laugh was lighting up the whole room, including his chest and the cavity where his artificial heart had once been.
“I miss him, too, Daddy,” Pete mumbled.
“Is that spiked? You’re allowing this, Steven?”
“I’m clever.” The smile was obvious in his voice. Tony didn’t need to look to hear it. “Miss Knight says so. And you and Papa say it, too, sometimes.”
“Hey, not fair! My son is very talented when it comes to making gifts!”
“Of course it’s ok, Pete. I know he’s away a lot and when he’s here sometimes I have to go on business trips.” He sighed. SI business was finished for the year. Pepper had kicked him out of her office with a snide comment about how he’d done his duty and that he should take care of his family, work could wait until January. But it would come, even though Tony’d made it a policy that he’d only be at the meetings he absolutely had to attend since otherwise Pepper would have his head. The rest of the time his little family was priority #1.
“Papa?” he lowly asks. “Are you done moping now?” He looks at him expectantly. Steve fondly smiles at his kid, dragging a hand over his head.
“What do you think?”
Anyway, it was his boys’ duty to decorate their home and now Steve wasn’t here to help. Of course that got to the kid. Tony swallowed thickly.
He was halfway to ordering groceries worth a whole supermarket and
the mistletoe before you kiss Daddy!”
Tony directed his glance back to his husband. He hadn’t known about that. A long lost sense of panic raised its ugly head, one that Tony hadn’t thought he’d get to see again.
“I… I actually don’t know what to say,” he finally started, remembering their rules about communication, especially where feelings were concerned. He bit his lip, trying to will back the tears. For the moment he succeeded.
“You’re not even listening to a word I say.” But Tony’s smiling, he can hear it in his voice.
As soon as he’s finished Pete snatches the phone practically out of his hands, pressing it tightly to his ear with both hands.
The rest of the box is covered in Peter’s handprints in various colors. At closer inspection Steve sees that small screws keep the lid firmly in place. Totally unnecessary, but nevertheless sweet. Steve suspects Peter has asked his Dad to add a touch of his own with that since the handprints are mostly his.
At his next words Steve’s eyes were on him. “He was in the workshop which you’re not allowed in without him knowing.” He threw Peter a snide side glance, but his eyes quickly darted back to Tony. His eyes were shining with something dark, but wonderful and Tony couldn’t breathe right. “And you told FRIDAY to zoom in to let me see what he was doing. There was some strange agitation in your voice that I couldn’t place at first, but when I saw what he was looking at, I knew.”
Yet again, Steve is amazed at the kid’s grasp on time (though maybe Tony told him a couple of days or weeks ago). But he’s absolutely right. They’d decided to take turns in buying the tree for the common floor after Thor had blown out a whole window during a fight over the “most festive tree in this house” three years ago. So they had established a yearly rotation, giving everyone the opportunity to buy the
- and see to it that the relationship with his son didn’t have to suffer any more than it already did.
“Merry Christmas.”
Peter’s eyes widened with every word Steve said. Tony could relate, though probably due to different reasons.
miss you, babe.” Another sigh that he couldn’t stop. He bit his lip again, but even though he tried really hard to hold it back, the words left his mouth in a barely suppressed murmur. “You shouldn’t have taken that mission.” Which was immediately followed by, “Crap. I didn’t want to say that. I’m sorry, I know how important this stuff is to you, it’s just…” He hid his eyes behind his hands. “Being a single parent most of the time is just… hard, I guess.” Shortly his gaze snapped to the other monitor where - Tony felt the blood in his veins turn to ice. Pete was gone.
“Will you tell me?”
“Do you want to open your present?” Peter whispers against his cheek after a while, clearly getting restless again, vibrating with the need to give him his present.
In the end he couldn’t seem to find anything, only asked if they really,
“Right you are, Pete, I don’t.” He throws his husband a dirty glare for bringing the island-issue up again, but thinks it falls a little flat, if he has to judge by the mischievous, loving glint in Tony’s eyes. “I’d rather like to see what’s in here.” He tilts the present in his hands from one side to the other carefully, afraid to shake it too hard in case it might be fragile. Who knows what his two boys have come up with? Steve certainly doesn’t.
He put up a smile, though he strongly suspected it was too sad. Peter saw through such things scarily easily.
Tony let Peter break away from him. He made sure the kid didn’t fall or otherwise hurt himself, but let him storm off in his anger. For a moment he watched the kid, but in the end couldn’t hold back the heavy sigh.
“’M sorry, Papa! I’m so sorry I didn’t believe you! Daddy always told me you got them and that you watched them because we’re important to you, but I didn’t believe him and I’m sorry. And, and you never answered any one of them, not even the ones
“We have to make it go away.”
you didn’t want anything to do with us anymore and FRIDAY said you’d call back when you had the time and you never did! And Rita form preschool said her father did the same when he left her and her mom and I know that you wouldn’t leave just like that, but I was so
“You actually do?” Steve asks for a good reason. “Because four years ago I had to stop you from buying a whole-“
Pete giggles, snuggling deeper into Steve’s side, immediately sensing the drama in his Papa’s voice. Over the years Steve’s learned how to be overly dramatic for the kid’s entertainment. By now he just can’t help it sometimes. It’s almost second nature to make Peter giggle. At the boy’s laughter Steve buries his nose in his son’s hair, groaning like he’s fatally wounded. It only makes Peter laugh out louder and Steve can’t help but to press his lips to the side of the kid’s head shortly. This kid’s laugh has always managed to make him swoon, but the longer he’s exposed to it the deeper he’s sucked into his small circle of light.
“Communicators,” Tony says, cutting the call with a press of the shield. He bounces on his heels and stares at the - communicator in Steve’s hand. “Neat, huh? Beats the hell out of SHIELD’S tech – I don’t even know what those were made from, Lego? I’m pretty sure it was Lego. These are still just prototypes. Need to Hulk-proof them, coordinate with Thor, don’t think my network reaches all the way to Asgard just yet. They’re only touchscreen now, so you’d have to pull off your fabulous red gloves to press the buttons and that’s exhausting, I’m tired just thinking about it. Who cares about touchscreen anymore, anyway? Even grandmas use touchscreens, I’m just saying. Touch is over, I’m thinking earpieces, voice command. Give me a week and a copy of Neuroscience for Dummies and I could probably whip up an implant-”
The springs shift back into place again and there’s a pause before Tony clears his throat. “How – how
“Yeah, this – this seemed like a better idea at the time,” Tony says. “Hey, it works! But I look like a fourth grade production of the Wizard of Oz.”
“Are you a good cook?”
“I saw a robot!” Pepper shouts back. “But it’s – I think it drowned.”
Steve nods against Tony’s hand and feels the grip loosen, although Tony leans in even closer. His voice drops to the barest hint of a whisper: “He’s alive, he’s fine, he lives close by.”
This is Steve, moving forwards, even further into the future.
“Just speak English,” Steve says.
“Are they in the communicators?”
who feels the shame.”
” Steve asks. “In your time?”
He pulls away again. He closes his eyes, with Steve’s hands on his face.
if you're into that.
Steve sighs. He glances at the window into the living room, then back at Tony again. Tony, frosting in his goatee, raises his eyebrows at him.
His hand creeps back up Tony’s chest and down his arm, tracing where the veins are – where the wires used to be – until he reaches Tony’s wrists. His fingers, where they touch Tony’s skin, are warmer than the cufflinks could ever be.
“I’m not so sure about the eighties,” Steve says.
Tony smirks. He drums an arrhythmic tune against the bar top, then rocks back on his heels and shoves his hands deep into his pockets. “Wrong place at the wrong time. I’ve heard that one before.”
“It’s a little from column A, a little from column B,” Tony says. “Chips?”
“You weren’t complaining last time,” Tony says, but although the words are harsh there’s a note of uncertainty. Steve lifts his head. Tony is still standing six feet away, body tense as if
Back up in the penthouse, Tony leads Steve straight to the kitchen. It’s just as huge as Steve remembers it being, brightly lit in the mid-morning sunshine. Its two occupants are a new sight, though.
“Ah, ah, hold it!” Tony exclaims, though he’s smirking. “Touch responsive.”
Obie stares down at him, breathing heavily, his grip on Tony’s face growing tighter. Tony blinks. Tony breathes. It’s all that he can do.
“I got stabbed a little,” she says, eventually, once he’s starting to shift uncomfortably from foot to damp foot. “They sent me home to rest and recuperate.”
Steve stares at him, but Tony’s jaw stays clenched on whatever else it was he might have had to say. Steve feels something clench inside of him.
“I dunno, maybe.” Tony pauses, then adds, “Don’t test this theory, okay? Especially not the moon part.”
When Tony is four years old, Howard Stark looks dead into the centre of a camera lens and he says, “Tony.”
“Is it safe,” Steve murmurs, “having him Hulk out in here? Not that I think he’ll hurt us,” he adds as Tony lifts his head and shoots him a scandalised look. “He saved your life, I know he won’t hurt us anymore. But he could damage the tower, couldn’t he?”
“Oh, hell,” the man says. “No, stop, I’m sorry. I’m not – I’m laughing with you, not at you, okay? This is the smallest I’ve ever seen you. We’ll laugh about this in the, uh - in the future.”
were here.”
“The light switch is next to your right elbow, sir,” JARVIS says.
As quickly as she came, she walks away to herd the last few stragglers through the side door.
“No,” he says again. “Nobody ever did that.”
Steve glances at Tony. Tony’s mouth is hanging open.
Lifting his pen up from the paper at last, he swipes his thumb over the wet patch of ink, smearing it. He wipes his thumb on his jeans and smirks up at Steve. Steve stares stonily back at him.
Tony taps his own earpiece and says, “Cap? Do you... copy? Are we on fire?”
“Why do you want this team so much, Tony?”
They stare at each other, frozen. Tony is still deciding whether to run back to bed or to shout for his mother, when through the door daddy says, “
Fury turns to her and she adds, with a small shrug, “I think Stark’s right. The Avengers are too public to work well with SHIELD now. Clint and I have been compromised.”
from? It’s – glowing, or something. How’d you find it? I’m gonna go out on a limb and assume you don’t just climb down mine shafts for kicks.”
“Sorry,” Steve says. He reaches up to fumble with the safety pins, but Ms Potts taps him on the knuckles and undoes it herself.
“No.”
“Please trust me,” Steve says.
“The reflexes on this guy,” Tony says, reaching over his desk to pat the Hulk on an arm twice as thick as Tony’s body. “He could be a whack-a-mole world champion.”
The cave is vast and cavernous and dim, and the one – thick, steel, reinforced – door stands in the rock face like it’s the very end of the universe. For all Steve knows, it could be.
Anyway, I just want to say, this is the longest thing I've ever written that wasn't a Nanowrimo. Somehow, when I started writing it in my head the night after watching the Avengers for the first time because I was too excited to sleep, it was just a glorified five times fic (times Steve stopped by the tower before he moved in) that I was expecting to be about 5,000 words long. LET US THROW BACK OUR HEADS AND LAUGH AT MY PAST FOOLISHNESS.
But Steve still pauses, on his way round to shotgun, to touch a hand reverently to the gleaming red roof before he gets inside, and he smiles again, smiles with such great affection.
“I’m up to the sixties,” he says, and Tony blinks, losing some of his guarded expression in the face of Steve’s non sequitur. “I’ve been catching up on everything I, uh... slept through. Politics, culture, technology. I spent a month in England. Visiting relatives and – graves. It’s slow going.”
He tugs the black duffle out from under the crumpled trunk of the car, shoving bills that spill out back inside, and holds it out to them.
Tony lowers his glass. He fixes Steve with an unreadable look and says, eventually, “Yeah, he always bought the good stuff. Good old dad. Why are you here?”
“I still can’t get a straight answer from this thing,” he says. Hitting a couple buttons on his brand new Stark computer, he transfers a folder of readings to Tony’s database.
Tony picks the gun up with his makeshift mittens and lifts it up close to his face. He squints at it from all angles, turning it over and over, running his fingers along every component and weighing it in his hands.
“I think that was the longest conversation I’ve ever had with people I wasn’t trying to sell something.”
Updates are probably going to slow down a bit now, I'm afraid. I wrote most of the first two chapters in one go before I started my new job, so now I have a job and I don't have a handy 5000 word backlog! But I'm still completely obsessed with this silly fic so there shouldn't be too much of a delay.
“You call this a meeting?” Tony says.
“Who are you? Last time you had clothes.”
“I’m not saying let’s just pass this thing over to SHIELD without – without
“If you’re saying Fury’s anything like you,” Steve says, “then I guess I’m sure enough.”
“-and you don’t want to be,” Natasha continues coolly, cutting Tony off. He snaps his mouth shut. “Neither of you do. But if Fury sent us - the Avengers after every little threat, that’s what you’d become. So we wait.”
“Well,” Steve says, “what are you working on right now?”
“Tony,” Pepper says again, her fingers clenching on his knee. “I think I...”
“Now, come on,” Bucky is saying. “You’ve left your date waiting long enough. Rumour has it Stark Industries have got a flying
“Do you know what he wanted yet? Was he coming for you, or one of the others? The whole team?”
“Mom says practically anyone can run fast, but not everyone can
“I’ve reached 1980.”
Thor shakes his head, looking amused rather than offended by Tony’s patronising tone. Then, through the window of the microwave, the popcorn starts to rattle and generally live up to its name and Thor leaps forwards with a shout, yanks the door off and sticks his hand inside. The edge of the microwave door hits the countertop with a thud, dangling from Thor’s grip, the hinges ripped clean away from the oven.
“Hey,” Steve says.
Steve holds out his arm. Tony sits down on the edge of his desk and sets about measuring it: shoulder to wrist, and then breaking down into smaller units. Shoulder to elbow. Elbow to wrist. Circumferences.
“We weren’t interested in giving ourselves new powers,” Tony says quickly. “Or in giving anyone new powers. Reed, and Hank Pym and I, we were just interested. We thought – you know, every time a new super villain pops up, he always manages to steal someone’s power somehow. What if we could just give it back to them? Or if we could break down the genetic code of someone’s abilitier, we could use it to design custom weaponry that truly works
“Nah.” Tony shakes his head. “Only my favourites.”
“Nothing important.”
familiar voice.
“Traitor,” Tony calls after her. “I don’t say anything nice.”
“I have to take this,” she sighs. “There were some minor problems with the Shaw contract. Which we
Tony is walking down a corridor.
The man sucks in a breath and looks at his watch and says, “I’ll make it up to you in, uh, ten months, I think. And five seconds. And ninety years, wow, this never gets less confu-”
Oh, hell.
“You do have a Reed Richards, don’t you?” he asks, suddenly uneasy. “Other people? Other places?”
“No,” Steve says.
“Pity,” Tony says. He raises his refilled glass in a toast. “A is for alcohol.”
He shoves his way out of the conference room, the door swinging shut behind him not quite quick enough to keep Fury’s words from floating out after him.
“Go,” she says. “Sleep. It’s okay, Cap. We’ll still be here when the sun’s up.”
“Yes, other than
The doors slide shut on the image of Tony chatting to his robot, cradled upside down on the bar top, as he carefully unscrews one of its wiggling limbs. And then Steve’s just staring at a shiny, black wall.
Steve is basically commuting between DC and New York, collaborating with Sam and Bucky to help out in various VA centers, homeless shelters, food kitchens and children’s homes. Most of the time he has Peter with him, the boy clearly taking after his Dad and wanting everybody to be taken care of and being happy, especially other kids, giving out self-wrapped presents, smiles and kind words. Every time Steve sees his baby boy doing stuff like that he feels his eyes well up with tears and his heart swell with pride.
yet this year.
“You need to smile! And we need to finish for Christmas Eve! Papa’s here and the tree’s not finished and you haven’t started cooking! What are we supposed to eat?” He paused shortly, clearly thinking of something critical, but before Steve or Tony could say anything he continued, “Do we have enough to eat? Daddy!” He nearly screamed at Tony. The volume of his voice distracted the genius shortly from his obviously suffering husband. “Do we have enough food? Papa needs to eat a lot! Do we need to go grocery shopping?
Steve smiles. “Absolutely,” he says warmly as the decision settles in his mind. “Hey, what do you say to actually going out right now and buying one?”
Even now Tony couldn’t help the chuckle and was soon joined by his son. That had been a moment to remember. Birdbrain had wanted to make pancakes for the whole gang, but only managed to make a huge mess. At first Tony hadn’t found that very funny, it had been his kitchen after all and someone needed to clean up afterwards. But when Clint had gathered that all he would accomplish that day would be making a mess, he of course had to make a show of it.
He hangs up without waiting for a reply and although Steve feels the pang in his chest for a moment there, he can’t help but be fond of his husband. Until he remembers the cause of the hasty retreat.
Peter scowled. “Which one was your favorite?”
With the smile still playing around his lips Tony watched his boys, lost in the familiarity and the feeling of home and love, until Peter’s eyes widened yet again.
“The one that made me laugh the most was the one the two of you sent when I was only away for a week. I still don’t know what had you giggling like that, but I saw that neither of could stop, and all you managed to articulate was something about Uncle Clint and pancakes.”
“They all think you just need time…”
He poured over historical records from the eighties and nineties, read every surviving article about Howard Stark and his young prodigy Tony Stark. He came up with a plan, rehearsed what he would say, chose his strategy and thought it out carefully. By the time he stood before the glowing portal he felt confident and more alive than he’d felt in decades.
Steve was always constant. Steve was the constant to everything, he fed Tony, took him to the bathroom, helped him shower, dress, comb his hair. Steve was always in the room, sitting on the floor or on the foot of his bed. He rarely left except to prepare a meal or when it was time to go to sleep. Weeks went on like this, weeks of Tony listening to the gentle sound of Steve’s voice as he read book after book, after book. One day, as Steve took a break to flip a page Tony finally mustered the strength to ask the question that kept pounding in his head.
“I wasn’t ogling her! The last time I saw her she was dying of old age ok?”
“Stephen this is Sigrid’s biological dad, Thor, over there’s his brother Loki and here are some old friends of mine from New York, Natasha, Bruce and Steve.”
“I can’t believe you just jumped right into an untested multi-dimensional portal without knowing anything about it!” Tony scolded him one Sunday morning as they sat together in the small kitchen having breakfast.
Tony had an exemplary marriage, so why was this bothering him?
Tony nodded and watched as Steve retreated back to the kitchen. Three months and a week… that’s how long he’d just learned he’d been in the cabin for already. According to Steve, the blame for Tony’s disappearance had gone to the terrorist organization Hydra, then when Hydra claimed it wasn’t them, they’d passed the blame to another organization by the name of AIM. Finally the investigation had degraded into a game of terrorist hot potato that had the media reeling with speculation.
First it was the usual questions, how did Steve find him? How had he escaped the plane crash? What in the world happened?
“Just with remembering?”
It was bothering him now, this age thing. The grey in his temples, the change in his skin, the wrinkles around his eyes, they were all bothering Tony more and more. Steve was learning to deal with it, learning how to calm Tony’s insecurities and make him see this as a good thing.
Tony was not an idiot, he could hear the wind beating snow down on the roof. He knew there had to be a blizzard and if he tried to run he’d only die from exposure.
It was a beautiful sight, he’d forgotten how beautiful New York looked at night, especially from this view.
“Sure Steve.”
But she does turn five, and then inevitably six and by the time seven comes along, there’s more children coming in and out of his house than he ever thought possible.  Which really, when Tony thinks about it, it’s no great surprise, Siggy has a natural magnetic charisma, a mind that picks up difficult concepts with ease and a selfless, humble nature that endears her to even the most draconian of teachers. The overall package results in a little person who is so overall likable, that Tony soon finds himself being the most praised single father of an entire elementary school.
Tony stepped out of the curtain less tub shower and into the awaiting fluffy towel Steve help up for him, his eyes looking into Steve’s the whole time. Desire, Steve desired him that much was clear but he never acted upon that desire. His affections never went further than sweet kisses to his face and what could only be described as aggressive cuddling. Perhaps that too was a weakness Tony could exploit.
As the weather turns colder and the holiday season startles itself awake, they come up with the idea of holding a Christmas dinner. Steve can taste Tony’s excitement on his skin and wonders at the change that one year can make. Just a year ago they’d spent Christmas huddled in a cocoon of sanctuary as the uncertainty of Tony’s condition ate them alive. This year however, things could not be any more different.
“So, got any plans for the next couple of weeks?” Long, tender fingers run through Steve’s hair, front to back… front to back. It’s distracting enough that Steve can’t remember how he ended up here.
That was a fair point and he actually agreed but he couldn’t just go out and say ‘Cap?... Really?... Why?’ without it sounding insulting.
“But don’t they need you back there?”
Had Tony finally made it to one of those drug and alcohol fueled parties Steve had been trying to keep him away from? Probably.
“Agent Fury found him, I can’t tell you where but he said that by the look of it they hadn’t taken him out from there in a while.”
From his spot, Steve was becoming annoyed. They behaved as if he’d performed monstrous miracles and yet this had been nothing. He’d just let off a little steam and they were acting as if he was Thanos himself. He was High Commander Rogers for Christ’s sakes. He’d conquered territories, commanded troops of a million soldiers, had killed, murdered and ruled with an iron fist. He was the Great High Commander Rogers and yet these people were shocked because he barely flexed his muscles. Seeing the weak, pathetic bunch they all were, Steve was glad to have taken care of the red book himself.
He steps back and watches them enter his house, his refuge, his kingdom. He knows exactly who is coming in even though he refuses to take in their faces, he knows who closes the door of his home behind him.
“Ok, let’s try this, what breakfast foods don’t you like?”
“Want to cuddle tonight?” Stephen asks, gently, as if he were soothing a child.
“For what it’s worth, I won’t be going back there again. The bookie wasn’t happy I was able to beat his prize bull. Told me it was a good night for business but it wasn’t going to be repeated.”
Steve paints an intimidating sight standing like this; red faced, tight lipped… coiled. Finally the kid’s self preservation instincts make him back away until he’s far enough to dash down the building stairs like a man who’s seen a ghost.
“What did you do to my Steve?”
“Hi Tony”
Knowing their history, their dynamic, Steve wasn’t really surprised when he found Tony cursing Captain America to hell and back in his workshop two weeks later.
From this close, Steve can catch the sweet look in Tony’s eyes.
Tony didn’t demand explanations, didn’t ask Steve why he never left Tony alone in the same room with Cap or Bucky, didn’t even comment on the way Steve’s hands kept reaching out for his husband whenever either of the two was near.
“Nothing… He’s like a lost cat looking for the perfect home. I know he’ll text from time to time, but once he’s back in his scene, it’ll be easier for him to move on to the next candidate in his endless search for the ‘ideal’ family.”
It was a low blow but a smart one, Cap knew it was the only way he’d throw him off guard.
“It’s just such a relief to be working for someone who isn’t sexually harassing you. You know?” She told Steve on her second day.
Steve was looking worried again. He was searching Tony’s eyes and seeing all the hesitance and chaos of Tony’s thoughts.
He started out slowly, making simple changes at home that Tony was comfortable with. Since they really only slept in Steve’s room, Tony’s old bedroom was turned into a full workshop so Tony could have a designated work space. Then he instituted an official dinner time, if Tony was going to be late he had to call Steve to let him know. They also had date nights and organized weekends where they travelled to different states. Tony took to the order like a fish took to the ocean. With Rhodey gone most of the ‘friends’ he’d hung out with had scattered into the wind. Suddenly no one had time to hang out with Tony anymore and it was evident what a blow that was to the young man’s self-esteem. So while at school Tony was hardly a popular guy (he had a reputation for being a stuck-up prick) at home he was welcomed into Steve’s loving arms without reservation.
“Is it ok for Sigrid to be here for all this?” Asks Bruce warily.
“Good morning Sharon. Thanks, I’ll look them over.”
The change is instantaneous, like gravity guiding an apple into the ground. One moment Tony is tense and grave and the next he is not. He looks at Steve in wonderment… in awe, and allows himself to smile sheepishly at his lover. He rushes closer to Steve’s large frame and allows himself to get lost in the infinite warmth of his love.
‘What would you do Tony?’ He’d often wondered.
“Sweetheart, what would you like for dessert? Chocolate cake or carrot cake?”
Thankfully for him, there was Pepper.
Thus the sleeping children are all transferred to the guest bedroom to sleep off their sugar-filled day while the adults clean up the living room and kitchen. Three pairs of experienced hands make quick work of the task however, and soon Stephen is finally opening up a nice bottle of wine at two-thirty in the morning.
“Yes! But…” Tony could tell he was hitting a dead end. “Ok…ok Steve, I need you to tell me the truth, the whole truth and nothing but truth ok?”
‘Cause I’m a nobody, a good for nothing High School dropout who Tony wouldn’t spare a glance at anymore. Twenty years ago I had a chance. We were both young, Tony had no prospects but now? He’s as high up in the sky and as out of reach as this fucking ad.’
“I still think we should try to contact Thor.”
In Steve’s desperation and anguish he surely must have placed memorials to the fallen heroes and since Tony must have surely been among them, he probably put up more memorials in his honour. Facing the collapse of human civilization as they knew it, the newer generations must have taken up the fallen heroes as deities, thus creating the cult-like following which Eliza obviously belonged to.
“Tony and I have been together for twenty-six years Captain. There is no truth of mine he doesn’t already know.”
“From Me” He whispered into Tony’s dark hair. Tony heard him anyway, wrapped his strong arms around Steve’s waist.
“Look, I promise that for the thirteenth we can do something really low key, I’ll be old by then anyway so I’ll probably want to get to bed on time.”
The guy, Vic, had been fighting to win, but Steve… he’d been fighting life itself. Every kick, punch and hit was not for Vic, no, it was retaliation for every shitty thing that’d happened to him since birth. Tonight, Steve’s finally gotten a little of his pride back.
He smiled gently, thought back to Anthony presenting him with a pink-sundress-wearing-toddler as if he was handing the High Commander the most precious of metals.
“Did you drink any alcohol?”
Natasha’s features betrayed nothing and his worry was temporarily set aside when the dark haired girl hurried toward him.
“We’re running out of time sweetheart.”
Not even bothering to wait for permission, Tony soon had the girl out of the carrier. She didn’t complain, settling in Tony’s arms as naturally as she settled into her own parents’.
The words had Tony melting into himself, his mouth relaxed, his body leaned toward Steve.
Staff rushed to their feet as they saw him pass. Some kept their gazes lowered in respect while others broke protocol to steal shy, excited glances. No one here was over 35 years old so no one here thought the commander less than a living deity. The High Commander could feel the awe and respect in their stance, in their gaze, and in the presence of such support he allowed himself to coax his lips into a soft, welcoming smile of sorts.
“Well hopefully no innocents were damaged in the process.” He replies and Siggy beams up at him.
“You look happy.” Comments Steve after managing to down over half his beer in one gulp.
“Ah! Here’s my husband, Steve meet, Captain Rogers.”
It’s not until that very instant that Steve remembers the black eye. He’s honestly had so many over the years that his own reflection didn’t register it as a concern. He must succeed in looking sheepish because with a sigh, the fight leaves Tony.
“Never a dull moment around here” Tony tells them trying to ignore the deep awkward silence that is quickly setting in. “So Thor, how did you find out about Sigrid?”
They grinned at each other like idiots before bursting into bellyful laughter, but they clung desperately to each other, their hands never far from skin.
“Drying my tears sweetheart?”
It’d taken him over fifty years to get all the necessary components. Decades of dealing with galaxy scavengers for knowledge tomes, years of hunting down infinity stone dust and Arc Reactors and Wakandan minerals. Trillions of dollars spent collecting all the necessary components and culminating in this exact moment. He wished Peter was still alive to see this. Peter Parker who had worked so tirelessly to make this a reality in his lifetime, only to die so suddenly from cancer that he couldn’t see it completed.
Tony shrugs.
“Hi!...  Yeah, no. Come in, we’re definitely not doing this in literally, hell.”
“I might have taken peek at a few confidential files Aunt Peggy left my dad one day”
“But Grant, ya can’t leave! Ya’re one of my best janitors, no one else can handle the Robotics floor! Those fuckers are crazy.”
With one hand on Tony’s head and his right arm across Tony’s back, Steve had enough leverage to press the young man against him as he coaxed Tony’s mouth open with his lips. He kept Tony securely in place while he plundered the warm, willing mouth that could do little but open wide and try to reciprocate with his tongue. It was a filthy kiss, one that felt like sex with the way Steve nipped and suckled and drew Tony in so deep all Tony could do was remember how to breathe. Then Tony was hard again and he gave into it, rocking forward into Steve’s belly with the towel between them. The friction was delicious and Steve let Tony rock into him while continuing his assault on Tony’s mouth. The rocking only lasted a few more seconds before Tony was spilling himself onto the towel. The short-enduring libido charmed Steve, for it spoke of inexperience which went against all the rumours he’d heard about Tony’s youth.
“Is this ok, or do I need to change?”
“And what are you doing here?”
Beside Steve, Tony didn’t stir. The rhythmic fall and rise of his chest was the only indication that he was alive and well. Before leaving New York, Steve had placed a travel pillow around Tony’s neck and wrapped a blanket around his legs, making him look so natural it was heartbreakingly adorable. He was glad for it when they were pulled over by a patrol car in the outskirts of New Hampshire.
There had been no Thor last year.
“By ‘all’ I think you mean yourself, because Steve took all the kids in the divorce.”
“Tell me Vision, do you miss him?”
“I will see it later. Debrief me on the situation.”
Steve hummed gently while he ran playful fingers over Tony’s face, over his cheeks, forehead, temples and hair. He hummed the chorus of his favorite song, vocalizing the energy of ‘Everything’s Coming Up Roses’ with such gusto that Tony’s eyes were full of mirth. He thought back to the first time he’d heard it. Where had he heard it? It’d been after Thanos…probably when they threw him in that ridiculous institution. The song had given him hope, it’d given him the push he needed to put his plans into action and be the driving force in everything that came after that. Eventually, everything had indeed come up roses for him and proof of that was lying right there, in front of him.
“Peggy trust me, you don’t want to know. Just understand this… I know everything there is to know about SHIELD. I know all about what you did with Arnim Zola and every other dirty little secret SHIELD has. I have no interest at all in interfering with any of it but I expect the same courtesy to be extended to me.”
The drive down to Tennessee does not feel like a hassle, even though he’s stopping regularly to check on the baby and is driving within the speed limit normally reserved for the elderly, he’s actually enjoying the trip. He doesn’t have to think about Steve here, doesn’t have to answer Helen Foster’s phone calls about signing more paperwork or think about what he should do with Jane’s ashes which Helen refuses to take. Here, it’s just Siggy and him in the car, listening to a 90’s music radio station as they head to their new life. Moving to Knoxville had not been Tony’s top choice, in fact, he waited until the last possible moment to accept the offer. He ultimately gave in because the company CEO assured him that he could work from home most days. He hopes the new house looks just like the pictures his realtor emailed, he knows he’s going to have to look around for new furniture in the coming days, he barely brought anything down with him. He opted against bringing anything that reminds him of Steve, and since the whole goddamn apartment reminded him of Steve, he left almost everything behind.
“They’re going there anyway, no need for us to make a special trip just for samples babe. Plus, Brucie is already working on something that’s time sensitive, I don’t want to bother him with that.”
“And how did you find out about her Loki?” As far as Tony knows Loki hadn’t even been in the States while Jane was pregnant. Jane told Thor’s parents, in fact that’s where she got the signed contract that specified they wouldn’t pursue any contact with Jane or her baby, but she’d never told Loki.
“Then he’s caught in an endless pursuit of happiness. He may be more in love with the dream than with achieving it. It happens… still hurts though, doesn’t it.”
“Well kinda but Daddy already tells me anything I want to know about them. It’s the stuff that’s just about HIM that he doesn’t talk about.”
Finally they reached the motel, a worn down, seedy looking place, two stories with a few staircases that smelled like piss. He’d rented a room at floor level ahead of time, it had iron bars in the windows and an extra lock on the door. It was the kind of place whose main clientele probably consisted of druggies and hookers but thankfully also meant they were the least interested in calling the police if they saw anything fishy. Steve got out of the car and opened the passenger door, catching Tony’s unconscious body as it fell against him. Steve lifted Tony onto his arms, closed the doors, locked the car and walked the few steps to their room.
“Hey, I love that episode!”
The hours pass slowly. He drinks for most of it but paces himself well… he’s no rookie after all. He’s been street fighting since he was fifteen. The training for it is what kick-started his growth spurt, what got his muscles to fill out… what kept food on the table when his Ma got sick.
He’d forgotten, forgotten what it felt like to have people trust him explicitly, unquestioningly. All he did was fulfill their expectations and suddenly the gates of both the Stark and SHIELD kingdoms were open to him by their keepers.
It wasn’t the words themselves, but how Tony said them that struck Steve speechless. It was, he thought, like looking into God’s eyes and knowing he knew everything you’ve ever done, everything you were and still loved you for it. He’d stopped believing in God after Tony died, now he wondered if that maybe was because Tony was his God.
Here, in pictures was another life Steve’s little project had changed. Jarvis had gone in peace after all, unconcerned for Tony’s future since he knew Steve would always be there to look after the boy Jarvis raised.
“Sure Tony”
Edwin Jarvis, a tall, slender man in a suit was carrying a tea tray into the dining room. How utterly ridiculous, pondered Steve, that this man who’d been so integral to Tony’s upbringing would be bringing in the tea. Steve stood before the only man he’d ever been sorry not to have met and stretched out his hand.
“Yep! But he wouldn’t be on the guest list anyway.”
Not at all, thought Tony. “Not really”
He texts Tony throughout the day. Small messages… some just for support. Tony sends them back with gusto, heart emojis and tired emojis and a few peaches with a crying face that stir a slight burn of guilt in Steve. Very few things in life ignite real emotion in him, but Tony is one of them.
“You have to pop by SHIELD sometime soon Steve. There’s so many missions we could use a hand with!”
Jaw locked tight, fists clenching and unclenching Steve marveled at the human stupidity that must have delivered the Winter Soldier in cryostatis right into the hands of SHIELD. He hadn’t decided yet on what to do with Bucky Barnes, had debated the usefulness of letting the assassin kill off Howard before capturing him himself. This certainly changed his plans and he was sure the change in the timeline was due to the Hydra base he’d destroyed a year ago.
“There is no more Hydra Captain.”
For the first time since the creation of this dimension, Steve could see the hands of something other than himself shaping what was to come, and he felt powerless before it. Stark Solutions had created a water purifying system that was both extremely easy to use and easy to transport. He pitched it to the US military as a low cost, easy to use solution to an ongoing water purification problem. The military accepted, but they wanted Tony and Tony alone to do a live demo to the big shot Generals in Afghanistan to make sure the purifier worked under those conditions. Tony accepted. Steve hit the ceiling.
“I wish things could’ve different Tony but I knew they’d never let me within five metres of you now. Not after everything I put you through.”
Laughter, Tony’s eyes were laughing at him now. ‘Of course I know that you silly man.’ They seemed to say. Steve smiled right back.
“Nah, he hasn’t earned it yet. Maybe in a few years… maybe.” Half of her reply is muffled by his t-shirt and he realizes right then and there how exhausted they both are. He rubs her back soothingly, enjoying their moment of quiet before they head back inside.
“Hi Tony”
Smiling, the Commander complied with the request. In one graceful move he removed his shirt, exposing a truly exquisite collection of muscles to the human eye.
“Why did Councilwoman Rhodes send you here then?”
It isn’t muffled this time because she’s looking up at him with her big blue eyes.
To emphasize his point, Steve parts his lips and sucks in tender skin from Tony’s shoulder… adding two purple marks to the collection already painted on his skin.
“How may I be of service High Commander?”
As more guests arrive and drinks start flowing, Bucky and Steve find themselves with just each other for company on the couch. The professionally placed Christmas lights give off a lovely gleam that feels nostalgic, even if neither of them ever had anything like this when they were kids.
“Naw, I already warned them I’ll be offline most of the week. They know how to escalate things if needed.”
Tony’s words had always unmade Steve. From the very beginning his words had always taught him new things, had made him laugh and tease and get mad. This time they snapped him out of his desperate state.
“Not what I meant, I mean I’m getting older. I’m marching right into death, so to speak and you’re still as perfect as the day I met you.”
“So it shall be Commander.” She whispered.
“I know that right now probably nothing makes sense. But I just need you to understand something… Tony, I’m not going to hurt you. Everything is ok and everything will be ok.”
“No thank you Lieutenant. You may proceed, we have approximately ten minutes.”
“Well there we go baby, I didn’t know that about you.”
Tony looked at the surroundings, (as much as the darkness allowed) it was a large room with exposed wooden beams and log walls. It was simply decorated, rather minimalistic with just a large chest of drawers to one side. But there was no phone in sight, not even a computer or a TV.
“Tony?”
The arms around him tensed before dislodging so their owner could face Steve.
These days he preferred keeping his distance, liked his solitude and enjoyed being left alone with his memories. The High Commander could only really tolerate the presence of Alaska Rhodes, a curly haired, freckled twenty-eight year old who called him ‘Uncle Steve’ regardless of how imposing he looked. Alaska was the granddaughter of Virginia Potts and James Rhodes, who despite being a rather unlikely couple, appeared to have somehow found comfort in each other after Tony's death. High Commander Rogers remembered holding their son Anthony when he was born. Remembered feeling torn between being happy at this new life and betrayed on Tony’s behalf for the offspring his best friend and fiancé had produced together.
“It was you? You kidnapped me?... Why?”
With the Winter Soldier safely away hibernating, Steve was left to contemplate for the first time a future where Howard Stark was alive.
The Avengers without mutiny, aliens, killer robots or magic felt almost like a police force, except more prestigious. They were usually deployed on peace keeping missions or to protect refugees or civilians. As such by mid-2016 Steve was trying to convince Tony that they should place themselves on the Avengers relief roster.
He smiled his charming media smile and patted Steve on the shoulder in a friendly, no-hard-feelings manner. Was Howard Stark afraid of angering him? Or was it just the years of idolatry which made him give in to whatever the great Steve Rogers said? Howard had just offered up his son in a golden platter as a sort of placating gesture and Steve could hardly believe it.
If Tony was feeling tired, they spent the evening cuddling on the couch. If Tony was cranky, Steve spent the day trying to get him to laugh, if he was depressed, or horny or anxious Steve committed himself to trying to make Tony feel better by any means necessary.
“Really Steve? That’s all you’ve got to say? How about it’s a miracle of human engineering?, or it’s the world’s best view even?”
Looking away from his desktop for a moment, Steve focused on Tony hunched over the keyboard of his own desktop at home. The young genius was coding what would come to become JARVIS. He’d been working on it for years now, on and off. It was taking longer than the original JARVIS because of SI. The first time around Obadiah had taken care of all the menial matters of running a company, now Tony took care of that personally which left him with limited time to work on JARVIS. This was why Steve’s New Year’s resolution had been to implement the right people on the right jobs, to get Tony focused on inventing and innovating.
“Because I don’t want this dimension to go through the same things my dimension went through.”
They landed in front of the Hudson River and Steve recognized the area immediately. It was here where he’d first arrived nearly thirty years ago, the area had changed drastically but he knew the spot anyway.
Steve kept Tony close to his side the entire walk to what Tony now realized was his own private bathroom. Once there, Steve opened the door and stood guard by the doorframe as usual while Tony used the facilities. Finally Tony understood why the bathroom was so bare, why the only thing in there was a safety razor, his toothbrush, toothpaste and soaps. Steve’s personal bathroom which was probably full of sharp, potentially hazardous things was kept away from Tony’s interested hands. Today Tony went through the daily bathroom ritual without complaint. He stripped and showered without being told to and didn’t scream for Steve to go away, he was being good, establishing trust and all that crap. For his part Steve seemed pleased, as if finally seeing Tony play by his rules brought him unspeakable joy.
“We’ve been trying to convince him to give surrogacy a try.” Adds Bruce.
And it really was.
“She is.”
“Please don’t scare me like that again ok? Seeing you walk through the door all bloodied and hurt was pretty awful.”
Tony is happy again.
“Yes we do, they were very engaged in the West-Coast resistance about thirty years back until they were killed during the Battle of San Francisco. Her brother died with their parents, she survived.”
The numbers struck Steve Rogers enough to overtake the anger.
“It might just make it” Steve whispered, smiling.
In the months to come Tony would look back and be thankful of everyone he managed to see that day. He’d remember that he got to talk to Pepper for a bit and had made her smile at something funny he said. He’d remember that he kissed Natasha on the cheek for no reason whatsoever before leaving their office. He’d remember patting Peter on the shoulder and telling him “Good job buddy” before leaving the lab and he’d remember texting Rhodey to check how army life was going and getting a reply that read “Everything’s fine, don’t worry about me. Remember to shower.” Tony would remind himself that he didn’t go see Thor or Bruce or Sam or Clint because he’d seen them already the weekend prior when they all got together to have a noisy games night. He’d remember the way Thor squeezed him to his side after his eighth beer, and how Bruce pulled him aside to tell him how happy he was that Tony decided to take a year off. He’d remember Sam’s steady hand on his arm, calming, understanding, comforting as if even after all these years only he understood how damaged Tony really was. He’d also be sorry he never really got to make up with Clint, they’d put their argument to rest that weekend but Tony would’ve liked to have another conversation with him, to assure Clint that Tony really was ok with him leaving his job at SI to buy a farm and move there with his wife and three kids. But regrets would come later, not on day zero.
“Do you think? I mean, there’s no way to be sure, but... do you think maybe this is all Howard’s fault?”
“It’s just tea, I swear. You need to drink plenty of liquids so your body flushes out the last of yesterday’s meds. You won’t go into withdrawal because I’ve been weaning you off little by little but you still need to drink.”
“Fucking Avenger serial killer asshole’s had me running circles all over New York for shit.”
In fact… if he really thought about it, Steve rarely fought him over anything. He was always quick to offer a compromise and when that wasn’t possible, he’d turn himself backwards to avoid fighting with Tony. There was a deep-rooted fear in Steve that involved them fighting, but why would ‘High Commander Rogers,’ once leader of a freaking government be afraid of arguing with his own husband?
He keeps on talking, walking away as Steve carefully unties his boots – shoes are expensive; even with his new SHIELD fund, he can’t kick the little voice that tells him
Steve examines them all closely, for a little while, and then he hefts his bundle of clothes higher and pulls his towel tighter. He walks past a row of firmly shut doors to the laundry chute JARVIS had indicated, but the door at the end of the row is slightly ajar. No lights are on inside the room, but the far wall is all windows, and as Steve passes he catches a glimpse of a bare bed, bare walls, a closet door half-open with a few shirts poking out. Hesitating, he reaches out a hand and gives the door a gentle push. It swings open easily. The bed looks as if it’s been reinforced with steel.
Tony shrugs. “I’m not seeing the problem.”
Despite the noise growing next door, everyone is quiet. Only Thor, in his shiniest armour with a ceremonial helmet tucked under his arm, looks excited; it’ll be another Midgardian experience to write home to his parents about, Tony figures. Bruce is fidgeting nervously in the corner while Romanoff, wearing something that looks like it came from Natalie Rushman’s wardrobe, murmurs reassurances. Even Barton looks on edge. Only Steve is an oasis of calm, carefully combing his hair, with his jaw set as if he’s preparing for battle. He’s wearing a shirt that looks brand new, white and crisp and too cheap for Tony’s tastes; it stretches too tightly across his shoulders, pulling taut with every movement of his arms. Tony reminds himself to give him the number for Tony’s tailor and he lifts his cell to take a picture for Rhodey.
Tony rubs his thumb along the rim of the arc reactor. He remembers, vaguely, Obie’s hand reaching down. He hears Yinsen let out a soft breath.
He sits down next to Tony, crossing his ankles and folding his arms, and Tony rocks his head back against the wall to look across at him, mouth quirking up at the edges. He doesn’t move his hand.
It’s familiar down here as well, from the times he’s gone down to collect his motorbike. Steve steps out of the elevator into the vast, grey parking lot and the rows of expensive cars, but he’s never seen the workshop. There is the row of other elevators, and at the end of the parking lot there’s the tunnel that leads back up to street level, the rumble of overhead traffic echoing down through it; the only other door is huge and metal, big enough to drive a truck through, set into the wall halfway between the elevators and the exit tunnel.
“Decent.”
He laughs. He pats Tony on the shoulder. “You’re a brat. You
in those things?”
“Hey!” someone shouts from behind them.
Whatever else he’s planning on saying, Steve slots the ear defenders over his ears and the world goes silent. Tony follows suit and then carefully picks up the gun, keeping his fingers clear of trigger, and he moves away from the desks to stand in the middle of the workshop floor. Steve moves with him, until Tony lifts his free hand and pushes against Steve’s chest, the meaning clear: keep back.
Steve’s lips twitch. He hesitates, and then sticks his foot between the elevator doors to keep them from closing. Folding his arms, he leans against the edge of the door and he says, slowly, “I think this is a good idea. I don’t think we’re crazy.”
, cradling the Iron Man helmet in his hands and heaving with the violence of his tears, and he’s whispering in a voice so tiny Steve has to lean in close to hear it, over and over again –
for cheering me on each and every time I rewrote that bloody scene.
the eccentric billionaire with a British butler computer, you think of something.”
“Hummus,” she says. “Please don’t put your fingers in it.”
“Don’t you wanna find out?”
, but I’m afraid I just don’t have the time.”
Tony trails off. He can feel Steve’s breath, even warmer, on the back of his neck. He can feel the fingers of Steve’s other hand trailing down between his shoulder blades.
“Is anyone hurt?” Steve asks, gently, looking around at them all.
“We have a winner. 90% of the answers to those questions are ‘big, scary, faceless organisation with an invisible flying machine and a leather fetish.’ That will go down
“I’ll give you something to cry about,” Clint says, reaching into his quiver.
“I’m sorry,” Tony murmurs. He’s still smiling a little when Steve looks up at him, a rueful twist to his lips. “I think you might have ended up in the one universe worse than your own.”
“Here,” Steve says softly, dropping into the seat behind him. He scoops a handful of ice out of his drink and into the napkins. “For your hand.”
Steve rolls up his sleeve while Tony searches in his desk, coming up with a plastic-wrapped scalpel and a test tube.
“Not a whole lot. When I’m me, I’m just a scientist, and when I’m not me, I’m... ebullient, so reconnaissance isn’t either of our strong points.” Bruce huffs out a breath, scratching the back of his neck. He’s had to roll up the sleeves of Steve’s sweatshirt to fit. “What I’ve got, is back in the tower. I didn’t think it’d be wise to try sending it to you.”
Tony stands, stretches, rubs an aching joint or two. Rounding the coffee table, he reaches out a hand to Steve without really thinking about it. Steve has already grabbed hold and pulled himself smoothly up onto his feet before Tony remembers that Steve is a supersoldier, that Steve holds himself like a gymnast vacationing in a brick shithouse. Steve could probably stand up gracefully with both ankles tied behind his head.
“Chacabuco is most likely, I think,” Bruce is saying.
“Never mind,” Steve says quickly, holding up a hand. He lowers it and extends it and waits patiently with hand outstretched until Tony, with a put-upon sigh, shakes it. “Tell me next time.”
,” says Tony. “What, don’t give me that look, she’s been gone four hours. Pepper’s been gone four
The repulsor blast cuts through the trees and into the soldier. He flies through the air, slamming into a tree trunk and sliding downwards as the blast cuts out. Steam rises from him as he crumples onto the ground.
“I’ll bet,” Steve says again. He looks down at the mess of half-eaten ice cream at his feet, kicks the cone to the side, then looks up at Tony again. “You’re pretty hard to please, yourself, you know.”
“I’m just trying to... I thought I’d try something new, but there’s such a lot. Do you have a favourite?”
“Oh,” he breathes.
Finally, “You haven’t missed two years,” Stark says, softly. He sinks back down into his chair and pulls it closer to the bedside, close enough that he can reach out and touch Steve’s arm and Steve – Steve can see Stark’s face clearly now, every sharp line of it. It isn’t Stark’s face. It isn’t Steve’s Stark.
Clint snorts with laughter. “Yeah, Stark, thought you were a genius.”
And then suddenly it’s gone. Steve whips around in time to see the pencil roll across the floor, the paper fluttering down to fill the space where Tony had been.
“Seems like a pretty good reason to me.”
He frowns up at the frozen image. On screen, Tony’s mouth is open, his hands caught very, very slowly lowering the gun. He slashes a finger around the portal’s impact zone and drags that section forwards, enlarging it.
“Okay, that’s all. You’re free to go, soldier.”
“Not a lot,” she admits after a moment’s silence. “But I know he has plans. I know he’ll call us when he needs us. I know we all deserve a break after saving the world.”
Steve clears his throat.
He’s not one to brag, but his weapon of choice
“We’re reaching an understanding,” Bruce says. He smiles lopsidedly, if a shade sarcastically. “I’m letting him stretch his legs, he’s getting less angry. It’s as close to win-win as I’m ever going to get.”
“You won’t be telling me anything anymore.”
“Well, at least everyone’s staying clear of the Hulk,” he says into Steve’s ear piece. “That’s what I love about New York, the self-preservation instinct. Except for us, I guess.”
“Okay, children,” Tony says. “Fess up, who kicked me?”
it, use the camera, okay? Try not to fall over,” he adds, as one of the robots trundles past them to the other end of the workshop. “You, stay where are you, film from here-”
“Yeah, and the Pope’s a little religious.”
Natasha turns to look at Steve as he enters the room, and she smiles, satisfied.
“Uh.” Steve glances down at himself. He’s only wearing a simple button down, but he likes it. “Tony only said to bring my shield.”
“He’s out on the balcony,” Barton says, still sniggering. He jabs a thumb back over his shoulder toward the balcony door, and crosses his ankles on the coffee table with a contented sigh.
“Yep,” Steve says. “Yeah, I remember the tiger.”
Reaching his array of desks, Tony dumps the gun on top of one and tugs a drawer open. He pulls out goggles, ear defenders, thick leather gloves. He’s practically humming with excitement, the sight of it making Steve’s own hands tingle, Steve’s own heart rate pick up.
At some point in the night, probably while she’s fastening towels with safety pins with one hand and balancing some kind of fruity cocktail in her sling, Steve finds himself thinking of Agent Romanoff just as Natasha. He’s drinking mojitos and he’s only wearing his underpants under what’s essentially a very fluffy dress and he’s squeezed on a couch between two women who definitely aren’t his girls. If it’s not the most comfortable Steve’s ever been, it still beats the hell out of plenty of things. The Red Skull. Losing everyone he’s ever known. Asthma. Every single second of The Star-Spangled Man With A Plan.
