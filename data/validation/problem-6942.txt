“They’re idiots! We were the least subtle we’ve ever been the last few weeks. Rhodey has been whining to me that if we didn’t pull it back a little he is going to poke his eyes out.”
“I need you to wingman me. Right now!” Peter grabs Luke’s elbow and tries to drag him out of his chair.
“You have a real talent Peter. I’ll be sure to keep my eyes out for you.” T’challa says. “I better get going but I’m sure I’ll see you around during my visit for the next couple days.”
“You and all you represent is everything that is going wrong with this company. Don’t expect to make it any further than this internship, Parker. Not even Stark’s shine for you is going to help you once I turn in the report I have written on your behaviour here this month.”
Steve seems to be going to make some other smart comment back. Bucky’s right, the guy can’t seem to help himself. Peter feels obligated to save the poor man from offending the boss any further today. Luckily Jess steps in before Peter has to.
“Really? How terrible.” Steve replies, his voice as dry as dust, making it clear he’s not taking anything his friend’s say seriously.
Peter nods. That did sound more like Steve. If the relationship is only just starting though it probably isn’t serious enough yet for it to cause any issues. Unless….
“The decision has been made, Wilson. You have a problem then set a meeting up with Pepper and me privately to air it out.” He states. “Be off my minions and do my bidding!!” Reading the room and abruptly bringing the meeting to a close.
“I’m more scared of her than I am of you” Peter says simply, wiggling his empty glass in Luke’s face.
T’challa nods at Steve in reply “Yes. It’s exactly what we asked for. It’ll go perfectly with the rest of the images we have collected for Tony’s gift.”
“I know!! I could have kicked myself for not seeing it sooner. Can’t you just imagine them all stupid happy, with their perfect job and perfect babies and being all accomplished and stuff. Making the rest of us feel bad and unsuccessful while we watch on.” Peter cries dramatically, using his hands to emphasis the importance of his discovery.
As they all wait for the ambulance to arrive Tony continues to cradle Steve tight against his chest and touches Steve incessantly. Rubs circles into Steve’s back, holds one of Steve’s hand and every now and then gives it a little squeeze, strokes and plays with the hair that falls over the top of Steve’s forehead. The longer Peter watches the more he wants to freak out, sharing the boss’s worries that the blonde is more injured than Happy first suggested.
Happy and the rest of the security pick up Fisk after Jess gives the douche one final glare. They drag him outside to wait for the police while the rest of the guests hover around, wanting to make sure Steve is okay but not wanting to get in the way.
Tony observes the painting with a scowl. Not shaken in the slightest by the shot that was aimed just beside his head.
Bucky looks like he is about to go after Logan and deny everything but he stops when Steve walks through the door. There’s a moment of hesitation as everyone just stare at one another. Steve gives them all a weird look as he pulls out a blue mug for his daily earl grey, choosing not to comment.
“It was a really nice thing of Mr Stark to do” Peter says loudly “He doesn’t have to go so out of his way for me. This internship alone is already an experience of a lifetime.”
“Fuck no. Steve is terrible at flirting and think he isn’t as great a catch as he actually is. Since he refuses to let his best wingman help him out, a sneak attack is the only option.”
“Ughhh you suck! And she probably would. I mean look at you.” Peter whines. He chucks the smart arse in front of him a glare. “No I just mean- Well hypothetically you know.”
“It doesn’t help that you work so much overtime Steve.” Peter continues “And that Fisk is barely ever around. That feeds the rumours more than anything. Everyone likes you and they worry that you are being taken advantage of. We all know you constantly are pulling up Fisk’s slack”
Confidence returning again Peter accepts the suggestions, forming a new step by step plan he will implement when they are back on Monday. An idea snags in his head when he rereads step 7. giving it one last look, Peter hurries back over to Pepper and Steve.
Once out the door Pepper and Wilson Fisk fly past to enter Mr Stark’s office. Fisk looks like he’s about to run a marathon and Pepper seems close to punching the man beside her. Peter can tell Fisk is ready to tear into both Pepper and Mr Stark for sidelining his art exhibit article so Pete hightails it out of there, not wanting to get caught in the crossfires.
“Pick your jaw off the floor, Idiot. It’s only Steve.” Pepper asserts as they are walking away, focus still on her phone. Peter prays to god that the blonde didn’t hear the last of Pepper’s sentence.
Jumping up and taking advantage of the fact that nobody is around, Peter sets up one of his cameras so it would capture anything that happened at Steve’s desk for the rest of the day. There was no way Jones was going to get away with her tricks after this. At least that would be one good thing to come out of today.
"Clearly I think Peter needs more help than you do Luke” Steve says as he pops a peanut from the bowel in front of him into his mouth.
Peter finally turns to his two mentors and can barely contain himself as he meets their gaze, his heart melting with happiness. The couple are looking at him with such praise and approval in their eyes that he finds himself grinning from ear to ear as he stares back. He mouths a silently thank you to both of them, knowing they will get what he means.
“Now scram minion. Make sure you get Rogers the sesame seed bagel, he probably won’t admit it but they are his favourite.” Tony finishes
“I’ve been trying to get her to lose her cool for weeks thanks to Logan’s stupid bet.” Clint whispers loudly “76th thing to learn about working at this place Petey-boy. Never turn down a challenge. This place will know because word spreads like wildfire here! YoU’Ve BeEn WaRNed”
He racks his brain as the door of the elevator finally pings to indicate the arrival to Mr Stark’s level. Still deep in his thoughts as he walks down the hall, he almost barges straight into the boss’s office without knocking. Pulling up short though, he notices that the door is slightly ajar and that Mr Stark is in the middle of a discussion that sounds important.
“I don’t believe you have the guts to actually use that thing, Wilson. I’ve known you for a very long time, remember?” Tony dismisses.
“Ughh, why does everyone take such an interest in my love life? It’s not like I haven’t had sex before. Nothing monumental is happening anytime so-” Steve complains
“If we are making this month all about the advances T’challa’s company has made, then it might not be a bad idea to do a throwback to a previous expose we have done on Panther Corporation.” Mr Stark suggests.
Tony squirms and throws his hands up to protect himself, unable to run away thanks to the arm belonging to Steve Rogers wrapped tightly around the brunette’s waist.
“Fisk! It’s hard to miss you if you’ve never actually gone.” He says shortly, raising an eyebrow at the lunatic behind Peter’s back.
Peter hears Clint make a disappointed noise. He isn’t sure why until he looks over at Pepper and sees that she has barely looked up from her phone to check out Steve’s attire. Her face is deep into the files recently sent to her and when her eyes finally flick up, it’s only briefly.
Peter knows Bucky and Sam were just trying to make sure Peter has the opportunity to get Steve hooked up but he still can’t help but feel relieved. Peter certainly needs the help so he agrees immediately.
Steve’s body language has shut off and his face glowering at Mr Stark while the brunette is wringing at a napkin and refusing to look at the stern face opposite him. Peter can see now that the conversation in the cafe today was mild in comparison to the two men actually bumping heads.
“Really? Because I was told Jones, that you only insisted on using the nickname Webhead in school to disguise the giant sappy crush you had on me.”
“Ha ha. I guess now that we no longer are disagreeing on how to handle Fisk, things have calmed down between the two of us.”
“I’m not the only thing at the party making *things* hard.” The boss says under his breathe, eyes bright while sipping at his soda.
“If you say so” Bucky says with a grin as he takes Peter’s hand to give it a shake. “It’s your funeral”
“Alright, how did you go? What’s the decision with the centre spread on Vanessa? “Fisk says in an authoritative tone. “I’ve already told her to put her full trust in us.”
Mr Stark is giving Steve this weirdly fond smile which clearly weirds Steve out because the blonde shoves his hands on top of the boss’s head and messes up his hair. This causes Mr Stark to let out a delighted laugh and shove weakly at the blonde as if to start some sort of play fight.
The intern has never seen the boss smile like that before before. Thinking about it, Peter realises it’s his first time seeing the Tony grin with no cynicism at the edges of his eyes. Happiness is a good look on the man, Peter notes absently.
Steve runs a hand through his hair. “Peter, as much as I appreciate you looking out for me, I don’t want a promotion. I’ve turned them down the couple times I’ve been asked. I am perfectly happy with my position at Marvels. You need to stop getting so heavily involved in the office drama or at least use those journalist instincts and gather all the facts first.”
So now Peter finds himself sitting with Luke and Jones watching the senior’s of the company go to town, ribbing at their coworker and boss.
Like, the man that had hired him was about to sit and chat like he was a regular co-worker. Well, to be honest Pepper had probably been the one to hire him but officially on his contract it said it was Mr Stark.
“Peter, all I’ve witnessed is a guy trying to help brighten the workplace up from the cloud Fisk has been causing over this magazine for the last couple of years. Yeah, maybe every scheme of yours hasn’t gone right but all your intentions have been good. You have the heart of a king, my friend.”
“Sounds like he just needs to get laid” Logan astutes with a grunt. Sam shoots him a bit of a startled look as he scrunches his nose but Bucky nods in agreement.
“Uhhh but weren’t you... didn’t you... Peter! We all thought you were aware of that...?” Clint says slowly.
Peter chuckles under his breath a little. Steve always tends to make sure everyone is being treated with a high level of respect so it's not surprising that not even the big boss isn’t above these subtle reminders. It is fairly amusing though.
“There are plenty of rumours about how there’s going to be a big shakeup in the next few weeks though,” Luke says, trying to calm Clint back down. “I mean Pepper will surely be made Editor-in-Chief soon. Hopefully, that is an opening for Steve.”
Everyone groans over the top of each other. Peter chocks a little, horrified by the image that is now in his head. Sam is making retching sounds as Mr Stark is flailing, not seeming to realise he now has one up on the blonde. Steve isn’t bothered by anyone's reaction, stubbornly keeping his eyes locked on the boss with a look in his eye that implies he just won something only he is aware of.
Peter shuts his eyes as he feels his chest fill with pride. Impressing THE Tony Stark is so exciting that Peter can hardly think straight. Which is probably the reason he stupidly says what he says next.
“Is that why you’ve been passed over so many promotions?” Peter presses. His foot in mouth syndrome really was in full swing today.
Steve needs a partner that won’t be scared off by all that. Maybe even someone that can challenge him when his stubbornness goes a little too far.
Jones looks delighted by Peter’s tipsy state, clearly committing it to memory to use it against him in their war. “How has Peter come to that conclusion?”
Peter hurries to take a few more steps away from the door so that when Rhodey opens it he doesn’t suspect Peter may have been listening in.
“Oh Peter, You look like you’ve just seen a ghost.” Jones comes over to comfort him “Don’t stress, it’s a harmless misunderstanding.”
“Okay, some of these things are ridiculous” Sam sighs “But a couple of them are doable. I would say start with 2 and 7.”
“Peter. Pepper and Happy have been married for years now.” Luke informs carefully, in a tone that one would usually use when talking to a five-year-old.
Peter is infuriated and grumps a little bit as he sips at his coffee. How is he meant to make headway in finding someone for Steve if the man holds his cards so close to his chest? Peter’s going to need to find someone that wouldn’t let Steve keep them at a distance. Someone that would pretty much demand Steve to open up because the man seems to be pretty terrible at doing that himself.
Jerking his head towards the voice Peter watches Fisk literally slide – Full on slink actually - out from the shadows. Like a goddamn super-villain!
Bucky rudely ignores Peter “I thought we didn’t have favourite coworkers Stevie? Isn’t that what you supposedly told bugboy last night?”
“I have management starting up an investigation on me, somehow started world war three between my two mentors and not only not managed to make any headway with the one task I’ve been working on all week but thoroughly embarrassed myself trying in the process. So yeah, just your average Tuesday.”
There are cheers and clinks all around as Peter pulls himself out of the emotions swirling within him.
Also, if Jones is right about Steve being a closet-romantic then he will absolutely melt at some of the crazy suggestions, Peter figures reluctantly as he hands the piece of paper off.
They stay where they are as they spy Rhodey coming from around another corner and letting himself into the boss’s office. Well, he starts to but ends up freezing halfway through the door and throwing his hand over his eyes. There’s a yelp from inside the office and the sound of something crashing.
“I care very much on the order.” Rhodey grits out, once again reminding everyone what he has suffered through.
Peter gives them a playful glare. “You know, Mr Stark asks quite often if I want to work with you guys as well as with Steve, but never seems surprised when I turn the offer down.” Peter quips.
“Wouldn’t dream of it” Steve deadpans and goes back to eating the doughnut. “Who was the third one for anyway?”
“Oh, awesome. I’m going now then.” Peter says as he scrambles to gather his stuff, throwing his camera over his shoulder.
Peter mentally punches his fist in the air. He’s counting this as his first win. Knowing Steve, while busy, is wanting to find a partner is great news. This is something Peter can work with. Now he just had to find someone that is strong-willed and would compliment well with the career-driven man in front of him. Piece of cake.
“Hey! I liked this painting.” Tony scolds “If you knew how much this painting cost you might actually cry.”
Jess, having overheard their gossiping, squints at the group before flicking her long glossy hair at a them.
Bucky’s shooting Sam a sceptical look which Peter can tell means the sub-editor didn’t quite believe his fiance. Logan, on the other hand, looks like he is so bored he is considering homicide just to liven up his day. It’s quite the impressive expression coming from the usually blank staring man. If Peter was braver (or insane), he would definently label Logan a bore most of the time.
“I tried hinting that to Steve the other day but he is adamant that he won’t be receiving a promotion. The poor guy, I mean what more does the fella have to do? I know he and Stark smash heads a lot but if Tony is using that as a reason for bypassing Steve then he needs to take a good hard look at himself.” Clint spits out while Luke’s face becomes sour as the conversation continues.
“You live in a mansion. It’s not like you can’t pay for a few of your hard-working employees' drinks.” Steve says, unimpressed.
Peter was hoping to talk Steve into taking Pepper out to lunch if they had more work to do today but stops as he watches the blonde’s body immediately go as stiff as a pole.
“Oh, I’ve done something worse than that. I’ve beaten you, Fisk. Where can you even go from here? You’ve been disgraced. No one is going to want to work with you after they hear about what has gone down at Marvels.”
“What? Oh yeah! Stark’s been having weekly meetings with Drew because he’s preparing a big announcement in the next week. Something about a new direction for him. I’m just- Well I haven’t been on the outs of something like that in a couple of years so I’m... curious to know what Stark has planning that requires so many secrets.” Steve runs a hand across his face, a tired look in his eyes.
Before Peter could figure out a way to ask, he was interrupted by Jess and Mr Stark coming back over to the table to join them. Mr Stark immediately going for the kill.
“Oh Peter, I don’t think you’ve met my friend Danny. He’s one of Marvels’ freelance photographers.” Luke says motioning to the lean man next to his girlfriend.
In fact, if this is a movie he would do the inevitable drunk WhY ArE We WhIsPhEring skit. But he doesn’t because Peter is not a cliché.
“Yeah, because some stupid businessmen take single women more seriously. Dumb that she has to deal with that, but it’s a basis Pepper tries to avoid so her playing field isn’t disadvantaged. I think Happy and Pepper had special chains made instead to show their commitment to each other” Jones explains while Peter’s stomach really starts to churn.
“I’m not used to relying on people.” Tony continues, oblivious to impending disaster. “I’ve spent most of my earlier years telling myself I had to do everything on my own. Had a strong sense of independence instilled in me since I was a child. So learning to share burdens and goals has been a big journey for me. Through this last year though, I’ve come to see that I was wrong, I do need someone. And not a miracle worker or my own personal superhero. Nothing so magnificent and every bit more valuable. In fact, it turned out all I needed was someone from Brooklyn and some-“
The statement niggles something in the back of Peter’s brain for some bizarre reason. He’s not sure why he should be making some sort of connection so he shakes it away.
Steve’s face morphs from anger to shock to understanding. Mr Stark rounds on Peter so quickly the intern can hardly think straight as his boss is crowding into his personal space.
Ignoring his antics, Sam and Bucky put their heads together and start whispering loudly. Peter feels uneasy as he catches Sam’s eyes grow wide before morphing into a hint mischievous.
It is well known among the office to keep the pair separated if nobody wanted any damages or shattered feelings to occur that day. Peter hadn’t seen them really go for each other's throats since he’s been here but he has seen enough to observe how the two men both seem to have an uncanny knack of pushing each other's buttons.
Peter stands there for a second, noticing somewhere during the conversation he had broken out into the sweats.
“I have a date. I just thought I’d quickly drop beforehand to let you all know I was done tying up the last of the Fisk loose ends with Matt Murdoch. You were right Tony, Matt did spot some things we both missed for the law suit.”
How was this such an impossible task? On paper, it seemed so simple. Two attractive single people being thrown together by their friends should cause something to stick.
“Pep, your lack of faith wounds me. I’m a grown up. I’m perfectly capable of doing things without telling you.”
Steve stills, his grin falling into a frown “Fourth? Tony, it’s only 9 o’clock. Are you trying to kill yourself?!”
Peter starts to feel victorious about the ploy when seeing the attention Steve is drawing. When even Mr Stark seems to be taken by surprise from Steve’s appearance, as he and Pepper come down the hall with T’challa, Peter is sure they have gotten it right this time.
Mr Stark turns his back on Peter to recheck in Steve and make sure he is okay. Steve shakes his head assuringly and keeps saying “It’s okay Tony.” And “He didn’t know”
When Peter sees it’s Mr Stark he moans a little “Oh no. Not you too. Jones is in for a world of pain.” Peter is still feeling extremely overwhelmed and having a conversation with the boss does nothing to ease his emotions.
Of course, this may be because of the rumoured rivalry that Steve and Mr Stark apparently have had going for years now, Peter muses to himself, looking round the room to see if anyone else finds the dynamic in front of them rather odd as well.
..... Maybe…… that was what Steve needed. A person that would work to be his partner in life as well as his lover.
“I would have to say the contrary, I came over to let you know you’ve proven to be a worthy man over the last week, Peter. In my eyes anyway.” T’challa ducks into Peter’s view.
“A little more is a gross understatement. You work harder than a horse” Peter grumbles under his breath.
“That's what I think! I’ve been telling him that for months.” He gave Sam a wide eyed stare and with a stage whisper towards him “It’s been YONKS!”
Peter can tell they were all written by the same neat cursive handwriting. Until he read the last one he assumed they were from Pepper but there’s no way Pepper would refer to Fisk as a jackass, no matter how accurate that may be. She was too professional. Maybe they had been from Rhodey? Peter would have to try and catch him later and see if the man would share some others with him.
Peter nodded. Happy hadn’t been at Marvels for a couple of years but he was still always floating around and eager to help out if asked. Pepper seems to convince him do all kinds of tasks for her. It was a good sign to see Pepper getting Steve to help her out with Mr Stark. That's got to mean she at least trusts him, Peter thinks to himself in relief.
Looking up from his laptop, he sees almost everyone else has already left for the day while he was daydreaming.
“Clint wanted one and said that if I was a true friend I’d get it for him” Tony responds “And for some reason, I like that asshole. So here we are.”
Bucky visibly gags “Ew, that’s like asking someone why they aren’t dating their brother. Besides Steve has nothing up against this one.” He indicates to the man standing beside him.
Slowly, Peter processes what had just gone down and comes close to a breakdown for the second time in a day.
“The only person that bastard is occasionally put in his place by is Steve. But I’m pretty sure that’s because when Steve stands all puffed out and intimidating he somehow looks HUGE. Did you inform Steve this has been happening?” Luke continues.
Peter’s jaw drops. Steve and Tony hadn’t even been trying to keep their relationship a secret and still no one figured it out. The marvel rumour mill is going to flip, Clint might even break something.
A small satisfied smile forms on Peter’s face. That would be nice. With Stark’s father having recently passed away and now being the owner of Stark Industries along with all the responsibilities of Marvels means the man’s plate is very full. Mr Stark could use someone else being there to share the mental load he is currently dealing with. It’s well known Mr Stark is always taking on more than he should be and though Pepper tries to share the workload around, knowing his boss will have another person there to look out for him helps rest some of Peter's (and honestly most of the rest of the company’s) previous worries.
Chatting with said man now along with Rhodey, Pepper and Tony, Peter watches Steve clutch his chest in laughter and concludes that the man is clearly happy regardless. It’s probably time for Peter to back off now, before he makes an embarrassment of himself .....again.
“No!” Fisk screams as Jess makes a grab at Wilson, knocking the gun clean from his hand and one of Pepper’s heels pistol from across the room, knocking the dick clean in the head and causing him to fall to his knees.
Back inside, Peter finds that Tony has already begun the speech the company has been anxiously waiting for. With all eyes on the boss, nobody notice’s that two people are coming in from the patio rather than just one.
Rhodey scoffs “You know I only pretend that you are the big man of the hour, don’t get ahead of yourself. You’re really just my sidekick.”
“But he still ended up being one step ahead of me Steven! And I almost lost you because of it. What if I had lost you honey?” Tony says, as close to panicking as Peter has ever seen him.
Peter pauses and follows the instructions, bringing his panic back down to a minim. He then launches into an explanation of what’s gone down in the last hour, Mj humming every now and then to show she’s following. By the time he finishes, his face is bright red and mortified all over again by his stupidity.
Wait, Peter thinks, had Pepper gotten Happy to warn Steve off when Happy still worked as security? No, surely not. Why would anyone reject Steve?
“Dumbass” And the blonde says it the same way he always has but Peter hears what he’d never been able to identify before. The warmth and fondness that flowered Steve’s tone was hard to miss now. Especially when accompanied with the action of Steve pulling the boss in to kiss him on the forehead.
“I’m sorry again for anything I might have ruined. Coming in between you both was a big mistake.” Peter looks down at his feet, his mind still seeing Steve’s look of shock at the mention of the velvet box. “Even with things like your disagreement about Fisk. If I hadn’t gotten involved maybe you two wouldn’t have fought about it as much.”
Steve rubs the back of his neck at the praise he seems to find in the mountain of words Mr Stark just threw at him.
“That’s just your fancy way to say you think my opinions are shit, ROGERS.” Mr Stark bites out. “For somebody who said they weren’t going to yell 5 minutes earlier, you seem to be doing quite a lot of it. I get it, everyone is inadequate when compared next to you. Especially me. But like it or not, Wilson is not your problem and I don’t have to run this magazine the way you want me to. Just like I didn’t have to run it the way my father or anyone else wanted me to!”
“I’ve had to put up with your lovestruck behaviour for years, none the wiser on why you’ve been acting like more of a space cadet than usual. The last thing you deserve is kind.”
Tony squawks at the statement as Steve nudges his side affectionately “You are completely ruining my image here sweetheart.” Steve just rolls his eyes and messes with the front of Tony’s meticulously groomed hair making the boss whine further.
“Okay, jokes aside. It’s your lucky day Parker. You may just be onto something so I am going to offer you my assistance with Steve. Now if you are done being a cock blocker, I plan to catch that brunette before he leaves.” Clint gets up to go after the man across the room.
Even though it’s happening at this very moment, it is still hard for Peter to believe he is here, watching an actual pitch meeting for the next issue of Marvels: A Magazine of Adventures.
“I have no idea if you are being sarcastic or not anymore.” Jess comments as she wonders past, heading off to the toilets.
There were a lot of cute girls around the store. There’s a sweet looking blonde with a high pitched voice chatting on her phone, the beautiful dark-skinned women pushing her glasses up as she looked closer at her computer or the peppy tall brunette who was leaning against the counter chatting with the barista as she waited for her beverage. But Steve, the insufferable saint, hadn’t tried once to sneak a glance at any of them.
“GAHHH” Mr Stark says while making grabbing motions towards the doughnut with his hand that’s holding his coffee.
“You all are idiots” Peter catches her muttering as they all try to shift their attention back to what Pepper is going over.
“I wouldn’t hold your breath, Sam. I’ve been telling Steve for ages that Tony enjoys getting a rise out of him and it would be better to ignore the guy. But that Punk can never help himself. He’s always been too dumb to run from a fight” Bucky says with an eye roll, shaking his head as they bemoan about his best friend.
“Trying to solve the mystery that is Steve’s lack of love life?” Jess says, smiling knowingly. Steve's so wrapped up in proving his point to Mr Stark he doesn’t even respond to the use of his name.
Peter laughs silently while Mr Stark, having caught the end of Clint’s antics, attempts to throw a wadded up piece of paper at Clint's head. It doesn’t have any real effect as Clint swats it away easily. Peter is a little envious as all his coworkers avasion skills, he knows had he been the target he would most likely be splat out on the floor currently.
Peter unfolds the paper and wants to crumble dramatically to his knees. Only Peter’s life could end up being as much of a farce as this. Clint can’t be serious? The list looks like it was written out by a giggly love-sick child in elementary school. Peter lets out a sigh and pockets the list.
“I dunno. Still sounds like integrating someone into their new role so that we are accumulated with them before their new position is announced.” Jones says, her tone clipped.
“Ughh I changed my mind. Let’s go back to the secret thing” Clint’s nose crinkles as he looks at the pair with pretend disdain. “I’m not going to handle this sicken behaviour on top of my normal workload.”
And no, petty was not his middle name. This was about justice and war! He tells his MJ sounding self-conscious.
Peter looks up and, as if he were the devil himself, sees Mr Stark heading towards their table with Jessica Drew.
“Trust me, this is how it works in all the movies. Plus Bucky all but confirmed Steve’s crush. This is going to work.” Peter says without missing a beat. He knows he’s sounding insane but he’s desperate to find a way that is going to help Steve.
“Rhodeybear this is the most important decision I’ve ever made. I want this ring to show… everything.” Tony says, stress layering his voice. “Now silver or rose gold? Do you think the inscription is too sappy? What if it isn’t the right size?”
While Peter is finding it all very fascinating, Clint, the sandy blonde Beauty Editor and Stylist sitting next to him, is clearly getting bored.
“Don’t be silly. Nobody could have predicted Fisk would have that violent a reaction and everything you did with the espionage case was handled to the letter. Nobody could have done that as well as you did sweetheart.”
“What? Peter can’t say I’m bullying him if you all go by said nickname!” Mr Stark yells as he walks out of the conference room, giving a sly wink before he disappeared.
God, what a nightmare. Actually no, Not a nightmare. This is something worse than a nightmare for Peter. He can’t even begin to think about how he’s going to land on his feet from this one.
The hair on the back of Peter’s neck stands up. He knows Fisk doesn’t particularly like him but the large man behind him now sounded like someone looking for a fight.
“Of course, anything you need” Steve’s jaw tightens “Has the centre spread been double-checked yet? Tony needed it done yesterday?”
Peter leaves through the door, chuckling to himself as he wraps his head around this challenge he just agreed to.
“To be fair we didn’t make much of a headway on the conversation because we were interrupted by Mr Stark” Peter says
“Yes!” Sam exclaims “You better come out with us tonight. It’s Fireball Friday at Josie’s, a bar Jones and Luke have some connection with. We go most weeks to take advantage of the cheap drinks and Steve usually comes. It’ll be a more relaxed place for you to do some matchmaking magic”
The thing is Peter hadn’t just relied on the rumour mill for this either. He had done his own recon. He had watched Steve very closely those first couple days and the man had seemed to spend every moment finding ways to go spend time up at Pepper’s office floor. Steve’s crush came across bigger than Ben Hurr. This didn’t make any sense!
“Pete, you’re being a bit hard on yourself.” Tony stipulates “It’s not like you convinced Fisk to come by with a gun to my birthday celebrations.”
Both the men seem ready to fire back but hesitate, eyes going soft at the mention of the title fiance.
Steve and Pepper, waiting on Mr Stark to fiddle with the elevator controls himself to fix the problem, are too busy trying to keep Happy breathing  and answering calls ensuring their friends that they are okay to even engage in anything considered flirting.
Mr Stark, obviously seeing the blonde’s discomfort, tries to comfort him. If not somewhat very badly.
By the time T’challa cuts Peter off Peter realises he has been talking and showing him pictures for over 40 minutes.
Leaping up, he crazily stuffs everything in front of him in his bag and prays to god Steve was once again working himself silly and hadn’t left the building yet.
“Fisk is being more of a dick than usual this week. He’s graduated to rank absolute piece of shit.” Clint fills in, obviously sensing Peter’s struggle to keep up with the current conversation.
“Jesus, I’ve never seen someone drink a cup of tea so judgmentally in my life.” Mr Stark pouts “Quit your nagging and hurry it up blondie. Those pictures don’t edit themselves you know?”
Peter shakes his head in disagreement “I’ve fucked up. Royally fucked up. I’ve made all the mistakes.”
Fisk drags Peter back to his office to torment the intern further by throughly showing him everywhere he went wrong in the last hour causing Peter to have to leave the letter behind.
“That was almost the most romantic thing you’ve ever said until you ruined it at the end there” Steve says, perplexed at the image Tony is making. “Beside it was my shoulder, no need to be so dramatic.”
By the end of the day, Fisk is being called by legal to pack his stuff and banned from Marvels premise for the foreseeable future. The man is livid and most of security has to be there as he is sent out. Even Happy swings by to make sure the man doesn’t get violent.
“Good thing you have two hands! Wait, that pun doesn’t work as I feel it should. Ahh, what the heck, I’m going to use it anyway.”
“You know that company you have a lawsuit with right now have changed their name to Anti-Stark-Solutions...... Which means you can now shorten their name to ASS.......Oh and if they did a tie in with Hershey’s you could use candyass. Wow I’m seriously blabbing about ass right now. Ughh Why am I even -........You know this is like a nightmare I had once, only I’m not naked this time.”
“Tony! For once, stop being such a smart ass and listen to me!” Steve says mulishly, probably leveling the full weight of his disapproval on the boss.
”Well that would be just awful,” Peter says flatly. He doesn’t really care about baseball but he knows that Steve does. Steve only throws him an amused look though before indicating for Peter to follow him to the elevator.
“Cheers to the sneaky love birds” Clint cries, exuberant. Hands holding glasses all raise, following along with Clint in joyful agreement and shouting cheerfully at Steve and Tony. The couple nod at their friend’s in thanks and then return back to each other, obviously enjoying the fact that they are able to engage in showing one another attention in the presence of company.
Jess’s face is now what Peter can only describe as unimpressed “Don’t be dense Parker. Stupid is not a good look on you.”
“Oh shit, tough luck getting caught in that” Bucky laughs “Did you show any mercy in front of the newbie Stevie? Or have the boss and your jerk antics managed to scare him off.”
“Steve refuses to share food with you?! Man, I’m sorry. I guess he just doesn’t like you guys as much as I thought. It's my intention for you guys to receive some too. In no way is Steve my favourite” Peter says innocently.
"Oh yeah? A meeting spent spinning around on a chair and an extra-long lunch break is clearly showing us that. Gold star for Peter Parker." Clint smirks
Jess laughs though “Do you ever actually do any work here?” she says, the incredulity in her voice is laced with amusement.
Fisk waves Steve off “I’ve had an extremely busy day with Vanessa sorting out Stark’s mess. She was utterly offended by the decision made this morning.”
“Ughhh nowhere. I just …. I ignorantly thought when you had mentioned Danny that you were talking about a Danielle. I hadn’t realised Steve was also interested in guys. Not that that’s an issue! I’m just realising, as Jess has pointed out to me VERY recently, that I AM awfully obtuse on occasion.” Peter explains, feeling slightly stupid.
Peter hangs back out of sight, knowing it will not be received well if he interrupts the two men now.
Watching on only confirms Peter’s new insight. As worried and concerned everyone else in the room is for Steve, Tony is almost beside himself. No one is able to tear Steve away from the boss’s protective embrace. Not even the paramedics, who are trying to help, can get Stark to leave the blonde’s side, instead compromising by bringing Tony along with them as they bundle Steve into the back of the van.
“This isn’t a situation I can just punch my way out of Steve. I know that’s your forte but something like this requires far more delicacy.” Stark hisses icily. “I’m sorry if how I’m handling this is hurting your feelings but your lack of faith is approaching offensive.”
“Peter, whatever it is I’m sure it’s not as bad as you think.” Bucky suggests, trying to calm the intern down.
Peter glows from the comment. That’s the closet thing to praise that would ever come from Jess’s lips. Luke bumps Peter in congratulations while Jones smiles proudly.
Steve and Mr Stark both startle a little. Really? It’s as if they’d forgotten Peter was even sitting there. He’d be offended if he wasn’t currently in hysterics. The two look at each other and fidget on the spot, seeing how silly their argument is coming across. Steve looks very sheepish and Mr Stark looks weirdly pleased as Peter pulls himself back together.
Someone who knew Steve less probably thought he wanted a sweet smiled, polite young woman who was attentive and warm.
The three of them are just finishing off the last of their drinks when they hear a large yelp come from the other side of the room. Clint has apparently made some sort of comment that displeased Jess and received one of her famous elbow jabs causing him to spill soda down his shirt.
“Absolutely not. The only good thing out of this is the fact that I’m now getting 12 percent of the company. And after the bullshit you both started pulling in these last few weeks, I’m in good mind to raise it up to 20”
“Oh, you want me to help on this one” Clint says with a knowing smile. “I have accumulated a wealth of knowledge on the office and it’s inhabitants. If there’s anyone who knows the ways to Steveo’s heart, it is me. Plus the more I’m down to help Peter, the more I’m hanging around your department's level. This means closer proximity to Fisk which will piss him off immensely. See! Everybody’s a winner! I plan to educate the dick on the brilliance of Miley Cyrus this week.”
“Horribly. Steve is so wrapped up in this Fisk/Stark situation that he’s barely thinking about finding the love of his life.” Peter sulks, feeling more despaired about the whole plan now that he wasn’t boosted by the misguided liquid courage he had last night.
“GOD no! You look good Steve. Great even. Not that you don’t usually look great I mean... Ughh of course it’s not nesscary to look great to be good at your job bu- oh ugh no you are good at your job Steve. The best even. You are invaluable here.” The boss finishes spluttering.
He should probably message MJ but she will want him to tell her everything that happened and Peter’s not ready to face the music yet.
“I’m Peter Parker. The doer of impossible things. Give me a task and watch it be done not only flawlessly but with style.” He says as he wiggles his eyebrows.
Peter decides to ignore that and go greet the two men to put an end to their misery. It’s all quite pleasant as they all hop into the elevator together before Peter has to go ahead and ruin it.
Peter paces impatiently until help arrives at the building and Tony pulls Steve up around his shoulders to help the man into the vehicle.
“Yep! Absolutely! Everything is groovy?” ...Groovy? Peter could just smother himself sometimes “I just wanted to grab some directions off you to Josie’s. Sam said you go every week?”
“Stark, you better offer Steve the job again. And Stevie you better goddamn take it this time.” Bucky demands as the rest of the table nods in an agreement.
“Leaving so soon? I just wanted to let you know that your final three images aren’t up to scratch. I need them redone.” Fisk says sourly.
“See. Watch this” Bucky demonstrates to Sam as he places his hand on his fiance’s back to direct his attention.
Fisk’s face is now as red as a firetruck. Being ganged up on may have been one step too many for the gun holder because something in his beady little eyes snaps. Pushing Peter out of the way the man grins an awful menacing smile and fires directly at Tony Stark’s chest.
Clint ducks and continues “It’s true! We just thought you were both too stubborn to ever manage confessing those hard ons to each other.” He ducks again as Tony lobs another napkin his way.
Bucky’s face becomes calculating and he gives Steve a little shove. “Why don’t you focus less on the boss and more on your protege over there? Look at him. The pathetic little lamb is lost without you. I haven’t seen him even pretend to do any work today.”
Steve’s eyes soften slightly. “Tony likes you Pete. Can’t shut up about you actually. You’ve impressed him over the last couple of weeks.”
Tony gaps at Peter in shock, disbelief in his eyes. Peter goes to brag but notices Clint’s eye become daggers directed at Tony.
“… Okay. Pepper is a fantastic woman so I get your admiration but be careful how you phrase things. Wouldn’t want Happy getting the wrong idea.”
“We have a bet on whether Tony and Jessica have started dating. They have been going out for coffee at least three times a week lately, I didn’t think that meant anything originally but…. Well I’ve been more inclined to agree with this smart woman as each week goes by. They are around each other a lot. She's been going by his office every day at the moment.”
“Tony? Will you pay for it?” Steve says, a cheeky grin threatening to split his face as Mr Stark turns back in response to his name.
Peter turns back around and sees both Happy and Tony hunched over the top of a body that Peter has now connected with the blonde flash that had gotten in the way of the bullet intended for Tony.
Some of Steve’s stories still blow Peter away, especially the ones about protest activities and the work that goes into advocating for many social stances. The man has even had a couple of arrests.
Peter stiffens as the brunette gets closer. It was a little weird to think he was going to be drinking with the big boss. He hadn’t known Mr Stark came to these.
He knows he doesn’t have to take the task seriously. Sam and Bucky won’t do much more than hang some shit on him. Something they already do anyway.
“Steve is up with Pepper right now and I need you to get them out of her office so I can slip this on her desk before T’challa arrives for their meeting.” Peter lays out.
Other than the ending, the scene is a familiar one to Peter and he starts to internally count how many times he’s seen the pair behave this way in front of him before. With this comes a few discoveries.
Then out of the corner of his eye, the intern notices two figures moving slowly through the crowd. Oh thank fuck.
Peter is starstruck. He is now on first name basis with Tony freaking Stark. His ten-year-old self would most likely faint from that knowledge.
Pepper gives a nod of approval at the clothes, pulling T’challa and Mr Stark (in the latter’s case she gives a forceful push as Stark seems frozen to the spot) back towards the elevator. Probably drafting a strongly worded email to whatever loser was making her work harder that day.
As he waits, Peter observes the pair, noticing how well they compliment each other. Both tall, fit and giving off an aura of confidence, like two Greek gods.  And wait.... there’s that fierce energy that Peter was just thinking about.
“Mmmm, it is my highest bid so far.” Mr Stark says with amusement “But do you even have a dollar on you?”
He, Virginia “Call me Pepper” Potts his main editor and right-hand man, James “Just call me Rhodey” Rhodes the Social Media Manager and Steve Rogers, one of the Picture Editors, were all in a deep conversation about the direction the magazine currently, heads all pressed together as they look over some of the proposed boards. Peter truly believes he could spend all day watching the three debate where they should be taking Marvels this month and how to go about ironing out the kinks they could foresee occurring in the upcoming weeks.
Then, with quicker reflexes than Peter could ever have imagined, Steve swipes one of the donuts off Mr Stark’s plate while the man is distracted, grinning triumphantly once he has his stolen prize in his hands.
As Peter makes his way over to the fridge he can’t help but over hear the conversation as Sam is making it quite the spectacle of himself. The dark man’s hands are flailing wildly as he catches the other two up on what they missed in the meeting. It would have been difficult to have ignored the chatter realistically.
Peter smiles. The pair seem to have decided to bury the hatchet and though they have still bickered tonight, it’s much more light hearted and almost fond in comparison to the heated fights that they had previously been having.
“Peter is apparently setting up a trap to catch my mysterious pen kidnapper so he gets a pass for not working currently. However, if he keeps sticking his nose where it doesn’t belong my attitude towards him may change very quickly.” Steve says as he stretches out his neck, his body loosening up a little. “If I didn’t know any better Bucky, I would say your subtle praise for Pete just then is an indication that he is growing on you. Before you know it he’s going to be one of your favourites.”
Peter flinches. He can feel himself starting to splutter in surprise but stops himself because he is trying to come across as cool and collected.
Peter sweats as he thinks through their proposal. Steve really was a good guy and he didn’t want to do anything to make Steve upset with him. But from what Peter could tell Bucky and Sam were basically Steve’s closest friends and he doubted they would have tasked someone with something they believed would hurt the blonde. Plus Peter doesn’t like to brag but he was a bit of a matchmaker back in the day. His girlfriend might disagree but he liked to think that he was.
“Yes, Hammer could be a problem. Nice of Steve to handle him.” T’challa says “Now Peter show me this camera and the impressive photographs you have taken.”
“Did Steve draw that? Wow, I had no idea he was that good. Wait, isn’t Steve going to be mad you stole that?”
“The image of the family all around the table for thanksgiving, laughing. Each one of them telling each other all the obnoxiously good things they had done to help out while Steve craves up the turkey. It's an easy image to see, Luke. Steve would have even taught them all to happily help prep the turkey without complaining! Hell, all the kids probably volunteer to be the one to stick their hands up its bum and we all know that’s the worst part.” Peter rubs his face while he spouts bullshit, his head feeling a little woozy. This drink should probably be his last while he is still on the pleasant side of tipsy.
Peter bobs his head, not meeting the eyes of either of the men in front of him, still completely embarrassed by the shenanigans he had coordinated the office to pull on the blonde.
“Hey! I can be quick.” Peter counters “You’re looking at the guy who left Billy Pinder in the dust in the second-grade sack race. Don’t worry That little head of yours”. Peter didn’t have a plan though so he has no idea why he’s telling Bucky that he does.
Peter gets closer to see it’s a sketch of him and Jess chatting at the bar last night. The amount of detail in the sketch astonishes Peter. It is impressive.
The pair were hopeless, pretty much ignorant to the rest of the world outside their own as they continue to squabble. But they were a good kind of hopeless. The kind of hopeless Peter knows he and MJ are when they are together. The kind that clearly care about one another deeply and only want to make the other happy.
Peter reluctantly takes the drinks and swigs it back. He coughs as he feels his throat light on fire. He is pretty sure that was some kind of whisky and is already feeling all of the regret. Peter is known for not being able to handle his whisky. MJ made him swear to never drink it around her again.
Peter shakes his head. He knows everyone is having troubles with Fisk at the moment but nobody more than Steve. It was common knowledge around the office that most people would prefer Steve in Fisk’s position which makes conversations between the two rather icy even on the best of days. Peter didn’t want to make matters worse because the asshole has thrown some petty insults the intern’s way. Peter’s certainly heard worse.
“Hammer industries!” Jess smiles triumphantly. “Peter, you wizard! Tony and I have been trying to find evidence that Wilson has been selling stories to Hammer’s Magazine for months and here it is. This changes everything! We need to get this to legal right now.”
“Alright, quiet down Mr E Harmony. Don’t you remember my advice on accepting Clint’s help?” Luke says, poking Peter in his side. Peter watches the finger and notes that he can hardly feel it.
Steve just rolls his eyes and purposely starts slurping his tea noisily and somehow in slow motion. He looks back at the boss with a shit-eating grin. Mr Stark sqwaks in response.
“So Padawan, let me wisdom you up in the ways of Steve.” Clint sits on the side of the pool table, patting at the spot next to him to indicate for Peter to join.
“Wait! Wait, the final touch.” And then the man is shoving his hands in Steve’s hair and messing it up.
Peter refuses to take bullshit from a man that nobody in the office has any respect for when Peter really hasn’t done anything wrong.
Rhodey slams the door shut again and leans with his back against it while hitting his head into the panel behind him.
“Shhhhhhh Steve! That’s a company secret” Tony says in a stage whisper with an exaggerated look on his face.
Stark has only recently started taking on his dad’s role as publisher and so was currently juggling it with his old role of editor-in-chief while he looked for a suitable replacement for his old position. Meaning there really was no time for Mr Stark to not be in the thick of everything.
“Mmm I think you owe us a bit of boot-licking young man” Bucky says a little more lightly “We are older and wiser than you after all.”
Rhodey gives up and walks away quietly saying to himself “Humilating” “Unprofessional”, too caught up in his own thoughts to notice Luke and Peter.
“The office apparently thought I was lonely, Hon.” Steve informs “They didn’t like thinking about how they all have somebody to go home to and I didn’t. It’s actually kind of sweet when you think about it.”
They are both stunning and intelligent individuals and would make a very good looking couple. Jess seems a little young for Mr Stark but then again, Mr Stark really does come off as a child at heart while Jess is an old soul. So they kinda balance each other out. It could make a lot of sense for them to be together.
“Ummm ....What?” Steve interrupts, eyes blown up to the size of ping pong balls and looking at Peter as if the intern just grew a second head.
Clint looks like his head is about to explode. Peter feels around for his pockets for his phone to see if he can sneak a photo. This is something he wants to remember.
Bucky punches Steve in the arm for that comment as Peter silently thanks God that he can see Clint coming back over with his drink. Hopefully, he can use it to bleach his brain of the last of this conversation.
Steve was always trying to make his way up to Pepper and Tony’s office level. And he was always doing over-time to help with extra tasks that were swamping Pepper and Tony. And he had jumped at the chance to help Pepper organise Tony’s birthday celebrations AND he was constantly shouting his praises at how well Tony and Pepper ran the magazine.
Steve is sitting on the couch, leaning against an arrangement of propped up pillows. He looks healthy and comfortable in comparison to Tony, whose dishevelled state gives away just how out of his mind with worry he has been over Steve’s injury.
“I’m serious, beloved” Tony careful unwinds himself from Steve’s arms so he can stand in front of him. “I’m not half as good at anything as I am when next to you.”
Steve doesn’t answer further and rather places his hand on the side of Tony’s face and pecks him on the lips to placate him. Pulling back, Steve gazes at Tony with a dazzling smile on his face and Tony is looking close to falling over from the wake of being caught in it.
“I still don’t understand why you kept this a secret?” Clint grumbles “We all knew you both had hard ons the size of Jupiter for each other”
That tension that always seems to build between the pair is as thick as pea soup by now. Peter gulps down the rest of his food and exclaims he better be heading off as Aunt May will be worried. Aiming to avoid the repeat of the awkward elevator fiasco.
“Don’t get ahead of yourself Stark. You cannot run that until you have received confirmation that T’challa is going to like the angle we are taking” Steve says in a stern tone.
Mr Stark just waves off Steve’s concern “and deprive the group of a night made better by my fun wacky ways and ability to have a good time. Unlike some other sticks in the mud here.”
Bucky stalks out murmuring “nightmare” and though he doesn’t want to admit it, for once Peter can’t disagree. This is all getting out of hand in a way that was only capable with Parker luck. He doesn’t know how Aunt May put up with all of it for so long.
“I should have checked what was in the muffin before taking one from you. It’s not your fault, it could have happened to anyone.”
“Maybe you can spare some time in your day Steve to have a chat with small fry later and help him think of some good ideas” Bucky slyly suggests.
“I will never understand why this place treats an imbecile like you with such esteem and someone like I, one of the backbones and superiors in this company, with such disrespect”
And she’d be crazy to turn down someone like Steve. Everyone around the office talks about how much of a catch the blonde man is. Pepper is also married to her work just like Steve is. They match each other in so many ways. In fact, it’s surprising they ar-. Peter’s thoughts pull up short. Why are they not already together? The two of them have known each other years by now. At least since Steve was hired.
“That’s because I’m Steve’s favourite.” Peter jumps in, hoping to move the conversation back into lighter territory. Peter is not really sure how the two men had gotten here but he definitely wants to avoid having that prick Fisk bringing down everyone’s happy mood. Especially since said prick is not even here with them tonight.
It seemed like a great idea until Happy ends up slipping in with them at the last minute and has a full-blown panic attack because he’s claustrophobic. Not to mention how the whole company goes on alert, panicking over the fact that three of their colleges are trapped with no way out.
“You’re a cocky guy for someone who hasn’t even been asked to be my best man yet. I have other options, Platypus. Thor could be back in town. Hell, Logan would at least provide a butt load of booze to my epic bachelor party.” Tony says, insecurities from before seem forgotten. “Now get out Honey Bear. I’ve got Underoos waiting outside and I’d like to introduce him to Mr Hello Kitty here before Fisk inevitably storms in with his next list of complaints and demands.”
“I’m going to wine and dine the fuck out of you now that I can. Get you all dressed up for the fanciest restaurant and spoil you rotten.” Tony continues, sitting his chin up on Steve’s shoulder and humming happily.
Sam and Bucky, well actually most of the company but mainly these two, give Peter a bit of a hard time but he had thought it had all been in fun and games. It would be just like Peter to go too far with a joke and put his foot in his mouth though. He should have known withholding food is where some people drew the line. He needed to make it up to them quickly so he could avoid complaints getting back to Steve.
“Nooo really! Today I was up on Mr Stark and Pepper’s floor because I was meeting the boss of Panther Corp, T’challa an-”
After about 20 minutes, as Peter is examining his cameras, he realises that the one he set up by Steve’s desk at the end of last week is still there, having been forgotten because of the week’s shenanigans. Sighing, he heads over to collect it but stops around the corner when he hears more yelling.
“You don’t have anything on me. There's not enough evidence.” Jess sits back with a cocky grin. Peter blanches, knowing that she's right. How does she keep catching him at every turn? Maybe he could set up his camera to do an around the corner shoot. Catch her in the act, Peter plans to himself, thinking out his step by step process.
“Necessary evil. I know everyone sees T...Stark and I quibble a lot but when it comes down to it, we work well as a team. Also, I guess we aren’t so bad when I’m up there in his office because Pepper is up there as well. She is always keeping our work on track.”
“Hey, hey. You just single-handedly exposed a major threat in my company, I think we can let a little mistake like that slide. I also think we can be on first name basis now Peter. Please call me Tony.”
“Here, get him to drink this. That’ll liven him back up” Clint says, handing Luke a glass. Luke puts the drink in Peter’s hands and helps guide the glass to his mouth.
“Well, maybe if you had been here for the first three-quarters of this meeting Wilson, you may have been able to persuade us,” Pepper glowers coolly. “However, since you weren't we found within the group discussion that the viewers will respond better to the Vibranium article. That it is more in trend and a major interest of our readers at the moment.”
“NO! Nah-uh. Nonono Nope.” Peter felt like saying no in every way he could think of would really help demonstrate just how undrunk he was. Because he is clever like that. “Jess just gave me more whisky. Sooooo it’s her fault I’m all g-g- giggly.”
Steve stops and looks across with a raised eyebrow. “Luke’s photographer friend? Super chill? Eyebrow and nipple piercing? Yeah, not ready for that right now.” And then he continues down the hallway. Peter couldn’t help but snort at the abruptness of it all. Unfortunetly, the snort is loud and ends up drawing everyone to notice he was in the room.
Bloody Clint and his tendency for hyperbola. The ass had made it out as if Steve was being stifled unjustly for the last few years. Had nobody realised Steve had been offered to take a higher position?
Peter spends the day flicking through his emails while trying to come up with one feasible idea on how to set Steve and Pepper up. It’s almost lunch, he’s at his wit's end and is idea-less still.
Peter cringes when the list is mentioned. Surely none of those ideas are going to work any better than the crazy drawing scheme he had just tried to pull off.
“But since I’m such a nice friend, just a raise and about a 12 percent stake will do. I’ll let you stay the major shareholder.” Rhodey continues.
“Right! I think I’ll just be handing your position off to my minion right here and I’ll have you thrown out to the streets if you’re going to be such a drama queen.” Mr Stark shrugs a little as Peter gives him a questioning look. The boss’s eyes are alight with amusement.
Steve’s mouth downturns as he looks over at Mr Stark once more “I know he knows what he’s doing. But I can’t help but be a little worried” He shakes himself and smiles back at Peter reassuringly “Anyway, I guess we will find out soon enough.”
Tony shakes his head in denial while pointing frantically at Peter. “It wasn’t me. It wasn’t me. It was minion.”
“I’m truly hurt. If this is the way you treat her no wonder you never see her. Maybe you are just starting to drop the ball huh? Not taken her anywhere fancy lately?”
Tony stops for a second, whether for dramatic effect or because he was making sure he worded what he’s going to say next perfectly, Peter wasn’t sure.
Maybe Peter should mention to some of the others to leave it alone too. It wouldn’t help if Mr Stark heard rumours which implied he was using his position to punish an employee. Even if everyone in the office thinks Steve is worth ten of Fisk that doesn’t mean anything malicious is going on if he is doing the extra voluntarily.
While Pepper isn’t the first person Peter would have had in mind for Steve, she is a good fit. Peter is pretty in awe of her brilliance and how efficient she is as a person. He can see how someone like Steve could fall for Pepper easily.
It means something to the other three though because they all send each other a look that Peter doesn’t understand. “Why? Does that mean something bad?”
“I hear they are Pepper’s favourite.” Peter says, deliberately causal. It’s a little white lie because Logan, needing to be at least a little unhelpful, had decided to bake T’challas favourite baked food instead. The wanker. “Maybe you can take a couple up to share with her?”
Mr Stark doesn’t seem to get the humour though because he just stands there spluttering before he throws his hands into the air and stomps off to get another doughnut.
“Maybe you’re just getting old Clint. Can’t keep up with us young studs.” Luke says as Peter starts to do a bit of a silly dance to celebrate the victory. It should have been super smooth but he somehow catches his foot on the leg of a nearby chair. The next thing Peter knows he’s lying on the floor.
The pair head up to Pepper and Mr Stark’s floor and poke their heads around the corner to check out the surroundings. Peter can just make out that Mr Stark is in his office because of the blue light coming from his monitors but it seems Pepper’s office is empty.
Peter knows he should just turn around and leave to prevent himself from making anything worse for himself but a part of being Peter Parker is throwing out witty zingers.
“I’ll walk with you to Josie’s Pete, I’m all finished up here and Sam threatened to make sure they are playing a Yankees game on the TV if I’m late again.” Steve grimaces.
“Huh?” Steve says shaking his head to bring his attention back to Peter. “Yeah, it’s one of my few talents,” he mumbles, a tone to his voice that Peter can’t quite identify.
Peter grabs at his bag, quickly obeying, so he doesn’t catch Mr Stark muttering something under his breath that sounds like “Not a bloody damsel and don’t need stupid Adonis handling my shit”. Peter instead dives into detail about the shots he had taken of a squirrel by the cafe this morning.
“Thank you for that Mr Stark but I better be going. I promised Steve I’d meet up with him for lunch so he could check in with me again. Plus I’m meant to be going to Josie’s with everyone tonight and I was hoping Steve would be able to give me some directions” Peter says
T’challa chuckles but shakes his head. “It wouldn’t be nearly as good if you two hadn’t helped me collect all these memories for the man.”
“Peter’s saying goodnight as he knows it’s time to get home to bed.” Steve grabs their attention and nudges Peter to send them a wave.
Tony’s phone goes off and the man pulls it out of his pocket, his features going soft when he sees the caller ID.
The pair watch as the camera captures the man opening up Steve’s laptop and typing away like it’s his own. Peter is startled. What on earth was the jackass up to now?
Making a run for it, Peter chucks Fisk a cheeky grin and then ducks into the elevator with Steve before the doors close, leaving the giant standing there getting red in the face as he fiddled with his pants.
“No, I’m not sure we can choose that. It’s too similar to September’s issue of Marvels.” Pepper stipulates.
“Ha fuck you ha!” Mr Stark replies mildly, rubbing his hands on his jeans. He opens his mouth to prod back at the blonde again but is cut off.
Luke looks like a rabbit in the headlights. His emotions going from offended to interested to superstitious to cycling back to offended again. Peter can tell he wants to avoid implying about his or Jones sex lives but is also struggling to deny her statement.
Peter knows he needs to stop the argument from going any further, so he slips into the office, coughing so the pair’s shouting falters.
He then points it straight back on Peter’s back to keep him moving forward towards the stage, the crowd desperately jumping out the way while making sounds of alarm.
“Okay, slow down. What’s going on?” Luke raising both his hands in the air as he spins around to give Peter his full attention.
“Nah babe” Sam counters “It’s time for his juice box. You know the kid gets cranky without his sugar.”
“Gimmeee.” Mr Stark, who appears from thin air, is crying as he barrels Steve over to snatch one of the cups.
“If Pepper wasn’t babysitting us, there is no way we would get anything done.” Steve's eyes sparkle a little.
“I actually didn’t know, but it makes sense now that I've seen it. You compliment each other. Steve slows Tony’s thoughts and settles him down and Tony loosens Steve up and prevents him from being too serious or fixated by work. It’s kinda adorable.” Luke dissects as he sips his beer.
“I guess, I never thought of that befor- ohhhhh that’s what Steve was talking about at coffee” Peter says as he starts piecing some of his and Steve’s conversation together.
Sam jumps to agree. “He is your responsibility after all. His bad choices are your bad choices.” slinging his arm over Steve’s shoulder to tease him.
It occurs to him as he hurries down the hall, that Sam and Bucky may have given Peter the dare but they never said anything against him having some help. Knowing exactly who he wants as an accomplice, Peter pulls out his phone to send a quick message.
“And I was suspicious as to why Tony felt he had to keep things from me” Steve adds “He was spending so much time with Jess and wouldn’t tell me why. Once he convinced me it wasn’t because of Fisk, I stupidly thought Tony wasn’t taking Fisk’s behaviour seriously enough and was going to condone that kind of conduct like his father had.”
“I’m sure it’s made it’s way around the company by this stage, not much point keeping it ourselves now.” Steve guesses.
and with that, he walks out the office, leaving Peter to look up at Mr Stark to see whether his face indicated if Peter had made a good impression or not. Mr Stark seems to read Peter's thoughts and gives him a small nod of approval, causing Peter’s feelings to start a little happy dance.
“If we could focus please.” Pepper demands, instantly gaining everyone in the room’s attention once more.
Once the ordeal is over with and the three tell everyone that it was a bit of a scare but they are alright, Peter berates himself for letting the situation get to a place where somebody almost got hurt.
Peter thinks that Steve is worried about nothing. Both of them seem to be having much too good a time to be talking about anything that could be disastrous for the company. Realising he isn’t going to be able to hear anything they are discussing without getting caught, Peter turns and follows Steve back to the office.
Peter cocks his head at the turn of conversation. What in earth would motivate Mr Stark to move there? Peter thought the man actively despised the place.
“What a stroke of luck that I would run into your pathetic ass out here. Couldn’t have planned it out better if I tried.” Fisk says with a seedy smile
Peter tries to flip him the bird. He’s pretty sure it ends up looking like a Star Trek’s Peace and Prosper hand gesture instead but it’s the intention that counts. Screw Logan.
“Pepper is right. Peter deserves a toast tonight as well.” Steve insists, raising a glass and the rest of the table follows suit.
“Dunno Luke. Knowing Clint he’d probably just want to know what your answer was.” Peter points out. Luke sighs, his hand making a motion to indicate his agreement.
“Let’s back off Peter a little” Pepper defends “From the way Jess tells it, Peter played a big part in helping expose Wilson in the end. Isn’t that right Jess?”
Peter looks at Luke and sees wide eyes staring back at him. Both of them coming to a conclusion on what had caused Rhodey to freak out. Peter feels an intense bout of second wave embarrassment for both the couple inside and Rhodey himself. It’s truly a mortifiying situation!
Peter lets out a quiet stunned breath at the gesture. Just like that, he understood something he hadn’t before. One more piece of that jigsaw puzzle, a piece he hadn’t known he was missing.
Bucky doesn’t falter “Especially since Stark is actually right this time. I know you don’t like to hear it but it really isn’t your job to help with Fisk’s responsibilities.”
Peeking around the corner, Peter watches Steve step closer to Stark so he is now looming over the short brunette. Considering the man at full height now looks immensely intimidating, Peter is quite impressed that Mr Stark doesn’t even flinch.
“WHAT?” Fisk exclaims. “I made it quite clear Tony that Vanessa’s gallery and the new exhibit was the direction the magazine needed this month.”
“Just saving you from saying something offensive. No need to thank me.” not looking away from Tony to acknowledge the jib properly.
So he ends up saying “Thanks for the pep talk Willie. I’ve always been a big fan of yours. Oh wait no, that was a different Wilson I once knew. Anyway always great spending quality time with you, like hanging out with a giant hunk of wood. By the way your fly has been down this entire conversation, which is really quite embarrassing for you!”
Peter wants to scream but his throat seems to be incapable of making any noise. Many other guest scream for him though.
Weird, Peter thinks. He thought Mr Stark wasn’t insecure about anything. Especially his love life, which is what Rhodey is talking about right now.
The table all groan or melt at the confession this time, Sam going as far as making dry retching noises.
“Only a crazy person would not think Pepper is pretty, Peter. I used to ask if I could draw her a lot actually. She has an amazing profile. That doesn’t explain your sudden obsession though.”
“And how are you going to gain our respect if you only bring coffee and tasty treats to just Stevie? Especially when the punk refuses to share with us.” Bucky counters.
Peter rubs his forehead a little, feeling a bit of a headache coming on. Luke and Jones are continuing the conversation, not noticing the disastrous revelation Peter has just had.
Steve makes a noise of complaint, swatting Clint’s hands away and trying to cover how embarrassed he is by all the attention.
The boss then looks back at Peter and tilts his head, indicating that it was time for the intern to go. Peter says his goodbyes, receiving friendly waves from the pair as he leaves the room.
Peter internally shrieks and runs away before he hears anymore. He may think Jess and Tony are a good couple but he didn’t need any of those images, thank you very much. Grabbing his phone, he types the beginning of a long update to Mj, finally ready to fill her in on one of the more hectic days of his life.
“Did nobody ever teach you manners you beast?” Steve asks exasperately, trying to smack Mr Stark’s limbs away. Instead of replying Stark makes a huge exaggerated sexual sounding noise of appreciation as he sips from the coffee cup he managed to snag, causing Steve’s face to screw up in disgust.
Luke unfortunately just moves his head aside, dodging it easily and causing it to hit Jones’ ear. Crap! Peter tries to put on his best I-Am-Innocent face and pretends to examine his nails as she looks up at him from her drink.
“Wow Stark, didn’t realise you’d miss me so much. Your father was right. You are getting soft.” Fisk yells, waving the gun a little to gain everyone’s attention.
“Excuse me, I need to call my girlfriend.” Peter makes a dash for the smoker's area. Not looking anyone in the eye as he passes.
Peter really has a bit of a reputation for being a terrible gift-giver. If you asked him it really wasn’t his fault. How was he meant to know that Aunt May had decided to go vegan that Christmas? Or that MJ’s mum had a hamster phobia? Yes, it is a real thing.
Peter remains seated and lets everyone file out the room before him. Once the majority have left, He sits back and takes everything in. Fisk had brought in an ugly kind of tension at the end of the meeting, but other than that it had been exactly the sort of exhilarating experience Peter had always imagined it would be. He grins silently to himself as he proceeds to finally follow after everyone else.
“Hey my love” Tony answers the phone, Peter’s presence all but forgotten “No, don’t start! We both said things we didn’t mean…….I know, I love you too. Yeah, we’re both exhausted but it’s finally over. We can make it up to each other another day sweetheart.”
So when Peter had then somehow gained enough attention from publisher and recent owner Tony Stark, THE Tony Stark himself, to be invited to sit in on meetings, boy, he may as well have actually died and gone to heaven.
Peter lets out a slow breath to stop himself from going on more of a tangent. Steve, who looks thoroughly unimpressed, is shooting Mr Stark a glance to make sure he didn’t hear any of Peter's spiel. He then sighs and puts his drink down in front of him, looking a little defeated.
Tony Stark assesses the mess in front of him before promptly diverting Fisk’s attention back into himself. His eyes only showing his alarm for a split second.
Luke looks at Clint aghast “You realise when you annoy Fisk the rest of us have to suffer the consequences? Fisk has surely reported you to HR by now. How do you still have your job?”
As Peter identifies that it’s Steve and Happy coming towards them, he cottons on to what Tony is doing.
Steve sends back a half smile “Good as new! My shoulder is all sown up and I should be able to come back to work soon.”
Everyone seems to get a little twitchy as a level of awkwardness fills the room. Steve is holding his eyes steadily on Mr Stark, refusing to back down much to Peter’s disbelief. So much for trying to help the stubborn blonde out. Peter can practically hear the tension vibrating between the two men in front of him.
“Steve’s probably just tagged along to keep Peter out of trouble” Bucky says throwing Peter a sidewards look, silently asking for progress on the challenge they'd set “Stands to reason when the guy always needs a babysitter to get any work done”
Luke has a weird expression as he observes the scene a few tables away. “Wow, he hasn't really stopped paying attention to Jessica since they got here. Maybe you are right, babe”
Peter leans back in his chair happily as he watches the coworkers he now considers his friends, commemorate the newly engaged couple.
“Here,” Luke says as he hands him a glass of water. “You’re meant to be a smart man, Peter Parker. Doesn’t take a genius to know that Clint’s actions are never actually what normal people define as help.”
Unable to help himself, Peter bursts out laughing. He had never seen the rivals really “compare sizes”, as people around the office have started calling it, before. Now that it’s happening in front of him, he can hardly believe how childish it looks from two grown-ass men.
Steve blinks a little at Peter “Yeah, I guess she is. Rhodey is usually the one to step in but l’ll admit, no one can do it quite as efficiently as Pepper. But that’s what makes her such a good boss, hey? We are all incredibly lucky to have her”
Peter sets himself an internal reminder to set that camera up at Steve’s desk this afternoon when the man was inevitably up with Pepper.
“Peter” Mr Stark says, chasing the intern out of his thoughts. “I’d like to introduce you to T’challa, head of Panther Corp. A very important person who you should meet to network with because you are great and networking helps with success and things.” Mr Stark says offhandedly, clearly expecting T’challa to take the lead in this meeting.
Steve stares at Tony like he’s losing his mind “We are about to have a rather large disagreement, I hate to argue this with you sweetheart but it’s something I feel I have to stand firm in.” He then lifts Tony’s hand to place a kiss on the brunette’s knuckle, stopping the boss’s argument in it’s tracks.
As the noise comes from the end of the gun everything in the room kind of slows down. Peter, having had all the wind knocked out of him, reaches out towards his boss. He knows there is nothing he can do from the floor, but desperately needs to prevent what is about to happen. Tony’s body flinches up and a look of surprise morphs into horror when he realises what Fisk has done.
On Wednesday, when Peter tries to rig up the elevator to trap Steve and Pepper in together for the morning, he realises there is such a thing as too desperate.
“… You are either an alien or the oddest person I’ve met in a while. I did not follow a word of that”
Peter whines. He can’t believe she remembers that. What was his teenage self thinking, trusting her with such embarrassing knowledge.
Steve hums a little in reply but doesn’t change his gaze. Feeling ignored, Peter follows over to what has Steve all spaced out, curious as to what has the man's attention. He finds that the view is just a group of Sam, Bucky and Mr Stark joking about something and laughing. Peter frowns in confusion. The sight of Mr Stark almost on the floor, cackling at Sam and Bucky goofing off is amusing but hardly stare worthy, so why is Steve looking over at the scene like a man possessed?
“I am not a sore loser Peter. You two are cheaters!” Clint yells pointing between Peter and Luke furiously.
Tony goes to repeat himself but Rhodey covers the brunette’s mouth with his hands. Steve gives the pair a suspicious look before turning away.
Peter rubs his head hoping it’ll help sooth it. “I’m swearing off whisky forever. How big of an idiot did I make of myself last night?”
“Noooooo. You need to help me. It’s your job as my superiorrrr.” Peter babbles on, not sure what he’s saying but hoping that it’s working. He can see Luke laughing behind his hand so Peter sends him a betrayed scowl.
Peter sulks. See if he confides in Luke again now that he knows Luke is the worst secret keeper ever!
“Remind me next time to avoid help from Clint” Peter coughs out, trying to push the sandy-haired man away.
Peter watches as Clint tries to kick the PR manager, Jessica’s, chair out from underneath her for a fourth time and holds his breathe for the potential disaster. He continues to watch Clint’s pout grow larger as Jess proves she has eyes in the back of her head by avoiding his ploy without even acknowledging that the prankster is even there.
Bucky, having had enough of his friend’s behaviour, comes over to Steve’s desk to confront him while Peter is nearby fiddling with the settings of the camera he plans to set up to catch Jones.
Not entirely believing Steve, Peter scurries away after giving the blonde’s word a half hearted acknowledgement. All he wants to do is just spend the rest of the day curled up by his laptop, licking his wounds.
“Secret satanic skills, remember arachnid?” Clint preens. Oh yes, Jones is definitely got some payback heading her way.
“Jess. May I say in the most PC way possible, especially because of this rumour I’ve been recently informed of but-” Tony starts.
“I don’t understand. There’s no rule against work place relationships at Marvels and I doubt anyone would have objected.”
Peter turns the sketch around to show Luke. The large man whistles as his eyes look over the drawing.
Fuck, Peter shakes his hands in the air to clear up Steve’s misunderstanding. He should have known Steve would have a possessive streak “No. No. Don’t worry, no obsession. Just an observation. I swear. Happily in a relationship and not looking to change that.”
“Um wow. Thanks” The tightness in Peter’s chest loosens slightly from the praise. Tchalla grins in return.
“Blackmail” Clint wonders off to the bar smugly, not looking in the least sorry, all while humming Wrecking Ball to himself.
They continue to bicker and Jess slowly turns back to Peter with an expectant look on her face. Peter feels like he is missing something here but he can’t even begin to imagine what it might be.
“Hey Hey. No abusing my boyfriend.” Jones cuts in playfully. “I don’t care if you’ve been learning all Marvel’s trade secrets from Steve, Parker. You aren’t that special.”
Pepper squeezes Steve’s arm excitedly “Making a calendar was such a good idea, Steve. T’challa’s present is going to be better than mine!”
“You take on twice the workload of Sam or any of the others in the department. You stay late and work hours of overtime. Logan says you are sometimes even here on weekends. I saw you at the meeting this morning. You clearly love being in the centre of developing stories and helping shape each month's issue. Why has, if not Mr Stark, at least Pepper not recognised that. You deserve to work in a position that allows you to be more a part of that process.”
Peter mentally kicks himself. Steve and Tony just seemed to be finding some common ground and this could cause them to go right back where they started. Steve must have a big problem with the idea of Jess and Tony together. This might even make a larger rift than before. Peter decides he better try and convince Steve that this will be a good thing for the company.
“I couldn’t give a rats ass about helping out Wilson!” Steve bites out “I was only trying to help Tony, the ungrateful bastard! Do you know how much work he has piled up on him at the moment? He doesn’t need Wilson slowing him down any further.”
Of course, Peter’s calmed down significantly around the boss now and upon hearing Mr Stark’s “Hmmm…. Oooh, Minion! One of those boring meetings is happening! Come be my scribe and that means I can sit on my phone and not have to pay attention. Maybe Pepper won't even throw her shoe at me this time." this morning, Peter handled it with much more maturity than he would have been when he first began working here. Just a quick panic attack in the bathroom this time, nothing major.
Peter’s gaze drifts a little to catch Steve struggling to keep a straight face at the bosses behaviour. Whether the blonde is trying not to crack a smile or whether he may be about to blow a fuse Peter can’t really tell however.
“Pepper did your email say today that you are organising Mr Stark’s Birthday Bash?” Peter smiles up at the couple and T’challa, trying to appear as casual as possible.
Peter feels a sinking sense of dread. Working at Marvels is his dream job. And he has been bending over backward for Fisk these last couple of weeks, he couldn’t believe the man still didn’t see the value of Peter’s work. This isn’t fair.
Wilson Fisk, the Artistic Manager, sends Luke a sharp look but opts to leave the comment aside so he can begin his usual list of demands.
Peter feels his eyebrows rising higher as Sam’s spiel goes on. “Geez, no pressure or anything. Been reading too many sappy romance novellas, Sam?” he taunts.
“Like that is news to any of us.” Pepper says slyly as she moves off to talk to some other important people trying to catch her attention.
“Isn’t that enough now Tony? No need to keep shoving this mystery admirer in my face. No wonder the word insufferable gets thrown around so much when describing you” Steve flick the boss an annoyed glance.
Once Steve agrees, Peter then goes on to ask why don’t they invite Pepper to join? She’s working late nights lately and deserves a night off. He lays it out for Steve as innocently as possible and is so impressed with his acting skills that he thinks MJ’s talent must be rubbing off on him. Steve must agree with Peter’s fibs because he fires off a text with the invitation.
“Ahhh speak of the devil and he shall appear” Luke, says, his mocking barely disguised behind its neutral tone. Peter is not alone in his complaints about the jerk that runs their department.
“Sure, do that and it’s yours.” Luke jumps up trying to run over to Jones to boast about his purchase but he stumbles slightly. Watching how tipsy Luke is brings Peter to the realisation that the room was spinning a little bit for him as well. It felt nice and he let out a giggle that bubbled up from his stomach.
Rhodey just makes a noise of disgust in reply. The man turns to go, pauses and then turns back again, shaking his head exasperatedly “Clint needs to see you about some outfits he wants to be showcased. I’d finish up quickly.” still yelling to the couple through the door.
“Peter! Thank you so much for getting this fella to arrive on time for once.” Sam teases Steve with a grin. “How on earth did you pry him from that work station he calls home?”
“I like helping out” Steve shrugs, sweeping up the crumbs from his doughnut into a napkin. “Fisk made it clear to Tony and Pepper at the beginning of this year that he is a busy man and I have the time so I may as well help them with his stuff. If that means I do a little more than a picture editor needs to, I don’t mind.”
Good save Rhodes. Peter relaxes internally and sips some of his drink, once again reminding himself to pace tonight. He doesn’t want another repeat of his behaviour at the bar a fortnight ago.
Peter gets to the door but hesitates as he’s leaving, wanting to ask but knowing it was none of his business. He stands there willing his hand to turn the handle but his curiosity gets the better of him.
“Hey! Nobody gets to talk about my crazy talented newly stated Editor-in-Chief that way” Tony states while batting at her arm a little. “You’ve had a ton on your plate over the last year or so Pep. That’s why we had T’challa around remember! So you didn’t have to handle this promotion transition by yourself and I was still able to put all my focus on the problem called Wilson Fisk. Definitely no time to unravel any of my love life along with all that.”
The other man in the room, that Peter hasn’t identified, sighs deeply “Stark, don’t be dramatic. I just need to know which one of these rings you like.”
“I’ve had better days” Stark comments, seeing right through Peter’s front. “HR won’t pursue Fisk’s report. I wasn’t inclined to believe a lot of the insinuations the forms had made anyway but now anything he’s reported on is being reviewed as corporate espionage anyway so your internship isn’t going anywhere.”
Peter lets out a deep breath he hadn’t known he was holding, feeling relieved. “Thanks Mr Stark. I’m sorry to have caused any trouble. I shouldn’t have riled the man up the way I always was though. That was childish of me.”
Once both Peter and Stark have calmed down, the boss offers to take the muffins up to Pepper himself while Steve stays and consoles Peter, assuring him that mistakes like this happen.
Bucky makes a sound of disbelief. “Steve is wayyy too good a guy to get someone fired because they meddle a little with his love life, Small fry. Plus Logan’s right! It’ll be good for him to get back out there.”
“No need to despair everyone. The party has finally arrived” Mr Stark calls, making his presence known to the rest of the group.
Peter remembers back to the day with the drawing and shudders, searching for any reason to divert the conversation. His eyes fall on Steve, who isn’t looking as flustered as Peter had assumed he’d be, more specifically it falls on his hands.
Luke’s been with Marvels for a couple of years now and had taken on the task of helping Peter feel comfortable in his first couple of days. Once spending a bit of time together, Peter and Luke quickly discovered that they get along like a house on fire. Regardless of the outcome of the internship, Peter knows he’s made one new lasting connection.
Clint has him wearing dark blue velvet pants and a white shirt that is objectively a lot tighter than the ones Steve usually wears. What tops off the outfit though is the over-sized winter coat with big brass buttons that is hanging off Steve’s shoulder, the navy colour bringing out Steve’s blue eyes.
Dammit. Peter wants to shut his eyes but can’t look away. His head screaming for somebody to do something. Anything. The entire ballroom gasp together in unison.
“It’s an insult that the Stark’s let Fisk have that job over Steve. Steve has been working here just as long, works ten times harder, and yet he still has never once received any recognition. I know Mr Stark Sr. showed blatant favouritism to Fisk but Tony is a lot smarter than his dad. It’s a crime that he hasn’t done anything about it.” Clint rants, voice rising louder than he probably intended.
Jones shrugs “Maybe. More likely he’s just worried that if the relationship doesn’t work out it could damage the working environment within the company. Steve is always thinking about Marvels and putting it's priorities first.”
Peter was going to have to make sure he paced himself. He tended to get rather affectionate the more he drank and he didn’t want to make an idiot of himself in front of his employer. Not that Peter has ever really needed help when it came to coming across as an idiot.
“Rogers, don’t look at me like that! It is completely within my right to fire whoever doesn't please me and I know this may come as a surprise but I'm a very petty person.” Mr Stark says.
“I was running late so Happy offered to take me in” Steve says, distracted by another text message pinging.
“Oh yeah, I saw him put the ring in his pocket just a moment ago. He’s surely going to ask the question tonight!”
Clint replies airily. “I know, this has got to be some of my best work. I even shock myself sometimes.”
Peter feels his phone go off and his heart warms a little when he sees it’s from his girlfriend MJ. She is overseas currently working on her next movie and didn’t have a lot of spare time to keep in contact at the moment. While proud of her, he misses her like a lost limb and treasures any moment she has to message him.
“Yeah, cut Stark a break Stevie.” Bucky elbows the blonde in the side “Just because you walk the straight and narrow doesn’t mean the rest of us have to.”
“What’s that Sam? I can take whatever I want because you think I’m just awesome? Thanks, you are a pal!” Steve says drily.
Luke, one of the journalists who had been listening to Peter and Clint’s whispers, turns and gives Peter a look of sympathy. “Don’t take it to heart. Fisk doesn’t like anyone.” Peter sends the man a grateful look back, knowing he has found an unexpected ally in Luke.
“Thanks but there’s no need to go easy on me. This is the fourth or fifth time this week I’ve managed to hurt someone unintentionally.”
Mr Stark lets out a humourless laugh “So I can hear you once again tell me your SoMeTiMeS YoU JuSt HaVe To GrAb ThE BuLl By ThE HoRnS speech?”
“It’s been a big day but it worked out in the end. Of course, you now have to admit that I was right.” The boss now smiling widely. “Don’t pull that you weren’t actually worried shtick? Why else would you be so exhausted then?…….. I’m sorry did you seriously say BECAUSE OF THE MAN THAT KEPT YOU UP LAST NIGHT? Oh, I sure didn’t hear you complaining when we wer-“
“Hey! No. Pete that had nothing to do with you. We shouldn’t have kept this quiet as long as we did. That was all our own hang ups.” Tony reassures “I was keeping details about the situation to myself because I didn’t want extra stress on Steve’s shoulders. Then when he kept pushing to be more involved, I got all insecure and thought he didn’t trust me to be able to handle everything myself, like how my father never had. See nothing to do with you.”
“Please, I’m sure Apple Pie here isn’t all goodie two shoes and sunshine. He must have his secrets.” Mr Stark challenges, quirking an eyebrow “Come on. Tell everyone something that can finally cause a scandal about YOU. Marvel’s scarily detailed rumour mill needs something extra special for the end of the week.”
Peter twitches, knowing he may have gone too far. Why is he unable to keep to keep his big mouth shut? He resists putting his face in his hands as he waits for Steve to say something.
Now Peter has been known to be an idiot from time to time. But he is also a smart man and he knows a losing battle when he sees one. “You’re on your own lover boy”
“Enough that you’ll receive some light-hearted ribbing. Nowhere near the scale of some nights Barton has really let himself lose. Your career is safe for now.”
Steve blinks at Peter in incomprehension but Peter continues. “It would be just the thing to make up for your argument today don’t you think? Plus, would be a way of extending an olive branch out to Mr Stark.” He smiles wider, hoping his expression comes off as endearing instead of manic.
Steve is always hanging back to help out with all of the tasks Pepper needs Mr Stark to do. He’s always commenting on how lucky the company is to have Pepper and Mr Stark and is complimenting the pair. He spends more time than necessary with the future Editor in Chief and Peter knows from lunch today that it isn’t because the man is looking for a promotion. Steve even said today he is usually on top of all the comings and goings of Marvels. Pepper and Steve must chat about the company in all of their free time. It’s so obvious that Peter kind of wants to slap himself for not realising it before.
“Sooooo… what are we all planning on getting Stark?” Sam hastily tries, hoping to fill the empty conversation.
Steve wraps himself around the brunette and Tony’s whole body slumps, like he’s been let out like a balloon. He turns back to the blonde slightly and tucks a strand of blonde hair behind his ear.
Peter waves Clint off. “No. I think that ship may have sailed.” He turns over to Sam and Bucky and resigns himself to his fate, dramatically bringing the back of his hand to his forehead “You are right. Your boy is a hopeless case. Do your worst.”
“Look, I know you think it’s too soon but Tony has worked so hard the last couple weeks Steve.” Peter babbles as encouragingly as he can. “Don’t you think that if someone makes him happy that he should be able to have them there by his side.”
“Shit, Jess. Oh no, I’ve spoiled it. I didn’t know you were there. Please don’t tell Tony! Forget everything I said about a ring okay? Forget I even said anything at all! You didn’t hear a word from me.”Peter spills out as quickly as he can, not allowing himself to even take a breath.
The conversation continues but Peter is falling down a deeper, darker hole as the mental puzzle is drawing to completion.
“But somehow you were the only one who ended up bleeding out on the floor.” Tony scolds, already back over by Steve’s side and taking his hand.
The job didn’t seem as impossible as these two were making it out to be. Steve is an extremely handsome man with a bundle of positive qualities. Women were swooning over the blonde behind his back left, right and centre. The biggest challenge would probably be finding someone STEVE was interested in.
“So T’challa is here again. I know we are basing next months issue on his company but I don’t remember him being around this much last time we wrote an expose on him.” Clint speculates.
He’d had a chance earlier to sneak over to Steve’s desk to look for clues but the only thing that gave him any sort of hints was an old photo frame on Steve’s desk. In it was a picture of a petite blonde woman with stricking eyes and soft smile with a younger Steve kissing the blonde on the cheek. He’d never seen a person able to photograph with such fierce determination before and if this was the kind of woman Steve was attracted to then Peter was in for a rough search.
Peter whines a little. It’s a good thing MJ is overseas at the moment because there would be no way she’d be letting him come home with this much whisky in his system. He looks over at Mr Stark to see him still arguing with Steve before leaning in closer to Jess.
There, Peter thinks to himself, that came across as modest, grateful and was also very much the truth. He could do this whole corporate world charade.
“And she’s STUNNING right? Like crazy beautiful. Pretty much a perfect person.” Peter officially needs to die. Right now. Or at least have someone take the alcohol away from him because he clearly can no longer make good life choices.
“I guess you can keep that one Rogers. Don’t say I’ve never done anything nice for you” Mr Stark says, the gleam still in his eye.
Luke sends Clint a glower at his back “He can be such an ass. When he sobers up tomorrow I’m going to tell him he proposed a threesome. That’ll teach him.”
Steve stifles a laugh and smugly replies “While I’m flattered Queens, you’re a little on the young side and I don’t think your girlfriend would approve.”
However, as Peter finishes with the focus, he spots that Steve left his sketchbook open on the desk. Peter wouldn’t usually go snooping but he was pretty sure the sketch was of him.
Regardless, decision made. Steve definitely needs Peter's help so it’s time to put a plan in action. Operation trick Pepper and Steve into being the power couple of the century is a go!
“You cannot call the interns Minions, Tony.” Pepper lays out “You have sat through the seminars, so please start behaving appropriately.”
It’s been weeks since the Fisk incident occurred and Marvels has settled back into a routine. The group, especially Bucky, Sam, Clint and Pepper had all scolded Steve and Tony for lying to them for months and then had immediately moved on to teasing and congratulating the couple on how adorable they were together. Once Steve finally revealed the ring, the group insisted they have to have a night at Josie’s to celebrate.
“He’ll be alright. You just coddle the young man here.” Tony voice softens, losing the sharpness of the argument.
Peter stares at Tony because the remark is dripping with intent. He wants to fade into the wall, feeling like he is now invading in on a private moment.
“You all seriously think Tony would trust anyone other than Pepper with being in charge of this magazine?” Jess chastises but most of the group don’t look discouraged. “Numbskulls”
Clint hands Peter his drink sympathetically “Here drink this. Helps with all the issues under the sun.”
Out of the corner of his eye, he notices Tony patting his pants carefully. The patting becomes more frantic as the boss’s eyes widen in panic.
“Aww shucks. All in a days work.” Rhodey snorts “Next time I’m keeping it. It’s definitely Carol’s taste.”
A chorus of yells came from that comment. Clearly they all agreed with Peter in thinking that Steve was a little bit of a lunatic for that move.
Peter watches Luke’s eyes cross as if it will help him think through the alcohol clouding his brain. Peter isn’t sure whether he is seriously considering Mr Stark’s proposal but- “I’ll give you a dollar.” Ah, not seriously then.
Peter’s pretty puzzled by all the silent conversations occurring but he also figures he hasn’t worked here long enough for any of it to be any of his business yet. Surely after working together for years, being able to communicate silently probably becomes quite normal. It might be complete instinct and they don’t even realise they are doing it anymore.
“Oh good!” Clint exclaims when Peter comes in his eye line “One final get Steve’s-head-out-of-his-ass team meeting?”
Leg’s failing him, Peter finds himself sprawled on the ground and the letter that was in his hand sliding under the door to Mr Stark’s office.
“Okay, I’m slightly impressed, also slightly terrified.” Peter admits “But Steve does hate how often his pens go missing. He'd be so grateful to the person who found his culprit” Peter voice trails off slightly so that Jones can catch his implications.
“He’s right, Stark. Whoever this is for should love any of these rings. Maybe if you told me who they were-” says a deep melodic voice Peter knows he hasn’t heard before.
“Steve, I have so much to sort out right now. I really don’t need you yelling at me as well.” Tony sounds drained, clearly overwhelmed with the HR mess Fisk and Peter are about to cause.
Peter nods his head furiously and watches with interest as Steve’s face flushes a little and his smile goes all warm.
Peter turns back to the pair to find them both looking extremely irritated with one another. Their argument seems to have escalated from silly TV opinions to something a lot more serious, unfortunately.
Peter has been having a great time so far chatting with his coworkers, thankful to being able to enjoy the evening with everyone. Over the course of the last couple hours people have been coming up to him with a compliment for helping out with the situation with Fisk which is a little staggering. It’s been a good night overall even if every now and then Peter has silently mourned the fact that he didn’t manage to get Steve a date for the party.
“Nah. From what I understand it’s mostly Peter grilling Steve on his lack of love life” Luke says casually as Peter winces.
Steve smiles coldly “Of course not. However, I’ve found I have some spare time currently so I would be happy to help lighten your load by looking over it for you.”
“Pepper, I treat you like the glue of this company. You are my golden goose. Why do you do nothing but call me names? The betrayal!”
Luke nudges Peter in front of him. “Go on now, while the coast is clear. Get it done before Jess and Tony finish up sucking each others faces off.”
Pieces of a jigsaw puzzle Peter didn’t even realise he’d been trying to solve start flying together at a rapid pace. Almost faster than his brain can keep up with.
