“I went through the breakup with Pepper alone every time, and it sucked. I don’t want you to go through that.” Tony turned to smile at him. “The last time was even worse because I was barely talking to anybody, and Rhody took Pepper’s side. He said I was a jackass for thinking she cheated on me."
Mission Control is Tony’s nickname for Ned a.k.a. Peter’s best friend. No I am not letting him read these messages, yet. I am concerned they will eventually become pornographic again.
Anthony: That would be good because I think you probably should leave a day or two earlier than planned. Ross isn’t going to be here until the last day so maybe you can stay out of his way. When are you going to get here?
“That is true. Okay, we are definitely doing the rest of these questions later.” Tony already felt exhausted. “Maybe we can do the next batch on the ride home?”
Tony: That works except it will be probably early Thursday morning your time. I have a bunch of long meetings that day. I hate having to actually do my day job.
Steve: I know that now, but I didn’t at the time. We have our own issues to work through that are completely different from our other timeline counterparts.
It will be explained during the course of this conversation, but Tony has changed his address book designation for Steve again. Steve will now be referred to as HSBF, which stands for Hot Sexy Boyfriend. He wanted to actually put that in his address book, but Agent May said no.
I went to high school with somebody who now owns Alias Investigations. I’ll see if she’s willing to take the case.
CoulsonPJ: You cannot strangle the consultant, especially because he’s now on your team, May. I told you this when you were with him in Appalachia.
D Fitzsimmons: No, because I mysteriously find notes on projects that I am working on from Stark all the time. Although, in this case, I might've gone looking for them on his personal server. I wouldn't have been able to get in if he didn't want me to read them.
Anthony: So I heard that Clint had to tranquilize you twice to keep you from visiting. I'm flattered that it requires tranquilizers to keep you away from me although breaking peoples jaws is not cool.
I’m over it. You probably shouldn’t try to date your grandmother’s ex-boyfriend, even if biologically, he is almost the same age as you. Especially if he doesn’t bother to call or text message you for two years. Maybe you weren’t the only one trying to forget. I don’t remember if I mentioned before that I’m really bad at dealing with death.
“If she’s okay with that, then I am. I know she’s planning to come tonight. If you could please change the sheets in the room, that would be lovely.”
As I mentioned earlier, I'm going to be staying someplace safe with Ms. Melinda for a little while so I won’t be coming home right away. Don’t worry, it will be fun. She doesn’t frown all the time. Okay mostly I want to find out what she did with Mister Rogers when they were special friends.
Just because I'm dating someone else doesn't mean that I'm not going to hang out with you. I take my pseudo-parenting thing very seriously. I would like to think of it as a big brother mentor sort of thing, but Laura pointed out that would be creepy since I think I’m just a year or two younger than your aunt.
Me: Of course I’m observant. To the point where I know that your gear has been upgraded. Somebody definitely put your energy shield up to 11 and it wasn’t me. I assume the smartest woman you’ve ever met would like to keep you safe.
Also, even though I'm the boss, apparently we have an all-hands at 2 PM. This means I am still not going to get to spend any quality time with my Fiancé yet. I’ve barely managed to get any kissing in.
May: I’m sure you were just being polite when you woke up wrapped around him like a security blanket. We’ve shared a bed for almost five years, and you never wake up curled around me.
Anthony love: We’re not entirely sure how Friday from 2023 managed to send the data through with our visitor, but it’s probably going to be useful. At a minimum, it’s going to be less annoying than Deke, the future SI chief creative officer. Other Tony must still be drinking.
Morgan’s dad: Get Laura back home. I don’t think any of us intended for this to become a time kidnapping.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You're so lovely. We are still in the "bad choices were made" timeline.
Tony: He was a hero. His evidence helped us catch a bad guy or at least that’s the story that should be going around school. That should make him cool.
"You’ll keep an eye on Tony for me? I’m worried about him and what Ross could do to them." Steve asked.
Tony Potts: Instead of going to you, I went to Pepper, and well at least we got back together, and we have Morgan, and it's okay.
“I’m now supposed to tell you what I like about you. I’m also supposed to be honest about it and say things I wouldn’t say to a complete stranger.” Steve explained.
This conversation takes place a few hours after the last one. During that time Steve has made his first public appearance as Tony Stark’s boyfriend, Stefan Carter. The Internet is buzzing.
“The Captain even though he doesn’t want us to call him that anymore. You should tell Coulson the truth before it’s too late.”  She glared at him, wondering how he even knew about her conversation with Steve. Then again, he did make the phone she was using. But maybe there was a darker reason for his words.
Tony: Every other day. It’s exhausting. They have such a ridiculous concept of mental illness. It’s enough to make me not want to take my medication but then if I don’t take the medication, I will become what they say I am and I’m not giving them the satisfaction. I don’t want to be reckless and hurt people, so I need to stay on my treatment plan.
“I will let you say anybody because I would just love to have dinner with Bucky and Sam again.” Tony could pick up the sadness in Steve’s voice.
Blue phone: You really have to stop being jealous of Sharon. I’m here talking to you right now. I would never tell her half of this stuff.
Maybe in a world where my boyfriend didn’t call me your name in bed, we would’ve been able to fix things. Happy is still trying, but I love myself too much to stay with somebody who is in love with someone else.
Me: Be glad I’m up late working while you’re probably having your early morning run. It still technically September 15 for another 20 minutes.
Nomad: Clint told me. Although that doesn’t automatically mean that they’ll assume I was her boyfriend.
Red phone: I don’t even think dad knew your private life. Did you know that he had a ridiculous crush on you? I’m pretty sure it wasn’t 100% hero worship. Although, I don’t want to think about that because it’s just weird.
Steve: I don't know. We don't exactly have a lot of the Pym particles. Deke tried to reverse engineer the particles, but I’m not sure how far he got.
"Which has me nervous enough to wish that I could drink wine for something other than the taste." Steve said, pointing to the glass of wine on the table from lunch.
“Personally, I want to see if he could make one of the suits flaming. Imagine what he could do with the Hulk buster. My scientific mind is all a flutter.” Tony sounded so happy when he spoke that Steve couldn’t help but smile. Of course, at that moment a teenager popped into the room. From the pictures from earlier,
So why did the timeline change in 1955? Were there time travel shenanigans involved? If so, who was it? How did the diversions in the timeline bring us to where we are now? You’re just going to have to keep reading to find out.
MayMQ: After he unsuccessfully tracked us down after the fall, and his reputation for bombing first and asking questions later. Also, how did he figure the thing out with Stefan? He thought his own wife was Hydra.
This question is hard because my biological family is gone, not that it was a very big to begin with, not counting my dad’s second secret family. But my mom always made me feel like I was the most important thing in her world. Maybe I was. I always felt loved. And when she died, it hurt so much. It wasn’t sudden like what happened to your mom. She was sick for a while. It’s just I didn’t expect to lose her. I mean I was the sickly one. I was the one who was supposed to drop dead at any minute, not her. I wasn’t prepared for it.
“I am detecting that you are crying now. Would you like me to put on soothing music?” Karen asked moments after Steve left.
"I thought we already established that Natasha would be the one to kill you if you did stupid things to Steve." Sam remarked as he sat down on the couch. Tony joined him.
Me: We are on our way back to the States now. So my adventures in DC will began as soon as I touch down.
Chief Mechanic: I want to tell him myself when we arrive tomorrow or rather later today at this point. Although I'm sure he just read all of this over your shoulder because I would totally be doing that with Stevie bear.
Me: OK, this is going to sound really embarrassing and a little creepy but you were my first crush and how I figured out I was gay, or rather bisexual.
“I’m scared of losing Morgan too,” Tony confessed. “It’s why I said no the first time when you asked. I didn’t even consider that there was a way to bring everybody back but not lose what we’ve gained.”
“The real person not the act that he puts on for everyone. And by this point I realize that 90% of his behavior is a performance.”
T Stark: Finally, because I’m in the green room I don’t necessarily want the producer who asked me to autograph her daughter’s plush of me to hear this.
The boss: We should still work on doing what we can here. I want to do an all-hands meeting tomorrow with everybody.
Inside image: Steve kissing Tony in new uniform (all black and gray. Think the Patriot’s uniform on Agents of Shield without fake muscles). Notice the lack of patch. Tony left that blank in case Steve ever wanted to come back.
Cousin Q: Shit! Tony will not be happy. Yes, that's why we need the address. Can you please start a counter rumor about that just being an Asgardian thing?
OK, now I’m going to be brave and see if I can move onto some of the next questions in set three which apparently is supposed to be where the real intimacy begins. Which makes sense for perfect strangers but we’re not that now. Also, I kind of wish we didn’t meet in the middle of a crisis so we could’ve done some icebreaker activities, you know, instead of trying to beat the shit out of each other due to Asgardian mind Fuck. I really wish it did not take Agent dying for our sins for us to get our shit together.
“You guys are so married. Sometimes you finish each other sentences. You’re worse than Fitzsimmons. And Natasha is not my girlfriend. We are work colleagues.” Daisy argued. "Besides, you're going to need me to deal with Loki. Do you remember he killed our boss that one time? Sorry, my boss, since both of you work for Pepper now."
We've talked some. It was bound to happen. Loki is the only person here that I sort of know. Not about New York, but the other things like how I ended up on team Coulson and how Loki found out he was adopted.
“I have to make things better. I arrived literally a day too late to save Lincoln but Vijay is still here.” At his words, various pieces of the puzzle clicked together in Jemma's mind.
"Nice subject change, gumdrop. No. Seriously they should’ve seen this coming. We handed them out a press packet like days ago. See, now I wish I really did bring Coulson as my date to that dinner last month." Tony pouted.
Melinda: I wasn’t there when Loki stabbed Phil through the heart, but I was there six years later when he died for the second time from his injuries. You can’t change the past. If it was possible, we wouldn’t have Deke.
Anthony: I wish I made different choices so you would be here with me, but I don’t wish Pepper was back. I’m going to blame that on the therapy and the good drugs.
Me: She's not mad at you, per se, she's concerned. I think she might be a little mad at me, but that’s a Tony problem.
Friday: You did take a few of his T-shirts and are currently using them to sleep in. The images have been sent to your Nomad account.
Anyway, I’m safe as honey bear probably reassured you. But I just wanted to tell you that myself. I just needed to take a few days to decompress. Stefan got shot, twice. However, I didn’t get a scratch mostly because I’m pretty sure he got in a way of a bullet at least once for me. I kind of just needed to hold him for a while. I may have been extra clingy. I hate close calls.
“You were so distracting last night that I forgot to mention that the doctors think that James will be ready for visitors by late December. That could be your Christmas present. Since I feel like it’s too early for an engagement ring.” Oh, look, another wedding joke.
Steve almost seemed relieved that we know about Thanos and are actively preparing to defeat him as a team. Of course, I don’t know if the preparations we’ve made will make any difference because nobody will answer my questions about what happened here, and I’ve asked everyone. No one answers.
Anthony: But really wonderful sketches. Yo-Yo agrees. Which explains why she told me to check the roses first.
Here we are at the epilogue, which is the longest chapter in this story, at nearly 6000 words. This is going to be a little different than previous sections because it is going to cover multiple days and people. The tags are going to be your friends.
Me: You know what, I’m not even going to dance around this anymore. He’s in love with you and I think you at least like him back, otherwise you wouldn’t be worrying over this so much. You definitely wouldn’t keep in contact with him as much.
BITC: Benji told me some of that earlier. Along with telling me that I shouldn’t be jealous of his relationship with Flash because it was different. I just realized Benji used relationship and not friendship. So that means something, doesn’t it?
Anthony: It was a good suggestion. Hate like that will get you killed eventually. I only survive Siberia by your grace.
Red phone: Kids do love you and they need their own personal superhero. When this is all over, I'll pay for it.
Nomad: Mostly. Cookies were involved. And therapy. We may have smacked each other with something that looks like a giant Q-tip.
HSBF: You’ve done a lot of important and good things. I don’t think your legacy is going to be just murder bots and the Merchant of Death.
Me: She did mention what happened with Friday. Although, I think your presidential meeting hadn’t happened yet. What happened with the president?
Me: Because I love you and you were going off the deep end. Or at least I thought you were. I had to protect you by whatever means necessary and I made some very questionable choices like getting a teenager involved and only telling him that you were crazy and not everything else going on.
“You weren’t supposed to bring her back to 2023.” She hears May chastise the not her husband, who might be her husband in the future. Because apparently, she really is in the future. Maybe they were divorced because there’s no way she would allow Clint to have that hair if they were still married.
Tony: Yes but I say less stupid stuff when I write it down. However, I am willing to forgo my normal safety net if I can see your face daily. Not just us texting every few days but we can talk daily.
Thank you to everyone who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all absolutely wonderful. This section of SHIELD IMs begins almost after May leaves Steve’s room. Therefore, this still takes place before Tony and Steve make their debut. I finally get to do a May Coulson section. They’re my favorite after Tony and Steve. May and Coulson are also my last chance of getting something canon. This will probably end in tears, mostly mine. Thankfully, there is fanfic where we can make everything fluffy-ish.
Person my boss is in love with: Actually, I think you should tell Tony first, if it is what I think it is. I don’t want to make the same mistake as last time. Just make sure that Rhodey and Laura are there.
T Stark: I think it‘s best that I waited two hours so we could have a semi-civil conversation. Also, by the time you left voicemail number two where you threatened to cut off my genitals, I was in a limo with my ex-girlfriend and her boyfriend.
“Not all the time, occasionally she draws the opposite. Robin drew a picture of the two of us being old and just hanging out on the couch just last week. I mentioned it before, but I didn’t give you details.”
Purple Princess: Look, we managed to make an inner dimensional communication device overnight. I’m currently modifying it to see if we can pick up a signal to where Daisy is. At least we know what part of the galaxy she is in now.
Thank you to everyone who read or reviewed the last chapter. The encouragement is always appreciated. I love your kudos as well.
Director Snookums: That's good because I don't want you hanging out with her owner. Seriously, what did I do to have to babysit two mad scientists?
Tony: I don’t want to lose what I have now if you and Ms. May-Rogers somehow magically turn back the clock five years. Morgan is my everything.
TMNS: MJ is very worried. We all are. Daisy is off-planet, and there’s no way for us to get in contact with her.
Tony: You realize I am really bad at articulating things. Like really bad. Like Siberia happened bad.
Last time I cried by myself, outside of this writing process, was on the way back to the safe house after you left the hotel room. You leaving was hard, even though I know being together was only temporary. Still hurt watching you leave. Last time I cried in front of someone else was when you almost died. I was a mess. There’s a reason why I was tranquilized.
Venom: Congratulations, you made her cry. The reason why all of us are at the Lighthouse is Daisy is missing.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last chapter. I am totally appreciating the irony of this turning out to be conversation 13. Originally it was conversation, 11, but somehow it got moved to 13 because Tony and Steve have so much to talk about. I’m hoping to return to shorter chapters soon.
"Hey, I didn’t mean to wake you up. I just wanted to steal a kiss before heading into the shower. I’m all sweaty again from you so I figure I should try to be dressed before May or Yo-Yo show up. You can go back to sleep.” Tony said as he started to scoot off the bed.
The new consultant: You know you're better off without them. If it makes you feel better, apparently, I'm also part of the 50% along with my mom and cousin. Although my dad apparently went on to remarry and have another kid.
Purple Princess: It's never too early or late for a Stark to get pizza in any of the five boroughs. I'll take care of it. The usual order will be waiting for you when you get to MJ's apartment and maybe a cheesecake. Cheesecake seems necessary.
I believe he is telling the truth, for multiple reasons, including the fact that I have been exchanging scientific notes with him since I was 11, after being introduced to him by Dr. Weaver. The doctor is a daughter of Wakanda and she vouched for him. In addition, Dr. Leopold has passed multiple polygraphs. Furthermore, his genetic tissue shows signs of being in long term cryo-stasis. Also, his genetic structure is slightly different than that of the Leopold Fitz from this timeline (for the sake of simplicity, I will be referring to him as Dr. Fitz). This is in line with information from NASA’s twin study, which is currently in progress.
Me: OK, bonus points for you figuring out the subterfuge thing. I kind of love you a little bit more for that answer. Although maybe we’re going to have to come up with a different name for your best friend.
Purple Princess: Actually, it is secure. Dad owns the entire building, and it’s mostly ATCU agents with the occasional SI employee for flavor. We also put in the princess’s soundproof technology.
“They ended up next-door neighbors in Wakanda, and they connected. They are actually engaged, but they’re waiting until after other us tied the knot. I will let you read Friday’s relationship breakdown on the way home tomorrow. Maybe after we take the kids to breakfast?” Tony asked.
SimmonsJA: Surveillance observations according to the notes in the file. Coulson had Daisy delete all Avenger -related data from the Internet. Some of that slipped out, but most of it was contained. We saved it to another server for research purposes. Now that we’ve encountered a large number enhanced individuals recently, it’s been quite helpful.
"Of course, sir. Do you want me to tell her what is actually happening or the public consumption version?” Ana asked.
Me: Yes. I can’t wait until you get to meet her. She is just incredible. And a little scary. I adore her. I can see where there are little bits of Friday in her personality but Afia is definitely her own person. She wants to be a superhero.
Tony Potts: I think this is at least part three. Part two would've been after the purple one beat the fuck out of us. We didn’t truly talk again after that until I got an invitation to his wedding.
“I’m not the head of the Avengers, Natasha is. Melinda is the director of Shield, though. This might be why she was able to get into the phone, and she gave me permission to keep looking. I assume things are different where you are?”
The Mechanic: If TMNS would’ve been younger like five, you would’ve been told right away. As long as we were sure you would not endanger him. But he’s not a little kid. He’s a 15-year-old who should have some autonomy. He wasn’t ready for you to find out and this wasn’t my secret to tell. Being dragged out of the closet is not fun. I was trying to keep him safe until he was ready to tell you, but you can’t wrap 15-year-olds in bubble wrap.
“See, I told you she was evil, I’m so glad her daughter is not at Midtown,” Tony remarked just as hologram Steve disappeared probably to stop a kidnapping. However, before he could talk to May about what was going on, he received a text message from Laura.
CoulsonPJ: Federal custody. Laura felt it best to take the kid and run. We were able to extract him before Happy arrived with the regular authorities. I stayed behind with Fitz to deal with the authorities.
After some recent comments I decided to explicitly state I am #team they’re both wrong and need to talk to each other like grown-ups. That’s kind of the point of this story.
Me: I did not almost die. Although, I was expecting a call or at least a message from you since Yo-Yo passed this phone to me before leaving for a late dinner with her boyfriend.
This was a double bonus for me because I needed to re-watch the movie to work on two special top-secret Star Trek projects. These projects will probably not see the light of day until September. I hate moving.
Red phone: Seriously, don't eat any fish or take fish oil. Who knows what that stuff could do to someone who already has powers.
I would use your real name, but I’m not there yet. Laura accepts that. I don’t know if I will ever be there which is why I’m leaving my therapy retreat before there’s any chance that I could run into you.
DILF: Simmons didn’t believe that we could get the stones; at least not without help. So, she used a piece of the monolith and the Pym particles to send Deke to retrieve her Fitz. At least we think that’s what she did. She’s not confirming anything
Me: You’re not on North American soil. Or anywhere else Shield has carte blanche to get enhanced persons to sign the Accords. Seriously, the worst thing you’re doing is taking out members of various groups that like to traffic young women in various African countries. Nomad is getting very popular with the UN.
Cuddle fiancé: She also told Nat that you would give her an update on Daisy when we got there. Nat is worried because she hasn’t heard from Daisy since she left for operation Quake Loki.
Although the release of the sex tape was embarrassing, it was more humiliating and there is a difference. OK, it was hurtful because that was supposed to be a private moment with somebody who said that he loved me. Instead, the guy was an asshole who cared about nothing but himself and God I wish I’d never slept with him. It was definitely one of my worst decisions and I made murder bots.
Red phone: Yes. Apparently, it's really disrespectful to send dirty texts to my new boyfriend when I'm supposed to be listening to my ex-girlfriend. Even if said ex-girlfriend is happy that I’m allegedly moving on.
“How did that happen? You’re married to a spy. She should really keep her personal photos better protected.” Tony is not jealous of Steve sexing May. “Also, do you really need to be sexing your wife?" Okay, maybe he was a little jealous.
Me: I’m sure it was the strudel. I wish you could be in Malta too, especially today. How are you holding up?
“Given the choice of anyone in the world, who would you want to have as a dinner guest?” Steve read off the question.
HSBF: Understandable. Why have agents Davis and Piper come with you? They’re not here to arrest me on your best friend’s behalf?
Tony:  I miss the sound of your voice so much that I’m almost considering designing a screen reading program that uses your voice to read me these text messages.
“The source was correct and he was being essentially held captive by his sister. We walked in on her verbally and physically abusing his chrysalis. Don’t worry, he’s safe and under the observations of Dr. Suarez.” Leo exhaled in relief.
Me: At least you left the safety of my nephew in the hands of someone qualified. It still doesn’t answer my question of why you didn’t tell me? Or Laura for that matter. I have a feeling that she knows.
“The situation with Ross was a bit more volatile at that point compared to here. That Mr. Stark refused to announce Spidey’s identity. His penance was to do these questions as part of a profile for the New York Times. However, after reading your responses, Jane felt it was inappropriate and scrapped the idea." The AI responded.
Venom: I managed not to spill that fact. I don’t think I’m you’re number one fan. There’s this woman in Hoboken who wants to have your baby. She has three Spider-Man tattoos. One of which is on her inner thigh. Those pictures made me 100% sure I’m gay.
Please feel free to contact me or my assistant, Elaina Rodriguez, with whatever time works for you to see Peter’s work. I’m sure you already have her number.
Nomad: Seen it. One of the characters kind of looks a lot like you. Well, like pictures of you from your MIT years.
This conversation takes place the morning after the one before Tony’s time on October 13. Steve is at least 6 hours ahead of Tony most of the time.
Me: Anonymous fanfiction account. Although, do not read any of the Captain America fanfiction that he wrote before your defrosting. Most of them are self-insert, although if you’re Coulson, I guess that’s okay. If you didn't know him, you would think that he was making this stuff up.
Me: I’m not having text message sex with you until you can guarantee that the NSA is not reading these messages or anyone else for that matter.
Anthony: Parents always know when something is not quite right. Jarvis did at least. I’m just hoping I’m in another country when it all falls apart.
I’m trying to decide if they are more upset about me being with the boyfriend at the wedding or the Watchdog assassination attempt. The stocks only fell for like 30 seconds. I don’t care. Have the lawyers ready. Can you try to get it moved to Monday or Tuesday? Seriously, this is just like a nuisance.
“Honestly, I’m more interested in knowing how they moved past Siberia at all. How did that Tony forgive me?” That part was whispered, but Laura still heard Steve.
Hunter: Everyone is one occasionally. But I mean in general. Are you upset that he chose to move and build a life for himself in the other timeline?
Red phone: Our own country was drugging and putting powered people in stasis before they came up with their floating prison
CoulsonPJ: Furious, but he understands why I stayed away especially when Simmons told him about getting kidnapped by Hydra. At least my godfather privileges have not been revoked.
This is the longest conversation in this story. Actually, the last conversation was originally part of this, but it was already getting ridiculously long. Therefore, I moved the actual question part of the conversation to the next day. Yet the final version still went over 3000 words. (Also poor Tony. He’s typing most of these text messages by hand during this conversation because he’s not alone.) They really just had a lot to say to each other. Steve and Tony really are working on this emotional intimacy thing.
D: When did you have time to read through that? I haven’t even had time to read anything that came from the other timeline, even though Ann sent me a pre-brief a few hours ago. I’ve managed to get through about a page of the highlights.
The Mechanic: The Spiders and Ms. Marvel? I’m sure the Purple Arrow children were kept safe from the Watchdog attacks mostly because they’re not in the database at all.
FRIDAY’s break up playlist: Water Runs Dry by Boyz II Men https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N9opF-PK5k
“Other suggestions? Because I feel like we need to take the Band-Aid approach here. You want to rebuild your new relationship with this version of your BFF right?”
Me: I hope so too. I remember what happened after Pearl Harbor. I’m still ashamed of the internment camps.
These notes are at the end because I didn’t want to give anything away. This chapter is an adaptation of the first part of Thor Ragnarok but with 100% more Quake.
I’m not really ready to meet your boyfriend yet. I’m not sure he is ready to meet with me either due to our history, despite the apology basket. Alcohol would probably need to be involved and I don’t think I can drink. And I’ve been told that he shouldn’t. Again, mostly by the Princess. How does she know so much?
United States Secretary of State. Former head of the political science department at Cutler University. Her father is originally from Wakanda but chose to stay in the United States after receiving his doctorate due to falling in love with one Aerial Rice and adopted her family name after marriage. Rice was unaware of her heritage until the recent diplomatic visit.
Tony Potts: You don't have to be sorry. You didn't know that I didn't know. This is a different timeline, so maybe you assumed that I still found out by some other means?
“I don’t think so. Not without a Loki’s scepter-like situation being involved. I definitely don’t think we’re going to come to blows over the right or wrong way to squeeze toothpastes. I like to think were past that.”
Virginia: I will ask Jennifer from legal if she has any recommendations. Don’t worry, I’ll pay for it.
The Mechanic: Hey, platypus. I heard that the Avengers and the ATCU were responsible for dealing with the Watchdog terrorist attack. And now the media and the public completely adores us. I figured you would have use that as the perfect time to re-launch Shield or at least that’s what Mister PR would’ve suggested.
Me: He read the letter to me in an effort to get me to calm down, sometime around angry voicemail eight. You could’ve called earlier.
Happy Bear: Natalie pointed out that Siberia wasn’t like my childhood, that Stefan was trying to keep you from doing something much worse. I just wish he didn’t have to resort to violence.
“That was so much easier than being in a car and trying to talk to you. I don't even think I would even try if I didn't know…" Tony trailed off, not sure what to say next.
“That still doesn’t excuse the fact that you lied to me. I think I have the right to know that I was sleeping next to a complete stranger,” Simmons practically yelled.
Double exclamation points. Okay, you are obviously pissed at me for not responding. I really should’ve checked the mechanic account earlier. And you were right about me being preoccupied with Steve, but you’ve seen him shirtless. Oh wait, it’s probably in bad taste for me to make comments like that especially after the shitty ex-boyfriend. I’m trying not to be a dick. I hope Yo-Yo has time to haunt his house. I want her to make him miserable.
Me: Director Snookums is not happy because his people figured it out first, but they’re not public yet so it would just cause problems. They’re also a spy organization. So this sort of thing is FBI jurisdiction, probably. Yo-yo was on the ferry though to assist.
Tony: It became a pre-dinner meeting which is why I am being forcibly ushered out of here now that this meeting is over, instead of continuing to text message you.
“Friday mute. I know it’s been a while, but we’re adding massage, especially ones with happy endings, to the list of activities that you’re not supposed to listen to.” Which is probably why Tony did something that he hasn’t done since MIT.
The Mechanic: No. I hope not anyway, but I am a futurist. I always prepare for multiple outcomes. Child services in Manhattan alone is already working on three cases of preteens kicked out by their parents because their children developed powers due to the fish contamination. One was found with a broken arm and leg because they “accidentally” walked into a “wall” six times before she was removed to safety.
“But our principal is former Shield and the grandson of a Howling Commando. Lying won’t work." Afia pointed out, and her cousin nodded behind her in agreement.
“23 times, including caressing his thigh four times.” At Friday’s response, Tony was profoundly regretting giving Laura Friday privileges again.
Anthony: Since I mentioned Weird Al earlier, is UHF on your list? It's a weird cult classic from the 80s.
Red phone: The fact that you’re acknowledging my Howard issues just warms my heart. However, Agent Scary is glaring at me so I have to go.
Venom: Well, that would be because the three cheerleaders were my beard, and I’m actually gay. Not that anybody knew that at the time.
Tony: Which is understandable. Ross will be gone soon but some of the names being whispered about are not good. Someone mentioned Norman Osborn as a possible successor if POTUS gets a second term.
Okay, sorry again for not calling. I’m planning to have Friday completely integrated into the property before I leave. Though we both know that is no excuse because I do know how to use a normal cell phone. I even use the flip phone while drunk. That’s how I started speaking to Stefan again, actually. Although apparently I forget to take them to the beach with me which is why I’m a little tardy replying to this email.
Anthony: I wasn’t in the suit. I was drawing with Lily Bear and taking advantage of my excellent Wi-Fi. I’m going to email you something to give to her dad.
Purple arrow 2018: I’m sorry. I’m sorry I left. I am sorry that I left you there alone. I’m really sorry that you accidentally got kidnapped by some other version of me. He is another version of me?
I think your handler may have passed this information on to you, but I thought you would appreciate an actual email. I'm not lying this time. I'm doing better. Dr. Simmons is taking care of me. Remember her from when she did your assessment a couple of weeks ago? I'm being well looked after.
Counselor Laura: Yet occasionally, some moments tell me you are the same people deep down. My Tony also confessed about the poster as well as Howard walking in on him.
Me: Personally, a lifelong public servant definitely screams All-American to me. What's more American than a tiny woman of Asian ancestry that can kick all your asses? We are a nation made of many. It's who we are.
Number Unknown: This is your ex-girlfriend's niece. I just want to let you know that your boyfriend is perfectly fine, despite what tabloids are reporting.
Me: The Bulletproof Pacifist says that the transition is going well and Benji only misses Yo-Yo a little bit.
Monkey lover 2: Or maybe there is some merit to the multi-verse theory and I’m in a different dimension altogether. We never did find Ian Quinn in my original timeline.
“I hate to interrupt but Dr Suarez asked me to remind you that you need to fill out her required questionnaire before engaging in any heavy sexual activities?” Friday interrupted.
"I support Steve's relationship with you now, but I would like to know how it fell apart before." Tony sighed, realizing that he was going to have to give Sam's something.
Agent L. Barton: I get that impression. We need to come up with a timeline of when he got the stones. I’m worried he might have some already. But he won’t be as powerful as he was in Wakanda.
Me: By the way she’s not drawing that anymore, at least not since a couple of hours ago. Which I guess lines up with destroying AIDA. I kind of want to know what that means.
“Yes,” Tony said as Pepper nodded her head in agreement. “That’s how spider mom found out he had superpowers. If your child disappears right in front of you, that’s an obvious sign something is really wrong. Rio reached out to Davis because he worked with her husband before and because the Davises have to stick together.”
Me: And it’s more likely he will move up here because the private tutoring for Spidey Junior is the best. They’ve been trying to get him into a charter school since pre-K and this is better. Spidey Dad can just work out of the New York ATCU office once his undercover stint is over.
“Agreed. For the next one, we are supposed to figure out a way to complete the sentence I wish I had someone whom I could share…” Steve explained.
“Okay, we will continue. The next one might be easier. We need to name three things we have in common.” Tony snorted at that.
However, the execution was flawed. Very flawed. Ask the Princess to tell you about the Mumbai incident. Or what happened in New York, DC, London, or LA the day before the US presidential elections. Certain flaws of the Accords were fully on display, and people ended up dead. No one with powers, but some innocent bystanders because that’s what happens when you unleash an EMP on a major city in a society where everything runs on electricity.
Blue phone: I never hated you. I've told you repeatedly that I never hated you. I think it just took me a little too long to see that there's about four different Tony Starks. I think only the one I'm talking to now is real. This guy I like.
Venom: Maybe. Also, you were scared and 14. I bet you just got your powers before it happened. You need to get over your martyrdom complex, Benji.
Tony? Is that you. Also, Star Trek was right about meeting yourself not causing a world-ending paradox. Leo and Fitz are like brothers. They hang out with each other all the time.
FRIDAY: Also, because Agent May respects you, she is helping Sir keep the ATCU from uncovering any information that can lead them to your whereabouts as long as you do not become a threat to yourself or others.
Anthony: He was voluntarily forced to resign. Totally different. This happens every time there’s a new administration. It’s normal unless the new guy realizes it’s ridiculous.
Me: Yep. She told him that she was pissed at Stark for him stealing her boyfriend and wanted to get back at him. They believed her until the Cavalry literally showed up.
Stephen C: I know that. And I’m not that worried about it. I think Siberia was our Bahrain and we’re working through it. Also, there is no best friend I’m secretly in love with in a romantic way.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last chapter. You are all absolutely lovely. In celebration of homecoming being available for digital download, therefore giving me the ability to look at scenes again and not go by memory, you are getting an update today.
Me: Principle Morita is pissed off that I “bought” my way into the school. He believes my only redeeming qualities so far is that I want the science lab I’m paying for named after Bruce and not myself. I would give another donation, but I don't think that's going to win me any points.
Tony: Also, he was the one who showed me the tabloid reports about the implosion of Pepper’s latest relationship. He’s equally pissed about that.
Anthony: Not really. But if I don’t say something to you, than I have to work on this in therapy and I’d rather talk to you.
Me: By tricking them into replacing me with my perfect choice without them realizing it. Friday, Jane will release the press release regarding my daughter Afia. The Wakanda embassy will collaborate.
Tony: People say hindsight is 20/20. If we could go back and do it all over again, we would make different choices. Of course, we probably would make all new mistakes.
BITC: Noted. I’ll apologize the next time you’re in class because Flash already told me you’re not coming to school tomorrow.
“Because you would be the one who would put them up,” Steve remarked. “You would turn the wedding into a Fourth of July party even if it was taking place at Christmas.”
Anthony: But we're not out. At least you’re not. This is another reason why I'm mad because Rhodey said no to being my date next week.
“Yes. Am I allowed to say one of your good qualities is your ass? I regret that wasn’t the body part that  ended up on Instagram.” He loves that ass.
PS: Apparently your efforts with the cookies were futile. There’s a giant box from your aunt sitting in my foyer. Could you send me her email address so I can send her a thank you email?
Anthony: I’m so happy that you acknowledge that. I realize I shouldn’t be angry because people deal with grief differently, but I still am even if Michelle understood and wasn’t even that upset with Sharon for not being there.
Hunter: I realize that, but I still want one. Is it weird being jealous of your other self even though you're currently sleeping with his new husband’s widow? Although I guess widow isn’t the right word anymore.
Red Malibu: I’m just trying to do the right thing. It doesn’t always turn out the way I intended it to.
“Very hard, and it's worse now seeing the happy version of her," Deke told the group. "I'm not even mad at Bobo because if you find yourself in a strange time, you survive by whatever means necessary. I just don’t need to see that survival right now.”
Me: I think that might be good, even if you’re okay now. You complain about me getting shot a lot but you’re also constantly in danger. And you have pre-existing conditions. You’re also as good about ignoring them as I was before the serum. Now I understand why mom was always worried.
Me: I don’t know if they actually got married but yes. And it’s because you’re a good person and a hopeless romantic at heart.
Anthony: That actor is one of the busiest guys in modern show business. Personally, I think the guy is really an LMD that Patches planted to keep everyone off his trail.
May: I feel like the first is going to be easier. You’re probably not aware of this, but the European countries got hit very hard and opened up immigration to help rebuild. If we bring everyone back, they may kick those people out.
Me: Anyway, that pissed her off, which resulted in her saying that since I was a genius, I could just learn Spanish. Then I replied in perfect Spanish that I was already fluent and it wasn’t much of a problem because SI does a lot of business in Latin America and Spain.
Me: Wonderful subject change. Do you count it as poisoning if whoever did it intentionally switched out the oil that they fried the pita bread for the appetizer with to something that would make your target swell up like a balloon?
Agent 13: But he's breathing on his own. They expect him to be up in the next few hours and I'm sure he will be texting you as soon as your ex-girlfriend gives him back his cell phone.
The new consultant: Heat of the moment. I’ve known since the inauguration. It was just too coincidental that Spider-Man showed up in DC again at the same time Benji was there.
Nomad: It was Clint's idea. Maybe Ross will be less likely to set traps for me if he thinks Stefan Carter is a real person. Also I feel like you deserve roses and chocolate.
"Then you wouldn't be able to afford multiple suites at a five-star hotel and all day spa service." Natasha remarked.
“We screwed up so badly in Siberia that it led to us fucking up with the purple one,” Tony added. “We really, really regret the Siberia fuck up along with not taking time to fix it then because maybe if we fixed it, then we wouldn’t be dealing with the mess we have now.”
TMNS: We’re friends, and [Redacted] can barely take that. I like MJ. I just don’t want him to be with a dick. He deserves more than that.
Girl Friday: Although silver lining, Flash finally knows. You have no idea how nice it is not to be keeping that secret anymore.
“OK, point. We can’t just snap our fingers and undo everything. We are going to have to plan that part. I’ll add it to my problem-solving list.” He will because Steve was right. They can’t just bring half of the universe back. It would be just as chaotic as when they left.
Me: Probably more than one. Mission Control and the princess genius have bonded. They’re probably best friends now, so he’s probably helping her read these things.
Agent M: Your children are fine. They’re with my protégé. They are staying at the Playground for a while. Hopefully we will be done with this mess before school starts.
Me: Enough that he’ll walk away and cut off all ties to them. Personally, I’m surprised he didn’t go the ‘faking your death’ route.
Continuity note: Remember when I said I would explain how this story diverges from the main timeline in 1955. Some of that explanation will happen in this chapter. This chapter contains heavy spoilers for the first half of AOS season seven, especially episode 7.4. I’m just glad that the show has aired on Disney+ in the UK by this point. It is also on Netflix in the US.
Me: However, I’m not worried about Ross. I am worried about him, but not about him locking me up on his super secret floating prison.
Anthony: And we will get there, but I want us to at least get to the two week mark before then. Also, I’m not lying about therapy. Yo-yo’s glaring at me right now. She’s threatening to take my phone.
“Or they are just not openly hostile, which is still significantly better than Happy was five hours ago. Wanda’s family, now that’s a whole another category of complicated,” Tony remarked.
“There are Mozzarella, pesto, and prosciutto sandwiches in the kitchen area. However, I believe you should wait until after the 2 PM meeting to contact Agent Carter Junior. There will be pertinent information revealed at that briefing that you will need to pass on to her.” Ana told him.
Me: Yes, but only for like a minute. I love when we land at Reagan. We’re probably going to be at the house in 10 minutes.
Cuddle fiancé: Because that’s the only way May would be married to someone else now. How did he die?
Cuddle Bunny: Do most of your sessions with Laura happen in your lab or when you’re working on the armor?
Additional notes: Since this story is so ridiculously long I would just like to remind everyone that the Bulletproof Pacifists is Joey Gutierrez. He’s an inhuman from season three of Agents of Shield and our first acknowledged as gay in canon character with powers. He tried to ask Tony out for “coffee” when they train together earlier in the story, but Tony turned him down because he is head over feet in love with Steve.
“They’re not sure, but my James is having them come back to HQ for quarantine and a few brain scans as a precaution. Actually, they’re already on their way back and should be landing any moment. Yo-Yo said she would text me an update in the morning our time. If exposed, they should be reacting by that point. It took none of the others more than 24 hours to show symptoms, most did so immediately.”
Image 5: Steve’s drawling of a nude Tony spread out before him on Tony’s luxurious bed with Steve perched over him with a half torn shirt and a smile.
Tony: Yes. Same thing on the anniversary of Ana’s death. You don’t want to know the stuff I read in the diaries. Howard was dealing with a lot of ghosts and drank them all away. I don’t want to be that.
This chapter was originally going to end with meeting up with the last one and seeing events from the 2018 perspective. However, I decided that the brother-sister conversation needed its own chapter. So we will meet up with the bad timeline in the next chapter. Besides, remember time is relative in the story.
Counselor Laura: Are you saying that this Clint could be an alien imposter like the “Ian Quinn” that turned out to be an alien imposter?
Tony: Actually let’s twist that around and tell the other what we think they would change. Then we can see if that person is right.
Anthony: No, Happy got Pepper an engagement ring, because he’s always been a full-service driver/chief of security. Thanks to therapy, I am aware I should get the ring back and do something constructive with it or at least tell him to get a new one to carry around that’s in men’s sizes.
Flaming head is Tony‘s nickname for Robbie Reyes, a.k.a. Ghost Rider II. In this universe, he is a member of Steve’s Secret Avengers.
CoulsonPJ: I'm going to hurt your driver. I may even kill him. Possibly with a paperclip. You will never find the body.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last chapter. This is another one of those very long overdue chapters. This is also the last chapter that will be posted before Spider-Man homecoming comes out. The plan is for some elements to be incorporated, but I won’t know exactly what until I see the movie even though the Internet is already a spoiler minefield. I’ve already given up on avoiding spoilers, but I’m going to try to keep my spaces spoiler free or at least so mixed up with things from my imagination that you won’t be able to tell.
Melinda: No, we’re trying to make new futures, but all the mistakes we made that led us here are still there, and they must be dealt with. Texting Tony is your first step.
HSBF: However, there are some things you don't want to know about your friend’s sex life even though you know the messages are fake.
Captain Tight Pants: Don’t you think anything with Captain would be too obvious? Cuddle bunny would be better.
Me: I know we need to put out a press release, but I can’t bring myself to do it yet. There’s been a version of it sitting in my email for months. I just haven’t been ready to sign off on it because as soon as I do, that means it’s over.
Me: Of course he’s not telling her the truth. Neither one of you is a bloody idiot. How do you tell your girlfriend that a version of yourself that’s already travelled to the future once managed to get thrown back in time when a bomb blew up three of the rocks that eat people?
Counselor Laura: Someday, we're going to have to have a conversation about that, but I'm more curious about Morgan's existence.
Thank you to everybody who left comments for the story. Thank you to everybody who left kudos or added the story to your favorites or alerts. All of you have kept me happy and writing.
If I really think about it, this thing you have with Stefan has been building for a while. He was all you would talk about. Granted, most of the time you were cursing his name, but I think I was just trying to cover up the truth. It makes sense. Maybe it can work better than you and me because he gets the part of your life that I didn’t or maybe I couldn’t completely understand. Maybe a part of me is glad you’re going to know what it’s like to be constantly scared that you lose the one you love.
Football Hunter: Look at the pretty picture of me in my suit. You get to strip it off of me tomorrow.
Karen: I can confirm that the seismic activity in Los Angeles is caused by Eli Morrow. He is currently violating the law of conservation of matter or at least attempting to.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all fabulous. So here we are, the last chapter of our story, excluding the epilogue.
“There’s a difference between biting your tongue when your friend dates somebody that you don’t like that much than trusting that guy to keep you alive during a superhero battle. I don’t know they’re  for ready for the latter.
“I know you’re right about that after a good seven years of reflecting on the horrible choices of Siberia.” Once his doctor got him on the good drugs. “Mistakes were made on all sides.”
“Thank you. You don’t have to worry about me. I’m okay, just a little sad Karen. I just really miss my boyfriend even though he’s been gone two minutes and probably hasn’t even flown away yet,” Tony lamented to the AI.
Clint’s strange behavior from earlier began to make sense. Of course, he would act like that if she was essentially dead.
May: Apparently, that picture she drew last week of you and Tony waking up in bed together came true. Pepper sent pictures. You look happy. I think that’s the most peaceful you’ve looked in the morning since we were neighbors in DC.
“Sorry, my aunt texted, and I had to respond. Tony convinced her to relocate to the Malta compound for a while.”
Me: That was probably the alcohol from my post ‘the Hydra assassin in my building didn’t kill me’ binge. I haven't been drunk for the last 2 ½ months.
I’m sure that makes everything a little easier. Also, congratulations on Platypus deciding to keep you guys in the shadows. I know you were wary about Shield becoming public again and now you don’t have to worry about that. Rebuilding of public image is hard. I’m still the Merchant of Death after nearly a decade of not selling weapons. The murder bot fiasco didn’t exactly make that any better.
Tony: But I would have a whole entire new R&D department. Mandatory play time with FitzSimmons. That could be worth it.
Tony: Yes, but at least she hasn't blown anything up yet. I may have taken out the Dean's car at MIT when I was her age. And a lab, more than once.
Purple Princess: Actually, Leo did. He’s pretty wealthy. He made a lot of money in the stock market outside of SI.
Me: Blame Jarvis, the original. Hey, I have to go sweetie pie. The board is calling, and I have to deal with them. You know it’s a bad sign when I’m looking forward to dealing with Congress instead. You know I hate Congress even though Senator hateful and the Hydra guy are gone.
Steve May-Rogers is referred to as DILF in Tony’s address book. You may continue speculating about the actual state of Tony and Pepper’s relationship. Tell me your speculation in the comments.
CoulsonPJ: Of the original lineup anyway. I think Yo-Yo only has eyes for her turtle man. I caught them flirting via the new communication system that Fitz created based on what Stark did for the Avenger burn phones. I’m kind of glad the rest of Shield, as well is the director, will not have access to these conversations.
Red phone: I’m sure you dealt with it better than I did. Building JARVIS was one of my better coping strategies. The others led to the reason why a ‘Tony Stark gay sex tape’ actually exists. I made so many bad decisions.
Me: At least this time I was distracted by less sleazy things like saving the world and not the obviously augmented chest of whatever stripper Obadiah lines up for the party plane. This is starting to become a really unhealthy pattern.
Avengers Friday: I do not know who Ana and Afia are. Mr. Stark left the Avengers for health reasons after being stranded in space for 21 days with limited resources aggravated his heart condition. Therefore, he is not healthy enough to continue being Ironman. Although he occasionally serves as a consultant and babysits Robin when Steve and May need to both go on a mission together especially now that Kamala is at Vision Academy.
Blue phone: I realize that the guy I left behind wasn’t who you grew up with. You never met my Howard and I never met yours. But, if you need to talk about it, I’m willing to listen.
Tony: Not mine to tell. Agent May is also coming with her boyfriend, but the kids have to stay at the base. Other May will also be there with Spidey senior.
Agent Laura: Maybe. At least we know there’s a potential timeline where we bring dusted Fitz back, and you will need a place for Wanda to live. To get to that better reality, we have to find the stones in my timeline and bring them here.
The new consultant: You really should. I’m now glad I’m a Jones instead of a Johnson, cool superhero cousin non-withstanding.
FRIDAY: Statistically speaking, there is a 98.2% probability Hydra would have assassinated Howard Stark by other means if the Winter Soldier was not at their disposal. Journal entries recovered from Siberia indicate that the Winter Soldier was purposely chosen due to his previous affiliation with Howard. Sir is aware of that and is trying to make peace with the circumstances of his parents’ murder.
So, I will reveal now that most of the events of Black Widow also happened in this timeline. The main events of the movie also occurred before the timeline split. However, the scene that took place two weeks later only occurred in one of the timelines. You’ll find out which one later. Also, the Avengers were out by the time that scene took place, but Natasha didn’t know. Team Coulson already helped to get them out without them knowing. That’s one big difference between the two timelines in this series and the sacred timeline.
Me: But you said no because you had to go visit cancer patients at the children's wings of various hospitals.
In honor of Black Panther coming out today (for previews anyway), you are getting an update today. Since this is the last chapter that will be posted before the movie comes out. I just want to remind everybody to not mention anything spoiler heavy in your comments until at least March 16. I will know Saturday how much Black Panther takes this story out the continuity. (Me being busy watching the movie Saturday morning is the other reason you're getting this now.)
Anthony love: Or that you and I are barely on speaking terms and only talk about our kids. BTW, your other self allegedly married May and adopted Ms. Marvel, after her whole family got dusted by Thanos.
Counselor Laura: Good because you have some notes to write about everything you know regarding what Simmons did. I need to get back to my kids, and I need your help.
Me: I just wish he would show back up for the dedication. Besides, it’s better this way. I prefer that any child of mine goes to public school for socialization reasons, if nothing else. I feel bad about Spidey Junior, Ms. Marvel, and the purple arrow children having to work with the tutors, but it’s for the best and at least they can socialize with each other right now.
“We didn’t either until about a year ago. I just want to know what’s going on with my cousin. Can you help with that?” MJ asked.
Also, it beats spending more time with the sober and not chronically depressed version of Nana. You know the version my mom told me about that I never knew. I got stuck with the one mourning a guy who's not dead who decided to shack up with Hunter, Hunter.
Director Snookums: Tracking bracelet. Agent Rodriguez is still required to wear one until we can convince the UN oversight committee that is a really dumb idea.
Friday:@WHiHOfficial_JWest either someone is overcompensating for their tiny dick or jealous that V Potts has the career you wish you had.
Red phone: I’m only getting death glare 2 right now. So it’s fine. Pepper only gets really mad at me when I piss off the board or stare at my assistant’s ass a little too long.
Turtle man is Agent Mack McKenzie, Yo-Yo’s boyfriend. For those of you that do not watch Agents of Shield, and boy are you missing out on some good stuff, Turbo is Mack’s nickname for Agent Fitz. Just like Tony, Mack gives everybody a nickname.
Me: Although Happy is still mad at us, but he agreed to hand over the ring to be sold and the proceeds donated to My Sister’s Place in your mother’s name, anonymously of course.
Monkey lover 2: I didn’t want him to live through getting stabbed in the back by another father figure. Or be tempted to make the same mistakes I did. It was better that I was the one there.
Tony: When you’re rich and have a sex tape, people do some crazy things to get your attention. Finding naked strangers in my bedroom was kind of a thing during the 90s and early 2000‘s. I’ve put that piece of code into Jarvis and it carried over to Friday. I probably should modify it to people who tried to attack me. It might be more useful now.
HSBF: Nothing can be as bad as the Captain America radio hour. Thank God they used a fake name for Peggy.
The new consultant: It’s hard to sleep when you’re worried about one of the family members you like. You and Benji were called into an Avenger meeting. You’re never called into an Avenger meeting unless the situation is bad or involves our high school. You’re both on-call only numbers. We’re not in the middle of an apocalypse? Your dad did make an apocalypse joke.
Melinda: I will consider the offer. I’m looking for a divorce attorney. I think Steve’s head will stay in his ass until we are actually divorced.
“It’s the hair. The blonde thing is a little hard to get used to. Although, I guess one of us needs to be a blonde since you’ve graduated to auburn.” She joked.
“Probably, but all of those things made Stark take a good hard look at his life and make better choices and that includes being with Steve.”
Me: He is okay with us trying to do a less than platonic relationship, but he is worried because my track record is god-awful. Although you still could end up with a shovel talk due to the Siberia incident, but I’m not sure.
“I like” love “you, so I made peace with that.” He’s forgiven Howard for that because he doesn’t want to think of a world without Steve.
FRIDAY: I thought you did not want to know what was in the file, most likely because you’re afraid that the Winter Soldier is responsible for the death of someone else Sir cared about.
Anthony: The Ross problem has been handled or at least mitigated without resulting in bloodshed, mostly because General Glenn Talbot hates Ross as much as the rest of us do and decided to use bringing Shield under government control to undercut the Bastard. The Army Air Force rivalry has worked out in my favor in this case.
Me: Also, apparently, I’m only allowed to do coffee with Cuddle Bunny. Not that I’m going to get any Cuddle Bunny coffee anytime soon because if there’s one thing Congress is good at, it’s cock blocking.
Regardless Tony and Pepper love that kid, but Pepper tells me things. So, I know not everything is how it seems in the media. We spent a lot of time together because she's one of my friends. If anybody understands dealing with an alcoholic parent, it's her. We talk a lot, and that situation is complicated. So complicated.
: Preferred term of endearment for Captain Rogers. No longer being used due to the fact it may be known to Secretary Ross and or the NSA. Stark is currently cycling through multiple terms of endearment, mostly related to food. There are too many to include here. Friday has confirmed that he is cycling through an actual list but refuses to turn this list over to me.
Steve: Or me and May could take the kids back to Brooklyn and let you and Pepper have some quality time.
“You know how to help May?” He heard Coulson asked over the intercom. Of course he was watching the whole thing on camera.
“Okay. How about this, you put the notepad down for the night and I will help push every single thought out of your head until morning,” Tony suggested.
Captain Tight Pants: Her name is Sharon. It wasn't like I just picked her up at the funeral. She live next to me for six months before old SHIELD imploded.
“Are you okay?” Steve asked her as he pulled her away from Clint. She could see Natasha now. She now had an arm around Clint or at least was trying to. He pushed her away. Of course, this Natasha had red hair again with blonde ends.
The new consultant: No, you were busy dealing with family drama. Even without Benji accidentally taking the mask off in front of you, you would’ve figured it out soon.
Anthony: It all went to me in the will, but it is your stuff now as far as I’m concerned. I’ll FedEx it to you.
Tony: I mean sexy new costume. You look good in black. Ana is getting used to my voice. I always hate this phase.
Even though my mom died young, I feel like we had a good relationship. I could tell her anything, well, almost anything. She didn’t know about Artie but she was so sick at the time that I didn’t want her to worry. Sometimes, I wonder how our relationship would be if she lived in this time. Would she be OK with me having a boyfriend? Especially a billionaire boyfriend? I don’t know. I hope she would be happy that I found someone I love and who loves me but I’m not sure. She was a very devout Catholic.
Anthony: You’re so funny. That’s Agent America despite her having the shield. I think Deputy Director Jeffrey wants to be Captain America. He can almost keep up with Agent Agent in trivia.
The new consultant: I know, but I'm not going to push until I'm at least there at the compound because I don't want to find out alone.
Iron dad: I also get to tell the president that she was conspiring with a consortium of aliens that referred to themselves as the confederacy.
I'm being called to mingle with the Grand Master's court. I hope Earth gets one of my messages very soon. If he tries to touch my boobs again, I will quake him or show him that thing that Tosha taught me. He looks humanoid enough to get just as broken.
Counselor Laura from 2023: That’s one way to put it. I guess I’m going to have to schedule two interventions. Friday, do not give that new file to Tony until I can talk to him.
Anthony: Yes, you did and I just walked into three truckloads of fan mail/get well cards sitting in the foyer of the penthouse. Why do they send billionaires teddy bears?
Anthony: I’m trying to find a gif that expresses my pure frustration with that and I can’t find anything appropriate.
“Well, that takes us into question 21. Do love and affection have a role in your life? I kind of want to know this, especially because you’re in a… I don’t want to call it a marriage of convenience.” Because there wasn’t anything really convenient about that relationship.
"You sleeping next to me shirtless is definitely okay. Wish I could remove the boxer shorts. But this beats the body pillow that Rhodey sent me to be an ass.” Steve raises an eyebrow at him.
Please note, since these people are not hiding from the government (Rhodey is VP and knows where they are), there are fewer codenames, and the underage are referred to by their actual names. It’s one of the few advantages of this dystopic future.
Venom: Yes, and I am already deeply regretting that decision. BITC accused me of sabotaging your relationship with MJ. I got a little defensive.
Tony: We shall see. Whatever the outcome. Let us hope we won’t have to deal with Ross anymore regardless, and if the other person gets elected, she will keep her promises about protecting people with powers and their families.
I am not sure if I forgive you. I'm working on it. Besides, they say forgiveness is mostly for the person doing the forgiving.
BITC: That explains so much. Actually, I’ve been monitoring superhero chatter. Apparently, there are pictures of Joey reassembling Thor’s hammer in Norway that are starting to crop up on social media platforms. And your big brother lifting it.
: Phillip J. "Phil" Coulson former director of SHIELD and current agent. According to intelligence, he is the one who knows what he is doing. Died during the battle of New York, but only temporary.
Cuddle Bunny: I am not having phone sex with you. I never had sex with Sharon. Or are you talking about Melinda?
“I am,” Leo replied, not making eye contact. “I’ve been since the uprising, when I killed my first Hydra agent. But thanks to Robin’s drawings, I know that we need Robbie for what’s to come. I knew I would lose him if I pulled the trigger. We can’t win without the Rider.”
Me: Look, I’ve tried to talk to Pepper. Half the time I choke and run away before the first word falls out of my mouth. I think it only worked at the hospital because drugs were involved.
D Fitzsimmons: After Thanos won, he didn't want anybody to undo what he did. So, the purple prick reduced the infinity stones to subatomic particles that could not undo what he did. For the last five years, Nana has been working on time travel. She thought she could re-create the monoliths, but she's been unsuccessful. About two weeks ago, Scott showed up at the Avenger compound's front door after being missing for five years. This provided us with a way to fix things that don't involve the monoliths that are in pieces.
“But I am here and we are together. I’m not leaving. I know you’re upset that I’m with Tony now but I love him, and more importantly he loves me. I’m not going to leave him just because you want him to get back together with his ex-girlfriend for reasons I don’t even understand. All the problems they had before are still there. Did you ever stop to think that’s not something Tony wants? That it is probably not even something Miss Potts wants,” Steve defended himself
“I am not going to have sex with you in this room.” Steve says swatting his hand away. Tony had no choice but to pout.
"And the fact that you realize that you don't know me even though I've been in the tabloids all my life makes me like you just a little bit more."
Cousin Q: According to Ana, the address doesn't actually exist, but you are a lifelong New Yorker. You know where everything actually is. Also, TMNS is at his biology class at Empire State, so I know better than texting him right now. Prof. Olivia Octavius will take his phone.
Counselor Laura: You’re probably right. I feel like Coulson knew that, which is probably another reason why he didn’t put up much of a fight regarding the regime change.
I’m not sure of the details of your contract because that’s in HR thing and they hate me but I promise you will be receiving premium compensation, along with housing and other perks. You will, however, be asked to sign the nondisclosure agreement due to the fact that there are additional enhanced people living on the Avengers campus for their own protection. You will be asked to protect their identity for their safety.
Anthony: This is just the stuff that passed inspection. All the hate mail was incinerated and all the credible threats have been forwarded to the FBI or Shield depending on the nature of what was said. Friday's not allowed to tell me what percentage of my mail is actually hate mail. It would make the depression worse to know how bad it really is.
Venom: Which is bull shit because Tony is such a better dad than my parents. Any child would be happy to have him as a father. He does so well with [redacted].
The Mechanic: It’s mostly been in Queens and that one time in the DC Metro. Also, people would argue against the adult thing. According to Fox News, I’m an overgrown toddler with too much money and no common sense
HSBF: I expect nothing less of Jim’s grandkid. And you’re probably going to have to do the things most parents do to get on the good side of the principal, like PTA meetings and chaperoning field trips.
Agent Laura: Engaged. The wedding wasn’t supposed to take place until April. I think they’re going to have to get a new date anyway.
“Of course. Wait, does he actually think Coulson is personally responsible for all the strange things that have happened?” Steve  asked after looking over the report.
Nomad: You're making new ones. Most of whom are not bloodsucking emotional leeches. At least I hope they’re not.
Blue phone: Arnie Roth. He was a perceived ladies’ man like Bucky and he also save me from a lot of bullies growing up.
“Number two is accusing Pepper of cheating on me when she ended up pregnant with Morgan. That’s the main reason we’re not together anymore.” Steve felt that there was probably another reason, but he chose not to press on that issue at the moment.
Me: Which doesn’t do any good because you don’t listen to him or anyone else, for that matter. (Message not sent.)
Nomad: You do realize that it is possible that the weapon that killed her family was designed by your father.
“Which is good because Thanos and his factions managed to destroy several blocks anywhere near an Avenger in the other timeline,” MJ remarked, looking up from her Stark pad.
“It is possible that the mechanism that caused me to be sent to this point in time or this dimension may have destroyed her and therefore there’s nobody left to bring me back.”
This conversation takes place on October 12, 2016 Tony’s time. However, it’s October 13 where Steve is.
“I’m still not allowed to do anything that will get my heart rate up, including you. You save a few hundred people on a ferry, which was technically violating doctor’s orders, and they decide to punish you.” Tony frowned. “Yes, I would have still done it, despite the consequences.”
Me: I definitely think you would want your father to stop drinking and maybe see a therapist. From what I’ve read and what you told me, I don’t think he was well later in life. Also I think you would’ve wanted Howard to be honest about what he was doing for a living or as honest as possible. I definitely think you wish you would not have been sent to boarding school.
Yes, I saw Black Panther this weekend and it was absolutely fabulous. It’s at the top of my Marvel movie list next to Winter Soldier. I’m sure I’m seeing it again as soon as the crowds calm down. If you would like to talk to me about the movie and how it will affect the story. Please PM me on fanfiction dot net or DM me on twitter. I have the same username over there. Please do not put anything spoiler-ish in your comments.
Counselor Laura: Not you, my Tony. I don’t know what happened here completely. No one wants to tell me because I may have passed out when I found out my children are dead here.
Unfortunately Steve pulled away. “As much as I want to continue this, I want to finish working on my letter to Bucky before you undress me again.”
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all absolutely lovely. I did survive my con and had an absolute blast. I even dressed as Reina for one day.
Me: Thanks to therapy, sobriety, and antidepressants, I know that I want him to be a kid for as long as he can be.
Tony: It helps that Afia is here. Well, not at the moment, but in general. She made me breakfast in bed, and we are having family movie time tonight. In a couple years, she can do the speech, complete with synthetic tears about never getting to meet her grandfather. Although I want to give her at least a year before she has to do this thing.
“Yesterday before we left. He is okay, just trying to work things out with Laura. Clint is still not happy that Laura joined Shield to get him a full pardon. At least Scott had to make a deal with the FBI and he’s on house arrest for the next two years because of it.”
Me: Yo-yo is only putting up with me because she has feelings for Agent Mack. However, the good Agent will not be involved with her romantically if she is an exclusive Shield asset because of fraternization regulations.
Tony: OK Friday is a brat and started blasting put a ring on it. This is why we must be wary of even benevolent AIs.
The mechanic: Yes. I have to go. I meeting the Princess in like a minute and I’m already at the lab. I just wanted a readout in case I needed to fly out there, and you know punch somebody.
Me: Coulson didn’t, although it was pretty obvious that he got to see you before I did when pictures of his signed copy of Captain America number one became his avatar on Freaking Cool.
Since I’ve already started talking about family life maybe I should just skip to the next question. Of course, I know you’re not going to let me get away with that. OK, family life with my actual blood related family is kind of complicated. I wasn’t sure that my father actually loved me until I read his diary bequeathed to me by the good aunt. So that says a lot of things.
Thank you to everyone who read or reviewed the last chapter. We have another fun conversation with FRIDAY. But not to worry, another Clint interlude is on the horizon.
Blue phone: Did you do the Captain America fighting among the cherry blossoms that used to hang in my bedroom at the tower? I actually like that painting.
Also, I actually worked in one of my crazy typos into the story because it made an amusing joke. See if you can spot it.
Tony: You’re going to have to find a specialist because you’re probably going to need one for Thor as well.
Agent M: That was our former boss’s decision. I didn’t know until it was done. But I’m not mad that he’s back, just furious about what it did to him.
After a comment from Shiningheart of ThunderClan, I decided that FRIDAY will be including her breakup soundtrack suggestions for each chapter when possible. Feel free to suggest your own songs.
“Friday, help daddy out. Are Fitz and Simmons U.S. citizens and therefore can be in charge of new Shield or whatever they’re calling it?” Tony asked only to be met with a female voice that Steve was not familiar with.
Me: Thank you. Next question: Is there something that you’ve always wanted to do but haven’t had a chance to yet? If so, why haven’t you got to it yet? I’m really not liking this quiz.
This is ridiculously short but I wanted FRIDAY and Tony to have a moment with one another. This conversation takes place two days after the last chapter. This is not a text message conversation, but a transcript of a conversation between Tony and his AI. Besides, what better way to start a Friday then with a FRIDAY chapter.
Anthony: He actually said "I wonder how long @SI_CEO_VPotts will stay at SI now that she is no longer “fully servicing” @Iron_Man”. Go check his twitter account if you don’t believe me. He has yet to have the decency to delete it despite having 20 comments by other people telling him to do so. Actually, most of them are telling him to delete his account.
BITC: How is MJ? Obviously not well if Flash is the one who is telling me that her cousin is missing.
Jemma: Cookies can’t help at a time like this. I've been trying to find him for five years, and he just chose to stay.
Monkey lover 2: Considering your stance on marriage, I assumed you asked her to create a new identity?
I have to let go. I really have no choice, but to. I am dating your best friend and if I keep hating you, things with Cuddle Buddy will fall apart and I don't want it to. I don't know how I fell in love with the sanctimonious asshole, but it happened. It just did.
I debated whether to call this a conversation or a mission report chapter because it contains both. However, since it begins with the conversation I will treat as such.
Friday: They were already enroute before this incident occurred and should arrive within the next four hours.
FRIDAY: Agent Melinda May’s married last name was Garner. When she lived next door to you, she was still utilizing her married name due to the fact she acquired the apartment after leaving her husband but before returning to her maiden name professionally.
May: I think she’ll accept. She likes Tony. Hunter will like her being able to stay over. Hunter was banned from having overnight guests after Morgan walked in on him and Simmons last year.
Me: OK, then I guess I’ll ask you a few clean questions so we can get through this exercise before I see you in a sexy suit. If you could talk to a clairvoyant or precog would you?
Also one of Tony’s text messages probably pushes us into M territory, but it’s one line and I didn’t want to change it for the T version on fanfiction dot net because it is important for the conversation. Although that doesn’t matter at the moment because I can’t even upload the chapters to that site presently.
Tony: In addition to the diplomatic version of fuck off, he said that I should be a little mellower now that I have a boyfriend and therefore less likely to make murder bots again. According to Rhodey, I’m less likely to do stupid stuff when I’m with somebody. Then Ross mentioned that the Ultron incident happened when I was dating Pepper. Then Rhodey told him that we were on a break. So if that ends up all over the Internet, we know who’s to blame.
Thank you to everybody who read or commented on the last conversation. You are all absolutely wonderful. While Tony and Steve are basking in the afterglow, I thought we would check up on some of the others in D.C. for plot reasons.
Anthony: I give her one of these phones and you could do text message sessions. You could try voice, but it’s easier for Friday to make sure they don’t find the text messages.
Director Stark: Also, if I dated who my friends wanted me today, I would still be with Pepper. Maybe you should make your own choices.
Football Hunter: I’m just trying to be helpful. I think you would be less stressed if you had a good shag. I would offer, but I’m not sure if you would say yes.
Me: I knew I should have L go over the LGTBA curriculum with you. I assume you never googled Tony Stark gay sex tape?
Chief mechanic: Yes, I fucking can be angry about somebody trying to turn a dead Vision into a weapon no matter what timeline it happens in.
Yes. Stefan and I talked. He knows about the ring and he is not opposed to spending the rest of his life with me, but I’m holding on to the ring for now. I think that’s best.
I received a very interesting inheritance from my Aunt Peggy. I have dozens and dozens of diaries with the type of stuff that the CIA probably would like to burn. Half of it's in code and a lot of it is written in some combination of French, German, Spanish and English. Good thing I know most of those languages. So it turns out that you were the last in a long string of attempts to murder my father for the sake of the cult of Hive.
Avenger Friday: Robin’s biological mother was killed shortly before the decimation. Despite the vast number of children orphaned during the decimation, what was left of the infrastructure did not want to give a single woman with ties to a disgraced spy agency custody of two young children.
Counselor Laura: So don’t be blaming yourself for how things turned out. Clint’s a grown-up and he made his choices.
Nomad: I assume that you’re referring to the accusation that you cheated on Pepper with a widow administrative assistant from Queens? Their cell phone video.
Anthony: No, you’re not. Happy may not be ready to move on, but I am so moving on to you. I can’t wait to see you look all sexy in a suit. Maybe something by Tom Ford. Thankfully, I have your uniform measurements on file.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation, you’re all fabulous. You are all wonderful. This conversation takes place close to the end section of the last section. That’s all I am saying for now.
"But that's not you. The guy that Steve talks about is definitely not the guy who put out a sex tape for attention or has done 99% of the other things that the media has attributed to him."
Me: Did you notice that the security systems on the Raft were nowhere as good as they should’ve been?
Me: Yes, Wanda told me because she doesn't have that pesky healthcare professional patient confidentiality thing Laura has going on. Good news, Wanda no longer wants me dead for my various indirect roles in killing all of her family. Progress.
HSBF: But you do have a private persona. The Tony that I see is very different than the one the world sees. Otherwise we wouldn’t have to come up with real answers and public answers to the 36 questions.
SimmonsJA: That remains to be seen. Are you still planning to publicly rollout your relationship with Stefan tomorrow at the SI wildlife trafficking awareness event?
Red phone: I'm going to ask you a hard question and you cannot answer, but are you really bi or did you end up chasing Aunt Peggy and subsequently make out with her grandniece because you grew up during the homophobic dark ages and you felt like that’s what you’re supposed to do?
Tony: Look, at this point I am still shocked that I’m not facing kidnapping charges for Germany. Nothing, whatsoever, about Germany was a good decision.
Red phone: Although somehow Natasha was the one who ended up doing my psych evaluation while I was dying. It didn't paint me in a very favorable light. Ironman, yes. Tony Stark, no.
Anthony: Fair point. Actually, I think there might be two receptions, although we’re spending tomorrow in a bedroom together because I need recovery time after this much social interaction. Also, we totally should’ve gotten round 4 in this morning.
StarkAE: Yes. He’s been fitted with a wonderful Tom Ford suit this morning. I have at least two dozen pictures for private time.
If anybody wants to try drawing the Barton children’s interpretations of Steve’s new costume, I will love you forever.
Me: You’re learning sarcasm. Even then it would still be too personal and probably something that Sharon wouldn’t want out there. She’s still cranky at me for the cover identity. Reporters keep showing up near her apartment to ask questions about her former stepdad.
Chief mechanic: Actually, the POTUS is shocked I even know about SWORD at the moment. Per the notes, the current head might be the key to contacting the mysterious Carol.
Me: That’s sweet. It’s okay. I promised I would do lunch with Melinda. Room service does a really good burger. With my metabolism, I’m going to need at least five of those fancy lunches to take the edge off.
Me: Although I’m half convinced that she just wanted the Captain America style tactical suit for role-play with Agent as soon as he gets his head out of his ass. Seriously, will they just kiss already?
Director Snookums: Of course you would run for Congress just to get your boyfriend back in the country. Sometimes I think you asked that I be Director just so it would be easier for you to have a booty call with Cuddle Bunny.
Tony: There are other applications. I really would love a life-like android to take my place during board meetings. Maybe then they would stop trying to lock me out of my own company.
Anthony: The stock prices have kind of been wacky on that front, in part because of the incident. Attempted murder of a majority shareholder/Head of the board of directors/Head of R&D usually sends stocks down unless he is a complete and utterly incompetent asshole. I think I’m at least half competent, even if I really am an asshole.
“Not that much. He seems to be developing a stronger relationship with Michelle. Although sometimes he cries about his deceased uncle. The one-year anniversary of his death is November 20.”
The truth would have been better. We were sleeping together for months. I should have at least known where you really worked. Now I’m left wondering how much was real and how much was fake. Clint tells me that most of it was real. Apparently you two worked together a lot before the incident in Bahrain. But, Clint is also a professional liar that will do whatever it takes for the greater good.
Counselor Laura from 2023: It's how they're differentiating me from the Laura of this timeline. Clint 2023 hasn't been a Shield Agent for a decade at this point.
Cuddle Bunny: Also, Clint wanted me to pass on the message that if his wife gets arrested again and you don’t tell him immediately, he will hunt you down and put an arrow through your… You get the idea. I had to tell you that because it was part of his conditions to get my phone back.
HSBF: Coulson and his team were the ones who did most of the dirty work with Hydra so I’m going to have to give that one to him.
Tony: Will this change if we bring Fitz back? The snapped version, not the one who is married to Hunter in the other timeline. I think he is staying there for good.
Anthony: From what we pieced together, Howard figured out something was wrong and stole the new alien super serum they were working on and was planning to disappear to the Stark family private island before they took him out. I am starting to accept that despite the brutality, the Winter Soldier was just the weapon. Hydra pulled the trigger. And Agent Campbell blew up the first and last leader of Hydra.
Tony: I don’t know. The mission is different now. It's gone from trying to get the stones to getting Laura back to her own timeline/dimension and Deke back to us. I already figured out time travel GPS, but that’s not what happened according to what she told us before throwing up. Unfortunately, Simmons's notes are pretty much indecipherable. It’s hard to fix something when you’re not sure what you’re trying to fix.
Tony: Yes, because it’s been that kind of day. The R&D meeting was productive, mostly. They’re not all morons, even if they’re not used to the new office space. They’ve actually made progress on new encryption for the Stark phones and tablets without me. Also the new, charge once every two weeks, battery will be rolled out with the new Stark phone in early December as originally hoped. I’m sure the board will be happy about that.
Also, for those of you reading Hydra lullaby, I will be updating that chapter later today so you get double the fun.
CoulsonPJ: Apparently he said something during that conversation that now makes you want to strangle him?
Agent M: We need her. Five-year-olds are literally waking up with superpowers due to chemically contaminated spiders. I don’t want Bahrain to happen again. With Laura’s help, I think we can avoid that situation again.
“The 90s were a strange time as were the 80s, apparently.” Hunter quipped, referring to some of Robin’s 90s era artwork featuring the mysterious Carol and unknown Krees.
Anthony: Well apparently if we just let the FBI deal with it, the alien tech that was stolen right out from under the government’s nose would not have malfunctioned. [Insert eye roll here.] Wait, how do you even know about that?
Counselor Laura: You did, and it made the last month of pregnancy tolerable. You have excellent choice in chocolate and apology presents. Although, I prefer when you deliver them in person. So you didn’t show up at the farmhouse crying and asking for forgiveness?
Iron Dad: This didn’t happen since I was on doctor’s orders not to have sex. When not under such orders, we would at least find a decent conference room. Which might be the plan now. Of course, I get to reunite with my fiancé in the middle of a crisis.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all wonderful. Thank you for your kind words. We are still here in the bad timeline.
I’m not that worried about the Boy in the Chair hanging out with Friday but if he starts watching the classic weird science movie let me know.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Spider: He prefers Nomad. And yes. Along with Falcon, Black Widow, as well as Mockingbird and the Rider. The last two are new. Also because of that, I can't tell you where we are, except we are somewhere in Europe.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last chapter. You are all wonderful. We are still in Johannesburg. However, Tony has to be a grown-up and he can’t take his honey bunny with them. This means text messaging Steve when he supposed to be at a lunch with various world leaders. It is now Saturday, September 24, 2016 in the story which means were almost exactly a year behind. All lot of the next few conversations will be happening today because September 24 is a big day.
“This is totally why I prefer AI assistance. But occasionally, you need people.” Tony leaned over to kiss Steve at that moment, “Sometimes, people can be good.”
Me: I flew that missile into the portal all by myself. I kind of regret not having Jarvis dig into the files a little bit more so we could’ve discovered that Malik was actually Hydra before he ordered a missile to blow up New York and kill us all but that’s life.
“This is true.” He said, handing the omelet to Pepper. He’s definitely a much better cook now. He also remembers her food allergies since, unfortunately, Morgan inherited both of their allergies.
When you think about it, he got out of prison and went right back to doing the exact same thing. You escape hell and you were just laying low trying to get your mind back together and then you allowed yourself to be locked up. At least that shows a certain amount of contrition. Maybe that's why karma is leaving you be where you are and the bastard is currently being scraped off the floor of a warehouse in Baltimore. I didn't pull the trigger either. His client did.
Tony: I think we are. OK, so blueberry syrup is now covering most of the kitchen. That means I need to get them a bath and you probably need to do whatever you’re doing that I’m afraid to know the answer to, because you’re probably going to get yourself shot at again. I don’t even know what continent you’re on right now.
“I am too. Of course, he knows me because I was friends with his grandfather during the war.” Steve explained.
Chief Mechanic: I really feel like you should call him husband. You don't wanna slip up in public. Jane would kill you.
May: It’s good that you’re still working on your degree. I know the Laura here always wanted to go back to school but could never find the time.
Anthony: That makes complete sense in a Steve sort of way. Anyway the idea of the project is to make you feel everything in the virtual reality environment as if you were doing it in real life. That way you can improve your training technique without the risk of hospitalization or taking out half your garage.
"No you don’t. Especially because I convinced Mister and Mrs. Purple Arrow to bring the kids over before we leave for India.”
Monkey lover 2: I’m only developing weapons for the Avenger squad. I’m allowing the ICERs to be mass-produced because I think it will cut down on unnecessary deaths in certain situations. The prosthesis work is where we’re going to make a real dent.
“Buttercup is a perfectly acceptable pet name. Although if you prefer, I could go with DILTF.” Tony remarked.
Me: I don’t think Liberty is going to see it that way and is still going to want to be there to hold his Iron Teddy Bear’s hand through the entire thing.
Nomad: I didn’t say love. It’s just a crush. I think he’s over me or trying to get over me. Friday sent me the link to the video Best Thing I Never had the day before we started exchanging text messages. She followed up by sending Tears of a Clown after we started talking to one another.
Me: He knows that I know, but he doesn’t want to know in case he gets pulled in for questioning. Considering the guy who almost took over Shield wanted to arrange for regular lie detector tests for all assets including Avengers, it was a good call on his part.
Venom: I know that, but I'm not entirely sure Benji realizes he doesn't need to choose or if I'm even a possible choice.
Considering Piper complained about her new and probably soon-to-be former girlfriend being furious about her missing her birthday due to out-of-town work commitments, she probably wasn’t enjoying this as much as others would.
Me: Right after our little fuck up in Siberia. He was killed by one of the big bad’s minions trying to rescue Agent Daisy. At least that’s what I’ve heard from the Shield rumor mill. However, spies are absolutely awful at gossip. They keep everything to themselves, but Agent Piper likes me.
Nomad: No, but it makes sense that you are continuing what we had planned before it all came apart. Especially with all the kids around. You don’t want them to accidentally get hurt.
Me: By next Saturday, everything will be upstate and Happy will obviously be on a plane back to Malibu so I can avoid his wrath.
Cuddle Bunny: Friday told me that it was safe to text message you again. Are you back in civilization yet?
Me: But taking a step back is good because, well, you can’t fix everything and being a part of the UN Avengers will provide him with additional tools. So, SI part time and Avengers part time with extra time for Suarez and the occasional mental health spa day.
Tony: Friday also talked us into doing the 36 questions that lead to love. Or rather, she forced us to on your orders.
“Okay, Howard caught me using your propaganda poster for personal time when I was a teenager.” Technically he was a preteen, but he wasn’t quite ready for Steve to know that yet. “I’m still shocked he didn’t yell at me. Instead, he had Aunt Peggy give me the Captain America was really bisexual speech. You’re actually the reason why I figured out I was pansexual. You‘re also the reason why I was comfortable being not that heterosexual. Because if Captain America was queer, then it was okay for me to be too.” Tony explained.
Purple Princess: I’ll have Ana send you the BRIEFR packet. Just make sure you read it in a secure location.
MayMQ: This is not new information, his hatred for Ross anyway. I am surprised that he doesn’t want to go after Rogers when he wants Daisy back.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are so lovely. Welcome back to the “we made better choices” timeline.
Me: She’s laughing and says to meet her in the lab in 30 minutes. There’s a project she wants your input on. She might call Wanda in as well.
Me: That’s understandable, especially because we’ve had so many close calls. I am really hoping you don’t get shot again. Here’s hoping the Royal genius did her thing.
Anthony: It got postponed for work things. Shield and DODC work things. Never try to work with the federal government. Years of it working smoothly without interference and now that my BFF oversees a sister agency, chaos.
Counselor Laura from 2023: Bruce, I can get to attend. Dr. Potts should be there. If he’s not cursing my name in effigy. Do I tell him about Hydra continually trying to kill his family members before or after this meeting?
Me: It wasn’t just finding out that Anthony trusts Nomad more than her or that he was the new boyfriend. She also found out that Coulson and I are also on that list. Because of the situation, I’m the one making all the decisions because Coulson is trying to find out who did this and the Director is still trying to make his way back from Geneva.
Tony: You will be happy to know Steve doesn't want to wipe out all the babies born in the last five years out of existence, either. So, our kid is safe.
“What is  the next question?” Steve’s blush was telling Tony that he was obviously seriously considering that proposition and did not want to discuss his answer at the moment. That was promising.
Also, the voice recognition software initially put arrested instead of rested and it was just too funny not to use. My voice rec has an interesting sense of humor. Maybe she’s part FRIDAY?
Anthony: Now that Shield is under complete government control again, the State Department is now only responsible for governing multilateral international enhanced person cooperation and the enforcement of the peaceful use of the enhanced person provision of the UN treaty. Which means we are now at the mercy of whoever they choose to put in charge of Shield which, even under Hydra control, was still better than Ross.
Me: It would have been really nice to know about that earlier because I could’ve rubbed it in Ross’s face after his snide comments about Bruce. It turns out the US government really did lose a nuclear warhead and Agent’s team had to save their asses.
CoulsonPJ: Also, Fitz integrated your burn phone technology into a new shield instant messaging system that we’ve been using to circumvent Ross.
Anthony: My ego thanks you. What about Tropical Thunder? I think it’s a good option if you want to stare at somebody that kind of looks like me.
Jemma: Ana’s orders are to keep Thanos from happening by whatever means necessary. She sent me Deke’s text messages.
Me: Everyone did except for you apparently. How are you just realizing this now? He flirted with you all the time. We used to call you guys mom and dad.
Me: Agent May has more, but she can’t technically be an Avenger because she’s not enhanced. Now she is a leader.
Monkey lover 2: That’s fine. The director already asked me to go along to mediate. Apparently, there are some questions about where Stark Senior got the materials for the shield now belongs to May.
“Definitely probably but not today. Today, I’m going to see how fast I can undress you.” Tony said before leaning over to kiss Steve again. This time he responded.
Red phone: Yes. For a couple more days anyway. I’m giving the decorators time to remodel. Since Pepper is gone from my personal life for good, it was time to remove her from my personal space.
“I will. Even though we’re not together, he is still my best friend. I’ll keep Tony safe until you can come home.”
Me: She was until various members of the Aryan Brotherhood were made extra crispy by the Rider of East LA yesterday. Your ex-girlfriend flew out there last night to help with the investigation.
“Is that Tony unable to be confirmed because of Ultron?” Steve asked. She was sure that Steve already knows that her timeline branched off from the year after the incident.
Tony: Okay, it would’ve been better if the reason for such little sleep was a BJ and not because some guy who I never met blames his poor decision to turn to a life of crime on me and tried to take the Avenger toy chest on its way to our new house.
Hunter: It's not as bad now since most of the worst board members are gone, thanks to the Pride fiasco last summer. However, I don't think needing to prepare for an alien invasion was ever part of your duties at Stark Industries. It is less stressful.
"That's because you're a professional." It's at that moment, Tony started hearing muffled yet angry yelling from the hallway.
The new consultant: Because you don't want this to be a rebound? Also, let's be honest, the breakup really happened on Valentine's Day. Yesterday, was confirmation.
“Whatever happened doesn’t sound very good.” Steve said pulling him back down onto the bed. He was shirtless. Bless him.
Me: Well you just go for the jugular. No, hi, how are you doing? You don’t even bother to tell me your side of what happened Saturday night. All I have are Agent Agent’s reports and things now former staff members leaked to Twitter.
“That’s ridiculous,” he denied a little too quickly. “If I was in love with her, why would I push her to be with Tony?”
Venom: Peter and Afia have decided that we should go down to the Royal Embassy because there's more space down there and apparently better food. We consumed most of the ice cream and chocolate on base last night.
Tony: I only agree with that because I love you. Come back when you're done hanging out. We are having, congratulations we are engaged sex.
So in this timeline where Carol and Maria got together after Monica disappeared, Maria lived 18 months longer than in the Sacred timeline. Off-world technology may have helped prolong her life, but it wasn’t a cure. Maria also said no to Kree blood antibodies.
Cuddle Bunny: Laura told me when I talked to her a couple of days ago. I finally decided that I should see someone professionally. She’s trying to arrange that.
Red spider: It’s not my fault that they assumed most of the original Avengers were straight, despite Stark’s gay sex tape from the 90s.
“Yes. A lot of things make a hell of a lot more sense now. Obviously, he was living vicariously through me. However, I think that ship has sailed. Happy was happy with May before the snap messed everything up. At this point, I think Morgan's going to get a Fitzsimmons for a step-daddy. That’s definitely going to break the half your age +7 rule since I don’t even think Deke was born for another 30 years in his own timeline.”
“I suggested that she talk to Fitz because a couple weeks ago he mentioned working on antidote to some sort of biological weapon that could literally scare someone to death. I think his research might be useful in this case. That kid is crazy prepared, which may explain why he’s taking a couple of days for mental health rehab. He needs a break.”
“I haven’t read the play for a while but I think offering sex to stay out of war is the exact opposite. You really should go to sleep. You ramble when you’re sleep deprived."
"Yo-Yo caused a distraction. I escaped before I could, you know, get arrested. I really did promise Pepper that I would avoid that."
25 minutes later while Tony was in the shower. Steve managed to sneak his present into the bottom of Tony’s suitcase. Hopefully Tony wouldn’t open his suitcase again until he got to LA. It was at that moment that Melinda let herself into the room.
“Tony, I think you need to get outside and watch the kids. You’re the only one who can deal with [bleep],” Pepper suggested.
Chief mechanic: Hey, sorry I didn’t get back to you immediately, but Jeffrey decided that prancing around Sunday morning TV was necessary for the sake of the Galaxy. I miss the days when I could go on Good Morning  America. You know what I think of Chuck Todd. Robin is the best.
Tony: I am too. Unfortunately, Spidey‘s aunt really is. Yeah, I really really wish we’d had this conversation before she found out accidentally.
Purple Princess: Now that it's an option. I'm so happy it's an option. We fix the Accords. We had to scrap them and start over, but it's better than what we had.
I am sure you know who I am right now. I bet you weren’t expecting your BFF to be dating Tony fucking Stark when you woke out of deep-freeze but here we are. Does it help to know I’m head over feet in love with him?
Tony: BTW, according to the special house guest, he wasn’t dead; he was just bounced back in time and created a new branch timeline. Therefore, time GPS is essential.
PS: I think I might be able to convince Monkey Lover to jump ship to SI. You can help me talk him into it at Thanksgiving.
Tony: 100% sincere. I should definitely start with those flowers. I’m better at apologizing with things than with words. I think it something I unfortunately got from Howard. So you know I’m going to try not to do it if I can help it. Maybe I’ll work on my apology letter during the accounts meeting in an hour.
The new consultant: I have no idea. Let’s just refer to him as Benji for the rest of this conversation. Unless you want to discuss your fascination with his genitalia.
"And you, Natasha, Wanda, Yo-Yo, Daisy, Laura and the family, Kamala, Miles, as well as Peter along with a lot of others that I haven't even met yet. Somebody has to play the game and as much as Steve hates doing stuff like that, it's necessary for the greater good."
Me: Thankfully for you, I find chasing you and the others down for Ross illegal and immoral and so does my legal team.
Person that cares about my boss: Okay. I guess that means I wasn’t just a job to her. Is she your contact to find out what really happened to Ana?
Nomad: Wait, are they actually devoting an entire hour to talk about your break up with Pepper when there's so much else going on in the world?
Tony: Maybe. Although, I only called you bonbon because the time I tried the literal translation of cuddle bunny, Yo-Yo started giggling.
Avenger Ana: You are no longer in the range of a Stark communication satellite. I'm currently trying to locate a local satellite or similar device and will transmit the data as soon as feasible.
The Mechanic: It will be even though I’m the only Avenger there. Besides the Bulletproof Pacifist and he is technically a reservist. He’s also only there part-time, thanks to Spider sitting
Nomad: Well, there wasn't a lot to do the first few days of hiding out once we got to where we needed to be.
Me: It kind of scares me because it reminds me of how I was post New York. I was a ghost. I think I’ve been that way for a while. Therapy has been helpful.
Friday: I hate to interrupt, but a computer with the name Ned’s Death Star is trying to override the training wheels protocol of the Spider-Man suit.
Director Stark: Why did Flash pass out? Was alcohol involved? I heard about the break-up. I knew we should have tried a more intensive rehab program with him, but he didn’t want to miss school.
Counselor Laura: No, but now I’m going to really want to see that footage. Due to the stressful circumstances of recent events, we programmed Friday to notify us if Tony engages in any high-risk behavior that could be dangerous to himself or others.
Red phone: So I couldn’t get out of the State Department meetings and now Pepper is mad at me because I told Ross to fuck off.
Agent L. Barton: We’ve already been talking about that. I want to bring all the kids. Simmons can be their agent chaperone. She’ll hate doing it, but she’ll do it for the baby.
Anthony: You’ll be happy to know that I’m perfectly okay and have survived my first day of everyone knowing that Pepper dumped me without incident. No snide remarks from other members of the board. No long-suffering looks of pity or condemnation from total strangers. The stocks have even gone up two points, because apparently most of Wall Street knew what was going on and now are relieved that Pepper is staying on despite our personal issues.
Oh by the way we’re going to do Thanksgiving at the compound. Stefan won’t be there because you know why. If you’re not trying to avert an apocalypse, you’re invited. Actually most of the team is invited. And I think I have to invite Piper and Davis because I put them through a lot the last couple of days. Although, Davis is running a mission with the aunt and the counselor right now, so he’s probably happy. Piper on the other hand, broke up with the girlfriend while here, so definitely inviting her to Thanksgiving.
“Thank you for lying, but it’s not necessary. You’ve known me for less than five years and you’ve known him since playgroup.” Tony tells Steve.
Ana 2018: Is Dr. Potts-Stark aware of the circumstances of my name sake‘s death? That was the catalyst that led to Dr. Stark-Rogers reconciling with his past regarding his father.
Shuri probably should have let Sergeant Barnes read his friend’s final letter under the supervision of his therapists just like he read the earlier attempts the day before. Especially, because she is certain that the second half of the letter came from Stark himself. However, she received a text message from Dr. Leopold activating the Friday protocol. That means she needed to go back to America within the next few hours and she really wanted James to read the letters in her presence. Over the last few months, they have become friends and James needed a friend while reading.
Red phone: Actually, I have a lot of DC meetings next week. Several at the State Department, if I can’t get out of them.
“I told you that you were doing better than me. See, I’m totally overthinking it as well,” Tony sighed.
HSBF: I’m sure they’ll just assume that you’re joking. You are joking because I doubt she has agreed to it.
Anthony: Definitely. It would’ve been nice to know enough to understand why people were shooting at my dad, in addition to knowing that they were doing it in the first place. I didn’t even know about his involvement in Shield until Fury broke into my house way back in 2009.
Counselor Laura from 2023: Exactly, but we need Pym particles. It might be better for you to do it on your side since Dr. Pym is still alive. Your timeline has you, Peter, two Fitzs, a sober Simmons, Deke, Tony, and the inventor of the necessary particles, Dr. Pym himself. He is still alive? In this timeline, there was some business with someone name Ghost. Which apparently was old Shield fuck up related.
“To protect you from what?” Tony asked. Surprisingly at that moment, the radio (Friday) started playing robot boy by Linkin Park.
Anthony: Gabriel had Michelle sometime in the 60s before he was killed, leaving Michelle to be raised by Peggy and Daniel. Michelle had Sharon after a disastrous relationship that was MIT legend. So technically Sharon is Peggy’s great grandniece and you made out with her at Aunt Peggy’s funeral.
Anthony: Don’t we all. Don’t worry, he’s dead now. Agent Campbell took out the last echoes of him before dying.
Tony: Next week sometime. I think. I really need to double check with Yo-Yo. I think I’m scheduled to be in DC for a few days taking some meetings or maybe a few weeks. I’m mostly looking forward to having lunch with my BFF and having a front row seat for the Ross implosion.
: refers to Kamala Khan formerly of Jersey City. Currently relocated to an undisclosed location due to being targeted by the “Watchdogs”. Best friend to “Lily Bear”. Spends a lot of time on Freaking Cool with the parental blocks firmly in place to filter out all the M or higher stories.
Okay you’re 15, so you probably have some idea of what I’m planning to do with my boyfriend if Simmons will clear me and she may not because of me saving you.
Me: Spider mom feels better about the whole situation now. Although, I still see lots of couples' therapy in their future.
Please note this is the last chapter I have back from proofreading. I hope to get more back soon, but we shall see. I am in need of another proofreader to work on either Marvel or Star Trek stories (I’ll even take someone willing to do my Ugly Betty stories). That way I can have one person doing each story which does speed things up. Please contact me if you are interested.
Tony: But I still wish I had more time to actually spend with you. Not that sharing a bed wasn’t nice, but I like talking to you.
Ana Jr.: Afia is currently having a research session with her friends on the Wakanda embassy levels. They have New York bagels and pizza. Along with access to the embassy kitchens.
Morgan’s dad: Or lock it in one of the safes. I need Simmons with just enough alcohol in her system to prevent withdrawal, so she can help.
Counselor Laura: As we work on getting everyone here emotionally healthy, we start working on how to get me back to my timeline. Which means you come down and tell me what you know.
Tony: Shield replacement agency here. The official one. May’s team is really just an extension of the Avengers at this point. It was founded by Carol’s late wife.  Unfortunately, the guy who took over was a Dick, so no wonder Doctor Cruz got the hell out of there.
Steve also didn't trust Ross, most likely because he was already sure that the government was working on a new super soldier project. Spoiler alert: they are. He didn't want to be their guinea pig. So he felt not signing was the better course of action. Steve hasn't been a dancing monkey for anyone since the early 1940s, there was no way in hell he was going back to it now. Honestly, I really didn’t want Ross to lay a single finger on Steve either.
Me: Surprisingly, Friday doesn’t have to alter the text that much. You are now cuddle bunny in my address book.
Me: L is running interference, but I wish you were here to help keep those two from doing more stupid thing
Anthony: I’m totally okay with going through with this. Stefan being there might be a good thing. Although I’m hoping that you will look so good along with the fact you have a Y chromosome will keep the press so distracted that they won’t realize you look like a bearded Captain America in a suit, without Kevlar.
Red phone: No. That would just make things worse. Thankfully, she just thinks I'm dating some random 35-year-old. Friday redeemed herself by reversing the 8 and the 1 in your birth year before Pepper grabbed my phone.
Me: Finally, Rhodey is going through round two of the vetting process. I mean, he’s still mad at me for putting his name forward, but the man will always put his country first. Apparently keeping some PR obsessing rule oriented asshole from being in charge of Shield is part of that.
The boss: That’s not accurate. I didn’t want to lose Morgan. I didn’t want her to lose me. I’m not some heartless monster who doesn’t want to bring everyone else back. I know you lost Bobbi. We all lost people; even Carol lost her stepdaughter. Although, does the person count as your stepdaughter if the marriage happened after they were dusted?
James already knew about Steve’s boyfriend and it wasn’t from reading the fragments of Steve’s attempts at writing to him or Starks apology gift basket that Shuri gave to him yesterday. Since their arrival, a couple of weeks ago, James’s been spending a lot of time with Mrs. Hinton and her daughter. Robin finds the goats peaceful and they were living in a house only half a meter away. James just happened to recognize that Steve was kissing Dr. Stark in one of those images when he was having tea with Robin’s mother. And because Robin likes “Mr. James”, she told him everything.
“You can if you wish to, when you write to him. If you choose to write to him. However, I feel I made the right choice. I wasn’t sure he would actually send a letter and you needed to know what he was thinking,” she said as she followed behind James as he walked into his house.
“What does DILTF mean? I know that you use that in your address book for me." Steve must be trolling him. He has a teenager with friends. Tony is sure some of them have called him that.
Agent 19: SHIELD codename for Barbara “Bobbi” Morris. Also uses Mockingbird as a codename. Former Shield agent with a master's degree in chemistry.  Disavowed earlier this year after an incident with the Russian government. Details are unavailable but President Ellis had to personally get her and her former husband Lance Hunter out of Russian custody.
Red phone: I can see Inside Out. You probably identify with Riley. This decade seems like broccoli pizza to you and all you want to do is get your old life back but you can’t.
“So, are we still together when you were sent over here? Because I feel like my other self would have retrieved you by now.” She definitely would’ve grabbed Fitz out by now. She would owe him that much.
Anthony:  I know. After Lily bear tipped me off, Laura told me about your reaction and the fact you are spending quality time with your therapist for a little while. Also, our little red mystic sent pictures through her not-a-boyfriend.
Morgan’s dad: Difficult is getting your 4-year-old to fall asleep when her best friend stays over. This feels impossible.
Anthony love: I was planning to do it at the Playground where I’m the boss, but I’m not anymore because you’re a brat.
Nomad: Well, it probably would’ve been really hard to hide her mom being the public founder of Shield.
Me: Yep. And she couldn’t stop it. I think this goes back to my answer a few days ago about not wanting the ability to see the future.
"Okay, I wish I didn’t go to it at all, but I kind of wish I’d dated guys more publicly in the past, mostly for spite right now."
Me: Recent meetings with various Senators have made me realize that they are never going to trust the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement, and Logistics Division. Leo and others made me realize that the public will be even less trusting. We are going to take a different approach.
I'm not going to use your nickname because I think that's reserved for Cuddle Bunny. I’m beginning to really see the difference between the Winter Soldier and the guy who grew up with my boyfriend, mostly because I had a major breakthrough last week during a mission in Baltimore that was not sanctioned at all.
Tony: Thor lost his father, friends, brother, and planet in less than a month. He also went for the heart instead of the head, and therefore he blames himself for Thanos succeeding. It was made worse by Jane being dusted. I think only Dr. Darcy made it. He lost practically everything and didn’t cope in the best way.
Me: As I said earlier, I do want to keep a low profile until dinner tonight. People trying to take selfies with me because they think I am either Chris Evans or Keanu Reeves is not good.
The new consultant: Only for not having Alastair taken out earlier. When will I be getting to the Lighthouse?  You said that I would be coming over.
You took her from me. You took one of the few good things in my life away from me. I don’t know that forgiveness is possible for that. I’m not sure.
“Or, best friends just know this stuff. There are very few secrets I can keep from Platypus and Pepper Pot.” Tony put an arm around him. “I’m still shocked that I kept the fact I was dying a secret from everybody.”
Not surprisingly, Melinda left the room after that revelation. I am trying to decide if it was the Coulson was alive revelation or the fact that her husband was engaged to someone else revelation that forced her to leave. Considering Friday told me that they were only married so she could get custody of her adopted daughters, I’m leaning towards Coulson being alive and well in my timeline. I can understand how hard something like that could be.
Me: OK I’m equally annoyed and upset because what happened could’ve been prevented if different choices were made.  I think he was annoyed with me about Peter sitting duty which is weird since that was mostly a Laura and Yo-Yo thing.
Anthony: We could totally be in our room working on round number 4. I think I got you to the point where you’re willing to be on top. I promise I won’t have a Siberia flashback. I know you’re worried about that.
Me: I would love to know where you are, but I was worried about that question. Thankfully, he just asked me where Captain America is. Mr. Patriotism didn’t even ask me about the other Avengers. Idiot.
In regards to question 27, of course we are going to become friends because we already are friends who make out with each other. You really do know a lot more about me than anyone else. So yesterday, I was being totally incognito with Benji at a restaurant because I couldn’t send him to Queens on an empty stomach, after an actual mentoring session. So, somebody at the restaurant thought he was my son and a part of me really wanted that to be true. Not him in particular but to have a kid. Thanks to the Palladium poisoning not happening but that’s a nice Idea though. There’s always your sperm because I’m not sure if there is an adoption agency in the world that would give me a kid, despite my finances.
HSBF: Speaking of marriage, there were pictures of us together at the wedding and apparently there are engagement rumors circulating. Lily’s aunt showed me an article from some Russian newspaper; apparently, we’ve made the papers.
Me: Perfect. Enjoy your vacation. If this wasn’t a trip for me to see my boyfriend, I would’ve brought Pepper along so she could have a distraction from that asshole. I should totally send you guys to the Bahamas or someplace warm but not Tahiti. Tahiti has been tainted.
Director Snookums: Tony, I'm really trying here, but you have to meet me halfway. Don't do stupid shit.
Tony Potts: We’re doing the 36 questions. For a pop psychology New York Times icebreaker activity, this thing has been getting a little deep. I need someone else to talk some of this out with. I should probably call my therapist but haven’t called her in about three years, so I probably need a new one. And my sponsor is working right now.
Lily bear 2018: Mom, is this really you? Are you OK? Are you really in the future? Mr. Fitzsimmons said you were, but Ana let me see the video. You just disappeared.
"Now that never crossed my mind. Not once did I consider that possibility. Happy knows things from the bad old days that he could make a fortune off of selling to the tabloids."
“Yep, that lady from Homeland security scares the hell out of me. So does General Hale and her Stepford daughter. Talbot didn’t even know about her until Hale started parading her precious Ruby around to help her chances. Every time I’m in a room with her I just get this fake feeling. OK she reminds me a lot Obadiah which means she’s probably secretly evil and about to stab us all in the back.”
The new consultant: Maybe because I saw this coming, especially after you called me in tears after flying out to California to see him. You still never told me why.
believe that you're a romantic at heart.  Even if somehow Tony forgives me, he is with Pepper. He loves Pepper. I think it will take years for us just to get to the point of being friends. There’s too much baggage, and I don’t know how to work through it. I don’t even know where to start.
Anthony: OK, they don’t have the arms dealer himself to interrogate because they're probably still scraping him off the floor of a random warehouse in Baltimore, but they have all the other bad guys. Really it’s a win-win for everyone. They found the Shield agent that was liberating tech because apparently he believed in the Watchdogs’ philosophy and felt Shield wasn’t doing enough.
TMNS: There’s also those that I was unable to save. Do not say, “you can’t save everyone.” I already had my powers by the time Uncle Ben was killed in front of me, and I did nothing.
Good news: I now have a beta reader again for this story. Katruna has taken over beta duties and I am very appreciative.
Maybe they were hoping that being in close proximity with each other, they would just fuse back together again. Somebody has been watching too much bad science fiction.
Tony: You know, I’m starting to think that you began with the Ross questions so you wouldn’t have to come up with three things we have in common. Are you that afraid of emotional intimacy?
Friday: 10 ½ hours, due to the end of daylight savings time on November 6. It is currently 2:42 AM in the District of Columbia.
Football Hunter: And then I came to my senses and realized I don’t want to spend the rest of eternity with somebody who squeezes the tooth paste in the middle and expects better of you then she does herself?
Anthony: They threw in schematics and we have an algorithm. Not all in the super villain category want to kill me. Some want to recruit me. Apparently, I make a mean killer robot. Also the billion dollar plus bank account apparently is my real super power. Most of them want me to finance their take over the world scam.
Therefore, she walked to the house where Sergeant Barnes was currently staying. She was happy to see him attending his sheep. He seemed peaceful. Almost happy.
I’ve already contacted the movers and they’ll have everything done next weekend. Although, I think Mrs. Morales will need to stay at her current job through at least Thanksgiving, but we will work something out. However, I will discuss with Mrs. Morales about staying in a hotel in the interim. Mr. Joey Gutierrez thinks that it’s best that she doesn’t stay in that house, and I’m inclined to agree with him. I think Joey wants to punch out her husband. Why do I feel like there’s a story here that you’re not telling me? I really need to work on my Spanish.
You're a kid, even if you don’t see it that way. (And yes, I remember hating the K word when I was your age). You should get to do kid things like completely humiliate yourself in front of the girl or guy of your dreams. There’s also Homecoming. I never got that. I didn’t even get to go to the prom until a couple years ago as part of a Make-A-Wish thing for a young woman dying of leukemia. Again, I was already at MIT by your age and well, I think half of the dumb things I do is because I was already in college by the time I was your age. Don't grow up too fast. All of this stuff will be waiting for you when you’re old enough to deal with it.
“We tried but we couldn’t safeguard the other agencies. However, as a failsafe we’ve put a whole lot of wrong locations and false information into the database which explains why they’re attacking DC first instead of Miami like last time. Although Yo-Yo is here and not at an engagement party in Miami this time,” Leo explained.
Anyway please call me when you get a chance. I would love to face time with you. Also, you should get to see my new apartment since I’m sure you’re paying for it.
When you get up from quality Hunter time or recovering from last night's science, call Pepper. For the sake of time, I had Ana contact her and give her the basics of what’s happening, but she probably will want to talk to you. Or maybe scream at you. It could be either right now.
Me: I’m trying to be as honest as I can under the circumstances. However, I have to go because my boyfriend just stepped out of the shower.
At this point, Leo is well aware that the future isn’t fixed like he once believed. He changed a lot of things over the last 22 months such as Stark being in charge of the ATCU, Shield not getting disbanded, keeping England in the EU, and his other self-marrying Simmons the previous year without being thrown into the future or past for that matter. Even Vijay Nadeer is alive and well, running for his sister’s former seat. By this point last time, the senator was dead. Now she would be spending the rest of her life in prison after being the first person kicked out of the Senate since Reconstruction due to treason. This was preferable to her dying a martyr. The “Superior” is dead, Bobbi and Robbie took him out some months ago with the other Secret Avengers.
Steve: Although I think I’ll come back after the meeting for a couple of days. You and Tony need to focus on the mission. I am more expendable.
Me: Well, you could always wait until you get back to DC because all I’m going to do is tell you to tell Phil that you love him.
Also a reminder, Laura and Clint do not use their children’s real names when they speak with one another.
Cuddle Bunny: I know that or rather I didn’t know that because you’ve only started opening up to me like this in the last couple of weeks. But I know a lot of stuff people say about you isn’t true. If you say that it’s Coulson, I believe you, even though I’m having trouble accepting someone coming back from the dead.
“I am not ashamed of you. I am ashamed of what I did.” He turned away for a moment, but Tony just kissed his shoulder.
Steve: Sometimes when you're half asleep, you call me Phil and I'll never be angry about that. It was my fault we lost. The Avengers were in pieces because of me and we lost.
"That I also got. Steve told me that it was actually a U.S. government program that you were trying to revive. And you agreed to take all the blame, even though you shouldn't have." Note to self, remind my boyfriend that he can't tell other people certain things.
Red phone: You’re right. And I haven’t been for a while. Laura had to talk me out of drinking an entire bottle of thousand dollar whiskey.
15 minutes later, Steve arrived to take her place, and Bruce resumed his interrogation. Steve didn’t really participate except when Bruce asked him if he was bisexual and to confirm he really did date a former Sen. Christopher Ward staffer. I feel horrible for revealing that, but I needed to know for sure how close the timelines are. (And that felt like a safer topic then the half-sister in Nevada.) I’m now 100% sure they diverged when Leo came back.
“At this point, I find it hard to believe the government will do anything practical. Who do you think they will choose instead?” Steve asked.
This chapter was written for everyone whose only criticism about Captain America: Civil War was the Steve/Sharon kiss. Tony is going to say everything you know you were thinking.
Agent Laura: I know about the list because although Pepper is still my Tony’s best friend, there are some things you don’t discuss with your ex-girlfriend. So I get all the sex stuff.
Nomad: I'm sure that you've probably tossed this in the river, but I thought I would write anyway. If you were just going to run away from your family, why did you even leave?
Tony: That’s between me and the ballot box. Although, when you had to save a guy from his VP that tried to kill him, you kind of get a very low opinion of the person. It has been going downhill ever since.
Nomad: Sam isn’t just in it for the cool tech. None of us are. I think your relationship with Clint is more complicated than that. He got us a cake. It said, congratulations for finally getting your head out of your ass.
"I will quake you if you're not quiet. Seriously, Leo calm your husband down. You should've left him at home." Daisy sighed, standing next to them.
Melinda: Yes. Leo and Daisy convinced him to be on our side, since it’s his uncle causing chaos. Leo also apparently made a deal with “the devil” to make sure “the Rider” sticks around. Leo is convinced we will need him in the future.
Nomad: The red one keeps saying that we should just have sex and get it over with. You’re my only sane friend that is still responding to my text messages.
Counselor Laura: After Daniel survived the attempt in 1955, Hydra didn’t try again for a while with Daniel. Mostly because the agent stopped saying things to his supervisor and faked memory loss because of the information GR gave to him.
I feel like there’s a lot going on because Ana tried to schedule me on a three-week vacation to Malta in the middle of April. I feel like I’m missing something beyond a missing Laura. Write me back or call me. I deserve an explanation.
For those of you wondering when the next chapter of Hydra Lullaby will be up, it’s coming soon. It’s currently going through round two of proofreading and will be posted as soon as I get it back. The reason why you’re getting chapters so fast for this story is I’m writing about five chapters at a time and posting when they’re finalized.
T Stark: You threatened to cut off my genitals, not in those words. Also, I don’t hate Pepper’s boyfriend. I’m a little annoyed that he thinks that Pepper was my beard, but I don’t hate him. I’m a little disappointed that she’s dating someone that barely passes the half your age +7 rule, but I am not allowed to comment on that sort of thing.
"Love you too." Tony heard Steve say as he walked out the door. It really took all his willpower not to turn around and run back in there. Agent America may have been holding his wrists for dear life.
Tony: After the Accords are renegotiated into something you can sign, if you actually do sign on the dotted line, Ellis will pardon you and give the other Secret Avengers a few months probation.
Red phone: The ATCU is filled with sociopathic bastards. First, they show me video footage of Nomad getting his ribs cracked to see if I would react. I didn’t because if you spend enough time being yelled at by the paparazzi and everyone else, you learn not to react.
Anthony: Friday stands for… You know what I’m not even going to bullshit you. Friday doesn’t actually stand for anything. I can’t even remember what I told the R&D team the acronym stood for.
I have agreed to assist her with her powers. We have technology designed to control powers of the gifted among our people but I believe I will need to customize the technology. If my brother can keep bringing broken white boys for me to fix then I should be able to help this young girl. She’s a baby. Thankfully, my brother has allowed it, despite being unaware of the true necessity.
Number one May: I mean the breakup with the boyfriend. Something was wrong about that guy. As well as there being adults there.
“I can do cake. Actually, I kind of need cake right now.” Steve agreed with that completely, especially because he was so worried about tonight.
Cuddle fiancé: I think we will be there in a few hours. I can’t believe I’m able to come back to the compound. Although I wish I was going to see our house in Queens for the first time, but this doesn’t seem like the time.
Me: Actually it’s kind of more than that. When Wanda was mind fucking us, before she was on our side, she made me have a vision of you dying in my arms. It is part of the reason why I thought Ultron would be a good idea. I can’t lose you and I make some really fucked of choices when presented with that possibility.
Anthony: Yesterday, they attacked the Khan family of Jersey City because their daughter can now change the size of her hands thanks to exposure to that chemical that is causing chaos everywhere. Those bastards tried to attack an 11-year-old who just likes to write fix-it fics where you and I are friends again under the pen name Miss Marvelous. Assholes.
Me: I realize that now that I really know you. But I wasn’t ready for you to know at that time. I didn’t even tell Rhodey about it until April. I was hoping that I would figure out how to fix things. Turns out some things can’t be fixed even if you are a genius.
Updated A/N September 2020: You're probably aware by this point that I write these chapters months in advance before posting, A/N and all. Especially right now because my beta reader is on vacation at the moment. I have everything written up to conversation 22 already and those chapters are in various stages of proofreading.
Red spider: The rest of us wanted to get back to the states. Robbie wants to see his brother, he’s at Culver now because of Stark, and Sam’s grandma is forcing him to come to Sunday dinner this weekend. She said he’s missed too many.
TMNS: When I gave you that speech, both versions, I didn’t know who you were, really. Since we’ve established I am Demisexual, you know I can’t be with somebody I don’t know first. Now we are close friends. Also, I didn’t realize I wasn’t heterosexual until you kissed me.
Tony Potts: Like I would love it if for once, Steve would say, “Sorry, I screwed up, and I need you. Please come help me." Why is that so hard for him to say?
Tony: Also, the situation is different now because the time heist ended up being a time kidnapping. Before they were just getting the stones. Now I need to get a mom back to her kids so she can make sure that she doesn't lose them, and I know you want Deke back.
Of course, it was only once they were on the Quinjet (the one that was still in Steve’s custody that was modified by the Princess because Tony actually came to Mumbai on the corporate jet), after deciding it was best to leave Mumbai now, that he realized that he was right about Steve bleeding. His boyfriend got shot twice by the evil puppies. Once in the leg and once in the shoulder. The energy shield couldn’t work quite right, during the EMP pulse, even the super-duper version created by the Princess was flickering out. Just enough time for a bullet hole or two. Seriously, what was he going to do with this boyfriend?
A/N: Arnie Roth is not only an actual 616 comic book character, but one of the first openly gay characters in the Marvel comic universe. I really thought it would be interesting to use him in this story. Interesting enough, MCU Bucky resembles 616 Artie more than 616 Bucky. Think of that what you will. http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Arnold_Roth_(Earth-616)
Tony: Well, my publicist is actually writing my version, but again, maybe I want to know how well you’ve listened, so let’s do each other instead.
Genius Princess: Deke wants to know if his Nana has drunk herself into a puddle or locked herself in the framework? He’s concerned.
“I really do understand. It’s important, and Deke would want her to get help. If she needs Hunter there, then he needs to be there. We can make other childcare arrangements.” Apparently, May was already making those arrangements for them.
SimmonsJA: It’s just easier to call everything Skype. I know you’re upset, but sometimes just holding Leo’s hand while we watch a movie together is better than most sexual experiences I had back at the Academy.
Me: Considering Jane just tried to take Yo-Yo’s phone from her, I’m going with probably slightly less pissed off then Mr. Patriotism will be about me referring to her as the new Captain America. Less evil Ross and Talbot really wanted Jeffrey to be the new Captain America. Seriously, they gave his costume fake muscles. How pretentious.
Number one May: Are there any adults there with you? Olivia is coming over to do a home date since we have Miles, but I don't mind coming up to the Lighthouse.
OK, now I’m sincerely regretting that we didn’t try doing this by email in the first place. That went so much easier. It’s not that I don’t want to know the answers to these highly invasive questions because I really do want to know you as much as possible. If we’re going to make this work long-term, we have to share our true selves with each other. And we’ve definitely been doing it with this activity. The problem is, we are absolutely horrible at keeping on-topic. If we were doing that last section by text message, I would’ve asked you all types of questions about your James. One of us would’ve misunderstood and it would’ve all blown up in our faces. See, this is much better.
Me: I will have you know that I did write Lily bear a hard copy letter just last week, mostly because she didn't need to see all the pictures of Clint black and blue that Wanda sent me. Laura also didn't want me to know about you being under a 5150 hold because apparently, I triggered you having a violent flashback.
Anthony love: In the timeline that the FitzSimmons grandkid came from, Thanos managed to wipe out half of all living life on April 28, 2018.
Tony: Stop saying that. Yes, it is that bad. Question 23 is “How close and warm is your family? Do you feel your childhood was happier than most other people’s?” And 24 is “How do you feel about your relationship with your mother?”
Purple Princess: OK, so alien invasion two Friday was Coulson getting abducted by aliens at the signing of the Mumbai agreement. Don’t worry, it’s been handled. They are absolutely terrified of my badass sister-in-law. Because she is awesome.
Steve: OK, Melinda said she doesn't want to leave Hunter and Simmons together unsupervised. She also has reading from the other timeline.
Agent L. Barton: He’s less of a dick now. It took us years of work to get him to that point. However, Afia is afraid that her foster brother will revert without her.
Me: BTW, Friday is doing some digging in DOD HR files to check for bodies. Although, assholes like Ross are unfortunately scandal proof. However, I am enjoying various PR people squirming to cover all this up.
“OK,” Pepper responded with a sad smile.  “I think that will give Tony enough time to realize that it’s not going to fall apart.”
"Because I am Melinda Gardner or I was right after the divorce anyway. Fury just gave you Phil’s old apartment and ordered me to help you acclimate. I showed you exactly who I was. I just changed the names. I really was an HR specialist working for the federal government who divorced her husband because she couldn’t talk to him about the mission that was her biggest regret."
“Shower first then food,” Steve said pushing Tony to the shower just after giving him a gentle peck on the lips.
Counselor Laura: Definitely, although I'm not sure if things will work the way we think they are. We don't know when the purple ass hole grabbed some of the stones. The Thanos in my timeline may already have some. Yes, you guys can help us keep him from getting more, but you might need to get some stones from other places to complete your gauntlet.
Director Snookums: Including forcing me to read your fake pornographic subterfuge text messages. Please stop writing those. There’s no point in you continuing to do that because everyone that matters knows who Cuddle Bunny is. You’re not fooling anyone.
Tony: Because at least this way I can use one of the remote suits to get him out of the rubble if the building collapses on him again. Seriously, a building. He could’ve been killed.
Tony Potts: Only when he was really drunk. Which is another reason why I need to not pick up the bottle even though it’s tempting. I don’t want to be Howard.
Cuddle Bunny: But Pepper was just working so it wasn’t actually like they were going to find out anything scandalous. I hate that people are so nosy in this time.
“So you really did christen him Leopold? That’s a little cruel to do to yourself. ” Fitz just glared at him for a moment.
On this planet, after six months Simmons gives up all hope of being rescued or rescuing herself which is probably why she ends up sleeping with the only other person on planet, Will the astronaut a.k.a. Hog Face. (This is also why in this story Fitz is OK with Leopold hooking up with Hunter. He actually encourages it.) But Fitz does not give up and he manages to get her back. For a while things are awkward because of Will and Hydra. But eventually they do cross the “event horizon” and get together and are at the point in their relationship where they’re thinking about ridiculously expensive town houses in the DC Metro. This is where they are when our story begins.
