Tony put a firm hand over his abdomen and took one last deep breath. In. Out.
"No, ah, what'd you call us? The Avengers?"
think I would have kept my mouth shut about it if I didn't want it? You have heard me chew you out about backwashing, right?"
" But instead, Tony just did as he was told, sitting up on his knees as Steve got up with him and then maneuvered him into position, Tony leaning against the headboard, legs spread, and Steve pressed up behind him. He gasped when Steve stuck his fingers inside of him, stroking him, dragging slickened fingers up to his clit, and Steve, naked faster than Tony had ever seen him, pressed up tight against Tony and all but growled into his ear, "Good
about a wormhole without curling up into a fetal position.
To his confusion, Tony just sighed and dropped his gaze to the floor. "Damn it," he muttered, and Steve's senses went on heightened alert. He tried to prepare himself for the fight that would come next, but a kid in his arms kind of complicated things.
Tony watched Steve clean up a few more piles of paper and assorted packaging materials before he said, "You want to be out there, too. Helping with the others, I mean."
, if Mrs. Rogers could stop being catty for five seconds—"
It was an odd feeling, and it was odd how...accepting of it he was. Maybe that was the point.
Unsurprisingly, Steve did not have a good explanation for it. He merely said, "Shh! Bucky's trying to sleep!"
He rubbed his hands over Tony's belly, and Tony fought desperately to keep from crying out.
"—a moody pregnant broad—"
"It's really amazing, Buck," Steve said as he merged onto the interstate. "You just— You have to see it for yourself. You'll never believe it. It's like something we could only have dreamt about."
When push came to shove, they'd been able to fight side-by-side, and the good Captain had even looked relieved and had smiled a little when Tony hadn't died and had started rambling on about shawarma. They'd come to a sort of truce by the end of it, and Tony had offered to put him up at the tower whenever he came back to town.
Now that he thought about it, Tony reminded him a lot of Stark — both in looks and in personality. Strange that he'd never actually given any thought to Stark in that way given that he'd evidently married someone that was so similar to him.
He jerked a thumb at Steve to emphasize his point, and Sam turned to Steve and contemplated this a moment before he said, "Maybe off an overpass and onto a passing truck or something. Or maybe a burning ship or whatever."
"Thanks," Steve said after a few silent moments.
Tony glanced down at himself, hand still over the slight swell of his abdomen. "It looks OK?"
OK maybe once a long time ago…
"Are you OK, Papa? Are you hurt? D'ya wan' me t' call Daddy? 'm allowed t' call Daddy if it's
calls him that," Tracy reminded him. She let out a disgusted groan and added, "Every time I see him on TV, I want to punch him, and I've only met him twice. Such a scuzzball."
Tony pushed the food around on his plate a moment before he felt a hand take his, and he glanced over to see Steve eyeing him then giving a nod in the opposite direction away from the table.
She just grinned at him, broadly, green eyes twinkling. "Oh, I think you already know the answer to that, Captain."
But Steve was able to gain control of himself again, and he nodded his head a little and said a quiet, "Understood," before he let himself out of the workshop, the door swinging shut slowly and quietly behind him.
She squealed with laughter and pushed against him some more. "No, 'm not!" she said through her laughs. "Pwease, Papa? I like it."
And, ho boy! The look of abject pity in Tony's eyes. He must have said that last comment aloud, because that's the only reason he could fathom for Tony's decidedly pitiful, "Oh, babe."
In any event, Barnes would be coming back to the cabin with them no matter what.
"Look, I don't know about you guys," Tony said, turning his attention back to the table, "but we all saw what that one that was in Loki's scepter was able to do to Barton — and I don't mean making him even more annoying than usual. I'm willing to give the guy the benefit of the doubt."
He was treated to all sorts of excuses by that, from Sam's
He huffed. "Whatever. I guess— Sure, yeah, that's—"
the child of Steve Rogers. I don't know which one of you is a bigger pain in my ass."
Steve nodded, and he kissed Tony's forehead, clapped Barnes's arm one more time, and then was gone from the room. At the close of elevator doors a couple seconds later, Tony realized he and Barnes were the only two left not just in the room but in the entire penthouse itself. It wasn't like they hadn't been alone together before — it wasn't like they didn't actually get on kind of well together — but Tony sensed, and he got the feeling even Barnes sensed there was something…off or weird about the situation — sort of like they were crossing a new bridge in their relationship and neither one was sure they were ready to take that step just yet.
He gave her a somewhat neutral look before he stepped aside and turned his attention to Tony. He folded his arms and said, "Bruce said you're thinking about just letting her stay here."
—" he put his hands to his belly, "— and yet,
"No," she replied like he should know that. She pointed at Tony. "That's Papa. Daddy's bigger. And
Steve didn't like the idea of living off Tony's money — didn't like the idea of being a 'kept man' — and Tony suspected one of the big reasons he kept up the Avengering gig was because it meant he was contributing and he was earning his keep. Granted, Steve enjoyed it, and he knew Steve enjoyed it, but he suspected deep down that there was a part of Steve that knew he couldn't or, more likely,
He'd avoided meeting the Capsicle at any point before he absolutely had to because, well, because he was still a little embarrassed about leaving him out in the cold and he still fucking hated the man's guts for ever having existed. The embarrassment completely dissipated once he finally met the sanctimonious prick, who seemed to hate Tony on first glance just as much as Tony hated him. Why he hated Tony immediately was beyond him, though he figured 99.99% had to do with the fact that Tony wasn't Howard.
"You think I'm more attracted to you as a woman?"
Steve didn't say anything to that. He just reached up and put a firm hand to Tony's arm that rested over his clavicle and held tight to it. Tony pushed even closer so that their bodies were flush with each other, and he tightened his hold on Steve and pressed his cheek to Steve's, both of them facing the foot of the bed and the black screen of the TV on the wall ahead of them.
more than I ever wanted to know."
They went into a small room with a table and a machine similar to the one Bruce had borrowed earlier in the year when he'd first informed Tony of this crazy impossibility, and after the doctor and Bruce settled on what exactly they were doing, the doctor smiled at him and said, "OK, Tony, if you would get up on the table."
When they arrived at the location, they found a big, old factory up in flames, several presumed Hydra agents running around trying to save themselves, and in the mess of it, a haunted man with a metal arm who looked to be the cause of the destruction. Tony, in the suit save for the helmet, grabbed hold of Steve's arm before he could jump off the jet, and he bored his gaze into Steve's and said, "
"No. You are— Jarvis — the real Jarvis — had an excellent French toast recipe that I think I can still remember."
"Yeah," he said, "but you're cute when you're indignant. Get all huffy and riled up."

in the matter."
"Hey, kid! Smaller sips!" he said and grabbed a towel to mop up the mess with. "Jesus," he muttered and pulled the cup away from her mouth as he wiped her face and neck.
Tony snorted a laugh and motioned at him. "Pot? Kettle."
"Good," Barnes said, "'cause you weren't getting 'em."
"It's not like that—" he tried to say, but Tony shrugged.
wasn't a factor when he'd first gotten together with Steve.
Good god, he was having a super soldier's baby. What did any of them expect?
Tony hummed a little and said, "That goes into the same 'bad' pile as 'fucking' doesn't it?"
"So, that was—? When I was on the phone with—? How do you know?"
Thor glanced between the two and said, "I am sorry, my friend," he said, the words coming out quiet and a touch humbled. "I see no way around it. The Goddess Esmeralda will not remove the spell that binds one life to the other."
"Um… You might want to run your involvement by Cap," Barton said, and Tony turned on him.
He held on tight, pressing his face into her shoulder as he murmured a small but determined, "OK."
She just waved off his concern but said, "I gave you that form. I didn't do anything else. If you're asking me if sensing your bonded is still alive when everyone else is telling you he's not is part of the bond that you share, I can only say to you: I don't know. You tell me."
know — what was going to happen, he could feel himself getting wetter, muscles clenching while his clit began to fill with blood.
"Touché," Tony murmured in reply, then shook his head and stared at Steve, resolute, "Look, I could sit here all day and cry my eyes out about it, but what good is that going to do me? And trust me. I could
"But they will. They're going to know, and they're going to come and take—"
"Does that mean it doesn't have the yucky stuff in it?"
are learning all the wrong behaviors. I'd blame Barton, but worming your way around asshole technicalities is totally a Steve-thing."
He grimaced a bit. "Yeah, here's the thing, I got turned into a woman for like a week, and then I went back to being me only not
"JARVIS, turn the lights off and close up. I'm done here for the day. It's Christmas. I'm going to see my family."
"It's an early Christmas present."
"Yeah, but it's my saliva and my enzymes."
married. Look, she was, what, four? It's not as though she actually understood what 'marriage' was. Clearly she understood what 'kissing' was — Jesus, she hadn't seen them do anything beyond that, had she? No, probably not. She was enough of a chatterbox to have let that slip at some point — if not to him then to Bruce earlier or even 'Unca Rhodey.' Poor child seemed to be afflicted with a serious case of nonexistent-filter disease. Which made sense for a trait of his nowadays, but he'd actually been a pretty quiet and reserved kid — the exact opposite of this little whirlwind that probably thought she ruled the world.
"Hipster?" Steve asked and hit the 'up' button because Tony had rather pointedly
Barnes went to say something but then seemingly thought the better of it and said, "Uh, is she OK?"
"I think," Esmeralda said, "what your bonded means to say is a very simple 'shut up.'"
He grinned at him. "
"Uh, no, that's all shit you're expected to do if you don't want us to jump ship." He pointed his fork between Steve and Tony and added, "Might be a good idea to get us to sign a non-compete clause. You know, just in case."
Steve quieted his laughs and kissed Tony's shoulder. "Nah, you'll be a dad, too. You can't stay like this forever, right?"
had shown up, and suddenly, all Steve wanted to do was get back to the fucking war and get a do-over.
"Uh, it's a little coffee klatch that Steve and I didn't know about. That's pretty much the definition of a secret club."
. She takes for granted that I'm there for her, that I care about her, that I love her. I can't… I can't lose that. I don't want to lose that."
Tony licked the remnants of peanut butter and chocolate off his spoon. "The one we were having earlier. About if you were attracted to me."
Tony motioned with the glass of orange juice in-hand in the direction the vagabonds had retreated once they'd taken their share of coffee and doughnuts.
Tony stared at him for all of a second before he ran off to grab his tablet, Steve muttering, "The hell?" as he ran past him. He found where he'd left it on the table, snatched it up, and was already loading up the requisite web page by the time he walked back into the kitchen.
Well, that was an interesting turn of events.
"And the only thing going through mine is how much I want to vomit," Barton said.
Tony puckered his lips and pressed a kiss to the pad of Steve's finger, catching a flash out of the corner of his eye just as he did so. He turned in the direction it had come from, Steve's hand still on his face, but the photographer had already turned and was moving over to another table at that point.
Bucky shot a knowing look at Sam. "Don't knock it 'til you try it," he said, and Sam shook his head and sat back from the group.
"Incidentally, J, I think we should refrain from in any way, shape, or form informing the Captain that his family in that alternate universe was, well, me. Not sure he'd be open to it. Heightened pulse could also mean he recognized I was making a pass at him — which, honestly, I wasn't intending to do; it just sort of happened — and was, well, not entirely receptive to it."
He took a few steps forward to meet his workstation table, and he braced firm hands against it and went through his equations again, over and over, puffing out breaths until the pain subsided once again. He let out a few quieter, even breaths, and he stood there a moment before he summed up the courage to stand back up again.
Out of the corner of his eye, Steve caught Jim nodding his head in agreement before he said, "On one hand, it's weird, but on the other hand, it's sort of nice knowing Tones got his own kind of sugar daddy that isn't just looking for a way to, you know, steal his inventions from him or kill him in his sleep. Or both."
"Just hear me out."
"That book of baby names Clint gave us," he said and turned his attention back to the book.
Hmm...yeah...this was probably unusable at this point.
. If he were to be turned into a woman
a boy."
with—"
Tony glared at him a moment before he said, "Keep it up, J. I'll donate you to Queens College yet."
Tony tapped the microphone. "Uh, is this thing on?" he asked, only to be rewarded with a little bit of feedback. "Yes, I'm Tony Stark."
Tony winced away from him as if burned by his proximity, and a mask washed over his face. Steve hadn't even realized Tony hadn't been wearing one until the moment it reappeared. "Yeah, no, wouldn't want him to—" He coughed and went back over to his computer console. "I'm sure he didn't. I mean why would he? I just showed you—" He began to tap and swipe at screens, and Steve noticed he was very badly giving a nonchalant impression of trying not to look at him. "You good? You got what you needed?"
"You probably already know," he muttered and took a seat on a chair.
Steve frowned. "But I'm not— Why would I even say that?"
Esmeralda just frowned at him. "I see."
Other Tony and Tracy shared a
She raised a disbelieving eyebrow at him. "You sure?"

as opposed to an actual, total stranger that has
"No," he said with a slight shake of the head, hedging a little bit and rubbing at the back of his neck some more. "I mean get yourself off."
"For god's sake! Don't Google and walk! You're not adept enough at it just yet!"
"I think I'm starting to rethink if I really want you as the father of my child."
He crept closer, making sure not to make too much noise that might rouse the bastard from his sleep, and he stood over him, seeing the mess of hair and the way his mouth hung open as he had maybe the first peaceful sleep in nearly seventy years, and he took a breath and murmured, "If you hurt him in any way, I will end you," then padded off to the kitchen.
Barton put his hands up. "I don't want to know what it is."
"Yeah, baby?"
She thought about this a moment then nodded, and Tony led her into the bathroom. He found a spare toothbrush and helped her brush her teeth — she did most of the work, thankfully — and he led her back into the bedroom and pulled down the covers on the bed.
"Oh, for heaven's sake," she muttered and rolled her eyes. "Did you not listen to a word I said in either of our past meetings?"
She smiled in what counted as 'mirth' for the Black Widow then went off to join Bruce to talk about…something, and Tony rolled his eyes because he might have the voice of a woman and the body of a woman…and he might have been pregnant…but damn it, he was still a man, he still considered himself Steve's fiancé with only one 'E,' and yes, he'd been a shitty boyfriend in the past, and no amount of Natasha telling him he hadn't been would change that.
He leaned down and pressed his lips against Steve's again, wrapping his arms around Steve's shoulders as he and Steve traded soft, lazy kisses. Steve's hands caressed his back a moment before he broke the kiss, and he pulled away and said, "If you don't want another mess tonight, we should probably stop what we're doing right now."
Anyway, to get back to his point, Tony now knew his gender was more...fluid...than he had previously taken it for. He'd tried to brush it off — no doubt ashamed of this fact — but Steve knew the experience hadn't been as cut-and-dried for him as he'd tried to make it out to be. Tony had fought it at first, but he'd eventually come around to it, not simply accepting it but embracing it by the end, and even now, he occasionally caught Tony staring at himself in the mirror, eyeing, in particular, the parts of his body that had been most affected by the change, putting hands to himself and probably just...wondering.
"Sex with feelings is better?" Steve asked, practically begging Tony to tell him he'd been a better lover than whatever casual fuck Tony'd had after their breakup had been.
"You—? Why—?
clearly
She laughed. "I meant it in the best way possible. But in that it was part of a much larger and more unfortunate event that was not of your choosing. That's what I meant about consent. You said yourself that if you were to terminate, you would end your own life as well, which I find a rather…" She shook her head like she couldn't even begin to fathom what that meant. "My goodness, the world we live in nowadays."
"Incidentally," Steve said, swiping down a page on his tablet, "you have another doctor's appointment tomorrow."
Steve gave him another squeeze and rubbed his hands over his belly. "I'll stick by you no matter what."
He folded his arms, grimacing just a little at the ache in his breasts. "Care to elaborate?"
"Sister."
Unfortunately, Steve wasn't watching precisely where he was going — his blood-flow being concentrated in other areas at the moment — and he kicked the ottoman, yelling out an undignified, "
"Yes, I did. I said, 'Hey! That looks cute.'"
He squawked out a laugh. "Gift? Are you kidding me? This is a nightmare. Look, lady, I don't know what your issue is, but this sort of thing isn't supposed to happen, and the fact that it's happening to me is absolutely horrifying. I didn't ask for this. I don't want this. I'd rip this out of me right now if I wasn't half-convinced you're serious about me dying if I do so."
Steve smiled a little, thin and somewhat bemused but with a hint of pain behind it. "Well, luckily, there was a war going on, so that helped as a distraction. But there were… You had ways of dealing with it."
Other Tony snorted a laugh and said, "You know, I can still remember— I was just a kid, but I can still remember my gramps throwing him out of the house.
Steve did finally show up a few minutes later, and Tony yawned and went to complain that he couldn't get comfortable, but Steve had another pillow with him — one that he'd evidently packed away and brought from home — and he came up to Tony and nodded at him.
"Good night last night?" Natasha asked, her hands clasped around a mug of hot coffee. Tony turned to her and, though noting that her face betrayed sly knowing, he still abandoned his quest for food, went over, and hugged her tight.
Steve was actually the only one he trusted to get him through it, to be honest. Not that he didn't trust the others, but Steve… Steve would get him through it OK. He could say that without question. He wasn't
He guessed it was about time he repaid him the favor.
Tony shrugged. "Kind of a little both?" he offered, which he knew was ridiculously unhelpful, but it really was the truth so far as he figured it.
"I don't even know where to get gelato at this time of night!"
"OK, fine. So…what's that mean?"
"Eh, it's not my
He scoffed and rolled his eyes. "No, I'm not," he said, but Natasha nodded her agreement.
, and Tony smiled and said with an easy shrug, "You have no one to blame for that but yourself. And, to be honest, you're supposed to be a tactical genius. You should have seen this coming a mile away."
coming here for a hookup," Natasha explained as they arrived at the top. "Just a girls' night to talk about stuff like boys and work and kill counts."
fan?"
They fell into silence again, and another song started with the line, 'And so this is Christmas…' He listened for a moment — this song definitely hadn't existed in 1944, and he doubted that Hydra had any Tin Pan Alley songwriters on the payroll — until Tony broke the silence by saying, "Did you mean that?"
Tony glanced up to see Steve arriving with a glass of something clear and carbonated for Tony and a glass of something dark caramel for himself. Tony took his drink and swirled the ice and the fruit around with the swizzle stick then took a sip of it and inwardly sighed at the taste of club soda and citrus juice just as Steve sat down and said, "What?" to Barton.
, not exact— I'm a little too
"It's… I don't know, it's hard to explain. Wait, no, it's not. Cap's perfect and Steve isn't. Captain America is this righteous, virtuous Sentinel of Liberty that you kind of try to force yourself to be as good as. Steve Rogers is a horny-but-lazy old man."
Steve choked out a slight laugh, and he grinned at Tony and said, "I guess that's a good thing, right?"
Jim just raised an eyebrow, and Steve shook his head a little like he couldn't believe how... unsmooth Tony had been, but Thor just grinned and said, "I am sure the Captain and his beloved put a great deal of thought into their selection and weighed the pros and cons of all of those whom they would gladly entrust the health and welfare of their daughter."
"Suit yourself," Steve said with a shrug and went back toward the kitchen. "It's OK, Buck. Tony's not hungry. He said you can finish it."
"That's stupid," Barton said. "You guys aren't finding out for sure, you're stupid to think telling yourselves it's a boy is good enough to get you one. And what's wrong with having a girl? What's the problem? You're both so dead-set against it. Do you see something
"Hopefully not too long," the doctor said, smiling as she stood at Bruce's free elbow and directed him where to focus the image. "Are you two going to want to know the sex of the baby?"
"You were part of it?"
— I guess during the war. I woke up, um, in the future. I spent a day in the future with you and with, um, a little baby named Olivia. I think she was probably about a year or so. Cute little thing. Stubborn as a mule—"
"People are going to find out. There's nothing we can do to stop it now. I didn't just
"What? He—" She looked at Tony. "She? I don't want to offend—"
," one of the commentators said. "
, J?"
"Yeah, fine," Sam muttered then whispered to the baby in his arms, "OK, as soon as I put you in his arms, you force out the biggest, stinkiest poop you can manage. Yeah? Can you do that for your Uncle Sam — your cool Uncle Sam—"
"Nothing." Tony shook his head and sat back as Steve got in the car and closed the door. There was music playing (he guessed he would call it music), the sound quality absolutely phenomenal, and the seats were the softest, sleekest leather he'd ever felt. 'Expensive' was the first word to come to mind when looking over his surroundings. The entire interior looked as though something out of a dream — something he'd expect Stark to design for one of his cars — fancy switches and buttons and lights, and there was a colorful screen in the middle of the dashboard. As Tony pulled the car up to the intersection and waited for the traffic to clear, Steve leaned in a bit closer to read what was on the screen. Bruce Springsteen. Santa Claus is Coming to Town. He
"It's nothing," Steve said, trying to sound calm but he was having a hell of a time keeping the unease out of his voice.
"Yeah?" Steve said and tried to meet Tony's gaze, but Tony wouldn't let him. "Well, that's too bad."
voice. "No, this is—"
"Should I butter them?"
"Well, not exactly, but—"
"I thought you wanted to be surprised?" he murmured, crumpling the small piece of paper in his hand and swallowing down something that felt a lot like remorse.
One hundred percent match.
Steve just nodded and fumbled for something to do with his hands before he settled on clasping them behind his back, and he stood there awkwardly and struggled for something to say until Tony said, "Shall we?"
"I don't think anyone could ever steal Tony away from you."
Tony grinned, even though he knew Steve couldn't see it. "You'll see."
me into submission.”
"Steve will do anything for anyone. He just has that good a heart. But you?" She shook her head a little, almost as though in awe. "I don't think there's anything he wouldn't do for you."
"I'm sure the Cap would be more inclined to notice something wrong with your prostate than I would."
Steve shrugged a little and said, "Well, technically, he outranks me."
He did what he needed to in the bathroom then went downstairs to the kitchen and saw a yellow sticky posted to the front of the cold and unused coffeemaker.
having a girl."
He turned his head as the sound of Tony clomping down the stairs caught his attention, and he turned back to Steve and whispered, "I will explain to you later," then smiled and looked back over at Tony. "A merry and joyous festivus to you and your loved ones!" he called to him, and Tony stopped at the bottom of the steps, looking completely sleep-rumpled and like he wasn't quite coherent, and he peered at Thor through narrowed eyes and said, "Yeah, this isn't Festivus, big guy, and under no uncertain terms will there be any Airing of Grievances on my baby girl's first Christmas."
God, he was going to have to have a
"Don't you want to know what it is?"
"Can you tell what it is?" Tony asked. Not that he wanted to know necessarily — he didn't — but he was curious if Bruce or the doctor could tell.
"Get out of my kitchen."
"Would you have been comfortable going to a beach looking like that? There's already pictures of us online—"
He shrugged, smiling at him. "Yeah, well," he replied, as though he couldn't find anything better to say.
"My passport issued by the United States of America, driver's license from the State of New York, Social Security card,
She popped open the kit to reveal a bevy of nail polishes in varied and vibrant colors and what looked like the implements to give a proper manicure or pedicure.

"Good to know, J-man."

"Really? That's catching on?" Tony muttered, drumming his fingers on his abdomen and getting what felt like a foot shoved back at him for his efforts.

a fucking turn-off.
"Yeah, no, I don't think so. I think you're only saying that because you know there's absolutely no chance of you being in this position, so you can offer to switch places all you want. It's not going to happen. I, however—"
Steve looked physically pained by that. "Honey, I'm so sorry—"
His ferocious desire to clean extended to the lab, though there he was able to get DUM-E to do most of the heavy lifting for him and Steve, catching him in the middle of sanitizing his workstation, just shoved his hands in his pockets and said, "Honey, I really don't think you need to worry about cleaning down here."
opened up in my workshop, and suddenly she falls out of it? Besides, I don't know if she's even actually my daughter at all."
Natasha made a 'hmm' sound but said nothing.
"Look, it's already set up. I've got the cake ordered, the guest list finalized, the decorations ready to fill the room from one corner to the other, I even asked the city to put on a nice fireworks show for you—"
Tony just stared at him, mouth flat, one hand to his hip while the other held the spatula and said, "If that's the attitude you're going to take, the door's that way."
Tony shook his head a little. "Could you be any more perfect?"
, Tony."
Tony shook his head. "Nothing. Movie reference you won't understand for a while. So, got the hots for me, huh, old man?"
He didn't miss the lecherous looks he'd gotten from a good half-a-dozen men that he knew were just looking for something to stick it in for a night (hey, he'd been there when he was young, horny, and desperate), and he swore one of them 'accidentally' brushed up against him just to grab a feel his ass.
Bruce frowned at him. "Tony, are you sure you're OK? Maybe you should sit down—"
Steve arched his eyebrow even higher if that was possible, his lips twisting in slight annoyance. "You know, you make it sound like I'm no fun to be around."
An odd chill overcame the room at that, but there was no breeze to produce it, the flickers of candlelight dancing as they had been in the moments before the chill, and the man or creature known as 'Viz' continuing to sit in his chair and whittle his piece of wood.

The speculation is now that Tony Stark is dead, has been dead, the suit is running itself, and I was having an affair with 'Natasha Carbonell' while we together. However, no one can find any information on this Natasha, it's presumed she was an…
Tony nodded and dug his spoon into the slop again. "Very good reading of the situation, J. Incidentally, you are not to tell Steve about this. Let him stew in his perversion for a while."
It was a song. A song about...the Red Baron? A Christmas song about the Red Baron and someone named 'Snoopy'?
Tony hummed a bit and said, "Fair point.
He made his way back to the burger stand and saw that Steve was in line but hadn't really moved up very far. He pushed his way through, getting nasty looks and a few muttered sexist epithets as he cut in between hungry waiting tourists (mostly, it seemed) to meet up with Steve again. He bumped against his arm, and Steve frowned and looked down at him, but his annoyance cleared when he saw it was Tony.
When the day of the festivities arrived, Tony woke up bright and early (OK, early for Tony, seeing as his bed was already empty) then woke up his cranky little helper elves and plied them with coffee and French toast so as to make them more amenable to helping him make over the common floor into something that would make Uncle Sam blush — balloons and streamers and those really gaudy decorations that sparkled way too damned much. There was assorted grumbling to be had that ended quite quickly as they stuffed themselves with Tony's version of Jarvis's French toast, and after cleaning up, Tony was able to get most of them to follow him down to the common room to set about making the room into a tacky love song to America (and Steve).
"I hate you," he muttered, but Steve just grinned at him and said, "Yeah, I don't think you do."
As Steve went about patting Olivia's back to get a burp out of her, he shot Tony a pointed look and said, "Well, I guess fortunately for some of us here, our baby didn't."
Steve just shot him a look, but Tony could tell from the lightness in his eyes that Tony's lame attempts at comfort and distraction were not just appreciated but had worked a little bit as well.
Steve…did not seem impressed by this.
Barnes glared at him a moment before he turned and began to work at his plate of ketchup-barren eggs, and Sam preened a little in what he must have figured was a victory of sorts as he set the empty bottle down and went back to his own breakfast.
"They say rain on your wedding day is good luck," Steve said and continued to read over his tablet.
"That little bakery in Brooklyn Maria got your wedding cake at," Natasha said, a knife and a stack of plates in her hands. "Turns out they take requests."
"She listens to everything we say and—"
He grumbled a bit and pushed away from his workstation. "Save it, but don't close it. I'm not staying up there for very long, and make sure they know that. If it's just because they need me to settle another Thai versus Vietnamese debate, the answer is neither. It's Italian. It's always Italian."
"I can hear you thinking from over here."
"I guess," Steve said with a sigh and glanced up to the TV again. He frowned, his gaze squinting, and said, "Didn't you have dealings with Justin Hammer?"
— didn't have a choice. There's— There's some fine print with this whole thing. Basically, I
, as I'm sure you both know him, and you may be successful in getting him cleared of all the charges of those heinous crimes, but you'll never wash the blood off his hands."
Steve nodded.
"What—
"But,
Steve had to admire the passion that Tony put into his words. He could almost believe they rang true for him.
for himself. He was sure the book contained mostly pictures of his old friends and comrades from the war, anyway.
"It is, babe. That's entirely the reason. You don't want to get a stiffy in front of a battalion of Hydra agents or an alien horde if I happen to refer to you as 'Captain' beforehand. Is it just me, or is it if
the pervert.
Relief spread over Steve's face as Tony got the words out for him that he couldn't seem to. "Yeah."
"Sedative," was all he said, and Tony, knowing he was in horrible pain but not seeming to care at the moment, frowned up at him and slurred out something that was supposed to be, "Did you save me?"
"Did I say that?"
"Think I know what you're going for, big guy," Tony said in the hopes of calming Steve's suddenly unsteady nerves. It wasn't a lie. He was pretty sure he knew what Steve was trying to go for here. It wasn't a sex thing or a kink or anything like that. It was probably very similar to how he felt watching Steve cradle Olivia in his arms, just a soft kind of warm and homey feeling, like he wasn't sure there was a word in the entirety of known language to truly do justice to the amount of love he felt watching Steve interact with their daughter.
that there's anything wrong with, uh, men doing that or anything, it's just if I'm still going to have breasts filled with milk, I'd rather keep this form, you know? I don't know how to explain it, I just… I don't think I'm ready for the whole…whatever that would exactly be considered— I don't know what that would be considered. Do you? I mean, has that ever happened before? A man nursing an infant? I mean, I know there's a theory out there that we have the parts because we used to do it back in the early days or whatever, and there's supposed isolated cases of it happening in remote parts of the globe, but—"
Steve just gunned it onto the street.
It was weird being in this body. It was his, and it wasn't his, but he couldn't deny that having the control over where to touch and what to touch and how much to work it was, to some degree, better than having to explain it to someone else. He'd even heard it said that some women had to finish themselves off after having sex with their partners, and he'd thought it an urban legend up to that point. Not that he'd ever had that problem with Steve, but if Steve wasn't so good, wasn't so attuned to what Tony wanted, and wasn't so willing and able to fulfill all of Tony's wishes and desires… Yeah, he could see having to do the job himself and enjoying it more than any man could ever possibly hope to give it to him.
"Fuck!" Tony cried out. "Where's Cap? Anyone got eyes on him?"
Her eyes went wide. "Do you have 'mesia?"
Tony frowned and turned to Steve, who looked upon him in horror. "Tony, no," he said, his voice firm but with just the barest hint of a terrified waver. "I'm not cutting you open. I don't know the first thing about that."
Bruce weighed his response to this before he said, "Yeah, I do. I think you're covering up the fact that you
Tony was about to say something when Steve's phone made a noise, and he watched as Steve pulled his phone from his pocket and made a slight face at what he found there.
Tony snorted a laugh. "Yeah, sure."
"Why should they care about me? You're the CEO."
"Steve
listen to that eavesdropper. Yes, that little tax deduction was ten pounds. She nearly split me in half."
"Careful! Don't move your arm!"
Steve reached over and clamped his hand over Tony's mouth. "And that's enough of that."
"Look, it doesn't matter what they are," Tony said. "They're bullshit, and anyone that believes them is clearly passing on low intelligence genes to their child."
"Because we're idiots, all right? Because once you kind of accept that you're in the type of relationship where you don't ever have to use contraceptives ever again, you sort of forget that they're even a thing. Not to mention the fact that, if I had even thought about it at the time, I wouldn't have considered that this could even go beyond, you know,
"No," she said with a slight shake of her head. "You're not ready for it just yet."
care about that sort of stuff?"
Tony and Steve exchanged glances before they turned back to him, and Tony said, "Excuse me?"
"Uh, yeah," he said through a half-chewed mouthful, "he kind of is—"
"It's not going to
He shrugged. "Yeah, but, really, is anyone going to believe it? We can say it however loudly or however much we want. Doesn't mean they'll believe it."
"She's been pretty fair to you guys," Barton said and shoved another spoonful of cereal in his mouth. "Not like the
Barton shrugged. "Not if they weren't careful."
The creature against him began to stir, moaning or whining or grumbling or some combination of all three as he turned his face toward Steve's chest and pressed into him. Steve held his breath — oh, God, had someone found out about his…? — and waited for the person to still, and soon enough, the sounds and the movements stopped. He relaxed again, exhaling the breath with as little effort as he could muster, and eyed up his surroundings to figure out his best way of escaping.
his type. You're like this perfect— When I saw that you and he were, you know, together, I thought, shit, that's — that exactly what he's been looking for. Son-of-a-bitch had to wait until he was in his nineties, but fuck, if he didn't finally find his match. And then the way he would talk about you, I thought, fuck, if this guy ever breaks his heart, I don't know what I'm gonna do. Because I actually like you. And I will…never be able to unsee what I saw."
She just shrugged. "Maybe. It all depends on what you decide."
"No," Steve said with a curt shake of his head. "There's no discussion. They don't touch either of you. They don't get to either of you."
Steve shook his head a little, but there was a smile on his face as he did so. He was pretty sure the 'Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice' crack had gone over his head, though. "Anyway," Steve said, "if I got my way, that would get us to at least ten."
He stood there and considered the pros and cons to being the Felix Unger to Steve's Oscar Madison then came to the odd conclusion that if that show had been on the air today that there would be entire fandoms sprung up around Felix and Oscar as a couple. Eh, he supposed people had shipped weirder pairings.
Steve just looked up from where he had lain the overnight bag on the bed and was unzipping it. "What?" he asked, clearly having not been inside Tony's head for that train of thought.
She nodded at the small implements she had handed to them. "Give those to him exactly as I said and he will." She then shrugged and added, "Or do not. And risk having no heir to the throne."
Steve kept his focus on Esmeralda a moment longer then turned his gaze to Tony, and Tony met those crystalline blue-green irises of his and willed him to keep his attention focused on him and not the screwball.
"I know how it happened, J!" he shouted, looking up at the ceiling as he did so. Oh, Christ, he was starting to act like Steve now.
Thor just stared at Tony, perplexed like he'd just spoken a completely foreign language that even Thor couldn't decipher, and he shook his head a little and said, "When do we commence with the opening of presents? I've most been looking forward to this Midgardian tradition."
He pushed his body against Steve's so that they were flush from chest to hip, and Steve took slow, even breaths to counter the accelerated heart rate being so close and so intimate provided. He just hoped no other parts of him would get the wrong idea about this — especially being so close to Tony. He'd hate for Tony to think — all right
"There is
Steve arched an eyebrow at him.
"Tony, not
"How 'bout we start with the easy stuff? I'm Tony, your husband. This is our house where we stay from time-to-time. It's Christmas Day, and I'm pretty sure all those presents under that tree are for our spoiled brat of a daughter—"
to listen to."
right and he
"Steve, they're gonna know. Hydra's going to—"
So, he scrambled a little, thankful that not even Steve was there to see his pathetic attempt, and finding no other choice, he reached up to use the bedpost as leverage, pulling himself to sit up and grumbling as he did so. He sat and gained his bearings a moment, yawning and looking over a room that looked even
Steve nodded again and squeezed the hand on Tony's knee just a little bit tighter, Tony squeezing right on back.
He turned back and saw Steve sitting on a chair by a different door than the one they'd come in and paging through a magazine. Being nudged out of the way by someone else coming into the office, Tony took the clipboard with the pen attached at the top and went over and sat down with a slight huff next to Steve. Steve didn't even bother asking what was wrong. He just kept paging through his magazine. Tony huffed out another breath, and when that still didn't arouse Steve's curiosity, he cleared his throat. When that
"Everything they do is 'married people flirting,'" he said like the entire thing disgusted him.
"He's not here, kiddo. Believe me. Just you and me and Uncle Rhodey. He's not going to get you. I'm not going to let him get you."
"You mean Tony whines and Cap tries to reason with him?"
Pepper groaned, and Tony tried to remember the last train of thought he'd been on. OK, the last one before the memory of what he and Steve had done last night. Fuck, was it warm in here?
Steve's face flushed red and hot, his eyes glazed and his pupils blown wide. "Maybe."
He squeaked and jumped as Steve tickled his side, and when he glanced back at Steve for explanation, all he got in return was a raised eyebrow and a
Barnes snorted out a laugh that became a chortle that turned into a guffaw that ended as a downright belly laugh complete with him clutching his gut and losing his balance as he fell into a chair. Tony just stared at him, perplexed, as he watched Barnes lose himself in the laughter, and finally, only when the tears were streaming down his face, did he get a hold of himself and sober enough to wipe the tears away and say, "Jesus Christ, Steve. Never change."
Steve didn't take his eyes off him, and Tony watched as he reached out and finally put a hand to his abdomen, his large hand splayed out over the barely-there swell. Tony hissed a little and all but shivered at the satiating feeling of possessiveness that thrummed through his body at Steve's touch to his belly — the first time he'd actually done it, but not the first time he'd attempted. It was a strange feeling; not a bad feeling, just a strange one, and one he felt all the way down to his bones. He was Steve's. This was Steve's. He belonged to Steve.
And so he took that as permission for what he did next.
learner, if you know what I mean. And he is
"I don't know what it could be. Not unless I get a better look."
"Yeah, well," Tony said with a derisive snort, "thanks for figuring out something Hydra had already figured out a while ago if their ultimate evil plan is to be believed."
But Steve was not from Asgard. Steve did not have the same knowledge and understanding of centuries of existence in the way that Thor did. Steve was dumb kid from Brooklyn that maybe had gotten a little in over his head and had now found himself seventy years into a future he couldn't have imagined and now never wanted to leave. It was an unfortunate byproduct of the elixir that had given him this body that he now couldn't age and wouldn't age and — unless he pulled something stupid — would stay exactly as he was while he watched Tony — his Tony — grow old and wither and finally die, powerless to stop it. And someday, the same would be said of his little baby girl and any children she might have were he lucky enough to be a grandfather.
He looked back up at Bruce, who just set a knowing gaze upon him and said, "You're going to bleed. A lot."
Tony nodded, and he took a sip of coffee and stared at Olivia's mouth, and after he'd swallowed the sip, he said, "I think she's got one that's going to start coming through pretty soon."
"Yeah, probably nothing compared to Asgard's pomp and circumstance, and sorry, pal, I don't think that's what they're going for," Barton said. "Especially considering Stark's, uh,
Steve raised a semi-concerned eyebrow at him. "Is this something I need to do something about?"
Steve went to lead them across the street, but Tony held steady and still, and Steve frowned and said, "What's wrong?"
a real doctor."
"Oh, really?" Steve said. "You actually remember hearing that? Because all I remember hearing was—"
Steve sighed a little and shrugged. "I don't know. Seems like beating a dead horse to complain about a ball team that ceased to exist in 1957."
Assured by the man that had been murdered by the best friend of the oh-so-wonderful Captain.
"Huh?"
"You're full of shit. Stop worrying, old man. You're not getting rid of me that easily. Plus, pretty sure Nutsy-Cuckoo did this on purpose. The whole making-everything-perfect thing, I mean. Now, is there a bathroom around here? 'Cause evidently, I didn't pee out everything back at the doctor's office."
She just put her hands back on him and began to rub again. "Because sometimes I think you're stronger than all of us. You're stubborn, too, but you're strong as well."
"Here," Tony said and held Olivia out to him. Steve scooped her into his arms and held her against his chest, and he waited for Tony to situate himself with the bag and shut the car door before he followed him onto the sidewalk. The shoes he wore weren't exactly made for the snow that hadn't quite been cleared away, but he was able to gain enough traction not to slide around. How Tony was doing it with his 'lifts' was anyone's guess.
"You're right. Who cares? So Olivia belongs to some other version of us. So what?" He reached out and rubbed his hand over Tony's belly. "This is
"Yeah, I mean, it's good for strength training and all," Wilson said, "but I don't know. Think the laser tag arena would be better for tactics and strategy and agility training."
"Oh, Jesus!"
For his occupation, Tony snorted another laugh and put 'team captain.' Hey, it was technically true.
"He just said he doesn't know for certain what happens," Jim cut in. "Just what old man Odin probably told him as a bedtime story."
. Because
Steve gave a curt shake of his head. "Don't like it."
,” Steve growled and took hold of each of Stark’s wrists in his hands again. “
Thankfully, she was not.
" Tony snapped. "What the hell's that supposed to mean?"
Steve just set his tablet down on the coffee table and turned his body so that he was facing Tony. "What happened?" he reiterated without answering his question. Then again, Tony already knew the answer to that question, didn't he?
"So," he said, "what's the story here? Because from everything I've seen, you, ma'am, are not Tony Stark."
stuff's not here! An' there's a bed!"
"I'm sorry, that's funny?"
He frowned, a dancing robot in his hand, and took several cautious steps over to the radio or whatever it was that the sound was coming from. He listened to it, noting the phrasing and the way the instruments were timed.
fuck! Now, come on, Steve. Forty-two weeks.
He screamed — high-pitched and equal parts startled and terrified — and stumbled back. He hit against something solid, and once he was able to focus on just
"It's a movie," Tony explained and grumbled as he tried to figure out some way of carrying the plate of bagels, the cookies, and the mugs without putting everything on a tray. "Actually, a series of movies," he amended and held the container of cookies out to Steve. "Here. Take this."
"Eh, we'd have to keep the PDAs to a solid zero then. Not as much fun,
"What's 'mesia'?"
"Whatever," he said, breezing past Bruce's statement. "This is discrimination! I'm being discriminated against!"
He pulled away from Steve some to get a better look at it, and as Barnes wheeled it closer, Tony saw it was one of his tool carts they were using, and on top of it was a cake littered in lit candles.
"I don't think they were," Steve replied. "But I'm pretty sure there's going to be a lot of broken glass and holes in walls when we get back."
FYI, there is sex in this chapter. Very badly-written sex. The stuff before it is safe (as in not badly-written sex).
"Of course you don't," she muttered without looking at him. "For a self-described artist, you're the most uncreative being I've ever come across."
She smiled, a small, coy, and yet somehow honored sort that revealed more than she'd intended it to. "Well, I guess I'll wear that badge with pride."
This was how Rhodey found them come nine-thirty that night, the table and floor strewn with sketches of plants and animals and robots and Avengers. Tony didn't even realize he'd arrived until he sat down on the chair adjacent to the table and reached out to get a better look at Olivia's War Machine picture.
"Look," he said and swung Steve's arm a little bit to pull him out of his head, "when we get back to the cabin, I'll spread my legs and finger myself and let you watch—"
the pain I want you in. I want you dripping and desperate for me to let you come, understand? Say 'Yes, Sir,' if you do."
Steve took a firm hold of him and made for the bedroom, and Tony turned back toward the kitchen and said, "But my sandwich—"
Bruce and Rhodey approached slowly, almost as though they were afraid of spooking him, and Tony tore his gaze away from where the portal had been and looked between his two friends, neither of which was doing a very good job of hiding his complete confusion at what had just transpired. Rhodey was the first one to finally speak, glancing around the empty living area and saying, "Well, you don't see that every day."
"You two are disgusting," Barton said from somewhere in the distance. "I want you to know that. I'm appalled by the fact that you subject us to this on such a regular basis."
"How do you know?" Bruce asked, and Tony scoffed at him, but he didn't lessen the hold on the kid any. It was…kind of comforting, actually. It actually felt kind of
Bruce sighed a little and shook his head, but he shot Tony a pointed look and said, "You're not that ignorant of anatomy."
Tony complied with the order as Wilson said, "Yeah, they're good at reasoning that kind of stuff."
Holy shit, what if— What if Esmeralda wasn't an agent of Hydra? What if she was an agent of something even worse?
him or
"Clint's right. You
Tony shrugged. "You're really the only one that can be the judge of that. I just know he's a stubborn fuck. He gets an idea in his head, there's almost no changing it — well, not unless
"Just wanted to have my Antonia Natasha one last time," Steve said by way of explanation, and Tony gave him a tight smile before he handed the bundle off to Steve and then turned to Esmeralda.
"See? And Papa says I never listen to him," he teased as he glanced back at the baby, who just turned her head to him and smiled and gurgled in response.
She motioned over him. "Looking like that."
OK, so it wasn't exactly an insult. Maybe it was sort of intended as one, but it was kind of hard to argue with the truth.
He chuckled, actually understanding the reference. "No, Tony."
"This isn't the good stuff, right?" Steve asked, dropping the broken fork onto the table.
"It is not such an awful thing. The bond between mates is so strong that it can work to better strengthen the relationships of those around them."
"I want— I want—" Tony said, panting, breathless.
" someone called out, and Tony paused a moment and stared in the direction of the shout, understanding it to be exactly what it was: a slight against how large he'd gotten.
"Wild horses couldn't drag me away."
"Nope! Not allowed. You said. Can't go. Someone might ambush me. Wouldn't want any vulture with a camera or a microphone ambushing me, would you, Steve? I thought you loved me. Would you really want me to go out there and get caught? There'll be pictures of me all over the internet Steve — really
As he stood up, his back popping rather painfully, he only half-realized that he'd oh-so-breezily referred to himself as 'Papa' and had begun treating this situation as completely normal — like he really
Tony Stark, it's just going to open us up to all sorts of rumor and accusation."
Steve arched an eyebrow and shot a glance at him. "You mean when you thought you were dying?"
Steve swallowed and looked away, muttering a, "Sorry," as he did so. This time, Tony laughed.
He pressed something, and after a few moments, the phone made a little noise. Tony glanced at it and rolled his eyes.
about him. You're—" he made a weird hand-wavy motion with his flesh hand and continued, "—
"A family," he said, a little flat and a little despondent. "Just a… Not with y—? She wasn't o— I mean, obviously. It was just a stupid dre—" He clamped his mouth shut and shook his head again. "She tell you that?" he asked when he'd finally gotten a hold of himself.
But Natasha set knowing eyes on Bruce and said, "That's
"I mean, it has to be a lack thereof, right? The man's older than I am. Can he even get it up?"
"Uh, was there an actual Star…War?"
Steve turned to him, grabbing a tight, white undershirt and pulling it over his head. He nodded at Tony's ensemble and said, "Wouldn't want to mess up that nice, new dress."
looked over at Thor and said, "Not going with them?"
"Antonia, do you remember what I said about you coming?" Steve asked, cheek pressed to his and hands still stroking over his belly.
Even Barnes got into it, even if most of his posts seemed to be vaguely insulting allusions to Wilson and what he kept insisting was his love of all things avian. Mixed in with positive posts dutifully tagged #LadyLiberty were photoshops of Wilson and his bird friends in the park, Wilson in a bird costume, Wilson hanging out with Big Bird (with hashtag #BFFs), and Wilson flying in the air and leading a flock of geese.
"Tony?" he heard Rhodey say from somewhere. "Tones, you still with us?"
Tony nodded and returned the hug, and Olivia strolled into the kitchen and looked up at Tony and said, "Papa, 'm thirsty. C'n I have somethin' t' drink?"
Tony exhaled a happy little sigh, his eyes falling closed. "Yeah, I guess it is."
He rolled his eyes. "Yes, god-fucking-forbid. Wouldn't want to hurt your precious
," he all but whispered, and Steve kissed his shoulder again.
. He didn't feel like he was missing anything. He may have been
Steve snorted a laugh at this but just paged through whatever he was reading, and Tony realized it was a manila folder.
"That's weird," he murmured just as JARVIS intoned, "
He'd got that. He understood that. Quite frankly, he was pretty sure he could figure this whole thing out better than Bruce could. He didn't know what Bruce was going off of to gauge when Tony should push and when he should wait it out, but Tony was going by his own body's tells and instincts, and right now, his body was telling him to wait a second. It would let him know — and painfully so — when to push again.
"I don't know," he said offhandedly. "Say I'm in a coma."
"What do you mean 'illegal'? They chip pets all the time, J!"
But Tony was different. Both Stark and Tony had that way of talking about things so far beyond Steve's understanding it was embarrassing, but whereas Stark did all that he could to hide his frustration from Steve — and sometimes not even — and had a certain way of being just the slightest bit condescending toward him, Tony delighted in having to explain things in a way that Steve could understand, his eyes lighting up and warmth and humor washing over his face.
Tony raised an eyebrow. "Paper?" he asked and, holding his burger in one hand, grabbed the straw for his milkshake and hit it on the table a few times to get the paper to break. "How does that even work?"
"Hmm…" Tony mused and reached up to play with Steve's hair. "Was this before or after the first written language was recorded?"
Not that he even had the guts to go back there. Not yet.
He didn't say a word. He just pulled his hand back and set it back on the wheel at the two o'clock position and continued to focus his attention on the road, and a little voice in the back of Tony's head wondered if this portended bad things to come for the weekend ahead.
Tony shrugged. "Whatever."
"Mmm...it will be, Captain. I do think you may need to revise that half-a-dozen you secretly long for, however." When Steve set sharp, confused eyes on her, she smiled a little and added, "I told you, I know everything."
"No," he muttered and went back to looking at the menu, "I found that out the hard way."
Esmeralda nodded and pulled up another chair to sit down in front of him, facing him. "I have a suspicion."
"I like this song," he murmured and took another sip of his juice. Tony's fingers didn't even hesitate in their rhythm.
a crapshoot in book-form. Steve hadn't been there, had missed it all, and Tony wasn't sure he would ever not regret that — not wish he'd been the most selfish he'd ever been and begged Steve to stay behind, to choose
"It was boring, and I'm tired."
; he was just who he was. Bucky had always been concerned that he was setting himself up for a lifetime of misery, thinking that these perverse inclinations of his were something he could control. But he knew Bucky couldn't understand because Bucky liked the girls, and the girls liked Bucky. Bucky's fantasies had always been about soft, supple curves and light, purring voices; but Steve…well, sure, he'd had those fantasize a couple times, but he'd also fantasized about lean muscle and lithe bodies and deep, rumbling voices growling with lust.
Tony's jaw dropped, and his spoon clattered against the bowl as it slipped out of his hand. "OK, first of all, can I get that on video? Seriously, no one else will ever believe those words came out of your mouth without you stumbling and stuttering and turning fifty shades of red."
Wait! No! Stop! Not supposed to get himself excited. Not part of the plan.
Steve shrugged. He honestly hadn't really thought about it in those terms before, and now that he had, he...still wasn't all that bothered by it.
of the child at the end of the gestation and not the gestation itself. Like I said, I can make it easier for you."
"Yeah?" he mused lightly and tried to keep any pangs of jealousy out of his voice.
regardless of what he'd said about never having offered it.
"Aye, that is the way of it," Thor replied.
Tony looked over the monitor. "Yeah, print it. Sign it. Let's get this party started."
Steve shook his head. "No."
"Well," the man said and, before Steve knew what was happening, threw himself over Steve in an attempt to reach something on the nightstand beside him. Steve held his breath and hoped and prayed his body would not react to that motion improperly, and right before he thought he was about to give in to the desire of want starting to flood his bloodstream, the man pulled back, something small and black and rectangular in his hand.
How old do you think I am?"

done the right thing getting involved. No telling what might have happened to Barnes if he hadn't.
He used to do this, back in the day, when he was trying to entice Steve to join him, which worked almost ninety-nine percent of the time (OK, maybe a hundred), and he wasn't sure if this was one of those 'old habits die hard' kind of things
"Starting to feel a little better?" Steve mused quietly and went a little faster and a little firmer with his strokes.
on TV (and the scene, of course, where the wife grew old while the Highlander himself stayed young — Steve...maybe almost cracked the remote at that but wouldn't let himself think about why), he found his way down to the gym. It was quiet down there — no one save for him — and he took that opportunity to run through some stuff he didn't need a partner for. He wrapped his hands and spent some time with the heavy bags and did some calisthenics after that. He thought about running one of the simulations Tony had written for them, but a check of the time showed it was nearing lunchtime, which meant Olivia was awake again, and he figured he could play with her until it was naptime again.
Tony tried to match her smile, but all he could see was Bruce, ashen-faced, telling him he was so sorry, and the smile died on his lips. God, he'd been such a desperate, fucking fool to believe...
he's committed over the years."
"And then you hit a certain point when you realize there are limits to what you can do," Steve cut in, arching an eyebrow at Thor.
They were the last two on the car by the time the elevator arrived at their desired floor. Steve stepped off the moment the doors opened and then stood there and held the door for Tony, who pursed his lips and frowned at the quiet hallway before him and said, "How 'bout we don't and say we did?"
Tony just stared at him a moment. "This coming from the group of assholes that thought it would be a good idea to buy me a fucking bra that pops open if it thinks I get aroused— And remind me again why we need a fucking
It actually wasn't that debauched an experience, their first shower together in years. Tony expected Steve to literally wash him off, standing there and refusing to budge an inch until Steve had soaped him and cleaned him, and Steve took extreme care to gently massage the shampoo into Tony's hair — Tony probably used expensive salon stuff, but all Steve could afford was the value- sized Suave from the grocery store — and Tony closed his eyes and moaned and let Steve take care of him like he had once upon a time, and Steve found it odd how easily they could slip back into these roles, how easily they could pretend like the last seven years had never happened, how Steve could once again become Tony's defender and protector and champion.
"What'd we have a membership drive?" he muttered then waved off the kid's confused look.
And then in an exploding flash of gold and lavender, she vanished, leaving the others to stare at the empty space where she had once stood. Bruce waved away the smoky haze that remained, and Steve turned to Thor and said in the most serious and business-like voice Tony had ever heard, "Is she just spouting off hyperbolic nonsense or is there any truth to what she's saying?"
She merely shrugged but said nothing to that and instead nodded her head toward the bed and said, "Why don't you go take a nap?"
"Should I carry you?" he asked, sounding
"Well, Pepper's in town," she said as she opened her purse and checked it. "We try to make it a habit to get together for a night when she is."
Steve heaved out a heavy sigh, his hand now dropped away from Tony's abdomen. "I don't know, Tony. I don't— If I could take it on me, if I could do it instead of you, I would in a heartbeat."
Tony was sitting in Bruce's lab, arms folded and foot tapping against the floor, as Bruce shuffled in the following morning, still in what looked like pajamas, hair mussed, and face scruffy with five o'clock shadow. He yawned a little and scratched at his chest as he spied Tony sitting beside the table, and he shuffled over, slowly, like a fucking turtle in a race against a hare, and said, "You know, we really didn't have to do it
The doors closed, and Natasha turned to Tony and said, "I hope you like this dress. It probably the most expensive piece of clothing you've ever bought."
"I know you're trying to be funny," Tony said as he shoved another bite in his mouth and went for more. He chewed the bite some then said, "But it honest-to-god does taste better from Steve's plate. He and I had the same thing, and his tastes ten-times better than mine."
Steve just stood there, hand on his belly, and smiled. "Yeah," he said as the little creature thumped against him a few more times, and Tony would be lying if he said there wasn't something equal parts comforting and pleasurable about the way Steve's firm hand sat against his abdomen, both possessive and protective. He moved his hand so it sat atop Steve's, and they stood there, together, hands over each other until the movement settled again.
"—and you're mad at me about that." He tilted his head. "Or is it something more? Is it because you were forced to make a choice between seeing if I was OK and chasing after your precious Bucky, and you went with the option you felt forced into, not the one that you wanted."
She yawned a little and allowed Tony to pull her purple Avengers t-shirt over her head, and he folded it and set it aside before he got her to wiggle out of her jeans with the colorful flowers etched onto the pockets and set them aside as well. He pulled the black Pink Floyd t-shirt over her head and threaded her small arms through the sleeves, and she was swimming in it, but it was only to sleep in.
"OK, first of all," Tony said, "they're not officially engaged yet. Second of all, why the hell not?"
Lord, you're wet. That had better be because of me."
," Steve said again, and Tony sighed and said, "Yeah, right," and replayed his previous train of thought to try and find out where he'd fallen off the rails.
Steve chewed his food a moment before he looked up at Tony. "We're going to have to think about expanding."
Steve looked like Tony had just ripped his guts out from him, face fallen, eyes pained. "I really wish you wouldn't."
"Why? Is it something that's going to get you into trouble?"
"For this sort of thing?" Steve murmured, disbelief evident in his voice, and Tony shot a glance at him and said, "Well?"
He wondered only briefly what that had to do with anything before hope suddenly began to overtake what had once been sadness.
it, all right? Steve's alive. Steve's not dead. Steve's coming home."
Tony arched an eyebrow at him. "I thought you didn't see anything?"
cold but it wasn't shriveled, either. Fucking prick.
" he sputtered, but Cap just shrugged a little.
Tony shrugged and grabbed the pancakes again. "Yeah," he said and shoved a bite in his mouth. "Bu' wike uh shaid," he said through the mouthful, "twial wun."
confirmed attendees for the opening."
be so sure of myself?"
around for miles. No one to hear us scream. No one to help us. No one to call for help. If anything happened to us—"
"It probably doesn't mean anything," he said, "and even if it did, it's just…he probably just wants to catch up, see how things have been the past several years."
Tony, I don't think you should feed her yet."
Steve came back over, and he peered over Tony's shoulder and said, "What are you doing?"
The countdown was on.
"Yeah, and that's a story I'd like to hear someday, you know."
She rushed to catch up with him, and she reached up and took hold of his hand. He stopped in his tracks a moment as he realized the disturbing naturalness of what had just happened, but Olivia was too busy looking at his hand and frowning.
"What I think everyone's trying to say," Hill said quietly and contemplatively, "is that for as much as we tease you about being cheesy or sweet or gross with each other, we all kind of rely on you to be that way now because it's something stable and something we can count on even when things aren't looking so great in the outside world."
A nursery. Good god, the boozy playboy he'd once been would never believe it. Or, if he did, he'd be trying to figure out how much it would cost to make the whole thing go away. Because that man could never, in his wildest dreams, have imagined he'd be the one knocked up—
Jesus fuck, in some alternate universe he was married to Captain fucking America. In some alternate universe, Steve Rogers was his husband. In some alternate universe, he was…
"It's been twelve hours, I'm going crazy here, now
"I'm not doing that, Tony," Bruce said with a shake of his head. "And if you're really so set on getting Olivia back home where she belongs, I think your best bet is to stay as sober as possible."
Natasha shook her head. "No need to explain. She's your daughter. You gave birth to her."
Natasha just stared at him. "You have more familiarity with those movies than I do, apparently."
Steve's jaw did that grinding little twitch it did whenever he heard upsetting news, and Hill gave her most disappointed shake of the head. Barton sat there, his face gone slightly ashen, and he blinked a few times but said, "Yeah, I said that, but it wasn't about— It wasn't about
He rubbed his belly, hoping to soothe the rambunctious kraken that was busy doing his daily calisthenics, and he smiled a little and wished Howard had been able to see this. Just once. Just for one day see what his 'greatest creation' had done to his 'greatest disappointment.' He supposed looking like this it lost some of its punch, but then, looking like this had to count for something, right?
bad, but oh, boy, did he have a moustache!). Yes, he wore makeup, but he
Both clerks nodded and made utterances to their understanding, and Steve glanced around and said, "
And maybe he had previously misjudged just
"Sorry," Steve said, finding he did actually mean it somewhat.
Steve chuckled a little and stabbed at an egg yolk with a slice of bacon. "Yeah," he said, "I guess the 'dame' part's only half-right."
So, the whole point of the matter was that he really didn't think he could stand being so close to Tony in so intimate a setting and not… Look, he could control his urges and impulses as well as anyone, so he wasn't about to compromise Tony in any way. It wasn't the physical aspect of it that scared him; it was the emotional aspect. Holding Tony in his arms, swaying with him to a romantic rhythm — his heart was sure to take it as more than it was, and he knew his heart couldn't take the rejection when Tony pulled away, said, "You're not terrible," and then laughed about it with him later on as though it had meant nothing to him. And it
"I knew you were a kinky SOB," Bucky said, looking at Steve like he was equal parts accusing him and proud of him.
While Bruce went to go get the swab, Tony was able to stew in his anger and remorse — or
if he did or not.
"Forty-five."
"Are they real?" Tony asked, still not sure how to take Steve's reaction. "I mean are they the Real McCoy?"
"He said, and I quote, 'I think you've put on too much weight.'"
"All the written ones," Hill replied, even and businesslike. "I have about five messages on my phone from Trish Walker's producer. I'm not even sure how she got the number."
The son-of-a-bitch laughed.
" he cried, sitting up fast — or as fast as he could, anyway. He had a way-too-big belly weighing him down. "
"I know," Tony said, "but you know the media, Steve. You've dealt with them. You know what vultures they are. And you know what the public is like. Wouldn't you rather it be something under our control rather than something that's taken from us against our will?"
But Steve ignored him and said, "Here, doll baby, watch," and began to pull on the phone to tug it around. Olivia watched for all of three seconds before she decided she had to tug it around, too, but either her coordination needed help or she didn't know her own strength, as she tugged it too hard and sent it flipping upside down.
"You ever heard 'Take Me Out to the Ball Game'? 'Root, root, root for the home team'?"
Pepper blinked and nodded. "OK. OK, honey, we'll — we'll get him." She turned to the front and said, "Happy, drive. Tower, now."
"Agreed," he said and gave a firm nod as he sprinkled sugar on a Santa. "But I just...I don't think you should get too set on her going to MIT. That might not be what interests her. She might be more interested in law or medicine or music."
What else could he say? What else was he
"It doesn't hurt," he said with a breezy shrug.
" Barnes asked, genuinely confused.
Steve just frowned and reached out to take gentle hold of his wrist. "I know, honey. I'm so—"
"I was actually talking to the baby, but I'm glad to see you're coming around on my ability to take care of our child."
No one answered him back. The blonde host with the Stepford eyes just continued to prattle about bullshit she couldn't possibly understand (but it sold, didn't it? It brought in the ratings the network heads clearly wanted) and Tony looked for anything in arm's reach he could throw at her perfectly-coiffed head. He'd just be breaking his own screen, but he could imagine it hitting her square between her soul-dead eyes.
Steve exhaled a breath that Tony knew was shaping up to be the onset of a lecture, and before Steve could even get a word out, Tony leaned closer to the desk and said, "Yeah,
She folded her arms and stared him down. "With Steve."
Ordinarily, Tony would take that opportunity to tease him, some sort of sultry, "
"Whatever, kid. Tell whoever you want."
"It's
"Yeah," Tony said and adjusted the baby's weight in his arms, "he's going to be pissed at you guys. You know that, right? And you know who's going to hear about it?"
"Indeed!" Thor said, chiming in to the conversation. "Anthony is quite talented in the culinary arts. Steven and Olivia Louise are both very lucky indeed."
"Yeah, mini lights come in after a while — the incandescent ones — and then they got replaced by LEDs. I think you like the incandescents better, but you humor me with the LEDs."
"Yes, Steve."
"Reason for today's visit," he murmured aloud.

Not that he'd ever

to wear either of those things?"
He had a goddamned job to do. He was a fucking Avenger, no matter what he'd done a little over a day ago. And hell, didn't pioneer women drop a kid in the morning and go back to working the land in the afternoon? If the pioneer women of old could do it, then fuck it, so could he.
Barnes took a breath, hesitating and refusing to look at Tony before he continued, "They got him— They found him."
you're not really a woman," she continued, "and he knows you want to go back to the way you were, but there's a part of him that just sees this whole thing on the surface, and maybe it is just an old-fashioned sense that's completely ingrained in him and will never be fully wiped, but he sees you as the person — the
"This is my mark. This says you belong to me, that you're mine, that no one else can have you, can touch you this way. Everyone knows it. Everyone sees it. Everyone knows that you're mine and this is mine and you belong to me. That you've been spoken for. That I've done this to you."
Pepper took the seat beside him. She glanced around and said, "Most of them are on the dance floor, it looks like. Happy's over with Rhodey and Bruce." She turned back to Tony, and she exhaled a breath and smiled and said, "So!"
Steve just frowned, a deep furrow forming between his brows. "Is there any of your stuff left in the fridge?"
"French toast?" he tried.
The deputy clerk just raised an eyebrow as she glanced between Steve and Tony later the next afternoon.
"Yeah, well," Steve said with a shrug, fidgety and nervous like Tony was wasting precious time they didn't have. Judging by the suddenly noticeable bulge in Steve's pants, maybe they didn't.
"What troubles you? You have your bonded. You have a child born of that bond. You want for nothing. What troubles you?"
"I think we need to talk."
Something weird constricted in Tony's chest at that. There was a funny tone to the Cap's voice as he admitted that he couldn't sleep, and Tony knew it wasn't something as simple as just not being able to sleep. There was more to it, probably more than even the Cap wanted to admit to himself at that moment in time, and Tony, god help him, almost offered to help him work through that.
"See! I knew it was me," he said and looked to Steve for confirmation. Steve just raised an eyebrow at him but said nothing, and Natasha rolled her eyes and headed for the elevator.
The Red Witch stood from her seat at the table, and she moved over to them with a grace they did not think to be the provenance of such
"That's what?" he asked and waited for JARVIS to open the doors.
"Eh, we all need hobbies. Nat has her ballet. Wilson does group therapy. Bruce seems to think he's a horticulturalist. Thor's a little
Wilson shook his head a little more. "Dude, CIA's been running her ragged, and she finally has some time to hang out in a couple weeks, and—"
"Why?"
"Why not?" Tony asked and stopped petting her hair.
"Well, I think you're both crazy," he said and grabbed a spoon out of the flatware drawer, "but I can't stop you from thinking that."

going to lock them out of the penthouse. He didn't know why JARVIS continued to allow it, though he knew if he asked, JARVIS would give him some sarcastic answer implying that, well, Tony had never
He was stopped from saying anything more by Natasha's mouth on his again, but this time, she'd leaned over and grabbed his face with both hands, crushing their mouths together and using his surprise to slip her tongue into his mouth. She moved her hands from his face down his neck and then over his breasts, and he squeezed his eyes shut and tried to look as into it as he possibly could as Natasha groped his breasts, pushing herself against him as she plundered his mouth with her tongue. Before he knew it, Natasha had crawled onto his lap and was straddling him, and she broke the kiss and grinned down at him, her hands moving from his breasts down over his abdomen and toward his pelvis.
"Tony—"
. The things Buck and I could only dream about when we were kids actually coming to life. But I just… I think it's because I didn't… It didn't go by slowly for me, you know? Naturally. It was there one minute and gone the next, and I think… Maybe it's just that I never got to say 'goodbye' to it. Yeah, I thought I was going to die when I put that plane down, but I thought that would be it. I didn't think I'd wake up seventy years in the future and just…be expected to pick up and start living again."
Steve just blinked at him. Mesmerizing but confusing as all get-out.
Tony opened his mouth to answer, but no sound came out, and Steve said, "No, actually, we're waiting to be surprised."
ashamed at what he'd just said. However, Rhodey didn't help matters as he said, "To be fair, Tones, you are the one in the white dress."
The peanut gallery groaned at this, and it served them fucking right for this shit. He was definitely going to pay them back for this. Somehow. Who was most likely to get married next?
"Bucky," he replied easily then glanced up and met Tony's eyes in a slightly more meaningful stare. "Buck doesn't know the history of that, so…"
It was horrifying.
. Because this is what my life is now. This is what I'm relegated to. I'm a plaything to some nutcase from the cosmos. And
"Oh," Tony said with a knowing nod. He exhaled a breath then unfolded his arms and reached out to take Steve's hands in his. "Honey, I've told you a
"That man tooked it," she said and folded her arms. "I know he did."
"But you'll work on it? You'll try to help him? You'll try to fix it?"
" Wilson hollered out one more time, but her gaze didn't waver from where it had locked with Tony's, and Tony stared into her placid green eyes and realized he couldn't do it. He couldn't ask Steve to stay. Not when he didn't know how long it would take, and not when Steve could be of better use elsewhere.
"Hey! Hey, Tony! Hey, look at me!"
"And besides, if Barton says it's a girl, then clearly, it's a boy."
"Is it yours?"
"Not sure what the answer was for all the other times it happened," Happy said, and Pepper smirked and rolled her eyes while Tony frowned and said, "Did you two kidnap me just to abuse me and hurt my feelings?"
"OK, look, but you didn't hear it from me."
"Ah, don't worry," he said with a wink. "Pocket change. You look like the type of woman that likes to be taken care of, and I could take care of you
"I don't care!" he cried. "He should know what a disgusting son-of-a-bitch you are!"
"It wasn't you. It was the Winter Soldier," Tony repeated like an automaton, still refusing to look at him.
Bruce snorted out a laugh but didn't say anything.
They filed in, one after the other, late one afternoon, chattering animatedly with each other and slapping themselves on the back for a job well done. Even Barnes and Wilson seemed to be acting normal toward each other, and they all took what Tony sadly realized had become their 'assigned seats' in the living room as they told the tale of how they'd kicked the asses of a bunch of kids from NYU.
"We are
"You didn't see nothin'."
Steve shot him a flat but amused sort of look and pulled a pair of baggy sweatpants out of the drawer. "Let me just find out what's going on. It could be nothing."
"Uh, seven months," he said, breezily, after he'd turned back to the microphone.
Natasha just closed her door and folded her arms. "In what way?" she asked as she made her way over to him.
"Yeah, slapping some deli meat and cheese and lettuce and tomato and mayo on a couple of pieces of rye isn't exactly 'cooking.'"
Steve's eyes went soft and sad at that, but he saw no inkling of surprise written over Steve's face. Instead, he saw what looked like understanding — like Tony had just confirmed to him something he'd already suspected.
"They were friends that tried to make a romantic relationship work but realized they were better off as friends."
"OK, I'm finding a lot of places that
The Avengers had been a featured attraction of the gala the past two years, and this year was expected to be no different, no matter how much Barton hedged on whether he was even going or not or how much Bruce hesitated and said he'd probably have contracted some ancient fever that night or how much Steve claimed that he had better things to do than glad-hand and hobnob. They were all going, they were all expected to be going, and that was that.
"Uh," Bucky said and made a face, "it's not my gift from my billionaire husband."
"Will do, ex-boss."
Steve swallowed and motioned to the radio…thing. "That's not 'White Christmas.' That's not the 'White Christmas' I know."
Steve shot him a look. "I know that. I mean…if it's a boy or a girl."
He'd actually fucking
Tony smiled tightly at her before he shoved his bag at Steve to hold and went over to the alcove. He went in and closed the door behind him, pushing the button to lock it and sighing out a breath.
Of course, Cap didn't need to know about that technicality.
"Are you sure?" Steve asked, the tone pure Captain America. "Are you absolutely certain about this?"
"—she's not going to suddenly turn around tomorrow and—"
"First of all, what JARVIS failed to mention is the Quack Esmeralda is a fucking lunatic that, according to Thor, goes around blessing couples that are 'bonded' to each other — don't ask; don't know — with shit like this. She thinks Steve and I are 'soul mates,' and, according to her, every soul-mated pair wants to have dozens upon dozens of little Mini-Mes. Not only does she
A sly and predatory smile stretched over the woman's lips, her eyes lighting up like she'd just secured the scoop of the year, and Pepper hissed, "Tony, let's
"Look, babe? It's OK. You can stare at me as much and as long as you want. I mean, I can't really blame you for it."
"Jesusgod, Tony, don't say that!"
He motioned over himself like the rest required no explanation, and Barnes stared at him and frowned a moment then pointed to him and said, "So,
"Always," Tony said, not exaggerating in the least. He held out his arms, and Natasha carefully handed the baby over, smiling softly and cooing at her yet again as she made the exchange.
Tony didn't recognize himself.
Steve sighed a little and murmured, "How am I going to get you to believe me?" though it sounded like he was more asking himself than Tony, and that was the moment JARVIS asked, "
He swallowed down the tears that were threatening to bubble to the surface, his hands running over a belly he suddenly, irrationally, hated.
She slowly lifted her green gaze from the floor to meet his own.
"Which, until a year ago, he was a fucking important part of!"
"You mean the Evil Empire?"
He made a grabby-hand at her, but she didn't move a muscle. He sighed.
"Oh, so you
"Have you had a foursome?" he asked, doing what he could to swallow the uncertainty in his voice. Steve was a one-at-a-time kind of guy, and he had just assumed Tony was, too, but he could admit that Tony did have quite a bit more experience in that sort of thing than he did, and maybe Tony had just been humoring him the past couple years with his less...adventurous attitude toward sex. Not that Steve didn't like sex. He did. He really, really did, and he liked to think he had shown his interest to Tony in varied and interesting ways over the past couple years they'd been together, but—
He furrowed his brow.
"It's not something gross, is it?" Barton asked.
ever did."
"Steve can't think straight when it comes to you — no pun intended," she added as he opened his mouth to make a crack about her wording. "It actually worries me what he'll do if anything happens to you that can be directly linked to that witch's spell."
Steve just put his hands on his shoulders and said, "I just wish it didn't have to happen."
"JARVIS, initiate full body scan."
But Bruce had put the kibosh on that earlier, hadn't he? Oh, sure, it was supposed to be a secret, but he wasn't stupid, and neither was Steve. He still didn't understand what Bruce's aim had been this morning, though. Was he trying to dig the knife in a little deeper? Did he actually think he was
"Yeah," Rhodey said, appearing, thankfully, from nowhere. "You're not an Avenger."
"To what? Him or my stomach? I'm not telling my stomach that I love it, Steve. I will tell my child that I love him. I will not tell my stomach that I love it."
Steve shook his head some. "I just don't think it's a good idea…"
"But they still call me 'Captain,' don't they?"
"Do you hear that?" Tony said and motioned to the screaming, wriggly newborn in his arms. "Look, clearly you are unfamiliar with what that sound means, but I can tell you without question that sound means the tiny little person in my arms that can't do a goddamned thing for herself yet is hungry and would like me to feed her."
Natasha just shook her head a little and murmured something in Russian as she went about applying the first coat to Tony's toes.
"Yeah? I remember one time suffering through a two-hour rant over Ebbets Field and the apartment block that now occupies that spot." He folded his arms on the table top and leaned his weight onto them. "Not to mention the whole Dodgers leaving for California—"
