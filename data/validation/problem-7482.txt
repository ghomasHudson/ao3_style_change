Steve whimpers when the finger continues to tease his sensitive rim, then without warning, the finger plunges inside and Steve screams. He cries and begs to be let go, but just like in the past, he goes unheard.
Steve glances down at the muffin and picks at the little chocolate chips.
Steve shakes his head. “I can do this.”
“I smell him.”
Tony chuckles and allows himself to be led away. They barely make it to the porch before Steve is coming out to meet them, a bright smile on his face. Peter and Dodger abandon Tony to greet Steve with their own versions of kisses.
Tony winces. “That sounds terrible. Why?”
“I’m sor-”
“Yeah. What should I do?”
“When I first met you, I honestly wasn’t sure what was going to happen between us. I never thought we’d end up here, in this very moment. We were never supposed to work, but fate had other ideas and I’m so glad you decided to give me another try. I promise to love and cherish you for as long as I live. I promise to be a good husband, father, and best friend. I love you and I can’t imagine living without you. So, Steve, will you marry me?”
“They deserved what they got.”
Peter comes over to join him and this time Tony doesn’t purposely sit away from him.
It’s difficult to fall back into a routine Tony had given up months ago. Being back in New York feels foreign. His penthouse used to act like a sanctuary, but now it reminded him of a prison. It was cold and dark, no matter how many lights Tony used to illuminate it. Steve wasn’t with him and that made being in the tower so lonely.
“Steve-”
He slowly removes the envelope, but his curiosity wins over and he opens it up to reveal the images inside. He glances up quickly when Steve shifts, then once Steve is still again Tony takes the pictures out to look at them.
“The baby. The baby.”
Steve rolls his eyes. “Attending other people’s weddings doesn’t count. This is
“Mama, play,” Peter smiles again, knowing his cute little face will get him what he wants. And usually it does, but this time Steve’s too tired to give in.
“But what about the others? Uncle Bucky punched you!”
“Okay. Now get inside before-”
“Don’t move,” Rumlow growls in warning. “Don’t you fucking move!”
“I wasn’t talking about your face.” Sam’s eyes dart down toward Steve’s stomach, brows knitting together in concern when the arm Steve has wrapped around it tightens. “You took a hell of a beating. Super soldier or not you should get looked at.”
Steve allows Tony to remove the article of clothing. His breath hitches when Tony leans forward and kisses along his neck, marking up the skin like he used to. Tony’s hand runs up the front of Steve’s shirt, exploring the soft flesh. Steve can’t help but tense up when that same hand skirts across his belly.
“I’m just thinking…” Tony trails off, brows pinching together. He can’t tell Steve what he was really thinking. The last thing he wants to do is freak him out or come on too strong. Then another thought crosses his mind. “Move in with me.”
“You’ll get there. Baby steps.”
Steve bares his teeth and growls in warning when the alpha tries to touch him. The alpha surprisingly backs off and watches as Steve strips from the dirty clothing. He takes off each layer slowly, wincing from the action of moving his joints. The dirty clothes fall in a crumpled mess on the floor. The alpha kicks them away.
Steve slowly turns his head in Tony’s direction and his eyes flutter open. Tony smiles; he thought he’d never look into those eyes again.
“You wanted to know how I’m feeling. I still can’t really describe it, but the closest thing I can compare it to is drowning. It’s like no matter how hard I try to swim to the surface, the waves keep pushing me down. I try and scream for help; for you, but you can’t hear me. No one can.”
“Shit,” he curses under his breath, eyes squeezing shut momentarily before shooting open when a familiar voice fills his ears.
Tony is awake and dressed by the time Steve makes it back to the apartment. He’s casually leaning against the kitchen counter and nursing on a cup of coffee. Steve sends a disapproving look his way.
More tears are running down Steve’s face now. He never thought he’d ever have to experience the pain that came with losing a child. It wasn’t fair that this happened. It wasn’t fair that the baby they loved was gone.
“I know, I know. I just...have fun. I love you.”
“Yeah.” Steve huffs out a laugh. “And we can trade. I haven’t held Pete yet.”
At just five years old he was climbing the walls and sticking to surfaces. It had scared the hell out of Steve when he couldn’t find his son during a game of hide and seek, only to discover that Peter had decided the kitchen ceiling was the best hiding spot.
A small smile appears over Steve’s face. Tony’s encouragement never failed to brighten his mood in the past, and now was no different. He felt better about himself, more confident whenever Tony gave him encouraging words. And now he needed those words more than ever.
Pepper glances up and waves him over. “I know you’re busy,” she says and gives him a quick glance. He hadn’t showered yet and his hair was disheveled from all the times he’s tugged at it in frustration. Building a nursery could be difficult. Pepper ignores his appearance and continues, “but this is important. I promise it won’t take too long.”
“Shit,” Tony mutters to himself and he turns away, hoping the blond would leave him alone.
“You should. I can’t imagine being you. Not that that’s a bad thing…” Steve sighs. “We’re just different I guess.”
“I never thought that I would have a mate or pups, but then you literally ran into my life, and changed everything. You’re it for me, Steve. You and the kids are all I want. I love you. I don’t care what life throws at us, we’ve already proved we can handle anything. I promise to love you and our pups for the rest of my life. I promise to be a good father, mate, husband and alpha. Will you marry me?”
Tony’s words are lost when Steve just shoots him a smile and leaves. Tony huffs and sags in his seat.
Tony pulls away and leans back on his haunches to remove Steve’s jeans. He throws them behind his shoulder, not caring where they land. Steve sits up to slip his t-shirt over his head, exposing his firm and sculpted torso. It’s almost hard to imagine his body changing to accommodate the baby they’re trying to have. No one has ever seen him in any other form. Tony allows his eyes to linger a little longer than usual, picturing Steve’s taut belly swelling with life. A grin spreads across his face the more he envisions it.
“I know. Me too. But it happened and all we can do is support him. Yelling at him like that wasn’t okay.”
“It’s okay. You’re here now.”
“These are my new pajamas.”
“Why? So you can lose another? Wasn’t losing Peter enough?”
Steve is eventually forced to comply and once he gives up the fight, the fingers wrapped around his throat ease off and Steve greedily gulps down air. He goes limp and his eyes fall shut for a moment, only to shoot open when lips are on his own. He struggles again, pushing back against the alpha, but then pain radiates through his face, and he stills.
“Uncle Sam is awake,” Peter explains as he makes his way over toward the sofa. He doesn’t sit down, instead remains behind it and picks at the upholstery. “He’s going to be okay.”
. I loved this as a kid.”
“No. He wouldn’t let them. He was the only one who got to...mate with me.” Steve’s stomach churns at the memories, at the nightmares. He hated using the word mate to describe what they used to do. It wasn’t mating at all. It was abuse.
“I guess this isn’t a good time to say I told you so…”
“No, Papa.” Peter shakes his head. “He can fix you. And then we’ll go home. Please just-”
Steve frowns. The shirt had been orange with black letters that read: This Is My Halloween Costume. Long story short, Tony had not been amused.
“Yes you can. You’re doing so good,” Tony assures. He presses the towel against Steve’s opening, trying not panic when the towel is stained crimson. Steve is tensing up again from what Tony assumes is another contraction.
Steve gasps dramatically. “It’s Captain America!”
Poor Steve! It does get worse and I’ll add a warning in the next chapter notes.
He wasn’t a fan of the scary films Tony made him watch. He always liked to analyze the film and question every stupid move the characters made. It kind of ruined the fun if Tony had to say so himself. But he loved Steve anyway.
“Hey,” Tony calls out to him. “You okay? You hurt?”
“Me too!” Sarah agrees.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve leaves feeling even more confused than when he first walked in.
He decides to practice to himself while he waits.
“I don’t know. The mission-”
“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.” Steve sobs and Tony pulls him into his arms. Steve buries his face into Tony’s neck, sobbing. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry.”
Steve snaps out of it, completely unaware that he had zoned out and staring lovingly at Tony.
The guilt is gnawing at him, but Tony pushes it aside. He wouldn’t let it consume him. He can’t start regretting what he had done. Not when he had just saved them both.
“No. Just you. I haven’t even told…” Peter trails off with a sigh.
Bucky eyes him closely and steps further into the room, sitting down on the bed beside him. “Look, Pete, I don’t mean to be so-”
Tony nods and leans back in his seat. “Huh. Maybe your news does beat mine.”
“Morning, Maguna,” he greets her and Morgan smiles. At least he didn’t forget to greet her this time.
Peter stops fighting and stares up at his dad. He releases another sob. Tony wraps his arms around him, and this time Peter doesn’t fight back.
There’s only one place Tony knows where to go, only one person he can rely on for a time like this. It takes a couple of knocks on the door to get a response, then it’s opening and Natasha is standing in the doorway, a deep frown etched on her face. Tony understands her confusion. Here he was in the middle of the night at her door with a fussy baby. It’s not just confusion that crosses her features. She looks concerned.
Tony follows his gaze, then he lifts Steve’s chin and their eyes meet. “It wasn’t about me. It was about making you feel good.”
Steve drags Pierce back into the room he had been held in, tossing him like a rag doll toward the contraption that was meant for Steve. Alexander scrambles to his hands and knees, desperately trying to crawl away. It’s pathetic.
He avoids the fancy looking suits, not wanting to taint them with his bland omega scent. Alpha always said he smelled good and that’s why the other alphas couldn’t get enough of him. Steve wondered if that was true or if he had only smelled good for Alpha and the others. Would he smell good for Tony, too?
Steve nods but refuses to turn around. “I know. I didn’t mean to push you. That wasn’t my intention. I just thought I could get to know you a little better. Especially since we’re…” his hand falls to his belly.
Steve knew Tony would be an amazing father.
“Don’t apologize. I understand.”
Pepper sighs sadly. “He’s happy that you’re
Tony pulls back slightly so their eyes can meet. “I mean it,” he warns. “If you do this again I swear I’ll-”
Harley’s reads: You
“Nothing. My mate used to be obsessed with you. In college he studied you and wanted to follow in your footsteps. Even joined the military.”
Tony steps into the room and shuts the door for privacy. He takes his original spot beside Steve, careful not to disrupt his sleeping son.
He paces around the large living space, softly speaking to his son and rocking him soothingly.
“Fuck it,” Tony mutters and throws the blankets off. He’d sleep later.
“You’re quiet, honey.”
“I know, but we’ll be fine. This kid has more stuff then-”
“Fine, fine. I’ll make a list tomorrow. I’m gonna need Steve’s input anyway. Speaking of...how is he?”
He doesn’t give it much thought and he quickly sheds the tight t-shirt he had chosen yesterday in exchange for the sweatshirt. It’s a little snug, especially around the middle, but it smells like Tony. It’s perfect.
“It’s not fair. I did everything right. I made sure I ate healthy, got plenty of sleep. I never missed any of my vitamins. Why…Tony, why? What did I do wrong?”
“You’ll be fine,” Tony tells Steve. “J will be here while I’m gone.”
“I’ll be fine. Pete needs this. Steve would want me to make his son happy,” Bucky says.
They talk a bit about school, but after that there’s barely any words spoken. Peter sags in his seat and picks at his food, wishing he could be excused so he could go to bed. He was exhausted and just wanted his crappy day to end.
“The suit can wait. I’m sure Peter will want to join you.”
“Papa, wait!” Peter runs faster until he’s close enough to throw his arms around his father. “I didn’t say goodbye.”
“Natasha,” Steve’s voice is stern. “Go. Get out of here...please.”
At those words, Steve is snapping his head up in Tony’s direction, his jaw clenching. If he wants to say something, he decides against it and directs his attention back to Morgan. He finally has her latching on and it’s not long before she’s greedily taking her fill. The room is silent, all except for the suckling sounds Morgan produces while she eats.
“You were going to throw me out! After you knew how scared I was! You knew he was looking for me and you were still going to throw me out.”
Tony grows curious and rounds the bench until he’s standing on the side of the omega. Tony doesn’t know where the urge comes from, but he finds himself stretching his fingers out and running them over the black cloth shielding the omega’s eye. He rips the blindfold away.
As much as he appreciates the concern, Peter doesn’t want anymore condolences. It wasn’t going to bring his papa back.
Steve smiles. “Now I do remember that game. Haven’t played in years though.”
Somewhere beside him Natasha groans and rolls over. She had insisted they sleep together, her reasoning was she would be faster at attending to Peter. Steve knew it was because Sam and Bucky took the couch. Whatever the reason, Steve was happy to have her close by.
The elevator stops and the metal doors open. Steve’s stomach clenches at the two familiar faces that greet him. It’s not just Rumlow and Rollins; a few more of Hydra’s men are with them.
Bucky nods, though nowhere near convinced as Peter thinks he is. He pats his nephew on the shoulder and rises to his feet.
Steve frowns, not comprehending Jarvis’ words. A part of him wants to question the AI, but the other half is curious and wants to find out for himself.
“What’s going on?” Natasha asks and hands her niece a steaming cup of hot cocoa. It was perfect for this chilly day, and it never failed to lift Morgan’s spirits.
“You can touch me,” Tony tells him. “I’m not like him.”
“Well, yeah something happened but it’s not my fault.”
Steve had probably felt the same way. Or maybe even worse. Tony had blown him off, blocked him and acted like Steve never meant anything. Steve had needed Tony then just like Tony needs Peter now. This is the kind of torture Tony felt he deserved.
“Probably not as much as he used to,” Peter replies and takes a seat at the table. “But you totally freaked him out and I’m surprised he even wants to help!”
“No, no he needs to know. I...I...was...he...took advantage…”
“Yep!” Tony smiles. “This time tomorrow we’ll be in our new home.”
Tony smiles and leans in to connect their lips again. The kiss is short and sweet, but it’s enough to remind Steve that Tony truly loved him. It didn’t matter what the mirror showed. Tony didn’t care about any of that. Tony loved him.
Peter was still too young for Steve to notice anything strange about him. Hydra had wanted him because they believed he had the serum running through his veins. Steve didn’t know if he believed that. He couldn’t imagine his children being cursed with something like that. The serum aided him in many ways, but it also made him dangerous. A threat to others.
“I don’t either.”
“My job isn’t guarding muffins, it’s guarding you.”
Tony needs to stop doubting himself and believe that he can be a good father, but I understand his way of thinking. He didn’t have the best relationship with his father.
“I want you to ride me.”
“Doing what?” Steve questions and he glances at the screen to read the incoming reminder. “Your birthday?”
“Hmm?” Steve hums. He hadn’t realized Tony was still awake.
“Jar-”
“Okay,” Peter agrees and he rises to his feet. He grabs his backpack and adjusts the strap to sit comfortably over his shoulder. “I have school so…”
“Go!” Tony’s tone is harsh. “I need you out of here. If it’s between you and me then it has to be you. I already lived my life. You need to live yours.”
Sam and Bucky share a look before Sam replies, “It’s up to him. We’re fine with it.”
“I don’t know.” Tony gives a nonchalant shrug. “He wants another pup so I thought marriage would be fine.”
Steve nods and takes another deep breath. Tony takes his hand and they share a smile before following Pepper.
“I get it. I had a best friend too, and I’d do anything to make sure he was okay.”
He’s still unsure.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m sorry.”
“Sorry. I just want to go home,” Peter mumbles.
Steve pauses his packing when his belly spasms. He cries out and grips the side of his stomach, taking deep, slow breaths as he waits it out. They were closer now and the intensity was increasing.
James sits up and hugs Tony tightly. “It’s okay, daddy. I’ll take care of you. And so will mommy.”
“I know. I’ll wait. I just want you to be comfortable,” Tony whispers back.
He leaves, wishing he didn’t have to.
Peter pulls himself to his feet and quickly wraps the test in toilet paper before tossing it in the trash.
“Yeah. That’s why I brought him out here.”
“Jesus. You’re stubborn.”
“Text me,” Tony reminds and Peter nods.
Of course JARVIS knows where to hit Tony where it hurts. Tony squeezes the glass a little harder, fighting the outburst that’s dangerously close to happening.
Steve takes another deep breath and lowers himself down on one of the steps. He can feel tears gather in his eyes and he blinks rapidly to keep them at bay. Today wasn’t supposed to be about him panicking and getting worked up. He was supposed to be celebrating his son.
I have more drama in store so look out for that 😈
“That’s exactly what we did and now we’re going to be grandparents.”
“And I guess...I don’t know maybe I can...meet him…”
“Morning, honey,” Tony greets and sends Steve a warm smile. Steve returns the smile, though it’s not as bright. It almost seems forced. Tony frowns. “What’s wrong? Couldn’t sleep?”
“Then what the fuck happened!”
“Morning,” Steve greets, placing a kiss to the top of Tony’s head. “Hi, sweetheart,” he smiles at Morgan and gives her a kiss next.
This chapter wasn't supposed to exist, but I wanted to add some more cute Steve and Peter moments so I wrote this quickly and here it is! I'll update again tomorrow since that chapter is already finished.
Peter looks around at the sullen faces of his family, hating how heartbroken they all appear. Bucky and Natasha have tears in their eyes, and it’s obvious Bruce and Sam are trying to be the strong ones.
“No, that’s okay. I’ll go downstairs. He’s not mad, right?”
“This is some Sleeping Beauty shit,” Sam mutters with a shake of his head.
Tony shrugs. “I don’t know. We can get married tomorrow if you’d like.”
“You’re not the only one, big guy.” Tony winks and he sits up, forcing Steve to forget about the foot rub.
Steve smiles. “Maybe we were meant to find each other.”
“You never should’ve gone,” Tony scolds. Steve hisses when the cloth comes into contact with the larger bruise on his back. “Sorry,” Tony apologizes and slides the cloth lower.
“I finally found it,” Steve says.
“I know. But I had to take her. You were so-”
Steve’s eyes land on the teenagers’ connected hands, a small smile forming over his face. “Dinner will be ready soon. You’re welcome to stay, Flash.”
“Sweetie, what’s wrong?” Natasha asks, worry evident in her tone. Morgan only clutches onto her tighter.
Hello, friends! I hope you all are doing well! This chapter is a little on the short side and kind of a bit of a filler. I’ll include more Tony & Peter moments in the next one and bring in some more characters and drama 😉
There’s no response and Steve’s eyes flutter. A wave of panic washes over Peter and he clings tightly to his father, bent over him and sobbing into his chest. Peter lays his head just above the star in the center, his ears filling the soft beating of his father’s heartbeat. It reminded him of a lullaby, bringing comfort and washing away all of his worries. It soothed him when nothing else could.
He doesn’t blame his husband for the lack of enjoyment. Tony as always was beautiful and the famous glow brought on from pregnancy had finally made itself known. His hair was softer too; Steve wanted to run his fingers through it all the time. Tony was perfect.
Tony scolds himself. He keeps his eyes on the screen, studying the little human he and Steve made out of love.
“What did you do, Tony.”
Then when Steve started to show, they couldn’t help but get their hopes up. There was still some hesitation but they held on and continued to do so. It paid off because soon Steve was entering his second trimester. They made it through the difficult part.
“Hey, Cap,” Sam says. “We have a situation.”
The jitters continued to make themselves known throughout Steve’s life, and he was sure the worst case was when they welcomed their sons. Becoming a parent was both a blessing and the most terrifying thing in the world.
Peter wraps his arms around his uncle and hugs him tight. “Come back okay? Please come back. He...he didn’t.”
“Steve, darling, Bruce is here.” Tony continues to rub Steve’s back, making sure to add more pressure where Steve needs it most.
Peter sighs and lays a hand over his belly. “What am I supposed to do? I don’t feel...I don’t know if I love this baby like that. That’s terrible, isn’t it?”
Steve curses again for an entirely different reason and sets his phone down on the kitchen counter. He places both hands on the sides of the granite surface, fingers gripping it tightly as he waits for the contraction to taper off.
When they return back to the tower and inside the elevator, Tony pulls Steve close and crashes their lips together. Steve gasps in surprise but welcomes the kiss, moving his lips with Tony’s and wrapping his arms around his neck.
“No. Honey, you didn’t do this.”
Steve comes over to greet his daughter and mate. Sarah begins growing fussy when she isn’t immediately given attention to. Steve chuckles and sets Harley down, then he unfastens his daughter and takes her into his arms, kissing her and hugging her the way he had with her brother.
“Steve,” Tony says softly and their eyes meet. “When you’re ready then we can try. I’ll wait.”
I will update soon. Probably not that soon but soon. :)
“Stop. He’s going to get more info and send it later. I’m assuming this is for all of us. If you want to stay then-”
“Hey, Queens,” Steve greets, a small smile forming over his features. “I really appreciate you doing this.”
Steve sighs and hunches forward, burying his hands in his face. His time spent under Tony’s care was short and already he was screwing up. He’s honestly surprised he hadn’t been thrown out yet.
“Better.” Steve is honest. The bit of nausea he had is gone, and it’s now something he’s forgotten about. He still finds himself more exhausted than usual, but he blames his job. It hadn’t been the first time being an Avenger has left him drained.
The baby shower wouldn’t be very big either. Pepper, Happy, and Bruce would probably show up. It would just be something small and intimate between them.
“I think you’re thinking too much about it. Obviously you went out and had a good time and that’s the end of it.”
“Yeah. I’m sorry I missed it.”
“Thank you again for watching them. I’ll make it up to you.”
Tony’s eyes linger over the hand on Peter’s shoulder. He wants his hand to be there, he wants to be the one encouraging Peter to smile and have a good time. But he’s never felt so unwanted and left out before. He’s afraid to do anything in fear of overstepping. The team was just fine without him and proved that him leaving didn’t break them apart, but bring them closer together. Tony wants nothing more than to squeeze himself back into their tight knit family, but there’s hesitancy.
Peter glances at his parents, silently pleading for them to just let Flash go. But it’s obvious they wanted Flash to stay.
“You’re not!” Steve’s voice rises slightly. “You’re not,” he says again, this time a little calmer. “I need to do this. Look what I did, Tony. I tried to kill myself...and for a second I was successful.”
Alexander is an older alpha. His hair is golden and thinning in some parts. The suit he’s chosen for the occasion is nothing short of expensive, though Tony can’t help but compare it to his own. Tony wins that one.
By some miracle Steve accepts Tony’s apology and begins sleeping in their room again. Tony’s not sure how many times he apologized until Steve accepted and rewarded him with a kiss Tony knows he doesn’t deserve. He doesn’t deserve Steve.
“No! No. God no. We’re not there yet. And no I’m not embarrassed of you but it’s gonna draw a lot of attention. Let me deal with that. Don’t worry about it.”
With both of them taking a break from saving the world, they find themselves with more free time. Of course any time they do get ends up being spent preparing for their son. Steve didn’t mind. He wanted to be ready for when their baby arrived.
Steve eyes the alpha for a moment before letting out a sigh and turning away. It was difficult to believe the words being said to him when he had no trust. Though Tony wasn’t a threat to him, he was still a stranger.
“Me? Why? I have to go.”
“At least you got one good thing out of it. Please don’t hurt him. I know you’re not a terrible person-”
Bruce frowns at Tony and gestures with his head to follow him when he gets up from the couch. Tony nods and rises to his feet, muttering to Steve something about getting more coffee. Steve ignores him.
“Sorry. If he’s not then-”
Bruce can only nod his head. He was at a loss for words. It didn’t make any sense. One minute Tony was happy and on his way back to New York, and the next his face is on every news channel with a headline Bruce never imagined seeing.
“Yeah. Peter.” Tony tests out the name, liking it the more he thinks it over. “It is nice. So Tony Junior is out then?”
“You’re a good kid. My dad treated me like crap and I couldn’t forgive him so easily. You’re strong, kiddo.”
“Tony, I’m so sorry. I swear I didn’t-ah!” Steve cries out suddenly when his belly contracts again.
Peter takes her hand and squeaks in surprise when she lifts him like he weighs nothing. She was a lot stronger than he gave her credit for. And not just in the sense of physical strength. His aunt has overcome a lot of hardships in her life. He knew a bit about her past and the journey she went on just to get to where she was now. She was inspiring and uplifting. Peter looked up to her. He always has.
Peter smiles and leads the way. For the most part the tour is brief. They don’t spend too much time in the kitchen. Peter mentions the meals that were prepared together and the ones that left one half of the apartment in smoke.
If there was one word Peter would use to describe dinner with both Flash and his parents, it would be mortifying. And maybe that’s not even a good enough word to describe it. It was awkward, cringy, terrifying. Peter could go on and on, but he chooses to suck it up and hope that the dinner doesn’t end with Flash being beaten to a pulp and thrown off the roof.
“And then-” Steve chokes back a sob and the tears in his eyes roll down his face. “I had a little girl. She-she looked so much like my mother. I named her Sarah. I swear I tried to protect her.”
It feels good. It feels freeing.
Steve watches the banter with an amused smile on his face. It was these moments that he cherished the most. He loved his team, his family.
The AI sighs harshly. “You really need to be careful with what you say. Sometimes I wonder if you’re aware of the way you run your mouth.”
There had been a point in Steve’s life where he was sure he’d never know what true happiness felt like. When he was growing up sick, frail and in a world where alphas came first, he still had moments of happiness and joy. He had a best friend and a mother who loved him. It didn’t matter if he was suffering from poverty, another case of pneumonia, or from the bullies that tormented him on a daily basis. As long as he had the people he cared about most, then nothing else mattered.
Peter’s leg hasn’t stopped shaking since he’s sat down in the uncomfortable plastic chair. He lays a hand over his thigh and steals a glance at the young woman behind the desk, hoping she doesn’t pick up on his nervous energy. Maybe she has noticed but doesn’t even bat an eye. She probably sees this often and it no longer fazes her. For a moment Peter wonders how many others have been in a similar situation and have sat where he’s sitting now, their minds racing with too many thoughts.
Peter decides to hold back. There might only be a few of them, but he’s never gone against anyone other than his papa and occasionally his uncles and aunt. They would go easy on him, while these guys would probably have him dead in seconds.
“Can we not…” Tony trails off with a sigh. “Why do you want to know so bad?”
“You’re also pregnant.”
Flash shakes his head when Peter offers him a Star Wars t-shirt. Peter lets out a sigh and sits next to Flash, ignoring the way his arm brushes against Flash’s.
“I know,” Tony says, his tone calmer. “I know. And it was so stupid of me. The test, the lying; all of it was stupid and I’m sorry. I’m not good at this. I’m not good at opening up to people. I’m terrified of the idea of falling in love because the last thing I want to do is hurt someone I care about. But then you happened and I fell hard. At the time it had been just helping you out but then something changed and...and I fell in love with you.”
“He loved Christmas. Every year he was decorating and looking for the perfect tree. We would watch pretty much every Christmas movie out there and stuff our faces with sugar cookies.”
“He’s being looked over now,” Natasha says, gesturing toward the room on her right. It’s tempting to rush through the door to find out for himself, but it’s like she can read his mind and she stops him from following through. “Wait. Let me take the baby.”
“I think you’ve made it up to me.”
“You’re not just after my money, are you?”
It didn’t happen overnight, but Tony eventually came around to the idea of having a dog and he grew closer with Dodger. Their relationship changed so much that Dodger started following Tony wherever he went. At first it was slightly annoying, but after a while Tony didn’t mind the dog’s presence.
Tony scoffs and rolls his eyes. “Can’t we stop by?”
“Peter should,” Sam finally responds to the question. “I don’t want to take that away from him too. Steve would’ve given it to him.”
“Me, too. And maybe it’s not you. Maybe it’s-”
Steve frowns as he thinks it over. Tony had been the only alpha to ask. “Do you want me to present?”
“What?”
“Then have me.” Steve whispers.
Steve ignores him, walking out of the living room and toward their bedroom. Tony lets out a heavy sigh and rises to his feet, shushing Morgan quietly when she starts to fuss. He doesn’t chase after Steve right away, deciding to put Morgan down in her crib first.
“I don’t care about your past, Steve. I know you’re not just some omega. You’re more than that. I’m honestly wondering why you’d even give me a chance. I’m the one who-”
“Steve?” The doctor’s voice is full of concern. “Is there any chance you could be pregnant?”
Peter’s up again sometime around two thirty. Steve hears him first and groans when he realizes he’s forced to get out of bed again. He sits up and stretches, giving himself a moment to wake up.
“Hey,” Tony says and Steve tears his gaze away from Morgan to lock with Tony’s. “You can do this. I know it’s not going to happen overnight, but you’ll find yourself again. I’ll be here every step of the way.”
But now he’s having second thoughts.
The tears keep streaming down his face and he has to fight the urge not to scream at the sight of the casket. He shuts his eyes, praying to wake up, to be saved from this torment.
He doesn’t get much sleep. It’s not the pillow that prevents him from getting any rest. Steve is woken up by a sharp cramp in his belly. He can’t help but wake with a gasp, eyes going wide from the startling pain. He rolls over with a groan, one hand falling to the spot where he feels the muscles of his abdomen tightening.
Tony chuckles. He could only imagine Steve’s reaction to find the kid crawling around the ceiling and walls like some kind of arachnid.
“What does that mean?” Tony dares to question.
Steve’s eyes fill with more tears and he sniffs, quickly reaching up to wipe them away when they escape. “My other pups...they’re…” he pauses and takes a deep breath. “Remember I told you I wondered what happened to them? The worst thing happened. They’re…”
“Vibranium?”
“That’s so cool! I mean, kinda. I know he was a jerk but you have to admit having him and Captain America for parents is awesome.”
Tony’s sure Steve has given up all ideas of a family now, but he’s never been more wrong.
“I know, I know. I told you over the phone how...messed up he is.”
“Really old?” Sam raises a questioning brow. “Bro, they’re not that old. You love those movies.”
They resume their work and Peter starts up again with his stories. The bond between them still had room for improvement, but it was getting there. Tony was confident that one day they’ll be close and feel like a real family.
“Yeah. Just tired I guess. He’s...different? I don’t know how else to explain it.” Tony sighs.
Peter decides it wouldn’t hurt to see what kind of options he had. He finds an old MIT sweatshirt and slips it on. It fits perfectly.
“Tony…”
“Oh I know. But it’ll get easier. I promise,” Tony assures.
“Yeah. I’m fine.”
Since the devastating fall of an Avenger, Director Nick Fury vowed to never have the world suffer from a loss as great as that one again. He had made it his mission to find a way to revive the heroes the world so desperately needed.
Steve snorts. “Making coffee isn’t cooking, Tony.”
“She’s coming now!”
“Right. I didn’t forget by the way. I guess my mind is elsewhere,” Tony sighs and rests his hands against the top of the counter, his shoulders sag. “Okay, what’s first on the list? I have one saved somewhere right?”
“Hey, Petey,” Steve says softly to the bump, imagining that their son could hear him. The doctor said the baby could hear them and was moving, but that it was going to take a few more weeks for them to feel the movement. Time had already passed since then and they had yet to feel anything. “You’re probably sleeping, huh? You wore daddy out.”
Steve never does.
Steve keeps his attention on the head alpha, trying to hold his ground, not letting the musky scent send him spiraling backwards in fear.
The spare bedroom in Steve’s apartment never had much to begin with; only a small desk, a book shelf, and a few painting easels. It was a space he found trouble filling up, having grown up used to living in a home that could only fit essential items.
It’s Tony who takes initiative.
“Just for five minutes? Please? It’s...it’s something I’ve been doing and...and it helps.”
He purposely ignores the framed photo on the nightstand. He can’t bear to look at it.
Sam had a point. There would be no illegal operation if the building and everyone inside was destroyed. The only ones that needed to get out alive were himself and his team.
Tony tips his head back, his own eyes falling shut as he focuses on the feeling of Steve’s walls gripping his cock. He forces his eyes open, not wanting to miss a second of Steve’s enjoyment. Just watching his mate take what he needs and enjoying it brings Tony closer to the edge.
At the sound of his name, Peter turns toward the medical table where his father is lying. He meets blue eyes. “Papa?”
“It’s okay,” Peter assures, still scratching under Alpine’s chin. “Uncle Sam is going to be Captain America. I’ll just be Spider-Man.”
Peter frowns and his eyes roam over the purple bruise on his father’s cheek and the blood around his nose. He’s gentle when he stretches out his hands to cup his papa’s face.
Steve chuckles. “I won’t throw anything at you.”
“What came up?”
“No more crying at animated movies?”
“Thanks for the reminder.”
“I do.”
“No. I’m busy. He’ll be here when he gets here I guess.”
He can hear Morgan, the sound of her cries concerning. He listens carefully, ears straining to hear Steve calming her like he always does.
“Thanks, Petey. I guess that’s the point, right?”
“It’s not like that anymore-”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah. A scrawny, sick little pup. She did her best. Money was always an issue but she worked hard to give me a good life. She taught me everything I know. I wouldn’t be who I am without her. Thought sometimes I wonder if...if I lost myself. I wonder if she would still be proud of the man I am right now.”
Steve pulls away to glance up at him, his brows drawing together in confusion. “The two of us?” He repeats. “Tony, we have a baby now.”
“Me? Oh no. I can’t-”
“I’m sorry! I’m sorry!” Steve continues to scream, his throat burning. A hand is placed over his mouth, blocking out any more of his screams.
Bucky scoffs and Peter’s expression hardens.
It’s worrisome and Steve’s stomach is doing that weird thing where he can’t decide if he needs to throw up or not. He frowns and places a hand over his stomach, taking a deep, concentrated breath when the nausea continues. He shrugs it off.
“Don’t.” Tony warns and Steve backs off.
“But an A, huh? On what?”
“Your alpha?”
“Have you ever thought of going back?”
He finds a way to turn his head and his eyes lock with brown ones. “Tony! Tony, please!”
James is still showing apprehension, but seeing his younger brother wrapped around the omega eases him. He sniffs the air and leans forward to get a better whiff of Steve. The scent must be calming or familiar because he calms down and his scent becomes less sour. Steve hopes he recognizes his scent.
“So he’s a dick?”
“Obviously.”
“I’m sorry. I don’t make this easy.”
“This is real right?” Steve asks and he glances at all of his friends. “You’re all really here and I have…” he trails off and his eyes meet Harley’s sleeping face. “I really have him?”
Tony smiles up at him and slips the ring over Steve’s finger. Tony rises to his feet and pulls Steve into arms, then he connects their lips in a gentle kiss. They break apart and Tony leans forward, resting his forehead against Steve’s.
“This has you written all over it. What’s wrong with the coffee in your penthouse?”
“So far everything looks good. I’ll print some pictures for you when I’m done, then you should be good to go.”
“Or not.” Steve frowns and turns around to finish preparing the tea he’s made for himself.
“Steve, calm down. Hey, come here.” Tony pulls Steve close again. “It’s going to be okay. I promise.”
“Right,” Tony says and pushes the file away. “These guys don’t quit, do they? So what’s the plan?”
It takes him longer than usual, but Tony has Jarvis up and running. He would’ve had his trusty AI up sooner, but with caring for the pups and trying to adjust to his new life as a father, somethings were unfortunately placed on the back burner. Tony just hates that it’s Jarvis being pushed to the side.
“I know, I know. Just give me a minute okay? Geez, I can’t even remember the last time you fucked me.”
“Show us the heartbeat.”
Steve hesitates to answer the question. He would be lying if he said their breakup didn’t leave him confused and slightly bitter, but it wasn’t worth voicing his feelings if it meant jeopardizing a friendship with Tony. He’d rather have him as a friend, as a teammate, then not have him at all.
“Oh shoot that’s right,” Tony says, clearly having forgotten. “I had this thing but-”
Steve nods, a smile of his own forming over his lips. “Yeah. I didn’t think I’d see them again.”
“Can I feel?” Steve finds himself asking and he trails a hand between his legs, gasping when he’s met with a hard mass.
I really want to give them another pup...so maybe a sequel? 🤔
“Oh yeah. Aching feet, feeling bloated all the time, horny as fuck, the urge to eat everything in the fridge. It’s all great stuff.”
It wasn’t a complete lie. Peter did spend most of the night tossing and turning, his mind racing with thoughts he’d never in a million years think to have. He had thrown up too. The nausea was bad and he had made himself feel worse by peeking into the plastic CVS bag and finding the pregnancy test he had bought after school.
It was definitely not the costume Tony had pictured for his son. His son wanted to be him. Tony Stark. Iron Man didn’t even compare in Peter’s eyes.
He draws a spider in the middle of the suit and shades it in. He leans back to properly examine his work, smiling at what he finds. He hopes Peter likes it.
But now he’s thinking maybe it was too soon. His aunt did say he could finish the rest of the year at home. Summer was just around the corner anyway. But Peter missed seeing Ned everyday and his studies did help take his mind off things, even if it was for a few hours.
“What’s the happiest memory you have?” Tony asks, desperate for something more joyful.
“Sorry. I’m not used to…”
Their latest argument was still fresh in his mind. He had Tony’s words on repeat most of the night; they kept him awake. It was his decision to go out for a run to help clear his mind, but for the first time, it did the complete opposite.
Then Bruce is glancing over at Tony and their eyes meet. There’s no hatred or disgust or anything that makes Tony feel unwelcomed. Bruce had been one of Tony’s closest friends. They weren’t known as the Science Bros for nothing.
“It’s an...acquired taste. I think I’ve had worse,” Tony says, then he sits down beside his son. “We’re good, right?”
“Did he eat?” Tony asks and Steve shakes his head. “Maybe he’s hungry?
“I don’t hate you.”
Peter sighs. “I’d rather just have Captain America.”
“Please!” Steve begs, tears are beginning to stream down his face. “I’m sorry! Alpha, I’m sorry!”
“Do you wanna talk about it?” Tony asks.
“Just admit it, Tony. Just admit that you’re afraid of me. You don’t trust me around her and I get that. I don’t trust myself either. It’s better if I go.” Steve turns back around and grabs the bag.
Morgan curls up closer to him, wanting to bask in his warmth a little longer. Tony smiles and wraps an arm around her.
It’s a struggle at first to get his son to latch on. The baby whimpers, the sound making Steve’s heart clench.
“Tony, you’ve seen-”
A sharp cramp in his midsection has Steve stopping abruptly, one hand flying to the spot when his belly tightens uncomfortably. Sam is the first to notice, sending him a worried look.
“Hey, where’s Steve?”
Steve sighs and leans back in his seat. He’s definitely not hungry now. “I know. I’m trying to figure out how to do it.”
“Pregnancy brain.” Pepper chuckles and she reaches out to gently rub Steve’s shoulder. “You should come back to the party. I’m sure Tony’s missing you.”
I just wanted to say that I hope all of you are doing well during these crazy and difficult times. Writing is an escape for me so I'm trying to find more time for it. Thank you for being so patient and understanding. I love all of you!
“He’s not my alpha!” Steve snaps.
It gets harder each time.
“I want to be you!”
The elevator takes her to her destination and she’s grateful that her auntie is home. She’s greeted with a warm smile and that’s when Morgan loses all of her composure and breaks down.
It must be noticeable too, because as soon as Tony senses Steve’s presence, his smile is fading and a deep, concerned frown takes its place.
The times were different now. The world was more accepting of omegas. But some things never change. Bad alphas were always going to be around.
Steve glances down at his hands again. His eyes fill with tears and he does everything he can to hold them in. He takes a deep breath to calm himself before glancing up at his friend. “I’m scared,” he admits. “I have no idea what I’m doing and Tony...he doesn’t know.”
Peter nods but doesn’t say anything. It only makes Tony feel worse.
Thank you guys for the wonderful response! It means a lot! Hope you all enjoy this one!
Bucky has to fight back the tears. “We’ll come back,” he promises.
“I think that’s good enough for now, right? Unless you have anything?” Tony asks the beta.
He pulls off of Steve’s lips, smiling at the blissed out look plastered on his husband’s face. Steve’s eyes are closed and his lips are parted, soft breaths slipping past them.
Moving quietly and cautiously, Tony creeps up behind the two alphas, and once close enough, uses the knife to take down the first alpha. The man screams in pain and flails his arms, trying to reach behind himself for the knife lodged in his neck. Tony shoved him toward the other alpha, catching the second off guard and unable to pull his gun from his holster. Tony shoots him in the chest and he goes down.
“H-hey,” Peter stutters under their burning gaze. His uncle Bruce looks disappointed, but it’s the fiery, pissed off look on his uncle Sam’s face that lets him know what’s coming next. “I can explain-”
“Good morning, Mr. Rogers,” The AI’s tone was cheery, and for a moment Steve forgets Jarvis isn’t human. “How can I be of service?”
“I know. I’m sorry. I guess I just wanted something different for you.”
Together they leave and Steve makes sure to thank Pepper on their way out. Upon entering their private quarters, they’re met with a messy living room and crying. Peter is doing most of the crying but Happy appears like he’s ready to join him.
Tony silences him with a kiss. “I’ve never been more sure in my whole life. I want this forever. I’m never letting you go again. I promise.”
“No! Please! I’m not going to hurt her. Tony, please!”
“Yeah.”
“I do. Alpha...he’s a bad man, Tony. A very bad man. He’ll find me and…” Steve shudders at the thought of what’s in store for him. He had been punished when he escaped the first time-forced to stay in a cold room and birth his pup alone. The punishment could’ve been worse, but Steve had been lucky then. He couldn’t say that now.
A small sob rips from Bucky’s throat and Sam holds him tighter, comforting him with soft words and gently threading his fingers through his hair.
“Cool. Thanks!”
But then Tony’s wrapping his fingers around the collar of Steve’s shirt and tugging him forward to deepen the kiss. Steve moans into the kiss, his parted lips giving Tony the opportunity to slide his tongue inside his mouth. Tony brings him back and Steve follows.
That thought hadn’t crossed his mind before. He had trusted Steve and the story he told him. But now a seed was planted and Tony wondered if maybe that pup in Steve’s belly wasn't his.
“Honey, that’s not what I meant. I’m sorry. I just-”
“Ah, yes, I see where this is going. Mr. Stark, I can assure you that your behaviour was nothing to be ashamed of. You were the highlight of the party,” Alexander says.
It wasn’t going to be easy to start over, but it was the best choice. Steve was still fragile and it was difficult to say just how long he’d remain in that state. He was improving, growing stronger and stronger every day. Little by little more of himself was coming out.
Steve nods and follows Natasha out of the room. She leads him toward an elevator and they descend to the floor beneath them. Steve glances toward the alpha, trying to read her. She didn’t seem so threatening now, but something told him he knew better than to underestimate her. She could be dangerous.
Clint answers, “Don’t worry about them. We did take a souvenir if that’s what you’re asking.”
“Oh.” Sam frowns, then a smile spreads across his face. “About time. Haven’t you been hinting, for like, years?”
“Makes sense. He was the only one who could pull off the spangled look,” Sam jokes.
He was having a baby.
“Mama stop fighting with daddy,” Harley says and shovels eggs and bacon in his mouth.
“Come here.” Steve holds out both arms and Peter giggles as he puts down his blocks and crawls over. Steve smiles brightly and lifts Peter into his arms, holding him up until Peter is in the air and giggling again. “You’re so big!” Steve coos and brings Peter down to kiss his nose.
“I’ll fuck you,” Tony promises.
“You did. I’m glad you’re okay.”
“His name's Peter,” Steve says and Tony glances up at him.
“I’m sorry!” Peter cries. “I just wanted to fix my costume and-and-”
He just needed a suit of armor first.
“Hey,” he says. “What are you doing?”
He sacrificed everything until the very end.
Peter chuckles. “They’re good. Don’t worry.”
“I know I said I wanted to do this,” Tony begins, the smile never leaving his face. “And trust me, I’m not only doing this because we have our pups, but because I love you and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
“Shit. I overslept.”
The room has a slight chill in the air, but it’s the familiar scent that smacks Peter in the face first. He flips on the light and allows his eyes to roam over every visible inch. The first thing Peter notices is the neatly made bed, then his eyes travel to the worn out pair of sneakers lined up against the wall.
Steve glances down at his son, hesitant to let him go when he just got him back in his arms. But there was something about this alpha. Steve had initially thought she was a threat, but she was proving that perhaps not all alpha’s were bad. Maybe she was one of the good ones.
And now here they were, learning about the family member Tony didn’t want. He can’t be happy. He just can’t.
“No. Don’t make up this bullshit-”
“This isn’t my…I’ve had a pup before.” Steve glances down at the floor, knowing if he wasn’t almost 8 months pregnant that he would be staring down at his feet right now.
“I screwed up. I get that. When are all of you going to let it go and move on from it? It seems like I’m the only one trying,” Tony tries to defend himself.
“I know what you mean. But hey we’ll figure it out.”
The omega growls when the unwanted hands creep closer to his most intimate place. He goes ignored and the alpha continues to run the cloth over Steve’s body. The scent the alpha gives off changes; he’s getting aroused. It was sick and Steve couldn’t grasp the idea of anyone getting off on this. But he was an omega. He was supposed to pleasure the alphas.
Steve doesn’t let him go, even when Tony assures him that his crib was perfectly safe.
That earns Sam a punch in the arm.
“Ah.”
Steve frowns and is ready to march back up the stairs and change, but then Tony is rushing after him and taking his hand, forcing him to sigh in defeat and turn back around.
Tony wasn’t a bad guy. Sometime he did stupid things or said the wrong thing, but he wasn’t a jerk like most people painted him to be. His arrogance was just a mask that he wore to hide his real emotions. He had trust issues and shockingly enough he had self-esteem issues too. He wasn’t perfect. He had his flaws and demons. But underneath that all he had a heart. Pepper said so herself he believed everything she said.
“P-Peter broke m-my teapot!” Sarah bursts into tears and hugs Steve tighter.
Tony needs to figure out a way to make up for this one. I don’t think he can to be honest.
Steve smiles. It was.
“Steve, are you okay?” Tony sniffs the air. Damn it. Tony would figure it out. “What’s wrong?”
Poor Steve is so overwhelmed but at least he has his wonderful husband and friends to help him. And now he has two beautiful babies to spoil! The next chapter will be fluffy :)
Tony grows quiet, keeping his attention on the hand that needs to be wrapped up. He listens, waiting for Steve to continue. It’s heartbreaking to hear his confession.
“I’m okay,” Peter repeats.
“Is this your way of apologizing?”
“If you want me to go then just say it.”
“Please?”
“I like you too. At first I thought I couldn’t because you’re you and I’m...you know what I am.”
“Baby, talk to me. If you want to stop we can. Just say Red.”
“I’m sure he’ll be able to smell it. Just don’t tell him anything. I’ll be fine. I’ve been through these alone before.”
“Have you figured it out yet?” Tony smirks when they reach a door and he begins punching in a code.
The past is in the past. There was no point worrying about the what if’s and regretting past decisions. All they could do was move forward and lean on each other.
“You two good?” He asks and they both nod in response. “Good. Now let’s get ready for school.”
“I’ll go with you!” Peter jumps up from his seat. He cowers when another deathly glare is sent his way.
“It was worth it, though. This whole journey was worth it. I love them.”
“You did.”
“No, it’s fine.” Tony dismisses with a wave of his hand. “This is my company and I need to get shit done around here. Which by the way, you’ve done an amazing job. I actually wanted to talk to you about something.”
“Unless he wants to be a Stark.”
Tony isn’t where Steve left. He’s not surprised to find his husband gone and probably down in his lab at this very moment. It was his way to calm down and blow off some steam. Steve both hated and loved it. He loved that his husband had an outlet, but he hated that said outlet would result in Tony spending long hours away from home, and forgetting basic human needs like sleeping, eating, and drinking. Unless the drinking involved coffee then he was fine. Steve still hated it.
“Come on.” Tony doesn’t even wait for Happy to get the door for him. He unbuckles himself and climbs out of the car. Happy immediately follows. “Don’t say it,” Tony tells him when he rounds the car to get to Steve.
“You have an appointment. Come on, get dressed.”
“He wouldn’t lie. Pep, we talked and...I don’t think he would.”
Steve rolls his eyes and then glances at the hologram of the monster that is still in his kitchen. “Did he forget that we have a 5-year-old son?”
“Thank you.” Steve directs his gaze back on their daughter. He reaches out for her, only to quickly retract his hand. It’s painful to see him so afraid to touch her.
The taste of the alcohol is overwhelming; the feeling of the forced kiss is nauseating. But Steve has no choice but to let it happen.
“I just don’t like him...out there.”
“I can’t even begin to imagine what you went through, and I’m sorry life had to fuck you this hard. Sorry. I’m not so great at talking about this sort of stuff. When my life was flipped upside down I found ways to distract myself. Not good ways but...I needed something.”
Steve smiles. “I know.”
Peter was a month old and the thought of leaving him behind, even for just a few hours, made Steve uneasy. It was one thing for him to be separated from his son for a week because he was with Tony, but Peter alone with someone else, that was a different story.
It’s difficult to move out of the city and away from the only life they’ve ever known. Steve had been hesitant at first about leaving the compound and his old life, but then he came around to the idea and started looking forward to the future.
We finally get to know some stuff about Steve! He's not Captain America, but I made the story a little similar. I just changed and added things to make it make sense for my universe. Anyway, hope you all enjoy!
The way she acts around him is noticeably different than when Steve has her, and Tony can’t help but frown at that realization. She doesn’t fuss or cry, and instead she’s completely content nestled in Tony’s arms. An idea enters his mind and he quickly forces it out, not believing for even a second it’s because Steve doesn’t love her.
“Come home now!” Happy demands.
“I’m fine.”
“Steve,” Tony says softly, crossing the room to be beside him again. He doesn’t bother with the chair anymore, needing to be closer to Steve, and he sits near him on the bed. “Hey, it’s okay.”
“You can’t hide from me forever,” Natasha says and folds her arms over her chest. Steve scoffs and continues to beat at the bag.
A part of Peter almost feels guilty for wanting to seek his dad out. He often found himself questioning if it would be worth it. His dad hadn’t bothered to reach out in 15 years. The only family Peter had was the Avengers, and though they weren’t family by blood, they took care of him as if he was cut from the same cloth. They were all he’d ever need.
He glances down, eyes scanning over Steve’s blissed expression and then to the fresh mark on his neck. Tony leans closer to press a kiss to the bite mark he’s left behind, gently lapping at the spot with his tongue.
But now Peter was feeling that jealousy all over again, and it wasn’t over stupid comics. Ned didn’t have to deal with morning sickness, angry parents, or having to tell Flash that he was going to be a father. Ned could still wake up every morning without having to constantly dwell or think about an unplanned pregnancy. Ned could finish high school and get into a good college. He could still have a life.
“He ready for bed?” Tony whispers and Steve nods.
A moment of silence passes between them. A part of Peter wants his papa to leave him alone, but the other half wants the comfort and encouragement his papa never failed to give.
Tony scoffs. “That doesn’t make me feel better.”
Tony doesn’t emerge from his workshop anymore. What used to be a solace for him was now a prison. He spends hours working on suits he knows he’ll never get a chance to use. Iron Man was dead.
“Okay. Then let’s make this suit. Spider-Man is going to need it. No offense but I don’t think jeans and hoodie are going to cut it.”
Pepper sighs and folds the letter up. “I don’t know what to say, Tony.”
“So? I need a break too.”
“No,” Pepper says, her tone doing nothing to back up her response. “Why didn’t you tell me you scheduled another meeting with Alexander Pierce?”
“It’s okay,” Tony assures. “It’s just me.”
Steve chuckles.
“Are you sure you haven’t had too much sugar?” Tony jokes.
“Tony-”
James rushes back to the bed and crawls toward the wall, bringing his knees up to his chest and hugging them tightly. Steve approaches the scared little alpha and sits down on the edge of the bed.
“Yeah. I thought we could break up and everything would be okay. But I was wrong. I missed you during our time apart. I still do, Tony. I’m sorry. I’m trying to move on.”
“Hey.” Tony releases his grip on Steve’s wrists. “Sorry. You were trying to hit me.”
“Hey,” Steve greets.
Tony grips the edge of the sink, his knuckles nearly white from how hard he’s gripping the surface. His shoulders sag and his head hangs between them. The tears he’s been holding back can no longer be contained and they spill from his eyes, running down his face and creating wet tracks along his cheeks. His shoulders shake with each sob that rips through him.
“It’s okay,” Happy is quick to assure. “Just breathe.”
“I’m sorry! I can’t help it! You’re having a baby!”
Just like Jarvis had said, Steve is still in the living room, sitting on the couch with his face buried in his hands. The small sniffs and sobs are heartbreaking to hear. All Tony’s ever seen is this side of Steve. He’s only witnessed the broken side. He wonders if Steve even has a good side.
Now Tony knew who this man was. Alexander Pierce was the founder of the organization. It was his vision to see the world change and become better than what it was, what it has been. Tony’s heard it all before, but he allows himself to meet the man.
They gather in the kitchen for breakfast. Tony’s attempt at eggs and bacon didn’t go as bad as he thought. It would be easier to have food delivered or to hire a personal chef, but Tony wanted to learn how to take care of Steve without any help. They weren’t mates and Steve didn’t need Tony to do everything for him, but Tony would be lying if he didn’t think about making Steve his mate.
The alpha above him picks up the pace of his hips and drops his head down to Steve’s neck, licking a stripe along the sensitive flesh. His teeth graze over the bond mark and Steve growls in warning. The alpha only chuckles darkly.
Tony had to figure out how to do the same.
“No,” Steve answers honestly. “I don’t know how to answer the question.”
“Among other things. JARVIS is of course my greatest invention. Right, J?”
Tony sags his shoulders, defeated. Steve has to stay.
Bucky rolls his eyes and pushes Sam away, only to be pulled back and a gentle kiss placed to his lips. Bucky deepens the kiss and his metal hand wraps around the front of Sam’s shirt, bringing him closer. Alpine meows in annoyance and leaps off Bucky’s lap.
was a show Steve had definitely missed. There was still so much he needed to catch up on. Tony helped introduce him to new things when given the chance, but lately a lot of their time was spent preparing for their son’s birth.
The room is too quiet now. Tony doesn’t like it. He wants the omega to say something, anything.
Bucky frowns as he thinks it over. “Rock, paper, scissors?”
“He’s fine,” Bruce assures. “He’s really starting to feel it.”
It’s also the last push he needed. He wanted to meet his dad and find out what he was really like. Maybe he wasn’t such a bad guy and just deserved a chance. Peter believed in second chances. And maybe his dad needed one.
“But you know it’s true. I know what he did was crappy but that was years ago. I forgave him and I’m the one he screwed over the most. Why can’t you?”
Tony huffs and Steve can’t help but chuckle. “You can wait, Stark. I don’t remember getting a wake up call like that.”
“They will,” he assures. “I’m their mother.”
“H-hey,” Peter greets, wringing his hands nervously, “I’m sorry. I’m sorry for making this difficult on everyone.”
“Hey, it’s okay. Maybe you just need to pump.”
“It’s okay. And he’s...alright.” Peter frowns. He hates that's the only word he can use to describe his dad.
Peter’s first instinct is to rush toward her, but he holds off and takes slow, cautious steps instead. Her guard is only down for a moment and as soon as he’s close enough, she whips her head in his direction.
“More than that. Tony, if you leave then we won’t be a real team.”
“Let him go.” Steve turns to begging. “Please! You just want me.”
“Hey, hey.” Tony unbuckles himself and leans forward. “Is he alright? Did you hit him?”
Peter stays for a few more minutes, telling his papa about the other struggles he was currently going through. It wasn’t just the relationship with his father that Peter was concerned about. He was worried for the rest of his family. He’d give anything to be fighting alongside them right now.
But he was turning his life around. The drinking had to stop now that he has someone who needs him more than ever. What kind of father would he be if all he did was get drunk before ten AM? He didn’t have the greatest example of a father growing up, and now that he has a son of his own, he wants to be better.
“Guess we’ll never know.” Tony leans forward and stretches his arms over his head, groaning softly when his back cracks. “I can order dinner? I mean, if you’re okay with that.”
Bucky doesn’t sit down in the chair, he makes room for himself on the bed beside Steve and holds him close. It reminds him of all the times he’d care for Steve when he was sick in bed.
“Nah. We got a little distracted but we’re good now. Right, kiddo?” Tony turns back to Peter and tickles him gently, getting a coo in response.
The tears keep falling and this time Peter doesn’t try to stop them. The pain was still fresh and too great. He’s not sure if he’ll ever be able to heal from this loss. His father was all he had and then in an instant, he was gone and Peter didn’t know how he was supposed to survive something like that.
”I’m just saying, boss.” Happy holds up his hands in defense. “The press will say anything these days.”
“Pepper Potts helped us find you. Does she sound familiar?”
“How are you doing?” Happy steals a glance in his direction. “Good?”
One glance around shows how much the Captain was loved. Candles, flowers, and other gifts have been left near the base of the statue. Tony feels even worse for not bringing anything to lay down.
“Shh,” Tony soothes and rubs along Steve’s back. “It’s okay. Don’t apologize, sweetheart. It’s not your fault.”
The plan had been successful. He’s pregnant.
“Good.”
“It’s been thirty minutes…”
“Yeah. You’re excited right?” Steve asks.
He tries to remind himself that checking out Steve, his friend, was not allowed. That inner voice-it oddly sounds like Natasha-mocks him, accuses him for still having feelings for Steve. Tony doesn’t listen. He didn’t have feelings for Steve anymore.
“I guess the baby doesn’t like pancakes,” Steve chuckles softly and reaches over his son to flush away the evidence of Peter’s morning sickness. “It’s okay. I couldn’t really stomach them either. Especially chocolate chip.”
Tony steps deeper into the lab. For the first time, the sight of his husband sends a shiver up Steve’s spine. The closer Tony gets, the further Steve steps back until he’s bumping into Tony’s workbench and trapped between the two.
The SUV eventually comes to a stop. Steve lifts his head, wishing he could see where he was, but the sack over his head remains, leaving him to rely on his other senses. There’s movement on his left and then the sound of the door can be heard. He’s gripped roughly and forced out of the vehicle. He can barely make out the scent of coffee; Tony was nearby.
“Yeah.” Peter nods and smiles softly at her. She smiles back.
“Oh. I wish mine was something else.”
“I’m Spider-Man, remember! You can be that!”
There’s a moment of silence between them before Steve breaks it.
Harley grows braver and stands up, wobbling for a moment before losing his balance and staggering forward. Steve catches him and to his surprise the pup doesn’t respond negatively. He allows Steve to pick him up.
Peter smiles and nods.
The alpha that Steve is forced to call his own is nothing like the stories he grew up hearing. His mother always told him that one day he’d find his mate. Steve had been wary. No alpha would ever want him. He had been a small, sickly omega. He wasn’t good enough for any alpha.
“Yeah. I don’t mind, if that’s what you’re wondering. I love all of the changes. Having Pete has its moments, sure, but I wouldn’t trade that little boy for anything. And...I got you back. I thought we were done.”
“What are you talking about? I put that mark there because I love you and wanted you as my mate.”
“Oh...okay...um there are tissues.” Natasha leans over to grab a tissue from the box sitting on the coffee table. She hands one to him and Steve wipes at his nose and eyes. “Better?”
That’s when he loses it.
Steve has been up against Natzis, waking up in a new world, otherworldly beings, some of the worst mercenaries on the planet, but none of those terrified him as much as the sleeping boy in his arms.
He shuts the book and tosses it on the coffee table. Steve frowns, and with a huff, leans forward to retrieve the book.
“Me? Hell no. You need professional help.”
“I’ll call him,” Natasha decides and reaches forward to grab her phone off the coffee table. “I’m sure he’s going to love this.”
Steve bites down on his lip, hesitant to let go of his babies now that he’s gotten them back.
“Hey! I’m good!”
Peter’s stomach is still churning after he’s made his way through the front doors of his high school. He keeps his gaze down and his hoodie pulled tight over his head to hide the tears that haven’t stopped falling. No one pays him any mind; he was a loser and for once he’s happy about it.
“I went to see him.”
Harley is pouting again when a serving of broccoli is placed on his Mickey Mouse plate. He pulls a face and shakes his head, refusing to eat the vegetables. Peter points out that they’re just like little trees. Harley isn’t amused.
“Watch it, dork,” Flash sneers and his group of followers laugh. They mimic him and bump into Peter too, giggling as if it was the funniest thing in the world.
“Lighten up, Capsicle, it’s Christmas! You’re missing something. Aha!” The camera shakes for a moment while Tony takes a Santa hat and places it on Steve’s head. “Perfect! You look jolly already.”
Aww Steve has grown so much and now he wants another pup. *cough* Morgan *cough* 😉
“No. It’s okay. I don’t want you to do this alone.”
Steve smiles softly. “I know. Me too. But we can do this. I know we can.”
“Whose side are you on anyway, J?”
“It’s fine.” Steve is left panting after the contraction ends. “Just go. There’s time.”
But he wasn’t going to hide anymore. He did it for 15 years and enough was enough. He needed to pull himself together and get his life back on track. If not for himself then for his son.
“It’s a little touchy I guess. I mentioned he was distant with me, right?”
“Steve-”
“That’s not me.”
It was wishful thinking.
Tony is still standing, the knife held tightly in his hand. He locks eyes with Steve and then releases his hold on the knife. He loses his balance, staggering back until he’s hitting the wall and sliding down it.
Waiting around for Tony wasn’t an option anymore. Steve waits until the contraction has ended before he’s dialing another number. Pepper was usually better about answering her phone than Tony, but even calling her proves to be futile. She’s busy too.
“Good. And I know you probably like the sweatshirt-” Tony starts and Steve’s face heats up. “-but I think I can get you something better. How do you feel about shopping? I’m only asking because the clothes Happy brought are probably ...how do I lightly put this…”
“Can we please figure this out? I don’t want to make all of the decisions. It’s your baby too.”
“You’re wondering why we’re not together even though we have a kid. Am I right? I’m right, I know I am. I don’t know. It’s complicated.”
“Where is this going?” Tony narrows his eyes.
“Good night, Petey,” Steve leans down to press a kiss to his son’s head. “I love you.”
Morgan giggles. “I’ll be the favorite. Your secret is safe with me.”
“What if he’s hungry?” Steve mutters and with a sigh rolls over onto his back. “Just give me a minute.”
“Yeah.” Tony smiles and reaches out to touch his son. He lays a hand over Peter’s head, chuckling to himself at the amount of hair his son has. “He is going to take after me. Sorry.”
Both babies are fast asleep by the time they make it to the elevator. Steve carries Harley while Tony takes Peter. The doors shut and both men rest their heads back against the wall.
It’s Peter’s turn to offer comfort. He hugs his uncle tightly, his ears filling with the sounds of Bucky’s cries.
Peter nods.
This time he was going to break free from Hydra’s control.
“But, dad my project-”
Peter frowns. He knew his papa was trying to help but in all honesty it was making him feel worse. He didn’t care what the baby looked like.
“I’m right here!” Tony cuts in, leaning in enough for the camera to capture his face.
With a sigh of defeat, Steve gives up and rolls onto his back, eyes transfixed on the ceiling above him. His mind doesn’t stop racing with thoughts about Tony and the life they created. They weren’t supposed to have crossed that line. They were teammates first and then friends. But friends wasn’t a word anyone would use to describe them. They didn’t work.
Pepper shakes her head and walks away. Tony quickly rushes after her.
Tony brings Steve close and connects their lips again. Steve moans softly into the kiss and teasingly swipes his tongue along Tony’s bottom lip, begging for access, and Tony grants it, parting his lips and allowing Steve to slip his tongue inside his hot mouth.
“Go,” Steve tells her, “we’re okay. Thank you, Pepper. For everything.”
Steve brings him closer, pressing his lips to the top of his son’s wet head. “Shh, I’m here. I’m right here,” Steve soothes.
“Because it’s your baby! I’m trying to do the right thing by including you.”
It wasn’t until he met with Doctor Patterson did she confirm the pregnancy. The news was both shocking and happy at the same time. Getting pregnant was difficult for him and for years he wondered if it would ever happen. He had gotten lucky when he conceived Harley.
“Hmm.” Tony hums and he strides over to investigate for himself. “Maybe. Or maybe…” Tony grunts softly as he too struggles with the belt. “Maybe you need a new suit. You could’ve had a growth spurt.”
But now as they’re in the sanitized room at the OB’s office, that clump of cells resembles a tiny person.
“No. Just don’t feel well.”
It was difficult to juggle both the team and the new events in his life. The baby and his husband were always going to be his number one priority. They were going to come first before himself and anyone else. This mission was going to be his last.
“What the hell was that?” Natasha says angrily. She has no problem facing Bucky head on, and she gets up close, not showing an ounce of fear. He wouldn’t turn on her, she knows this, but if he wanted to fight then she’d fight right back.
Steve chuckles and waves the stick in his hand. “Now we know why. I was starting to get worried,” he says and he crosses the room to join Tony on the bed.
The sharp pain shooting through his head dazes him, and he falls to the floor with a small groan. His arms wrap tightly around himself to protect his unborn child from any harm. He waits for the kicking to start.
“Bucky-” Natasha is the next to try and console him, but he’s not having any of it and he storms off.
Steve frowns and places the tea to the side. “But we can’t leave the mansion. I don’t want to risk-”
But Tony’s not here. Tony was late and he promised he wouldn’t be. Maybe the voice was right. Maybe no one did care. Maybe he didn’t matter.
“Look let’s take this slow and...that doesn’t sound right. You know what I mean. I want to make things right. I fucked up and-”
This time Tony does ruffle Peter’s hair on his way out. Peter watches his dad leave and then turns back to his breakfast with a sad sigh.
The team is gathered in the communal living area, filling the space with laughter and an array of conversations. For once, they’re not needed on any assignments. They’re able to spend the morning together as a team; as a family.
He’s rambling, he’s sure of it, but Pepper doesn’t stop him, and instead she smiles and nods her head from time to time.
Peter smiles and nods. “I will.”
“Don’t make it a big deal okay? I’m fine. Nightmares happen to everyone.”
Peter seemed to like his new room. He sleeps peacefully in the crib and rarely fusses through the night anymore. Steve’s not about to get his hopes up; he’s still expecting to be woken up every few hours in the middle of the night.
Steve worried and cared about all of his teammates, but he couldn’t help but care a little more when it came to Tony. Tony was more than just another member of the team. He considered them friends, but most importantly Tony was the father of his baby. He was the person Steve couldn’t imagine living without. He loved him deeply.
“You’re gonna go home, pal. Just stay with us okay?” Bucky replaces Natasha’s hand with his own, pressing down hard to stop the bleeding.
Then Peter is up again. Steve goes through the same routine: changing Peter’s diaper, feeding him, and putting him back to sleep.
“Pete.” Sam’s voice is soft and calm to grab Peter’s attention.
“Owe it to me?” Steve raises a questioning brow. “You don’t owe me anything.”
“It’s not work,” Steve corrects and takes Sarah’s hand. They all make their way toward the house. “It’s my duty to help them.”
He’s also small. So small in fact Tony fears he might drop him. He’s never held a baby before, let alone one as tiny as Peter. But despite his small form, he fits perfectly in the crook of Tony’s arm. It’s like he’s meant to be there.
With a huff Steve rolls over onto his side and shuts his eyes, waiting for sleep to take him away from his never ending thoughts. Only, it’s not just Tony that’s keeping him awake. His belly is cramping up again. Steve cries out and buries his face into the pillow, breathing through it and praying for it to end.
“Relax,” Tony says and reaches out to pat Steve on the shoulder in an attempt to calm him. The omega relaxes slightly and continues to pick at his food. It doesn’t go unnoticed. “Hey,” Tony tries again and Steve peers up at him. “It’s okay. You don’t have to be scared.”
Tony pulls away. “I don’t know how.”
“Buck, stop,” Sam pauses his current task and faces his husband again. Bucky frowns and leans against the counter, arms folded across his chest. “He’s okay. You can’t worry about everything he does.”
He scratches at the mark, wishing he could peel it away. He never should have let Tony bite him. He never should have believed that Tony was different.
“Morning, kiddo,” Tony smiles. He doesn’t say anything else, and instead dumps the rest of his coffee down the drain and sets his cup in the sink. “I’ll see you later, Pete. I love you.”
Tony ignores his pleas, eyes burning with tears when he realizes that he’s hurting the one person he never wanted to hurt. But he didn’t have a choice. Morgan needed to be somewhere else right now.
Natasha must sense his sour mood because she swoops in to rescue him and remind him why they were celebrating in the first place. Steve forces Tony out of his mind to mingle with his friends. He’s surprised that both Thor and Clint had made it to the party. Thor was spending more and more time on Asgard, and Clint was busy taking care of his family.
And Ned was there for him. He was one of the first smiling faces Peter sees when he gets to school. Peter doesn’t even force a smile; the one that appears is genuine.
But nothing was okay. Nothing would ever be the same again. His father was gone.
“Go back to sleep.” Tony adjusts the blanket around Steve’s form, then he’s leaning down to kiss his head. Steve hums and his eyes fall shut again.
Tony shuts off the water and grabs a towel, wrapping it around Steve’s waist and helping him out of the shower. Steve’s eyes are wandering around the room, a choked sob escaping him when he sees the blood.
“You close?” Tony asks in all seriousness. “Because I’m not. Keep going.”
He has to pause again when his vision blurs and he’s unable to work properly. Tony sniffs and pulls back, dropping his tools on the bench with a loud clank.
“Well, you’re at five centimeters. You’re halfway there.” The doctor smiles and leans back.
“I’m not afraid,” Tony says, and he lets out a sigh. “I don’t know what it is.”
“Yep,” Tony grins and gestures for his son to enter the space first. Peter’s eyes are everywhere, taking in every inch, every computer monitor and every gadget. “You like it?”
“Yeah. And I’d hate to take Peter away from his new room.”
“I’m doing my best to be a good dad. I want him to be happy just as much as you do. If he wants to live with me-”
Peter invites Ned over, not caring if he ‘forgot’ to ask permission first. He needed his best friend now more than ever.
“I know that!” Tony cries out. He panics from his outburst and steals another glance in the direction of the door, thankful to find it still shut. “I know,” he says, his tone softer than before. “Believe me I wanted to get him help, but he had been so worried about the baby and I guess I just thought it would be better to wait until after the baby was born. I didn’t want to stress Steve out anymore than he already is.”
“I want to,” Steve says.
Sorry you guys! It’s been so crazy lately and I’ve been struggling to update. I finally got this one finished and hopefully I can work on my other works. Thank you for being so patient!
“Okay,” Morgan says and gets up from the table. She takes the history paper with her, smiling to herself at the big red A. She was sure her dad would love to see it too.
“Aright.” He shrugs. “It was...weird.”
“You should write that letter,” Natasha decides to switch the conversation back to the previous topic. “I’m sure Tony will want to know. You already have a bunch of pictures that he’s missing out on.”
Tony deepens the kiss and gently lowers Steve back down. His lips attach to Steve’s neck, teasing the spot the omega desperately wants touched. He doesn’t spend too much time marking up the unblemished skin and he moves down lower until he’s peppering kisses along Steve’s chest.
Damn. Why was he so horny right now?
Steve takes another deep breath and wipes his sweaty palms over the front of his slacks. In just a few minutes Pepper would come in and announce that it was time. It was nerve wracking.
“Thank you, sir.”
When Tony arrives at the compound, he takes a moment to collect himself before going inside. He takes deep, slows breaths to steady his rapidly beating heart. The suffocating feeling returns and he has to fight the urge to rip the tie off.
Pepper smiles brightly. “What’s up with you?”
“You look so pretty, darling.” Tony comments, his eyes roaming over Steve’s exposed body. He was the definition of perfection.
Nick nods as he considers this. “He would be useful. His abilities are extraordinary, I’ll give him that. Are you sure you’re ready to step down? The world still needs you.”
Tony can’t help the smirk that forms over his face. “Is that a threat? I’m not afraid of Barnes-”
“I did this,” Steve says, his voice quiet. Tony stil hears him and he gets up from the chair, moving to sit on the bed. Steve lifts his head when he feels the bed dip. “I’m sorry.”
“It’s going to be okay.” The hand she places on his shoulder is comforting. “You’re going to mess up and that’s okay. There’s no such thing as a perfect parent. You loving those little boys is what’s important. And I know you love them. I saw it the moment you looked at Harley.”
The nurse makes sure both of them are comfortable before excusing herself from the room. Now that he’s left alone, that fear comes rushing back. He doesn’t know what he’s supposed to be doing.
“Okay.” Steve nods.
“Are you kidding? Sweetheart, this is the best gift I’ve ever gotten. I can’t believe you did this; it’s amazing.”
“It’s not too late. The world still needs you.”
Steve smiles, content with those words.
“Boss wants you to wear this,” Rollins smirks. “It’s his favorite.”
He forces anything related to Tony out of his thoughts. It’s a lot harder to do considering the connection he has to Tony is currently growing in his belly, but he does his best. He shifts his focus to his unborn child and the preparations that needed to be made.
Being back in his own apartment slightly alters his mood. He’s able to focus on something else other than Tony. The pain is what takes all of his attention. It’s stronger and more intense than what it had been. It’s concerning and that voice inside his head tells him to take Sam’s advice and go to medical. But he’s stubborn and sure the serum will take care of whatever it is that’s bothering him.
“Love him?”
Tony plops down in his chair, hating how uncomfortable it feels now. Being back behind the desk should bring some kind of feeling, but there’s nothing. He hates being back. He wishes he could hide away and drown in his sorrows. It was pathetic but it’s all he knows now.
“Do you like it?”
“Did he...say anything about me?”
The sight is difficult to see, but Tony can’t help the spark of joy that shoots through him. His plan was working.
The beta in the white coat is easily recognizable. He had been present for all of the check ups and births. He had been the one to take all of Steve’s pups away.
“I don’t think you can. This hurts, Pep. This hurts bad. God I’ve never hated myself more than I do now. I’d give anything to go back and do the right thing.”
They move into the bedroom and over to the bed, their lips never parting. Steve’s legs bump into the edge of the bed and he falls back, bouncing slightly on the mattress. Tony hovers over him, ducking his head down to connect their lips again. He’s careful not to apply too much pressure to the delicate bump between them.
Here is the proposal! I suck at romance so I hope it didn't come out too bad!
“I didn’t want this for him. I wanted him to wait.”
“Don’t rush it. I’m going to get you some help okay? Maybe a few therapy sessions will be good for you. I know they helped me when I needed to talk.”
“How are you feeling?” Bruce comes over to join Steve on the couch.
The alpha keeps his hand on Steve’s head, ready to bash it against the wall again if he needed to. His other hand trails between where they’re pressed together, and Steve’s breath hitches when he realizes what the alpha is doing. He struggles again.
“We’ll both be there.”
The guilt is too much. It’s taking over every part of him, constantly reminding him of the horrible thing he was forced to do. He should be used to this feeling by now, and maybe over the years he’s learned to accept his fate, but this was different. This alpha was different.
“Can we go to DisneyWorld?” Peter asks randomly.
But now as he makes his way through the cemetery and toward the familiar gravesite, his heart clenches painfully. He takes a slow, deep breath to keep himself from breaking. His eyes fill with tears despite how much he wishes they wouldn’t, and he squeezes his eyes shut, not wanting to give into the pain.
“What’s there to talk about?” Flash asks, this time looking up at Peter. “We both don’t want it.”
He slips out, watching as his release spills and creates a mess on the sheets. Steve is still panting, his eyes closed and a look of pure satisfaction written on his face.
Natasha sets the car seat down and wraps Steve into a hug. “I’m here for you. I love you.”
“Save it,” Bucky waves his nephew off and rubs his sore back. “You’re home early. For once.”
Sarah sniffs and shakes her head. “My dress will get dirty.”
“I love you, Morgan. I’ll always love you. Be good okay?” Steve leans in to press a kiss to her head. “I’m sorry,” he whispers against her hair.
Tony mutters something under his breath and moves from his spot to begin putting away the food. The conversation gets dropped, but sooner or later one of them would bring it back up again. It was all anyone could think about.
Tony pulls him close, bringing Steve’s head down against his chest and he threads his fingers through his hair. “You’re not fine, are you? Tell me what’s wrong.”
“Please, Steve,” Tony tries to take a step forward and Steve backs away.
It was a struggle to get them calm enough to get into the vehicle, but they managed. They were comfortable around their mother and warming up to Tony. It was still a work in progress.
“I think he’s had too much sugar,” Happy frowns.
“What did I do? You said we met but you never said how. I did something to you and I want to know.”
Steve shakes his head. “No, Tony-”
Peter deserved to know what SHIELD had planned for his father. He had been the one suffering the most from the loss. But Nick didn’t want to give the boy false hope, and instead he kept a tight lip and watched as the boy eventually came to terms with the loss and grew from the grief.
The A.I.’s promise of safety usually eased Steve's worried mind, but tonight was different. Something felt off. Something felt wrong.
Tony swallows the lump that’s formed in his throat. “He was but they revived him, or maybe it was the serum. But he’s...I don’t know. I haven’t heard anything.”
Steve shakes his head at the question. His eyes are filling with tears again and he swallows the lump that has formed in his throat. “N-no,” he finally supplies a verbal answer, his voice shaky.
Tony is awakened by the sound of whimpering. At first he thinks it’s Peter waking up for his middle of the night feeding, but the whimpers grow louder, more terrified, and Tony opens his eyes, allowing them to adjust to the darkness before turning toward his mate. It’s Steve.
Peter sniffs and wipes at the tears running down his face. He chokes back a sob, and cups his mouth to hide any suspicious sounds from his parents.
“But we can do this, right? Like adults?”
When Tony comes home after another boring day at SI, he’s surprised to find Steve awake and lounging on the sofa. He’s not even aware that Tony’s walked through the front door. He’s deep in thought as he works in his sketchbook. Tony never thought he’d see Steve pick it up again.
“But…” Tony trails off, slightly hesitant to finish his thought. Steve is staring at him intently, his soft gaze urging him to continue. “You two can sleep here tonight. I bought a couple of things for him.”
“Just don’t scratch it,” Steve says.
Tony gasps like it’s the worst thing Steve has ever said to him. “I can’t go as Iron Man! That’s lazy! I want to be…” He pauses as he thinks it over a moment. “Something, but not that.”
“I am. I just...I’m supposed to be done. I promised this would be my last one.”
The pain worsens and he screams again.
Pepper sighs sadly. “You’re not. At least not really.”
The rest of the party isn’t all bad. The cake was delicious and the games weren’t the worst party games in the world. Tony would be lying if he said he didn’t grow upset when he lost. He blames his hormones.
“I’m surprised. You never sleep.”
Steve hugs him closer and leans down to kiss his head. “One day, Pete. And then I can train you.”
“If you don’t want to go…”
Anyway I hope you enjoy this next update!
Peter is falling asleep, comfortable and content in his father’s arms. Tony doesn’t want to let him go just yet, and he holds him for a little longer. It’s not until Steve is dozing off does he let the nurse take Peter back to his incubator.
Steve smiles sheepishly. “Yes…”
“I love you so much. You know that, right? I know sometimes...it doesn’t seem like it but I promise I love you more than anything. I’m going to get better okay? I may not be a perfect father but I’m trying.”
It seemed to be working though. At least, Steve would say they were anyway. Tony had to believe him.
He can’t help but wonder what his dad is doing at this moment and if he’s thinking about home too.
He huffs and leans back into his chair. He thinks back to that night and the fuzzy memory he had of the event. All he remembers was the brief mingling with the other guests and portions of the conversation with Pierce. He doesn’t remember chasing after any omega, but he remembers blue eyes.
The room he finds himself in is a complete contrast to the one he remembered. There’s no leather chairs, a bar; nothing. There’s no windows, only a metal door across the room that is bolted tightly into the wall.
Tony mental scolds himself.
“Oh.” Tony frowns. This was the first time he’s hearing this. “I didn’t know you were still going to go back out there.”
“I got it,” Tony says and kisses Steve again before disappearing to the kitchen with a very eager Harley behind him.
Steve smiles down at his son and runs his fingers through the messy brown hair. “I know. Jarvis isn’t...human.”
“Go,” she says. “I can handle Peter.”
“Dad, I got an A,” Morgan finally gets the chance to speak.
“Is the...is the pup moving?” Steve asks when the image shows the baby stretching its legs. Steve glances down at his belly, hoping to feel the movement.
“Honey? Steve, you okay?”
“Sir-” Steve starts, only to be silenced when Nick holds up a single hand.
Tony nods. “I can imagine. This must be...hard.”
“Of course. Don’t move .”
Peter continues to show his discomfort and Tony sighs. Steve is still crying, obviously just as upset as their son.
Well they’ve made up and I swear Tony is done doing stupid things. Unless you count going back to New York? 🤔 You know what, forget what I said 😆 And! Peter will be here soon!
Steve nods his head and lets out a small groan. “I swear his favorite time to kick me is right before bed.”
New items have been placed beneath the foot of the statue. Tony notices the stuffed animals that resemble the Captain, but it’s the crayon drawings of him left by his younger fan base that has the tears in his eyes flowing down his face.
It’s party time! I already know how the next chapter is going to go so I’m hoping I’ll get it updated tomorrow. It’s going to be...interesting 😳
When the elevator doors open, he is shoved out into another hallway. Rollins grips his arm tightly and drags him toward one of the empty rooms. It’s already been sanitized, the strong sterile scent has Steve wrinkling his nose.
Then there’s silence; they’re gone.
“Why are you apologizing?” Tony grows braver and steps closer to his omega. “That was amazing. I guess saying that was hot would be...weird...right? Forget it. You totally kicked their ass.”
Peter rolls his eyes and sits up, frowning down at his still open jeans. He gives up entirely and takes them off, cursing again when his right leg gets stuck.
He moves quickly and quietly through the dark corridor. The elevator comes into view. It was his only way off this current floor. He steps inside and the doors close behind him.
The cars behind them are still honking. Tony drives off and they’re once again in silence.
A few minutes later, he gives up and leaves the safety of the bathroom. He shuts the light off behind him and pokes his head out into the hall, looking both ways before stepping out and heading downstairs to greet his parents.
They fall into a silence.
Pepper’s eyes widen and Tony prepares himself for the next round of yelling. She doesn’t scream or yell like Tony thought she would. She collapses into the empty chair, a shocked look appearing over her face.
“She’ll get it. She’s a smart kid. I got the keys.” Tony holds up the set of keys and they jingle in his hand. Morgan’s eyes are immediately drawn to the shiny new object.
Peter nods and Tony knows he has no choice but to play the game.
Tony from the beginning had been an alpha that Steve admired. They had their fair share of struggles like all couples do, but at the end of it all, Steve was going to choose Tony no matter what. It had been Tony who rescued him and their young pup, Peter. If not for him, Steve’s not sure what kind of horror him and his pup would’ve faced.
“Sorry. What can I do? Natasha says you love foot rubs.”
The journal is resting over Steve’s belly as he draws. For once their son isn’t kicking up a storm and allowing Steve to sketch without the baby pushing the journal off when he stretched. Tony watches as Steve works, drawn to the way Steve’s brow furrows slightly or when the tip of his tongue pokes out between his lips.
“Maybe we both did. I asked for too much and-”
“Go,” Tony whispers. “Take him and run. I’ll hold him off.”
“He’s here.”
“Steve,” Tony pants and thrusts harder, hitting Steve’s prostate with each thrust. The base of his cock tingles, his knot growing and rubbing against Steve’s sensitive rim. “I’m gonna knot you. Fuck.”
He really hopes Steve isn’t listening from wherever he is.
“Listen, Pete,” Sam starts, making sure his voice is leveled. Peter looks up at him, and then for the first time in days, glances at Bucky. It’s not a full glance, but at least their eyes met. “We haven’t talked about that night.”
“Ah.”
Steve sighs and flips through the book, skipping over most of the letters until he’s in the P section. He doesn’t even bother reading the ones he comes across, knowing Tony will only harass him.
“She does like putting her fingers in her mouth.”
“P-Pete.”
Tony quickly invites Steve in and shuts the door.
Steve shakes his head again.
“Buck?” He mumbles. There’s a moment of silence and Steve peers up, expecting to find his friend asleep. Bucky’s eyes are closed but he doesn’t appear to be sleeping.
Steve shakes his head. More tears run down his face. “I lost the baby.”
“You’ll be there, right?”
“I need you to come home. Tony, please, I-I need you...I can’t…”
They begin making their way over to the rest of the group.
He doesn’t tell anyone. His uncle told him he could talk to him or his aunt about it, but he can’t bring himself to do it. They’d probably question his choice or maybe be disappointed in it.
Steve’s jolted awake, gasping at the realization of dozing off with his son still in his arms. Once glance down shows Peter still curled up in his arms and fast asleep, his tiny mouth barely hanging onto Steve’s nipple.
“He’s okay,” Sam says while they clean up. Peter glances at him and then back at the plate he’s drying. “You don’t have to worry about him. You’re dealing with enough as it is.”
Tony chuckles softly and moves toward Steve’s side. “I know. We knew this wasn’t going to be easy.”
“Lower,” Steve instructs and Bucky does as he’s told. “Other hand, Buck. I can take it.”
“I know. But...it’s Steve. I can’t…”
“My part? Who the hell do you think gets up every time Morgan wakes up?”
Steve stops cleaning up to send a glare his husband’s way. “That’s not going to help.”
Steve pushes harder, using every bit of strength he has to bring his son into the world. His efforts pay off, and with a pained yell, Peter is sliding from his body and into the doctor’s awaiting arms.
“A baby! Tony, what the hell is going on!”
“I’m sorry,” Steve whispers.
The alpha offers his hand and Steve shakes it and introduces himself. “ Steve Rogers.”
Peter can only nod.
“I don’t want to do this again,” Tony says. Steve lifts his head to meet Tony’s eyes and Tony continues, “This. I can’t. I don’t want this anymore. I hate seeing you like this. I hate...I hate all of it.”
“It is, but I promise it’s a good difference. Look what you did.” Tony gestures to the happy baby just a few feet away from them. “Look at her. We have her because of you.”
“Just hear me out. I’m having a baby in a few weeks and I want to devote all of my time to that little boy. Steve is going to need me more than ever and I don’t see how I can be there for them and run this place. I’d rather step down and let you take over. You’re the best person qualified for the job.”
It’s over in minutes.
The sound of his phone snaps him from his thoughts and Tony quickly accepts the call.
Peter shakes his head. The phone rings again and he quickly declines the incoming call.
“I always go. Why do you think I bothered to show up to this thing?” Tony questions. Steve doesn’t miss the way his tone turns bitter.
“I wish I could just stay here and help. I love building things.”
Steve nods again and he turns his attention to Morgan. She’s still awake and playing with her fingers. He smiles and gets down on one knee to be at her level. He reaches for one of her hands, chuckling when she grasps his finger.
“Thanks, Uncle Bucky,” Peter says instead.
Steve turns away, settling his gaze on the ceiling above while he’s looked over. It’s not until a cool gel is applied to his belly does he allow himself to focus on the exam. He already knows what happens next, but he can’t help but grow curious when the doctor pulls up images of the baby.
“Not sleeping,” Tony says and he lifts his head. “Although a nap sounds pretty good right about now.”
“Peter’s cute.” Natasha smiles. “I like it.”
Peter nods and he leads Flash out of his room and downstairs. He curses to himself when hears both of his parents in the kitchen.
“Petey,” Steve soothes, reaching into the crib to take his son into his arms. Peter reacts to the touch with a whimper, his eyes opening for a moment before squeezing shut and his bottom lip jutting out. “Shh, it’s okay. I’m sorry.”
With a sigh of defeat Tony gives up on the designs. Right now all he had was a basic blueprint. He still needed to know the type of powers his son possessed in order for the suit to work for him.
Peter groans. “I’ll keep the door open! Can I just have some privacy please?”
“I know, but maybe you shouldn’t. Is this worth it?” Tony asks.
in his kitchen. “Unless he’s making dinner tonight, otherwise I want him out.”
He hated the idea of sending Steve away and locking him up in a place where he didn’t need to be. Steve just needed better therapy, maybe daily support groups instead of weekly. Something! Anything was better than Steve being placed in a facility.
“Shh,” the alpha soothes. “It’ll feel good. I promise.”
It’s the exact same thing he did with Steve and the Avengers, and Rhodey, Pepper, Happy, Jarvis, and now his son. Everyone he ever cared about was kicked to the curb while he ran and hid. It wasn’t fair to any of them.
He opens the door to greet his mate, his stomach clenching at the deep frown on Tony’s face.
“You know he’s-okay, glad it’s not just me that sees it. But he’s fine, right? I don’t need to worry?”
Steve huffs and gestures for his husband to lead the way.
Pepper rolls her eyes again. “I had to learn from JARVIS that you wanted me to cancel the meeting with the interns and the conference call, which by the way, really upset the board members. And then you ignored me.”
He tears his eyes away and snaps his head up when he hears a familiar cry. Natasha is coming toward them with the carseat in one hand and the diaper bag slung around her shoulder. Her eyes are red and slightly puffy; she’s been crying.
“Thanks, kid. And I’m fine. I like being alone.”
It’s settled then and there. They were done trying.
“Sorry for what? You didn’t do anything. I never should’ve left. I'm sorry. But I'm almost-"
But Nick Fury was an uncommon name. It didn’t help that he was an alpha.
“He’s so little, Papa!” Peter giggles and pokes at his brother’s tiny fingers. Those same fingers wrap around one of his own and Peter gasps, eyes going wide and head snapping up to peer up at his papa’s smiling face. “He held my finger! Papa, look! I think he likes me!”
Peter sniffs and releases a small sob. He peers up at Tony with red-rimmed eyes. “What did you do?”
“And if it doesn’t work? Tony, we’ve already tried-”
You guys I am so sorry! Life has been crazy and then I decided to take a little break from writing. I ended up binging a show (Teen Wolf. I know I’m super late 🤦♀️) but I’m ready to make more time for writing now. I definitely missed it! Thank you so much for being patient and for always supporting me 😊
“My apologies.”
“But I’m not him.”
“I know. And that’s okay. This is why we’re here. I want you to feel like yourself again.”
Steve moves quickly, grabbing the nearest trash can in the corner of the room and rushing back to his husband, thrusting it in his lap. Tony ducks his head in the can and the room fills the sound of his retching. The team can only stare with wide eyes as their teammate vomits. The only one amused with the situation is Clint.
“You’re really not gonna give him up, huh?” Sam says and Steve glances up at him, his face heating up slightly for being called out. “It’s okay,” Sam laughs. “If it was me I’d do the same thing.”
“He’s almost there,” Sam assures, and he sends Steve a wink. “You’re a lot stronger than you think, Steve.”
“What-what makes you say that?”
For most of the party Tony keeps to himself. He finds himself bouncing back between being alone or attached to Bruce’s hip. Peter gives Tony company when he can, but he gets carried away mingling with the rest of his family.
“I know.”
Tony knew better than to ask Peter about the night Steve died. He was curious and wanted to know more, but at the same time he wasn’t sure if he could handle the details. Steve had died protecting others. That’s all Tony needed to know.
“Thank you, Tony.”
“Sorry.”
It may not seem like a lot, but Steve’s agreement for them to talk is a big deal. In the past, talking was one of things they failed to get right. They had tried, but somehow their conversations always shifted and turned into a fight. Battling it out with each other was easier.
Tony lets out a sigh of defeat. “Okay.”
But that all seemed like such a long time ago. They had been broken up for months, and during that time, barely saw or said a single word to each other. The birth of their son changed all that, and Peter’s presence was working on them again. They were working things out, rekindling their love. And now they were going on a date.
The alpha leads him out of the room and the door slams shut behind them.
Steve flushes with embarrassment and hides his face in the crook of Tony’s neck. Tony huffs in annoyance, but he knows the AI was right. The pups were healing nicely. The last thing they needed was another traumatic event.
“Got it. And thanks, J.”
“I didn’t do any-”
“Okay.” Peter nods and returns his gaze back to the screen. This time, he can’t take his eyes off it.
“My apologies, sir. I’m happy that you and Mr. Rogers are alive and safe.”
“I know.” Tony takes Steve’s hand and gives it a gentle squeeze. “We can keep trying. That is always the fun part, right?”
Steve appeared happy to see his friends again, but it was the sight of his daughter that had his eyes glistening again. Natasha brings Morgan over and Steve welcomes her with open arms. He holds her close, his body shaking with the sobs that he can no longer conceal. Tony has to blink back his own tears. He never realized how much Steve truly missed their daughter.
“I had fun,” Steve says once they’re in the elevator. Tony smiles and reaches for Steve’s hand, intertwining their fingers. “Maybe we can make this a recurring thing.”
Steve thrusts slowly, relishing the feeling of having Tony enveloped around him. He increases the movement of his hips until he’s fucking Tony hard. Tony cries out, his arms shaking, struggling to keep him upright.
“You mean the side that tortures and brainwashes omegas? Yeah, it's a great side. Let me guess, you have jackets?”
That was the night everything changed between him and Tony. Their relationship was already being put to the test on a daily basis, and all it took to finally break them was one night together. They hadn’t argued or fought, for once they seemed normal, like they stood a chance of being something more.
Steve winces and rubs at his belly. “I think it’s time.”
Harley is the first to finish his milk. He holds up his empty glass and asks, “More?”
Tony rolls his eyes. “Whatever. Tomorrow you’re doing most of the talking. Maybe I’ll drag Pepper up here to help. She’ll probably want to meet him.”
“Fine,” Tony grumbles. He hates losing.
Peter turns back to the unopened message and taps on the icon to read the text from his dad. Another smile breaks across his face as he reads the message.
“You okay?” Tony decides to ask. He lays his hand over Steve’s shoulder, pulling away quickly when the contact startles the omega. “Sorry,” Tony apologizes.
The break was nice.
Tony’s entering his second trimester. The nausea has finally run its course and the fatigue wasn’t what it used to be. Tony had more energy, and he made sure to take advantage of it. Steve had to have the lab locked down.
“Tony?” Steve rushes toward him, laying one hand over his husband’s back. “What’s wrong?”
He brushes it off.
“You never figured it out. I had to plant the idea of
Tony never gets down on one knee and spills his whole heart out. There’s nothing, no signals whatsoever. Steve had misinterpreted everything, and he can’t help the feeling of disappointment that washes over him.
Steve huffs out a laugh. “I guess there are some things that stop the Avengers.”
It was comfortable, Steve will give it that. But he still felt ridiculous.
Steve sighs. “Okay. Let me know if you need anything.”
The words taste something terrible in his mouth. It was far from great, but he can’t say that out loud.
He was just like Steve, willing to put his family and friends before himself.
“I know.” Tony rises to his feet and moves closer to his husband, taking his hands. “But you want this.”
It’s a lot easier to find someone outside of their little circle of friends to help Steve. Tony had been against the idea of going through S.H.I.E.L.D-he didn’t like the thought of them knowing about Steve’s condition-but it was one of the better options. They would at least keep the information private and prevent it from ever getting leaked to the press. Steve didn’t need to be broadcasted right now.
Tony is facing the stove, his back turned. He curses quietly to himself and quickly reaches for the wooden spoon he has set out on the counter. Steve can’t help but smirk at the scene in front of him.
Tony inhales sharply and sends his friend a quick look before turning back to his mate. “And what about you? Do you really enjoy sneaking out to your meetings?”
“I know! I’m not…” Tony lets out a sigh when Morgan grows fussy again. Natasha holds out her hands and Tony gently passes his daughter to her. Tony sighs again and scrubs a hand over his face. “I know he wouldn’t. But you weren’t there, Nat. He was so...angry. I got scared. I had to protect my baby.”
“It’s getting kinda cramped in there, huh?” Tony chuckles softly. “Almost there, kiddo. Your Papa, big brother, and I can’t wait to meet you.”
Tony sighs and sets his tablet aside, then he quickly grabs the pacifier Steve loved to claim was Peter’s favorite, and offers it to his son. Peter accepts it immediately and soon the room is filled with the soft suckling he makes and the hum of the swing’s motor.
Steve doesn’t mean to scoff but the sound comes out before he can even stop it. “Sorry. I just- how? You’re an omega and are successful and can do all these things and-”
“I know. Do you think we’ll get to see any of those things happen? Or is Tony going to witness all of it?”
“We-”
Tony frowns. “No, I can’t say that I’ve seen him. I’m really busy and don’t have time to get out myself. But I’ll keep an eye out. What does he look like?”
“Don’t. You were right. It’s...me. What else can it be?”
Anyway! I hope you all enjoy this chapter and thank you so much for being awesome! 😊
The mission was complete.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve sobs softly into Tony’s chest, his tears wetting the hospital gown. Tony holds him close, rocking him softly like he would Peter when the pup was fussy.
They fall into another silence, and when Tony glances down at his omega, he finds him fast asleep. Tony holds him close, and gently runs his fingers through Steve’s hair, hoping the gentle touches are enough to calm him. His sugary scent returns.
Tony turns toward him. “It’s okay,” he assures. “It’s not like it was your fault.”
“But this...this is his.” Peter touches the shield. “I’m not the person to wield it. I...I’m not him, Mr. Fury, Sir.”
“Not anymore. Now you can get back to it and be happy again.”
“Oh. Um...I guess I figured you were-”
“Uh,” Peter takes a moment to think about it. He leans against the workbench and bites down on his bottom lip.
Instead of brewing a pot of coffee in the comfort of his own home, he snuck out of his tower to visit a local cafe just a few blocks from SI. Pepper was going to kill him.
Steve pushes again, groaning when he feels himself stretch. The baby’s head emerges fully, followed by a gush of fluid, and Steve collapses back, panting hard as he tries to regain his breathing. “Tony...please…” Steve begs, wanting him to take away the excruciating pain.
Peter scrambles to make himself presentable and then, after taking a calming breath, he steps out of the stall and toward the row of sinks, purposely taking the one closest to the stall he just walked out of. The voices die down, but Peter knows better than to acknowledge the small groups of punks that tease him on a daily basis.
He crashes and lands outside of the room, gasping when the air is knocked out of him. Steve winces and tries to get up, only to slump down when his stomach erupts with pain. It’s worse than before, so strong that it brings tears to his eyes. Steve groans and rolls over onto his back, wrapping one arm around his middle.
“Let me help you.”
“No! No, dad, everything’s fine. I’ve been busy. School’s almost done so I have tests to prepare for and then I’m training with Auntie Nat.”
“Oh then in that case.” Happy has no problem turning over the bags. “It’s about time you get used to carrying someone else’s things. Pretty soon you’re gonna have a diaper bag around your shoulder.”
“I’m-I’m having a son. I’m so happy.”
Steve shakes his head. “I can’t.”
“Then why are you so afraid of me? Did I beat you too?”
“Hopefully that one worked,” Tony says and he lies down beside Steve.
“You can sleep now, Pete,” Tony whispers and softly kisses the top of Peter’s head. “I’ll be here when you wake up.”
“I don’t know. Since this morning.”
“She has been waiting a long time,” Steve points out.
“Oh yeah.”
Peter ignores him at first and continues getting the supplies he needs. “I want to,” he eventually says. “It’s my fault you look like that.”
“Come on. Take them off.” Tony reaches down to take Steve’s hand and place it on the hem of his briefs. Steve slides the article of clothing down until Tony’s cock is popping out and resting against his belly, leaking evidence of his arousal at the tip. Tony takes his cock in hand, stroking it from root to tip, a playful smirk appearing over his face when he finds Steve’s eyes dark with lust.
“One.”
That's all I wanted to say.
“You know you could slow down.” Sam hunches over, grabbing his knees and panting heavily. “Some of us aren’t like you.”
“Daddy will be home soon. He’s busy at the tower.”
“Ah fuck!” Tony cries and he reaches out to pull Steve close and in for a kiss. Steve moves faster, desperate to get Tony off. “Come on, Steve. Harder!”
“What!” Steve snaps his head up, eyes widening at the question being asked. “No! I can’t be-I’m not..ah!”
“Jesus.” Tony runs a hand through his hair. He’s beginning to lose his cool as he absorbs the words Steve is telling him. He was always curious about Steve’s past, but hearing it for the first time makes him regret wanting to learn. “I’ll kill him. If I see him I swear to God-”
“Pa-pa!” Morgan says again when she sees the person she’s been missing.
They’re currently curled up in bed with Tony on the verge of passing out and Steve lying beside him. Steve is holding Tony close, gently rubbing his hand up and down his arm. His other hand is where it always is these days-resting on the small bump.
A single tear rolls down his face and Steve curses himself for getting worked up. This was not the time or place for his hormones and issues to make an appearance.
Tony’s a little surprised to find Steve still waiting in the conference room. He doesn’t know why he thought Steve would run away again after what he’s been through, but Tony would’ve understood if Steve tried to book it. They were strangers. How could Steve trust him?
“Thanks.”
Tony stretches out his hand, finding Steve’s and giving it a reassuring squeeze. “Hey,” he says softly, and Steve finally looks at him. “He’s okay. You heard what the doctor said. Just a few more days.”
“You don’t look fine.”
“Steve.” Someone is holding him, pinning him down. Steve screams again, struggling to break free. “Steve!”
“Okay. What do you need, pal?”
At least Tony and Peter are talking again. Now Peter gets to see his baby for the first time 😊
“I know,” Sam says calmly. “I told Nick the same thing. But since Tony’s out…”
Tony can’t take his eyes off the little smiley face staring back at him. He frowns, his expression opposite from the result the test shows. Was he supposed to be that happy? Was he supposed to wear a huge grin?
“I’m not leaving you. Tony-”
Tony is hesitant for a moment, then he nods his head. Peter is gently placed over his chest and Tony smiles down at him. Peter whimpers again, clenching his tiny hand before finding Tony’s t-shirt and grasping it.
Steve glances down at his son, tears streaming down his face. “Hi, Pete. Welcome to the world.”
Maybe he wouldn’t have ended up like this.
“Maybe,” Jarvis says. “Don’t lose hope.”
Just thinking about him brings more tears to Peter’s eyes. He thought he was doing pretty good when it came to the death of his father. The pain of losing a loved one was always going to be there, but Peter promised he wouldn’t let it take control of his life. He was trying to move on and be happy, just like he knew his papa would want him to be.
“Mr. Stark is down in his lab. I’ll grant you access.”
Tony turns in his seat to watch Steve serve himself a glass of juice and grab a muffin while he chats with Bucky. Steve is nodding along to whatever Bucky is telling him, but the reaction isn’t what it normally is whenever he’s around his best friend. Steve seems distant, uninterested in whatever Bucky is saying.
“Because no one else trusts me. Your bodyguard, that omega. They don’t trust me.”
“Hang on,” Tony says and pushes his security guard away. He looks Peter over, brows furrowing slightly. Peter can’t help but tense up. His eyes were hidden behind the sunglasses, preventing Peter from seeing the hard look he was currently given him. “What do you want?”
“But like why?” Sam can no longer contain his laughter. Peter joins in.
“Seems like it.”
“Doesn’t feel good.” Tony grunts and pushes again, listening to the instructions to bear down a little harder. He’s offered a chance to feel his son’s exposed head, but he holds off, deciding to not waste any time and just get the baby out. He wanted to be rid of the excruciating pain.
“And Pete looks like a Stark.”
“I’ll get off them,” Steve whispers into the dark after they’ve finished and they’re wrapped in each other’s arms. “I know you want another baby.”
“I don’t think he can,” Bucky frowns and offers a hand to his nephew. He pulls Peter up to his feet and pats him gently on the shoulder. “You okay, punk?”
Everyone nods in agreement.
The call ends and Tony gives up on continuing the suit designs. He sets his tablet aside and scoots closer to his son, then he hunches over to unfasten the tiny seatbelt around Peter’s form.
There was no doubting how Steve was going to be. Maybe a mother hen, if Tony was being honest, but Steve would show the same amount of love and adoration for their son. Of course one of them was going to have to be the hardass. They’d leave that job to Natasha.
He’s not expecting Sam to have the same idea and he turns to leave, but Sam calls out to him and Tony has no choice but to give in.
Tony snorts. “Is that what he called it?”
“Of course I had to. I said I’d be there.”
“On your left,” Sam croaks, his voice thick and raspy. Peter’s head snaps at the sound, tears flooding his eyes and streaming down his face.
The pain passes, giving him a break from the discomfort. Steve makes his way into the bathroom, turning on the shower and letting the water heat up. He strips from his suit, hissing from the aches in his body.
“You don’t look so good, honey.” Tony is frowning now and he sits up to get a better look at his husband. “Steve, you look like you’re gonna spew.”
“That good, huh?” Tony smirks and Steve opens his eyes and lifts his head.
Of course Steve complained when he caught him serving himself another cup of coffee or when he promised he’d be upstairs for dinner and ended up working for another two hours until Steve had to drag him away. Secretly, Tony liked it when Steve intervened. It reminded him that someone was looking out for him.
Tony chuckles softly. “We don’t know how to break up, remember?”
“Tony, you know what I need. You know where I need to be.”
“I hope he’s more like you.”
“Honey, what’s wrong?” Tony asks.
And for the most part Steve did. He continued to go to his meetings and create new relationships with the faces he encountered every Wednesday and Friday. Steve felt safe and welcome in his group, but more importantly he felt as if he had a purpose now.
They both turn around and the larger man-Peter is able to read his badge and discovers he’d head of security- approaches, ready to block Peter from getting any closer.
Steve nods but it’s obvious he’s still concerned. He takes another drink of his coffee then sets it down and steps closer to feel his son’s forehead.
“Then what’s with the face.”
Steve glances up when he senses one of the nearby alphas, and meets the dark gaze of Rollins. Before Steve can even beg, the alpha moves in and rips the pup out of his arms. Steve cries out again and fights to get his son back. His fingers brush against the blanket still around Peter’s body, but he can’t fully grasp it and the alpha turns away with the pup.
“I trust you,” Steve assures and he kisses Tony softly.
When Peter does wake up, it’s to the sensation of someone stroking his face. Peter groans and his eyes flutter open, immediately locking with familiar blue ones. His papa is staring at him, a tired smile on his face. But it’s the bruises and blood that has Peter gasping and sitting up in bed.
“We all really really miss you. Nothing’s been the same and…and…”
Steve sighs. “I love you. Have a good day.”
“Don’t blame my pillow. Or me. I’m not a bed hog.”
It does the opposite.
“No, we’re good,” Morgan assures.
Steve whines sadly and buries his nose in the crook of Tony’s neck, inhaling the comforting scent his alpha naturally gives off.
It’s not just Tony and Morgan who visit. Their friends stop by when they can. The visits aren’t as frequent, but Steve understands when duty calls.
“Steve, stop. Your body doesn’t work. If it did then we would still have our son.”
“Hmm…” Steve pretends to think it over. “I guess. But that’s five minutes less of what you get from me.”
Finding Rumlow wasn’t going to be easy, but Tony was hoping he’d find the alpha before anyone else did. The last thing he needed was to be overtaken without Steve by his side.
He’s careful when he positions himself on top, not wanting to apply too much pressure and force Tony deep into the mattress. It takes a moment for him to get used to the new position.
“They don’t have favorites.”
Steve sniffs and glances down at his lap, hiding the tears from Tony. But Tony knows they’re there and he reaches for Steve’s hand again. This time Steve doesn’t pull away.
Steve’s breath hitches in his throat and tears gather in his eyes, a few escaping and rolling down his face. He doesn’t stick around to hear anymore and he slips out the front door, away from the party and the alpha he thought had loved him.
“I like this one.” Steve comes over to show Tony the shade of blue he wants to paint the room. Tony makes a face and Steve frowns. “What? It’s simple.”
It was hard on both of them, but they were strong, just like Tony said they were.
Tony can’t help but roll his eyes. “I think you have a pregnancy kink. Maybe that’s why you’re…”
Tony scoffs. “Yeah, that’s going to go well. Once he finds out I’m not comfortable with him being alone with our baby he’ll lose his mind. I don’t know. I’ll figure it out.”
“Yes. You can use whatever you want here and if you need something else just let me know. This will be your personal space, lab, whatever. I just really need your help.”
But the team is all together again and Peter gets his happy ending. And new cousins! One day I’ll write that SamBucky story.
It was Sam’s idea that Steve get a job as a counselor and run his own sessions. Steve had been hesitant at first. His plan was to stay home with his children. They were still young and needed his attention. But when he brought the idea up to Tony, the alpha didn’t hesitate to give Steve his opinion. After discussing it thoroughly and thinking it over until his brain couldn’t think anymore, Steve made the decision to become a counselor and aid others like him.
Once Morgan has had her fill, Steve burps her then he takes her to the changing table to clean her up. He dresses her quickly.
Flash sighs harshly and sits down. “There. Happy?”
“But it’s not fair to you.”
Happy scoffs and follows after him. “Cool isn’t the word I’d use.”
Pepper rolls her eyes and takes the gift to place with the others. The next one-Steve makes sure they read the tag before tearing into the gift-is from Clint and Laura. They gave them a nursing pillow and a breast pump, something Clint made sure to joke about. It wasn’t amusing in the slightest and earned him a punch in the shoulder from Nat.
“Let’s just say Pierce is someone we’ve also been keeping an eye on.”
“Sorry,” Tony quickly apologizes and leads the bottle back to his son’s lips. Peter latches on and nurses again. “I swear I’m trying okay? I don’t have any of this figured out yet, but I’ll do my best.”
Steve knows he won’t shoot, and with mustered courage, he plunges the syringe deep into the beta’s neck, the room filling with the man’s screams of pain. Bullets fly toward him and Steve uses the man in his grasp as a shield, taking the hit instead of him. When the gunfire ceases, Steve takes advantage and with a harsh shove, throws the lifeless beta man toward Rollins, catching the alpha off guard.
Tony is obviously not worried about any of that because the sounds he makes rise in volume and he doesn’t stop begging Steve to fuck him. Steve increases the pace, searching for that spot that he knows will make Tony scream.
“Can we just talk? Please?”
Luckily for him, Peter is the one who finally puts an end to the heavy silence.
Bruce says something else to Peter and then Peter is leaving and rushing toward the elevators.
Peter warily puts them on. Nothing happens. “I’m confused…”
“My...my s-son. Bucky, my...my…”
And he was never going to let anyone hurt him or their pups again.
“Never.” Peter pulls back slightly so their eyes can meet. Steve doesn’t miss how shiny they appear. “You’ll come back, right?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony scoffs and takes a swig from his beer. “I highly doubt that.”
Morgan keeps her gaze locked on his face, listening contently to the familiar voice. Tony smiles and brings her closer to press his lips against her forehead. “You’ll be okay.”
“I want to feel if he moves. I think it’s my favorite part about you being pregnant. Oh and not to mention no more rock hard abs. You’re finally normal. Captain America is just like us,” Natasha teases.
“I can’t-I can’t. Tony, I can’t d-do this. I can’t. I can’t.”
“I’ve missed her so much,” Steve says against Morgan’s soft hair and he presses a kiss there. He hasn’t let her go since Tony took her out of the car seat and handed her to him. He presses another kiss to her head. “She hasn’t been too fussy has she?”
Harley points at the doorway, giggling happily when Tony comes in with the double stroller that carries their younger pups. Peter is fast asleep and Sarah is babbling to her new doll that Tony insisted she needed. It’s not until she notices Steve does her face light up and the doll is forgotten.
“Jesus, kid. You can’t keep sneaking up on me.”
He doesn’t bring it up to Steve. But he packs it away for later.
“That’s enough!” Pierce bellows. “Take him back and make sure he’s secured tight. We need him.”
“I’m good, Mr. Stark. I need to get home before Aunt May freaks out.”
Peter sniffs and shakes his head. She immediately pulls him into her arms, hugging him tightly and letting him sob into her chest. Her own eyes fill with tears.
Steve moves away from the door, only managing to take a few steps before he’s doubling over and crying out from another contraction. He pants heavily, tears streaking his face when the pain worsens.
“If I may make a suggestion, sir. JJ isn’t half bad if I do say so myself.”
Happy’s brows knit together. “Sick?”
“What about your job?”
Peter nods and follows her out of the room. This time he leaves the door open.
The bedroom is in the same state as the rest of the apartment; red petals are littered around the floor and the large bed. It’s not just the petals that catches Steve’s eye. A white teddy bear is sitting in the center of the bed with a box wrapped in red paper.
“We’re fine. She’s smiling more and has officially fit her toes in her mouth.” Steve laughs at this, the sound bringing a smile to Tony’s face. It’s been so long since he’s heard that beautiful sound. “And she’s so smart. Tummy time is the best. I think I enjoy it more than she does.”
“I’m sorry,” Steve says, snapping Tony from his thoughts. Their eyes meet. “I didn’t mean for this to happen. I didn’t know if I was ever going to find you. You’re not obligated to help me with this. I can raise this pup on my own.”
Steve smiles softly. “Yeah, I guess. I’m just...nervous. He’s so tiny and what if something happens?”
Tony is awoken during the middle of the night to the sounds of Steve’s retching. The light is on in the adjoined bathroom and the door is slightly ajar. Tony gets out of bed to investigate, pushing open the door and finding his husband on his knees and clinging tightly to the toilet bowl.
Of course it was the party thrown for him that Peter enjoyed the most. That wasn’t saying his uncle’s breakfast wasn’t good, in fact, it was the best thing to to wake up to. And Peter couldn’t wait to wake up every morning to his uncle’s cooking.
Peter smiles and nods his head, then he follows Sam down the hall and toward the extra bedroom. He hadn’t been over in some time, but the room still looked the same. The only difference was that it was a bit messier than the last time.
“No more abs, Cap.”
“He needed help,” Natasha adds.
“Where’s Uncle-” Peter pauses when his hair is ruffled and he turns, finding the person he had been asking about.
Steve ducks his head down to place a kiss on the top of Tony’s head, then he leaves the room to call the doctor and get more blueberries.
The tears burst free, rolling down Peter’s face. “Please?” He begs, unsure if the begging is for this to end or for his papa to not leave him again.
Steve gives Tony a kiss then he slips out of the room to give Tony some privacy. Pepper’s incoming call immediately comes through.
“Where’s my kisses?” Comes a familiar voice and both Peter and Tony glance up.
It’s not until Sam and Peter make their way home does Sam decide to ask his nephew about the decision to give up the shield.
Steve nods and sniffs again.
Finally the doctor appears and Tony immediately begs her for relief. He’s only at three centimeters and had a ways to go, but at least it would be pain-free.
“Our friends, sweetheart.” Tony sits up to stretch, the muscles in his shoulders popping. “They like you,” he adds when he notices the look of uncertainty on Steve’s face. “Honest. If it’s Happy you’re worried about-”
Harley’s blue eyes roam over the color pallet Tony has brought up on the screen. Then he points at red.
“I’m sorry I’m not the good guy. I know you think that.”
“What for? Hey, talk to me,” Tony urges softly when he knows Steve is shutting down. “Steve, whatever it is, you can tell me. I love you.”
“It’s not! All they wanted was a baby. I want one so bad.”
Steve smiles softly at his son. “Yeah, baby. We get to keep him forever.”
Alpha pulls away, a pleased sigh escaping him. “I don’t know if I can resist you any longer.”
“It’s going to take time. I’m proud of how much you’ve grown since then. What Tony experienced wasn’t the same as what you had, and he probably just needs more time.”
Tony comes back over and Steve scoots over. There was no reason for him to make room when the bed was large enough to hold them comfortably, but Steve can’t help but move so that Tony could be comfortable. Alpha’s always came first.
“Are we going to finish our project?” Peter asks.
“I’m fine.” It’s obvious she’s lying, but Peter knows better than to call her out. “You’re home kind of late.”
“You two need to make up,” Steve sighs and reaches for his glass, taking a sip of the red wine.
His lab was always a distraction, his go to when he couldn’t wrap his mind around the curves life threw at him. He had Bruce to work alongside him. Sometimes they wouldn’t emerge for hours, and though some might say it was an issue, for Tony it was his time to focus on something else.
He didn’t want to risk it.
Steve pauses, having felt the same jolt of energy. He clears his throat and tries to focus on finishing the pasta. He doesn’t know why he’s affected by the touch. Tony has done more as far as physical contact goes. The many times they’ve shared a bed and he’s found himself wrapped in Tony’s arms was the first example that comes to mind. He doesn’t want to think about what happened in
“No,” Steve shakes his head. “This’ll go away after the baby’s born. Or maybe even before.”
The first stall is occupied, saving Peter from any embarrassment and teasing. He washes his hands and dries them hurriedly, not caring if they’re still a little damp. One look in the mirror shows that in fact his eyes and nose are red. He looks like a wreck.
He blames himself for ending up here. Disobeying was what got him locked away. It was punishment for his actions. No omega was to disobey their alpha.
“You have no idea. I mean I love her to death but...it’s a lot. I think if you’re handing out breaks then give one to Steve first.”
“Steve’s.”
Tony lets out a sigh and rubs at his forehead. “I swear I’m trying. Everything’s changing.”
And I didn’t forget about JARVIS! He needs to meet the pups too!
“I won’t hurt him. He is a good guy. Everything he’s done for me and our son....I’ve never had that before. I knew there were good alphas out there but after what happened to me, I guess I lost hope. But Tony changed that. I love him, and I’d never ever hurt him.”
His relationship with Steve was changing. Ever since they kissed and expressed their true feelings, they’ve grown closer. There was still so much they needed to learn about each other, but they were working on it.
“‘Kay. And I won’t break your LEGO’s.”
“You’re panicking.”
Steve frowns as he thinks it over. He hadn’t had a chance to look for one yet. Tony had returned back into his life and turned it upside down for the second time, all in the span of five minutes.
“Hang on. Are you alone?”
“Do you want to talk about it?”
“I’m afraid I can’t answer for him. To be honest I don’t know what’s going on in that unusually large brain of his.
“Relax, Stark,” Nick says when he picks up on the alpha’s warning, “I’m not a threat to you.”
Steve was a clean and organized person; the military was responsible for that, and when it came to putting things away, Steve was on it. He was always working hard to keep the place clean, so it's a surprise when Tony walks in to find the living room littered with Peter’s items.
“You’re hilarious.” Steve rolls his eyes and pushes Tony’s hands away. “But a new suit wouldn’t hurt.”
“Fine, I guess,” Peter says with a small shrug. “I can eat better now and-”
“I don’t feel anything-”
Tony pulls away and attaches his lips to Steve’s neck, placing kisses and soft bites along the pale skin. Steve gasps softly and tilts his head to the side to offer Tony better access. Their lips meet again in a desperate and urgent kiss, tongues battling each other for dominance. Steve is deemed the winner.
“Oh my God!” Pepper cries and rubs at her head. “What did you do!”
Harley’s cries interrupt. Steve groans and scrubs a hand over his face.
Tony continues to run his fingers through Steve’s hair, smiling softly when Steve relaxes and his eyes flutter. “Go to sleep. I’m right here okay?”
Peter slams his bedroom door hard behind him, not caring if he gets in more trouble for it. He won’t be around anyway.
The baby was growing more and more every day. The small bump Steve usually kept hidden under his clothes was now becoming difficult to hide. Tony’s purchased him a new wardrobe and continued to add new clothing whenever Steve had another growth spurt.
“What for?”
Peter comes down a few minutes later, just in time to witness the stare down currently going down. He awkwardly steps between them, moving toward the fridge to get a bottle of water.
Steve doesn’t ask him to stay like he normally does. Maybe they weren’t okay after all.
“I’ll be fine. Technically I’m still resting if I’m on the couch, right?” Steve retorts.
“P-please! Alpha, please!”
“We train every weekend. Come on, dad. How can I be Spider-Man if-”
Steve huffs when he struggles to fasten his belt. His brows pinch together in concentration, a quiet curse slipping past his lips when he continues to have issues.
They’re about ten minutes apart, and have been for the past few hours. His water hasn’t broken yet but by the way things were progressing, he wouldn’t be surprised if it were to break any minute.
Steve nods. The little boxes weren't what was bothering him. The larger one was the most intimidating. He knew it held a crib inside; a crib he needed to put together. It was a lot to take in.
His body goes lax and his eyes fall shut. He can’t remember the last time he’s felt this at ease. It’s not long until he’s dozing off.
When Peter pushes the door to his bedroom open, he lets out a sad sigh and runs his fingers through his messy hair. He blows out a breath and steps further into the room, the space now unfamiliar and foreign to him.
The apartment is quiet when Tony returns. If he didn’t ask FRIDAY beforehand if Steve was still home he would have assumed Steve had left again. He honestly wouldn't blame him if he did. They’ve gotten into a lot of nasty fights in the past but this one was taking the number one slot.
He quietly enters his uncles’ apartment, expecting the yelling and interrogating to start, but when he steps inside and hears laughter, he grows both confused and relieved.
“Good.” Steve kisses him again then he crosses the room to serve his own breakfast. That tune he was humming starts up again.
Clint is flying the jet and Natasha is up front with him, chatting about their past assignments and laughing from the memories. Sam and Bucky for once appear to be getting along. They’re bickering about each other’s uniforms, but from where Steve’s standing, it comes off as playful bantering. He can’t help but smile.
“I think you’re afraid of turning into your father,” Steve says softly and he rubs a hand over Tony’s back. “But you’re not going to be him, Tony.”
Steve’s death was still fresh. Sam needed more time to fully process the loss and figure out how to take care of the people Steve left behind. He was doing his best to keep Bucky from losing control and Peter from crumbling. It was a difficult task. More difficult than anything he’s ever had to do before.
“Don’t go,” Peter whispers.
“Come in.” He grants the person access, not surprised to find his papa the one behind the door. “Don’t,” Peter warns when he catches the smirk on his papa’s face.
“I can’t skip. These meetings help.”
“Maybe not,” Tony says. Their eyes meet and for a moment a single thought crosses their mind: would they talk now?
“Tony? Tony, please?” Steve starts begging when he realizes Tony was leaving with their daughter.
“Are you okay?” Tony asks, gently running a hand on the inside of Steve’s thigh. The omega lifts his head, nodding in response to the question. “Let me know if we need to stop.”
“I don’t think I’ve ever seen him cringe so hard,” Bucky says.
Flash’s eyes dart down to Peter’s stomach, and suddenly he has the urge to touch it. He holds off on that urge, deciding it wouldn’t be the appropriate time. He was smart to wait because the door opens and he jumps, expecting scary Tony Stark.
“Hi.” Steve’s smile grows brighter. “How are you feeling?”
“You won’t.” Steve assures.
Not much has changed since the last time Tony’s set foot through the cemetery gates. The trees are a little greener with spring now in motion, and grass is beginning to sprout. There’s a couple of new graves, the soil still fresh. It’s just another reminder that death was always going to be there.
Tony nods and tears prick his eyes. He takes a deep breath, hating how shaky it sounds. He’s supposed to be the strong alpha, the leader of the pack. His pack needed him now more than ever.
“You cheated.”
Instead Happy sighs sadly and reaches out to stop Peter before they get to the door of Tony’s penthouse.
“Mama,” Peter pats the spot beside him.
Ned nods. He’s still frowning but luckily doesn’t say anything else. They part ways and Peter immediately heads to the nearest bathroom. He makes sure it’s clear before locking himself in the last stall and vomiting the bit of toast he consumed that morning.
They’re in the communal living room, curled up together while Steve reads every name off the page that started with the letter B. Tony of course continues to shoot down all of them. He yanks the book from Steve’s hand to find something better than the one’s Steve was reading.
“I’m so proud of you.” Tony places a kiss to the top of Steve’s head. “That must’ve been scary as hell.”
Steve awakes to muffled voices. It takes a moment for his brain to decipher the voices, then he recognizes Natasha’s. She’s speaking with someone else; he listens closely and realizes it’s Tony. Steve’s eyes flutter and a small groan escapes him, the sound disrupting the conversation in the room.
Something was missing.
It was going to take a lot more than just those words to make his son believe him, but Steve would do anything to gain his trust. He’d repeat those words a thousand times a day if he had to.
“Kid, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean-”
Tony forces his own smile and gestures for them to sit in the nearby chairs beside the reception desk. It’s not the ideal place for a meeting, but Tony wasn’t about to take Alexander up to his private office. There was something about him he didn’t quite like.
Peter’s eyes squeeze shut when his belly tightens. He breathes deeply through his nose and rubs the lower part of his belly. If anyone were to notice they might just think he had an upset stomach. Maybe he could get out of school and hide in his room until he knew what the hell he was supposed to do.
Bruce aids in the delivery of the afterbirth, then once Steve is cleaned up, he takes Peter to be cleaned and looked over by Jarvis. Steve is hesitant to let his son go.
“Usually no. They don’t have a pattern like true labor, but if that changes or there’s any spotting don’t hesitate to take him in.”
“So? That’s usually how it goes.”
Then he finds another name he likes. “Peter,” he says and he glances up to meet Tony’s eyes. “Peter’s cute, right?”
Sooner or later Tony was going to need to go back to his own apartment. Steve had honestly hoped for later, but he doesn’t make any attempts to stop him from leaving. He needed to figure out how to be alone with his son. Peter was going to be living with him full time and Steve didn’t want to rely on Tony for everything. He needed to prove he could take care of their son by himself.
Steve’s lips are on Tony’s the moment they’re behind closed doors. Tony allows it, welcomes it with open arms and leads Steve down the hall and toward his bedroom. If Steve’s a little rusty, he does a damn good job at not showing it. He kisses Tony with ease, lips moving effortlessly and hands running down Tony’s body.
“It’s okay. You are now,” Steve says. “Do you want to hold him?”
The room reminds Tony of a room you’d find at a luxury hotel. It’s walls are painted white and the floors are light colored hardwood. The queen size bed is neatly made with fresh white sheets and a matching duvet. There’s a small bathroom adjacent to the bed. A flat screen TV is mounted on the wall and a light gray sofa and matching armchair sit around it, resembling a small living room. On the opposite side of the room are white double doors that lead out into a small patio, perfect for when Steve wanted to enjoy a quiet night.
“Four pups,” Steve says sheepishly. He looks around at the others, wondering if they have any of their own or if they have as many as he does. Maybe they do. And maybe...some of their pups were conceived the same way.
“Sorry.” Steve winces.
The omega reaches for the band of his pants and lowers them down to his ankles, spreading his legs as wide as he can. The next contraction hits, punching a pained gasp from Steve’s lips. He slips a hand between his legs, feeling around his opening and brushing against wet hair. His pup was right there.
Steve hesitates. He’s not sure if he can. He reminds himself that he’s opened up to Tony before, but his nightmares hadn’t had the chance to come up. There was more that he wasn’t telling the alpha. He honestly wasn’t sure how Tony would feel about him if he knew the truth.
“I’m pregnant not- Lordy I never thought I’d ever mutter those two words.”
Here is the smut! I just couldn't wait lol I hope you all enjoy it!
“No! I mean, we’re fine without him, sir. He chose to leave. He won’t come back.”
“Yeah.” Tony sighs. “We’ll work on it.”
Steve whines softly and hugs Sarah close, not wanting to leave her alone. She was too little. “Tony, please?”
Morgan seems pleased with those words. She was finally going to get to spend some time with her dad before Peter stole it all.
“This is your fault too,” Tony continues. His eyes fill with tears again. “You should’ve told me the truth. I’m sorry I didn’t respond but you could’ve done more! Why didn’t you! Why didn’t you just tell me!”
Overtime, it becomes easier to accept the breakup. Steve focuses on the team. As their leader, his time is mostly spent leading their missions and making sure everyone comes back from those missions safely. Tony rarely joined them anymore, but that was to be expected when SI was taking up most of his time.
“You were right. I should’ve told him the truth. I should’ve done something.” Tony throws the bottle and it shatters, making Pepper flinch. “And you know what? He loved me. He loved me back and I...and I fucked up. I thought if I walked away from him I could spare myself and him but…I made a mistake. I should’ve told him the truth.”
“Oh,” Steve can already feel his face heating up, “thank you. Just trying to do what’s right.”
“Okay.” Peter nods.
“Steve, you okay?” Tony asks when he notices the tear rolling down his husband’s face. Steve nods and turns away quickly, using the sleeve of his shirt to wipe the tears.
“Hey.” Sam sets down the knife in his hand and crosses the room to get to his husband, taking him into his arms. “That’s not going to happen.”
“He’s healthy,” Bruce says and gently gives the pup back to his mother. “He’s a little hungry though. If you need help nursing-”
wedding. I just didn’t know they were so expensive…”
Tony internally screams at himself. He sucked at comforting others. He never knew how to say the right things.
“Y-yeah.” Steve nods and Happy helps him down the stairs. Steve stops once they reach the last step. “My phone!” He remembers. “It’s-it’s on the kitchen counter.”
It’s a lie.
“Of course, sir.”
“Great now he wants to do our job,” Bucky complains.
“No problem.” Sam nods.
“Obviously, J.”
“It’s pretty,” James smiles. “Mommy will like it.”
The room fills with the wet, slurping sounds of Tony’s tongue lapping up the slick leaking from Steve’s hole. The omega keens, his toes curling from the intense pleasure that courses through him.
“No.”
“Yeah,” Tony shoots Steve a small smile, then he leaves the room. He makes sure to slip the sweatshirt on before going downstairs, inhaling the familiar scent of the omega. It makes his alpha side happy. “Huh. Maybe this would be better on Steve,” he says to himself.
And now they had to tell their son the truth. Tony didn’t know how they were going to do it.
Just the mention of his name has Tony struggling for air, and he loosens the tie around his neck, ruining Pepper’s effort to make him look nice.
“Sorry,” Peter apologizes. “I just needed a minute.”
Tony pulls away to remove his shirt, then he joins Steve and their lips meet again. Steve breaks the kiss after a moment to trail his hands along Tony’s exposed chest. He runs his hands down Tony’s chest and stomach, and then around to his back. That’s where he finds the scar left over from the bullet wound.
“I needed you both. And now I have no one. I left my family thinking you’d be enough and honestly, I don’t think you are.”
“Peter Benjamin,” Steve tests out the name, smiling at the sound of it. Tony must like it too because he smiles just as brightly.
Tony frowns. “Fine. But if you’re feeling worse-”
“We better go,” Tony says. “Reservations are at five.”
Tony turns himself around until they’re facing each other. The small space between them gets smaller, both leaning in until their lips are almost touching. Tony pulls back at the last minute and steps away.
“I’m sorry,” he says softly. “I just wanted to meet him.”
“Honey, let me try,” Tony suggests and much to his surprise, Steve passes her to him. Usually, Steve argued, deciding that he could do it and eventually he would, but right now he didn’t even want to try. Tony brushes it off, shifting his focus to his crying daughter. “What’s with all the fuss, Little Miss?”
“How?”
“Don’t. Don’t blame yourself.”
A familiar figure joins him. He’d be lying if he said he wasn’t disappointed when he realized it had been Pepper.
Sam smiles. “Come in,” he says and steps aside for his friends to enter.
“Uh oh. Mood swings are kicking in.”
“I know.” Steve smiles. “Now kiss me again.”
“Okay. Have a good day. I love you.”
“J, where is he?” Is the first thing Tony asks when he enters his penthouse and finds it quiet. It’s too quiet for his liking. There’s a moment where he ponders the idea of Steve running off and taking something valuable with him. But then his A.I. is answering and Tony feels like an asshole.
Cold, blue eyes are settling on him now and Tony stares back, holding his ground and refusing to let this other alpha dominate him. He doesn’t even flinch when he’s released from the chains and yanked to his feet.
“Tony. Just call me Tony.”
“I know you would. This is what you want.”
She can still hear the sound of the building falling apart, but it’s the heavy breathing in her ear that motivates her to move faster.
Steve sighs in defeat. They don’t make it very far. He’s crying out and doubling over, both arms wrapping around his middle. The doctor and her staff gather around him. Questions are being thrown at him, but he can’t find his voice to answer any of them. The pain is too much.
“How many?” Bruce asks.
“So where do you go to school?” Tony asks and takes another sip from his glass.
“You do it though.”
Tony returns with Harley and joins his family back on the sofa. Harley plops down on lap, accidentally spilling some of his milk. He gasps and stares wide eyed at the mess, blue eyes glistening with tears.
Steve hangs up and with a frustrated cry throws his phone, watching it bounce a few times on the bed. He plops down on the edge of the bed, leaning forward and burying his face in his hands, no longer able to keep himself together.
“Jesus. The point of a one night stand is so we never bring it up again.”
“Hi,” Steve coos softly. Their eyes meet for the first time and Steve’s heart flutters with love and joy for the little boy in his arms. “You’re here. You’re finally here.”
“Hmm.” Steve frowns and pulls back slightly. “And if that doesn’t work. Hot chocolate definitely will.”
“I’m glad. I just want you to be okay.”
“The baby’s growing!” He exclaims and points excitedly at Peter’s belly.
Tony steals a glance in the direction of the baby swing that’s been set up beside the sofa. Peter’s eyes are fluttering, the little boy struggling to fight sleep. The soothing sway of the swing would work on him soon enough. And if that didn’t work then...Tony would be screwed.
He’d have to spend the next few days in his lab until his rut passed. The beginning wasn’t the worst part, but what was to follow was an entirely different story. Once he started he wouldn't be able to stop.
But JARVIS has other ideas.
Steve’s ears perk at those worse. She knew who Tony was.
“Steve?” It’s Tony. His hand is rubbing along Steve’s shoulder, trying to stimulate him awake. “Hey, it’s okay.”
Steve nods. “Till the end of the line.”
“You didn’t miss anything. Well, actually you did. I called you ten times!” she exclaims.
Steve closes the book and places it on the bedside table, then he reaches for his tea, only to stop when a knock on his door interrupts. He figures it’s one of his friends and with a huff, he climbs out of bed.
“It’s a lot...I know,” Steve says when he catches Pepper’s surprised expression.
Bucky sighs. “You know he’s going to ditch Nat and go see him.”
“You are,” she says then sighs. “let me know when you’re ready and I can take you.”
If he had the chance to turn back the clock he would. He would go back and do things differently. He should’ve told Steve how he really felt. Maybe things would’ve taken a different turn if he had.
Tony smiles and wraps Steve into his arms. “I love you,” he says and ducks down to place a kiss on Steve's head.
“Tony.” Pepper’s voice takes on a warning tone.
“He does?” Steve asks.
Bucky is still lying beside him, holding him tight and encouraging him with comforting words. The pain is getting worse with every passing minute, forcing Steve to cling to his best friend and muffle his cries against Bucky’s chest.
“Steve,” Tony says softly and the omega glances up, giving Tony a glimpse of how unsure he is. Tony sighs and comes closer, dropping down on one knee and taking Steve’s hands into his own. “Honey, we don’t have to do this.”
Peter frowns and slants in his seat. “Maybe I shouldn’t bother. It’s not like Flash cares what I do. I could always just...get rid of it.”
“They will.”
Ned’s talking about...something. Peter’s tuned him out. He can’t decide if he should bother another attempt at SI or visit his papa instead. He’s leaning more toward the latter. He needs to vent to someone. And that someone had always been his papa.
“Sorry,” Steve apologizes and tenderly runs his thumb over the knuckles of Tony’s right hand. “But you’re not him. You never will be. You’re going to be a wonderful father.”
“I know. I swear I’ve been meaning to take you out, but with Peter and work…” Tony trails off with a sigh.
Sarah frowns at him and Harley whimpers. Steve soothes them again.
“I know!” Peter cries and jumps off his step stool and runs out of the bathroom.
“Okay, okay.” Sam wraps an arm around Bucky’s shoulder and brings him in close, pressing a kiss to his head. “But it would be cool, right?”
Sam grins. “Let me guess. Harley?”
She’s hesitant to approach him, but when he looks up at her with pain filled eyes, she sighs sadly and moves toward him, carefully avoiding the glass as she sits beside him.
“Your team better be ready, Cap.” Nick warns before he leaves with Maria.
Tony pauses his work when he realizes the space around him has gone silent. He peers up from the gauntlet he’s been tweaking on.
Steve eyes the mug warily. “I don’t think I can.”
There was only a small handful of people he trusted. Okay maybe only three, but to him that was enough. Pepper was part of that trio; he trusted her with his life. So it made sense that he would trust her with this.
Steve huffs out a small laugh and runs a hand through his damp hair. “This is about you, remember?”
Steve whimpers, raising one hand to touch, only to drop it back down to his side.
“One glass won’t hurt,” Tony says as he pours himself and Steve a glass. “You need something to take off the edge anyway.”
As usual, Rumlow and Rollins escort him to their leader’s room. He is shoved a little too harshly inside, something that goes unnoticed by Alpha. Their leader is on the opposite side of the room, pouring himself a drink at the bar. He peers up when he senses their presence, a smile forming over his face.
Alexander is standing in the lobby with his henchman. They look different from the first time Tony met them. He can’t even begin to imagine what kind of hell they’ve been through. They almost looked just as bad as Steve with their bruised and busted faces.
“Yep.” Tony nods and places it in their cart. “At least this way you can pump and then I can bottle feed him.”
“Ah.” Steve nods. “She’s good though, right? I’m sorry you have to do it all.”
“Mama?” James asks shyly, “are you okay?”
And @Publisher021 I hope you especially loved this gift 😊
“Sorry. I thought you’re supposed to be this skilled assassin?”
“I just want things to go back to normal.”
“I love you,” Tony says and kisses the top of Steve’s head.
“I think we all are. Let me put him down and then we can get some sleep.”
“He’s fine,” Steve assures, though he doesn’t entirely believe his own words. He gets up from his seat. “Let’s get started.”
“Hello?” Peter answers, his brows furrowed in confusion. He can’t think of a reason for Happy to be calling him. At first he assumes he’s left something behind in the car, then his mind comes up with another reason. What if Happy knew?
Steve shakes his head. “This is worse. I’d rather get punched in the face.”
They settle in their new home when Peter is around five. The large, secluded property is the perfect place to raise a family. With a lake and vast landscape, it was easy for Peter and Dodger to spend hours playing.
When Flash tries to leave, Peter yanks him back.
Steve rolls his eyes. “We’re...we’re not there yet.”
“J, play it again,” Tony orders the A.I. All morning as he slaves away in his lab, he’s had Jarvis play a new playlist. For once it’s not some classic rock song.
“I’m sorry,” Pepper whispers. She’s crying again. “I tried to tell you sooner but-”
“Yep!” Tony grins and leans back in his seat. “I’m still working on it but I think I have a basic design so far.”
Much to Tony’s disappointment and Steve’s relief, Peter doesn’t wake. Tony keeps his head on Steve’s belly anyway, softly speaking to his son.
“Yeah? What’s the plan?”
“I can’t...Tony, I can’t. It hurts.”
“Thanks.”
“Yeah. You were a lucky kid. Still are. You have Earth’s Mightiest Heroes looking out for you.”
“I just want to go to bed. Sorry, I’m just tired.”
Happy is still in his original place. The annoyed expression on his face has vanished, leaving in its place the stern one he likes to use to make himself look tougher. It was one he used frequently around alphas to show that he was just as, and if not more, tough as they were.
“I’ll be fine.”
It was a beautiful sight to witness Steve so happy when he was with Morgan. She had managed to awaken something inside him, something that Steve claimed died out years ago. That simple life he wanted was starting to become a reality.
“No. No!” Steve fights. He could easily overpower the two alphas if he really wanted to. He was stronger than they were. But he knows what will happen if he were to go up against them. A hard jab to the ribs has him gasping and falling still.
Thank you so much for reading!
“That makes one of us.”
“Ridiculous!”
Peter frowns and cranes his neck to get a better look. “That?” he asks, pointing at the screen. Bruce nods. “But it’s so...tiny.”
“You okay?” Tony pauses, waiting for Steve to adjust. Steve nods his head and Tony presses more of himself inside until he’s buried deep. They both moan.
The laughter stops.
The tears are flowing down Tony’s face, and this time he doesn’t bother wiping them away. He has to fight the urge to crash his fist through the screen. He screams in frustration and throws the mug instead.
“No. I like it.” Steve smiles. “Peter. Yeah, I like it.”
“I’m not going to turn green if that’s what you're afraid of. To be honest I’m happy to see you.”
It only gets worse. After the funeral, Steve loses interest in everything. He hangs up the shield, burying it deep into the closet and vowing to never touch it again. He gives up on life. There was no point anymore.
“Did you seduce me? Did we meet at that party and you lured me away?”
“Oh. Yeah okay. So same time or...maybe you can pick me up?”
“You can bite me,” Tony tells him. “But rest first. We have time.”
“You wanna try again?” Sam pulls away to ask. Bucky nods quickly and kisses Sam again.
Steve snaps his head up, eyes locking with cold, blue ones. Alexander has the gun, a satisfied smirk on his lips. Rumlow is beside him, ready to comply with any order he’s given.
But Steve was stubborn and insisted he take on more of the work. It was easy for him to argue against the idea, especially when he had done a good chunk of the work carrying Morgan for nine months and giving birth. Tony was all for sharing the responsibility, but there were times when he was content with taking Morgan for a little while to give Steve a break.
