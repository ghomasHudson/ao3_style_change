I've said it before--my research skills are not good. Thanks to Google for what I got right, blame me for what I got wrong. Next chapter up in a week...or so.
Steve looked at him from across the room. He had taken his suit jacket off and tossed it on the foot of the bed. The tie--Sam’s old blue silk one that he had never given back--had gone next. Now he was unbuttoning the cuffs of his dress shirt with jerky movements. He was upset. Tony could see that, but Tony just couldn’t seem to stop his mouth from running. From complaining.
“I know,” Steve said. “I don’t even really need to talk to him personally. I thought...I thought I could just leave him a message or something. Can you-”
Steve swallowed and wet his lips with his tongue.  Tony sighed harshly at the sight, wishing it was on him, inside him.  “I want you, Tony, I really do, it’s just that I can’t--” he gestured at his legs helplessly.  “--I can’t have any weight.  On me.  I can’t--”
“Well, what is it, then? You and Tony,” she shook her head, “it’s kind of perfect. You guys could be so happy together.”
“Fuck,” he muttered, and kicked his foot. The water splashed, then rippled. He wondered if there was a metaphor there. Probably. He hated metaphors.
He moved closer and carefully lifted Steve’s head so it could rest in his lap.  Steve groaned then was still.
“If you kill him now, he can’t do that.  And Ross will get away with it,” she said.  “I know you don’t want that.  Thor made sure Loki suffered for what he did to you.”  Clint tensed again, but her worry was draining away.  She knew he’d seen reason.  She just needed this last bit for insurance.  “Now, it’s
Steve stood off to the side, not at the bar, but close enough. He always felt uncomfortable at these things. The lights were always a little too bright, the talk a little too loud. Funny that he, who had been an almost-literal showgirl in his other life, should feel out of place amongst such glitz and glamor, but he did.
“Steve,” he heard Natasha say, and then she was gone.  She moved slowly until Steve raised his hand to her, his lips curving into a bashful smile, then she went faster.
Tony let out a breath almost like laughter, and pressed his forehead against Steve’s chest. “God, Steve,” he muttered. “You and me. How the fuck did we ever get together in the first place? Huh?”
Tony suggested flying them all to the Cayman Islands for a week, but Steve thought it would be better to stay close to home just in case, so that’s what they did. Clint raised an eyebrow in Tony’s direction when he conceded to Steve immediately, but Tony made it a point to not look his way. This was
Tony leaned forward and touched his face.  It was impossibly smooth, impossibly soft.  “There’s my man,” he murmured.  “I missed that face.”
Steve sat slumped in his seat, idly rifling through the papers in front of him.  He wasn’t listening.  He was tired of the talk.  He just wanted to get it over with.  He’d packed his bags the night of his fight with Tony in the kitchen.  They sat by the door, patiently waiting like pet dogs.  When this was over, he’d grab them and be gone before anyone even noticed.  He wouldn’t say good-bye.  There had been only one person he would have sought out and she was gone already.  He could say good-bye to FRIDAY on the way out of the building.  She wouldn’t answer him, he’d failed his second chance, but he could still say it and hope she heard.
“That’s not true,” Tony said.  He moved his hands up to Steve’s hair, massaging and scratching his scalp.  Steve was melting, the tension running out of him like water.  That was the plan.  He was tense.  He’d been tense for days.  Too fucking tense for Tony’s taste.  Ever since Ross’ letter had come, he’d been wound way too tight.  Tony had been trying to get him to relax.  He’d been doing everything he could think of.  He’d even made him tea.  He’d even...
Steve washed his hands at a rest stop on his way back to the hospital.  He was careful about getting the blood under his nails and in between his fingers.  Careful about scrubbing it away from the creases in his palms.
“Tony was always good to me,” he went on. “Always treated me like I meant something.” He finished his drink and licked the last of it from his lips, watching Tony watch him. “Even when I didn’t deserve it.”
Tony couldn’t help the relief that came over him. He’d known. It was more than obvious, but it was good to have the reassurance. “Yeah,” he agreed. “He
He was still holding Steve’s shirt, and he yanked at it, trying to get rid of it, get it out of the way. “Off,” he muttered, and Steve pulled away just far enough to tear it off and throw it away before descending on him again, shoving his tongue back into his mouth, licking deeply, Tony’s meeting him stroke for stroke.
Bucky slid a little closer. “Wanna pretend we’re a thing?” he asked, in a low, sultry tone that made Steve roll his eyes. “Come on, Stevie,” he said, and turned in his seat so he lay back against Steve’s broad chest and rubbed up against him. “Let’s put on a show of our own."
Tony held him for a while, then pulled away a little.  “Don’t get me wrong, baby, I’m loving this right now, but did you really ask me to stay just to cuddle?”
“Tony said it was his fault,” Sarah said after Steve stopped talking long enough to sip his tea. “He said you did because of him. And his father.”
“Yeah,” he said.  “Next time.  As in the time after this time.  ‘Cause there will be one, right?  ‘Cause neither of us is dying, right?”  Steve looked down and Tony repeated, “Right?” and gave him a brisk shake.
Tony kissed him again.  Soft, short, sweet, then pulled away.  He held up the letter.  “So?  What does he want?”
The hope broke free and swirled through his body, making him feel young again, but he matched Steve’s tone and body language, trying very hard to keep it serious for now, keep it formal.  “Okay.”
Tony smiled indulgently, and ran his fingers through Steve’s hair. “I’m gonna move, ‘kay?” he said. Steve held his hand tighter, uttering a quiet hum of dissent.
, no,” Bucky snapped. “Don’t do that. Don’t you even dare talk like that. You don’t make a decision like this based on what somebody else wants.”
. Trying to be discreet, they hadn’t really gotten too much of that since they’d become an item. An occasional, illicit peck like Steve gave him when he came in today. A short, tight squeeze when they found themselves alone in the school hallway. Twice, when Steve let Tony drive him home instead of riding the bus, they’d had a quick, fumbling make-out session in an empty parking lot. They didn’t have the chance to get too heated, though. Steve was always too conscious of the time, and Tony always too conscious of the surroundings to get too into it. The two times it had happened, Tony went home and directly to his room afterward. Lying on his bed, he thought of Steve’s hands running along his arms and resting on his thighs while he put his own hands to use in a way that Steve had never done, but Tony thought about probably much more often than was healthy.
“Will you stay with me?” he’d asked, and he’d meant stay with him while he died.  Because he didn’t want to be alone.  Alone like he’d been in the ice.  Alone, cold, afraid, dying with no one around.  Dying with no one to hold his hand, or stroke his hair, or tell him it would be okay.
“I swear to Christ, Steve, if the next words out of your mouth aren’t ‘Anything you want, Tony’, somebody in this room
Tony moved next to him, but didn’t touch, just let his eyes move over him, drinking him in.  He had seen him shirtless before, but never without blood or bruises or bandages covering him.  Never lit only from the moon shining through the window and the ethereal blue glow of his own reactor.  Never so close that he could touch--or taste--him.
Steve put his head in his hands again. “Me too,” he said faintly, then lifted his head up enough to look at those hands. Pale. Large. Strong. But they couldn’t hold onto anything. Not anything real. “But it doesn’t matter anyway. ‘Cause I won’t even be here to go to the movies, will I? I’ll be over there. Doing-” he laughed that brittle, broken laugh again, and Tony shuddered because he’d heard it before. From his father. “-Doing whatever it is I’ll be doing over there. Fighting. Or trying to stop people from fighting. Or whatever, I guess. Whatever they tell me to do.”
--they hadn’t been able to spend even an hour together. And wasn’t that the entire point of living together? That they got to be together more? Or at all? Because they hadn’t.
“‘Cause she and I...kind of a package deal.” Tony squeezed Steve tight--very tight--then let him go. Except for his hand. He kept holding his hand. He looked down at it, plucked a little at the skin there. “I guess that’s why I was worried you wouldn’t call me,” he said softly. “We never talked about that. If that was okay with you.”
Steve laughed, and Tony got his chair so he could slide into it.  Nat kissed him on the cheek, and Bruce said, “Good night.”
“Yeah,” Tony said.  “After everything.  Besides, it’s better than the convalescent home Strange picked out.”
Tony felt a mixed-bag of emotions for those that he saw, especially the loners.  Sadness because they were alone, but also a breed of jealousy because at least they
"You love me anyway, though, don't you?" Tony said, laying his head against Steve's chest, curling into his best guy, knowing he was in the arms of the one person who would always protect him, always take care of him, always do whatever needed to be done to make sure he was safe, come what may.
For some reason, Steve felt a blush beginning to heat up his cheeks. Tony’s young, eleven-year-old voice in his ears:
“How’d you know about this place?” Tony whispered. Everyone in the tunnel spoke very quietly, if they spoke at all, almost as if they were in a church.
?” He laughed, and Steve smiled at how happy he sounded. “Anyway, I’ll see you Thursday, okay? I lo...um. Is this Mrs. Rogers listening to this, or Steve? If it’s Mrs. Rogers, hi! If it’s Steve, we should probably come up with a code word for ‘I love you’. Maybe if I say ‘buffalo’ or ‘mitosis’ or something then you’ll know what I mean so we don’t embarrass your mom.” Steve smiled again. “So, anyway, buffalo. See you Thursday.”
He reached down and pet the cat as he passed.  Sir Purr yawned and stretched.  Tony was utterly charmed.  He always was, by everything the cat did.  “Have you seen daddy?” he asked.  “Did he come through here?”
“Steve?” Sarah asked, her voice dark with concern. She put her hand on his back. “Do you want me to take it down?”
Howard clasped his shoulder. “I think you’ll change your mind, Steven,” he said. “I do.” And then he left.
No. No, it wasn’t. It couldn’t be. That flash of red could have been anybody’s car. It was a popular color for sports cars. Tony was in California. Not here.
Tony climbed up into his lap and put his arms around his neck, hugging him. “In a minute, baby,” he said, smoothing his hair behind his ear. “Just let me hold you, okay? I need it.” He kissed Steve’s temple, squeezed him tight, and Steve wrapped him in his arms and crushed him against his chest.
Steve gave him a quizzical look, like he couldn’t quite believe what Tony was asking. “Mine,” he said, then swam away again.
Tony bent his head and kissed the back of Steve’s neck.  “Good.  ‘Cause we missed you.  We all missed you.”  He ran his hands up and down Steve’s back, rubbing the long, lean expanse, feeling the muscles beneath his shirt.  He wished, briefly, fiercely, that there was no fabric between his hands and Steve’s smooth skin.  They’d spent a lot of time relearning the terrain of each other’s bodies, but that was a lesson Tony never got tired of.  “
Tony dreaded the answer.  Because he already knew what it was.  He’d seen those rooms before.  Seen those cots set into the wall.  There were no bars, just clear panels of vibranium-reinforced glass that was completely and utterly shatterproof.  That had been Ross’ doing.  After the Steve Rogers-led mass break-out and subsequent global man-hunt for a small band of rogues, Ross had replaced and reinforced all the security.  If it had been formidable before Steve, after him, The Raft prison had become an impenetrable fortress that no one dared to try and breach.
“Me neither. It seems like last week you and me were sitting in Dr. Banner’s science class. Going out to that clearing behind the school.” His smile warmed a few degrees. “Remember that?”
Bucky stared at him, his face set, eyes hard and questioning. They were sitting in his apartment. Natasha was at work, and Bucky and Steve were here,
, was the first thought that came to his mind, but he didn’t want to say that. He didn’t want to talk about--or think about--Howard right now. Not during such a sweet moment. “I used to climb into bed with Rhodey sometimes,” he said instead. “If I had a shitty night, or one of the professors yelled at me for something. I’d stew about it for hours,
Steve sighed again and knocked his head back against the door a couple of times. “What do you want me to say? Mom was happy.” He nodded past Tony at the photograph on the wall. “Your little girl? She looks happy. That means
Steve let out a breath and smiled. It was small and tired, but Tony wouldn’t trade it for anything in the entire world. Steve nodded.
“But. You didn’t know I was going to stay here last night,” he said, but Tony just shrugged, popping another bite into his mouth.
Steve shook his head.  “Nothing, I guess,” he said.  “I just didn’t think we’d ever get here.  It just almost doesn’t seem real.  Like I’m still back at the...Like I’m just dreaming.”
Once he heard the rattle of the shower curtain and the tinny thunder of water, he slid off the counter.  He didn’t feel slighted by Steve’s attempts to keep him at bay over the last hour.  It was temporary, and every particle of his being knew it.  Steve wanted him.  His wanting had been coming off him in warm, relentless waves, like the ocean on a quiet Mexican beach.  He wanted him, and he’d have him tonight, maybe tomorrow, surely by the day after that.  Tony would wait.  He
Tony sighed, resting his head in his hand.  He knew how much he was asking of her.  He didn’t want to hurt her, but he couldn’t stop being with Steve.  Not even for her.  Pepper was his past.  Steve was his future.  He still believed that.  Even if Steve wouldn’t answer his letters, wouldn’t see him, wouldn’t speak to him, he still believed it.  Would always believe it until he drew his last breath.
Steve read them, making sure he was alone when he did. He cried when he read them. He always did. It didn’t matter that they were fun letters with Tony’s personality stamped all over them, he still cried. So, he made sure he was alone when he read them. Made sure he tucked them away when he was done, hiding them along with the letters from his mother and Sam, and the Christmas and birthday cards from Mrs. Perkins, deep inside his footlocker, stuffed under a bunch of shit. It seemed ironic--hiding the most precious things in the world to him under things he couldn’t give a fuck about--but he wanted to keep them. He couldn’t stand the thought of throwing them away. It would be like cutting off a piece of his body and tossing it out with the trash.
“I know.” He released him, but looked him seriously in the eye. “But when you are--and I really hope someday soon you are--I’m going to give you Pietro’s number. He really is a nice guy.”
Steve swam toward him. He propped himself on his elbows against the concrete ledge and just looked up at Tony. His eyes were big. Blue. Innocent. He wasn’t smiling, but he wasn’t frowning either. Neutral. Tony ached to reach out and touch him, run his hand through his wet hair, feel the smoothness of it between his fingers. Wanted to touch his cheek. His jaw. His lips.
Steve shrugged his broad shoulders, then propped his chin on his hand. He was sitting closer than they usually sat, with only the corner of the table between them. He reached out and touched Tony’s hand, brushing his fingers along his wrist in absent little strokes. “Nothing much,” he said.
Okay, here we go for real.  This one is a little short.  Short and pretty sweet. I am going to try and post every 2-3 days. The timeline may feel a little vague.  That's (mostly) intentional. I kind of wanted it to feel like time is ephemeral.  Because it is.
“I never said I wouldn’t live my life, baby,” Tony answered. “I never said I didn’t want you to live yours. But I want us to be together someday. I want you to promise me we’re going to be together someday.”
Steve had always taken it to heart rather than taking offense, but Tony had no such compunctions, and was highly offended on Steve’s behalf. But this one, however, was nothing like that. It couldn’t be called pristine, what with it’s eraser marks and a jagged tear on one corner, but it certainly was much prettier than any other Tony had seen. There were only red checks beside two questions, and they seemed much smaller than the previous ones. At the top, was a circled 94, and a note saying,
They were due at Jen's by 11:00, but when Steve didn't come back by 10:45, Tony gave up and left.  Steve was already there when Tony pulled up. They gave each other a terse "Hey" when Tony got out of the car, and that was all.
He pulled away from Tony’s touch, his eyes glazing over.  “No,” he said.  “Sam and Wanda took me for my birthday one year.  I was--” his thumb crept to his mouth and he chewed the nail for a second before continuing. “--having a rough time.  Nat wasn’t there, and they wanted to do something nice.”
“No.”  Steve’s eyes were soft, but his voice was as hard as stone, immovable.  “No, I want to stay here.  The sun feels nice.  And the breeze.  And it’s home, you know?  We used to come here and feed the ducks, remember?”
They’d eaten dinner, chatting and laughing, talking about everything but one thing, then settled in to watch the movie.  Bruce fell asleep thirty minutes in, and Tony and Natasha watched the rest while the snow began to fall outside.
Steve eased his grip but did not let go.  He stepped closer until there was a bare inch between them.  His hand slipped into Tony’s and folded their fingers together.  “I’m not sorry about what just happened,” he whispered, lowering his head until his forehead was pressed against Tony’s.  “I’ve wanted that for so long, but I didn’t know how to tell you, and now I’m scared to death that it’s too late.”
“I don’t want to be in there by myself,” he said.  “This was supposed to be our first night together.  Are you really going to make me spend it alone?”
Steve shifted, his lashes fluttering against the skin of Tony’s neck. It was soft, almost as soft as his breath, and god, those tiny sensations were fast becoming the things Tony lived for. The things he would die for.
“Yeah. He’ll be a soldier, Tony. They’ll send him into dangerous situations.” He paused. “He could get hurt. Or-”
“Lights up to 15%, please, FRI,” he muttered in a sleep-addled voice, and the room brightened.  Not much, but enough that he could find his way to the bathroom and climb into the shower.  The scent of coconut Gina left behind was still clinging to him, surrounding him, wrapping around him like a shroud.  He couldn’t stand it, that fruity, cloying scent.  It was too much.
be.  I don’t deserve you yet, Tony, I know that, but once I’m out of here, I swear to you I’m going to spend every day trying to.  Okay?  If you’ll let me?”
When his movie-watching eye started to droop, he turned it on his friends instead. Clint was in the chair, and Tony was gratified to see that he was almost asleep himself. Nat was curled up on the couch with Bruce beside her. Her head was resting comfortably on his thigh, but in spite of that, and the soft blankets and pillows around them, he looked very stiff. Very formal. Tony frowned. That was weird.
Tony bit the insides of his cheeks to keep from laughing. He didn’t want to laugh. He didn’t want to upset Steve, but it was almost too adorable to bear. “Yes, Steve,” he said in his most contrite tone, eyes dancing with humor.
When he couldn’t get Steve to give in, Tony kissed his way down Steve’s chest, then rested his cheek against it, lying mostly on top of him and said, “Best. Pillow. Ever.”
“No.  I asked Patty.  She said he’d been hanging around the dumpsters the last couple days.”  Tony shrugged.  “I opened the car door and called him, and he jumped inside.  He wanted to come home with me.  Like he was just waiting for me.”
“I want to do all kinds of things to you,” Tony answered.  Then, because his curiosity had been piqued, “Have you ever seen it?  The Mona Lisa?”
Tony cast his thoughts out for anything.  Everything.  “We fought over the toothpaste that time,” he said urgently.  “You told me you don't really like milk but you still drink it for the calcium.  You’ll only sleep on white sheets for some reason I don’t know and you won’t tell me.  You say you don’t like rap, but you know every word to ‘Gangsta’s Paradise’.  I don’t even know where the hell you heard it.  You got pissed when I called us the Matthew and Mary Crawley of the Avengers.  You--ah, Christ, what else?  You love peas, but you hate corn.  You
Sam and Natasha exchanged a look.  One that Tony was entirely left out of, and he didn’t like it one bit.  He imagined an entire conversation happening between those locked eyes.
Steve sighed. He was lonely too. Sure, he had spent the evening with his best friend, and then came home to his mother and his dog, but he was still lonely. That wasn’t anything new--he’d always been lonely--but he’d felt it more keenly over the last couple weeks. Ever since seeing Tony again. When he wasn't with him, he felt the loneliness more. “I’m...tempted,” Steve said, closing his eyes. “I’ve been thinking about you all night.”
“We’d start you out on salary,” he said. “An office. Mr. Wong could get you caught up to speed on any and all projects he thinks you’d fit with.” He gestured a bit, then picked up his coffee cup. “Or, if you would rather remain a free agent, we’d be happy with any consulting or freelance work you’d be interested in doing.”
“Perimeter check,” she answered finally. “Everything’s secure on the floors above and below this one. I’m sure Tony’s got FRIDAY on active duty.” She snagged a glass of champagne from a passing waiter. “I assume you checked things out here,” she continued as the waiter left.
Tony thought, looking at Steve’s face, drinking him in as though he were a tall glass of water after a long, hot day.
Clint was the one who brought it to his attention. Thinking back, Tony wasn’t sure if he was the only person who
“Nowhere,” he said. “I’m just taking Dodger out.” he let his hand slip down to her plump little cheek and brushed it with his fingers. “I’ll be right back, okay?”
Jeff woke up enough to insist he could drive home.  “I feel like I’m sixteen again!” he proclaimed, never moving from the patio chair he was currently laid out on.
“I’m sorry,” he muttered, his head down, voice cracking with a storm of useless emotion.  “Tony, I’m sorry, I--fuck, I can’t, I’m sorry.”
He left half an hour later, and drove home in silence.  It was a cold, lonely ride without Steve there to hold his hand.
Steve leaned back in his seat and looked at the ceiling.  Tony could only see the bottom curve of his eyes, but he could see they were too shiny, too wet.  “Yeah.  He did.  And I took the bait.”  He laughed bitterly.  “I used to be in control.  Remember that, Tony?  Remember how I used to be?”
Steve stood back up. His fingers went to his temples and he rubbed them, thumb on one side, middle finger on the other. His hands were big enough to do that comfortably. They’d always been big. Strong. “When?” he asked, he eyes closed, and Tony picked up the thread of the conversation as if they’d never dropped it in the first place.
Steve’s faux puppy-dog eyes turned real. One of Tony’s teachers had told him about an exhibit on Mayan engineering, and he wanted to go. Steve felt awful turning him down, but he had to work. He had promised his boss he’d work a double-shift that day to cover for one of the checkers who was having a baby. He’d promised to pay him time-and-a-half for the six hours of overtime, and Steve couldn’t turn it down.
He’d gone through the motions.  He’d stayed at the cabin, watched the boats out on the lake, slept in the bed they’d shared, worked on his cars, washed the dishes, went to City Council meetings, spoke at Lions Club meetings.  He even joined a bowling league.  And why not?  His average was 220, and he bought all the beer.  His team was beyond thrilled to have him.
Steve locked his eyes on the target. The man was tall, dark-haired, good-looking in a vague, unremarkable way. He was easy to look at and easy to forget. Very few terrorists looked like terrorists. They looked like your neighbor, the guy who made your coffee or sold you your car. They looked like the guy by the bandstand.
Through the phone, Steve heard Nick clear his throat, and below him, on the street, he saw Tony’s car pull up. Saw him get out and look around.
He got out of the car and stood looking up at the building for a moment while the taxi’s taillights dwindled in the distance. There was a soft light coming from the fourth floor window. His mom was up there. Dodger. Tony was up there too. His people. His family. He missed Morgan terribly, but he had made his peace with that. It would be okay, as long as he got the other three--even though he selfishly wished she was here too.
“We’re all concerned about you, Tony.  We love you.  None of us ever want to see you hurting, you mean too much--why are you smiling like that?”
Steve ran a hand through his own hair. He was nervous and shy, but god, that look in Tony’s eye gave him courage. Just like it always had. Like it had been doing since the day they met all those years ago as two lonely kids looking for that one person who could complete them. “Then we’ll see.”
got worse.  So, enjoy what you have, because it really was like Mom said--if you don’t take care of what you have, you shouldn’t have it.  You don’t deserve to have it.
Bobby must have thought so too.  He couldn't seem to take his eyes off of him for longer than a few seconds at a time.  It wasn't sexual--at least Tony didn't think so--but it was definitely worshipful. Tony thought it was sweet.
His breath was hot in his throat.  That other voice had fallen silent.  The quiet in his head was bliss.  “What if I die first?” he asked, his voice cracking.
It was just a warm kiss, soft and friendly, his fingers reaching up to stroke the beard on Steve’s cheek.  Steve hummed with contentment.
nice,” Steve insisted. “But we’re over. I haven’t seen him or talked to him in three years. He can do whatever he wants.”
He couldn’t all the details when he jolted awake an hour later, just that there had been blood and sand and screams. He woke panting, sweating, arms holding Tony tightly--too tightly. Tony struggled within that tight circle, mumbling something, frowning even as he slept, and Steve released him quickly. Tony stopped struggling and rolled away, turning his back to Steve, and curled up into a ball.
Tony stood behind the rows of folding chairs.  Graduations sure hadn’t changed much over the years, he mused.  School colors.  School song.  Boring speeches.  Endless parade of kids pulling faces at their parents when they received their diploma.  He’d had the same.  Except the pulling faces part.  That would have surely earned him the patented Howard Stark frown.  No point in that, even though, at 17, he was always ripe for a fight with Howard.  But, Maria was happy that day, smiling and proud, and even Howard wasn’t looking too anxious to disrupt her mood, so Tony just smiled and accepted his MIT diploma.  He got shit-faced that night, however, and balled some guy from town in the back-seat of his Nova.  He’d come down with a horrendous case of the clap.  Welcome to the real world, baby.
Steve looked back at him, a little smile on his lips.  “They’re not for you, either,” he said.  “I’ve got a girl.”
“Are you sure?” Steve asked, dropping his head down onto Tony’s shoulder. “I can’t leave if we’re not okay.”
Tony pointed at Steve. “Don’t. Move.” he said sternly, then squatted next to Morgan. “Sorry, peanut,” he said, bopping her nose gently with his finger. “I didn’t mean to scare you.”
Sarah laughed, and Steve rolled his eyes. It was a dramatic, sarcastic eye-roll, but his insides were turning happy circles. He hadn’t wanted to admit just how nervous the thought of their meeting had been making him. Especially after the little argument he’d had with Tony over talking to Howard again. He hadn’t wanted to push anything. Hadn’t wanted to make him uncomfortable. But now, he realized just how silly that was, and he had never been more thrilled to feel that way in his life.
She softened, but kept his hand in hers. She gazed at him, her head on the pillows, her eyes warm and bright with unshed tears. “I’m so lucky to have you,” she whispered.  “You’re the best thing in the world. The best thing I ever did.”
He fixed himself a cup, then took another mug out of the cupboard. He got out a spoon and sat it beside it. There was half and half in the fridge. They’d only had coffee together once, but Tony remembered how Sarah liked it. He had a good memory.
“And he has been interred in a public hospital since then?  Co-mingling with the general population?”
, I was happy to see him.  I’m always happy to see him, but that doesn’t mean you should have called him.”
Which one had comforted him when he had nightmares?  Which one had made his tea with lemon and sugar instead of honey because I-don’t-like-honey-Tony-I’ve-told-you-a-hundred-times?  Which one did he lie on the deck with and watch the stars, listening with a faraway expression while they explained the constellations to him?  Did he take their hand and raise it to his lips like he’d done with Tony?  Did he put his head in their lap while they watched tv?  Did he breathe their name in the cool watches of the night as they made love?
Steve looked at the kid still leaning casually against the door frame, and shook his head. “No, Mr. Stane. Not at all.”
They wandered around, the three of them. Sometimes, Morgan walked between them, holding their hands, sometimes running ahead to stare into the tanks of giant river fish and dwarf caimans. When she did that, Steve and Tony automatically stepped closer together. They didn’t talk much, didn’t really touch, but they spent more time looking at each other than the fish.
“It really wasn’t anything,” Steve answered.  “I heard some guys picking on another guy and I stepped in.”  He shrugged.  “No big deal.”
“I don’t know,” he answered, openly stroking his cheek now.  Tony’s fingers traced from just under Steve’s ear, down his cheek to his chin, then switched to the other side and let them follow the same path.  “Seems like someone promised they’d do something tonight.”
cares. She never talks about my dad much, but she told me the other night how much he used to love her hair. Said he brushed it sometimes.” Steve wiped his eyes with one hand, and laughed under his breath. “I didn’t know what to say. I never know what to say.”
“I guess. They’ve called a lot. The National Guard did too, but the guys from the Army just laughed when I told them that. They said they had a lot more to offer than the
television. It was dusk, and the windows gave a spectacular view of the city below, but the rest of the space seemed sterile. Cold. The very opposite of what Steve himself was.
things--that were scary enough that sometimes I can’t sleep at night when I think about them too much? Knowing that I-I might hurt her?”
She smiled, and it brightened up the room. Tony heard Steve let out a soft breath. It sounded like pure relief, and that put Tony at ease too. “No,” she said, squeezing his hand in a friendly way. “You’re him. I can tell.” She pulled him closer by their clasped hands and kissed first his left cheek, then the right. “Happy birthday.”
At first, with a gentle, “I’m sorry” tone, then, when that didn’t work, a more firm one.  Finally, the last few days, he’d broken into desperate pleading.  The cat was unmoved.  It hated him, so Steve had finally given up and decided to hate it right back.
you’re fifteen minutes late, then you tell me you want to break up, then you ask me ridiculous, self-serving questions, and
There was a knock on the door behind them, and Pepper smoothed her ponytail.  “That’s the deli.  Wait here.  Don’t touch anything.”
“I see a man with absolutely nothing to lose.  A man with no ties.  No boundaries.  No laws.  A man who believes in nothing, because everything he believed in is gone.”  Ross cocked his head, his eyes boring into Tony’s.  “If you don’t think a man like that is dangerous, Stark, then I’m even more afraid of you than I thought.”
you think about, isn’t it?  What changes, do you think?  What changes to make us start thinking about it?”
Tony thought, as he fell into her waiting arms.  It was his last coherent thought, Steve’s arms and his soft mouth, the last tangible things he felt.
He wasn’t an Avenger.  He couldn’t bring himself to go that far.  Without Captain America by his side, Iron Man could never be as good as he needed to be.  Tony could admit that freely.  It had nothing to do with the personal, feelings-y side of it.  It was all about the strength, strategy, effectiveness-y side.  Iron Man just wasn’t as good without Captain America.  Straight talk only here, right?
Tony looked up at Strange again helplessly, but he shook his head.  The sorcerer was staring at the couple on the bed intently, his own breath coming hard and fast.
Here's my issue:  I have always had a bit of a crush on William Hurt.  Ever since I saw "Broadcast News" as a wee slip of a girl and he pulls Holly Hunter's chair toward him and her head falls back and she gasps and...but I digress.  I sometimes feel bad writing bad-guy Ross.  But, then I think, oh, come on, William Hurt's a tough guy.  He can take it.  I hope so!  That wasn't important.  Just a side-note.  Plus, I just like thinking about William Hurt sometimes.
"It was nice of you boys to come help," Jen said.  She and Tony were essentially the same age, and she was technically decades younger than Steve, but she and Jeff were
He opened the door to Tony’s apartment with his key. Dodger met him at the door, and Steve petted him for a while, hugged his shaggy, wiggly body. Dodger always met him. Every day since the day he’d gotten him, he’d met him at the door whenever Steve went out without him. Even here, where Steve knew he was asleep in Morgan’s bed, he still somehow met him at the door. Still knew when he was coming. That felt good.
so much. A staggering amount. A shattering amount. Not only from the sensation of Steve moving inside him, but everything else as well. Everything he had been missing for the last fifteen years. Everything that Steve so encompassed--passion, desire, heartbreaking, devastating life-affirming love. Fifteen years. He had been without this for fifteen years. And it had been fine. But now he knew he could never live without it again. Never again. He would cling to this man with every ounce of strength he had left in him until the moment he died, and if Steve died first, he’d go with him, because he could never be without him again. Ever. He knew it. The knowledge lived inside his bones. Inside his blood. Inside his soul and his spirit.
“The fuck it is,” he said, then looked down at the little blonde.  Her eyes were wide, round with surprise.
They got out of the car, and Tony resisted the urge to grab Steve’s hand right away. He wanted to. He thought if he could hold onto Steve, he’d feel a little easier in his head. He wasn’t sure why he was so nervous. It’s not like he’d never been in this position before. He had--at least, up to a point. In California, he’d been a pretty popular guy. He’d had a lot of friends. A lot of girlfriends. A lot of boyfriends. He’d spent time with a lot of people, but here, now, with Steve...it felt different. And he wanted to touch him. Wanted to hold his hand. He thought he’d feel better if he did.
Tony thought it over carefully, stripping the label bit by bit from his bottle.  Sam watched him think, waiting patiently for an answer.  And he expected one, that was clear.  This wasn’t rhetorical.  Sam wasn’t a rhetorical kind of guy, either, and that was
He slid down against the headboard until he was lying beside her.  It was strange having someone else here in his bed.  Strange, but good.  He took up a lot of room, but lately the mattress seemed to get bigger every time he laid down on it.  Bigger.  Colder.  Emptier.  Having Natasha here made it smaller again.
“Usually do,” he said, and was that a little snort of laughter he’d heard coming from the couch?  He thought it might have been.
Steve shook his head, not moving it from his knees.  “No.  No.  You’re not here.  You’re never here.  You need to go.  Leave me alone.”
“No,” Tony said, holding up his free hand, but keeping his finger twined with Steve’s. “It’s okay. Just call, okay? Please?”
“I’m not. If I was, I wouldn’t tell you I had nightmares and didn’t sleep last night. Just-” he moved Tony’s hand to his mouth and kissed the palm, “-You just gotta give me a little time, okay? A little space to work through this stuff. I’m still learning how to cope with it all without...you know…” he waved his hand in an indistinct manner, but Tony nodded immediately. He got it. Steve knew he would. He had grown up with Howard Stark, after all.
Tony ran a hand through his own hair, tugging at it a little. “And we were going to go at eight. Shit. You should have come and gotten me,” he said.
A bundle of blue polyester hit him squarely in the chest, all gangly, teenage octopus arms clinging to him.
Steve blushed. And for the first time, Tony didn’t have to wonder just how far down that pink flush went on his body. He could see it coloring his neck and chest perfectly well. Even in the shifting dark.
anything.  Steve was here.  Steve was home.  And a slightly higher water bill was the very last thing on Tony’s mind tonight.
His voice was small. Very small. And Steve felt bad again, but not for himself. Now he felt bad for Tony, and his small voice, and the way his shoulder was quivering slightly against Steve’s, and the pale shade of his skin, and he wished that there was something he could do to make him feel better. Make them both feel better.
“I wish I could.  I do.  But, I have somewhere I have to be.”  He wiped his eyes and took a breath.  “But I’m going to talk to Nat.  Have her figure out this thing with the girl.  I’ll have Nat fix it.”
Tony laughed.  “What?  Getting our whole family sloppy drunk and letting them sleep it off all over the house?  We do that enough, Steve.”
Steve drew in a breath, then let it out. The side of his mouth lifted in his old, familiar half-smile. “God. I guess it is.” He shook his head. “Time goes fast, doesn’t it? Seems like it was just Christmas.”
love you. And yeah, that’s what I’d be saying, because it’d be true. I love you now, and I’ll love you then.”
“Yeah, but the ones you hit went down hard.  And you got a strike in the fourth frame.  I think it was the best one anybody did all night.”
“I cannot believe you know a grown man named ‘Bucky’,” Tony said, glancing at the clock. Two am. They still had a little time. Just a little, but it was better than nothing.
“You did,” he said, removing Tony’s hand from his head.  “I knew you were in the next room if I needed to come get you.  That helped.
at something he loved. Something he had always loved, but had buried after signing his contract to join the army. Then buried deeper after what happened to Bucky and poor Jonathon. He thought about what it would be like to dig that up like a relic. Something ancient but valuable. Something precious.
time,” Tony said, and dug his nails into Steve’s hips, dragging him closer. “And kiss me while you do it.”
Steve just nodded. For some reason, that hurt worse than anything. That cocktail party tone. That don’t-be-ridiculous answer. It was like a knife on his skin. He turned away, turned his knees to the door, laid his head on the window. “Okay,” he said, and closed his eyes.
“Yeah, you’re going to have to come with us next time,” Tony agreed. “We might need some adult supervision.”
friends. Not the ones who used to act like they were friends and now ignored him or avoided him at every single turn, even going so far as to skip family dinners and movie nights just so they wouldn’t have to run into him. No.
“Look, Daddy!” she exclaimed, and pulled him forward while Steve paid the entrance fee, smiling at how excited she was.
Steve hung his head. He let out a breath, and Tony could see the way his mouth had bowed into a secret smile. “Doing what?” he asked.
“You say you wanted me to be the one to find you, but you flinch if I even try to come near you.”  He shook his head in wonder.  “I'm never going to be able to win with you, am I?”
Steve couldn’t help the tiny smile that surfaced on his lips. “You should go back to bed, instead. You look tired.”
knew it, but Tony was a special-occasion-only kind of guy.  He let Steve do the heavy lifting on the day-to-day front, and that was fine with Steve.  He liked cooking.  Liked taking individual, disparate things and turning them into something new.  Something more than the sum of its parts.  In a way, it was nearly god-like, that act of transformation.  Maybe that was blasphemy.  Steve didn’t care.  He didn’t care much about blasphemy anymore.  He’d stopped caring about the same time he’d encountered the Tesseract and realized there might be more out there than he’d previously believed.  Or, at least, different.  He still believed in God.  He just wasn’t so sure the God he believed in now got as worked up over the little things as the one he’d believed in when he was a kid.
Tony leaned a little closer, and Steve felt a thrill of heat jump from nerve-ending to nerve-ending inside his body. He willed himself not to shiver. It would be bad if he did that. Very bad indeed. He held his breath, waiting.
Steve knew he was here. He’d seen him a couple times. Just a quick glance as he moved from one side of the room to another. Once, he’d been holding her hand, the other time, he’d been carrying two glasses of champagne. He didn’t look Steve’s way either time, and Steve was quick to drop his own eyes, not wanting to accidentally catch Tony’s. Not wanting to make it seem like he’d been watching him. He hadn’t. Really, this time. At the ceremony, he had not been able to look away, but here, now, he just wanted to be left alone. He didn’t
to move--then spent the night slowly and methodically taking him apart, then keeping him as close to the edge as he could for as long as he could.  By the time Tony finally let him come, Steve was a sweaty, shuddering, panting mess. But he was better. He felt better.
Tony ran his hand down Steve’s chest, smoothing his tie. He knew he was being pretty obvious with his own flirting now, but Steve didn’t seem to mind. Was, in fact, still smiling that little smile. Still looking at him steadily with those dark eyes. Still not moving away, no matter how close Tony got or how long he let his hands linger. “I’ll bet they do,” he said. “I’m sure you have no trouble filling your dance card.”
“We've been through this. I don’t want you to wait, Tony,” Steve said. “That’s too much pressure. On both of us. It’s not-”
He never spoke during these meetings.  Nothing he could have said would make either them or himself feel any better.  He just sat and listened to them talk, arms folded, head down, taking it as a penance for not being strong enough, not being fast enough, not being where he should have been because of stupid decisions hastily made.  Their grief was his fault.  Their losses, because of him.
Steve glanced quickly into his eyes again, then back down at their joined hands. “But she’s working a swing shift today,” he said. “She won’t be home until three.”
He kissed her forehead. Just a quick kiss, and he loved how good that felt--how natural--and got to his feet. Dodger stayed where he was, but he opened his eyes and wagged his tail a couple of times in solidarity before closing them again.
Steve tried to think about it. It was hard. Lying like this with Tony, sometimes his mind felt a little fuzzy, but this seemed important to Tony, so he tried to focus. “I know Rhodey doesn’t think I’m good enough for you,” he said slowly, “but I hope he doesn’t hate me.” He lifted his head finally, worry piercing the softness in his head. “He doesn’t, does he? Hate me? God, Tony, does he hate me?”
Tony smiled. "I know." His heart was hammering in his chest, his stomach now doing easy, constant somersaults. But it felt good.
They stepped out into the hall and went down the stairs. At Steve’s door, Tony hitched Morgan up a little, then looked up at Steve. “You’re not going to send me and this angel-child out into the cold, dark night alone, are you?”
A voice in his ear.  He struggled toward it.  Struggled to find the breath to speak.  His hands scrabbled in the grass.  The rain was cold.  The ground was cold.  Christ, he was suddenly so cold.
But he didn’t. He stayed awake instead. Just holding Steve, just touching him, just watching over him while he slept. Just being with him. Knowing that he wouldn’t see him again for a long time, he didn’t want to waste a single second of
Steve threw the rest of his drink back. “Rough year,” he said, and tapped his glass. The bartender filled it without a word.
Steve took another sip of his drink. It was almost gone. He’d ordered a double, but even a double only lasted so long. Then what was he supposed to do with his hands? His brain didn’t seem to care about that though. That was the body’s problem, not the brain’s. The brain just went on being cool and confident. Just kept on making his mouth say words. “I’m not sure if I’m supposed to apologize or not.”
“You’ll do everything you can to help me succeed,” Tony went on lifelessly. And why not? He’d left his life back at that fourth-floor apartment. “Because that’s what’s best for
Tony came and hovered over him, nudging him with his foot.  “Don’t be mad, Cap,” he said.  “I really was kidding.  Although why you turn your nose up at
“You’re wrong.  Nothing’s too good for you.  Literally nothing.  God himself could come down and claim your ass and it still wouldn’t be good enough.”
I must admit, this is not my favorite chapter. I tried, but I'm not an action writer. I'm a feelings-person. It seemed to take me forever to get through it, and the result is not the greatest. Sorry 'bout that. :(
Tony turned around. He was still bare-chested, but Steve had put his jeans back on. A faded, rumpled pair that hung low on his hips. He’d thrown his towel casually over his shoulder. His feet were bare. A sudden possessive feeling swept over Tony as he looked at him. He’d felt it before. A lot. But never with such burning intensity. And the thought of anyone else seeing Steve like this made him almost feral with jealousy. “
Steve just shook his head. He didn’t take his hand away, but he cast his eyes at the ground again, refusing to look Tony’s way.
Tony shook him a little, then bit Steve’s lower lip gently between his own teeth. “Never,” he said, and when Steve’s smile grew, Tony thought maybe he hadn’t lost all of his innocence after all. And he was glad. More than glad.
He nodded, his fingers curling into Steve’s arm. “Yeah. Yeah, I’m fine.” He leaned forward and touched Steve’s hair, cupped his cheek. “Are
--was here right now. The part that would always be a six-year-old kid, waking up scared from a nightmare, wanting to go and climb up into his daddy’s bed and lie beside him all night, where he would feel protected. Safe. That part of him loved this. That part of him wanted to believe this was real.
,” Tony said, and both men looked at him.  Ross’ face held that same disdain, but it was Steve’s Tony was more interested in.  There was anger there.  And worse, betrayal.
When the elevator opened, Steve got off and went to the door.  Music blared even through the soundproofing.  It must be a cacophony of sound inside.  Tony reveled in it.  Or maybe he didn’t notice it at all.
Pietro pulled back and looked at him, his eyes delving into Steve’s. Steve wasn’t sure what he was looking for, but he must have found it--or not--because he sighed again and pressed his lips firmly against Steve’s, holding him in place with one hand on his cheek. It was not the same kind of kiss they’d had in the past. This one was different. It was filled with sadness, and maybe a little relief. It tasted like good-bye.
Tony didn’t understand.  Had stomped out of the room leaving Steve alone again, badly hurt, nearly broken.  Steve didn’t blame him.  Perhaps in Tony’s shoes, he would have done the same thing, but what Tony couldn’t see was that Steve was doing this
To be fair, Tony was obviously flustered too. He reached out and grasped Steve’s shoulders. “Don’t move,” he said, and Steve nodded gratefully, letting him take over. Tony stepped closer, and slipped his arms around Steve’s shoulders, drawing him in. Steve let himself be drawn, let himself sink--just a little--into his embrace, wrapping himself up in Tony’s arms, in the scent of him, in the warmth of him, the familiarity of him.
Fury put a hand on Steve’s shoulder.  “You know I’ll back him, Thaddeus,” he said, and inwardly, Steve sagged with relief.  His posture, however, remained upright, square, strong.
Clint and Laura had come up a day early, and Clint spent the day with Tony stringing fairy lights on the deck and the back of the house.  Clint climbed up in the trees to do those too, he and Tony tossing the balls of lights from one to the next as Clint moved with dexterous ease among the branches.  Tony was glad he was there.  He was too old for that kind of thing.  Clint knew it too, but to his credit, never said it aloud.
After he sipped his new cup, Strange said, “Yes, you are right.  At the time, I did say those things, and at the time, they were one hundred percent true.  Steve was in a mental facility.  He was not in full possession of his faculties.  He had tried to commit suicide multiple times.”
Steve sighed, the fire in his eyes going out. He leaned heavily back against the seat. He didn’t move Tony’s hand from his, but he didn’t turn his hand to take it either. Tony had almost thought he would. Almost wished he would. “Am I?” he asked. “I don’t know, Tony. It’s not like I’ve been here. Right? I mean, this is the first time I’ve been home--really
“Are you kidding?” Tony replied.  “An invitation for afternoon cuddles?  I’ll never turn that down.”
rose automatically to his lips, but they didn’t come out like they always did. For some reason, they didn’t come out. He didn’t say them.
Tony’s hand shifted in his a bit, his fingers grasping Steve’s tighter. “Maybe...maybe you could do it again?” he asked. “I wasn’t ready last time. I think I missed most of it.”
Tony waved as he drove away, then took the pizza inside and set it on the table.  The box was still warm, and it smelled heavenly, but it barely registered as he crossed the room and opened the back door.
Tony kept his hand in Steve’s hair, kept petting him until his breathing evened out and he was asleep.  It didn’t take very long.  Steve fell asleep easier now, stayed asleep longer.  His nightmares were less frequent, less violent when they did come.  Tony felt an intense satisfaction in that.  In knowing that he was part of the reason Steve finally slept soundly through the night.  It was probably wrong to feel that way, to take personal pride in something that really only boiled down to a physiological need, but, who gave a fuck?  Steve used to have profound, scream-inducing night-terrors.  Now, he did not.  Tony didn’t think he was the
“You come to us anytime you need to, sweetheart,” she said loudly enough for Steve--and Howard--to hear. “You’re
Steve dug his toe into the ground, looking down. “How does she like being in New York?” he asked, his voice deceptively light.
Tony hooked his finger into Steve’s belt loop and pulled him closer.  He reached up and ran his hand through soft, blond hair.  “You’re gonna be the death of me, baby, you know that?”
“Can you two go rub up against each other somewhere else?” Clint said. “The rest of us are trying to watch the movie.”
They spoke only once during this ritualistic act.  After the first pass, Steve lathered up a second time.
She stepped into him and kissed his cheek.  When she pulled back, her eyes were far away.  “Of course, I get that,” she said.  “Sometimes you have to give up on a dream,” her eyes drifted up to the window.  When they settled on it, they cleared.  “Before you can find something real.”
He climbed back into the 'Cuda and keyed the engine.  It growled to life, and Steve patted the dashboard. He loved this car.  He had loved the Bentley too, because it had been the car that had brought them to the cabin--brought them
FRIDAY had commandeered Ross’ security systems, and now used them to project Doctor Baxter’s files up in the air.  She scrolled through them, letting the words move.  Tony watched Ross’ face, watched his peculiar brand of non-reaction.
“You’re always worth the wait,” Steve said, and while the blaze in his eyes didn’t go out, it did dim.  Like a cozy fire in a hearth instead of a forest fire.  “I’ve waited for you my whole life.  When I met Peggy, I thought it was her.  And I loved her.  I wanted her.  And I would have been happy with her.  But you...I never knew who I was until I met you.  Or who I
was happy. He smiled, settling further against Tony’s chest. Tony kissed his temple, scratching his nails over Steve’s bare chest, circling his nipples, making him squirm. “I’m going to make you feel good too, baby. Give you everything you need.” He trailed hot kisses down Steve’s neck, fingers caressing smooth skin. “Make you forget everything bad that happened today. I can’t have my baby feeling bad, now can I?”
Strange grasped his elbow and led him down the hallway.  Steve looked back over his shoulder. Rhodey was there with Pepper, holding her and rubbing her back.  How were they all here so fast? he wondered. How were they all here when he, Tony's partner, was just finding out?
Howard nodded, and this time the look on his face was something else entirely. Steve could have sworn it looked like pride. “I’m sure you do, Steven.”
could probably get away with it. At least as far as Tony knew, there wasn’t that undercurrent of attraction and desire that ran between Clint and Steve. Not like there was with Tony. That thing that skewed every interaction they had just a little bit. Just enough to either make it slightly more uncomfortable or exponentially more wonderful.
They ordered burgers and fries, and ate while they talked about the movie. They disagreed about it. Steve liked it. Tony didn’t.
“When I graduate, I’ll come to work for the company. I’ll be good at it. I already know I’ll be good at it. I’ll work there, and train there, and when you retire, I’ll take it over. Because that’s what’s best for me. For my future.” Tony looked at him, his eyes dull and glazed with hurt and hatred. He looked at his father. The man who had just brought his whole life to a standstill. The man who had done everything in his power to hurt the one man Tony loved completely. Steve could say it wasn’t true, but Tony knew the reality. He’d lived with Howard all his life. He knew what he was capable of.
Steve stilled instantly, his breath catching in his throat.  He closed his eyes, his hair caught the lamplight, spinning it into gold, as he pushed himself off the bed and stood up.  “I’m sorry,” he muttered.  “I--You’re right.  I’m sorry.”
He came back into the living room and sat down in the chair. Nick had fallen asleep, but Natasha was looking at him. “Can I get you anything?” he asked. “Some crackers or toast or something?”
Neither came right out and said that they were acknowledging the fact that another month, another year, another
He felt a flare of irritation, but it burned away quickly as he watched him in the water. It was dark. Steve--of course, it was Steve--had not turned on the pool lights, but there was enough light from the moon above and the city below for Tony to see him, see the way he moved, the way he slipped through the water in a way that was both efficient yet oddly delicate. A dancer more than a competitor. Art more than athletics. He watched him. He watched him and not only was he no longer irritated, he instead felt a wave of deep homesickness for him. For the way they used to be. A wave of longing. Of want. And he found himself moving again toward the pool, or, rather, moving toward the person
“I’m not laughing.”  But he was.  That patented Tony Stark smile was on his face, half-taunting, half-challenging, all-exasperating.  Steve wondered briefly what it would take to wipe it off his face for a minute.  He was sure there was something, but he wasn’t prepared to try any theories.  That was a dangerous road to go down, and once he started, there would be no exits, no turning back, he would have to go on through to the end, and he wasn’t entirely sure what the destination would look like when they got there.
Steve shook his head. He kept his hands clenched behind his back. He was right. He could feel them starting to shake, and he was glad he had them hidden. “No, sir,” he said. “I thought it was...you know, because I’m a guy...but that’s not it, is it?”
,” he mumbled. “She’ll kill me.” He bit his lip. “She’ll kill us both," he amended, "but I’ll get the worst of it.”
Steve shook his head and put his hands in his pockets. Tony could see him blush even in the dim stairwell. “No. She, um. She said she was done with dick.”
Not about anything very serious. Just small talk. Weather. Stuff on the news. Office gossip. Never actual business, though. They talked business before and after lunch, but never during. That was
Don't worry too much about this! I swear we are not going back into the darkness, maybe just a step into the shadows for a second. We have come WAY too far to go back now! Our boys will get their happiness. And I'm not like Steve--I'm promising! :)
for as long as you could, and when you stepped out--by Time’s decision, or your own--you did it with a little sigh. And so what if that sigh was one of relief? It didn’t hurt anybody. There was no one there to hurt.
Steve just shook his head, looking embarrassed but happy, and Tony couldn’t resist wrapping his arms around him and squeezing him tightly. Steve tucked his head down onto Tony’s shoulder.
. And that was true. Time went by so fast. Even though days like today seemed to last forever, time went by so fucking
somersault again. Tony nodded back, the corner of his own mouth quirking upward. Steve ducked his head. That grin resurfaced, just a flash, there and gone, and Tony could have sworn a blush had painted those perfect high cheekbones a pale, pretty pink. Of course, that could have been the setting sun. Probably. Just the sun. A trick of the fading light. There’s no reason why Steve should blush just because Tony smiled at him. Just because he’d given him a wicked little grin across the length of the deck while all their friends stood around them. Just because he’d arched his eyebrow just enough to mean...something. Whatever. Whatever Steve wanted to think it meant. Even if it meant nothing at all, maybe Steve would go to bed tonight thinking about it. Thinking about
Steve had talked to his mom that night when he got home. Mrs. Perkins brewed them both tea, sat them down at the kitchen table, then left them alone, descending the stairs in small, careful steps, purse hung over her arm. She would have liked to listen to what Steven had to say, but this was a family-talk. She was sure dear Sarah would tell her all about it eventually. She just hoped Steven was all right. That he and the other boy hadn’t hurt each other too badly. Steven was so sweet, so sensitive, and the thought of him being hurt--especially by someone who obviously loved him so much--was almost too much for her to bear.
, part of Tony’s mind said.  It was cold, that part, cruel, cynical.  It had been kindled inside him and nurtured under first Howard, then Obadaiah Stane’s watchful eyes.  It had been his unwitting twin.  His dark, secret brother, and nothing good ever happened to Tony without its jealous input putting a layer of malice overtop.
Tony groaned and pushed himself closer to Steve’s chest. “You have never been hotter than you are right this second.”
Tony’s eyes flicked to Sam and he held his hands up.  “Leave me out of this,” he laughed.  “She’s put me on the floor more times than I can count.”
Bucky shook his head, still smiling a little, but Steve could see the lines around his eyes intensifying. “Would
Even as she thought it, another voice called out.  “Steve?”  Natasha looked down the hill.  She knew the voice, knew the line of the shoulder, the set of the jaw.  She never went with Steve when he visited Wakanda, even though he asked her to.  He didn’t question her about it and that was a good thing, because it was too complicated in her own mind to explain it.  She had dreams, though, dreams where he chased her under that freeway overpass again and again with murder in his eyes.  There were other dreams too.  Dreams of a dark shape in a red room, watching her but never coming close enough to see, just a shape and a voice saying her name like it was saying it now, here on this hilltop with the man they both loved lying on the ground between them.
Then Mick Jagger was strutting his way through “Satisfaction”, and Tony went to work.  Those engines weren’t going to rebuild themselves.
Tony forced his head up enough to press his lips to Steve’s neck, his chin, his cheek, his lips, finally his lips, small, soothing little kisses that were almost more for himself than Steve.
The party raged for another two hours after Natasha and Bruce left, and then people finally started dropping off.
Steve ducked his head, almost giddy with embarrassment and pleasure. He felt flushed. It was the whiskey kicking in, he was almost positive of it. “Shut up, Tony.”
Steve lay back and rubbed his arm across his eyes.  “I am, though.  Right now, I couldn’t be better.”
Tony kissed his cheek and patted his arm.  “I don’t kiss and tell, baby,” he said.  “It’s tacky.  Rhodey!  What’s this I hear about you threatening to shoot my door down?”
Tony’s eyes snapped to his face. Steve was still looking up at him. His eyes still filled with that sweet innocence that Tony had grown to crave. “You did?” he asked, and there was no way he could keep that slight tremor out of his voice. No fucking way.
Then Steve was in his arms, holding him, kissing him, making him whole again.  “Tony,” Steve said into his shoulder.  “Tony.  Tony, Tony, Tony.  I’m sorry.  I’m sorry I didn’t believe.  I just...I've been so lost.”
Tony sat, weighing other questions in his mind.  Strange wouldn’t answer all of them, and if he lost his patience with Tony, he wouldn’t answer any of them.  He was working on borrowed time here with the good doctor, and he knew it.
Steve sunk slowly, reluctantly, to his knees. Part of him rose up in protest. Part of him railed at himself to get up, just get up tell Thaddeus Ross to fuck off, and stomp out of the apartment forever. Maybe slam the door for good measure.
After the Howard-debacle, they started studying in a corner of the library. Sometimes Sam joined them. Sometimes Natasha or Clint would come and sit with them for an hour, but usually it was just Steve and Tony. Tony and Steve. Sitting across from each other in the quiet room, talking in hushed tones about history for Steve, and Advanced Calculus for Tony. Steve had no idea what he was saying, but he liked listening to Tony talk about it.
Tony adjusted one more strand of hair, spent a few seconds lamenting the gray that was starting to show up near his temples, then finally made his way to the kitchen.
“I’m not throwing him-” Tony began, then reconsidered. “Okay, maybe I was a little. But you saw him tonight. He was acting all weird.”
Steve drank more coffee. It was calming. A regular thing to do. That’s what he was. Just a regular guy. Drinking coffee like a regular guy. “Well, maybe a little surprised,” he conceded. “That’s not something you hear much in general conversation.”
Tony drew in a deep, sudden breath. He let it out slowly, frowning, while Sam made a visible effort to get himself under control. It didn’t take long. Sam was a man in control of his emotions. Tony had always admired that, especially since it was so different from himself.
He didn’t. Not really. He knew Tony was infatuated with him. That was obvious, and while Steve loved that, loved the attention and care that it brought with it, he didn’t
Steve let himself think about that for a few seconds. Tony beneath him. Or maybe on top of him. Riding his cock, biting at his lips, sucking his tongue, skin hot and slick, moaning in the back of his throat like he did when it was really,
,” he said.  “I know you hate it when I say that, but it’s true.  Don’t you see that?  You come from here, you belong here, your problems are ones they know how to deal with.  What doctor knows how to deal with me, Tony, huh?  How do they help a guy who was dead for seventy years then brought back to life and told to fit in?  Everybody I know is dead.  Everything I know is either gone or completely different.  It’s not even fair to ask a doctor to try and help me.  It’d be like asking a ten-year-old to do brain surgery.”
A miniature war was then waged inside Steve’s body. The brain wanted to tell him to fuck off. The rest of him, however, staged a coup, and won--for the moment, at least. He smiled, looked at Tony from under his lashes, and Tony seemed to ease a bit. His eyes got warmer. His lips curved up into a little smile of his own. Steve was glad. More than glad. Thrilled.
Tony kissed his forehead again, then slipped lower, tucking himself under Steve’s chin and curling up against his chest, nestling into the soft space inside his arms. “Hundreds of times, baby. All the times, ‘kay?”
Steve got to his feet.  This was no place to be thinking about such things.  It was no time to do it either.  “Thanks, Tony,” he called.  “I’ll see you later.”
He didn’t say anything else. He just jogged toward the bus and climbed up inside. He tried not to think as the bus pulled away from the curb. Tried not to think about where he was going. That he was going there alone. That he wouldn’t have Sam, or his mother, or…
“We were going to watch the fireworks,” Tony said, but one look at Steve’s face told him everything.
But either way, Tony and Steve would have some time to themselves.  Some time to be quiet and calm and relax.  Some time to see how they fit together, where they’d have to compromise, and where they wouldn’t.  There’d be fights--they were, after all, still
“Make what-” Steve began, then stopped. He could feel a blush rising out of the collar of his shirt. The shirt he was definitely wearing, which was good, because he usually walked around for half an hour or so without one after a shower, but for some reason, had thrown one on this morning. He smiled again. There was no stopping it. And no reason for it. This strange alchemy he was feeling was new. Very, very new. And very, very wrong. “I got a couple bucks in my wallet,” he said. “How’s that?”
Steve laughed and slid down the headboard until he was lying on the pillow.  It was exactly what Tony had hoped for.  He’d wanted Steve to relax, and now here he was, smiling and mellow.  All Tony had to do was tell a stupid joke, and he was putty.  There was a very potent power in that, Tony thought.  They say it’s music that soothes the savage beast, and while Steve was neither savage, nor a beast, he could be soothed.  Although, in his case, it was humor, not music that did it.  Tony loved that.  Loved that he could do that.  Loved that Steve let him do that.
If I get inspired to write anything else in this verse, it will be as a separate story, so I don't leave you all hanging with a question-mark chapter count LOL! Thank you again for everything. I love you all!
Instead of answering, Steve reached into his pocket.  The movement disrupted the cat, and Sir Purr leapt lightly down off his lap, threw him a disgruntled look over his shoulder, and sauntered away, tail held high.  Steve watched him go, frowning, then held a hand out to Tony.  There was something in it.  Paper that had once surely been perfect, pristine white, but was now dog-eared and marked with creases.  It looked like it had spent a lot of time in that pocket.  A lot of time in that hand.
“Nobody’s going to talk about it, baby,” he assured him.  “Not unless you bring it up.  Then we’ll talk as much as you want.”
He was three days past a week-long bender.  Or so.  He wasn’t one hundred percent sure anymore.  He wasn’t one hundred percent sure about anything anymore.  Except that it was easier to stay drunk here because no one came around.  He was alone.  And being alone here was better than being alone in the Tower for another reason too:  Steve had never been here, so he couldn’t miss Steve while he was here.  No, this place was completely and utterly Steve-free.  No thoughts of him lounging by the pool.  Or cooking in the kitchen.  Or running on the beach.  Or lying there on the couch, the sky ablaze in the window behind him, sunset painting his bare skin in alternating stripes of red and orange, his head thrown back, long lashes against his cheeks, whispering love-words while Tony lay between his thighs doing things to him that no one had ever been allowed to do before because Steve was
He used one finger to urge Steve’s mouth wider, then slipped his cock into that warm, wet heat. Steve groaned around it. God, he loved this. He loved doing this for Tony. The feel of him in his mouth, the taste of him, the sounds he made, it was everything Steve had ever dreamed of and more. Everything he’d ever wanted.
at Tony. Wouldn’t meet his eyes at all. They went anywhere and everywhere else, bouncing around like a pinball in an old-timey machine, but never quite touching on Tony’s.
promise me that, smartass,” he said.  “It was hot the first couple times, but if it happens again, people are going to start talking about that Tony Stark and his jailbird lover, and--”
"Don't call me that," Steve said, but his voice was immeasurably warmer than it had been a moment ago.  Like liquid honey. Tony wanted to bathe in it.
“Good.” He kissed Tony one more time. Just a small one. Just enough. Just perfect. “Valentine’s Day always seemed like it was for people who have something to make up for,” he said. “And you and me?” Steve shrugged. “I don’t really think we have anything to make up for. It’s always here. It’s always right here.”
Steve didn’t say anything. He touched the ring. Carefully. Delicately. The texture smooth and perfect under the trembling pad of his finger.
