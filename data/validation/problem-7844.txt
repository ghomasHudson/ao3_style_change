“Just leave him alone okay.” Steve said
“Now you can rest now because I have things to do.” Tony said leaving the room and Peter smiled he was gone! He could escape! Peter was just about to get out the EMP from his pocket when he noticed it was gone! Why was it gone! Did he drop it! Peter looked around wildly for the device but couldn’t find it anywhere. Peter then noticed the device outside of his box on the floor. It fell out when he was running. Peter looked at it and just wished he had his web shooters on him right now.
“How’s it going?” Ironman asked and Steve almost broke character.
“I’m coming in!” Tony said and opened the door walking in.
“I saw that though you threatened him and you could have killed him!” Peter said raising his voice and getting in a defensive stance.
“What are you doing here?” Jensen questioned him.
“Let him go or I kill us both.” Tony said holding up an EMP. Ironman’s eyes widened looking at Tony scared.
“Hey can I talk to you for a minute?” Steve asked Tony and Tony looked to Ironman and that made Steve angry. Ironman nodded waving his hand and Tony smiled.
“Don’t attack him!” Tony yelled at them and they backed up scared of Tony putting their weapons down. Ironman hid behind Tony feeling scared and almost crying.
“Well you’re gonna be late.” May said and Peter looked at her puzzled.
“I know.” Tony said and Natasha and Steve just looked at them more baffled. ‘I have an idea!’ Tony thought to Ironman excitedly and thought of the idea to Ironman. ‘Alright but you gotta turn the lights off.’ Ironman said and Tony nodded.
“Umm you got a meeting Tony...” Pepper said still looking at them both kind of confused.
“JARVIS never let me leave my lab without my sunglasses on.” Tony commanded.
“Peter can I ask you a question?” Tony asked and Peter scoffed.
“What the f*ck Tony!” Natasha yelled after him and sighed frustrated.
“So onto the plan.” Tony said and Ironman sighed.
“I’m sorry Peter... you were a part of the family... I was just... you know, little bro.” Alex said sadly.
“Ackles is my last name, how about you?” Jensen asked and Peter shook his head not prepared for the question.
Tony pulled on the chain and Peter stumbled forward growling.
“Sir there seems to be an intruder trying to get in the room through the vents.” Jarvis informed Tony and Ironman.
“Right...” Tony gulped nervously.
“Take my collar away from Misha I can’t have him around it anymore!” Peter yelled blushing still embarrassed.
“It’s okay Jensen, I forgive you.” Peter said smiling. Jensen sat back down and sighed.
“What do we do Tony!” Ironman said getting scared. ‘It’s okay calm down everything will be alright just calm down we’ll work through this together.’ Tony thought and Ironman calmed down.
“I wanted to ask you a favor.” Steve said nervously and Tony sighed.
One day Mark came in and he just cried by his bedside.
“How did you do that?” Tony asked puzzled and felt a bit of hope return maybe Steve would take him back.
“Get off Tin can.” Peter yelled out glaring at Tony. Tony shocked him again and Peter yelped out in pain.
“S-Stay away from me!” Peter yelled backing up.
~~~~~
“Why? Did you expect something different?” Ironman asked chuckling a little bit.
“Okay.” Steve said and they walked back to the kitchen.
“How you felt towards him?” Tony treaded carefully.
“I really messed up!” Tony yelled his eyes flaming as he cried.
“I am Ironman.” Ironman said separating from Tony and standing up while Tony smiled up at him still sitting down. Natasha shocked him and Ironman growled and Tony glared at Natasha getting in the line of fire if anyone else dared attack him.
“Please let me go.” Tony pleaded keeping his eyes shut tight.
“Did anyone else notice that?” Steve asked as Tony left the room.
‘Mr. Downey’ ‘Mr. Stark?’ Tony and Robert thought confusion clear in the air.
“Uh.. well I just feel insecure about them.” Tony said blushing in embarrassment.
“Steve, any other questions?” Tony asked leaning against Ironman.
~~~next time~~~
“Woah.” Steve said excitedly and smiled like an excited puppy.
, the last time being when Tony had left for three weeks just a few months after Peter’s official adoption.
“Tony will talk,” Bruce informs him after a few minutes of silence between them, nodding in finality, “Just give him the time to do so.”
Steve smiles a bit, albeit awkwardly. “No,” he says, shaking his head, but none the less not moving from the doorway, as if stuck there, “Just not quite sure what’s supposed to happen next is all.”
Tony doesn’t say a word.
However, Tony’s nothing if not perceptive, because he whispers, ever so quietly,
“What’s going on?” he asks quietly, daring to try again.
, which leads to a lot of arguments he really doesn’t want to have, especially not with Steve.
Steve sighs, letting his head loll back to rest against the head rest of the seat, hands tightening and untightening as the unease tightens in the pit of his stomach. He wants to scream at Tony, but he also wants to beg Tony to say anything, because he’s so worried about Tony at that moment, so worried that Tony is going to have a breakdown and worried because he can’t do much to stop it if he does. The tension is fisting painfully tight around his throat, threatening to choke him out if he doesn’t push at Tony, doesn’t make the man bend and explain himself, and Steve knows it’s the soldier side in him that desires this, to make Tony follow his orders—no, actually—it’s the Captain side in him.
He’d thought up these scenarios, ideas of how he could’ve saved them if he had been there, because Mom didn’t know how to drive, so he pictured himself leaping to the rescue when Dad clenches at his chest and lets go of the wheel, veering them out of the way in time to avoid hitting that tree. Fantasies of how he could’ve saved them both, how he could’ve still had his mother’s kind words and his father’s constant pushing, fantasies now being ripped to shreds right in front of him because they could’ve never been true; there would’ve been no saving either of them because he would’ve just been killed with them instead, and in that moment, all he can think is how much he’d preferred that to knowing that the story he’s believed for over twenty years has been a complete and utter
Steve is privy to updates from his team members, but he makes it clear early on; he can’t join on this mission. It’s not that he doesn’t want to—it’s because he can’t bear the idea of leaving Peter alone at this time. Peter’s so fragile, so on the edge that Steve’s honestly afraid of leaving Peter alone, and all he wants to do at that very moment is shelter Peter from the entire rest of the world. So he does his best to—he allows Peter to hide in his suite, keeping him close and distracted at every possible moment, putting on various movies and TV shows and playing video games and teaching him chess; anything he can think of, and Peter’s just receptive enough for this to even work. Steve’s just happy he doesn’t cry every waking moment of the day, that he can even smile for just a hint of time, and it’s pretty much all he can ask for.

“With my life,” Steve responds automatically.
He goes through three things on his list—Marvin Gaye, the Human Centipede (Clint put it on the list and he didn’t want to even
Steve hopes he’s doing his best to hide that from Tony.
Steve grins. He really likes it when Tony does the dad voice, mostly because Tony doesn’t even realize that he has one in the first place. The dad voice predates Peter, but its usage has only increased since Peter joined their lives, and it’s always a treat, to get to hear it.
whose lips are constricted so tight around the base of his cock, that it really is
(In the morning, Peter finds them tangled up together on the couch, and after screeching in glory, he runs off to find Clint, leaving behind his two disorientated, confused and affectionate parents. He’s apparently made a bet with the rest of the team about them getting together—Clint and Bruce apparently thinking it’ll never happen [which offends Tony] and Natasha apparently knowing it would [which kind of scares Steve]. Clint’s resounding screech of utter anger and
Tony makes a noncommittal shrug, but he responds, “Because I knew you’d get it.” Tony flicks a glance over at him. “You get me better than Bruce does sometimes. Maybe even better than Rhodey, but we can’t tell him that.” Steve can’t help the small smile that arises. “I figured if there was anyone who was going to steer me in the right direction, it’d be you. And you did.”
, he's just doing his best to hide it by keeping to habit as best as he can—and Steve also knows he has no choice other than to allow Peter is abject anger. It’s deserved, especially considering that it’s Steve who’s supposed to be the adult in the equation.
“Tony, never say that again!” Peter calls from his place sandwiched between Natasha and Clint on the couch, “You are hereby banned, forever, from
“It’s adorable,” Tony agrees with a fond smile, “Utterly adorable.” He looks over at Steve, who’s looking at him with a look that Tony can’t entirely interpret other than its contrast to the smile that’s slowly slipping from his lips. It’s mildly discomforting, and wholly worrying, so he turns fully to the other man, unsure of what to do about it.
It’s the second day of Peter’s most recent infiltration of Steve’s apartment while Tony was away in Copenhagen for yet another conference, which he’d (for lack of a better way to put it) bitched and moaned about having to go to for about two weeks straight before Happy had to come in and physically drag Tony to his jet
Steve has to resist the urge to follow after him. It’s one of these times where Steve’s had enough experiences in the past when dealing with Bucky to know not to push Peter about something he didn’t want to talk about, although Peter wasn’t exactly about to show him the same courtesy just moments before. It’s just another facet of Peter that reminds him of Bucky—he somehow gets this persuasion that his own problem will just burden others, and therefore refuses to tell, only growing more and more frustrated and volatile the more he’s pushed towards expression. Sure, Bucky never actually hit him—and he doubts that Peter would even try, if put in the position—but it’s an argument he has no desire to push towards right now. He doesn't want to force Peter to talk if he doesn't want to, because he knows he'll eventually come out and say it on his own terms.
Peter sighs, visibly deflating. “I
Steve doesn’t push it.
Warm hands grab at his cheeks, and he can barely hear Steve’s deep voice as he tries to talk to him; his heartbeat’s so loud. Tony’s dimly aware that he’s having a panic attack, but it feels worse than that, his heart hurts so damned
Tony grins his toothy goofy grin, finger ghosting over the surface of the page, careful not to leave a smudge.
“Wanna talk about it?” Steve asks, looking at Tony, who’s still curled in on himself.
Steve stands awkwardly at the door, as if he must be invited in so that he many enter, watching Tony with a gaze that he can’t truly quantify, which is worrying because the idea of
Steve’s facial expression apparently is more than sufficient an answer, because before he can even
“Teee,” Tony fumbles out.
He even picks up doughnuts and coffee on his way.
This makes Steve’s list of beautiful things, too, bumping the Italian countryside in at dawn right off the list. Sad, but as long as it’s Tony, Steve supposes it’s okay.
They don’t stay for too much longer, because the moment the front door of the house they’re watching opens, Tony puts the key in the ignition and tears away from the sidewalk, which doesn’t allow Steve to process too much other than an aged, but familiar, set of brown eyes in the rearview mirror. Tony’s silent again through the car ride over to Peter’s school, eyes trained on the road and hands tight on the wheel, and Steve doesn’t try to get him to speak this time—he can tell Tony needs this silence, and Steve’s more than happy to give it to him.
“C’mon, Mr. Rogerrrrrrs,” Peter drawls as he hangs off of Steve’s right arm after the man announces that he’s bidding them a goodnight, “Stay for dinner at least!”

Rhodey sighs, rubbing his forehead. “He’s right, then. You guys do need to talk,” he says, exasperated, “Because you
Steve’s resolve, by then, is but a distant memory, chased away by the smell of engine grease and hot metal and expensive cologne that is Tony’s usual, and Steve swallows before getting to his feet before him, hand reaching out to rest on Tony’s hip. Heat slices through the fabric of Tony’s MIT t-shirt, and it’s so enticing that Steve has to place another hand upon his hips in order to fully experience it. He watches as Tony’s tongue darts out to lick at his dried lips, speaking towards some sort of dehydration, and in the back of his mind, Steve makes it a point to, at some point, Tony drinks some water before he passes out. He doesn’t think about it too much now, though, not when Tony’s looking at him with such utter desire evident in his eyes.
—but Tony did always like telling him how life isn’t fair.
(Later, when Peter goes to bed that night, Steve stays up and watches
“You bastard, Steve Rogers,” he grumbles as he looks at the new bruise that’s blossoming on his skin in the bathroom mirror, pretending to be more aggravated than he is, giving Steve’s reflection a glare when the man chortles. “You

He means every single bit of it, and he’s sure that he looks nothing less than as wrecked as he feels.
It doesn’t take long to work Steve open. Sure, at first, Steve goes so tense that Tony’s almost sure that he’ll break his finger with the contraction (which Tony can only assume would make for a funnier story than it would an arousing experience, considering the fact that he can’t be sure his erection would persist if he got his finger crushed in another man’s sphincter, no matter
Steve is willing to consider the prospect that his crush on Tony (it feels childish to call his love for him a crush, like he’s some sort of gushy teenage girl, but if he admits to himself that it’s love then it’ll hurt more in the long run, so he doesn’t) is one that is completely evident—maybe even blatantly so—but it’s still downright embarrassing that its obvious nature has been pointed out by a twelve-year-old. He knows Peter means well, otherwise he wouldn’t bring it up at all, but it’s still mortifying that his affections for another man is obvious to a child who’s not even a quarter of his age (he still kind of struggles to reconcile the fact that he’s

“But—”

“W-What?” Steve stutters out.
Instead, he’s humming.

“Tony sees me as a friend,” he says, “Nothing more.”

should!”
Peter’s lips pucker slightly as he actually thinks of a good example to give, staring into the oversized green blanket he always brings with him every time he comes to stay at Steve’s. It’s more than a comfort, for Peter at least, what with the well-worn corners that threaten to tear into holes, as well as the multitude of stains—some grease, some tomato sauce, and some entirely too unidentifiable for Steve’s comfort—and Peter holds this ratty old thing as if it’s some sort of anchor, hands fisted tight into the fabric.

“Nat’ll be home soon,” he tells him, shaking his head in amusement, chuckling.
“Somebody had to after you decided to be a selfish jerk,” Steve responds with a snap. He’s trying to use the anger he barely feels to keep Tony at arm’s length. It’s the only thing he can do to keep his feelings for Tony from forcing him into making another mistake.
He wouldn’t contest to being a prime example of a seasoned professional when it comes to dealing with panic attacks, especially with the intensity in which Tony gets them. In fact, to be completely honest, he’d never even been near one
), but he figures that he knew what he was signing up for with the former ROTC student that Rhodey was back in the day. Rhodey does his best to make sure that they don’t fall out of touch, randomly messaging him to check up, answering the video calls whenever he can, which is practically all the damn time despite how annoying Tony finds the connectivity problems that so easily can be rectified by simply a change in devices.
Tony looks full-on disgusted, but Steve can tell it’s in good fun because he jokes, “Only in a specific set of parameters, which includes no less than a bed, whipped cream and nipple clamps.”

“No,” Steve answers automatically. It’s not even a lie. He’s already aware that he can’t avoid a man whose building he lives in, much less a man who’s also his teammate. He’s just not… not ready. Not ready to talk to Tony. He’s afraid that if he does, then he’ll admit something he’s just not prepared to let loose, and it’ll be the beginning of the end for their relationship as it stands presently.
“Not as much as you care about whoever it is that pulled the trigger, apparently,” Clint argues, gritting his teeth, “Because you

but at Tony, “and she was gorgeous. And you’re gorgeous. And I’m still not good enough.”
, Tony manages to crack a smirk.
Steve sighs now himself. “What brought this up, Peter?” he asks, “Why is this what we’re talking about?” It’s all kind of out of left field, at least to Steve. There’s no rhyme or reason for this to be current conversation—it had no precursor, no build-up into the discussion. There’s something being left unsaid, Steve knows it—and, honestly? It’s a little bit worrying.
There’s something unspoken, and Steve is almost afraid of what it is, because he’s got the feeling that he knows exactly what Tony’s avoiding saying, but he doesn’t get the chance to contemplate any of it, because Natasha shouts his name suddenly, and he turns just in time to see the news stations airing the image of a helicopter racing towards Tony’s Malibu house, the Malibu house he’s

do a good job at hiding it.”
lose you.”
And, if there is a bigger travesty to come out this whole mess, Tony can’t see it, and it just wrecks him, because it’s one thing for him to lose a love—it’s entirely different for his son to lose yet another parent. It’s something he wanted to spare him of, save him the pain of, and yet, here he found himself; a catalyst in the destruction of the small family Peter found himself, finding himself shouldered with pain like no other.
“Good,” Tony says, probably going back to his work, “Because that’s not something you should be holding out for. Anything you want to happen between Steve and I probably doesn’t exist in the realm of possibility.” That statement kind of hurts, Steve has to admit, but not as much as what Tony says next: “Not that he’s even interested in someone like
“Well, that’s off the table,” he informs Steve, “Next?”

Tony’s confused, but at the same time, he’s beginning to content himself with the prospect that Steve’s come to his senses.
Peter looks, for a moment, hilariously disgusted.
Tony sighs now, smile near gone. “Yeah, it is, because it was a fucking stupid thing to be stressed about, Steve, you’ve got no idea. Still is.”
“Peter, you can’t just…

enough to pass it up. Besides, he’s in need to be distracted—why not let Steve be the provider of said distraction?

You got him to calm down without pushing him too far, and I appreciate it.”
Tony smirks, not looking away from Peter. “Thanks, Steve,” he whispers sincerely, barely loud enough for a normal person to hear him, but thanks to Steve’s enhanced hearing, it comes loud and clear.

Peter’s arms wrap around him tight, so tight that he nearly gets the breath knocked clean out of him, but he returns the embrace, confused until Peter whispers, “I think of you as a dad, too,” and all that Steve can possibly do is begin to cry—because what the hell else can he actually do?
“I think I’d be the surgeon, personally, seeing as I’m the one with the actual doctorates,” Tony argues, “But I digress.”
Steve’s not strong enough for the aftermath of it all, so he’d rather not try.
He blinks. He’s not sure when exactly he lost focus like that.
, just make it all end, because he’s just tired, he’s tired of his life just throwing shit at him, tired of this being his lot in life, having things taken and taken and taken when he’s done nothing more than try to do the right thing for other people.
Tony is gentle when he guides himself into the heat that is the inside of Steve, moving slowly into him despite the desire he’s barely suppressing to just plunge in one go; his hands pressing into Steve’s hips as his head rolls back in ecstasy. He’s sure his fingers are ripping into Steve’s skin, just as he’s sure the hands Steve’s probably not even fully aware he has on his ass are going to leave more bruises, but he minds neither as he bottoms out, fully seated within him and wanting to cry from the sheer magnitude of it all, dimly aware of the surprise he feels that he doesn’t immediately just lose it right then and there. He can’t help but feel sudden pride when he finds himself able to pull out almost all the way before snapping back in, his thrusts accentuated by Steve’s cries, because it’s
“So he could give it back to whom it really belonged. Steve, Glapieu is the good buy here, the bad guy, the one who manipulated everyone, it's Rousseline.”
Steve was attracted to Tony. And how could he not ? Tony was incredibly hot, everybody knew that. But he also was incredibly kind, generous, funny, and yes maybe sometimes he was a complete idiot, but he was such a good person. It took another week for Steve to fall in love with him.
When Tony got home, he realized something : he needed to reorganize his bookshelves. And build the one he bought the other day. It was only 5 pm so he buckled down to the task. He put his playlist on, playing the music on his speaker, and sat on the floor. One hour later, he admired his work : the bookshelf was built and standing next to the others : it looked beautiful. He then started to remove all the books of the shelves. He did this pretty often, but if he was honest, he loved it. There was something soothing about trying to find a way to organize his books. Trying to find where each book belonged. It always took him hours to do this, because he applied to this task with deep thought. Tony loved his books, loved the aesthetic of his shelves, so everything had to be perfect.
“It does. It changes a lot.”
“You won't go far in life with what ifs, Tones.”
. Steve came back with a small bag, the same he left the convention with.
“You can’t separate them ! They’d be sad !”
And he did. Not even one day later, he found one not too far away from his university and he could breathe again. He might have spent his day looking for it, might have missed classes for this, but Tony needed his books, thank you very much. But Tony was still somehow reasonable, and so he didn’t go to that bookstore until he was done with work for the day – which required a gigantic strength but he succeeded. More or less. Let’s say, he wasn’t on his best day to study for his classes.
“So, what do you want to do ?”
It was easy. He just wrote the truth.
He took his suit off, and found himself very close to Tony, who had taken off his suit too. They were close. So close. Too close. Tony wanted to kiss Steve so badly. But he couldn’t. Because they were friends. Just friends. Steve didn’t feel the same for him. Steve wasn’t in love with him. Right ?
“Alright. If you want to, we can do it.”
“I do. We have nothing better to do anyway. Come on, Tony,” Steve begged him, and he pouted. And Tony couldn’t do anything against this face.
“What if I want another Cap?”, he whispered.
“Alright. But I want to do the contest, see if we win. Please ? It’s in two hours.”
“Uh, yes, thank you.”
“Maybe,” Tony answered, and tilted his head up.
“What?”
From as far as he could remember, Steve had always been in love with Tony. Except maybe when they met, but even there, he could feel the tension between them. There was
“The people you are about to meet are... well they are the Avengers so don’t try anything. Act normal and let me do the talking.” Tony said and Peter nodded.
“I’ll let him go just please don’t do that.” Ironman said scared. Tony nodded and Ironman sighed defeated. Ironman opened the panel and Peter looked up horrified.
“Ned!” Peter said seeing Ned.
“Calm down Tony it’s okay.” Ironman said chuckling.
Peter was thrilled to work on his suit but being in the tower again scared him a bit. Peter calmed down a bit when working with Mr. Stark because it was different and weird Peter didn’t have to hide anything.
“You won’t be able to run the best you’ll get is a slow walk at most tonight.” Bruce said sadly.
“I didn’t know what to do! I lost you...” Jensen said sobbing.
Alternatively you know by now. This one isn’t as horrible as the other ones I promise
“No running away.” Tony said glaring at him and Peter just looked down at his feet feeling trapped again. They heard a knock on the door
“Look at you go. Wow, nice catch! 3000 pounds 40 miles an hour. It’s not easy, you got mad skills.” Tony said closing the video and walking towards him and Peter went past him just wanting to ignore him.
“It’s my fault really...” Ironman said feeling the same panic as Tony even though they were separated.
“S-sorry I just thought...” Tony trailed off realizing whatever he said would be insulting Peter’s intelligence and maturity.
“Get up”. Tony commanded and Peter got up sick and tired of this already.
“You know you may not be a threat but stop pretending to be a hero.” Steve said and Ironman growled the sound coming from Tony’s throat caused Steve to look at Tony questionably and Tony sighed. ‘Not yet’ Tony thought and Ironman backed down.
“So yeah I’m sorry for putting you to rest. I’m sorry for letting you go. I was doing you a favor.” Jensen said and Peter sighed looking down.
“Let’s do it.” Ironman said smiling and started working. Tony worked with him and they worked together perfectly.
“Good, Great.” Steve said in relief.
“It’s just me, Ironman.” Ironman said having no other answer for him.
“Let’s go.” Tony said and Peter followed Tony as he lead him lightly down the hall.
“Peter.” Tony said but Peter seemed to just freak out more.
“Geez Tony how many hertz are you shocking him with?” Bruce asked seeing Peter yelp in pain.
“He doesn’t deserve this.” Tony said angrily almost to tears too and Ironman looked at Tony worriedly.
“I’m human.” Peter said and Tony shocked him again making Peter almost yell out in pain again.
“Fine.” Jensen said accidentally leaving Peter’s collar behind. Peter turned to follow Jensen then he heard a whisper.
“Fine.” Ironman said glaring at Clint.
“I told them he was just an intern and ran away from home.” Bruce said and Peter looked at Bruce in betrayal. Bruce wasn’t going to help him he lied. Peter ran towards the door but got electrocuted before he could get there. Peter recoiled hard and panted heavily just wanting to get out of here. Tony walked over to him and attached the chain to his collar and chained him to the wall. Peter tried resisting but Tony shocked him again.
“Peter... What happened?” Bruce asked whispering. Peter looked to Bruce and then looked down sadly.
“Here you go.” The clerk said.
“Nice to meet you Tom.” Jensen said smiling and started walking towards his house and Peter followed him walking beside him.
“Fine Fine I’ll go.” Clint said not seeing Ironman in sight. Clint climbed back up into the vents and sighed sadly.
“You gonna call your body guard because you are gonna need him.” Steve threatened and Ironman nearly leapt out of Tony and strangled Steve.
“Don’t ever let me think you’re getting abused again!” Steve said and Tony shrugged.
“Hey guys.” Alex said entering the room.
“Really? Then show me.” Ironman said holding out his hand and Tony cried harder but merged with Ironman. Ironman looked for the memory and it wasn’t hard to find.
“I can’t lose you.” Mark said leaning over his bed and crying into Peter’s arm.
“Are you okay?” Steve asked and got off of him.
“Please wake up, Tom.” Mark said using his fake name and Peter twitched waking up slightly but his body wouldn’t let him and he heard a sob come from Mark.
“Yeah.” Tony said and looked at the video and Peter started to panic.
“Okay Peter.” Jared said holding the collar carefully making sure not to touch the inner part of the collar.
Tony stopped too and looked at Peter confused as to why he stopped then noticed the lines on the ground signifying where the invisible box was.
“What’s not fair?” Peter asked confused.
“Like it?” Jensen asked and Peter nodded.
“I’m sorry I couldn’t help you sooner if I only fought harder then maybe you wouldn’t... you wouldn’t have ended up like this.” Mark said sobbing again.
“Peter.” Tony said grabbing him and kissing him roughly.
“What? like you!? You abandoned him after just one visit!” Mark yelled angrily and Peter wanted to just wake up and yell at him.
“It’s in the past.” Peter said sighing.
“Right... I’m sorry...” Steve said awkwardly blushing. Steve then looked at Tony then remembered why he brought Tony here in the first place.
“He was the one always taunting me and running away he called me a freaking cat and he made me so angry!” Ironman yelled reminded of each fight he had with Spider-Man.
“I-it was just a lab accident.” Tony said nervously. Steve hugged him and Tony jerked back his ribs still hurting.
To be truthful Ironman was a little scared to go back out and show himself to the world the terrorist called him a freak and unnatural. They mocked him and beat him he only ever was kept alive because he was a part of Tony.
“You are correct Mr. Parker.” Tony said and Peter looked down blushing in embarrassment.
“Goodnight Alex.” Peter said as Alex stumbled back to his room. Peter stared at the wretched collar that was keeping him here. Peter waited till morning and wasn’t surprised to see Misha up bright and early.
“We will find a way to get that off you okay.” Mark said and Peter nodded feeling a tiny bit of hope. Peter then felt something in the collar poke into him and he looked at Mark panicked.
Peter found Mark and he was passed out in his bed. Who had his collar then? Peter looked around for Dimitri hoping he had it. Peter shook his head and rubbed his throat the pressure not going away and seemed to just get harder. Peter found Dimitri holding the collar running his hands all over it and Peter almost screamed out wanting him to stop.
“Welcome to the music room with our lovely friend Rob Benedict on guitar and his crew.” Mark said motioning to the group and Peter waved hi as they greeted him.
“Because you’re innocent you don’t deserve to be treated like this.” Steve said and Tony scoffed.
“It’s not your fault.” Peter said and really looked at Tony and didn’t see any of the mean angry person he was before. Tony was younger and nicer. Peter smiled at him and Tony finally looked up looking at Peter.
“You guys can talk things out I’ll be in the lab.” Tony said smiling and then leaving the room rushing to the lab.
“For school silly, did you forget!” May said and Peter eyes widened.
“Umm Mr. Stark who is that?”
“I hear you found Spider-Man?” A voice Peter didn’t recognize said and Peter tilted his head.
“Don’t touch me.” Tony said and glared at him. Ironman huffed giving Tony a face.
“No, Tony you don’t understand what he did!” Ironman yelled frustrated.
“Don’t ever call me that again.” Tony said angrily pushing him to the ground and kicking him in the ribs. Peter wondered if this was better or worse than what Tony was doing before and decided it was better... maybe.
Peter eventually found a weak link and broke it smiling. Now for the collar. Peter tried pulling the collar apart but that clearly wasn’t working so he tried the lock piece if he could just get the lock to fail he would be out. Peter started messing with the lock in a million different ways and still it wouldn’t budge. Hmm he needed something better.
“Not your fault Tony is crazy.” Peter said and tensed up expecting to be zapped scared Tony was listening. Peter sighed and relaxed after a moment of silence.
“How do we even know that was real though we were both drunk and it was just a day after we burned his body.” Jensen said freaked out and Jared sighed.
“It’s alright just tell me next time.” Peter said enjoying the look on Tony’s face. Tony nodded smiling and brought up the works for the AI he was making for Peter.
“No, I don’t think I ever will.” Peter said truthfully and Jensen wanted to break whoever hurt this precious soul.
“Don’t stop tell me more.” Tony said and Peter blushed embarrassed.
“Well he told us you just came out of an abuse relationship, you have nightmares, and that it was really bad.” Jared said hesitantly not trying to trigger him and Peter nodded closing in on himself.
“R-right...” Tony stuttered.
“Okay we are done for today you can rest for the rest of the night.” Tony said not making the weight move.
“He shocked me made me do whatever he wanted.” Peter said remembering all the times Tony shocked him.
“What What are you doing here?” Peter said trying to calm himself down.
Jensen stayed with him after he fell asleep to make sure he didn’t have another nightmare. Jensen left once he knew Peter was asleep and not having any nightmares and went back to his room with his wife.
“I love you Tom, Peter. I just...” Mark paused sobbing and Peter sighed mentally knowing this day would come.
Tony sighed relived that he remembered to wear his flame proof suit on. Tony wiped away his tears again trying to stop crying the pain getting too much for him. Tony calmed down enough that his eyes weren’t burning anymore and he sighed relieved.
“I’m Jared Padalecki nice to meet you Tom.” Peter nodded and then Misha stepped in.
“Please wake up.” Mark pleaded one last time and kissed Peter’s forehead and then stood up turning away to leave and was surprised to have Peter grab his hand stopping him from leaving.
“So Who are you?” Clint asked Ironman.
“I am Ironman.” Tony said after a few moments of silence.
“I won’t hurt you Tony.” Steve said and Tony lowered his hand blushing in embarrassment.
“I love you too Tony.” Ironman said smiling.
“I didn’t see any earpiece though.” Thor pointed out looking at the Avengers confused.
“I’m here Mark.” Peter said and Mark tried hugging him but he just went through him and Peter sighed sadly seeing Mark cry again. Eventually Misha came and picked Mark up bringing him home and Peter followed them and watched as Mark cried more. They had a funeral for Peter a hunter’s funeral salt and burned and Peter finally moved onto the afterlife.
“You are not getting away from me again, Peter.” Tony said and some of the cast who were on the ground injured and weak looked to Peter confused.
“What brings you to Canada?” Jensen asked and Peter sighed sadly.
The fight went pretty much the same in the movie Peter only fighting slightly better.
~~~Vents~~~
“Tony, let me go!” Peter said struggling under Tony’s hold and whimpered as Tony hit the button again.
“You will stop threatening us now?” Steve asked hesitantly.
Peter woke up hearing a knock at the door and opened his eyes looking around panicked before calming down as Jensen stepped in the room.
“Here it is this is perfect.” The clerk said placing the collar and Peter felt the material wrap around his throat. Peter rubbed as his throat the weird pressure not going away as the clerk brought the collar in the case back to Misha.
“You’re at the airport with the Avengers okay and we were fighting a huge guy.” Tony said slightly confused about the situation but hoped explaining it would bring Peter back and it thankfully did.
“I won’t be able to swing out tonight you mean?” Peter asked.
“Are you sure?” Natasha asked and Clint nodded and continued to pace.
“I mean you must be me and this is an alternate universe because this my Peter.” Tony motioned to Peter standing beside him.
“Hey kid.” Tony said and Peter backed up scared backing away from Tony disoriented.
“I am Ironman.” Tony said seriously.
“What’s the point you’re not real.” Jensen said miserably.
“I think you can come out now?” Tony said and Clint tried not to make any sound. After a bit of silence Tony spoke again.
“Oh.” Jensen said seeing his reaction and looked at him sadly.
“Well I can go tell him that you didn’t want him off the team and want him back.” Tony said smiling now.
“No problem I will always be here for you.” Steve said kissing him on the cheek and Tony blushed smiling.
“I won’t I’m sorry.” Clint said feeling scared of his friend in battle.
“How long did I hurt you?” Tony asked and Peter shook his head.
“Misha! He doesn’t like it when something touches the inside of the collar!” Jared said taking the collar out of the case and holding it close to his chest.
“Okay no more questioning Ironman about his identity.” Steve said and everyone nodded.
“Hey Mr. Stark.” Peter greeted and looked at the panicked Tony.
“Okay there’s this crazy car parked outside.” Peter said and then looked towards May and saw Tony sitting right beside her and Peter almost panicked backing up slightly.
“Yeah show us.” Sam said and Tony sighed. ‘Do you want to freak them all out it will be funny?’ Tony asked Ironman and Ironman gained some confidence chuckling softly. ‘Yeah let’s do it.’ Ironman said and Tony then dimmed the lights and shut off the light coming from the windows making it dark in the room but not as dark as it was before.
“But they don’t know I’m not normal... they think I’m some normal human.” Ironman said sadly.
“What?!” Tony said through the speakers in the room.
“Can I have a case for this.” Misha said to the clerk putting Peter’s collar down and Peter shivered as the clerk examined the collar getting its dimensions.
Peter then saw a hidden panel open up and saw a chain connected to a metal wall. Peter stopped in his tracks feeling dread creep up into his system and Tony pushed him inside Peter tried resisting but Tony shocked him again.
“We just want to know who wears the mask.” Steve said calmly and Tony nearly strangled him but held himself back.
“Okay I will go meet him when I can.” Tony said trying not to laugh and then let his eyes return to their normal state.
“Ironman it meant nothing! I’m sorry!” Tony screamed and smiled seeing the door unlock. Tony ran into the room and looked at Ironman sadly.
“Please don’t put the collar back on please!” Peter pleaded looking at Tony with fear.
“Leave him alone!” Tony said and Ironman shook his head.
“Hey Tony.” Steve greeted and Tony smiled Ironman sighing in happiness.
“It’s Uhh.” Peter said nervously breathing out trying to calm down.
“I- he put a shock collar on me, I couldn’t get it off... He beat me, I couldn’t fight him... he shocked me so many times. He wouldn’t get off me.” Peter said crying again and Jensen sighed sadly
“Aww this so sweet Wing head.” Tony whispered to himself as he finished reading the letter and held onto to it tightly, hugging it. Tony sighed putting the letter in a special drawer.
“Really?” Peter asked and Tony nodded and Peter nodded awkwardly.
“Kid you are scaring me do you need medical attention?” Tony asked getting more worried as Peter just lied there.
~~~~~
“Whatever.” Ironman said walking out of the training room.
“He let you go it’s time for you to let go” she said and Peter cried but nodded.
“Come on Spider.” Tony said impatiently tugging on the chain and Peter reluctantly followed.
“Alright.” Ironman said hugging Tony.
“I just needed a break from trying to catch up to your genius level.” Tony said looking at Peter fondly. Peter chuckled hiding his work away and then smiled at Tony.
“I miss you Peter.” Richard said then put down the collar and left. Peter wandered around the house looking for anyone but everyone was asleep. Peter sighed and went to his room. Peter tried sleeping but he didn’t really need sleep and he couldn’t really sleep at all so he just lied there on his bed staring at the ceiling.
“He beat me and shocked me whenever I tried to fight back.” Peter continued getting lost in the memories.
“y-you don’t have to do that.” Tony said.
“Why is he so determined to find out who Ironman is anyway?” Steve asked watching Clint walk away.
“no problem.” Jensen said and Peter ran as fast as he could towards the place Jensen gave him.
“Yeah thanks.” Peter said closing his eyes remembering all the different suits he made and the details. Peter shook his head opening his eyes and then putting his notebook away.
“Come on Peter, it’s not to late to enjoy this.” Tony said biting Tony in the neck and Peter yelled out in pain as Tony bit him and used his weight to hump him. Peter cried out of pain and helplessness.
“Are we going to let him in?” Tony asked and Ironman buried his head further into Tony’s neck.
“Tony just open your eyes.” Steve said calmly softening his grip slightly. Once Steve did Tony tried yanking his arm back but Steve tightened his grip again, making Tony hiss in pain as his arm was relentlessly tugged on.
“I hate myself.” Tony said again not looking at Peter.
“Whatever.” Steve said and kissed him. Tony kissed back after a second of shock and enjoyed it very much.
“Oh no.” Tony panicked slightly. Steve was asleep, Steve was kissing Tony in his sleep. Tony concluded quickly as Steve just brought Tony closer kissing his neck softly and Tony shivered blushing. Tony almost yelled out as Steve bit him thrusting up into Tony surprising him.
~~~the first time~~~
“No Tony isn’t making me do anything!” Ironman said growling at Clint and stepping towards him threateningly. ‘Ironman.’ Tony said not wanting him to attack Clint. ‘What?’ Ironman thought stepping away. ‘Calm down.’ Tony said softly. Ironman took a huge breath in and out and just glared at Clint.
“Tony it’s okay I can tell that you are nervous.” Pepper said as Ironman stood there his eyes darting around.
Tony over the time a few months continued to test him shocking him if he acted out and it was torture.
~~~back at the lab~~~
“I got to go.” Peter said and left going outside and running into an alley trying to calm down. Peter rubbed his throat where the collar previously was and tried to calm down repeatedly saying.
Tony was surprised when he heard someone knocking wanting into the lab.
“I think that was Ironman...” Natasha said guiltily. Sam freaked out and Clint shivered scared of Tony and whatever thing that came out of him.
“I’m still angry at all of you.” Tony said going back to being angry.
“I was but then I remembered you don’t know me that well and we don’t do that...” ‘anymore’ Peter whispered the last part hoping Tony didn’t hear.
“Yeah I know.” Peter said in understanding. Alex breathed out and noticed that it got colder in the room.
Peter pulled Tony’s hair making him let go then kicked Tony off of him making him crash through a table. Peter was quick to pull his pants back up and head to the vents to escape.
“I said leave it alone.” Jensen said snatching it and placing it down gently near his glass.
“Tony!” Peter said surprised pulling away only to realize he was backed up into a wall again. He couldn’t fight back against Tony he didn’t know yet he couldn’t defend himself and he started crying.
“Where am I?” Tony asked looking in the mirror thing again and still seeing the strange him there.
“He is not locked up.” Tony defended himself and Bruce got angry.
“You mean you made armor for a person you don’t even know? Steve told me Ironman said that you know who he is.” Natasha said taking a bite of her cereal.
“That’s kind of you.” Tony said surprised that Steve even cared.
“I’m sorry too.” Tony said hugging him.
“Are you going to lock me up again, shock me, make me do whatever you want...” Peter asked nervously crying too, scared.
“Here is some water as your reward.” Tony said throwing the water bottle at him and he caught it drinking it quickly glad to have water again.
“Rogers what a pleasant surprise. What are you doing here?” Tony asked pushing a button that hid the arc reactor in his chest then put his hand back in his pocket.
“Hey Steve.” Tony said.
“Thanks Pepper you really are the best.” Ironman said admiration in his voice.
“I remember and I keep having urges to do it again.” Tony said crying telling the whole truth and Peter looked at him sadly. Peter hesitantly approached Tony and Tony looked up at him still crying.
“Please wake up... you don’t even have the collar on anymore... so please. Please wake up Peter.” Mark said almost in tears and Peter wanted to wake up right then and there and rejoice that they actually got the collar off but something was stopping him, fear maybe but he felt trapped inside his head.
“Yeah it was just scary facing them without the helmet on and...” Ironman trailed off not knowing how to explain the feeling.
“You know he won’t be leaving might as well let him in.” Tony said and Ironman sighed letting Tony open the door. Ironman chuckled seeing Steve fall onto the floor. Steve got up and blushed embarrassed and then closed the door locking it as he stepped in.
“Oh Peter... I miss you so much.” Jensen said hugging Peter and Peter hugged back.
“Great, So now we definitely know that he’s here why hasn’t he done anything else to signify his presence?” Jensen asked and Jared sighed.
“You have to let him go.” Jensen said and Mark got angry.
“It’s alright. Tony will be fine, it’s just a meeting and if you are really worried just get that armor on and go protect him.” Pepper said hugging him and Ironman hugged back gratefully.
“It’s okay Peter.” Tony said kissing him softly and Peter just looked at him angrily and struggled to speak.
“Okay Peter give me your hand.” Tony said and Peter stood up hesitantly approaching Tony. Peter was still scared of Tony but now Tony could shock him whenever he wanted he would rather not pick another fight.
“Y-you know that- that is kinda Ironman’s job...” Tony pointed out and Steve huffed, angry at Ironman.
“I’m sorry...” Mark said crying and Peter wanted nothing more than to just wake up and comfort him.
“N-no.” Tony said hesitantly and nearly yelped as Steve grabbed him kissing him harder and rubbing himself against Tony. Tony blushed more feeling Steve’s shaft against his.
“Why are you so mad about Misha having your collar?” Jared asked confused. Jensen looked at Jared confused then looked to where he was looking and his eyes widened seeing Peter standing there.
“You weren’t going to wake up! If I didn’t tell Mark to give up you would still be in a coma and you would still be-.” Jensen cut himself off sobbing.
“I also brought you breakfast.” Tony said sliding over the tray of eggs and bacon. Peter rejoiced going to the tray and eating. Peter hadn’t eaten since yesterday morning so this food was amazing and quickly gone.
“That’s you right?” Tony said and Peter stared at the video of him swinging around.
“You are lucky that I remembered to have dinner.” Tony said and then placed the plate of scraps down in front of him. Peter ate slowly savoring the little amount of food he was given and Tony watched him. Peter shivered under Tony’s gaze and tried to ignore him.
“Shut up kid! I should have never brought you on this mission.” Tony said yelling at first but whispering the last part. Peter had unshed tears in his eyes and stomped back next to Robert and stayed behind him and hugged Tom for comfort. Tom hugged back trying to help the broken teenager. Tony scoffed and went through the portal without Peter.
“I-I’m s-sorry.” Tony said feeling ashamed. Peter chuckled quietly and smiled at Tony.
“I had two dads and they were so funny and they were the best. I had two uncles and uncle Mark took care of me the most while My dad’s were working. My other uncle he was really funny he used to wear this brown shaggy trench coat all the time and we would always joke about it. My friends were all so nice and they played music together and I even got to learn to play the guitar.” Peter said lost in his memories of the cast.
“Oh come on!” Ironman said and Tony heard a crash.
“Please give us another chance.” Tony and Ironman said feeling sad.
“I was so sure he would have been there.” Clint whispered angrily. Clint heard the voice of Tony.
“Can we at least talk?” Steve asked wanting to see Ironman and Tony again.
“Well kinda yeah they adopted me into their family and I became a part of it.” Peter said happily remembering all the good times he had with them.
“Oh.” Tony said surprised to see Steve and Tony got nervous knowing the wounds on his face were very visible.
“You said that I’m you. So if we are the same person then maybe we can be the same person just until I can get us into a private place again.” Tony said looking at Ironman hopefully.
“Wrong answer.” Tony said and started kissing Peter shocking Peter when he wanted at different levels trying to get the most out of Peter’s pain. Peter withered in pain and blushed as he took a tiny bit of joy as Tony kissed him roughly and grinding against him.
“Just tell me.” Peter said and Tony broke.
“I will have that back now.” Tony said taking the helmet from Steve.
“Okay fine.” Ironman said taking the armor off his eyes still glowing blue.
“Oh my gosh I’m so sorry I forgot!” Steve said getting up and getting out a first aid kit. Tony just watched Steve confused at first then blushed embarrassed.
“Why don’t you want anyone to touch the inside of the collar?” Jensen holding it normally, his hands wrapping around the inside of the collar letting it rest in his hand and Peter tried not to react as he felt Jensen’s fingers around his throat.
“Welcome to the cast of Supernatural.” A tall man said and Peter tilted his head confused.
“I said stop... tin can.” Peter said super scared but glared at Tony. Tony bit him in the neck again this time drawing blood and Peter yelled out in pain. Peter tried to pry Tony off but Tony’s grip was tight and Peter realized Tony wasn’t going to let go.
“Sorry guys I got to go apparently, talk about this later okay!” Tony said to the people he was having a meeting with as he was being dragged away.
“Come here.” Bruce instructed and Peter hesitantly got closer seeing no ill intention in Bruce’s eyes. Bruce grabbed his shoulder pulling him close and Peter stayed still a little afraid.
“We salt and burned his bones.” Jensen said too stubborn to think that the collar was keeping him here.
“Go.” Tony said and Peter ran. Peter ran as fast as he could imagining running away from Tony, away from this place, away from this torture. Peter slowed down getting tired after a while and Tony looked at him impressed.
“Right you might need help with that.” Tony said realizing something and got out scissors. Peter eyes widened and shivered in fear as Tony approached him scissors in hand.
“It was a really good prank though.” Steve said smiling and Natasha sighed smiling.
“Tony...” Steve said but after a tense silence let Tony go and Tony turned away covering his eyes with his hand just in case and running to his lab only peaking slightly so he knew where he was going. Tony put his lab on lockdown and sighed relived. Tony put on his sunglasses letting them cool his now burning eyes.
“This is your second life?” Tony asked and Peter nodded.
“Good boy.” Tony said and Peter huffed closing his eyes refusing to let Tony see that it got to him.
“W-What?” Peter said stuttering slightly under the stares of everyone.
He was Ironman and no one knew he didn’t let anyone know. Not the public not the Avengers, not even Pepper or Happy. The only person who knew he was Ironman was Rhodey.
“I just woke up and I’m putting it on the old way.” Ironman said still struggling.
“Vibranium shock collar.” Peter said glaring at Tony.
“What?” Steve asked puzzled.
“Thanks.” Peter said as he started walking down the street.
“Good.” Tony said and Peter looked away from him closing his eyes in frustration and embarrassment. Tony inspected his hand and Peter wanted to just pull away, but didn’t the feeling of the collar around his neck weighing down on him.
“The park?” Tony asked confused and then Ironman and Tony both realized that they were supposed to show up. Tony looked at him apologetically as Steve glared at them.
“Yeah I got a spare room and it looks like you need it. I’m Jensen by the way.” Jensen smiled and Peter smiled.
“Hey Peter.” Peter heard Mark say and Peter’s hand twitched.
“No tell me what happened to you.” Tony said pinning him against the wall and Peter cried.
“Thanks.” Peter said and stopped as Jensen stopped in front of his door and got the keys out.
“She really wanted to know who you were.” Tony said helping Ironman up.
~~~after Peter got hit by huge Lang~~~
“Yes sir.” JARVIS replied sounding worried about him.
“Okay.” Ironman said looking up at Tony.
“Who else knows? Anybody?” Tony asked and Peter shook his head.
“Alright.” Jared said and Peter smiled.
“Don’t use your blasters.” Steve said and Ironman nodded.
“He couldn’t take it anymore.” Peter said quietly remembering how Mark sobbed saying he was sorry for ending him.
“Peter’s spirit is connected to the collar.” Jared read out and sighed shaking his head.
“That’s why I came to hash it out.” Tony said and Peter closed his eyes and hiding his face in his hand.
“Earlier when you guys were talking did you kiss!” Ironman asked angrily.
“See you later Rogers.” Tony said as Steve walked out of the lab waving goodbye. Tony was quick to put the lab on lockdown and open the letter to see what it was.
“No that is not possible!” Natasha yelled and Tony chuckled.
“I knew it, you weren’t even paying attention!” Pepper said and Tony started to panic.
“I’m sorry.” Tony said and Ironman cried into his shoulder leaning against Tony too. Tony started crying too knowing the Avengers didn’t accept Ironman and probably never would.
“Yeah let’s say it is a thanks for all the times you saved me.” Tony said going back to the lab.
“Don’t touch it.” Tony said and Peter just looked at Tony confused and sad. Tony then took out a chain leash and Peter backed up afraid.
“That’s a complicated question.” Ironman said and Tony blushed feeling ashamed.
“You know I’m right.” Jensen said and Peter bit the inside of his cheek.
“It’s alright Mr. Stark.” Peter said and Tony sighed feeling a bit better.
“Y-you can hear me...” Mark said and Peter’s heartbeat went back to normal.
“Tony Why did Pepper kiss me?” Ironman asked and Tony felt dread.
“Don’t look at me like that.” Tony said starting to feel bad.
“What is it Banner?” Tony asked nonchalantly.
“Hey, listen to me you’re okay you’re safe.” Tony said hugging Ironman. Ironman hugged back crying now.
“You are probably wondering why Jensen, Jared, and Alexander haven’t visited in a while.” Mark said and Peter tried doing something to tell Mark he was listening.
“I even had an older brother! But I don’t think he liked me that much we never got along that well.” Peter said remembering how Alexander always looked at him coldly and pushed him around.
“Did I break you? I think I just broke Captain America... oh no what am I gonna tell the team? Um hey guys you know Steve Rogers well I broke him I’m sorry.” Tony rambled nervously.
“I’m sorry Ironman I thought that...” Pepper said starting to leave but Ironman caught her by the wrist.
“Leave Ironman alone.” Tony said threateningly.
“Are you okay?” Tony asked.
“W-where are we going?” Peter asked and Tony sighed.
“He did.” Peter said being vague. Tony frowned remembering the story Peter told him.
“Ugh.” Tony moaned in pain as they crash landed in the sand.
“don’t come in!” Tony yelled and shocked Peter again.
“I was going to draw Ironman but it kinda turned into you and I just, thought you would be a good reference since the armor seems to fit on you and then I-.”
“What’s up?” Tony asked as Steve walked in.
~~~~~~
“He just has trust issues.” Natasha said fiddling with her knife.
“I will get you out, eventually Peter.” Bruce said trying to reassure him.
“No more questions!” Tony said taking over the body and Clint backed up freaked out by the sudden change.
“Hey! Stay away from my kid!” Robert yelled blocking Tony’s path and bringing Tom behind him protectively. Tom was flustered and peeked at Tony from behind Robert.
“Jared is to broken up about it he says it’s too painful to see you.” Mark said sounding angry at Jared and Peter sighed mentally yeah whatever that meant.
“Yeah.” Peter said and Tony stopped him.
“Me!” Tony responded finishing up.
“Guys it’s me I’m really here!” Peter said but Jensen and Jared didn’t seem to hear him. Peter felt a hand brush against his throat and Peter shivered falling to one knee.
“What are you doing here because I definitely did not apply for your.” Peter said as they stepped into his room and Tony closed the door behind them.
“Let me try something.” Ironman said and Tony nodded. Ironman focused really hard.
“Oh! Ummm well I never actually seen your eyes before and I just kinda did it...” Steve said blushing.
“It’s okay Mark I understand.” Peter said and put his a comforting hand on Mark’s shoulder but knew he couldn’t feel it.
“Tony!” Steve said looking at Tony worriedly.
“Are you okay?” Peter asked and Tony glared at him still trying to catch his breath.
“No I won’t shock you.” Tony said and Peter sighed.
“You can do this.” Tony said confidently and Ironman nodded closing his eyes trying to imagine what it was like when he had his own body and Tony helped him. Ironman felt himself separate from Tony and Ironman smiled.
“Stop it Dimitri!” Peter yelled in agony and embarrassment. Misha didn’t seem to hear him though as Misha fiddled with the collar making Peter wither in pleasure and embarrassment.
