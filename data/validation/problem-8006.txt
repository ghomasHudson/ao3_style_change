"Fury would."
"A good thing that you can teleport yourself in then, every morning," the Doc grinned.
Except when some mildly irritating sorcerer-wannabe appeared, and Loki wasn't expecting Midgard to even have that level of understanding of magic, so he was caught in a trap.
Which timeline are we in, you might ask? This is a complete AU.
“I’m fine,” Tony muttered.
“What do you mean? They need to be checked if they are healthy...”
"That's my point exactly," Barnes told them. "You both deny it so fiercely, it's a torture to watch."
Actually, Tony didn't explain anything he worked on before into this detail to anyone except maybe Rhodes once when he asked, but Barnes was a tech-enthusiast (he even mentioned going to an expo just to see Howard's inventions when Tony was tinkering with his arm before), and was a very good listener in a sense that he never tried to talk over him.
"And also joined a Fight Club or something?"
“Like you’d want that,” Tony huffed because it was one thing for Steve to take pity on him while he was dying, but bonding was serious. Omegas and Alphas could live five times longer than Betas when bonded. “I’m just a useless Omega who-“
"A month," Bruce told him. "And I've heard the Grandmaster saying that it's getting boring. He's planning on putting us against that witch any day now."
"Only for a visit. Some people would like to see you. I promised to try to persuade you on their behalf."
“Don’t ever say that,” Steve’s expression quickly changed. “You’re intelligent, strong, and funny. Not to mention, incredibly hot.”
By then, Tony knew too much, and if he was expandable, he feared Schmidt would just kill him, so he tried to play along while not giving in, but had panic attacks now almost every other day, even if he was safe - for now. He knew it would never last.
"Are you sure you should be wasting your magic like this? Just a couple of days ago, you were dying..." and he looked slightly concerned as well.
"If you mean it, put your money where your mouth is. Because quite frankly, at this moment, I can't even picture you and me together."
"Don't talk to him, sweetie, he's clearly a very confused man," Strange told Jade, pulling her back, and giving Stark a very dark look. "We're going home."
"You told us she wasn't," Cap pushed. "Twice."
Steve was about to say something when Tony kissed him right there and then, paying no mind to who saw.
Title is part of a song (You and Me by Lifehouse). Thank you for reading!
"Do...?"
"You wanna see how much I mean it too?" Tony could only grin.
“Pep said we’re doing better now than just a few months ago,” he told Steve one day. “So would you finally train me? I know we’ve talked about it only in passing like a year ago, but I simply didn’t have the time then.”
So he kissed Bucky as a test first, but when he was also positively surprised by the Midgardian's reaction, he noted.
"I already had changed the color scheme to a more minimalist approach, so if you leave it for the night, JARVIS could take care of it for you."
"I mean it wouldn't be smart," Loki tried to self-correct.
"Imagine what he could do if he'd seen a couple of things we can do," Strange seemed to be in a good mood for the first time since Tony had met him, talking to the other wizard. "Maybe that's why the spell worked out this way."
"Go ahead," Steve saw how excited Tony was.
"But I can help," she offered, when Strange opened a portal and was about to lead her through it.
Loki had found out he also had claws, sharp teeth, and could still hiss at the Captain who seemed to be so full of himself now, but that didn't last.
"Why, what did Nebula bet?"
"Who?" Phil now misses the context entirely, and not just because he isn't paying attention.
He was about to reach for the girl who was indeed standing on the very ledge almost too carelessly, probably just to protect her. But Loki - knowing full well who she was - couldn't help but step between them, almost snarling.
He had a billionaire genius philanthropist to woo.
John had looked offended when he'd told him so, frowning as Teyla choked on her juice. Thankfully, he didn't know exactly was a frakhorn was and why getting its tail cut off was so hilarious but he'd been distracted by Rodney thumping his tray down on the table, snagging all their attention with some crazy close call he'd just skillfully diverted. Teyla had traded a catty look with Ronon and he gave her a quick grin. No one would ever explain it to Shepard if they could help it.
The cozy Bed and Breakfast  was warmth and welcoming and he had a wonderful lunch and spent most of his afternoon dozing in front of the fire place in the common area. By late afternoon the mist had crept into town and was curling it's way along the outer buildings.
Stiles quirked his head. “So what… you got echolocation like some kind of bat?”
'Well, listen to your so called gut on your own time, you hear me." Gibbs scoffed. "When you are on work you do as I say."
The Hales live. And they are a bunch of dicks. Nogitsune Stiles.
"Scott texted Isaac about ditching you. He was upset about for all of three minutes."
Talia slaps a hand down on her red faced daughter's shoulder and slowly yanked her back to stand among the other wolves. Laura gave her mother and alpha a betrayed look but stayed silent and glowering, Peter's clawed hand taking the place of the alpha's and keeping the woman in place. The rest of the wolves tittered in the back but Stiles paid them no mind. Heather would be keeping a sharp eye on them.
Maybe he'd settle on earth one day. Maybe he'd go to mars or beyond. Maybe he'd be one of those men who lived and died in the open blackness, not tethered to anything but his ship and his wanderlust.
She panted as she dumped most of the weed into the drainage tunnel off the canal, making sure to stuff some into her pockets and on the shoes, squeezing the oil into the crushed burgundy velvet and matching hat. All that running made it harder to climb the trellis but she made good time, stripping and stuffing the outfit to the back of the closet and shoving the bloody shiv behind the toilet tank.
Stiles barked a sharp laugh. "Well, Pinky. Tomorrow were going to throw Scotty to the proverbial wolves. I'm talking Lydia, Erica and Allison. Scotty responds better to female authority and he needs to get his head out of his ass ASAP if he wants to be part of his pack."
“We’ve never had a lightsider hostage before.” The blond was saying, “It took us a while to figure out what to do with you. Some of wanted to execute you on sight. Some wanted to torture you for information. In the end I decided that you are worth much more to us as a bargaining tool.”
“I’d never seen a Legionnaire up close before” a voice came from behind him and Anthony froze. The voice was deep, reverberating through the air and sending a shiver down his spine. “I’m torn between being terrified and intrigued. They’d always been like the boogie man to us. Spectres of heat and light ready to snatch naughty children out of their beds.”
"Mr. Stark, he might be completely nuts, but I don't think he's lying and we could use the help."
"Not to be rude, but I didn't even know you were still here."
"It's only recently gotten worse, so... and you already know Bucky is my best friend, so I expect you'd like her, she's at least funnier than him..."
Especially if Tony now even forgot about his bet-money for a while, it seemed.
"I was talking about the planet as a whole, not you. Just before you go ahead and get the wrong impression..."
"I am, but it seems it doesn't matter anyway," Bucky was the only one not yelling, but that didn't mean he was any better, making Steve look at him with deep concern.
Famous last words. Rhodey - when he indeed couldn't remove the "art"- made Tony switch quarters with him. Only, Tony couldn't remove his monstrous creation either, so had to paint over it.
"What can I do, you bring the best out of me,
He was so preoccupied with that inner turmoil that he barely noticed the Shell-man and the Spiderling creeping up on him. It was only his luck it was a clone they had found first.
"Are you quite finished?" the Doc just gave him a look. "I meant that if you would have tried to do that yesterday, you would have figured how you can't even hold up a razor just right, so how are you planning on building anything?"
It was dangerous. But also… Tony began to hope that the future maybe not as glum as before. Maybe?
"So, what do you think?"
"That's why we're best pals," Tony smiled, and the foreign AI chirped in.
He managed to get home somehow, and even skipped days trying to recover, but while his body healed, his walkman - the only thing he owned beside a couple of comics - was also cracked, and he couldn’t replace it.
"It could be a fluke."
"I have to talk to someone," Strange wasn't listening.
So Tony grew up resenting the man, but he was still baffled when at age 28, he got a heart attack, and the doctors told him he needed less stress, a regular sleeping and exercising schedule, and a much better diet.
"For the first time?" Loki wondered grinning, but then Steve made good on his promise, making him not only come but laugh once he heard what the catchphrase was.
"No," Bucky declared again, and with such finality too, that Loki hated it.
"Of course you do," Tony could laugh because Rhodey was always more organized than him.
"The 'I ran into a door' was never a valid excuse, but doing that for what it seems like 20 times isn't any better."
"Maybe. But only to brag about it later. Me a lowly human, getting to a god-"
"We need to talk," Tony told him. "There's something I want to tell you. A couple of things."
"You tell me," Strange shrugged. "This is all your fault, you know. Wong and I could somewhat manage her when she was asking about her mother, but that was before you showed. Now even if we managed to get out, she'll never stop-"
It was probably the nicest thing she'd ever said to him, so Quill felt bad for correcting her.
"I guess I did."
Hulk appeared later in his room, only in a pair of pants, which he quickly shredded next.
"No, it's just that it would be weird. Anyone walking in here, finding a giant snake in my bed..."
"It's funny, because even being completely out of it, he was right," Nebula smelled the liquid Rocket was drinking, then put it away.
close."
"So I figured. If he's already doing everything in his power to make us miserable, he can't make us even more miserable, right? Might as well spend some time with the people we like, no, Groot?"
"I don't know."
"Thank you," Steve says, but when Phil tries to leave, he also reaches out for him, to stop him. "And I'm sorry."
"As I was, in a way, to you,
"Peter knows how to take a good shot, and he's been known to photograph moving subjects exceptionally well, so he has my full confidence."
"What are you doing?"
And he was right not to, so Loki could only internally sigh. Not only would he have to kill Ebony himself, and try to avoid Thanos' suspicions about it later when he already had like 4 Stones, he'd also have to knock out Ironman and his underling first - without seriously hurting them or making too much noise. Right.
"A very real kitten. Of course, when Loki transforms himself, he gives himself all the majestic animals like this snake he once turned into, and when I went to pick him up-"
"I'm no longer a Captain. In a certain sense, I never really was. And it's not a competition," Steve tried to tell him. "And I've lost my way too. I had to become like this to remember."
"You know, I used to hold Steve like this before the serum if he was about to have an attack. Of course, that's not mentioned in the Smithsonian archives, since he's the Great Captain America, and I'm just one of many he saved."
will only slow me down."
And when Steve put his mind into something, his concentration never ebbed, so only in a couple of days, Bucky almost couldn't remember what it was like not dating him.
“The pain isn't so bad now,” Tony told him. “Just don’t stop. You want to take my mind off things? It was working.”
"If he was, I wouldn't be able to transform into him, he would have gone with you at the swap."
"You wouldn't be there to discuss it."
Thor even let Hulk pat him after, and decided that if it was up to him to adopt an Avenger in a non-human form, he'd take the Hulk any day first.
"Let me rephrase. I didn't think I could or would have a shot at that kind of connection after I became Sorcerer Supreme. But now I'm retired and you annoy me the least of all the people I've ever met."
"Groot!" Gamora yelled for Groot, who just waved happily at Quill from through the limo's open roof when he heard. "Did you ever date Rocket? Or are you planning to?"
"It's not!"
Steve decided he won't stand down so easily, regardless.
He expected Strange to spiral into a fit of rage hearing that, and he was secretly looking forward to it, but his words had an opposite effect. The Doctor dropped his drawn shoulders and sighed.
They managed to not only bring back everyone but to genetically (and safely!) give magic to ordinary people with a new type of Serum that only unlocked the hidden potential.
"A victim, hell no, but you have no idea what it's like," Tony was dangerously wobbly, and when he wanted to get closer to Pepper, and almost fell to his face, Steve was ready to not only catch him but drag him out of the room by force if he had to, only, Bucky got there first.
"But... you
"Many Midgardian people would though."
So, it still could be much worse. That itself maybe wasn't a comfort, just a fact, but something to give him the will to go through one day, and then the next, always concentrating on the just one, but starting again the next day, on repeat.
problem?"
"Unhand me, Barnes, now!"
"It would be troublesome," Steve teased him. "If I acted like this with everyone, and they had the same reaction as you."
"No, not really, but I could tell you after I made you come for the first time."
"Please, Captain, I really would like to not starve to death," he gave in, requesting food nicely. "So if you could be so kind..."
While Loki got some of Bucky's worst memories, Barnes seemed to have anticipated this, and not only stabbed Loki while he had to get close to Bucky to connect to his mind, but used a cursed object to do it.
"I thought the interviews were over."
Vision couldn't find his place after the Snap.
"It was hardly sneaking when the bed gave out."
Walking through Bruce the simplest steps of magic while justifying it was supposed to be a pain, but surprisingly, it wasn't.
"That's another question I didn't need to be answered, but now I know," Tony only said. "
"But other than that, yes. I'll also give you advice on how to manage your social media accounts one on one, for instance, so please don't be surprised if I ask you to stay after practice for a 15-20 minute chat."
Except, when he woke, he was shaken awake by a very angry Hulk, and they were both naked in the same bed, and Thor wasn't just a treasured pet anymore, but himself.
“But if you’re finished with Jarvis, what are you doing now?” Steve asked.
"No, no, no, NO!!! Friday, don't you dare do this, or I'll... she fucking did it. I must be dreaming. THIS IS my worst nightmare. I thought it was an alien invasion, but no, we've been there, piece of cake, really, but this!" Tony stared at the lifeless phone in his hands, trying his StarkWatch next, that didn't seem to respond to him either.
“We can’t decide destiny.”
"I have no intention of dating your woman, Stark-"
"But we can't know how much better you'd do-"
"Also, demanding and way too controlling fathers are often linked - amongst other reasons of course - to some form of repression," Friday added, if that was any news.
OSP hadn’t visited Obadiah for more than a decade, he was untouchable. He had pad off the head of OSP with Tony himself and made a recording of the night, so if anyone ever suggested that Obi was mistreating him, the OSP would going down along with Obi - but nobody ever even tried.
"Ronan, let him go," Rocket, for his credit, was trying to stop him - this time at least. "I've told you he wasn't worth it."
It was the best end of the world, and Loki has already witnessed the end of two worlds, but he guessed any number of them could come, and he'd hardly change his opinion about it.
Tony was working on a suit that wasn't only composed of nanotech but could also reflect the light in a way that would render him invisible to the naked eye for days. A magic trick, not expecting he'd turn into a wizard overnight for real.
"Oh, you're going to kill me? Just so I can't tell your boyfriend that-"
"But something is not going well." Bucky stated it with such confidence that Tony first thought Barnes understood more of technology than he originally thought, but the soldier was looking at him, not the code, the screens, or the simulation.
"You see, Cap, I shouldn't be enabled," Tony only repeated with sarcasm. "So stop fighting my battles for me, and let them do whatever the hell they want. One more nail in my coffin won't make any difference anyway!"
"So, no matter what I say, you're leaving?" the Captain figured.
"Was that a request?"
“No. I just want to go back to your place.”
"As nice as this has been," Loki sarcastically motioned between them. "I think I'm going to have to leave."
"And what's that?" Coulson can't help but wonder.
"It's such a fine weather today, lovely for a walk, don't you agree?" Tony could have nailed the posh British accent accompanying his words better, but what the hell.
Coulson panics then a little, because while Peter is great, he isn't exactly the one to keep a secret, and although Steve isn't closeted, he isn't technically out either, so...
"The last time I saw him, his synthetic body was just fine. He only deleted his memory banks, but I suspect they could be retrieved."
"How so?" Steve humored her by asking.
in the background that otherwise kept buzzing in his mind.
"No, NO! It sounds great," Quill assured him, and left with the car, but was still suspicious even when the late dinner was over, and he took Rocket back with the car.
"I didn't order you to fall in love with a mindless creature, but should have seen it coming," Odin barked. "After all, you're so self-obsessed, you don't even have the capacity to care for real a partner."
"And how is that working out for you?"
Most of his bruises were gone, but his broken bones still needed days to heal, and the wound he got when he shielded the Captain must have gotten infected because the pain was almost blinding, and he was weak, disorientated, and running a temperature. Not to mention, his magic was still stretched, struggling to tend to all the wounds.
Talia looked like she'd just eaten something both slimy and bitter and his lips twitched behind his mask. She took a few seconds to slow her breathing, he could actually hear her teeth grinding from across the clearing.
The ride was a short one, her back aching from the laid back slump she'd been forced to mimic. She'd passed through enough of the town for the car to be seen, recognized and remembered so she made her way to her final destination.
She slipped out of the house and into the garage, thumbing the door opener as she slid into his convertible and raised the roof. The windows were tinted dark and she grabbed his shades from the sun visor and slipped them one.
“My spies are being discovered far too soon for them for them to provide suitable data.” Rhodes growled, “Those penumbra scoundrels may just have some luck on their side. They are getting better at slipping away from our grasp. It doesn’t make sense. They’ve always been a rag tag group, hardly able to come together enough for a decent skirmish. It makes no sense for them to be so…”
“You think you can handle both? It’ll be you and me ‘till the end. Maybe even beyond that. I won’t let you go I said.”
The blond had thanked them both voraciously that night when everyone else had gone home, almost breaking the new bed they'd all bought and helped put together the day before.
She sat on her bed, naked and damp from the shower, knee pulled up as she carefully painted her nails. The polish was borrowed, a holo silver aptly named unicorn blood and it gleamed as she wiggled her toes.
"No" Candy shrieked once more. "If the little bitch wants to wait until we've come all this way to chicken out in the end then fucking leave him. He can walk the fuck back."
He gestured with his hands, eyes growing bright as he continued to speak. “Of course I’m going to have to test this stuff out so I’m going to need Bucky’s help and any other vets you know to come help me out. It won’t be free of course.”
He quickly checked the clothes that hung above and found a long, heavy jacket covered with the tiny things as if someone had been rolling in them. He took a picture of the jacket with his phone, bright light still turned on as it caused the miniscule shells to glisten.
Tony Dinozzo follows his gut on a case and finds more than he even imagined.
Shikamaru sighed at the sky and frowned. "I think that Naruto is finally coming back."
“Organized. They’ve found a leader.” Anthony finished, quirking his eyebrow barely.
"Jesus." Ewan face palmed. "Look, let's all just get out of here before we become the next Blair Witch Project or something. Even the townsfolk are creeped out by this place."
“Why isn’t it allowed? Tell me.” The blonde growled, reaching up to grasp the brunet’s arms. “Tell me why we can’t be together. We’re soul mated. Soul fated.”
The brunet arched, body shuddering as the vamp held him close; legs going weak as Spike drank deeply. The bite marks stung as the vamp finally pulled away but that was soon soothed as the blond licked at them gently.
Derek was facing him, his eyes floating just over Stiles’ shoulder. His kaleidoscope eyes were dilated, his pupils blown wide and milky white. Stiles felt a sharp pang of heartbreak once more, knowing that those beautiful eyes would never meet his again. Never give him those looks that were a mix between irritation and fond exasperation.
Luckily for her, he had a sheriff shaped conscience who repeated the mantra "Murder is too much godamned paperwork, kid"  whenever the blood lust surged strong and heady, filling his throat with that cloyingly iron taste and making his black claws lengthen and curl.
Rodney sank to his knees and extended his hand towards his mate and lover. When Ronon was kneeling before him, he pressed a series of buttons on his tablet and the ship around them flickered and disappeared. Rodney's calming hand stopped Ronon from flinching too hard.
“I’ve often wondered what it would be like to come after you. Your reputation precedes you.” The hunter bit his lip, shifting his hips. “But then again so does mine.”
He looked back at the two Shield Agents as the phone in his pocket chimed a specific pattern. He gave them a placid smile.
She stopped herself from running a hand over her shaved head, the blonde buzz cut so different from the curls she'd once sported. She would grow them back eventually but they'd shaved her bald during recovery and she'd kept it short for convenience since then. She'd been too busy learning to walk and fight again after losing an arm and most of her leg.
She nodded at the closed door. "Kay." then let herself out through the front.
This time they did go down and Stiles hissed at his best friend as they picked up his father's body once more.
"You looking for trouble Talia?" he taunted her. "You ready to take on a child of the Nogitsune once more? How long did it take for your wounds to heal the last time, huh? Two whole months, right? Maybe this time I can make them permanent. How does that sound? I certainly look forward to the challenge of carving my initials into your forehead."
Later he would find the flowers and sweets shifted around into a much more pleasing pattern and some of Wufei's bright highlighters and colourful sticky notes tucked it among the arrangement. There was a space left empty for the lava lamp that had been promised and all the cushions on the couch had been lined up perfectly.
The Unlit Mountains loomed in the dark horizon, the bright warmth of the Citadel falling further and further away as each second ticked by. Lush fields of green and crystal blue lakes gave way arid and rocky land, the clear azure skies clouding over and turning dark.
Tony hummed and looked out of his picture window at the city skyline beyond. There was so much that he could sat to that, so many smart comments and sarcastic comebacks. But he was so tired of the bullshit. So tired of keeping everything in sight and juggling all these knives and burning torches. Just one mistake. One slip of the hand or concentration and he would be in for a world of pain.
These dark dwellers would get nothing from him. Only a fiery death when Rhodes brought an unstoppable wave of Legion to either bring him home or avenge his death. Either way, he would tell the rebels nothing. He would give them nothing. He would not be a weakness to the safety of the citadel.
“A younger target… wait. You write YA fiction?” he bounced in his seat. “Oh my god… which one is it? No wait .... let me guess.”
He rolled them over, laying his mate gently unto the piled furs as he continued to rock into him, swallowing the soft sighs and whimpers that fell from his lover's lips. Maybe one day Rodney would allow Ronon to pup him. They were sure to make beautiful, smart and strong babies.
He sprawled bonelessly against the sheets as Steve eased out of him, gasping, bereft at the empty feeling. He clenched his ass weakly, whimpering as Steve left his side only for a moment. The blond soon returned, speaking soft words of comfort as he wiped Tony down with a warm cloth.
“Just put them on if you don’t want to be a blind wolf.” He grouched, feeling Derek’s glare on the side of his face. He smirked openly when the werewolf growled and put them on, knocking the man’s shoulder with his own and keeping it there, settling against the alpha comfortably.
Poor Tony needs some fluffy goodness and who better than the King. pre-slash if you squint.
"I claim you. Mendoshu. " he said softly against the flame coloured fur.
Aaron Hotchner had a reputation that proceeded him far and wide. His unsmiling visage was more often the last thing traitors and other trouble makers saw before being granted the relief that death finally brought.
The last year had been hectic with him being away on missions for ten months out of twelve, coming back to his rooms at the Inuzuka Compound to eat his weight in his mother's cooking and sleep for a week before Tsunade sent him out for another mob outside of Kohona's walls.
Luckily or unluckily so, he'd come across the little crooked house with its little crooked fence and overgrown garden. With its seven cats of various colours and temperaments. With its bundles of dried herbs and flowers and giant clay pots of mysterious preserves.
Finding out that the bubbly, quirky Domme was Terzu Famiglia to Hotchner's Primu, next in command after Rossi's Sicondu, had been an unpleasant surprise. Finding out he'd been summoned before the man known as the Devil of South Shore had been even more of one.
“No one gives a fuck about vets these days. His HMO won’t cover a prosthetic. The VA gave this shitty plastic thing which hurts his arm all the fucking time. And he doesn’t even complain. He just grins and bears it because he’s the strong one you know? Even when he can’t keep down a job and we both have to live on his benefits and my shitty part time. Even when we had to go hungry for days in order to raise the money for this chance. He’s always been the strong one. Ever since we was kids….”
Stiles had hit speed dial in a flash, growling as he got sent to voicemail. When Scott did pick up, the noise in the background was too loud too appreciate Stiles' acerbic tongue lashing.
His mind raced even as the Advisor returned to their previous droning, his armored fingers tapping softly against the heavy armrest. Finally, the war council dispersed and he was left alone with his general.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
"Holy shit. Flores!" Ace Levy blurted loudly, echoing through the hanger. "What the fuck are you doing here? I thought to died or something."
Tony looked towards the voice and saw a charcoal grey coat being handed to him. His eyes traveled up the arm to meet Dwayne 'King' Pride's concerned gaze.
They didn't give any time to recover as the demon fox's ki made the blond's recovery time incredibly short. With Shika's cool hand on his hip and a soft press of a kiss against his sweat slick shoulder, Kiba slid into Naruto's tight, wet heat with a broken groan. Thick corded legs came up around his waist as he pressed in to the hilt, that perfect ass quivering around his length. Kami, he'd missed this so keenly. He snapped his hips forward ruthlessly, grunting deeply as he worked his cock into that mind stealing heat.
He looked down at the thin black tie crumpled in his fist.
Aunt May came in and guided her from the room to where Ned was sitting, his normally jovial face pale and worried. She let her adopted Aunt guide her to the seat next to him and sat on her other side. It was a cold comfort because Peter was always the one who knew just what to say so bring her spirits up.
Then of course there was Potter with his new Dragon Moth, which  despite being one of the most powerful breeds ever and a formidable fighter, much like the dragon it was named for; looked incredibly dull and ugly with its muted colours and bulky form.
The remaining legionnaire proved stubborn, refusing to leave his side. It was too damaged to lift him out over the mountains to escape and didn’t have enough power to connect to the hive mind.
Rodney tried to sound out the words with a tilt to his head. "Dye Nah Nuh woo…? Is that Setedan?"
"Solo's at peace." Wufei fumbled with the sudden latin. "Uh, ok. Duo. I'm Chang Wufei. Um, pleased to meet you."
Jake made a face and opened the door, Ewan pushing down the seat and tumbling out  unto the leaf covered ground in his haste. He stood, dusting himself off, not sure exactly what he was doing but sure that it was the right thing to do.
It took a while for him to come back to himself, wiping at his soggy face with the sleeve of his hoodie. When he felt put together enough, he looked up into the face of a dark and handsome stranger.
He threw the empty bottle unto the grass, hearing it clink against another. The forest was quiet around him and he could hear the blood rushing in his hears. The show would be starting soon. The very comet that had threatened to destroy them all would be passing overhead in a few minutes and he had one of the best seats in the house.
Xander looked around to see Spike leaning against the door frame and ran his fingers though his brown curls.
“They will not pay ransom for me. Nor spare your lives for my sake.”
His father had caught him one day, pausing in the doorway of the kitchen while Stiles happily made dinner. The younger man had flushed at being caught, shrugging and saying.
Ronon knew a lot of gate address by heart. He'd had to as a runner. He'd had to know which planets he could seek shelter on, which planets to lose his wraith pursuers on, which ones to find food on.
Kiba growled into his kiss, his arms going tight around his returned lover; reveling in the taste of his mouth, the feel of his sun warmed and sweaty skin, the soft silk of his blonde hair. Naruto giggled into the kiss, licking into his mouth and running his tongue against the dog ninja's sharp incisors.
With nothing else to build on, he'd ended up calling the Dinozzo network, contacting fellow investigators Greg Sanders in Las Vegas and Danny Messer in New York. He sent them the pics from his phone they both recommended that he seek out an entomologist.  Greg sent him some papers by the legendary Dr. Gil Grissom while Danny  provided a contact at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History.
Still, he was more than his armor. He was more than a metal suit marked with the gold of Sol’s blessing and red for the life’s blood of the Kings that came before him. He was his vast intellect and his skilled hands. He was the courage in his heart and the determination to finish the task he’d started. He was the Iron King and he still had a duty to his people. Armor or not.
Steve gaped, stupefied. “What…. I don’t understand.”
Thankfully, another of the wolf pups, Erica, had been smart enough to yank her away into the ladies' room and away from Stiles' path. At least one or two of the wolves seemed to have a good head on their shoulders. he'd often thought that Reyes would make a good fox but she'd been offered the bite first from Talia at Cora's behest.
That was when the bottom fell out of Anthony’s world.
Stiles scowled at his phone. He couldn't believe that Scott had bailed on him… again. He'd been planning this for months, scraping together the costumes, props and courage to even pull off this epic Halloween.
i love me some Erik Killmonger/Tony Stark though mostly AU because it's tricky in canon. they make such a cute couple though.
He didn't mind, the sweet tech of his suit wasn't enough to deal with the blazing heat of the flames and he'd already sustained a couple of burns before the local fire chief had ordered him away from ground zero. The friendly neighbourhood hero had saluted the brave fire fighters in their heavy gear and had high tailed it out of there, almost falling off a building when his webbing got too close to the heat.
Ronon had nodded, smiling as Rodney trailed gently fingertips across his naked chest before slipping the digits into his mouth with a moan of pleasure. He wanted to pull the scientist to him so badly, to direct that talented mouth to his own. He would then guide Rodney gently to his nipples, which were already hardening, then further down.
Ronon pressed his lips to Mckay's shoulder, tasting the salt of the sea and the faint tang of sun screen. "I hang with marine's all day. I pick up stuff."
A sob tore its way from his throat and he curled on himself over the rail. His hands were covered in dark smears and bleeding from time cuts where he'd all but dragged the last of the heavy sleighs to the edge of the water. He knew that his face looked the same, his white blond hair dark with sweat and slicked to his skull.
He was young, younger that Aaron had expected, with brown hair slicked back and curling around his shoulders. The dove grey and bone cream bespoke suit spoke to his expertise in his draft; his matching shoes and understated jewelry spoke to his good taste.
Fuck his life.
What he was interested in was finding a place so close to campus that only took up about half his rent allowance. It was on the first floor of a six apartment complex with a small yard and pool, thirty feet from a bus top and a fifteen minute bicycle ride from the university. He used the money he saved to buy a used but sturdy bicycle with a basket on the back for his books and a heavy riding coat for cold weather.
When he'd lost his whole world and been made a runner, he never thought that he would have that kind of love again. But Rodney Mckay was a man full of surprises and he'd shouldered his way into Ronon's heart in that tactless yet endearing way of his.
Derek stilled then turned his head towards where Stiles was sitting. “In all that matters, yes.”
Outside, the rain poured on.
"Oh shit." Ewan hissed, backing up a few steps.
"Before we discuss the hows and whys of me losing my virginity to hot and sexy brood master Derek Hale, you need to tell me exactly who you know that his middle name is Sebastian?"
Ronon glanced once more at the sleeping genius and gave a pleased grin. "Yeah, me too."
He visited his parents' graves the next day, laying a bundle of dried wild roses and sprigs of dried myrrh and meadowsweet. He would not visit them again. The boy who was their son was gone, leaving only the Witch.
Bruce used the absence of fashion like a shield, his entire wardrobe was interchangeable and completely disposable. The Hulk made having any sense of fashion moot anyway.
She didn’t reply, only laid her hand on his shoulder in silent support. He gradually relaxed his hunched shoulders, feeling the warm of her palm through the thin material of his night shirt. It had been a while since he’d been touched so casually, most of his time spent amongst his people in full armor.
Potter ranted and raged while Black glared darkly from under a pitch black fringe. The village elders wouldn't allow either boy to bring harm to the Witch of the Wood but the duo proved clever and made his life miserable in other ways.
"So, this is just like the beginning of every creepy horror flick ever." He deadpanned, taking in the dried and shriveled vines that seemed to choke the massive gate, giving only peeks at the silhouette of the gargantuan house beyond. "It’s the fucking house from The Haunting. You brought us to fucking Hill House, Candace."
Ronon grinned as he watched Rodney's hand go slack around the ancient device in his hand, his mouth gaping open as he stared at the calm blue waters of the alien ocean. Pristine white sand stretched along the coast line for miles in either direction, separating the lush green of the dense forest from the crystal clear waters.
He’d even given Xander enough time to make a last call to Sunnydale where Willow and Giles were already battening down the magical hatches while Buffy prowled the chaotic streets. It had been a huge relief to know that his people were safe back home. Well, as safe as they could be on a hell mouth anyway.
They finally arrived as a larger doorway, this one had an actual door that opened on rumbling tracks. The room beyond was fitted with the same white lights as the large room from before. It seemed to be some kind of tech kept for the more important areas.
He'd just taken up his cup to enjoy the rest of his tea when his father burst into the room, still in his dressing gown, long blond hair wild and uncombed. The man was livid, ranting about favouritism and how Sirius Black should be removed as Steed Master for letting a potential rider in with the steeds before the official Choosing Ceremony and that how he would have the man's job for this.
Dudley greeted them at the door, wiping his hands on a dishtowel as his wife cleared the table behind him. "We don't stay up at the house at night. Never after dark. We always leave before dark."
They started spending more time together after that, carving out of what little free time the had. Shika and Kiba helped Naru find and move into a better place, a little house out in the woods where they could have privacy. The cottage was cute and quaint and Naruto had gone a bit gooey when he'd come home to see most of his friends at the surprise house warming party they'd thrown him.
Erik grinned and turned the stool, tugging at Tony's waist until he stood between his legs. Tony hummed into the kiss, his hum turning to a moan as the kiss deepened and Erik's hands wandered down to his ass.
He wanted to tuck himself right along Tony’s back and stay there forever, if that’s what it took to wake up to that sound every morning. He wanted to see Tony in bed, sleep soft and wearing one of his shirts, the sleeves falling past his fingertips and collar falling off his shoulder.
“What is your desire?” he asked solemnly. The captain blinked in surprise but Anthony knew that the general wasn’t talking to his enemy. He took a deep breath and prepared his final and only move.
“Of course the argument can be made that you’ve seen too much of our base but we’d be packed and out of here by the time you get back to your precious sunlight kingdom. You’ll never find us among the vast system of caves. So that leaves one last problem. What exactly can we get for you?”
Pepper would be getting the priority message right now, JARVIS would be implementing the rest with inhuman speed. Both Rhodey and Happy would be getting emails, giving them a heads up before the shit storm that was coming.
She'd woken up on the moon base, still in the medical healing tank. The knitting devices were still patching up her side and ragged stubs that were her right arm and leg. Afterwards, the doctors had explained that both limbs had been too far gone to re attached by the time they'd gotten her to proper medical treatment and growing all new limbs were too expensive with the war on.
As he ran his fingers over the soft and silky garments, savouring the smooth glide against his skin. He missed soft things. The last few weeks had been rough durable clothes and sleeping on various uncomfortable surfaces, strapped with various weapons and accoutrement that were too important not to have on his person. This was the first time in a while that they’d spent the day in a place safe enough to let their guards down a bit.
Ronon grunted, as nodding made his head pound. He glanced over at his mate once more. "He really ok? He doesn't do well in water like that."
A sculpted eye brow quirked as kissable lips curled at the corners. “It’s the least I can do for someone who thinks I’m beautiful.”
They solved the case four days later, which was four days too slow for Gibbs who prowled around like a bear with a hurt paw. Tony kept his head down, a bit disappointed that his evidence hadn't panned out to be anything significant. He hadn't mentioned it again but both Ziva and McGee liked to pick at it from time to time.
Luckily, they were making great strides in cybernetics and she would be fitted and wired up with two brand spanking new prosthetics and be back out into the battlefield in no time.
The gravity of the situation finally hit him then, the cold and brutal truth that the one fated by destiny to complete him, body, mind, heart and soul; was the one who most likely be the death of him before this was all over.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Shika had tried to mumble about how troublesome they both were but he was too busy rolling the blond on to his back and kissing him breathless; his shadows quivering wildly in the dense trees.
The billowing black smoke blotted out the night sky, only leaving glimpses of the star filled heavens. He'd swung through the stuff a few times, the filters of his mask working hard against the grit and soot. The police had clued him into their frequency and he'd been working with the sergeant in charge of the evacuation.
He felt really good to be working alongside with the police, ever since he had been inducted as a Junior Avenger. He'd been a bit put out at first, not been seen as an adult, but after a few close calls with sticking his nose into Avenger business and a few 'Come to Jesus' talks with Tony and Steve, he been happy with the restricted duties. Besides, the heroes had made him feel included and welcome in so many other ways.
Engaging in its limited stealth shielding, the legionnaire worked its way down to the vehicle and secured an unattended hooded coat and some loose radio equipment. Anthony quickly shrugged on the garment, grateful for its sturdy, if not smelly, protection from the chill winds. He quickly cracked open the strange re-breather mask slash communication device attached to the coat, delving into its inner workings curiously.
see if you recognize the Sin City quote.
Candy gave an indignant shriek. "Oh for fuck's sake. Let the big baby out. This is getting fucking ridiculous."
"That boy is so pussy blind I swear." Stiles rolled his eyes. "I guess I can't fault him too much, if I liked pussy as much as I like cock, I might still be following Lydia around in a besotted daze."
Xander nodded, turning his head to share a hot and filthy kiss with the man holding him close. “To the end and beyond? Yeah… I like the sound of that.”
He turned to face Rhodes, allowing a slight frown form on his face. “The attacks on the Solar Forges are becoming a concern. They may not be strong enough for overwhelm the fortress ramparts but one of them may get lucky. To lose a forge to sabotage would weaken the others.”
There was an inch of water along the cave floor now, soaking Ronon's pants as he sat leaned against the smoothest wall. Rodney pushed down his panic. This was not the time to lose his head to panic. He had his injured mate to see to and that natural imperative seemed strong enough to override his usual fear response.
"So mad." Stiles laughed wetly. "But I have to so this. For him. For them both."
At least the enemy had all been dealt with and Stile allowed Derek to take him back to the loft to get him cleaned up, bandaged and tucked into bed.
He woke up with a warm hand on his ass and stubble burn on his inner thighs. His ass and back ached in that good, toe curling way and he smiled against the shoulder his face was smoshed against. He lay there in the pale early light of morning, snug against a warm, firm body and felt like he'd finally found a place where he truly belonged.
Then they got to work.
"And how did you get her to give you the map to the pass? You didn't have sex with her too did you?"
"You're cold. You must be." he murmured almost to himself. "All you've known is the sun's kiss."
The Iron King had no soul.
They stayed that way as the comet dipped in the east, taking its light and leaving darkness to creep over the sky once more. He felt oddly bereft, as if he’d seen the face of God and then gone blind immediately after.  His breath was loud in his ears, his heart hammering in his chest. It was only when Derek’s arms tightened around him that he realized that he was shivering.
Rossi hummed with appreciation. "Black and white. Dark and light. Good and evil. Dom and sub. Poetic. I like it."
“The Iron King has no heart. The Iron King has not soul.” He needed the blond to understand. “The Iron King has no soul mate.”
Thankfully, Teyla managed to distract both men before things got too 'rumble in the jungle', keeping them both occupied until they emerged from the thick tree line unto a breathtaking sight.
Rodney knew the moment the water started trickling in, that they were in serious trouble. He'd been in this kind of situation before. Trapped under water in a container that proved to be less than perfectly water proof. He'd been of the opinion that being trapped in a damaged puddle jumper at the bottom of the ocean had been the worst situation but this one was steadily proving him wrong.
"Di Na Nwunye"
He forced himself back to the situation at hand, taking a quick glance around the room. Despite it being so large, there were few people actually present. And all of them were wearing full body armor and face masks.
They asked him why he didn't stay with his friends and he had a hell of a time explaining why a stupid gut feeling had made him turn back. He told them of his ride with Mr. Dudley and they went round to the couple's in town residence, guided through the thinning mist by the warm yellow street lights.
I just managed to eek this out so it's super short.
Derek smiled. It was soft. Stiles liked how it looked on him. Derek looked good, comfortable. So different from the haunted, wounded and broken down boy who’d left Beacon Hills, shaking and bloody in the back seat of his sister’s speeding car.
The huge iron wrought gate was ancient and curled with thick vines, obscuring the lawn beyond. In the distance of the vast estate, the huge house stood, shrouded in a thick white mist that curled along the old world spires and carved gothic stone work. The setting sun had lit the mist a pale orange that looked like a distant fire, in complete opposite to the mid-afternoon chill.
Anthony knew the look in the other man’s eyes. That crazed denial, that utter disbelief. He knew that if he refused again, that the man would make good on his promise. He stood, carefully pulling off his shirt and setting it aside. Next came his pants and he swallowed his shame at his own nakedness. This was beneath his dignity as king but he was no longer king. He was a prisoner of war and would act as such as to preserve his life for as long as he could.
"It's a hologram. It's not real. I just took the footage from outside the ship and projected it on the inside."
It’s not like Stiles hadn’t been slowly going out of his mind for the past few days. Like he hadn’t been see sawing between manic, caffeine fueled google marathons and depressive panic attacks. Like he hadn’t had a serious come to Jesus moment and been struck in the face that all the struggles he’d faced had basically been for nothing. That what future he’d imagined for himself were all worthless in the face of imminent destruction. The realization that they were all going to live after all had left him adrift, his mind stalled and floating on a vast sea of numb and uncertain darkness.
They were currently a week into the two week time frame and people were starting to go stir crazy. Hieghtmeyer had instigated a schedule of swapping people out for those at the alpha site as the steady downpour of rain falling from dark grey clouds had proven relentless and oppressive for some and they needed some time under clear blue skies.
Steve’s grin was a bit watery as he tried to find some anchor in this whirlwind of emotions. He felt dizzy with hope and joy.
A twig snapped somewhere behind him and he tensed for a second, only to relax completely when a soft greeting was carried on the wind. Derek stood to the side of the jeep, hands in the pockets of his ever present leather jacket and eyes glowing red in the darkness. The mouth was turned down into an adorable frown and Stiles chuckled at the sight, patting the empty patch of hood next to him.
King Argent had been so angry that the famed 'immortality' promised by the Dragon's had not helped his dying wife and daughter when they'd developed the fire pox. He'd cared not that their souls would sing together forever with the dragons.  He cared not that his heart stone would one day join theirs.
A screen appeared above the head, projected from its eyes. It was static at first, as the connection completed. He held his breath, preparing for whatever appeared on the screen. Suddenly Rhodes face appeared, large and furious. Anthony forced himself not to react as the dark skinned man’s face went slack with surprise before hardening with rage. Anthony barely listened to the short, sharp conversation between his general and his captor; his eyes never leaving Rhodes’ narrowed gaze.
Kiba blinked in shock and let his head thump back unto Shika's chest, making the other man grunt softly. Naru had been gone for over a year. Close to fifteen months the blond been on the road with the Toad sage, learning and training. Fourteen months, eight days, two hours since the three of them had spent that last night together, kissing farewell as Naruto had to be at the gate waiting for his mentor before the sun even rose.
The Captain stepped forward. “Widow?”
“We still have some time yet.” Reaper responded, baring his teeth in a wide grin. “Not every day we get to meet The Riddick face to face.”
"Shika." he murmured when he got near enough, dropping unceremoniously to the ground and rolling over to tuck himself against the man's side. He settled his cheek against the Nara's shoulder, rubbing his sensitive nose into the thin material of the man's vest, and took a deep breath.
She'd had a lot of time to think when she'd been adjusting to her new circumstances and had come to some conclusions. She may have secretly joined the Mobile Infantry to be with Johnny but she'd stayed for herself.
She'd just taken out a Tanker Bug and was beating feet to the ship when Johnny had shouted "Spiral Roll Out Left!", an alarmed look on his face. she hadn't even hesitated, executing the maneuver she'd drilled into her brain over years as quarterback of the high school football team.
"He would have if he knew about it I'm sure." Stiles tightened the straps and checked to see if he had everything. "Luckily, Lydia Martin is a book hoarder and a secret genius who delights in the rare hobby of translating obscure languages for fun."
He sighed, then frowned, a bit angry at himself for all the sighing he’d been doing lately. His fingertips found his rings and twisted them around and around his finger absently.
"Dye Nah Nuh- won -ee ay. I'll get it eventually." Rodney huffed. "What does it mean?"
His eyes stung as he seriously thought about scrapping the entire night. They ladies at the Jungle would understand right?
“Well don’t you look like a real LumberJack Timberwolf.” He curled his lip, hooking the helmet unto the bike. He slung his saddle bags over his shoulder and unzipped his leather riding jacket.
"Recent epiphany was it?" Derek leant toward the mirror, adjusting the ears on his head. "Liking cock more than pussy?"
When he finally went to bed that night, the lamp beside his bed clicked off before he could even reach for it. He blinked at it for a moment then said a soft 'thank you' into the darkness of the room, falling asleep with a small smile on his face.
She dug into the pocket of the tote and pulled out a foundation compact. It felt like she was putting it on with a butter knife but the darkening effect was passable at a glance. She looked at least three shades darker and she pulled out her phone and checked facebook for a final comparison.
“Your will be done?” A voice hissed from his side as the redhead stalked up to him, her eyes dark with rage.  “Your will? Who are you?”
He proceeded to crawl into Ronon's lap, gabbing about how he and Miko had been working on this project on the side and how he'd  thought is a perfect idea to try it out here with Ronon.
He was the Righteous and Divine Hand of the Great Sol.
Stiles chuckled at the memory, baring his teeth in the mockery of a smile. It's not like he hated the woman. Wait, hold up. He actually did hate the woman. It was her actions or lack thereof that had led directly to his life circumstances and if it wasn't for his father's sake and the sake of his small but viciously loyal pack, he'd sink his teeth into her soft belly and rip out her hot and steaming insides.
"You and Derek Hale? Dragon Lance Corporal Derek Sebastian Hale? What? How?"
"Eh. I figured that since I might get shot by dragon lance tomorrow or get cooked by Dragon breath and summarily eaten, I figured my five year plan wasn't worth the effort anymore."
It was only when the doors began opening with a loud cranking sound did Anthony curse his own stupidity. He’d done it again, he’d underestimated the rebels. The navigator had offered no code, no password. He hadn’t even looked at the radio once, even when it was being hacked by the legionnaire.
After reasonably freaking the fuck out, the world leaders demanded to know why they hadn’t been able to give more goddamn warning before the end of the world.
"It's Sedanwe, a pre cursor to Setedan language. It's been dead long ages but we still used certain words and phrases In modern times."
Small things like chase his cats and stone his windows. Set gophers and rabbits in his garden to damage the delicate plants and roots. They stoned his old clay jars, spoiling the decades old ointments and treatments inside. They broke his broom and scattered the bristles into the stream. They poisoned his goats and soured their milk, poured boiling water on his beehives and crushed the soft, sticky honey combs under their thick boots.
In the end though, John admitted that he didn't feel comfortable having relations with someone under his direct command and since he was the military leader, it narrowed his options greatly. That and the fact that he was something called Demisexual, which meant that he didn't find anyone sexually attractive unless he formed a strong emotional connection.
“Don’t worry pet. I’ll do right by you. Don’t you fret.”
The Iron King had no soul mate.
The command team had been working almost non-stop, making sure that this storm didn't turn out like the last one. Zelenka had been in charge of making sure all the grounding stations were up and running, installing at least half as much more so that the expected lightning wouldn't harm the city. Rodney had already had plans from to harvest some of the energy and disperse the excess harmlessly out to sea. The approaching storm just brought the timeline up on them that's all.
Stiles sighed contentedly before twisting his to look up at Derek’s profile. “Can you see anything at all? How does it work?”
it had been a hard, messy and miserable job and he'd had to drag the half dead jounin back to Kohona with Hinata limping along side, all of them utterly exhausted and disgusted. He'd been the only capable of briefing the Hokage, with both his teammates having been sent off to the hospital. Tsunade had been stoned faced during the meeting but at least the job had been successful.
“Hey…” Derek tugged at his hand sharply, “We’re too fucking old for that shit. We’ve seen too fucking much… well, figuratively speaking off course.”
He'd barely gotten though pouring some of the sweet smelling oil into a small bowl when there was an unholy screech and the lava lamp went flying, crashing into the opposite wall with a shower of glass and orange red mess. Wufei ducked his head to protect against the shards and turned to stare wide eyed at the dripping wall.
She'd filled up most of the pages with notes and sketches, writing and crossing out and writing and scratching and ripping out what she'd didn't want, didn't need.
He sent Tony off to take a hot shower, laying out a pair of black sweats and a deep red LSUNO as well as a pair of thick socks on the bed of the guest bedroom. When Tony finally wandered out, there was hot delicious soup and crusty bruschetta waiting for him.
It took everything in him not to react. He had to scream his mantra in the maelstrom of his mind so that his body did not do something stupid, like throw itself at his soul mate and cling desperately to him.
It took two days in the library  microfilm archives to find some information on his quarry. Back in 1976, there was a fire in the apartment and two young men had died. The older one, a nineteen year old Solo Maxwell had been burned to death while the younger, seventeen year old Duo; had died of smoke inhalation. It was reported that he'd been trying to rescue his older brother when he'd succumbed.
ok... it's getting a little angsty here but i promise it will get better. Poor Tony. i'm  sucker for happy endings and i'm trying really hard not to get too sad with this.
Life as he knew it was going to change.
“Thought I’d scratch this off my bucket list while I still could. Didn’t want to die without finding out what the big secret Victoria’s been keeping from us all.”
Bed sharing / Clothes Sharing
Steve was sitting against the bedhead, snug in a ratty t-shirt and rumpled boxers. His hair was an utterly adorable mess and he had a thick, most likely non-fiction, biography opened in his lap. His eyes were a summer sky blue when he looked up and his gentle mile felt like the warmth in his chest after a cup of Clint’s really good hot chocolate.
"I can live with that."
“Oh my God.” Derek groaned loudly, rolling his eyes so hard that he almost saw his own brain.
Kiba chuckled and let his head fall against the soft grass, looking up at the cloudless blue sky through the treetops. He felt trouble free and more content than a runt in a puppy pile.
He's glad that Scott was brave enough to be there with him, as they would have both been shot on site for daring to adhere by the old ways. His best friend and brother stood with him as his father's body burned, helped rake the ash so that everything was consumed.
"No." Derek growled low, willing the red from his eyes and he tucked his face into Stile's neck. His lover scoffed. He knew him way too well.
And behind that monstrosity of a desk, sat a monster in the flesh.
She recalledered Johnny yanking her by the back of her uniform as he yelled at the pilot to take off. The last thing she'd remembered was the medic pouring clotting powder on her and the blazing heat of it sending her under, Jonny's voice giving her comfort as she faded away.
Anthony kept his gaze on the man before him, clenching his jaw and refusing to be the one to look away first. He said nothing, letting his silence speak for him. He would give them nothing. The Iron King did not parley with rebel scum. The Iron King crushed them under his boot.
The last thing he’d ever expected was fucking zombies. Talk about the wrong kind of un-dead. He never thought that he’d prefer the company of vampires. Or that they would be so awesome at zombie killing.
Unfortunately, they had the opposite effect on Spencer. He paled and swallowed heavily, plastering on a polite smile to the people who basically hijacked his entire existence and forcing back the tremor in his voice at the idea of spending the next forty five days trapped in this place.
Talia Hale curled her lip, her polite façade falling away as she bared her teeth at him, her fangs dropping as she growled. Stiles took his hands out of his pockets, letting them hang relaxed at his side as his nails thickened and grew black. She wanted to things up a notch? She wanna be starting something? Well, he was ready for her. He wouldn't start a fight with the wolves but he sure as fuck would put an end to it.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
“The Iron King holy shit.” The tall brunette sagged against one of the other tables. “Great merciful Nyx, we’re fucked.”
Now he was laid in a hospital bed, fighting to get better all because some high school bully decided that he was just too flamboyantly gay to be allowed. Flash may not have thrown a punch or a kick himself but he'd encouraged others to act against her brother in all but blood.
It took another day for the news to leak out to the public and that’s when things really went to shit. Martial law was initiated worldwide as people panicked and ran around like headless chickens. News and Media talked about nothing else and the National Guard were out in force to stomp out any one trying to take undue advantage. Money started pouring into beleaguered space and missile programs, trying to find some way to swat the comet away from the planet like some unwanted fly.
He felt a deep keening sort of disappointment. He’d let everybody down. He’d let Bucky down. He’d failed the mission they’d all worked so hard for. Sacrificed so much for.
By the time he'd stumbled over to her position, she'd already recovered expertly and was unto the next part of the plan; leaving him out of place and open to attack.
Viscount Lucius Malfoy's epic feud against Marquis James Potter had been a long fought and bitter one, both men nurturing the embers of black hate for each other in their guts for years on end. Personally, Draco thought that it was all just a waste of time and that both men should just hate fuck and get it out of their systems. He was sure that both Lady Lily and his mother would agree.
Setting down his case, he went down on one knee and looked up at the Dom's permission to open it. At the man's nod, he snapped the clamps open and laid it flat on the rug. Inside were swatches of material as well as other tailoring accouterments.
"No."
“When was the last time you got to indulge in something hot… and sweet?”
"Oh you don't know the half, Very Special Agent. As someone who has loved insects since he was five years old, I've heard and been called every name imaginable. There's hardly anything anyone can call me know that I haven't heard before."
The proximity alert beeped, waking Duo from a fitful sleep.  He blinked the crust from his eye and unstrapped himself from his bed, floating over to the fresher. Gravity was expensive to run, especially out in the more deserted parts of the solar system. There were no other sweeper ships nearby and Howard and his base HQ were at least two days travel away.
He gave a soft "aha" as he found the crypt he was looking for. His father's bindings were much paler than the others nearby, the cloth wrapped tighter.
"Let me out."
The small sound his wedding ring made on the marble countertop echoed through the empty kitchen as he tapped his fingers restlessly and without rhythm. Along with the clink of his coffee cup as he twisted it back and forth with his other hand, the soft glub glub of the bubbling percolator, and the almost sighs every time he exhaled; it all came together like some kind of odd melody.
He blinked rapidly, suddenly remembering where he was and who he was with. He glanced at the wide eyed brunet and flushed hotly.
Stiles quirked an eyebrow. "Are you kidding? Don't you know that power games are the best games? Just ask your precious Alpha. She'll tell you. She and Deaton are like two peas in a fucking pod when it comes to laying out some spectacular mind fucks. Don't bring your pity to this party, bitch. No one here gives a flying fuck."
He was too strung out to be embarrassed and to scattered to pull on his famous Stark charm. He was just grateful that someone had been there for him when he needed. He gave the man a weak but genuine smile.
Funny, he didn't feel so lucky.
He was absently paying attention to the chatter over the comm. When a loud cracking sound reached his ears and all of a sudden he was falling, his hands and feet scrambling for his webbing. He heard himself yell, the sound cutting off abruptly as he crashed into something hard and unforgiving. His breath rushed out of him in a pained oof, hurt radiating along his spine.
He would give it to Wufei when he went back to earth again, the Chinese man had almost nothing from his home and he knew that L5 mementos were usually only found on the black market, sold by fortune hunters and thieves. The Preventers had been able to shut down most of the rings, by Wufei's determination alone some days, and most of the items recovered were in a memorial museum in the capital of the New L5 settlement on earth. He'd kept nothing for himself and Duo knew that he would appreciate the gesture.
Nick Fury's eyebrow rose in disbelief. "No?"
He shivered violently, both from the bone deep cold of the place and from the doubt that wanted to rise up and clog his throat. The captain blinked at him and tilted his head.
Draco had the sky now. Nothing else could compare.
“We can’t.” he pleaded as the blond pressed against his back, hands coming to rest on his hips. Blood rushed in his veins as his heart raced in his chest. He tried to shift away, hopping off the stool but the blond was quicker and he was soon pinned against the table, face to face.
That cooled her anger well enough and she carefully backed down. Mores the pity. He was looking forward to cutting into her beautiful face. She glared back at him, trying to save face among her pack because she'd lost any influence on his long ago.
He'd thought about asking Lydia or one of the other girls to help him buy make up but he didn't want to subject himself to that kind of judgment. He was self-conscious enough as it was, no need to kill whatever confidence he had been building.
"No problem" Rodney's voice was a bit breathy and low and he cleared his throat as he stepped away. The genius then turned around, handing him the pack over his shoulder. "Do me."
The voice was low and it drew Anthony in, thrumming through his entire body as the blond grew closer. He could feel it from his curling toes to his fluttering eyelashes. His mark gave a sharp zing and he gasped. The captain was so close now, he could feel the man’s heat. Feel his breath along the length of his neck. Anthony shuddered and gave a ragged breath.
Stiles' sharp laugh came out like a yip, his eyes crinkling at the corners at the memory of the Hale pups coming returning to school, their tails between their legs at all the looks and whispers. Cora had been almost feral at the sight of him leaning against his locker, a wide and wicked grin on his face.
The 'Doc' was a short, broad man with salt and pepper curls and a rumpled grey coat. He greeted them all with a sheepish nod, taking a moment to stare at Anthony in ill-disguised curiosity before shuffling over to a covered table.
The nucleus of ice and rock was dark amidst the devastatingly beautiful deadly cloud of gas that surrounded it. The Coma, as it was called, flashed and flared as it brushed against the upper atmosphere, sending terrifyingly heart stopping reactions skittering across the sky. The tail was a thing in itself, slithering behind like a living thing, colours twisting and merging continuously.
"Relax kid, It's oxygen. Take deep, slow breaths for me okay?"
Naru looked completely blissed out, smiling lazily as covered with come as he looked at them both. His eyes were warm with such love and affection that Kiba couldn't help but lean down and kiss him hard, his hips stuttering as he too fell into ecstasy. Naru tasted like Shika and smelled like them both, switching some trigger deep inside Kiba's chest and releasing the last of the cold stone-like tension that had been tucked there for the past year.
“You heard the lady. You gonna release this catch or what?”
"I do know of a planet where sharing a plate of fruit jelly constitutes as getting married. They have a conclave shielded by a ZPM and spend all day eating cake and drinking wine."
Before his despair crept up too close, the door to his quarters opened with a clank and a bang. The tall brunette filled the doorway, a bucket and a set of folded clothes in his hands. With wary eyes that never left his prisoner, he placed both near the heater and backed away. Next came the short blond with a tray. There was a bowl of hot broth, a torn chunk of crusty bread and a cup of weak, hot tea. The tray was placed carefully on a storage unit before he too disappeared.
Alternate Universe - People ride giant moths in a fantasy world.
They all looked as one to Anthony, who was seated at the head of the table; chin resting on one armored fist. He looked back at them, noting the surprise and fear barely hidden behind their calm facades. They were afraid. All of them. They’d never known a threat like this in their lifetimes.
"Halloween."
'More like farcical." Rossi mumbled from his chair.
Steve made a helpless gesture. “I’m sorry. Should I?”
The store in question was a Victoria’s Secret and they’d cleared out the small store quickly, dispatching the poor undead manager and dumping her body two streets over. Other than that, the store was relatively clean, had an ensuite bathroom with working toilet and didn’t smell like wet garbage so Xander considered it a win.
This time the dark eyebrow went higher. "I hadn't planned on it. Presentation outfits tend to be a bit … whimsical."
"Hey, are you doing the glowing red alpha glare behind me?" a boney elbow in his gut brought him back to the moment.
The stranger blinked at him in confusion before his face morphed into disbelief. “You don’t recognize me do you?, gorgeous.”
Mind clear and sharp, he glanced past Rhodes and the burning forge to the dark mountains where the gaze of Mighty Sol ended and the Penumbra territory sat, laying like a crouching beast in wait.
They both looked after her as she strode from the room before turning back to each other. Riddick grinned, shrugging so that his shackles clanked.
She'd burn the little spiral note book when she got home.
Rhodes hadn’t been at all  happy with the plan but Anthony had been adamant. He would track the culprits right back to their dark hovels and rain Sol’s wrath down on them. With two whole garrisons of Legion at his command, the sky would be filled with light and flame.
They made their way out of the catacomb entrance, passed a drunk and giggly Isaac Lahey and hurried to the tree line.
He went up onto his toes, watching how his thighs and calves flexed and his butt tightened. He’d forego the matching fluffy house slippers as he was a menace in heels and that would be just begging for a sprained ankle. No thank you.
Steve found himself flushing red, his cheeks and neck heating as he gently carried Tony across the lab and set him down unto the plush couch. Tony made a small, sweet little sleepy sound and Steve cursed silently in his head. He was a fucking goner.
Thankfully Lydia, Erica and Allison had read him the riot act about his idiotic and chauvinistic actions before Derek had given into his wolf nature and skinned a strip off of Scott's hide for putting Stiles in danger.
He called his mother.
She hid a small smile behind her hair, taking comfort in Aunt may's and Ned's voices as they talked beside her. Oh to be a fly on the wall when Flash came back into town, horny as hell, pissed at being stood up and rearing for a fight. He was sure to get much more than he bargained for.
John absently wondered how the man was able to walk blindly through the wooded path without tripping over some random root when he could trip over his own feet walking through Atlantis.
With all of them suitably protected from the sun, they waded into the cool waters with varying expressions of pleasure and joy. The sea was calm and so clear he could see the detail of his toe nails. John whooped and dove, swimming along the seabed until he came up on their other side.
(See the end of the chapter for
"And after that?" Theodore's voice was gravelly from screaming orders for the evacuation. "He didn't seem to care that we'd turned down Potter's offer of alliance. That the Deep Forest wanted nothing to do with the Summer Kingdoms and their war with Hogwarts. He would rather see us dead and our power burned to ash that see it used by another. What are we without our forest, our lands?"
Spencer tilted his head, eyes narrowing as he glanced between both Dom and Sub. "That's mostly because Doms believe that they have to match closely with their Subs and Sub Presentation Fashion has evolved over the decades to highlight sexuality and vulnerability and Dom Fashion does not adapt well to those principles."
"You're so damned selfish." Laura scoffed loudly, pushing herself into the lime light once again. "People could die and you want to play stupid power games. You should be ashamed of yourself."
He held up the collar, wondering how the alpha would react. To his surprise, Derek knelt between his socked feet and looked up at him with a curl of his lip.
The Sunlight Kingdom was Sol’s heart. And the Iron King was his mighty fist.
"Oh boy does she. It's almost pitiful to see how much he admires her in return."
Stiles smiled proudly. "Thanks."
To hear him brag in that halls about Peter's injuries, about how he'd cried out for help and how they'd taken turns in kicking him had made her blood boil. The attackers had been arrested but the DA hadn't been able to make the case against Flash stick, especially with his father's bevy of lawyers. There'd been no solid proof of his involvement, just the testimony of dubious characters paid to stay silent.
There was a sharp intake of breath from the beautiful stranger. A warm and solid hand cupped his elbow. “What’s on that mind of yours soldier? It’s not just the drink is it?”
With enough patience and belief, he would take to the skies for the first time on the samhain night, with his long black cloak and his crooked hat; flying above the tree tops with the owls and other night birds as was a Witch's Rite of Passage.
He purchased the waist trainer online and practiced wearing it a week before Halloween. It was tight and a bit uncomfortable but he got used to it. It also cinched his waist awesomely so it was worth it.
Danny chuckled darkly. "Chris Argent is driving the bodies down to San Diego as we speak. He sends his thanks by the way. Both the hide and the horns are extremely rare and he can get a pretty penny for them from the right buyer."
Erik smiled, wild and wicked as his fingers traced the crack of Tony's ass and pressed the pad of his middle finger against the smaller man's asshole.
He quirked a peirced eyebrow. "Tell your druid to get off his lazy, sketchy ass and solve his own problems."
Thankfully, the floor was smooth under the thin soles of his boots. He pulled the thick coat closer, eyes taking in every detail as they made their way down the long steps.
He spoke his human name for the first time in years, leaving his title behind in the ashes of the past.
Ewan kicked the back of Jake's seat, hard. "Let me out, Jake. Now."
Draco was still having a light breakfast of honey on toast with some strong lavender tea when the news came from the village, brought by a panting and swaying runner.
“He’s at Scott’s.”
He felt both blessed and cursed, his duty as the Iron King both saving him and damning his broken and bitter heart and soul. Taking a deep breath, he pushed all of his disappointment and pain deep down and held his head high.
There was nothing left of L5 now by a graveyard. A long line of space junk from when they blew themselves up rather than kowtow to Romefeller and Oz. Most of the valuable metals and parts had already been picked clean by other scavengers, even though the new earth  government had forbid it. Duo usually made a pass once or twice a year, just to see what he could scrape together.
She'd died in childbirth and she'd been one of the last to be burned in the old ways until the King had chased away the dragons and stricken all Ancient Lore and Rituals from the Archives in a fit of grief stricken rage.
He had to crush that part of him. He had to kill that dangerous hope. He could not show weakness nor doubt. This man was his enemy and would kill him in an instant the moment he found out who he really was.
Rodney wasn't the typical caregiver/ provider type, turning off most others with his acerbic tongue and intolerance for stupid bullshit. But Ronon wasn't most others. The smart mouthed genius reminded him so much of his mate on Seteda, a real firecracker and fierce warrior.
The rest of the shelves held broken parts and old paper booked, crudely bound with words almost faded completely. Flipping through one kicked up a cloud of dust and Anthony hastily tucked it back as he hacked violently. He flopped unto the small cot, wincing as it squeaked and sagged.
Steve though, was a man of simple tastes.  Quality over quantity was his motto when it came to building his wardrobe. He liked to choose well-made pieces, more expensive than others but made to last.
"Take the coat, DiNozzo."
He took a breath, feeling the armor move with him. Whatever it was, he would face it.
They’d just cleared the step and craggy mountains when the attack came, blue light erupting from below to burst through the air around him. He swerved sharply, deftly navigating through the barrage of artillery as legionnaires were destroyed en masse around him.
The road was clear that morning, all the mist cleared away and the forest was damp and darkly beautiful. The cruiser soon pulled to a stop, the officer having glimpsed a spot of cream and a reflection of red glass.
Stark’s sharp peel of laughter echoed across the empty balcony. “Oh man, that’s Obie, my God father. He finally retired last month and handed over the reins of the company to me."
Shika/Kiba/Naru threesome. Timeline? What Timeline?
Ronon carefully cupped the other man's hand in his and turned it so that the small stone dropped into the water and sank. Before Mckay could sputter about it, Ronon pulled the wrist closer and pressed his mouth to Mckay's pulse point.
The next weeks wouldn't be easy, even with the tendency for people to jump to the next scandal. News involving Tony Stark always had staying power amongst the masses and this one had a lot of meat to rip into.
"We are our storytellers and our warriors, we are our innocence of youth and wisdom of the elderly. We are the saplings we saved of the forest that we will plant anew in our new home."
It had started as sex, soon after they'd turned chunin, stress relief with people not their own team mates. Shika's team was too close, Kiba's team had been scattered to the winds on solo missions and Naruto's team…. well, Naruto's team was a fucking disaster.
"I agree." John nodded, already slathering the cream on his body and rubbing it in. "I didn't even think about packing sunscreen in my gear. All teams should have it. Or at least put it on before each mission."
Xander studied the panties in his hand, absently rubbing the material between his fingertips as he deliberated. The decision was an easy one and soon he was stripping off in the small changing room, his gun slung within easy reach because one could never be too careful in a zombie apocalypse.
The shiny black Lincoln town car was parked where it always was, parked in front of the Lucky Strike Car and Casino. She watched it for a while from two blocks away, checking the walking traffic on the empty side street and slumping down when a police car when by.
"You motherfuckers." He laughed, the sound of it chilling as it echoed through the silent clearing.  "I must admit that I'm no longer surprised by the shit you keep trying to pull over on me. " He gave his former best friend a simple nod. "I'll see to making sure my dad stays safe and sound, don't you worry scottywolf. We Vulpinis look after our own."
"Why would she even do that?" Kiba perked his head up to look at his lover. They hadn't been able to spend more than a night of down times together for more than six months, their lives were so hectic. "Wait… you don't think?"
He gave a full body shake, shedding his bad mood off like water, and turned towards his fox kin with a vulpine smile. "Let's go home guys. If we hurry we can still catch Doctor Sexy and eat our pizza before it gets too cold."
The flats went into her tote and she shoved her feet into the clunky shoes, running a hand through her wild hair. She smiled and made small talk with the library matron  as she checked out her books, apologizing for keeping the other for so long. The bus ride home was a quiet one and she just breathed as the scenery went by.
They'd fucked everywhere after that, Naru letting Kiba rub his scent all over him whenever he wanted, pulling out and spilling his seed all over that perfect tanned skin. Kiba was hungry for the man and Naruto loved being desired.  The blond would sling himself over Kiba's shoulders when they talked or curl up in his lap, rubbing his scarred cheeks against bare skin.
He huffed weakly gave her a discerning look. "You just like it because of Voldemort don't you? You're so morbid, Chelle."
They secured the doors from the inside and Spike disappeared through the roof access to go scrimmage for supplies before the sun rose, leaving Xander to set up their sleeping arrangements for the day. The metal rolling doors allowed him the use of a small lamp and he made quick work of setting up a small camp site in the small manager’s office.
Stiles went boneless in his arms and he smiled in smug satisfaction. He continued until he felt Stiles' breath even out before letting himself fall into sleep.
The blond took a step in, closing the door quietly behind him. “I think that I can understand why you didn’t say when we first met. We were sworn enemies.”
It took him a week to fill half his cargo bay with scraps, some going to the sweepers for Howard to fence for him, some he would take and sell to Hilde at cost. They still had a great relationship and she would sometimes take him to her bed, if she was in the mood. They would smoke weed together after and he would spend a few days fixing shit she had laying around.
"Oh wow. She does hate his guts, doesn't she?"
Ewan spent the night fretting over his missing friends; heading out early with the Police to trace their journey back to the house. Yes, he was sure that they wouldn't have left him behind. No, they were not the kind to pull pranks like this. Yes, he'd tried their phones over and over but had gotten no answer.
She shrugged, not denying it, and he gave a weak chuckle which quickly turned into a cough. She retreated to the corner of the room as nurses rushed in, hugging her arms around herself and feeling cold as she watched him cough spots of blood.
But she'd desperately placed the silver torc around his neck and kissed his head before leading the last of their warriors into the forest that had been their home. She'd gone to die, they'd all gone to die. To give the rest of them enough time to make it to the shore. To the ships that were waiting to take them into the unknown storm.
Anthony found himself huffing without even thinking about it, his lips twitching slightly before he could rule his face back to impassivity. Unfortunately, the blond had been looking at him intently and had caught the slip. Those stunning blue eyes brightened and that full mouth hitched smugly at the corners.
Strangely, the lava lamp also seemed to be the catalyst for the odd events that started happening. Things started being moved. Just small things either being moved a few inches to the left  or disappearing only to cheekily reappear after he just finished searching the entire apartment for it.
Scott stood there until he couldn't see Stiles anymore, letting the tears fall freely from his eyes as he cleared the pyre. With one last longing glance at the distant cliffs, he sighed and turned back towards the town.
He rolled his cotton stuffed head to look at where his mate slept, sprawled over the empty medical cot like a man exhausted. He was dressed in a set of scrubs, a laptop abandoned near his hand.
more Rondey/Ronon hurt comfort. I love these two. so adorable.
"You're welcome."
"Will you be co-ordinating for the presentation?"
Spencer gave a bow of deference, as if he had not just made a demand of the dangerous Dom before him. But his craft was his craft and he would not compromise, no matter the client. He raised his chin subtly, straightening his spine in defiance.
Hands secured his trembling back and pulled him up, settling him on Steve's lap and settling him even deeper on the hot cock fucking him. He groaned, shuddering as he hugged Steve around the shoulders and buried his face in that warm neck.
"Di … Na… Nwunye."
McProbie snickered loudly from where he was busy dropping eaves across the room where he'd been sketching the scene. He ducked his head quickly enough when Tony turned his glare his way.
“Why haven’t you done the catch and release with this one yet? We need to get a move on if we want to make it to the jump point in time. Drop him off on the nearest rock and let’s go.”
He felt safe. He felt protected. He felt loved.
He went on… "with a massive over grown gate secured by huge fucking cow chains and a rusty ass padlock."
Tony looked almost swallowed by the thing, his smaller lithe frame tucked up into the knitted wool with only the top of his curly head and the tips of his socked feet peeping out.
"Everything can kill you. " Rodney retorted, stripping out of the last of his clothes and folding them neatly on the tree trunk. He gestured as one of the little packages, tearing it open and squeezing out the white liquid inside. "The trick is to avoid being is a vulnerable position. Prevention is better than cure."
Derek was already on the rough wooden porch, mug in hand, when Stiles slowly rolled his heavy bike up the loose gravel drive. There were differences he noted first, the grown in man beard to go with the lumberjack chic, worn denim and plaid. The lack of leather and that permanent frown.
The youngest Potter had claimed the last great dragon moth and had already been sworn in as its rider.
He was sitting in his ruined garden, crying unto his withered flowers when the werewolf boy, Remus, found him. The young man smiled at him, gently wiped his tears away and took his hand.
Ronon blinked, looking up at what appeared to be hard vacuum, the nebula cresting above, around and below them. He reached out his arm and felt along the sides of the ship, the image flickering where his fingers trailed.
Most of all his missed his people and despaired at leaving them without a protector. He missed Rhodes and his fond growl. He missed Virginia with her hair of flame and quiet wit. He missed the sunlight reflected in glass and on water. He missed feeling warm through and through.
Stiles gave his best friend a long look, hoping that the secret love those two held for each other worked out. He knew that Allison's family would never let her marry a healer's son and Scott was too soft hearted to rise the ranks of the Military. It was an ill-fated match and he hoped that their hearts wouldn't be broken in the end.
The entire room tensed, spinning to face the sheepish and apologetic man. After a few seconds, they all relaxed, the trio of guards easing their weapons back into their holsters. It seemed to break the spell because the Captain spoke, his voice reverberating through the room.
Draco felt his eyes burn as he leaned heavily on the thick wooden railing of the ship. Partly to steady himself as it swayed on the rough waters, partly to keep his knees from buckling.
Tony moaned, bringing up his hand to wipe at the corners of his eyes. He flexed his thighs around Steve's waist, toes curling as Steve pressed in deep and stilled.
He turned his head to his best friend. Blaise eyes were dark with fear and fury. His dark face was covered in soot and ash and there was dried blood along his temple. "What do we do now Dray? Where do we go so they won't find us and kill us? Dumbledore's Army will never stop until they have killed us all, you know that."
Ronon kissed him deeply, conveying his gratitude and affection for the compassion that very few people knew that Rodney possessed.
Apparently the blond seemed to understand him well enough because as he nodded soberly, gaze flitting between the brunet and the dissected droid. Anthony held his gaze, standing tall and unwavering as he faced against the rebel leader in a silent battle of wills.
The break in his voice was the only indication of Blaise's grief. He stood tall and proud, every inch the commander and second his mother had been grooming him to be. His blue epaulets were stark against the dark gleam of his armor. Just as Pansy's green and Theodore's red were when they came close. They were all dirty, exhausted and red at the eyes from crying. And they were all looking at him to lead them. Draco gave on last plea for his mother's wisdom before taking a deep breath.
"The cave system the locals told us about collapsed and you took the brunt of the fall. You and Rodney were trapped while John and I went back to the gate for help because the heavy rains started, causing flash floods. We had to comeback with Puddle jumpers and  two more teams to get you out before the cave you were in filled with water and drowned you both."
He was put in a room this time. Sol’s blessings. It is small a cramped but there is a small cot with rough woven bedding, a small potbellied heater in the corner and a spiral woven rug made from fibres keeping his booted feet from the cold stone floor. The dim light emanating from the small heater tinged the rest of the rest of the room, packed with shelves of broken parts and storage units, a beautiful blue; catching on the edges of all the bits and bobs scattered amongst the shelves.
Making sure that the genius was situated in the middle of them all, he began to strip as well, leaving himself bare but for the long knife strapped to his thigh. He heard Rodney sputter behind him.
The blonde made a needy sound and froze, toes curling and moaning as he came a second time, long spurts of come splashing across his stomach, Shika and the soft grass.  Kiba fucked him through the orgasm, never slowing his pace or strength because he knew that Naru liked it that way.  Shika came with a grunt soon after, one hand grasping the blond's throat gently as he swallowed around the throbbing cock.
He let Steve's sweet whispers and the steady rocking take him away, finally letting go off the last of his racing thoughts, his mind going blissfully blank.
Tugging his thick coat tighter around him against the pervasive chill, he stood and explored the room he’d been sequestered too. The storage units were filled with sealed packets of varying densities and labelled with some kind of weird jargon that Anthony could not begin to comprehend. Some of the unit were locked with some sort of simple mechanism. He was sure that given time, he could crack on open.
Tony's good mood lasted for days, thinking almost constantly about that almost kiss and sharing texts and funny pictures with the man who bestowed it upon him. Neither Ziva's and Tim's teasing nor Gibbs disdain over Tony's apparent personal joy could put a dent into his attitude. He invited Lamar over for a home cooked meal, playing the piano for him after as they drank wine and talked about insects.
Ronon gave a disbelieving huff. "Sunlight…. Can kill you?"
All because Penelope Garcia liked his work. He cleared his throat, interrupting the blonde's cherry babbling.
They discussed the evidence, which turned out to be discarded egg casings from a beetle that wasn't at all native to the state. Tony made quick notes on his phone to follow up and then set the device aside. Conversation was easy after that, Lamar was so passionate about his vocation and even though Tony could take or leave most creepy crawlies, he was fascinated by the other man's wealth on knowledge on the subject.
Spencer's mind raced, taking leave to study Derek's body with a tailor's eye. Already, designs were blossoming in his mind, intricately embroidered satin panels with delicate boning and custom laces following the long lines of his firm body. He then looked back at serious Dom before him, eyes roaming  over him as well.
"Come on," he sniffed and wiped away a stray tear. "Help me with him."
Jake made a helpless gesture towards him, his reddish brown hair flopping unto his face. "I can't believe you Obi-Wan. Come on, get back in the car."
He felt cold.
And… It’s not like he wouldn’t see Stiles tomorrow right?
The Captain and his guard were waiting near the same place they’d first met and Anthony’s mark tingled at the sight of the man. His heart did a funny blip in his chest and he ruthlessly squashed it. He had no use for hope. No use for the squishy emotions Virginia described on days when he felt stretched thin.
His hand reached down to cup Riddick’s crotch, giving it a gentle squeeze
Heart racing, she went on to the next step of her plan without as much as a pause for breath. Palming the shiv and tucking the handle into her overlarge sleeve, she made her way towards the row of poorer town houses across bus route 6.
Stiles stomach flopped and his eyes stung. Derek sighed tiredly and reached over, grasping around before snagging Stiles’ scarred hand.
Fucking bounty hunters.
This was gooey, messy, emotional people stuff that he didn’t know what to do about. Couldn’t throw money at and hope it went away or got better.
The hand on his elbow jerked but stayed where it was, though the touch was a little more tentative. “Uh… Hammer? Really?” the voice sounded a little choked. “I can’t really see it. You and Justin hammer?”
He hugged himself, not against the actual cold but against a cold growing inside him, sitting on his chest like lead. He watched numbly as the local LEOs brought out the last of the cult members either in hand cuffs or in body bags. CPS was on the scene, seeing to the kids they'd managed to recover. Much fewer than had been recorded missing though. Much, much fewer.
He frowned as he checked around his quarters. Frowned as he checked the common room, the kitchen and the Gym. Frowned as he failed to see hide nor hair of the wonderfully soft and comfortable jacket.
When Xander could finally speak again he gave a weak laugh.
He wanted to see the man puttering around the lab in one of his old army jerseys or bare chested with Steve’s dog tags around his neck, bright against his darker skin.
"Okay darling," came the muffled reply. "Visiting hours are at four. Don't forget."
Duo liked the solitary life though. yeah, he enjoyed talking and socializing as much as the other guy but for the past few years, he'd appreciated the long silences of space. He made sure to keep in contact and put in for his down time though, whenever the quiet got too stifling or the nightmares too real.
"Everyone on this god forsaken city can go take a long walk off the shortest pier." The genius mumbled against his mate's chest. "If one more person complains about some unimportant piece of tripe while I'm trying not to let this city sink to the bottom of the fucking ocean, I'm going to beach the city on the mainland and see how they like living on a mudflat."
What the shit.
The genius huffed. "Who taught you about R&R?"
She was grinning so hard that her cheeks were starting to hurt.
“I mean like who wouldn’t notice a totally hot guy turning into a complete derp whenever they’re together. Dalton practically has heart eyes whenever he sees Max. I’m sure everyone else in the pack has noticed it.”
"Looks like it's just you and me tonight, boy."
The voice was warm and clear and he tears up at the affection that was laced through it.
"Stiles, that's the King you're talking about."
Anthony quirked a skeptical brow at the word 'guest' but tentatively took the fabric and shrugged it on. It was thick and heavy and kept the cold from him from his chin straight down to brush against his feet. It felt a bit like donning his armor and that gave him an odd sense of comfort.
The elevator door's opened and she stepped out confidently. The tall blonde sitting on a nearby pile of gear looked up with a sneer then did a double take, almost tumbling out of the careless sprawl he'd been effecting.
From his vantage point, high above the forge, Anthony could faintly hear the screams of the fleeing citizens of the usually idyllic farming community situated snugly around the base of the forge. He’d already dispatched some of the Legion to help evacuate, guiding people into the arms of local peace keepers.
Ringed grey horns curled delicately from beneath the hood, studded with delicate gold filigree jewelry that could not have possibly been made by human hands.
Spencer didn't know what to say to that so he stayed silent.
The man in question was writing something into a large ledger, his stern mouth and stern jaw carved of stone. Spencer stood at the centre of the antique Prussian rug where Rossi directed him and waited patiently to be acknowledged. This was no place to demand attention.
Shika had just muttered. "Troublesome." and had let Naruto lead him back to that shitty apartment; Kiba following along having sent Akamaru on his own way.
Steve didn’t even hear the rest of what the voice was saying because his brain had stuttered to a stop. His heart as well. He swayed on the spot.  “One thou…. Thousand dollars?”
Here he could just be Anthony, just a man with a big heart who loved his people dearly. A man with driving need to learn and fix and build new and better things with his hands and with his genius intellect. A man with a soul mark that wasn’t supposed to exist and a true love that he would never be allowed to know.
"I like it. You'll stay here while you craft them. We will send someone to get the things you need from your studio. You will cancel all other clients."
Stiles let out a huge sigh, yanking the ski mask from his face and letting his head fall back to breathe in the night air. After taking a a couple of sweet lungfuls, he turned his head towards a smirking Heather. "What's the deal with the ooglie boogie that got all our flea bags up in a tizzy? That all wrapped up as yet?"
Her brother awoke to her hand holding his and he smiled through his spilt lip, the heart monitor beeping softly in the background.
He cupped Ronon's face, rubbing his thumb against the flaking dried blood and pressed a finely trembling kiss to his slack mouth.
They told him the apartment was haunted. That no one had ever spent more than six months there before they either moved out, ran out or had to be carried out in straight jacket by burly men in white coats. Wufei didn't believe any of it, naturally. The last one was utterly ridiculous.
He bounced on the balls of his feet, smiling under his mask as his seconds, growled and braced for battle. He flashed his red eyes at hers, running his tongue over his fangs in anticipation for the feel of flesh tearing , the taste of hot and sticky blood across his tongue and down his throat.
Scott exhaled loudly. "Wow. That's mercenary."
"Am I boring you?" The deep voice startled him and he flinched, cursing himself for not paying better attention. He looked up into sharp blue eyes and held their gaze. "I guess you must find our dark little corner of the planet primitive compared to the bright shining future you've known."
"No No No No No, baby come on, no." he pleaded with the car, pressing on the gas as the car slowed and a bunch warning lights started popping up on the dash.
Scott happily obliged, eager to speak at length about the beautiful young woman who had captured his heart.
Tony heard someone sobbing softly, only realizing after a while that the person was him. Steve's blue eyes were still concerned but Tony kissed him hungrily to assuage his fears.
He’d failed. Yet again he’d failed. He ducked his head away from the light as he tried his distress show on his face, his heart beating like a rabbit behind his ribs. Taking several deep and slow breaths, he stood just under the single dim light and tried to concentrate on how he was going to get out of this.
Tony started to shake his head but Pride just frowned and shook the coat in his hand.
“Yeah, that’s why she’s so fucking badass.” Stiles chuckled. “I totally ship Max and Dalton though but man, that slow burn is killing me. Get them together already. Max needs to catch a fucking clue seriously. He’s totally oblivious to Dalton’s angsty pining.”
Despite his usual level of annoyance with the bleach blond vampire, Xander had considered himself lucky that Spike had been along for the trip when things had gone pear shaped. The demon had sniffed out the situation early and had the secured resources that kept them safe and defended while most of the rest of humanity ran around in blind panic.
“Not just yet I reckon. As I said, it’s not every day that a fella gets to meet THE Riddick… in the flesh.”
"Till this earth ends or we do…. We will carry on."
Tony hadn't spoken another word as he threw the garbage bags full of clothes into the junker T'Challa deigned to lend him, and drove off without a look back. He was just about to wail the last strains of the classic song when the piece of shit car started making weird scraping noises.
The man was close. Too close for Anthony's comfort as well as the peace of mind of his guard. Anthony could see them tensing out of the corner of his eyes, the brunet making an aborted step forward before carefully pulling back.
The jersey was comfortable and smelled good just like the coat did. Pressing the cuff of the sleeve against his mouth, he took in a deep breath, savouring the smell and grateful for the absence of pain or rattling in his scarred lungs.
Maybe it was because he wasn't putting himself between a grouchy Gibbs and them anymore. It was time they grew up and dealt with the 'Second B for Bastard' on their own. Still, despite nothing coming from it work wise, Tony was glad for the opportunity to have met the sweet and smart Dr. Quintero.
"Yeah," he agreed, nipping at Tony's plump and pouting bottom lip. "I can dig that."
He felt cold all over, even with the thick coat and he was certain that his face had blanched white.
His orgasm flowed over him seamlessly, ecstasy  washing over him in deep waves as his vision slowly went white. He could feel Steve shuddering against him, that familiar heat spreading deep within his as his lover came with a stuttering grunt.
He was just about to respond to her verbally, coughing against the smoke when a burning pain lanced along his shoulders. A long heavy beam had fallen and was pinning him down. He gave a strangled yell, unable to get his hands under him to push up against the weight.  He heard both Karen's and Tony's voices over the comm but couldn't get in enough breath to reply. He coughed harder, the smoke in the room was getting thicker, ash covering the floor and what of his uniform he could see,
Stiles pulled at the zipper of his hoodie. “Thought you would be with the rest of the pack?”
“You didn’t fail us, you know.” Virginia’s voice was soft in the vast chamber. “No one expected the Penumbra dogs to actually take down a Solar Forge. They are nigh fortresses.”
The genius wiped at his forehead with his shirt sleeve and frowned at the big alien leading them down the path. "Come on Ronon…. We've been walking for over an hour now. When are we going to get to this awesome, must see, paradise anyway?"
Ever since he’d learned of the things that went bump in the night, he’d expected the demon apocalypse, the vampire apocalypse or even the magic gone wrong apocalypse. He’d braced himself for the end whenever the next big bad rolled into town and wanted to turn the world inside out, making his piece with the world before wading into battle once more.
Over that when the pretty green sweater dress that she'd gotten for her birthday. It fell to her knees and looked lovely with the matching tartan scarf. She shoved her feet into the clunky boots she wasn't often seen without, much to her fashion forward family's frustration.
His mouth was open, he was sure. He was also sure that he couldn’t care less if he looked like a complete derp. This was an event the likes of which he would never see again in his lifetime. Maybe even in humanities lifetime. He barely registered when Derek’s arm slipped around him, tugging him close against that firm, warm body.
Somewhat mollified, Rodney dug into one of the pockets of his vest, pulling out six little silver packets, handing one each to John and Teyla, two to Ronon and kept two for himself.
His father had been one of the last to make the trip though the Steep Pass to bring her glowing heart stone to where it would glow forever. If the heart stone was not freed by fire and it's glow allowed to slowly die within the body; the heart song would be lost forever.
Xander mock growled weakly tried to buck the vamp off him and only succeeded his rubbing his ass into the other man’s crotch. The hands at his waist held him still. Spike’s breath was hot against his neck as he pressed his obvious erection into the cleft of Xander’s ass cheeks.
“It’s permanent. We’ve tried everything. I’m okay with it.”
They were all staring at him, eyes cold and hands on their weapons. They were right to do so. To have an unknown like him so close to their leader was taunting danger and the three seemed to be well aware of it, despite the Captain's relaxed demeanor. Rhodes would have never let an enemy within a hundred feet of him and then only through thick sheets of  lucent glass and a squadron of the Legion.
No one in the Citadel believed that the Solar Forges would ever fall. Just as the Iron King sat on the Rex Solaris, so would the Sunlight Kingdom ever prosper. Anthony on the other hand, was a pragmatist. Expect the best, Prepare for the worst. He had to be the one to look beyond the obvious, to stand against the encroaching darkness.
“The poet in me would kiss you breathless, making sure you never want or need to leave my arms.” Spike’s teeth scrapped against the soft skin of his neck and Xander shuddered with shocked pleasure. “The demon in me would thow you down right here and claim you, pushing that little slip of cloth to one side and fucking that sweet ass deep until you screamed my name. You’d be mine and mine alone and I’d never fucking let you go.”
"Take it. Wear it." the captain gestured to the clothing. "I won't have guest freeze to death in my humble home."
"You think including Allison will be to his benefit?"
The passenger seat was empty, it's door hanging open; the tread of unsteady footsteps leading around and around until heading deeper into the woods. As if the person had been wandering around in the mist and never found their way. They never found Candy's body.
He wasn't sure that he was that far gone yet. Still, he loved his little ship and the freedom it granted him. in fact, he'd heard stories about the terraforming being done on Mars and if it weren't for the few bonds he still had to earth and her colonies, he might have signed up for a ten year stint on the red planet. That was a thought to turn over in his mind for a later date though. now was the time for seeing what little treasures the L5 graveyard still held for a sweeper like him.
Tony was still trembling when Steve tucked him against his side, pulling up the sheets to cover them both. He felt tears pool in the dip in Steve's collar bone, the feeling of being utterly loved and cared for bowling him over completely.
He gave a soft sigh of relief and tugged the material snugly around his body. After so long, he finally felt warm again. Smoothing his hand down the front of the coat, he looked up to see those amused blue eyes again and scowled in response.
-------------------------
Riddick woke to darkness, his head ringing and feeling as if it were floating on a string above him.
They hatched a plan to get her away from her awful fate, recruiting the help of a young werewolf boy named Remus to spirit Lily away to the north, through the deepest woods and into the kingdom of Nimue where she could be welcomed and cared for. They bade each other a tearful goodbye and he watched them disappear into the trees.
One of the blue lights grazed his side and took out the power for half his suit half his suit, the suddenly dead weight making him fall from the sky like a stone. As he spun, struggling to regain control, he instructed three of the Legion to peel away from the conflict and head back to the Citadel. They needed to report to his General. Four more of the remaining Legion came to him, bracing his suit and slowing his speed until they all hit the ground with a crash.
He tilted his head insolently. "Or are you forgetting the treaty you signed in blood, Alpha Hale?"
Finally, fed up with his stoic silence yet seemingly reluctant to harm him physically; they took him to an empty room and closed the door behind him.
“Please tell me that the ‘Dawn of the Wolf Trilogy’ is your brain child and that the three main protagonists are inspired by you me and Lydia. I fucking love that shit, dude!”
Thus it had always been and thus it would ever be.
On the third day, just when all seemed truly lost, there came a cry of hope. The comet wasn’t going to slam right into the planet, as previously determined, to send the human kind the same way as the dinosaur. No, the fucker was going to skip across the atmosphere like a stone across a pond and get flung away into space to continue along its merry way.
Her smile turned into a sly little grin behind her fringe.
Mates and Male Child Bearers AU
"Allison said that the Dragon Lancers are shooting anyone caught on the path on sight. Which is crazy because it's been like, twenty years since there's been dragon sign at the Pass."
Spencer did not allow his eyes to linger more than a second on the Sub. He didn't want to know what happened to people who angered a Dom like Hotchner by looking at his collared submissive. Instead, he concentrated on the carved front of the man's desk and waited for him to speak.
"You're always gushing about so I decided to give it a try." She ducked her head with a smile, her hand careful of the wires and tubes as she twisted her hand to show off the holo effect. "I kinda like it."
“He gave the general an order.” She spun to face him, her hand flung towards Anthony. “HE gave the first general of Rex Solaris an order. The only person who can do that is….”
Tony shrugged, finally able to show some feeling in the safety of his private chambers. “We lost North Pass. In the end, that’s on me.”
Stiles cackled gleefully. Oh, yeah. This Halloween was going to be epic.
The air was searing hot and black smoke and ash clogged the filters of his mask, he could hear Karen calling for him and he tried once again to heave the large beam off his back. The beam creaked and bent a little but wouldn't give, somehow braced against some other metal framework. He grunted, straining fruitlessly against the beam once again, tears forming in his eyes from the acrid smoke.
He locked his knees together to keep from falling, forcing himself to watch as the only home he'd ever known burned. He was chieftain now. It was his duty to bear witness to what had come to pass.
"Lydia told me. Speaking of Lydia. Weren't you, like, in love with her for years or something?"
The apartment was nice enough, bare bones with old furniture that was more retro than vintage. Weird green and mustard colored chairs and ugly dark wood. It looked like it came out of the 1970s. There were a few attempts to modernize but they all seemed half finished or abandoned as if the person got fed up or gave up in the middle.
James Potter and Sirius Black were sons of Lords and spoiled rotten, glutted on the fruits of other's labour and Lily was utterly distraught at the prospect of being his wife and the mother of his children.
They are half way out of the catacombs when Scott asked, "How did you get Lahey to let us in without raising the alarm anyway? That guy is so intense."
Stiles made a 'meh' sound. "Kinda why I went for instant gratification with Hale. And sucking his brains out through his cock allowed me enough access to the guard house to sneak into the records room and find out where my dad was buried."
"Please don’t tell me that this is one of your stupid movies plots." The silver haired man rolled his eyes. "You think that shit is so clever but  all you do is waste our time. Do your job and follow the leads that actually go somewhere."
October 6th - Panties
"I love you." Rodney whispered against Ronon's skin as he came, "I love you so fucking much. You don't even know."
…………………………………………………
With a nod and a tip of his empty cup, he wandered back toward the kitchen and rinsed his cup, turning over to dry on the rack. Before stepping unto the elevator, he gave one last long glance towards the lonely figure, framed by the tall windows, silent and still against the querulous clouds.
Just how Spencer had come to meet the man face to face was all Garcia's fault. He'd made her a corset for special presentation with her Sub Emily and the woman had been singing his praises ever since.
"Sanctimonious bitch." he growled as he ran the preserve, feet swift and silent amongst the yellow red carpet of fallen leaves. "Sending along a fucking summons like a king on her throne. Too fucking high and mighty to just call me herself."
The Grimm Twins were the boogie men of Bounty Hunters. Smart, ruthless and relentless, the bounty hunting brother and sister duo were a force to be reckoned with and only took their pick of jobs. They were expensive as fuck but that was because they were just that good.
He glared back at her, hunched into the seat with his arms crossed tightly over his chest. He wasn't one for confrontation but Candy was being especially bitchy for the whole trip. In fact, she'd all but brow beat them all into spending their long weekend making this god forsaken trip instead of going down to the lake for some sun, sea and sand.
Teyla was doing graceful strokes, the clear waters sluicing off her firm, naked body as she cut through the water. Ronon could see the holster of his knife, dark against his thigh and he ducked under the water a few times to get his locks wet through.
And if they didn't and came knocking on his door, looking to disturb his lover's well deserved rest before his 24 hours  were over? Well, he'd make sure that they understood just how stupid of an idea that was.
Thankfully they'd had more than a month's warning from the city, when what seemed to be meteorological labs had powered up all by themselves. Seeing that the city hadn't done that kind of thing before, Rodney had made it a top priority and set a crack team of scientists on it immediately.
Kiba had missed him something fierce, throwing himself into work and his clan to smother the pain of being apart. He loved Shika and he knew the shadow nin loved him but there was something missing from them both because their third wasn't there.
“Yeah, I’m into books myself. I use a dictation software and have a great editor.”
After the day he’d had, he could do with something sweet … and hot.
He knew every piece of his wardrobe well so when things went missing, he noticed. He frowned at his closet, eyes snagging on the gap in his coats where his Moroshka sweater jacket by VINGIL usually hung.
Dwayne's shoulder was warm against his and he watched the man's fingers as he started to play. His voice was warm and smooth as well aged scotch.
He coughed as he huddled against the metal chest plate, taking comfort in the hum of the arc reactor. They thudded down unto a nearby roof and his mask was peeled off, the night air cool against his hot and sweaty skin. Tony's voice was calm and comforting as a snick and click sounded from his suit. a molded cup placed over his nose and mouth.
“The King is dead.” He said clearly, surprising almost everyone in the room. “Long live the Iron King, Divine Hand of Sol.”
Rodney was making faces at the water and Ronon swam over. The genius was examining a piece of smooth stone which looked dull in his palm but when he pulled it under water, it began to glow.
He placed the second cup on the small table near the arm of the chair without a word, just making sure that it was in clear view and within reach. There was no reaction. Well, he didn’t expect much of one. The sky rumbled as he approached the windows, his breath skipping a bit as the clouds seemed to press down upon the city like the lid of casket slowly closing.
Then good ol' Bucky had come back, a winged and wounded veteran, fresh from the desert with big wide bambi eyes that Steve could never resist. The clincher was that Tony had been the last to know.
If he booked it he would make it in time for a late supper. Maybe a little mulled wine for after. Maybe a little something more.
"Not even if it means saving innocent lives?" she tried for sympathy and motherly compassion. She failed.
"Say it for me again."
He kissed around the fresh bandage stuck along Stiles' flank, tentative fingertips gliding along the edge of the rough gauze. He whined a little at the scent of blood and Stiles grunted and ran fingers through Derek's hair comfortingly.
Steve grinned, the taste of thousand dollar a glass scotch on his tongue, the soft feel of a suit that probably cost more than his yearly salary under his fingertips, the smell of exclusive men’s cologne in his nose.
As Peter liked to tease her as he gently braided her frizzy hair for school, trying to build up both their spirits to face another day in the hell that was high school. "You always gotta look out for the quiet ones. They are always the bigger threat. Still waters run pretty deep."
Erik smiled back at him.
Still, they both were two of the most pure hearted and optimistic people he knew so they probably had more of a chance than others would.
Steve blushed pink at the teasing words. “Be serious though. How can you give Bucky an arm?”
Warning: Panic Attacks. Cheating.
Anthony repeated the mantra to himself as the mark high on his inner thigh gave a tingle. It did that now and then, too often for something that supposedly didn’t exist. He shifted minutely in his armor, pressing his mark against the inner workings of the suit and kept all expression off his face.
It hadn't been a successful one, the Forge’s fortified defenses hardly affected by the attack but the fact that the frequency of incursions from the penumbra had increased incrementally was very worrying.
He ignored it, rocking into his mate as he chased his own release. Zelenka and Biro could surely handle whatever problem had cropped up. Whoever was calling would soon get tired of trying to get Rodney and call one of the other two.
She'd waited until she'd gone back to the small recovery room she'd been assigned to to cry her eyes out. That was all she gave herself. One night to throw a pity party and be sorry for herself. The next day she'd signed all the relevant paperwork and been scheduled for her first fitting.
Doctor Lamar Quintero shook Tony's hand with a smile, blushing at Tony's charm as he lead the agent through one of the long storage halls of the Department of Entomology towards the smaller labs at the back. Tony goggled at the ceiling high shelves stacked with boxes upon boxes of specimens.
His eyes had filled up and all the righteous anger he'd been feeling at All American hypocrite and liar Steve Rogers his long lost ex, Bucky; had bled away into heartbreak.
The man grinned in return, leaning in close but not close enough for Riddick to lunge forward and rip out the man’s neck with his teeth. This one was smart.
He flushed, ducking his head a bit, much to her surprise and Ace's delight.
“You can call me Steve.”
"We had to show you how serious this is." the other man grunted. "We don't have time for your usual drama queen hysterics."
"Good. As long as we get our usual cut" Stiles thinned his lips, looking into the forest where the wolves had disappeared. He shook his head once again in disgust. "Self righteous fuckers."
"Whadya want Alpha Hale?" he stood feet apart, shoulders relaxed, hands shoved into the deep pockets of his hoodie.  "This better be important. I'm missing out on the Doctor Who season finale and I love me some David Tennant."
"I'm sorry too." he said softly, "I should have thought of that… with how you died and all. So… ah… are both of you still here… together … or is it just.."
Comets | Mindless
"Oh, you know me do you Nicky?" Tony's fingers paused in his typing as he looked up at them through his fringe of hair, before he started typing once more. "You know me so well that you come in to my building, my office and try to blackmail me into doing what you want?"
The mission to Whiskey Outpost on Planet P had been a cluster fuck, literally. The place had been crawling with bugs. They'd barely gotten away, after losing both the General they'd been sent to rescue and Lt. Rasczak, the surviving soldiers racing to the shuttle that had come to retrieve them.
The ladies at the jungle were a god send, taking him under wing and showing his the ins and outs of making up his face and putting on his wig.
After that, it was quick work to get the drop on the rest of the crew and they too, were secured and stowed in the back of the large cab. The sight of the legionnaire surprised them, the captives drawing back from it whenever it went near them.
It was a jewel blue 100% wool Chunky knit cardigan that pepper had bought him for his birthday that he didn’t want to google the price of because there was pricey and then there was Pepper and Tony’s version of pricey.
The blond straightened up and gave a deep sigh, realizing how well and truly fucked he was. With one last, lingering glance at the sleeping engineer, he nodded his head and strode from the workshop with a determined step; plans already forming in his head.
Rossi's hands were warm and calloused, taking Spencer's pale one within both of his. As he leaned forward, Spence could make out the dark gleam of a shoulder holster. He did not let his surprise show though. He'd done his research when the call had first come in.
The soldier stood abruptly, turned on his heel and strode away, leaving Anthony to redress with trembling hands. His face flamed as he clenched his fists on his thighs, his body shaking with boiling rage and icy shame. How dare they? How dare they demand that of him? He bitterly regretted not fighting against it but knew that having his body forcefully stripped would have been worse than death. Damn his logical and rational mind. He wanted to scream and break something. He wanted to find that metal handed soldier and break his jaw with his fists. He wanted to find that blond captain and….
He pulled in a deep breath, the oxygen cool and sweet to his nose and throat. Tony's face plate snapped up, revealing his concerned face. He blinked up at the man, grasping at the little oxygen tube as Karen activated his suit built in coolant.  There was no smoke blocking the sky, they must have been upwind of the fire; and the stars twinkled happily down on him. He glanced back at Tony and curled against the warm chest plate, away from the chill of the wind that had picked up. Arms came up to hold him close and he relaxed into the hold.
The Iron King has no heart. The Iron King has no soul.
He'd packed his bag in a rage, screaming and crying at Steve who'd stood in the doorway stone faced. His parting words had stunned Tony mute.
Some soldier called out "Attention on Deck" and the other squaddies scrambled to attention. She turned her head, taking in the man striding toward her. Johnny looked older somehow, more stern and hardened. She'd read up on all the reports from Planet P and about his rescue mission to save Carmen from the Brain bug.
"One's whose soul intertwines with mine."
"They actually shot most of that movie in Harlaxton Manor in England" The dish water blond rolled her eyes and said snootily, annoyed at being called by her full name. "That's a whole ocean away. Besides, people survived that. Catherine Zeta Jones and that older guy. The one from Taken."
“Oh Stiles” Derek sounded heart broken. Stiles just shook his head.
He took care of them, he treasured them. He paid attention to the little tags with washing instructions and had long conversations with the JARVIS as well as the Tower’s laundry service staff.
“Rude.” Stiles pouted, flopping sideways unto the back of the couch. He hooked one arm over the back and pulled one leg up. “I will have you know that it’s my research boner as you call it that allows me to be my own boss these days. People pay a pretty penny for information these days.”
The little Vauxhall Viva was wrapped around a massive tree, having slammed head first into the thing.  Poor Eugené had been thrown clear, her lithe dancer's body crumpled on the peat moss covered ground. Jake had suffered an awful fate, his lanky frame crushed by the dashboard as it had been pushed back by the heavy engine block.
Looked like Scotty boy was just as big of a coward as ever. Stiles had long ago stopped feeling the betrayal of having his best friend turn away from him. The deep cut of Scott rejecting him as a monster then skipping joyfully to the very wolves who'd been responsible for it all for the bite.  Now all Stiles felt was a numbing indifference where the crooked jawed boy was concerned. That turned out to be a good thing because people whom Stiles felt negatively toward usually ended up suffering… a lot.
He'd ended up hurt and bleeding while Scott had been sheepishly sorry. Derek had bitten the inside of his mouth to bleeding to keep from roaring at the witless wolf.
Virginia would dress all in white with the rest of the maids, the councilors, the senators and they would make the slow procession down to the hall of kings where an empty tomb would be carved with his name.  He knew that Rhodes would mourn him, that Virginia and even Happy would cry a tear for his loss. The rest of the kingdom, they would be rejoice that there was a new Iron King stepping up to protect them. To be the divine hand of a merciful Sol.
"Mr. Rossi, Good afternoon." Spencer stood sharply, deftly tugging on the fitted bone and grey corset vest; smoothing the material flat before reaching out a hand.  "I appreciate the call."
Ok. i am really enjoying my little Ronon/Rodney Stories. they seem to all be in the same universe somehow. i may end up posting them together in a different story.
"Oh, it's a month and a half from now. Don't worry, you've got plenty of time." Rossi piped up, no doubt trying to be reassuring.
Ronon chuckled, rubbing his hands up and down his lover's broad back, trailing a line of soft, open mouthed kisses down Rodney's cheek, jaw until he claimed that pouting mouth.
“Really? Nothing at all?”
Well, most of the time. Rodney was still light years ahead of Ronon and spoke in such terms that sounded like music to the man's ears but made no sense whatsoever.
"Di Na Nwunye."
"Told you it would be worth the walk." He brushed his shoulder against the other man's, leaning in low to speak against the shell of his ear. Rodney nodded slowly, his eyes wandering up to the twin suns that hung high in the sky.
Steve spun to face the owner of the voice and stared, stunned. The man was beautiful, dark haired, bright eyes and utterly beautiful. He was also looking at Steve with genuine concern, something Steve hadn’t encountered in a stranger in a long fucking time.
"Indeed. This one has balls." Hotchner's lip gave a small curl, his eyes glinting with interest. "Makes me wonder why some opportunistic Dom hasn't put a collar on him yet."
That made him laugh and he pulled her into a hug.
Ronon had stayed on the city because Rodney had stayed. The rest of his team had stayed as well, though others came and went. He loved the rain personally. He loved the sound of it on the windows and along the piers. He loved how it looked on the slick grey metal of the city as well as how it blossomed into little yellow florets when it hit the activated shield.
The next thing he knew he was sobbing, heaving breaths felt like lead as he broke down completely. It was all just too fucking much all at once. He couldn't handle it.
“Why would you do that? How would you even do that?” Steve found himself gaping even harder. “Why would you help us?”
Ezan flushed with anger and looked a Jake who was already shaking his head.
Warnings: Horror/ Suspense?
Rodney wasn't ready for that, maybe he never would be. Ronon would never push. Bringing new life to Pegasus was a hard decision, one to be made by the bearer in the end. But if they did had children, born to them both and raised on Atlantis with Rodney's brains and Ronon's strength; he knew in his heart of hearts that they would be survivors.
They’d stood like that for a few long moments before letting go and abruptly parting ways. There were so many things unsaid in that simple motion, so many hopes and wishes and maybe even farewells. A soldier’s life walked step by step with death. A King’s life even more so.
There had been the excitement when his cousin Luna had been chosen by her name sake, the youngest and smallest of them bonding with the ethereal sea green flyer with a wingspan one and a half of any other steed  within the eclipse.
The rain looked pretty against the city's shield, even though they only had it up for a few hours a day. Even with the ZPMs they did have, they couldn't afford to run them down over a bit of rain. Well, not a bit of rain per say but a solid two weeks of steady downpour.
He was startled out of his musings when the door slammed open, the large brunet stomping in. “Take off your fucking clothes.”
Moments passed with no movement of the letters so he took that as a yes and proceeded to clean up the broken lamp and the disrupted shrine. He still left the pictures and the flowers and some of the sweets he could salvage. He got rid of the oil and the incense, anything to do with fire and flame.
He also craved Kiba's hands on him, loved the scrape of his teeth and the soothing rough of his tongue as they trailed along the quickly fading red marks. When they were not training or heading out on missions, they spent together in Naruto's shitty apartment or in Kiba's rooms at the compound.
"SHEILD doesn't bluff about things like this." Fury gave him a narrow glare before shaking his head in over acted disappointment and pushing himself out of the chair. "You are going to regret this Stark."
He had a quick breakfast of protein and vitamin shake, munching on the edible globule container after for fiber, as he checked over the cockpit. He was right in position. He quickly did a scan of the debris field around the ship and, taking manual control, eased into the shadow of a huge curved hunk of colony; setting his ships orbit to match the slowly rotating mass of burnt and warped metal.
They made their way across the rocky landscape carefully with goggles that he’d jury-rigged from the optics of one of the fallen legion. They were crude and did not fit well on his head but they allowed him to see well enough in the dark. The way was treacherous and slow, deep ravines and sharp cliffs appearing out of nowhere to claim their lives.
Steve was still staring at the tanned hand, pricey watch and black cuffs of his tailored suit when the bartender responded. “One glass of Clemment’s Old Charter coming right up sir.”
Ronon only nodded as they descended into the gate room and Rodney started dialing. He recognized that address and frowned. The genius spoke before he could protest though.
Naru made an adorable sleepy sound and snuggled deeper, snuffling softly into Kiba's shoulder as his eyes fluttered shut. Kiba traded fond looks with Shika over the tanned shoulder and smirked as the other man pressed a fond kiss against said shoulder. Naruto just murmured sleepily and threw a leg over Kiba's, his hand seeking Shika's and pulling it to his taut stomach.
Stiles looked up from his crumpled piece of parchment and gave him best friend a fond smile. "You know I do, Scotty."
Looks like there may have been one last miracle after all.
Anthony let himself shrug. “My life was forfeit the moment I fell to the shadow. Another Iron King will take my place and sit on Rex Solaris. Another will be Righteous and Divine Hand of great Sol and don the holy armor as Protector of the sunlight kingdom. Thus it has always been and thus it will ever be.”
A thumb came up to gently wipe away the tear tracks on his face and he let his eyes fall closed. Derek’s kaleidoscope eyes were full of raw emotion when they met his and in that moment something changed between them. Something soft and warm and integral had blossomed anew.
"What… no thank you?" The captain's lip twitched at the corners. "Tough crowd."
Unfortunately, his Dad had to go into the Sheriff’s office to keep the peace in the wake of the latest announcement, Melissa had been called into the hospital because it was all hands on deck at the ER. And Scotty…. Scotty would rather spend the night having ‘thank god we’re not going to die’ sex with his lady love.
Legs intertwined, socked feet tucked up against bare ones, breaths mingling and evening out. Blanket snug around them and the cold of bad weather kept out by tempered glass and JARVIS’ watchful eye.
Once he had his lover warm, dry and sated, he lifted his lover by the hips and lowered him inch by inch unto his hard cock. Rodney keened against him, grasping at his shoulders and back as they were so intimately joined. With the steady pour of the rain outside their windows, the warmth of the heater, the soft touch of the nest and the wet, sucking heat of Rodney around him, Ronon knew true happiness.
Tony had lunch with Seeley, discussing some of the cases they'd both encountered and cultivating a friendship that Tony truly appreciated and cherished. Booth was a smart and experienced agent and respected tony on a professional level that he'd been lacking  lately in his own work place.
For now, he was happy. And that was more than he'd ever thought a gundam pilot would be.
He would do his duty to his people and see the rebel scum utterly destroyed by Sol's wrathful gaze.
Rodney had been one of the firs to suss him out, after Teyla of course. He'd waited until Ronon was balls deep inside of him and half way to losing his mind in pleasure before going in for the kill.
They made a love a few more times, Ronon working his mate's body until the man was weeping and begging for release. Kisses were sweet and sticky of pineapple and the jam filled pastries and Ronon smiled and licked along the row of hickeys he'd sucked along Rodney's inner thighs.
“And you’re going into the prosthetic business just like that?” Steve couldn’t seem to parse what was going on.
The battle was short and brutal, the bombardment from below heavy and unceasing. He lost too many of his Iron Legion, just a fraction of them still intact by the end. He swore a streak at himself violently in his helm, cursing his own hubris and stupidity. Yet again he’d fallen into the trap of underestimating the enemy.
"I see that we will not come to an accord with this. I withdraw my petition. The treaty still stands."
Shika shifted, guiding his cock to the blond's open and panting mouth. Naruto was too happy to suck on the engorged organ, licking the leaking and swollen mushroom head before taking more of the veined shaft. Kiba let his hands roam, petting and stoking that sun gold skin as both men worked their cocks deeper. He pulled Shika close and claimed his mouth, making them both moan as they rocked into the blond from both ends.
She slowed to a walk, keeping her cap low and imitating a swagger as she made her way to the sixth house. The doorbell was loud and jarring but she kept her finger on it until it slammed open, a cloud of marijuana smoke billowing out in a giant plume.
Clint was pretty pragmatic about clothes. Function over form with clothes that looked like shit but were comfortable as shit. Thor on the other hand, thought human fashion was hilarious and treated it all like a huge joke with his fluffy pink robes and casual nudity.
He arranged them in his closet just so, shrugging when Tony teased him about being a bit anal about it. It wasn’t just his time in the military that drove his need for neatness and order, he’d always been like that; even as a child.
He was wearing Erik's old MIT shirt, it was large on him and came down to Tony's mid-thigh. He looked cuddly and adorable in it, not that he would ever tell the smaller man that to his face. Tony was sensitive about his height, even though he enjoyed tucking himself against Erik's chin as he snuggled to watch a movie.
the other chapters were inspired by this next picture inspiration and by now i've blown all the word count requirements of the challenge but i'm just enjoying this too damn much to care.
"You ain't wrong, baby brother. You ain't wrong."
She'd made sure that he wouldn't be home, stealing Cindy Wazouwski's phone during chemistry class and texting him to come meet her for a hook up at a motel two hours away.
Anthony scoffed softly. “We still are. Knowing changed nothing.”
"Yeah? What are we doing tomorrow Brain?"
Stiles drained the last of his third beer and burped loudly, the sound echoing into the quiet of the night around him. His feet shifted, sneakers squeaking on the hood of his jeep as he tossed the empty unto the grass to join the others strewn around. He’d pick them up later, probably, whatever.
Rodney ground out a terse few words the tossed his comm unit across the room with s snarl. His tablet got flung unto the thin padded frame of Ronon's bunk and he walked straight into his lover's arms without breaking stride. Ronon grunted as he braced for impact, wrapping his arms around the other man as Rodney smushed his face into Ronon's massive pecks.
What had really killed him was that none of his so called family seemed to care that his heart had been ripped out and stomped on mercilessly. They had all circled around Bucky, leaving Tony alone and in the cold.
Holding him carefully, Ronon rolled them until he was on his back, Rodney  sitting astride him. Bracing his hands on his mate's hips and making sure that Rodney had his hands steady on Ronon's chest; he started fucking up into his mate steadily, keeping his strokes slow and deep.
He let out a deep breath. It's frustrating as hell but I can't think of anything else that can knock some sense into him. I love Scotty but a road scholar he isn't."
"How did you even get the map to the forgotten path over the cliffs? I'm sure that the King would have had those destroyed years ago."
Kiba had shaken the water off like one of the clan dogs and grabbed the blond's hand with a grin, both taking off to the rooftops as the ninken howled behind them. Shika was easy to find at his usual cloud watching place and Kiba laughed as Naruto tackled him bodily, sending both of them tumbling.
It wasn't the most lucrative of sites but Duo was one of the smaller outfits run out of the sweepers. His ship, named Cerberus because of the three powerful rockets to the back, was a small to medium sized ship, enough for a crew of one to handle. If that one was a crack pilot/ engineer/ gunner/scavenger former gundam pilot.
Dizzy was one of the best characters in Starship Troopers and should not have died. i've watched this scene a few times and think that i've done a okay job in giving an alternative.
As Scott shrunk back and glanced timidly as his alpha, Stiles turned his cold gaze back to her. "Are you done wasting our time now, Talia?" He drew out her name, the open mocking in his voice making her wolves bristle with anger. Not that he gave a fuck what they felt towards him anyway.
The blond nodded at one of the rebels and soon enough there was a thick, dark coat being offered to Anthony. He stared at the garment for a few second before looking up at the other man in confusion.
Then the Jetta turned the corner and went out of sight.
Stiles would understand right? I mean, he could come with them. Scott was sure that Lydia wouldn't mind… much.
Tony bit back on his almost automatic correction of the Isreali's idioms, instead setting aside the camera and pocketing the phone. Pulling out a a small evidence bag, he shifted further into the closet, carefully collecting some of the tiny, brittle, egg shaped things that lined the floor of the closet.
Tomorrow he would look for a few lava lamp.
Stiles leaned forward against his leg. “What do you mean?”
Since then Kiba had ached with a phantom pain and always stopped by the little house to cuddle up with something of the blond's, desperate for that familiar scent. The small parcel of land abutted the Nara property so Shika kept the garden neat and saw that the house was kept in order. It was not odd to see Nara deer leaning over the little fence to munch on the flowers that Ino had helped plant.
Stiles could understand that Allison needed him, right?
Stiles gaped for a moment. “Yeah. Cora never said anything about that. What have you done? Have I read your stuff?”
Spike had just rolled his eyes and grabbed Xander by the collar, frog marching him away from the feasting beastie and shoving him into the car the vamp and stolen and hot-wired.
"I know."
Before anyone else could speak, the man whipped the thin cloth away to reveal the dismembered body of his last legionnaire. Anthony staggered forward a half step at the sight before stilling and forcing all emotion from his face.
They didn't get to spend much time together during that month, Rodney usually passing out whenever his head hit the pillow. Ronon didn't mind though, his lover and mate was protecting their home. He was working hard to protect their tribe.
He held on desperately onto the blonde's arms as he shook, feeling every hot and heavy inch inside him . Steve was pressing on his everything, leaving no reprieve or relief as he made steady shallow thrusts, massaging Tony's inner walls, the blond gasping at the drag of that soft velvet soft against his cock.
"Oh… I see. Thank you."
Vintage framed maps of the world had been mounted on the deep red walls, no doubt originals 'confiscated' from their previous owners. A large globe sat fixed in a ornately carved mount, the orb gleaming in the pale light coming in through the windows.
Ewan pursed his lips at the sight, peering through the half frosted glass of Candy's 1970s porridge coloured, two door Vauxhall Viva. He was squished in the backseat with Candy's roommate Eugené while his roommate and Candy's on again off again lover, Jake, lounged in the front seat.
The cut on his face was still bleeding from where he’d taken a gun butt to the head and was dripping blood down his hair line and into the neck of his suit. They asked many questions, gesturing to his tech laid out on a nearby table but he remained silent, his mind racing as his eyes took in everything that he could.
Bright blue light shone from the open doorway and they were surrounded.
He would stare at his keys sitting smugly in the little special bowl near the door for a few minutes then pocket them without a word. He would frown at the crude and vulgar words spelled out with his fridge magnets before deftly correcting their grammar. He would dismantle the couch fort and set the little pillows back in their places so that he could collapse and take a nap before his afternoon class.
The lights were brighter here, a harsh white that made him wince after so much darkness. He was surprised at the brilliance, his heart finally calming as he stepped closer to the huge lamps that hung over head.
A quick cold shower, he was geared up and walking into the hanger. Rodney was a lone at the jumper, nervous and flushed when Ronon crooked an eyebrow.
But Thor wasn’t in any mood to be considerate, not when the source of his distress continued to sit on a chair in the common room for days on end staring blankly out of the window.
Tony dressed in his best tux and felt a deep satisfaction when the scientist flushed and gaped at the sight of his in his suit. With a chaste kiss to the other man's knuckles, he escorted him into the gala space, staying at his side as they navigated the room. Tony had never been to one before and was surprised at the number of Washington movers and shakers who were in attendance.
The man winked and leaned back as his partner made her way into the room beyond the small cell’s door, setting a crate down in the corner and coming up to stand next to her brother. She looked at Riddick with a frown.
He cradled it against his chest, scolding it softly before carefully placing it in one of the open tool kits. It chittered and scrambled at the sides before pulsing its lights forlornly. He huffed and pouted at the little thing, valiantly ignoring the man watching him from the shadow of the doorway.
"I'm still not seeing anything on the map." Rodney whined as he walked, head down as he studied the small ancient device in his hands.
“It can’t be.” He gasped as the bluest eyes caught his own. “It’s not allowed.”
He scoffed and commanded it to be silent. It was too bloody cold for that now. He wouldn’t sleep deeply anyway, this deep in the enemy strong hold. He was so tired. All he wanted was light and warmth. He needed the small semblance of peace it provided. He’d been so long away from Sol’s blessed gaze, it was maddening. He craved the light. He craved the gold painted citadel. He craved the warmth along his shoulders, the beads of sweat that curled his hair and pooled at his collar. He missed Sol’s kiss on his cheeks and forehead.
"More like or something." She gave him a grin, whipping out her orders. "Private Flores Reporting for duty, Sir."
“I can’t believe that this is happening. Thank you so much. You’ve saved two lives tonight. Heaven knows how many more tomorrow.” He blurted happily, bringing his hands up to cup Tony’s elbows. “God, if you’d let me I could kiss you right now.”
I love how Anthony got less rigid as the story progressed, showing is transition from the Iron King to just a man in love. of course it's all not happily ever after, they would face a lot of challenges with a lot of people unhappy with this turn of events but at least they have a chance now and that makes me happy.
"You rude little shit…."  Laura Hale stepped forward with a snarl, hey eyes glowing gold with a tint of red. The rest of the little groups seemed satisfied with keeping back. he counted a frowning Talia, her conniving shit of a brother Peter, the broodmiester that was her son Derek, the surly Cora and a couple other rando wolves. Then, his eye caught on a tall lanky form trying to hide behind the others and his lip curled derisively.
"I'm going to get you out of here." he whispered the promise against those soft lips. "Don't you worry. I'm the smartest man in two galaxies and this will not be our end. I promise you Di Na Nwunye."
Riddick chewed on that for a long second, taking in the sight and feel of a willing lover in his lap. Someone not afraid of him or in awe of him. Someone who wanted to scratch that deep itch that people who lived their kinds of lives didn’t get to do very often. And if it came to it, someone he could face and fight and scratch another itch.
Pride took him home, passing right by the hotel Tony had been checked into. "You shouldn't be alone tonight."
A clink of armor at his side told him that Blaise was near, his mother's unique armor hanging large on his lithe frame. the dark haired boy would have to fix it in time, using the tools she'd taught him to forge and use. But he would have to do it alone, without her sharp abrupt guidance and infinite patience. Blaise was now the only one left of his line. Just like Draco, just like most of the others now wandering the ship, sharing water and blankets and seeing to the frightened and sick.
He bought a lava lamp from a local thrift store because he was feeling facetious.  Watching its red orange glowing blobs float within the mystery liquid  in the corner a weirdly comforting to look at when his mind was running in circles over his latest assignment.
The night was warm and the air heavy and sweet. The thick material of his Beacon Hills High hoodie was pooled around his waist. The glass of the jeep was warm against his back through the thin jersey and his jeans were old raged ones that gone soft from years of washing.
"Thor, what are you doing? We aren't... we don't do hugs. And I'm still missing my clothes."
Giving up on the whole prom too, until Gamora didn't show up with a limo for real.
But as he looks around, nobody's there but them.
"You had a child?" Stark's face was pure disbelief. "And you brought her here?"
"Of course not."
“Ah, that. I like what we have now, Steve. Actually, that’s an understatement. I LOVE it, you make me mad with want, in a way nobody has before...”
"Don't look at me, I'm not his keeper. I probably have less idea what he's talking about than you."
"How many?" Strange asked, while Loki just couldn't help but ask.
"Steve, what the-"
“The boss of the boss of my boss called me, and told me to drop your case.”
“Then you won’t. I’ll… try to help you the best I can. My mom was a nurse, so I’ve picked up a couple of things watching her,” Steve told him, and Tony could only give him a shaky smile. For some reason he thought Steve would not listen to him just as he didn’t before, saying that it was for Tony’s sake.
In turn, though, Tony had some free time on his hands, when he wasn’t part of “hospitality”. He started creating small trinkets and building crude robots earlier than he could talk (although, given Howard Stark’s household management style, it was smarter to shut up most of the time).
But then Nat was gone, an alternative version of Thanos also showed up, and Steve got injuries in the fight so grave - even with Mjolnir - that he was almost sure he won't survive them.
All he needed to do was distract Tony until Bucky could leave, and then Steve could get Bucky somewhere safe later.
"Right, because that's so easy," Gamora noted.
"I've never seen more stupid-looking jewelry in my life, and I can assure you, I'd remember, Doc," Tony told him. "So, I was thinking. Block my powers. I don't want them."
"I'm glad you wonder that, because Steve wants to give you the talk, and I can't keep him away from you forever."
“You’re right,” Steve at least didn’t deny it. “But I’d like to if you’d let me.”
"I can stand my own."
"Is the Tower's speech recognition so complex?"
"I don't even want to hear it," Stark turned around. Probably to leave.
We've been dating for months, and even before, I could
“What the hell is this?” Quill asked because it looked like a phone with earphones. And not just a cheap model either.
"Still, when they say you should lift from the knees, I have SuperKnees," Rhodey insisted. "So arguably..."
Well, they barely knew each other when they started going out for one. And high school life was sometimes moving so fast as life on a highway, so even after they'd been doing well together for a while, and maybe even better as time passed, Phil expected something to come between them eventually.
And... still nothing.
While Tony was still trying to better the world: at least the very tiny piece of it that he could influence. His inventions often were meant to help Omegas.
"And I can tell Steve everything I know."
"I'm not sure I can do that, given that my Vibranium reserves are limited and-"
If their roles were reversed, Bucky would have probably either yelled at Tony, or accused Steve of cheating, but surely making a scene. Bucky knew it was a good thing Steve didn't, but deep down also feared maybe it was because Steve simply didn't care.
"Then?"
"If you were aiming for scary, you shouldn't have said anything," Hawkeye suggested. "In your place, I would have just stood there, and laugh like a maniac."
"Yes. And he was right," Nebula nodded. "And I thought it wasn't only fitting, but funny."
Yet, Tony was not only not allowed to tell him the truth, but now had to fend off an Alpha who wouldn’t take the easy answer, when he only wished he could just simply give it.
"Believe me, I thought magic was bullshit as well at first, but if you don't want to level half of the city, you have to trust me."
And if he had known how cruel Ronan's minions could be, he would have insisted for Rocket and Groot to keep their distance a long time ago.
He woke in a bed, and - if not for his injuries - comfortable. Warm. Hungry, but rested. Definitely not the torture or the imprisonment he'd expected before passing out, and he was still alive.
"Cap, don't take this the wrong way-"
“I’m sorry that has happened to you, but-“
Sometimes discouraged whether he was doing the right thing at all - technology could harm just as help, although never stopping because it wasn't in his nature to stop. Not being able to draw inspiration from any fellow competitors, because nobody was doing things like him, so turning to alternative geniuses of other genres like music, trying to still forge a way ahead when his path wasn't clear.
