“You’re fucking ridiculous, you know that?” he asked rhetorically, helping himself to some of the bed as he felt exhaustion begin to take him. “Hard to believe you’re the one.” He felt Clint stiffen next to him.
Two years in, Sergeant Barnes had his left arm blown off in combat. Clint had stayed by his side every step of the way as he went through physical therapy and slowly recovered. Tony had designed his prosthetic, which got the two brunettes started in a branch of Stark Industries that provided free prosthetics for vets.
Clint found a bow small enough for her and had her practice with a target. It didn’t take her long before she hit the bullseye, at which point the blonde let out a triumphant yell that had Daci smiling in equal excitement.
,” she said before turning to look down at her lap. “And I have it for life, except now I know every few years a seizure will overpower the medicine and I’ll need to reup the dosage,” here she stood up and in doing so knocked her chair back a few feet.
“Say, Peter. Could you actually do me a favor and go grab your Dad from his lab? You know he locked me out last week after turning down his stereo and it’s his turn to do dinner.” Both Steve and Peter knew those were lies, but Peter could tell his Pops wanted to talk to Emerson in private.
At that Emerson’s head shot up and she looked incredulously at the blonde. He can’t be serious, he didn’t even know her! But something in her gut said she could trust him. You can’t trust any man! The voice replied, look what that’s got you. But he’s different!
A smile quickly formed on her face when he began talking about his weapon of choice. Seeing him get excited about the details, history and safety usage of the bow made something warm settle in her gut. She didn’t have the word for it, but she was really liking spending time with Clint.
Their Pop then picked up the chuckling youngest, kissing his cheek loudly to get more giggles from the five year old. She followed them back into the living room, just now noticing that her Dad had remained sitting in his same spot to finish his breakfast. The blonde flipped the tiny kid until he was holding him upside down as they walked to the genius to join him. She sat next to Peter on the other side of the couch, rolling their eyes when their Pop sat next to their Dad after chucking a laughing Miles in between them and the teens on the couch.
“You read my mail?” she asked angrily and in shock, distancing herself a little from her father. “That’s illegal!” He at least had the audacity to turn pink in shame.
He took a breath before grabbing the med kit, pulling out the supplies he had to deal with bruises before asking her kindly to pull her shirt back up. She looked wearily at him for a moment, which admittedly broke his heart a little, before doing as he asked.
“Hey baby,” Tony said with a tired smile as he gently wrapped the boy in a hug. She saw Steve sit next to the two of them on the bed before turning to look at her. He offered a tired smile and a nod in their direction, silently asking her to join them.
“Sir’s blood pressure is one ten over sixty, his cholesterol is one-thirty, he has a resting heart rate of ninety, though that is currently accelerating due to this realization-”
“So. I hear you have a new little sister.” His heart immediately sank. Of course he’d be interested in her. Though Peter never saw her that way, even before he saw her as a sister, he recognized she was pretty. And Wade has only dated girls. He knew how stupid this all was in his head, only offering Wade a nod as an answer.
With a smug smile on his face, the other Alpha waved him over. Tony followed the man’s line of sight, settling on Steve and shaking his head no. With a smug smile of his own, Steve pushed reassurance to his mate before ignoring the other Alpha and pointedly walking away. He pulled Harley away from him to sit him on his shoulders.
“No shit,” Howard muttered, condescending tone cutting through Tony like he was a small child again.
Peter smiled at his Pop, taking the tablet and moving to curl up further into his embrace in gratitude. He obliged being the little spoon as his Pop curled around him, burying his face in Peter’s hair. He felt his Pop’s breathing slow down and even out indicating he had fallen asleep.
,” he said with a small snarl towards the blonde Alpha, knowing he never arrived on time to a thing in his privileged life. He couldn’t help but actually snarl a little when his ex just scoffed at that.
Steve remembers calling the woman the day after that sweet angel was born. The day after her own daughter had passed. And that bitch actually blamed that baby for her daughter’s death and told Steve never to call her again.
“NO!” he shouted, startling the man below him as she watched Steve move to pry Peter off of the man.
“He was literally born yesterday, so he still looks like an alien,” he explained as he handed her his phone to scroll thru.
“Bambino, I need you to look at me, my love,” Tony said slowly, offering his son a smile before continuing. “First of all, in what universe would I ever allow anyone to push you out? If Steve even hinted at that, I would kick him to the curb, understand? You are not going anywhere. Maybe not even when you become an adult,” Tony teased, smiling when it got the desired giggle from his pup. “He was telling the truth about lions, but they are wild animals. We are domesticated animals. Plus...bambino do you honestly believe Steve would do any of that?”
"Alright Em, what's up? Steve can only stall that kid for so long," the father teased as he moved to sit closer to his girl.
Steve ended up staying at the mansion for another hour and a half - twenty of those minutes spent working on their project. The rest of the time, Tony was humoring Steve with all of his questions about the architecture, paintings, statues...and just about everything else he found to be beautiful.
“I don’t want you to do any of those things, Steve.” Tony said, suddenly more serious. “I don’t want you to give anything up for me, I just want you. Just, you.” Steve stopped him from rambling with another deep kiss, wrapping his arms around his husband’s waist and lifting him up off the chair. The genius squawked in response before laughing at the man he’d chosen to spend his life with.
“Because I figured you’d get mad,” she said before waving her hands in his direction to prove her point.
“Please, for the love of God, do not encourage his behavior young lady,” Steve said before joining them to eat.
“That’s true,” Steve said as he stood up off the couch. “I’m going with you guys tonight, let me pack a bag and I’ll go to Tony’s after.”
The next morning, he woke up to his internal clock at around five am. Tony was still slumbering next to him, which had the blonde gently kiss his cheek before climbing out of bed to start his day. He texted Bucky to see if he’d join him in a morning run, but wasn’t surprised by the lack of response from his oldest friend.
“Daddy!” the little boy cried as he ran to them, the two parting from each other as Tony easily caught the pup in his arms.
Steve let Harley and Morgan wander the gym floor after having JARVIS shut down the parts with weapons and weights. It left the gymnastics and jungle gym open, which were super child-proof with excess padding. Clint had taken it upon himself to show off his tumbling skills, which prompted all four kids to attempt to copy him.
“Steeeeeeeeeeb! Steeb Daddy spanked me!” Jo tattled, turning around to glare at the man who finally made his way into view. Bucky was out of breath, covered in flour and looked about ready to pull his own hair out. He looked a lot older than his recently turned twenty-two years of age. When he took a step forward, she shuffled her tiny body around Steve to hide behind his legs; all while their mom kept laughing loudly.
“I did!” she said excitedly, letting out another giggle when he pulled her into his arms, spun her around and set her on the floor instead of the counter.
," Clint whispered back, tears in his beautiful blue eyes as they pulled away for a moment to smile at each other.
When he continued mercilessly moving up and down her backside, she started apologizing in hopes of easing the pain.
“Yes I can, I’m an adult,” she mumbled again, realizing how pitiful that sounded as she heard her little brother join them.
"That's cause he's with his Uncle Clint! Say it again, Petey. Say 'bubba'," the Omega prompted the baby, who smiled gummily at the group.
“Daddy?” Harley mumbled in Steve’s shoulder, face buried but a tiny hand reaching out for the Omega.
“You mean that she was so blase about replacing Samantha Rose?” he interrupted her train of thought, continuing while she looked back at him in shock. “But she did not replace Samantha because no one can. She also, my dear, did not replace you by having another daughter. Your birth mother is simply living her life and inviting you to be a part of it.”
The three all breathed a sigh of relief in unison, which caused the group to also burst into giggles; all exhausted from this evening.
“See?” Steve said as he sat up to straddle his man. “Every single inch,” he said as he grabbed his husband’s left hand, one final scar to focus on. Tony rolled his eyes fondly below him until the blonde stuck the man’s entire ring finger in his mouth, tongue caressing the silver band covering the tattoo. It might have been a little narcissistic, since it was Steve’s name and all, but he was guessing by the hardening member poking him it wasn’t a bad idea.
Steve watched as Tony took some cash out of his wallet and gave it to his friend, who laughed and tried to add more before the Omega put the cash in his hand and literally shoved the Alpha away. The man did when the pup grabbed his hand and yanked him to the nearby ice cream vendor. Tony turned back to Steve, cheeks pink with embarrassment as the Alpha tried not to laugh at the situation.
He heard the crying before he made it to the door, heart breaking from the sounds. The father quietly opened to door, heart breaking further at the sight before him.
“...How did you do it?” Peter asked with a wave of his hands, still fuming and well aware that Miles would need notes from Peter’s office in order to replicate the serum.
“I’m not drinking anymore, Thor,” Steve replied as she watched Clint reach around the other blonde to steal his drink.
"No magic, Reindeer Games!" the brunette shouted before they continued to check on the two. The door was open but had no occupants inside. The husbands again shared a look before the shorter man addressed the ceiling.
“Right. Except...the last few parties we were at...I was with Brock…” Clint pointed out carefully, actually kind of hating that he was hitting the nail on the head from James’ flinch. “James you don’t have anything to worry about, it’s not like I’d ever-”
After Steve left to take care of Peter, it wasn’t long before the other two Stark babies wanted to go back to their floor. Luckily, Clint sensed that Daci wanted to stay longer and asked Nat to take the two babies upstairs so they could stay in the gym.
“Coming!” Kristen said, the most confident of the three, as she went back inside to answer the door and talk to Bucky.
“No, Steve, this is on me for misunderstanding. I just thought you wanted…” And here it was, even after Steve had just tried to reassure him...the doubt still lingered.
He showed the man the bags he selectively carried - just bags of clothes and shoes. He left the toys back in the pile and didn't think he needed to show his husband just yet.
“If you like them, you should ask them out,” Steve said simply, shrugging his shoulders as if he hadn’t thought about various double date ideas.
He’d just had sex with the most gorgeous creature on the planet - twice - so of course he was a little...emotionally fragile. So he was allowed to have tears spring from his eyes. It had nothing to do with his stupid insecure brain.
"You deserve this, sweet girl. Every bit of this happiness you feel," her Dad said quietly, tightening his arms around her.
“Steve’s turning 30 in two days and doesn’t want to get a drink with us,” Clint explained as Steve felt himself fume a little.
And as Strucker began reciting the words in Romanian that morphed her back into a soldier, her last thoughts were of her family. And the sudden hope that they weren’t coming after her.
He sat on the edge of the bed while Tony remained standing and avoided looking at him. Steve was still patient, understanding whatever Tony was about to tell him would be hard.
Very carefully so as not to disturb the now sleeping pup, Tony pulled his phone out of his pocket to take a few pictures.
But unfortunately, it also meant talking to her tonight. When he was already incredibly exhausted and just wanted to curl up with his husband.
“Honey can you grab her a glass of water? I’ve got some pain meds here,” Steve asked quietly, not wanting to break the silence he had managed as he finished with the bandage and gently pulled her shirt back down.
Turns out she was, Tony surprisingly waking up first and smiling when he noticed a mop of brunette hair between him and the blonde. Heart also aching a little at the thoughts that had plagued her over the night.
“Didn’t say he didn’t love me,” she muttered with a smile. He laughed with her at that, thinking about her father again.
“-what? Aren’t you jocks all secretly in the closet?” the blonde continued as he reached a hand out to grab Bucky’s hoodie.
“I asked you first,” his man teased. Steve huffed out a laugh, leaning against the counter as he considered his question.
. She couldn’t help fidgeting from his onslaught, wondering how much longer he thought she deserved this.
“I know,” she said, cutting him off from saying anything else. She reached one hand back, feeling around until she could grab one of Tony’s hands in additional comfort. She heard them both chuckle at her, and she could care less how childish and clingy she was being right now.
Oh man, still not ready for Infinity War. It's why I decided to make this a series - cause I refuse to accept MCU's version. Hope you enjoyed it! <3
"I love you, very much kiddo. And I want you to understand that I'm coming from a place of both love and empathy. You..." he couldn't help but laugh before continuing. "You are way too similar to me kiddo, like deja-vu but if I was a gorgeous young woman. Which I could've pulled off, just for the record," he added and laughed a little along with Emerson, glad to see her relax and scoot closer to her father.
“No I just...what we had was so long ago, you know? And you’ve got a kid to think about…” Clint trailed off, picking absently at the bed sheet and not looking Bucky in the eye. So it wasn’t that he didn’t have feelings for Bucky and was letting him down...it was he doubted Bucky’s feelings for
The only one he’d really been worried about was Harley, but the pup quickly took a liking to his new grandparents and even managed to squeeze more cookies out of them. Warmed up to his aunt who coaxed him into playing MarioKart with her.
," he whispered to the man, feeling brave and vulnerable in a way he can't remember feeling before. And he didn't actually hate it, unlike he would have as the Soldier where being vulnerable and feeling weren't really an option. But there was a part of him that secretly loved it. Especially when he heard the words were returned to him.
She ignored the upcoming lecture in favor of a delicious treat as she followed her Pop into the kitchen.
The super soldier continued laughing when he felt his stubbornly silent husband extract himself from his hug – going to grab his plate and moving to the dining table, head high in the air from the betrayal. “Love you,” Steve called out before turning back to Sam to share a laugh.
“And I’m going to eat them all,” Howard teased as he passed the others in the hall, carrying multiple bags of food.
“Are you okay, Tony?” Daci asked in confusion, shifting closer to sit next to him on the bathroom floor.
"They're all so cute Emerson! How are you going to decide?" Miles asked as he giggled at the kittens playing with the feather toy her was swinging around. She smiled as well, wondering if she could somehow convince her parents that they do actually need six cats. The tuxedo kitten had woken up but was still cuddling in her lap, almost instantly winning her heart as she thought of what kind of name would fit...him? Her?
, the last bell rung and she made her way to the bleachers. No one was there at first, which surprised her – as they were gossiping hoes…so you’d think there’d be a big crowd for the show…which suddenly made her think something was up.
“Just…stay away from it until you’re of age. There’s this man…he’s trying to ruin my career. And my boss thinks he’s trying to get a scandalous pap picture of you drinking. Which means he knows about it, but doesn’t have any evidence to back it up. And if he did…well it doesn’t bode well on my leadership skills if I can’t get my own kid to obey the laws.”
“Let me ask that again; Leo honey, do you know how to swim?” she asked gently, getting her answer when the boy blushed and looked away. “Well, what if you and I go sit in the shallow end to start?” she suggested with a smile, glad to see the boy at least shrug in response.
The vigilante looked at Spiderman a moment before taking off running. He swung after him, not recognizing the guy – unsure if he was a villain or not. He was running from a crime scene, but Peter also recognized those guys from a drug bust he did a few weeks ago.
“My apologies little warrior,” Thor said in a quiet rumble, something Daci didn’t know he was capable of.
“She won’t be here long enough to sit down,” Steve said evenly. He ignored Nat ‘ooh’ing in encouragement behind him and focused on the one with the information.
“Hanging out with Barton, she’s probably mastered the bow and arrow by now,” Tony answered with a yawn, stretching his limbs out and thoroughly enjoying the angry look on the terminator's face.
The siblings made their way to the elevator, both opting for silence. When the elevator opened again, Peter decided he needed to say something.
After slowly regaining consciousness and testing the zip ties around her wrists, she finally realized what had happened. And that she wasn't making it out alive as she heard a familiar voice speak behind her.
“Would you like to bring my father into this?” she asked quietly, there were a few stragglers left in the hall and she didn’t really want them to hear her threatening her English teacher.
The bell finally rang, signally the end of her school day. Not that she necessarily didn’t like kindergarten, but she loved hanging out with her family more. Speaking of, she spotted her cousin Peter making his way down the steps with his friends until the two made eye contact. Then, they both took off, racing towards Happy and the waiting towncar - as they did everyday after school.
his partner. He needs a girlfriend,” she huffed back at him, making Steve purse his lips to keep from laughing aloud. She was awfully cute and totally reminded him of a young Buck.
"No, unfortunately he beat us fair and square," Peter said begrudgingly as he took the bags from his sister to distribute the food among them.
That’s when Peter heard shouts, followed by the sounds of doors slamming and feet pounding as Leo made his way into view. Behind the boy he could hear people arguing, but Peter’s frozen attention was on Leo. The boy had tears in his eyes and didn’t stop until he ran straight out of the building.
“You’re not in trouble, Joey. Buck, why don’t you go fix them a snack?” he suggested as he walked over to squat down and hug the poor kid.
Steve gently rocked the two back and forth, vowing he wouldn’t let that abusive fuck get anywhere near his man again.
“He’s all bark, no real bite. Plus you’ve got what...fifteen pounds of muscle on the guy?” Clint asked as he casually got his phone out, set the flashlight on and proceeded to entertain himself with shadow puppets on the ceiling.
“Wait,” he said with a smile. “Thanks for telling me and for...everything else,” he added before pulling her into a hug. “
“Alright, head down to Clint’s floor, Daci. Come back when you get tired of him,” Tony said to the girl with a smile, watching her run towards the elevator.
“Because we can,” came the unexpected reply from Steve. She looked up into the fiercest blue eyes she’d ever seen. “Because without knowing your past, it’s obvious you deserve better. And we think – he stole a glance with his husband, making a silent agreement with each other – that we can help you with that. Not because we feel obligated or because you’ve become Peter’s friend or anything like that. We want you here, granted you also want to stay here, because we care about you and want to help.”
“Here,” Tony said with a smile, handing over a thick engineering book covered with dust. Steve reached his hand out in confusion to accept it, when Tony suddenly pulled it out of Steve’s reach. “This is not for you to keep, only for you to borrow,” the brunette reiterated before handing the book over.
Fairy lights spread across the ceilings and the walls, as candles help light up the space as well, his eyes also catching the bouquets of star-gazer lilies lining a path through the warehouse.
“Yeah, you’re right. I should go talk to him. Come with me and sit outside the door,” Tony said with a purr, smiling when Steve’s smell changed to happy and he felt appreciation push through their bond.
When she pulled away, she gave him a look that confused the genius before she turned to the other two.
“Still hungry, by the way,” she mumbled. The two fathers laughing before arranging for some delivery.
The walk back to his bedroom was peaceful and heartwarming. Her words washed over him like a soothing wave, ridding himself of the anxiety thinking about what’s his face.
“He’s very nice, do you want to play with them? You could probably tire him out quicker, he wouldn’t be able to catch you.” That had a smile spread across her face as she looked at her father before standing up and walking towards the ‘jolly green giant.’
She stayed buried in his neck, mumbling something again as the man felt tear drops begin to stain his shirt. He smiled and rubbed her back in comfort.
Steve  joined Emerson on the couch and handed some blankets to her before answering for himself, “no I hadn’t seen it. I’m assuming it’s pretty good?”
“Come on Jo, now walk to Uncle Steve,” his brother said. She looked up at him, pure excitement in her eyes as she waved her hands excitedly at her uncle.
“Harley, are you excited to be a big brother?” Howard asked the six year old. The pup was playing with his tablet, only answering with a shrug. “Well that’s alright pup, I didn’t like having a little brother either.”
“I’m sure your dads’ would be fine with it!” she encouraged, seriously looking excited at the prospect of the two hanging out.
Which obviously is not in any way the worst thing in the world, but the men had selfishly relished in the idea of more alone time together. Plus their jobs were hard enough on Peter, who knows what the idea of that could do to a little boy who'd just lost his mom. He might not even like the idea of living with two gay men or he could get backlash at school - not to even mention the backlash from the infuriating media. So he and Tony talked and talked and talked finally deciding to wait to meet the boy before making any decisions.
“I dont give a flying fuck about that, what do you mean little hot piece of Omega-ass??” Steve couldn’t help but smirk at that, happy to have the attention taken from him.
“I’m glad,” his boyfriend said with his face scrunched up adorably, causing Steve to steal another kiss from the man he planned on kissing forever.
“Don’t thank him, Daci. He just loves his Papa’s stories cause I’m surrounded by traitors,” Tony said to his kids as he grabbed Morgan from Peter before sitting on the other side of Daci with the baby in his lap.
“So one time, when Jarvis took me to the park, there were some kids picking on me...when I was suddenly saved…”
“Oh yeah, it’s been super fun raising a hormonal and angry teen these last few years…” they both shared a small laugh at that.
“Son?” Tony choked out, smiling at the beautiful boy in his husband’s arms. His hands reached out before drawing back, unsure. But his husband sensed his hesitancy, extending his arms and helping Tony gently transfer the boy to cradle in his arms.
"-I promise Emerson, whatever it is, I won't be mad. Just say it," he finished with a smile, having witnessed earlier how quickly that boy can fully dress himself. Little dude was a ninja when it came to dressing himself and the genius would be lying if he didn't admit he loved the boys style.
“Yeah well, can you blame me? I almost lost my brother…” He felt James gently pinch his chin before bringing his face up to his, soft smile on his handsome face.
“You’re not exactly great at hiding it. I saw the WW + PS you wrote on your notebooks. Don’t need to be a son of a genius to put two and two together.”
He swiftly picked her up off the bed, which had her squealing in delight as he held her close and swung her around her room. He then gently placed her on her stomach on the bed and sat down next to her to rub her back in comfort.
“No it’s not that it’s just…so you’re really not mad?” Steve looked sadly down at his kid, who may never not be skeptical of the superhero.
“It might be your brain trying to protect itself. Instead of sitting in that pain, your brain blocks your thoughts from continuing… I recognize you don’t have control over that, Emerson.”
“Yeah,” he muttered in disbelief, thinking about earlier in the week when his foster son literally told him to ‘fuck off.’ He felt his Pop squeezed his shoulder in comfort as they heard voices approach.
“I lost both my parents when I was 20,” he found himself confessing, “they also died in a car accident.”
Steve smiled at him, not able to help himself getting a quick kiss from those sexy pouty lips before explaining, “let’s go to bed, love.” Tony nodded in understanding, still groaning as he let Steve help him stand up off the couch and head to their bed.
“Yeah, nothing to be ashamed about. Plus he’s a pretty good teacher,” she said to him with a smile, noticing the man in question was swimming over to the two. “Speak of the devil.”
“What’s this spanking for, Jo?” he asked again. His break apparently was over, as he continued laying swats on her upper thighs; though admittedly less severe than before. All of this only intensified her tears.
The good mood extended even after they only had half an hour to sleep, going through a drive thru coffee shop and grabbing extra drinks and donuts for the people they knew would already be there waiting for them.
"What do you mean you can't go? We've been planning this for months," he said to his boyfriend, who was packing his luggage like Peter but JUST informed him he had a different destination.
Their dads spent most of the day in their bedroom – which neither teen was really complaining about. Out of sight, out of mind and all that.
The blonde sunk down onto the couch, resting his head on his hands as he felt James sit on the couch next to him. Sweetly rubbing his back while Clint focused on his breathing.
Thor was quite the spectacle to the young girl. He had come by for breakfast, rummaging through the pantry for his stash of pop tarts, not noticing the teen staring at him in awe. Steve hadn’t been aware of his arrival and was surprised to find he had simply showed up to the Tower one Saturday morning. Emerson had woken up first and was thoroughly surprised by the Asgardian in the kitchen. When Steve had joined them shortly after, he was utterly surprised to see the two laughing and finishing off a second box of pop tarts.
“Ha!” Tony laughed out. “That’s true. But then you wouldn’t get to bring home that sweet bundle right there,” Tony nodded to his son.
“Jo?” he asked quietly, causing more tears to spill down her cheeks as she looked up at him. He had anger and fear and pain combined on his face.
"Not after he sees what we've done he won't," Kori added with confidence as she started working on his daughter's hair.
Tony, ever the multi-tasker, didn’t look up from his tablet when he answered. “I believe it’s twenty-seven, my dear.”
Shaking his head fondly, Clint knocked on the door and only had to wait a moment before the door swung open. Standing there was a young boy, who looked like the blonde version of Bucky.
“Cleaning supplies are in this closet,” he said, pointing to a small door visible in the hallway. “I’ll put on some tunes,” he continued as he walked to the touch screen along the wall. He decided on nineties pop when she came back with cleaning spray and towels.
“Third time’s a charm,” he whispered in encouragement, glad to finally hear a chuckle from the teen. She turned to rest her cheek on his shoulder as he waited her out.
“What kind of classes would you take?” she asked in curiosity. He smiled, stopped drawing entirely and even threw the pad and pencil on the side table to turn to her.
“It’s nice to meet you little monkey. You too Rhodey,” Steve said, sticking his hand out in greeting to the other Alpha, who’s posture had slackened as his expression turned mischievous.
“Sorry Pete, I’d rather not piss off a fossil with a –” her eyes grew wide at her slip. She looked at Steve, who looked back at her with a Cheshire grin.
"Your Dad put him to bed," he offered before moving so he could catch the running boy and throw him up in the air.
“I don’t blame you for getting side-tracked,” Clint finally said after a moment. “Daci’s a great kid.”
When she had asked Steve later why they needed to be alone, the blonde’s cheeks turned pink and he just muttered something about ‘adult time.’ She would’ve liked to have asked Clint, but he and Natasha were away on a mission. Clint was still pleasant around them, but she could tell the archer was avoiding her and her Tati.
"Peter, if you think for one second I couldn't easily thrive without your father or his money than -"
“What are you thinking about?” he asked with a smile in his voice. She shifted onto her back to see his face, biting her lip to keep from laughing again.
She rolled her eyes fondly but didn’t push any further, stretching her body out in order to copy his movements.
"You and me both, brother," he teased back, handing Joey over when she started reaching for her uncle. Steve obliged, adding a scoff before gently bringing her to his chest as she snuggled up under his neck. "You think Ma regrets having us? Even though she did it on her own?"
“Oh no, Buck, what’ll happen if Jackie just can’t let go?” Steve asked dramatically, well aware of this game. Bucky’s grin spread across his face before he molded his hands into claws, his baby brother’s blue eyes widening in excitement.
is a bastard,” Helen retorted, now getting a laugh from Joey as the teen felt her chest burn with warmth.
“Alright, point taken. I have not matured since I was seven. I get it, if you’ll excuse me though I’m going to go write my report,” Miles said before swiftly leaving the table, ignoring the snickers that followed him down the hall.
Which of course was the perfect time for May to call him. He pulls his phone out, frowning before answering it.
Clint didn’t have time to even process that when his expression went from scrunched up confusion to widened surprise.
“Me too, me too!” Lilli shouted as she toddled over, also finally wearing floaties, and jumped in. Emerson looked over at her brother, noticing he and his husband already looked exhausted as they slowly walked over and sat beside her. Leo, on the other hand, was hanging back and slowly walking the other way around the pool.
“Yup,” she said as they walked out, Steve assuring they’d leave the mess for now. “Thanks Tony,” she said as she slipped into the backseat.
“Love you too Dad.” Tony kissed her temple twice before eventually releasing her. He ran his thumb across her cheek to wipe some tears away, smiling at this amazing girl.
Which made Jo feel better for a second, before looking around and seeing there wasn’t any other kids around…
“Because this was way more fun?” she asked as if it was obvious. He thought about that for a moment, smiling at his younger sister.
"You were with your Daddy, in his lab, late last night?" the taller father asked carefully. Their "oooOOOOOs" increased until their Dad gave them the cut-throat sign.
~I like it when you call me big poppa~ and then, as if rehearsed, the two teenagers thrust their arms up to sing along ~throw your hands in the air, if you’se a true playa~… ¬both teenagers practically falling off their stools from laughing so hard. Steve remained quiet and confused, even as Jarvis stopped the music.
“Um, you’ll have to ask Uncle Bucky…” Clint said as he looked skeptically at the other man, who only squinted back at the blonde.
He was glad he asked Tony ahead of time about using the ride, giving the driver the address before attacking Clint in the back. The blonde hummed happily below him, hands reaching down to cup the brunette’s ass. Bucky pulled back, looking down at the man with a smile and a nervous breath.
He told them both he needed to speak with him, waiting in the dining room until they joined him, with his father not surprisingly arriving last and in a huff.
“Thanks for everything Vi, I really appreciate it. Oh hey, Daci is up. I’ll call you back later. Love you too, bye,” Tati said when he noticed her, turning to her with a smile on his face. “Hey cub, did you have a good nap?” She shook her head no, holding Wolf against her chest and thinking of all the knots still sitting in her stomach.
“Carolyn Foster, my mother’s mother, stopped me before I got on the train after school to confront me. She told me my parents kept me from her for some reason…”
The blonde hadn’t been introduced to the serum yet and was a gangly little thing. His Pappy had pulled him aside and shown him how to beat Bucky - who always won when they wrestled. He also showed the two of them how to properly punch someone as well as some kickboxing moves that would help Steve later with bullies.
“My father’s ill, Tony. I’m here to see him and take over Stone Inc. And I thought...since we’re in the same city...I’d meet my son. What’s his name?” Tony stared at him hard, disbelief in the sheer
“I mean, who’d be into a tall, muscular, beefy All-American, blonde haired blue-eyed, strong, sensitive, and incredible man with a heart of gold?” he finished sweetly, bringing a smile to Steve’s face.
“I’m so sorry, baby,” he heard his husband whisper in their boy’s hair, voice as broken as Steve felt. The super soldier moved a little as he felt Emerson lie herself to cuddle the other side of Peter, joining Tony in a hug sandwich. The blonde sat back, waiting for the three to settle comfortably before rubbing his son’s legs up and down – just as he had done when he was five and scraped his knee. Except this couldn’t be fixed with a bandaid. Peter’s first love died…and that is something that will continue to hurt him, though hopefully the pain will dull with time.
“Fine. Whatever. You can enjoy my sloppy seconds -” Stone began before Steve’s fist collided with his face, knocking the pathetic Alpha back onto the ground. And when the sniveling coward tried to stand back up, Steve found it easy to use his Voice against him.
“See? No one hates anyone,” her Tati said as he gave her a quick kiss on her head and releasing her before standing up fully. “But apparently everyone needs adult supervision, so everyone to the kitchen to make cookies,” he added before lifting Morgan up into his arms, Harley and Peter already long gone back to the kitchen. She watched as he shifted Morgan to one arm, extending the other one to help the archer stand.
It was two hours before his oldest woke up, sleepily joining them in the living room before perking up at the mention of donuts. They were technically related by blood, but Steve was starting to suspect Peter would be a clone of Tony. And since Harley was starting to copy Steve’s mannerisms, it was probably safe to say nurture won out over nature.
“So this is the guy who got into a fight with Sam, right?” Tony asked for clarification as Steve nodded in response.
“Huh,” Harley said as Steve turned back to preparing dinner. There was a moment of silence as Steve wondered if he’d said the right thing. But then the pup spoke up again, this time in a quiet voice. “Jurassic Park.”
“I think it has to be funny, to be considered a joke,” Sam offered as he finally stood up and stretched to go home.
His one track mind took him to the elevator and then to Stark’s floor, frowning at the sound of laughter coming from the living room. Hovering in the doorway, he scanned the room, frowning more when he saw Steve wasn’t alone, but was surrounded by Stark, Banner and Romanov.
"WAIT! Just tell me where it is-!" she tried as she heard her dads talk before the darker haired one reappeared; fully clothed. He was wearing an ACDC t-shirt and sweatpants and gently closed the door behind them as he ushered them away.
“Well, the other option is you can bend over your bed and I use my belt?” he asked quietly and almost regretfully. Jo felt her eyes burst open and a cold shiver shoot up her spine in fear at the thought.
“I...I’d love that,” Tony said, wringing his hands adorably before pulling his phone out and handing it to Steve to put his number in. After they exchanged their numbers and before they could say anything else, the pup was running back with an ice cream cone in his hands.
“Woah, wait! What’s wrong?” his husband asked while fast walking to catch up to him. Peter came to a halt at that, reminding himself they promised to be more honest with each other.
“Papa! I can’t find Optimus, I think I left him at Momma’s house,” the boy said with a pout as he entered the kitchen.
She couldn’t confirm that it was about Tony’s heart, and for once was smart enough to not reveal something aloud she’d get in trouble for. So she remained quiet while Tony started picking at the garlic bread, waiting for them to reveal themselves.
“I should probably get going,” Steve said with a smile, thinking about the other errands he needs to run today. “I’ll text you later, Tony.”
Even the people of New York were excited to have Spidey back, getting cheers and thanks left and right.
"Morning Papa!" Miles shouted through giggles as Steve carefully placed the boy on his hip, kissing his cheek.
"Hey guys," Peter greets as he walks over to put the gifts on the couch between him and his dads. The two sat up in interest, though his Dad was unfortunately still in his Pop's lap before making grabby hands.
“Jesus woman. Fine, you’ve got a deal.” He pulled his phone out and played with it for a moment while Jo stole another glance at Cara.
“Hey guess who’s awake from his nap?” Tony asked the group, which got cheers and cooes from the family. Steve momentarily stopped throwing Harley to swim over to the pair, beaming up at them from the pool wall.
“Not that, sweetie,” Tony said behind his cup of coffee. She looked back and forth between the two men, still confused.
Well, to be fair Rumlow and his crew had just started to ignore them all together, but it was refreshing to see two men kissing in public without ridicule.
“Daddy she isn’t anywhere! I checked da kitchen, da bafrooms, I even checked MY room!” he exclaimed, fatigue affecting his enunciation. Poor kid sounded exhausted physically from running but also emotionally with worthy. Tony immediately picked up on this, beckoning the boy over to him as he tried to reassure the 3 year old.
“Oh honey, here’s Stevie running naked in the front yard when it rained!” Pop cooed and handed Tony the picture as Steve felt himself blush more. Especially when his sister found the ballerina picture and handed that to Tony as well. It got a laugh out of Harley, who looked back and forth between the picture and Steve before bursting into giggles.
“I’m…I’m sorry I should –” she reached out to grab her things, intending to stand up and run out of there, but Steve was a highly trained super soldier and put his hand on her bag before she could grab it.
“Steve?!” he asked incredulously while running his hand over his face, further proof his husband was here, he was home. He threw himself at his husband, wrapping his arms around his neck and inhaling Steve’s sweet musk. The super soldier returned the hug, just as glad to have him in his arms once more. They stayed like that for a while until Tony unexpectedly rolled himself on top to straddle Steve.
He sat fuming on the couch, glad the kids were in bed as he waited for his husband to join him. He had just asked Jarvis to tell Tony he needed to see him – the man had been in his lab the last twenty four hours – and felt his anger growing with every second he waited for him. It was about a minute and a half until he heard Tony walking quickly into the living room.
“There was a car accident. Harley was with him but he’s unharmed. That was Pepper on the phone, she said Tony is in surgery.” The ringing in his ears quickly returned as he once again curled in on himself and whimpered in pain.
“Asgard is fine, young Peter. We had just been celebrating the victory over a democratic resolution when Heimdall informed me my presence was requested back on Earth.”
"You do?" the boy's tiny voice asked as Emerson felt her Dad shift to grab Miles and pull him fully onto the genius' lap.
“I appreciate the offer, but I’m just working that day. Have a good shift man,” Steve said as he made his way out, thinking maybe Rumlow wasn’t as shitty as he thought.
He opted to be quiet when he felt her slowly fall back against the bed, her feet now dangling off the side but still laying over the super soldier. He smiled when she stretched and yawned, exhausted probably physically in addition to emotionally.  She finally broke the silence between the two.
The more words this girl learned, the harder it was to even try to argue with her. And when you’re an equally stubborn teenage male, it becomes a competition. Granted, it’s against a fourteen month old, but still.
"Emerson!" he shouted as she looked up in glee, unfazed by his tone. Two of the lambs had settled on her lap, as her face lit up as she silently screamed. Miles had wiggled down from the blonde's hold, following his older brother as the two raced over to pet the lambs.
did you just call my kid?” he asked, remaining sitting but turning his attention now fully to the red-faced shrew.
He wiped the device before putting it near his little brother - who immediately complied and took the thermometer in his mouth without protest. He looked back to his Dad and gave him that
“That was when we first got him, so he had just turned five.” Tony said, “So eleven years of embarrassment from us.” The four shared a small laugh before Emerson continued with her questions.
Woof. Sorry to do y'all dirty like that. I wrote a lot this weekend and didn't want to leave y'all completely hanging, so here's the other two I wrote.
“Why are you getting this spanking, Joey?” he asked the worst question ever imagined. She squeezed her eyes shut again before responding.
“Watch it bird boy,” his husband said, snaking his arms around Steve’s waist. “That’s our terrorist you’re talking about.”
But if he hadn’t enlisted, he wouldn’t have met his best friend Sam or his partner Natasha. And even though Buck lost his left arm from their last mission, he and his brother had made it out alive. For that he was thankful.
“Right,” she said as she grabbed a pillow to rest her head on. She smiled when she saw Steve shift around to lie next to her on his back, staring at the ceiling as he waited for her to talk.
“Haven’t you two teamed up against me enough?” the grown man said with a pout as Nat turned into the driveway.
“Daddy!” Isaac cried as he crawled off Peter’s lap and toddled over with his sister to their other father.
“Bruce is in his lab and I’m sure when he and Natasha get back from shopping Clint won’t mind helping you,” Steve said as he gently pushed his husband in the direction of their bedroom. Peter and Harley joined them a moment later as Daci took a seat on the couch, her father heading to the kitchen to no doubt call Vivienne.
“Yeah, well…there’s a pretty big difference between the two of us,” she said as she settled back down in her bed.
“No,” he smiled and poked her in the side. “I missed you too much, only made it five weeks,” he said, cheeks turning a little pink at the confession. She felt herself blush a little as well, hating herself a little for ever doubting how much he loved her. She instinctually turned to curl further into him, preparing herself to ask him what’s been bothering her.
Peter and Emerson had buried Tony halfway under the sand, sculpting him into a mermaid. His husband was complaining because the “boobs are too small, Steve!” he shouted at his love, realizing he was watching them. The two teens turned to their Pop, arguing back that “Dad has a small chest!”
“Um...I just came to check on you guys...Tony, honey, why are you lying on the floor?” Steve asked, leaning against the doorway.
“Oh, you are so smart,” Tony purred with wiggly brows, squeezing the blonde’s knee playfully before starting his mustang and driving over the speed limit to the nearest least/expensive hotel.
The question got an eye roll from his oldest friend, which was significantly less impressive with the whip cream mustache.
He hadn't seen Bucky in five years. Tony, surprisingly, was the one who suggested it to the super soldier when he first brought up the vacation idea. Bucky was living in Wakanda and Tony suggested visiting the country and introducing him to Emerson and Miles.
“Wait,” Emerson began after a moment. “Does Peter still get to be Spiderman?” Both fathers turned to glare at her. Peter sat quietly with a small smile.
“–what did you say? ...w-what are you talking about?” the older woman said, shaking her head in disbelief.
“I will,” Daci said with a big smile before running to the elevator. “JARVIS take me to Dr. Bruce’s lab please.” The sounds of roaring got louder and when the doors opened she flinched at the glass that flew by. “Hulk?” she called out, stepping onto the floor and noting all the broken glass.
“You don’t have friends. Just Steve,” the Suzie girl blatantly said in confusion, getting a bellowing laugh out of the blonde. Bucky turned to glare at him, so Clint pointed at the toddler in his hands.
Peter was finally able to snap out of his shock enough to run after him. He was surprised by the boy’s speed, only catching up to him down the street.
An Alpha who didn’t think with his knot. One who saw he had a pup and instead of running away, had called his boy ‘cute.’ Even suggested their first date be the three of them.
“You know…I don’t really know,” she said as they both heard a phone ring. May felt her pockets out and checked her phone, a confused look on her face. She swiped her finger across the screen, answering it as she held it to hear ear.
sucks, dude. I can’t even imagine what that must be like for you. That is like, a horrible tornado of bad luck bullshit. And who the heck can you say all that to? I love your dads. But if you tell Steve, he’ll freak out and probably say something he’ll regret – whereas if you tell Tony, he’ll only focus on the last name thing because that precious puppy is almost forty and still insecure – when what you need is someone to talk to about each of those things…maybe a third party person who happens to be sitting right in front of you?” she asked with a smile and wiggled eye brows for good measure.
“I’m kind of busy here St-” Tony began, before his eyes settled on the plate of donuts and he immediately made grabby hands. Steve chuckled as he handed his husband the plate, one chocolate creampie, a golden donut and two blueberry donuts.
“Em, your Dad’s awake,” he said with a smile and a gentle tug. She turned to smile one more time at Kimberly, who smiled back before nodding her head. They both turned to go their own ways, content with closure.
“Xavier! Hey buddy, good to see you,” he said as he walked over to give the shy teen a hug. The young man was taller than Tony, but that didn’t stop him from treating him like the kid he was.
"Which part, paying some bitches to trigger my seizures or the fact he got his ass handed to him by a girl?"
Steve shot a glare her way. Ever since he was promoted six months ago, she only called him Captain when he was obviously failing at something. Like dressing a tiny tornado.
“Daddy is bringing a boy home that needs a safe place to stay. We don’t know how long he’ll be with us...so we’re all going to be extra nice to him and make him feel welcome here, okay?” Just then they heard the sounds of keys jingling that had his toddlers sit up in excitement.
“I was hoping to hear the story.” The two men looked at each other for a moment, having a silent conversation that Daci didn’t understand.
He huffed and rolled his eyes as his uncle once again made a dramatic threat should he ever “scare the living shit out of him” again. He had explained three times that he didn’t care; he would do whatever it took to save his family. So now he sat quietly as his uncle went on and on, his Aunt Natasha letting him as she stood leaning against the wall inspecting her nail beds.
He double checked nothing was visibly hanging out of his backpack before slinging it over his shoulder as he made his way to the elevator. He checked his watch again, quickly doing the math.
Steve recognized some, belt wounds and marks from what looked like a cane. Others he almost didn’t believe with his own eyes, was that a stab wound on her lower back? And…surgery scars along one of her kidneys? Who would do something like that to such a sweet girl, he thought as he closed the lid to the ointment jar. He looked over at his husband, who was uncharacteristically quiet.
"Contrary to popular belief, I have better emotional range than a toddler. I'll stay silent until you're done," he promised as he readjusted himself on the couch, feeling a tiny flutter of anxiety in his stomach.
“I know the Starks are loud, but you can always excuse yourself if you need a minute. Now come on, I hear Stevie’s making you some special breakfast.” She left wolf on his bed, not bringing her back up after the Morgan applesauce incident. When they got in the elevator, she grabbed his hand, trying not to seem too needy on the one-floor ride to the Starks floor.
“I’m sorry can we? Can I just take a nap?” she asked, turning to look at both men. They shared a look, like they didn’t want to leave her and wanted to stay to make her to talk about it. Tony eventually nodded at her, extracting himself from the bed while Steve stayed sitting a moment longer.
“I thought for a second maybe you…” she trailed off, looking down as he pulled her into his embrace.
“Oh yes, Ralph Waldo Emerson. Excellent writer, one of my favorites. Here, take this cute little bookmark.” She handed the child a blue and green bookmark, with the words: “Live in the sunshine, swim in the sea, drink the wild air.” She took it, rereading the text in front of her and smiling down at it.
But as those bitches reminded her – “you used to sell your own body! What’s wrong with telling us about the orgy they use you for?” between giggles – it was at this point she had grabbed her stuff and left, calling Happy for the ride and hoping Tony was home.
Her parents sat next to each other, her Dad holding up his phone to record as his Pop was turned to talk to Wade sitting next to him. He was holding a sign in his lap she couldn't quite make out - and decided maybe she didn't need to know anyway. Miles was on the other side of him, looking like he'd grown a foot since she last saw him, though the boy was barely ten years old. Peter and Shuri sat by Miles, her girlfriend holding noise makers and handing them out to the rest of her family.
not okay with her drinking. Regardless of the circumstances.” The brunette gave him a disappointed look, but ultimately nodded in response as they heard footsteps approaching. Joey made her way into the kitchen, hair damp from the shower as she accepted the cup Tony handed her, all the while avoiding looking at Steve. She moved to sit at the table and sipped her drink, sending a smile Tony’s way for adding creamer, as they heard more footsteps approach.
“I’m sorry sir, I don’t know what you’re talking about?” the receptionist said ever so sweetly, Tony reminding himself to send her flowers. Maybe send some chocolates to the other doctors and nurses pretending like they hadn’t seen anything either. He turned back to see his husband and daughter in a tight hug.
“He’s done it before…but I didn’t think…he moved to Scotland…” Tony said as he brought his hands up to his face, unable to continue.
Tony decided on Harlan James Stark, his son’s middle name a nod to the pup’s godfather. The baby had blonde hair and blue eyes, much to the godfather’s disappointment, but was healthy and that was all Tony was concerned about.
“Tony, your children are mocking me with a reference I don’t understand,” he added a pouty lip while he crossed his arms. Tony, the scoundrel, responded first by addressing the two teenagers trying and failing to hold giggles.
But as Bucky pulled back, he saw the flash of anger in Clint’s eyes that made the comparison that much more real - the anxiety like led in his stomach.
“Nuh uh,” Steve said in disagreement. “Your Daddy will be fine, toys coming to life and being mean is
"You can't quit meds and therapy cold turkey just like you can't expect the nightmares, panic attacks and flashbacks to hurt less without our help. And there's nothing wrong with needing help, okay? We get by with a little help from our friends. We even try with a little help from our friends, used to get high with a little help from our friends-" unable to continue with the laughter from his girl as she laughed at the silly father's singing.
“I mean, I won’t lie, her tits are amazing but you know who would’ve done the comic justice?” he asked.
“Don’t worry doll, you are the prettiest Omega in here,” Bucky said before planting a wet kiss on the blonde’s cheek.
“I can’t see the monkeys,” she mostly said to herself with a frown on her face. Then she felt Clint squeeze her hand, causing her to whip up to look at the man with a smile on his face.
“When’d you get so tall?” she heard from behind her, turning her head to see her father finally noticing her. She only shrugged a little before turning back to the monkeys. “You want to sit on my shoulders, cub? You can probably see better.”
“Heyyyy is that my favorite brother finally showing his face?” his sister called as she made herself visible while their brother Bucky yelled a ‘hey!’ in offense. Becca was sixteen and went back and forth on her favorite brother based on who she wanted a favor from.
She really didn’t want the big party her dads were insisting on throwing for her adoption ceremony. She’d much rather just sign the paperwork and go back to the way there were living, except she was beginning to thoroughly enjoy calling them “Dad” and “Pop.” But this big party would be overwhelming and unnecessary, facts overlooked by her new parents, who were simultaneously collaborating with Pepper on the phone while bickering over each other.
“Yeah, sorry my negotiation does not include trade. I’ve always been the big brother, it’d be too weird to suddenly have one. Plus, and I would never say this to her face, she’s a decent big sister.”
She was able to survive it, even if she ended up having to wash her arms and legs when Morgan grabbed her calf. Tony and Steve both liked her canvas, even if it was just blue and purple stripes. Harley was mostly clean but Morgan ended up getting completely covered in paint and Daci watched as Steve and Tony argued over who’d give her a bath.
“What the fuck are you doing here, Ty?” Tony growled out, resisting the urge to hold his belly protectively.
“What is this fundraiser even for?” he asked with a pout. His husband laughed before looking up at the man with a smile.
As far as he knew, Buck was straight. But then again, the two centenarians where in a whole new century...
And since he was the Winter Soldier, he didn’t miss his target. Daci collapsed on the ground at the same time Clint did, knowing the sound of her skull cracking will haunt him forever.
“Okay, well come back for bedtime, and you’ll sympathize with me,” James said absently as he tried to hand the other teen a fork.
“Of course, Em,” he reassured her, locking eyes with Wade. Wade nodded in agreement and ushered them out of the line, accepting the condolences from the crowd for them. Peter felt her hands release him, pausing a moment to allow her to walk alongside him. Wade joined Emerson on her other side, taking a moment to throw another smile at Peter. God, he was incredibly grateful for Wade Wilson.
That's when she heard strange voices coming from somewhere in the lab. She grabbed her brother and hid behind a table, having taken a glance and seen white men that definitely didn't belong there. White men with strange looking weapons and explosives started filling the lab. She heard a familiar voice, unable to place it as the sounds of machinery winding up overtook the room.
“Clint’s already got that taken care of, thanks though,” Bucky sneered, keeping his eyes on the other two who looked like they were waiting for Brock’s orders. He watched as Rumlow brought his arm back, looking like he was going to punch him - when something hit his chest and he fell back on the ground.
Sam served as his best man, bringing Sharon as a date to their wedding. Rhodey was Tony’s with Pepper being one of his groomsmen and absolutely rocking a pantsuit.
He wasn’t really mad, aware that his family could tell that as well. Whatever he got it from Dad anyway, theatrically leaving a room. He rolled his eyes while descending the stairs - able to hear the loud ACDC music playing behind the glass walls.
He noticed Clint flinch out of the corner of his eye while Sam shifted, ready to get in between the two if necessary. But it wasn’t necessary.
Yes, she should’ve known better than to kick, cause that always inspired them to step it up. And it did, the blonde shifting one leg to raise her bare bottom to an even more embarrassing angle to target her sit spots.
She gently grabbed his wrists until she could get him to look at her. He stubbornly remained curled over even when she maneuvered herself to sit directly in front of him and grabbed his face with her hands, forcing the flooded dark brown eyes to meet her green ones.
"Alphas are so silly, aren't they Petey?" Clint cooed to the baby, who giggled in response and got a chuckle from the two Omegas.
The four of them lived in a small two bedroom apartment, where the ‘master’ bedroom was barely bigger than the closet that was the smaller bedroom. His mom took the smaller one, while Bucky and Jo took the master, which left the futon in the living room for Steve.
“Bet you wish you’d listened to me about staying in the delivery room,” Joe said with a laugh, walking in with cups of coffee and handing them out.
He was appreciative for her truth and honesty. And she was right about something else; he wasn’t actually bisexual. It had just been a faze. Like being the Soldier.
But then she remembered she didn’t really deserve their love right now, and gently shoved them off of her.
“Steve did you know Father can speak seven languages? You can only speak two, right? Did you know that Father has met two princes!! He’s even on the list to go to space! Father says he’s from a long line of rich Alphas, and that the richest Alphas are the most powerful! Your Pop doesn’t come from money, right? That’s why you joined the Army?”
“-Tony, something is bothering you. Just tell me so we can move on and enjoy our weekend together.” And because he was a coward, Tony ate another piece of chocolate and finished the rest of his coffee before he turned to face the man who deserves an explanation.
“Oh y’all wait till the next game where y’all can’t gang up on me,” Sam said sending a glare to Emerson.
“Please,” she said as she stuck her hand out to stop the teen. “Here,” she added as she grabbed something in her purse, “take my business card, I’d love to treat you to lunch.”
His mom was honestly better at this, and had way more patience, especially when it came to the tiny tyrant terrorist. He wished she was back from work, knowing he wasn’t as good a reader as she was and not particularly wanting to entertain the screaming goblin.
He half-smiled at her, concern growing when she remained quiet; really hopeful that she would explain herself soon.
“Ma!” Bucky whined, obviously annoyed at his family for not taking his side. Joey nodded with a pouty lip, wrapping her arms tightly around her Nana.
The running warm water cascading down their bodies only added to the pleasure of the whole experience. As it usually did.
"Wait," Miles paused in his joyous dance, turning to his sister in confusion. "Iron Man is your Dad and Captain America is your Pop? So you live with two...with two..."
"The faster I can blow out these candles and eat cake, the faster I can get Xavier back for the cheap shot."
His family waved to the boy in acknowledgement but didn’t otherwise crowd him. Instead they focused their attention on the one toddler attacking the teen, while the other crawled over his grandfather to join in the assault. Laughter spread throughout the room as Pete noticed a small smile appearing on Leo’s face.
“Nice try, kiddo,” Tony said with a smile. “How about we just eat this food that is probably cold, which I’m happy to heat up, and we’ll
“You’re sitting on it,” he said as they heard the sounds of Barney opening the front door. James frowned at him before turning to the older blonde.
Furious. Livid. Enraged. Fuming. He wasn’t listening to his calm husband go over the next steps in all of this…this absolute bullshit. Who the fuck could ever do such a thing to a little girl? He recognized, and sure Steve did too, the welts on her back from a belt, other marks that looked like a cane or switch. Along with scars and bruises that he saw on his own body after a battle! Not on a kid barely living day by day. He didn’t need to be a genius to recognize some of the other marks on her body. His own past helped connect those dots, unsure if Steve knew what the little dots in the crook of her elbow meant. The vein in his head might’ve popped was it not for his husband grabbing him for his attention.
“I gotta make a quick phone call, if you two will excuse me,” Tony said getting off the couch and ignoring the desperate look Rhodey sent him. He stepped into the nearby library, able to drone out most of Peter’s ‘music.’ He dialed the number Steve gave him, only now wondering if this was really a good idea as the phone clicked.
“Love you too,” he said before ending the call and putting his phone back in his pocket. He spared a few more moments to feel the peaceful breeze and enjoy the view before he got up to head back.
When she woke, the first thing her mind registered was the smell. It was from a cologne of a man she had thought had died. Wished had died. She blinks her eyes awake, feeling the restraints against her hands as she looks around the small room she was being kept in.
She stared at him, unable to move or say anything as his words set in. She felt frozen and rigid and the combination of anger and betrayal burned inside of her. Her chest actually ached at the confession, confirming her worst suspicions that nobody wanted her. Before either of the men could say another word, she turned on her heels and left to her bedroom.
Tony hadn’t let her say another word. In three quick moves he was in front of her and bringing her into his crushing embrace before quickly sitting down in her spot. She was frozen in his lap, unable to see Steve move behind her to embrace the bear hug, lips resting on the back of her head. Peter had flipped around the couch to join on Tony’s side, snaking his arms around to cling to his crying sister – also partially in the billionaire’s lap.
Her anger momentarily blocked her from noticing someone approaching her slowly before gently sitting next to her. Joey startled when the person touched her arm, turning sharply and wondering for a moment if she was actually dreaming.
He was definitely a cutie, Pete couldn’t lie. And dammit if he couldn’t help himself suddenly feeling protective of the small child looking anxiously between the two men.
As expected, his son was loved by all his teachers. Really, all his kids were just so damn smart and great it was hard not to brag.
“Well...look, if you’re having some sort of gay-crisis then I don’t know how to help you,” Clint bit out, a poor attempt at humor to deflect his own feelings on the matter.
"Fuck yeah," Tony growled in agreement before beginning to drive away. He smiled at his boyfriend, wondering how he every got so lucky, while also cradling the book to his chest.
“You’re going to do the same thing you did when you were four, Master Tony. You shocked yourself when you were playing with some circuit boards and you picked yourself up and kept going. And you will do the same thing this time. You’re going to pick yourself up and persevere, my boy. Your parents are upset, but they love you and won’t let you go through this alone. Neither will Anna or I.” He stayed in his butler’s arms, crying his eyes out until he did the exact thing Jarvis said he would.
“Language,” Tony offered before howling at the pain that instantly blossomed from his ass. The genius could imagine the red hand print and was thankful the lab was sound proof as his husband continued playing their game.
“You did? That’s amazing! See, told you you could do it,” Clint said proudly before giving her a kiss on the cheek.
Steve looked up and smiled at the genius. Tony returned the smile before bending down to kiss his husband. He wrapped his arms around his neck and kissed his cheek a few times as he looked puzzled at the lump.
“Huh. Well. You should know that if you’re ever mean to him, I’ll tell Uncle Rhodey.” That had not been where Steve expected the conversation to go, taking a second before Steve realized he was getting a shovel talk. From a six year old.
As she was getting him some water and aspirin - judging by the rummaging sounds of cabinets – Tony made his way up the bed and under the covers to tuck himself in. Hot tears, unwanted and treasonous, began spilling at the realization that Emerson had seen him drunk. Memories of her case-file came flooding back and only increased the pain in his chest at the sudden anxiety. Her biological father – the fucker who could do this to his own goddamn spawn, he thought bitterly – would drink before beating her. Drink or do drugs before using her and then selling her to his friends to get more drugs and alcohol. Not to mention previous foster fathers who acted similarly. And here he was, lying to her for the last six months that they would give her a better life.
“I think he likes it,” Steve said, feeling warm all over and desperately wanting his mate here to enjoy this moment. “Should we go tell your Grandpa and Nonna to come meet Peter?”
They asked not to know the baby’s gender, wanting to wait until she gave birth to find out about their child.
“Oh my god, Steve,” Tony growled out, putting the picture to the side and attacking his boyfriend with his lips. Steve laughed as Tony pushed him back, crawling on top of him and continuing his attack.
“If it makes you feel better, Thumper.” He was startled when she sat up suddenly at that, bumping the super soldier in the jaw before looking at him with a huff.
He should’ve known better than to do it at school, though. But to be fair, he had had a really shitty day.
"That's still an option?" Bucky asked, unable to keep the hope from his voice as he looked up at Clint through his lashes. He kept his puppy eyes on the blonde, who's stoic look lasted another moment before he sighed heavily.
Steve only made himself more comfortable, grabbing the mass of blankets off the ground, as he responded, “you’re welcome to join me, but no funny business.”
“Harley, you wanna pick the spot for our picnic?” Tony asked his pup, chuckling when the boy took off running and danced at a spot under a tree.
“Better not Grandpa!” a revived Harley called, squirming from his Daddy’s arms to chase after the chuckling older Alpha.
“Yay, mons’ers!” Lilli piped in as she took her brother’s place on Steve’s lap. The blonde leaned down to kiss the tiny brunette’s hair, smiling as he heard Leo agree to the new term.
“No. I honestly didn’t,” he said, hands up in surrender. “It’s just…after being frozen for seventy years…well…if I let every unbelievable thing shock me, I’d have lost my mind a long time ago. Plus, being married to your Dad for twenty years, I’ve learned to accept chaos.” He smiled a little at the thought of his husband as she continued staring at him.
“Nope, not a problem,” the blonde replied looking into his eyes before leaning down to kiss him some more. They stayed like that for a few moments until they both heard a crash. The two sat up together, listening for additional noise when they heard Peter scream.
realizing you’re basically twins?” he asked, throwing some finger pointing in both their directions. Now it was his turn to look confused, stealing a glance at Joey whose brows were still furrowed.
“What’s really wrong, doll? You know I’d pick you over Tony every time right? He has scrawny little arms and you have bulging biceps!”
“Woah, Alexis, we agreed! Nothing to the face. Wouldn’t want the little tattle tale to go crying to her faggy-daddies,” Staci said with a laugh.
“Tony. I am trying to have a serious discussion with you,” his sexy man responded while gently pushing him back.
People started pairing off and Tony suddenly noticed the several pairs of eyes on them. But then Steve pulled him close to his body and slipped his arm around the smaller teen’s waist...and Tony forgot anyone else existed.
[Hey dads, is it cool if I hang out with Xavier after school today?] she lied as she messaged their group chat.
“Yeah I figured you wouldn’t mind, she’s only in town for the weekend,” Obie said passively as he grabbed a menu and began looking at his options.
“– NO POP,” she said, fierce green eyes boring into his blue. She took another pause before continuing.
“Who’s that?” Peter asked as he wiggled past his father to open the door more. “Hello?” he asked as Emerson shrunk back farther away from him. “Hi. My name’s Peter, what’s your name?”
“Just get your drunk ass inside, Buck,” Steve said, pushing his brother through the door and a little away from Tony.
." The super soldier wrapped his arms around his husband as he pulled him back into his embrace, curious as to what the man was up to. He smiled as he rested his head on his beloved's shoulder, who was ordering extra small Iron Man pajamas.
“What did I say about insulting my boyfriend?” James playfully growled above him, straddling the blonde as he pulled back to let Clint catch his breath. Lucky gave him a break at the same time, Clint suddenly noticing James shaking a toy at the pup to distract him.
“Legally…binding?!” Pete asked between puffs of breath. This wiggle worm was considerably more wiggly than the last one…
“Okay,” May began, “what first? I’m particularly interested in leading this conversation and just absolutely validating the shit out of you, but I wanted to give you a chance to steer the convo,” she offered. Joey bit her lip as she smiled at this incredible woman, genuinely thinking her offer over as she chewed her lip for a moment longer.
“Commander, to what do I owe the honor?” Fury took a moment to close the door behind him, walking over to sit across from Steve’s desk.
He’d gotten home before her, which was weird since her train didn’t normally take her that long from school and he had just happened to get off work early today. He tried not to assume the worst, it wasn’t like she was grounded or anything…maybe she went shopping.
“He made me take the yucky medicine,” the pup whined with a pout, which didn’t actually make Steve feel all that bad, especially when his Daddy laughed again.
Sweetly leaning down, inches from his lips before saying, “yup” before taking off running down the stairs.
“Pop!” Peter groaned as he ducked away, the two smiling as they made their way back to their family.
“Suzanne!” Bucky snapped as Andy looked back at the other teen in shock. “That’s not why he’s here. Alright. That’s it. Go away. All three of you. Go watch TV,” James said as he herded the three out of the kitchen.
“Is there a problem in here?” a booming voice asked, the crowd parting as Thor walked over to them, eyeing Brock and James for a moment before crossing his arms over his chest. “If you two wish to fight I suggest taking it outside and away from the house.”
"Well I guess my work here is done," Rhodey spoke up with a choked laugh. Tony sat up with a now sleepy boy to bid his friend farewell.
“Thanks, Pops. Night dads,” he smiled at the two who smiled back before turning back to talk about his secret alter ego.
"Um, Earth to Dad, your sons are rocking an entirely new outfit and you are not snapping any pics," Peter said as Tony turned around to smile at his boys. They were in fact rocking matching black and gold suits complete with gold sunglasses.
dad, Joseph, who my dad told me I was named after…well he met your mom when my dad was like, four? And when Joseph found out your mom was pregnant with you, he told my dad he was going to adopt him and marry your mom. But…then he got sick with cancer. Then, you know…he died when you were like six months old? I don’t know, some of the details are fuzzy. Anyway, I didn’t take Stark as my last name cause I…wait,” she paused…sitting up as if she was sobering up. She handed the ice pack back to Steve hastily and stood up.
“Hmm, so your Pop tanned your behind?” he asked her sympathetically. She actually chuckled at that, nodding while reaching one hand back to subconsciously rub her bottom.
He headed towards the backyard, knowing that they would’ve seen the pup if he'd gone through the front.
. Not necessarily the one you're bonded to or...share DNA with…” Steve admitted with an adorable blush, before turning back to the pup in his arms. “You’re safe, bear. You’re home with me and your Daddy,” the older blonde said, pushing a tiny bit of his own Voice to bring the pup back to them.
“Alright, well if you want to stay down here then I’ll stay with you. No kids allowed down here without adult supervision.” His foster son laughed at that before pointing a finger back at the older man.
Then they made it to the dinosaur museum, the Alpha feeling close to bursting with happiness when the pup grabbed his hand to show him his new favorite dinosaur - the T-Rex.
“The Sarah Rogers Foundation. It’ll help single mothers. Like those in DV relationships, immigrants, homeless, trafficked, in recovery; it’ll act as a resource center as well as a shelter. The whole shebang. What do you think?”
“I think Peter can wait a few more minutes while we shower, that always wakes me right up,” Tony offered after his glare broke and he smiled down at the man.
He wordlessly helped her with the wounds, being as gentle as possible and murmuring sorry’s whenever she winced in pain.
“Actually,” Tony said with a little bit of ire, fingers twitching to grab his phone, “I was under the impression it would be a two person lunch. You see, I didn’t want to be rude,” he finished with a look at Stane, who was still looking at the menu and ignoring the two as if they were bickering children.
“Joey!” he said excitedly as he ran over to the teen, who stumbled a little as the toddler climbed onto her lap. She gently pushed the cup away as she got her bearings, wrapping her arms around the boy in comfort.
The same parent who was always straight forward and honest with her. Who apparently decided to tell his five year old son first.
“I saw Cara, and frankly got tired of seeing your weak game,” she teased at him. She smiled as Cara laughed at her burn, still smiling with the glare Xavier threw at her.
“Come on baby brother, how can I help? Do you need a distraction? We can go down to my shop and tinker with stuff. Or you could help me do laundry?” Steve smiled in spite of his heart aching, loving his brother for trying to help.
. “You know what? Tony was just leaving, right Tony? Okay bye Tony I’ll see you tomorrow pick you up at seven okay text me okay goodbye!” Steve floundered as he pushed his way inside, past his laughing mom who waved at Tony while Steve quickly shut the door. Tony stood there laughing another moment, listening in on Steve try and fail to chastise his mom.
When the cramping got worse, she steeled herself to do what she needed to. Which was difficult, considering the cramping and the idea of not being able to block out what they were doing. She shuffled her way to their bedroom door, hesitating before finally knocking.
“Answer the question, James.” Bucky couldn’t help but laugh at the shorter teen’s insistence, taking a breath before being honest.
“Okay first of all - you’ve totally done that before. So don’t even go there. Secondly, I have to go get Harley and I’ll bring him here - so I’ll only be gone half an hour or so. Tell Pappy if he asks.”
“Anytime Steve,” Sam said confidently back. They looked at each a moment longer, smiles on their faces before Steve made a proposition.
“No, Poppy! I wan’ be a p’incess!” the tiny blonde said with a frown, giving Miles enough time to get away from the other tiny monster attacking him. The teen stood up off the couch and joined the others looking at the tablet, even as Lilli sat there pouting at him.
Steve chose a quiet Italian restaurant that he hoped wouldn’t be crowded or draw any unwanted attention to Tony. He was already there waiting for Steve, having reserved a little booth in the back.
“I saw the pictures. I know what you look like after a seizure, baby. And I know you’re not dumb enough to drink at a school function, let alone with your worst enemy. None of it added up and…I know these last few months have been hard. But I do trust you. And I’m sorry I haven’t been better about that…I saw how scared you were when you first came in here…and after everything you’ve been through tonight…”
On this particular day though, she had a funny feeling as she approached the train stop. An older woman appeared to be staring at her and was standing directly in her path. Joey found herself slowing down a little as the older woman smiled at her.
“He said he’d be your bottom,” she continued pointing to Steve before turning back to Tony. “And he said he’d let you decide, cause you’re the genius…” she continued as the fathers just kept laughing. Poor Xavier was blushing furiously.
“I can’t believe you guys,” she snapped at the man suddenly at her side and handing her a towel. She snatched it from him and began angrily wiping the water off her body.
Her uncle bought it, a deep frown forming on his face. He nodded in sympathy before turning to leave. She followed him, mind racing as she shut the bedroom door.
(they were still debating whether he was lying about that or not, cause it’s definitely a rumor Clint would start of himself)
Something must’ve been missing, because the group Em recognized had started talking loudly at the man, who was no longer alone when a few of his friends joined his side. Peter turned back to Emerson who shot him a quick nod before quickly moving in the opposite direction.
She’d seen it plenty of times before, she just still stared in awe at it whenever she got to see it up close like this.
“I don’t know I didn’t measure it…” Buck said as he trailed off, watching in amazement as he also considered this being the first time they were ever alone together. He’d never spent much time with Clint, but he was starting to wonder if he should change that. “Since when have you been so observant?”
Which he had once explained to her was the point. To give her time to think about what wrongdoing she had done.
Tony got the call while he was at work. Some snot nosed punk used their premature Voice to make Harley kneel for him.
“This is Anthony when he was a baby. Your colorings are different, but I can see him in your nose and pudgy little face. Your Mama was a cute baby, just like you.”
“You wanna stay for dinner, Jim? We’re making tacos,” Steve said when he noticed the time. It was a little past five in the afternoon and Tony suddenly wondered where Barnes was.
Everyone came to a stop when Peter finally got to Wade, who had to clear his throat before beginning.
They eventually released, Tony stealing one more kiss before finally relenting – smiling as the man grinned back and watched him drive away…with a promise of tomorrow.
He pushed reassurance through the bond as well as love, finally smiling when Steve smiled back at him. Tony felt fuzzy inside when he felt loved being pushed back through their bond.
He felt himself relaxing at the words, able to hear the purr in the man’s voice that felt like a small wave rolling over him.
The rest of the dinner went smoothly. Peter sat back as his dads told one or two embarrassing stories from his childhood. Wade laughed along and offered a few stories of his own. He looked over to his sister, who gave him a smile and a wink in return. Peter felt Wade caress his hand with his thumb, glad for the loving gesture. The warmth in his chest blossomed as he watched his family wholly accept his boyfriend.
“Hm, so now you think everyone deserves a happily ever after? Cause I hate to break it to you James, but fairytales ain’t real.”
“–nor should you, because I’m suing your ass and seeing to it you never teach again,” Tony snarled as he stepped closer to the man, never breaking eye contact. Mr. Jefferson had about four inches on her Dad, but that didn’t stop the man from cowering in front of him.
can help your Tati with. Kids really shouldn’t get involved in their parent’s love lives. I wouldn’t expect any of my kiddos to get in the middle of me and Tony.”
"Poor Petey, stuck with this silly Papa and silly bubba," Clint teased, fondly shaking his head at the other blondes.
“Well then, trust me. Go home,” she added with a little glare, going so far as to give him a gentle shove towards the door. “You’ve got an entire team behind you. But right now you need the one in front of you, waiting for you at home, okay?” she suggested more gently as he nodded in agreement, grabbing his things to leave.
He was finally released after Wade had spun him around a few times, glad to finally stop so he could look at the lanterns they had released - floating high in the sky and painting the perfect moment. He laughed with happiness as his parents moved in to hug him in congratulations - confessing that they'd known about it for a few weeks, after Wade had asked for their blessing.
“You wanna put your money where your ugly ass mouth is?” James asked with a smirk, snaking his arm around the blonde’s waist. Clint watched as Rumlow eyed the two for a moment before he pulled his wallet out and put two twenties on the table, eyeing Hannah until he followed suit. Clint pulled out his own wallet and watched as he and James put the money on the table as well.
“Hey, you wanna spend the weekend with Nat and Clint again?” He felt her shift her head around on his chest.
“No you’re right. You caught me. I’ve been lying about being gay all these years. I secretly love vaginas,” he deadpanned. “And also wear porn-staches in my spare time.” His husband finally burst out laughing from that.
“Becca, this is Tony and Harley. Tony, this is my little sister, Becca. And you know those two bums sitting on the couch,” Steve said with a smile as they all walked into the living room, nodding to Bucky and Clint who pouted back at him.
“I’m sorry I wasn’t completely honest with you and I totally understand if this is like, a deal-breaker for you…” Steve rambled on, stopping when he saw Tony shaking his head.
Miles was silently watching the man with an intriguing look on his face, while Emerson was watching with a glare and occasionally grumbling to her self.
“What’d I do?” the brunette asked cautiously as he protectively crossed his arms across his chest, still staying away from his angry husband.
“Yes baby, Steve and I...we have some news for you. You know how Steve and I are bonded and he moved in with us? Well...it turns out that we’ll be adding more to our family…”
They heard gunfire coming from below, unable to place the sound as they heard men scream. They looked at each other, working harder to clear the path; finally able to move it as they rushed down to the tunnels.
And then he flipped to the more adult rated drawings, eyebrows shooting up as he heard his boyfriend chuckle next to him.
“But Shuri promised the vibranium would be here by tomorrow!” he heard his Dad say. That quickly got Peter’s attention – who turned around and was instantly sitting on the arm to his Dad’s inflight chair. His Pop groaned at Peter who was innocently looking at his parents before waving his arms to encourage them to continue.
“–you let me worry about Rumlow, okay? Steve…I think it’s great you found someone. And for the record, you’re not alone in…
“Behave, kids. We have guests,” their Pop said with a pointed look as she went to the kitchen and brought a tray of lemonade. “Harley, would you like some lemonade sweetheart? George also made his famous chocolate chip cookies.”
“…what?” he asked quietly as his brain short circuited. A sneaky grin appeared on her face as the blonde’s brow furrowed in confusion.
“Shit, Jo, that sucks I’m so sorry. Do you know how to do your own inspection?” he asked, sitting up to address her more seriously. She blinked a few times at him, looking thoroughly confused as she slowly sat up to face him.
A sick satisfaction settled in his fuzzy brain, followed by a ping of guilt and regret, followed by more fuzzy satisfaction as the child burst into tears.
His abilities will help him heal, but that didn’t mean it would make it hurt any less. He thrashed as he felt hands try to life his mask up. It was only because of his super-hearing that he picked up the sounds of things whizzing by, suddenly aware the foot was lifting before he heard several thuds. He rubbed his neck as he gasped a few breaths in and out, seeing arrows sticking out of the remaining men – all incapacitated.
“It means at least temporarily adding another member to our family. Taking in a scared shitless kid who desperately needs someone to give a shit,” he said nonchalantly.
He only looked into her mouth, returning the obnoxiousness as she shut it and mock glared at him. He laughed along as he stood up to lead them out of her bedroom.
“Wait!” she cried with her hands extended to stop him. “Aren’t I too old to…” she fully cringed before finishing “…go over your knee?” She opened one eye back at him, opening the other when he actually looked like he was thinking it over.
Pete whispered, getting another chuckle from the men as they both carefully moved to wrap their arms around him.
“You know, maybe that could be a cool project to work with your Daddy in his lab. I’m sure he’d love to help you build an actual robot dinosaur that would be way cooler than some toy.” Steve waited a moment, smiling when he felt a smile against his neck and the tears stopped.
He was actively avoiding the mansion, which didn’t even feel like home anymore. Not that it ever really had. But one night he snuck in, able to tiptoe past his father’s drunken/glass throwing rant to grab a bag of clothes. If he was to show his face, there was not a doubt in his mind Howard would take his anger out on him.
“JARVIS, see what Barton, Banner and Romanoff are doing. Invite them up for celebratory pizza,” Tony said to the ceiling. Conversations picked up as the others quickly arrived, Daci remaining quiet as she watched the group get loud and interact with one another.
She jumped in their combined embrace as they clung to her, both men fully crying at seeing her safe and sound. She heard Shuri get out of the car as the two men brought her to the ground in a loving dog-pile.
“I should get going,” he said breaking the silence. “I’ve got some toddler-proofing to do before tomorrow.”
Steve rolled his eyes and couldn’t really be mad about living with children, his husband included. He shook his head as he started making the batter.
Her bottom seared in pain from his big thighs, reminding her how stupid she had been. But his arms reminded her of safety and love and washed away what guilt she had left over from her exhaustive day.
He was taller than Steve by at least an inch, obviously toned even under his expensive looking clothes and sporting an impressive beard. Dirty blonde hair and light brown eyes, guessing he was probably late thirties.
“She’s your handler, Bucky! You’re not even supposed to be legally dating her! She’s a goddamn SHIELD agent taking advantage of you-”
“Because! She…insulted my dads…” He softened a little at that, though not entirely – as they’ve had this conversation
“Tony, baby, your godmother wants a word,” Sarah said with a smile, handing him the phone as the family went inside to give him some privacy. Steve stayed behind a moment longer, placing a gentle kiss on his cheek before following the others inside. Tony watched them with a smile of his own before bringing the phone to his ear.
His daughter brought him back to the present, waving her arms in front of him to get his attention. The teen was in her pajamas, unfortunately not matching Tony's, even after he gave her his best puppy eyes. They were waiting for Steve to finish putting Miles to bed before deciding on what to do for her birthday in two days.
“Just ignore him,” Tony said absently, eyes fixed on the machine before him as a screwdriver suddenly appeared in his hand.
“He said…he said he’d sell me if I was bad…” she whimpered out before bursting into tears. And Tony suddenly found himself (not for the first time, mind you) thankful that the rat bastard of a father was already long dead.
"Are you gay?" he asked, causing the two fathers to choke on their breakfast. She had never officially came out, though the fathers could've guessed when the only crush she's had since they met was on a certain princess.
scariest monster, Buck,” Steve said pointedly. His brother just rolled his eyes at him and turned back to smile at his daughter.
“See? I told you nature is the worst,” Tony grumbled as Steve carried him piggyback the mile back to their villa. The man had tripped over a goddamn tree root and rolled his ankle. Although, if he was being honest, he did not necessarily mind the ride…
how the prequels somehow ruined the sequels of whatever franchise he was talking about. He was glad Sam was his partner, only offering the man a “happy birthday” and paid for coffee. He nodded along and smiled until they got a call from dispatch.
“Tony, it’s fine. No need to make up a lie,” he said as nonchalantly as he could, moving to take off and continue his run when gentle hands stopped him.
“Aw, of course not. You are a perfectly adequate parent,” she said with a shit eating grin. His jaw hooked to the side as he raised his brows at her. That ‘
“Steven!” Tony cried out as the man ignored him in favor of walking back to the house. The brunette retaliated in kind by smacking the blonde’s ass, which only got him one in return. “Put me down you caveman!” he tried again, though the laughter was clear in his voice.
“Lead the way.” Steve followed the man, stopping at Tony’s recovery room to show Harley his Daddy through the glass. “
Of course, it was only after Happy had dropped her off that she got the message from Xavier that he couldn’t go. His sister was going into labor and he was the only one there to drive her.
He shook his head from those thoughts, focusing on the burgers instead of going down that road. Sam had returned from “grabbing more seasoning” and Steve was thankful for the interruption.
She lets her mind drift back to the present to enjoy her current view. She was looking at the flowers on display outside of a small floral store, waiting for her Pops to grab their lunch from across the street before they would head to the park for a picnic. She bent down to smell some daffodils, taking her time to enjoy all the flowers. She turned her focus on some colorful tulips when she suddenly had the feeling that someone was watching her, fear ran up her spine as that feeling never turned out well for her in her past. She turned slowly to a figure standing a few feet away staring at her. Emerson could feel her heart stop.
“No you can’t!” she complained after bouncing a little, smiling up at him as she grabbed a pillow and threw it at his head. He caught it before that could happen.
“Nice shot Katniss,” Tony said to the girl, who pinched her face back at him. “She...is a fictional character who shoots bow and arrows really well. Like how I sometimes call Clint ‘Legolas’,” Tony said with a wave of his hands.
“Could you help me make some coffee?” Steve asked before she could answer, ignoring the frown Tony gave him. The brunette relented, standing up to walk to the kitchen. Steve followed behind, happy to explain once he made sure she went to do as he’d told her to.
“Yeah, but…” his Dad said before trailing off in thought. He stared at his shorter parent for a long moment before asking.
"Not today, I need more time to plan it. For the King, of course," she said quickly as she made her way to her room.
"Well it is and I do so there," the older man said immaturely, even sticking his tongue out for good measure.
He was fifteen. And while he loved the two, he had other things he’d rather be doing on a Saturday night than watch his niece fall on her butt.
“I…may have had some doubts and wanted…reassurance,” the genius explained. When Steve opened his mouth to answer, he heard movement behind him in the apartment. Then they both heard the sound of glass shattering followed by a “fuck!”
Emerson turned to Peter, “so, does this mean you want to be an Avenger?” The three men were frozen in place, that particular question hadn’t been asked aloud yet.
