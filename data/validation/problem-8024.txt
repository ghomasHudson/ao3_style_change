“C’mon, didn’t you catch that line earlier about a ‘very distinctive labia’—”
what’re you all gonna pick, do you think?
no wonder Steve was worried
explain
There’s a photo of an old Avengers lineup still hanging inside. It’s remarkably intact. A single crack in the glass. Giving it his attention is a sufficient excuse for him to keep his back to Tony’s approaching footsteps. “I make mistakes,” Steve says. He expects his voice to be heavy with sorrow. Instead it’s low and grim and too revealing.
—but he doesn’t, he’s never seen this woman before today, he shouldn’t know her voice, it shouldn’t make his blood run cold with dread, he shouldn’t know it well enough to recognize it when she says,
“Come in,” Steve calls, dragging a hand over the holograms to close them.
“It’s Gucci,” she says, smiling proudly.
Nat, Pepper, and Rhodes devote themselves to showing off their favorite video clips. Carol begs Jen for a massage, and ends up sitting on the floor so Jen can reach her shoulders from the couch. T’Challa and JARVIS are deep in a conversation about flexible body armor, and Jan is taking photos of everyone—mostly Tony, who is posing and shooting kisses at her phone. Steve watches them both.
Tony looks at his hands. They’re tangled up in each other, and though he doesn’t remember arranging them like that, he tries to center himself on them the way he would on a stubborn knot. Remove ring finger A from between pinky and pointer finger B.  “The—the stuff at the end, yeah. Of course.”
“Never,” Steve says, a smile in his voice that makes Tony melt.
“I love you,” Steve whispers, wrapping his arms around Tony.
I am a comment-consuming lich. Please consider leaving a comment and feeding my lifeforce.
“What do you think I’m trying to do?” It’s the loudest Tony’s raised his voice. His rage and frustration is a mirror of Steve’s own.
“That fortune is for you, Mister Stark.”
After Tony’s eaten, Steve sits and watches him. The smell of blood and sex overpowers the scent of ammonia. The pain is ebbing, replaced by a tide of white noise. Tony’s eyelids are heavy. His mind slows and stretches like taffy. “You drugged me,” he says, shaking his head against the grogginess.
Tony looks chagrined rubs at the back of his neck and looks over at the wall. “Close enough,” he says at last.
Nat rolls her eyes. “Yes, he was just in my computer science class giving a guest lecture on machine learning.”
hey thor! it’s clint. do you know if your sibling is on campus?
Tony and the Doctor figured out how to get us all out of here!
"I have to go." Steve stands all at once, with a speed he usually reserves for battle. "I know you have a lot of questions, and I'll try to answer them." Once, Steve would've followed that by reminiscing about the questions Tony answered for him when he first came out of the ice. Instead there's a beat where such a memory could be spoken aloud, and isn't. "I'll be here the next time you wake up. I promise."
Tony lifts a hand and cups Steve’s face. “We are,” he agrees, and this time it sounds like
Tony looked Steve in the eye and said, “I had pancakes and tea for breakfast. Um? I was trying to say that.”
Tony Stark, the most advanced manufacturer of guns and weapons on the continent, one of the only men in the world who could make a device capable of such a thing, is crouched beside him, blood drying on his fingertips, shaking.
Maybe it should be frightening: he’s pinned, his armor gone, like a vivisected animal held open on a board with straight-pins.
Steve rests his hand over his dog tags, his fingers curling around the metal. Tony wants a reason to believe him, Steve wants to show Tony what he means to him, and this will have to do. It’s too revealing, but—it’s all he has.
Promise me this means you stop texting me and Winter every time Tony breathes near you
Steve darts out of the workshop and if it looks like he’s fleeing the most embarrassing conversation of his life, well, there’s no reason Tony would be watching him, right? Yeah. Tony’s probably already forgotten everything that just happened.
“Of course I do.” Tony’s voice stayed steady, but his hand wasn’t as he reached out and undid his own cuff.
where are you now?
People screamed when Steve stepped onstage. He filled Radio City Music Hall, the Hammerstein Ballroom, the Metropolitan Opera House. Hell, he filled Madison Square Garden. The crowds pulsed like a fresh injury. Moved in an eerie unity, like a vast school of fish.
“Presently, yes.”
Jen finds out. “You’re going to read it on the stand,” she tells him. “You
are you doing?”
– Whiskey
is running on fumes, and is barely a safe distance from the newborn star when the ship’s instruments alert them to the imminent arrival of three more Star Culler ships.
Tony knew with every fiber of his being that what Carol was doing was wrong. That Ulysses' visions were nothing more or less than profiling. That trusting them had led to the deaths of two of his dearest friends. But if Steve told him to stand down, Tony would. And that frightened him—both the certainty of it, and the knowledge that innocents would die.
there is some shit happening here
there’s all this white marble and gold railings and these big 3-storey windows with giant curtains
sit around and wait until a bunch of pigeons land on the roof of the archives I guess
Shards of the Skrull Iron Man’s faceplate scatter over the ground. Its chestplate is dented, caved in just over where a human heart would be, and one of the palm repulsors has gone dim. The other Captain America is favoring his left leg, his reactions are a fraction of a second too slow, and it looks like his jaw is dislocated. The false Iron Man approaches Steve from behind while the Skrull Captain America falters from Steve’s last hit. Steve slams one elbow back, hitting Iron Man’s helmet, striking out with the shield on his other arm.
“How ‘bout you let me get a wink of goddamn rest and you work on savin’ your own hide, then,” Steve says, but his heart isn’t in it. His anger’s fled from him.
Steve releases Tony’s wrist to take hold of his chin, forcing their eyes to meet. “He loved you and admired you, but it wasn’t enough. He knew he couldn’t trust you. You’d only hurt him and use him, wouldn’t you?”
hey so sorry to text you out of nowhere and maybe this is really random but are you at the timeless archives right now
The cliche is to compare the feeling of your soulmate touching your mark to sex or orgasming. But that’s wrong, Tony thinks, humming in satisfaction. It’s a sensation of satedness—satisfied, languid, post-coital. Instead of urgent and anticipatory, it’s steady and joyful. Tony’s gotten sparks of it in Steve’s presence before, lit ashes spit out by fire. Now the heat is constant, blooming out of that point of contact to the rest of his body.
“No. Not to me.” Tony looked back up at Steve’s face. “It's not silly. What if we find out true love’s kiss
Wormseed grins like a weasel in a henhouse.
about in anything beyond the most basic way. I don’t know if someone has.”
He chains the collar to the bed and then leads Steve off the mattress and onto the floor. “You’re sleeping there tonight,” Tony says. He tosses Steve a blanket, saying, “Don’t try to pretend you don’t hate the cold,” then settles into bed and turns away from Steve.
“Do I act like someone who wants you?”
So that’s that gone to plan, at least.
“Hello,” Tony says. “I reckon I know this part of the Orpheus story.”
Do you need me for something? Because Kate and I are actually in the middle of some stuff
There’s this move Steve practices with the shield where he holds it in exactly the same place, like it’s stationary, fixed to some invisible point, even as the rest of his body keeps moving. This is what he does now with his eyes as he shifts in the bed and untangles himself from the sheets: they’re locked on Tony, motionless while the rest of him shifts.
Steve finds Tony on a lounge chair wearing a tiny red bathing suit. The lenses of his sunglasses are tinted a matching crimson; the thin metal frames are gold. The sun is bright enough that Tony’s closed eyelids are visible through the tinted lenses.
chuk chit chukk
cut the shit. what did steve do?
“It’s water,” Tony tells him hoarsely, as if he knows what Steve’d been thinking.
“Okay.”
“What, because now you feel bad? Because now I’m here and you have to deal with me?”
Deals 1520 damage, plus 115 for each Team Iron Man Escalation tile, 135 per tile if target is Team Cap, or 165 per tile if target is Cap.
“Are we ever?”
Steve kisses back, hard and eager and utterly straightforward. The intensity sets Tony trembling. Steve’s hand lights on Tony’s waist, a hummingbird hovering to suckle at a sweet bloom. It pulls Tony to him as surely as if Tony were trapped there.
Tony’s going to have to pay his tailor at least triple to get Steve’s new suit done by then. He’s not letting Steve do this in something off-the-rack. That’ll help with the stress, too: Steve in a bespoke three-piece. God, he’s going to be a vision.
See anything cool?
The truth is that this story doesn’t have a moral at all.
Steve laughs, the vapor of his breath highlighted by the gold beam of a streetlamp. “Remember the first time we met?”
was just the name of a Tom Waits album,” Tony says at last.
“Sub-director? I bet she loved that.”
because i’m afraid of her
“Fuck you,” Tony bites out, surging and twisting against the hands gripping him.
“Should we hang up and wait for them to be on?”
“Now would be a good time to skin that piece I know you've got up your sleeve,” Rogers tells him.
“You’re such a fucking mess,” Tony says approvingly, then draws Steve in and kisses him over the gag, lapping at the drool dripping out of the corners of Steve’s mouth, skimming his teeth over Steve’s lips, mouthing at the bar lodged between Steve’s teeth. “If you’re good, I’ll take this off you tomorrow. Give you some water. Let you blow me. Can you be good, Steve?”
Tony was in love with him. He said it like it was a given, something Steve already knew, and here, now, alone on Tony’s bed, face crusted with dried spit and come, Steve knows it’s true. It’s this thought that curls him into a ball, clutching his knees to his chest, letting sobs wrack his entire body. He cries until he’s empty. His body is a void, his tear ducts dry. He’s filled only by the gag and the plug, the places where Tony left substitutes for himself.
Heroes, Avengers, Team Cap, Secret Avengers
There’s no reply but the sound of another step. He doesn’t know why he’s so sure it’s Steve. It could be anyone.
I really appreciate it. seriously
“What’s weird is that Otto only moved here a couple weeks ago, and you keep insisting he’s been running the diner for months.”
4 Stars
Steve rides the light rail toward Antioch this time, then back to the San Francisco airport. He watches the immobile faces shared by everyone crowded into the car during rush hour, unchanging even as the train screeches and rattles.
Instead he turns a corner and skitters to a halt in front of a dozen men in Hydra uniforms.
“I’m sorry.”
“Tony’s fine,” Rhodes interrupts. “I’ll tell him you stopped by, okay?”
“I know it’s different because everything you’re going through is real. You really do have asthma and sinusitis and heart problems and everything else, I’m not saying I know exactly what you’re feeling,” Tony says, talking very fast now. “I just meant, when I’m going through that, I can’t
“Yes,” she agrees.
“Perfect,” Spencer says, sounding glad but somehow still like he’s a snarling dog guarding an injured puppy.
“That’s why we’ll find evidence o’ who did.”
It’s several minutes more before Tony stirs. His eyes dart around the room, skittering over Steve’s face and where his hand rests in Steve’s own.
enjoy your easy A
How can Steve look at him like that, after all Tony’s done? Reality should preclude it, the way it precludes the destruction of the Gems.
Tony’s eyes are wide and confused, with tears peeking in at the corners. “Steve—”
Well they were blue, which was weird, but it was definitely Tony.
, a lavender-skinned woman from the Crystalline Moon of Urlak named Klithua Aniig, spends her travels with Brickenn Jamith trying and failing to learn more about him.
chiik!
“Tony,” Steve says to the lights of Brooklyn, scattering and unfocusing through condensation forming on the window. His voice is too quiet to reach Tony, ice cold in his casket, unknowingly traversing the stars—is too quiet even to reach the streetlamp across the street. “I love you. I should’ve listened to you. I should’ve—you’re my best friend, and I wasn’t there for you. I couldn’t admit I might be wrong. I wish I’d told you. I wish you’d known how loved you are.”
“I’ll run laps another time,” Steve says firmly. Then he starts to second-guess himself. “Or, I could do that now, if you have something else—”
Apologies for not getting this up earlier in the day! I think every family in the county not observing Christmas picked the same restaurant mine did.
“No, Tony, I.” Steve pinched the bridge of his nose. “I hate you.”
It’s a lie that they both want to be true. Or pretend is true. It’s unfair to insist that it is. Tony finally shuts up, looking stricken, and Steve relishes it. Whatever else, he’ll see Tony confront what he’s done.
more or less yeah
Steve pulls back the bedcovers and lays down next to Tony. He rolls to his side and slings an arm over Tony’s hips, its weight holding him in place. “Let me know if you need anything,” Steve says, like he’s heading to the kitchen for a glass of water and wants to know if Tony needs a refill of coffee. “I’m right here.”
“What do you
that’s the bit we couldn’t figure out
“I’m not sorry,” Steve said, his eyes going wide.
“I,” Tony starts, trying to think over the alarms going off in his head. “I didn’t know we were on Steve and Tony terms. Before—before Pleasant Hill. You were angry with me. With good reason.”
“Do you—” Steve faltered. Tony wanted to tell him he never had to worry ever again, not when it came to Tony. “Do you want—”
He thinks all of those questions have the same answer.
This earns Steve a flick on the nose. “I’m prettier, too,” Tony says through a grin. “Which sign was your favorite, then?”
As any self-respecting math genius will tell you, however, correlation is not causation.
When Tony looks up, Steve’s staring at Tony's wrist. Tony's eyes dart away, his face heating. "I learned my lesson," Tony says with more force.
"I was going to be on your side," Tony says. On the back of his hand, a line runs through the center of a series of diamonds, arcs, and triangles. The shape in the middle is smudged. "I can't fight you again." It sounds less like a statement and more like he's trying to convince himself.
“Don’t try to make me so angry that I want to kill you,” Steve says and, oh, there’s the fury again, low and fierce.
“I want to help Tony,” Steve tells the glowing electronic panel at the door. He looks up at where he thinks some of the cameras JARVIS uses might be.
“It’s past ten at night, indulge me.”
“Why not?”
“Sure thing, Steve,” Friday says. “Initiating blackout within a 15-foot radius of your comm signature.”
– Made fine, dandified
much worse, himself, to Tony. Tony entertains the thought that this is what Steve is hung up on—misplaced guilt over their past fights and fear of repeating them now if Tony learns why he did whatever he did—then discards it.
Tony stops trying to keep time. Steve hits him when he misbehaves. When Tony refuses Steve’s urgings to hail Hydra, he whips Tony’s feet. When Tony refuses to speak entirely, he hurts Tony until he screams.
“Beautiful” is a term which here means perilously cold, lacking in resources to support human life, inhabited by wildlife with very large teeth, and infiltrated by increasing numbers of enemy agents.
“That is exactly wrong!” Tony said, shaking his head. Then he rolled his eyes and turned to Rhodes. “I mean, I agree with what Captain Tightpants just said.”
there are no salient reasons to think you would not be compatible romantically
“Time to go, then?” Tony asks, sounding more collected than he is.
He needs it closer to him. Now.
With his mobility limited like this, all Steve can do is try to use his neck and shoulders to draw his mouth along Tony's length. Tony quickly loses patience with this and grabs Steve by the hair, using it to drag his head up and down. Then he grows bored of that, too, and grips Steve by the back of the neck, shoving Steve’s face down onto his cock and bucking his hips so it hits the back of Steve’s throat. The freshly-shaven hair at the base of his cock scratches Steve’s dry lips.
"Everything I've done, I did to keep you safe. I thought even if I wasn't yours, you were mine, and I wanted to protect you. And I know I did it all wrong, and I thought I knew—I thought I'd learned that I can't do that, can't do anything right, without you by my side. When you showed me—" There aren't words for how Tony felt in that moment, when Steve bared his soulmark to him. He'd thought he understood everything, then. "When I knew that I was your soulmate, I swore to myself I'd never act without you again."
Tony prides himself on his cleverness and quickness of thought, but some sentimental corner of his brain refuses to accept what’s happening. He thought he’d be ready. He thought he’d have more time. He’d hoped that if Steve would just listen to him—but it’s okay. It’s okay. He didn’t really think he could change Steve’s mind.
Steve pushes himself off the bar to his feet. “Let me guess: Fisk's boys.”
and you’ll just never see my secret rooms
Destroy all Escalation tiles if there are at least 6 Iron Man Escalation Tiles. Generate 2 Red AP, 2 Yellow AP, and 1 Green AP per tile destroyed and 1 Purple AP for every 2 tiles destroyed.
Did Tony want anyone other than Steve to hear this? It doesn’t matter, because Tony’s gone, and everyone thinks they get a say in what his legacy means.
“Can I ask you something?”
Deals 1100 damage, plus 73 for each Team Cap Escalation tile, 98 per tile if target is Team Iron Man, or 105 per tile if target is Iron Man.
Loki’s smile widens. “Armor Man,” she says with relish.
competent ones?
No. How dare the Skrull say his name. This isn’t Tony. Steve’s double doesn’t get to pretend at Steve’s grief.
“What, you mean at the gala that’s
Natasha glances over at him from the cockpit. She tilts her head at him and says, “You have something you want to say about Tony.”
her numerous times and the one time he had actually hit her, it had been to reach the target behind her.
“Even better,” Tony beams.
Grants a burst of 40% health.
what did you learn something about your future or something?
The water is a little sandy, and Steve thinks he can taste the desert sun. It’s the most wonderful thing he’s ever put in his body. “Y’know the way outta here?”
Magic is real, and Tony hates it.
Victor waits for him in the sitting room closest to the stables, and Tony spares a moment’s gratitude that he didn't come out to talk while Tony was standing about in Apple’s stall, petting her mane and talking to her like she might answer back. There are bits of hay and horsehair all over his fine borrowed suit, not that Tony cares a continental. Victor is in his armor and cloak as always. Before him at the table, like a place setting for some bibliophagic soiree, is the Book of Sins.
“I will not allow any living being to pass me, nor will I share what I know; not without receiving something in exchange.”
Steve opens his eyes. Tony has a hand on his shoulder, steadying him.
Coming up next week: Steve's cock. (Again.) Steve and Tony have a conversation with each other. Will one of them finally ask the other on a date?! (Yes.)
Steve nods. “Other stuff, too,” he says. “But I guess that’s the big one. They gave me some inhalers, it helps a lot.” He thinks but doesn’t say:
Steve notices the hickeys while Tony fucks him. They’ve bloomed into patches the color of worn ballet slippers. The way they dot Tony’s flawless chest is almost artful, disorder drawing attention to the perfection underneath.
It is something of a relief when, after the latest turn of the channel, he sees a steed blocking the way—though he knows it should be anything but. Behind it, the way branches, for the first time, into half-a-dozen paths.
Maybe tomorrow, Stark won't be roostered when Steve finds him.
“Sure you can,” Tony says. “I could make you that armor I keep talking about. That would help. You wouldn’t be a supersoldier inside it, but it’s nearly as good on the outside. Most of your health issues are at least treatable now, you know.”
“That shower thing was amazing,” Tony says by way of greeting, striding in and pulling an armchair up to Steve. He’s wearing silk pajamas and wool slippers, and is carrying a half-empty mug of what smells like mocha.
Tony scoffs. “Cheddar, JARVIS, do you even have to ask?”
When Steve wakes, Tony’s sitting on top of the covers, spine straight, gazing at Steve.
.” He has a particular fixation on flaying Tony alive. “Sharp knife. Or a dull one. Maybe a potato peeler. Or just a bullwhip. String him up and go at it.” His laughter, though, is a joyful chortle—it should be the laugh of a kinder man.
All at once Steve is on his feet, eyes wide.
– Real tough guy, dangerous man
how to get back to our version of the timeless archives
Tony scrubs a hand over his face. Of course he is. “Add to the list, please: look into limiting the data passed on by the nanite network.”
“Don’t need a book from Hell to make that,” Stark agrees.
—it’s hard not to imagine—
“Don’t pretend you don’t love my singin’ voice, Sheriff. What’ll I serenade you with tonight? How ‘bout ‘Down in the Valley’?”
is clint with you?
“Would I want to know that the universe I was in had been changed, some part of reality or time or whatever? Yes, of course I’d want to know. Wanna tell me what you’re thinking?”
“I tell ya what,” Steve begins, “Y’all pack up what’s left. Tony and I’ve had quite a time of it, and Tony’s nearly had the life sucked outta him. I’m gonna take him back to his forge so I can look after him. When he’s well and rested, we’ll tell you everythin’ you wanna know.” With that, he gets to his feet. He offers a hand and pulls Tony up with him.
Because then, Tony was there to show him around. The thought creeps into Steve’s thoughts without words, jealous and cruel. But when Tony stays here, he’ll be learning what
Steve may be a member of the Illuminati now, but that doesn’t mean he’s forgotten everything that’s happened: that Tony kept that secret from him in the first place; that he promised Tony he’d be held accountable for his sins; that Tony wielded the Infinity Gauntlet; that Tony claimed to have destroyed the Gems, only to keep them secret again.
“We’re in,” Parker replies immediately. “I haven’t stolen a Caravaggio since 2003!”
Mayor Hill nods politely.
The damage they’ve done is stunning.
“Not even the dancing girls’ve heard a peep ‘bout any magic book.”
“Think I can catch a ride?” Steve tries a smile. It’s a weak one, but it’ll do.
we’ve discussed the job,” Spencer says.
“You think your sheriff friend would approve of you laying claim to another man’s property?”
“Yeah.” Tony picked at the hem of his sheets. “I’ve hated you for a long time.”
“You’d erase the database,” Steve repeats, like something about this makes no logistical sense.
Steve reaches out and tugs the closed book out from Tony’s hands.
Destroy all Escalation tiles if there are at least 5 Iron Man Escalation Tiles. Generate 1 Red AP per tile destroyed and 1 Yellow AP for every 2 tiles destroyed.
I am saying it but I do so based on observation, not in an attempt to placate you
“She’s the boss,” Haridson points out wryly.
Natasha shrugged one shoulder. “Then there’s no problem.” She flashed him a brief smile, then headed down the hallway. “You coming?” she called over her shoulder.
are you in danger?
so you don’t think he’s upset that he’s stuck with me and not with one of you guys instead?
"I want us to be," Steve says.
Tony lifts one arm—even doing that taxes his weakened muscles—and brings one of the symbols on his skin up to his nose. The exertion leaves him a little light-headed. The paint smells resiny, almost like turpentine. If he wipes away some of the markings, will it affect the spell? Will whatever practitioner placed them there be able to tell? He lets his arm fall and leans over to take another sip of water. He must be trying to move too fast, because he feels dizzy. Deep, slow breaths. Slow sips. Inhale, exhale. In. Out.
Out of his peripheral vision he sees Natasha trying to catch his eye. She gives an approving nod.
When Steve wakes on the floor of his bedroom the next morning, his body is young and flawless and every bit as strong as it looks. He has a vial of dormant Extremis in his pocket, a note rubber-banded to it. It reads,
Around them, cooling fans whir softly. The sound of a fabricator working is dulled by walls and distance. Music plays, something Tony wasn’t listening to in the first place, volume so low he couldn’t make out lyrics, just a steady buzz to match the chatter of his brain.
Tony slips a thumb under Steve’s wrist-cuff, and Steve shudders. Tony grins in satisfaction; they’re still soulmates, of course. He’s sure now that they always have been. Certainly, no matter what Steve becomes in the future, he’ll belong to Tony.
Their time there involved foraging for food, huddling for warmth, narrowly avoiding a polar bear who had wandered far south of its usual habitat, and a gaping chasm of truth where Natasha had only ever encountered lies. It later came to include capture, torture, brainwashing, a close-quarters knife fight, a dozen gallons of spilled blood, and Natasha evading pursuers to find James nude, unarmed, and asleep in foot-deep snow.
about time you thought to contact me, Barton
Reed speaks as a character witness for him; Steve’s surprised Reed even knew the trial was happening.

“You’re going back too?” Steve can barely let himself hope.

“Yeah? How so?”
Steve had been training with Winter last night. He wonders whether Loki isn’t helping him any more, or if Loki just didn’t know. “And he’s okay now?”
Trees splinter and uproot, falling aside for a Tyrannosaurus rex that stomps into the battlefield. Its roar is earsplitting, shaking Steve to his bones. The sound is palpably
Steve. Steve. Finite. If—

“It was the liquor,” Stark says. “But it wasn’t only that. Worley, ah. Honton, that is. He saw me with a fella. Bit of a compromisin’ position.”

Maybe they’ll keep him here forever.
one or the other. Natasha was not ready to fully accept that the implication of James' question was entirely true, but the tone in which he uttered the words was so convincingly lost and broken that she assessed him as being either truthful or one of the most impressive liars she had ever encountered.
those would work
– A powerful punch or blow
If that sockdolager was affecting, the time it takes Rogers to draw, turn around, and blast the man who’d been slinking up with his piece in hand is something else again. Tony doesn't think it's just because his brain isn't moving very fast at the moment.
Tony pulls out his sunglasses, sets them on, and turns to give Jan a peck on the forehead, holding the pose long enough for her to get a few pictures. Steve pretends to himself that the tightness in his throat is some kind of reaction to the booze. He’s never gotten drunk before, after all.
Steve shifts his weight onto his knees, relieving the weight on Tony’s chest and shoulders. His hands fall to Tony’s wrists, pinning them as he rocks slowly against Tony’s mouth. Tony’s shoulder isn’t ready for his arm to do anything but hang limply at his side, and now Steve is holding it in place, letting it take his weight. Agony wells up inside him, spreading into his skull and across his vision until everything dims.
At least it’s a distraction from feeling self-conscious about how messy his room is. He tosses some energy drinks and power bars into his bag too, for good measure, and is struggling with the zipper when he notices Tony watching him. He suppresses the shivering feeling crawling up his spine. “What?”
Steve hasn’t seen Reed since his trial. He doesn’t know the last time he saw Black Bolt.  And there’s a body bag on the floor in front of them. “What is this?” Steve says.
“What, this giant slab in the middle of the room?”
“Yeah, it just comes on suddenly, and there’s not a lot he can do about it.”
Tony’s found a secret door in one of the bookcases. We’re going through to see if there’s a way down from the other side.
Tony’s dragoon revolver is in his hands before he can remember where he'd put it. “No!”
Steve tries to relax his hold and his voice. “We’re not doing this right now.”
“Okay,” Steve says.
you didn’t think I’d be able to help
I just
“I broke it off,” Stark continues, staring at his hands, “because it all’d gone to blazes. It was the only thing I could do. Hell, she wanted me to.”
Steve throws the bowling ball—just throws it, like it’s a beachball—across the room and in one motion grabs the guy in the purple hat, flipping him onto his back with a growl.
Time accelerates, like a bullet, then stops short just as abruptly. Steve’s dressed for court and the letter is in his hands, the creases in the paper showing the wear of how many times it's been folded and unfolded.
so if we’re here at the same time he is we’re probably okay
“Cheddar cheese popcorn or regular, Sir?” JARVIS intones.
“You know how I think about you.”
No. There’s no time for that.
Heads up that most of the ableist sentiment is I'm this chapter, and not all of it is addressed as such within the text.
spring to mind. He pictures carved posts, piles of cushions, velvet upholstery. He doesn’t know where it comes from, when his little room above the garage had made this place look positively extravagant. “It could be more…”
“So that’s it, then,” he bites out. He feels huge, brutish, standing here gnashing his teeth and lashing out in mindless rage. “Ten years of friendship, and I kill you, just like that.”
“Stop.” Steve’s voice. Steve’s here.
please tell me you’re quoting firefly right now
“Yes, that’s exactly what I’m trying to say.”
The Skrull Captain America is still trapped under not only Steve’s weight, but now half of Tony’s too. Steve rips the shield off his double’s forearm, snapping the straps, and tosses it to the side. The move disarms his opponent, but it also gives the Skrull the opportunity to drag Tony off himself.
Steve lets Tony take his time, watches as Tony ostentatiously bends over to retrieve a cocktail glass from a slender acrylic side table. Wind skims across the surface of the swimming pool, rippling Tony’s reflection. He swirls the pale chartreuse alcohol before drinking it. Vapor sublimates off the foggy, frozen glass as Tony knocks it back, leaving only a thin medallion of lime.
and to think we once complained about the Archives’ wifi reception
the autumn he turned eighteen. He found it at the back of a junk shop and paid a nickel for it, along with three other yellowing science-fiction novels, and read it in stolen moments on the weedy lawns of Central Park. He found it unremarkable at the time: it was only one of several space operas he read that summer featuring stoic men, accompanied by scantily-clad alien women, who traveled from one exotic planet to another.
“Can I kiss you?” Steve asks.
He thinks small.
“I was trying to offer you amnesty!”
“Are you volunteering to redecorate?”
“Yes,” Tony says immediately. He doesn’t want to compromise. He’s right, he believes in this. But this is unsustainable, and if there’s any other way, a way where Steve doesn’t fight him, he’ll find a way to swallow his pride.
those—I did trying to protect you. Love makes even me stupid, apparently.”
There are threats, battles, near apocalypses. Disruptions to the timeline, a fight over the Infinity Gems, aliens and villains. It may as well be an office job. New problems and crises, hours of overtime, work that’s become familiar and mundane. Rinse and repeat. He doesn’t need much sleep, and there’s always another catastrophe. Failing that, there’s always paperwork.
“No. Please don’t. Definitely not any time soon.”
When Tony passes by the library where Victor has been holed up with the book, he thinks thoughts that don't belong to him. They sound enough like his own voice in his head to leave him with a nauseated feeling.
“I know you do,” Steve assures him. “Just in case.”
Tony takes a step back. No. This isn’t supposed to happen. Not now. This isn’t part of it.
Steve makes for the nearest elevator. “Friday, blackout please? And, can you keep anyone else out of the elevator?”
“I know exactly who Lukin is, Captain. Knowing when the CEO of a megacorporation interested in buying us out is actually a fascist supervillain is, as you can imagine, a crucial aspect of my job. So I know you’ll agree that stopping him from taking over Stark Industries is my top priority. Unless, of course, you have proof of his crimes. That’d save us all a lot of trouble.”
Steve reaches for him, cups his face in one hand. Tony lets him. He touches Tony just on the outside boundaries of his body, like he’s trying to lift a shed dragonfly wing by its edges.
“Think addlin’ the brains you got under that hat gonna help with that?”
He’d come here hoping for a last chance to talk to Steve. Steve, apparently, came here to end this forever.
have been convened by any means short of sorcery. Since it’s magic he’s looking for, he takes the manor’s appearance as a sign he’s in the right place.
Pyrotechnic stars launch from the hidden barrel in his index finger and explode a foot above their heads into a burst of fuchsia.
right okay cool
“No, it’s five times more. Problem?” Tony repeats.
"Civilian" here means a bystander who is not an active member of law enforcement or peacekeeping efforts, and therefore not involved in a conflict being handled by the Avengers.
“I didn’t—”
Tony accepts the change of subject with a beautiful grin. His face is still so close to Steve’s, close enough to see the short bristles of stubble that have grown over the day and long night. “Aren’t they? C’mon, have another one.”
Tony checks the park for anyone who might be inconvenienced by what’s about to happen, but the closest people are across the street, enjoying hot drinks from the cafe, stopping outside the thrift store to browse the one-dollar paperbacks, window shopping, congregating in little clumps to chat. “Well,
Tony chooses his next words carefully. “We’re not in Pleasant Hill any more.”
Tony follows him inside.
“No such thing as magic,” Stark says, casting a long look toward a bottle of whiskey sitting on a shelf among horseshoes and a metal helmet.
can change what I believe in,” Steve says, though he’s not sure he ever has. “We’re going to see this through.” It’s already easier to believe when they’re like this, standing close enough that their eyelashes touch. “We’ll figure it out.”
“Why would I lie?”
Reality’s been written and rewritten more than once recently, and in the quiet of Tony’s workshop—a recreation of a place where both he and Steve once belonged but no longer fit—Tony can feel the density of if, tough and heavy like overworked dough. First the mess with Kang, and most recently the Infinity Gems—both topics they aren’t quite speaking about.
Steve thought he was helping Bucky when he gave him his memories back. But maybe he’s never actually known what his closest friends need from him.
Still. When Tony had originally called him, Steve had expected something—well. Something different.
Steve jogs to the marina, then hugs the coast along the edges of the Presidio, Lincoln Park, Golden Gate Park, and the Outer Sunset. At the zoo he turns toward the financial district, and at the ferry building he heads back toward his hotel.
he thinks Steve is going to take advantage of this.
“Am I too late?”
“It’s a California King-sized bed,” Tony says proudly. The crimson bedspread matches the wallpaper perfectly.
“S’that right?” Stark asks, setting aside his tools and wiping his hands on his trousers. “Wasn’t broken when I was there to get my Arbuckle’s this mornin’.”
yet?”
“Do you enjoy salted herring, by chance?”
The adamantium cuffs are next, a set for each of Steve’s limbs. Then the collar, as if Tony’s point isn’t already made. He doesn’t need to bother with the rare metals, with Steve weak like this. Tony must like the reminder that Steve used to need them—that Steve
“Yeah, she saw Tony leave Dr. Pym’s lecture and came to find me, I guess.”
“He can wear the veil during the reveal if your relationship needs to stay a secret, but it’ll work better with someone you actually care about and have a rapport with,” Hardison explains.
“Still on my side for good?” Steve says.
Tony tosses his head back as laughter bursts out of him. “Wow,” he says, still half-hiccuping and snickering. “Thank you, I needed a laugh like that.” When his laughter subsides, he cocks his head, eyes slowly raking across Steve’s exposed skin. “To think I used to hold such a high opinion of you I never noticed how
math genius, engineering genius, physics—” Tony began listing.
He enters the code into the keypad and steps out into the empty hallway. His footsteps will be quiet this way. He’ll be careful. Whatever’s happening, he won’t end up in a fight. He’s going to learn what’s happening, and get back to Steve’s room before anyone knows he’s gone.
Tony shakes his head. “I don’t want to.”
The gatekeeper makes a wet, back-of-the-throat sort of growl. “I’ve heard of sumthin’, growin’ in its nook, swellin’ and risin’, pushin’ up its covering. Upon that boneless thing a cocky-minded young maid took a grip with her hands, an’ with her apron a lord’s daughter covered the tumescent thing.”
“What about him?”
“It didn’t come up,” Steve says, willing away the heat in his cheeks and immediately regretting his choice of words.
I think he was gonna say something about it but then we got attacked by not-robots and were separated
“Okay, okay,” Tony affirms. Now he has a layer of confetti over his first coat of glitter.
Hardison chuckles. “She’s out casing the villa right now, actually.”
dinner will be happening!!!
“He had another episode last night,” she says.
Tony had nearly shut his eyes, then, an impulse governed by the part of him that abided by the mores of polite society, but he couldn't have torn his gaze away, even if he'd wanted to, because there could only be one reason Steve was doing this, there couldn't be another, it had to be—and then Steve was taking that off, too—
Steve hasn’t seen the three strangers since the night Honton died. He doesn’t think for a minute that they’re gone, though.
“Tony,” Natasha said slowly, “Can you do something for me? Look at Steve and tell him what you had for breakfast.”
Steve laughs and shoves two fingers inside, making Tony yell and writhe. “Hold still,” Steve admonishes, scissoring his fingers, no longer taking his time.
“You want me to believe you care,” Tony says, face blank, voice perfectly neutral.
“Wait,” Steve says, then immediately scolds himself for interrupting. Lieutenant Gonzales gives him a friendly smile, urging him on. “‘One or both of us’?”
“Wouldn’t work with the media angle, and it’s better if the mark has children, anyway. I say a combo of the Peking Watch and the Proposal at the Seven Hills.”
, Steve’s voice says, but Steve’s mouth isn’t moving.
I have x-ray diffraction and fluorescence analyses. The chemical structure of the paint matches what would’ve been around at the turn of the 17th century. I’ve also got UV and infrared breakdown if you want to look at older layers. I’ll give you guys all the readings I have on it, of course.”
“Okay. Thank you.”
no clue on the library thing, then?
fine fine fine
We’ve met a friendly alien. He’s very knowledgeable about the library we’re in and the dimensions we’ve been traveling through.
The first thing Tony notices as he and Apple approach the massive wooden doors is that the intricate iron hinges are quite skilled work and he’d like to meet the smith that cast them. The second thing he notices is the tall, cloaked man standing in front of them.
“So you keep saying.”
but we have a presentation we have to give as a group
“I was at the garage all day,” Tony says, confused.
“Because a forgery won’t whisper in my ear every time I walk past it,” Wong replies sharply. “That is the Shiatra Book of the Damned, and anyone who looks at its pages will know its language and lose their soul to its will.”
More than once an unexpected breath in his ear or a sudden, cold touch shock Steve out of his daze, but the panic that swells in him is quick to roll over and let the stupor overtake him again. Each thrusting, gasping body in the room owes its beauty and strength and vivacity to Tony. They’re Tony’s as much as Steve is.
“They’re layin’ low.”
The rest of the invasion stutters by in flashes and skitters to a stop. An uncanny post-battle quiet settles over Manhattan. The Skrull threat is over.
“You just want me to bring you coffee in bed.”
“People hurtin’ other people 'cause they can. 'Cause they think it's fun. That it means they're powerful.”
those weren’t exactly robots
“We’re done talking about this,” Tony said to Steve, then groaned.
stolen! It’s exactly as ridiculous as it sounds, it’s amazing.”
“Is there a problem?”
Steve doesn’t have a shield. Not even a garbage can lid. He’s not braced for it. All he can do is take the blow. “That’s not what happened,” he says weakly.
He doesn’t expect Steve to give him a real answer. “So many things.” Steve chuckles. “First, I’m going to fix you. We’ll take care of the rest together.”
though we did meet a pretty big halloween snake
The thing is, shooting Iron Man shouldn’t do much of anything. A loud noise of a bullet hitting the armor, maybe, or a smudge of lead powder over a patch of plate. The armor stands up to fire from anti-aircraft weapons, anti-materiel rifles, repulsors, and superhuman energy blasts. Shots from a sniper and a pistol should be no more to Tony’s armor than falling leaves.
Steve smiles, broad and pleased, and how is Tony supposed to keep his distance when Steve looks at him like that?
The next day Steve says he does have to get back to work, but will be back to have lunch with Tony later. Tony plays the part Steve wants him to; he smiles, and says he’ll miss Steve but of course Steve has to go, he’s so lucky Steve has spent all this time with him, and really, Tony’s recovering, he needs to rest. And everything he says is true.
“You don’t have to, I can handle it, or if it’s really bad JARVIS can call Jan or Rhodey—”
Likewise, Tony—who, while completing PHDs in mathematics, engineering, and physics, incidentally also completed the requisite coursework for a masters in statistics—insisted that the timing of the sorceress lifting the spell and that of his kiss with Steve were pure coincidence, and that no conclusions could be drawn from this correlation.
“Fun,” Tony repeats, quirking an eyebrow. It’s the one with the dandelion plume stuck in it and Steve wants to lean over and make it fly off with his own breath and his own wish.
he didn't do anything really
“I want to hurt you,” Tony says.
it was the one in stark mansion actually
to be over it.
,” Tony begins, “I’d have to fly to China and find the magic herb that sends you into a deep, magical sleep.” Then he tackles Steve.
this?”
it.” Steve takes a long breath, as if to steady himself. It fails to diminish the ferocity of his stance or the hostility in his voice. “Who else has that code?”
He leaves without another word.
"I'm not sure," Tony says, more because of the way Steve is looking at him than because of the drugged haze of his mind. He can't make sense of the expression on Steve's face, though he should be able to.
Tony’s eyelashes flutter as the world reorients and he comes back to himself. He stretches, relishing the movement. His wounds are gone, his breath comes easier, his mind moves faster. Steve is watching him.
there are these wild thesauri we need to watch out for
“Can’t say I’ve had the pleasure.”
. But he isn’t. He’s telling Pepper how the manufacturing will work for the modular homes he’s designed. She thinks he’s calling from Malibu. Projections and past data have already been compiled and typed up, Steve knows, because they keep referring to page numbers and paragraphs and diagrams. They’re reviewing the proposed launch timeline on page 24 when Tony notices that Steve’s awake.
Tony knew this was coming. He just thought he had more time.
I've taken some liberties with how Tony's armor might work. Don't think about it too hard.
Natasha lowered her weapon.
This seems like commentary on Steve’s entire life.
you have not heard the last of this, mortal
“It’s gorgeous,” Tony says, and leans in to give her a brief hug.
and none of them were in the place where eyes should be
that badly?”
Yeah, I think so too.
“Right. Wow.” Tony laughed hollowly. “This is why it’s a great idea to try to talk about these things while we’re under a spell.”
He’s laid out his front porch with his second bottle when a white-haired man steps onto it in bare feet. Tony’s sure the old man is someone he knows, someone from town, maybe, who he’s walked past every day for years. He’s also sure he’s never met the man before.
“If he were sick he wouldn’t have been in Probability and Stochastic Processes this morning.” When Steve opens his mouth to say something, Natasha rolls her eyes and adds, “It’s across the hall from my Programming Abstractions class, I saw him go in. And,” she goes on, her tone growing sharper, “he wouldn’t be studying in here, he’d be letting Jan take care of him in Stark Tower.”
thanks but I think I’ll be okay without seeing it
It takes no time at all to reach the Roxxon silver mines from Doom Manor, even on foot, except Tony and Victor don’t quite make it all the way there before they catch sight of three figures standing in their path. One is dressed head to toe in green, another in black, and the third, out in front, wears nothing but white.
It’s like Tony never found him, like Steve died decades ago, alone in the ice, like Tony doesn’t even see it’s Steve he’s been fighting with. Tony’s not talking about him but some distant, infallible paragon. He’d think Steve such a child if he knew that for all these years, Steve thought he’d really meant something to Tony.
be involved in a conflict being handled by the Avengers, but who has inserted himself nonetheless, increasing the danger to himself and others.
He’s so sure nothing will happen, and when it does it’s so fast, that he hears the plates of armor collapsing and falling to the ground before he knows he’s seeing it. It’s not a loud sound, the metal hitting the floor with blunt thuds, but the unreality of it rings in his ears. And there Tony is, already on his feet, falling into a defensive hand-to-hand stance, his gold undersuit all that covers him.
Steve sinks onto his bed and lets a hand fall to stroke his cock. If Tony slid his right hand over Steve’s lips, slipped a finger into his mouth, then another, it might feel like this, he could wrap his lips around them, suck in his cheeks—
When he pulls away, mouth wet and kiss-bruised, he suggests they have lunch.
no but I just heard someone crying by the coffee cart so he can’t be too far off
“The medical team wants you two in proximity to each other while the spell is active,” Rhodes said.
“Maybe it’s a creature like that that got Mister Honton.”
Grants a burst of 65% health.
“The mission,” Spencer reminds them, not unlike a clucking mother hen. .
“I don’t hate you.”
“Then we both have work to do. Don’t call me unless you have something I can use.”
Cap knows he’s fighting for freedom against an oppressive law. His certainty and clarity fortify his power and strength.
anyway he showed us this part that said:
“Behind you!”
“I don’t know,” Nat says. “I’ll let you know if I hear anything, okay? Now, c’mon, let’s get back to work.”
“Is he alright? Where is he?”
“Oh yeah?” Steve asks, sounding more sour than he intends to. Tony’s baseline human without his armor, but now, without the serum, Steve’s… much less than that, even.
“I wouldn’t have,” Steve says, too loud for how close their faces are. “I almost did it. I wanted to hurt you.”
Steve looks back and sees the hellmouth is shut, the eyes above it falling closed as it sinks beneath the sand.
yes, ants would be great
“Dunno,” Steve says. “I think Tony’s sick or something.”
“But?” Tony prompts.
James and Natasha’s departure from the Forbidden Zone had led them into the frozen forests along the Ob River in Siberia. The trunks of the pine trees were dusted with snow like Christmas tea cakes rolled in confectioners sugar. The branches were caked with frozen snow and dangled icicles like the faceted festoons of a chandelier. It was beautiful.
“So, like, a chat?”
That’s not what Steve thought he'd hear. He swallows and wishes, not for the first time, that Stark would give up his bottles. Stark seems to be holding his breath.
“You don’t think it’s—didn’t you hate me yesterday?”
Tony takes an involuntary step back. His ankle hits the leg of a wheeled desk chair, sending it spinning out behind him.
Tony doesn’t move. He’s not sure his body can feel worse than it already does. Steve’s going to hurt him. Steve’s going to touch him. Screaming, crying, begging. Acquiescing. It doesn’t make a difference.
MOVING ON
“Animal, vegetable, mineral?” Tony teases.
“Welcome, Avengers,” she says. She sounds calm, friendly, not overly bright or gloating or surprised. She is, as far as Steve can tell, unarmed. “I’m sure you have a lot of questions.”
If Captain America is downed in this way, all Team Cap Escalation Tiles are destroyed, not dealing damage or generating AP.
Natasha nods. “Yes. James and I tracked down a defector and—” the discussion is soon taken over by logistics and intel. The AIM attack seems like a sure thing, at this point, they just have frustratingly little idea of what they’re after or when they might strike. Still, preparing a defense is a puzzle Steve can at least begin to solve, and he’ll take his victories where he can.
bad, you know.”
Snowfall doesn’t come with a soundtrack like rainfall, but even cocooned in Steve’s duvet, the curtains drawn, Tony can feel the town becoming enveloped in a blanket of snow.
Before Tony can reply, a man with an overloaded shopping cart plows by, jostling Steve’s shoulder as he does. Steve drops the shopping basket, grabs the man by the shoulders and shoves him against the glass door of the dairy section.
“It’s okay.”
Stark's expression sharpens. “Don’ need ‘im to make my own hellfire, neither.”
If you aren’t familiar with canon, here’s the rest of the ending. There are hints that Bruce has become the Hulk, and that a spider with some kind of gamma powers is lurking around town (no doubt heading for the Parker homestead). Deadpool and Punisher show up to avenge Steve (the newspaper said that the Sinister Six, who in this world are bank robbers, were responsible for his death). Governor Roxxon sends a guy implied to be Red Skull to take over for Fisk. Carol is voted mayor. Red Wolf, Natasha, and Luke enforce freedom and justice.
The intel from this morning is in the forefront of Steve’s thoughts, bringing with it the promise of an easy outcome. He shoves it aside. It can’t possibly be true. He’ll try it, and it won’t work, and it bears no further thought than that. Of greater urgency is how more than one trusted source came to report something so patently untrue and easily disproved—and so soon before this meeting with Tony.
“Cap!” the Skrull cries in Tony’s digitized voice, darting over and hovering in front of Steve, blocking him from the false Captain America with his body.
Steve can almost imagine staying, with this kind of resource and entertainment at his fingertips. But it wouldn’t be the same without Tony.
“Mission parameters accomplished,” Steve says firmly, trying to get them back on track.
Hi Tippy-Toe. Is Doreen around?
Two nights after the team had watched “West Side Story”—the night before the team finally observed the truth about the spell affecting Steve and Tony—James and Natasha went to the roof of the main compound building to drink vodka martinis and watch the sunset.
“How about you, Tony?” Steve asked.
Stark's breath smells like molten metal and a backyard distillery. “Heard the town sheriff don’t mind, though.” Steve replies.
“What’s
With great effort, Tony sits up, wondering if he can stand.
“Don’t worry, I ain’t here to talk about what you won’t print. Thought I’d ask about sumthin' you have, this time.”
The PH Diner—Tony’s sure it’s meant to stand for Pleasant Hill, but Tony always thinks of acids and bases—is halfway an Edward Hopper painting, half a puddle of motor oil reflecting a landscape of neon and fog. The booth seats are tomato-red vinyl and shiny enough to be used as rearview mirrors. The parking lot is always empty and damp with rain or melted snow, one streetlamp flickering in and out, the sound of a suspended street sign creaking in the wind overpowering the sizzle of the deep fryer. The town is gray through the big windows, far foggier than it should be this time of year—whatever time of year that is. The bright lights, gleaming vinyl tabletops, and laminated menus make the dull purple-gray outside all the more bleak.
Create tile if Cap takes more than 2095, 1575 from a member of Team Iron Man, or 1300 from Iron Man himself. Destroy all Escalation tiles if there are at least 4 Cap Escalation Tiles. Generates 1 Yellow AP for every 3 tiles destroyed.
Section 42 (Yellow)
“Sheriff,” he says weakly. “Would you believe this isn’t what it looks like?”
Pepper starts at the sound, and for a moment she frowns at him, stricken.
Tony didn’t glance up from the tablet he was reading. “Hmm?”
yes and yes
Hey Steve. A little birdie told me that you had quite the day!
The glass shatters—her snowglobe, the fishbowl around the town, the goddamn StarkTech forcefield—
Not exactly. Sort of. Enough.
Steve nods.
“No,” Tony cuts him off. “Let’s watch Star Trek. There’s this episode from season two I wanna show you. C’mon, I’ll have JARVIS start some popcorn.” He’s smiling now, grabbing Steve by the wrist and tugging him further into the penthouse.
right
A curse from the direction of Veteran’s Hall steals Steve’s attention; it’s Clive Straughan who’s airing his lungs, and from the sound of it, Daisy’s gone and stamped off one of her shoes again.
Steve eats his corned beef sandwich and glances at them in the mirror. The fella in white catches Steve’s eye in the reflection and winks.
“You know,” Tony muses, skimming his fingernails up and down Steve’s torso, “I would have done anything for you.”
Steve keeps utterly still, but Tony must see some expression in his eyes because his grin widens before he shoves Steve’s face back into the mattress.
“So I can give it to you, of course.”
Tony’s heart is entirely organic, now, beating under its own power, but his mind is digital. His thoughts are on/off, yes/no, positive/negative, hope/hopeless.
Instead, the meeting followed the planned agenda. After reviewing the events of the battle—again, neither Steve nor Tony mentioned their injuries—the topic turned to the contents of the Hydra files Steve and Natasha had leaked some months prior during the destruction of the Project Insight helicarriers.
“Nitro cold brew coffee, a protein bar, and a blueberry danish,” Friday replied.
death by drowning.
But sometimes—like a favorite handgun that was manufactured with just slight imperfections, such that its balance was unlike that of any other of its type and the weight threw off the aim of anyone else who tried to use it—being different than expected is exactly right.
“What was that about?” Sam asks.
“I dunno,” Steve says to his hands.
“Okay.” Tony swallows. Steve watches his throat work, the way the sunlight plays over his stubble. “It reduces my lung capacity a little, too, so when I
catch up with several hundred years of technology if he put his mind to it is absurd. Not Steve, though. No, he would be even more out of place than he was when he first came out of the ice.
my attempts to reach him have failed
“I meant it, you know. If you need me—”
Steve hums and settles under the covers beside him, an arm around Tony’s waist.
“Usually,” he says, petting Steve’s hair. “Are you going to fight me this time?”
“Oh, you precious thing!” Tony chuckles. “Is that it? Were you hoping to hear it some other time?”
“Steve?” the voice says again, and it’s a voice Steve knows.
Even when he lets himself imagine saying it, it’s nothing like this.
Of course. Of
Steve moves before Tony has a chance to hide the tears welling in his eyes. No time to explain, to stop himself from flinching. But Steve doesn’t pin him or grab him or hit him, just stands there, so close that, when his lungs inflate with air, the scale mail meets the surface of the undersuit.
“Sure, but if he had, your face would still at least be doing that forlorn basset hound thing.”
“Does that” —Tony tries for a bright, flirtatious grin, knows he’s missing the mark— “mean you want to come back to my place?”
it was just really weird
Urich writes him a list. It’s not a long one.
you’re an officer in the marines or something
right so we told him how we got here and what’s been happening and he went on this whole long thing about the knowledge = power part and how much sense it makes that books could generate spacetime distortions and he was talking REALLY fast but he did say “well, that makes sense. what’s a bookshop but a genteel black hole that’s learned to read”
Tony keeps driving into him, making satisfied little moans each time Steve tries to escape.
Tony, as if noticing Steve watching him, blinks himself awake. He smiles like a lightning flash, just as brief and just as bright, before pushing himself up. Steve realizes he doesn’t know how long he’s been staring, and pulls his gaze away. “Computer, how long until we dock at Frontier Outpost 12?”
"Wassat?"
He stops himself from saying more.
“You’re going to make it up to me,” Tony says. He doesn’t draw his face away; his lips graze Steve’s while he speaks. “You’re going to keep making it up to me.”
“Okay?”
Level 270: 13085
Tony walked into the dining room with his jaw tense and shoulders set, a blank but determined expression on his face. Ignoring Natasha, Sam, and Vision, who were also seated at the table, Tony approached Steve and asked, “Did you know?”
One day he walks all the way to 9th Avenue and buys a fresh Tartine sourdough loaf. He spends the rest of the day recovering at a picnic table under a eucalyptus tree, eating chunks of bread with unsalted butter and looking out over the ocean.
my bad winter. the point is he was gesturing a lot and going “ook ook” and then finally he climbed up a bookshelf like a tree and showed us this book
"What's the last thing you remember?" Steve asks.
“What’s your last riddle, then, Stark?”
he has a fancy metabolism
“Did it occur to you that he might
“You get started without us, Tony?” she asks, clearly aiming for light and pleased and landing closer to confused and disappointed.
“You're runnin’ it for free?”
Their feet crunch over frost-tipped grass. The fog is so thick that it obscures the outline of the gazebo barely twenty yards away. “If you’re a dragon,” Tony says, “then I guess I’ll have to put on my shining armor and defeat you.”
Well. Tony’s a liar.
“It’s not our anniversary,” Tony teases, an old argument that draws a fond smile onto Steve’s face.
“The demons seeking it wish to open a gateway to hell. They may have already done so.”
There’s a slow, brutal urgency in Steve’s kiss, in the way his teeth scrape Tony’s lip, re-opening the cut there. The hand on Tony’s neck contracts slightly, a hint of promised violence.
. Or it could.
pretttty sure we’re on the 6th floor rn
Steve took a moment to parse what it meant that these separate statements were, in Tony’s view, all lies. “It would have changed my opinion of you, Tony. And I like you.” His eyes went wide.
He’s nearly to the door. A voice he knows he should recognize says, “I'm glad you called everyone out, Rogers, so you can say goodbye.”
. “I will accept an apple in return for allowing you to pass me. For my guidance, I require further payment.”
Tony’s fought through much worse.
Vision, who was practicing his sarcasm and teasing, admonished, “Language.”
“You know exactly what I’m doing.”
, about sleek little songbirds, of wishes carried by darting tree swallows with notched tails and white bellies.
“Because if you’re wrong,” Tony stops talking. He can’t finish the sentence.
“It’s done!” Tony hollers back.
“Yeah,” Steve says, pushing himself into a sitting position. He stares down at his wrists. They look painfully thin. “That’s what I hate about it.”
Tony takes a sip from his flask. “I melted my guns down.” There’s a bucket of water by the back door, which he gives it a good kick. Water spills over the floor. “I promised myself I'd die before I picked up another gun.”
see Tony again—
It happened that she did so at the exact same time that Steve and Tony shared their first kiss.
—“I paid attention to what you said, and what you did, and it reminded me all of the reasons to put my faith in you,” Steve says. “You proved yourself a hundred times over.”
“So—”
“What about the man who
and winter bucky was mounting some kind of offensive on the pretzel cart
Winter cocks his head, a thoughtful expression on his face that might mean he’s writing song lyrics in his head, trying to remember what he had for breakfast, or about to talk about Hydra. “Well, I don’t know Tony as well as you do. By the time I’d met him, you two were still working out your campus war thing. He does seem like the kinda guy who’ll put someone else’s feelings above his own and not even notice he’s doing it. But he also strikes me as someone who’ll make a fuss about things he doesn’t like.” He shrugs. “You’ve known him for a long time. Which do you think it is?”
cool cool cool cool cool
It explains a lot. Tony can’t even comprehend how he’s betrayed Steve because there was nothing on his side to betray.
Tony inhales sharply but then his muscles go lax and he nestles into the crook of Steve’s shoulder, silent, and Steve’s asleep seconds later.
Steve quickly gets the upper hand, of course, and they end up laughing, rolling and wrestling over the grass. The dirt is frozen solid, so it’s only leaves that stick to their wool coats and knitted scarves. Tony manages to push himself halfway up, and is ready to spring at Steve again when Steve straddles him and pins him to the ground.
The ship is—well, it’s something, all right.
Wong frowns and surveys Tony from toe to tail, no doubt taking in his combed hair and neatly tied cravat. Finally he nods and leads Tony toward his home, a proper wooden house on the main stretch of road. He offers tea once they’re inside, and Tony accepts so he’ll have something to do with his hands.

“But what you just said, that’s what you meant to say?” Sam asked.

Sometime after Steve has completely lost track of which wall was the floor when they first came in, Tony has caught him three times, Steve has caught Tony twice, and now Tony says, “One more?” So they move to opposite walls, count to three, and then push off into the air again.
“I’m the last person who should be running Registration,” Steve insists. “It’s absurd.”
And he’s not exactly wrong, either.
love with you.”
Natasha smirked and held out two mugs of coffee. “Anyone in particular got your eye?”
“This doesn’t solve anything,” Tony says.
,” Winter breathes.
in another time too I think
Tony pulls out before he finishes and spills over Steve’s crease. He replaces the plug with the same lack of care as before and sets to rearranging Steve to his liking. He undoes the cuffs pinning Steve’s ankles to the bed and locks them together instead, then his wrists behind his back, and tugs Steve up until he sits on his knees.
