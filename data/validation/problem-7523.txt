The house is huge, three stories of brightly-lit windows and fancy brickwork and climbing vines.  The lawn’s covered in cars, and there’s a band playing somewhere; by the buzz in the air, Steve would guess that a fair number of people have been enjoying the libations for some time already.
“Over my dead body,” Tony says.  “If she tries to be a superhero, you know who her first bad guy is going to be?  Me.  Boys I won’t worry about so much, but suits of armor, that’ll get her grounded.”
“We’re getting word of some kind of robotic militia in Sokovia,” Bruce says.  He sounds apologetic.  “Wanda’s already there, she says it’s getting ugly.  You don’t have to come, we can probably - but I thought, with Thor back in space, we’d ask if - ”
"Yeah, I do," Stark says.  He advances on Steve in the dim hallway.  "Romanov might not think you're here to cause trouble, but I don't think I trust you, Rogers."
Tony makes it all the way to Brooklyn before he realizes he should have called ahead.
, if you did,” Tony said.  “Which I agree you probably wouldn’t.  Because you’re a prude.”
Tony snorts.  “Yeah, you could say that.”
“Sam would probably say talking to my own hallucinations won’t help me work through my lingering trauma.”
Steve takes a kick to the ribs and flops back against the bar.  "Miss Romanov," he says firmly, "you may want to remove yourself from the situation."
Tony's propped up on most of the bed's sundry pillows, his fingers in Steve's hair.  "What happened at the raid this morning?"
Steve leaned closer.  “What’s that supposed to mean?”
“I taste tested,” Natasha said.
"Can I get a scotch, neat?" Stark says loudly, sliding up to the bar on Banner's other side.  "Hi, there.  I'm Tony Stark, haven't I seen you here before?"
“What?”
“That’s neither here nor there.”
“God, what are the odds, you try to pull off a quiet mugging and Iron Man and Captain America show up,” Tony says, holding out his hand repulsor first.  “Is there no peace in New York for criminals these days?”
“It’s not an entirely different set of rules - there are some fabrics these days with tensile strength you wouldn’t believe.  You think Natasha’ll be angry if I guess her dress size?”
Three weeks before Christmas, Tony said, apropos of nothing, “I think it’s time we get a Christmas tree.”
He’d fought it for so long.  He’d tried to bargain with the universe, tried to change it, but when it came down to it he knew.  He
“Not many places a fella like me can sit at a gin joint without being bothered.”
“I think so,” Steve said.  “Tony, listen.  I had a terrible time earlier tonight.”
Bruce snorted.  Steve shoved his fist against his mouth and giggled.  Thor threw his head back and let out a booming laugh.
“You can do this for as long as you want to,” Tony said.  “You can do anything.  You’ve punched Hitler over 200 times.  But you don’t
This was a problem.
Steve didn’t think that Sam would have anything good to say about fighting off PTSD-induced hallucinations by
“Real nice, Tony.”
“I’m happy to weigh in on that, if you need assistance.”  Tony fluffed up his pillow in what he hoped was a very nonchalant manner.  “You back to normal?”
“To new customers,” Odison rumbles.
It’s more than Tony deserves, but Tony’s
“And speaking of details, when you chose to resurrect the dead - ”
“To getting a fucking bathroom in this place!” Barton yells, and with a laugh, they all clink their glasses.
“Oh yeah?  Like what?”
“You love it.”
fantasy.
Tony blinks.  “I am now.”
“Next time I’m dropping you off at Fury’s place and not looking back,” Tony said.
Steve snorts.  “Gotta look on the bright side.”
“We don’t fight, kiddo,” Tony says, holding his arms open.  She runs into them and buries her face in his chest, right where the arc reactor used to be.  “We never fight.”
his blowtorch, and burst into the living room so loudly that Bruce dropped his Xbox controller.
“Well, that cuts a few states out,” Bruce said.
“What was I doing?”
“She asked me if the Soviets launched their satellite so they could bomb us from space.”
“Where are we going?” Steve asks as he catches up with Pierce.
“Oh, I am
“Okay,” Steve said, and grinned.
“Sure.  Well, he drives, most of the time, but I look after the cars.”
“Shit,” Tony says.  “Shit shit shit.”
“We’ve literally been talking about it for like five minutes!”
“Rogers.”
“You mean, suggest I’m on the take?” Rogers says.
“Hey, come on, we’ve done World’s First Something plenty of times before, right, gang?” Scott said.  “First superhero team, first time travelers, a bunch of you went to space in a ship piloted by a raccoon, I feel like that had to be
The elevator doors slide open silently, and when Nicola turns toward them she stops, startled.  “Oh.  Hel-
“It does sound like they do the kind of work we’ve been wanting to do,” Steve admits.
“Think you might be the expert this time, pal,” Bucky said, just casually enough that Tony froze.  “Steve, we playing baseball or badminton?  Gimme a real pitch, will ya?”
“Something like that.”
And that means that just when Tony thought he was laying the bait, he was actually walking right into the trap.  God, how could he have been so stupid?
The worst part of it, though, is that like a teenager hanging around at home on a Friday night, he
“Maybe,” Stark says.  “Maybe not just me.”
"No, I don't," Tony says.  "I mean there's this meeting, but I don't have to - I just meant, if you have to be somewhere - "
“What’s wrong?” Steve said.  “Is it an emergency?  What do you need me to do?”
“Well that got dark,” Clint said.  “All right, Tony, you can’t wiggle out of this one.  Put the yams down and spill.”
There’s an awkward silence.  “Okay,” Tony says.  “That’s fine.  I just - so you’re not staying, after dinner?”
Steve stares at Stark.  "A millionaire like you doesn't have anything better to do than dig up the entire background of some guy you just met?"
“You said the other night you wouldn’t help me get in,” Rogers says.
Bruce tilts his head.  “That doesn’t seem like a
“Tony, you’d do that
And against Steve’s better judgment, he replied, “Night, Tony.”
“We had the stones, we could have done
“So you’d prefer we just skip straight to that part?” Steve says.
“Your words, not mine,” Tony said.  “So if you don’t like cooking, why’d you spend all day perfecting your Ina Garten impression?”
“That,” Steve said, dazed, “is the filthiest thing I’ve ever seen in my life.”
Tony tries to set a good example, he
“Or,” Tony says, sliding his hands down to Steve’s ass, “you should get naked.”
Stark turns to him with a faint smile.  “I like that,” he says, and then, to Steve’s utter shock, he leans in and kisses Steve.  His lips taste of whiskey.  “I like that a lot, actually.”
“Like he didn’t fight back?” Sam says.  “Of course he didn’t.  They were civilians.”

Steve stifles a yawn.  “It’s no bother, Miss Hill,” he says, rifling through the stacks of paper on his desk.  “I’ve got them for you right here.”
than crazy, to close your eyes and lean forward and try to kiss a hallucination, but Steve had been crazy for a long time by now, so -
“Eh, jury’s out,” Tony said.  “You took a hell of a risk coming here.”
“Very, but not in the way you’re thinking.”
“I feel like my interest was
“Pretty sure I can’t stop you,” Steve said.
“Here they come,” Rogers says, and Natasha cranes her neck to see Clint dragging Banner out of the building.  Somebody shoots at them from the top floor, and Clint doesn’t miss a step, just shoves Banner into the back seat and yanks the door shut behind them.  Banner’s trembling as bullets slap against the pavement, and Natasha can tell it’s not with fear.
funny, Tony told himself firmly.  The other kids all seemed to be telling themselves the same thing, with mixed success if the choked giggles filling the room were any sign.
Tony looked up blearily.  “Hey.  What’s the deal?”
came his own voice through the speakers, in a blatant contradiction of his previous claim.
“And how did we end up talking about sex, exactly?”
“That’s my seat,” Natasha said, and Clint hopped up like he’d been burned.
“You were nice to me about it.”
“I can’t drop the class, I need it for my major,” Peter says.  “What’s going on?”
“Sounds about right,” Clint said agreeably.
“ - and Cap found out, and I think he was upset, but now he’s not anymore, and honestly, Bruce, it’s complicated.”
“Brooklyn,” Friday says, “but it was taken 45 minutes ago, the story just broke, it’s all over now, boss - ”
“Long story,” Tony says.  “Really long, actually.  Maybe another time?”
"Guess so," Stark says.  He holds out a hand.  "You ever need anything, you know where to find me.  It's the big ugly one a few blocks away."
“Sounds like you’ve really got your ducks in a row, Stark,” Clint says.
“What options?” Steve snapped.  “I don’t have options.”
“Really?  Because I’m surprised.  I’m extremely surprised, actually.”
“It’s the toothbrush!” Tony yelled.  “You left a toothbrush in the bathroom.  My bathroom.”
They climbed into the quantum ship, and Steve pulled the hatch shut and turned to the controls to send the signal up to the others.
“No, Steve, you
“I mean like the bottom of the Hudson.”
Friday projects the feed from the living room.  Steve and Morgan are in the living room with a giant pad of paper spread out on the coffee table; off to the side, there are a matched set of empty bowls with the dregs of milk and a few soggy Fruit Loops.
“But the point is that I
“Yes?” they both said, and then grinned when Steve turned tomato-red.
“Pep.”
mind?”
"Where are they?" Steve says quietly.
He crumples the note up angrily.  One more visit, and that’ll be that.
From within the clockwork man, Tony says, “My final offer.”
“Wow,” Clint stage-whispered.  “Taunting us for being children.  Real mature.”
Steve marches behind the bar and straight into the storeroom.  It’s small and dusty and mostly empty - Natasha doesn’t keep a lot of inventory on hand, for obvious reasons - and Steve’s all ready to give Tony a piece of his mind when Tony grabs him by the front of his jacket, shoves him up against the wall, and kisses him.
“Affirmative, sir.  Expected interception in eleven seconds.”
“No,” Barnes says.  “I mean, kind of, but - ”
.  I’ll take the first shift.”
“His boss had him beat to a pulp.  I wouldn’t exactly call it the first sign of trouble.”
The elevator doors slide open silently, and the penthouse is bathed in bright morning light.  “Hi Daddy,” Morgan calls out.
, god, Tony’ll never get over that) and steps onto the platform.  “We can always do it another day.  Another year, even.  The past will keep.”
“And what, you think
“So, what’s next?” Tony asks quietly later, when Steve’s head is on his chest and their legs are tangled together under the too-starchy sheet of the motel bed.  He says it so casually that a few months ago Steve wouldn’t have heard the request in it, careful and quiet.
good.”
of us.”
“What’s going on?” Clint said from the couch, where he and Bruce were playing what appeared to be GTA.
“After six bottles of wine just at dinner?  It might kill you guys,” Steve said.
Strange sighs.  “You say you feel like there’s a man alive in the world who shouldn’t be.  But should or shouldn’t - that’s beside the point.  Because there’s another man, a different man, who decided that man
“We’re good,” Coulson said.  “We leaked a report that everybody came out of the fight pretty banged up so nobody will be suspicious if they just stay home for a few days.  Keep them out of sight and alive, and we’ll sort it out soon.”
“Call him,” Tony says, and presses the phone to his ear.  “Come on, Wilson, pick up the fucking - ”
There were several
“Because my drones are currently putting on a very interesting show for all of Atlantic City.  It’s a show that lets you be the hero.  Isn’t that what you want more than anything, Tony?  To be a
“Okay, this is getting real dark real fast,” Tony interrupted, and Steve slumped down into his seat.  “Does anybody have any ideas?”
“Glad to hear it,” Steve said.
“Was I touching you?”
None of the kids (oh,
“Oh,,” Tony says.  “Sure.  Of course.  Tons.”
“Well, once they invent no-fault divorce, we’ll see.”
It wasn’t like the other times they’d traveled through the quantum realm.  Those had been fast - a flash of light and color and nothingness, and then feet firmly on the ground in a new place and time entirely.
"No, not at all," he says, glancing up at her and then away quickly, like he's afraid she'll catch him staring.  The poor thing; she already has.  "I was just, uh.  The shower."
Steve glances over his shoulder; as he’d suspected, there’s another automobile right behind them.  “I was under the impression that our mission here at the bureau was to protect the people of the United States.”
?” Stark says.  “How was your chat with our friend Dr. Banner?”
Steve shrugs.  “I think he figured it out by the way I was, you know - ”
Steve blinks into the light.  The room is mostly empty but for sun-faded wallpaper, a toy chest, and a few hunks of metal scattered around.  Through the open french doors that lead onto a moonlit balcony, Steve can hear the band playing and the rabble of the increasingly drunk.  “It’s… a nursery?” he says blankly.
“Oh, I do,” Steve says.  “Vividly.”
“Because this is about more than one man, no matter what kind of man he is,” Pierce says, his eyes ice cold.  “We have a very important mission here, and every single one of us is just a cog in the machine.  If you’re not interested in the case we’ve assigned you, there are always other options.  I hear they’re looking for agents at the Kansas City field office.”
- ” Clint started, then cut himself off before Natasha could reach his solar plexus.
“Condemned before you bribed them,” Odinson chimes in.
They set up in the Tower instead, turn all the lights back on and dust off the old equipment.  Most of it has been empty save for a few floors that housed the energy projects and the Maria Stark Foundation, and opening it up again feels like acknowledging that things are different all over again.
Tony narrowed his eyes.  “You’re his best friend.  Shouldn’t you know?”
Steve smirked.  “What if it’s me?”
Sam stands up straight, and Tony wishes, just a little bit, that he was wearing the suit.
“Clearly you have access to some power the rest of us can only dream of,” Beck says.  “Clearly, you could have set everything right - you could have taken everybody back to day one, before Thanos, before any of it.  But you didn’t.”
“Wait,” Steve says, grabbing Tony’s shoulders and pushing him away.  “Just - wait.  This’ll never work.”
“Something R-rated?” Clint said.
“I’m aware,” Pierce says, “that you got some special treatment during the war due to what you signed yourself up for, Rogers, but you should know by now that special treatment doesn’t exist here at the bureau.”
“I noticed,” Steve says, and gasps as Stark pinches his nipple through his shirt.  “You haven’t exactly been -
“No promises,” Tony said, and swallowed a groan as Steve pressed his mouth to Tony’s dick through his underwear.  “You done this before?”
“What if they’re not here?” Steve said as they started on the third floor.
“You got some in my glass,” Bruce said, frowning.
“Taking care of the last man standing,” Natasha says.
“Nope.”
"Booming," Miss Romanov says dryly.  "Can Thor get you another?  Not on the house, for the record."
“Oh, yeah!” Peter says enthusiastically, and Tony loves Peter to bits but sometimes he really wonders how this kid hasn’t gotten killed yet, that radioactive spider must have been
He wasn’t actually going to puke, he determined fairly quickly, but it had been a decent way to excuse himself because nobody liked to hang out with somebody who was about to throw up, not even -
“I mean
“That’s the spirit,” Stark says.  “So I’ll see you at the Black Widow tomorrow?”
“We’re not kids,” Steve interrupted, an assertion belied by the fact that his voice hadn’t dropped yet.

“I can’t tell how windswept you meant to look,” Strange says.  “Tea?”
- and say, “So, I get that New York can be a little

“Surprise,” Tony said.
A man with less finely-honed reflexes would have dropped the bottle of milk; as it stood, even Steve bobbled it as he spun around.  “So, you’re real.”
Steve slammed the freezer shut.  “You know, for a hallucination, you can be pretty annoying.”
“Sure,” Steve says.  “Yeah, I’d like that.”
“In exchange for a little discretion from the federal government,” Pierce says.  “But files get declassified all the time.  They also get destroyed.  Just thought you might have a preference for which way it goes.”
“I imagine that wasn’t much fun either.”
"I came off the project three years ago," Banner says.  "There was an... incident.  But back then they operated out of Washington Heights.  The things they're doing - "
“I’m not interested in transferring,” Steve says.  “I’m very happy with my case, sir, I just - ”
“Yeah,” Tony said.  “And what’ll happen if it does.”

“Excuse me, boys,” Natasha said, removing her dripping sunglasses and stepping toward the edge of the pool.  “I have a drowning to facilitate.”
“A solution?” Steve said, puzzled.
Tony blinks at him.  “Nothing’s going on.”
“No, hey,” Steve said, and now
“Plans?” Steve says.
“You know what I’d do right now?  I’d pull every blanket off this bed and just - just
“JP Morgan, actually,” Stark says, climbing up the stairs.  “You should have
“So how do you afford this place?” Tony said.  “Wineries are notoriously unprofitable, and I know whatever SHIELD was paying you before it went belly up couldn’t have covered it.”
“But surely there’s still
So Steve
you turned down a bribe."
“I didn’t realize we
“I’m appalled,” Tony says.
“Yeah, I think I can probably accommodate that,” Tony said.  He pulled Steve up onto the bed and went about relieving them of all the rest of the clothes that hadn’t yet been discarded, ran his hands up Steve’s ribs and his pecs and his shoulders, looked at all the parts of Steve that he’d stared at many times before but always tried to pretend he wasn’t.  He pushed Steve down on the bed and kissed him, wet and sloppy, and then licked a path down to Steve’s chest, swirled his tongue around first one nipple and then the other.
The reporter’s eyes widen, and then everyone’s yelling again, but Tony just rolls up his window and drives into his subterranean garage with a huge, shit-eating grin on his face.
Tony taps his fingers on the table.  “When - you were gone, you mean?”
Tony raps his fingers on the wheel of the Audi and wonders if he should have parked the car and gone to Steve’s front door instead of texting him.  Would that have been better?  But ugh, then Barnes might have been there, and dealing with himself and Steve and this whole
“I’ll talk to you tomorrow?” Tony says.  “Or, you know.  Whenever.”
“I know, but I think it’s just hitting me,” Bruce says.
“Never paid a bribe to the mob,” Clint corrects, coming around the bar to drop a tray full of empty glasses into the sink.  “We bribe police officers regularly.”
“Mostly I’m just bummed I can’t post any of these videos on Instagram,” Peter says.  “The one of Bruce giving Ned a piggyback ride is pretty incredible.”
Steve’s jaw hardens; they all know what’s coming.  “How so?”
And as it turned out, having a roommate who liked to cook had major benefits.  There was always something in the fridge to eat, and it was actually kind of nice when everybody sat down to dinner together.  Plus, Tony had once come home to find Clint making pasta by hand from, like, flour and water and time, which was fascinating, because Tony, who was Italian, genuinely hadn’t known that pasta came in “fresh”.
“Thanks for a great night,” Steve said, shutting the bedroom door behind them.
“You don’t,” Steve says.  “But if I am, you never know how that could work out for you personally, Mr. Vanko.”
“This is why I tried to leave you in Budapest,” Natasha said.
“Send over everything you’ve got,” Steve says.  “Any other items of business?”
“What are we looking for?” Steve says.
Steve gripped himself more tightly.
Steve hears it before he sees it: a blast louder than a bullet, louder even than the smoke grenade, and before he can move there’s a hole in Pierce’s chest the size of a fist and he’s falling, limp as a rag doll, the tommy gun clattering to the floor.
Steve winced as the kitchen light flipped on.  “Did I wake you?”
“You don’t know how your best friend’s criminal past is relevant?” Jameson says skeptically.  “Here’s a question, Captain: did you know that there is legislation being introduced to have James Barnes - who if I’m remembering correctly you fought to have posthumously pardoned for the crimes he committed while working as an assassin for HYDRA - brought to trial?”
“Okay, none of that,” Tony said.  “We’re off the clock.  We’re sitting by the pool.  We’re all aware of the massive mess waiting for us, but right now we’re in hiding, so can you lay off me for like, five minutes?”
Steve’s jaw twitches.  “We’re a team.”
“That was her dream ten years ago,” Steve said.  “Now… I don’t know if I know her well enough to know what she dreams about.”
? he hears through the driver’s side window as he drives them away from the tower, back to the house in Pennsylvania.
"He's elephant ears?" Miss Romanov says to Stark.
Tony steps out of the armor in the garage and dawdles, notes the repairs he’ll have to do, tinkers with the chest plate for a while.  Eventually exhaustion wins out and he walks in through the back door.  Morgan’s listening to music in the living room, and he pauses on the steps for a minute, listens as she sings all the wrong words.  He smells coffee from the kitchen and considers it, but crawls into bed instead, Morgand’s clear voice carrying from the floor below.
And Tony wants to argue, but Steve wraps an arm around Tony’s waist and pulls him close and Tony decides he doesn’t really mind at all.
“Do you think when we grow up, like, our cells will still be the same?” Bruce said.  “Or will they be totally different grown up versions of the cells that we have
“Different situation,” Tony said.  “Based on what I can remember from Hank Pym’s records you need to be able to communicate with the person inside the quantum realm
“Man, your generation is just like,
“Seriously,” Tony said.  “I don’t even want you to do this.”
Without looking at him, Sitwell reaches out and opens up the door to the car.
“We didn’t think you weren’t,” Steve says, and Tony realizes everybody’s looking at him.  “Any thoughts on the situation on Xandar?”
“It’s been a couple of weeks.”
“Somebody told you,” Tony repeats flatly.  “Who?”
"You think you could ever make her
.  “Is that - really?”
Steve spun around.
Steve narrows his eyes.  “What do you - ”
, and Steve just smiles at him and finishes his drink, and eventually they give up on the footage and Steve says good night and goes back to his place in Brooklyn, which is exactly what Tony expected to happen and totally, completely, 100% fine.
Tony grabbed him by the elbow.  “Excuse me,” he said, pulling Steve through the crowd, “pardon me, yes, hi, season’s greetings, excuse me, Captain America has something he’d like to talk to Santa about, official Avengers business, if you’ll excuse us?”
“Where’s the fun in that?” Tony says, and kisses the top of his head, which is probably dumb but whatever, oxytocin.
.  I can see how that’d be a problem.”
“Uh, are you talking to me?” Peter says, and Tony hangs up on him; he’s about to do a
“Who reads papers anymore?”
Steve wondered, occasionally, how many more years it would be until CT scans were available.  Not that he could ever get one, but still.
“Ooh, you’re in trouble,” Peter teases.  Tony arches an eyebrow as the rest of the team filters out.  Is Steve actually about to
, and stays down.  Steve stumbles back toward the bar, watches as Odinson stands guard over one prone man, Stark keeps his smoking armband trained on another, and Romanov stands with her stiletto tip - pointier than Steve thinks they usually are - poised over the neck of a third.
When the shots stop, Steve jumps up and knocks out a third man waiting in the wings, then grabs a nearby chair and uses it to block a fourth coming down the stairs.  “Any chance you know of another way out of here?” he calls out to Stark.  “Oh criminy, put that thing
Happy tips his hat to Steve.  “I’ll be around if anybody needs a ride home.”
for this to mean something.”  Tony looks away, out at the blackness, and then back at Steve, and when he does his eyes are fiery and his jaw is set. “But you know what?  After the last few weeks, I think I’m actually more scared that it doesn’t.  I’m more scared that you disappear at any moment and not even want to tell me why.”
“So,” Tony says between kisses, “as much as I would - mm - very much like to defile our conference room, don’t you think the Power Rangers out there will be wondering where we are?”
"Ma'am," Banner says.  His gaze drops to his feet, and Natasha would feel sorry for him if she hadn't seen him nearly kill a man with his bare hands the night before.  She wonders vaguely which half of him is an act.
If he was honest, it was probably a stupid risk to take, but if anyone saw him, it would be their word against his; it’s not like there were surveillance cameras everywhere.
"Good evening, gentlemen," Killian says with a smile as four goons fill in behind him.  "Funny seeing you here, Tony."
“But I mean,” Tony hazarded, “it’s not like we couldn’t
this conversation is
“You shouldn’t have said that.”
“Of course you don’t,” Tony said.  “I’m just a figment of your imagination.  What do I know?  Good luck with the double date, Cap.”
Banner shifts on his barstool.  "I don't know what you're implying, but - "
“Gross,” Tony said.
“You literally
“It’s just kissing,” Natasha said.  “I’m 16, not stupid.”
, onto his back.
“No, it’s not a murder winery,” Clint said, rolling his eyes.  “It’s a breaking and entering, grand larceny and, like, brief kidnapping winery.”
“Oh thank god,” Tony said.
“They’re angry, Tony,” she says.  “They’re angry and hurting and it’s already gotten ugly.  The best thing we can do is keep doing what we’re doing - the Foundation, and the jobs, and - ”
was something else.
“I love Peggy,” Steve said.  “And I - thought I’d belong here.”  He looked out the window, watched the first grey light of dawn trickle in from the east.  “But sometimes I think that maybe I don’t belong anywhere anymore.  How’s
,” Bucky says.
“Oh, no,” Steve says, gripped with mild horror; how many of Tony’s servants know he spent the night?  “No, I’ll take the subway.  It’s fine.”
“Not tonight,” Steve says.  “I want to, I just - I didn’t think about it, I guess.  Sorry.”
And as much as he doesn’t want to admit it, he wants Steve.  He wants to be able to tell Steve what he wants, and for Steve to listen to him and stay anyway.
.  It’s just dinner between two friends.  Two friends who maybe, sort of, if Tony is reading the signals right, have a thing for each other.  So, you know.  Casual.
“There’s no shame in something not working out.”
It’s not a question, really, so Tony doesn’t bother answering.
“That’s up to Miss Romanov, of course,” Tony says, sliding the glass across the bar to her.  “It’s her joint, after all.  You want to stay in the game?”
it can’t be that surprising that he’d find a way to shut down even Iron Man.
“I’ll take you to him right now,” the man says.
“There’s video on Twitter,” Friday says.  “I’m not sure of the source, but - ”
“Again,” Barton says, turning to him, “in America we don’t say
, perhaps - ”
“Of course not,” Peggy said.  She smiled, pressed a quick kiss to the corner of Steve’s mouth.  “Perhaps we’ll break it in tonight?  I’ve got to take a call.”
“Ugh.  No hangovers
.  Steve shakes his head.  It’s all well and good for some fellas, he supposes, the rich and the artists and the people who haven’t signed themselves up to work for the United States of America.  Tony can be reckless if he wants; Tony
“Not at the moment.”
“Clint,” Natasha said, shooting him a look that was probably meant to be subtle but which was, instead, extremely obvious.
“Cap!”

Rogers looks around at each of them and sighs, resigned.  “I’ve got a friend who works for them.  Or at least, he
“Well in that case, we need some champagne,” Tony said.
Steve leans in.  “It looks like something’s… missing.”
“Language!” Tony called after him as the other kids followed.  “End it, Agent.  Just do it.  One shot.  Put me out of my misery.”
“It’ll blow over by tomorrow,” Bruce says.  He claps Tony on the shoulder.  “Stay off Twitter tonight, yeah?”
in his eyes, kind of like when they were training and Tony knocked him down, and Cap popped right back up and said,
When Natasha whirls around, her bar is almost empty, except for - “Stark, what the hell are you doing?  Get out of here!”
"With that new cop."
He's about to hop in a cargo plane that'll get him most of the way back to New York when he gets a text from Tony.
“No,” Tony said.
“So this is nice, did you get a promotion?”
“Dinner,” Steve says flatly, like he’s suspicious of the very concept.
"I noticed," Steve says, thinking of her stiletto.
“Nope.”
“What’d he say?” Peter said.  “Who was he talking to?”
“You should talk to him,” Peter says.  “Just - think about it, okay?”
“Well, I think that’s it,” Steve says an hour later.  “Pizza’s up in the penthouse if you’re staying for dinner.  Tony, can you stay back for a minute?”
Bruce clapped a hand on Tony’s shoulder.  “I’d love to stay for moral support, but I absolutely do not want to.”
, it’s not -
"Why do you care if I'm sleeping?"
by the time he slides into his seat at the head of the table with Barnes on his heels.  Nebula, on holo from Knowhere, is describing some race of aliens who are claiming they’ve found a way to travel through time.  Their methods aren’t anything like the quantum machine’s, and Tony hasn’t heard of half the technology they’re talking about but if he’s understanding correctly (which he definitely is, he’s a genius) they’re full of shit and nothing to worry about.
“You’re kind of a wild card,” Tony said.  “Maybe next you’ll start crying over an entire box of pizza rolls.”
“And you’re happy to be the punching bag.”
Steve didn’t say anything.  He shifted, his waistband pulled tight around the swollen head of his cock.
you get to play at eye level with the stadium lights?" Wanda said.
, maybe you should design your phones to stay charged for more than a day, how’s that for an idea - ”
“What do you mean?”
There’s a clatter of chairs being stacked and glasses wiped out as the boys get ready to leave; Natasha watches Rogers beeline out before Stark can chase him, sees Banner head up the stairs toward his apartment.
“Unbelievable,” Steve muttered, and went back to his paperwork.
“Might be efficient during grape-stomping season,” Clint said thoughtfully, and pulled out a small, unusually-shaped, tightly corked elixir bottle.
“Interesting,” Tony said, trying to remember how to breathe as he slid his hand against the bulge in Steve’s pants.  “We’re going to revisit
Steve raises his eyebrows.  “I thought it was me doing Bruce a favor, but apparently I’m about to hear differently from you.”
circumstances, these circumstances being that we’re going to sleep together, wow, now
a different shape than it was before.  Everybody did good work.  Even Stark with his stupid exploding bracelet.”
Steve wakes up to a subsonic rumble, far away, over the Gulf. Warm air is rolling in through the open shutters, and when Steve steps out onto the tiny balconet he can smell ozone. The breeze ruffling through his hair is warm and humid and yellow with pollen. Steve watches the faraway storm while rooting around in his front jeans pocket, finding only half of what he’s looking for. He sticks the cigarette in his mouth and waits, smirking when he hears the snick of a lighter behind him.
But apparently he was wrong, because he doesn’t even hesitate before he says, “Sure.”
“Well,” Tony said.  “Anybody else thankful for anything?  No?  Great.  I’m gonna go throw up now.”
"Just watch Fox News," Tony suggests.  "They attack us personally all the time.  Twice before breakfast, if you're me."
, but this - this isn’t easy at all.
?) was at least better than his other options, were were: listening to Tony and Bruce agonize over their equations for the thousandth time, standing pointlessly off to the side while Thor and Carol argued about the likelihood that what they were planning would cause in a tear in the fabric of the universe, and watching Scott play Rock Band.
“Do you really think there’s something that’s going to scare me away after everything?
“Let’s start with the obvious,” Tony says.  “You think if somebody finds out you sleep with men, you’ll be out of the bureau.”
And the crazy thing about it was that, for a while, he did.
“Honestly?  I’m not sure yet,” Stark says, leaning against his work table.  “What are
“Okay, but,” Tony said, and gestured to Steve’s whole situation, “you filled out.”
This was a problem that could be solved with alcohol.
“That will have to be negotiated,” Tony said.  “At length.  The UN may need to get involved.”
“Unless it can win you more money.”
“Uh, no,” Coulson said.  “I just came to get your mission report.”
“Well, I guess it’s an accurate portrayal,” Tony said.  “Can I ask you something?”
“Funny, I was about to say the same thing,” said Nick, taking a sip of a glass of prosecco.
“It was definitely you,” Clint said.  “Which I thought at the time was a little weird, considering how much you like the sound of your own voice, but now it’s clear that what you really wanted was the clear the runway for your
She smiles indulgently. Clint's many proclivities are an open book to her. "How was I to know?" she says innocently, batting her eyelashes at him, and is not a bit surprised when he seizes a pillow and, ignoring her squeals, drives her off the bed in a blizzard of feathers. "Stop!! Stop!! I'll be good, I swear," she says, laughing.
“There is quite a lot of porn,” JARVIS said neutrally.
“Oh,” Steve says, “I - ”
Because Steve is a self-sacrificing glutton for punishment, when J. Jonah Jameson asks him for an interview, he takes it.  And because Tony is, for reasons he can’t explain and doesn’t care to try, apparently the newly self-appointed president of the Steve Rogers Cheerleading Committee, he offers to host it.
“The clothes in my closet,” Steve said.  “They’re not mine.”
“Somehow I don’t believe that.”
his subconscious was getting it right: Tony was smirking, leaning closer, his lips parting slightly, and -
Steve’s eyes hardened.  “That’s what I thought.  If you don’t mind, I’ll just get back to Brooklyn.  Good luck with getting all the others to grow up.”
Natasha cracks one eyelid open and sees Banner, not quite concealed by the shadow of the stairwell, frozen in place on his way back down--presumably to get his hat. She turns her head back to Thor, gripping him by the back of the neck and murmuring into his mouth. "Let him watch," she says.
“Thor lives in space!” Tony said, throwing his arms up in the air.
Steve’s out of his seat and out the door before he even finishes his sentence.
something about it in Wakanda instead of just standing around while everybody died.  You think you deserve to be here with the rest of us?  Just sitting around, living off Tony's money and doing nothing?  Because you
“I can see that,” Steve says.  He turns in Tony’s arms and meets the other man halfway, their lips pressing together a little more hesitantly in the light of day, maybe, but still firm and purposeful, and Steve shivers despite the warm morning.  “I should get going.”
“The band gets breaks, Mr. Stark.”
“It’s not about me, it’s about - where do
“That’s okay,” Steve says over his shoulder as he heads down the driveway.  “I could use the time to think.”
Steve doesn’t so much as blink.  “Got curious, sir.  Zemo’s smaller time than the other two, but he’s ambitious.  Thought there might be a roadmap to what he’ll be trying to - ”
“Okay, moving right along,” Tony said, yanking Steve into his bedroom and slamming the door behind him.  “So this is my bedroom, you’ve been here before but never under these
: there’s a private entrance to Stark Tower, sure, but anybody could see him driving into Tony Stark’s garage after midnight or leaving again in the morning and start to wonder.  It’s just not what they do.
“Since you asked so nicely,” Tony said, and pulled Steve toward him by the hair until his dick slid back into Steve’s mouth.  Steve took it in eagerly, already an expert after all of three minutes practice because he was just

“He’s a

“I’m still working on it,” Rogers says.  “And no offense intended, but it’s not the kind of thing where I can bring a bunch of tagalongs.”
“Never.”
“I swear to
"Seems reasonable," Steve says.
And then it rushes up to swallow you.
Steve looked disappointed.  “I kind of just wanted the rolls.”
It’s Rhodey, and then it’s the head of Legal, and then it’s Pepper, and then it’s the entire PR firm he keeps on 24-hour retainer for moments exactly like this, and then it’s Rhodey again.
“Like you said,” Stark says through gritted teeth.  “
“Okay,” he said.  “But you get
“And the Avengers haven’t been particularly forthcoming with the details.”
“Idiot,” Barton says, and Steve doesn’t want to give Tony the satisfaction but he can’t help it, he laughs anyway.

Tony raised an eyebrow.  “Excuse me?”
move ever, but he’s a little rusty, okay?
Strange looks at him for a while.  Just when Tony is about to give up and head for the door,  he says, “Are you sure you wouldn’t like some tea?”
“The day you left,” Tony says.  “It was a normal day, right?  Except you decided to leave.  Any interest in sharing with the class?”
“Six,” Clint said.
"Not my fault your pitcher doesn't have his head in the game," Natasha said, brushing dust from her thigh.
“Well, if you’ve met him, it’s pretty clear that he’s a genius, if not exactly a
"Take notice," Thor whispers into her mouth as Clint begins to edge her panties aside, "you have an observer."
Steve pushes a water bottle toward Tony.  “You can believe whatever you want.”
The insurrection in Sokovia isn’t particularly organized, but it’s still a decent fight; the armored soldiers are way overpowered, blowing up buildings left and right, and Tony wonders what kind of Justin Hammer-impersonating asshole is responsible this time.  By the time Cap and Wanda corner the leaders in an abandoned subway station, several city blocks are rubble.
“I have no idea,” Steve said.
“I think we can pretty conclusively say that’s not true,” Steve said.
“Was I, Cap?”
“And what?”
“I mean, I’m seeing Bruce on the couch and Natasha on the arm of the chair and
“Hi,” Tony said.  “What’s going on in here?”
“Knowing that creepy SHIELD agents were tailing them does
Happy, who hears stranger from Tony on a regular basis, just nods and gets in the Audi.  Admittedly, the air in Manhattan isn’t particularly fresh, but after days spent holed up in the workshop with only Fox and Friends for company, it feels good to be outside.
She smiles.
“I’m sure,” Steve said.
“Our future?” Banner says.
“No,” Steve says.  “I suppose we don’t.”

“No, you’re right, I don’t, but they don’t have to say it, because I know it.  I ruined trillions of people’s lives, and then I did it
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Tony said.
Steve slammed the door behind him so hard he heard the window pane crack.
The elemental shows up right on schedule.  The people milling around outside Borgata, waiting for Ubers and taking poorly-lit selfies, run screaming in every direction as the massive, terrifying fire creature stomps on a parked cab and drips molten lava everywhere.  And, just like Tony knew he would, the guy in the helmet and cape swoops out from behind the Golden Nugget and starts fighting back.  It’s all flashes of green light and electrical charges and impressive acrobatics for the crowds below.  It’s a show, and Tony has to admit it’s a pretty good one as he steps off the edge of the hotel, flies up to the elemental monster in stealth mode, and shoots a scatter-burst rocket at it.
“It’s eight in the morning.”
“You know, this might surprise you,” Steve says, leaning in close to Tony, “but I actually kind of like hanging out with you.”
“Okay,” Tony said as they began to devour the food as if they’d been starving in the desert for three months, “so here’s the thing.  I have literally zero experience with kids, and - ”
than talk to me, you’d rather - ”
,” Tony said.
“How is he?” Tony says.
“Look, my point is, none of us like the idea of these guys taking over even more of New York,” Stark says, ignoring everyone.  “And we made a pretty good team the other night against Killian’s men, right?”
, and you
“I don’t think this is what Cap had in mind when he said
“We’re not technically minors,” Steve said.
“We should get to bed,” Natasha said, standing up and looking down at Bruce meaningfully.  “And maybe you should get yourself to bed too, Stark.  Before Rogers does it for you.”
“You’re the one who dove right at -
“Who was it about, then?”
“You’re thinking about it,” Tony said.  His voice was light, like he was enjoying himself.  “You’re thinking about whatever I was doing to you in the dream.”
“Yeah, whatever, oh wise one.  You ever think about offering this as a paid service, maybe going for a Dr. Phil thing?”
“Why do they have a whole store just for apples?” Steve asked, squinting at a directory.
at keeping track of her, and just as he threw the ball she took off, and Tony had barely even caught the pitch and thrown it in Rhodey's direction before she slid into second.
Steve leaned back.  “The toothbrush.”
“Pizza sounds good,” Steve said.  “Somebody please talk to me about something boring because otherwise I’m going to start talking about how my first real kiss was with my cousin Betty.”
“So here’s a question,” Stark says, popping up from behind the bar.  “You sure you want this place, Aldrich?”
robot arm makes grabby hands at his armor.  “Spiderman, any guesses on vulnerabilities?”
“Macy’s!” Steve said triumphantly.  “I know that one!”
“Well, I’m slightly manic at the best of times,” Tony said.  “So what’d she show you?”
“And what happens if I’m misreading it?”
Tony gives him a rueful smile.  “Well.  I know we’re not allowed to say stuff like this, but would you be mad if I admitted I was worried about you?”
a quitter, Tony took off.
Clint mostly seemed to be looking for any videos of himself.  Eventually he switched to skateboarding videos, online poker games, and a bunch of hidden results that Tony had to assume was a
“Ah,” Tony says.  He takes a step back, straightens his jacket.  “Right.
“I’m confused, and also concerned,” Bruce says.
"So, what," Rhodes says, "you want us to attack you?"
"Guess all that genius only goes so far," Steve says.  "You still carrying around that noisemaker you brought out last night?  What kind of gun is that, anyway?"
For the first time, the man's easy smile slips.  "I got out of weapons in 1916," Stark says.  "Any more questions?"
The door behind them slams open again, and Thor tumbles through, Bruce hot on his heels.  “Natasha!” Bruce says, looking stricken.  “You have to - ”
“Mr. Stark?” Peter says.  “I don’t really know what’s going on, but - ”
,” Tony said.
“Come on, it’s New Year’s Eve,” Steve said.  “Even Thor’s wearing one.”
“Literally anything else,” Tony said.  “I mean, not
Natasha smiles up at him. "I think I can do that." As the song ends, she pulls him off the dance floor, leading him first to the gigantic crystal punch bowl, where she spoons out two glasses of liquid the pale pink of a peony. "Let's drink these somewhere less crowded," she says, and pulls him by the hand to the staircase. "What's wrong with the first floor?" Bruce asks when she passes it without even slowing down.
“Are we - what, yes, of course we’re okay, why would we not be okay?”
"Shh."
“You never should have brought it in the first place,” Rogers says.
“Good thing the police are on their way,” Steve says through the team’s comm line.  “I have them setting a cordon a block in every direction.  Think I can sneak up on this guy from behind?”
, after all - a slammed door.
The list flashes on the screen.
"That's exactly what I'm worried about," Banner sighs.  "But I'm here now, so.  Shoot."
“How do you see this going, Cap?” Tony interrupts.  “Me and you, I mean.”
“Oh my god, you like me,” Tony said, figuring it out because he was a
“Pretty much,” Steve says.  He’s sketching something big, a building surrounded by trees, and it hits Tony like a punch to the gut when he realizes it’s the base that Thanos destroyed.  When Steve looks up and sees Tony’s gaze, he quickly covers it with his elbow.  “Any plans today?”
“Off topic for Captain America to talk about why he insists on protecting a killer?  How can you even call yourself Captain America anymore?”  Jameson leans forward, and Tony is reminded of a lion going in for the kill.  “You may have used your influence to avoid accusations of treason in the past, but there are still people who are determined to make sure you answer for the crimes we know about, and the ones we don’t.  How would you respond to them?”
“I’m sorry,
“So for the record, I don’t care what you guys put into your bodies when you’re adults, the 90s are mostly a blur for me, I get it, but right now you’re kids and I’m responsible for you, so this?  This doesn’t happen again,” Tony said.

“She thinks I might be able to do some work for the SSR, in a few years,” Steve said.  “Nothing at HQ, but ops, maybe. Get a group of specialists young enough that they don’t remember my reels, wait until beards come into style, it might be an option.”
Steve cocks a hip against the bar.  “You expecting to find something tonight?”
“Well, it seems to have a plug of some sort,” Steve said, crawling out from behind the TV set.  “But I used to fly Quinjets and operate time machines, so I think I might be able to figure it out.”
“Thanks,” Miss Hill says gratefully, accepting the pile.  “Burning the midnight oil tonight?”

“Anybody get shot?” Stark says as the tires squeal.
. And you know why you did it?  Because you're selfish.  You're selfish, and you're a coward."
The shareholders go crazy; Tony’s glad Pepper isn’t the CEO anymore, because she’d have throttled him for it.  These days, she runs the Maria Stark Foundation with the same efficiency with which she operated Stark Industries, and they stop talking about work, mostly, because it keeps the fights to a minimum.
know my name."
“You know, some of us kinda like your face the way it is,” Tony says.  “We’d prefer it didn’t get trashed again by a bunch of assholes with inferiority complexes.”
"Not joking.”  Stark leans forward, his eyes mischievous.  "This is the kind of place you can get away with something like that, you know.  Miss Romanov's very... understanding."
Bruce nods, lumbers toward the door.
“Is there?” Rhodey asks.
It is, in the end, actually a relief to hear it said.  Well, almost said.  Tony releases a breath he’s been holding ever since Thanos faded to ash at his feet.  He thinks distantly that when he came here, he’d wanted nothing more than for Strange to tell him he was supposed to be dead, but now that he knows it for sure, he desperately wants to
Strange walks him back to the front door.  When his hand is on the handle, he pauses.  “Tony,” he says, “it doesn’t really mean anything, the fact that we’re not the first.  First doesn’t mean anything.  No universe is first; they all exist simultaneously, because and in spite of each other.  And every choice, every single action opens up new branches full of new possibilities.  Fate doesn’t tell us what to do.  Sometimes things happen, sometimes they don’t.  Today, you get to keep making choices.”  Strange smiles at him, one of the few genuine ones Tony’s ever seen on the man’s face, and it’s gone just as fast as it appeared.  “Try not to waste them?”
“Yeah, all those high society folks tend to drink a lot of expensive mob-smuggled liquor from what I hear - ”
“Not without you!” Bruce hisses, grabbing her elbow as Thor hits the light switch and the whole place goes dark.
Everyone looks at Barton expectantly.  “What?” he says finally, staring around blankly.  “I go where Nat goes.”
of experience, with all kinds of people, women, men, younger, older, supermodels and politicians, CEOs and Oscar winners, a
“Uh,” Steve says, “isn’t the party still - ”
“I don’t know what else we can do,” Steve says, finally.
“I didn’t intend for that to be repeated,” Steve says, smirking at Tony over a cup of coffee.
“Exactly,” Beck says.  “Look, Jonah, I think anybody who knows Tony Stark knows he’s a genius.  He’s one of the greatest minds of our age, and frankly he’s capable of things most of us can’t even imagine.  But… given that we can’t imagine all of it, I think it would be healthy for all of us if we spent a little more time questioning the things he tells us, the things he says we see with our own eyes.  Every time the world needs saving, the Avengers get a little more powerful, a little more untouchable.  But Jonah, the thing is, I don’t remember the world needing that much saving before Tony Stark decided he was the one who wanted to save it.”
He hovers at the top of the stairs for several increasingly awkward minutes and wonders how far it is to the nearest subway station.  A couple miles, he figures; he doesn’t mind the run, but he’d prefer not to scuff up his good shoes, not after he spent so long shining them -
“Sorry,” Tony said, but he didn’t sound it at all.  “Didn’t mean to catch you in the middle of the night.”
“Okay, what about the Kennedy assassination?”
"No flying," Clint said immediately.
Tony, whose mouth and brain had apparently shaken hands and went their separate ways a while ago, said, “You know when I said the thing about liking you, I think it’s possible people took that the wrong way.”
she asked me if I had any intention of moving back in, and I told her I didn’t know, and she said for someone who knew the whole future I had a hell of a hard time figuring out what I wanted.”  Steve pinched the bridge of his nose.  “And then
“Dude, I can’t believe you two made out!” Clint said, pointing at Natasha and Thor and then bursting into laughter.
“Damn it,” Stark says, “I’m still reloading,
“Not that I’m not super into this, but just for the record, I still think it’s probably a bad idea,” Tony says.
“I’m just being polite,” Tony says, but Steve’s smirk shows that he knows it’s a lie so Tony gives in.  “All right, all right, I missed this.  “New York, I mean.  Pennsylvania’s nice, but it’s not - ”
"In that case, welcome to the Black Widow," Romanov says, and with one last glance at Steve, floats away.

to be the last one to sit down, a sort of violent musical chairs that ended only when Natasha grabbed a plastic fork and aimed it at Clint’s crotch so pointedly that he held his hands up in the universal sign for “I give” and accepted his fate.
“Yeah, your office is bigger than last time I saw it,” Tony said, peering out the window.  “Great view of the parking lot.  What are you driving these days?”
“So, question,” Peter said.  “And I really mean this in the nicest way, but has anyone checked to make sure Captain America hasn’t lost his mind?”
“I deserve that,” Stark acknowledges.  “But I did get out of weapons, in the end.  And it turned out I had a lot of things to get out of.  Things I didn’t even know I was part of.”  He pulls out a rag and polishes the already-gleaming breastplate of the clockwork man.  “Took a couple years to get all my money out of the places it had ended up.  Some of it was involved in things your bosses probably have pretty extensive files on.”
Eight robot arms is a
“Just our best,” Tony says.  “Stay home tonight, Cap.”
“It was two minutes and twenty seconds,” Steve said, and then they looked at each other and burst out laughing, so really, it wasn’t all bad.
Tony took a swig of champagne and raised his eyebrows.  “You really think I’m gonna mess up my hair with one of those things?  Dream on, Capsicle.”
“Oh my god,” Tony said.  “Forget it, forget I said anything - ”
“No apology needed,” Tony said.  “Clint’s a dick.  He doesn’t mean it, though.”
And she was about to do it
how Tony ended up carrying a Hot Topic bag on the subway.
“But like,
“Huh,” Tony said.  “All right.  Well, in that case, I think I’m going to have to decline.”
Natasha yanks him down until he’s kneeling with the rest of them.  The footsteps have gone slow and quiet.  “They’re here.”
Steve remembers that; his superiors had been furious.  “So as soon as the war got ugly for you personally, you wanted out.  Color me impressed.”
There was only one thing to do: leave.  He grabbed his glass of wine and swiveled around and dropped in an elegant heap (if he did say so himself, which he did) onto the sofa next to Bruce.
And look, Tony liked a good old-fashioned teenager cagefight as much as the next guy and he didn’t think Clint would do anything to hurt the kid, but he had a feeling allowing a fistfight wasn’t exactly by-the-book parenting; in one motion, he grabbed Steve by the back of his shirt and hauled him away from Clint, mid-swing.
“Nothing’s going on, sir,” Steve said.
“Yeah,” Steve said.  “I guess I do.  Otherwise you wouldn’t be here.”
One of the funny things about not being able to get drunk, Steve reflects as the night goes on, is that it's almost like being camouflaged.  He can blend right into a crowd, down drink after drink, let people think he's just as zozzled as everybody else, while his eyes and ears stay sharp as ever.  It's not a cheap disguise, but he's pretty sure Odinson's not charging him full price, anyway.
“Let’s get at least a few on the table,” Steve said, using a pair of Iron Man-branded mitts to pull a ribeye out of the oven.  “Is there anybody else around?”
From the first floor, there’s a smattering of gunshots.  Steve takes another out man at the knees.  “Get out of here, Stark,” he grits out, holding firmly on the back of the goon’s neck; he writhes and scrabbles at Steve’s hands, but Steve holds him tight.  “Find Miss Romanov and
Steve sets his bottle down a little too firmly.  “Did you need something?”
at home, at work, on the train, walking through the breakfast cereal aisle - always worried if he wasn’t looking, he might miss something, even though Tony had never had an issue making his presence known before.  He glanced over his shoulder on the street, kept the TV off so he could hear every sound in his apartment, let the phone ring itself off the hook at the office.  When he slept - which he mostly didn’t - he left the light on and a note on top of the blankets:
"So what's important enough to make you want to come in here and risk all that?" Stark says.  "Or maybe it's
When Tony got to breakfast the next morning, the kids were arguing.
"So," Stark says after Romanov's disappeared into the back room of the Black Widow, Barton hot on her heels, "I noticed you still haven't left, even though everybody here knows you're the fuzz
“Oh-kay,” Steve said.  “So - ”
“I probably could have handled it better too.  You make me feel so - ”
"Grab ahold of the top shelf," he tells her, and Natasha obediently reaches for the edge of the shelf. Her cigarette drops a column of ash on her left breast, stinging her, and she jumps and whimpers but does not move. Rising quickly behind her, Clint brushes the ash away, and, in a gesture that makes her shiver, takes the cigarette from her lips. She hears him take a drag behind her, feels his exhale on her shoulders as she's wreathed in two rippling banners of smoke. His voice comes from behind her.
“Clint was saying that young Steve has - ” Thor started, but then Natasha’s little elbow darted out and nailed him, right in the ribs.  “Oh!  Good aim, milady.”
“I’m sorry, considering it was my shell launcher that saved all of your lives, you mean?” Tony says, sauntering out from the back room with Banner.  “Yeah, let me just pile on the apologies for the property damage, you have my deepest sympathies - by the way, Romanov, since we have to, you know, re-build the walls anyway back here, you want to put in a toilet?  Indoor plumbing’s the cat’s pajamas.”
Great.  Morgan probably dug up an old box of Thor’s Poptarts and will now demand them for breakfast regularly for the rest of her life.  Tony yawns and pads into the hall, wondering exactly how he’s going to explain to Pepper how he got their kid hooked on -
“Huh,” Tony says when the video ends.  “I’d be more compelled by this so-called video evidence if it wasn’t shot on what appears to be a Motorola Razr 3.”
- but in the end he just shoves his hands in his pockets and keeps walking.
Above her, there’s an explosion and a crash and the whole building shakes.  She throws the last of the documents into the bag and goes back into the hallway as dust and plaster rain down.
“You’re being mean,” Tony said.  “I’m trying to have a serious conversation and you’re
“Don’t tempt me,” Tony said, and leaned down and kissed Steve’s abused, bright-red lips.  “What do you want?”
“See you in a minute,” Tony says, and Steve’s gone.  “All right, return in five, four, three, two - ”
Hogan presses a button and then steps back out of the elevator.  “He’ll be on 41 waiting for you.”
“It isn’t, really,” Tony said.  “But the thing about the Infinity gauntlet is that it kind of changes the meaning of
“Can you bring some towels down to the girls by the pool?  Rogers is concerned for their virtue,” Stark says.
But he hears it now.  “I think I’d better get going in the morning,” he says, and the hand threading through his hair falters for a second and then resumes its steady rhythm.
“Go to hell, Romanov.”
“I’m always telling him he should go more often,” Shirley said.  “Maybe you two could go together one day!”
“So what, you want to take it all on yourself?  Maybe get yourself killed doing it, just for good measure?”
Steve blinked.  “You… want - ”
The house is set back from the street, hidden behind trees and shrubs, and as the car gets to the end of the driveway Steve whistles between his teeth.   “I know, right?” Happy says, shutting down the car.
“My… butt?” Clint said.
“Getting involved in all of it,” she says.  “Is it helping the guilt?”
“I don’t dislike you,” Steve says with a wry smile.
“Good, good,” Pierce says.  “Now, I have a question for you, and I need you to think very carefully before you answer me.  What do you know about Aldrich Killian?”
There was a loud
“Your eyes going bad, old man?  I’m over here,” Bucky called.  “Seriously, Stark, what’d you
“Agent Hill is the one who tipped us off to the events of last weekend,” Coulson said.  “She’s the reason we were able to be first on the scene and head off an investigation.  I have a few people on the inside at several federal agencies.”  He raises his eyebrows at Steve.  “And if you’re interested, I’d like to have one more.”
Stark shrugs.  “It’s both.  And neither.  Hey, do you want a drink?  None of the expensive stuff, though.  No offense, but I don’t want to waste it on you, considering you won’t feel it.”
Steve raises an eyebrow, clearly amused.  “Was that it?”
“Bruce, you know I’m going to find a way to do it, wouldn’t you prefer I at least do it with adult supervision?”
Steve’s eyes widened.
“Just dandy,” Barton says from where he’s perched on the bar, taking aim at a mobster’s kneecaps.  “For a minute there I thought we’d have to take you out too, Rogers.”
Clint snatched up two plates he’d just put down and started to juggle them.  “Does this look lucky to you?”
“And you don’t think you can fix us?” Steve said.
“I want you to pull it harder.”
“Right,” Tony said.  “So the only toothbrush you have at our place is the one in your bathroom?”
Across the table, Tony sat back and arched an eyebrow.  “You know, it doesn’t say anywhere on your Wikipedia page that you like to cook.”
Stark claps him on the back.  “Glad that’s settled!  Who else needs a drink?”
"A bad example for
“No, but you do,” Stark says.
.  Over the course of his life Tony’s wanted freedom, and safety, and guarantees, and validation, and love, and more, more, always
Bruce slams a hand down on the table, and it crumples under his fist.  His arm is throbbing, shot through with streaks of green, and when he looks up at Steve he's baring his teeth.
“I didn’t mean the things I said,” Tony says.  “When we were fighting, I didn’t - I mean I probably meant some of it at the time, but I was pissed and embarrassed and really afraid of what you were going to say, if I’m being honest, and none of that is an excuse at all, and you didn’t deserve to be on the receiving end of that.”
“Food court,” Clint said.
“Bruce is making a casserole,” Steve said.  “And Clint put Thor in charge of dessert.”
Pierce glances at him and smiles.  “We’re going on a raid, Agent.  Helping out the boys over in Prohibition unit.  Little place called the Black Widow.  Ever heard of it?”
There was a blessed thirty second silence while they all chewed.  And then -
, you guys are
,” Steve said.  “So... you want to live together?”
.  “Let me take you to dinner.  It’s my turn, right?”
Bruce wandered in eventually, so engrossed in thought that he didn’t seem to notice any of them, much less the rapidly-expanding spread that was starting to fill every available flat surface in the kitchen.  He was halfway to the fridge before he looked up.  “Oh,” he said, blinking his way into the present moment.  “Is someone cooking?”
?” Pierce spits.  “This is about
someone?”
Stark snorts.  "All right, Aldrich, we get the picture, you wanna take this little show of strength to somebody who cares?"
Don't look at him like that.  He's not crazy.
“Not really,” Bruce says.
out of the quantum realm…”
“Well, I wish you would stop,” Steve said.  “In fact, I wish you would leave me alone.”
“You may have heard that I’m not really one for partnership,” Natasha says.
"Really," Tony said, seriously.
to partake.”
“Definitely in the morning,” Steve agreed, and turned off the speakers.
Steve glanced back, still glaring stubbornly.  “With all due respect, I don’t think I am.  The doc says I might put on a few more inches, but I don’t think I’ve got a foot and a half to go, and that’s what I’d need to wear any of those clothes.”
“Am I gonna get a pitch over here or what?” Bucky drawled impatiently, but when Tony looked back at him he was smirking so Tony figured he couldn’t be
“You had no idea what you were walking into, did you.”
“Contact in three, two,” Friday says, and just fifty or so feet above the surface of the Lower Bay, Tony slams into Steve.
Steve set his fork down.  “Well, I guess I’d have to say I’m most thankful that New York is still here.”
“Clint’s the one who ate the last piece of Thor’s key lime pie,” Steve burst out.  “Sorry, Clint.”
“Not enough garlic,” she commented.
“You know,” Tony says, lacing his fingers through Steve’s, “I think I could get used to it.”
And then Tony thinks
“I think I’ll walk,” Tony says as the Quinjet hovers above them.
"You didn't seem particularly concerned about it last night."
“Agent Phil Coulson,” the man says.  “I know who all of you are.  It’s a pleasure.”
Tony closed his eyes.  He had fought terrorists, aliens, gods, and even his own inner demons.  This was totally doable.  “What do you guys know about disguises?”
Steve rolls his eyes and gets back in the clattering elevator.
“Do you want to talk about it?”
“You miss her.”
Tony snorted.  “You’re not the only one involved here, buddy.”
“For margaritas!” Tony called.
“Just give the kid a beer, Tony,” Steve says, pulling one out of the fridge and holding it out.
“You could have gotten
“Yeah, that works for me,” Tony said faintly.
"Oh my god, you came all the way to LA," Tony said, pinching the bridge of his nose.  "This is the worst booty call ever."
"Fuck," Tony says as Steve falls to his knees, and then, "sorry, why am I in New Jersey?"
Steve nods, pacified.  Beneath them, the jet hums.  Finally, he says, “You’ve never really wanted out, though.”
“Let’s just take the subway,” Natasha said.
“I believe so.”
.  “Sorry.  I shouldn’t be - I can take the toothbrush away.”
"More like been forced to shift, but sure," Banner says.
“I see that,” Steve said.  He busied himself in the fridge, which Tony was almost sure he was doing just to avoid looking at him, which honestly was fair.  Tony was gonna let him do that, and then, like an adult, he was going to gently, carefully edge around the topic of Them, and then hopefully it would all be resolved immediately and no one would ever have to speak about it again and Tony could crawl back into bed until Christmas.
Steve pauses in his perusal of the items on Stark’s work table, then keeps moving smoothly.  “Well, above all else, it’s not any of your business.”
Steve glanced at him, then looked back across the otherwise-empty platform.  “I don’t mind the rain.”
With a thunk and a crash and a metallic screech, a clockwork man walks into the room from behind the bar.
“You got any Glen Miller?” Steve suggested.
Not that he doesn’t trust the others, of course he trusts them, he just wants to be there.  It’s important, returning all the stones to their precise locations in time to snuff out any alternate timelines they may have created by snatching them away.  If something goes wrong - well, he’d be there, and he’d fix it.  Tony always fixes things.
“He’s probably busy,” Tony says.  “You know, with Captain America things.”
Tony’s head snaps up as he steps into the elevator.  “Cap’s here?”
want from him."
Steve pushes back from the table and heads to the bar.  Nobody notices - they’re too busy trying to convince Bruce he’d have made a good accountant in a past life - and Tony quickly stands up too, leaves the rest of them arguing workplace semantics and follows him.
"And what's even more galling," Steve says, hearing his voice rise, "is that you think you have the right to somebody like Natasha."
“I think we can agree that by all accounts Tony Stark is profiting from the misery and suffering of the American people,” Beck says.  “And we know that he’s managed to collect a group of people who are powerful, and often dangerous.  The world is a chaotic place, and the Avengers are fully funded by a man who is making money off that chaos.”
Bruce blinks, a little confused, and looks toward the observation room.  When he looks back at Steve, his eyes are a little lighter.  "It worked."
“Yeah, screaming kids and paparazzi, every single man’s dream Saturday morning.”
“Oh my god, you guys bought weed at the mall,” Tony said.  “You are truly living the suburban American teenage experience.”
“And clearly that went
“No, we can’t drop it,” Steve said angrily.  “I would have preferred to talk about it last night, but you turned around and
"You lost?" says a voice from the shadows, and Steve barely stops himself from jumping.
"Hey, you wanna close the door, asshole?  You're letting the cold in."  Tony pulls the door shut behind him and crowds up next to Steve as he lights a cigarette.
He gestures to a dusty armchair.  Tony sits down and wonders, distantly, how long its been since it was reupholstered.
“Good thing that’s not why I did it,” Steve says, and when he catches Tony’s gaze he holds it until Tony looks away.
Tony’s got everything queued up when Steve arrives, and he plays the whole scene through twice before Steve looks up at him, frowning, and says, “What am I looking for?”
It started in DC, a few months after Tony got back.  They're in their 31st month of Congress's emergency session now, but back then it was still pretty new, and everyone thought, or at least pretended, that they might be able to get back to normal one day.  Tony was being debriefed by the House Intelligence Committee, and Steve and Natasha and Bruce had gone with him, sat in the second row and listened while Tony described everything that happened on Titan.  Half the committee was enraptured, the other half skeptical.  Tony didn't seem to really care either way.
“Cheers to that,” Barton says.  “Any luck figuring out what kind of science mumbo jumbo we all almost got ourselves killed over?”
“Even though I was always such a dick to you?”
Several people, including Killian, scramble toward the exit, and Tony shoots off several rounds in their direction; a few others turn back to their opponents, but now that their numbers are smaller, the team - Steve’s team - can go on the offensive rather than just trying to stay alive, and before long they’re going down like flies, Natasha taking one with a knife to the shoulder and Barton shooting a gun right out of another’s hands.  Thor and Banner together take down one of the big men, and as he slumps to the floor Steve takes stock of the room, wondering how much firepower Tony can possibly have in that thing, where Barton is on bullets, how much time they have until -
Peter sighs but pops it out and hands it over, and Tony decides to give him a Maserati for his upcoming birthday.
count as an invasion.
Steve chokes on his drink.  The bar, already quiet, goes absolutely silent.  Steve can
Steve put his book down on his chest.  “Excuse me?”
“Oh,” Tony says.  “It’s nothing, really.”
“It stopped me for a minute,” Steve said when he came up for air.  “But then I had to start talking again.  I don’t feel like I can stop talking.”
“Yes you can,” Steve gasped.  “You’re just being an assole.”
“Maybe I just don’t want to get killed trying to do the impossible,” Steve says, and his voice echoes through the bar.  He looks around at each of them, taking in confusion, their anger, their disappointment, and steels himself, because he knows what he has to do.  “Think about what I said, all right?  It’s been nice knowing you all.  Best of luck out there.”
Tony shifts, crosses his legs.  “Yeah, but if you get into something sticky - ”
The rushing died away, and Steve turned to look at Tony, trudging along behind him with his hands in his pockets.
The muscle looks him up and down, and Steve looks at him right back.  "Welcome to the Black Widow," the man says finally, and steps back into the shadows.
“I mean with you,” Peter says.  “Are you ever going to talk to me about things?  Are you ever going to trust me?”
“To get Banner,” Natasha says.  “Get in the car.”
“I’m sure he’ll let you bring Pepper back for a visit when things settle down.”
“Should I be offended that you’re comparing my tastes to your six year old’s?”
“I cried when I found out the Dodgers moved to LA,” Steve said, dropping his head into his hands.
And then he followed Natasha without looking back.
Stark glances up.  “Was that the signal for...”
smart.  Ambitious.  Always calculating what’s next.  He doesn’t particularly want to play chess with Beck, but he has to admit he’s curious.  “And why would I re-think that, exactly?”
“They’ll probably assume I’m yelling at you.”
“Yeah, we’re done here,” Tony calls out, and everyone spins toward him.  “Cut the cameras and get out of my house.”
“Rogers!  In my office.”
“Spelunking,” Bruce said.  “In wine caves?”
“Can we not,” Tony started loudly.
He should probably save them all to the permanent drive, just in case.
“You shouldn’t have done that,” Steve says as the last cameraman skitters into the elevator.  “He’ll be coming for you next.”
Steve tries not to shift on his barstool.  "Oh.  It's all right.  Doesn't hurt too bad."
“I know,” Steve says.  “Friday filled us in.”
“It’s a yes or no question, it can’t be that complicated.”
“Track whoever took this video, and see if there are more,” Tony says.  “Where is he?”
“Maybe you just have a good imagination.”
as various Avengers took off their gloves and hurled them in Clint's direction.
Steve ignored him and pushed a piece of paper across the table.  “I have something for you.”
“No,” Steve said, popping off Tony’s cock, “
“I thought we said we weren’t doing big depressing speeches,” Bruce argued.
“How come I always have to be the guy who thinks about everything?”
“Forget it,” Steve said.
“Why are you trying to convince me not to help you?”
” Tony said.
“Must have forgot my trunks when I was packing for the fight,” Steve said.
“Could be.”
The suit’s nanotech has done strong work, and by the time Tony lands in the open hatch of the hovering Quinjet, he’s at about 70% capacity.  A fucking EMP; it’s so
“You’re right, you’re right,” Tony said, sliding into the elevator with Steve hot on his heels.  “Hey, pipsqueak, what did I say, don’t follow me.”
“Of course I care,” Steve said.  “I’d change all kinds of things.  I’d start with rooting HYDRA out of the SSR.  I’d tell Peggy to get our defenses up and pointed toward the stars, stop Loki in his tracks.  I’d get Bucky out of the Soviet Union and stop him from killing your parents - I’d change
