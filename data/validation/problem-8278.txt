“One moment,” the woman said.
He tried to focus his thoughts on the night before, drawing upon hazy memories that his body seemed to recall better than his mind. Steve ran his hands down the curve of his bottom to the tops of his thighs where he could feel the stripes of tender flesh where metal fingers had dug in and held him last night. He rubbed his own fingers over his skin there and imagined what it looked like, bluing skin where his Alpha had gripped him, keeping him in place while he took him. Steve felt his cock twitch in response to his thoughts. Good. He needed to be fully hard when Tony woke.
“Would you like to sit down?” Rogers asked, nodding his head towards the conference table.  Maybe this was the interview portion, Tony thought dully. Let’s see….he wanted to be a good Omega, please his Alpha and world peace.  Of course.
“MIT?  You have to be kid—“ Howard started.
“So I’ve heard,” Steve replied.  “I guess…I wanted to help people, but, yeah, you’re right, there are lots of ways of doing that, but…so many people were signing up and never coming home.  Good people, people who could’ve had…lives and families and done something with their lives. Then there was me, and I—I wanted to be useful.  Do something that mattered, but—that’s not—I mean, a lot of things matter,” Steve stammered.
Steve let out a heavy sigh, and grabbed Tony’s wrist, taking the sponge from his hand.  He shifted around in the tub so that Tony lay between his legs and started laving the sponge against Tony’s shoulders and arms.  “You didn’t do anything wrong last time, Tony.  I’ve told you a hundred times.  You had no way of knowing we would Bond.”
“Alphas are supposed to take care of their Omegas.  Keep them safe.  Make them happy,” Steve rasped out in a low, throaty voice, eyes dancing down to Tony’s mouth, then back up again.  “Give them what they want.”
“You are truly beyond measure, my beautiful one,” Tony whispered, voice ragged and tight with desire and what Steve would have said was hope, though he had no idea what to make of that.
“Oh God.  You’ve reached the Sharknado Plot Stage.  I’m texting him,” Rhodey said.
The King.
It was late afternoon by the time they got to the restaurant, and Tony had to admit he was actually hungry.   He hadn’t finished the late breakfast this morning, on account of deciding to go temporarily insane and channel his inner Michael Moore.
He should write down what he could remember, anyway.  At least then he’d have something to attest to the fact that he once ate toasted mushroom brioche with Tony Stark preserved for posterity.  He shook his head and smiled a bit at that.  Tony was…a hundred things popped into his head, but none of them seemed quite right.  Interesting.  Different.  Larger than life and trying to be smaller than he was, which was a strange combination.
.  You’re not dead yet, Goddammit.  What’s most critical? Tony frowned, ran a hand through his hair, and  looked at the panel in front of him, where a red light blinked ominously at him. “Is that the oxygen?”
“You okay?” Steve asked with an edge of concern tainting his voice.
“Low bar.  I feel that works in my favor,” Steve replied, earning a huff of a laugh and slight eyeroll from Stark.
“It wasn’t your fault, Tony,” Steve told him for the hundredth time, the words ringing just as hollow in Tony’s ears as they had the first time.
“Simple, huh?” Steve asked, sitting down on one of the damask-draped chairs that had been set up along with their meal.
Steve must have fallen asleep.  He didn’t remember drifting off, but he heard the sound of voices outside the chamber door, and woke to a gash of light, followed by the heavy thump of the door closing.  He could see Tony’s shadowy form moving across the room, dousing the remaining candles, then tossing his coat, boots and the rest of his clothing as he went, like he was shedding an ungainly skin.
“I would suggest a different encasement for your arc reactor.  I noticed that you use it to power your metal suit. This,” he said, walking over and hefting a large, round, gray object that slid out from a panel in the wall.  “This material should provide a proper core to contain the reactor for as long as you need it.”
“Oh God, that’s amazing!”  Cam blurted out, grinning.  His smile faltered as quickly as it had appeared.  “I’m going to mess up. Break something. Get sent to the mines.  They make you wear birds on your head, you know.”
“I will not keep him, if he doesn’t wish it, but this is truly important.  You trusted me before.  I ask that you do it again,” Steve said.
“I have to go,” Steve said, standing up.  “Thank you for your time.”
“Huh?  Oh, yeah.  Fine.  Good.  I should really get JARVIS plugged in at some point, you know?  I’d almost forgotten how quiet and non-sarcastic a room can be up here,” Tony said absently, glancing over at the garage.
So. Not
As Steve stepped out of the water, Cam rushed over with a cool, wet towel that had been dipped in fresh rosewater, which Steve used to wipe the sticky sheen of salt off his skin, and a small parasol, which Cam held aloft to shade Steve’s face from the heat of the sun. Easy to get used to, Steve thought again, then made an attempt to smile his thanks at the boy that seemed to fall flat, by Cam’s expression.
.  When you stop being enough, you’ll be gone, too.  He won’t be able to stomach looking at you.  Just like Stone.  Just like Lady Bain.  Just like all the others. Except you don’t get some pile of rocks and a title to go with it, you get some other Master, and then another Master, and then another, because
“So be it. Soldier,” Tony cut him off.  He was leaning forward in his chair, gaze directed at Steve with the same bright-eyed intensity he’d had before, but it was tight now, his jaw working around the words like they came served on a bed of sand.  “Let us see what you can do.”  Tony nodded his acquiescence and the men advanced towards Steve, all at once.  Steve lifted his shield and regarded the men as they formed something of a circle around him.
“No.  Natasha said he was working,” Pepper replied after a pause.  He could hear the question in her voice, but, thankfully, she cared more about him than satisfying her own curiosity.  One of the many reasons he loved her.  “Natasha also said to tell you that Steve took the papers to some lawyer friend.  Murdock.  I looked him up, and he does criminal defense down in Hell’s Kitchen.  Odd choice, but I guess they know him.”
“Yes, Captain, how might I be of assistance?” the AI asked.
“Right, right.  Well, anyway, they put a fence around it, you know. The statue.  Bucky said that was on account of him trying to climb it, because he wanted to ride double with Washington.  I don’t think it really was, though,” Steve added with a slight frown.
“It’s a great article!” Tony protested.
“You’re right.  All this hanging out with a handsome billionaire, living in a penthouse, eating at five-star restaurants and spending more on a suit than I make in a month is really taking a toll,” Steve deadpanned in reply, earning a surprised bark of laughter from Tony.  “Guess I can manage to muddle through a few more days,” he sighed dramatically, then grinned and bit his lip with a slightly sheepish look that made Tony’s stomach do some kind of leap.
“At least someone’s paying attention. Guy has
“Please,” Steve repeated, that one word seeming to mean something more to both of them.
“Don’t worry?” Tony repeated.  He looked over at Steve, who was frowning.
He could still see the circus wallpaper border in the doctor’s office. It was an incredibly vivid memory, clear and precise, undimmed by the passing of decades. Some sort of line of demarcation, he supposed. There had been a blue train with a smiling face pulling grinning, brightly colored animals in puffy-barred cages behind it.  Sometimes, he could feel the sticky thin sheet of paper covering the faux leather exam table rubbing against the backs of his thighs while the doctor talked in low tones to his mother, patting her gently on the shoulder. Consoling, he knew now. He remembered the way the doctor had recoiled, drawing back and dropping Tony’s wrist as if it burned, before he regained some composure.
“So, wait, you said you had to go into cryosleep to stave off the need to, ah, do this. Why? What’s that about?  I mean, can’t you just, you know?” Tony asked, making a crude, jerking motion between his legs.
He quirked his mouth to the side as he chewed on the inside of his cheek. The other explanation, the other, rather obvious explanation, was...well, okay,maybe it was ego, but he hadn't really considered that Steve wouldn't actually want him like that. All Alphas wanted Omegas, right? That was...just how things worked. Alphas needed to knot, and Omegas needed to be knotted. Screwdriver was just a fucked-up, useless, hammer-wannabe without a screw, after all.
It grated.  God, it
He wondered if Tony even liked the soaps.  Or cared.  Probably not, he thought, poking at the slightly dry chicken with his plastic fork.  It wasn’t like they were anything special.  He should get Tony something special.  Stop obsessing about the soaps.  It was just, he didn’t buy a lot of things on his own. Someone at SHIELD did most of that for him, and he let them, because he didn’t want to explain it was all so overwhelming and different and just the act of making a decision about which soap to get nearly had him breaking down in the middle of the canned food aisle.  Probably not what they wanted to hear about Captain America. Not exactly confidence-inspiring.
“Tony!” Steve shouted, kneeling down next to him.  “Oh my God, Tony, what—are you okay? What happened?  What—God, Tony. Where is it? Where is it? What did he do with it?” Steve asked, looking frantically around.  “Hang on, please, just stay with me, okay? Just stay with me, Tony, please. I need you to stay with me,” Steve pleaded.  He looked up at Tony, eyes wide and wet and bright with terror.
“Sorry I’m late.  I know you hate that,” Steve said, giving her a flat smile.  She laughed a little, though, her eyes warming.
Two of Zola’s guards waited for him when he finally left the King’s chambers.  He followed them in silence back to the compound, unable to stop turning the prior night over and over in his mind.  He was so distracted, it took him a moment to notice that they took a different path from the compound’s courtyard, turning right at the fountain instead of left.
When Steve tried to call his mind to look back over the past month, it all had the soft-edged quality of a dream, unreality tugging at the corners until it seemed it would all fall apart if he tried to force it into focus. That first night, after he fell asleep with Tony by his side, he had woken up in his bed gasping for air, arms flailing out to grab onto something, anything, because he was sinking, sinking down into the too-soft bed, being swallowed by it.  He had disentangled himself from Tony’s embrace and curled on the floor between the bed and the door, moving his shield and sword to their usual places within reach and finally slept again, only to wake to the soft, dappled light of morning filtering into the room and the warm press of Tony’s body curved against his back.  He had been horrified, and tried to coax Tony back into bed, but Tony had just threaded his arms under Steve’s, wrapping one hand in Steve’s and laying it over Steve’s chest, before telling Steve to go back to sleep and promising to take care of it, though Steve had not known what that meant at the time.
Ok, well, that was odd.  Tony was the one that had wanted the pizza to go with an evening of something called “Firefly” that was apparently the greatest thing ever and could not be spoken of without a rant about big entertainment companies and their inability to see anything other than the bottom line.
“Um. Hello,” Steve replied, awkward embarrassment flooding through him. Did she know why he was calling?  Of course, she knew.  Heck, she probably arranged these things for Stark all the time.  Steve gulped, and sat up straighter, glancing over at Brock, who was watching him with an avid interest.  “Yes, ah, Mr. Stark mentioned you helped him with his art collection.  Last night. When I--when we--kind of met.  I didn’t realize you did this kind of...I mean. Ah.” He winced.  That was probably not a good way to start this discussion.
“He did not know, Cam.  He would never allow you to be harmed,” Steve assured the boy. Tony could not have known.  Steve refused to believe it.  Tony had assumed Cam was Steve’s attendant from the beginning.  Tony would never countenance such a thing as Stane’s perversion. Even for someone he held in such high regard.  He wouldn’t.  Steve had to believe that, even as some traitorous voice in the back of his mind kept demanding to know how such a thing could have gone unnoticed for so long.  And yet, had Hydra not grown right under Fury’s ever-watchful eye?  Had not Steve himself spilled blood alongside several of Schmidt’s own?
“Of course,” Tony replied.  The silence hung there for a long moment, both of them staring out at the Strip instead of looking at each other until Tony figured one of them was going to have to either jump off the balcony or actually bring up the room’s pachyderm-shaped occupant.
happening to him?--they would probably take to their torches and turn him out of the valley.  True, he planned to leave soon, anyway, but not on those terms.  Once the farm was set to rights and the harvest brought in, he could leave to join Bucky. At least that was his plan.
Steve caught Tony’s eye for a moment, then looked back up at the stars with a far-off expression that seemed, not quite sad, but...longing, Tony decided.  Of course, that made sense. Steve’s people were gone. He might very well be the last of his kind, and this whole mate situation seemed deeply important to him.
“Me too,” Nat chimed in.  “Make yourself at home, okay?  There’s leftovers in the fridge.  Borscht.  It’s delicious.”
“And just what kind of ruckus did you cause that made the raiders so eager to get rid of you?” Hammer asked drolly, swishing the feather back and forth and then jabbing it in the air like a sword.
“Come on, Cap.   Show me why I’m wrong, and it’s an amazing fruit bowl,” Tony challenged.  Two hours later, Tony was ready to admit defeat.  Not because he had been moved to care deeply about art, but because Steve did, and he cared about Steve, and actually, listening to Steve talk about something he was passionate about was, well, interesting in and of itself.  He’d mainly put the piece in the kitchen to get a rise out of Steve anyway.  Who knew art could be so fascinating?  Really, the Met should just have Steve narrate the tours.  It was almost as if seeing someone you loved enjoying themselves so much made you happy, too.
“How bad is it?  Terminal, right?  Tell me, Brucie-bear.  I can take it.  I once binge-watched the odd numbered Treks.  I can handle the pain.  Lay it on me,” Tony demanded.
The car wasn’t there anymore.
There was a clutter of papers atop the table, as well, and it was these that the Omega was carefully rolling up. He had stopped, mid-motion, at Bucky’s voice, and was staring at the papers in his hand as if they were poisonous.
“Just saying…” Tony shrugged.
“Oh-ho-ho, is he now?  I don’t know about that.  My money’s on the robot,” Stane said.  He lit the end of the cigar and sucked in his cheeks, then puffed out a ring of smoke.  “What do you think, Howard?  Captain America versus robot?”
“If you listen very, very closely, you can hear them scream when you put the hook through them,” Steve said.
“You don’t even know what it is,” Tony replied with an abbreviated laugh.
“Not as well as I’d hoped,” Steve admitted with a chagrined half-smile. He dropped his gaze from Tony’s questioning one, shifting slightly on his feet before pulling his eyes back to Tony’s.  In the dim moonlight, he could just see the whites and the crescent of light reflected there, but he knew they were full of questions.  “I had a dream. Just—just something that I’ve dreamt before.  Nothing---it was nothing.  Nothing to bother you with.”
He managed to brace his forearms on either side of Tony’s head, hands threading through Tony’s tousled hair, head dipping forward to bury against Tony’s shoulder. Steve could feel Tony’s hands running over his back in slow, gentle strokes.  Tony was making soothing, shushing sounds into Steve’s temple.  Steve wondered why, then realized he was still shuddering, and some kind of half-sob, half-gasps were being torn from his throat.  He wanted to tell Tony that it had been too good, too much, too everything, but he couldn’t get his throat to do more than try to swallow over a sand-dry patch.
Steve slept.  When he woke, it was tomorrow.
Steve sighed.  Staying in bed, wrapped up with Tony all day sounded far more appealing than heading to the construction site.  He briefly considered calling in sick.  He never did that…he could take one day…but then his guilty conscience kicked in and he shifted out from under Tony’s hand to climb out of bed.  “I’ll probably be back before you have your second cup of coffee,” Steve said with a reassuring smile.
There was no place for these kinds of thoughts between them.  Tony was his King.  Whatever friendship they shared, it could go no further.  Steve knew that.
. It always has been. I want to build it with you, fill it with us, with our family. That is the future I see. You. You and what we can make together, that is my hope, my dream. I look at you, and I am home. I am where I belong. I’ve never had that before, and I will not let it go, Steve. I can’t. So, if you need those things through me, then I will build them for you, until you see that they are much yours as they ever were mine. And if there is a fight that is worth fighting, I would be by your side to fight it.”
. Well.  Fanboy mode engaged.
“Can you really blame me?” Tony asked the crowd, who all seemed to take it as one big joke.
it,” Steve chuckled.  “Wanted to be something cool, like Clark or Gary.  After you,” Steve said, holding open the door for Tony.  Clark or Gary, Tony mouthed silently.  Okay.  Outside the cabin, Tony could hear the sound of tires on gravel, which meant their ride had arrived.  “That’d be Happy with the car.  There’s a little place not too far from SHIELD. Kind of a hole in the wall, but I’ve heard its good.  Thought we’d stop there for dinner before the—ah, observatory,” Steve suggested.
“You really are trying to kill me,” Tony muttered.  “Anything else?”
“God, I’ve missed you,” Tony murmured against his mouth, hands coming up from where they’d been running up and down his stomach to cup jaw in a light caress.  Tony paused, pulling back enough to trace gentle fingers along Steve’s jawline where Stane’s slap had landed.  There wasn’t anything left but a light shading, damn his fair skin, but he could see Tony’s mouth tighten into a grimace.
“I was running low, and this was all the hotel gift shop had in my size,” Steve said, glancing down at the boxers adorned with playing cards.  “Sorry it isn’t the thong. I know you liked that.”
At least, if it came down to it, Tony could pay him off, though, God, that thought stung, he thought bitterly.  He wondered, not for the first time, what Steve had done with all the money beyond the initial little shopping spree Tony had gotten to see close-up.  Good to know he wasn’t worth quite as much as a new TV and X-box, he supposed, but five million dollars was a lot to blow through, even in a decade’s time.
“For one thing, he says Bonded Omegas who are of age should get to vote for themselves,” Tony replied, the words rushing out, as if swiftness could somehow dilute their meaning.  “So, there’s that.”
Like his friend.  His friend who died, Tony’s mind chimed in.  Remember, the one you like to bring up when it’s convenient to help yourself out?
“I mean,” Tony continued, taking his hands out of his pockets and pointing at his chest.  “You get these plans you want so badly, and all I get is shot down. All in all, not how I was picturing this evening going. So, let’s say, we make a trade.”
“Not so very much,” Steve assured him automatically. It wasn’t true, but the pain was almost welcome now, a steady, stinging ache he could focus on, something that could be fixed.
“We’re just doing some, what do you guys call it?  Recon?” Tony asked.
“Fine,” Tony responded, getting up from the table with Steve held out in front of him while various bits of food dropped to the floor in wet plops.  “I’m going. Under protest.”  He took the bags of supplies and marched to the elevator, leaving a trail of suspiciously marinara-colored footprints in his wake.  Steve liked the elevator ride up just as much this time, waving insistently at their reflections until Tony gave up and did the same.
“Which floor is your room?” Steve asked, staring at the panel of buttons.  Thank God Steve was so into this.  Tony really was a very lucky man.
“You know that isn’t what I meant,” Tony replied, lightly jabbing his finger into Steve’s side in mock rebuke.
“I’m sure they’d tell you that you could do a lot better,” Steve replied, giving Tony a lopsided, deprecating smile that made Tony’s chest tighten.
“No, the other suits are trying to help. That one is a pillow away from going all Hall 9000,” Tony grumbled. Once the doors slid shut, Tony hit the button to take them to Bruce’s lab. “How are you feeling? Everything okay? I got the readouts from 30, of course. Your blood pressure was a little high this morning, so I had 21 make sure to elevate your feet—“
to go there, but what about this night was planned?  This was the direction he would always go to get there, and the other option, the road down, took him right into town, which was decidedly not where he wanted to go at the moment.  And how had the man known he used to play at slaying dragons? Sure, lots of boys probably did that, even Bucky liked to join in sometimes when they met up down by Bucky’s house nearer to town.
“Thanks, Nat,” Steve replied.
“Yes,” Steve replied.  His voice was a bit shaky, but other than that, he was fine.  “I thought I saw...something.”
“We can do more,” Tony replied.  He pointed the remains of a mini-cheeseburger at Steve.  “Don’t give me that look, you knew what I was going to say,” Tony said to Ms. Potts, one hand raised in supplication while she pursed her lips.  “My better half made a good point at the presser. While we’re helping Jaime Lannister, here—”
Tony watched him walk into his apartment and pull the door shut behind him, then closed his own door with a soft snick.  He leaned his forehead against the freshly-painted wood and breathed in and out.  It was going to be okay.  They were going to work this out.  Maybe not instantly, not with the big, sweeping kiss the way Tony had wanted it that night he found out about what Howard had done, but something forged from stronger stuff.  Not many people got a chance at a do-over.  He wasn’t going to screw this up.
“Then I’ll have a nice talk with them about their job prospects,” Steve replied.
Steve startled at that…Nat knew how he felt?  Sam was one thing, but now Nat?  Of course, he probably should’ve figured that.  He’d never had much of a poker face, never been able to keep his feelings from showing through.  Damn.  That was…embarrassing, to say the least.
“That’s someone’s ass in running pants,” Tony pointed out.
“Oh, hey,” Steve said, almost in surprise when Tony opened the garage door.  “Got what you asked for.  And, some lunch. If you’re hungry,” Steve finished, holding out the white container of food and brown bag of put-it-on-the-list-crap that Tony didn’t really want.
“Uh, we called you Third Wheel for like six months.  To your face.  Tony rolled a tire to your apartment.  With a little sign that said “Third Wheel” on it. With sparkles.  He used glitter glue, for Christ’s sake,” Barnes reminded him.  “Nat had that t-shirt made that said Official Third Wheel.  We went bike riding that time and all chipped in to pay the rental guy an extra fifty to say all he had for you was that big tricyle.”
From the time Tony brought it up, he had held his hesitation about this journey back only because he wasn’t sure if it was due to his own desire to avoid returning or if he was the only one not overreacting to Bucky’s delayed return. It wasn’t even truly delayed.  Bucky had said he would be there for the wedding, and that wasn’t for another month, the date looming in his head like it was lit with fire, though at least Tony and Ms. Potts seemed to have stopped asking him for input after his fortieth or so non-response.  He did remember to ask about the little chickens, so he figured Bucky owed him one, which was probably going to be a good thing when Steve showed up in the ruins of their home with half the Kingdom in tow.
Captain America. With the shield and everything.  In the ice or something, can you believe this shit?  Holy shit!  Captain America! For real!” Rhodey panted.   “You gotta—oh, you’re watching it.  Turn it on! This is history, man, come on!” Rhodey said and walked to the other side of the bed, sitting down next to Tony and tossing the quilt over his feet, which jittered enough that Tony had to reach out a hand to get him to stop.  “Dude.  Captain America.  Can you imagine?  God, that’s gotta be such a trip for him, though.  Shit.  Bet he’s freaked the fu—hell out.”
Tony, apparently, that’s who. Tony, who he hadn’t spoken to for nearly two years.  Tony, who didn’t call him.  Tony, who he thought probably hated him.
“So, you’re saying you don’t think it is good for a relationship if one partner uses the other partner’s moment of emotional vulnerability to his or her advantage to get what they want?”  Steve asked evenly.
“I’ve seen your sketches,” Tony said, making Steve remember what the guard had said about Tony looking through his sketchbook.  “You’ve a good eye and a good hand.  They are truly quite well done.”
He clapped Steve on the shoulder, shook his head and sighed, which seemed to signal that whatever it was, it was Steve’s problem, not his, which Steve supposed it was. The Omega was unhappy about something, which did not make very much sense, given that his enemies were no more, he had a night of pleasure (and a morning), and a full belly. The Omega, though, was singularly confounding, Steve had realized sometime that morning when he presented the head of the Omega’s enemy to him, cleaved from his body by Steve’s own sword. This feat had not seemed to particularly impress the Omega, though he did not seem displeased either, and his pleasure was loud and sure in the time afterwards.
Tony wrapped his arms around Steve, burying his face against the crook of Steve’s neck. “Well.  I can’t think of why, but I get the feeling they really, really wanted it to spell shield,” Tony replied.
“Breathe,” the King said, almost gently.  Steve blinked at him.  Finally, the tight coldness in his chest registered and he sucked in a breath.  “Good,” the King said, then leaned forward and took Steve in his mouth again.  The King wound his tongue around the head, smearing the droplets that had gathered there, and then started to suck, making some kind of obscene wet, sucking moan as he did. He flattened his tongue and worked the underside of Steve’s cock, laving wide strokes over it, then found the slit and niggled his tongue up and down and inside of it.
The bed shifted under him as Steve moved forward.  Tony felt the heavy weight of Steve’s hand wrapping around the back of his neck.  He swallowed.   His eyes fell shut.  A low thrum of ballooning pressure built in his groin, running down the length of his cock and back up again, coiling around his balls and gripping, making them tighten with need.  Steve pushed.  No teasing pressure this time.  No half-hearted testing attempt, like the time in the garage.  Steve pushed, and Tony bent down at the waist, hips rising in the air as his legs splayed wide.  His forehead hit the coolness of the sheet, and he opened his eyes, turning his head to the left so he could see their reflections in the mirror above the dresser.  His Alpha, kneeling behind him, all golden and bright, looking impossibly big against Tony’s smaller frame, with one hand extended to curl around Tony’s neck, holding him in place.  Being held, Tony thought, feeling the pad of Steve’s thumb rub a soothing line back and forth into his skin.
“Hey, Tony.  Wow.  You look great,” Steve said as he stood up from his seat on the sofa in his suit that fit him like the silkworms wound it around him and smiled softly at Tony.  Tony’s breath caught in his throat.  His chest hitched and his stomach sank to his knees then floated back up to a cradle of warmth that filled his belly.   “I like your tie,” Steve told him, a small, shy smile tugging at his lips.
“---pull ‘em down and show us—“
“Hello,” Jarvis said, sounding a bit out of breath.  “Tony? Are you there?” Jarvis asked after a moment of silence.
“Fine.  I already did most of the project,” Tony admitted, then pressed a kiss to the outline of Steve’s rib.  His project was currently sitting in a pile of wires and electrodes in the robots’ bedroom, which was what he called the spare room where DUM-E and U were stashed, with their posters of Wall-E, BB-8 and the Curiosity Rover on the wall.  Eventually, he hoped, if he could get the damn algorithm right, the system would detect feedback a person’s brainwaves in a just a few seconds, without even needing a voice command.  In theory.  It was exhausting, trying to think his way through each command, though.  Felt unnatural. Had to be an easier way, but damn if he could think of it. Anyway, point being, it was mostly—almost—sort of all the way done. “We’re going to watch the extended editions of Lord of the Rings. Please don’t nitpick the battles this time.”
Steve pushed himself up onto his elbows with a frown and watched the King turn away, walk a few steps, stop, rake a hand through his hair, then continue on, disappearing into the antechamber.  A few seconds later, a loud, clanging bang erupted from there, followed by a muttered curse, then a heavy, deliberate quiet.
“I’m sorry, I’ve gone temporarily deaf, what was that?” Murdock asked placidly. “Hey, I went instantly blind. It can happen,” Matt said at Pepper’s silence.
“Oh!” Tony gasped in surprise as he felt the full sort of pressure against the tip of his cock suddenly ease and a warm rush of liquid engulf him as his knot retracted. Steve let out a short cry, his body stiffening briefly as the knot released and Tony eased out of him. There was a thin, clear trail of slick between the end of his cock and Steve’s hole, the last evidence of what had tethered them together for so long. Tony sighed and collapsed back onto his heels as Steve rolled to his side, body trembling every few seconds with the after-effects.
“Indeed,” Zola agreed.  “I do miss Lord Stone’s patronage, though replacing my inventory so quickly was becoming a challenge.”
“There’s a glitter bomb in my future, isn’t there?” Tony asked.
happen again.  But times like this, Steve thought about it.  At night, he thought about it, while he drifted through the deep blackness.  When Shellhead laughed or smiled, Steve thought about it. When he turned a certain way and the sun caught the red and gold of his tentacles, Steve thought about it.
Tony yowled.
“If you practiced, you could probably get it on even days, too,” Tony suggested. Steve grinned, and Tony found himself, well, not smiling back, more like blinking in confusion, squirming in his seat and looking away, but his whole chest bloomed with a pleased warmth at the attention and obvious approval, which was, you know, nice and God, stop that, he told himself firmly, though he was currently not listening to himself particularly well.  Maybe Howard had it right on his listening skills after all.  “So, right.  Einstein-Rosen bridges, yeah, I mean, I’ve read about them.  A bit. Like a paragraph or a footnote.  The pictures were pretty.”
Most people were like him.   Takers. Not like…not like, well.  Not like that.
“Yeah, that’s...not at all ominous and creepy, oh, hey, okay,” Tony said as the alien trailed one of his large, smooth hands down Tony’s chest to rest on his stomach.  “Warn a guy, how about?”
“She sent a picture,” Pepper said after a moment’s pause.  She pushed a button on her phone and held it out in front of her, aiming it in Tony’s direction.
“Got my GED for the Army. After 9/11,” Steve explained, giving Tony a quick look.  “Like you said.  The GED thing, not the Army thing.  You weren’t too keen on the Army thing--,” Steve stopped and dragged his eyes up to Barnes, who just gave a slow, deliberate shake of his head, once, back and forth.
at.  Observed.  Seen.
“You needed help. I could provide help. I cannot look away from that and pretend not to see it,” the alien replied, then smiled and ducked his head again, before looking up at Tony.  “My helpmate would have said it was foolish, too. But, he would have done the same. I think you would do the same, too, Tony Stark.”
Under the notebook was a cigar box, one of those cheap, yellow, wooden ones with the shiny, gold edges. Inside, a white handkerchief with his initials sewn in red threads at one corner was wrapped around a small sprig of flowers. He recognized it as the one he’d shoved in Steve’s hand at his mom’s funeral, and the wispy, dried flowers were the gesture they’d carried with them that day, both too young to have to be that old. A dark red leather ring box sat in one corner of the cigar box, though Tony didn’t touch it. He knew what was inside, and if he looked at that now, he’d probably run from the building.
“I’d always had something of a knack for getting myself in trouble.  Shooting my mouth off with nothing to back it up, trying to do these crazy stunts, giving my mom fits, I guess,” Steve began, speaking slowly, drawing Tony’s attention back to him.  “I don’t know, kid stuff, mostly.  Stupid. But…that time, for the first time, it didn’t feel like kid stuff.  It felt like I was making some kind of decision, sitting there watching the previews, with my pockets full of so many contraband snacks I think my pants shook when I walked.  I was suddenly going to do something, but…something that mattered.  Me.  Nothing-to-him-Steve-Rogers.  Even if I did get my ass kicked.  Because it was the right thing to do.  Crazy, I guess,” Steve said, running a hand around the back of his neck and looking away, like he was glancing down the Strip, but Tony thought he wasn’t seeing much of anything except maybe a darkened theater.
Steve took the coin from Tony’s hand, turned and dropped it in the water.  It made a soft plink as it landed and sank to the bottom, where it gleamed amidst the darker coins.
Like. Hell.
“You are not fine,” Cam retorted with a pointed sharpness.  “The King said I was to take special care of you today, and if you become distressed, I am to signal the carriage driver to get a message to him.  I will tell him.  He will come and insist you eat, and then you will feel better. You will see,” Cam finished, crossing his spindly arms over his chest.
“I think I was doing the opposite of that, actually,” Steve objected, an easy laugh spilling forth at Stark’s audacity.
“I’m…working on it,” Tony said with a huff of a laugh.
in Dubai
Tony glanced up at him from under his lashes and hummed noncommittally. He released Steve’s cock with a regretful sigh, but his hand traveled lower, cupping Steve’s balls again, making Steve hiss with a tight, painful pleasure at the motion.  His fingers skated lower, across that delicate band of skin, finding the small nub there and grinding down. Steve’s back arched into the burst of pleasure that exploded deep inside him.  White stars danced behind his eyelids.
They were the last ones to leave the near-silent restaurant, though Tony tipped well enough that no one seemed to mind.  It was late when they got back to the Tower, most of the lights already dark when they stepped out of the elevator into the common room.  He wasn’t ready for the day to end, truth be told, but had no idea beyond abject begging how to extend it any further than he already had.
“Come for me, Tony, that’s it, baby, come for me,” Steve said as he pulled out almost entirely, catching just the head of his cock on Tony’s rim, then thrust home again.
It had been burned into his skin.  Melted through into a deep swath of Steve’s side that was just…gone.
Finally, he stopped. His knuckles were raw and bloody, looking a bit like pulverized meat. The bag was black, so the only evidence it revealed were slightly darker spots that glistened with wetness where his punches had landed. It swayed on its chain, making an eerie creaking sound at the place where the chain connected to the ceiling, like a door that needed oiling.
“Tony,” he heard himself say, half a groan, half in wonder.
“I, on the other hand, have technically been chasing after you since Bagram,” Tony pointed out, looking up at Steve from under his eyebrows.  “So, A for effort on my part. Never give up, all that,” he added with a low shrug.  “Didn’t expect to see you again after you blew me off in Bagram. In the not-fun way,” he teased, rolling his lips together as he watched a blush redden Steve’s cheeks. It really was a good look on him, Tony could easily admit. “But, you know, stars align, fate, kismet, destiny, all that.  Universe wants to give us a shot, why not go for it?”
“My phone,” Barnes broke in.
Steve laved his tongue against Tony’s thumb, swirling around it and suckling lightly as Tony drew it out, painting Steve’s lips with his own saliva before dropping his hand to his side and regarding Steve with a warm, pleased look.
You poured my blood into the Hudson, he told her days later, while she stared at him, wide-eyed with dawning horror.
“Close enough,” Brock replied with a low laugh.  “I could do with a little celebration of our own, you know.  Been too long.  Been thinking about you and him, you know, and fuck, that’s hot, not gonna lie,” he growled against Steve’s ear.  His hand skimmed down to the waistband of Steve’s boxers, tugging at them.  “Bet Stark just loved that tight, little ass of yours, didn’t he?  You liked it too, I’ll bet.  Bet you took it like a champ.  Fuck, I’m hard just thinking about it,” he added, grinding against Steve’s thigh to prove his point. “Roll over for me, hot stuff, and hand me the lube, huh?”
“Tony, it won’t bother me, whatever it is, I swear,” Steve promised, putting as much certainty as he could muster into his words.  He meant it.  Whatever it was clearly made Tony uncomfortable, and Steve hated that.
“I—no, I—I’ve never been here—I’m not.  No one sent me. I’m a guest. I got lost, I—this is my first time,” Steve said, struggling to form words while his mind reeled with the combined realizations of Tony being here, Tony being so desperately young, and Tony hitting on Steve like he was one of the punching bags at the gym. That was…not what Steve had expected.  At all.
Tony couldn’t say why the sight opened such a wide, gaping pit in his stomach, but it was like being punched in the gut and pulled apart at the same time.  A part of him wanted to turn around and walk out.  Run out, really.  Go to his garage and pretend he had never seen this.  If he left now, he wouldn’t have to hear whatever it was Steve was going to say, and they could go back to not-fishing and arguing about movies and debating whether doing the probabilities in his head counted as cheating at cards.
“Why?” Tony asked. “What the hell does that even mean?” He meant it to sound demanding, not all whiny and pleading like it came out, but he didn’t know what to do with this whole conversation.  He wanted to go back to his room, crawl into bed and spend the next twelve hours reliving everything he’d done wrong since he got up.  As one did.
Steve lowered his head again and spread Tony apart with his hands. He waited a beat, until Tony’s body started to jerk and stutter, calf muscles bunching and contorting as he tried to keep still, then bent his head.  Steve let his mouth hover over Tony’s hole for a long moment, warming it with his breath, then dabbed at the puckered edge, poking and prodding while Tony moaned, low and long and broken, fractured by sharp, harsh, stuttering cries, and pushed back against Steve’s mouth.
“What?” Steve responded, giving Tony a curious look.
Steve sat on the sofa, staring at the horizon and put his head in his hands.  “Any word, JARVIS?” he asked, same as every day.
He wondered how long Steve had studied it before catching sight of Tony’s little bit of rebellion. He wondered how often Steve took the picture out, held it up and looked at the image, what he thought about when he did, if he did.  What he saw there that Tony still couldn’t quite see.  He saw coltish angles and uncooperative hair.  A terrible suit and more eye make-up than he needed unless he was trying out for the role of the Black Swan.  An expression that hugged the border between mutinous and terrified.
“Pepper…” Tony whined.  “I know, okay?  I know I’m bad at this stuff.  I get it.  But…it’s Steve, Pep.  Tell me I can fix this.  I need—I have to fix this.  I can’t…almost have this.  This can’t be a regret.  I can’t do that.  So…so you’re just going to have to help me out here, because if I’ve fucked this one up, I don’t know if I can walk away from that, Pep.”
“It’s late.  You should go inside,” Steve said, looking over his shoulder at the waiting cabin, while Tony struggled to keep any kind of neutral expression on his face.  He could hear the limo grinding down the road towards the highway, and when he managed to tear his gaze away from Steve, the taillights were disappearing around the curve.  He didn’t want the night to end, not like this, not fizzling out into tired goodnights, where they went to their own rooms, like friendly companions who just happened to share some official paperwork.  He didn’t think he could bear that. Not tonight.
So easy to do, now, like this, when it was always--
“Stop,” Anto ordered in Clan.
“I was told I didn’t have a choice,” Barnes said, pushing past Nat and Rhodey to step into the apartment.
“And that kind of talk could get you thrown back in a dungeon if you aren’t careful,” Tony finished.
“I only ever wanted you to be happy, Tony.  I know, those last few months we were together—I know I wasn’t here for you like I should have been,” Steve acknowledged with a frustrated puff of air.  “I let—things, work, I don’t know—get in the way.  And…there’s something—something I have to tell you.  I guess it took me awhile to really see it, and then I did, and I knew I had to tell you, but…I didn’t want to hurt you.  And I let that be my excuse for so long, I--” he broke off, running a hand through his hair, then dropping them both to his waist in what Tony liked to think of as the Classic Steve Rogers Decision-Making Pose.  Tony grinned and took another sip of his coffee.
“Together,” Tony said, threading his fingers through Steve’s. At first, they didn’t talk as they walked along the edge of the river, but soon enough, Steve found himself pointing out things to Tony that he remembered.  It wasn’t until they came to the first fence post that he quiet.  The waist-high stack of stones stood like a cairn, the fencepost itself long lost to fire and rot.  It was the Reilly’s farm, or it had been.  They’d had a bull, a mean cuss of a thing, who was trained to chase children who cut across the field and gore them, if it could, or so the children claimed, though Steve only ever saw the bull interested in chewing on the lush pasture and trying to figure out a way to get to the McDullough’s cows.
Just thinking about his Heat made his stomach turn and chest heave with shuddering breaths.  It had been years since he first hit puberty, and the beginnings of what would settle into his Heat cycle started.  He’d thought he was prepared for it.  He’d read the little yellow pamphlet his mother had given him, with the brightly smiling Omega walking on a sparkling beach, enjoying the warmth of the sun while her toes dipped in the waves, thrilled to be welcoming her first Heat.
jelly, because you’re a heathen.  Coffee for me,” Tony ticked off his list.  “Come on. Don’t want to be late.  Chop-chop.  Daylight’s a’wasting.  Or still coming. Whatever. God, what time is it?”
“Tony,” Steve cut him off.
“Wouldn’t miss it,” Tony said, watching the elevator doors close on Steve’s smile.  There was something wrong with his stomach and chest.  They were all tight and twisted, but in a weirdly good way, which made no sense, and his face kept doing this strange half-smile, half-laugh thing that made his reflection in the metal of the elevator’s door look like he was about to burst into song.
“You’re going to.  You’re…you’re really going to be here?” Steve asked, looking down for a moment before lifting his gaze to Tony’s again.  “In the morning.”
He wouldn’t have wanted Brock to do it.  That was the rub.  If Tony had aimed his offer at Brock, Steve would have told him exactly where he could shove that kind of offer.  He didn’t want Brock to do that with Tony.  Steve blinked and frowned down at his hands curled into his lap while Brock snored softly next to him.  He didn’t want Brock to do that with anyone was what he meant.  It was just weird to think about Brock with Tony, that was all, since Tony didn’t seem to like Brock very much.  Of course, he didn’t really know Brock, not like Steve did, and if Tony did get to know him… actually, something told Steve time would not really fix Tony’s impression of Brock.  Which bothered him.  Steve wasn’t sure why Tony’s disdain for Brock bothered him so much, but it did.
“You’re so wet for me, baby,” Steve groaned, low and rumbly and clearly pleased.  Tony knew he was, knew Steve loved it, but there was something about hearing it, those filthy, wonderful words coming from Steve, that was far better than knowing it in his head.  “God, you’re beautiful, Tony.”
Tony walked a few paces back to the stair railing and peered over the edge where the staircase snaked down to the squares of cracked tile in the vestibule below and sucked in a deep, bracing breath, the kind that filled his chest until it hurt.  His eyes were stinging, tiny, burning pinpricks at the corners.  His knuckles were white where he gripped the railing. Steve’s words, the fear in them, the remembered pain of truth they held, all swirled around in his head.  It still shocked him.  The idea that Steve—wonderful, smart, brave, kind—Steve, could ever think he didn’t belong in Tony’s world.  Had he helped to nurture that by not doing more to make Steve a part of his life?  Probably, Tony thought with a jolt of self-recrimination.  No, not probably.  He had.  But, like Barnes said, they had a second chance to get this right.
“Get. Out,” Steve ground out after a moment.  Dan, not being a total idiot, immediately fled.
“I know,” Steve replied, mouth twisting into a grimace.  He did, he supposed.  “Thank you for your time,” Steve said and started to rise.
Though, he had learned there were limits to that freedom when he attempted to leave the harem compound by way of the large, red doors only to be turned back by Zola’s guards.  Four of them, with tall, wickedly-pointed pikes held out in front of them, though none had touched Steve, only ordered him to return to his chambers.  Fighting them off would have been a simple enough matter, but getting out of the compound had always been the easiest part of any escape.  It was getting out of an unfamiliar and unfriendly city teeming with Tony’s own guards that presented the biggest challenge.  Of course, Tony had, unknowingly, offered Steve exactly that opportunity, if he but waited for it.
“Just an interesting coincidence,” Obie cut in.  “You and this Steve, rekindling the old flame, and then, now, this whole energy thing coming up again.  After we’d already discussed it, and the reasons why it wasn’t a good idea.”
The prompt request was for something from Gift With Purchase Remix.  If you haven't read it, I don't know how much sense this will make, but basically, Steve is a hooker because he needs money for his mom's medical bills (I know), and Tony picks him up and sweeps him away from the clutches of Hammer, who had Very Bad Plans for dear Steve.
“Here we are,” Happy announced.  “Home sweet home.”
,” the Anthony figment in Steve’s head promised, a smile in his voice.
How had even agreed to pick this thing up, whatever it was? Some piece she spotted at one of those galleries pretentious enough to sell a Venus de Milo made of literal shit for thousands of dollars and call itself charitable because it gave space to aspiring artists who had not yet risen to the level of feces-based sculpture.
“Chose?” Steve said.
Steve swallowed thickly, sliding his finger under the collar for a moment when it seemed to tighten around his throat.  He glanced at Cam, where the boy stood at his shoulder, his smile reflected in the glass.
“A Bond?” Steve repeated in surprise.  “We haven’t even met. He doesn’t know anything about me.”  He doesn’t know anything about me. It was a terrible, grasping thought that filled his head, and Steve wanted to push it away.  He doesn’t know me. He doesn’t know enough to say no. No Courting. No waiting for Anthony to realize there was something wrong.  He could be mine, just like that, and he wouldn’t even have to know…any of it. He could just be mine.
“You came for me,” Steve husked out. “You really… you did.  You’re here.”
…Steve’s body bucked wildly as he came into his hand, quickly trying to catch what he could before he made a mess on his bed that meant he’d have to wash the sheets himself instead of leaving it to the cleaning crew.  Grabbing Kleenex to clean up the mess as best he could, Steve stepped to the bathroom to clean up and then sat on the edge of the bed, hands braced against the mattress.
“Shall I prepare your bath?” Cam asked as he followed Steve into the room.
“What of you?  I hear Lord Sitwell saved you from the fighting pits,” Kadina remarked.  “An untrained concubine for the King. Zola must have truly been desperate.  He was most displeased when the King became so taken with you.  Our illustrious harem Master does not care for the unexpected, and you…you are most unexpected, King’s Prize.”
“I knew there was a reason I kept you around,” Tony said as he unwrapped the cheeseburger.
“Troublemaker, huh?”  Tony asked before he could stop himself. Rogers just laughed though, a short, relieved sound, followed by a rueful smile that made whatever it was wrapped around Tony’s chest uncoil a bit.  Hey, at least he wasn’t being thrown over a conference room table while his parents munched on croissants and coffee downstairs.  Always a silver lining.  And Jarvis said he wasn’t an optimist.
Sorry for the delay with this chapter, and thank you for your patience!  At least it is a long one.
“Well done, Lord Stone,” Tony said, with a wave of his hand.
“Make spear go far,” Anto explained.
“What, were we metal detecting along the beach and stumbled on a couple of pennies, a ring and a wormhole device?  Banner day.  Okay, okay,” Tony said with a wave of his hand.  “Theoryland.  I can play.  We have an alien-made, space-portal-punching device.  What do I think we do with it?   We poke it.”
“Thank you,” Steve replied.  “He’d have liked you, I think.  He’d have told me I was in way over my head, but he’d have liked you.”
“Are you kidding?  He’s kidding, right?” Howard Stark asked brusquely as he adjusted his tie using the reflection in a black-paneled screen behind him.  His hair was light gray now, and his face was thinner than Steve remembered, like it had been stretched tighter over the bone, but there was no doubt who it was.
“Fall back, and I’ll catch you, huh?” Steve said, giving Tony a sharp look.
Two weeks of absolutely wonderful later, and Steve had gotten a lead on Bucky, somewhere in Northern Europe according to Natasha. Which is how Steve ended up in Dierdre’s office down in marketing, shuffling back and forth on his feet and trying not to blush as he asked for another copy of the Captain America promotional poster he’d viewed all those weeks ago. The one Tony had, uh…liked…so much.
That could be enough.  He should be happy with that.  It was more than he’d ever thought he would have, this lack of being a disappointment, this absence of constant worry about every, little thing he did or said.  Let alone the fact that Steve actually seemed to rather enjoy his presence.  Coulson even thought Steve was doing better since their Bonding.  That had to count for something to Steve.
Tony was hanging his head down between his shoulder blades, convulsions of laughter still wafting through him at regular intervals. When he finally managed to look up at Steve, he was still struggling to contain his mirth, words tumbling from his lips of their own accord.  “God, I love you,” Tony said with a wide grin.  Then Tony immediately tensed, and Steve could see the panic set in on Tony’s expression.  Rock monsters, no worries.  Emotions, and Tony Stark runs for the hills.
Finally, sometime just as the sun was starting to peek over the city, Steve pulled his pants and shoes back on. He stared at the wreck of a hole still puckering beautifully from its place in the wall. Drying streaks formed a lattice-work over the wonderfully supple ass. He could see a pool of it, creamy and thick, inside the man’s gaping hole. He wondered what it felt like, to be filled up like that, just some vessel used by a stranger. He wondered what the stranger got out of that. He wished he knew, though, he supposed maybe the man wondered the same about the men on the other side of the wall. He would have liked to tell the man what the night meant to him, but he honestly had no idea what to say or if the man even had an inkling it was the same person and not a series of anonymous strangers showing up to use what was on offer. Maybe that was part of it for him, Steve didn’t know.
“Ah, come on! You’re as bad as Baby Daddy there,” Clint grumbled, nodding towards Tony.  “It was just an experiment.  For safety reasons. Think of the children, Natasha.”
“What—hey!  That’s not—That is not at all what that was about.  At all, okay? That was Loki and his damn scepter,” Tony sputtered indignantly.  “It had nothing to do with…any of what you just said.”
Tony’s hips found a slow, languorous rhythm as he thrust in and out of Steve’s slick hole.  It was glorious. Steve felt light, boneless, stretched apart, like a cobweb pulled wide between two trees, seemingly one moment from snapping.  He could hear Tony moaning his name, calling out endearments and praise. It sunk into his skin like he could absorb the words the way a sponge seeps up water.
“If you’re too tired—“ Steve began.
“Ste--eve,” Barnes replied in a sing-song voice.
Finally, he opened his eyes again.  One thing at a time, he told himself.  That’s how we do it. Fix one problem, then the next.  Come on, Stark, he admonished himself.
“Those things you signed away. They're worth millions. Probably tens of millions,” Tony told him, watching Steve's face closely for any sign of shock or surprise that never so much as registered. “You could've been sitting pretty, living off the Stark dole all these years instead of blowing it all. Is that what you did? Forget it. I don't care,” Tony corrected with a sharp wave of his hand.
Which led to time.
, Steve thought Tony pulled it off pretty well.
“Night,” Tony said quickly, dropping his gaze and turning for his bedroom.  He pushed open the door and closed it behind him with a soft click, not bothering with the lock.  He could probably leave the door wide open and put out a welcome mat without much of a reaction, Tony thought, pursing his lips with displeasure.
“You hear all kinds of things,” Tony began. Strange happenings.  Most of them aren’t true, of course, not really, but there’s something here, don’t you think?  Some...power. I don’t know,” he added, glancing around. He shook himself a bit, then gave Steve a half-smile.  “People claim to...to
,” Anthony said, leaning his head over the back of the sofa and giving Steve a sloe-eyed look from underneath the long lashes that Steve remembered from his picture.
“Fabulous angry sex,” Tony interjected.  “Which had absolutely nothing to do with…the other thing.  I mean, that was because of the battle, and Steve yelling at me, again, completely—mostly—unreasonably, I might add.”
They were beautiful in a strange way, the pattern of marks on his body. The contrast of colors, maybe, or the way each mark, each color, seemed to brighten with its own spark of pain, from soreness to a sharp sting, depending on how he moved or stood.  It was his, his and Tony’s, but Steve’s to control now, and that thought had been punctuated by a bright burst of pleasure that warmed his chest and sank low, down the line of his cock.  The marks were a part of him now, belonged to him, but were something he could give Tony, too.  He didn’t know why that mattered so much, but it did.
Tony sighed and tightened his hold. Steve could feel the fisted knuckles of Tony’s hand digging into his back, up and down the bones, kneading over stripes of mottled, unyielding flesh. He wondered if Tony was even conscious of the motion. It was strangely soothing, like he was being molded back together, shaped and reforged.
, and it was enough. There are many ways to say you love someone, Steve thought, but nothing greater than seeing the damaged parts and loving those as fiercely as any other, perhaps moreso because they needed it more. Tony would never look away from him, never tell him it was too much or too difficult, and that, that safety, that sanctity, that was home, not some bit of earth and stone.
“This,” Steve guessed.  “This is what you meant.”
“So. Anyway,” Tony began as he stopped just in front of Steve and gave him another once over, “this is a good look on you.   You should keep this look. You should wear this look all the time, in fact. Painting. Laundry. Binge-watching The Bachelorette.”
“I’ll bet,” Tony replied. “So,” Tony began, clearing his throat.  “Army. Lover of art, which you will never mention to Pepper, or I won’t get you back.  Now, Vegas.  Quite the…varied life experiences, there,” Tony tried, struggling for the right, or at least most non-judgmental, words.  He was…curious, he had to admit.  How Steve ended up doing what he was doing.  Not that there was anything wrong with it.  He sure as hell couldn’t talk.  Still, he was…interested.  And they had the evening of enforced togetherness.  Might as well make some effort, particularly given that Steve had some kind of untapped Tony-whispering talents that kept them from becoming more of a spectacle than what was just the norm for an evening out with Tony.
“I really like it,” Steve assured him, looking down at his hand and studying it for a long time.  “What do you want to talk about?”
“You?  You…do art?”  Deirdre said in surprise.
“Guess he’s taking this whole thing better than I believed he would,” Sam added, walking over to stand next to Steve.
Steve suspected Tony’s tale was likely the more accurate, but no matter the reason for it, he couldn’t deny that he loved the way the warm waters made him feel, like he was floating and being held at the same time.  He thought Tony probably understood that, too.  He thought Tony probably understood that every time he came here, it pushed that feeling of being so cold that he burned with it just a little further away.
He looked like a prince, Steve thought, from one of his mother’s stories. They were always dressed like this, weren’t they?  With fancy clothes and jewels the size of your palm.  And they were often lost or on a quest and in need of aid, Steve remembered.  He didn’t think there were many princes who would be wandering around these parts, but the man was surely a nobleman, and he might still need help. Steve’s mother said that we should help when we can, though she usually said that when she was giving him chores to do, and probably hadn’t meant strange men who showed up on the road in the middle of the night, but she hadn’t explicitly said this circumstance was an exception, either.
“Say there was a device like what you’re describing…something alien, maybe…maybe we found it.  What then?” Steve asked.
“I told you my best memory.  Ante up, Mini-Golf Rainman, what’s your best childhood memory?” Tony settled on instead.
“Guessing Howard got the ‘You Tried’ Badge on that one, though, huh?” Tony asked.  “Yeah, forget it.  It’s fine.”
“Tony,” Steve’s voice crackled, breaking and curling around the word like the crest of a wave.  It didn’t even really sound like Tony’s name, but he knew it was.  He was pushing his way through blurry, blue-gowned phantoms before he quite knew what he was doing.  Steve. Steve needed him.  Tony reached out a hand for Steve, dancing over the air above him, trying to find something that qualified as a good place to settle.
Steve picked up the cup of cold tea.  I hope you are still able to build your machines, old friend, Steve thought, looking down at his hands to steady them. The papery skin stretched over bones that cracked and ached when he tried to use them now, but once, once they held a shield like no other and helped shape the fate of the world. Hard to believe, looking at them now, all spotted with age and dappled with bruises that seemed to appear from no discernible cause.
“Bucky, your childhood friend and now roommate,” Tony said with a nod, as if just remembering the name.  “So nice of him to share his things,” Tony said slowly, forming each word carefully while he stared at Steve.
It was terrible, awful, impossible, and Tony shouldn’t want it, but he did.  More than he had ever wanted anything in his life. He couldn’t ask for it, though, he just couldn’t.  Tony had no idea what to say or do, but Steve must have found whatever he was looking for in Tony’s expression, because he smiled, a different kind of smile, knowing and teasing and promising and wonderful, then dipped his head again and closed his mouth around Tony’s cock.
“Like to build things. Take things apart, put them back together,” Tony told him. “Most of its useless, but some of it could be something. Maybe. One day. I don’t know. I had some ideas, crazy though they might have been, once upon a time. Granted, it took a tiny near death experience for inspiration, so I’d rather not repeat that, but, sometimes, I think there was something there. I don’t know. Old habits die hard, you know? Can’t just up and change who you are.”
He was fairly sure the SHIELD therapist would disagree with that assessment, but there was no way Steve was telling her that he couldn’t get this one Omega out of his head, not when she had all but stamped Anthony’s file with a giant, red 4F, Steve thought with a slight frown. She didn’t need to know.  No one did.   It was private.  For him.  Just something that helped, sometimes, to think of Anthony, to hear Anthony’s voice in his head, to see him, standing there in his pale suit with fire in his eyes.
He sat up, or tried to.  The heavy blanket-like...thing...covering him held him down by some unseen force, like a hand gently pressing down.  Frustrated, Tony twisted his head from side to side to try to see his surroundings, but the blanket stuff--some gel-like pinkish substance that emitted a soft glow and looked like it should be sticky, but instead felt velvety soft and pleasantly warm--formed some kind of hood over his head, blocking his view.  He looked down towards the end of the table he was on and caught sight of a large window opened onto a smattering of stars around a sun that was instantly recognizable as not his own.
He remembered always knowing not to talk about it.  Keep it hidden.  He could still see the circus wallpaper border in the doctor’s office.  There had been a blue train with a smiling face pulling grinning, brightly colored animals in puffy-barred cages behind it.   Sometimes, he could feel the sticky thin sheet of paper covering the faux leather exam table rubbing against the backs of his thighs while the doctor talked in low tones to his mother, patting her gently on the shoulder.  Consoling, he knew now.
“He’s sure,” Matt interjected.
“Things are fine,” Tony replied noncommittally.
The man was probably right.  It was late.  Very late.  And he had been gone a while now. Or, he thought so, anyway.  It was hard to say how much time had passed, come to think of it.  No matter, really, his mother was probably terrified. He should go back and at least check on her and let her know he was alright.
Steve turned in surprise, finding Tony leaning against the wall behind the door, safely ensconced under the shadow of a parapet above while he watched the finger of darkness draw its dark path across the balcony.  He was dressed in finery again, this time a dark red coat shot through with gold over tan breeches and black leather boots.  The ever-present necklace hung in the middle of his chest.  In his hand, Tony held the handkerchief he had once offered to Steve that night on the road.  He was rubbing it between his fingers, almost idly, but Steve didn’t think Tony did much that was truly idle.
“First time for everything,” Tony responded tightly.  Coulson passed him a set of keys and before he knew it, he was watching the car depart down the winding dirt and gravel road that had brought them here.
“Yeah.  Sucks,” Rhodey added after a pause.
…when this whole place had been a prison, he had wanted to be able to see that bit of light through the keyhole.
makes time travel possible? Why not just call it Whatever the Plot Needs Matter?  Honestly,” Tony snorted, tossing his hands in the air.
“What?” Steve asked sharply, his gaze jerking up to Tony’s.  “Why?” Tony rolled his lip between his teeth and glanced away, then dragged his gaze back to Steve.
Tony turned away from the sink with a frown.  He gave the clock an accusatory look as he skirted the kitchen table and walked down the hall toward his bedroom.  As he approached the door to Steve’s room, he slowed.  It was slightly ajar, just enough for Tony to see the edge of Steve’s bed, with its perfectly smooth blue bedspread tucked neatly under a cream-colored pillow.
“I’m terrified. Of this.  Of you.  Of losing you or keeping you, but making you hate me, and I don’t know which one would be worse.  The stupid pillows, the food, the furniture, the damn island…I keep thinking if I just…just…give you enough, you won’t realize how little I have to give,” Tony confessed hissing out a low gulp of air that was almost a sob.  He wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck and pulling him closer as he carded fingers through Steve’s hair.  He bent a little, letting his head bow down and rest on Steve’s broad shoulder.
“Gonna have to start helping with the rent if you keep showing up,” Steve said without missing a beat. “What are you doing here, Tony?” he asked in the same weary tone from last night. He shrugged out of his jacket and hung it on a hook behind the door, then walked over to the kitchen and started putting what looked like leftovers from his lunch away. “I said I'd drop the papers by tomorrow. Matt's on his way over, we'll go over everything, get 'em signed. You really don't need to look over my shoulder.”
The path he stood on was narrow, but wide enough for a small cart to pass, Steve supposed, and though it did not appear particularly well-traveled, it was clearly distinguishable as a path. His eye followed it where it clung to the side of the mountain and curved around until it widened, just in front of a crumbling bridge dotted with six pillars that led to the castle.
“I got it, I got it,” Tony said, bending down and picking the pills up one by one while Steve stood ramrod straight above him.  Standing up, Tony grabbed the bottle out of the sink and dumped all but two from his palm into the container, then put the lid back on.
Steve was standing between them.  Tony almost couldn’t believe it, and, at the same time, had expected it. Of course, Steve was there.  He had promised.  Steve was also holding Howard about his head by the neck with one hand, letting Tony’s father dangle like a marionette.
“What did you have in mind?” Tony asked.
“Tony,” Steve cut in, rough and frustrated.  “That’s not what this is.”
He could hear the sounds of metal clanging, and the rush of air that he knew was the forge’s large bellows.  A muttered curse, and something in a low tone that Steve couldn’t quite parse, though he knew Tony was sometimes wont to speak to the parts of his forge as if they could hear him.  Steve felt a smile curve his lips, the first in a long time, and though his steps slowed, something in his chest lightened, lifted and was gone.  He had missed this.  Tony.  The swirl of energy around him.  The constant sense of being slightly off-balance, as if caught mid-fall.  The hum of activity.  The feeling that something, some happening, some incredible possibility that shouldn’t find footing was imminent, though he could never quite name what it was.
“So would you, Tony,” Widow replied.  “This is just all new to you.  Both of you.  And then this happens, when you should be just enjoying each other.  I get it, really.  At least as well as any Beta can.  Just don’t do anything stupid and mess this up.  You two…I don’t know if you could see it…but the two of you…you’re good together, Tony.  Don’t fuck this up.”
“Are you alright?” Captain Rhodes inquired.
“Please,” Steve moaned, tossing his head to the side and curling his right leg up around Tony’s thigh in a desperate bid to get closer.  Tony’s mouth left Steve’s skin and he hummed lowly, a brush of warm breath heating the spot he had been suckling, making Steve’s whole body quiver.
“Okay, first of all, they are, in fact, fruit-filled pastries that you toast. No, look, I’m just saying—“ Bruce protested.
“It’s not—this isn’t an ultimatum,” Tony cut in quickly.  “It’s not, Steve.  Rhodey doesn’t mean that.  He’s just worried.  He’s—he does that.  No one expects you to just up and…I mean, this is all a huge shock, I know.  I know it is.  Everything that’s happened.  All you’ve been through.  I get it, you can’t just up and turn your life on a dime. Rhodey’s just—he’s—he’s--“ Tony stammered.
“It is not that, Raj’Inama.  The King is not here.  He is in his office with General Rhodes,” the guard, Peran, Steve remembered, said, pointing down the hallway.
“Why?” Steve asked, the word coming out wounded, like a raw, scraping sound.
“Would you like that?” Tony asked again, harder this time, more insistent, the words going right to the tip of Steve’s cock with a throbbing pulse of heat.
“What will happen to them?” Steve asked, standing up and shuffling the folders into a neat stack in his hands as he headed for the door.
Steve stayed wrapped around Tony a beat longer, then pulled back and put some space between them.  His hands came up to cup the sides of Tony’s face, and he leaned down and pressed a gentle kiss to Tony’s cold lips.
“I know it makes you feel better,” Steve said, pulling Tony down to the bed.  “Though, I swear to God, if we go down to breakfast in the morning and Clint has that Butterball in a Baby Bjorn, I just might plug the rockets in myself.”
Not that he could blame Steve for responding when an Omega practically jumps him.  Who wouldn’t at least kiss back, right?  For a minute, anyway.  Before Steve stopped.  Right.  Because Steve had stopped.  That was the part Tony’s mind hadn’t wanted to remember, in the hazy midst of replaying over and over again the way Steve’s mouth felt, the touch of his hands, the way his eyes had roamed over Tony like a caress.  At least, that was how it had felt to Tony.  How much of that had he projected onto Steve?
“You know,” Steve said, leaning in closer. “We’d disappoint Bucky if we didn’t,” he said, gently nudging his lips at Tony’s.
Before, before, before, Tony mentally chanted.  Everything was before or after, and he hated that.  How this…this thing…had become some kind of line of demarcation for them.  Of course, Steve could draw him. Steve always drew him.  It wasn’t that he hadn’t
Steve took a deep breath.  “I just…please, Happy.  I just need to tell him…just, please.  I won’t…if he tells me to leave, then that’s it.  I won’t bother him, I swear.”
Steve wasn’t sure how long he floated there, his vision dark and blank as he tried to focus on the ceiling, tried to find some thread of control. “Tony…you…I…that…” Steve stuttered, thoughts jumbled around overwhelming feelings still coursing through his body in gasping shudders.
Steve looked away, his eye catching on the doors, where the silent guards stood in shadows so deep he could only make out the play of the fire on their armor in long, glowing threads.  On the other side of the doors, there was a whole world he hated.  Or, thought he did.  Were they all terrible, like Zola and Hammer and that Stane person?  Would Tony really choose to surround himself with such people?  It was like trying to read a book with half of the page missing.  He looked back at Tony, finding his expression soft and almost sad, as if the melancholy he accused of Steve had found a new home.  In here, the book was so easy to read, to enjoy, to let the story play out.  But, in here was not real.
“You really don’t know, do you?”  Tony asked.  “Did Barnes and the others think I was just going to throw my hands up in the air when they chased Pepper off?”
“Steve,” Tony said with a long-suffering sigh.  “Please shut up.”
Steve felt a second finger slide into him, and it felt, for a moment, like he was being torn apart. Then the splintering feeling settled into his chest, and his hole gave way as Tony thrust his fingers in and out and peppered kisses over Steve’s back and shoulders and down the curve of his arms where they strained behind him.
Steve’s dog tags were curled up on the dresser next to the lamp where Tony had tossed them aside last night.  He’d stopped wearing them when he got up to the cabin, figuring why bother, until a few days in, he’d found himself talking to squirrels and fingering the place on his neck where a cool weight should be.  He should probably give them back now.  No point.  Not up here.
“I can’t believe you named it that,” Rhodey said.
“No way. You got yourself into this.  You deal with…whatever that is,” Rhodey replied.
“So…a bit of naval gossip is what it takes to excite you, huh?  Sorry, Shellhead, that’s all I know. Sam’s the one with all the news,” Steve said, feeling a pang of regret as he caught Shellhead’s crestfallen expression.  “Last I can recall that he mentioned anything about it, the
Of course, Steve couldn’t understand any of that.  Not that he would have a good answer, even if he did. The truth was, they hadn’t had many good hunts lately because Tyber wasn’t a particularly good hunter, but insisted on leading the hunting party anyway, and the fish weren’t gone, just faster and more clever than Tyber, but Anto suspected that blaming the Other in their midst was a lot easier than admitting to those failings, though he knew, without quite knowing how he knew, that what Tyber was really upset about was that Anto had not been himself lately, and he blamed Steve for this.  Which…wasn’t entirely wrong, though Anto couldn’t let Tyber know that, not if he wanted to get Steve out of here alive.
Tony breathed out a deep, husky sigh, then brought a hand up to cup the back of Steve’s neck, fingers rubbing lightly over the skin there. Steve let his mouth work a path up the line of Tony’s throat and across his jaw until he found Tony’s mouth, then trailed the tip of his tongue over Tony’s bottom lip, capturing the shaky breath that escaped Tony’s lips as he did. He opened his mouth over Tony’s and bringing one hand up to angle Tony’s head, keeping the other curled around Tony’s hip. He pressed them forward on shuffling feet, easing Tony back towards the large bed at the center of his room until the back of Tony’s thighs touched the mattress.
He had caught Tony’s eye in the mirror then, Steve remembered as the carriage rolled on.  He hadn’t known what he wanted to say.  Everything. Nothing. His thoughts had been a knotted jumble and a smooth plain at the same time.  If he tried to pluck a thread loose, it disappeared, floated away into nothingness, but the urge to say something was there, gnawing at him.
“Of course, Captain.  Sir’s message sounded unusually concerned. He seemed far more interested in the removal of these videos than of others, which should also be removed from the public purview, if I may say so,” JARVIS added.
“Yes, you can have the first question, Christine, I already told you that,” Pepper was saying into her phone.  She waved at him, shook her head and looked skyward.  “No.  One question.  Not one question in three parts.  This is a personal matter, and Mr. Stark is doing you all the courtesy of addressing the interest and putting a stop to the rumor mill.  That’s it.”  She shook her head at Tony, then headed for the balcony where Tony could still hear her raised voice through the French doors.
“Maybe he grew a conscience.  Anything’s possible. Even in the Army,” Rhodey replied with the natural disdain held by Air Force jocks for what Rhodey happily referred to as the branch filled with those who Aren’t Ready for the Marines Yet.  “You need me to come over?  I’m coming over.”
“I always liked you in red,” Steve reminded him with a slight shrug.
“That he’s on his way. That no one is going to say anything about you missing class,” Rhodey told him.
“I—no--I,” Steve stammered.  “Nothing, really.  Nothing serious. I couldn’t have earned a living at it, that’s for sure.  Probably would have stayed with the army,” he shrugged.  “Or fished, I don’t know.  I never had the patience for that, to tell you the truth.  They were offering plots of the land taken from Hydra, though it was far from fertile soil,” Steve said.
“Steve’s here,” Tony said, admittedly, somewhat gleefully.  Steve was here.  Steve would be here, with him, in just a few minutes, and this would be over.  Because Steve would make it over.  Tony would tell him it was fine, and please don’t hurt the just-doing-their-jobs-officers, and Steve would sigh, and gnash his teeth, but he would do it, because Tony asked it of him.
“I heard that,” Dave said.
The sun warmed his face as it dappled through the trees.  He could almost feel the tension leeching out of his muscles as he sat there, listening to the scrape of the pencil, the birds, the wind in the trees.  He sat like that for a while, occasionally taking a bite, while the familiar scratching sound of Steve’s charcoal over the thick paper.  It was comforting.  That sound.  Steve drawing meant good things.  He had learned that up here, too.  He draws when he’s happy.  He draws what he loves, Tony thought, with a small smile.  This was okay.  He could do this.  This was
“And I’m back to the land of the not-hormonally challenged,” Tony said, reaching for the helmet where he’d set it down on the bed.
People were asking about the picture that inspired this fic, so here you go
Conference Room B was one of those that was set up with a long table for meetings.  Steve wasn’t sure anyone ever actually had meetings in here, but it had that ubiquitous blandness that most conference rooms carried.  Black leather chairs circled an oblong table. A credenza to one side held a number of canned drinks, a single-cup coffee maker that made the same terrible, watered down brew as the one in Steve’s room, except in flavors that Steve was fairly sure did nothing to improve the taste, and bottled water chilling in a bucket of ice.  A bank of tall windows took up the entire far wall. The view was nice enough, though everything sort of faded to striations of tan in the distance. It was too bright in the room, like everywhere else. The lightbulbs are different now, Steve reminded himself, though he didn’t think that was really what it was.
“I believe I warned you once that you should not lie to me, did I not?” Tony asked.  His voice was still light, almost nonchalant, but there was something darker that moved underneath the words, something that set Steve’s cock to pulsing and straining, and made air suddenly difficult to come by.
Steve leaned back in his cramped seat and indulged himself by playing out the fantasy in his head, imagining what that would feel like to have someone--okay, in his head, Tony because he couldn’t seem to think about anything other than him--show up and fling an offer like the one Tony made back in the face of whoever dared to suggest it.  To have someone say, he’s with me, and
, because he’s like that—”
“Welcome back, Mister Rogers.  Sir is in his workshop and will be up momentarily.  He asked that I advise you that breakfast is waiting for you on the balcony,” Jarvis responded.  Steve could almost swear the AI sounded pleased, which was both amazing and unsettling.
“Is that…something that…you would like?” Steve questioned in a halting tone.
Oh.  There was a joke in there somewhere, truth and lies all twisted up together, something Steve didn’t get.  That happened a lot these days, though he was better now at playing it off. Still, it stung, sharp and brutal, somewhere in his chest where a star was supposed to be to hear it from Tony.
(See the end of the chapter for
And he promised not to hurt Tony, like he honestly meant it, and that sounded so different from why do you make me do this. Maybe they weren't really different, he didn't know, but he wanted to believe they were, that there was a space where this difference existed and maybe, just maybe, Steve lived in that space, and would let Tony live there, too.
“No. No, I’m—I’m just…I’m…” Steve trailed off.  “We’ve been preparing for this. Who’s we?”
“Simple.  But…not.  Not really.  I like it,” Steve said.  “I’ll take good care of it, I promise.  Won’t lose it or anything.”  He was looking down at the ring, but made no move to put it on.  Instead, Tony watched him look off to the side, brow furrowing, mouth downturned like he was trying to hold back a frown.
He held Tony’s gaze until the other man looked away, his mouth curling. “Couldn’t I? You don’t know that. The things I must do, the choices I have to make… you don’t know--”
?  As in Bucky Barnes. From…but, I mean you—holy fuck, you…
“When we get back to the Tower, I’m ordering the entire menu from Gianetti’s,” Tony vowed, staring balefully at the plastic spoon full of what purported to be beef stew.
And the bed.
“A tree is just a large plant,” Tony pointed out. Steve hunched over his food, shoulders shaking with mirth.
“Two boys,” Charles said proudly.  “Here,” he said, pulling a small wallet out of his breast pocket and unfolding a plastic sleeve of photos.  “That’s Oliver.  He’s a lawyer in San Francisco.  Three kids, and now, Emma, our great-grand-daughter.  And that one, that’s Benjamin.  Benji,” Charles said, his tone shifting a bit as he rubbed a finger over the plastic next to where the younger of the boys grinned at the camera with a gap-toothed smile.  “He died in Vietnam in ’68.”
“So, there’s this little place a few blocks from here, makes a great cappuccino,” Steve suggested.  “Oh, hang on, I’ve got to call my friend,” he said quickly, pulling his phone out of his pocket and dialing Bucky’s number.  It rang once, then again.  Steve frowned over at Tony.  “It’s ringing.”
“Because you know all about straight answers, right?  You dangle just enough of this plan of yours in front of me to where you know I’ll feel obligated to go along with it, but you’re not exactly telling me everything, either,” Steve snapped back.
Tony sighed, stuck the picture in its place, and put the book back in the nightstand drawer.  He hugged the pillow to his face and drew in a deep breath.  Soap.  The green marbled kind that Steve thought might have been a joke. A hint of musk and
No shit, Neil, Tony thought, snapping the faceplate down and stepping out onto the gravel driveway as the HUD activated in front of him. Steve turned as Tony approached, the HUD zooming in on his expression.  Eyes bright, soft, crinkled at the edges, the way Tony liked.  A smile tugging at his lips.  Hands at his waist, head tilted back.  Captain America pose, Tony thought with a surge of pride.  He activated the repulsors and went airborne, just high enough to soar above Steve for a moment before dropping back down to the deck with a practiced thud.
“Sure.  Sure, I—yeah, I can do that,” Tony said with an eager nod. Steve was hungry.  Of course, he was hungry.  Steve was always hungry.  Well, this, Tony could do.  He probably should’ve thought of that earlier.  Making sure his Alpha ate.  Another thing he’d forgotten.  He’d do better, though.  He’d make Steve the best God-damned plate of defrosted finger food he could find.
Tony unbuttoned his shirt to the middle and pulled it apart enough to see the curve of the reactor sitting in the center of his chest.  A webbed map of raised lines branched outward, faded now, but still there.  He wondered if that was why the skin always felt tighter, because it was pulled together into scars.  He sucked in a breath that went down cold and drew his eyes back to the mirror.  Steve had asked, of course.  He hadn’t pressed, but he’d asked.  Did they touch you?  Not like that, Tony assured him, wrapped safe in Steve’s arms, when it had all seemed further away than it did when he was alone.  I had my pills with me.  Don’t worry.  They wanted me to work. To build.
“In my defense, I was very drunk,” Rhodey reminded him, mouth flattening into a grimace.
“Always was for me,” Steve remarked, lifting one of Tony’s hands to his mouth, then placing a light kiss against the inside of Tony’s wrist, just below where his watch ticked as the second hand made its way around the undulating surface of the dial, sending a shiver lancing up Tony’s spine.  He had many other watches now, but he always wore this one to the cabin.  The cabin, in a strange way, kept its own time. He turned and wrapped his arms around Steve’s waist, digging his fingers into the back pockets of Steve’s jeans and giving them a little tug, pulling Steve’s hips flush against his belly.
Steve shook his head, grimacing a bit at the motion, and chanced a look over the man’s shoulders, though the road remained just as empty as before.  No one was racing after him.  No one was shouting for him to get back home and take it like a man instead of the useless, misbegotten thing he’d gotten as a son.  No one was promising it would be worse if he didn’t.
A deep, dark, impenetrable hurt. It hurt because it happened.  Because this was something that had happened to him now, and he couldn’t make that ever entirely go away.
Bucky was shaking his head.  “Not because I’m all against it, you know.  I mean, I know Clint does it.  And, hey, consenting adults and all that.  I’m not one to talk.”
Steve blinked at him, like he was trying to process the onslaught of words, then set the duffel and pouch down next to the back of the sofa. Well, nothing for it now, Tony supposed, feeling his shoulders and back stiffen, bracing himself for whatever was to come.
“Not to me,” Tony insisted.
“No,” Tony replied with a shrug. Natasha walked over and dropped a bag on the blanket between Steve and Tony, then set about unrolling her own blanket on the opposite side of the fire while Tony murmured his thanks.
The lamps rocked slowly as the tent was buffeted by a gust of wind. Steve watched the shadows dance, rolling his lip between his teeth and trying to tear his thoughts from ones that felt too grim to ponder. How could he love a man who would consider attacking his home? His people? Peggy, Natasha, Clint, Sam, the twins… how could he feel this way about someone who would even think of such a thing?
One finger traced little swirling circles across Steve’s chest, just below the pert, pink nipples.  Tony stretched up, darted his tongue out, and licked a half-moon at the edge of darkened skin, where it puckered and thickened around the nub.  He heard Steve grunt and looked up. What he saw made him grin, coyly this time, then he craned his neck up and took the nipple in his teeth, rolling his tongue over the tip before letting it pop out into the cool air.  Underneath him, Steve’s whole body shuddered.
“I’ve given the men leave to eat and rest for the night,” Captain Rhodes announced as Steve walked up to the small circle of figures just outside the Sept. Tony grunted in agreement, wiping a hand over the sweat and dirt that gathered along the back of his neck.  Steve himself was itchy with heat and the salty sting of the beach sand.
Tony could see the blow coming.  The way Howard’s body tensed just before the movement.  He felt the rush of air against the side of his face and braced, muscles tightening even as his stomach loosened.  It was better not to, but he couldn’t help it.  Howard wore a class ring on his hand.  It would leave a scar.  A thin one.  Jagged at the edges.
Then, Tony was shifting under him, and he felt Tony’s cock slide out, still hard and full.  An awful, burning humiliation broke open inside him, making his stomach clench and loosen like it was a fist opening and closing.  Tony hadn’t come, and he had, and this was…it was terrible, though he couldn’t explain why.  Tony moved to Steve’s side, tipped his hand under Steve’s chin and gently pulled Steve’s head to look at him.
Steve turned and headed for the door labeled 3C, with its paint peeling and the C slightly off-center, where one of the nails had come out and not been replaced.  He knocked and waited, then knocked again, louder this time.
kingdom, and she will make the most
Exactly how often over the past few months he found himself thinking about that whole experience now that there was some distance to it and now that he knew Steve so much better was not something he really wanted to contemplate. Certainly not out loud.
“Did we not just do that?” Steve asked.
.  Don’t use me.  Not
him about it, and God, that difference was everything.
“I'm telling you what the records show, Tony,” Rhodey said gently, but there wasn't any room for equivocation in his voice. “You think he's some tax shelter mastermind who hid all that offshore? Come on. It isn't there.”
“Pretty sure we’re at least one knife short of a full set,” Steve commented over Tony’s shoulder.  Tony swiveled his head around with a gleeful smirk at that, but Steve just gave him a strange, oddly tight look and slipped his arm from Tony’s grasp.  Steve turned away from them and braced his hands on the rounded edges of the craps table.  He didn’t look back again, which bothered Tony for some reason.  Probably because he’d spent the past day or so watching Steve catch everything head-on, and this was new.  Whatever it was, Tony found he didn’t like it. At all.
people…if this was the price to avoid that, then he would pay it.
Steve wasn’t sure which one of them moved first.  Probably him.  He missed the contact with Tony’s skin, and so found himself reaching for Tony’s waist, grabbing the jut of bones just above the Speedo, his head dipping down to capture Tony’s mouth again.  Tony’s lips curved into a smile under his, his tongue swiping at the seam of Steve’s lips, seeking an entry that Steve gladly gave. Locked like that, they stumbled towards the interior of the suite, hands grappling over each other’s skin, feet occasionally tangling, but somehow, they managed.  Steve could feel Tony’s rough laugh against his mouth as Steve’s hip bumped the side of a table and almost knocked what was probably a priceless lamp to the floor.
“He has an amazing collection,” Steve said, dragging his gaze from the arching hall down to where Museum Guy was still pumping Tony’s hand in gratitude.  “Some of the new stuff is a bit over my head though.”
“I do try,” Tony said after a long pause in which Steve thought he had fallen asleep.  “It’s just never enough.  Or not the right kind of enough.”
“Your middle name is Fight Me, isn’t it?” Tony asked with half a smile.
“That’s different,” Tony responded stiffly.  “Need I remind you that you were the one who counseled your concern about his knowledge of our defenses.  Is that not even more true, if you are right?”
Steve winced a little as Peggy’s voice rang in his head, as clear there at the end as when she had been younger.  It had been hard, that last year or so, when her mind took her so often back to the War.  Harder still, because she talked of things that Steve didn’t want to be reminded of, let alone talk about.
“I’m going to nail Obie to the wall, I swear to God,” Tony ground out.
Steve shook his head and shifted forward, climbing onto the bed so that Tony had to scoot back, until his knees were braced on each side of Tony’s thighs.  He bent his neck and nudged his mouth lightly across Tony’s, tasting his lips, catching his breath, feeling the hint of the heat behind it. He circled his hips, stretching his hands up over his head and letting his thighs do the work, then ground down against Tony’s lap.  He could feel Tony’s erection pressing up against his own through Tony’s trousers, and God, didn’t that friction feel amazing? He moaned and thrust a bit, enjoying the sensation of the rough fabric of Tony’s pants against his sensitive length.
“Will do,” Tony rushed out, running a hand through his hair.  “Anything else?”
Except for the outer package, Steve wasn’t anything like the kind of person Tony usually went for, but then again, his batting average there was pretty dismal.
while Tony—Tony
“Ms. Potts just acquired that particular piece,” JARVIS reminded him.  “She felt it was a good representation of his Springs period.”
“I didn’t want to like you,” Steve said again.   “But, I did.  You made me laugh.  You made me think.  You made me remember what it was like to—to be someone I haven’t been in a long time.   I didn’t know what to do with that.  I wasn’t supposed to want to be with you.  You were supposed to be this—this monster, and I would get through it, for Cam, I suppose, and then, eventually, I wouldn’t get through it, and this would all stop.  The ocean was supposed to take me, you see.  I wasn’t supposed to be the one who lived.  What was the point?  I had nothing to return to, no one waiting on me, no life ahead to live, just the next fight.  And then the next.  So, this?  All of this?  It didn’t matter.  Not really.  None of this was supposed to matter.
“Thanks, Tony,” Steve said drolly, but let Tony pat him dry as best he could.  Tony grabbed his robe off the hook and put that on, while Steve insisted, rather impractically in Tony’s opinion, on putting his shirt and underwear back on.  All that wasted effort, Tony thought sadly.
“Thank you,” Steve said, smiling down at his screen.  That warm feeling was curling back in his stomach, low in his belly, settling there like it knew its place now.
“Here,” his mother said, handing him a tiny crystal goblet brimming with a dark golden liquid.  Liquid luck, Tony thought.  For her, anyway.  “Drink.  Or don’t.  I know you hate it.”
“That’s…not what that means,” Steve said through gritted teeth.
“Why not?” Stark asked.
“Oh, don’t worry,” the man chuckled, drawing Steve’s eyes back to his face.  “Nothing out here tonight except you and I, I should think.”
“Yeah, it’s the first one. Or the fourth, depending.  Can’t believe you haven’t seen Star Wars,” Tony said.
“Yeah,” Steve said after a beat of silence.  “That happens.”
“If you don’t get up here and communicate some, I’m going to communicate with myself,” Tony warned, a grin in his voice.
Would it make it harder or easier to look back on this time, Steve wondered, then shoved the thought away.  It would come to pass, however it happened, and this would end, either in his escape or his death, because he wouldn’t come back and put Tony in a position of having to pass sentence on him.  He couldn’t do that.  They had this, this time, just for the two of them, and here, now, he could give everything of himself.  Him. Steve Rogers. That was who Tony wanted.  Not someone behind a mask.  Just Steve. Steve was enough.  And Tony was…more than everything.  So much more.  He didn’t know how to say it, and then he did.
“You’re gonna catch flies like that,” Steve grinned and pushed himself off the shower’s walls and back under the spray, shooting Tony a somewhat sheepish look under his lashes that was apparently basically Tony-Kryptonite, because he found himself pulling the robe off and stepping into the shower after Steve.
Okay. Well.  Steve didn’t know what to do with that.  It still didn’t sit right with him.  After all, he’d been the one to ditch Mr. Hammer.  Tony’d had nothing to do with that, though he found that he was glad he hadn’t said anything to Tony about why he’d been so eager to leave Hammer behind.
“Come,” a muffled voice called out from behind the door.  Steve pushed open the door and walked into the dimly lit room, eyes landing on the large wooden bed, bedecked with heavy curtains that dominated the chamber, before he managed to tear his gaze away and take in the rest of the room.   Which was when everything stopped making sense.
“Pierce,” Steve guessed.
“And how do you know?” Jarvis asked, arching his brows.
“Maybe he’s smart enough not to leave the surround of his Knights and get himself killed,” Steve countered.
“That’s it? No comment on...on the other thing?” Steve asked, leaning out of the elevator as she turned to walk away.
“Fine.  Go get in bed and spread yourself for me.  You may show me how much you
So maybe not, he thought dully, the familiar hot flash of annoyance that he could now, at least, recognize as something else entirely, running through him.  At one time, maybe he could have.  He liked to think that, anyway, probably better for his psyche.  But now, after coming so close to everything, the idea of having part of Steve, but not all of him, made something sour and bitter curl in Tony’s stomach, tightening like a vise around his chest until he couldn’t breathe.  He was familiar enough with panic to recognize it at this point.
Pepper, Rhodey, Matt…and now this poor schmuck involved, and it was entirely possible the whole thing was going to collapse from underneath him if he wasn’t careful.  Because Obie was smart, and Obie was mean, but above all, Obie was fucking
, truly seen, that was both terrifying and exhilarating.
“Ahem,” a voice coughed in the amplified way that said it was over a speaker.  Steve tore his mouth away from Tony’s and looked away with a frustrated snort of air, one hand still holding the back of Tony’s head.  “I feel that I should remind you that there are cameras at several points in this room,” the voice, which Tony’s addled brain finally recognized as Coulson, told them.
“So, she kept saying this, over and over for years. Years!  And I was absolutely convinced she had this List of Stupid Things Steve Has Done, because whenever I did something, like try to fit down the garbage chute because Bucky said I couldn’t—which, I could, let’s be clear on that up front—she’d say, ‘On the List of Stupid Things You’ve Done, this goes right to the top, mister!’ so I just figured that she kept having to erase that damn number one position on the list,” Steve said around another bout of shared laughter.
Would it really never be like that again, Steve wondered?  Not the—the sex…
“Oh, no.  No, I don’t—I mean, not until they need me,” Steve answered, which made no sense.  So, he was just, what?  Some kind of on-call agent?  “I thought I’d work on the cabin a bit.  Not the power.  Promise,” Steve said quickly when Tony started to open his mouth to object.  “Maybe head into town and pick up a few things.  If there’s anything you want, just, uh, here,” Steve continued, pulling open a drawer and taking out a pad of paper and pen.  “Just write it down.  I’ll see what I can find.”
“Coulson,” the slightly less enormous one with the short hair and rough, gravelly voice said.
“Why are you here, Tony?” Steve asked again, standing up.  Tony stood up, too, brushing past Steve and walking over to the bed.   A candle burned on the table next to it, and as Steve watched, Tony passed a hand over the flame.  Held his palm there for a beat, then flexed it and let his hand drop to his side.
“Tony, you don’t need to do that, really,” Steve protested at the same time. “It’s fine.  Bucky’s fine, we can come by tomorrow—"
“What are you doing?” Steve hissed out under his breath.
“No, no problem. I mean, it’s fine. I just had to make a couple of calls,” Steve replied, trying to read something in the man’s expression, but the assessing look had dropped off his face almost as soon as Steve turned around.   “My friend is going to bring some stuff by, if that’s okay. I told her not to talk to anyone. Honestly, if anyone from the press did try to talk to her, they’d probably be spilling their own life story in no time. Nat’s got, well, a way with people.”
Steve nodded once, jerkily, but that seemed to satisfy Cam as far as a response went.  Luckily, the boy was largely content with his own conversation.
Lightning flashed behind the man, briefly casting him in a bright, pale light that made his visage appear almost skeletal against the darkness, and Steve took an involuntary step back.  A sense of anticipation bristling the air that had nothing to do with the storm.  Someone’s walking over your grave, he thought, his mother’s words coming to him more clearly than they had in years, he realized with a shiver.  The grave was closer now, the dirt fresh and turned.  Waiting.  The man was waiting, too.  It should have meant, the man was waiting in the doorway, waiting for Steve to invite him in, because, obviously, he was. But, that wasn’t quite what the thought meant when he thought it.  The man was
“Well, you have good taste,” Tony grinned.  He stepped forward until their chests were touching again and ran his hands over Steve’s chest, palms grazing gently over Steve’s nipples, though as sensitive as they were, Steve couldn’t help sucking in a sharp breath.  Tony gave him a look, then repeated the motion, humming lightly as he did.  “You’ve talent, too.  Raw, perhaps, but there.  Biased as I might be, I am not wrong. Pepper was quite impressed, in fact, and she is far more knowledgeable about art than I am, or so she tells me, and as I make it a point never to argue with her,” Tony said with a small shrug.  “I’ll send for a tutor.  One of the Enclaves will be delighted to spare one of its instructors for the Royal household.”
times. Remember when we were enjoying a respite from university, and you spent all your coin trying to catch the eye of the famous Lady of a Thousand Pleasures?  What was his name? Ivan? Evan?  You never told me if his tongue was truly a gift of the gods.  It said so, right on that sign above the door, but--”
It took Steve a second to realize he’d answered a question without realizing what was being asked.  He might have tried to say something, object, ninety-eight, not dead, something, but Tony’s other hand came down to lift Steve’s balls, giving them a sharp tug, then massaging gently for a moment like an apology, before deft fingers moved behind them and rubbed against the thin, sensitive skin there.  Steve forgot anything that wasn’t the searing jolt of pleasure that slammed into him.  He hissed out a breath, and let his head tip back, throat working around sounds that couldn’t quite seem to form.  He was so hard, he ached with it, and wanted to ask Tony to move his hand, do something, anything, but it was better somehow if he didn’t ask, if he just let Tony do what he wanted, so he kept quiet.
“Because you mocked my boring toaster and needed to be punished,” Tony said around a yawn.
“This Omega is called Anto, who is not mated, healer of the Clan of the Cave Bear, adopted son of Maara, who was also healer, who is the child of Amma, who was mated to Ute, and Jhrvis, who is mog-ur and Mog-Ur, who is child of Isa, who was mated to Lhar,” Anto told him in the Clan language.
“We—we can’t,” Steve panted, breaking off the kiss.
Tony shivered, skin prickling, and slowly closed his eyes.  Heat pooled low in his stomach, a tight, pulling sensation pulsing through his groin to the tip of his cock.  Shit, he thought, flopping over on his back.  He watched the ceiling fan rotate over his head, around and around without end.   My Alpha pushed an R8 off a cliff because I was jealous.  I feel like we should be talking about this more, Tony thought with a nervous rush of hysterical laughter that made him turn his head into his pillow to quash it.  SHIELD did something to him.  No sense in pretending any of this was normal.  Not anymore.  He had an empty garage where plausible deniability used to be parked.  SHIELD did something to Steve, and when it went sideways, they had their little rose ceremony of Omegas for him and for some reason, he picked Tony.
So, you know, your basic chores.
“Ready to get your gameface on, then?” Tony asked, turning and leaning a hip against the balcony and one elbow on top of the railing, all practiced nonchalance.
“No, no. I mean, uh, fishing’s fine.  I guess.  I haven’t actually
They got him into the wagon, next to the other two slaves and ran the length of chain through his collar.  His arms and legs were still bound, but at least he was sitting.  He leaned his head back and stared up at the sky.  Puffy, white clouds that shifted in and out of shapes floated above.  He looked over at the other slaves, who eyed him warily and dropped their gazes.  Smart, he thought, swallowing back the surge of regret.  Better that way.
not saying it. I’m saying, you know how people are.  Don’t get all pissed at me, Cap,” Fury said, dipping his chin down and giving Steve a long look.  “This could’ve been avoided, and you know it.  You got an unclaimed Omega walking around a room full of un-Bonded Alphas,” Fury continued.
The Shadowman will get you if you don’t watch out, Steve thought, a chill coiling around his spine, making his blood run so cold, he thought his breath might come out in white puffs.  He made the sign of the cross almost unconsciously, watching Tony’s lips twitch up--his lips, his red, red lips, red like...
“No, I’m not okay. I’m ten seconds from being tied to a chair in some meatpacking warehouse, probably down by Sunset Park—oh, nice, with the looks of surprise there.  You two aren’t exactly criminal masterminds, you know,” Tony scoffed, shaking his head and scowling at the two boys currently trying to make themselves invisible in the office’s corner.  “Will someone please just tell me what the hell is going on?  Because I have to tell you, I’m starting to come to my own conclusions here, and they aren’t good.  Where’s St—Cap?  God. That’s ridiculous. I’m not calling him that.   Give me my phone. Who has my phone?  Bonnie, you still got it, or did you give it to Clyde there?”  Tony asked, holding out his hand and making a give-it gesture.  The young man held it out, and started forward, but Barnes gave a sharp whistle, bringing him up short.
,” Anthony said from somewhere in the back of Steve’s mind.
Tony seemed unsurprised by the gesture, Steve noticed. He remembered Tony’s words from the morning, which he had discarded as teasing.
Steve didn’t comment on that observation, but his stomach gurgled at the mention of food, and, as the nervousness slipped away, he remembered how ravenous he was.
Steve cleared his throat as the first participants took the field and shifted a little in his seat.  The chains swayed against his chest and cock, not hard enough to do anything, but that in and of itself was frustrating beyond belief, like he was reaching for something and his fingers could only brush it, never actually grasp what he wanted. Tony looked down at his motion, frowned a bit, then huffed out a low chuckle, and his face warmed into a soft, knowing smile.  He lifted his hand from under Steve’s and stroked it over the back of Steve’s head through the veil, resting against the curve of Steve’s neck as the tourney got underway.
And really, the sooner he got Steve to the island, the sooner he could explain all of this. “JARVIS, where are we on the island purchase?” Tony asked, getting silence in reply.
He dropped his head, a huff of air slowly releasing as he stared down at his hand gripping the doorknob, like he was on a precipice, hanging on so he wouldn’t go over the edge.  “Brock,” Steve began, craning his head around to stare at the man he was maybe just now realizing he had never truly known.
Tony was always beautiful, anyway.
“I’ve no doubt of that,” Tony said gently, placing a hand on the boy’s head.  “She is well settled, then? Her room is to her liking?”
Steve was frowning, looking anywhere but at Tony, though his gaze couldn’t seem to quite find a place to land, like actually focusing on something required too much effort.  Steve opened his mouth as if to say something, then promptly closed it again, looking down at his shoes, a dark frown marring his features.
“So…so, at work today, Bucky, my friend Bucky, he welded a man into a toilet,” Steve said, smiling at the memory.
“Bruce’s attempt at a cure for--what was it, constipation?--anyway, it caused the unfortunate side effect of him rampaging through a perfectly good village up Lord Turnbury’s way,” Tony explained, though Steve could hear the amusement in his voice under the rebuke.  “Do you always test your concoctions on yourself? Hmmm. Of course, you do. No wonder you and Steve get along so well. You two should have much to talk about, what with your distressingly similar self-preservation instincts. Did a holy man and a glowing rock portend a great destiny for you, as well, by chance?” Tony asked, raising his eyebrows as he glanced again back at Steve.
The deep pit of humiliation opened up again every time he thought about it.  Why had he expected anything else?  It wasn’t like he hadn’t known what he was getting himself into.  He’d just chosen to pretend it wasn’t what it was because that was easier than accepting the truth.  Deceiving himself was not something he was usually so willing to do, and it frustrated him to no end that he’d let himself get so deeply entangled here when he should have known better, even had Bucky pointing the whole sordid thing out to him and still let himself believe there was more to it.
“For him, yes,” Michael replied.  “For me…well, my parents, God rest their souls, were both lawyers, and each time I Bonded, they made sure everything was in order.  So, now, I am left with my memories, my mutual funds and my stock options, all held in trust, of course.  I’ll let you decide which one is most dear to my heart.  Would you quit fidgeting?  Honestly, you’re just making it worse,” Michael said, swiveling his head around to Josh and poking a finger in the younger man’s direction.  “Someone was naughty last night,” he announced to the group.  Tony cast a quick glance at Josh, who shifted again in his seat, caught Tony’s eye and cupped a hand over his groin and pushed the fabric of his pants taut so it outlined the metal cage.  Oh.
There was no tinge of regret tied to it, no slithery hope that he could slip away unnoticed, no burnt out edges where self-loathing had been momentarily scored away by heat and feeling.  Instead, his mind was filled with hazy images of Steve, all golden in the lamplight last night as he moved with the music, like something out of a fantasy. Beautiful, worshipful, wonderful Steve.  Apparently, there was a difference in sleeping with someone and sleeping with someone you cared about, go figure. They should write a song about that or something, Tony thought with a mental huff.
“So…if he can’t get rid of Bucky, what does he do?” Tony asked casually, twirling a spiral of noodles onto his fork.
So, that was where they would send Steve.  Or,
“We all did three per person,” Natasha replied. She had a plastic tourniquet binding Steve’s upper arm just above where Bruce was probing at the veins that webbed beneath Steve’s skin.  “He hasn’t needed any.”
“In there?” Jarvis said, reaching over and holding the Walkman up to his face.  “Fascinating. Reminds me a bit of that Vita Ray Detector.  Do you remember that? What ever happened to it, I wonder,” Jarvis mused, his words startling Steve into a frown.
“Mr. Stark left this morning for New York.  Business.  You understand how it is,” she said.
Big thank you to tastes-like-coconut for the beta, as always!  Follow her on tumblr for some wonderful art.
He finally cut the water off and stepped out, wrapping a towel from the rack around his hips and using a smaller one to rub the excess water from his face and hair.  Swiping a hand over the glass to clear the condensation, he stared at his reflection in the mirror for a long moment, studying his face and deciding it was probably a good idea to shave.  A few days’ growth of stubble had resolutely appeared along his chin and jaw in awkward spikes of various sizes.  He thought it might not look bad if he let it grow in, but right now, it just looked like Dr. Seuss drew on his face with a fine-pointed sharpie.
Steve’s smile grew, and he stood up, then picked up the frame that sat on top of Tony’s workstation, since this was where he spent most of his time if he was away from Steve.  He stared down at the scrawl of words on the back of a check for a million dollars for a long moment before setting it back down next to the other pictures that littered Tony’s desk.  Him and Steve at various events, on trips, and one of them at Steve’s graduation from art school with Steve in bright blue robes and Tony beaming proudly next to him.
“Like a champ,” Steve said with a grimace.
“I’m enjoying the view too much to deprive myself of it just yet,” Tony replied with a grin.
Defendant is hereby ordered not to abuse Complainant by physically harming, attempting to physically harm or placing Complainant in fear of imminent physical harm, and to stop harassing Complainant by any willful and malicious conduct aimed at Complainant and intended to cause fear, intimidation, abuse or damage to property.
“Yeah?” Tony asked without opening his eyes.
“I’ll get the car going, Mr. Jarvis.  See if I can find the ball game.  You take your time,” Happy said, pulling the keyfob from his pocket and heading for the car.
“Uh, that’s not true,” Tony corrected.
“Tony…you’re happy.   You’re just…happy.  This…Tony, this is what happiness feels like,” Bruce explained, voice sounding a little sad at that.  Tony blinked at him.  He turned when he heard footfalls on the steps.  Steve tromped into the kitchen in grey lounge pants, stopped next to Tony to place a quick kiss on his lips before grabbing an Iron Man mug off of the shelf and pouring himself a cup of coffee.  Tony just stared, his own coffee mug forgotten halfway to his mouth.
“Ah.  I see,” Rogers said, shifting a bit in his seat, shoulders hunching like he was trying to make himself smaller, which was, let’s face it, a physical impossibility as far as Tony could tell.  “So, this, ah.  This whole thing isn’t really your idea, I take it?”
He was six the first time he saw it.
“Which people are going to say this about Tony?” Steve asked, giving Fury a long, challenging look, until Fury looked away, pursing his lips in displeasure.  “Tony wasn’t doing anything wrong, and you know it.  That…man should never have put Tony in the position of having to be the one to leave or call for help.  Stone knew what he was doing when he went out there.”
“You had to make it weird,” Rhodey said with a slight shake of his head.  “Come on.  Barnes is probably going to rip me a new one when he finds out about this.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Probably been faster with the rest of me,” Tony said dully.  “Look, I’m not really ‘on the clock,’ so to speak, so if you’re looking for something like before, I can give you a couple of referrals or whatever.  You like brunets or just easier to paint?” Tony asked with a flippancy that was belied by the way he picked up and then banged down some kind of wrench that was on the table in front of him.
Ease him out of the fantasy, Steve reminded himself.
He turned the dinner conversation over in his head again and again, mostly because it made him happy to think about, but also because he couldn’t shake the thought that he was missing things with Tony.  Clues.  Something that would help him figure out what he was supposed to do to make Tony happy, though nothing magically came to mind no matter how many times he repeated everything in his head.
Something special for Tony, though, he should do that.  He could do that.  Things surely hadn’t changed that much where Omegas didn’t want Bonding gifts.  A Bonding gift was supposed to show the Omega your regard.  Your regard through jewelry, at any rate.   And his birthday was coming up.  That had been in the file, Steve remembered as he chewed.  He had no idea what Tony would like for a birthday gift.  Diamonds?  Omegas still liked diamonds, didn’t they?
“It’s a sutler coin.  The Sutlers, they’d come around the camps, usually around payday,” Steve began.  “They’d sell tobacco, chocolates, all kinds of things. They didn’t really make change, though, on account of the currency shortages, so they’d give you these coins back and next time they came, you could use the coins to buy more of their stuff.  ‘Course, you couldn’t use them anywhere
“We’re all silently just going to mutually agree to let the ‘I fail to see’ thing slide, right?” Tony asked, glancing around.   “I feel like that was a test.  I feel tested.  Did I pass?  I passed, right?”
“Yeah, and then I married her.  You gonna marry Mr. One Night Stand?” Bucky asked, raising an eyebrow.
Steve’s head fell to his chest as he tried to get air to go properly into his lungs.  He looked over his shoulder and saw that Tony’s head was thrown back, one arm toss over his eyes while he did the same, though Tony was mouthing words that he couldn’t seem to get any actually volume on.  Steve sucked in a deep breath and pushed himself up to his knees, feeling suddenly empty as Tony’s softening cock slid out of him.  Tony grabbed the back of his neck and pulled Steve to his chest, turning his head to place a bruising, sloppy kiss on Steve’s mouth.
“That his bed is rarely slept in.  That his plates go back to the kitchen full.  That he works all night and spends the day closeted in his Council chambers with General Rhodes and his other advisors, and that they leave in foul moods with more work to be done in less time,” Cam reported.
There was a battle raging in his mind between what he seemed believable and what he wanted to believe. Captain America—Steve—couldn’t love someone like Tony.  Not really.  He had misheard.  Misinterpreted.  Missed
Tony knew Coulson had just said it, but he needed to hear it, over and over, like the more times it was said, the harder it would be for the universe to take it back.  No take-backs, you hear, he thought hazily.  No take-backs.  People were staring at them.  They were making a scene.  He didn’t care.  Let them look, as long as Coulson kept saying Steve was okay.
“I should’ve seen it.  Stopped it.
“Goddammit, Tony, is this a joke to you?  Some game? This is my life.  My
The man’s gaze snapped up to him at that, and then swept down over him again.  And great.  Just great.  He’d practically ruined the guy’s suit and introduced himself as a…as a…well, what he was, all in one breath.  Never let it be said that he did things in half measures.  The guy was probably going to call security and get him thrown out.  Steve tried not to feel relief at the prospect.
“Coulson can’t stop them. It’s like…a Constitutional thing,” Tony muttered, frowning.
“We are to follow orders. It is not our place to judge the King,” the smaller of the guards said, though his voice was low and stiff.  “Nor is it yours, Raj’Inama,” he finished pointedly, though the two guards exchanged displeased looks.
“Thing was,” Steve began, then broke off, finding the words suddenly lodged in his throat.  He tried to clear them, then ended up blinking and looking away, his body going rigid for a moment.  “Thing was, when it was all said and done, he paid me. He paid me, you know. Threw all that money on the ground like an ass, but he paid.  And I—I picked it up. One by one, I picked all of it up. I remember kneeling there while they laughed and shouted things. Someone threw a used condom at me.  But, I picked up the money. All of it. I keep thinking about that. I keep going back there in my head sometimes. I have this fantasy where I shove it all back in his face or just walk out and leave it there, but I didn’t.  I picked it all up. My hands were shaking, and I thought I was going to throw up or something, but I got it all. Put it in my bag. Left. That was it. I put it in the box back at the apartment with the rest of it and told myself it was going to be worth it when we had it all.” He stopped, swallowing hard.
“You are kind,” Steve said, plunging on as if his mind didn’t conjure up just the image Tony put into it.  If he didn’t say this now, the moment would be gone, and they would have nothing but what they could find when everything except feeling was stripped away.
Steve was looking at some point on the far wall over Tony’s shoulder.  His shoulders were pulled back and stiff with tension.   Someone was a Grumpy Gus, Tony thought, physically restraining himself from rolling his eyes.
“Hmmm,” Tony murmured, then his face relaxed into a soft smile. “
“He was probably just kidding around, Brock.  Besides, it doesn’t seem right to go behind the guy’s back and sell him out like that.  Seems like that happens to him a lot. Must be hard, living like that,” Steve said.
Maybe it was petty, but giving her any satisfaction for being right by pure happenstance was just more than he could do, high road be damned.  He’d take the low road of imagining her worrying about him in the middle of her morning yoga session and bridge club lunch.  She had a good fifteen, twenty minutes there that were open for worrying about her only child.
“It’s beautiful, Tony.
“How long is he going to be like this?” Pepper asked curiously.
“I’m not pissed at you,” Tony protested.
“Head wound. Not serious, but must’ve stung like a sonofabitch.  Dinner platter, followed by right hook, I’d say. Nicely done. He’s pretty well out,” the Robin Hood cosplayer apparently called Clint said, standing up from where he had been kneeling by Obie.  “Got cuffs on him, just in case,” he added, handing Steve back his belt. “Take a look at this bit of tech. I’m betting this is not exactly sold in stores,” Clint continued, raising his eyebrows in speculation as he held the tiny sonic device that Obie had used up to the light.
To be fair, Bucky would probably have told him that it might have been a little bit about him. He sighed and let his eyes close for a moment, just as the elevator dinged its arrival.  Steve stepped in and pushed the floor for the lobby level, then held the door expectantly for Coulson, who shook his head.
The King’s eyes left Steve’s and turned to stare up at the curtain that canopied the bed.  Steve wasn’t sure how long they stayed like that.  He thought he might have dozed.  When he did look over again, the King was breathing evenly and deeply, hair slicked back with sweat-slicked curls, mouth parted in sleep, looking far younger than he had earlier.
Steve felt himself relax a bit.  Right, he reminded himself firmly.  Focus on how good things were going to be after this.  Brock was okay with this.  They were both on the same page.  It wasn’t going to be a problem for them. In fact, it would fix most every problem they had, he figured.
“I… I kind of met someone,” Steve said.
Howard was beyond Tony’s reach, but this man was entirely too close.  He could pull Judge Friendly’s life apart, piece by piece, until it was as broken as Tony and Steve’s.  It wasn’t everything, but it was something, he thought, with a surge of anticipation so sharp and strong, he could feel his whole body tighten with it like a bowstring.
“Want to go to the Met with me?” Tony heard himself ask, then winced at the sound of it, words spilling out too fast, pleading and hopeful.
“Tony. Only my mom calls me Anthony.  I hate it,” Anthony—
,” Tony began.  “I’m fine.  Really.  Head’s a little sore, but honestly, I had the new class bot on my lap and then dropped it getting out of the car.  You know, when Thing One over there shoved a phony gun in my face.  Always with the look of surprise.  I built weapons for years.  Do you really think I can’t spot a fake?” Tony asked, grimacing at the two of them.  “Anyway, I dropped the damn thing and tripped over it.  Banged my head on the side of the car.  But, it’s fine.  Really.  Just a bump.”
When Steve didn’t move, Tony knew, he really did, that he should let it go.  Say goodnight, and let the evening end, but instead found himself moving over to where Steve was standing, one hand finding Steve’s shoulder, the other pulling Steve’s hand to his waist.
For just a moment, he stood there and let his eyes fall shut, trying to find a calm that refused to come. He could see it so clearly in the front of his mind, the images flickering behind his eyelids like they were playing out on one of those old movie screens you pulled down with a rubbery whoosh.  He and Steve curled up on the sofa with the patchwork quilt thrown over their legs where they intertwined so Tony could get his toes warm.   Tony could almost feel his fingers twirling in the soft hair at the nape of Steve’s neck. Not really watching the movie on the TV so much as just enjoying being together.  Maybe Tony made a comment about whatever it was.  Made Steve laugh, the one where he threw his head back and his whole body shook with it.  Or maybe they were trying to be quiet, Tony thought with a sudden, sharp pang in the vicinity of where his heart was supposed to be.
“What does that even have to do—“ Tony started.
“Well, you’re…you know,” Tony stammered, waving a hand in the air before letting it fall flatly to his side, momentarily thrown.  “You do?” he asked in a high, surprised tone before he could stop himself.
“Steve…Steve…God…you’re…you’re Steve,” Tony muttered.  “My Omega.  Mine.  Mine… you’re mine.  We’re…we’re bonded.  Bonded.  You have to stay.  We’re bonded.  Stay.  Please.  Please, please, stay,” Tony choked out as he thrust deeply, gripping Steve’s hand for dear life.  “We…we can…go to the island.  Island.  No way to…have to stay. Stay.  On the island. Steve, please.  We’re bonded.”
“Oh. Right. Of course not. That’s—I mean, I didn’t think you did—that you would. I’m sorry,” the man said again, actually sounding rather sincere about it instead of just flustered by Tony’s sudden appearance at his door. “Here,” the man said, shoving out some folded bills that looked mostly like ones. “I have…seven dollars. Damn. Okay, well, this isn’t really enough for a cab back to the city. Is that—is that where you’re going?”
He couldn’t quite remember the entire menu, and hadn’t bothered paying attention to the names of the various types of cuvee that paired with each course, but he did his best.  It was something, at least.  Here’s your hotel towel, fancy soaps and a handwritten menu of what I ate. Thanks for not choking Bucky while I was gone, Steve thought with a small huff of a laugh as he stared down at the notebook and imagined Natasha’s reaction.
“Clint!” Steve yelled as loudly as he dared without raising the whole camp to alarm.
“You don’t know what you’re even talking about,” Steve snapped back, harsh and brutal and full of a desperate kind of pain.  Tony remembered some video he’d seen once of a dog with its leg caught in a trap, ready to bite anyone who tried to help, no matter how much pain it was in.  It couldn’t trust the hand reaching out wasn’t going to somehow be worse than what it knew.
To be fair, it was this kind of thing that probably made SHIELD insist on the therapist.
“Fine,” Stark said after a beat of silence.  He took another sip of wine while Steve struggled to figure out what to say now that he had Stark’s agreement.  What had they been talking about?  The team.  Right.  Well, definitely no minefields there, Steve thought with a derisive twist of his mouth.
Tony took a sip of his bottled water, then nearly choked on it as he caught sight of the sketch.  It was him, inside the power loader from Aliens, with a squirrel holding a missile perched on his shoulder.  DUM-E was on one side of him attempting to pick up a round, cartoon bomb with a lit fuse, and U was on the other side with a fire extinguisher at the ready.  A wide grin split Tony’s face as he looked at the drawing.  He cast a glance over his shoulder, but Steve was already out of the garage.  He quirked his mouth and bit his lip.  A warm, loose bolt of pleasure raced through him, curling around inside until it settled in the center of his chest.
Steve ushered him into the room, then tossed the pillow on the floor and sank to his knees, letting his head rest against Tony’s stomach, his arms coming up to circle around Tony’s waist.  Tony ran his hand through Steve’s hair a few times.  “You did good tonight,” Steve told him.
, for God’s sake.  For his own sake.  He needed to stop.  Let this go.  Let… Tony go.  The idea of Tony, anyway.  Obviously, Tony himself wasn’t his.  Not that he wanted Tony to be his, Steve rationalized firmly, ignoring the curl of… something… deep inside his chest.  He didn’t want Tony, because he had Brock.  Sure, the sex had been good.  Great.  Whatever.  But, he was--he had Brock.
“Thanks,” Steve replied.
“Look, I tried to make up for the whole stripper pole on the jet thing with being a completely awesome wingman and buying you a lap dance with Mr. American Pie, and now you’re in like and having feelings, and I get that’s freaking you out, but there’s no reason to call me out like that.  Besides, Ferris, if I’m anyone, I’m the hot sister who can’t get away with shit and tries to get you to behave, but ultimately hates The Man more,” Rhodey protested, giving Tony a firm nod.
“Close only counts in grenades and horseshoes,” Obie announced loudly, frowning down at the putter in his hand.  “Well.  The prodigal son returns. Good to see you, Tony.  Been a while.  Come in, come in. Close the door, would you, Liz? We’d like not to be disturbed.  Thanks,” Obie said with a nod to his assistant, who pulled the door closed behind Tony with a soft snick.  “That your presentation?” Obie asked, nodding at the tablet in Tony’s lap.  He leaned the putter against the arm of one of the matching leather chairs and bent down to stub out his cigar into a cinder-filled glass ashtray on the corner of the marble-topped coffee table.
He wasn’t even sure why he was hesitating.  He was being stupid. A very naked, very wet Steve Rogers was inviting Tony to shower with him.  He was fairly sure he’d had this dream, and it didn’t end with him being a giant pansy because was playing some weird version of Taboo where his list of no-go words was ‘I may have kind of accidentally aided terrorism.’  It felt like he was taking advantage of something, but he couldn’t seem to figure out a way to say no without launching into an explanation-slash-abject apology-slash-offer of a blow job, if that would help. Plus, Steve had his hand braced on the sides of the shower stall and was leaning forward into Tony’s space, all wet and naked—seriously, had he mentioned Steve was wet and naked?  Because he was. Very wet and decidedly naked. That defense to stupidity would stand up in any court.
“Traitor,” Pepper muttered at the ceiling.
“Or if you disobeyed me, and I took you over my knee?  Used my hand or my belt on you until you begged me to stop?” Tony mused, seemingly idly, though his eyes were dark and intent on Steve.
“You know, when I told you two to get a room, this wasn’t quite what I had in mind,” Natasha observed mildly from the doorway.  Bruce brushed past her, medical bag in hand, and knelt down next to the cot.  He peeled back on the corner of the makeshift bandage and then nodded perfunctorily.
With a resigned sigh, Steve got up and headed for the small pail of water that he kept by the fireplace. He took a cloth and cleaned himself off from the night’s ambulations as he had so many nights before.  Surely, it was a sin, to dream something and--and do this.  Worse even, he couldn’t
As they made the front of the building Tony waved to the car window, behind which he assumed Rhodey was making a what-the-hell-face. He followed Steve down to the bus stop and stood next to him, rubbing at his arms in the cold. Would've brought his coat if he'd known the evening would involve the outdoor variety of stalking.
“God, fuck, look at you, you’re so fucking gorgeous, Steve,” Tony ground out, shifting in his seat and rubbing his palm hard against the juncture of his thighs.  “My beautiful one, my treasure, come for me.  Come for me.  Come for me, Steve.”
Did that guy—Rumlow, of the Monty Python levels of running away—did he know?  Maybe, Tony mentally acquiesced.  Or maybe Rumlow and Hagrid or whatever the other guy’s name was just knew enough to know they didn’t want to mess with Steve. It was a bit hard for Tony to quite wrap his head around it.  Steve was intimidating in the way Alphas just naturally were.  Bigger. Stronger. Too used to getting their way.  But, Steve was Steve, and Steve was…kind.  Smart. Funny.  Occasionally goofy, when you got down to it.  Liked to take care of Tony.  Liked to be outwitted by fish.
What did he dream of?
“You don’t know that,” Steve protested.
“Alright,” Fury agreed, brow pulling together as if considering Steve’s request.  “Reason I ask is…well, truth is, I’ve heard that the parents might be interested in something a little more…permanent. Given the situation.  All the talk, true or not, it doesn’t help, and someone like you being interested…well, I imagine they might be willing to agree to a bit more than just Courting.  Might insist on it, in fact.”
“Okay.  Really?  Um, well.  I don’t have that, but there’s internet.  Plenty of books.  DVDs. Nice deck, if you wanted to get a telescope or something.  I could—I could bring one up for you.  If you wanted,” Rogers offered, almost hesitantly.  “Got an empty garage up there you can store whatever you want in.”
She’d been low on funds to cover his treatments. He remembered that.  They hadn’t gotten the loan. He’d still gotten the treatments, though.  She had taken night shifts in the TB ward for the extra pay. That particular loan had come due about a year later.  She’d told him she would be fine, but the handkerchief she kept constantly tucked in her pocket was stained with dark, red circles, though Steve had let himself believe her anyway.
“Ah.  Yeah, about that,” Steve began.  Better to just dive in and get it over with, he supposed.  “Coulson mentioned you’d ordered, ah...some...crickets, along with the fishing gear.  I thought we could just use some of the tackle instead, since I was thinking we could take a picnic with us. Save the live bait for another time.”
“You can’t tell me the shark thing isn’t weird,” Tony replied.
Steve hefted the basket and blanket, then followed Tony down the dock and back to the shore. He spread the blanket out under the tree, on the flat patch he found earlier, and unpacked the basket.
Tony.
Brock got out his lucky deck of cards and small wooden poker chip carousel, which he added to the table. The others gathered around, the soft snicks of beer bottles opening echoing one after the other.  Steve put one of the bowls of chips on the table and took a seat, nursing a slightly warm beer.  Griff turned on the television and signed into Brock’s pornhub account, scrolling through the choices until he found something that, from what Steve could tell, fell into the ‘there’s something here for everyone’ category.  Steve turned his back to the TV and took a sip of his beer, while the occasional moan and slap of skin faded into background noise as Brock dealt the first hand.
attractive.  Maybe a six, six-point-five,” Natasha said with a deferential nod and a sly smile tugging at her lips.  “Likes…America, apple pie, long walks on very warm beaches, punching Nazis,” Natasha ticked off, then took a nonchalant sip of her martini.  “Okay, not the last part.”
The distance between them was so clear now, and Steve knew he had been the one to put it there. For a brief moment, his mind shuttered, and he could smell the sea air, feel the wind against his face and see his village in the distance, except now, there was a man on the shore he knew, calling to him and he was still sitting there on the cliff, watching as the fires grew closer and closer. Down there was ash and death and loss, yes, but down there was life and love, too. There was nothing for him up here except the safety of barren rock, an illusion of gaining something, without risking anything. As if such a thing were possible.
He did catch the driver’s lip twitch though, so he took it as a small victory.  Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Tony close his eyes and duck his head with a smile.  He figured by this point, Tony probably thought he was an idiot.  A pretty idiot, maybe, but certainly not the brightest crayon in the box.  He sighed.  This kind of thing had always been difficult for him, and tonight he was entirely too nervous to worry about impressing Tony with his mind.  He was pretty sure that wasn’t going to be required anyway.
“Buck—“ Steve began, then stopped, at a loss for words.
A postcard with a shot of Coney Island’s coaster was under the handkerchief, next to a matchbook from the cheap motel they’d stayed in during their brief drive to Vermont for the romantic civil union in front of a justice of the peace. He tugged out what sat under that and held it up by the edges, careful not to crush it. Steve’s half of their photobooth strip, one with Tony’s wide-eyed stare caught by the flash and one with his head buried into Steve’s chest, smiling from underneath Steve’s chin, stared back at him, faded and slightly yellow with time, but still almost bursting from the white-bordered sides with happiness, like only part of what they were could be captured.
“Ah,” Tony gasped as Steve slipped out of him, leaving him feeling incredibly empty.  To his surprise, his cock jumped in Steve’s hand, and a small rush of cum shot out. Steve’s chest rumbled with a low, pleased growl that worked its way into Tony’s skin in warm, spreading heat.  Tony had heard you could come on an Alpha’s knot, but that had the feeling of an old wives’ tale or something that happened to your second cousin’s roommate’s dog groomer or whatever.
Steve had been saying that for a while now. They were taking a different route back to his people than the one he and his friend took on their Journey. A faster one, though more dangerous, but the only way they might make it before winter arrived in full force and made travel impossible.
“Are you sure, Tony?  Really, I don’t mind,” Pepper offered.  “I was just frustrated and…I shouldn’t have said anything.  I know you wouldn’t ask me without a good reason.  Okay, that’s not entirely true, but I shouldn’t have assumed.”
“I—Steve,” Tony breathed out, reaching out to cup a hand over Steve’s arm where it held onto the edge of the sink for support.
“Pissed off,” Steve supplied, voice rising in question.
“Funny thing.  It turns out I might still be married to Steve.  Rogers. Steve Rogers. From MIT.  Just a paperwork snafu.  But, so.  Yeah.  I went to see him today.  He lives in Brooklyn now. Real shithole.  Almost as bad as our Boston place,” Tony stammered, sucking in a breath.  “He’s going to sign the paperwork again.  No problems.  It’ll all be over in a few days.  Just—you know. Thought you should know.”
“Good. That’s good, Steve,” Tony said.  His voice was low and rough, like each word was being slowly dragged from him.  It warmed over Steve’s skin, constricting his chest and making his thoughts go calm, smooth, all the tumult pushed somewhere else.  Steve let himself sink into the feeling, let it envelope him, until it pushed everything else aside. There was just him and Tony. Nothing else.  There was no pain, except what they allowed, and there was beautiful safety in that, Steve thought as his mind drifted.
“Count them off,” Tony said finally.  Steve turned his head to the side.  He could see their blurry, flicking reflections in the windowpanes. Tony behind him, Steve’s body pale and curved against the dark colors of the bed. It was beautiful in its own way, the tableau, Steve thought with a deep sort of pleasurable hum warming the notion.  He watched Tony’s body twist, his arm raise, and then swing down in a whoosh of air that filled Steve’s ears.
“You know I can’t,” Steve replied.  He actually sounded somewhat apologetic about it.
“I’ll take door number two for who put the kibash on that,” Tony grumbled.
He started across the room towards the wall of books, which concealed Howard’s safe, then stopped halfway there.
“Do you really think we’re not going to pay attention when Daddy Warbucks here brings home a couple orphans from Hydra’s favorite nightspot?” Fury asked.
The little bit of cash Steve was able to get off his credit cards didn’t last particularly long, but he did get a lucky pull on a slot machine that left them up for a while. Brock parlayed that into a couple of games of craps where he came out ahead and then wanted to try his luck at the poker table. Steve watched for a bit, meandered around and tried the roulette wheel and lost, then sat down on a stool in front of one of the quarter slots--Grandpa slots, as Brock liked to call them. To be fair, there
“Jane, you should tell Tony about your latest project,” Steve urged, seeming to have adjusted to his initial shock at finding his closet of an apartment suddenly brimming over with blasts from the past.  He brushed past Tony and went into the tiny kitchen, nudging Barnes out of the way so he could grab a six-pack of beer out of the fridge.  “Jane’s been out in New Mexico doing some testing, but she’s had some issues with the equipment.  Jane, Tony can fix anything,” Steve said, tipping the neck of a bottle of beer in Tony’s direction.
When he came, it hit him so hard, his vision whited, and he let out a shout that he thought might have been a name.  His body curled around Tony as Tony worked the last of it out of him.  He was shaking, he realized, when he was able to realize anything again.  Cold, all of a sudden.  Hands were on his skin, then, rubbing vigorously over his arm, back and thigh until the chill passed.
Tony shrugged out of his tuxedo jacket and undid the small buttons at the cuffs of the crisply starched white shirt, then rolled up the sleeves, right hand rubbing over the titanium band that circled his left wrist. He caught his reflection in the three-paneled mirror above the bureau and ran light fingers up and down the center row of buttons, stopping briefly to tap on the hard plane of blue that shone through the white shirt.
Cameras flashed in Steve’s eyes, momentarily blinding him while his mind screamed at him.  He had the sudden, almost irresistible impulse to duck and take Tony down with him. They weren’t flash grenades.  He knew that. He was at a press conference, not under fire, but it felt, for that span of a few heartbeats, like he still needed to duck. Like it just would be better if he did, even if he was wrong.  It would be safer. Tony would be safer.
Steve stilled as he set the pitcher down on the counter.  He looked over his shoulder at Tony, still hovering by the door, and Tony didn’t think that was lost on Steve, or that much of anything was lost on Steve.  Dish soap, Tony reminded himself.  Be careful with this one.  He doesn’t just see, he notices.
His limbs felt loose and bowstring tight at the same time, but he could feel relief and nervous excitement starting to leak past all the Slow, Men Working signs in his head. Steve had loved him. It had been real. All of it. And now, they had a second chance.
“It was him that night,” Steve began.  Tony had a sudden, nearly overwhelming impulse to tell him to stop. The hairs on the back of his neck stood up, and coldness spread down his back.  But, he forced the words back.  There had been too many secrets pulling them apart for too long.   “On the road back from the Pentagon.  Your father was transporting something—something that Hydra wanted—and so they sent Bucky,” Steve explained slowly.  “There couldn’t be any witnesses.  Do you understand what I’m telling you?”
“But I’m not blind, either, Tony.  So, maybe I didn’t notice it then, but I’m telling you, I’ve seen him before.  So have you, but you probably didn’t notice or don’t remember.  Not that I blame you, all the shit that happened, but, yeah, it’s him.  I’m almost sure of it,” Rhodey said firmly.
see him, all of him, and yet, Steve knew there were parts of himself he kept locked away from Tony. He didn’t want to, but… he didn’t finish the thought, letting it flow away like the water.
“Okay, so, I guess I’ll see you later then?  Maybe six or so?” Steve suggested quickly.
Coulson just hummed in response, which did nothing to settle Tony’s already frayed nerves.  His Alpha was apparently so special, Coulson probably kept a framed picture in his locker and drew little hearts around his name on all his forms, but didn’t actually want to be Bonded with anyone, and just drew Tony out of a hat to satisfy the higher-ups.  Hell, Steve didn’t even want…
“Your turn,” Steve said, taking the rough cake of soap from Tony’s hand. Tony turned, lowered himself, and let Steve cradle his head in the water while he ran the soap through the thick curls.  When he was done, Steve relaxed his hands, letting Tony’s head fall under the water while he rinsed the soap, then pulled him up, catching him under his arms.  Steve repeated the motions Tony had used, up and down Tony’s arms, gliding the soap from the tip of his fingers to the shallow of his neck, then down, over the metal disc that gleamed from the center of Tony’s chest.
The forward part of the ship, the Valkyrie, had crumpled on impact, dumping Steve, a few tons of steel and the dark, cold pressure of the water towards the back of the ship as it sank into the chunk of ice that kept it off the ocean floor.  His legs had been pinned first. There, at the high part of his thighs, just high enough to make it nearly impossible to get any leverage as more and more water and debris rushed on top of him.  One of those things Tony knew now, the way Steve knew Tony hadn’t fallen off his bike.
