Steve took advantage of his need of less sleep and cut down the actual time it took while still satisfying all the requirements.
He’s finishing the top of Tony’s hand and just interlocking their fingers together when Tony speaks.
“Barnes doesn’t matter, what matters is that you need to take action to either move yourself forward with Steve or know for sure it’s done.
He sighs and flips the phone end over end on the desk as he stares out the window and losses track of time.
He accepts that he was being selfish and he will be hyper aware of those feelings in the future because it seems that what he wants causes too much collateral damage.
He wants to trust Tony, that’s why he sent the cell phone and left all the messages, but he still finds it hard to let down his guard.
And Steve knows it comes from a place of caring but he’s tired of putting on an act and sometimes he just want to hide in the office and read a book.
Steve’s already sitting at one end of the couch which means Tony can sit wherever he wants and Steve’s very pleased when Tony sits right next to him.
This place is ours, these people depend on us, and now Tony knows where we are, which means Ross could know.
Steve’s lost almost everything, again, and he didn’t want to give up that last piece of hope. But being apprehensive doesn’t stop him from replaying their meeting and remembering how Tony looked playing with his phone or the way they shook hands.
Of course Steve assumes that Tony doesn’t either and that’s part of the reason Steve is probably drawn to him.
He concentrates on calming his breathing and tries to take deep breaths because all he wants to do is cry.
Call it pay back for watching him like a hawk and just following him around as though he’s going to break.
Leading up to the reopening, Steve keeps busy by painting and repairing simple items, but afterward he had no real purpose and felt restless.
He pulls the hat low and keeps his chitchat to a minimum hiding behind the relaxing atmosphere that’s usually expected within a massage room.
“No, I don't think it would work the way Tony hopes, but I don’t disagree that we need some form of structure.”
Steve can’t wait another week to see Tony again, so he texts Tony the next day and invites him over for dinner.
He’s sure that he and Sam would have an argument about Tony showing up suddenly under the guise of being a regular.
After just a few meetings Steve saw a pattern in the throw away comments about tired joints or aches and pains.
“I’m…” Steve starts appalled but Tony’s very fast and one hand grasps his wrists tightly and says “Don’t.”
Tony didn’t impart some mystical wisdom, but he thinks hearing it from the person he hurt most helps.
During the last several weeks Steve has tried to look at tasks differently, to just get up in the morning instead of feeling so weighed down.
The actual percentage turned out to be much less because if they did recognize him, no one said a word.
The colors were bright but calming and the doors had opened again within a month of their settlement.
He stops and listens but hears nothing out of the ordinary, however he can’t ignore the feeling that someone is there.
His decisions cost the people he cares about so much and those decisions weren’t just about right and wrong, there was an undercurrent of selfishness that Steve can’t forget.
Steve wanted to do the painting himself but accepted that it would be more efficient to have professionals tackle the project.
He moves the cooler he left earlier from against the wall to set it down between two chairs and sits in the one farthest from the stairs.
“Another thing Rhodey has been on me about is that I need to be upfront with my intentions due to you being ancient and not picking up on subtle clues or flirting.”
His mornings don’t include a lot of personal grooming; the alarm sounds, he showers, eats standing at the counter, and goes to the Center.
As the months rolled by, Steve took less and less care about the way he looked. He found that people avoided eye contact around the Center the more unkept he seemed; he liked that.
As Steve rolls over to the table he squirts oil into his palm, then lays the bottle to the side on the table.
The wet pants are cool and sticking to him which would normally be uncomfortable but all Steve feels are Tony’s strong fingers.
. The dim lighting and the music/sounds help Steve forget about everything on the other side of the door.
“Yes because I’m sick of mopey Tony, I want over confident Tony that is making it so I can walk again.
And if they can’t, then fuck’em because they’ll never comprehend the kinds of decisions we make every day.
Round and round he goes in his mind, dissecting the reasons behind his actions and always coming to the same conclusion.
There’s a sign informing all guests that the books are free and that they only ask for it to be returned when finished.
Sam had told him what happened to Rhodey, even sharing that the fall features in his rotation of nightmares as it brought up too many parallels to Riley; watching two people fall from the sky is not easy to move past.
And I think you need to just accept that you like Steve and you want to reconcile but you’re afraid it will make you weak.”
But Steve doesn’t want to disappoint Sam so they go to a nearby diner, just a few blocks walking distance.
“And you want to sign now?” Sam asks incredulously, he takes a few steps toward the counter before pivoting and heading toward the door again.
Steve blushes and brushes his hair back, which falls right back into his faces, trying to conceal his embarrassment.
However, Tony finally responded by seeking him out and Steve thinks that should count for something.
“Bad decisions were made with horrible consequences, if I didn’t pause and take stock of the situation,
Unlike you and I, there were a few moments in Siberia where I thought he wasn’t going to pull his punches and that we would permanently hurt each other.
Instead he just concentrates on his task and when he arrives at the thumb he rubs the webbing hard knowing that it was bothering Tony.
He keeps calling; keeps leaving messages that always say the same thing: it’s Steve, how are you then he mentions a way to reach out.
He tries to ignore the way his heart triple times as the sound gets closer and then abruptly silences as Tony descends to the ground.
At the start of the day Steve’s last client is scheduled for 5pm however a midday call asked to come in at 6:30pm.
If Steve were honest with himself, he knows his presence is not a secret it’s just that no one has come looking.
He recognizes that it’s wallowing because it feels so similar to how he felt when he and Pepper split up.
In the silence that follows Steve considers the information and why Tony would share and assumes it was an olive branch, or information exchange testing the trust they’re trying to rebuild.
Tony’s so focused on the rhythm of flipping the phone he doesn’t hear Rhodey roll in until he clears his throat.
Steve pulls back, resting his forehead against Tony’s for a moment before bringing his hand up to his face and he stares at Tony while he licks his palm.
The thumb on his hand starts rubbing again and Tony picks up the other one and uncurls the fingers so that he’s half caressing and half rubbing both hands.
, stand by and do nothing. He went after something for himself and it caused the end of the Avengers.
Steve still finds the whole song and dance exhausting though, but lately it’s been easier to keep it up.
Or, if he had done something to fuck it up but he’d been so sure that they had found a level playing field and were on the same page.
He’s still a criminal in the eyes of the government, his best friend is still frozen in Wakanda and his team is fractured.
It’s later than normal to schedule a client but Steve has been known to accept off hours requests understanding that sometimes a person doesn’t want to be around a large group of people.
He knows, or at least assumes that Tony is picking up the messages because the voicemail is never full and considering Steve leaves multiple messages a month, he knows he’s being heard.
Steve picks out the next clean pair of pants, a dark gray jogging pair and a black t-shirt before scarfing down a banana and a class of orange juice as he leans against the counter in his kitchen.
Tony shouts as he walks down the hall and Steve can’t help but think he’s running after such an emotional exchange.
Not to be outdone, Steve stands and steps forward leaning heavily on the hand that’s grasping the railing.
The months went by and getting up didn’t get any easier and working with Sam continued to be a juggling act between being effective and being invisible.
Tony’s experience with mind control was short-lived and it had seriously freaked him out, he can’t imagine what it would be like to have no autonomy for
Tony scratches his fingernails across the palm of his hand and Steve twitches, huffs and looks up to Tony’s face.
In those hours, he concentrates on doing good and giving back while counting down the minutes to when he can be alone again.
They also encourage visitors to leave their favorite book in the hopes that another could enjoy it as well.
“I feel like I have an unfair advantage here knowing that my advances would be accepted while he has no idea.”
Looking back, he doesn’t like the decisions he’d made. Perhaps they were colored by the knowledge of what happened, but he can't help but wonder that if he took the time to think before he acted, if he would have made different choices.
Steve’s not cynical at heart but he’s starting to think the surprise early morning visits are Sam’s way of checking in on him.
Tony is so hot, Steve’s not sure if it’s just the way Tony feels, or if he’s cold due to the rain, or if it’s been so long he doesn’t remember the details of what it feels like to be with someone.
Steve is hypnotized as Tony’s fingers glide over his own, how Tony’s skin tone is slightly darker than his own.
He runs because he’s late, not to save himself from getting drenched because he’s soaking wet within moments.
He attended the meetings as an observer, listening to the problems people were experiencing but found he had no words of wisdom to share.
For just a second Steve contemplates telling Sam that it was Tony’s idea about the paint, but he still wants to keep his meetings and texting with Tony just for himself.
He presses down and moves his hands in slow circles. He uses the tops of his fingers and drags them up Tony’s back; Tony shudders.
Since it was located close to the common room they decorated with sound blocking drapes along the walls.
Rhodey’s right, Steve is a horrible liar, as his eyes broadcast his feelings if the person stops to look.
He was afraid to go off on his own and once Sam laid out his plan, Steve convinced himself that helping others could start to fix what he’d destroyed.
And this relaxes Steve and he wants to be that for Tony too, a place Tony can be himself and Steve hopes that Tony’s comment was about their meetings and not something else.
Tony pulls Steve’s hair hard where it’s still wrapped around his fingers and Steve’s eyes close as he whimpers.
He runs a brush through his hair, then quickly through his beard, slaps some conditioner on it and calls it a day.
You glossed over the details but you said he went after Bucky with such hatred that the three of you barely walked away and you think he’s trustworthy?”
Soon enough Tony grabs one of his wrists, as though holding him still in case he changes his mind and the other hand pulls him him down by his neck.
Steve swallows then turns his back to the table when he sees Tony start to swing his legs to the side, sitting up.
Tony clenches his fingers; Steve brushes his cheek along Tony’s neck, he licks the red skin before biting and sucking it into his mouth.
Steve is nervous and when he thinks about it his heart flips over and his mind whirls around the why’s and if’s and how’s.
And just to have complete disclosure I gave him a status update on everyone. And he returned the favor.”
But Tony’s trying to be a better person and he can see that he’s essentially stuck where Steve is concerned.
It’s one of the images that play on a loop in Tony’s mind from Siberia, the utter look of devastation when Tony turns and confronts Steve.
He only has to wait five minutes before he hears the Iron Man armor; something he hasn’t heard in months.
The silence in the room is heavy and though Steve wants to fill the silence, he isn’t sure what to say.
There’s a moment of silence before the room is filled with their laugher at the terrible, inadvertent, innuendo.
He can stop worrying about the how and when and just enjoy being with Tony and trying to figure out what this new thing is for them.
Tony drags his hand from his neck down his chest to grab the waistband of his pants. Steve pushes forward, opens his eyes enough to locate the wall behind Tony, and keeps pushing until Tony is pressed against it.
Steve pulled any additional ambience from the closet, including the table that was stored there when not in use.
Pepper is fantastic, always was and continues to be so I’m trying to be better about papers and meetings.”
As he gets closer to his house, he takes a deep breath and wipes the sweat from his face as he takes his front steps in one leap.
It’s then Steve realizes just how exposed they area, half naked, covered in water and semen just standing in his living room.
He stands in front of his baseball hat collection, and Steve’s aware that it’s considered a collection since he has so many, and grabs a black one with the NASA insignia on it before pushing his hair back and pulling on the hat.
Instead, Steve threw his friends and reputation in the trash all for Barnes; a person who had committed dozens of murders and crimes over the span of decades.
Sam takes a step back and looks at the aqua color then the cans lined up all with a steel blue color dot on the lid.
Tony runs a hand through his hair, which is now sticking up and waves the other around. Steve notices there’s a flush to his cheeks.
He holds his breath as it rings and exhales when it goes right to voicemail, of course it does, but Steve leaves a message.
Tony wasn’t surprised that Steve fell into a routine with the regularity of his calls however he is taken aback at the increased frequency.
As they head toward the rehab room Tony decides that he’ll show up unannounced and gauge Steve’s reaction.
Sam expects something from him because even if he denies it, there’s always this image of what Steve
Steve still doesn’t engage the visitors in more than just small talk as he truly wants the Center to succeed and be a place where others can come and get help and he’s not sure how or if his more visible presence would be a help or hinder at this point.
For Tony’s next visit he’s early, which surprises Steve as he’s still locking up the front and shutting off the lights when he hears the back door.
Sighing Tony admits, “There was a letter with the phone, explaining his actions and the first apology.
He allowed his emotions and the weight of his past to ruin his present, now he goes through the days alone and Steve feels like he deserves it.
And I know you mean well and that you care, but you have this idea in your head about me and I can’t live up to that.
Steve strips the table bare and remakes it before throwing the laundry in the washer before exiting out the back.
His heart is beating hard and fast as he approaches his house and he sees Tony’s face, momentarily lit by the glare of his phone before he lowers it.
Sundays are always light on appointments but today Steve doesn’t have any which has left his whole day open.
So each day he gets up and gives back, tries to be a force for good and with each passing day he likes to think he’s coming to terms with it.
In his eyes everything was taking too long, the classes were too slow or not offered frequently enough, but Steve took as many classes as quickly as he could.
He glances up and Tony is still leaning against the wall, his hair is disheveled and his neck is raw but Steve can only stare at the large mark he left.
He hadn’t realized he was holding his breath, he’s not even sure he was, he just feels better with the door closed and out of Sam’s all seeing eyes.
He’s still not sure how to arrange his life or what all the right answers are, but he’s going to concentrate on the here and now.
He hid behind the need to study or practice, but once he was certified and taking appointments, he ran out of excuses and Sam pounced.
Tony shudders, Steve hears his name as Tony comes, his dick pulsing against his hand, come adding to the slickness.
Steve squeezes their fingers together and pushes them up toward Tony’s wrist but never stops looking at Tony.
I like the time, the quiet, the clandestine feeling of it all.” Steve swallows, his heart tripping over itself as he feels as though he’s revealed something.
Steve decides to run across the street to Dunkin Donuts when he had a break in appointments and brings back Sam’s favorite order.
He focuses all his energy on his client, what was causing them pain and how to go about relieving that pain; the focus allowed him to relax himself and not just the client.
It’s less than a ten minute walk to the diner however it’s along the main street so they walk in silence, no need to try and be heard over the traffic.
Steve wants to deny the request and suggest a different day but he’s never said no to anyone that has reached out for help.
There is silence. “Jesus, you actually drunk dialed Captain America. Hi Captain America, I am so sorry about this Tony usually just drunk dials media outlets. He once asked Fox if they dreamed in stupid and then made it a reality on national TV. Pepper usual has to deal with the blowout after and she’s never happy.” He tips in a teaspoon of sugar and laughs. “Anyway, I’m sorry about Tony bothering you.”
He paints Thor in the mornings, gentle and soft. His hair in a bun, sleep-messed with strands falling out, eyes closed as he takes a sip still steaming coffee. An old God in a modern world. The painting has the touch of age to it, so he adds a bit of a brightness with acrylic to make his hair gold. He adds starbursts of lightning in blue around Thor. Steve leans back on his stool, his fingers crusted with dried paint, and lets the paint dry. The sun is at its peak. It streaks through the windows and the dust glides in the light, delicate and fragile.
The coffee machine chimes in completion, and Tony gets up, sniffing the rising steam. The sun touches his cheek gold. “Humanity is going to eat itself till the point of annihilation, and we’re going to have to save them. There is going to be aliens that Thor or Loki are going to piss off and start an inter-galactic war with. We’re going to be humanity’s only, and that is going to make a difference.” There are times when Tony Stark makes his fingers itch for charcoal. He doesn’t think too close about that. Tony gives him a half smile before heading back to his laboratory.
Steve watches the blur of buildings. “I don’t need watching, Happy. I’m a trained soldier and not as mouthy as Tony.” Happy doesn’t laugh, but his lips twitch. The car slows, miles and miles of cars stalled like someone cut a conveyor belt and everything has stopped. “How is Tony?”
Steve opens his eyes. “Hey, Tony.” Tony gives him a small smile. He drifts to the edge of the pool and hoists himself up, sitting on the ledge of the pool. Tony’s eyes linger, not invasive, a bit warm like lukewarm water on tired skin. For once Tony isn’t in a t-shirt. He’s wearing a dress shirt with the vest unbuttoned. His bare feet poking out from his black trousers. “Tony?”
He draws Bruce in the armchair a quilt pulled up to his stomach, glasses hanging on the end of his nose, his book forgotten on his chest as he dozes in the library. Steve makes the outlines thicker lets the wax of the pencil crayon buildup and then shades them in with light strokes.
“I should have just scraped you and made a hi-tech RCV. At least it would respect me,” Tony mutters. He pulls something out from his pocket and hands it to Steve. Water splatters against the metal case, and Steve leans back trying not get it wet. “I don’t make things to feed capitalism. I make them to withstand life.” It’s a black flip phone. Tony pulls out another one made of silver. “I’ve made them out of spare parts. Since I’m going to be gone, I thought it was a good idea that you had one in case you wanted to talk.” Steve closes his hand around it; the S.T.A.R.K. Industries logo imprinting itself into his skin.
“That would be the League’s Art Supply Store on 215 W and 57th St. and DaVinci Artist Supply on 132 W and 21 St. Would you like me to send you the locations?”
He goes to church sometimes. Not often enough and he hopes no one minds. He listens to the sermons and the testaments that he has memorized, watching the way the light filters through the stain glass windows. There are three behind the priest: one in the colours of a fire warmed autumn, one in the colours of the evergreen of spring, and the last the blue cold of winter. He prays every night out of habit, sits on the edge of his bed, hands folded on his knees, with his head bowed. He does not ask for forgiveness just that those he left had good lives, that his mother was happy, that Peggy lived a life to fullness, that Bucky did not suffer, and the men he led had no regrets. When he was younger his prayers were different. In his tiny room where the wind touched his skin and bone that the small radiator could not defeat, he wished for health. When he was a young man, and he felt desire deep inside that pulled and craved he wished for normality.
Steve reaches out and grips Bruce’s hands in his own. “You are our friend, and we will protect you, but you will never put Tony in danger like that again, Bruce do you understand me?”
His mother taught him never to hit a lady. The woman in front of him is different. She is a solider. He agrees, and when she punches him in the kidney with the intent to kill and dodges his fist, he grins. In the end he wins, and even with his super solider healing his body hurts.
“Smelt them into something else.” Time will temper the jagged edges of souls that tear into you. It will temper the pain, longing, fear, anger, and sorrow until it becomes a part of you smoothed down into the cervices left behind by life.
Thor hefts Mjölnir over his shoulder in disappointment and goes over to sit down on a large portion of ceiling that collapsed, sulking. Natasha glances around. “What happened?”
As ice starts to line his lungs and cold curls around each of his cells, he does not fight. There will be a better world, so it’s okay to let himself submerge in the darkness. It’s okay.
“Steve.” Bucky stares at him, eyes weighted in stone. “There are clubs here that we can go to, Steve. It’s different. No one knows you here,” Bucky whispers.
In the fall when the leaves start to change into autumn hued oranges, reds, and yellows before decaying, he tells Tony that there are days where he isn’t sure if the world is real.
He opens his sketchbook, smooths a hand over the thick blank page. Steve sets his tin of prismacolors on his desk and starts to sketch Bruce in black, not too precise just rough and full of streaks. Dr. Banner is muted colours, subdued yet still vibrant. Sometimes, they spend their evenings in the Tower’s library, reading. Bruce sits in the red upholstered armchair with a fuzzy blanket draped over his knees, glasses slipping as he reads science papers or works from the romantic period. Steve likes to sit on the window seat with his back against the side panel as the sun trails his skin. His shoes on the hardwood floor next to his mug of tea. When Tony notices, he adds more books to the library for them. He orders subscriptions to Scientific American, Sky & Telescope, Popular Science, Physics Today, New Scientist and updates the science section. He adds books from Steve’s childhood, and the books that came after. He enjoys the serenity of their time together.
Steve floats on the surface like a leaf in a pond. The water in the pool is heated to a soothing point, and he lulls in the gentle buoyancy of the waves. For a moment. Just a moment. He thinks about just letting the water swallow him and falling into a soundless and sightless oblivion, opening his mouth, letting the water fall in and fill his lungs.
Happy opens the backdoor to help. Steve shakes his head and puts the bags in the back before walking to the side and getting into the passenger’s seat. Happy signals, checks his blind spot, and merges into the traffic.
Adapting or accumulating to the world is easier once he leaves S.H.I.E.L.D.’s HQ and starts to live in the Avengers Tower.
He turns off the water, squeezing the Sunlight soap bottle, watching the soap soak into the sponge. “Difficult. I used to get into a lot of fights dragged Bucky down into them. I was the kid no one wanted to play with. It was understandable. Everyone was afraid something would happen. I just didn’t like it. I tried hard to be normal everyday. I had Bucky. He made things easier, less lonely.” He starts to scrub the dishes, circling the inside of a mug. “But lonely children find things suited for lonely children and mine was drawing.”
Clint clicked his tongue, thrusting a milky spoon at the screen. “I was assigned to bodyguard Rader in D.C. once and she’s a homophobic asshole. The things she said to people are horrible. It’s no wonder she’s going after Tony.”
“Stop doing that–just stop. Let’s just talk, okay? I’m in Japan right now. You once told me that you thought technology was dream-like, right? Well here I always feel like that about technology, it isn’t better than mine of course nothing is. I come here, and I always want to invent. I’ll bring you next time to show you want I mean.”
“Thank you.” Tony squints at him as he yawns into the back of his hand. “Thank you for the hologram.”
Tony sighs and comes to sit next to him. They look over the city together watch the soft glow from the apartment buildings flicker off. The thing about the 21st century is that it does not sleep. There is always something open, something lit—something alive even in the deepest night.
“Sick,” he answers, putting his mug into the sink. He turns on the tap and starts to rinse the dishes, smoothing his hand over the surface of plates and swirling water into cups.
Natasha and Clint exist together, so they must be drawn together. Steve sets up a small studio in the living room. He lays his box of charcoal sticks and pencils in white and black, a kneaded eraser, and chalk pastels on the coffee table. He leans his back against the sofa and balances his sketchbook on his knees. The sun is pleasant and warm on his skin. They like to sit on the couch after missions from S.H.I.E.L.D. where they come back worn and wounded. Natasha wraps a shawl around her shoulders. It is beautiful thing, made of different patterns so intricate that they bleed into each other; it is like staring at a Rosch test. The longer you stare more patterns become noticeable. The centre of it is a flora mandala that blooms coloured in different shades of purple from lavender to plum, and different ranges of blue from baby, cyan and sapphire. It is the only thing she brought over from Russia. She doesn’t know where it came from only that it is the only thing that belongs to her. When she goes on missions that she isn’t sure she’ll come back from, she gives the shawl to Clint. Natasha folds into a square and holds it like an offering. Clint grips it, creasing the ironed fabric. They don’t look away from each other, silent and somber. They have built a world in their silence. He looks at them; his heart is constricted by thorns that pierce the muscles of his heart, and thinks of Bucky. When they come back from missions though they are like cats, sunbathing. Natasha’s feet in Clint’s lap, and he wraps his raw hands around them as his head tips over the back of the couch. The left side of Natasha’s face scraped, starting to heal in purples and blues, and lip torn like a page dyed in red ink. He draws the couch and their bodies in black. Their bruises in red, healing purple-blues, and their scabs in rusted red. Together they are what help him survive S.H.I.E.L.D. During the time that therapy is mandatory and so is his refusal to talk, it is Clint who helps him avoid his appointments. Once as they walk down the metallic halls in the lab where behind bulletproof glass blowtorches flare and hammers pound. Clint says, “they make their weapons and then are afraid of them nicking their skin.” His eyes are dun and dull. “They think that weapons do not weather in a life of war.”
When the air becomes weighted with humidity, and cicadas scream in the night. Tony turns up the AC in the tower so high that Steve has to wear sweaters, and can’t sleep without a blanket. Tony doesn’t come out of his lab and goes up to the roof less and less. The one time he does come up Tony is hollowed out, bruises purple-blue under the well of his eyes, and gaunt. He sits down next to Steve, and the sweat is starting to pool down Tony’s shirt. “I don’t do well in the summer, Cap.” Tony lies down and crosses his hands over his stomach, closing his eyes. “The heat is similar to Afghanistan. There are days I wake up to the grit of sand in my mouth.” Tony opens his eyes. The stars here are faint. In his childhood, the stars were like frozen crystals. It was magic those shards blinking down from the dark. He wants to show that to Tony.
During the few excursions allowed by S.H.I.E.L.D. by “himself” to acclimate to the world, he wanders the streets just walks with the crowds. There are days he stares down at the sidewalk as he walks and gets lost in the repetitive rhythm. One day as he waits for the crosswalk to change on Madison Avenue, where the air smells of suffocating car exhaust, and there’s an orange stray cat that likes to sit on the branches of those scattered oak trees along Manhattan that look artificial in the city; he watches the people across the street, letting his eyes float from person to person until he notices two girls by the Starbucks. They aren’t doing anything. They are standing in front of the window display stenciled with snowflakes and misted with snow. Perhaps, it’s the way that the snow falls onto the taller one’s hair like snow on a still beating hearth, something familiar. Or, it’s in the way they link their forefingers together. Their rings scraping each other’s, coy and secretive among the changing crowed. The 1920s were his home; there is no other time he ever wanted to grow up in, but they were not good times.
Natasha is silent. Ordinary S.H.I.E.L.D. employees tense before her and skitter out of the room. She makes people uneasy. Black Widow: the resident assassin for S.H.I.E.L.D. For him she is calming, she does not idealize him or treat him with care. She comes to visit him in the gym and aims for his vital organs when they spar. She disappears for weeks and comes back smelling of blood and gun powder. Sometimes, she comes to visit him in his room not to talk just to read a book while sitting on the window ledge. He makes her tea and goes back to reading up on world history. She is his first companion.
He sips his soup. The psychiatrists are frustrated because he does not talk of war trauma or the survival guilt. He refuses, spends his sessions silent and immobile. His mind is his, and he will not allow S.H.I.E.L.D. to violate that.
Tony laughs. “Cap, aren’t you a man with words. Is that how you wined and dined the women in your time?”
“Look, it’s Bruce. He has the most control out of any of us here. I piss people off; I’m good at it, and not once have I ever bothered him.” Tony runs a hand through his hair, dislodging plastered and dust. “What do you think Fury is going to do if he finds out?”
There are no fragments that his memory can cling to. He stands on the sidewalks of childhood and feels nothing. He spends two days there walks through all of Brooklyn and hears no echoes. There is one moment where it seems like a veil rips, and he can see into the Brooklyn of his childhood. Blake Ave from East 98th St. toward Union St. Brooklyn before him with its muddy unpaved roads and new apartment complexes. The smell of hay and manure entangling with the heavy vapour of gasoline. The road slick in the rain. The puddles that formed cocoa‒coloured along the road. A flock of children, girls in knee‒length dresses and boys in newsboy caps running by him. His mother had gotten one for him too, a little worn. She’d stitched his name in golden thread along the back rim. The thread taunt as she pulled it through. He’d leaned his face against the table watched her in the candle light. How the holes in her stockings always frayed even though she stitched then back again and again. He sees himself on the corner where East 98th starts: sickly, skinny, skin clinging to bone, and eyes too large on his emaciated face. He remembers the way his lungs would feel fragile in the rain. The way it hurt his chest. How the wet cough that never went away got worse. It didn’t stop him from being there with the other children, stubborn and angry with a world that didn’t make him right. His mother would come looking. He would see her red umbrella, floating in among the grey and brown of coats and dresses as she searched. He blinks, and turns his head to where his school used to be. It is an empty lot with a single rusted basketball net. The weeds winding through the cracks in a shock of green amongst the ugly grey. He sees a ten-year-old Bucky, leaning on the graffitied wall of purples and blacks backpack held loose in his grip. The wall behind him is a hybrid of a white rabbit with the smile of the Cheshire cat all of the ends of the teeth sharpened to a nightmarish point.
He meets his first teammate Natasha Romanoff in the gym as he destroys another sandbag, splattering sand granules across the floor, one month into his quarantine where the S.H.I.E.L.D. scientists and psychiatrist work out whether he’s going to crack and try to decode the super solider serum. He’s not stupid; he knows S.H.I.E.L.D. has taken DNA and blood samples during his stasis.
He goes back to New York that night. He doesn’t know how Tony finds out, but when he comes back there is a tablet waiting on his bed. The Brooklyn of his childhood digitizes before him in a hologram that grows and changes. The old buildings join together brick by brick and fall away living pixel dust as they rejoin to form new ones. He has the chance to see the world that left him.
“First of all, this is a booty call, and second it’s the star-spangled Captain America.” Steve snorts, cradling the phone between his shoulder and ear he reaches for the sugar.
Bruce pushes up his glasses, closing his tablet, leaning back into the couch. “Humans can be cruel, Thor.” Bruce knows that best of all. It is why he excludes himself from publicity events because the days after there news reports of the Avengers putting citizens at risk by letting Bruce be free–that perhaps they should consider locking him up or put an end to him. Bruce is never angry; he just shrugs and smiles, says that you can’t change their minds, and that’s okay. I have you guys. There is an underlying sadness to it, a slight defeat.
He lets the silence fill in the room. Bruce has a tank setup by the window for a Veiltail goldfish. The colour of molten orange and gold. Its opaque tailfins sway in the water like a curtain in a delicate breeze.
“Sir,” Jarvis interrupts as crisp as always, even though Steve understands that Jarvis is an AI he still looks up at the ceiling when he talks. It’s polite. “Chickens hatch in 21 days, sir.”
Tony calls him in the morning as he is making a cup of tea. “Cap have you ever had sake? I never remember how much I like it until I get to have some here. Rhodey won’t drink anything because he’s the government’s boytoy and is on ‘duty’. If I had known he’d be such a bore, I would have brought anyone else.”
“From me, Sir,” Jarvis replies from inside the car. “I assumed that you would do quite a bit of shopping.”
It is easier to live when he isn’t living under the microscope of S.H.I.E.L.D. doctors and scientists. No one asks how he is feeling or whether he slept. No one tries to psychoanalyze him. Tony gives each of them a floor that they can hide in and opens up a communal living room. The tower is engrained with technology from Jarvis to Tony’s collection of robots. The world isn’t hidden away behind cement; it is seen through the glass windows. No one filters the world for him. He doesn’t add much to the apartment at the tower lets it be the way it is. Sterile. Tony comes by sometimes, peers over Steve’s shoulder, and his mouth goes tight. He isn’t trying to be difficult or ungrateful. He just doesn’t know how to make a home anymore. So, he keeps the room the way it came even when Tony starts to come by less and less to check up on him.
“My time is important and because of that they can wait. I’d rather talk to you, what made you want to call?”
Steve hums and dips his earl grey teabag into the water, watching the water swirl with orange. It’s like watching an orange mist bleed through the water.
Bruce looks up. His eyes shift from green to brown. “S.H.I.E.L.D. has been trying to figure out how to make him.” Bruce’s skin starts to turn green. He rubs his arms, and he rock’s back and forth. “They’ve been trying to replicate the super soldier serum too.” Bruce swallows looking down at his feet. “There can’t be anymore of him out there.”
Tony nods a little sad and is quiet. In silences, there are moments he can observe Tony. The lines of face, the curves of his lips, the veins in his arms, and the way his skin and muscle molds to bone. “What would make you happy?” Tony Stark would give everything to the people he loves, and Steve has never understood why that included him. That when Tony asks now, he would find a way no matter how impossible to make it true.
“That is true, I can teach you everything if like,” Tony says soft like a whisper in his ear. Steve doesn’t know what do with the words bubbling up inside his stomach that rise into his throat. “I’m kidding, Cap; I didn’t mean to offend your old prudish wartime sentiments.”
Howard presses his weight against the side of the truck, turning to the field. His dress shirt speckled with splatters of red paint and suspenders off his shoulders. “You have to own what you can do, Rogers. There isn’t room for modesty in this world.”
“No.” Heights like these won’t kill him. Then again, he doesn’t know what will. The super serum changed the limits of his body, and now no one is left to tell whether those limits have ends.
It is. It is now that there aren’t segregated places; it is now that he can see all types of people on the streets; it is now that when he looks around there aren’t people starving on the streets. He can hear laughter and see smiles. It is.
Howard was right then because the horrors that wait lurking behind the doors of concentration camps will never leave them, and he is right now‒in the 21st century in a different way. The world isn’t ugly. Steve hasn’t learned how to make the beauty of the world his own, yet. He buys the basics: sketching pencils, pastels, pencil crayons, pens and ink, charcoal, watercolour paints and pencils, tubes of acrylic paint, brushes, a mixed media sketchbook, and a few canvasses. It is as he’s holding the reusable bags from the store that he thinks getting home is going to be a problem that Happy pulls up. “I heard you could use a ride.”
What is he to do with the kindness that it is given to him without thought? Steve squeezes the phone and says, “thank you.”
He could lie like he had to the S.H.I.E.L.D. psychologists. It is very easy to lie to people because very few have ever wanted the truth from him. That is the thing about being the hope for people. It makes it harder for them to see the flaws—to see the human. He could lie. “No, I’m not.” It is his truth; the one he has never allowed himself to admit.
Natasha comes in a pair with Clint Barton who he meets in the commissary. Clint sits down in front of him as he spoons up soup.
Howard sits down on a bed in front of Steve. He pulls out a pocket-sized sketchbook, a tin of Dixon’s solid crayons, and a box charcoal. “You’ve gotta learn to live with a little indulgence.” Howard places the items next to his suitcase. “The world gets ugly, so so ugly that you’ve gotta learn to find ways to escape.”
That does not change that Bruce has terrible days. He runs down to Tony’s smoldering lab and finds Tony standing in the middle, rubbing a hand over his mouth and another on top of Dum-E’s claw. The lab is gutted, the wiring exposed and sparking, there are shards of glass from the shatterproof walls around Tony’s testing space, there are parts of metal strewn everywhere and plaster and cement still rain down like dust storm.
Bucky’s hair is filled in with quick strokes. Howard leans over, tracking the movement of the pencil. He smells of smoldered iron and gasoline. “I do alright,” he says, which is true the year of art school helped to refine the roughness of his drawing, but a little bit more would have helped to smooth out the finer details of human movement and expression.
“I’m a good catholic man. I help people. I stay away from vices. I am good to my fellow man. I go to church even though it hates me because I love God,” his is thick and it takes him awhile to get the words out. “So why did he make me wrong?”
Tony looks up. “It’s not everyday you get a man chiselled like a Hellenic statue in front of you, so you left me a little speechless there.” Flirting is a native language to Tony, it comes out without thought, and he knows Tony doesn’t mean much when he says it. He doesn’t mean much, but that doesn’t stop something like steam from curling, soft and gentle, in his stomach. Tony shoves his hands into his pockets. “I just wanted to tell you that I’m going to be on an overseas business trip for a few weeks maybe a month.”
Bruce Banner is introduced to him by Fury. Bruce wrings out the bottom hem of his shirt, and does not make eye contact. He hates being in S.H.I.E.L.D. more than Steve does. The attention on him shifts to Banner who is deemed more unstable. Bruce does not venture out his room unless necessary. Terror spreads when Bruce walks by, which is why he stays in his room.
Steven looks up at his collection. His drawings are not perfect; there are sharp angles that should have been softer, some of the lines have smudged, and some of the colours have bled into each other. He can see all the mistakes that he hadn’t felt his hand make now. His eyes trace over the lines, take in the colours, and faces of everyone. This world isn’t the one he wanted to be in; where nothing is familiar and everything feels distorted, but it is time that learns to live in it. Steve smiles.
“Cap?” The memory recedes and the sting of the night creeps back in. The stars are muted in the night sky like dim bulbs on the verge of burnout.
Steve doesn’t know how to want. As a child, things were limited. Scarcity was second nature to them. People did not thrive in his time. They were all like dried plants looking for a source of water. Brittle and tired. Haggard and ravaged by hunger for life—for more.
There is a rush of steps behind them. Clint, Natasha, and Thor come in with their weapons drawn and stop at the entrance of the lab. Clint slips his bow over his arm and puts his arrow back in his quiver. He squats, picking up an in-progress faceplate for a new suit. He whistles “Oh, this is gonna be expensive even for your rich ass.”
Once he had stood in front of a toy store on East 98 Ave. Nestled in the display surrounded by garlands and red bows were sleek trains, vibrant primary painted bird whistles, spinning magic lanterns, and oil slick marbles. There was a bear on a tiny arm chair with its chestnut fur‒fluffed and white bow tied taunt. He had stood there and not wanted any of it. Want is a dangerous thing during the Depression.
He’s waiting under an awning for the rain to let up on 286 3rd Ave, watching the parade of taxi cabs, and the monochrome bobbing of black umbrellas sprinkled with a splash of colour sometimes. His wet socks, squelching. It’s uncomfortable in the way it brings the memories of the flooded trenches and clothes sticking to skin. Across the street is a store called the Vintage Thrift Store, in the display window is an old drafting table. The wood two-toned brown like wet and dry sand with a drawer in the centre with a brass handle etched with vines. Drafting tables were long gone in the 30s, however for some reason Howard Stark had one with designs and dreams sprawled across it that seemed unfathomable and strange. Howard would toss his suit jacket on the floor, roll up his sleeves, sit down in a chair in front of the table, and sketch away into the smoke from his cigar with his whiskey glass by his elbow. Steve buys the drawing table for 200 dollars and carries it all the way back to the Avengers tower. He puts it under the bay window where the light is the best. Everything looks artificial, the bare bone white walls and dark bark floors around the table. A clash of styles, he runs his fingers over the shellacked surface, and it fits in just fine.
He strokes the stick across the white page in sharp crescents. “Hm?” His fingers are stained black at the tips.
His mother holds his face, gentle and soft, as she leans down, so he can see her eyes. “Cushlamachree, you live with truth, and that is a beautiful and dangerous way to live,” her eyes are the blue of a clear winter sky. “I want you to always live that way,” she whispers. He swallows saliva. His eyes blur the image of his mother. His vision wavers. He can’t do that. He can’t.
William takes a breath. “No, Mrs. Rogers. It’s not. This world isn’t made for me, and it never will be.”
Clint laughs, spilling milk and cereal on the hardwood floor. “What you gonna shun your horse nephew, Thor?”
Howard laughs, a snort of a sound. There isn’t much time left until they start shipping soldiers to Europe. Howard hasn’t left the lab in weeks, spent sleepless days trying to mold combinations of metal into resilience and iron plating cars to withstand machine gun fire, while soldiers write their final testaments and give them to the priests and sisters stationed on the base. Steve starts to draw Howard in profile; in the rare moments of serious somber and sleep deprivation as he watches boys prepare for a war. He finishes a few days later and leaves it on Howard’s desk.
“No, that’s not what I meant.” Steve smiles at the slight annoyance. “I mean what were you like as a child?”
Steve smiles. “Go, I’ll join you after I finish.” He goes back to folding the few shirts he owns. There is an emptiness—a lingering loneliness to the base now even though no one has left. The walls have witnessed Private Haynes look at the picture of his little brother and mother every night before bed; Sergeant McCartney lie in his cot with his wife’s ring on the centre of his chest; he tells Steve that he took the ring because no one would know what would happen during the war and that couldn’t let her cling to that ring waiting from him, if he did come he’d put back the ring on her finger, or Sergeant Rook who’d pull out a blue stone and rub it with his thumb, “my kid loves the ocean. She isn’t one to sit still and be clean, you know she’ll be out there in the waves in her new dress looking for sea glass. This one was her favourite. She would sleep with it clutched in her fist while she sucked her thumb. She said that it would help me sleep. It doesn’t.”
It takes a while for him to figure out how to draw Thor. He looks at all of his supplies and nothing feels right. Though child-like, there is an aged air around Thor that does not come out often. It is in his eyes as he gazes at humanity. “Your lives are very short, you age and grow so fast.” Thor stares at him. His eyes are like a galaxy long formed and beautiful; they have seen all, seen lives end and begin, has witnessed the end and rise of civilizations. “In a breeze a tree will stand still, but its branches will move.” Thor smiles innocent and free. “Nothing stands, still not even for Gods.” There are days, dark and few, when there is a numbness that eats at his heart that he goes and finds Thor to spar with. They fight until they split their knuckles and lips, create dents in the training rooms walls and floors. They fight until they can’t get up. Steve coughs up blood that splatters against the grey metal floor like thin paint drops on a canvas. Thor rolls over onto his back, hair stuck to his forehead, face covered in blood as he pants. He can feel the slow warmth; the slight pull of his skin knitting together to heal. They lie on the ground, let the sweat, and blood dry. His body hurts, the cords of his muscles pull painful under his skin, and his ribs ache. He feels okay. He meets Thor’s eye and Thor laughs, curling a hand around his bruised ribs.
“Not all children,” Tony says. It’s a misstep in conversation. For a man who is honest to the point of being abrasive, there are certain things that Tony doesn’t talk about. Howard Stark and anything related to what happened in Afghanistan. “People are built from trauma,” Tony whispers. Steve turns. Tony stares at him blanked faced. “Are you happy here?”
Steve picks up the rustle of sheets. A few moments later he hears hesitant footsteps toward the door. When the door opens the room is in darkness, his eyes adjusts, and he sees Bruce on his bed arms curled around his knees. Steve steps in, turns on the light as Bruce flinches curling tighter around himself. Steve drags a chair over and sets it down in front of Bruce.
Tony scoffs. “We all know the reason why she’s saying that. Instead, how about we question whether we can trust a senator that is endorsed by big corporate oils to push legislations to drill for oil on First Nations lands or nature reserves. How can we trust a woman who has taken bribes and runs on greed?” Tony looks at the camera. “My social life may be frivolous, but I’ve never sold myself for profit, have I? Even I have standards.”
Thor crosses his arms. “It is a fitting response for such slander. It is a shame Midgardians do not challenge each other to battle for such disrespect.” There is a this look that Thor gets sometimes, serious and solemn where the millenniums set into his eyes and dulls them. “It is sad to think that Midgard is filled with people of such low thinking. In Asgard, love is a beautiful thing blessed by Freyja whether between those of the same gender or opposite genders.”
“…Not for a month or more. There is a delay with the parts that were supposed to be shipped overseas, so I’m cleaning that up and looking into other suppliers for Stark Industries.”
“You’ve heard it here America, and Mr. Stark does rise points of authenticity that need to be answered, regardless we thank Tony Stark for taking the time to talk to us on This is America. If you missed this interview you can find it on our webpage this is Mai Kyo signing off.”
He does not call Tony even when one month goes and turns into two. He does not call even when he goes to the rooftop and aches. He does not call even when he sits on the breakfast island and turns every time someone comes into the kitchen. He does not call even when he goes down to the labs by accident looking for Tony, and it is Bruce who greets him confused. He does not call.
Natasha hides her smile into her fist, and he grips her ankle, pressing warmth into her cold flesh as laughter bounces in his chest.
“There has been a lot of setbacks. It is a sensitive matter, so Tony can’t leave-God damn it Tony don’t order more Sake-sorry, Captain I’ve got to go.”
Sometimes, it isn’t. The 21st century is not built from the dreams of children sowed in poverty and despair that felt the bleakness of the world erode and tear the hearts around them. It is not built from the talk of the insomniac soldiers who were afraid of what their unconscious held over the threshold of sleep. There is poverty clinging to the frames of the American dream; racism is hidden but there. There are people that fight for the basic rights of human life and are denied. There are people who take the name of the Christian faith and fill their preaches with hate. War has shifted further into the Middle East and Asia where children suffocate from chemical attacks and parents cry over the bodies of their children, and what was once a country flourishing with life and people is now the skeletal remains of what once was. Sometimes, he wonders if what they fought for was worth it.
Steve lies down. The cool cement chills his spine. “Somebody told me that it doesn’t take a lot to make people happy, and I want you to be happy.”
The night before it is time to board the planes bound for Europe as Bucky and Steve start to collect the little bits of life they have in the barracking into suitcases, Howard stops by. Howard is the epitome of refined wealth. His dress shirt bleached into the white of bone china, and suit jacket pressed into a smooth fabric. Howard Stark has always been an odd thing in a base of dirt stained soldiers that still aren’t used to the way their muscles pull from firing guns. “There is a party for the boys down in the mess hall courtesy of Stark Industries.” Bucky pauses. “Catered and supplied with the finest alcohol and the nurses have worn their best dresses.”
His stomach avalanches down into his pelvis, and there is a gapping hole filled with anxiety in its wake. It’s a different world, not without its prejudice, but it is a better world. It is not like the 40s where shame would cleave his intestines in two, where Bucky would smile, sad and small in their room, as they got ready to go a bar with some girls, and say it was okay; they didn’t have to go. It is a different world, where he has seen magazine covers and TV reports of Tony Stark out on dates with men, and Tony is never ashamed. He smiles, dares the world come after him. There had been a day where the Avengers had watched an interview with Tony. The morning had a laze to it. A softness that left everyone warm and sleepy, no one bothered to change out of their nightwear. The smelled heavy of coffee and sugar sweet milk. Bruce’s face still lined with lines of his mattress. He sat in the armchair with a tablet in hand as he read. His mug perched on the armrest, steaming. Thor in just a pair of sweatpants, hair the colour of trainshed gold in the light, grinning as he drank his morning coffee, asking Bruce how to search up food places on the Internet. Clint on the floor with a box of Lucky Charms hair flattened on one side of his head. Natasha on the armrest near Steve; her feet shoved under his thigh for warmth; the bruise on the corner of her mouth turning to a green in its healing. The companionable moments were always soothing and left a pleasant peace in him.
Natasha stands politician straight behind him. Her eyes meeting his. The people of S.H.I.E.L.D. do not look him in the eye; they stare at his feet or to the side, but then how do you stare at a ghost of the past?
Clint pushes his weight back onto four legs and curses. Clint Barton turns out to be the menace of S.H.I.E.L.D. who in his boredom likes to jump off from support beams and scare new hires. Hawkeye is the second assassin employed by S.H.I.E.L.D. Clint is graceful. He absently juggles clementines as he talks, and likes to throw spit balls to see if Steve has the reflexes that are told in myth. Clint pokes at him for no other reason than just because he can. Natasha and Clint become fleeting stability in S.H.I.E.L.D.
“Tony Stark, would you like to address the comments made by Republican Rader where she stated ‘can we trust a man whose social life is riddled with frivolous behaviour?’ and has once said ‘I won’t buy any products from Stark Industries’.”
He surprises the people at S.H.I.E.L.D. with how he adapts to the world once he finds out the truth. They expect him to break down and never recover. He tells no one that he cries in the shower where the water hides his tears, and his bites his lip until he tastes blood. Everyone he has known is dead, and he is alone. They do not know that the sorrow is always clogging up in his lungs. He is a solider, and survival is engrained. He learns of a history that has passed since his 70-year slumber, of a world that thrived after a war, of the promises made after and not kept. S.H.I.E.L.D. keeps him locked up behind cement where he cannot look at the outside world. He does as he is told, spends his days in the gym, damaging equipment, and catching up with a world that didn’t wait for him.
“Don’t do that. You don’t have to be sorry.” Tony sighs. “I can look at people and know what they want whether its my money, my tech, or me, and I don’t know what you want. It is just confusing, Cap.”
Steve grips his shoulder and pulls him away from the mess, checking him over for injuries. “Are you okay?” He touches the still bleeding cut under Tony’s and hisses when it overflows onto his finger.
There had been a man built of sticks, tall and thin. William Byrne. He’d throw toffees at all the kids in the apartment, drop them down the staircase, and let it bounce off their heads. He’d smile, waving to them when they looked up. The sun would filter through his like light being filtered through amber. William starts to bring clothes for Steve. His mother frowns the first time not taking the old gray wool cloth.
When the robins herald the spring and life comes back once more in blooming bursts where the baby buds start to emerge, he admits that Bucky is dead because of him and that never stops hurting. That he will never know how his mother or Peggy lived after him. He hopes they were happy everyday.
Tony shrugs, shoulder touching his ear. He looks over his shoulder and says, “you need a lot of things, Cap.”
Before he meets Tony Stark, Natasha tells him not to mention Howard Stark. “The Howard Stark you knew, and the one Tony Stark knew are different.” For a man who does not talk about his father, Tony mirrors him quite a bit. Just as Howard Stark was the man of the future in the 40s, in the 21st century Tony Stark is futuristic innovation and a genius of the 21st century. He is twice as cocky as Howard though. Stark is hostile, perhaps he disappoints Stark because whatever stories he grew up with are war myths, and Steve Rogers isn’t sure he can be the Captain America from then. The fact they do not get along is not surprising. What is though, is that eventually they do. Respect is earned through blood and battle between them. Stark becomes Tony, and Captain America becomes Steve. He stops looking for Howard in Tony, and Tony stops looking for Captain America in Steve.
Steve rests Tony’s hand in his left and then uses both thumbs to make circles on the back on Tony’s hand.
“I can tell you that Steve is barely holding it together, he is also hyper focused and is using their Center as an outlet.
One random day though, after returning from his morning run, he opens the phone and is dialing before he could second guess himself.
And on some level he knew Sam was talking with Rhodey, as just how many people is Sam able to confide in?
Steve finds his own change of clothes and fights his way out of the wet shirt; rubbing it along his stomach to wipe some of the evidence away.
Looking back, Steve’s convinced he wasn’t right, but… He knows he’d never willingly leave Bucky, but maybe if he handled it differently maybe he would’ve been more open to the Accords or maybe listened more to Tony.
Every couple of days Steve’s thoughts drift to the letter he’d sent Tony and wonders if it was enough?
Steve pushes his fingers in small concentrated circles, his oil covered fingers slipping over Tony’s skin.
Steve is pleased to hear that Natasha settled with Tony and the others; he wonders about other former teammates as well.
He’s smoothing out the blanket on the table when he hears the back door and Tony’s footsteps in the hall.
Steve supported it as he may have walked away from the Avengers but that didn’t mean he wouldn’t lend a hand for the next crisis.
“Yeah, just washing up,” Steve pulls off a paper towel, dries his hands and tosses it in the nearby trashcan.
Steve’s not sure if he’s happier with the added clothes or concerned that Tony didn’t feel comfortable enough removing them.
He’s also not sure how Sam would react to knowing Tony has been in contact and that Steve’s been meeting with him in secret.
Steve’s almost to the stairs when he hears Tony murmur, “Hate to see you go, but love to watch you leave.”
And the way he says it is so soft and questioning, almost like he wasn’t going to say it aloud, that Steve stops and looks at Tony.
Steve starts to look forward to the day he calls and leaves a message; he’s never nervous that Tony will pick up, knowing that he won’t.
Steve checks the front door one more time to confirm it’s locked and slowly walks down the hall to his right.
He was trying to protect us, thinking if we signed we’d still be autonomous but to the world we’d appear to have a leash.
She started mentioning the masseuse they had on staff, which made Steve uncomfortable for reasons he was unable to explain, but it was affective because the appointment book started to fill up.
He smiles, he doesn’t believe Tony but something about the way he’s standing there makes Steve want to try.
The silence hangs awkwardly and Steve realizes he never responded but Tony offers, “It wasn’t hard for me to find you.”
He didn’t know how to relate his past to what they went through, which just seemed so much worse for them.
Steve grins and isn’t sure what comes over him but he walks up behind Tony until there is barely space between them.
His arms hang by his side, and he tries to project calmness but his hands curl into involuntary fists.
It was a couple of months ago, when Sam stopped by unannounced but Steve could admit that he wasn’t actually surprised to see Sam at his door as he’d noticed Sam watching him more and more.
Steve pretends to look hurt and Sam is so worked up he misses the fact that Steve is biting his lip.
Steve scans the room and realizes they didn’t use anything that needs washing or changing so he closes the door and heads home himself.
He turns on the radio system so the rooms are filled with the soft sound of water lapping at the shores.
Since everything went to shit, or after the fight to end all fights, Tony’s been contemplating his relationship with Steve and how he clearly overestimated their closeness.
The hand in his hair tucks strands behind his ear as they exchange light kisses and short swipes of their tongue.
Steve’s lips part and he gasps softly, fingers never stopping, slipping under the interfering waistband, circling.
The silence that follows is tense and Steve’s heart is beating fast as he wonders what Tony will say.
They do have two small private rooms, one which Sam uses for his office and the other for massage therapy.
He’s all ready to start the convincing when Tony tells him to sit down and he picks up the bottle of oil.
He meets Peggy Carter, and she is beautiful fiercer than any solider. She saves them multiple times. In battle Peggy is dirt smeared, skirt torn, yet somehow her red lipstick is untouched. A warrior. Once in between moving inward in Europe they rest in Wales, they sit in the evening light on the cliffs with emerald tuffs of moss, clinging to the rocks that almost glow in the night. The waves batter against the edge never ending. Peggy in a shawl wrapped around her shoulders. The wind blew the smell of the salted sea. She had turned, and smiled at him. He falls in love with Peggy. He does. There is a part of him, small so very small that is glad that he’s normal—that he can love a woman. That maybe it had been a mistake for him to ever think otherwise. He loves Peggy, he does, and he’s relieved.
“Mrs. Rogers, this isn’t charity. These are all old things that I was going to throw,” William looks down at the scarf, smoothing down the strands, “but throwing anything away in this time feels like waste. I thought they’d be better used here.”
A vase of narcissus’s sits by the window, some of the yellow petals are starting to tear, and the edges are starting wilt into a brittle brown. He’s never liked cut flowers because their fragility gives them days before their decay. Why then do people keep them, when in the wild they are part of cycle of renew and rebirth? Steve rubs a velvet petal between his fingers and it tears. He says nothing.
The fire in his stomach lurches and he can feel his orgasm start and he tries to bury his face against Tony but Tony holds his head and won’t let him.
Steve shit all over their friendship but Tony’s the one that pushed them forward; the phone calls were cowardice because if Steve truly wanted to reconcile he could have gone to Tony.
The three rooms down this hall should be dark but one has a soft glow escaping through the cracked door.
Tony walks past him toward the room they used the week before and Steve follows him, closing the door behind him.
Sam had researched and found a place that wasn’t too far from New York or DC, with the idea that they were close enough if they were needed.
He knows he hasn’t been the best person to hang around, he’s always there when Sam or the Center need him, but he’s always looking for an empty corner or room to hide in.
Time passes but Steve has no idea how much as he’s transfixed by the feeling of Tony’s fingers gliding over his hands.
He decides he doesn’t want to meet with Tony inside tonight and continues down the short hall to exit through the back door and steps out onto the small balcony.
This isn’t my first time working in secret as I’m quite talented for espionage and sleight of hand.”
But he and Steve had never been together so he should’t be this miserable without any special benefits.
In the end Sam insisted that he start an exercise routine in the hope it would get him out of the house and moving.
The phone on the desk vibrates in front of him and since it’s the old ass phone Steve gave him, Tony knows it’s Steve calling.
Steve knows that it confused and upset Sam but Steve couldn’t find a way to tell him that he just didn’t deserve the affection.
But he didn’t know how to advertise his services or even how the services would be received, if it was appropriate and welcomed.
As he pushes open the door, he stops in his tracks when he finds Tony Stark sitting in the corner chair, legs crossed, scrolling through his phone.
Steve smiles and puts his hands on top of Tony’s and forces the fabric down until they’re both completely exposed.
She grabs two menus and two utensil bundles and shows them to a table against the windows overlooking the street.
It made Steve happy to see how at home Sam was and how well the Center was providing a service to the town.
As he enters, he dims the lights and notices that Tony is laying on top of the blanket and is still wearing his pants.
Sam is flipping through a magazine left, turning at the sound of Steve’s voice and leans against the counter; Steve stops at the other end.
He’s calling me but what if that’s out of some strong sense of guilt and he doesn’t actually want to see me?
“He’s never cared about the title and I think he resented Captain America due to his father’s obsession.
His pace is slow as he takes in his neighborhood, which has a few rough patches, but the town has been updating and building itself up.
Tony does something quick with the remote and selects a movie, but before it starts Steve’s phone buzzes.
This is the reason he tries to avoid Sam, the awkward silences are painful because it wasn’t like this before.
It’s not until he’s watched the thrusters of the suit disappear in the sky that Steve realizes he didn’t flinch away from Tony’s slap.
“I have nothing for dinner,” he says apologetically. “But I can order pizza and we can watch a movie.”
Steve’s sitting on the rolling seat, leaning against the wall playing Two Dots on his phone when he hears the backdoor open and a loud “Wake up, buttercup!” before the door slams shut.
As Steve approaches the Center he realizes that he’s not looking forward to Sam’s interrogation and also that the building is in need of new paint. The iron stairs should be replaced too, although he’s not sure how to get rid of those.
Whatever the crisis, it was more important than exploring the possibility of a deeper connection with someone.
And you hold so much respect for the title of Captain America, that I sometimes don’t know where one stops and the other begins in your eyes.”
Then he interlaces his fingers with Tony and spreads his fingers to stretch things out, he pushes up against Tony’s wrist.
Tony stops and really looks at him and Steve tries to hold the pissed off look but can’t and he feels his cheeks tremble with effort before Tony’s pointing a finger at him and chuckling.
Steve flushes as he realizes his t-shirt is stuck to his chest and his pants are pulling across his hips as he turns toward the door.
And right now some, mostly likely, cheesy movie is going to play and he’ll spend the evening with Tony and see where it goes.
Steve had been nervous that people wouldn’t make appointments or follow through with them once they knew it was
Steve has come to terms with how acted and that he’s ruined everything Captain America stood for and is an outlaw.
You’ve been watching out for me and forcing me back into the land of the living out of pure stubbornness because it wasn’t anything I was giving back.”
Part of Steve wishes Sam didn’t point it out though because all the fun Steve felt a moment ago is now gone at the reminder that he’s falling short in Sam’s eyes.
It was located in a two story building which they shared with a pizza shop specializing in inside out pizzas on the first floor, and a sports memorabilia place and dentist office on the second.
He can feel how hard Tony is pressing against his wet pants; he groans and rubs his lips along Tony’s cheek panting.
Steve likes days like this where he can concentrate on each person, give them what they need, and move on to the next issue.
Steve nods feeling disappointed, he hadn’t realized he was looking forward to the possibility so much.
Sam says as he walks out onto the balcony and Steve watches him pull out his phone as he walks down the stairs.
They had worked continuously for weeks to clean it and brighten up the interior with a coat of paint.
Steve grins but before he can relish the reaction he caused, Tony rubs his hand across his dick and Steve moans and buries his face in Tony’s neck.
It seems like an endless loop of self examination with all his failings on display for him to pick over; but Sam seems satisfied that he’s up and out so Steve keeps running.
“You keep flirting with me,” Steve says in a whisper as he grasps Tony’s t-shirt and leans towards his face.
As he’s washing his hands a hand clamps down on his shoulder and he jerks to the side, turns and pushes his elbow up all at the same time.
Sam had listed everything he was doing wrong to deal with the aftermath of the battle and rescue mission.
Steve rakes his fingers down until they are pushing at the base of Tony’s back; Tony groans and Steve’s hand stutters to a stop before concentrating on that area.
The second floor was the main area, however if a veteran was unable to climb the stairs, Steve used a second office on the first floor.
He licks his lips and presses firmly, moving his hands slowly down Tony’s back until he reaches his waist and then goes back to his shoulders.
He doesn’t want to deal with Wilson or local law, he just wants to slip in and out so they can just be Steve and Tony before anyone calls on them to be something else.
It’s still early, so it’s a dull brightness seeping around the shade and it only takes him two tries before he’s convincing himself to run.
His mind wanders, the book not keeping his attention and he ends up staring out the window thinking for a few moments, only to startle awake to the alarm on his phone reminding him of Tony’s arrival.
In addition to the bulletin board, they taped a few in the bathrooms and picked up plastic holders for the tables.
And then I come along and he just wanted to tear me down to prove that I’m not as perfect as Howard painted me to be.
Steve squeezes his eyes shut for a moment before turning the volume up trying to drown out his thoughts.
The trees are tall, the sort that wouldn’t fade but turn into brilliant colors in the fall; Tony thought the artist in Steve would’ve appreciated that.
He was just aware that his persona was everywhere for months, but like so many things he found in this generation, it was easily forgotten when not shoved in your face every moment.
His thumbs moves in tight circles on Tony’s wrist before flipping his hand over and rubbing across Tony’s palm.
So I read up about hand massages, might have practiced on Pepper, she gave me a passing grade, so it’s your turn.”
As he hears the door shut he collapses down and rests his head on the table in front of him; all the tension gone.
It clangs a little as one of the wheels stick, but he moves it so he sits across from Tony, in a corner of his own, with the massage table to the left between them.
Sam isn’t squinting at him while trying to decode his mood or trying to force conversations, and Steve isn’t actively avoiding Sam.
