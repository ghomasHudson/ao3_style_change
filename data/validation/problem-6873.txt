“Yes, you did,” Tony says, kissing Steve’s cheeks, the bridge of his nose, the line of his jaw. “And we haven’t broken it in yet, baby.” He spreads his legs wider to reveal a blue plug, reaching for it with his flesh hand. With an exaggerated pop, he pulls it out demonstrating his twitching hole. Empty.
Riri mimes her lips shut and eyes Steve again. The distrust is obvious. Steve doesn’t blame her. He ran while the rest of them were left with fixing the rest of the world.
The words sounded ominous to Steve. It was too close to a goodbye. In the last few weeks, Tony's spent most of the day sleeping, consciousness fading in and out. He still had the energy to talk about futures— schematics, plans for the kids, what sort of Christmas and birthday presents they might enjoy.
No, no, no, that wasn’t true. All he wanted was for Steve to be back. But not like this. Not with Steve’s mouth drawn into a frown.
He put the yellow shirt back to the drawer then wiped his eyes. His vision was blurry, but that’s alright. He moved forward, grabbing a handful of Tony's jeans and placing them into the box, topping it with a set of Tony’s running shoes and taped it shut.
Now, I know better, because he looks at me the way people look at ghosts they learn to live with. He's resigned; there's no end to the haunting. Ok, alright, I tell myself every night like clockwork, when he cups my face and brings our mouths together for a kiss.
He washed his face and uncapped the mouthwash. He dumped the contents down the drain. It would be too easy to drink it. Too easy to go down the hotel bar and drink.
Eden sighed heavily. “Like Imogen, I also went on a date. Uh, the other day. First time in forever and then I started crying before the bill came. She asked about my interests and the first thing I thought of was my late wife.”
He calls Tony over and over again. Tony shuts his eyes, filters the words out, and retreats to the space in his body that Steve cannot touch.
Maybe, one day, he could stand in this mirror by himself and smile genuinely. For now, he shivered and stared at himself.
He saw his friends everyday—that’s what Natasha and Clint were, right? Friends. He had those, now, Bucky would be proud.
Tony fiddles with the jukebox, makes a frustrated sound before handing the barkeep a fifty dollar bill then getting a set of coins in exchange. Steve shakes his head at the show of wealth. Tony’s never really flaunted it.
The sun was up high, bearing down their scalps. A hot summer in New York. They just finished viewing an exhibit from the MET. Tony gave running commentary on an exhibit and promised to show Steve his collection.
I don’t…” Harley was fuming now, hot tears spilling from his face before he stood up, shrugging Bucky’s hand off. “Why do you have to do that, pops?”
Steve turned to Peter. The space under his eyes was dark. Steve knew he wasn’t getting enough sleep. JARVIS noted that both Peter and Harley woke in the middle of the night and when they couldn’t go back to sleep, they worked on engineering projects.
In a moment of clarity, he mimicked her gesture, then struggled to get the words out. “It’s left to me. I have to do something.”
Steve is almost jealous, almost, but he knows that Tony hides his feelings under an untouchable mask.
They had been in the Mansion to talk, one final time. Steve was pointing his fingers at Tony, just inches away, screaming at the top of his lungs.
It’s a fact of life, and staring at another man with a scar running from the corner of his temple and down his cheekbone is a reminder of that: no lives spared by grief.
It’s warm. Temperature controlled. The left side of the house there are large buckets of soil, fertilizers, and an installed table filled with floral trimmings.
He pats Steve’s ankle, makes him remove the boots. Tony peels off his socks. Navy blue. Tony got it for him just months ago.
God, Logan and Peter can’t smell them. And the Tower is empty with just Tony’s old ghosts reminding him of his failure, haunting the halls.
“What are you saying?” Steve paused, hands on his hips. He looked powerful. A man with authority. Tony always admired him. But something seemed to have dawned on him because his eyes widened, and his lips tried to work, but no sound came out. The fight seemed to evaporate from him.
Happy greeted them in the garage with a solemn tilt of the head and opened the doors to the limo. Peter hopped onto the shotgun seat, glasses still in tack. Happy looked at him for a moment before catching Steve’s eye in the rearview mirror. The car began its ascent into the streets.
It's still Tony's favorite, and it's nights like this, when Steve is quiet, when he's pleading, that Tony could retreat deeper and deeper inside of himself and pretend this is alright. That this is the Steve he's always known.
Steve bites his cheek, imagining Riri and all the other youth who found themselves without family having to fend for themselves. “She was alone?”
She leads them through the halls until they are on the east side of the Compound. Beyond the automatic double doors is the track and field.
Instead, he ignores Rumiko’s watchful eye and pretends it's just the two of them. Steve settles between Tony’s legs, caressing his sides, counting his ribs, one, two, three… Tony’s broken them so many times in battle—with the Mandarin, with Doom, with whatever crisis came up, it’s rare for Iron Man to come out unscathed. And yet, Tony’s always persevered, and came out on top, better than before.
But he didn’t know how to go on without Tony. His eyelids were so heavy and his chest ached. Steve didn’t remember dropping to the floor. At one moment his forehead was resting on the tiles, then he was sitting on the bathtub, one cheekbone on his knees, arms around his hairy shins. The water fell on his body, dropping over on his long hair.
He couldn’t make empty promises. How many times did he have to beg, scream at the world, yell and pray at a God he’s been thought to seek during difficult times.
Steve’s thick cock springs free from his boxers—and one that Tony gave him—slightly crooked, but huge, and Tony drools for it. He needs it in his mouth, inside him. Tony traces the bulging vein, index finger running up and down the shaft to play with the leaking slit. Steve’s gorgeous, period. He’s so many things: hero, idol, man. Public, observed by the world.
They still had their respective rooms in the Compound. But Tony had to go to the city at least twice a week for SI. Steve thought it would be nice to spend their off days in Manhattan. Be with the city’s grime and bustle.
“You will, Tony. You’ll wake up next to me. We’ll have breakfast together. How about I make pancakes with almond flour? The kids can join us. We’ll watch movies all day. Just like last time,” Steve whispered, voice hoarse. It didn’t capture the desperation he felt. “How about I make you another crown? You want carnations again?”
You can't keep chasing after ideals, Steve. If we live in ideals, we'll never get anything done. Never satisfied. There's no moral high ground when we've all got blood on our hands. That's the price, Steve. The currency is sacrifice. It's your ideal that I hold onto now. I can't meet that expectation of heroism or make things right. But I will try.
Carol and I found a bakery on 54th Street. It didn’t taste the same though. Maybe that’s the thing, Steve. Things can be replaced. Hell, I’ll even go as far to say
His kidneys will cease function. There will be chemical changes to his body. The pain will transform into a dull ache, and perhaps, the next time he sees Steve, it will be by living with the memory of them on the 890th.
“Oh, and leave me to work out here in the sun, huh?” Tony finally looks up, and his lips twist in an exaggerated frown.
Steve can't  help but trace the curve of his head and the hair on his nape. He’d like to draw this picture, he thinks. Tony. Even if he’s faceless in the sketch, Steve would know it’s him by the slope of his back.
“At ease, soldier,” the man shakes his hand and tips his hat when Steve gives him a questioning looking. He’s not a solider anymore, hasn’t been in a long time. He wonders if he’ll ever stop standing too straight or in parade’s rest. If he’ll ever strip those habits that categorized him as one.
Five years later, the book he left open is still on the same page. He reads the passage carefully, then puts the book aside.
The smile is all wrong. It’s saccharine to the point of aggressive, as if this version of Steve wants to rewrite all the memories Tony has of them together.
It has been too long. Steve ducks his head and pulls up the chair across from her. She lumps further into the rolling chair. “Trouble sleeping?”
“I did my best. I tried to live up to his memory,” It kisses Tony’s wrist, pulls him closer. Tony thinks It might be crying too. “I’m so sorry.”
“Can you,” Steve starts, hating the self-deprecating tone of Tony’s voice. He’s always been harsh with himself, always thinks he could do better, and he holds himself to an impossible standard. “Can you be gentle with yourself?”
Tomorrow, they’ll start the day together. Steve will grind the beans and Tony will hop on the counter. They’ll share a cup of coffee on the porch because the weather allows for it. Then, Steve will move the chicken coop across the property and spread the compost bin by the gardens.
“Don’t you think it’s harder going through your life denying the fact that you have a place to come home to, Steve?” Bruce sighs and gives him a pained expression.
“I’ve seen this look.” Samuel takes another drag and tilts his head, studying him. “Running away or running home?”
Steve heard that somewhere once. Likely from Natasha, maybe even from Tony himself. It’s no wonder they wine-and-dine their business partners. But here and now, Tony’s offering a little part of him, and no matter how small, Steve will take it.
Steve unwraps the paper, seeing the blue tint to the bread, and hopes he doesn’t look disappointed. “They didn’t have —“
“I am,” Steve says, unfolding his hands to caress Tony’s wrist. He pauses for a beat, then squeezes Tony’s hand. “Would you prefer otherwise?”
There used to be a team, a ragtag group of distinctly different individuals who might not ever be friends if not for their very specific skill sets being needed during a crisis. They used to win. Even with cuts, bruises, lives lost, Steve did the calculus for each fight, and he had determined that they’ve preserved.
“I sure do like the feel of your come dripping out of my hole throughout the day. You like that, don’t you, Steve?”
He was somewhere in the outskirts of Gatheru, gazing at the stars and cursing them for bringing a Mad Titan to their planet.
“I still have your toothbrush too.” Tony confesses, and feels stupid and ashamed because Steve left and they’re fighting, and yet he’s here about to stick his dick inside Tony.
He reached for the bottle of soap for the first time in three years, flicking the cap open. Steve breathed the smell of lemon blossoms as it filled the bathroom. He squirted some of the body wash onto his palm, squeezing with more strength than usual. Unused for years, the lid was slightly clogged.
Steve mixed the pancake batter and made eggs on the other pan. The bacon sizzled on the back burner and he ran up the garden rooftop to fetch some white carnations. He wasn’t gonna cry. It was gonna be alright. It was gonna be a good day. Tony’s feeling better today. They’ll spend the morning in bed and just be happy. Yeah, Steve could do this. He’s not crying. He’s not.
Man and the machine, that’s what Iron Man is. In the end, I don’t know if there’s a difference anymore. Not with Extremis, not with this big fucked up brain that thinks it can take on the world. Carry on, you might say. Well. This is it.
He looks back at the cherry trees withering  against the winter winds. The rose bushes beside his balcony are still unpruned. Its are canes damaged and twiggy. He wonders if Tony or Bruce will take care of it before spring comes.
Tony leans forward, his hands, in a steeple prayer in front of him. He claps it twice, then rocks it across the middle of his mouth. “Fine. How are you?”
“It’s everything else. I was betrayed by you, my best friend. You were the first face I saw in this new world. Do you know what that meant to me?” Steve reached out and put his hands on the side of Tony's face, rubbing his thumb to the corner of Tony’s eyes. Steve’s words were hurried and fierce when he said, "I’m angry, and I haven’t forgiven you, and it hurt, Tony. To be in the cell and have you on the other side. You didn’t even show me your face.”
“I know you are. I know.” She gives him a sad smile. “So, on a lighter note.” She snaps her fingers twice and a holo-screen appears. “There’s been sightings of Clint out there in the West.”
Tony accepted his fate in the way Steve could never understand. He sighed, feeling lost and hopeless.
“What did I say wrong now, Tony? I simply asked how you were,” Steve says, voice gruff. He takes another bite, then another, shoving the food into his mouth so he can’t say anything else.
He parts his legs as far as they can go. Steve tugs them further apart, wordlessly. He fumbles for the side table, and smiles triumphant at Tony. He holds up the bottle of lube like a trophy.
He’d try. Steve was trying, even if the effort meant letting go of things he wished to carry for the rest of his life.
“I came on my own.” Steve raised his hand to stop the door from shutting. He had that concerned quirk in his eyebrows, and Tony remembered that there had been a time when that look made him feel safe.
Steve felt the same exact way whenever he watched Tony in a tank top inventing something in the workshop. His hair would be crazy and he’d smell like a mix of his expensive shower gel, sweat, and oil. Seeing Tony in an inventive workshop binge always made Steve hard.
Steve moves faster, hitting Tony’s prostate, hoping that the marks will stay until he gets home and can trace the lines.
It was just after six-thirty. The kids were still asleep and wouldn’t be up to get ready for school for another hour.
The dish tasted sour in his mouth. There was something missing. He couldn’t figure it out even after checking the recipe a dozen times. He stared at Tony’s handwriting. It was one of the few things that belonged to Tony that wasn’t digitized. His handwriting was a mix of thin spidery lines, but when he wrote in cursive, it was all large and loopy.
Steve bent down to pepper Tony’s face with kisses. Tony licked the water on the seams of his lips and opened his mouth up for Steve. Their kiss turned heated and Steve couldn’t take it anymore, so he pulled Tony from the floor. “Wrap your legs around me.”
“Yeah, you can say that.” Tony’s on the tip of adding something else, and Steve would know, because he’s spent years studying Tony Stark. Fighting beside him — fighting with him, being in his periphery, and being away, watching him from a far instead. Now he’s back again, like the world can’t keep them apart. What the chances that it would be the two of them who survived the Decimation?
“You like my pout, Steve.” Tony winced, sitting further up on the propped pillows. He moved a bit, rearranged himself, and let the kids eat.
He offers Tony the spare key, and they walk back out to fetch their bags from the truck. Steve has his portfolio bag for the shield and the battered duffel. He hands Tony his own luggage, then they make their way back to the hotel in silence.
Right outside the glass panel is Bucky with a shit-eating grin. “Stevie, Stevie, Stevie. God, you put all of us to shame with your antiquated sensibilities. It’s like all the talk about men in the bathhouse is true.”
Tony. God. Tony used to hold Steve’s belly, teasing him about his defined abs and kissing his nipples. Steve would flick him on the ear, then haul him up and place his bare ass on the counter. Then, they’d kiss for what felt like hours before they both hopped to the showers and fuck rough and tender and good, and so full of love.
Steve nods, standing to toe off his shoes. His jacket and shirt are next, fast and efficient, followed by his jeans and boxers, which he tears off in one quick movement.
He buries the feeling of thirst, forces it to subside. It isn't a difficult task once he focuses on the burns on his back or the scabs on his hips.
“Fuck, alright, alright.” Steve lifts Tony’s hips up higher, practically twisting him in half, and shoots his load. “I’m coming. Tony, I’m coming. Fuck.” He keeps rocking and Tony’s heart doubles in size because there’s Steve’s come inside him, marking him. He feels it all the way up to his belly and he clenches to keep Steve there.
Even in darkness, he's that ring of light that surrounds the moon, and Tony's just a moth who spins around him. He's always liked to fly and he's always been fond of handsome, almost untouchable things. But there is this surprise, always, when Steve gives in, meets Tony's greediness with his own stubborn need to please and pleasure the world around him. Tony's lost again, just a waddling thing in this moment, revolving around Steve, again and again. True and certain, the same way he knows nothing good might come out of this tomorrow.
“We gotta debrief,” Steve said, voice hoarse. He ignored the twitch in his chest at the sight of Tony. His hair was matted with sweat and dirt. A drop of perspiration trailed down his temples, but he was grinning, proud, unlike the tense months that led up to this moment in HYDRA’s main base.
“We cannot say for sure until after the surgery, Captain Rogers. Mr. Stark will need radiation afterwards, most likely for a few months.  It's best if we prepare now," Mr. Lee answered with a nod. "We'll give you a few minutes and return for prep."
The office is strategically placed to see the Atlantic. He can hear the waves roar, and it’s so unlike the quiet hum of Tangiers. The waves here crash against the cliff, and as night continues to fall, the sounds become ominous.
“No, no, you come first.” He doubled his effort on working Tony's cock until he was shuddering. “Come, sweetheart. Come on me.”
Tony shakes his head and releases his grip on the handle. “It’s fine. I like driving fast too. You’ve seen my sports cars.”
No, stop, he shakes his head and settles on the lumpy mattress, cross-legged. He’s stripped down to his boxers and day old shirt, placing the tobacco on the paper and rolling it. His jeans and jacket hang on the back of a chair, limp.
Steve prepared for battle. He looked at himself in the mirror, showered, shaved, put on a crisp white shirt and slacks.
Just once, Rumiko had told him, so he might as well be greedy if the only repercussion is Steve’s heart breaking once he walks out the penthouse.
He was informed that a parade was scheduled that day since the memorial service wasn’t open to the public. New York did its thing—it marched and mourned the death of their resident superhero.
When Steve’s tears are finally dry, he lets Tony turn him to his side. They face each other, barely an inch between them.
“Ty? Eh, we keep it casual, he’s probably already fucking Sunset as we speak.” Tony grabs his hand and doesn’t let it go until they're out into the sidewalk.
“I thought you already thought of me all day.” He grabbed the back of Tony’s thighs, angling it up. Steve got on his toes and began thrusting hard.
Morgan and Steve found it scavenging around the tomato plants one day while they worked on harvesting the basils and squash. He tried to turn it away the first few times, annoyed that it was picking on the garden. But then, it meowed, its brown eyes deep and dark, and a little part of Steve remembered that he used to love things he didn’t even know. He took chances.
He used to smile a lot, growing up, his mother always told him so. Between asthma attacks and bloody noses, he grinned and asked a million and three questions about why the world was the way it was.
The world, the universe, made something of its self, and even in war, these mountains were still standing. He turned to Tony, overwhelmed with the need to get closer, to be a little braver, to lean against the suit. Tony's faceplate pulled up with a hiss. There was a grin plastered on his face, so wide and deep, his gums were showing. "Hungry?"
They measure him up, and he can see it in their eyes that these women, as young as they are, already know loss, and they’ve likely seen battle from the way they hold their bodies tight at his arrival. Both flank slightly closer to Tony.
He twisted his hand on the head, squeezing slightly to draw out a moan from Tony. For all the times they’ve fucked, Steve will never get tired of hearing him beg. Steve scooted down and pulled the trousers to Tony’s knees. He kissed them both, trailed kisses up his thighs, then swallowed Tony’s dick. He flattened his tongue and sucked, eyes on Tony the entire time.
Steve pads close at the sign of permission and sits on the foot of the bed. He’s rock hard. His pants are so tented that it should be uncomfortable, but he ignores it to look at Tony’s heavy balls, the shine of the ring attached to it. Steve wants to lick it back and forth, wants to twirl his tongue in circles and discover what feels good for Tony.
Steve pulls his fingers back, stroking Tony’s lower lip, his goatee. He rubs the bridge of Tony’s nose with his index finger, tracing a straight line from the space between his eyebrows to his cupid bows. Steve bends, offering another kiss that feels too much like a farewell.
“What the hell do you think you’re doing?” Steve yells, hands clenched to his side, battle-ready. His face twisted in horror.
And yet, here’s Tony Stark walking beside Steve Rogers around the city. Their shoulders brushed as the crowd pushed them closer. Steve wanted to lace their fingers.
“So, this is why you’re drinking again,” Steve decided, like this explained it. “Is this penance, Tony? Is this so you could forget? If you keep drinking, you’ll kill yourself.”
Home is what soldiers looked forward to; it’s a dream to chase. Back in the Army, men of all walks of life held onto this idea of home. It’s true now.
Steve works Tony’s nipples between his teeth, licking and biting until they’re hard and swollen. He files away every moan, the way Tony arches his chest, silently asking for more. He'll turn this over later, pull it out of a metaphorical folder, flip through the pages, analyzing each inhale, every kiss, every whimper.
Pepper barked a wet laugh. “You know he would, right? He could do it. Tony could have probably figured out how to build a time machine. He’s brilliant. Genius,” she trailed off, looking around the workshop and all the things that belonged to a dead man.
Steve couldn’t comprehend how he’d never hold onto Tony's waist again or trace the scars from the arc reactor. He couldn’t bear making lunch when Tony wasn't sitting on his chair, a tablet in hand, Morgan on his lap. Peter and Harley trading barbed quips with him.
Half the universe is gone and the world keeps turning. In the beginning, he suspected that they’d never recover, but slowly, the world stitches itself together, and while the heaviness of loss is present in each street he’s ever walked, Tangiers reminds him that there’s still a life to live.
Peter and Harley were fourteen and twelve, respectively. Steve wondered how many more birthdays Tony would miss. Forty? Fifty? How many more Christmases would Steve spend without him?
In all the ways possible. He should build a machine that runs projections of everything that involves Steve Rogers, but Tony knows that half the fun of being with Steve is never predicting him, even if he is predictable.
He strips his clothes, folds them, then drops them by the edge of the sink, where he spots Tony's electric toothbrush. It's white, plain, and a contrast to Steve's own multicolored plastic brush. He stares at it as he brushes his teeth.
Steve licks along his crack, warm breath ghosting over the creases of Tony's thighs. "God, Steve," Tony says as Steve makes circles with his tongue.
I’ve told you about my five nightmares. Everything is changing. All things change, that’s why we couldn’t play by the same rules.
New life, the waitress in the cafe had said, and he tries to hold onto the phrase, hoping somehow the sentiment would transfer when he enters the gates of the Compound.
Steve traces the lines of the buildings across the street with his index finger. Up, down, up, down, left, right. His results are a set of lines that somehow makes a picture. When his focus returns, he catches the circles under his eyes and the frown that follows it.
He was inclined to put a bullet in his head and make his own Pollock on the bathroom mirrors. Hooking himself to terminal stations and wiping away the data wasn't enough. Maria Hill was right, he should have just taken the gun, blown his brain out, and let them all deal with mashing the rest of his bits. He should let the red drip along with the hardened water spots on the bathroom mirror.
No, they didn’t know where they were. Or who he was with. No, FRIDAY couldn’t track him. They don’t know, they don’t — he wasn’t dead, he couldn’t. Steve hadn’t apologized for being a miserable asshole yet, and Tony’s supposed to call him out on it and they’ll fight about it again, that’s how Steve had imagined it, so Tony couldn’t be dead, he couldn’t —
He was so fucking angry at the world. He’s helpless to the rage inside him and this bloodthirst. He wanted to put the Captain America suit back on, rip out the stars and stripes and just go fucking kill something. He felt sore all over, overwhelmed by his own tears and the sound of Morgan and Harley’s sobs. Peter was stoic as ever beside him, a hand on Steve’s shoulder.
Tony is forced and pried, made into a bed of rotten fruit. Once sweet, once innocent, a barely there, ripe thing that remains of their friendship is now black and green with mold.
Tony reaches behind him, pumping Steve’s cock and rubbing at the head before positioning it over his hole. He’s loose and Steve can easily slide in, but Tony makes him work for it. Steve’s always up for the challenge. They kiss and rock their bodies together until finally, Tony grinds just right and the head of Steve’s cock slips in.
“I said,” Tony heaved a sigh, wide-eyed but calculating. He twisted his body and leaned closer to Steve. “Feel free to say no and tell me I’ve misread this. Everything will be fine. We’ll still be friends, teammates, lead Avengers together—”
Except, ever the futurist, his vision proved false because Steve is dead. Feasted on by a hoard of wild pigs.
“Oh come on, nothing to heavy over dinner, Cap — Steve.” Tony braces his shoulders down and waves his fork at Steve. “Comer. Bon appetit. Kumain ka na. Eat, eat! How many more languages shall I say it?”
There’s endless rooms in the little brownstone. Steve didn’t know where to go. He stood in the kitchen, motionless. He could escape and tell his children they’re moving away. Out of New York. Out of any place Tony’s ever been in.
“I don’t think we have to do anything but live. Try to be happy, even though it seems improbable,” Another attendee said.
If all Steve had was a shadowed version of Tony, one that continued to live in memory, he’d take it. If he moved on, he was scared he’d stop thinking of Tony. Could he be forgiven when he didn’t feel fucked up with misery? It didn’t mean forgetting. He couldn’t even bury Tony. He wasn’t going to start now.
He pins my body to the bed and grinds his growing erection on my hip. He murmurs with sleepy eyes how much he loves me, how he’s so thankful we made it work past SHRA, how much he misses me every time he has to go do duties as Commander.
Tony glanced at Rhodes and Pepper. Both averted their eyes and glanced at the open windows instead. Outside, New York kept screaming, rocking around in this blue-green sphere.
“Oh, Steve. You’re just perfect.” Tony pulled off, slicked his dick, pressing his blunt head forward. Steve waited until Tony was fully seated before fucking his ass back in long, deep thrusts. “I sure do love it when you beg.”
But Steve still struggles to sleep in a bed not made for him, alone, without another heartbeat to focus on. Back in the war, men slept on top of each other in thin cots, or if they were lucky, bunks. On the run, he’d always have Wanda’s, Sam’s, and Natasha’s breath to count.
“I came to tell you that I was wrong when I said that we can't help people who are determined to destroy themselves. I should have tried harder. I was fucking broken up, Tony. You weren’t on my side. I know this isn’t the first time we’ve fought, but this was the first time I thought I’d really lose you. That there’d be no coming back. I was scared. I was upset.” Steve turned, his eyes nearly black in the dark. There was nothing but the crack of the light to illuminate them. But it was obvious that Steve was warring between rage and something else, something bitter.
Tony does the same for Steve, carefully tracing the single tear drop down his left eye. He kisses Steve’s eyes, then moves onto plant a single kiss on his lips, rocking up and down.
“Yes, yes,” I repeat again and again. I moan. I groan. I get a hand on my cock and it finally begins to feel good.
“I don’t know how to do this. I don’t know if I want to do this anymore,” Tony cried, scratching at his arms. He was restless. He wanted to be up and on the balcony, away from Steve. But his body refused to cooperate. “Sometimes I think I’m jealous of you,” Tony admitted. “Of how you’re motivated to do what’s right. Of how you’re so sure, Steve. But what's right isn’t always what’s best, and I don’t need you to understand that. I wouldn’t have changed a damn thing. In fact, knowing what I remember now, I’d do it again, and I can’t be sorry for that. But I am sorry about what happened to
He tries to put as much space as possible between them, but Steve rucks up the sheets and pulls Tony to his chest. He hums, murmurs promises, how he’s grateful to be alive, how things will change now that he’s back. How Timely will be much better now that he’s here.
Pepper caught him by the elbow as they entered the facility. Steve hadn’t been there in months. Steve was too busy sitting beside Tony’s hospital bed and this facility brought back happy memories that only tasted sour in his mouth.
But we are a dying breed, so it doesn’t matter. Steve will have all of us, and he’ll reach the last of us, and then, he’ll have no Tony Stark to hold at night.
As a boy, he egged Bucky to jump into the freezing waters at Coney Island in the middle of a harsh winter. Responsibility has never been his strong suit, especially not in the face of a challenge. Steve had shivered on the subway ride home and promptly got pneumonia.  He was so sure that his mother would fry him and never let him out of the apartment again.
Tony scrubs his fingers on the napkin, sets it down, then looks at Steve too carefully, like he’s afraid the next words might be too much to bear in this fragile friendship— what did you even call them, teammates, ex-teammates.
He should have listened to Tony. He shouldn’t have made too much noise. Shouldn't have called the people to get their rifles and claim this town.
Tony finally understood that it wasn’t drinking that was a slow death. It was love, and its failures to mend things, because love wasn’t enough. Tony thought of the most banal sentiment when it came to Steve.
They’re inside the Mansion. Steve has Tony pressed to the rubble, broken wood and plaster digging onto his back. He could push Steve off if he wants to. Steve might be an inch taller, larger in mass, but with Extremis, Tony could have their positions flipped.
Stars are just balls of gas that stay stagnant until they die. When they've reached the expiry date, they blow up and take everything with them.
“Cap, we fought a handful of battles together and saved the world, yeah, but you don’t need to mother hen me. Don’t worry so much.”
Steve’s stomach rolls as he waits for a response. He might never learn to keep his mouth shut, but he’s finally realizing that he’s stupid and reckless, can’t keep his emotions constrained in a lock box.
Tony was sure he’d lost Steve, even before he bled out on the Courthouse’s steps. All evidence pointed that it may not be true, but Tony didn’t have the courage to ask. He tilted up, counting the lines on the edges of Steve's eyes.
Steve stood awkwardly on the sidewalk, hands in his pocket, then, they were sitting by the shoreline, side by side. Steve looked anxious and confessed some blurry things about the war. Tony doesn’t know, he thought Steve was nice and helpful. A goddamn Captain.
“I mean, is this just a pit stop, a place to get supplies and gas, or are you staying?” Kate puts an arm around Riri’s shoulder and juts her chin at Steve.
Tony Stark was a man who knew he was handsome and brilliant, but he seemed to doubt that he was wanted. Maybe that’s Steve’s fault. They didn’t have a good start with at the helicarrier. Their camaraderie seemed better after a few missions, but those have been far in between. SHIELD tried to keep Tony Stark out of their business, only using him as a consultant when it benefited them.
Pitt'o Nili has Steve’s belt and leather gloves. Steve is incredibly handsome. Blond hair, a golden hole framed by a thick rope.
He stays very still, and thinks that if he puts enough effort, he might find anger inside him, the will to hate this man. But it’s a flickering fire now, smothered by Steve wrapping a hand on his throat.
SHIELD established standards of handling crime and crisis. He wasn’t allowed to question Fury’s authority and had to blindly trust the man. He didn’t understand how Natasha and Clint followed along. He was a soldier, so he was well-versed on keeping his mouth shut. But Steve reached the limit when his powers were just used to contain crises without question.
“You shouldn’t be like this,” Steve says, firmly. He twists to turn to face Tony. “You shouldn’t allow strangers to take you places. You need to be more careful.”
“I don’t doubt it,” Tony replies, closes his eyes, and for the first time, he wishes this to be a dream. “Walter died. Reed has the body. They’ll hunt for the rest of you. You should leave. Don’t come back. You can’t.”
“I was paralyzed with fear!” Steve's hand slipped from Tony's face, down his shoulders, then his arms. His fingers skimmed the bandages on Tony's wrist until he found Tony's hands. He laced them together, not tugging, just touching.
“You have the kids.” Natsha stepped over a ladybug, heels clanking on the wood of the garden’s pathway.
The man turns, a sheepishly smile on his face. God, there’s still sleepiness in his eyes and it’s obvious he hasn’t showered, wearing his clothes from the night before.
Steve settled on the rug by the massive Christmas tree. It smelled sharp, refreshing, almost tender. He hurt all over. Holidays punched all the tender parts of him.
The last man who had saved him is the same man who kicked his ribs and forced him to see their friends execution.
“Suck my dick and get it wet, Steve. Then, if you’re good, I’ll fuck you with it.” Tony pulled Steve's hair, hard. “J, blackout mode on the rooftop. And
I smell like come. It drips down my thighs. I don’t express displeasure anymore. Steve is still on top of me.
Tony forces himself to breathe in and out. He sets the wrench down, kicks the hammer beside his foot, and opens the door.
“Merry Christmas, Tony,” Steve whispered, closing his eyes and tucking his head further into the pillows.
He thinks of Tony, and if he’s somehow doing what the rest of the world seems to insist on: living this new life post-Snap. If any man could do it, it would be Tony.
Tony licks his lips. "In all your travels, I’m sure you’ve had a bunch of different dishes. Is Menudo still your favorite food?”
Tony looked so perfect under him, all pliant but full of spitfire, like a cat, screeching its paws and begging to be petted. Steve pressed the heel of his hand over the tent in his pants, assuaging himself for a moment, before zipping Tony’s fly down.
He settles further into his yellow plastic chair, trying to map out where to go next. A week and a half in Marrakech and he decided to go to the Bay, after a month in the mountain towns. His pocket-sized notebook  has a map of the globe in its front and back pages. Suddenly, the world seems small. He's taken to shading countries he's been through. Over half the map is shaded and it serves as brief comfort that there's still more to do -- more of the world to see and learn from.
“It’s alright.” Steve scrubbed at his thick, dirty blond locks. He tried to smile at his friends. They all nodded understanding, eyes in sympathy. Steve wanted to crawl to the ground. Six feet under and stay there.
This was the natural order of things, both of them screaming until their throats were filled with terror for all the half-lies they’d spoken, and then kissing, as if hurt and pain were simply a rite of passage to obtain something more sublime.
Tony bought it for him their first year together. It’s a vintage piece, large, and looming, taking a good portion of the living room. Against the wall was their collection of records purchased in second-hand stores all across Manhattan.
“It doesn’t go well when we try to talk.” Steve grabbed a cup from the cabinet, dipped it into the water, and washed Tony’s hair. He was focused on the task, scrubbing Tony’s hair with gentle hands. He washed off the shampoo and did the same with the conditioner.
You looked terrible with blood on your cheek and your ruined suit, but I found that I couldn't take my eyes off you. Even when it hurt to look at you.
“Er, Tony.” He cleared his throat again, trying to focus. There were cowlicks on the crown of his head. It was a riot of soft curls. “Can I come in?”
“Yeah,” Natasha laughs, a short, quiet thing. “He has the patience for it. The mindset. He’s like them. He loves them, really. He entertains their thoughts, their questions, encourages their experiments even if they blow up a lab in the process. God, the first time Riri blew a hole in the wall, she thought she’d be in trouble. She started her apologies, she looked like she was about to cry. But Tony just laughed, and offered her pointers.” She returns to the table and chugs her mug. “He disapproves of any Red-Room methods, but really, he’s the one keeping it together.”
Somehow, between missions, commissions, and serving as SHIELD's director, I was able to pick up a book. An old one I read long ago. I found a copy in the library at the Avenger's Mansion. Somehow, the battered copy still survived. You're probably wondering why I was there. Well, is it too nostalgic to say I miss who I used to be before all of this...this mess. I made my choices, it's done. But anyway, Steve, you and your speeches. It was never my strong suit, that was always you. So let me tell you what Baldwin said: “There is often something beautiful, there is always something awful, in the spectacle of a person who has lost one of his facilities, a faculty he never questioned until it was gone, and who struggles to recover it.”
Steve almost laughs. “No. I’ve seen the world and it keeps turning and turning. The force of loss and grief isn’t enough to keep us still.”
Tony runs out the workshop to quickly halt at the sight of Miss Barnes with blood on her cheeks, pistol still raised towards Jessica Drew and Ben Parker. Red Wolf stood beside her, his own colt pointed at the duo.
Steve sorted out the closet. He rearranged his own clothing, hanging the blazers and suits. There was too much space.
They were still babies to Steve. Might always be babies to Steve forever even if they kept getting taller. Even if their voices get deeper and they don't want to talk to their papa about childish things. They were
There would be more experiences without Tony. There would be endless moments of pure happiness when one of their kids does something incredible—maybe Peter would follow Tony and revolutionize a scientific field. Maybe Harley would do the same. There would be so many more moments of misery until Steve found his way back to Tony.
“You should have finished it,” Tony mumbled. Everything hurt. There were endless images slotting into their rightful places. But it wasn’t just snapshots; the memories were calibrated with context and emotions, reminding Tony exactly what he felt.
Before they decided to head out to a diner, Victoria knocks on their door, holding two glass containers in her hands. “Pot roast and potatoes, courtesy of Samuel’s daughter.” She chews and blows her bubble gum. “If you ask me, her mother was the better cook.”
Steve bobs down, flattening his tongue, pulling out to lick at Tony’s balls before sucking him down again. He fucks his fingers deeper, thrusting harder, rubbing at Tony’s prostate.
He sighed, letting the cool drink calm him. Carol was a friend. She didn’t mean any harm. She was checking on Steve, making sure he’s still sane and about to—
“Yes, you will, baby.” Tony said in a low, raspy voice. He still has his eyes closed, but at least there was a soft smile on his face.
“Those kids were too boisterous for this town. What I tell you, Stark. This town is full of crazies.”
French has always come easy, and while he’s picked up a little bit of Arabic in his travels, it’s not enough to hold a drawn out conversation. But that’s alright, he doesn’t talk much these days. With this line of work, there’s no grand speeches or televised lectures in packed auditoriums.
How many times has Steve seen that mole in the showers, in the Mansion, between missions, when Tony’s stripped off his shirt, walking to Steve shirtless? Walking away from him? Walking to someone else?
He’s still trying to figure out how to take his steps with Tony. What steps he’s allowed to take, what minefields have to be avoided for them to ease into friendship again.
The former is Steve and Bucky’s favorite, and growing up, it was always a treat, a burst of robust flavors. But affording it was far and between, so now they’ve taken to planting a tree in the yard. It won’t bloom until next year, or even the year after that, but it’s a start.
He scrubbed a hand over his head, frustrated. It’s been over a fucking year. A year was nothing. 12-months, 365 days sleeping alone in bed, 8760 hours mulling over the fact that Tony died in his arms.
Tony seemed fine to let him do so as Steve twisted to catch his lips, Tony shook his head, placed both his hands on his hips. “Work for it Steve. I do like to see you focusing all your attention on pleasing me, come on,” he said, amused.
Morgan received her presents from the Bartons and the Langs. Then from Steve, a set of professional paints and a large canvas. She thanked him with a grin and a promise to paint on the terrace tomorrow.
“You don’t love me,” Tony whispered in the dark. It was true. People were braver in the shadows, when they could hide.
“Yeah, I know, we gotta trust them to do that work. And I do. But. Well.” Tony punches Steve’s arm and rolls his eyes. “Don’t think I haven’t seen you eyeing Sam’s shield.”
nevermind that Tony’s a stranger he met at a party. He swallows, eyeing Steve up and down. “Being in the Army and all, right?”
“Tony,” he says, voice relieved. Like waking up Tony Stark isn’t a mistake, but a dream. Tony thinks Steve said something about dreams last night. “Good morning. How are you feeling?”
Steve choked up on the words swirling in his mind. He flattened his tongue, swallowed. He didn’t want to sob. Not today. No, no. He wasn’t. He nodded, determined, and placed a tortilla on Morgan’s plate. “Thanks for being here. Merry Christmas. Let’s eat.”
“MR. STARK!” Tommy runs full speed, circling them on and on before stopping beside Natasha. “Quickly, Dr. Reed Richards requires your attention at the town hall.”
The pain under his eyes is manageable. It grows steady as the hours pass. He is used to hunger now. But it's been over a week since he last had a meal.
Tony bites the inside of his cheeks. His arms erupt in goosebumps, and he scratches at them with trembling fingers.
Tony entertained the thought that maybe he could be like Maya Hansen and slit his wrist, watch the waters turn pink with his blood. Except, he wouldn’t be like Maya where it’s all pretend, a photograph doctored to trick him.
Tony groans. “I can’t deal with all this social media stuff of Spider-Man and the Torch kissing all over greater New York. On the Statue of Liberty? Really?”
For the first time in forty-one months, he settled his eyes on the corner of the cabinet. There was Tony’s wedding ring.
, wants to praise Tony, want to tell him how beautiful he is and how Steve's always wanted this. But Tony will hear his voice, and that can't be, because it's against the rules. Rumiko might as well have taken a knife and removed his vocal chords.
“Yeah?” Steve caught Tony’s mouth, biting down on his lower lip,  before inching a hand between them. He grasped Tony’s cock, squeezing at the base. “You’ll think of me today?”
He looks at Rumiko, smug, and wonders whether she’s vindictive enough to hurt him this way, put Steve in his place, and realizes—no, she isn’t cruel. This was supposed to be fun.
Clean up is quick and efficient as they all help. Bruce takes all the plates and rinses them before placing them in the dishwasher. Tony puts away the leftovers as Natasha deals with the pots and pans. Kate shoves a dishrag at Steve’s face and signals for him to wipe down the table. Riri stands there, smug.
Back then, there were so many times he thought he overstepped and believed they were fighting. Now, not so much. All those little arguments between them seem minuscule, like little creeks in the valleys compared to the distance between them now… They have an ocean of unresolved problems, and while Steve’s swam out of Potomac, he’s never liked the feel of coming up for air for the first time.
Before being on the receiving end of each other’s shouts, raised fists, a relationship littered with regret in just a matter of weeks.
Me too, I fucking hate you and I hate this, and how I still love you, fuck you, Steve, fuck you, he doesn’t bother uttering the words because Steve already knows. Has known.
Steve swallows, bends to unzip his duffel bag, then grabs a pair of shorts and an old cotton t-shirt he purchased from a second hand store. He turns towards the wall, back ramrod straight, pulls the shirt over his head, then thinks, fuck it, he’s a grown man.
“We’re gonna be family for-real, for-real even though you’re already my pops, but today it’s even more real because there’s a wedding.” She grins. “Now, let’s do this.” She skips through the short walk way before sitting beside Thor.
he thinks. He bites his lips and doesn’t share the rest of his thoughts. He doesn’t want to upset her tonight. Steve leans back against the sofa attempting to ignore the rising despair in his chest.
Pepper stood up, hands balled into a fist. Her heels clang against the floorboards. She looked vicious; she only reserved that when Tony pissed her off. “I’ve reached my limit. I can’t have my godchildren calling me every night telling me they can hear their father crying. Or the fact that you’re not sleeping and you’re breaking punching bags every night. I know you’re grieving. I know it hurts. I know—”
“Well, you look like a good man,” Tony smiles at him, and this time, it looks real, unlike all those staged photographs for the magazine, or the way he grinned for the camera while Stone spanked his ass and pulled on his hair. Tony is a dream and he deserves to be treated well.
“Oh shut up, Steve.” Bucky opens the door and hops out. “Before you even feel like you should have done more, just enjoy this. You can plan your 10th or your 25th.”
All in all, they spent the last few months holding their breaths until the baby—Peter Benjamin Rogers-Stark—was born.
Tony fiddled with the telephone instead, running the keys, dialing the front desk only to hang up on the second ring.
His feet take him to his old office. He pauses on the entrance for a brief moment, then turns the knob to the left, and pushes the door open.
It’s worth it, he doesn’t say. He keeps his mouth shut and stares at the photos on the wall. Again and again, his eyes drift to Tony and the original team from years ago.
He couldn’t recall the conversation. He was too distracted by the promise of belonging somewhere, a team, even if it meant secret missions and being a military guard dog.
He’s painfully aware now: home isn’t a place; and it’s trite and rather boring, people have repeated the sentiment a million times.
Steve pressed the head of his dick in and pulled back. He sighed; he didn’t want to hurt Tony. He scanned the room for anything that they might use as lube and gave up. He cupped a hand under his chin and spit, hard.
Damn you, Rogers, Tony doesn’t say. He bites back the tears, seeing It battle-ready, so much like Steve.
“Looks like you finally learned how to do your hair the way you wanted.” Steve smiled at the two thick strands of dutch braid resting on her shoulders.
“No, no, no, he’s still working,” Rumiko says, unbuckling her harness. “Let me give you something to do in the meantime.” She sets the strap-on by the edge of the side table, then crawls over to the head of the bed frame, rearranges some pillows, and opens her legs for Tony’s face. She pulls Tony by the hair, dragging him to her cunt.
Another sob escaped him and he bit at his knee hoping it would distract him from the tightening on his chest. His heart shivered with each passing day. He wondered if it was even there at all.
“Oh, here we go again. Is it gonna be a heavy emotional confession or are you horny? Because, baby, I could definitely go for a quick round at the outhouse.”
If he wasn’t in the office, he ran around the High Line, sketched Stark Tower from several cafes, and spent time walking all around Manhattan and Brooklyn documenting all that’s changed in his little notebook.
Natasha looks at him too closely, suspicious even. “You mean to say you have trouble sleeping every night then, given that you can’t stay in one place. Traveling the world after a big event. That’s what you did after Chitauri.”
“Nevermind them,” Miss Barnes says, hurriedly, pulling Tony towards her horse. “We’re riding to the dam.”
“Fuck my mouth.” Tony kneeled down and guided Steve’s cock past his lips. He began sucking and swirling his tongue over the head.
Steve traces the shape of my eyebrows. A stream of tears fall from his cheekbones. “Better, that’s better.”
The bed still smelled like Tony: spicy, a hint of something masculine, but also a tang of medicine, an acidic touch. He stopped smelling like grease and motor oil since the recurrence. It didn’t feel real.
I look at this stupid window and hope Namor took care of your body. You’re at peace. Wherever you are.
“That’s not the only way to fight climate change you know,” he deadpans. He claps his hands and disappears from the room. “Shower and dinner. Easy, easy.”
Who are they without the chase and that hunger for a future, a better, brighter tomorrow? They call him a futurist, but Tony can’t predict where they’ll end up. If it’ll be Steve six feet under in Arlington, or him, burning with the rest of his machines.
“No, no.” Tony shakes his head, pointing at Red Wolf, looking anywhere but the shining badge on his chest. “If you’re suggesting — no, you’ve got it all wrong, Red Wolf. Rogers and I — he’s not. You’re wrong, he’d never. Not ever.”
“God, all this time and you still never learn.” Tony takes another bite and shakes his head. “It’s because you just boiled all your food growing up and didn’t have salt, huh?”
Tony took all of this, catalogued it in his new brain. A new memory. There was nothing to override this time.
Tony used to love that. When they’d take baths, he’d run his fingers all over Steve’s shaggy hair. Then, he’d kiss Steve’s shoulders and scrub his back.
“Because the rest of the adults in the Compound can’t be left on their own,” Riri nods, sagely, eyes dancing. She breaks out into a grin that matches Tony’s own.
Steve used to watch Tony all the time. He was like a moving target, shifting constantly running around the brownstone, skipping to the living room with Morgan in his arms.
Steve tried getting Peter and Harley to join him for morning runs around a track in Red Hook or in the High Line but they slept late and preferred sleeping in. All Steve’s attempts to institute a bed time was ignored.
When he read about the war, he remembered Steve offering a handshake in the battlefield. Then, the EMP.
Even walking was hard, but he loved it when Steve carried him. He always had a tiny smile on his face whenever Steve would lift him up from their bedroom and bring him to the bathroom. There was no shame in Tony’s eyes when Steve washed him in their tub.
Because damn it, he was going to live to see his children graduate from college. He’d be there for every heartbreak, every wedding, every engagement party. Steve will live to see all the smiles. One day, he’d have grandchildren and he'd cherish and dote on them in the same way he knew Tony would have done.
Steve backs away. He should be used to waking up alone, but it never gets easier. Eat alone. Sleep alone. Be alone. It isn't difficult. Not at all. But it isn't pleasant when there's no distraction.
“I don’t kid around about being fucked, Barnes,” Tony yells then laughs before flicking them off. “Now fuck off.”
Steve smiles, and there’s something too soft about it. Too public. They never do this. Ever. But Tony writes it off as fitting with the moment. “It’s me. Steve Rogers.”
His hot, wet cheeks pressed against the armor’s golden chest. The arc reactor shone bright, twinkling.
He’d always wonder if Tony stood in that very spot. Did he have his arms crossed? Was that before he met Steve? But he’s reached an impasse. Their home—no, the world was like a culs-de-sac, everything returning to Tony.
and there’s the cold memory of sleeping alone these past weeks while Steve’s on the run, and Tony’s tasked to hunt him. Tony returns to their bed, alone, cold with no one to pet him to sleep because Steve packed half of his clothes in an old army duffle bag and left.
He swallowed and it felt like forcing glass down his throat. He should apologize, but he didn’t know how he could be sorry for this.
Tony hums, rising up on one arm to finger her. Steve shouldn’t look. He shouldn’t. But what if that were him instead? Tony eating his ass, fingering him open, telling Steve that he’s lovely and how he’s always wanted Steve like this, flushed and panting, just for Tony.
He wondered if this how Natasha Barnes felt when they showed her the late Deputy Barnes’s scalped head.
Steve sighs, makes a move to touch him. Explain maybe, and there are words coming out of his mouth. Tony cannot hear him. He cannot see this man wearing Steve’s face and looking at him like he’s hurt, as if Tony is at fault for not commending his actions.
The medical bay doctors, Chang, Lee, and Ramirez had said something much more medically accurate, but Steve couldn’t hear it over the ringing in his ears. His face felt flush and there were spots of black and white dancing across his eyes for a brief moment, until he saw Tony’s frown in his line of vision.
He sets the towel by the bed and quickly pulls the shorts up. The waistband snaps in place, and then Steve’s hanging up the towel and pulling at his own sheets. He turns off the lamp.
Steve pays in cash and signs the paperwork, then he’s promptly handed a set of car keys.The salesman pulls away at the last minute. Then, with a small smile, he places the keys on Steve’s open palms. “It was my father’s, you know. He liked camping. We used to put a cot in the back when we’d go across the country. That’s why the seats are missing.”
“Steve. Do you know that saying about the grandfather’s axe? What do you think is happening when you keep using BARF? You stop reliving memories if you change them.” She inched forward, her high heels echoing in the workshop. “JARVIS, what’s the stats on Steve’s usage.”
I nod, wondering if there was ever a choice, whether whoring myself out like this could still be justified as survival.
“This one is gonna be a mouthful. Wouldn’t stop barking in the car at every other thing.” Tony warns with a sigh. “But I suppose I should be used to the chickens you have by the now.”
“No good smoking in front of kids.” Steve gestures to the alley a few feet away and plants his back on the brick wall. It smells like rotten food, and there’s the distinct smell of animal carcass, but it’s surprisingly tidy with the trash bins all organized further down.
He can’t help but wonder if there’s any of him in her too, whether that will come around as she grows up and becomes who she is meant to be. He knows she’ll be her own woman, not a person bound by both deeply profound and paralyzing legacy. He can’t wait to meet the woman she’ll become, too. Steve hopes like hell that he’ll be around for that.
“And what are you doing, exactly?” Steve dropped another kiss, this time on Tony’s nose. He smiled, giddy and drunk with love.
He watches Steve, cataloguing changes in his gait. There’s still that small scar on the corner of his mouth. Tony doesn’t believe in magic. He’s only persuaded by the observation, by seeing things in material forms.
“Pops, you alright?” Peter asked, stepping away from where he and the armor sat side by side on one of the workshop tables. It looked like he was working on his web fluid project.
Tony smiles, and there’s a slight coloring to his cheeks, as if he’s still not used to being complimented.
“Of course, you matter. You’re—important to the team.” Steve stumbled over the words, wishing he was the one sitting on Tony’s bed and pushing his hair back.
Steve is shocked, but only for a moment, then, he's licking his lips with a fleeting smile.  He moves on top of Tony, lining their bodies, pressing their chests together. He’s inches away from Tony and he’s about to say something, instead he uses his thumb and forefinger to force Tony’s mouth open. He spits into Tony’s panting mouth,  slow like honey pouring out of the jar. “I prefer you spitting at me in another context.”
No, Tony doesn’t say. It’s too much effort to shake his head, to scream his refusal, to beg Steve, no please no, this isn’t you, what happened, let me help you —
Natasha sat across for him and finished off Carol’s drink. “Grief is a hard thing to deal with, Steve. It’s alright to take breaks. You don’t always have to be so…”
“The truth is, Tony, I don’t want to be alone.” He cradles Tony’s face, like they’re lovers and this is a confession. “I want to build a better world. That’s the dream, I can’t do it without you.”
“Tony, please.” Steve turned around to see Tony petting for something in his discarded pants with a huff. He grinned, holding up the small bottle of lube. “So you just really wanted to fuck me in the roof top, didn’t you?”
Tony's hand scratched at his back, hard and insistent. Almost pounding. There’s a beat that stretches, on and on, and Tony gasps, scratching at Steve’s shoulder.
He walked her all the way down to the door, where Harley and Peter waited by the steps. Overcome with the pain of grief and gratefulness that he still had his kids, Steve pulled all three of them into a hug.
But that’s if Steve needed help. He was fine. He was here grudgingly at Pepper and Bucky’s insistence.
He swallowed, blinked, once, twice, trying to shake the intense feeling of emptiness away. No, he wasn’t going to do that now. He’d break down in their room later once all their friends left for their respective homes. Once the kids were asleep.
Harley shoved a headset over his ears, barked out some codes, and then, Mark XLII moved from across the room. It stood over Steve, it’s long, powerful torso looking menacing and all at once, so much like Tony. Steve could picture Tony in there, with a smirk, as the armor offered a hand.
When he was drinking himself stupid, his memory was fuzzy, a nebulous montage of images. But one thing has always been as clear as Attilan-by-the-Sea, Steven Rogers is a good man, and Anthony Stark is fond of him.
The rest of the world is stitching itself back together, and little by little, Tony’s rebuilding his team. Riri, Kate’s, and Bruce’s dedication is evidence of that.
“Tony, no.” Steve choked on the words, shaking his head. He kissed the back of Tony’s head, his temple, his cheek. “No. Not yet.”
“I’m allowed to change my mind, you know,” Tony follows up when Steve can’t think of a reply. Tony clocks the layout of the room, probably making note of the exits.
The tears flowed. Steve shook his head trying to regain his composure, but he didn’t have to, right? He just lost Tony fucking Stark. The kids were crying and holding onto each other. Bruce wiped at his fingers. Natasha tilted her head, fists clenched. Thor arrived late, as always, but had a hand on Clint’s shoulder.
“Come for me, Tony. Come, sweetheart.” Steve shot forward, circling his hips to rub Tony's prostate.
He moved all the way to Los Angeles for Tony. He upended his post-Army life to see him. Maybe, Tony will join him in New York. If not, Steve will learn to like Los Angeles.
“I’m asking.” He walks two steps forward and waits. Tony’s wide eyes track his movements. “If you’d like to come. Like you said, see the country. How it’s changed. How it keeps going forward.”
Steve ran his hand on the nearly dilapidated garden. The gardenias and dwarf carnations were blooming, growing even though he’s long abandoned tending to them.
“Steve, I’m sorry,” Tony said, completely broken. That was another memory that appeared before he started drinking. “I’m so fucking — I couldn’t take off the mask.” Tony set a hand to Steve's wrist and pressed on it, feeling the pulse of his heart.
“Well, I can confirm that the team already thinks we’re fucking and secretly married at this point.” Tony wrapped an arm around his shoulder and pulled him for a wet kiss.
Only this time, Tony chokes on a sob when Steve ducks down and licks his lips. Tony surrenders. Steve coaxes his mouth open, and they’re wrapping around each other, kissing hard and fast, equal measures of longing and spit. Tony nibbles on Steve’s bottom lip, receiving a groan and squeeze on his ass.
He didn’t touch the “house clothes” that Tony wore around the workshop. That was a mission for another day. For now, Steve grabbed the boxes filled with professional clothing and brought them to the attic. It took him three trips in total and he stacked them on top of each other.
“Isn’t that too much coffee you?” Steve asks gesturing at the newly refilled cup. It’s plain, black with a half a pack of raw sugar.
Steve bites his lips, feeling his face heat, suddenly, he’s too aware of the proximity between them. It’s just like being in the car all over again. Tony, there, alive and well, and somehow talking to Steve. The smell of his aftershave and grease mixing together.
The leaves will change soon, and it’s gonna be another year gone by. Another year alive. Sometimes he can’t believe it — can’t fathom the fact that he’s survived a war that happened in another milenium, lived decades fighting aliens and villains, and now, somehow, has patched himself up and is growing older and older by the day.
Rumiko plants a hand on Tony’s back, easing his face down to bed, and then she’s lifting his hips higher, picking up the pace. “Fine, honey. If that’s what you want… but remember you’re not allowed to come yet.”
Missing Tony Stark was like living with a missing limb. Steve was in constant agony. This was what dying then waking up the next day to live it all over again. It’s pitiful.
It isn’t until the following week that FRIDAY confirms that the lake is safe for skating, so they go into town, purchasing skates for all three of them. They spend the entire afternoon circling a frozen body of water, wondering where the birds have migrated to and wishing for their return. But for now, Steve enjoys the cold because he has Tony to keep him warm.
“Tony, look at me for a minute.” Steve pulled the box from his pocket. With a laugh, he presented the ring to Tony. “How about we make that statement true?”
Tony reached up to twist Steve’s nipples. “You’re thinking too much. Stop. We’re supposed to be fucking.”
“Yeah,” Steve says, because he knows the platitudes are ineffective by now. “But you’re still here. The rest of you.”
Suddenly, Steve’s transported to a memory of him and Tony at Clint’s far, a stack of logs and an axe between them. Steve, heaving with anger and needing to break something, Tony, justifying and trying to get Steve to listen. Steve, too stubborn to hear the words leaving from Tony’s lips. Tony, too heartfelt, a man with so much heart, begging him to understand. He just wanted to have a defense system. A suit around the world, he said.
“I’d rather not have them wait at the hospital. Come here.” Tony beckoned him forward, kissed him long and deep. This wasn’t right. Tony didn’t have to kiss him like this—like goodbye, because they had all the time in the world. “I’ll be okay, baby. Can’t let Morgan grow up without me. Can’t let any of the kids run you down and bully you into spoiling them.”
“Couldn’t even afford salt,” Steve says, honestly. “Just grateful I had food on the table to feed my skinny bones.”
“That’s not what we meant, Steve.” Carol cut in, voice soft, attempting to diffuse the situation. Fuck, he always had to make things worse didn’t he. His temper came in waves, usually drowning him in rage whenever he had to put up with this bullshit. “We meant that you could use some time off to process everything. It’s just. You just threw yourself into caring for the kids, managing the Avengers again. You need—”
Tony inhales, savoring the tobacco’s sharp flavor. It grounds him for a brief moment. Something tangible, felt. Unlike the shadows that linger in the night.
Steve snaps his hips faster, not concerned about finesse or being a good lay. What the fuck does it matter? Tony won't know it's him. He's panting, whether because he's angry at himself, this situation, or Tony, Steve doesn't know. He narrows his universe to just this moment, a bunch of nerve endings registering pleasure, cancelling the heaviness between his ribs. He wraps his other arm around Tony, putting all his weight on the arches of his feet. Hugs him. Imagine that this is intimate and anything but a game.
“Not enough time, Sheriff,” Tony says, covering Red Wolf’s back. He spares a fleeting glance at Steve — It — still standing half way inside the workshop’s foyer. “Go, please.”
Steve ducks into a restaurant down the street, eats the kimchi and orders some fried rice. Taking out his notebook, he sketches a photo of Tony Stark while waiting for his meal. He prepares for the evening, double checking his list of supplies.
Peter’s been silent since they left the penthouse. He still had the glasses on. He hasn’t said a single word. Bruce and Bucky tried to engage him in a conversation, placing a glass of water in his hands and a plate of food on his lap.
“Glad to hear it.” Steve peels off Tony’s socks, stuffs them into his sneakers, then removes his boots. He offers to carry both their shoes, but Tony just rolls his eyes and grabs his sneakers from Steve. They walk side by side, barefoot.
“You’re laughing at me?” Tony pouts. “And here I thought I’d get you cleaned up.” He tuts, spreading his legs wider apart to reveal his filling cock. He raises a hand, urging Steve forward.  “Come on, I designed this for my husband.”
He pulled Tony into a hug and buried his nose over Tony’s hair. He’s been complaining about migraines and headaches the past couple of months but that seemed like a side-effect of not sleeping.
It’s two syllables that make Steve’s tongue hit his two front teeth every time he says the name out loud. His lips had the tendency to curve into a smile whenever he uttered the name. Tony. Yet these days, Steve often finds the word difficult to say.
Tony splutters and begins questioning Johnny about Richard Reed’s new research project, which makes Peter sigh and grab Johnny by the waist to swing them both across the lake.
Steve’s fingers knead his neck, bringing his face to suck again. Tony groans, flattens his tongue, licking and bobbing up and down. He’s so incredibly hard, the sound of blood rushes through his ears, and there’s just Steve. Steve. Steve. Spit trickles down his beard, onto his chin, and he feels the wetness hit his thighs. Steve groaning and praising him like they don’t have an ocean of problems between them. They’re not stupid enough to believe a good fucking will solve it all.
Rhodes eyed him with something like pity. “We’re here to help, Steve. If you ever just want time for yourself, you can let us know. We’ll take the kids out for a day, a weekend.”
“And I know you, Tony,” Steve exhales, feeling like they’re in the verge of something important here.
He didn’t know how long he stood on his knees, sobbing and soaking Tony’s sweatshirt. Steve couldn’t hear Tony’s heartbeat anymore.
Steve stops his ministrations and exhales a shaky breath.  A minute passes before he’s groaning, and there’s the sound of his zipper being pulled further down. “Fuck, Tony, what you do to me. Fuck.”
“Steve, I told you about making us a happy ending. Promise me you’ll do that. Everyone wants that, me included. But baby, life doesn’t always roll that way. I hope you’ll never have to play this. I hope like hell that I’ll get better and be in remission. I want to spend the rest of my life with you and our kids. I was thinking we might get a cabin in Pennsylvania or move to Monterey. Get a house by the beach. You’ll paint the sea and I’ll be there right next to you. Shit. Steve. You’re the best thing. The part of me I’m proud of. Steve, if you do play this, it means I’m gone. And that’s alright, darling. We’ll all get there. It’s just sooner for me. I wish it wasn’t. But I hope— what a world. It’s been a dream, Steve.
Steve bites down his surprise. This is new. Between the two of them, any disagreement resulted in both Tony and Steve doubling down and barking at each other until one left the room.
Steve comes on my face then kisses me. It’s sloppy, but I’ve swallowed so much of his come that I don’t grimace at the taste. He towers over me and licks me open.
Steve knows that shade of blue, the way he knows that there's a latch on the back of the faceplate, the way he knows that Tony programmed override protocols with Steve’s special access code. He wants to pull Tony up and close until they’re breathing each other’s exhales, want to arrange Tony on his lap and have him sit on his cock and stay there, let Steve do all the work because Steve would take care of him, anticipate every hitch, every groan, would please him and fuck him until Tony knows it’s only Steve who can ever have him like this.
“I’ll be fine,” Tony’s eyelids are heavy and he's slurring, and he's so gorgeous with these large eyes and the attempt at a goatee. Steve fingers his whiskery mustache. “You’ll take care of me, won’t you? You said you’re a good man.”
Governments were in shambles but the people still moved on. This was the future Steve believed in: chase after a standard that’s better than the rest of them. Chase after a way of life nearly unreachable without stubborn motivation. That’s what Steve does when he’s met with an improbable task: dig down, double down, fight harder. Victory doesn’t matter as long as he’s fighting for the right to be otherwise.
He was never going to go through loss again. Steve wouldn’t bury his kids. He would die and they’ll have to put his body to rest. He won’t suffer the pain of burying another person in his life. This was the last time.
Steve cried, holding her against his chest. “I know, baby, I know. Me too. I’m so sorry, I’m sorry. I’m so damn sorry that you have to go through this. I know. It’s alright, let it out.”
That’s all it takes for Tony to pummels himself forward and swallow Steve down. He moans, shivering, putting one hand to pull at Steve’s thighs, the other, bringing Steve’s hand to his head. It’s been too long since he’s tasted Steve, felt him, was this close to him without yelling or bracing for a fight. Steve’s cock is a little salty and the wiry blond hairs that tickle his nose. Tony loves it, all of it, Steve, handsome and masculine, the smell of his musk, the sound of his encouraging groans sets Tony to work harder. Pushing to his limits until Steve’s hitting the back of his throat at increasing speed.
“Alright, alright, point taken.” Steve makes a big show of finishing his plate and grabbing seconds just to see Tony’s tentative smile. “Hmmm, good.”
Tony’s face was so gaunt, but he’s still so handsome. Just as gorgeous as the first time Steve saw Iron Man flying in the sky. “Take care of yourself, please, baby. You need to be okay. Because if I go and you’re not alright. I’m not gonna rest, Steve, I’ll haunt you. I swear I will.” A fleeting smile appeared. “Be good, Avenger.”
Steve gets off on the closet town, another thirty miles west. Turns left, right, right, left again until they find the small-three block downtown area. On the corner is a three story hotel, the only one in the street. The vacancy sign has bright neon pink lettering.
My fingers slip and I cut my upper lip. It would be so easy to take the straight blade and slit my throat. There’s no point in waiting it out now.
The woman laughs, and Steve wonders how the act is possible. How it's normal, how it doesn't sound silly, how people are still able to react with happiness or shock that their lungs breathe out and their face contorts into something other than an expression bounded by grief.
Fully dressed, Steve turned off the lights and padded over to the bed. He tugged at the duvet and slipped in.
“This is the hardest thing I’ve ever done.” He swallowed, holding up the flowers and the arc reactor. Steve thought of Tony’s own words to him. “Letting him go is the hardest thing I’ll ever do.”
They're sitting in the destruction of what used to be home and Steve still smells the same way he always has: sweaty, masculine, and if hope had  a scent, it would be this.
“Tony, I’m so sorry. I’m deeply, deeply, sorry. I’m so—” Steve pushed off from the couch and forced himself to stand on rocky legs. He just witness a man learn about his parent’s murder. There were no platitudes to offer.
Tony tossed the tools lying haphazardly on the unkempt bed and reached for the nail gun. He pressed the trigger, testing the rapid release from the chamber. He sat back, propped on the bed, and stared at the bottles across the room like they were offensive.
He doesn't really know if he likes it that way, or if he's just scared to return home — if such a place still exists for him.
Loading the laundry machine took two minutes, tops. But Tony couldn’t be bothered to separate his clothes by color. In the future, all one had to do was dump their basket into a machine, fill it with soap, and press a button. Back in the day, they had to use washboards and mangles, then scrub like crazy.
Rumiko pets Tony’s hair. Steve can’t watch. He doesn’t want to be here. He wants to be in her position. Wants to be the one kissing Tony at the end of every night. Wants to be the first thing that Tony sees in the morning.
It’s not that Steve wouldn’t have expected that. Tony is a fixer. He sees problems and plans a million ways to fix them. This isn’t any different. The world is in shambles and he’s patching his world back together. Steve sighs, his thoughts circle back to Tony.
Rumiko shifts to her haunches, takes Steve’s hand, and sets it to Tony’s lower back. “Do I have to do everything?” she laughs, light and airy, and it’s a surreal moment when her strap-on bounces on Steve’s thigh.
Christmas comes, and stays for the next six weeks because both Tony and Morgan refused to take down their tree. The Christmas lights still decorated the poles of the veranda. Steve decides that he’d like to keep them there because in the evenings, they all share hot cocoa and watch the snow fall from the sky.
He grabs the knife from my remaining hand and I let it go. I stare at him in defiance, just the way Tony would have.
“What’s happening?” Tony asks, cupping a hand over his eyes to see the smoke coming by the Black Bolt ranch.
“And give you all the fun? No thanks. Weren’t you the one who made a speech about doing things together? Well here it is. I guess Fury’s boyband is finally taking off.” Tony sighed, glancing at the windows. There’s the skyline. It’s still too early in the morning for the sun to rise. But New York never slept. The buildings kept twinkling.
Tony smirks. “Some people would say yes. But that isn’t true. You know characteristics of a person. You were in the Army, I’m sure you know how to profile someone. But to know someone deeply? I’m not sure that’s possible.”
Some people just wanted peace and in the yearning, they would take crumbs. Steve’s lucky, he thought to himself, he had friends who loved his children. Who would care for them if anything happened to him. That made things easier.
Natasha passes him a handful of blankets, a flashlight, and two gallons of water. Together, they fill the Land Cruiser with basic supplies. Inside, there’s a thick cot and a spartan pillow for when Steve needs to crash. His duffel bag and the shield follow in last. Steve reaches for the handle and slams the trunk shut with dreaded finality.
He wonders if Steve observed their last breath, if Clint or Bobbi spat on him, tried to reason, or were they so absolute in fury that they stayed silent. If Clint screamed when his arms were taken. If they forced him to watch Bobbi die.
Someone—Rhodes—pried Morgan’s sleeping form from his lap, hushing her when she mumbled and reached for Steve. Natasha was suddenly beside him, pulling him into a tight hug.
“We didn’t touch anything!” Harley replied, from a desk at the corner of the room. He pointed a wrench towards Morgan. “It was her idea.”
“Alright.” He breathes out and suddenly, they’re meeting halfway. Tony kisses him first because Steve’s blush is red. Red like the blood Tony spat out in the Mansion. “Alright, my love,” he’s choking on the words now, but it’s true. It isn’t a lie. There’s no masks here. No deception, not like the EMP. No, bullshit. It's Tony bare, naked with Steve and there's something that's almost close to still being in love here.
Steve stared at the arm every time he saw Bucky, heart aching that his best friend wore something Tony made. Logically, the rest of the world has the memory of Tony Stark—their StarkPads, their phones, in green energy, in medical tech. The list was endless. He's immortalized in history books as Iron Man, but also as Tony Stark, genius, philanthropist, billionaire. Husband of Steve Rogers. Father of three kids.
That’s what this place was meant to be. Only, it didn’t last long. When he entered the conference room, flanked by Natasha and the rest of his team, he had a hand on his belt, alluding to an air of authority he didn’t truly possess. He realized then, that no, this wasn’t home anymore. A base of operations, perhaps.
Now, home felt like a prison. He walked around the brownstone feeling heavy as he opened the cabinet and dug out four plates for the table instead of five.
But Tony had no shrine. Even the power from calling the suit, letting it encapsulate his body with a single thought was a high that quickly dissipated once he remembered the expression of fear on Steve’s face. It was the same look Steve wore now.
“Please Stark, all anyone’s got to do is take one look at you and they’d see.” He gestures to Tony, and he must see something pitiful because he sighs.
“The moment I fall asleep, Morgan starts crying or Harley demands attention, and I can’t sleep when they need me.” Tony twisted, and turned on the bedside lamp. He sat up, stripped his shirt and threw it past Steve.
Tony deserves something greater than life—something beyond anything that Steve or even Rumiko could possibly give him.
Tony’s mouth was dry and his head hurt. He couldn’t feel his toes. Despite the duvet over them, he felt cold. He was close to losing it again. He wanted nothing more than for Steve to be gone.
When the truck troddles through the gravel, Steve sees them all standing by the lake. Their heads all turn towards them, waiting.
“Alright. I won’t start.” Natasha offers her palm and Steve places the cigarette butt there. “See you soon.”
Erasing your brain is pretty shitty. Wouldn’t recommend. Losing sight of the future. Some futurist who forgets.
Tony’s bastard brain betrays him because he fucking loves it, he moans, panting like a cockslut when Steve rubs two fingers on it smear it over his pointed nipples. He leans over, follows the trail of spit until he’s just above Tony’s lips, boxing Tony in with both arms. Steve kisses his lips, chaste and gentle. He inches away, dropping spit on Tony’s mouth. “Please, yes, please.” Tony swallows it all, greedy, he’s always asked for more. Never knew when to quit. Steve’s his worst habit. “I do, I do,” Tony mumbles, slurping and licking the taste of Steve’s saliva from his mouth.
Tony narrowed his eyes, suspicious, doing that thing where he tried to be nonchalant. “Yeah, sure, let’s go with that.”
“Shellhead and Winghead,” Tony said, entertaining the idea that perhaps they’d never be in this moment if they made all the right decisions. Now, there was nothing but treachery and the will to dig their fingers into unstitched wounds. “Still like the sound of that?”
There was no other sound in the room except their moans and skin slapping against each other. “Ugh, baby, I love when you're so deep inside.”
“You’re not the first to say this to me, you know,” Steve measures out, voice incredibly bored. He just shakes his head. He grips my shoulders. My balance is off. It’s hard to stand on one foot.
Tony shakes his head, then there’s that self-deprecating smile. “Can’t say I have. Not as of late,” his eyes are heavy and he’s looking up at Steve with these thick eyelashes. “Could count the number of people who gave a shit in one hand. That’s not counting those who passed. Will you show them how it’s done? You know, since you seem to give a shit about me.”
Steve opened the fridge and fried up a carton of eggs and bacon. Morgan padded over, kissing her papa on the cheek before marching to her little kiddie stool. She assisted with adding the English muffins into the toaster. As they finished setting the dishes, his three boys padded over and began scarfing down breakfast.
Yet Steve can’t even pull the visor down to look into his own eyes. He breathes in and out, once, twice. Then he puts his seatbelt back on.
They talked for a while. Steve watched them exchange stories about SI, the Air Force, and the kids. They were careful not to mention Tony’s current decaying state. That’s what it was—a slow death.
“They were your friends,” Tony gasps the words out, and it hurts to talk when his voice has been unused for days. When his mouth is nothing but a hole to fuck. He refuses to look at Steve, stops himself from looking away. “How could you? They were your friends! They were your team! Family, how could —“
He wasn’t going to think about how her wet hair dripped over her body in that navy bikini. He wasn’t going to think about her full lips and the mole on the upper corner of her mouth. He was going to delete the memories of her teasing remark and a sing-song voice. He was going to delete the pitch of her laugh and the way she straddled him and called him lover.
“Alright, pops,” Harley replied, pulling away to look at Steve. His eyes were a pale blue, like Steve’s. Sometimes he liked to think that Harley inherited the hue from him, even if they didn’t share the same blood. He opened the box and took the tag off. He placed it to the side after a beat, then nodded to Steve. “Thanks, dad, I guess. I’m—”
I’ve always thought it was difficult to be loved. You proved me wrong. I’ve never thought that it's a loveless world, Steve. There’s so much hope. Yearning. Isn’t that why we do what we do? Because we love? Believe me, I did it for that.
Steve tilts his chin and leans his forehead against Tony’s own. “Come on, please, we still have us, don’t we?”
“I suppose,” Steve acquiesces with a heavy heart. It’s a wonder how he doesn’t sink to the ground. He wants it, though. Bury him and let him rest with the rest of the dusted particles. “New life,” he says, voice dull, “And so.”
Steve takes a bite, chews slowly, letting the taste of blueberries roll over his tongue. “How are you?”
“Huh?” Steve looked at him with false confusion. He gestured to his shoes and began double knotting the already tied laces.
“What happened to you fucking my face?” Tony grabbed onto Steve, settling both hands over Steve’s shoulders. He pressed kisses from Steve’s jaw and down to his neck, sucking at the spot that always made Steve moan.
“Captain Rogers,” JARVIS announced from one of the outdoor speakers. “I cannot detect Sir’s heart beat any longer.”
“No, no, you’re not coming yet. You’re gonna come on my dick. While my dick is so deep inside you. So be good, baby, and suck.” Tony pulled his hair and used the movement to move Steve’s face back and forth over his dick. “Steve, you’re so good.”
Tony had never felt as pathetic as in this moment, lying in his own mess, the bathwater tinged in blues and grays, flecks of blood still on the bed of his fingernails.
There’s a tap on his wrist. Morgan was making his plate again. She scooped some chile verde and looked at it pointedly.
Steve came, and he’s still goddamn lonely and desperate with wanting, and seeing her kiss Tony reminds him that this isn’t his and he should never pretend.
Tony couldn’t shake the need to tell Steve how he felt. He never wanted it to be like this — he never wanted for Steve to die. There were so many things Tony preferred not to remember, but his brain filled him now. Non-stop, images of Steve screaming at him in the cell, the veins on his temples bulging.
“You noticed that?” Steve blushed, picking up their interlaced fingers and kissing it. “I thought I was being subtle.”
“I hope Stark’s in a better place now. He just finished that mess with the Mandarin a few months ago.” She crossed her arms and leaned back on the rolling chair. She had the air of a woman who took no shit and was used to being right.
“Yeah, it still is,” Steve finally answers now, shaking the memory for review at a later time and stumbling over his words. “There hasn’t ever been a place that topped that day - that time. Uh, dish.” He looks up at Tony, heart in his throat with stupid, fitful hope. “Maybe when we head back east, we can stop there?”
He's waiting for his tissue energy to deplete. For organs to dysfunction. For glycogen to eat itself up, for his muscles to weaken and break. He doesn't need them anymore.
Steve exhaled, willing his heart to calm down. He took the dirty dishes, ran them under the water, then began scrubbing. He liked the smell of lemon dish soap. Tony hated it; it reminded him too much of cleaners and bleach. He always scrunched his nose and begged off drying the dishes, insisting that he’d entertain the kids instead. Couldn’t Steve please just do the drying too? After Steve put the dishes away, his little family would be on the couch, all on top of each other, allured by Tony.
It’s too big for just five people, and Steve wonders if Natasha and Tony ever feel nostalgic for the time when they were all bunking on top of each other. But even then, they were already fracturing, lines drawn even if Steve refused to acknowledge the cracks.
Rumiko cuddles Tony, rubbing his shoulders and kissing him. Kisses him where Steve’s mouth was. She mouths at his collarbone, flicking at Tony’s nipples with a laugh.
Steve dropped the bottle to the caddy, staring at the rest of Tony’s shower products lining the walls. He decided that once he’s used up the cedar shampoo, the rest of the conditioner, and the shower gel, he’ll put them in the recycling bin.
Bruce and Nat both arrive and sit beside Riri and Kate respectively. There’s no doubt that this is their regular placement. Steve takes the remaining set on the other end of the table.
The following morning, Bucky and Sam appear in their kitchen. Morgan hangs on Bucky’s arm and swings herself while he looks down on her, utterly amused. Sam claps his back with a grin.
Fuck no, he wasn’t gonna throw them away. They were gonna stay there and Natasha would have to hold him down before any of Tony’s belongings left their bedroom.
Steve lifts him up with ease. He doesn't even have enough energy to walk, much less fight off the hands that wrap around his waist. Tony is arranged on Steve's lap like a child's putrid rag-doll.
“Honey, you’re not getting enough sleep in between our newborn and all the time you spend in the workshop,” Steve tried to reason. He had the serum, he didn’t need that much sleep.
“No.” Tony made the move to pull at his hair, only Steve caught his wrists. His fingers were warm and they tightened on his pulse points. He paused, feeling bile rise from his throat. “What am I supposed to do now — what am I — why are you here?”
“Well, fuck, Captain America proposed to me, I just had to say yes and drag him to city hall as soon as it opened.” Tony laughs, likely recalling how he rolled out of bed, pulled Steve into the shower and got them dressed in record time.
He could replace the mental images with BARF. But Steve didn’t want that. The memories were going to remain pristine and as clear as he remembered them. He didn’t want anything to change. Tony always warned Steve that he often got gridlocked to a routine, only willing to bend if all the facts pointed to an improved direction.
He sits by the window and watches cars pass by every few minutes. Turns the day throughout this head again and again: leaving with a heavy heart, Tony in the passenger seat, beside him but untouchable.
“Alright, fine. But when Pops acts like this.” Harley waved the box. “I just—I don’t—I don’t understand. He didn’t even pick this out. He wasn’t even here to choose this for me.” He shoved the box back, hitting Steve’s knee.
“Tony.” Steve laughed, batting Tony’s hands away from his chest. He grabbed them both and pressed them above Tony’s head. “Fine, if that’s how you want to do it. Don’t move.”
Steve knew that Tony Stark was always armored. He had a wrist watch that turned into a repulsor. Steve’s seen the watch transform into a gauntlet. It was like watching something brilliant and great unfold just for him.
Running, always running, towards the fire, away from it. It doesn’t matter at this point. One front after the other, and next thing he knows, he’s spring towards something else, too stubborn to look back.
He flexed his legs apart, shifting to carry Tony's weight between the hall and himself to secure leverage on Tony’s ass. He kissed the smile from Tony’s lips and reached for the bottle of lube in the caddy. Tony nipped at Steve’s bicep and leaned against the wall.
The stairs of the entrances always led him down that awful night with him, barely a man, still growing taller and taller, shoulders broadening, being led by a petite police officer to the corner of the station.
Steve guessed that’s what happened when Agent Romanoff retired from the field—she needed to oversee active missions. Fury passed on the torch to her and Maria Hill five years ago. Rumor had it that Fury went to work for another underground organization or was running ops in outer space. Steve didn’t bother asking anymore. Maria and Natasha just smirked and ignored any snide comments about that.
I was prepared for you to lose faith in me. To lose your respect, if I had it in the first place. I like to think I did.
Tony arches and their chests rub, and then he's wrapping his free hand around Steve, and Steve can imagine this going a million ways. He can remove the blindfold, reveal himself, peer into those eyes. Trouble, that's all that would be. But Steve's always running headfirst into danger. He won't survive this, he knows. He kisses Tony, putting everything he has into thrusting in and out.
“Here, like this.” She folds his thumb and two of his fingers back, then presses the index and middle against Tony’s rim. “Tease him a little bit. He  likes that.” And together, they rub circles, clockwise, until Steve finally dips in and feels the heat of Tony, stretching open against Steve.
Then, his eyes go wide, realizing the veracity of the scene. There’s blood on his hands, but he barely pay it any mind. He drops to his knees and tilts to wipe away the blood on my face.
“That’s good.” Steve picked up one of the tails and tugs on it. He was not allowed to watch any recordings of him and Tony in the house. Even Tony programmed the AI to make sure Steve didn’t spiral in memories.
Steve sighed and let Tony continue. He felt for the note in his jacket pocket, reading through the thoughtless musings. He pulled a pen from his briefcase and wrote two words: Tony Stark.
Tony snorts. “Ok. Alright. You say you’re good. I’m fine too. You understand why I say that’s a difficult question?”
Steve nudges him on his back. The angle shifts with Steve momentarily hitting his prostate. Tony sees stars, whining when Steve moves away to position himself further between Tony’s legs. The fury from earlier pace simmers into something slow and too true. Steve looks into his eyes, whispering bullshit about how he loves Tony and they’ll make it work,
There was once a time, kissing Steve might have soothed the thunder erupting in his belly, the worry rooted in his chest.
He would have been fine if it was just them two for the day, but it’s even better to have their friends — family here today. There’s the pain of missing what they’ve both lost. No,
He should feel wrong. Guilty. There’s a lot of things that Steve should feel, but he can’t manage to summon any remorse for yearning to be inside Tony, to kiss his brows, to shower him with love. Protect him. Tell him that he’s good.
Steve lips twitched. The feeling of his mouth dragging up seemed like a foreign concept. He savored the feeling, even if he felt guilty. It’s okay to smile, even without—
“Let me start, Steve. I’ve got my goddaughter all excited during dinner and she’ll probably burst if I don’t give her my present now.” Carol grinned at Morgan, offering her a slim box.
Steve was raised Catholic. His mother was an Irish immigrant and she instilled the word of the Lord into Steve. When he went into ice, he lost the rosary she gave him when she passed. Tony spent years tracking it to no avail. Sometimes things were better left off not knowing.
“Shit, these kids swear up a storm themselves,” Samuel says with a laugh. He turns to kids. “Scram and spread the news that Tony Stark is here to fix your parents cars and garage doors!” He faces Tony and they shake hands, appearing to share a wordless conversation Steve isn’t privy to. “Thanks for fixing up my old girl.”
It could have been hours or days. He remembered Carol linking their hands together and crying, and he remembered the look of shame that passed through her expression before he closed his eyes.
Tony shivered, and he itched to make half moon indents on his arms. The room was too bright, even with just a few lamps on. Steve would see too much, he’d see how weak and careless Tony had gotten.
“Sorry. But look.” The woman snaps his attention with a slight push to his shoulder. She directs both their gazes to the child staring at them. “New life.”
“Alright.” Tony accepts the explanation with a nod. “But that’s not what I meant. Why Steve? You didn’t have to.” he gestures at the room, between them.
It’s getting cooler. He shifts to the side, sits up, and tucks Tony’s spent dick inside his pants. With nothing to clean them up, Steve grimaces and wipes his hands on the inside of his t-shirt. Tony is still asleep, even with all the proding, so Steve hoists him up in a bridal carry and makes the short walk back to his car.
In the bathroom, I shave the goatee to the classic cut. Steve will check and make sure I get the line precise.
Steve pushed past him and dragged him further inside. He forced Tony down the sofa and walked into the bedroom.
“James!” Miss Barnes hops out of the horse and runs to embrace Barnes. She’s crying, murmuring promises. For a moment, Barnes appears to be shocked, but he cups her face, and she meets his lips.
“Oh, don't look so earnest now. And you mean we, right, Cap, because I assumed we’d be doing this together.”
“Dad would stay up for 24 hours, so I can do that too.” Harley twisted his lips, tinkering with a potato gun.
Even with a bruise forming under his eyes, Tony looked handsome and untouchable. Steve ached with something stupid.
Steve’s body is pliant, and he can’t hear the ocean or the sound of the guitarist further into the boardwalk. Tony is pawing his hair now, tugging it, so Steve drops down, kisses his chest, and unbutton’s Tony’s jeans. He unfasts his own, not even bothering to put his pants down his thighs. He lets his cock and balls hang against his boxers, then works Tony’s zipper down.
“For this.” He scrubbed his face again. “There’s more. HYDRA infiltrated SHIELD. They’re so embedded into the organization that it's hard to distinguish who reports to who. Natasha and Clint are there now tracking and making maps regarding those in power… we could use your help, Tony.”
It’s the first one directed at him all day. Steve counts it as a win and tucks it into the wing of his mind reserved especially for Tony. Just Tony. “Did you have a nice time?”
Tony stared at the mirror above the fireplace. He didn’t realize his nose was bleeding. That must be the copper taste on his lips.
“I’d say the same.” Riri stands at her full height. Being an entire foot shorter, she barely measures up to Steve’s shoulder, but her eyes demand presence, and Steve allows himself to fall under her microscopic gaze.
The sound washes over me and I focus on chasing orgasm instead. That’s what I can do. White out for a few moments, let this body do what it was meant to.
“Same shit, different day. My husband’s dead and I’m raising our kids alone.” Steve crossed his arms and leaned against the cushions. He remembered the day they picked the sofa. Harley spilled engine oil on it and Morgan threw up on the back pillow when she had the flu. So much history on this simple furniture. Steve couldn’t throw it away.
He meets Steve's eyes. There's no choice. Steve won't leave. He'll be more forceful the longer Tony resists.
Steve never hated himself as much as he did in that moment when they all saw Tony’s dead body in Steve’s arms.
Carol jumped up from her spot and ushered me into the kitchen for some leftovers. None of us can cook, no surprise there. Didn’t want to wake Jarvis. And there’s no time to learn anything other than a basic stir-fry. But you always made something half-way decent. Especially when it came to pasta night.
The Avengers fell into a semi-domestic pattern. The team trained together once a week. They debriefed missions and rewatched footage to improve their strategies in the field. The Compound felt like home.
But they were Tony’s favorite part of this entire house—a place they built together with the hopes for a future.
Tony interrupts, words forced, “There’s a certain joy in driving too fast. But you have to remain safe. Level-headed about it.”
Tony's breath hitched and Steve doubled his efforts, ramming his dick inside Tony and jerking him off. His eyes stayed fixed on the column of Tony's throat and the deep purple spots blooming where he sucked.
And then, Steve sees it. The man leans against the counter, pointing at the party-goers on the deck, distracting Tony. He slips something into Tony’s cup and smiles.
Steve shuffled to the bedroom. His bedroom now. Not theirs. Steve didn’t share it with anyone anymore.
Doesn’t wear Steve’s face. Doesn’t have the same set of blue eyes. Just a faceless creature, a blurry nobody who takes pleasure in brutality.
She usually finishes her school work before the afternoon, so she gets free reign riding with Steve around their property or picking strawberries with Steve if it’s in season.
“I’m coming,” Steve warns, and Tony’s waiting for the clench of his shoulders, the twist of his lips. The snarl that comes out of his mouth as he comes. Instead, Steve’s eyes remain open, and he mutters a barely there
He’s not even sure if the man owns the house, much less lives there. But Steve takes it as permission to go inside anyway. He enters the foyer. The stereos blast some Santana song. He knows this one because a Private used to blast the CDs. He nods his head at the right beats, passing a group of dancing women. He sees it before he feels it—someone claps his shoulders. Their breath smells of cigars. They pass him a beer bottle.
In a blink of an eye, Tommy stands beside Kate Bishop and Cassandra Lang. They laugh and cheer Kate on as she pulls off her bow and arrow.
Steve walked forward and crouched beside her to observe the drawing. He’s been remiss on helping her with her shading technique. Steve didn’t draw much anymore.
Victor Von Doom made an appearance at the party last night. The tool questioned him about the latest Stark line of green energy, scoping out competition. Then, the music was too loud but Tony loved drowning his thoughts in the sound of screaming, laughter, and the bass. It helped keep his thoughts away. Fuck, he mixed alcohol, cocaine, and there was something else. There’s flashes of a man barging into his conversation with Doom, warning him that Doom put something into the drink.
They’re no longer battle-ready. Worn out and faded from their fight earlier, they crumble. A pretty sight that comes apart at the seams. Steve looks at him, eyes wet, an apology goes unsaid.
He kisses Tony’s back, licks the sweat off his neck. Behind him, Steve rocks his hard dick on Tony’s lower back, he’s circling his lips as if to announce how pleased he is with Tony’s despair.
Steve tried to hold back the tears, but he has never been strong. He ignored the burn in his lungs and took a deep breath. “The first time?” He turned to Peter and Harley.
“Alright, well, I’m sure there are other enhanced humans out there who’d want to be part of this...whatever it is.” Tony stood over him, a sculpture of red and gold. He offered his armored hand.
Tony feels wrong footed in his own home. He’s standing naked in his kitchen with a blanket covering his bits. Then, there’s this handsome man,
He turns off the stove and reaches for Tony’s hair, wiping at the pieces of snow melting on the edges of his  forehead. Tony wears it longer these days. It’s not as long as Steve’s, but it’s floppier. Steve is quite fond of it, especially when it’s mused and filled with cowlicks in the morning.
His thoughts are muddled, leading him back to bask in past and the habit of turning over the day with precise detail.
He fails and groans, the sound coming deep from within his body, and he's kissing Tony's neck, rubbing his entire body, wishing Tony won’t shower after this, that he'll smell like Steve until the morning.
Steve doesn’t have any photographs and his sketchbook has been barely used these last couple of years. There are moments when he finds refuge in letting his fingers quickly sketch cityscapes, country roads, but those are far and between. He thinks if he starts, he might spill everything he’s carefully crafted and stored away.
Tony settled into bed, sipped a glass of water and wished he could trade the bottle of Valium on the side table for an ounce of cocaine. Tony pulled the armor’s undersuit over himself and laid in the coffin of his own making.
I already knew, since the beginning, since going down this path, that I’d lose our friends. Judas, I’d be Judas. Yeah, it was fine, I told myself.
Tony comprehended their words and still talked science with Peter and Harley, even though it was hard for him to invent. His bones ached. His back hurt. It was a struggle to stand. But even through all the pain, Tony guided the boys’ science projects and watched DUM-E, U, and Butterfingers work on small-scale gadgets in the workshop with Tony’s and JARVIS’ instructions.
He’s long stopped twisting his hands. It proved useless to try to get his arms free. The shackles were heavy, made of iron, and the chains that hold his body upright are bolted to the ceiling.
Carol loomed over him and refused to look away. She balled her fists and he really wished she'd stop staring at him in pity. Was this how she’d felt when Tony had showed up at her house, pulled the faceplate up and begged her to get help? Possibly, he thought, he must have been full of shit.
“Ugh, you’re too soft when it comes to my head. Scrub harder.” Tony grabbed the towel from Steve and scrubbed in quick, rough motions. “I’m fine, Steve. It’s scarred over. You being rough with my cranium is not gonna give me cancer again.”
He itched for charcoal and a piece of paper to draw the father and son. Instead, Steve grabbed the manila folder with Peter’s birth certificate. “Yes, he’s ours.”
He walked, bare ass and all, towards the flowers and plucked a handful of the dwarf carnations. He took the pale yellow, deep red, and bright white ones and sat beside Tony.
“Hi, baby, what’d you bring me?” Tony beckons them both over a hand. Its red and gold coloring shines against the sky.
They head back home as it nears three, and because Sam slows through the curves as if buying time, they get home an hour later. Just an hour or so more, the sun will soon set. She always wants to leave early when autumn comes.
Bruce laughs. “It’s a rather boring answer, Steve. But to be frank, and I can say this now,” he offers another smile. “World ended, but it feels like I’m finally understanding myself, you know? Did there have to be a crisis for me to learn that I was scared? Maybe. Somedays, I still am. He brought me home. I’ll always be grateful for that.”
Steve sighed heavily, looking up at the clear blue sky. The jasmines were all in full bloom, bright white petals opening on every tree. The breeze blew its fragrance and the scent hit Steve with the memory of Tony planning the Compound’s construction. “But they’re not Tony.”
“Oh, Saturday Night by The London Suede.” Tony places the spoon into the sink and opens several cabinets, back turned away from Steve. “I could have sworn it was in that playlist I made you.”
Tony’s always known he is simply a pit stop. A brief entertainment for a lonely man. He’s already written the narrative: Steve would continue being Sheriff and then maybe he’d find a nice woman, perhaps, he’d finally relent and meet Maria Hill’s distant cousin in the Capitol. He’s seen photographs of Sharon Carter, and she and Steve would make a handsome couple. Tony would drink all throughout the wedding reception if he’s invited, and pretend to forget the taste of Steve’s come in his mouth.
“You’re different, I can tell.” They share a moment of silence. Tony’s too honest. It doesn’t do him well to be like this with people who might want something from him. He laughs again, the sound is light and airy. There’s a cool breeze now and the waves hit the shore. “God, I would kill for a chili spaghetti right now. Ever been to Big Boy’s? It's in Burbank. About 45 minutes away, double that during rush hour. Guess I gotta settle for the taco truck down the street. Wanna join me? It’s just past the boardwalk.”
His heart stopped. He wanted to hit something. Scream until he couldn’t speak. Steve had the same fleeting thought, but it wouldn’t be the same, would it? It’s like what Pepper said about the Grandfather’s Axe. How much of it would remain as Tony when they’d upgrade the AI, make him more real, more human. Could it still be Tony?
He’s never seen her smile, much less laugh, but here and now, Tony’s eyes flash in excitement as he tells a story about her slipping a glass of red wine on her dress, then changing to her uniform to match Rhodes. All of them, watching the sunset at the docks, Kate and Riri skipping rocks at the creek and begging Tony to buy them a fishing rod.
Tony peers up at him with an open mouth. Steve is compelled to bend down and suck on his lips. Steve lets go of his cock, dropping both arms to frame Tony’s face. Their cocks touch and he rocks back and forth, hiding his face on Tony’s neck.
Tony blinks out the tears, his heart hurting more than that time in the cave. He hitches a breath, and sees Steve smile.
Harley snapped and threw circuit boards across the room. Steve often found him standing on the penthouse’s rooftop garden, surrounded by withered flowers. It made him nervous to see the anguish in his eyes. Harley refused to talk to him on some days. Steve’s helpless, scared his son is drifting away from him.
He shoves two fingers roughly inside Tony's hole, staring at Tony all the while. There's only the sound of his fucking, a squelnching sound that used to make Tony so hard. He's still hard. But, he can't look at Steve anymore. He stares at the ceiling, puts a hand on his cock, and jerks it.
He folds the garments and sets them by the bedside table, next to another bottle of lube and handcuffs, where Tony’s Identicard is thrown casually—because of course Rumiko knows all of Tony, and he doesn't have to hide this.
This someone was righteous. Had a stubborn jaw, but a nervous undercut to his seemingly confident stature. Captain. Someone in the military who looked out of place. Steve, who moved to LA to find something—someone. Tony recalls this Steve guy saying
Tony teased his hole with the head of his cock before slapping Steve’s ass down. Tony kneaded his cheeks to assuage the sting, then he pried Steve’s ass open.
Steve still finds himself looking up at the sky, hoping that the suit of armor would fly over him, but it never does, so he pretends each shooting star breezing through the darkest nights is Tony, too.
One could describe the science of the body and its demise in detached terms, but when death happened, loss and grieving was nothing but emotional.
“Excuse me,” the man points at himself and Tony. “We’re having a conversation and you’re interrupting. See yourself out.”
Steve sipped it, setting it on the coffee table. He opened his arms, a quiet request for a hug. Peter and Morgan came willingly, resting their hands on his shoulders. They stay quiet for a long while. Steve didn’t bother wiping at his face. He felt for Morgan’s hair, patting it twice, before arranging her on his lap. She looked up at him with tears running down her face.
Steve murmurs platitudes that are densely veiled threatens, and it’s a study on living in the edges of depravity and false gentleness. He settles a hand under Tony’s knees and carries him to a new room.
The road stretches for miles. Beside them, the car zooms past a series of trees he cannot name. Further and further, they continue west until the sun begins to set.
