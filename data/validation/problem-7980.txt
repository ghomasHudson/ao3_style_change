“Tony what is this,” He asked, holding the key up for Tony to see.
Once dressed Tony made his way to the bathroom to put on some makeup. After being in the public eye his whole life Tony was always having makeup put on him. In his teen years one of her girlfriends thought that it would be fun to do his makeup in the way that girls do it. After that Tony found he liked how he looked fully done up. From then on he would do his makeup for dates and parties. Tony decided to a simple look with only eyeliner, mascara, and a red lipstick.
He and Mark talked for a while. Mark kept ordering vodka sodas and Tony kept drinking them. He ignored the fact that every time he looked back at the table, Steve was watching him.
“You’re not going home with him,” Steve said.
“Call me Steve,” the bigger man replied, flashing Tony a small smile. God, even his
Steve loosened his grip on his beer and sighed. “Thanks,” he said. “That’s good to hear.”
Neither of them brought up The Moment, as Tony had started referring to it, all weekend. They sat next to each other when they watched TV, but Steve kept his hands firmly in his lap, and Tony was too nervous to try anything. Tony figured it was just some fluke thing, probably brought about by too many emotions and too many beers. But he still couldn’t stop thinking about it and silently wishing it would happen again. He caught Steve staring at him more than once throughout the weekend and he wondered what it meant. He wondered if it meant anything. He hoped it did.
“That’s worked really well for us in the past.”
video. “Mhm,” he lied.
Steve nodded and
After it was over, Tony and Steve walked slowly toward the dorm. Suddenly, Steve took Tony’s hand in his. Tony didn’t say anything, mostly because his brain was screaming
“Need help?” Tony asked.
The group found a booth away from the bar. Steve slid into the booth first, and Natasha slid in next to him before Tony could get in. Bruce slid into the booth and Tony sat next to him.
“Those movies you were talking about earlier. Do you think we could watch one?”
Tony chuckled. “I don’t think I’ve had to go through something similar to being resurrected. But, you know. You went in the ice and my dad was around. You came out and he wasn’t.”
“What, they didn’t have one-night stands in the ‘40s? I’m going home with him. Good night.”
Except when Nick asked Tony if he wanted to have his own dorm room.
They sat down. They had to let go of each other’s hands to sit, which sucked. But the quiet was good. Tony looked down at his plaque.
Mark came over to the booth. “Is everything okay? You ready to go?”
It took two seconds for Bruce to text back.
“Okay.”
Steve shrugged and smiled again. “I guess so. At least it’s only for a few more months. I’m sorry it has to be like this.” He stood up and held out his hand. “Let’s go home.”
“Yeah, but graduate students don’t normally take-“ Tony looked at the schedule Nick had given him- “
Tony answered it quickly. He opened the door to reveal Jarvis, Nick, and the most perfect specimen he had ever seen in his entire life.
“I didn’t,” Jarvis agreed. “I’m just trying to figure out where I might sit.”
“Hey,” Steve said.
“That’s enough for me,” Natasha responded. “I’ll get the first round. Beers for everyone?”
Tony made a detour to the student union, where he knew they sold Us Weekly. He bought one, a lump forming in his throat, and raced back to the dorm.
. Jarvis probably had an idea, but he would never have told Nick, would he?
“You’ve gotta be fucking kidding. I haven’t had sex in, like, four months because I keep waiting for something to happen. But if it’s not gonna happen, I’m not waiting.”
“Well, I can go.”
“I don’t want that. I don’t want you to have to follow me around and explain everything to me. I don’t want to feel lost.”
Tony smirked. He wasn’t out, but he was well-known and had slept with a significant number of guys in Boston. He wasn’t subtle about flirting, kissing, or leaving with them. He was sure there were rumors, but he didn’t mind, as long as it brought guys like Mark around to add some spice to his night. “Now, what makes you think I’d accept your drink?”
“I guess not. Does that mean we can’t hook up anymore?”
“My night’s not ruined,” Tony assured him. “I’m hanging out with Captain America! I have exclusive access to the man everyone wants to talk to.”
“Yeah, but I feel like I should. If that’s what you’re doing, I should know about it.”
“You did all that and you’re nineteen?”
Jarvis smiled. “I knew you’d come around! Mr. Fury wants him to come here next Friday, so that you can take the weekend to show him around a little bit. That should give you time to fix all of –“ Jarvis gestured to the messy dorm room – “this. Well, I know you’re busy, so I’ll head out. Remember that this is very sensitive information, so please don’t let anyone know about Steve Rogers. Mr. Fury will make the announcement in due time.”
“Hey,” Tony said, sitting on his bed. “Let’s get to know each other. This is a small room for strangers to share. Tell me about Steve Rogers. Likes, dislikes, embarrassing anecdotes.”
Tony kept his arms crossed, but he relaxed. Jarvis, as usual, was right. Tony was popular at school and he loved his friends, but he was lonely. It was hard during breaks or award ceremonies, when he knew his peers had support he just… didn’t. If Steve Rogers felt half of what Tony did, then Tony knew he couldn’t say no to helping him out.
“I’m a reporter at the
Steve looked at him, his shirt partially unbuttoned. “Yeah?”
“What’s wrong?” Steve asked.
After a while, Steve pulled away, but he didn’t move his hands from Tony’s face. “Jesus, Tony, we are in so much trouble.”
“But there’s also the problem of my job. In a few months, I’m gonna be in SHIELD. That’s a dangerous job.”
“I’m okay with that.”
“I don’t know how to help with that. Maybe he’ll change his mind. But you need to give him time. It’s easy for him to act like he’s doing okay and that everything is normal, but he did just get pulled out of a hunk of ice three months ago. He’s missing people that he never thought he would have to miss. He doesn’t know which end is up. All he knows is how to be a superhero. And that’s probably really confusing for him.”
“Okay, well, this is it,” Tony said, motioning around the dorm room. “Nothing fancy, but it’ll do.”
“Tony, come on,” Steve said, motioning to himself. It took a full 30 seconds for Tony to realize that Steve meant for him to sit on his lap.
Tony leaned back against the bench. He felt like he was going through a breakup, but there was no relationship. “So now we just live together with the knowledge that we want to be together but we can’t?”
“You don’t need to know about AI to go to an awards banquet.”
Tony’s brain broke down. A
They flirted for the next fifteen minutes until the burgers came out of the kitchen. Tony excused himself and brought a burger to Steve.
in a way Tony just wasn’t yet. Seeing Steve looking so good made Tony feel young and scrawny, completely inadequate as Steve’s guide to the 21
“Jarvis. Nick doesn’t think I listen to Justin Bieber, right?”
“Something is obviously wrong. You only call me Cap when you’re upset.”
“I did. Last year. It was a different award, at the end of the year. I sat with Bruce, but he was also getting an award so his parents were there. It sucked, to be honest.”
Tony smiled, and so did Steve.
“Well,” Steve said, breaking the spell. “Should we get going?”
“Really a good news/bad news situation,” Jarvis continued. “The good news is that Nick Fury found Steve Rogers. And he’s alive.”
“Tony,” Steve whispered again. He took Tony’s face in his hands and pressed his lips against Tony’s.
“Thanks.”
Tony smiled. This was going well.
“Thanks, Natasha,” Bruce said.
“Fine.”
“I’m glad that you’re okay with all of that, but I don’t know if I’m okay with putting you through it. Do we have to make any decisions now?”
In it, he found an envelope from MIT. He opened it to find a congratulations letter – he had won a research award from the engineering department. There was going to be a banquet. He practically skipped back to the dorm.
“Okay. I’m going back inside. Are you coming in or are you going to freeze your ass off pouting out here?”
“Yeah? When was the last time you had sex?”
“Steve,” Tony said, ignoring that he was slurring, ignoring that he couldn’t walk a straight line to get to Steve.
“I just think it’s important to support you by being interested in what you do. Plus, now I know everything about computers, which is pretty good for a guy born in 1918,” Steve replied, not looking at Tony. He was too busy looking down at his tie, which was giving him a lot of trouble.
“Can I help you?” Tony asked, annoyed. This kid had never talked to him before. He knew what was coming.
“Well, it’s more for style than function. You should know all about that,” Natasha responded. Steve laughed, which annoyed Tony. Natasha was objectively attractive, with striking red hair and a runner’s body and a smile that could knock any guy on their ass. Tony felt like he should be on alert with her, like he was in a competition that only he knew about.
“Tony, what’s going on?” Mark asked.
“A research award,” Tony replied, also smiling from ear to ear. Steve’s excitement was infectious. “I did a lot of work this summer on AI – uh, artificial intelligence, it’s sort of like robots and computers combined – and the school must have thought it was pretty good.”
Tony huffed and crossed his arms. He and Nick got along well, but Tony couldn’t think of a time that he ever indicated to Nick that he wanted to be responsible for another person. “I really don’t want to do this.”
They watched more videos, downing beers as Tony played music that was more and more modern. Steve thought that 80s music was “too loud” and he didn’t really understand 90s pop. It was obvious that he didn’t get modern pop music either, but he really liked Ariana Grande. He asked Tony to play “one more of the Ariana songs” four times.
“Ready as I’ll ever be.”
“If you’re sure.”
Tony stared at her.
“Did you want to know if I had feelings for someone else?”
School was getting easier for Steve, and he was more comfortable being seen. Nat had shown him the gym, so he’d started working out. Tony wasn’t sure whether he and Nat were working out together, and he was afraid to ask. Instead, when Steve was at the gym, Tony would hang out with Bruce, who was also trying to avoid the idea of Steve and Nat together. She and Bruce had hooked up a few times since that night at McCool’s, but she was avoiding talking about anything more serious, which was leaving Bruce in agony.
Finally, around 10 am, Tony got a text that said “1 min.” Tony already knew they were approaching; he could hear the news helicopters that were idling above MIT, and he could see the confused groups of students hanging out outside of his building. He checked himself one more time in the mirror- okay, not bad- and took in a deep breath.
“I should get to sleep,” Tony said, kicking off his shoes and laying back into the bed. He drifted off quickly, and he was pretty drunk, so he couldn’t be sure if he actually felt Steve kiss his forehead or if he just dreamed it.
“Jarvis, can you put those bags somewhere and see if Steve needs anything before we go? Tony, I’d like a word with you in the hall.”
“You really need some random guy to give you that?”
There was a knock at the door.
“…long walks on the beach?” Tony joked.
“Oh my god,” Tony said. Suspended animation? How was that possible? Did it affect his physical enhancements? Did this mean there was going to be a superhero now? In the 21
“What’s cable?”
– was it his responsibility to have Captain America for a roommate?
They sat on Steve’s bed to eat pizza, drink beer, and watch music videos from the last sixty years on Youtube.
“Hey, that is not true,” Tony said, but he could feel himself flushing.
They repeated the same thing for hours, until Steve eventually fell asleep.
“But aren’t you worried about being overwhelmed? Or recognized? We all have fakes, we can’t get into discreet or nice places.” Tony could feel how weird it was for him to argue against going to a bar, but for some reason he did not want Steve hanging out with Natasha, even – especially – with him around.
– he’d earned everything himself. So whenever his guardian, Nick Fury, asked if he could use Stark influence to “help” Tony in any way at college, Tony always said no.
“Let’s see. I like baseball, movies…”
The group of six walked to the car. Tony was drunk and mad, but he didn’t miss that Bruce took Nat’s hand.
Steve brought his mouth back to Tony’s and licked into his mouth hungrily, gripping Tony’s ass as Tony continued to grind into him. Tony bit Steve’s lower lip and loved the sound that came out of Steve’s mouth. Feeling bold, he started pushing Steve’s shirt up his torso. Steve got the hint and pulled away to pull his shirt over his head. “You too,” he said, sounding out of breath.
“What?” Tony practically shouted. Why –
VERY sorry for a huge delay in posting. Finals were nuts. I'll be posting more regularly from now on!
“Sounds like I don’t have a choice,” Steve said as Tony thrust a beer into his hand.
“Steve, bars aren’t like they were way back when. It could be overwhelming or crazy –“
They spent most of the day idling. Steve got moved in while Tony finished some assignments and tried very hard not to stare at Steve too much. He wasn’t terribly successful on the latter front, but he definitely could have been worse. After the sun went down, Tony asked if Steve wanted pizza for dinner, which led to a small argument about whether good pizza existed outside of New York. They ended up ordering a pizza anyway.
“You okay, Tony?” Steve asked, frowning. Great, Tony was staring.
The boys nodded and Natasha headed for the bar.
“Steven,” Tony said. “I am going to be going home with Mark over there. He is going to teach me about music. Among other things. Have a good night.”
Steve turned his head and looked at Tony. God, those eyes. They were huge and clear and an almost perfect shade of blue. Right now, with the moonlight hitting them from the window, they sparkled in a way that didn’t look fully human. Tony could look at them all night. Tony could look at
“What’s got you looking so happy?” Steve asked, looking up from his textbook. Not for the first time, Tony thought about how domestic their life was. They came home to each other, to live their quiet little life together, and Tony knew Steve loved it as much as he did.
“He just knows that you go out with friends – during the day and at night – and you know Boston very well,” Jarvis continued, reading Tony’s look.
“Is anything going on with…” Tony was so close to saying it, but he just couldn’t. He almost didn’t want to know. He was afraid he wouldn’t like the answer. “With Nat?” he asked instead.
Steve sat down next to him and read the article. “But this is all false,” he said.
“I know this is a strange situation,” Nick confessed, handing Tony a sheet of paper. “But SHIELD doesn’t have the time or resources to bring him up to speed on… well, on everything. College is a good place for traditional and cultural education. This is Steve’s schedule for the semester. Once Christmas break starts, he’ll come and work for us.”
Tony looked at Steve. “Really? You don’t have to.”
you safe.”
“Excuse me,” a classmate said, interrupting Tony and Bruce.
Nat shrugged. “Okay, let’s close out.”
Before the dean got started with the awards, he said, “We have an unexpected and special guest here tonight. I’d like everyone to give a round of applause to welcome Captain America, Steve Rogers, to MIT.”
“God, it’s cramped back here,” Tony commented, getting into the back seat with Bruce. Sports cars with back seats were so unnecessary.
“MIT, right?”
“Hey, here’s your food. I’m gonna go back to the bar and learn about music from Mark. Have a good time.”
“Forget I said that last thing.”
“Thanks, I’m sure it will,” Steve said. He smiled, but it didn’t quite reach his eyes. “I’ll just get unpacked.”
“It looks great,” Steve said, still smiling, but there was something strained in his voice. Tony noticed Steve staring out the window, at the crowds of students outside.
“What’s wrong?” Steve asked. “What happened?”
“Of course I will. You can’t go to this alone. This is a big deal. Someone should be there to celebrate with you.”
“I can’t believe midterms are almost here,” he said, trying desperately to avoid any conversations about relationships.
all night.
It was tougher because Steve’s idea of just being friends was a little warped. During the day, everything was the same as it normally was. They went to class and came home and Steve asked questions about scrunchies or vending machines or whatever new thing he had noticed. They did homework and ate dinner. But then night came, and almost every night Steve would turn the lights off while Tony loaded a movie, and then they would curl up under a blanket and cuddle or hold hands. They usually didn’t talk during the movie – that would require them to acknowledge what they were doing. But Tony still cherished every night that he got to pretend he and Steve were anything more than friends. A few times, especially during midterms, he fell asleep on Steve’s chest and woke up in the same position, Steve snoring softly with his arm still around Tony’s shoulders.

The rest of the week wasn’t much better. Tony went to class and was bombarded with thinly veiled requests to hang out with Captain America. He went back to the dorm and found Steve, looking perpetually tired, stressed by the amount of work he had to do and the amount of things he didn’t know. He would interrupt Tony’s work to ask questions, and Tony would help him, so Tony had to work later than he wanted to. Probably sensing Tony’s frustration, Steve started staying after classes with Natasha Romanov, a history major who had a job as a research assistant in the American Studies department, to help him out. Tony’s frustration turned into jealousy, which Bruce didn’t understand because he didn’t think there was anything between Tony and Steve in the first place. So Tony was very excited for Friday to finally come around. He liked spending time with Steve alone. He knew it was selfish and the opposite of what Tony needed, but he craved time together in the dorm, away from everyone. He knew Steve liked it too.
The bouncer shook his hand silently and opened the door without checking anyone’s IDs. Tony smirked.
Tony swallowed. Of course he knew, because Steve had been wearing them in that stupid video he’d watched like a teenage stalker. “I mean I just thought you’d probably have aviators.”
“Yes, it’s a very unusual case. Mr. Fury is still investigating, but it looks like rather than dying in the crash, Mr. Rogers was fixed in a state of suspended animation. When he came out of the ice, he was alive, and he hadn’t aged.”
“These awards things are just hard,” Tony replied. “My parents aren’t around to come, and Nick is busy. I just hate going to these things alone, especially when other people have family with them.”
“Your room is… quite a mess,” Jarvis said, not answering the question.
“I do not crush.”
He learned that news channels were uncomfortably good at getting up-to-date pictures of him off the internet. He made a mental note to make all of his social media as private as possible, or maybe even delete the accounts.
“Yeah, just zoning out,” Tony replied, grabbing the book on his nightstand and opening it in his lap to hide the erection that was quickly forming.
“I think I can dig one up.”
“I have all week to learn.”
“All thanks to you,” Steve said, smiling at Tony. They were so close to each other, and they were smiling, and everything was quiet, and Tony could feel that something was so close but just out of reach. There had been more and more moments like this recently, and Tony was starting to get off on them, on the idea that there was something actually going on between him and Steve Rogers.
After 15 minutes, Tony downed his beer and said, “I’m getting food. Steve, you wanted a burger?”
“Maybe I shouldn’t meet your friends tonight, Tony,” Steve said, collapsing in his bed. “I appreciate the gesture, but it’s just too much.”
“I don’t know, I think this is indicative of a pretty fun future.”
Tony had fallen in love with Steve. He loved how Steve didn’t expect to have sex right a way. It took three weeks for them to fuck for the first time.
“Hi, Steve” Tony said putting his hand out for Steve to shake.
“Will that is a long story.” Tony laughs. He eyes Steve not sure whether he really wants to hear or just asked.
“It’s okay.” Tony smiled,” I understand, but that doesn’t mean you won't be sleeping on the couch tonight.” With that he went up to his room. Leaving Steve standing there glass in hand.
“Yeah lets do that.”
Tony understood, or at least he has to. He doesn’t know how to show he cares any other way. He buys Pepper beautiful dresses. To show he loves and cares about her. He got Rhodey fling lesion while they were in school. To help him pursue his dreams. He took them to dinners that were expensive to them, because they couldn’t do it themselves. Tony couldn’t do that for Steve, but he’s trying. That’s what’s important right?
Warning this chapter does have some Abusive language please be aware!!
“Of course someone like you has a pretty lady.” Her eyes never leaving Tony.”What’s the name?”
Now Tony is fine with slumming it, but why do that when he could pay for a place that will work for them. Tony loved Steve so he agreed, but this meant that they were going to have a very small apartment. This is what bothers him. Tony has all his books on different sciences that he spent years collecting. Then there was his clothes, now Tony doesn’t wear half of them for the most part, but he does need them for important events. He Has to have a different suit for every event, and he can’t get rid of them because he can wear them to the board meeting he has to go to. Then he has all his at home lab equipment. That has to have its own area to live.Then there was all Steve's artwork and supplies. It needs to be kept away from the lab, or it could cause some bad things to happen.
Tony ran into the flower shop. A bell rang when he walked in.
“ Same a pint of what they have on tap.” Sam answered.
“I will get a slice of pepperoni, and I’m paying.” Steve said.
“It's too much Tony. I can’t afford to pay even a fourth of the rent.”
Please leave kudos and comments! Thank you for reading!
The day passed and no sign from Steve. It was the middle of July so Steve didn’t have classes. Mean that Steve really messed up last night. With the light fading and having not eaten all day. Tony gave in and had some cheese and crackers.
(See the end of the chapter for
When both of them were at Tony’s they would either cuddle or were fighting. The fights were from everything about Tony’s past, and the accidental flirting that is Tony’s personality. To Bucky complaining about how Steve is never in their apartment, and his need to have Tony around more than Tony can. Tony couldn’t help but take to the fights personally. Most of the problems seemed to be Tony’s fault and he could seem to shake that everything bad in their relationship is his fault. Even with that Tony couldn’t help but love the man Steve is.
To:Steve
“I’m surprised you didn’t go straight to the coffee.” Steve said after eat some bacon.
Tina gets back with the wine. She placed it in front of Tony. Only to have him move it in front of Steve.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony smiled and pulled Steve in for a hug. He told Steve that it was okay. They spent the rest of the day curled into each other watching movies. Tony’s head rested on Steve’s shoulder popcorn on his lap. Everything should be fine, yet Tony couldn’t get what Steve said out of his head. Was he really that bad? Does he really make people look at him? The only reason he did that in high school was to get Howard’s attention, but he’s learned that he will never get that. Tony thought he stopped. He hasn’t been in a paper for years. His thoughts ran rampant through the night.
Tony couldn’t stop thinking about his dates with Steve. They were all amazing in their own ways. They spent most of them talking about everything and nothing. About the teachers they didn’t like and the ones they did. They talked about how Steve would love to have his work in a gallery. Even though he didn’t think his work is good enough. They talked about how Tony don’t live up to Howard's expectations. The thought of the dates gave Tony butterflies.
“It was for our six month.” Tony says.
“I don’t want you working on that arm any more Tony. I told I don’t want anything from you but you lied and made me something. Bad boys get punished.” Steve said. Then walked out.
“Tony that’s great!!!” Steve says excitedly,” I’m proud of you, you deserve it. I love you!” He leans down and kisses Tony.
With all that Tony didn’t know how they were going to live in an apartment that Steve can afford.
Once the door was open Steve pushed his way past Tony. Following the man he loves, Tony couldn’t help but look at the ground. When Tony looked up he saw Steve standing in the middle of the room. Tony didn’t know how to feel. The way he was standing screamed trouble, but it would be a lie if he said Steve didn’t look beautiful. The moon light surrounded Steve. He looked so soft. Tony felt like he couldn’t breath. He could spend the rest of the night looking at Steve.
“I would have, but I didn’t know that I was coming home. I had just gotten back from an undercover OPS. When subordinate came over to tell me that I was going back to the states. Now I’m here.” Rhodey said.
“Yeah, I really do.”
“I was out with Bucky.” Steve said his head lowered like he had done something wrong.
Steve giggled,” Of course I will be there Tony. I love you.” He ended it with a kiss, and got up to start his day.
“Okay,” Steve laughed,” Lets talk about happy things. What are you majoring in? I’m going in to art and history aka I’m going to be an art historian. At least I hope so.” Steve smiled.
He was two waffles and three coffees in before Steve started to wake on the couch. When he made his way into the kitchen, Tony just shook his head and pointed to the bedroom. Steve seemed to understand and went up there. A few minutes later Steve came down showered and with the key in hand.
There was one apartment that Tony really wanted. It had a nice kitchen that he would like to cook in. There were three bedrooms. Steve could have an art room, and Tony could have a small in house lab. There was a gym in the building. It was only two blocks from the school. The building was beautiful. Tony fell in love with the apartment. It was perfect. The only problem was it was more than Steve could afford, and he wouldn’t let Tony pay.
Behind him Steve was moving the alfredo off the burner and pulling Tony into the center of the kitchen. Tony laid his head on Steve’s chest listening to him sing about falling in love and how he just couldn’t help it. Closing his eyes he thought about what he needed to tell Steve. Not wanting to ruin the moment he just kept quiet and let Steve hold him.
“Pepper it isn’t work. You know that project I’ve been working on?” Tony wanted for Pepper to nod before continuing. “I asked Oliver Whispfire for help and I think we got it. It will be fully functional.” Tony said not holding back his excitement.
With a happy and a tipsy Steve,and Tony smiling at his blond superman; they end dinner. Steve asks how Tony is supposed to drive them home. It seemed that Steve forget Tony hadn't touched and of the wine. Nonetheless Tony wasn’t planning on driving them home. Howard’s car need to be back before the morning. Tony told Steve that the car has been picked up and is safe at home. Steve looks at him weird.
“No, that you shouldn’t have, but I’m glad you did.”
Tony was a little surprised that Steve was wanting outside the door of his apartment. Did he forget something?
“My handsome hungover boyfriend made me breakfast in bed. What’s not happy about that.” Tony smiled as he looked down at the pancake topped with blueberries, Tony’s favorite, and whip cream. There was also bacon, coffee, and orange juice. Tony’s grabbed a fork and started eating the pancakes and blueberries.
“Tony I can afford this.” Tony rolled his eyes.
After he ate and had too many cups of coffee, he called Pepper to come over. While he waited, Tony had started to make plans for a functional prosthetic. After hearing Steve talk about his friend that had lost an arm. Tony had decided to start looking in prosthetic. This caused a downward spiral of scientific papers and studies. From there he had ideas on how he would do the robotics. He was still working on trying the weight problem.
He stayed in the lab until three in the morning and had a seven A.M class to attend. Sadly he couldn’t just skip it to sleep, because the teacher for some god awful reason gave a grade for attendance. Which meant that he had to actually go to class. In the hopes that he might survive the day he rushed off to get coffee. With coffee in hand he could actually be a person. Only to get to class and have the espresso-filled cup spill on all the notes he had taken that night. With coffee gone and notes ruined Tony end up falling asleep in class. After that two hour monstrosity, he was able to go back and get more coffee before his physics lecturer where he needed to be able to correct the stupid TA that was teaching the class.
After a while, the vibe at McCool’s changed from regular dive to college bar. A DJ started playing music and the lights went down. Tony recognized more and more people from school. He and Mark kept talking and checking each other out. Eventually, Tony was good and drunk, and he knew what was coming before Mark even asked the question.
Tony looked up from the laptop where he had been watching
“Jesus,” Tony spat, his voice low. “We spend time together every night. Can’t I have one night where someone is going to show some romantic or sexual interest in me?”
“I wasn’t planning on getting deep with Captain America. I was thinking more like helping him understand cultural references and showing him that craft beer exists.”
Tony looked up at Steve and realized that he had been crying, but he couldn’t remember when he started. “Uh…” he didn’t know what to say. He handed the magazine to Steve.
Still looking at Tony, Steve gripped Tony’s thigh. Tony gasped. He knew Steve heard it. He bit the inside of his cheek. He could lean over, right now, and something could happen. He knew it could.
Tony rolled his eyes. He hated when Steve said they were friends. Friends didn’t spend every night in each other’s arms or walk on eggshells when it came to the status of their relationship. Friends didn’t admit that they liked each other and then decide to do nothing about it. He hated Steve for minimizing the complications that existed between them, the complications that Steve created.
“Understandable.”
“Newsflash, Cap, I had a life before you got here. And my life consisted of three things: sulking, drinking, and going home with random guys.”
“Yeah, I imagine that was not an easy week.”
“See you next week.”
Tony spent the rest of the week cleaning his room (which was not easy- he had to enlist the help of his friend Bruce more than once) and watching the coverage of Captain America that had dominated the news since Nick Fury announced finding him. Steve Rogers (probably under Nick’s direction) hadn’t given any statements or interviews, but every news channel was camped out outside of the New York hotel where Steve was staying, and they ran footage of him walking into and out of the building from morning till night.
“No,” Tony said. “You didn’t put a beer in my hand and tell me to go outside and drink without looking for the paparazzi I knew were there. It’s my own fault.”
“I’d enjoy a comedy.”
“I am positive. His hand was on my thigh for, like, thirty seconds. He was looking straight at me.”
“I don’t know, Tony. I wouldn’t get caught up on it.”
“I can’t. I get your credit card bills. I know what you get up to. Just… help him out, okay? Just for a few months.”
“What if he’s never ready for that?”
Okay, no. Tony had been so good at avoiding thinking about Steve in any way that was inappropriate. He was not going to start now, while the guy was in front of him. “Come on in,” he said, ignoring the way his mouth had started to water.
Tony’s head started spinning. Steve’s hand was warm against Tony’s jeans, and the contact made him shudder. Was this a move? How could it not be? Steve was an idiot if he didn’t notice Tony alternating between checking him out and trying very hard not to look at him too long. They had just talked about Steve’s friend that he almost certainly hooked up with. But was Steve this forward? Tony hadn’t thought he would be.
“No, he’s got all the help he needs. Thanks for your concern,” Tony snapped. The kid frowned and walked away.
“He went into the ice at 27. MIT has graduate programs, so it shouldn’t be too weird for him to be around campus.”
“Would you still want him?”
Bruce blushed a deep shade of red as Natasha came back, carrying three beers and a coke for herself. “If you want food, you’ll have to order it yourself.”
Nat shrugged. “I know you haven’t gone home with anyone else all semester, which is a big deal for you.”
“Truer words have never been spoken.”
“Who knows?” Steve whispered back.
“I got an award,” Tony responded, holding out the letter.
He spent a lot of time thinking about what it was going to be like living with Steve Rogers. On top of having to live with someone, he knew people would be crowding around his dorm building more than they already did. He knew things were going to change in a big way, and he couldn’t talk to anybody about it because he was sworn to secrecy about the whole MIT plan.
The next morning Tony found himself alone. Steve hadn’t returned from the night before. Slowly Tony got up from the couch and went to make some coffee. Not feeling up for breakfast. Tony stood in the kitchen and drank his coffee.
When the song ends Tony opens his eyes, “ My Dad put me in charge of R&D medical and the arm that I was working on for Bucky.” Tony whispers into Steve’s chest scared of his reaction.
“Steve please, it would be a good apartment for us. It fits our needs. Steve.” Tony said. Steve started to just ignore him when he talked about apartments. “Steve look at me. Why won't you let me pay for this apartment?”
The next morning Tony’s stomach hurt. The pain from noting eating that night, now taking over. With a deep breath he stood up and went to make waffles.
“By borrow do you mean stole?”
“Espresso for ‘Or I will die’” one of the other barista’s yell a little while later. Tony rushed over to the barista and grabbed the cup and went straight to drinking it.
“I’m making dinner tonight, and wanted to make sure that you could make it.” Tony said wonder filled his voice. It seems that happened a lot when he was talking to Steve.
“It went well. We talked… he had me clarify my horrible pick up line. It was something about my dads World War two project.” Tony said before she could ask what it was. Now she just looks at him in disappointment.”I know not my best, but it just slipped out.”
I'm alive! I still have writers block.
“What the proposition you had for me?” Bucky asked. Tony couldn’t help but look over at him. Tony didn’t know how to describe the look Bucky had. He looked intrigued yet guarded.
Steve’s room was full of his art. Steve had piles of sketch books and random papers covering his walls and floor. Tony was laying in the queen sized bed that was pushed into the corner of the room. To the left of him was Steve’s dresser. Next to it was a chair that Tony found Steve sitting in.
At some point Steve had come over to Tony and lowered them to the ground. Tony just cried and asked for Steve to stay. Steve just sat there. Trying to calm him down, and rubbing his back. When Tony’s breathing slowed, and he was just sniffling Steve talked.
When they got to the restaurant. Tony couldn’t help but smile at Steve’s surprised face. Steve looked at him and said.
“Oh yeah. My dad had decided that he needed to focus on his work. He end up freezing his swimmers. When he met my mother he had her do this experimental procedure. It froze her eggs like it did to his sperm. In 1970, Howard had decided he wanted a kid. Honestly I don’t know why, so on May 29, 1971 I was born. The had a surrogate carry me do to my mother's age. They were both 54 when I was born.”
Tony just nodded and started eating his waffles. Steve joined him.
“Okay, Tony.” Steve says reaching across the table taking Tony hand.
“I love you too.” He mouthed against Steve’s bare chest. Steve hummed in acknowledgement of Tony’s un-said words. They laid there for awhile nether willing to break the silence. Happy in the bubble of love that they made.
From: Steve
Tony couldn’t help but feel safe. Steve would protect him from the evil. He would keep the bad thoughts away. Steve was safe. With arms wrapped around him Tony could help but to drift back to sleep.
Tony meet Rhodey in high school. Rhodey got in the private school by scholarships and pure dedication. He had taken every AP class he could and then he took the test. Somehow he always passed those tests with nothing lower than a 4. By the time they graduated high school Rhodey was halfway done with college. He ended up signing up for the air-force and enrolling in MIT.Tony was proud of his best friend. Every once in a while Rhodey would stay at Tony’s.
“Well I grow up in Brooklyn. I never knew my dad, so it was just me and my mom. I was a sickly kid. Always in and of the hospitable. It was okay though I had my best friend Bucky to help me with it.” Steve had paused,”Oh, I got into more fights than I could even win. To be honest I never won any of them. Bucky would always rush in and save my skinny ass all the time. Those were the days.” Steve stopped again looking saddened at what comes next,”Our senior year Buck had this motorcycle. He loved the dang thing. It was raining and dark. He says that he didn’t see the car tell he was on the ground.” Steve swiped away a few tears,and Tony reached over grabbed his hand. Steve smiled at Tony.” The driver of the car was going to fast and hydro planned. Bucky lost his left arm in the crash. He says the worst part is he can’t ride his bike anymore. He had it fixed up. It’s just sitting there waiting for him to give it up.”
“Okay, now that Tony is here let's get drinks.” Pepper as stood to go order for everyone. “ What do you guys want?”
“I shouldn’t have started making an arm for Bucky.”
Love: Love You too.
“Wow,” Tony breathed out.”You look amazing.” Steve blushes at the compliment.
The next time he woke, Tony heard a knocking sound. Still sleepy Tony opened the door without a thought. There on the other side of the door was Steve, and everything for the previous night came back to him. Tony feels sick. Steve must have noticed as he stepped towards Tony. He just stepped back.
The previous conversation forgot. The order dinner, followed by some coffee.
Under his breath Tony heard Bucky mumble, “Oh great.”
Tony was working with medical in how he could make feeling in the prosthetic arm he was working on.He had one other problem the weight problem. Once Tony had the weight and measurements for Bucky’s real arm it would be easier to fix, hopefully. Everything else was ready. The arm was functional in the way of the brain being able to move the arm.
Pepper stopped looking around and just looked at Tony. Hoping that the it would hurry him along. Tony chuckled to himself when he thought about the first time she had interrupted his work. He had freaked out on her. He had forgotten his train of thought. It had set the project back a day. This caused him to stop talking to her for a week. Shaking the thought away, Tony saved what he was working on, and looked over at Pep.
Steve was standing in the doorway. He reminded Tony of a teenager getting caught sneaking in after a party. Tony wrapped his arm around himself. They looked at each other both waiting for the other to speak.
“But Steve, it has a room for your art, a lab, enough closet space for all my clothes. It's close enough to the school that you can walk. Please Steve.”
I think it worked if you gave me your number. My name is Tony by the way.
Tony followed him in. The apartment was small.The living room held a couch on one wall. Right across from it was the t.v. In between the two was a coffee table. The t.v was surrounded by bookshelves. One was filled with Steve’s textbooks and sketch books. The other was just full of books that were Bucky’s (Steve’s roommate). Steve went into the kitchen that hadn’t been updated since the 70’s. The cabinets were in an L shape. In the middle was a table. Steve put the flowers in the middle of the table. He looked at Tony and said.
‘‘Now get out of here before I turn you into SHIELD for kidnapping a National Treasure.’’
‘Heck!’ calls out Sam.
The half hearted glare that came from Steve who was still sat on the chair had him slightly sobering. ‘‘Okay stop comparing notes on my husbands ass. That’s for my eyes only,’’ he said while giving Steve a wink that had him blushing again.
Leaning over Thor he saw that they had a Stark tablet propped up on the table and were watching a video of Steve doing… a PSA? in his old uniform.
When he came back, he was trailed by them both in addition to Clint and Pietro, all of whom he’d strictly warned not to make any noise in case Tony were still asleep. When they came up to the communal floor Steve saw that Tony was still on the couch, cuddling the bear, fast asleep.
‘Sugar, honey, ice tea’ says Peter eyes shining with mirth.
‘‘Oh my god is that a Ameri-bear? The Internet is gonna flip after I post this picture.’’
‘Well no one asked you to look’ came Steve’s voiced and he sounded a bit flustered.
‘So, you got detention. You screwed up, you know what you did was wrong and-’ Tony couldn’t hear the rest of the sentence over Clint wheezing like he was a dying man in space. Even Thor had chuckled so loud that Tony’s brain actually rebooted without the caffeine for once.
The looked cute together. Not that Tony would ever admit it. But they did. Especially Steve. His smile could light up any room. It was like sitting in the sunshine during a crisp winter. Warming him from the inside. Steve Rogers didn’t just hold love in his heart. No. He gave it away too as frequently as one would breathe air. And Tony loved him all the more for it.
As soon as the question registered to Tony he looked at Steve in front of him who had just closed his eyes in defeat and a faint pink blush on his face and neck.
‘Tony- ’ Steve starts with a sigh.
The two weeks that Steve was gone went by slow and agonising. It was so much quieter in the tower without two Avengers. Actually, that was a lie. Clint and Thor made up for the quiet the only way they knew how, with way too much noise. When Tony had come up on the communal tower after a 72 hour inventing binge, and a crick in his neck and definitely not enough coffee to deal with whatever Barton and Thor were up to that early in the morning, he noticed a familiar voice, and stopped in his tracks.
Its Bucky who finally breaks the moment, his shoulder shaking and then he bursts out laughing and Steve actually pouts. ‘Oh my god Steve,’ he says in between laughing, ‘ Stevie I promise I’m not laughing at you, its just you two are so adorable I just can’t deal with who cute it is.’
‘Bucky, its not funny’ Steve reasons but he’s still blushing and Barnes looks like he never heard a bigger lie.
And Steve, bless him, just looks like a bit like a deer caught in the headlights, silently wishing for the floor to swallow him whole. ‘It just slipped out’ he says pointedly not making eye contact with anyone.
Okay, Tony needed to get more of this. He rounded over to where they stood and waved at the two SHIELD agents who had immediately backed off as soon as they saw Tony in the Iron man suit raising his gauntlets towards them. Incredulously, one of them actually spoke up but not in disappointment about the failure of his invention.
Going in he heard two faint voices coming from the other side that was closed off by some machinery. He walked closer and the voices slowly became clearer.
‘Hey look it’s your husband, Iron Man. Ask him. Hey Iron Man! Be honest. Caps suit in this picture,’ and held up an old tablet with a picture of Steve in his old uniform for Tony to look at, ‘did not do anything for his ass, right?’ he asked.
‘Oh, hey man, Tony you have got to check out these PSAs that they made Steve do. Dude, they are the funniest thing I haven’t stopped laughing at these since Spider Kid showed them to me. God, I can’t wait to embarrass Steve with these.’
‘Oh, fiddlesticks,’ yells Clint as soon as they’re all seated on the Quinjet.
‘‘I’ll take a nap, but the bear is not coming with me,’’ Tony decided and moved to flop onto the couch in the living room, crossing his arms over his chest and closing his eyes.
“Hey, we’ve talked a few times!”
“Tony, please. I really want to do this, and I really want you there.”
Okay, not the confirmation Tony had wanted. It was still pretty vague. But also, Jesus, how much did this guy have to go through?
Steve grabbed Tony by the shoulders. Tony opened his eyes. Steve was leaning away from him, his brow furrowed. “We’re not… we can’t,” Steve said.
“Yeah, welcome to the 21
“You’re being a real jerk.”
They walked through the entryway together and did a lap of the room. Three photographers came up to them and asked for a photo. Steve agreed to each one, and he put his hand on the small of Tony’s back for every picture.
“Thanks, Stark,” Nick said, rushing Jarvis and Steve into the room. When Tony closed the door, he noticed a crowd of people in the hallway looking into his dorm room. Great.
But he and Steve still hung out with Bruce and Nat, and things were going really well for them. Tony always felt annoyed sitting across from the two of them openly holding hands or kissing. He loved Bruce and was so happy that Bruce was happy, but he hated that it was so easy for them. They went to McCool’s at least once a weekend, which someone had told the press because there was a steadily growing number of paparazzi outside for pictures of Captain America. Tony resented the attention; he knew that if Steve remained anonymous it would be easier to convince him that they could be together.
Which didn’t stop Tony from having some very vivid dreams about Steve later that night.
Sometimes being a Stark was okay.
Tony stared at Steve. His eyes were such a clear blue. Tony would never be able to get over those eyes, the innocence in them, the seriousness, the earnestness. Tony Knew Steve was telling the truth about being proud of him. He knew that being with Steve made him feel calm, safe, certain that everything would be okay. Tony couldn’t remember the last time someone had told him they were proud of him. He wanted Steve to say it every day. He knew what he wanted, and he knew Steve wanted the same thing. So fuck it.
“He didn’t need to. He talks about you all the time, and when he’s not talking about you he’s asking me to explain things that would obviously impress you. He’s obviously got it bad.”
“I had a great time tonight,” he said.
“I’m so sorry,” Tony said again. “I didn’t mean to be a drag.”
put on a shirt.
you. It’ll be fine tonight. You don’t want to hang out in a dorm room on a Friday night, do you?”
“Just to keep you safe,” Steve said close to Tony’s ear, his voice low.
“Yes, but he also doesn’t know that 9/11 happened, or that we have cell phones, or who Justin Bieber is. He
He hadn’t known who to expect, but he did not expect to see Edwin Jarvis, his family’s butler, at his door.
“She’s different. She’s smart and… aggressive and…”
Tony stumbled into the car. It was so cramped in the back. Steve put one arm on the arm rest and wrapped the other around Tony’s waist. Tony shuddered.
Mark laughed. “Yeah. I’m sorry you’re with friends because…” Mark hesitated before continuing, “Otherwise I could buy you a drink.”
“Did you come out here to tell me to apologize? Because I’m not doing that.”
“Spoken like someone who’s had to go through something similar.”
And he hung up.
“You’re welcome. I can’t stand the thought of you doing this alone.”
“Um, no.”
It was hesitant. Tony grazed Steve’s lips with his own, and it took a second for Steve to kiss back. And then, suddenly, Steve pulled away.
“Go,” he said, very loudly, to the stragglers. They gasped and scurried like mice.
“God, Tony,” Steve moaned against his neck.
“Hey, are you listening to me?” Bruce said the Thursday before Steve Rogers was getting delivered to MIT.
They came to a park bench, and Steve said, “Let’s sit for a second.”
“Hi, I’m Steve Rogers,” Steve said to the bouncer. He held out his hand. “It’s nice to meet you.”
“Oh, yeah,” Tony answered, not sure what to say. Had he just dreamed up what happened? Had he misinterpreted?
“Uh, no,” Tony said, intrigued. “My friends are in that booth. I’m waiting for some food.” Tony turned and pointed to the booth. Nat and Bruce were now sitting in the same booth, chatting away. And Steve was sipping on his beer and… watching him. He smiled when Tony looked at him. Tony flashed a quick smile back and turned back toward the hot stranger.
“And who knows,” Steve said, a hint of humor in his voice that made Tony swoon, “maybe if we’re there long enough, you will get some of those embarrassing anecdotes.”
Confused, Tony stepped aside and motioned for Jarvis to come in. “So why are you here?”
“I know that that whole video referenced things. But I don’t know what any of them were,” Steve responded darkly.
As suddenly as he put his hand on Tony’s knee, Steve slipped his hand out from under Tony’s hand, off of his leg. It was like a balloon had popped. All the tension had left the room. It all seemed to find its way into Tony’s body.
“Don’t be sorry Tony. You don’t need to be sorry.” Steve whispered, as he kissed Tony’s head.
“What’s that smile for?” Steve chucked.
“ Yes, I called a week ago and placed an order.” Tony smile needlessly.
“I take Pepper and Rhodey here all the time. I like this place the let me wear my lab clothes. The only reason we formal clothes is-” Tony bushed thinking of his later plans at he park.” Is- ummm. I want to night to be special. It’s our six month, and that means something to me.” Tony sees Steve matching him in redness.
“Leave now.” Tony couldn’t help but whisper. He need Steve gone.
Steve wasn’t mad and not leaving Tony.That’s good, Tony just can’t spend a lot of money on him. He can do that. He has to show it. How does he show it without buying things? Tony shakes his head that is something for him to worry about later.
“Try the wine. Pepper tells me it’s good.” Tony said pointing to the wine. Steve with another look Tony couldn’t understand took a sip of the wine.
Steve stood in front of him the tux hugging everything just right. His bow tie a little crooked. His blond hair messy in a good way. Tony couldn’t wait to slide his fingers in and make it worse. Steve smiled at him like Tony was someone worthy of that smile. Steve’s blue eyes shined with joy. He just took Tony’s breath away.
When he walked out he saw Pepper sitting on his bed. She smiled at him before telling him, “Now Tony you need to play nice with Steve. Remember that if wants to play you need to be safe. So don’t be silly Tony and wrap your willy.”
(See the end of the chapter for
When they got to Steve’s apartment. Tony grabbed the keys out of Steve’s pocket. He opened the door Steve we plastered against him. When the door open Steve pushed Tony against. Closing the in the process.
“What is this I hear that Tony Stark went on a date. Yet he didn’t tell his best friend. Do you kno-” The voice stopped as Tony grabbed on to him.” Hey Tones.” Hugging Tony back.
Tony was happy the next afternoon. He got to sleep in and didn’t have to deal with classes. After his date with blondy, Tony went to the lab. He was happy to get out of the “nice” jeans,and into his work clothes. For the next several hours, tell he felt ready to drop. He didn’t wake tell that afternoon.
Hope you enjoyed this chapter. This is a little warning the next chapter starts getting in to the real plot. Hopeful you can for shadow the plot for the title. Any ways I'm a little exited for it. Let me know what you think!
Tony found himself lost in a world that he knew nothing about. An apartment that was smaller than he was used too. But that's okay because he had Steve to love him. That’s all that he really needs. Everything was going to be okay. Pepper and Rhodey would be there to help if he needed it.
Tony worked on changing the calibrations when Howard walked in. Tony wrapped up in the fixing the arm didn’t notice his father.
Tony nodded and got up to make popcorn as Pepper choose a movie. When he got back into the room Pepper had chosen Clueless. Tony loved the movie unapologetically. Tony handed Pepper the popcorn to grab a blanket. With everything ready Pepper pressed play.
“Okay” tony said and with that they went to bed. Not saying anything more than a good night.
“Now that is less crazy.So my dad-” Tony was interrupted by the college student bring them their food. Tony went straight into eating his slice. It was burning hot and definitely had burned a few taste buds, but much like his coffee Tony didn’t care. He was half way through the pizza when he noticed that Steve had only taken a couple bites.
Yeah I can do that.
Whats this, whats this, why is it so cold? Any ways I have had thins chapter done for a while,but wasn't sure how i felt about it. Please let me know what you think. comment what you think or what you think will happen in the future. I don't know I hope you enjoy this update.
The table was a further away from the rest of the tables. The area dimly lit, most of the light came from three candles on the table. Tony pulled out Steve’s chair, before sitting himself.
“Oh, Mr.Stark what brings you here today.” She asks.
"You have a date, and I'm only being told now." Peppers eyebrow raised as she looked at him and his sandwich.
“Dude the arm works! That’s why I’m laughing! You moved that arm with your mind and that’s all. Don’t you see how amazing that is? There was a 50% chance that it wouldn’t even move. That is amazing!” Tony exclaimed.
“You better keep that promise.” Steve pulled back and smiled.“Okay, Tony I want you to meet my best friends. Bucky Barnes and Sam Wilson.” Tony smiled as he shook their hands. Bucky was to his and Steve right. Bucky was built like Steve. Except he had long brown hair that was pulled back into a bun. Just sitting he seemed shorted then Steve. Sam sat across from him, but between Pepper and Rhodey. Sam had dark brown skin, and was smaller than the other men. This isn't to say he didn’t have muscle, because he did.
“Tony I’m not mad. How could I be mad at you for wanting to help others. Tony you are so smart and kind. How could I ever be mad at you.” Steve said. Tony could see his watery eyes as he continued to hold Tony.
“This is Tony Stark.” He says not looking at the caller ID.
The elevator couldn’t come fast enough. Tony stood there watching the numbers move up with his anxiety. He fucked up. That wasn’t new. Tony couldn’t help but fuck up. Just ask Howard. Tony didn’t skip any grades, because he wanted to be normal. Tony can’t seem to find a nice girl to settle down with. Tony dates boys. Tony was bi. Tony was a slut. Tony couldn’t figure out the problem by himself. Tony couldn’t… couldn’t. Tony found his thoughts spiraling with it he breathing. The elevator dinged. No one was on it. Why would there, everyone else keeps their promises. Tony took a breath and stepped on. As the doors closed he let a shaky breath out.
“Yes,”Steve breathed out,” Yes I will move in with you.”
“Everything good?” Tony asked.
Tony pulled in front of Steve’s apartment. He took a deep breath and got out holding the flowers. He closed his eyes before pushing the button with Steve’s name. A minute later the door buzzed open. He went up to the apartment. Tony knocked once before the door opened.
Looking around Tony found his blond superman. Tony couldn’t help but smile at the sight. With his Lover insight Tony’s breathing started to even out. He could do this. He started walking towards the booth. He could be the Tony that broke down in the elevator. He need to the Tony Stave that the world knows. When he got to Steve he did the only thing that made sense.
“Wait you are 24 an dgetting your Phd in physics and engineering. Hold on what engineering are you going in too?” Steve asked bewildered.
“How was your date Stark?” Pep asked with a raised eyebrow.
“Of course you do Tony. I saw the magazines from your time in High school. ‘Tony Stark drunk again?’ ‘Tony Stark arrested’ and you can’t stand the thought of people not looking at you!”
“ I’m at SI. I had to work in the lab. I told you that Steve.” Tony was confused. What had he done wrong? He hadn’t bought anything for him as of late. He was doing what Steve wanted.
Steve looked at him in aww. Tony had butterflies swarm again. In hopes of settling them done he worked on finishing his pizza.
Tony found it hard, but he understands. Steve didn’t grow up with a lot of money. So it made sense that he didn’t feel okay with the amount of money Tony had. To Steve buying a car as expensive. To Tony that was nothing. “I could do this.” Tony kept telling himself. Steve didn’t want him buying the paints that cost $200.He didn’t want Tony taking him the fancy dinners. He wanted to stay home and cuddle. It was hard. Tony would buy the $200 paint then remember Steve wouldn’t want them.
“Pepper what do we do?” He asked trying to remove himself from the blanket. Pepper looked at him and started to laugh as she paused the movie. This worried him even more. Pep wasn’t concerned that someone just broke into his apartment. Instead she was laughing at him. That's when he heard a voice.
When Tony walked in Steve looked up and smiled at him. Tony walked over to him smiling at Steve’s smile.
The walk to the park was quiet. Tony didn’t mind it, but something about it felt off. They should be laughing and being in love. Yes, they were holding hands, but it didn’t feel enough. Tony started holding his breath. He didn’t understand why though. The rest of the walk felt like this. When Tony got to the pond he stopped.
When he looked down at the side of the cup he say some writing on the side along with a number. ‘Your pick up lines suck maybe you should try again -Steve’
“ I told you that we would need to test it out on someone without an arm, because everyone in the lab has both.” Tony smiled, “ Now all we have to do is celebrate it so it will be what you want a little slow. Then the rest is up to you working with the arm to get it to do what you need.”
Tony smiled as he thought of his friends. Thinking of Pepper, he should ask her if she wants to come over and do a movie night.Tony pulled out his phone to text her when he noticed he had a message.
With those thoughts floating around his head Tony want to sleep.
Tony worked in the Stark's R&D labs. It was something he could do with the company that didn’t involve seeing Howard. It was part of his deal with Howard. He didn’t have to help in the business part if he helps R&D, and Tony did love R&D. The issue was the weapons part. He preferred the technology and medical R&D labs. Tony couldn’t help it if he got lost with the scientists. This is what Tony lived and breathed. Well Steve might be stealing that spot. There is a reason he’s behind.
“I said, I made the arm because of what you told me about Bucky.” Tony said.
“Tony, what if we started living with each other in a new apartment? We could find a new apartment that works for both of us. While we did that we would still live here.” Steve said a concerned look on his face.
The other person who would stay the night was Tony's other best friend Pepper. Pepper was an intern at Stark industries she was better than the people that Tony's dad had working there. Pepper took no shit. Tony fell in love right away, but Pepper said that she didn’t date spoiled rich kids. From then on they were friends. Pepper calling him out for his shit, and him repaying her with expensive shoes and dresses. By now Tony had given her his credit card when he messed up so she could buy her own apology clothes. When people asked if he was scared that she was just using he for his money Tony laughed and told them if she was then she would have dated and married him. No, Pepper was one of his closest friends, and one day she was going to run Stark Industries.
Because Steve was the kinda man that would bring Tony food on days that he was too lost in lab work that he couldn’t tell you if it was the same day. He would leave roses by the door to show he cares. He leaves notes all over to remind him that he is loved and cared about. Everything that Steve does makes it look like Tony can’t do simple things for their relationships. Tony couldn’t help but wonder why Steve was still with him.
Tony had taken the whole day off. He spent the day cleaning, listening to Nofx singing along as loud as he could when Bob came on. When his apartment looked cleaner than it ever had before, Tony started on dinner. It was simple, Waffles, He knew that breakfast for dinner might sound weird, but Tony swore that that just tasted better after the sun went down. Getting his Belgium waffle maker out to and heating up. Tony could then start on the batter. He mixed all the wet ingredients, minus the egg whites, together and then added the dry ingredients. Once he had everything combined he folded in the beaten egg whites.
Tony stumbled into his apartment late at night. Pepper texted him to remind him to eat. Signing Tony went into the kitchen to grab a small meal before he cashed. He found leftover chinese that he hadn’t ordered. That ment Pepper was here earlier. Grabbing the chow main and orange chicken out of the fridge not bothering to heat it up. Standing over his kitchen sink as he eats Tony cant help but think about how he was going to tell Steve that not only is he required to work on the Arm, but also now head of R&D medical. Maybe he should just have him over for a nice dinner. He could make his mother alfredo and apple pie for desert. With his plain made and food Tony went up the stairs and crashed.
“ I love you too” Tony says against Steve’s lip. He can feel their smile on his lips. Steve puts his hands on Tony’s thighs. With a jump Tony’s legs are wrapped around Steve, and is being carried off to his bed. Dinner never crossing his mind.
“You’re not paid to be my friend Pep. You just love me too much to leave.” Tony said as got up to shower. Stepping in to the bathroom Tony stripped. He turned on the shower and stepped in. The warm water helped wake him up the rest of the way. Tony stands under the hot water letting it wash away the stress of the day. After an unknown time Tony thought it best to rushing through the rest of the shower. When he got out Pepper had already picked out what he was going to wear. She had pulled Tony’s maroon dress shirt and a pair of black jeans.
“Why are you here Steve?” Tony asked. His voice was still sore from crying.
“Umm, do you have coffee?” Tony asked both Steve and the student looked at him weird.
“Hey, Tones. Tony look at me. Whatever your thinking is wrong, okay.” Steve looks at Tony with love. Putting an end to Tony’s spiral. Why would he be doing that if he was ending things.” I just want to talk about somethings. Nothing bad, I promise.”Tony just nodded. He couldn’t trust his voice.
“Tony where did you get this car?” Steve asked in aw.
“I’m sorry.” Tony whispered.
“ Yes thank you.” He handed her a couple hundred and walked out the door. Next stop Steve’s.
“Goodnight. Text me blond superman.” Tony laughed. He couldn’t stop smiling the rest of the night.
“This wasn’t a six month anniversary kinda thing. This is maybe a one year anniversary kinda thing.”Steve says grabbing both of Tony’s hands. “ I really want this to work Tones.” Steve says, before giving Tony a quick kisses.
“Hi, I’m Tony Stark.” Tony smiled. He hoped that tonight wouldn’t go bad. He couldn’t afford for Steve’s friends not to like him.He couldn’t lose Steve.
“Are you okay, Sir?” Superman asked while he wrote down Tony’s order. He had a faint smile on his lips.
The next morning Tony woke up happy. His ass hurt but in the best way possible, and he was hoping for a second round. When he realized that the bed was empty. He had no human space heater. No one was wrapped up around him in a way that he felt protected. His supermen left him alone in bed. Opening his eyes Tony looked around.
“I love you too, Tones.” Steve whispers.
“I’m happy for you Tony. He’s going to be good for you. Do you want to watch movies?” She asked. Tony smiled and wondered how she always knew what he needed.
Tony didn’t bother turning on the bathroom light. It would only make his head hurt more. Blindly grabbing the right bottle Tony dry swallowed the meds. Not wanting to deal with whatever caused him this much pain. Tony went to his bed to fall asleep in hopes that all his pain will drift away.
“Because I could, so why not?” Tony smiled and pulled onto the road. The smiles on their faces never left.
Getting up to start getting ready. Tony thought that he should remind Steve to wear the tux. With the text sent off Tony to shower. Once dried off he went to put his on. It was a basic tux that he had from the Christmas party he had to attend the year before. Next on his list was to do his makeup. He went simple so not draw too much attention. Happy with his look. Tony called a taxi to get Howard’s car.
