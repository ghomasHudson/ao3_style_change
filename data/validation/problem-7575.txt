Tony Stark was missing, and if the Avengers didn’t have Tony, well—Steve tried not to think about it. It had been bad enough forcing Spider-Man to stay behind—he’d been crawling all over the ship in the armor Tony had given him, and when Steve had finally grabbed him, he’d nearly fought back.
“Right. And—”
Peter blushed and waved a hand. “No biggie.”
his stomach leaping into his throat, or the feeling of panic racing through his veins, or the awareness that they were moving
“Tony?” The voice was soft and warm, solid. A voice that reminded him of log cabins and warm fires, and Sundays on the back porch.
Natasha looked directly at Steve.  “The thing that destroyed the planet Tony flew at.”  She said. “It’s coming here. “
“Rhodey called me.” Steve said. “We sent out Quill and Rocket to see where you were.”
And then it was Tony and Steve, alone, like it should have been. Maybe if he’d been able to talk to him alone from the beginning, make him see, make him
He, Tony Stark, was nothing more than an asteroid. Doomed to crater into oblivion.
Steve shrugged.
“Are you telling me that you think I sometimes look good, Rogers?” Tony met Steve’s eyes, and managed to keep breathing. “Really? Would you testify to that?”
“Doesn’t seem like a typical flight test.” Steve crossed his arms. “You sure that’s what it was?”
“Because of what happened to me in space.”
“Sure.” Clint nodded. “Come on Nat.” He grabbed Natasha’s hand and towed her toward the door. “We don’t need to listen to denial. We aren’t even getting paid for this.”
“Oh please. Let’s not act like your money has any discernible limit.” Clint rolled his eyes, strode over to the coffee machine in the corner, and started drinking directly from the percolator.
He wanted to race out through the airlock himself, wrap Tony in his arms hold him until he thawed out, do something,
Tony tried to maintain eye contact with Steve, but it was a losing battle. It was so hard to lie to Captain America. Especially since he’d been doing it for so long. You’d think lying to Steve would get easier with practice, but it was like the myth of Sisyphus. Just hauling up boulder after boulder of dishonestly, from further down the hill each time. “I handled it. I was curious about something, and I found my answer. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I’m entitled to some Jello. And maybe a Bourbon.”
it mean? Was this further proof that one’s fate could be altered? Or was he always supposed to tempt the Comet in this universe, always supposed to be bailed out by beings that were like gods compared to him? Was there a portal right by the Comet, right now, that he was missing?  “It means—”
“I agree.” Wanda curled her hands into fists, making them wink with red energy. “Carol and I should be able to handle it on our own.”
“Everything okay with the—”
“Just tell me! Right or left?”
There was no more planning, no more battles. No more last-ditch attempts or brilliant strokes of inspiration. There was just this piece of space junk, and his face pressed against the glass. The slow-moving galaxy that surrounded him, a myriad of white and black, intermingled with distant purples and blues and greens.
“Okay.” Tony was already activating his nanotech, letting his suit crawl into place on his body. “Before you do—”
“Because I wanted to see if it could be altered or redirected.”
“How did you find me?”
Quill’s fingers twitched. “Fine. We leave at dawn.” He looked Steve up and down. “Don’t eat anything beforehand. Most people vomit the first couple times they go through hyperspace.”
“Is that him?” Rocket said wonderingly.
“So what?”
Steve looked up. And there, directly above him, was Tony, hovering in his Iron Man suit.
“I don’t know.” Steve tipped his head to the side. “It was like, I’d imagine myself after Bucky left. Living alone, listening to the war on the radio. Going to the movies. And there was nothing about that scenario that didn’t make me feel like jumping off the edge of the cliff. When I thought about a future where I
Tony looked exasperated. “I know you’re not just dumb and strong, Steve. No matter what the fanfiction says.”
Peter jumped to his feet. “Sorry, I—Mr. Stark! I’m so glad you’re okay!”
“You have your phone, Stark. And you said there wasn’t a threat.” Nat called over her shoulder. “Call him yourself.”
, Steve thought,
Tony looked at the kid’s soft eyes, and remembered again that crushing weight, the grief as Peter flaked into ashes in his arms. “Me too, kid.”
“Nope. Don’t see any of it. I gotta go.” Carol disconnected, just as Tony rocketed into the sky.
“What happened?  Where is he?”
There was only the vast, cold expanse of space. Beckoning him to look, look, while he still had a chance. Take in the blanket of stars and the occasional shooting spark of light, the drifting space junk from various missions.
On the decks of ships during World War II, Steve had dealt with a bout or two of seasickness, so some of the stomach-in-the-throat feeling was familiar. When he’d been a regular person, before the serum had made him into Captain America, he used to get nauseous from the most mundane of things—slamming on the brakes too fast. Going to the doctor. Standing too close to a pretty girl.
to destroy an entire world to save one person. You never
(feat Clint hiding in vents and Nat remaining the leader of the Avengers, because i know what the people want).
“Some kind of explosion. The whole planet was destroyed.” Rocket shook his head. “I don’t think—”
“I never meant—”
to avoid listening to the voice in his head, the one that told him that it was all over, that he was kneeling in the middle of a battlefield once again, that no matter how fast he ran or how hard he fought, when it came to the people he loved the most, he would always be too late…
“Steve!” Tony shouted, racing after him.
“That’s not true.” Tony held out his hand, wanting to touch Steve, reassure him in some way, but Steve turned away from him, his fists clenching and unclenching.
“Because—” Tony stopped. What
His biggest regret was Steve. The words he’d hurled at him, in his all his hurt and rage. “Take the shield. It doesn’t belong to you anymore.”
“I wanted to see if it could be redirected.”
“Language.” Steve said softly. He was awake, but his head was still pillowed on his arms in a position that would have been excruciatingly uncomfortable for any normal human. Tony was furious to note that he somehow looked as though he’d had a full night’s rest in a soft bed, his hair mussed endearingly, his eyes soft and clear. Why did Steve always look so
“It’s too late, Tony. The Comet’s been destroyed, the radiation dissipated. Danvers and Wanda are on their way in right now.”
When they’d gone after Thanos, he certainly didn’t
“I didn’t piss it off. It…noticed me.”
“It was for research!” Tony grabbed Steve’s hand and held it tight. “I wouldn’t have tried to mess with the Comet without a good reason.”
“Here.” Nat tapped a blank space on the map. Just on the edge of the Milky Way Galaxy.”
For the first time since he’d made the suit in that cave, everything that was going wrong in the world, in the universe, had to be someone else’s problem.
“I think this is more of a question for Banner.”
Tony blinked. “Did they leave something out?”
“I can take care of myself.”
He’d thrown Steve’s love for him back in his face, bitterness and blood lacing his tongue. And how had Steve responded?
Tony sat back in his chair. Then he took a bite of burrito. “You believe in Fate?”
Steve looked down at their joined hands, an unreadable expression crossing his face, but he was silent. Tony seized the opportunity: “There was something I needed to learn. Something that I could only learn from a mass extinction event, a naturally occurring one. I had no way of knowing it would—and I wouldn’t have risked it if—”
“Tony?” It was Natasha, crackling over the comms.
As usual Tony simply steamrolled on. “Destiny. The cosmic order of the universe. Soulmates. That kind of thing.”
No such thing as sacrificing yourself for everyone else.
“Shit.” Tony said again.
“The thing we’re not supposed to worry about?”
Tony shrugged. “F.R.I.D.A.Y. can get them a ride. I offered to make the whole thing automated and just pay him for keeping it stocked, but he refused. Said it would be insulting to the craft of burrito-making.”
Steve nodded. He thought he finally understood what Tony was saying. “So you’re saying—how do you know if you’re in the right one?  If you made the right choice for this version of yourself?”
“Don’t you have Natasha for that?”
“Just get here. Now.”
Plus, he kept hearing Tony’s footsteps, pacing back and forth in his lab. But even when Steve had banged on the door to his lab, Tony had just ignored him.
“Of course, Captain Rogers.” F.R.I.D.A.Y. replied. “But there are no readings.”
“You know how it is, world’s gotta be saved, the purveyor of all that’s right and true hurls himself into the Hudson for no apparent reason…”
would you not bring back up with you?  Danvers at the very least!” Natasha said furiously. “You’re not an alien, Tony. You’re just—”
“Can’t believe I what?”
It terrified Steve to think that’s what Tony might be planning. He’d divorced Pepper. He wouldn’t talk to anyone, not even Nat or Rhodes. What if he was in that dark place? What if Steve couldn’t pull him out of it?
“That level of radiation is absolutely a threat to us!” Natasha burst out. “What the Hell is wrong with you? This could be another Thanos!”
Tony should have been resting after his ordeal, but he was awake. He was working on something.
He supposed he was lucky that it would end here, so that he could really look. There wasn’t an alien race bent on destroying New York, or a snotty kid from Queens following him around, or a former business partner with a vendetta that might destroy the world.
Steve shrugged. “You asked.”
what it means!” Steve exploded. “I’ve had enough.”
Steve took Tony’s hand, and Tony didn’t feel awake enough yet to comprehend how good it felt to feel Steve’s enormous hand encompassing his own, or to make some sarcastic comment about needing to be bought dinner first.
“Are you sending out a call?”
“But—”
“Me.” Steve and Natasha said together.
you.”
“Hey, lay off.” Steve said. “He looks pretty bad already.”
“Tony, come on.  I’m a spy.” Clint said.
“Exactly.” Tony whispered, leaning forward so close, Steve could smell the cologne he was wearing, sharp and spicy, like the night air. “What if I’m living the wrong life? What if I’m supposed to be somewhere—
“I’d prefer anyone who is not literally trained to die before betraying secrets to not know.”
“You want a ride back to shore?”
Tony awoke. “Shit.”
There was a mild uproar at this, and Tony sat back in his chair, willing his heartbeat to stay normal. During half of these meetings, he wanted to just hurl himself out the nearest window and disappear into the sky, somewhere everyone wasn’t always so disappointed in him.
Peter’s eyes flicked between the adults. “Did you guys have a fight again?  Because I’m on Steve’s side this time.”
“Listen. We didn’t have to take that route that day. We could have missed the ambush. And you—you could have gone to a different recruitment center. Managed not to turn yourself into a Capsicle. We just learned about the multiverse! Doesn’t that scare you? That there are a million possibilities of you running around right now, making different choices and following different destinies?”
“But Dr. Strange! I need to talk to him.”
to waste his night hours somewhere other than in front of the tv, he’d never leave his bed.
they might have missed.
“Steve!”
“Oh.” Rhodes sat down so heavily, the floor shook. “Great.”
It wasn’t the first time Steve had been suspicious of him, and it certainly wouldn’t be the last. Whenever Tony had made that Infinity Gauntlet, Steve had been sure that he would try to use it himself.
with you.” Steve turned so that his eyes met Tony’s. “But you do it anyway, Tony. The thing that’s coming for us right now obliterated the dinosaurs. And you brought it here because you were bored.”
“What’s going on?” Tony asked.
want you to do.” Steve said. “We can’t have all the Avengers out in space, kid.”
“But, Steve—” Nat walked over to him, and whispered something in his ear.
“He’s not dead.” Rhodes interrupted, with a glance at Steve. “If he were, F.R.I.D.A.Y. would still be able to pick him up. He had the suit retrofitted with a beacon in case someone needed to retrieve his body after—after Thanos.”
He would have let him do anything.
Tony and Steve leapt to their feet. Nat was striding toward them, the door to her sleek black car open, the engine still running. “We have a problem. Meeting in 10.”
“Great. Butch Cassidy and the Space Raccoon.”
“That’s what we’re trying to figure out.” Rhodes said grimly. “He was off on a routine flyby of the upper atmosphere, just testing his suit’s spaceflight capabilities—”
“You nearly froze to death.”
Those blue eyes were cutting. Tony could practically feel the gouge marks they left in his chest.
And how was Tony ever supposed to keep up with it?
There was a screech of tires. “Tony!”
“He’s right. Machines can’t replace everything.”
“If he doesn’t want to help us, he doesn’t have to.” Steve glared at him. “Wouldn’t be the first time.”
And he still wouldn’t tell Steve why.
“Aren’t you linked into his vitals, something—”
He’d crashed a plane into the ice in ’45, and woken up in the 21
Tony tipped his head to the side. “We travelled back in time and saved half the universe. You don’t think there was a little divine intervention pulling for us? God or the universe or whatever you wanna call it?”
Steve was trying not to think about Tony steam-drying his underwear.  He was also trying not to think about the fact that he’d stripped completely naked with Tony less than five feet away, that Tony would have been able to hear Steve’s harsh breathing, that if Tony had wanted to look, Steve would have let him.
“Right or left of me?”
Now, Nat sighed and redid her hair, throwing it up in a bun that would keep it out of her face. Steve knew she only did that when she was expecting a difficult fight. Typically, Nat fought with her hair down for “the added difficulty and the aesthetic.”
But maybe where Steve was concerned, none of the old rules applied. Maybe there were only exceptions.
Tony looked back at Steve. “You’re wondering what had me going into space? Deep space? Where I inadvertently ran into a planet-destroying weapon?”
“I’m not asking Banner. I don’t wanna talk to a scientist. You let yourself get experimented on in the hopes of serving your country, of fighting for what’s right.”
In the last few years especially, Tony played fast and loose with his mortality. It was like he walked into every fight expecting it to be his last, like he
Tony was silent for a long moment. Then he looked at Natasha. “By God, he’s finally learned some sarcasm. Someone call Page Six.”
Take it all in, one last time, before it ended.
“That’s enough.” Steve said.
Rocket narrowed his eyes. “How about someone who’s actually done an EVA before?”
“Just—do you
Steve was still standing. “Tell me how it goes.”
Tony waited until their voices had faded down the corridor, then a little bit longer; he couldn’t ever discount super-soldier hearing. “I need to speak to Dr. Strange.”
“I need someone to help with the press.” Tony said. “Can you go with me?”
He felt a weight at the end of his hospital bed and looked up to see Pepper on one side and Steve on the other. Both seemed to have pulled up a chair and fallen asleep with their heads resting on the bed. Pepper’s hair was a red fan against the white sheets. She was still dressed in an impeccable suit, her hair in a flawless ponytail.
“Tony, you know this isn’t right.” Steve didn’t pull away, or throw him off, which was another sure sign that this was a dream.
Steve nodded, gripping the bar at the edge of the observation deck so hard, he could feel his fingers making dents in the metal.
Steve raced down the street, urging the bike to higher and higher speeds, racing along the edge of the Hudson River.  He did this sometimes—circled the perimeter of the compound while the others slept, even occasionally drove all the way into the city and back before the sun came up.
There were no more tricks to pull. No more suits to pull out of spare parts and last-ditch innovations. No new elements to discover or rediscover.
Tony lay back against the pillows and closed his eyes. How could
This was the end of Iron Man.
‘That’s an order, Mr. Stark” A dimple showed in Natasha’s cheek as she smiled.
“We’re coming up on his coordinates right now,” Rocket said from his position by the controls.
Steve’s eyes flashed. “I can’t
Then, Clint dropped down from the rafters, landing nearly on top of Rocket, who swore. “Where was he last seen?”
“I wanted some burritos. You in?”
“But—”
“Wait I’m confused,” Banner said. “There’s another being hell-bent on destroying Earth, all because Tony pissed it off?”
Steve shook his head and opened the throttle, and the bike shot forward, bursting past a barricade that lay in front of a bit of construction. The road grew bumpy, and then rocky, and then Steve was racing over a dock, the wind whistling in his ears.
Tony wasn’t eating much. He’d ordered a burrito bowl ‘to lay off the carbs’, but he was mostly pushing his food around, his brow furrowed.
, none of this would have happened. Maybe he could have found the right words to tell Steve what he’d never understood:  Accords weren’t a straitjacket, they were a lifeline. And Tony was a broken man with a broken heart, barely hanging on.
“Danvers says she’s taking care of it,” Rhodey said. “She’ll handle it out there.”
Steve waved him quiet. “I mean, we saved the day. Crisis cancelled. Earth is safe. Who cares if it was supposed to happen? It happened.”
“Um. I got lost. In space.” Tony said. “Are you familiar with the concept? They made a movie and a TV series and everything.”
It was less than eight hours since Tony had been dying in space, and here he was, already planning some other harebrained suicide mission.
But I wasn’t there for you, Tony thought, wishing there was someone around to transmit these last thoughts, this last apology, to Earth. I should have been there. Should have listened. Should have understood.
Parker sighed. “Fine.” He leapt off the ship and disappeared, swinging through the Manhattan skyline.
“We were worried about you.” Pepper interjected. “I was worried—”
Tony took another bite of the burrito bowl and chewed thoughtfully. Then he reached into his pocket and pulled out a sheaf of paper. He held it up. It was nearly see-through, but Steve could tell what was on it— “The suit?”
“I’m not letting you leave without me.” Steve’s eyes met Quill’s, and something in the other man’s seem to widen in recognition when Steve said. “It’s
“It’s a chemical spill cleanup.” Tony said. “And I still think I should be out there.”
“So is that your sense of Fate? Destiny? Everything feels like the only path for you?”
“Well—yes.”
“I don’t wanna be the one to say this,” Nat said, measuring her words carefully. “But couldn’t he be—”
“I—that is not true!” Tony sputtered.
All for a threat he wouldn’t tell anyone about.
Tony nodded. “Would you say you felt like you were supposed to?”
“It’s where F.R.I.D.A.Y. last picked up his readings.”
And then darkness crushed him like a blanket.
Something about Steve always seemed to strip that part of him away, break it down to the thinnest barrier. Tony always wondered how he’d managed to come off so sarcastic and arrogant whenever Steve was near, when Steve always made him feel like he was so fragile, like his skin was made of glass, bound to shatter at the slightest touch, at the smallest movement.
a kid. Thanos had taken that from all of them, along with five years that they could never get back, and the countless billions who had died as part of the collateral damage, from the battles in Wakanda and the last showdown at the Avengers compound. It had been a miracle that they’d been able to revive Tony after he’d snapped Thanos out of existence.
going?”  Steve asked.
“So what is it, exactly?” Rhodes asked.
“If you need me, I’ll be there.”
“Sure.”
“So what is your deal?  Why do you—you know—” Tony imitated a dive.
Tony thought.
“And you came out to see it because—” Thor was running a hand over his eyes, as though even the effort of looking at Tony was exhausting.
No one could stay a kid after that
“You idiot,” said Natasha. “What are we supposed to do about that now?”
to sign.” Tony walked around the desk to sit beside him. He really should have known it was a dream by this point, because he would never have put his hand on Steve’s shoulder otherwise, never allowed his fingers to squeeze on the hard ridge of muscle and tendon there, to feel the corded power and tension beneath his hands, like a switch that could flip on at any second.
“There’s no ‘before,’ Stark. I’m not risking Earth’s extinction for your research.”
“Right.” Tony killed his thrusters and dropped back down to the platform, landing a little harder than he meant to.
“But you don’t want Steve and the kid to know.”
The Avengers were assembled in the conference room at the compound. Steve had barely looked at Tony since Natasha had given them the news, and Tony was still trying to keep everything in. He’d been so close to saying it to Steve, what he meant, the reason he had tried to redirect an elemental force of destruction.
“Eleven o’clock is to the
“You’re doing it again! The Chitauri, Ultron. That goddamn gauntlet. Every time you throw yourself in the line of fire, you never think about who else might pay the price. It’s all to feed your own hubris.”
This was just a man with a broken suit, waiting for his oxygen to run out in a universe that was already destroyed.
, and I was just this kid who had to stay home and watch the reels and pretend that recycling rubber was the same as serving. Bucky was shipping out, and he was leaving me behind. I had to do
He wrenched his hand out of Tony’s and turned to walk further down the corridor. There was an elevator door, but Steve ignored it and kicked open the entrance to the stairs.
in space at the moment. So where the hell did you get your information, and what the hell are we going to do make sure that the next planet to be destroyed isn’t, I don’t know,
“Tony—”
Steve looked away. “You really should be resting.”
“LEFT.” Steve shouted. He could see it, too. A gleam of fire-engine red, covered in a sheen of frost.
to stare down the barrel of an enemy’s gun, go out in a blaze of glory.
“But I’m fascinated, Rogers! This is so unlike you. Are you an adrenaline junkie? You gonna start jumping out of planes without a parachute? Wait—”
“What were you doing in that corner of the galaxy? And
“What?”
“Wait—what is that?’ Nat stepped up beside him, her eyes narrowing. “There. Eleven o’clock.”
In his nightmares, Steve still remembered that lost look in Tony’s eyes after he’d used the Stones, the way they’d lighted on him for just a moment before growing vacant, Peter and Pepper’s sobs echoing in his ears. In his nightmares, the despair sank Steve onto his knees, and he his limbs felt impossibly heavy as he listened to Peter’s desperate pleading, to the barely concealed devastation in Pepper’s voice.  In his nightmares, Tony’s eyes stayed vacant and lost forever, and Steve woke up half certain he was still kneeling on that dusty battlefield, watching the reason that he’d finally become part of the world again turn to ash and die in front of him, over and over.
Steve and Tony have a late-night conversation, and Steve gets closer to learning the truth of Tony's fascination with the comet
At exactly the right moment, he pulled on the brakes and launched himself into the air, sending himself into an arc, cannonballing into the Hudson.
“A little busy, Stark. Can this wait?” Danvers sounded smooth and calm. But she was a pilot. That could mean anything.
“Why do you tinker in your lab?”
It was true: Parker
When he emerged on the ground floor, it was to the sound of the motorcycle’s roar as it raced out of the parking garage and into the street.
Of course Steve probably didn’t think about it. He was the Star Spangled Man. He was the paragon of truth and justice in the galaxy. Why the Hell would he ever wonder if he should have done something differently?”
“Tony.” Natasha said warningly.
“Keep your voice down.” Steve jerked his head behind him, where Parker had fallen asleep  in an armchair against the back wall, his head lolling, his mouth half-open. As Tony watched, the kid let out an almighty snore.
But he’d known that Thor was there. He’d known there must be a way. A loophole he hadn’t though of. Some bit of alien technology that might help him.
“You ever think about that, though? About what’s ‘supposed to happen.’ You ever think about the multiverse?”
He looked out again at the stars, trying to soak them all in. Trying to make up for all the times he hadn’t looked up, before he’d realized that the sky was beautiful, and everywhere, especially when you were a part of it.
“No.” Tony dialed into the comms on his watch. There was a ring, and then Steve’s voice. “I don’t want to hear it.”
“Company’s fine. That’s why I’m running it, remember? Because if the company was tied to you, it would have been sucked into the vacuum of space a long time ago.”
“That’s what the propaganda posters say, yeah.”
“We just reversed an extinction-level event.” Steve strode to the other side of the bridge and looked out over the city. “Thanos destroyed trillions. And I thought you’d learned something, something about poking into things that only boil over and—.”
Once there, he sank to the floor, hearing Steve’s voice in his ears over and over, thinking of the Comet, and his last opportunity which had crumbled into nothing.
for help! It went against all the rules of the universe for Tony Stark to ask another Avenger how to solve a problem, especially one that involved time travel and quantum physics.
“What?”
That hadn’t been true then, and it wasn’t now.
Steve rubbed a hand against his jaw. “Yes.”
Steve started down the stairs, as fast as a super soldier could go. Cursing his humanity for the millionth time, Tony raced for the elevator and pressed the buttons frantically.
“We’ve talked enough, Tony. I’m not going to be part of your experiments anymore. The world is saved. I’m done.”
Steve sighed.
“Oh Tony, I didn’t ever really think a little thing like divorce would get rid of you. But now that I know you’re alright—the stock was starting to take a little dip, what with your MIA status and all. So—” She bent to kiss him again, shot Steve a meaningful look, then swept out of the room.
. He knew it, I know it-” When Tony eventually meets Steve’s eyes he sees a weariness that has nothing to do with needing rest. “It’s probably why he hid the backup. Cause I’m too much of a coward to deal with that.” He suspects they both share that look. Maybe Steve’s not so certain of his own convictions after all.
pressured by Pepper, and three doctors, to remain. The device forced into his hands as compensation.
Steve crosses his arms, “So have you. Words can’t begin to describe how devastated I was.
?” Tony finally snaps. Steve doesn’t respond, and the absence of his voice makes Tony want to turn around just to check if he’s actually still there, “Of anyone. Instead it was me. You got gunned down for me. Others got gunned down for me.”
“Do I get a kiss first?”
He can’t think of anything sufficient to add that wouldn’t sound like polluting Steve’s sweet, succinct resolve. It’s as if something opens, another path. These are the words he needs. He holds no illusions that it will be easy, but neither of them has ever taken the easy route nor would they ask each other to.
“Unless
He bends over and quickly but gently kisses Steve’s cheek, it tastes of sweat and hospital.
“No it’s not-“ Tony protests. Clint flips him off.
“You keep forgetting that you were injured too.” Steve gives a gentle head shake. “It wasn’t your fault. Yes, you could have handled it better, I may be angry in a couple weeks, I was angry at myself. But you didn’t shoot the gun, nor the crowd, and many others were already beyond saving. And
,” Clint corrects, just as persnickety as Tony was with him.
Steve seems to have picked up on his reservations, for he’s filled with surprise when Steve gives him blunt honesty.
Steve turns back to Tony, “Don’t worry, Tony, it’ll be an amazing experience. You can serenade us with your ballads of victory while we beat back the tides of our enemies.”
With racing breaths, the sounds around him withdraw again, and almost with grainy film quality verging on not quite right, he’s back there in this memory. With the police and the screaming crowds and cameras and all the rolling ones and zeros. Then he sees nothing but that
“Why did you grab
It’s not fair. He can barely remember anything surrounding his deaths, if you can even call them that, and he’s now coming upon terminal velocity in this one-way freefall towards Steve, not even the intended target. With his absence of opinion Steve takes it as cue to continue.
“Why even ask that? It’s a logical fallacy.”
Steve blinks at him, and before he has a chance to speak Tony cuts him off by continuing.
“Tony?”
Tony remembers well after his own bout of back damage just how important pain is to nothing. The serum will pull him through, all evidence suggests so. “We can figure something out.”
Tony looks in defiance, stubborn in face of Steve’s refusal.
“I like paladins.”
an archer in game anyway. Most of the time you’ve already destroyed the monsters with your bullshit stats and spells before I even get a measly shot in.”
playing again and again (he must have run it over a thousand times). The blood, the gunshots (three of them), the sounds, the constant buzz as he streams the live footage through his brain (again). His mind makes up the smells and the taste of the air fouled with gunsmoke and fear. Steve’s death- but he isn’t-
It also made him an easy and predictable figure to find, however. Steve inevitably came in, struggling on crutches. The sight of him churns into fresh feelings of guilt that Tony hadn’t had the motivation to meet him in his own home when he got here from the hospital. Some partner he is.
These are Tony’s problems not Steve’s. He’s got his own problems to deal with without having Tony offload onto him as well. Not when Steve is the one sporting enough holes trying to protect people like a
“But you never do unless you control everything,” Clint rebuffs, balancing a pen.
Steve frowns but his mannerism suggests he expected Tony’s behaviour. “Seems to be a pretty safe place. Solid walls, controlled environment, no people, no unexpected gunfire-“
“I remember,” Tony almost whispers.
“It’s a
“I nominate Steve, the Amazon.”
It’s a half-assed attempt at downgrading Steve’s fears. He still can’t smile, despite the ridiculous image. Even Steve awake can’t seem to pull his smile out.
“I keep thinking what happened and all I see is you there,” the last word cracks, “bleeding out.”
“Found it in a box. Wasn’t labelled.” He can tell Steve’s shocked. “Checked it out. It was the memory backup I
This does draw a smile from Tony, and he realises he feels much better than he had. Not great, but he genuinely thinks, for the first time, he might be able to put this aside. Make new memories.
Clint looks at Steve with a calculating smile.
villainous?” Tony asks, looking something between peeved and stubborn.
Tony snickers at Clint’s misfortune.
“It’s good to see you awake.” Tony’s smile feels somewhat forced, but it’s genuine.
“Been in the hospital for a week. Nothing terribly detrimental long term, besides muscle damage. I’m probably gonna be walking round with a cane for a month, though.”
it to you,” pointing a finger right at him.
Steve gives a small frown until he brightens with a playful smirk. “Can you make me a hover chair like Xavier?” Steve asks him cheekily.
“Neither of us had any time to react-“
“There was a little girl there- I don’t even know if she made it.” His angry tone slips, but he isn’t sure nor game enough to check if he’d now attacked Steve personally, reminding him of his failures though few. “It should have been someone else.”
themselves acquired PTSD?” Tony snorts with pure self-deprecation.
“Sorry. I’ll make it up to you,” Tony says apologetically.
“It’s not your fault. I didn’t die, then or now. You were reacting to an unprocessed fear.” And when Steve brings up psychosomatic logic, it annoys him cause why can’t he see how much Tony is a fuck up.
“You died.”
Tony couldn’t possibly feel more ashamed than now. Even at Steve’s perceived worst, he’s at his best. Steve remains silent and it’s enough for Tony to relent.
Tony’s eyes widen, and he looks stunned. Clint could almost see the BSoD in Tony’s mind. Tony blinks a couple times and shakes it off, there is a moment of dejection before his expression cools to snubbed.
He hears a faint ruffling of sheets and looks to see Steve dazedly checking his surroundings until he locks onto Tony seated beside the bed on the chair he has been in for a couple of hours.
“Yes, I have been here the whole time.” Tony says, purposely choosing the wrong question to answer.
“You are not playing villain again,” Steve reiterates.
“I can play a villainous hero outside of being Dungeon Master.” Tony rebuffs, “I can
He lets out a breath to clear his head, and the sharp glow of the Starkpad comes back into view.
“The last time you played Dungeon Master, nobody won because you took your villain persona
His breath hitches remembering the sight, seeing the disturbing amount of blood pooling beside him from a slumped over Steve. It’s flowing down a little incline under where they landed, trapping in a groove.
. And it’s my fault, my fault-“
He walks out.

“Hey.” Steve glares at Tony, looking betrayed, and gives Clint a hard look.
Steve looks disturbed by what Tony says, and he wonders if Steve’s recounting the same incident his own betraying mind can’t seem to pick at, but he could dismiss it as simply being the post-waking daze.
“I thought I would learn something

“I’m the Dungeon Master, that’s what I do,” Tony says, exasperated now.
…” Steve fidgets briefly until Tony sees that look of resolve paint his face that always awed him. “It’s time to make some new memories.”
Tony’s eyes scrunch in partially forced mirth at the pretty ugly attempt at humour when Steve’s been reduced to crutches at best. He reminds himself to pull out some of the leftover exo-frames. He can do so much better than a standard issue hospital device.
“At least I
“I, I really wish you told someone before doing this to yourself. Sticking those old memories into your head; it was a long time ago. And my back? Yeah it sucks, but I’ll heal, I’ll get better.” It is hard on him, hearing the obvious break in Steve’s voice as he bravely attempts to comfort Tony with platitudes he doesn’t believe himself.
It’s been two days since he and Steve had talked in the hospital room. Straight after his waking, knowing Steve was alright, Tony had discharged himself from the hospital and found himself in his workshop, feeling far more relieved than he should have at surrounding solid reinforced walls and no one to judge him.
He’s not unaware of the ghost that will forever reside in his mind from now on. But maybe new memories can ward it off.
“Which villain was it this time?” Steve casually asks, taking no time to set events straight. Of course, Steve hadn’t seen what happened, he was too busy bleeding out-
“Smart,” Tony approves.
“Yes, maybe it should have been someone else. But you are the one I was next to, and I can’t change that. I made a
“You’ve only just woken up, but you’ve been here just as long. Complications. I can pass you your chart.” When he looks back into Steve’s eyes he still can’t say it. Instead, he deflects. “Look, Steve, you’re probably gonna be down for a while.”
. I’m not going to tell you I regret saving you, because I
“Yeah. Smart. Who else purposely
from me.” Steve pauses for a breath, looking somewhat incensed by the last point, then his expression mellows. “You didn’t fail anyone.”
Clint knows it's not
Blinking out of his recollection, Tony looks at Steve on a dare to prove it’s not Steve, it’s him. It’s another half of a truth.
Tony shakes his head. “Wasn’t a villain the second time. Just a regular crazy person angry at the world. Unloaded a high powered automatic rifle from across the street into the crowd from his apartment. They didn’t even bring him in. He popped shots into his own head before they got to him.”
“Well ok. Bard it is.” Tony says, not at all enthused for the role.
“I say Reed does it,” Clint suggests, all too happy to get out of the way of their childish spat.
He only stayed so he could be
magic, you always play a wizard!”
“That team comp has many holes in it. Also, you double dipped on allocating roles, Clint.” Reed once again breaks up their banter.
“Tony, why won’t you look at me?”
. I didn’t. It was a mistake.” Steve has visibly clenched his jaw with obvious unease, but Tony keeps going. “I mean, it didn’t really matter much when I did it, I’d already known about everything already. Most of those experiences were old. But, out there, I saw you shot up… and I was useless. I didn’t do anything. I kept… seeing you dead on the steps. I wasn’t even there. And I kept seeing
They all have a type in a way, Clint realizes. Even though they’ve been dabbling in D&D for months now, it never felt like they had bypassed their waking lives. “He’s right.” Clint chuckles. Tony frowns. “Urgh, do I have to spell it out? Okay then. Despite you always professing how much you
rejected.” Tony takes a moment to think it through. But Steve couldn’t possibly believe that of him. He’s wrong, because there is no differentiation between Tony now and some 8-year-old memories from the worst time of his life.
“I’m fine.”
We both live dangerous lives Tony. We’ve both have done stupid things and had stupid things happen to us.”
His taped-up middle is starting to itch. Tony resists scratching his healing midsection by trying to distract himself with reviewing some of the backlog of business emails and messages, but he’s neither truly focused nor in the mood to do the work. He’s not on pain meds, and he’s kind of regretting it.
Steve nods with a raised eyebrow, half his face obscured with a dozen character sheets in his hand.
“Who said I’d let you?”
The sun’s setting for the eighth day now. The last golden beams filter through the city, breaking up what would have been a magnificent view, if the occupant had been awake. Tony continues to flick through his workload on a Starkpad Pepper had loaned him when he had demanded to leave, only to be
“Hey, I was actually looking forward to spending time being cripple buddies together.” Steve chuckles with a gentle nudge.
“Says Clint, the archer that plays a D&D archer,” Tony grumbles.
“I’m not getting into this,” Reed says, flipping up his hand to dismiss the argument away.
“No,” Steve says bluntly.
, I let people down, people
“Clint, the Dancer.” Steve gives him an amused sly look saying that he had that coming. He sure did.
“Same thing.”
story. You’re there to roll the dice, not let the dice roll for you.” Clint feels the need to burst in, supporting Steve’s grievances wholeheartedly.
“It’s a
“I just can’t see it happening. You have a type,” Reed pipes in. Tony scrunches his face into a halfhearted sneer Reed’s way.
Tony gets the jist. “Are you here for that talk?”
“You may as well be playing yourself!”
“You do tend to be competitive,” Reed, their fourth team member, interjects neutrally from the sidelines, checking a dossier.
He does give Steve that kiss. A brief but honest one. He still doesn’t move though so he resigns himself on not getting out of this.
He can imagine Steve rolling his eyes, and he suspects that is the case when he hears a sigh as he half-heartedly reassembles some component he had lying on his desk just to look busy.
“Ok, so maybe our little group is a little stuck in a rut. We should change it up, use other classes we don’t normally go for,” Tony suggests.
“Tony….”
“So, what you are saying…” Tony turns to face Steve, “is that I am
Here, with Steve.
Tony stiffens.
“You do feel the important bits though?” Steve proceeds to wiggle his toes, but it’s obvious he’s not getting the usual sensations.
after taking a risk to find some sense of closure. Bad choice, yes. But you had the courage to pick it up and take those memories back that
“Just keep looking.” Steve stepped closer to the window, scanning the bodies, the gleaming hunks of spacecraft.
There was debris everywhere, the remnants of various ships and disasters, what looked like an alien or two that had been caught outside the airlock too late.
“That’s pretty dark for the Star Spangled Man.” Tony said.
It was a habit Steve had gotten into during the blip, when there had been less ships in the harbor, less people on the streets. But ever since, he’d craved that clarity that came from flying through the air. There was always a point where he felt almost weightless, where the adrenaline and the wind and the awareness of his own body flipped the switch on all the negative thoughts in his head.
“He could have been more aware of his surroundings when flying.”
“I do not-” Tony starts to say. He wets his lips. “She’s agreeable but I don’t wish to marry anyone.”
“I made my calls when I arrived last year,” Steve replied. “I could do that again, I guess.”
~~~~~
His conversation with Rhodey had put final damage to his battered hope. His friend had simply refused to continue the conversation.
Sensing Tony’s discomfort, Jarvis decides to stop talking. His gaze lands on the flowers of Lady Virginia Potts standing sluggishly in a long vase, with her book and letter underneath, still unopened. Tony follows the direction of his look and huffs.
So Tony had sworn to himself that he will move on once the holidays are over, working on projects, meeting new people while taking care of the ones he already has by his side. Steve can keep scowling at him like he always does, his horrible soulmark can burn as much as it wants, he won't give a shit about either of these two things anymore!
“I’m working,” Tony protested and Steve responded by taking off Tony’s glasses and prying the phone from his hand.
“I just didn’t want you to be sad anymore,” Peter said.
All that he could see was his -- the house behind the orchard and garden, the rolling fields, and this creek and tree. The rest of his property extended into woodlands and fields farmed by tenants.
But never in his life did he think about the indignity of not being able to pass something down to your child.
The fairy who had been sitting on Steve’s hand had slid down into a prone position. Steve gently poked at him. “No sleep for you until you’re fine.”
“You don’t seem to be doing that badly in retirement.”
Tony marvels at all the possibilities behind these new machines his father has since spoken about for weeks, to the point he had left behind his designs of naval artillery and pistols so he can be engrossed in wheels, pumps and pistons. Sometimes, when no one is looking, he sketches machines from his wildest imagination, drawing small pieces like rotating cogs connected in a circular motion like a planet to its sun, the ensemble-driven by steam. These small pieces turn into big imaginary travel devices. In his mind, they look like a series of closed carriages made of metal, lead by a bigger one from where the fuming and pumping energy comes from and advancing at full speed thanks to strong wheels rolling on tracks. They would link all the cities of his Majesty’s lands so it would only take a few hours to travel instead of days. And, when he feels bolder, he dreams of the sky. He dreams of metallic ships as round as balloons, flying high thanks to steam, and transporting people without any risk of sinking or being struck by lightning.
Tony proffered another tiny list. “You’re not supposed to know we exist,” he added. “It’s the whole fairy code.”
“Do the fairy thing,” Sam agreed.

Thank you to all the people who left amazing and sweet comments at the second chapter :3 I'll take the time to answer each one !
There will be :
Unless it's something more problematic, like a genuine attraction similar to the one he used to feel for Mr Stone. The matters of the heart are so complicated sometimes you can feel a powerful crush for someone then finding yourself at a loss when it suddenly disappears  like it never existed in the first place. This happened to Tony on many occasions though he admits he had taken an instant liking to Mr Rogers the moment he came to their house. The blonde Omega kept doing his best at his work, even if his health condition leaves a lot to be desired. Between his difficult breathing, scoliosis, and impaired hearing - Tony even suspects him to have poor eyesight but he never asked him - it’s thanks to his tenacity he survived for so long. Truly, it’s no hardship to admire him or secretly wishing to be his friend. How different it is now. The shift in his feelings had been so intense, Tony wonders if it has ever been here from the beginning, lurking in the corners of his mind, and revealing itself once the opportunity had arisen.
They danced twice, enraptured in their conversations. Tony hadn’t resisted her offer. His heart had skipped a beat the few times her gaze locked on his. He heard many people muttering in his back, considering how lovely they looked together, wondering if Lady Virginia Potts would court him or not. She had blushed demurely when she admitted she did found him fascinating to talk to, never interrupting him when he had spoken with pride about the recent weapons for heavy artillery his father had created and would soon show. She shared some of her achievements at her classes and personal ideas for trade with other countries. All in all, the ball had been very pleasant in her company. If her hand had lingered on his arm a bit too long when she walked him alongside his mother to their carriage, he didn’t mention it. If he remarked how she shared some similarities with Mr Rogers, he keeps it to himself.
Constructive and gentle criticism, kudos, encouraging comments are loved without moderation.
Peter giggled. “You’re silly, Mr. Steve. It’s spelled dee-you-em-dash-ee. He’s is a robot and his name is actually ‘Dad’s Ultimate Machine Excavator’ because Daddy first built him with Uncle Rhodey to do some digging at the old Stark house, the one we never go to because Daddy says it’s haunted by all the ghosts of disappointed fathers, but I don’t know what that means, but I don’t want to ask because Daddy always looks sad when he talks about it and I don’t like it when Daddy is sad. Anyway, DUM-E is an early proto… prototype?”
“Daddy,” Peter said matter-of-factly as he got up and put his backpack on to run to the man in question.
“Hmmm,” Tony replied. He had spread out his drawings all over his side of the table.
“Oh, lord! It’s beautiful!” One of them gushes at the flower patterns, lifting their hand as if they imagine touching it.
“I’M FINE, STEVE,” Peter called back from his place on the playground, a few hundred yards from where Steve and Tony were sitting on a bench.
“It’s just-” Tony wets his lips, his heart pounding with iron fists against his ribcage. “I’m sorry. I wanted to apologize. I saw you both two weeks ago and I - I hope I didn’t interrupt anything or - Well - I didn’t talk about it to anyone-” Tony ruffles his hair with one of his hands to get his restlessness under control.
Unfortunately, this embarrassing episode had created an irreparable rift between Steve and Tony. Rumlow leaving three days after didn't change anything. Tony struggles to talk to the blond now because he knows how Steve looks when he’s lost in pleasure, and it conjures way too many fantasies in Tony’s head. He can’t risk embarrassing Steve even more with a confession he doesn't want to receive or worse.
“Last I saw he had stepped out to look at a carriage,” Steve said. He turned his head back and forth looking for Bucky in the crowd.
“Steve, this place is lovely and I am enjoying our visit. We’ve all seen how you’ve perked up being around people. But --” Natasha said.
Attached was a PDF entitled “Stark Futures NDA - Personal” and his phone buzzed quickly with another incoming email.
“What if I was out?”
Tony had lovely manners for an alpha, though he fell on the prettier side of the scale than the handsome side. He could be mistaken for an omega if he went out and about with his wavy hair arranged artfully and the color of his face brought out with an ascot. Steve’s makeshift clothes did not do Tony any justice at all.
But would Steve have room on his dance card for Tony, who should not have been late? Who wouldn’t want to dance with Steve?
The tea bell rang. “Back to work,” Steve said. “I’ve strategized my share of battles at sea but all this ball planning is rough work.”
“Well, you’ll still take a good washing, you hear me?” Steve sniffs in disdain. He feels his body growing warmer as Bucky takes his trousers off, showing his strong thighs and his gorgeous ass to Steve's hungry gaze.
“My last rank was commodore, actually,” Steve replied. Despite all his honor and successes in the field, Steve did not have the political pull to be named Rear Admiral. Lack of political connections was in fact worse than being an omega. “I could not be promoted so it was more life at sea or retirement.”
“I needed a moment to myself,” Peter replied, and Steve bit back a smile. It was Peter’s standard answer whenever he retreated to the corner of the coat closet - which Steve believed was his favorite spot. He’d get his stuffed spider from his cubby and curl into the corner. The answer was so quintessentially Peter - polite to a fault, exceptionally mature, and yet earnest in the way that only five-year-olds can be.
“Huh. Ok. Alright. So?” Steve asks with a more appeased tone, inviting him to speak more.
And the hatchet falls.
His resolve broke when a soft breeze ruffled the papers on his desk. He tossed his pen on the desk, folded up his papers and decided he had better things to do. Steve gathered his sketchbook, paints, and a picnic hamper and headed out for a lovely afternoon of working on his art. Before leaving, he tied up his short blond hair in a blue ribbon and put on his favorite embroidered muslin dress and blue spenser jacket.
“What about that rich handsome Omega you fancy?” James interrupts smugly. “You could work for him, see him every day. It would be like heaven for you.”
One of the great joys of his retirement lay in Steve’s clothes. Freed from the constraints of having to dress like the male alphas and betas he commanded, Steve was able to indulge in wearing dresses and jewelry like other omegas. Steve wasn’t built like the other omegas. He’d been blessed with height, muscly arms, and broad shoulders. A good body for hard work at sea, not so much for the lovely and graceful dresses Steve longed to wear.
“It's fine. It's fine.” Steve says, raising his hands to placate her. “Come on. Give me a bit of space, I’ll show you.” He adds with an aggravated sigh.
There was no way that Tony Stark was an omega.
“I’m just really confused, Matt,” Steve confessed.
“Fairies have a lot of magic,” Steve said. “That’s what my ma told me. Sam -- that lovely beta over there has been trying to catch your eye since she arrived.”
Tony pushed forward, just as the first notes of the next dance sounded. “Can I have the next dance?” he blurted out, as he looked up at Steve.
“We’ll have to figure it out. Paper and something to write with should be easy.” Steve tapped his pen thoughtfully against his chin. “He’s going to be with us until his wings heal.”
Sam shuffled the newspaper. “The mill a few miles from here is opening soon for business.”
“My mom is always in charge,” MJ said.
“So, Peter could know his parental alpha, but Tony’s keeping him -”
Before joining his friends in the drawing room, Steve slipped outside to a small garden to the side of the house, just beyond the kitchen garden, for a short walk to consider what he had actually agreed to over dinner. He had plans to expand this garden and build a small summer house for the hot days. But all that were ideas on blueprints back in his study. Tonight he walked through old paths and overgrown flower beds.
Matt laughed.
“Thank you.” Steve grins at her. His voice is so hoarse he wonders if she managed to understand his words.
Blinking and yawning, Tony rubbed his head. He wasn’t entirely sure where he was. He flew right into a brick wall -- wham, bam, and he woke up in a nest of fine linen under a quilted tent, smelling of human. Wait, he didn’t exactly fly into a brick wall, he flew into -- um, a well-endowed chest. It was a very nice chest, even if it was attached to a human.
But it's too late now.
"Thank you, mother.” Tony joins her on the bench. “You did a fine picking here!” He slips the dandelion’s petals through his fingers. “Our stomachs won’t have any trouble during the winter thanks to you.”
~~~~~
Tony could see the outline of the human as he approached. He shivered from a cold breeze from the window. Then the human’s scent hit him, sweet and floral with wood tones. Omega. Likely unbonded as well. Tony sighed exasperatedly. He did not need this. He’d been good, decent, even ate his vegetables occasionally. Why him?
“You’re welcome.”
Steve hesitated, then his eyes grew wide when he recognized Tony. “You may -- Mr.?”
“Yeah, Ned?”
“I forgot to turn off the Google alert like you told me to,” Steve grumbled as he leaned down to kiss Tony gently before settling into the lounge chair next to him. News had broken the week before that Tony Stark was dating his son’s former teacher and the internet had
“OH! DADDY! YOU HAVE TO SEE MY CROWN.”
Mr Hammer. A slimy Alpha, confident, ambitious and completely unashamed of how ridiculous he looks in public. Brash, inelegant, those were the first words Tony thought when he faced him with a forced smile. People seemed to only tolerate him because they were either too polite not to invite him or too mindful of how rich he is, how generous he could be with people he considers his close friends. He had tried to monopolize Tony’s attention during the entire ball. He had even dared to touch the back of his neck during their dance, pretending the foul gesture was accidental when his smile had said the opposite. Tony had wanted to push him away to the cost of disrupting the dancers around him. It’s Lady Virginia Potts’ sweet manners barely covering her barbed remarks thrown at the Alpha’s mortified face which had saved them both their reputations. When Tony had wanted to sit near the opened windows to get some fresh air, she had dutifully accompanied him only using her elbow as support for his hand. She had sat next to him until he felt better, her protective Alpha scent blocking all the other smells around. Tony had raised his gaze to thank her. He noticed for the first time that night how clear her blue eyes were under the candlelights of the ceiling, how fair and unblemished her skin was, how brightly her long reddish-blond hair shone.
“How are you powering this mill?” Sam asked.
“I’m sorry you had to wait with me, Mr. Steve,” Peter said at one point as Steve played on his phone and Peter read his book.
"Antonio!" His mother lifts her head, a brilliant smile on her face. "I was wondering when you would show yourself! Come! Sit with me, my love." She pats affectionately on the free spot next to her.
If you're not comfortable with nakedness and sexual content, I advise you to leave this page :o
“Okay, buddy, but no one but Mr. Steve, okay? And in the future, ask me first before you decide I need a friend?”
“That mill though.” Tony sighed deeply. “I hope that the mill owner hasn’t restarted or fixed all the things I sabotaged. If he destroys the forest, innumerable fairies and other creatures will lose their homes and be turned out into the world. There’s not many places to go that have that old earth magic like that old forest.” Steve nodded. “It’s so wasteful, Steve -- he’d be better off using a mill wheel or the sun to power the mill -- see I figured out how to harness the sun’s light to run the mill --”
There was a world within that ‘but.’ He knew Nat far too well. “Preparations, though,” Steve pondered.
“Injured bird?” Sam asked.
Steve closed his eyes and remembered the absolute chaos of the Academy Award winning actress admitting she was an omega and having her Oscars stripped from her.
“I hope it’s not too much of a glow,” he said. As a rule, his heats had been very manageable since they started and he had a lot of experience hiding them. He was fairly regular, the heats were mild and easily concealed. He even consulted a calendar when selecting the date of the ball to avoid the possibility of a heat. “I’m not due for another three weeks.”
And from now on, Steve swore he will try to have hot sex with Tony as far as possible from Thor because he can't handle the embarrassment UwU (but he failed of course, no matter the distance, Thor can still sense it <3)
Tony turned to see his boyfriend - gaahhh, if that word didn’t just send him - approach the pool. He smelled terrible and Tony wrinkled his nose. “Baby, what’s the matter?”
Disentangling from the linen took longer than expected and worse, it all stunk of human. Human cloth, human wood.
“Lady Virginia Potts,” his mother announces regally, her pale yellow dress fluttering in playful waves as she joins them. She holds a small book and flowers in one hand. “This woman is quite diligent in her pursuit.”
What pleased him today was working on his art, a passion he’d had since a small child, and in the clothes that made him happy.
But lands alive, if Peter Stark wasn’t testing his resolve.
“But the Omega Rights Movement is gaining ground,” Steve said. “In the last three years, we’ve gotten so many new rights.”
The fairy struggled a bit in the linen nest, as if trying to sit up and fly. Steve gently rubbed his back to reassure the fairy. The fairy leaned into Steve’s fingers.
Tony is submerged by Steve and very sensitive to his praise UwU <3
“Absolutely,” Steve assured the boy, who then scrambled over to his friends to presumably alert them of his creative brainwave.
“Would sir like to try fabrics?” the dressmaker’s assistant asked when she came to the door. Tony immediately ducked down so he wouldn’t be seen.
Dizzy from Tony’s presence, Steve nodded in agreement with him, as if he knew Tony’s plan. “Perhaps Mr. Rumlow has not checked his mail?”
Sam said, “Your bankers will need a business plan if you go through with this investment.”
And Tony was getting itchy. He wanted to ask Steve on a date, badly and for several reasons. One, he really did think the man was beautiful and desperately wanted to know what he tasted like. Two, Peter adored him and Tony understood why. And three? Well, it would be really nice to have someone in his life who knew everything who wasn’t also on his payroll.
Steve let his hand wander slightly as he looped their pinkies together. “Absolutely not his teacher.”
Steve took the fairy, tea cozy and drawer up to his dressing room. He reckoned that would be the quietest place in the house. The dressing room was not the most organized room and Steve cleared off a small table and set it near the window. The fairy might recover in the night and wish to return home. He put the drawer on the table and tipped the cozy enough that the fairy could slip under it and leave if he wanted to too. Lastly, he opened the window a crack.
Steve rolls his eyes. He can smell a mix of sugar and spice coming from Bucky’s skin. That bloody idiot.
He settled for saying, “Good night, Tony.”
Tony wordlessly handed the phone to Steve, who saw the text on the screen.
“It looks so pretty,” Angela murmurs in awe. “Where did you learn to sew like this?” The question, though innocent, rises Steve’s hackles.
The human then knelt so that he could see Tony eye-to-eye. “I didn’t know what you would like for breakfast so we guessed.”
“Right,” Bucky replied.
I thank Swisstae once more for their amazing beta-read work ♥️✨I hope you'll enjoy reading it, folks! Have a nice day!
Sam looked out the window. “Might be a reason for that.”
“I do,” Tony says in a hollow voice. “I understand…it’s not something approved nor rightfully explained by anyone in our society.”
“What took you so long?” Steve asks in annoyance.
“Excuse me, would you put it under the light, please? So, we can have a better view!” The other pleads, their eyes sparkling with an eager glint.
“Flew into my chest.”
“Master Anthony," Ana asks softly, her voice muffled. “May I come in? Are you fully awake?”
“Antonio, dearest. You received gifts!”
"Well, as long as he marries a wealthy Alpha so they can keep an eye on his cousin, we shall all be fine," his father snaps harshly, opening his newspapers like a shield he brandishes between himself and any argument his spouse or son would throw at him.
Steve felt a fondness he hadn’t felt before. He looked everywhere else but Tony and turned over a page in his sketchbook.
Tony’s brain short-circuits. Steve is trying to extend an olive branch here. What happened to make him change his attitude? Was it something Pepper or Bucky said to him? Yet, Tony didn’t have the time to think. He has to be attentive, and to react. He knows when he’s in luck, or when he’s on the right track to find the best solution to a problem, so he nods enthusiastically.
“Without us?” Tony exclaims indignantly.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Her aunt told me she’s studying in trades in London and is very good at it. One of the best in her classes.” Tony’s father nods with a gentler tone to convey he feels sorry for his earlier crudity, it’s the best he can do to ease others when he’s being too rough. “She showed more maturity than people of her age, unlike that Alpha who tried to coerce him to be his dancing partner a second time.”
“Then it’s Prince. Queen MJ and Prince Peter,” Steve explained, cutting off the parental secrets hour before it could get going and the two beamed at each other.
That was not true. Steve hated it but he had a simple wool coat and pants and plain waistcoat and linen shirts for times he needed to conduct business and be taken seriously. All he needed to do was look the part of an alpha to be considered an alpha, even if he didn’t scent like one. Doing that always killed Steve a bit inside.
His mother nods firmly. She maintains her fond expression but Tony can see a hard glint in her eyes.
After a few days of rolling and twisting under his covers, Tony decides it’s now a good time to finally get out of his room, start doing something productive. Eating meals diligently brought by Jarvis while staying in bed was enjoyable for sure. He remembers the savoury taste of creamy pastries, soups, eggs, rolls, peas, and roasted beef on silver platters, how they left the frail trace of a spicy smell behind even after ventilating his room. And yes, such an attitude never harmed anyone before but if Tony wastes another hour to stare at the patterns of his bed canopy curtains or the slight cracks on the flowery wall mouldings, he would go mad! He’s convinced to have indexed all the details of his room by now such as despairing over how uninteresting landscape paintings were because of their redundant style and colours, noticing some aged part on the wallpaper in the left corner behind his chest of drawers. He has counted every hole, each dirty spot, and - dear God - the windows need a good washing. They’re so dusty it’s impossible to have a clear view of the sky. Pale blue. Just like Mr Rog-
“Bill’s up for a vote next week in the subcommittee,” Tony replied, in what to anyone else would be a non sequitur but Steve had a feeling he knew where Tony was going.
He had a hard time explaining what Tony was working on to Bucky during their morning ride. “He’s remarkably smart and inventive,” Steve said fondly.
One of the benefits of owning his estate was that Steve had a dedicated heat room complete with nest in a remote section of the house. Steve hadn’t had the occasion to use it yet. But he knew the private room would be much better than the room he had to rent in a flop house in a foreign seaport when he couldn’t stay on ship. One of the worst moments of his life, alternating between attending to his indescribable horniness and holding his gun to the door in case anyone made it through.
“It wasn’t the act itself. It’s because it was you.” Tony says confidently.
Steve whisked the fairy back to the parlor where Nat, Bucky and Sam were sitting. He pulled out a drawer from the side table in the hallway and brought into the room. He put it on a table, looked for something soft for the fairy.
“Mr. Steve?” Peter said as he patiently cut out stars from his crown with the safety scissors.

Tony puts the teacup back on the platter, clinking the delicate porcelain. He stands up and stretches his arms above his head when Ana rushes in the room with a trolley, saluting him with a quick bow. Suddenly, she stops in her tracks, sniffs around and frowns, her nose wrinkling at the stuffy odours emanating from the sheets. Tony gives her an apologetic smile, but it comes off more like a grimace, one of his hands massaging his neck in embarrassment. He did stay too long here. It stirs Ana into motion. She becomes a commanding presence, performing each action with sharp and efficient gestures: removing the tea service, changing the dressing of his pillows then taking care of those covering his thick blankets. She puts them back into proper shape, with some good perfunctory slaps, before folding them in a neat pile at the end of the bed. Once it’s done, she gathers all the smelly sheets on the ground, walks to the windows and opens them in a satisfying clank. Dust swirls through the sunlight rays. Fresh air, at last. Tony takes a deep breath. He moves to fetch some clothes for the day in his wardrobe while Ana is pushing all the dirty items inside a basket she carries under her armpit. She walks to the door and turns around to face him with a knowing smile.
As March stretched into April and April stretched into May, Steve found more and more of his life consumed with texting Tony Stark. Sometimes it was about Peter.
“But -” Steve opened his mouth and Tony grimaced.
He checked his phone - June 6. Five more days until Steve could do something about it.
“Forget about this Tony. Mr Rogers, your attraction,” he had said gravely, sipping his tea then patting his hand in comfort. “Forget about all this; it’s much better this way. Besides, it’s not as if Alphas don’t appeal to you, right? Marry a good one, and you’ll be safe and content for the rest of your life.”
Steve stood tall and straight, in his full dress gown of exceedingly fine blue satin, adorned with gold ribbons and embroidery, complete with long white gloves, pearls and small white flowers laced through his blond hair. Somehow he’d acquired a necklace and earrings set with blue gems.
“That’d cause a concussion,” Bucky joked. “Like flying right into a brick wall.”
Before he had a chance to reply, Steve was greeted with a soaking wet child in his lap.
Matt chuckled.
“Bye, Mr. Steve!” Peter called joyfully from his dad’s arms. “I’ll see you tomorrow!”
Steve smiled and took a deep breath of the flowery, perfumed summer air. He looked so perfect and wonderful, and Tony knew how good, honest, and loyal he was. It made no sense to him that he could have fallen for a human omega, but Tony had not met anyone better and he wasn’t good at denying himself good things.
“Anything I can help with?” Steve offered.
A collective sigh follows that statement. Steve takes this as his cue to go back to his chair. He applies his final touches, checking if all the colourful threads are securely attached. He folds the garment in a neat square looking undisturbed and untouched by any hand who may have profaned its beauty. A few minutes after Steve drinks a full cup of water, he leaves the room, a bag on his shoulder, ready to deliver the product to the Beta shopper living not so far away from the workhouse. The flow of conversations starts again once he closes the door behind him like nothing had troubled it, especially not something smooth and beautiful to dream about.
A few warnings here beforehand:
Great, he was now feeling sorry for himself. He had to pull it together. He had things to do, business to attend to, and needed to be anywhere but here.
“Do you need help to harvest some more?” One of his hands indicates the garden in a jerk. “I could supply you with some bark or…”
Matt said calmly and something in Steve twisted. Peter had a good life at Allensville, and good friends in MJ and Ned. To rip him away from that because Steve was uncomfortable went against everything he felt as an educator.
“I don’t have room.”
“Tony, here’s what you requested,” Steve said. He held up a basket filled with various bits and scraps.
None of that was going to help Tony in the least get out of his current situation. He flexed his wings and wow, did that hurt. One wing bruised, the other wing sprained badly. He sighed. Not going anywhere until the wing recovered.
A dusting of red crossed Steve’s face. “It’s not over yet.”
~~~~~
“From whom, this time?” Tony frowns, flustered but also annoyed at the situation. He takes a piece of bread out of a basket and breaks it in small parts to release his energy onto something.
Tony admired the slight blush that crossed Steve’s face as they both remembered how exactly Tony ended up here. Steve showed some promise since he brought coffee and didn’t question Tony’s name. Humans he’d found over the years had weird ideas about fairies. “Bruised, battered and sprained. I’ll heal.”
“You do if you move the furniture out of the drawing room and parlor -- open up both rooms. That is the reason you took down the wall and installed the pocket doors, right?” Sam said.
