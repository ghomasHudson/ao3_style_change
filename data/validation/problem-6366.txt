“That’s great, honey. That’s really good.” Her voice is soft, encouraging, and there’s the sound of a body sliding off a bed. “Is it okay if I come over to you?”
Romanoff had been the worst. She stalked Fitz all day, seeming to pop up to scare the bejesus out of him the second his attention wandered. He’d been a nervous wreck by lunchtime, barely able to get any work done all day, and drained to the point where he’s wondering why he’s even here at all.
His hands go still on her face. “Forget those two assholes,” he says, roughly. “Worry about yourself right now, huh?”
He’s more than a little shaken as he gets out of the car and walks to the door of the shop, because Hogan’s stories are hair-raising tales of broad daylight kidnapping and bombs exploding and multiple assassination attempts. Part of him wants to rush back to the mansion, check with his own two eyes that Toni’s still there, and then wrap her in cotton and tuck her somewhere safe.
Another wave, twelve this time. The gun in his right hand clicks empty after three shots. The gun in his left spits out six before the slide locks. They become projectiles, one crunching into a masked face, another embedding itself halfway through another’s head. The last enemy standing goes down fighting, ends up halfway through the wall between the hallway and Clint and Natasha’s bedroom.
“She said fuck off,” Clint says pleasantly. His arm curves around her back, and the muscles of his forearm are tight against her shoulder blades. “I speak fluent Undercaffeinated Genius. Let me know if you need anything else translated.”
Tony names one of the chickens Virginia, because Rhodey requested it and because they both know it’ll piss Pepper off. He names another of the hens Ferdinand, at Pepper’s request, another chicken Henrietta after Rhodey’s Aunt, another one Mary, another Kit. He names the last hen Steve Jr. She gets named because a possum comes up to the chicken wire one day and before Tony can tell it to fuck off, Steve Jr. runs up to the chicken wire and peeps madly at it as her sisters run away to the inside part of the coop.
He gets rolled over about the same time that he fires full force into consciousness, and he twists to grip Rhodey’s forearms. “Pepper - Steve - where-”
Tony grins. He hides it, like he’d tried to cover the laugh, but he can’t twist his lips into anything other than a smile. It’s strangely gratifying, but Steve doesn’t let that go to his head. So he can make Tony Stark grin - so what?
And so it begins. Steve eats the popcorn he gets offered, goes on toilet breaks when they happen every 2 hours, and gets lost in the story as it goes on, and on, and
“I’m fine,” he says to Sam, who’s gotten out of his chair to help. Sam drops his hand but doesn’t step away.
“Quoting poetry,” Bruce says, nodding. “With absolutely none of the implications that usually come with that.”
There’s his firewood shed, with all the firewood stacked, and beside it is the chicken coop. Chickens are free-range: Ferdinand (Tony can tell thanks to the splotch on her left wing) scouring the dirt for interesting bugs, Kit (thanks to her distinctive and deformed claw) in mid-step on the porch.
So he finishes the book two days after he gets recommended it, then he lies on his bed and tries to determine what he’s going to say to Tony other than
“Truly a task for the mighty Avengers,” Thor says, but the relief is clear in his shoulders. He starts handing out snacks. He gives Steve three bags of chips and Steve takes them gratefully. His metabolism isn’t thanking him for not gorging himself after a fight.
The static burns out when the door opens and two people spill in, the two of them interlocked in a way Steve and Tony
Steve’s eyes widen, almost imperceptibly. Flames from the fireplace reflect in his eyes, and Tony thinks he should feel something other than comforted, but that’s what he gets.
Steve watches him take another sip of - vodka, he thinks. Straight vodka, not mixed with anything. Tony barley grimaces when he sips, which probably isn’t a great sign.
“It got made into this awful movie with Will Smith,” Tony says. “I’ve never forgiven him for it. Oh, right, about
Steve watches Natasha bat Clint’s hand away from the syrup, telling him he’s already drowned his enough; watches ask Tony about how his latest experiment is going as he cuts his waffle into pieces; watches Thor hum over the waffle iron and Clint choke himself on his brunch.
He puts the thought out of his mind and is settling down for a relaxing day in the lounge with his Ma, who has Sunday off, when there’s a knock at the door.
The way things are going - it doesn’t seem like it’ll have the simple ending that it does. Okay, you’re
Tony glances over again. Steve is still watching the screen, his eyes trained on it with such intense dedication that it implies he’s not actually paying attention.
“Makes it more convincing,” Tony mutters, seemingly to himself. He rubs his hands together distractedly.
“Yeah.” Bucky drops the book into his own lap, losing his page. “Adventures and friendship and grand battles! Good and evil!”
“I’ll be back soon,” Steve tells him, and is getting up when Tony’s fingers graze his arm, a bad try at a grab.
“It’s been handled,” Coulson says. “He’s on vacation. Small aircrafts have such a poor safety record.”
Tony tells them. He doesn’t give them much information, because he doesn’t have a lot even after hacking into a ton of databases. They repeat a lot of questions, which is understandable. Happy keeps looking up at the apartment building with his face all scrunched, going, “Captain
Steve sighs. “I - no, it’s fine. You can tell him. Just - make sure I’m around so I can step on his foot or something.”
“Thanks,” Tony says. “I mean - yeah. It’s turning out better than I expected. I thought I was just, y’know. Escaping. But it’s… I don’t know. I can picture living here for a long time, maybe.”
The work is slow, but Tony throws himself into it, which means it gets done. Doesn’t matter what the work is - as long as Tony dedicates himself to it, it always gets done. Even if the work is hauling fertilizer (which he gets from a shop in town, as well as an explanation of what the fertilizer is good for and exactly how to use it) to his new crops, which is an adventure in itself. Tony can’t help but be excited when he finishes planting, even if all that’s in front of him is a large patch of freshly patted-down dirt.
“I want a silkie,” Pepper says, stroking a careful finger down Ferdinand’s beak. “Or a - Tony, what are these ones again?”
He shakes his hands at his sides after he lets go of the dish. The air is pretty damn warm, but still cooler than the dish.
It’s as good as he can do. He hopes it gives her what it gave him when he read it that first time: the illusion of comfort, to the point where it felt like he could almost reach out and touch it.
“I know. We truly are living in a golden age,” Tony says. He takes a long drag from his glass and Steve watches his throat bob. Tony’s been drinking a
“What use is it being this rich if I can’t even break myself out of hospital,” Tony complains to everyone that has gathered in his room.
“How’re you liking it,” Steve asks, sitting down next to him. He keeps a safe distance, in case this is a bad day, but Bucky just shoves their knees together and doesn’t flinch.
He falters. Runs a hand through his hair, at which point Steve has a flash of memory of Tony running his hand through Steve’s hair.
As they kiss, Steve’s eyes come open slightly. It’s still strange, having someone’s face so close, but he wants to imprint it in his mind, in case this never happens again: his eyelashes, hair in the edge of Steve’s vision, everything distorted like a dream -
“It’s not-” Tony puts a textbook over that half of the page. “You’re supposed to be focusing. Focus.”
“I go away for three months,” Tony says. “And we finally find Cap. I should’ve gotten kidnapped earlier.”
“Would you, uh.” Steve wets his lips. “I know this might be a longshot, but - would you want to - be with me? As in - go out with me. I think we could be good together.”
, but he doesn’t think it’d be appreciated. Instead he tells Steve to go easy and that JARVIS will send him to bed if he’s still around in three hours, then heads to the workshop.
“Not everyone can be Bilbo Baggins,” Steve says, making himself as serious as possible, hoping to get a laugh.
Steve raises his eyebrows. This is news to him. He knew Fury didn’t love Ty, but he didn’t know if Fury knew the depths of Ty’s ‘antics.’
He’s innocently reading an Auden collection when he happens upon “If I Could Tell You” and instead of thinking of Peggy as he used to do when he read this poem, his thoughts go to Tony.
Steve stuck behind and stood there for a long time, not thinking about his old apartment a few blocks over, but still impossibly lost. People milled around him and the city lights blared; it was still early enough in the morning that it was still dark, so all the lights were on. The first time Steve had charged into this new version of the city he’d grown up in, the city that had gone on without him, he’d been blinded by everything even though it had been the middle of the day. It was too much, all of it - the billboards and the crowds and the colours, the music and the din of the passerby, bursting out from all over. And everyone was dressed differently and talked strangely and they all fit in this world in a way that Steve didn’t, in a way he never would -
Tony looks up, then quickly back down. “Sounds good. How about Octavia E. Butler? Her work can be a bit, uh. Disturbing. But in a
Tony looks out over the river. The lack of city noises has been a lot to get used to, but he thinks he might be getting the hang of it.
“Yeah,” Tony says. He can’t figure out what else to say, so he leans in and kisses Steve, who immediately stops the weak ends of laughter and sighs into Tony’s mouth. Tony means to keep the kiss short, a punctuation rather than anything else, but he gets distracted. Steve’s lips are very soft and very cold.
fine, but he’s his brand new version of fine that might involve more sharp edges than his old version, so there’s no reason for Rhodey to coddle him like this.
“Well,” Tony agrees. He pockets his hands in his jeans. His jeans are tight, but not overly so. Steve makes himself stop noticing that once he realizes he’s doing it. Friends don’t notice the tightness of their friends clothes. At least, they don’t linger over it.
Tony kisses him. Steve’s eyes close automatically. Tony tastes of vodka again, or maybe something else, but definitely alcohol. He’s a lot more handsy than he was in the laundry room, touching Steve’s chest and waist and heading downwards -
He drops his suitcase next to the bed - no mould or stray springs sticking out of the mattress, yay - and runs a hand over his face. Was this a mistake? It feels like one. He’d imagined showing up to a farm that was actually, y’know, a
When Sarah comes home, Steve and Tony are on the couch, sitting close enough to each other that their knees are overlapping.
Recognition sparks in Tony’s eyes, and then something duller, harder, that makes Steve think back to when Tony was having to kick him out earlier today.
Everyone points over at an empty seat. Steve has just sat back down in the seat next to it. Tony spares a thought to wondering whether Steve put Tony next to him on purpose, but quickly shoves the thought down as he walks around the table and takes his seat.
Tony tilts the phone towards him again. “Sign here,” he says, and Steve does, right above where Tony signs his own name a few seconds later.
This birthday is more than he ever would’ve hoped for as a kid - he gets a cake, for one. With real butter and milk and the icing all fancy, which he knows isn’t that rare nowadays, but still. It lights up a small part inside him that still expects small gifts wrapped in newspaper.
kind of annoying, just the usual kind of ribbing among friends, the kind that Steve wants to coax out of him.
They’re just finishing up when Sarah says, “Well, meatloaf should be out of the oven in a few minutes. You sure you want to head out, Tony?”
Steve’s heart twists in a way that makes him remember his past heart problems. He knows he’s fine now, but this makes him want a doctor.
. Then you came along. Remember when you used to wake me up at 2am to talk about some obscure fucking-”
Tony is going to die. It feels as certain as the couch under his stiff fingers, as Obie’s hand on his shoulder, squeezing.
Tony does the smallest of double takes, then goes back to examining the house they’re walking up to.
“Not bad panicky,” Tony assures him, and takes his collar gently. Brushes some leftover snow off it, and it melts into his skin.
“No, but - well, we all thought you didn’t like talking about your old life, so we didn’t bring it up much. And it seemed rude to probe into - why you left it behind, so we didn’t ask about it. Sorry, we should’ve told you we knew. I really did think you did.”
“It’s alright,” Tony says, and when Steve gives him a look that clearly shows he doesn’t buy it: “You get used to it.”
“Right, right.” Tony stays leaned in, almost brushing foreheads but not quite. “God, I’m glad I don’t have to be a single chicken dad anymore. You know you’ll have to pay chicken support if we break up, right?”
“He was really nice,” Sarah says pointedly, and Steve says, “Yup,” and avoids her gaze as he retreats towards the hall.
Tony shrugs. “Basically the same. I don’t think about much concrete stuff, just - y’know. Her and Max stay friends their whole lives. Max ends up - I don’t know, he shifts careers a lot. Has a hard time, but Lisel is always there if he needs a spare room.”
The doctor has met Steve many times, which is probably why he only reacts a little at getting called ‘Sir’ by Captain America. He says, “See that you do,” and then the team is left to wait until they’re allowed to see him.
Behind him - or, well, in his ear, since that’s where Steve’s mouth is nearest - Steve yells again. It’s the same as last time, all pure nerves and energy, but this time there’s a laugh in it.
“Look,” he says. “I don’t - I don’t know much about being in a relationship, alright? I’m not a lot of help here.”
“They’re a gift,” Tony says. “You don’t have to pay me back, they’re just - you needed new shoes, so I got you them!”
“In between, though. She lives a whole life after Himmel Street. And Max - he comes back, but we don’t get to see what happens to him at all, other than he comes back. What does he do after that? Do they stay friends?”
Steve snorts. When Tony looks over, Steve busies himself with getting a bowl out of the cupboard and cracking the eggs. Sarah clicks on the stove and then pauses, turning to Tony.
“And they’ll change back!” Ty grins with the smile that can only be brought, and puts a hand on Tony’s tight jaw.
Steve pauses. The cover… it’s pretty old. Faded. It’s not in bad condition, but it’s also obviously a loved book. It doesn’t seem like Tony to get him a secondhand copy.
Easy, Steve realizes. This, too, has become easy - no leftover nerves. His team is no longer new, their dynamics are becoming familiar and comforting. He knows what everyone is like in the mornings, what they have in their coffee. He can mostly predict how they’ll react if he says something, and more often than not he knows what people need when they’re hurting.
Something like suspicion flits over Obie’s face, so fast that Tony wonders if he imagined it. But then it’s gone, replaced by every bit of fatherly affection he never got as a kid. Obie hadn’t paid much attention until Tony got the company.
“I won’t,” Bucky says, rolling his eyes. His cheek twitches, and his face goes serious for a moment. For a second Steve wants to ask if Frodo ends up okay, he burns with it, with wanting to know if he comes out the other side or sacrifices himself for the greater good, or - or -
“So maybe I was on track to go to college early. And maybe I decided to try public school after boarding school before I went to college, to get - socialized properly. To hang out with kids my own age for the first time in my life. And
Steve puts down his fork. On it is a piece of tomato, a chunky bit that Tony had sliced, and not very consistent with the other tomato chunks, which are all considerably smaller.
Tony tries to look casual as Steve’s gaze touches on the abrasion on his forehead where he’d banged his head against the suit during a particularly intense curve; the bruise on his wrist that happened when he’d been blasted by a missile; the cut on his nose from busting it against the mask.
Steve goes to take his hand, then stops. There’s no one around right now, so there isn’t any excuse to do it.
“I don’t know.” Steve thinks about telling her about last night; Tony coming to him drunk, Tony kissing him, Tony’s hands on his waist -
Tony blinks. It’s not what he expected, but he didn’t let himself think of this a lot, and now that he
“No promises,” Steve says dryly. He dodges the elbow Bucky aims at him. “Alright, alright, I won’t. I’m not interested in that kind of stuff.”
He fixes the creak in the rocking chair before he leaves. Steve says he doesn’t have to, but Tony waves him off. He likes walking through Stardew and seeing all the stuff he’s fixed. Makes him feel like he’s a part of something.
,” Tony chants, and Steve groans into the rain and then heads for the limo. Tony’s just finished shuffling down into the next seat when Steve climbs in, shutting the door behind him and grimacing at how much he’s dripping.
Steve probably shouldn’t find it endearing, but he does. He’d be concerned, but this has been pretty par for the course, Tony-wise.
Tony gives him the most withering look he can manage. Steve stays impassive, because it turns out he’s
“What do you think,” Tony says, his voice coming out in a modulated way he still hasn’t gotten used to.
“I could literally buy you a hundred of these shoes, every day, for the rest of our lives, and it wouldn’t make a dent on me. Okay? This isn’t - I just want - just
“Only a little,” Tony says. “I’m a little worried that I’ll name them and he’ll resent me for naming them wrong.”
Tony shifts from foot to foot. “Hey, I was just going down to my workshop. I could use someone to bounce ideas off while I’m down there. Nothing important, just what colours I should use. Could use someone with an artist’s eye.”
Sarah acts normally when Tony comes over, but Steve can tell she has Opinions. He’d been able to tell this earlier, when she’d come home and he’d told her that 1) he’d been suspended, 2) Tony and he ended their fake relationship and 3) Tony was coming over for dinner.
have also decided this, though their feelings on the subject might be a little stronger than Ty’s. He’s heading to some fancy boarding school upstate.”
.” He scrubs some more at his face. “You know, before the serum, I went on a rollercoaster at Coney Island and threw up.”
, Steve thinks, and that’s even more distant. It still tastes like vodka, but Steve notices it less now. There are barely-there noises that he registers as the slick sounds of kissing, sounds that are only there in a few movies. Do they edit it out otherwise, like how voice actors’ breaths are edited out of their voice acting -
Ty recovers and throws a punch that makes it clear he’s all enthusiasm and no experience, catching Steve in the cheek but only just. Steve rolls with it and then decks Ty in the stomach, and Ty doubles over only to headbutt Steve and bring them both crashing down to the ground.
“I’m really glad to get it back,” he says. He stops tracing the letters, lets his hand rest over the words. He tries to remember the sound of her voice, but it’s hard nowadays. He thinks he can find it, but he can’t be sure it’s accurate. His memory is the only thing he’s got to go on - but at least with this he can have her handwriting, right there as proof.
“So if we didn’t draw a - what, a smiley face, on the old pillowcase we’re gonna stuff with straw, the birds will suss us out?
“I know.” Tony makes a disgusted noise, takes another drink - a gulp this time, rather than a sip. “It was dumb.
Natasha purses her lips in a smile. “Mm-hm,” she says, and then turns back to watch Thor take the next pair of waffles out.
, Tony’s gonna fucking die here. The arc reactor is out and he can’t do shit about it. The paralytic has done something unpleasant that might be making his organs shut down, but that could also be Tony’s mind getting away from him, or the shock.
There’s his mailbox, and the window he repaired after a storm broke it during springtime, and there’s the exact shade of wood, and how everything looks in the springtime, there’s the stump and the path leading from the porch - it looks like something taken out of Tony’s memory from not very long ago, something that will come around again soon.
He sits back against the seat and closes his eyes. Pretends he can’t notice Pepper and Happy looking at him, or glancing at each other - he can’t see it but he can sense it, a prickle of unease at the back of his neck. He focuses on the rumble of the car, because the car means he’s back home, he didn’t get to go in any cars when he was kidnapped. He’s home, he’s fine, Happy’s driving him somewhere like he’s done a million times before, Pepper at his side.
“Sure, you can sit in my room, Buck, thanks for asking,” Steve says as he comes to stand next to him.
“Mm.” Steve watches the water spiral down the drain. He wipes his hands on his jeans. “I - yeah. I thought we were good together.”
“Great,” Steve says. He reaches down and pulls out a few strands of grass, starting to make a grass chain, poking them through each other. “No groping.”
Tony leans in and flicks the book cover lightly. “Technically, it’s the sequels to that. Nowadays people consider this more of a prequel to the series.”
Steve doesn’t want to go to his grave without kissing Tony Stark. He’s made the mistake of waiting too long once before and he doesn’t want to do it again.
Pepper laughs at him, not unkindly, and links their arms together. Tony gives her arm a grateful squeeze as they continue down the road.
About a week before Tony is allowed to go home, he and Bruce are in the kitchen waiting for the coffee to boil when Bruce says, “So you’re reading Pablo Neruda now.”
Tony’s hand splays out on the textbook he’s put over the equations. His fingernails tap erratically.
Sam makes a warning noise just as Ty knocks hard enough into Steve to send him sprawling onto the floor.
she hisses at Tony, and then, with a hastily pulled-together smile at Steve “Hi! I’m Miss Potts. You must be Steve.”
Tony makes a mental note to text Pepper about this. She’s probably already handled it, being in charge of his old company and all, but still - he might be able to do something to help.
“Your parents probably wouldn’t appreciate it,” Steve says. He says it lightly, but Tony’s face ticks and falls in a way that makes Steve feel like he should apologize.
But Steve was wrong, almost everyone knew why Steve wasn’t eating like he usually did, nor drinking, much less talking.
“Yeah?” Steve said lowering himself, and making Tony moan, he was now between Tony legs, and he wasn’t going to take long to put Tony’s legs up in his shoulders.
Barnes and Toni  are going to declare war over this. Phil knows that as certain as he knows his own name. And they’ll drag Romanoff and Barton into it, which will bring him into it. And Toni will reach out to Rhodes and Danvers, who have their own friends who’ll be happy to help. There is going to be blood in the streets and heads on pikes and a lot of
“Whatever you need to tell yourself, Tony,” Steve says, and is laughing as he presses his mouth to Tony’s, and then Tony’s done telling himself anything except
Bucky nods. “And Steve,” he says, and gives into the nearly mindless desire to press his hands into his soulmarks. The restlessness vanishes, and now he can feel it more clearly, through the wash of sensations he can’t recognize. “Both of ‘em. They’re... ” Hope unfurls, sudden and sharp, in his chest. His own hope, wary but bright. “I gotta go,” he says abruptly, lifting his head to stare at them. He isn’t exactly sure what they’re seeing in his face, because his expression sure as fuck feels wobbly to him, but Coulson looks faintly pleased, and both Rhodey and Carol are grinning widely at him. “Fuck, I gotta go.”
“Fury didn’t send me,” Coulson says. “I volunteered to come. Yes, there is a message he would like me to give you, but mostly, I thought you could use a friend.”
block punches at the same time. Likewise, the firearms training with Barton wasn’t bad either, except that Fitz is a rubbish shot, and he could see the vein twitching above Barton’s eye with each hole that didn’t appear in Fitz’s paper target.
it,” Frigga said primly, and allowed herself to smile as she kissed her husband’s cheek and let him fold her into an embrace. “As long as they
To his surprise, as he's about to plant himself in a comfy armchair and settle in for the long haul, Stark's secretary — a new one since his last visit, and very, very pretty — smiles at him and says, “You can go right in, Agent Coulson. Toni’s expecting you.”
“I have rights,” he says again, because he can’t think of anything else to say. There’s a knot of something hard and scalding and furious in his chest. It promises violence and death and
Toni levels her best glare on him, knowing even as she does so it will skid right off his perfectly pressed service blues and shiny medals. “I hate you,” she mutters, but slides her hand through his proffered elbow and slips into step with him.
His hand snaps tight around the blue vein, and distantly, he hears Kobik cry out in shock and fear, but Tony's beyond caring, because
“It’s not just about the report, Coulson. She’s impulsive, unrestrained, and arrogant. She threatened to cut ties and break her contracts with us, she assaulted Agent Carter and promised to bring SHIELD to its knees.”
It takes him a long time to realize that he’s alone, finally alone, his ever-present shadow nowhere to be seen. He frowns and looks back at the partly-open door, sees the agent assigned to him today standing against the far wall, staring down at his cell phone. He’s confused anew by it, because he hasn’t been more than five feet from his guards before, but it eventually dawns on him that religious observances must be held to a different standard, shown a different respect.
She slams both hands into her table, leans forward to loom over him. “How do I know you haven’t already been corrupted by the Phoenix, Tony?”
He squints up at the building again, grimacing at the glare of sunrise off the multitudinous panes of glass making up most of the structure’s exterior. He sighs, squares his shoulders, adjusts the button holding his jacket closed over his waist, and reaches back into Lola to collect the sealed file folder sitting on her passenger seat.
“This is undoubtedly the stupidest idea I’ve ever had, J.” She’s not thinking about how he’s not responding. Not thinking about how much internal circuitry is damaged in her helmet. For all she knows, JARVIS might be responding, but her speakers are completely destroyed. Fuck it, she’s been on her own before. She can do it again.
It would be his luck to catch surprise telepathy from the Phoenix infection. He wonders if he should visit Jean Grey’s grave and thank her in all four-letter words for that gift.
“Where are you up to,” Tony asks, which is his usual method after talking about his childhood: immediately sidetrack at whatever cost.
“Yeah,” Tony says, and shuts off the part of his brain that’s listing reasons why Rhodey might not actually give a shit about him and is just using Tony for personal gain. “I know.”
“Yeah, I said you could.” But Tony doesn’t look convinced, so Steve nudges him with his shoulder. “Don’t worry about it. It was a good time. You’re actually not bad to hang out with.”
They head for a lounge, then sit on a couch. It’s a big couch, thank god, so they’re not squished together. Instead they sit a perfectly sensible distance apart and Tony says, “What decade are you up to?”
It’s days after Ma dies when Steve notices the inscription. He’s flicking idly through it when he notices something in the bottom corner of the title page, and when he turns to it his Ma’s handwriting is printed in neat, careful letters:
“Maybe,” Tony says. He’s thinking vaguely of picking the lock when a voice behind them says, “Do you folks need something?”
“Really,” Tony says. He cuts off a slice of sausage and scoops mashed potato onto it. “Fine cuisine. Can’t get this in the city.”
He’s moping about this when Tony goes off in search of more beer, and Bucky and Natasha call him over to the couch they’re sitting on. The couch definitely wasn’t there at the start of the night, but Steve is glad it’s here now.
“Oh good, we have a safeword,” Steve mutters. He looks up. “What word works for both of us, that wouldn’t make us look weird if we’re in public?”
“Hey,” Steve says. “We never, uh. We never did kiss in public. Properly kiss, not just cheek-kisses.”
again, and wonders if he should try to store this away in his memory. People remember their first kisses really well, right? Or they should. Steve catalogues it for later: the warmth of Tony’s hands on his arms, the feel of Tony’s breath on his face, Tony backlit as he leans in, and then -
For one, Steve’s never gotten this many looks before. Whenever he’s with Tony it seems like there’s at least one person watching him, their faces twisted in morbid curiosity or vague disbelief. It’s not very flattering, but Steve is holding out for the free tutoring.
A flash of premonition warns him, and he spins on a heel, graceful and inhumanly fast, and catches Carol's wrist, halting a hand glowing with radiant energy inches above his shoulder. He eyes it, then arches an eyebrow at her, finding that he's not surprised in the slightest. “Carol,” he chides. “Is that really how you want to play this out?”
It isn’t actually a pair of eyes, but to an engineer – no, scratch that, a brilliant freaking genius of a mad scientist – like Toni, it’s just as good. She touches the screen as code streams, slows, resolves into a black square fading into six different angles from the cameras installed in the workshop.
Odin stroked his beard, and Frigga’s hopes brightened a little, for that meant he was at least giving it serious thought, and the battle she had expected to fight on her daughter’s behalf was already all but won. “The idea has merit,” he said slowly, thoughtfully, “but—”
with her thighs that brings her groin against his, at the same time she leans forward to nip his ear. And
“There is one active cluster of comm signals that match the hostile frequency, ma’am, moving northeast out of the city, towards Connecticut.”
“Because Howard is paying you to keep an eye on me,” Toni says lazily, tracking Rhodey’s movements with her ears. She can tell he’s coming to the couch, but she whines in protest when he manhandles her from one of the cushions.
“Fuck your apologies,” he says, and the fear comes out harsh and rough in his throat. “You don’t get to die here. You haven’t found us yet. So get your fucking ass off the floor, and get the fucking reactor back in your chest. I’m waitin’ for you, moron. You won’t find me if you don’t get the fuck up and save yourself!”
He sits back down, folding one leg under him. “I’ve spent a lot of time in the spotlight,” he says, reaching out to take her hand but hesitating long enough to make it clear it’s her choice whether or not their fingers tangle. After a moment of pause, she allows it. His hand closes around hers, tight and warm. “I’m really good at figuring out how to play to public expectations.
Walking away, he thumbs the button for Lola's security system, tilting his head at the resulting clatter-whine from straining servos as her top goes up. She's been doing that more frequently, he thinks as he pockets his keys. Phil makes a mental note to see how many favors he can call in to get the mechanics in the SHIELD garages to put her at the head of the servicing queue.
Captain America may not run from his problems, but Steve Rogers apparently does. Without another word to Bucky, without even acknowledging Toni further, he pushes past the small group of people, who part before him wordlessly. In the twenty seconds it takes him to reach the elevator, he’s wheezing like an old man, despite having not exhausted himself.
It takes him some time to notice it, but a nagging feeling of something being off prods at him almost from the start of their outing. He keeps pace with Toni, jogging along at an easy lope with her ponytail bouncing back and forth in time with her strides, and Steve on her other side, politely matching her step for step.
tightens and squeezes. Spots on his pectorals burn, right and left, hot and tender, and he scrabbles at his gown, hauls it aside, looks down expecting...
she’s laughing out loud and dancing backwards, hands in defensive fists in front of her. Steve’s eying her and rubbing his shoulder briefly where her kick landed. “You’re just full of surprises, aren’t you?” he says, wry but pleased.
He goes to the window and fixes the blinds, even though he knows post-binge Toni can sleep through the Apocalypse once coaxed away from her toys, and a little sunlight isn’t going to bother her in the least. He's pretty sure adding “post-coital” only enhances that. “JARVIS,” he says quietly, “wouldja mind alerting me if she wakes?”
She blinks, then smiles wryly. “I’m perfectly fine, James,” she says. “I’m a hundred percent recovered, I promise. I feel better than I have in a long time, if I’m being honest. You can stop worrying.”
Natasha jabs her hand, snakelike, and fingers pinch around Toni’s chin, holding her firm and steady. Toni’s eyes widen until they hurt, but she can't pull away without pain, and Natasha's grip keeps her mouth closed.
“You just seem a little… happy for someone who just watched his girlfriend get smacked in the face. I would have thought you’d be pretty pissed.”
He can feel the medication spreading, warm and numbing, through his veins, feel the lassitude creeping over him again. His stomach lurches unhappily. His head spins, hazy and pounding. It’s all wrong, it’s all
Toni waves a hand dismissively. “Yeah,” she says, and chortles as her hands fly on the specs, tweaking, streamlining, fiddling things around. “That's what I thought. By the way, completely unrelated… how fast have we made the fabrication process now?”
Her smile splits into a rare grin, and she sees Clint press a hand to his chest and cast a suddenly worried look up at the observation booth. “What’s the fun in that? Go minus fifteen seconds. Shift the scenario… mark.”
But he snaps back into giving Tony his full attention when Tony says, “That’s why I’m here. I’m trying to understand why this happened,
Tony stares at his screen, absently finds his coffee again and downs it while contemplating the question.
“Yeah.” He kisses her again. “And when you get home, you can make up for having missed my birthday.”
“Right away, Captain,” JARVIS replies, and the document is replaced by the SI standard phone interface. “Trying her office and personal cellular device now.”
The still-nameless man continues to examine him. “I thought it would take longer to condition him,” he says. “It’s only been a week. Are you sure he’s compliant?”
“Two suits,” she murmurs, and closes her eyes. “I’m not going.” Clint stops yelling abruptly, and the room goes awkward and uncomfortable with quiet. She opens her eyes, sees them all looking at her. Surprisingly, Clint and Natasha and even Bucky are nodding slowly. Rhodey just looks confused, as does Carol, and Coulson? Well, she can’t tell what he’s thinking on the best of days.
However, the next chapter is almost written, so cross your fingers I finish up early and can post something for you by Sunday night or Monday morning. :)
When he stands, she flinches involuntarily, and he reels back like she slapped him. For a long moment, punctuated by deadly, uncomfortable silence as conversations die away, Toni and Steve just stare at each other, wide eyed and holding their breath.
“Yes, ma’am. Captain Rogers texted ten minutes ago to inform you he was making an additional stop on the way back from the market. He estimates that it should add no more than an additional 45 minutes to his outing.”
The hospital is noisy, crowded and smells like hospitals are wont to do. It’s a sting of antiseptic through the nostrils, an underscore of illness, the lingering chill of death. Toni really doesn’t want to be here, but Toni’s hand is throbbing, and she desperately wants some Vicodin. They only give Vicodin out at hospitals, alas.
Toni’s expression grows more rueful and guilty. “Ah well,” she says sheepishly, rubbing the back of her neck. “There goes my surprise.”
But then Clint stops at the door, smirks over his shoulder at him and says, “Good luck with Rhodey. He’s next on the list, and he’s not gonna listen when you yell at him to shut up and go away.”
“Color me shocked,” she says with a sideways twist of her mouth. “Hydra’s persistent, I’ll give it that, but only middling-to-fair with actual technique. Couldn’t manage to get the supersoldier program right, can’t manage to keep their brainwashed assassins properly brainwashed, can’t even train their rank-and-file to hit the broad side of a barn with a rocket launcher. It’s a wonder more of their shitty little bases in the middle of nowhere don’t just spontaneously explode from the concentration of pathetically average potential within them.”
“Still asleep,” Frigga replied and sighed, leaning gratefully into her husband’s shoulder as he courteously guided their walk. “Heimdall told you?”
. She’s had this instant connection so rarely, she treasures it every time it happens. “Jim, if I don’t want to answer, I’ll tell her.” Carol’s eyebrow goes up. “You’d stop if I asked, right?”
Bucky has absolutely no fucking idea of where he’s going with this. He has a notion that Clint’s trying to be reassuring, but it’s apparently backfiring on him. “Afghanistan,” he says neutrally.
Clint's still got his hand out, so Tony puts the thirty-seven in it, and watches it disappear into Clint's pocket. “Bagalia is a tough town,” he says, putting his wallet away. “Awful as it is to say, sometimes bad shit happens.”
“No, but you still hired me. Personal assistant, personal trainer. I’m not that hung up on my job title. What’s one word of difference?” He shoves her shoulder playfully, nudging her towards the mats again. “Get your ass in gear. You’ve still got thirty minutes to spend hitting the floor.”
“Discounting the anomalous events of your first meetings with them, ma’am, their presence in your life has been beneficial in nature. Without a compelling reason, I’m afraid it goes against my secondary protocols to permit you to run away to Bora Bora with the Iron Maiden armor.”
of deflated lungs, and Toni rolls with him, ending up knelt on his upper chest, a knee on his throat as he turns purple and flops like a fish for air. “How do you like being between my thighs now, jackass?” she snarls. His nose crunches under her fist in a very viscerally satisfying spray of blood, and his eyes shutter closed.
Obadiah pushes back from her desk, straightens his tie, smooths out his jacket. “There will come a day when you might come to regret the decisions you’ve made,” he says, and Toni glances sharply at him. There’s nothing in his tone, no promise of violence in his eyes, no smirk, nothing to indicate he’s issuing a threat. Toni resists the urge to roll her eyes. Just more of his useless posturing. “What will you do when the enemy is invading your home?”
“You may have been intoxicated, ma’am, though I am unable to definitively state one way or the other as I have no records concerning the time before I came online. Shall I prepare a search algorithm to see if there is any pertinent data, possibly involving nudity and public fountains, located on Youtube?”
The unibeam takes him in the gut, picks him up, tosses him like a rag doll. He sails up and back, disappearing from her field of vision. There’s a solid, painful-sounding
It’s raining, the morning of the burial, and it seems fitting somehow. Not that Toni believes in poetic and maudlin bullshit like
Toni turns back to the workbench, rattling components and tools as she digs through them. “Vibranium is notoriously hard to work with,” she says over her shoulder. “The Wakandans are the masters, but they’re pretty secretive with their research. Outside Wakanda, I’m probably the leading expert, if you discount von Doom -- which, by the way, please do. He’s a goddamn lunatic -- and even I don’t know a fraction of what the Wakandans have discovered.”
“You had rope burns on your wrists, Clint had a black eye, and you slept for twelve hours after that. It doesn’t count.” Natasha fiddles with something on the side table and then holds a glass of water with a straw out.
The Tesseract dissolves the Red Skull, and Steve shields his eyes at the explosion of light, ducking and covering by muscle memory, because he’s too stunned by the sight of a tree made of stars opening in the sky overhead to protect himself by anything but instinct. When the light fades and he looks up, it’s in time to see the Tesseract burn a hole through the plane, and then it’s gone , leaving only glowing, melted slag in its wake.
Carter just shrugs. “That may be, Stark,” she says, “but they don’t own the company or design the tech. You do. As far as the relationship between SHIELD and Stark Industries goes, you are effectively Level 8.”
birthday. Felicitations, ma’am. There are thirty-seven emails in your inbox that require your attention. You have a meeting scheduled with the executor of your mother’s estate at 2pm at the law firm of Seger, Ayer and Poole.”

She’s tired and bleary and desperately needs to bathe, because she’s been awake and laboring for just over 43 hours and she desperately needs some painkillers, because everything hurts. But as she sees the light spark over what she knows is her greatest creation, she can’t help but think, with the gooey, fuzzy warmth of all new mothers, that all the pain and sleep deprivation and muscle strains of the last two days are more than worth it.
There are a great many things Phil can say to that. Most of them involve epithets and questions that involve the phrase
“I wanna know why Steve can’t bother asking me if I want to talk instead of creeping the fuck up on me all the time.” She spares him a single, withering glance before returning her attention to her schematics. “Looks like we’re both out of luck.”
This is a little shorter than you're used to getting from me at the moment (even though it's nearly 4k, yikes, I've been spoiling you all ;) ), but it works perfectly as it is, so here it is. Hope it tides you all over until I can get the next, very important scenes worked out.
“I was wondering when you'd get around to that,” Natasha says. “He's fine. He's been sitting there for two days.” She nods at a chair Toni hadn't noticed, pushed a little away from the bed. “With a knife in hand. I’m not sure if he was guarding you, or just couldn’t bear to be unarmed.”
dead. She takes a chance while he’s still lifting the shield, hits the emergency release, and yanks herself out of the suit, screaming as broken, jagged metal tears into her flesh but forcing herself rolling over her shoulder and onto her hands and knees. A second later, the shield slices down through the armor and scrapes the floor beneath it.
Toni looks back to him, watches him steadily over the rim of her coffee cup as she takes a long gulp. “How’s she running?”
That’s lighting a match to the fucking powderkeg. Clint’ll get popcorn and make suggestions on how to get more creative with bloodspray. Tash will critique my technique as I'm hauling the guts out of whatever fool gets in my way, tell me how to maximize pain and suffering. You... You're the goddamn eye of the hurricane, Coulson.
She hits the boot jets a hundred feet up, and her freefall becomes a streaking dive. One, two, three targeting matrices lock onto the vehicles, but her eyes are all for the van in the middle. Fifty feet, thirty feet, fifteen feet…
Clint backs out of the door with his hands up, but he’s still watching them with a speculative gleam. “Just admiring your technique,” he says.
And he leaves Tony in perfect silence to step into the next room and deal with whatever flunky can’t wash his hands without Steve’s direction today.
“It is a little worrisome, ma’am. I have located an active frequency foreign to my usual channels. It appears to be emitting from a communications device on one of the hostiles’ bodies.”
“-not done yet,” Toni’s saying, “but it’s going to be about a thousand times better than what you’re currently having to tote around. Pounds lighter too. I swear by titanium. It’s perfect for almost everything.”
Most days, he respects the do-not-disturb vibe coming off her locked workshop, but today is not one of those days. “Lemme in, J,” he says, after trying the handle and finding it immovable.
“You’re wasting ammo, fuckwits!” Clint yells in savage glee as his quinjet, on Tony's ten o’clock, banks and rolls around something that looks suspiciously like a knockoff RT missile. “You're not going to hit shit at this distance! Who do you assclowns think you are, me?”
It doesn’t feel like much of a victory, but he takes it anyway when Carol’s shoulders slump, her glow fades, and she joins him at the window. “I don’t know if I can trust you,” she says, but all the belligerence, all the fight, has gone out of her voice.
She doesn’t open her eyes, just stays sprawled in the chair as her door opens and the rapid clicking of Pepper’s heels cross the floor. “Pep, I’m breaking up with you,” she calls out. “These last six months together have been absolute misery, and we’re just not working out. I’m going back to Clint, who doesn’t make me sign endless amounts of paperwork.”
“It’s really no problem, Cap.” He awkwardly pats Steve’s knuckles with his own and tries not to lean into him too much. “Just don’t tell the others I did this for you. I’d rather not find out Clint needed money in college, if you follow me.”
“File transfers are complete, ma’am. A second sandbox has been isolated in the Cove, and copies are transferring now. Medical facilities in Malibu are being upgraded, as per your orders. Document generation is nearly complete.” One of those infinitesimal pauses. “You can bring him home, ma’am. All is ready.”
Steve’s silent for a long time, and Tony watches him out of the corner of his eye, heart in his throat, waiting for Steve to angrily deny it all. But all Steve does is lean on the rail with his elbows, hands folded over each other in front of him, chewing on the corner of his lip as he stares off into the distance. Tony doesn’t need any of his telepathy to know what’s going through Steve’s mind either, and the corners of his mouth tilt hesitantly up.
Bucky’s grin slowly fades. “Christ,” he murmurs, swallows, comes to his feet. “Look at you two.” His hands are trembling, flex and relax at his thighs. “Just look at the two of you.”
Toni takes advantage of the lull, stands up, slides the repulsorless gauntlet back on, and lets the faceplate slide back. Whatever he sees in her face makes him blink in surprise. Toni decides she doesn’t want to know. “Coulson needs him alive,” she says, pointing at the unconscious Sitwell. “That’s your job.”
Tony’s flying alone, and it feels bizarre without the armor encasing him. Once again, he’s given a wide berth, but at least now he’s feeling it might be because the raptor anima around him is kind of big and kind of burning. It’s a silly, stupid thought, but he wonders if any other fire-based fliers have ever had people steer clear of their flight paths. He should ask Johnny Storm, next time he sees him.
He wakes sometimes in the middle of the night, unable to remember his dreams but shaking and drenched in cold fear-sweat, with the darkness pressing in around him until he can’t bear to not turn the light on. He fills sketchbook after sketchbook with the faces of the men and women he knew, faces he desperately, almost manically, puts down on the pages with as much detail as he can, terrified he’s going to forget them all.
“Whatever you want,” Toni says, then flicks her nose across his and pulls reluctantly away. “I’m sorry, honey. I gotta go. Meeting Agent Carter this morning, and if I’m late, she’ll snark off at me. And if she does that, well, I’m not going to be responsible for her medical bills or her dental work.” She tosses back the rest of her coffee, sets the cup by the sink, leans in and gives him a fleeting kiss. “Love you.”
“Steve?” Her open, happy expression is less joy and more worry now, and she bites her bottom lip. “Steve, do you know who I am?”
Other languages are referenced in this fic (primarily Russian and Italian). I do not speak them, and rely on Google Translate for all the heavy lifting.
Tony slumps back down to the ground, rubbing his temples in tired, concentric circles as he lets his flames die down again. Unexpectedly, a hand settles on his shoulder, and he jerks his head up, swinging around in startlement to meet the approving, satisfied gaze of Magneto himself. Tony’s not sure if that should humble him, impress him, terrify him, or all three at the same time.
Belatedly, he realizes what he said when her eyes shutter over and her expression goes speculative, and he snaps his mouth shut. Steve Rogers is a topic they have been successfully avoiding talking about since the first day he woke up and was himself again. He knows she has a white star opposite his red, but hasn’t seen it since Siberia because she keeps it hidden with makeup or tech or something. But he knows it’s there, thinks sometimes about if her mark, bright and clear, means Steve’s still alive, somehow, somewhere. And he catches her eyeing his other soulmark, white star nestled inside the red, wistful shimmer in her eye, knows she’s wants to touch it but won’t because it isn’t hers, knows she’s also wondering if there’s a chance.
“See you tonight then,” Phil says, and the call is ended before he registers either of their farewells. Before he can more than process that he has a date, he shoves it all firmly to the back of his mind and locks it down. As much as he’d like to sit and marvel at this new twist of events, try to trace exactly how it happened at all, he really does have to get to that meeting.
Jemma has a cup of coffee waiting for him when he gets out of the shower. She’s already buried in her Starkpad, but looks up with a brilliant smile as he comes into the room. He kisses her cheek and goes to the counter to make a bagel. “What’s on the schedule for today, love?”
Still glaring at Rhodey, Carol reaches out and grasps Toni’s hand. Her shake is firm, warm and solid. “Colonel Carol Danvers,” she says, and her smile is tired but it reaches her eyes. “Retired Air Force. Or so they tell me, anyway.”
Things clatter and clang across the floor as he sweeps the work table beside them clear. He drops her on the table, and hauls her shirt and her sports bra over her head at the same time. The glow of the arc reactor brightens, dances over her skin, throws shadow across her breasts. The mark above her right breast,
,” she says, grinning widely. “You’re her soulmate.” When Helen twitches ever so slightly, she knows she guessed right. And she turns to point up at Pepper with the smuggest, most obnoxious smirk she can dredge up at the moment. Pepper sears her with a look of blistering disdain, then disappears from the window.
The dregs of Bucky’s coffee are sour on his tongue, but he swallows it down anyway. “Ever wonder if the universe should have tied her to you instead of us?” Shit, he really hadn’t meant to ask that. He really should have fucking slept.
“Shut up,” he mutters, then turns to glare at Carol and Rhodey with the same gimlet eye. “It wasn’t a fair fight.”
bristles with heavily armed SHIELD troops who open fire on them the second they're in maximum range. They can't have any hope of getting more than a really lucky shot at this distance, but Tony's disgruntled when it does a fine job of breaking their formation as they dodge incoming projectiles.
He arches an eyebrow, wondering when JARVIS had switched his address from Sgt. Barnes to “sir”, figures Toni had something to do with it. “ Hey, J, wouldja mind calling me Bucky or James or something? I mean, you don't have to be so formal with me.”
“Toni did what Toni does, which is take very good care of her friends without taking care of herself. I know. I remember.”
It’s a new and frightening concept, because he is used to going where he’s told and killing who he’s told. His weapons, his armor, his money, his accommodations, those are all provided for, arranged ahead of time and presented to him as a done deal. He eats what he’s given, exercises by rote. He doesn’t
Fury isn't dumb, and Phil knows that, but he honestly can't tell if that's ever come into consideration. Fury’s face shows nothing. “Explain.”
She gestures at the screen and steps out of the way. Against his better judgement, he looks up at the screen.
In between halting non-starts and embarrassed mumbles, Tony finally manages to cajole Steve into clearly stating, “I accidentally tweeted a picture of my penis.”
“J, do me a favor and run a diagnostic on the filtration system, will you?” she asks, keeping one eye on the HUD’s co-ordinate display and one eye on the actual landscape. She wants to retch but, as she found out on the night of that infamous birthday party last year, throwing up inside the helmet means she’s going to have to fabricate a new helmet, or she’ll be smelling puke for weeks no matter how thoroughly she scrubs it.
“I’m sure,” she says, and slides a palm across his cheek. “Go on, Bucky. I’ve got JARVIS and if Fitz is half the engineer his degrees and patents suggest, he’ll be along before too much longer to give me a hand.”
“You two,” Steve says, and Toni doesn't need to look at him to see the smile spreading across his face from ear to ear. She can hear it just fine in his voice. “Come here?” He holds out a hand to each of them. “After all that, I need to hold you both.”
The stretch of beach is lonely and gorgeous, the sand under the treads of his runners providing just enough resistance to give him a half-decent workout, and the breeze from the sea is equal parts refreshing and counterbalancing to the sun beating down on the top of his head. Even running with other people, it's easy to get swept away in the rhythm of finding his stride, falling into a sort of serenity and peace in his mind that has nothing to do with the brain-wipe machine or the cryo chambers he spent way too much of his life inhabiting.
“Another few feet, ma’am,” JARVIS says, and Bucky’s got enough experience sussing out the AI’s various tones and moods to hear the utter alarm in the smooth cadence. “You’ve reached the workshop. I’ve unlocked the doors, and DUM-E is en route from the flight deck to bring you the old reactor.”
He puts his head in his hands, breath hissing in and out of his clenched teeth. The rage and betrayal and anger aren’t going away, they’re still surging in his gut, nowhere to go but inward. He’s sick and he’s unstable and he was ready to kill someone who’s been nothing but a friend to him over a goddamn misunderstanding. Toni should have left him in fucking Siberia or, better yet, just put him out of his fucking misery instead of bringing him home and thinking he’s worth saving.
“Love you too,” he says, and stays there, staring at the cup until long after he’s heard the sound of her car engine fade into the distance.
Clint and Natasha share a significant look with unreadable expressions, and then Natasha rises from her chair. “I’ll get a quinjet ready for you,” she says, and slips past Bucky. As she passes, she rests her hand briefly on his shoulder, a reassuring gesture so quick it’s gone before he realizes she did it.
"Many of the cameras have been disabled, ma'am," JARVIS says calmly. "I am attempting to reroute power, but I believe our attackers are using scrambling technology, which is beyond my present capabilities to circumvent. I detect at least eight other unknowns in the upper levels, but the route to your workshop appears to be clear for the time being. Might I suggest you hasten that way?"
His body moves against his will, settles in the chair, placidly allows Fennhoff to fasten the cuffs around his wrists and chest. Steve stares at the doctor balefully as diodes are attached around his head, one at a time.
Steve exhales, and his head tilts towards Bucky’s, until it’s resting against his temple. “They tried to make me kill her,” he says, and his voice is shaky, rough,
It starts with a buzz under his skin, like a wire buried in his pectorals. It’s not an unpleasant feeling, but it’s distracting as fuck, which he can’t afford to be right now. Not when the shitstorm he pulled onto his own plate is so close to being over and the Avengers Initiative with its affiliated Stark Security division is just about to let out of the cage. So he pushes it down, pushes it away, tries to focus on the points Coulson is making.
, the way everyone just drops like someone flipped a switch, but he’ll take it as the preferred alternative to being Kobik’s Real Life Dolls. Kobik herself trembles and stares at Tony with liquid eyes and a quivering lower lip, then wails again like a kid with a broken toy and vanishes.
Stark is sprawled on the floor, bleeding and unconscious and easy pickings, but Steve can’t lift his arm. He can’t move his feet. Can’t look away from the display cases and the photos, the posters and the shining motorcycle behind the glass case. White and blue, stars and stripes, pictures of chorus girls and training camps. Pictures of a scrawny little kid in fatigues, jaw tipped defiantly towards the camera, pictures of that kid and a man with brown hair and wicked eyes, pictures of that kid and an elderly man with sad eyes and a kind smile. Pictures of
“I have broken through six layers of SHIELD secure encryption,” JARVIS reports in a clipped tone. “I have located files regarding Captain Rogers, as per your directives; however, their contents contain nothing that is not already part of the public record. I am continuing my search, but SHIELD’s network is vast. I estimate it will take me several days to perform a thorough sweep.”
God, he's so fucking gone on her. If it wasn't pretty much the best thing that'd happened to him since Stevie, he'd be disgusted with how gooey his brain feels just looking at her.
“No” said Steve at the same time. And he moved away from Tony who haven’t let go of his shoulder during the conversation. “I want to go, Tony.  I  want to go.”
They finished the first film together. But Tony felt asleep just as it finished, Steve had seen him fighting through the last minutes to kept himself awake.
Tony followed Pepper, naked and stepping in the glass from the broken vase. It wasn’t the only thing she had broken; Like a hurricane was passing through the stance. It looked directly out of a Carrie Underwood video.
“Me?? Why me??” Clint couldn’t believe what he was reading. He had just send Steve to his little apartment in Brooklyn. He was staying at Cap house to make it look as if the two of them were there. Steve had left through the roof, jumping to another one while he shot a couple of ink arrows from the balcony to distract everyone. Kate was waiting for Steve at the other roof to guide him to the apartment.
It wasn’t fair. He hadn’t been this happy and sad at the same time, ever. Why could Steve make him feel all of that without even trying?
They were the only ones surprised. When they landed Tony was shocked for not seeing Laura or anyone coming to see what was happening. For a moment he thought maybe they were hiding. Or pointing at them with some kind of riffle from the rooftop. But after a couple of minutes he went and knocked in every door and window he could see. No one was at home. Well, maybe it was for the best?  They could be at a family vacation.
Pepper wasn’t there, how did she had the time to break everything and then go in the few seconds of shock that had made Tony stay still? It was crazy.
Steve’s thrusts lost their rhythm, his breath coming out heavy. “Touch yourself for me, baby” Steve said.
Tony went. Steve stood there. It was still raining. A lot. He could hear the storm; he could see it too. It was beautiful, and Steve was greateful for it just because it made him not hear what Tony and Pepper were saying. He was sure Tony had told her he needed a break, they'd had kissed and they both were going back to the party.
He was wearing nothing but grey pants. And Tony haven’t realized till now. The realization was really scary for him, normally that would be the first thing he’d have noticed. It all was really affecting him. He opened the fridge and took some leftover pizza. Just one piece. After that he went to ‘his room’. He took his phone. Sitting in the bed. He wanted to talk to someone. He needed it. But he couldn’t bother Rhodey he had too much in his plate already.
“My family isn’t there. Just” Clint went back inside and closed the window, at least he wasn’t staying with the two of them in the apartment. He sent the direction. Tony replied with an emoji sending a kiss. Clint sent one puking.
“Hey, I have my right to do so, I’m your…” Steve quickly shut up, and Tony suddenly was wide awake, “It’s boyfriend okay with you?”
Steve looked at Tony, and he didn’t say a word “Are you two mad?” he yelled getting up, and almost falling down out of exhaustion. “I’m not doing it! You two… I can’t live that lie.”
It hit Steve like a truck. He didn’t have a word anymore, the same as Pepper couldn’t just say to Tony ‘Our lawyers will talk about this’ and be on her way. The same as Tony couldn’t say ‘Fuck it, we are together, so what?’. And were they together? Or was their relationship just slowly dying, every hour they passed together just another reminded of how it all was going to drive them straight towards a concrete wall without a happy ending?
Steve smiled back. And hugged Tony who looked up, and Steve couldn’t stop himself before kissing him. It was a kiss goodbye.
“Steve, wait!”. That was it. Tony was in the front steeps. It all was going to be a show if Steve went into the cab now. He could already read the news: `Captain America, in love with Virginia Potts? Jealous of Iron Man?´.
Actually, Pepper was blaming him. And Tony. But mostly herself for not seeing it coming. Well, she had, but she played blind. It was written all over Tony’s face every single time he saw Steve. She had talked with Tony about it, and Tony had lied, the only thing she wasn’t sure about was if Tony was lying to her or to himself.
“It makes our sacrifice necessary.” Steve took one of Tony’s hands between his own “Hear me, I’ve been waiting for this moment my whole life without even knowing it-"
“Then, I have to go.” Steve called another cab, he opened the door. “We’ll see each other when you’re back from your honeymoon, good by- “
After half an hour of examining both of them, the doctor sat them at the couch and started telling them about the very common flu they had gotten, and the very high fever they were suffering.
“You needed it last night. But now it’s better if we are apart. It’s not good when we get together.”
“Tony, can I come in?” Tony didn’t answer. “Okay” Steve sighted regretful. He hadn’t turned around yet when Tony said he could come in. Steve sat at the bed, and it made a nasty noise. “I was too hard on you. I didn’t think about what you are going through. I’m sorry. I’m very sorry, Tony.”
And Steve, oh, Steve wanted to draw gasps and pleas from Tony’s lips, he had never wanted to have a dick in his mouth as much as at that moment. He pushed Tony’s t-shirt up and Tony helped him throwing it at the floor as if it was burning him.
Oh, and Pepper. She was looking so beautiful, so carefree, she had loved the complex, the sea and the buffet, she could even forget about the company for a night.
Tony’s grip was getting stronger and stronger, and Steve seemed to like it, smiling at Tony from time to time, he was going to undo him. He couldn’t say his own name had his life depended on it.
“Only thing?” Tony couldn’t resist going soft when Steve was looking so apologetic and directly into his eyes.
“Don’t you fucking dare!” she moved back limping. She caught a vase threatening Tony while shaking her head “Don’t you fucking dare touching me! Why did you had to lie to me?”
Tony looked at the last French toast he had in his plate. “A little late to be saying that, don’t you think, Cap?”
Steve’s hands couldn’t let go of Tony’s face even when he started pounding into him, slowly, as if they could make the day last longer like that.
Steve wanted to watch the next one. But Tony was resting on him, and if he moved he could wake him up. He looked peaceful, and needed to rest. Steve would make the sacrifice and try to sleep too.
He turned around and Tony was already there, getting just as wet as him under the heavy rain, a flash or maybe a lighting made everything shine for a moment.
He had seen the newspaper; he had seen all of them. The things they were calling him, it was almost funny, society hadn’t gotten any more creative with slurs than back at his times.
“Good, I want too” his voice an octave lower. And he reached for a kiss, Steve didn’t move away. But he didn’t respond either. “Okay. Okay” Tony tried to go away “You’re still holding me, Steve. If you aren’t going to fuck me, at least let me go away dramatically, I have a little bit of an ego and I would love it if you would let that live, at least.”
“Oh, but you have” she said putting on her coat. “You know; no bride thinks her wedding kiss is going to be one of her lasts.” Tony lowered his head. “Goodbye, Tony.”
Tony had a good night sleep. The place was the most awesome complex in the world. He could live there forever and ever.
She had left the hotel and hadn’t answered to any of Tony’s calls or messages. But she knew the best for the company was to “make up” with Tony, and be the forgiving saint, give to the press a couple that was stronger than ever and that had overcome the bump in the road.
“When you are…, involved, with Tony Stark, you don’t get to decide what you want to do. Not even Tony can do that. What it’s better for the company it’s what should be done. And now more than ever. We are supporting thousands of families that lost one or more of his members after… We founded an orphanage, and a hundred others solidarity projects. All of them depend on us” Pepper said, seeing as Tony had lost himself at Steve’s eyes, and wasn’t going to end his phrase.
Clint opened the door to the balcony and pointed his bow “Hey, you, assholes! It’s me, you may not remember me but you won’t forget me if you try climbing again, what the fuck do you think you are, snakes?” Clint shot an arrow that landed perfectly in the lens of a camera recording him, it didn’t break it.  It was an “ink arrow” freshly out of the oven, it wasn’t perfect and has thrown ink all over everybody near it, not that he cared.
They laughed and went down the stairs, a cab already waiting for them. The front door opened again. Natasha was already sitting.
“In we go” said Pepper, inspiring as if she had to take air for a whole room and not only herself. She extended her hand. Tony took it. It was sweaty and cold. His too.
Pepper was going to start talking, but Tony murmured something to her ear, and she smiled and signaled to him to start talking.
“You had already. You chose Pepper. I wasn’t mad for it. But I am mad now Tony. ‘I haven’t done anything to you’” he mocked. “Fuck me, Tony.”
They had to take a lot of drugs, about what Tony was a little too excited, but they wouldn’t die, not of flu at least.
So! This changed a little from what I had in mind when I started writing it. And instead of a two parts angst you have now a 3 or 4 parts angst and fluff, with a side of smut (that is a lot more smut of what  I had in mind, it being 0 when I started working in the fic)
“And don’t you see the problem with that train of thinking?” he shouted in a whisper. He didn’t want to fight. But he was getting angry. Why was Steve trying to put a distance between them just now?”
“We’re going to have sex”, said Natasha. And Steve opened his eyes so much they could have rolled out of their sockets on they own if they'd wanted.
They spent the rest of the morning whimpering in the bed. At midday Steve started feeling good, or, at least, better, and he got up only to find out it was just the calm before the storm, before he knew it he was sitting at the sofa, talking to the TV, and it wasn’t even turned on. When someone knocked at the door his first instinct was to take a cushion as a shield and approach the door ready to fight. Just before he opened the door Tony appeared behind him flaunting a lamp as his weapon. Steve jumped scared and Tony started to laugh, he laughed till his throat started to hurt more than ever.
He texted Clint. After a few ‘hi’s Tony dropped the bomb “The two people I love more than everything in this word, and they both hate me”
“Fuck!” Tony said, his toes curling up and almost losing balance, trying to grip at the wall and falling when Steve’s mouth
“No, no” he got up and took the pendant “I want you to put it on me, please” he said. It was silver. A little symbol that joined a ‘S’ and an ‘A’. And Tony was about to start crying.
They had broken their souls with I-love-yous that stung like bees and weight like boats, and yet they were sinking.
“Yes. Who else was going to help your sorry ill ass?” She said. And Tony approached the door, Steve took him by the arm, stopping him.
“Yeah, he’s here too, come in. I’m Kate” Of course Kate knew Tony, he was Iron Man after all, but she was mad at him for doing wrong to Pepper.
“Pick me up at eight,” Pepper replies, and there’s a hint of something, a catch, a tinge of breathiness, in her voice. “I’ll make reservations.”
Toni opens the slim drawer of the workbench where she stores her more delicate tools, pulls the silver half-loops out, slips them on. “Don’t worry, Phil,” she says, and holds her arms out wide as the Mark VII spins in from the fabrication room. “I’ve only given JARVIS the ability to take control of my inactive suits and go completely homicidal in the event of another extreme breach of security. What could possibly go wrong there?”
Most of the time, Phil respects Nick Fury, looks up to him. Seeks to emulate him, and master the vast range of skills Fury has in his arsenal. Today doesn’t seem to be shaping up into one of those days. “Director Fury, as far as she knew, SHIELD agents had broken into her home, damaged and destroyed her property, and abducted her soulmate. What happened to Agent Carter was unfortunate, but understandable under the circumstances.”
This is not a nice world. It's a world filled with opportunistic neofascists and paranoid patriots. It's a world with mind control and experimental superhuman experimentation and torture and pain. It's a world where aliens can pour out of the sky because a petulant demigod has Daddy issues. It's a world where death happens on a startlingly regular basis. Where normal people might get a break, but exceptional people who suit up and go out to fight do not have easy lives.
“If Iron Patriot’s on scene,” Rumlow says, binoculars raised to his eyes, “Warbird won’t be far behind. Those two are rarely far apart.” Sure enough, fifteen minutes later, a second armor settles into Stark Tower, closer to the Iron Man profile, but the wrong colors. This mission is getting complicated, fast.
Her shoulder is pulsing and it feels like there’s a red-hot coal set deep in the bone. Her vision keeps going blurry, threatening to black out, as she scoots along as best she can with only one working arm and a broken hand to boot. “You will not die in between the fucking floors of your own fucking building, Stark,” she says through gritted teeth. “Get your shit together.”
is all it says, and Steve smiles ruefully. No help there. Or maybe it’s exactly the help he needs. “Well,” he says, carefully tearing the sketch of frazzled Toni out of his sketchbook and laying it aside to smooth his hand over a fresh sheet. “I can’t think of anything better to try, so let’s do what the lady says, JARVIS, and call Pepper.”
His spine spasms when her tongue licks hot and wet across their soulmark. Lightning slaps him, hard and fast, and his tenuous self-control disintegrates as their bond slams open. He yanks her off the table, and her pants tear between his hands. She smells so good, so fucking good, just like she should smell, light vanilla shampoo and the faint tang of metal and a hint of motor oil and ozone underneath it, all wrapped up in a cloud of arousal and something he can’t define by any other name but
With that, she bolts, kicking up sand and tearing down the beach like a shot from a gun. Even though he’d expected her to cheat her perky little ass off, he’s still startled by the speed.
He raises his head, squinting at his bed partner. For a moment, he doesn’t recognize her, only sees long black hair and bright blue eyes and pale skin edged with soft blue, and panic spikes.
“Yeah,” Bucky agrees. “They will be.” He looks into the distance again, at the spot the quinjet vanished from sight, and sighs. Part of him still wishes he’d gotten on the plane with them, but this break, this time apart, is something everyone needs right now. And someone’s gotta make sure the roof stays on the building. “We got shit to do,” he says.
Silence reigns, broken only by Bucky’s soft, lost swearing and Toni’s ragged breathing. They’re still huddled together like survivors of a natural disaster, staring at nothing, clinging and clutching and hollow-eyed.
Toni lets her head fall back to the floor, and she lays there for a moment, gasping for breath. Her face is on fire, her side is the seventh circle of hell, her head and the occasional stutter of the arc reactor is slightly worrisome. “How we doin’, J?” she manages to get out. Her voice sounds like she’s been gargling metal shavings.
“That’s it,” Toni says sourly, trying to scrape the taste off her teeth with a bottle of water Helen hands her, “appeal to my love of efficiency. Pepper’s been teaching you her tricks.”
“Not if you have Chocolate Fudge Brownie. Cross my heart.” She skips into the kitchen, digs through the freezer until she finds the tub hidden in the back, behind a bag of frozen peas, of all things, and grabs a spoon out of the drying rack.
A low, rich chuckle announces the arrival of Steve, and Bucky throws him another smirk over his shoulder. “You don’t ever have to say anything, Buck,” he says easily, shaking his head with a grin of his own, and stoops to tighten the laces on his sneakers. “We don’t even need a bond to read your mind.”
after the coma. Also, my word on it.” His face flickers for a moment. “It was good enough for you when I killed Banner. Should be good enough now.”
“Such anger,” the other man murmurs, leans forward until he can look Steve in the eye. “Such hate. You may not remember me, but I remember you. Do you find it ironic that the very enemy you fought so hard against seventy years ago now owns your loyalty?” He shifts closer, just a fraction. “Welcome to Hydra, Captain America. We have such plans for you.”
Toni’s still talking. “I know it might be a stretch for you to trust me, so JARVIS? I want you to give James full access to all of my email accounts, social media accounts, and text messages. If I get a new number, if I have a new email address, a new Twitter account, add them to his access level.”
!” Her voice rises, sharp and snapping, and color floods back into her face. “My arc reactors will solve the energy crisis in
She growls wordlessly. “This is what you can do with your favors, Rhodey.” And flips him the middle finger with both hands. “Get in here so I can kill you properly.”
“Are we friends, Phil?” Her voice is a little hoarse and raw. “I mean, I’d like to think we are, but I’m having a little bit of trouble right now trusting anyone who draws a paycheck signed by Squinty the Spy.”
She blinks furiously at the table as if it will provide answers. Something occurs to her then, a random thought that instantly makes her blood go cold and her eyes go wide with fright. "Oh fucking hell," she says, turning to stare at Clint. "This throws everything off. I can't just drop another company into her lap right now! Pepper's going to literally kill me."
“Make a list,” Coulson says through the earpiece, and Toni makes a face. “The Manor is too compromised for safety right now, Toni. We can't risk either of you being here for any length of time.”
They flare into view, one by one, all around her, lacing the sky with streaks of bright, throbbing, ominous blue, too many to count. Too many to burn. He'll be years finding them all, years fighting a stalemate, because as quickly as he torches them, he knows Kobik will rebuild them. They crisscross the heavens above him, radiating out and looping around each other until white cold gleams with poison blue, until he’s surrounded in the miasma of it.
“Just a technical malfunction,” she says absently as she picks at her bacon and coffee, with the hand still wearing the repulsor rig.
Toni needs to check the armor’s filters, because she is positive she should not be getting this sickening wash of rotten eggs and septic tanks up her nose. The faceplate is down, so it should be a sealed environment. No way for the stench to get inside. She’s halfway to convinced it’s all in her head, because she hates swamps. But this stink, it’s a persistent phantom, crawling up her nostrils and setting up camp in her sinuses, sending scouts to fetch water from her tear ducts and shooing the kids down her throat to jump on her gag reflex.
That can’t be. He crashed into the ice, promised her a date, heard her crying as he blacked out… They’re not married.
That shouldn’t be as comforting or arousing as it is, should it? She touches his cheek, soft and gentle. “I love you too, Bucky.”
“Of course you are, ma’am,” JARVIS replies placidly. “But prior to that, you may wish to be aware of your six o’clock.”
He's sure he deserves none of it, but warmth and affection swell up, carrying humility and awe through Tony's chest, bubbles and pops until he thinks he might burst from it.
“Seriously? I buy your tampons, Toni,” Rhodey says evenly. “Talking about your menstrual cycle isn’t going to scare me off.”
“Toni,” he says harshly, seeing her wide eyes and her throat under his hand. “Natasha Antonia Stark. You’re my soulmate.”
Toni yelps as he suddenly jumps and has a hand on her boot, is climbing her hand after furious hand. She shoves her palm down at him, starts to blast him off, but his hand crunches around her gauntlet,
Fitz is clearly over the moon when Toni tells them she’s taking them to her workshop to science the shit out of things. Get them set up with access on some of her designs, get them started to see what they’re capable of. She’s not foolish enough to let them have access to the suit right away -- Coulson might trust them, and she might have hardcore imprinted on them, but she’s not so dazzled by having actual other baby geniuses around that she’s going to toss them the keys to the kingdom on day one.
It doesn’t amaze her anymore how many people think that plain old Toni Stark, no suit, no tech, no weapons, is an easy target. She's used to people underestimating her, keeps it as a variable in her threat calculations. She's no supersoldier. She isn't a highly trained operative. She isn't even a regular gun-toting government agent. Plain, old, civilian Toni Stark isn't a threat without her suit.
“Probably.” An utterly ridiculous grin is curving its way onto his face, but Bucky can’t really find it in himself to give a damn. He shifts his hands up her back, threads his fingers deep in Toni’s hair and listens to the pleased purr rumble out of her throat. “So. Last day of vacation. Whatcha wanna do, doll?”
When the cliffs south of her home come into view, Toni changes her flight path to parallel them, chewing on her bottom lip and doing her best to quell the urge to snoop on what Steve’s been up to while she was out. JARVIS would have told her if it was anything bad, but not knowing things has never been her strong suit.
God, he’d welcome a distraction from the gnawing worry and anticipation building. “Let’s hear it, J,” he says.
Toni spreads her arms and hands in a casual shrug. “Of course. I’m an unapologetic asshole, not an obnoxious douchebag.”
I believe there's a difference between drama and angst, but I don't hold my definitions as the ones everyone must use. Everyone has their tolerance limits, everyone has their preferences. I adore the hell out of all of you for the feedback you've given, for the fact my hit counter is so high. For how many subs I have. For how many kudos I have. But I want you all to enjoy the stories you're reading, and if what I'm writing isn't that for you, I want you to know that I really do understand, that I wish you all the best and hope you find a fic, an author, a book, that is exactly what you're looking for.
“Yes, yes it is. Anyway. Use any old biometric data you feel like, J. I'm certain I'll never wear it. Pepper’ll bitch at me about cost and waste, though. It's a shame.”
She doesn’t question it, not a second time. She’s heard Clint speak about the sniper’s reliance on a higher authority, someone they can trust to make the right call. She never thought she’d experience it, but right now, Coulson is her voice of God. She may be compromised, but he is not. She’s free to let the rage and hate and righteous fucking fury boil up to the surface, steamroll over her, released from its stifling cage of artificial calm. Because she doesn't have to make decisions right now, she just has to listen to the decisions he makes for her.
“J,” he murmurs, and his heart picks up the pace, hammering a couple of frantic beats in his chest. Because even though he has perfect faith Toni will catch him, Steve still can’t fly.
There have been moments in the last few days when she regretted giving him the same level of access that she has. No, that’s not what she regrets. What she regrets is making it Skynet-protected access, because she now she can’t revoke it when it’s convenient for her to do so.
If a herd of wildebeest suddenly stampeded through the lab, Toni would eat six of them raw, horns and hooves and all. “Is that what that is? I thought it was a black hole in my stomach.”
Voice of God pulls her back. Forces her back into herself. Her gauntlet is wrapped around the top of Sitwell’s skull, so tight the bones shift with the tiniest flex of her fingers. “Right, boss,” she says, and releases him.
Helen grins. “We do get along rather well,” she says, and there’s a note in her voice, something in her face, that tips Toni off.
Toni is practically asleep on her feet after Bucky finds their clothes. Her eyes aren’t even open as she shoves her arms carelessly into her shirt and tugs her jeans back over her hips, leaving them unbuttoned. She staggers towards a couch in the corner, mumbling about bed now, but Bucky’s sat on that thing, been jabbed in the kidneys and the ass by broken springs.
There’s a scroll of information as the program executes. “Running diagnostics now,” JARVIS says, “though my preliminary guess is the fact that you’re currently flying above the world’s largest peat bog in the middle of the local summer.”
“Thirty three floors, thirty-two of them underground, ma’am.” If JARVIS is getting tired of answering every time Toni complains – approximately once every thirty three seconds, she thinks, one for each floor of this stupidly complex and unnecessarily huge base – he has the courtesy to pretend like he’s patient. “Would you like me to overlay a map to your HUD, ma’am?”
you?” he snarls. “Everything’s a fight. Everything’s your way or no way. Someone needs to haul that stick out of your ass before it becomes the pike displaying your goddamn head to the barbarians at the gates, Danvers.”
“Anything,” she says. “What do you want? A plane? Trip to Disneyland? Dinner and sex? Private island? Tell me what you want, and it's done.”
Tony’s eyebrows crawl into his hairline, and he immediately forgets what’s on his workbench and the holo-schedule floating above it, and gives Steve his complete attention. “What do you need, Cap?”
He chokes on his own tongue, and spends an embarrassingly long time coughing and spluttering as he shakily replies:
“Stop overthinking it, Tony,” Steve says with a smile. “I’m betting you didn’t miss a thing. And even if you did? I’m okay with burning together.”
He'd forgotten he was capable of such venom, but he's abruptly reminded when Carol reels back like he socked her in the jaw, eyes impossibly big in pain and grief. This is escalating quickly. Too quickly for sanity or safety. It's nearly too much effort, but he closes his eyes and forces himself to calm down. To
He can’t handle this. He doesn’t know how to handle her. She’s disarraying her entire life for him. She’s opening doors, giving him permission to take whatever, go wherever, do whatever. She’s pissing away relationships that have lasted almost half her life just to make him happy. She shouldn’t be doing this, any of it, because there’s no chance in hell he isn’t going to fuck this up. He’s holding the keys to her entire kingdom, and if there's anything he's learned in the last half hour, it's that it doesn't matter how at home or accepted he feels here, because in the end, he’s a ticking goddamn time bomb.
“Never even a question,” Clint says, and his gaze isn't readable in the slightest. But there's faint challenge in his voice when he adds, “As long as it's what she wants.”
Toni blinks, scrambling for the date in her mind. “It is? Really, already? Didn’t I just have one of those?”
“Always,” Clint says, nodding, puts his hand on the door to close it. Hesitates long enough to add quietly, “We'll talk more about all of this in the morning, you and me.”
And then it's gone, like it never was. And Tony puts it out of his mind, because his comms are working again, and Steve is reporting the five X-Men are Phoenix hosts, and he knows with dread certainty that he's going to be very, very busy for the foreseeable future.
Dammit, he’s not ready yet. Steve sighs and pulls the plug on the sink of soapy water, drying his hands. Not a big deal. This is why he made contingency plans.  “Thanks, JARVIS. Are you able to keep an eye on the kitchen for me? And ask Toni to  come to the courtyard before she comes in through the … hangar? Is that the right word?”
She’s just about ready to start thinking about getting out when JARVIS makes a soft noise, his version of clearing his throat. “Ma’am, sir wishes to inform you that he’s en route to the penthouse.”
“I’ll adjust your medication,” Fennhoff says, and Steve hears him move to the IV stand beside his bed, sloshing of liquids. A little tiny voice from deep inside his mind is screaming and howling and clawing:
He digs his fingers under the edge of the cowl, and lets the fire flare up in his veins, in his soul, lets it bloom brighter than the heart of a star. He barely knows what he’s doing here, isn’t sure he can actually make the Phoenix fire do what he wants it to on this complicated a level, but goddammit, he’s Tony Stark, and “impossible” is a word he only recognizes before he’s had his first cup of coffee.
“I appreciate the honesty,” Pepper says, amused. “And I’m glad we’re on the same page. I’m afraid, Toni, that you’re just too high maintenance for my tastes, and trying to keep you caffeinated has given me premature grey hairs.” Toni opens her eyes as Pepper’s heels click closer. Pepper, damn her, looks like she’s fresh out of bed, alert and so put together Toni’s actually a little jealous. She’s got a garment bag over her shoulder and a toiletries case under her arm. Her free hand pushes Toni’s feet off the corner of her desk. “On your feet. We’re already behind schedule.”
“Steve’n me were the same,” he says, and his hand goes tight on hers. “They showed up early. 13 or so. Not as -- fucking
JARVIS directs Toni back through the hole in the wall and towards the stairs she discovered before the Winter Soldier came out of nowhere to fuck with her day. Said Soldier is now slung unconscious over her shoulder in a fireman’s carry. The elbow joint of the armor is locked into place, keeping him secure. She’s pathetically grateful that she added that feature, because otherwise, she’d be reduced to dragging him along by one foot.
Tony never expected him to do anything less. The others have been in various states of optimism since Steve returned from Cloud Cuckoo Land, but Tony's always a pragmatist. And he knows that Schmidt is a survivor through and through, and with a four year old cosmic entity thinking he's her daddy, well… Schmidt's plans, until they manage to separate Kobik from his influence, will be difficult to predict, let alone counter.
“Soulbond psychosis is a rare condition affecting the mental, emotional and physical health of bonded partners,” JARVIS says. “Most reported instances of the condition occur when one or more partners are in extreme physical danger or emotional distress. It is most commonly suffered by those whose partners serve in active combat zones, or in dangerous occupations.”
“I don’t want to go,” she mumbles, lost and desperate, and her hand comes up to brush across Steve’s where it rests on her chest, and that jolt thrums through Steve with the bright static of lightning, a flash of that deep, shining place he glimpsed within Toni, of endless compassion and endless self-sacrifice.
“I have to go, Cecil. I’ll call you back when I have a definite time for the reno consult. Ciao, baby.” Toni rolls her eyes as Morgan snaps the phone closed with an exaggerated gesture. He grins toothily at her. “Toni, babe. You’re looking good.”
“Like I played chicken with a tank and lost,” she says, and cracks open an eye. Natasha’s face is schooled to neutrality, but the corner of her mouth is tugging up. “Just so you know, I will be writing a scathing Yelp review of your home country, Tash. Terrible hospitality, no care for foreign visitors. Zero stars. Will not recommend to anyone.”
“The serum slows the aging process,” Fennhoff says. “It’s a miracle of medicine. Erskine, for all his treachery, was a brilliant mind.”
She’s been flying for awhile now, nothing but sky above her and sea below her, the best kind of wide-open space to put the suit through its paces. Once the California coastline is at her back, she opens up, full-throttle and spends the next hour doing loops and barrel rolls, tight corkscrews and hairpin turns, bursts of acceleration and sharp, abrupt braking, doing her level best to make the system redline, stall, cough and die.
And Toni is sobbing in his ear, deep, racking, hysterical sobs that shake her entire body. He’s sitting up, clutching her with two arms, protective and tight, shocky and wobbly and incredulous. “Jesus, Mary and Joseph,” he breathes. “Jesus fuckin' Christ. That little shit.”
He hits the far wall, and is a little surprised to find that hurts worse than Carol’s casual punch. “Ow,” he groans, puts a hand to his head and turns to squint back at Carol. “Oh hell,” he groans in a completely different way, because every single one of them are staring back at him with eyes gone bright, unnatural, poisonous blue.
She tosses him the shield, and he catches it reflexively, arm sliding through the straps like he’s done a thousand times in the past. “You think?”
Toni loses her breath, loses all sensation of everything but the burning sparks jumping between their bodies. White light erupts behind her eyes, and the pressure in her head pushes down until her sinuses feel like they’re about to explode.
“I… I don’t know.” He tries to think back, tries to remember if he ever used the words before. Oh. He doesn’t think he has. “Yeah. I think so. Why?”
He lifts his head as Natasha calls out, a little surprised. He’s light on his feet. Most people don’t even know he’s on them until it’s far too late. Natasha’s good though, very good. He lifts away from the wall and pads around the corner, sees her at the counter with a cup of tea in her hand, paper tag still dangling from the mug. She’s eyeing him in contemplation, but doesn’t say anything. “How’d you know I was there?”
“Yeah,” he says, and thinks it's goddamn pathetic that it's another decision he can't make. His hands tighten on the back of the chair. “What would you have done if I’d said no?”
“I apologize for the intrusion, Captain Rogers,” JARVIS says suddenly, and Steve jumps, because the voice comes from everywhere, “but I am registering a spike in your vital signs that indicate the early stages of a panic attack. Would you like me to notify ma’am that you need assistance?”
She blows out a breath, scratches her hands through her hair. “Cos I have to go into the office today,” she says. “And Clint and Tash aren’t here either. I mean, I can push it off again if you’re not comfortable being alone in the house, but sooner or later, I’m going to have to go in and, you know, be a boss. There’s a building that I need to do the final sign-offs on, designs to approve, people to fire, coffee to drink. Lots of coffee, since there’s going to be meetings with the board and SHIELD wants a meeting to discuss their contracts and even though I’m not CEO of Stark Solutions, they won’t deal with Pepper for some weird fucking reason and--
He presses against her back, folds his arms around her, and bends his head to hold her close, engulf her in warmth. “Don’t go, Toni,” he says softly, flats his palm against his star, feels her start in shock. “Stay here with people who love you. You don’t need to join me in the ice. I won’t be there much longer. I promise, it’s all going to be okay.”
He’s winded as he races down the long, long hall. Not because of the physical exertion, but because his lungs seize with every step. He instinctively knows he has the stamina to run for hours without getting tired, but he’s gasping and wheezing like an old man by the time he finds an elevator. He bends over, hands on his knees, head hanging low. He’s trying to catch his breath, but it’s elusive. He can’t find the rhythm, can’t figure out how to pull oxygen into his lungs.
He shrugs and rolls to his stomach, muscles flexing along his back as he gets his elbows under him. “In public, I mean,” he says, as if that should explain everything. It doesn’t.
She blows out a breath. “This is probably the one they’re going to fight me the most on,” she says. “And that is all relevant Avengers-related merchandise or technology that we develop for the team or to fund the team is the property of Stark Industries, through the Avengers Initiative subsidiary, and any Avengers on payroll. SHIELD isn’t going to make a profit off of us killing ourselves to save the world.”
“She runs two very successful Fortune 500 companies, sir,” Phil feels compelled to point out. “I think she understands the concepts of confidentiality and classified material.”
“Protocol registries are being updated. The Mark VII has run through the paint cycle, and will be dry in one minute. Diagnostics are complete, and the most likely point of compromise is a backdoor code last utilized by Director Fury in the Malibu servers.” Toni bristles, remembers when that happened, when he snuck into her home without alerting a goddamn soul. She’d never been able to find how he’d done it. “It triggered a system-wide lockdown and blocked all incoming or outgoing wireless signals. I have integrated more robust security measures, ma’am. An incursion of this type should not happen again. Mark VII has finished drying and is ready for deployment. My registries are updated with the new House Party and Red Queen protocols. May I suggest you put your bracelets on, ma’am?”
of deflated lungs. His head cracks against the concrete, and he slumps to the ground, out cold before he hits the dirt.
Tony eyes him. He’s in a hospital cot, and only because Rhodey begged him to get into it after they got out of the helicopter and onto the base. He’s had 16 hours of uninterrupted sleep since they dragged him out of the desert and he’s fine. He’s really, truly
“Good,” Steve says. He both sounds and looks very distracted. He seems all too happy to be pulled in by his collar and kissed again. His lips are warmer now, and after a minute Tony can’t feel a difference between them - Steve’s have warmed or Tony’s have cooled, the two of them meeting in the middle.
They don’t have much money to spend on luxuries like books, so Steve ends up reading the same ones over and over until he has a birthday, then he reads the new book - or books, if he’s lucky - until he can recite them by heart. He keeps them in the best condition he can, he falls asleep reading them to the point that his Ma teases him about it:
Steve’s hand flexes around his coffee cup. “Remind me to tell you embarrassing things about Bucky later.”
“Oh, that.” Tony waves a hand, sips his scotch. “Yeah, the news blew it out of proportion. You know how tabloids are.”
, it’s after a particularly bad mission. The guy they’d been trying to take down had engineered a way to give himself incendiary powers and was threatening to blow up the apartment buildings of people who had pissed him off. He’d ended up taking his own life, along with the lives of several others surrounding him, with a burst of flame.
“Fine by me,” Sarah says. “I’m making enough for leftovers, though, so let me know if anyone’s plans change.”
Tony chews the inside of his cheek so he doesn’t grin. Man, he loves this guy. “I’ll give them the best names any chicken can hope for,” he says. “Don’t you worry, buddy.”
Tony either doesn’t notice the staring or he doesn’t care. Steve figures he’s probably used to it by now, being
Tony smiles. It’s a very specific smile, his I-am-so-uncomfortable-but-I-would-rather-chew-off-my-own-leg-than-show-it smile, as Rhodey named it in MIT.
It’s a cold night and Tony feels absolutely none of it as they streak out of the workshop and into the sky.
. “I’m good with just growing crops for now. And a few chickens. They’re gonna stay a few unless I get a rooster.”
“Rhodey,” Tony says. “Don’t hold out on me. I won’t shatter into tiny pieces if you tell me something bad.”
“That sounds like the worse excuse in the world,” Sam says, then when Rhodey starts to protest: “No, I one hundred percent believe you, man. I’m just saying, if anyone else said it-”
“Good to hear,” he says eventually. “He went through a lot. Re-acclimating to society's gonna be hard.”
The first room has a room full of cheerleaders smoking weed, the second has two girls who are drunk and crying on each other, but the third room is empty. It’s also a laundry.
Even as he thinks it, there’s a spark of excitement. This isn’t one of his old projects, the ones he swore off months ago, but if he strains, he can map it out like one: he’ll work with his hands, he’s always liked that. Sure, it’ll include more dirt and animal crap than he’s used to, but he’ll adapt. He’ll watch Youtube tutorials. He’ll ask around in town. Surely there are people around willing to take pity on some formerly rich guy who’s got himself in way over his head.
“You got it, Boss,” Happy says, and then he proceeds to linger uncomfortably close to Tony for the whole walk and elevator ride up. Tony has to tell him to step back three times, but he’s not too annoyed - if anything, it’s comforting to have Happy’s usual enthusiasm for his role, and he actually seems to give a shit about Tony’s wellbeing beyond the paycheck. Nowadays, that’s pretty much all Tony can ask for.
Tony refuses to be babied, but he will sit in the workshop and marathon movies, which is how they spend the rest of the day after coming home from hospital.
Steve shifts on the spot. Folds his arms, then unfolds them and puts his hands in his pockets. He glances back at the door.
“Ma,” he says. “It’s not - we just told people we were dating so Tony’s ex would quit bothering him. He’s giving me free tutoring in exchange. It’s not real.”
He takes a gulp of scotch and tilts the glass towards Steve. “Want some? Got a really good vintage somewhere around here-”
“Yeah, yeah,” he says. “Trust me, pal, this is one of the better ways I could be dealing with my demons.”
Thor is delighted, which isn’t a surprise. He gives Tony six new bantam chicks from his beloved chicken Clucky, who he’s raised for seven years.
“THERE IS NOTHING ABOUT EATING A CUSTOMER’S LEFTOVER SANDWICH THAT IS HYGENIC,” Sam yells, and Tony looks around to see if he should be worried, but the only thing coming from the others is amusement. Sam and Bucky don’t seem to be violent-mad, just exasperated-mad, the kind that old married couples get. Tony still doesn’t know if they’re together or not, let alone married, but he’s determined not to ask. It’s been way too long for him to ask and for it to not be weird.
“Tony Stark doesn’t care if anyone thinks he’s nice,” he says, and even coming out of his mouth it sits a little wrong, because now he knows that’s not exactly true.
He sends them photos as he goes through his days: the progression of his crops, his finished greenhouse and silo, his farm which is looking pretty farm-like now. He tells them about his repeated invites to the bi-monthly dinner that a bunch of them have at Steve’s place, and how he hasn’t been able to go once on account of being so busy with the farm. He sends them photos of all the fruit he picks off of local trees, then shows them all the stuff the townspeople make out of them when he goes around handing them out: grape jam, blueberry pies, and a truly impressive amount of peach cobbler.
He rags on Steve about his brunch-obsession the whole way up to the main kitchen, but it’s all good-natured. Steve gives as good as he gets and it’s easy, all of it, none of the awkwardness from the first few months of living at the Tower: they’ve fallen into something good here. No, they’ve
Steve points at Tony. “Tutor.” He points at himself. “Tutee. You’re supposed to tell me how to do this.”
“Sure,” Rhodey says. “Definitely not what any of us are used to. We’re all born and bred in cities, who then moved to other cities. Doesn’t mean we can’t turn into small-town people.”
Tony’s hand tightens on Steve’s again, but this time seems less pointed, as he also presses their shoulders together, like Steve’s some kind of comfort.
The night starts out pretty much the same as it did in freshman year: Steve stands around while people dance, drinks some beer that he couldn’t afford otherwise, gets a vague buzz on that still isn’t enough to make him dance. Mostly he talks to his friends as they flit in and out of the rooms - Bucky and Natasha find him pretty fast, thanks to Snapchat, and Tony, surprisingly, keeps hanging around.
“Hi,” Steve says, equally quiet. He leans forwards, presses their foreheads together. They lie like that, the sounds of rain coming in from the outside, the sounds of their breath in between them. Steve isn’t thinking hard, and it’s mostly the hush of rain that makes the poem come to mind.
Steve squeezes his hand hard. Tony squeezes it back, and then they’re in a squeezing battle to see who gives in first, which Tony relents faster than Steve expects.
Steve pauses, and Tony says, “Orrrr some good ol’ scifi? Have you heard of Isaac Asimov? He’s great. Wrote this book called
“What’s up, Cap,” Tony says, still eyeing Steve like he’s afraid he’s going to - kick him off the team or reveal that he’s been cursed with a dick-tentacle, or something, which is probably not a great testament to how calm Steve is trying to be right now.
Steve keeps looking at it, gaze flickering around like he’s trying to figure out how all the joints work.
“I just-” Steve sets the book down in his lap. “I don’t know. I thought the same thing about Rose in Titanic - I know it wouldn’t fit with the movie, and we did get some information about what her life is like, but we don’t get to go into it. And I think the book doesn’t
Sam breathes out long and hard as he makes his way to a couch and collapses onto it. He sprawls out hard, arms and legs everywhere.
Tony glances around. Things are definitely cleared up now, and there are some new structures where before there had just been stray plants. It’s nowhere near done yet - Tony’s definitely going to keep expanding, plant more crops, build more greenhouses and silos - but it’s a start, and Tony’s strangely proud of it.
Steve’s breath catches in his throat. Tony starts to lean in and Steve wants to badly to let it happen, but they’re at a party and there are a few people around even if they aren’t paying any attention, and there’s music playing muffled through the walls and Steve is a little drunk, Tony’s probably a
Tony shows up to Steve’s house - the oak outside of it is indeed so big that Tony can’t mistake the house for anyone’s but Steve’s, my god that tree should be in Ripley’s Believe It Or Not - with a dish of shepard’s pie, which was the simplest thing he could make after a day of working on the farm and realizing that 1) he had to bring food to a dinner in two hours and 2) he had no idea how to cook. He’d googled an easy recipe that he could make with the ingredients he had available, and now he was bringing it over.
Both of them blink in it for a moment, and then their gazes zero in on Steve’s foot. There’s blood, but not a lot of it - it’s not half as bad as Steve had thought it had been at that first burst of pain.
“Just-” Steve blows out a breath. Tony probably gets it, or has some idea of it, going off of how much therapy the guy does now, and Steve really doesn’t want to explain it out loud. “I’ve been thinking about Frodo.”
Steve tries to come up with a smile that doesn’t feel absolutely ridiculous on his face. He’s saved from this when Ty emerges from around the corner, zeroing in on them like he could see through walls and thus already knew they were there.
“No, not for a while. My family used to have one, but after my Ma passed, I let someone else take care of it. I mostly paint for a living.”
“I’m good, thank you,” Pepper says. She drops her gaze to her coffee, then up at Tony. Tony makes a face that he hopes communicates
Hammer’s house is the same as it was two years back when Steve had risked actually going to one of these: uncomfortably big and gaudy, with statues all around the entrance, the house spilling over with drunk teenagers.
“Yes,” Steve says shortly. “It was nice of him. He’s a good friend to give me a book he liked. Can we talk about something else now? How are your window-plants doing?”
“Yeah,” Steve says. “Uh, we decided to not break up. Or, we decided to properly start dating in the first place.”
They come to a stop at the end of the hall. Tony’s class is to the left, the exit is straight ahead.
Tony goes rigid. Steve is still eating his fish and salad, seemingly unconcerned about the bombshell he’s just dropped.
Steve is quiet for long enough that Tony starts to panic, and is about to say whatever the hell comes to mind when Steve says, “Air force demonstration, huh?”
Ty blows out a long breath and examines his expensive shoes, which are as shiny as Tony’s car. “Other than Tony?”
“It does the job,” Steve says. “My Ma and me used to live a few houses over but it got pulled down after she died. I fixed this house up and moved in. Bucky let me stay with him while I was working on this place.”
He’d walked back to the Tower. Everything felt very distant the whole way home. It still felt far away when Tony put a hand on his shoulder and asked the same question Sam had done, and looked just as disbelieving when Steve had insisted he was fine.
Steve doesn’t know what to say to that, but Sarah doesn’t say anything else, and Steve retreats into his room for the rest of the night.
Fury is eating an apple, and for a while that’s all he does. Steve watches him chew and swallow as he surveys them.
,” he says, and when that gets him twin unimpressed looks: “It’s five minutes. It was my expedition after it got passed down. I should get to see what it turned up. Five minutes,” he repeats when Pepper tries to keep talking.
Tony’s smiling. “It’s fine,” he says, and then reaches up to lock his hands around the back of Steve’s head to pull him back in again. Tony’s hands in his hair is a pleasant tingle and Steve feels rather than hears himself make a noise against Tony’s mouth.
. Once he waits to make sure Tony is well and truly out and won’t go for his IV a third time, he drops Tony’s hand and gets out his phone.
It’s weird. Tony is more polite to Sarah than he’s seen Tony be to anyone, even when he stops being all stiff about it. Steve watches, mistified, as Tony gets flustered from Sarah telling him he seems like a very smart young man. Who is this guy?
He builds up a few H.G. Wells books as well as some pulpier science fiction for when he can’t concentrate too hard. He's given some Raymond Carver when he gets older, and a couple of Auden collections which he doesn’t expect to like as much as he ends up liking them. It’s nice - his Ma doesn’t like science fiction too much, or Carver, but they pass their copies of Auden around when they have the time. It’s something to share.
If Steve is bewildered by the workshop, he doesn’t show it. He takes his time looking around in clear interest, right up until he sees the suit, at which point he stops, hands in his pockets, and stares. The suit is all put together on the pad, posed like it’s ready for flight, only the left gauntlet off, which is lying on the workbench in pieces.
“You’re getting really good at this fake-boyfriend thing,” Tony tells him around week four as they’re roaming the halls. “Very convincing. I’d think you were in love with me.”
It’s fun. It reminds Steve vaguely of art school, except they’re discussing poems instead of paintings.
Steve snorts. “Come on,” he says, and stacks their plates to carry to the kitchen. Tony follows with the utensils.
And he pulls Steve in again. The book drops somewhere on the floor, but neither of them take much notice.
, which Steve gets the wrong way around when he picks up the first one thinking it’s the second one and doesn’t realize for an embarrassingly long time - and then
Steve’s cheeks burn with it. He can already feel stares on him, not the least of which from Bucky and Natasha. Less than ten seconds after the kiss, his phone is vibrating with texts.
“So who’s going to the party on Saturday,” Sam asks after the brief Rhodey-and-Tony shoving match has died down.
got back, give me a minute,” Tony says. Then, “I had a burger for the first time in three months. Good, hearty, American burger. Best one of my life.”
“I guess it’s just the dick, then,” he says. “I always wondered why the fuck he was dating you. You have nothing. You
Steve laughs, but it breaks in the middle. When she approaches, he steps back. “I’m fine, it’s - it’s just a mess. I don’t think I’m gonna like how this all turns out, Ma.”
Students rage around them, a cacophony of yells and cellphone screens set to record, but all Steve notices is Bucky struggling to pull Ty off of Steve and Natasha launching into the fight to bite Ty’s shoulder and Sam yelling something at him that Steve genuinely can’t tell is a call for him to stop or go harder, but he assumes the latter.
“Yeah, I got it,” Tony says. “Yaucht, right.” He flips through the cards. “There’s nothing about Stane here.”
That’s - a little bewildering, honestly, but Tony doesn’t want to insult the guy by laughing in his face, so he nods. “So you don’t farm?”
“I didn’t know you would be-” Coulsons stops, swallows. He takes Steve’s hand like it’s Obama who just offered him a handshake. “It’s an honour. Sir. Captain.”
Steve grits his teeth. He’d banged his elbow on the way down and it’s throbbing with his foot. He doesn’t waste any time lying there, pushing himself up.
“It’s not that I’m not comfortable,” Tony says. “I. Uh. I guess I can talk about it now that I know that you know. Not
Steve glares at them. He’s about to tell them that they’re no help when someone sideswipes his shoulder as they pass.
Tony leans back into the couch. After a second, Steve does too. It’s strange seeing Steve relax, or get close to it - the closest Tony has seen to Steve being anything like
Tony turns, opening his mouth to say something probably more snappy than deserved, but then gets distracted. If Tony put ‘hot farmer guy’ into a porn search engine, this man’s picture would show up. He’s big and muscled, but not in a bulky, intimidating way. Actually, not much about the guy is intimidating. He’s got a kind face and is standing like he knows exactly how big he is and doesn’t want to scare anyone off with his largeness. He’s carrying a blank canvas under one arm, along with a tin container of what Tony assumes are paints.
They hit the kitchen and Tony starts chopping tomatoes. He pauses to do a quick search on how best to chop tomatoes for a salad, gets caught out by Steve and is told to “just chop them whatever way you want, Tony, it doesn’t matter.”
“Of course,” JARVIS says, and Tony waits. He’s made it a smoother ride since last time, but it’s the very same rush: the machinery coming into place and fitting the armor around him, piece by piece until just his face is uncovered, and then the faceplate closes around him and he’s cocooned by it, a shell of metal.
The rest of the walk around the art gallery, Steve feels like every look he gives Tony is a furtive one, a look that’s maybe not allowed, and whenever Tony catches him looking, a thrill zips up his spine.
,” Steve says. “We figured that you’d tell us when you were ready - but I assumed that down the line someone must’ve mentioned that we knew. We didn’t exactly try to hide it.”
Tony boils the jug and turns on the expresso machine. He had contemplated just using instant coffee when he moved here, but he’s not an animal
Tony drops his hand. “Ha. Yeah. Jarvis - human Jarvis, not JARVIS - got me them when I was… what, six? So they’ve got some wear and tear. I’m surprised they’re still holding together after all this time.”
Tony’s eyes track over his face. “Yeah, I’m fine. You’re the one who just had to show my Dad your phone didn’t have any secret recording technology.”
“Sure,” Steve says. He takes off his jacket and puts it over a nearby chair, then sits down near the fire.
Steve nods, mostly to give himself something to do. He’s still nodding, trying to come up with something to say, when Tony picks up another book from his shelf.
There’s silence for a while, apart from the soft clucking of chickens that Tony is way too endeared by.
, but his breath hitches and he knows that if he’ll try his voice will something morifying, so he clenches his jaw tight instead.
A fisherman - or woman, he supposes - Natasha, guides him through the process of killing a fish the most painless way, and how to store them properly, and where to get the best fish other than her store. She doesn’t seem that concerned with Tony getting his own fish rather than buying hers, which strikes Tony as bizarre, but the vibe he’s getting from these people is that they genuinely do want to help him out, not because of any big reason, but just because Stardew Valley is that kind of town.
Just as Steve is about to retreat into the room that Tony assigns him - he’d looked so lost when turned towards the rooms and told to choose one so Tony bites the bullet - there are familiar footsteps incoming.
Tony thinks it’s because of that that Obie doesn’t stick around and pry. Instead he claps Tony’s shoulder and says, “Well! Call me if you need anything.”
He is a live wire of possibilities. He’s a cocktail of impossible nerves. He feels like he’s just discovered the atom. He feels -
“He’s up and talking,” Rhodey says. “I don’t exactly have clearance for this kind of information, but Obie found out and - well, he didn’t tell me, but I was in the right place at the right-”
“Fury’s had me in the office for fighting eight times,” Steve says. “He won’t expel me, no matter how much Ty offers him. Fury’s a good guy.”
He reads a lot of those pocket-books, purely because they’re so widely available and most soldiers have at least one. That’s how he gets into
“I’m back,” Steve says, and Tony almost winces. Half at the repetition of what Tony had said, and half at the sudden, unexpected throb from the knot of scar tissue inside and around the arc reactor. He has a sudden vision of Steve going for a jog, running around the streets that would’ve once been familiar to him and were now a new blur, running like he could escape from this place if he just went fast enough.
Tony stares. That’s shocking enough, and it would be enough to rock him without Rhodey continuing with, “He’s alive.”
He glances around the room: Clint had fallen asleep during the second movie and is curled up in his usual chair. Bruce had gone to bed around about the same time Clint had fallen asleep. Sam is awake, but he had been on his phone more than once during the runtime. Bucky is also asleep, his head on Sam’s shoulder. Steve gets his phone out for that and takes a picture. In it, Sam is flipping him off.
He grins, then grins harder when Steve colours a little and ducks his head. Steve is so unflappable when it comes to most things, but the second Tony turns a hint of charm on him, he starts stammering. It’s as adorable as the chickens.
He claps, and the sound joins the bass for a shattering moment that almost makes Steve jump. He’s still a little dazed.
“Thank you,” Steve manages. It comes out thick and grated, but it doesn’t crack. Good enough. Steve swipes a hand over his eyes.
Steve eyes him. This doesn’t seem like a joke. Tony can be a dick, but he doesn’t go out of his way to be mean unless someone messes with him or his friends first.
Everyone’s very dispassionate about that - Happy, Pepper, Rhodey and Steve are all under the impression that Tony should listen to the doctors and let them run all the tests and actually
He’s halfway down the steps when Obie catches him, and Tony is brutally reminded why he hasn’t told anyone - but Obie
As it turns out, he doesn’t have to worry about what to do with any of it. After waking up from the ice - when he bothers trying to find out what happened to it - all of it’s gone, and has been gone for a long time.
Steve brings him out a glass of lemonade and Tony takes it, drinking deeply. The weather is cooler now, no more July scorchers, but it’s still hot.
He waits around near the fire for fifteen minutes, at which point there’s a knock on the door and Tony opens it to find Steve shaking snow off his boots on the porch.
“What else am I going to do,” he says, “except make sure my friend doesn’t give himself blood poisoning or overwork himself into a coma?”
move in with a weird, rude billionaire who is up to something potentially dangerous that he won’t tell you about?
Steve makes a surprised noise against Tony’s mouth and then melts, just a little. He doesn’t let himself fall too deep into it, but he allows himself to drift in the feel of it: Tony’s mouth moving against his, the barely-there press of tongue, Tony’s hands curling around Steve’s elbows.
“You don’t have to tell me,” Fury says. He takes another bite of apple, chews, swallows. “Anyway. Steve, you’re suspended for three days.”
“I look forward to it,” Jarvis says, and then drives off in the same smooth fashion he’d done the whole way here.
Steve nods gratefully, pocketing his hands. “Thanks, Tony. I really appreciate it. Can I get you anything while you work?”
As Steve waits his turn he finds his thoughts, as they often do nowadays, drifting to Frodo. He’s in dire straights in the part of the book Steve’s up to, but that doesn’t mean he can’t recover, go home, build himself a life from the ground up or settle back into the old one.
Later, he doesn’t remember much of the trip down there. Even as it happens, he drifts in and out of consciousness. What he does remember is reaching up to the table where Pepper’s gift is - proof that Tony Stark has a heart - and not being able to get it, and falling to the floor.
“You can trust them,” Steve says mildly. He looks around Tony to his lunch table, where Rhodey and Pepper are watching with dubious expressions. He gives them a wave.
Also in his head is a quote from The Book Thief. About Rudy, of course; about Rudy wanting a kiss from what Steve supposes had to be the love of his short life -
The lunch table has the usual suspects, which now means Steve’s friends, plus the new additions of Tony, Rhodey and Pepper.
Tony rolls his eyes as Happy launches himself from the driver’s seat and comes around Tony’s side of the car.
Tony drops his hand from his mouth. His finger is now bloody where he’s torn the hangnail, but Steve doesn’t think that accounts for his pained expression.
Tony does, making a beeline straight for the table that’s covered in food and also townsfolk - everyone’s here already, it seems. Natasha, Thor, Clint, Bucky and Sam all wave as Tony puts down the shepard’s pie on the only clear spot left on the table.
Sarah pauses in mid-chew for a second. She swallows. “Huh. That’s - nice of him,” she says slowly, and Steve is gratified to hear that she’s also uncomfortable about it. Rogers’ don’t take charity.
Steve gets out his phone to write it all down: Isaac Isamov, Terry Prachett, but also Tamora Pierce.
“I try,” Steve says. “It was pretty sparse at the start, but everyone talked me into… making it more liveable. Putting things on the walls, building a bookcase instead of keeping my books stacked on the floor, all of that.”
“I shouldn’t have brought it up,” Steve says after a few seconds of silence. “I know you don’t like talking about-”
They both look back at the door when there’s a noise that sounds a lot like the front door opening. Before it can close, there are sounds of an argument: a man and a woman, both trying to keep quiet, but even with the quiet, Steve can pick up that it’s a heated argument.
Tony sighs. He makes it especially long-suffering. He looks down at the cards, then up at Steve. He flashes his most winning smile. “Kiss for luck?”
“I know, I know. Please don’t cry. I don’t mean that, you can cry if you want. Crying is healthy. I’m just terrible around it.”
“I’m fine.” He smiles and it’s nowhere near as distracting, as dazzling, as Tony’s fake smiles. It’s small and modest and so goddamn false that Tony wants to give him lessons.
Steve pulls his foot towards him, then yanks his shoe off, then his sock. At the wall, Tony makes a noise of triumph and a second later the room is bathed in light.
All of that is so easy it’s worrying. And because it’s worrying, Steve does his absolute damndest not to think about it.
“You’d be surprised,” Tony says. He hadn’t realized it, but this had been a weight, pulling him down when he got too comfortable - there had been the expectation that they would go off him once they found out who he was.
“I know!” She heads over to him, gives him the usual forehead kiss and hug. “Someone offered to take over my shift early. Bless those young ones. Tony, want to stay for dinner? We’re having meatloaf.”
“But I won’t,” Tony says, almost gleeful about it. He’s even more jittery than he was when he was going on about Bucky’s arm and whatever new thing he wanted to do to it.
Tony grins, hopping onto his bed, which is rumpled and covered in scribbled-in textbooks. “It’s a system I started a few years back. Only time I brought someone in here, they stole something that turned out to be pretty important info and my Dad got pissed about it. So when I have someone over I’m going to sleep with, I use the other bedroom.”
“Yeah,” Rhodey says. There’s a comfortable silence where Tony listens to the famous Rhodes Eggs being cooked.
Tony points at him. “Keep the skies clear,” he says, and flies off with Steve yelling up at him, something about how Tony’s in no damn condition, either.
“I can handle things about the war,” Steve says. He doesn’t look at Tony, who has seen him puking in a toilet after a movie scene set in the trenches, about a month after moving in. That was once, and Steve can really handle that kind of thing now. He hasn’t had an episode like that before or since.
He feels like an idiot the whole way there, but isn’t really sure why that is, so he does his best to shake it off.
Tony eats his forkful. He does miss it - the lights, the constant noise like the ocean in the distance. The bustle of people, how everything was always happening all at once, how nothing ever slowed down, everything ramped up to a hundred every second of the day and night. But there were limits to enjoying that, and while the quiet here is sometimes oppressive, Tony’s liking it more and more.
They walk for about thirty seconds, down into a living room with a few couches, before Tony says, “So, this thing I’m doing. It might involve Obie.”
Tony gives him another unreadable look, which then unfurls into something that Steve thinks looks a little disbelieving, as they come to a stop in front of the gym.
Steve takes them out of instinct. They’re good shoes, better than anything he can afford. They look like they could last him until the end of college.
His face changes. Tony’s been recognized before, more times than he can remember, but this is the first time it makes Tony’s throat go tight.
has a nice ring to it. Tony listens to Rhodey talk on the TV as Pepper puts the finishing touches on his face, and as Coulson comes over and hands him his alibi.
match, not even the ones around the kitchen table, which also doubles as a laundry table. Steve tries to remember if they have laundry on it right now.
“This is really great,” Tony says. His voice is very low, but his smile is genuine. “Steve - thanks. I, uh. I really love it.”
Steve joins with Rhodey to help Tony up, but Tony bats them both away. He stumbles a little, then straightens. He heads towards the suit.
“He just approached me one day and said he’d give me ten thousand bucks to pretend to date him. I turned it down,” he says when Sarah’s eyebrows hit her hairline. “And it just kinda - kept going.”
Steve shifts so his elbow is pillowing his own cheek and watches Tony wake up - the slow blink, then recognition, a smile growing on his face.
He stops when Steve leans down and kisses him. It’s a fir press and it starts like it’s meant to be quick, but it ends up lingering. Tony spares a quick thought to all the cover-up makeup he’s wearing, but the thought vanishes as soon as it comes.
. Right in the same way the suit felt right. Right like - like some other new things that are fitting into place with surprising ease.
He squeezes Tony’s shoulder this time. Tony endures the hardness of it - Obie was never good at putting on the right amount of pressure - and tries to push back both his skin crawling and the screaming stream of thought that went a lot like,
nothing. Except a nice dick, apparently. Goes to show just how shallow Tony is. The two of you walking around the halls all Romeo and Juliet, as if Tony really
“It wasn’t that hard to find,” Tony says when Steve stays silent. “It, I mean, it wasn’t any trouble. I just put out a few feelers to see what I could find. It was in this little secondhand store and then some old lady brought it for her niece and her niece put it in a box for thirty years and she was very happy to give it to me. I didn’t mention that it was yours, you don’t need to worry-”
Tony turns to look where Steve’s pointing. Just under the laundry machine is a jagged piece of metal, only accessible if you stick your foot a little under the machine, which Steve - yeah, okay, Steve had been doing. There’s a sliver of blood on the end of the metal point.
Steve isn’t expecting much for his birthday. This is what he’s been doing for as long as he can remember - there was never much money for anything, so Steve learned to keep his expectations low.
Only hesitating a little, Tony reaches out the scant distance between them and touches Steve’s knee.
Tony’s still got that brittle smile on. “Then he’s a step up from my last one. Ty, how about you sit down?”
He talks about all of it with Tony. He talks about it with whoever’s also read the book, which is usually at least one other person, but whenever he gets into a new book he looks forward to talking it over with Tony.
Clint struggles his arms back into his sleeves. He’d really disappeared into the hoodie. “Ugh, fine. Nat, you in?”
Steve was, how it was so obvious that Tony wanted to - to hug him, if he was that kind of guy, or tell him everything was going to be alright. How Tony could have said a lot of things and Steve probably would’ve said yes. How it didn’t seem like Steve cared much about where he was or what he was doing, content - or complacent, at least - to be shoved anywhere people put him. How he absolutely would’ve agreed to be thrown at the first random threat that popped up, that maybe he was even looking forward to it just so he had something to punch.
him.” Mr. Stark pinches the bridge of his nose. For a second, the way he stands is so reminiscent of Tony it’s startling, but the he shifts and it’s gone. “Tony, we’ve had this conversation. Your trust is worth as much as dogshit. Now, you can have people over, but if you’re going to keep sensitive information in your room, you can’t let them in. You keep your little boyfriend in your other bedroom, you do the things you do, and then he
. Look, can you at least - pretend to be having a good time with me? It’s kind of a requirement of dating. At first, anyway.”
Tony doesn’t seem convinced, but he lets Steve give him a blanket and thanks him for the glass of water (and mixing bowl, for puking) Steve places next to the couch.
” Tony says. “What do you think is gonna happen? If something does happen, he’ll just punch the problem away. Right, Cap?”
- he careens over the city, swooping in giant arcs that he actually manages to control after the juddery liftoff. There’s a terrifying bit where nearly dies from an ice buildup that shuts the suit down as he’s tens of thousands feet in the sky, but these things happen in test runs. He recovers before he hits the ground, which is the important part.
Tony’s eyebrows shoot up as he makes his way around the table to stand in front of Steve. “You made me something?”
Eight bags of chips, two chocolate bars, and a container of rice and curry that Steve is very grateful for Pepper bringing along, Tony wakes up.
will be kept in a drawer, safe but accessible, so he can get at it anytime and open the cover and run his fingers over the letters his Ma pressed into the paper.
He waits. Obie does, too, but then he gives a yawn and says, “Well! Good to see you taking care of yourself, at least. Off to bed with you.”
Tony starts the repulsors. Steve doesn’t jump back, but it’s close, and he watches as Tony rises into the air.
“Sure - yeah, sure.” Tony nods, with more surprise than Steve would’ve expected. “I’d love some meatloaf.”
“Of course,” Steve says. He closes the door and goes over to the couch, sitting a safe distance away. “Is, uh. Is everything alright at home?”
He clams up after that, because it’s getting uncomfortably close to Peggy territory, but Tony either doesn’t notice or pretends not to.
“That kid’s not going anywhere good,” Fury tells them. “Or, he almost definitely is, but you don’t want to be around him when he gets there. And if I can’t stop him, I want to get him away from my students.”
When Steve finds the couch again - which takes a bit of searching, because, again, it’s a big house - Tony is squeezed in next to Bucky and Natasha, zoning out until he spots Steve.
“I actually have a debate club meeting to get to,” Sam says after twenty seconds of this. “So if you wanna-”
Steve pockets the chocolate bar. Half an hour later, on the prompting of Clint again, he gets it back out.
“Do they know their names,” Pepper asks. She holds Ferdinand up to her face and makes a surprised noise when Ferdinand pecks her gently on the nose.
This instantly makes him think of Tony, who Steve knows for a fact has had awful hangovers, and still gets them frequently. Obviously Tony thinks that drinking is worth the mornings after.
“Do not feel pressured to name them immediately,” Thor says. “You might have to wait for their personalities to show before you can gift them with a name.”
“Fuck off,” Sam whispers back, but he doesn’t shove Bucky off like he’d done the first time this had happened.
Coulson, as always, is unimpressed. “This isn’t my first rodeo, Mr. Stark. Just stick to the official statement and soon this will all be behind you.”
When Steve settles back into his seat, which is more comfortable than any carseat he’s ever been in, Tony is looking between the two of them like - Steve doesn’t know.
Steve does bring up Obie, but only once. A movie has ended and neither of them have told JARVIS to put anything else on, so they’re just watching the credits roll. Tony’s mind is elsewhere and he suspects Steve’s is the same.
Tony pauses. His knife scrapes loudly on his next cut, and he winces. “Um. He didn’t do - I mean. He’s my friend, I wanted to help him out.”
Tony pulls and Steve is all too happy to follow. They all but speedwalk around the corner, at which point Steve says, “Huh. What a jackass.”
“Hello,” Jarvis replies, looking much happier to see a teenager dripping onto the upholstery than Steve would expect. “To your home, Sir, or are you coming over to Master Tony’s?”
As it turns out, Tony does have recommendations. He barrels into the kitchen the next day with a slab of a book that’s been divested of its cover and says, “You might like or hate this one and I can’t tell which.”
"The brain is still a very mysterious place," Fennhoff says, and fiddles a little more with the hanging IV bags. "I believe your mind, in trying to heal itself from the serious injuries you suffered, created a very vivid, realistic fusion of your knowledge of the previous Captain America, and your own life." Fennhoff puts a hand on his shoulder, pats it gently. He has to fist his hands in his lap to keep from slapping the doctor's hand away from his body.
Something sings past Toni’s ear, passing so close to her head it snicks through a lock of her hair. Red Star’s hand sprouts an arrow, and he recoils away from her.
She leans up on her tiptoes and kisses him sweetly, trying to salve the faint hurt and deep confusion she can see in the furrow of his forehead. “Seriously, honey, I’m not going to be able to sleep tonight, so I may as well capitalize on the time to take care of a few things.”
Carol’s quiet for a long time, longer than Tony thought she would be, staring at the thumb drive as she flips it over and over in her fingers. “
Suddenly, he’s tired of it. Tired of sleeping in the cold, tired of being haunted by images and faces and voices, flashes of whatever life he’d had before all this. Tired of orders and tired of killing and tired of the deadened, numb cavity where his heart should be.
“I know,” he says, and sighs. The eerie calm drains from his voice, and now he’s just plaintive and tired. “Things would be so much easier if I was a goddamn villain, you know. I fucking hate having morals and basic respect for others right now. When are you coming home?”
He still remembers nothing, except the dream-world his mind apparently created while he was unconscious and healing. The world so real, it feels like it actually happened to him. The words he reads on paper, the photographs he sees of his life with Peggy, his service records of tours overseas in Afghanistan and Iraq, they never seem right, never seem real. Like he’s looking at a comic book or watching a film. Something that happened to someone else.
Toni opens her eyes, and Bucky smiles down at her as he gently sets her on her feet. She clings to him for a moment for support as she gets her feet under her, then blearily looks around. It’s probably a sign, he thinks, of just how deep in sleep debt she is when it takes her a good ten seconds to realize where they are.
“No,” she counters, stooping to grab a towel from the bench beside the mat. “What got my attention was
Comes back to find a gun in each bloody hand, something pink and puffy and speckled with shards of bone clinging to the fingers of his metal hand. Hair swings into his face, slick and dripping with blood.
He’s washing the dishes by hand when JARVIS chimes softly. “Captain, you should be informed that ma’am has decided to return to the mansion.”
Bucky closes the bedroom door gently behind him, and as he pads back down the hall towards the kitchen -- he never did get that sandwich and now he's fucking
Toni cuts him off before he can work up the usual castigating speech. “Well, he’s not,” she says. “And he left everything to me. I know it’s a little hard for you to accept, but the name on the door is
Steve would rather not have come to Toni’s impromptu surprise party, because it seems a little disingenuous for the person who hurt her help celebrate her return from serious injury. But Bucky is a terrible nag, and he recruited Carol and Agent Coulson to help him make sure Steve made it into the den instead of slipping off to … not hide, exactly, because Captain America never hides. He might have preferred a
She glances at the clock, and grinds her teeth when she realizes it's almost four o’clock. Long past the time she wanted to be wrapping up and heading home. Carter's got a whole fucking pile of folders, though, and seems prepared to keep going until midnight.
Except… that’s not entirely right. Her Masters of Metaphysics more focused on physical data, measurable brain waves and observable phenomena, efforts to define the soulbond in quantifiable ways, because she’s a scientist at heart, not a philosopher. Extrapolations of quantum mechanics and multiverse theory. Hard numbers to point at, theories grounded in proven science. But her coursework, absorbed in a single semester, her masters thesis written in a frenzied week of too little sleep and too much coffee, often verged into the unquantifiable, the nigh-supernatural. Emotional syncing. Psychic links. Transfer of abilities and skills. Psychological effects that were as hard to prove as the existence of God. The rare twists, the unique cases she ultimately disregarded as outliers that only skewed data analysis.
“I’m sure I wouldn’t know what you’re talking about, ma’am,” comes JARVIS’s mild-toned reply. “Approaching the designated co-ordinates, estimated arrival at Zima Station in approximately two minutes.”
A single heartbeat pounds in three chests, a single deep gasp of air fills three pairs of lungs as they surface out of the place where a single image shines with all their colors, supported by stone and swirled by blazing heat and howling cold.
He pockets his phone, takes a moment to compose and recenter himself, then resolutely begins heading down the stairs again.
“It does, doesn’t it?” Jemma chews on her lip. “What if we have delicate experiments underway, JARVIS? Or if we have something time-sensitive that cannot be interrupted?”
“Or someone’s trying to kill you,” Clint finishes, then plops carelessly back on his ass, hauling her down to sit beside him with his arm around her shoulder. “This happens every goddamn time, Toni. Vacations, business trips, parties, doesn’t seem to matter. No one has this much shit luck.”
It takes Steve a few moments to process that, but when he does, the implications slam into him like a jolt of pure adrenaline. He jolts off the desk, starting and blinking in genuine surprise. “What?”
She blinks, watches Natasha watching her with concerned eyes. “My workshop,” she says, clears her throat because her voice is scratchy. Continues, soft and unprompted, “Stark Tower, New York City. It’s April 25th, 2012. I'm Toni Stark. You're Tash and Clint and Bucky.”
She flips the cover shut and props her chin on her hand, picking up her scotch with the other hand, and stares out the porthole as the plane begins its final approach. One more meeting, one more presentation, one more schmoozefest with military brass, and she gets to go home and shut down the last weapons factory, sell the surplus components to the government for their next warmongering contractor, and get back to her
"You two alright?” she asks over her shoulder, and crouches to strip the agent’s weapons. Combat knife, sidearm, spare clip, taser. Brass knuckles, really? Scoops them all up, and turns around.
The majority of this chapter is completely NSFW. It's like, 80% smut and 20% talking. Just uh, *cough* beware, because thar be explicit sex — a fucking lot of it — ahead in this chapter.
Bucky pauses, can’t help it, starts to laugh. Laugh until tears are streaming down his face. Laugh until his head is screaming with pain. That ball of fury is so hot now, he feels like it might burn right through his skin.
He blows out a breath, and stares down at the plate, wishing it didn’t seem to be mocking him. “Man up, Barnes,” he mutters to himself. “It’s fuckin’ breakfast. You can handle breakfast.” And deliberately, he pulls the chair out, sits down, and starts to eat.
She can’t wait to see the look on his face when she tells him she doesn’t plan on having any kids anytime soon, if she has them at all.
