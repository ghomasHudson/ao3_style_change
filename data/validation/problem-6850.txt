It was filled with all the memories he couldn’t afford to forget. There were so many videos. Thousands of pictures that made him smile and his heart ache something fierce in equal measure. There were messages that he had been going back and rereading for the last two years; words that hadn’t seemed to matter much at the time, but now meant everything to him. Little notes that made little sense but contained the secrets to the universe by equal measure. He couldn’t bear to let all of that go.
, he doesn’t think he’s ever going to forget. Sam is pulling Bucky into the apartment, neither one of them bothering to take off their layers or even their shoes, as they trudge in and make a straight line for the living room. Steve’s worry spikes as soon as they make their noisy entrance; Bucky is on the phone, but not speaking, and Sam’s face is set into a worried frown.
So Tony woke up. Tony got his chest patched up. Tony got a cast on his arm and a brace on his ankle and wrist and a hell of a lot bandages and butterfly band-aids. Tony got the card to a therapist that he let fly out his window on his way to the airport. Tony got a new job with the Security Council, and another one with the Accords board, and yet another as a consultant for the defense team for the Rogue Avengers, and he was still building, and creating and designing.
“He gave me a choice,” Tony said quietly. Harley snaps his mouth shut. “He’s always given me a choice, Harley. He’s never forced me to do anything. It’s not really his fault I’ve chosen so poorly in the past.” Harley’s mouth opens, no doubt about to go on another tirade, but FRIDAY interrupts him.
When you're offered a second chance do you choose the same path? Or have your mistakes taught you well?
He’s so lost in his own mind for a while there that he completely misses what Rogers does. It isn’t until there are steady fingers taking hold on his trembling hands that Tony realizes what’s happening. When he’s able to look past the hazy fog of his panic he feels his jaw drop. He’d missed his chance to scramble backwards or even call for FRIDAY as the Captain got closer, Tony braces himself for an impact that never comes. Instead, there’s the sound of a hard surface smacking denim-clad bone but of the familiar feel of knuckles to his face. Instead, when Tony finally
a voice thunders and Tony’s head snaps to the side and sees Rhodey making his way, shakily and with difficulty, towards them. And Tony is exhausted, so fucking done with how unbalanced he feels, so the step that was meant for Steve goes in Rhodey’s direction instead.
did. Now, the baby had just woken up from his nap and Steve was waiting for him to become a little less groggy to take him into the kitchen for his lunch.
though the engineer had no idea why he thought it necessary. At least, Tony had reached peace with one of them.
Before he can focus on anything else, though, he sees the figure standing in front of the tomb. Tony has his eyes shielded by sunglasses, and he’s wearing his now-customary three piece suit. It’s a light blue, though, with a white shirt and a darker pocket handkerchief. It’s a definite contrast to the somber colors Steve has hated to see on him lately. His arms are wrapped tightly around his middle, and his head is vowed. Steve cautiously approaches him, and he realizes two things that send his pulse thumping.
“Of course she knew,” Rhodey snorts at him. “After Ultron, you honestly thought Tony went back, built Pepper a farm and then lived happily ever after? Come on, Captain, I thought you’d know your team better than that. Did you ever stop to think about how much attention the Maria Stark Foundation was getting after that screw up? How much they were doing? Not to mention the Fellowships and the MIT events? Relief and Recovery after Sokovia took time and effort. They didn’t want any of us, let alone the man everyone blamed for that destruction, to be involved in the clean-up. Someone with a bit of diplomatic experience to help.”
“Like hell,” Hogan all but snarls and makes to take a step towards Steve. Rhodes holds fast, his eyes never dropping from Steve, and murmurs for the driver to stay.
When he reached his room, Bucky silently shouldered his bag and closed the door firmly behind him. Steve stared at the dark wooden barrier between himself and his best friend and closed his eyes. He took a moment to center himself before continuing to his. His hand, he noticed, was shaking when he reached out to grab the knob. It was the only one that had a knob, and a key hanging from it, and he had to swallow the sudden lump in his throat.
“Very good, baby boy!” Tony said and offered him a fist bump. He’d spent his whole last visit teaching the kid how to do it, and was insanely proud when Baby Bart had decided that was the only acceptable greeting he could give to anyone he met. The first time he’d seen Vision after that had the android giving Tony a droll stare, though there was a smile on his lips.
“Vision,” he says, voice quiet with authority. The android grimaces as he sits up, but tries his best to look at him. “I need you to answer me truthfully. Is there any way for you to communicate with T—with New York?” he catches himself at the last minute and resolutely pushes the fear and heartache that flares up.
“I just—“Steve swallows and drops his eyes from his boy—well, ex-boyfriend’s face. He shrugs, stalling for time, while the voice in the back of his head that sounds suspiciously like Bucky tells him that he still has time. Being the stubborn ass that he is, Steve forces the words out his mouth. “I don’t think this is working anymore, Tony.”
Not the man that he had just met; the soldier with the hard eyes and the harder punches. Not the enemy who had kept him on his back like a turtled as he tried desperately to turn. Not the stranger who had looked him in the eyes as he beat him into the snow. No. As Tony lay in the ice, the slowness of his brain sending alarm bells through the rest of his body, the only think he could think of was
But there is also pain, and he pushes that solidly to the back of his mind. He can’t afford to destroy Peter’s enthusiasm. It’s the first time since—since, that Tony sees him this happy. His smile hasn’t been this wide since before. For the first time, Tony can say without the shadow of a doubt that his soon is happy, and he doesn’t want to mess this up with his issues. So he takes that pain, and that bitterness, and firmly locks them in a cupboard. He forces himself not to think about the hug, gaping hole of where a third person should be celebrating.
“Oh,” he’d breathed out, taking a step back. His heart filled with sadness and longing so intense for a second that he’d had to blink up at the ceiling for a second. Then, he looked down at Peggy, her soft smile and bright eyes, and couldn’t find it in himself to be upset at her happiness. “Hey, tell me about him?”
, give her own stories about Steve Rogers. The unembellished, embarrassing, hilariously human side of the one and only super soldier. The stories Tony used to love as a kid. And she’d fade, and fade, and fade, and Tony would get further and further away from her on his quest to keep the earth safe until Fury called him at three am while he frantically worked on the Accords to tell him the unfortunate news. And although he’d quit months ago for Pepper, and the Avengers, and his quest to
After the serum, it had just become a habit to be awake so early. The thing in his veins meant that he didn’t need that much sleep. There was always a constant thrum of energy running through him. The need to
“Dad, please,” Peter says just as FRIDAY alerts him that his son is now dangling off the fucking ship and that is simply a gamble he won’t take.
, but the blatant hostility the man had greeted the entire group with. It had felt, again, like another nail added to their coffin. “We’ve got food and board covered.”
“You’re right,” Steve managed to croak out and he tried to clear his throat of the lump that had formed there. He didn’t want to start crying in the entryway of the compound where any of the others could see him. He didn’t want to make this day about himself when both Clint and Tony were going through their own emotional ordeal.
“Actually, Mr. Stark,” Lang’s voice stops him just as he’s about to leave the room. He turns around in surprise, and Lang gives him a smile. Cassie’s face is puffy and red from crying, but she’s smiling like Christmas and her birthday have come at the same time. “If… if it’s all right, could Cassie go with you? I think… well, I think there’s some things I need to know and maybe Mrs. Barton can enlighten me about them.”
“And I gave you my word that you would be protected. I do not take my promises lightly, Sam,” T’Challa’s tone brooks no argument. Sam gives a slight nod, though he still stares at Tony suspiciously.
There was a band playing the theme song from Hey Arnold and free food today! Also, my fiction writing professor looks like Kurt Vonnegut (!!!!!!!!!) and he was like "Have you all read 1984 recently? WE thought that was bad, huh? This shit is scary."
“I have something to ask you,” it almost came out like a growl. Steve screamed at himself internally, wondering when he had turned into the type of man to become so confrontational, and looked away at Tony’s wince. The mechanic, never to take a challenge sitting down, glared up at the soldier.
Barton does the opposite. He throws his head back, and gives out a harsh laugh. “That’s fucking priceless. You put a collar around our throats, and won’t do the same for
“They’re for better support to my delicate arches,” Tony sniffs indignantly. Steve can’t help his snort of laughter, and Tony immediately turns to him. He’d forgotten he was there, the soldier is sure, otherwise he would never have allowed himself to be that vulnerable and genuine. The blond’s good humor threatens to deflate, but he soldiers on regardless. He’d take small miracles where he can get them. “You shut up,” he says with the same motherly finger wag. Steve bites his lip to hide his smile. “We can’t all be heights of human perfection.”
“Please,” Tony says and he must sound as pathetic as he thinks because Rhodey just sighs and nods. He tells him he’ll be nearby in case he’s needed, and then ruffles his hair. Tony bites out a soft
“He’s got the boys for that. They’ll take care of him,” and though Sam hadn’t said it in as many words, the message was implied.
“Stopping is hard,” Tony says with a half-smile, his eyes far away. “I tried way too many times to do just that, but—honestly, it wasn’t until our fight when I started realizing how much I needed to. What I saw in that vision,” one of Steve’s hands pets the back of his head when he mentions that and Tony smiles, “messed me up for a long time. It’s what made Pepper leave. I just
“Hey,” Steve replied quietly. His eyes flickered briefly to Rhodes, who was pretending to be engrossed on a tablet but Steve could tell was actually watching them, before going back to Tony. “I didn’t expect you to be up until later.”
“Those,” Coop points to a bed to their right. Tony looks down at him in surprise and the boy grins. “Mom had a small garden in our all house. She said we needed most of the space for fruits and veggies and stuff, but she liked to have flowers. She planted all the ones she could. She likes carnations best, but she had all sorts. They kind of look the same, and I mostly can’t tell them apart so those I pointed at might be carnations, but,” he ends his sentence in an embarrassed shrug and looks down at where his hands are wringing together in his lap.
“Tony, what—“Steve starts, wide eyed. He had known that they didn’t have the best relationship. Had known that there was a lot of bad blood there, still, but…
if you think I’m going to apologize for that because I won’t. I lost JARVIS during that fiasco, you think you and the girl are only ones who lost something that day? Fuck you, I lost my
under scraps of cars for me to fucking get it. the suit knows my moves better than I do, Tony, how many times have you told me that? I’ve seen you bring down tanks, and airfare carriers and
I know it's been a while and I wanted to apologize for that. Things have been coming at me like crazy lately. It was barely the beginning of August and suddenly it was my birthday and now it's almost the end and whoa. Plus, work is still shitty as hell.
“With Barnes,” he says, and his voice is no longer the controlled tone that he has perfect. Tasha’s mouth quirks up. “How is he?”
“No, Tony, listen to me,” the other man plants himself in front of Tony with an earnest look in his eyes. He’s holding onto Tony’s shoulders and even Baby Bart is quietly gnawing on his fingers. “I don’t know about the others, but for my part I am
, and I’d never heard him like that before. He’d been hurt whenever he came back to school, but never like that. So I told my Mama that I needed to get to New York, she knew all about Tony, and she all but pushed me out the door, you know? So I get to the mansion, and Edwin almost jerks the door right off its hinges and says
, and even, surprisingly, babysitting. Though he’s only been brave enough to spend a half hour with Baby Nate alone. He’s not afraid to admit that the other children sort of intimidate him, especially Cooper and the Harley boy, so he’s managed to keep his distance. Baby Nate, on the other hand, had decided that barring his favorite uncle, Steve would suffice. Which is good because Tony had locked himself away again and the soldier figured the baby’s father might actually weep if he had to walk him up and down hallways again.
Once again, like so many times before when one of his teammates said something scathing about Iron Man, Steve felt unease curl in his stomach. He had to bite his tongue to refute it, call out the evidence that clearly Tony was still thinking of them, and merely nod. He avoided their gazes, but couldn’t avoid Bucky’s. The man’s dark eyes looked into his, and not for the first time, Steve caught a bare hint of disapproval. The man looked away and got to his feet before the blond could confirm it, though. Steve heaved a sigh and nodded to the others. They left Scott where he was, figuring he wouldn’t wake before they were back, and made their way to their rooms slowly.
Tony thinks hysterically about bad sides and secrets and a whole lot of darkness kept just under the surface. “She hated him, we all knew that! Him, specifically, though I’m pretty sure bringing us all down would have been just as fun. And we all forgave her for that. We all understood, but it’s been
“Laura, where is To—“ her eyes go impossibly round as she catches sight of the man on the couch. Tony bites his lip at the noise Lang makes, and then his daughter is tearing to his side with a heartbreaking chant of “Daddy, daddy,
“Boss, your presence is required,” she says in the no nonsense tone she’d adopted from talking to too many moms.
about me? I was done with middle school when I was eight, thank you very much, I’m not the one that has to pass geography. And no,” Tony interrupts and
“Torture,” Tony says pathetically and lets his head fall  onto his desk. “She’d torture and then dismember me.”
Now, there are occasional morning coffees with either Sam or Bucky. There’s lunches with Maria and Natasha whom he met at the gallery the first week he was back. There’s bar runs he’s not really interested in all that much, late night runs and afternoons sketching at the park. There’s avoiding Times Square like the plague because at least one of those giant screens will have
Tony in that moment… the man who’d babble when he was nervous, the man who liked Steve’s hot chocolate after a bender, the man who’d jokingly-but-not-really offered to buy the Dodgers on a whim for him… he’d been so, so stupid.
friend, his companion, his partner, his bonded… Tony was the love of his life, and now all of that is gone. Now Steve has no idea what the hell is going on with him, with his son; he doesn’t know if they’re okay, if they’re holding it together or if they’ve started drifting apart. Grief is an ugly, hard thing, and sometimes it takes the best of us. His heart breaks every time he starts to wonder if Peter feels abandoned, or if Tony feels alone.
“Like hell!” Rhodey and Peter say at the same time. The others had begun to get up from their seat, though Sam remained resolutely in his, but then they pause and look at the others apprehensively.
Tony is bent over the counter laughing and Rhodey, who had followed Steve’s lead with the cereal, is thumping his chest and trying to dislodge the cereal. They’re both laughing so hard they’re almost crying, and Steve tries to keep the frown on his face. It’s hard, though, when Tony gets a paper towel to wipe the counter and goes to sit down next to him with a big smile on his face. He swaps their bowls, and this time Steve looks down quickly and notices his, thankfully, plain cheerios.
“And whose fault is that, Agent Barton,” T’Challa said with a tone of warning in his voice. He was on his feet, though one of his hands was dangling at his side where Lila had hold of his pinkie finger.
know, if it hadn’t been for the tiny step his son had taken that first day in his direction before he’d back tracked, he knows because of Stark. Because of their conversation before the other man had locked himself away. He closes his eyes and tries to keep his breathing even as he remembers.
it’s been fucking years and the sound of Tony’s voice still brings back the memories of sitting in a balcony sipping beer and talking about everything and anything. Months, years, of drills and sparring sessions and museum visits and concerts and workshop visits and just… everything Tony had given him. Given them. Memories of the touch of his pinky finger where it hooked to Steve’s, the feeling of his beard prickly and soft in equal measure against Steve’s chin, the fluffy hair after waking up, the taste of blueberries from Tony’s mouth… it all comes rushing back even now.
Steve’s body reacts before his head does, and suddenly he has Bucky’s phone in his hands. He reads over the brief summary of his life, his recovery after his kidnapping, the ousting of Stane from SI and
“Is he okay?” Tony asked and poked Clint on the arm. The archer merely grumbled and readjusted and then went back to sleep. Baby Barton had face planted onto Tony’s chest and was gnawing at his shirt.
a vicious voice snarls in his head. Steve feels his legs stumble when the self-recrimination hits him. He shakes his head hard to dispel the thought, but the guilt has already settled. He doesn’t know what it says about him that
“You know me?” she says, a spark in her eye. She’s still suspicious, Tony can tell, but she’s not as stiff as before.
, that’s where he is. That’s where Rhodes and Viz go and why Spider-Man doesn’t need his room in our wing. Tony is
Steve turns around and his heart sinks to his stomach when he sees the face on the screen. Bucky curses quietly under his breath as he looks at the “Surprise Guest” the gossip show had been boasting about earlier. Tony Stark sits on a plush couch, his goatie is immaculately trimmed and his suit fits him like a glove; to anyone who doesn’t know him he looks poised and but together. But he’s wearing sunglasses, and he has his hands clasped between his knees in a way that, even now, Steve knows belies his anxiety. The words “broken engagement” blur in Steve’s eyes under his picture.
“I tried to kill Bucky,” Tony sees and Steve sees it with an aching heart. the way Tony is saying it as though he expects another fight. Like he’s saying it with a knowledge in his heart that Steve will lash out and hurt him. Even now, there’s a distinct separation in his mind of the people Steve will fight
had already had a no on the tip of his tongue. He’d never questioned the how or why of Tony knowing about that story. He’d never bothered to know why Charlie Spencer had ever come to pass the genius’s lips. Now,
“do you want me to start fanning you with the folder?” she says with a smirk. She appears unrepentant of her candor and teasing in the face of one of the most powerful men in the world, and that helps. It brings a sense of familiarity that he’s been missing for far too long, and has refused to think about for almost as long.
and the practiced, flippant rebuttal of that statement. The hollow way in which he said the words. Christ, but what an idiot he’d been. So no, Tony didn’t go out there and build houses for the poor. Instead he gave. Of his money, of his time, of his company, of his suit, of his mind, of his heart, of his
“Pete,” Tony whispers now, heart pounding in his chest. It’s always a toss-up, how Peter will react to breakdowns like this. Most days, in a move practiced by Tony which infuriates the mechanic, he’ll take a deep breath and tell his father that he’s fine. Other times, he’ll scream till he’s hoarse. Tony lets him have those because God knows it’s leaps and bounds better than destroying half the compound’s rooms. Less often, though, he will fling himself into his father’s arms and weep like his heart is broken. Tony’s own gets destroyed every time that happens. “Come on, kiddo. Come to dad, come one.”
“Look, Captain,” Tony says and pinches the bridge of his nose. He can’t do this, he decides. He’s not this strong, and he can’t even pretend to be this strong. “How ‘bout I say
“I’m sure she understood, Tony,” Steve says barely above a whisper. He forgets, always forgets, how much guilt the mechanic carries with him. Guilt about what he’s done, but also about all the things he couldn’t change. He always forgets how much Tony takes onto his shoulders that shouldn’t be his burden. “She must have loved you enough to know that. From the way you’ve spoken about her, I know that much even if never met her in person.”
was making sure to pass around plates and napkins and making sure the giggling kids didn’t try to get a slice before everyone had sat down. Sam clapped him on the back with a chuckle as Scott beat it out of there and sat down next to his daughter.
Something twists inside Steve’s chest. God, there’s so much he doesn’t know. There is so much he was willfully blind to.
Tony swallows the lump in his throat with some difficulty. “Then I’ll deal with it then. They deserve at least a while before I soil that happiness too,” he tells the hallway. He thinks he could do with a few aspirin and sometime banging out things in the workshop. “It’s not as if I’ve never done that before,” he tells himself as he walk away.
speared into the ground, dying. Thor’s armor was crushed, in my vision.” Tony, fucking Christ this wasn’t the Stark persona Clint kept thinking about, blinked up at the fading sky and the corners of his mouth trembled. “And up there was a hole like New York and an enemy that we couldn’t beat. And I get it, okay, I get that you all rally behind Cap’s noble
“Tony,” Steve starts, but there are no words. He had made his choice to let Tony go, to let him fly as high as his brain could get him, and now he has to stick to the consequences.
“Mr. Stark?” the voice breaks when it says his name. It trembles, as if unsure on how to talk to Tony. He closes his eyes tightly for a second before hissing out a curse. His mouth is cottony-dry and there is an insistent pounding on his right temple. His stomach growls, though he feels the taste of bile in the back of his throat. Jesus.
But he hadn’t listened, and even though he hadn’t been the only one, he might have been the most overzealous. Now, they were so deep in shit that they couldn’t even begin to see a way out. Fugitives, criminals, outcasts… depending on the man they had reviled when he had been trying to help. He should have done better, he should have—he huffed out a breath and pulled at his hair.
She’d been a godsend for him when he’d just moved to London; a director at the museum he was interning with and a no nonsense woman who had told him in no uncertain terms that she had no time for amateurs as soon as they’d met. Steve, never one to resist strong, independent, loud-mouthed brunettes, had been lost from the start. She produced in him a type of awe and adoration he had only ever felt once before. She was strong-willed and driven but also very funny and one of the most caring people he could have ever met. Steve had been too afraid to even say more than a quiet hello to her for the first few months of his new life, but then she had found him and asked him if he had anything against inviting a gal out for dinner.
Tony isn’t home anymore. The mansion is locked up and dark and nobody will tell him anything about where he might be. A tall gentleman had asked him if his name was Steve, and when Bucky said he knew him the man had asked him, coldly yet polite, to stop calling. Master Stark had enough grief to deal with at the moment.
He’s next aware of his surroundings when Vision grunts from somewhere near him and he feels the quin begin to descend. Natasha is sitting next to him, one hand on the arm rest between them, and without thinking he throws his hands over hers and holds on tightly. Not enough to break her delicate fingers, but just enough to hold on. He doesn’t want to think about what’s coming, what he will find, the greeting he will get. He doesn’t want to think about Thaddeus Ross waiting with a convoy for them. He doesn’t want to think about the people missing in his home. He doesn’t want to think about the bleakness and barely-hidden anger he’d heard in Rhodey’s voice when Bruce had passed him the phone.
Tony woke up, every day, because he had a kid at home that went from calling him Mr. Stark, to boss, to Tony, to Mr. Dad, and Tony would now, more than ever, burn everything in the universe to see him safe.
“I was relieved, for a second. I was so, so grateful that you hadn’t left because… because I didn’t know what I would do if I lost you again, but… when I saw you. When—the way you were crying broke my heart. I didn’t know why, I didn’t know if it was something I’d done, if I had hurt you somehow… I didn’t know how to help. I felt useless, I felt useless to
“He’s not in these,” he says slowly. With the index finger of his metal hand, he points at the schematics. “These are all of us, plus Rhodes and the Vision. There is a room labeled as a visiting room for someone called Spider-Man, but there’s no—“
“Okay,” Steve says immediately. He gives Tony a small hesitant smile before taking a cautious step forward. “Tell him I said hello,” he whispers in Tony’s ear before planting a soft kiss on Tony’s cheek. The mechanic feels his skin heat up.
, knows that it wasn’t the other pilot’s choice. He also knows that Rhodey is planning on ambushing him soon enough so that they can talk about it.
. He shook his head to dispel the painful memory and met Wanda’s eyes. “I talked to Tony,” he said again and he could tell that the inflection wasn’t lost on Wanda. He expected to see shame in her eyes, and he was incredibly glad that there was a bit of that, but he was disheartened at the anger. “I’m sorry, Wanda,” he said as he got to his feet. He meant it with every fiber of his being. “I can’t testify for you. I won’t be able to be there today.”
Rogers gave him a tentative smile when he caught sight of him, which Tony resolutely ignored as he tried to look for a seat. Rhodey was already sitting between Viz and Cooper and T’Challa had been captured and was sitting between Lila and Cassie. The little girls were so excited, and couldn’t seem to contain their questions. When one of them called him Kitty King, and the other giggled, T’Challa’s narrowed eyes met Tony’s. Rhodey couldn’t keep his laugh in, and even Viz offered a serene smile. Tasha was shaking her head, and both Rogers and Wanda had a confused look on their face.
“Jarvis’s wife,” Tony explained with a fond shake of his hand. “She was our cook until she got too sick to keep going; even then she commandeered the kitchen every time she dropped by. She was one tough lady, and just as pretty as Mama. She was,” he breaks off with a chuckle and from the corner of his eye he sees Steve’s smile transform. He looks utterly
that his mother had died in an accident only to be told that she’d been murdered. And if he’d found out that
“If you’re sure,” Sam said softly. “We’ll be here,” he said confidently, and Tony noticed the tone of warning in his voice. For once, he was fairly certain it wasn’t meant for him. The mechanic saw Lang nod from the corner of his eye.
“You just go get him, and bring him back,” Steve opens his mouth to agree quickly, but Peter cuts him off. “
“I woke up and you were still sleeping,” Tony begins in a whisper, voice shaking. Steve kisses his knuckles and holds his hand between both of his. “I hadn’t had that, you, like that in so long, you know? But I’d pictured it, had woken up and been disappointed so many times since—since you left that—“ Tony is crying again, whole body trembling, and Steve hates it so much. He hates that the picture is starting to get so clear in his mind now. “I woke up, and you looked so beautiful, and I thought I was dreaming again. I thought that maybe I was just imagining, but you looked
“Bruce,” he says quietly and Natasha hisses like she’s been punched in the stomach. “What the hell is going on?”
anyways, thanks for all your well wishes and kudos and comments. Work and my depression and stupid boys ( meaning MY version of Steve) are still kicking my ass, but you're making me feel better with each comment. Sorry i haven't gotten around to individual responses.
He had always been, well, more. More than Steve knew. More than he could comprehend. More than he deserved. That last one is the thing that kills him the most. Even at his worst, Steve always knew Tony was more than he deserved. Maybe, he thinks as he looks at the backdrop of Tony’s message, the wonderful terrifying reality of all those stars, maybe more than Earth itself deserved. Maybe that’s why fate itself had taken him away from them. But no, he tells himself with a violent shake of the head, that’s not true. This wasn’t fate, hell, it wasn’t even Thanos, this was them. All of them, and their refusal to hear even one bit of the things Tony had tried to tell them about. This was
was supposed to keep her safe, but instead I left her. I left her, Babbo, and they came, and they took her. I’m Spider-Man, you know, I’m supposed to protect people, but what good am if I can’t even—I can’t—“Peter’s breathing passes the threshold from upset into hyperventilating. Tony’s heart shreds with every word he speaks, but he can’t break down right now, not when his son needs him like this.
“Listen, I’m not here to tell you how to run your life. God knows your punk ass won’t listen to me no matter how hard I try, but I need you to understand something. The first time you, when you—” Bucky gets this faraway look in his eyes, and Steve feels a knot forming in his stomach at the fear in them. “When you left him the first time was bad, Steve. Finding him… the way that I did scared the shit out of me. He was my friend, too, and even though I never picked sides I’m sure he thought that I did.”
, Tony had said, and though it hadnt been only him who put a grenade on their team, he still had enough responsibility to feel as though he needed to fix what they’d broken.
Steve stowed in his anger for the next day and a half. Every time he asked FRIDAY where her boss was, she informed him that the man was out of the compound. The third time, when she mentioned Manhattan, Steve had felt something like jealousy flare up in his chest. He split his time between the gym and trying to help Wanda prepare for her upcoming hearing. The others, mainly the children, gave them a wide berth. He didn’t want to think about what that meant, if Tasha or Laura had spoken to them, and what it said about their actions that they were clearly kept away.
“Together?” Tony says tentatively. One of his hands, though, oh those calloused long fingers, grabs hold of Steve’s t-shirt with the same fervor the soldier is holding onto him. Steve hides his smile on the riot of curs atop his head.
, Steve! I saw her and it was like something in my mind resigned itself it its fate and was just like
, again? Wanda was a kid, nobody would ever convince him otherwise, but… but it wasn’t all on him anymore, was it? Early on in his relationship, he had accused Tony of always thinking he knew better than everyone else. He had been a hypocrite then, and all his tenure as the de-facto leader of the Avengers, he had been accusing Tony of his own faults.
Tony spins aimlessly in his chair down at the lab, and wonders what the fuck he thinks he’s doing. There’s a prosthetic metallic arm in front of him, and the schematics for neuro-sensors and connection and psychoanalytical theories that my not even work. There’s a tactile model of a brain to his right where he’s been doing some research. Highlighted parts of it indicate the places where a neurosurgeon, an old acquaintance of Helen Cho, has given some of his insight.
Tony barely sees Sam come into the room, his easy smile quickly falling from his face, before there’s a fist connecting with his jaw. His head snaps to the side, and he can feel the sting of tears in his eyes. He thanks whatever deity is looking out for him,
… and waits, and waits until the adrenaline begins to slow down and he dares to peek up over his eyes. Steve has staggered backwards, and there’s an absolutely devastated look on his face as he stares at Tony, his head shaking. Slowly, devastatingly and horrifically slowly, Tony’s brain makes the connection that this is different. That Steve will not hurt him; not after how much they’ve been trying for the last few days. “Steve—“he begins shakily, trying to step forward but his knees feel as though they’ll buckle if he moves.
“I can’t tell you,” Bucky says with a shake of his head. “I promised him I wouldn’t, and even now I won’t. Maybe he’ll want to tell you, someday, if you make it that far but I won’t break his trust. I haven’t in all these years and I won’t start now, but… Sam is going to kill me for saying this, but I need to tell you. Stevie, you fucked up a good thing all those years ago,” Bucky says seriously.
“Well, he can’t drink himself to unconsciousness this time,” he’d said with a cold voice. It had hurt worse than any angry words could have. “Though I’m not sure the way he’s using the BARF is any better.” Then he’d walked away, leaving Steve as though he was rooted to his spot.
Steve reads the same sentence over and over again. Wills his brain to believe that maybe Tony might be alive. Somewhere. Wishes that he were home, with his friends who know him and his love for the other man, so that he could feel a support system when it feels like his whole world is crumbling down around him again.
“It’s all right, Tony,” Steve says with conviction. He swears on his Ma’s grave that he’ll try to be what his family deserves. Finally. “We’ll work on it.”
Some things can never be forgotten, but forgiving them? That's... well, that's not easy, but it's doable. especially if they're wanted so much by both.
Rhodey, bless him, doesn’t call him on his avoidance bullshit. Merely claps a hand on Tony’s shoulder and pulls him to his feet. “C’mon, man,” he says quietly. Tony gives him a grateful little twitch of his lips and follows him.
, God, he couldn’t breathe and there was debris on top of him, and everything was dark and he couldn’t do anything…
“Look, man,” Sam had persisted with a far gentler touch to his arm. “I don’t know what you guys talked about in that conference room. I don’t know what kind of ground you’re standing on, but that man—I don’t know him well, we didn’t get a chance to become friends, not like you two did, but… that man, he cares a hell of a lot about all of us. He’s spent a hell of a lot of time trying to keep us safe, too, and I just—hell, Steve, maybe it’s about time we start thinking about what he needs rather than what we want. I know,” he’d said loudly when Steve opened his mouth to speak, a hand raised to stall his words. “That you want to know that he’s okay, but look me in the eye and tell me that you’re sure he’d take it well if you stormed in there right now and demanded he tell you what they talked about. Look me in the eye, and tell me that he wouldn’t assume you’re there to berate him for something.” The
,” he spits out. “But oh, did I know what it meant. Jarvis just looked at me and said ‘you know the drill, young man,’ he only called me that when he wasn’t too happy with me. So,” he shakes his head again and pretends the moisture in the corner of his eyes isn’t there. “I got to know what soap tastes like real quick.”
Tony finally meets his eyes in confusion. Obviously, he had never thought to ask himself this question. He’d just accepted the fact that a random woman had walked to him to confront him about his son. Steve doubts the words murderer hadn’t passed her lips. He wonders how many of these incidents Tony was subjected to on a regular basis.
Being in the communal floors still makes his chest tighten though he doesn’t feel his hands tremble anymore. After that first meeting, and after Rhodey had gone Barton hunting and had gotten the coffee table snapped in half, things seemed to have simmered down. Everyone seemed to have reached an agreement about staying out of one another’s space. Though sometimes he would run into Sam on his way to coffee, and after the first couple of days where the other pilot would just look at him, now they would smile at each other nicely enough. Sam had even gone as far as apologizing for Rhodey to
There is a long beat of stunned silence in the room as the words settle between them. He hears Sam’s sharp intake of breath. Hears the couch creak as Bucky leans back onto it like his strings had been cut all at once.
Tony had made peace with his own end back when the Battle of New York happened. Back then, when their biggest problem was a demigod on a power trip, it had felt like a good ending. It felt like… his arch was up. He had done everything he could, and after all he was just a man, anway. Broken. Vulnerable. Tiny. Human.
“Maybe that’s true, but she damn well can trigger someone’s anxiety, Clint! She sure as fuck can make a person have an episode because of what she did! And
, Tony realizes the more the blond pretends to struggle. It’s an emotion the engineer is intimately familiar with. “Fuck your sorries, I don’t care about them. Steve,” Tony says pleadingly and takes the blond’s face in his hand. Steve closes his eyes and then blinks up at the ceiling. “Look at me,” the brunette says quietly. “I don’t care about your sorries or the stupid letter you sent me—“
“All of them are, actually,” Tony says with his own attempted grin. “I was actually supposed to be throwing this huge party. I’m kind of famous for them, you know? But nobody showed.”
“I’m not like Stane,” Steve said weakly. Like he was pleading with Tony to deny it. Like it was the absolutely worst insult Tony could have given him. The memory seems to assault them both.
“another hundred to the college fund, sir,” FRIDAY chirps and Steve would swear there’s amusement heavy in her lilting voice.
“It was such a long way down, and I guess this new suit is super intuitive?” Peter is not stopping his nervous word-puke and Tony honestly has no words anymore. His mind is going a mile a minute trying to figure out a way to send his kid back home without getting all of them killed. What in the world is he supposed to do now? This is exactly why—
Steve walks towards Rhodes and Hogan with heavy steps. He doesn’t feel right, leaving Tony behind, but he also knows a dismissal when he hears one. Tony might have been ready to share stories about Howard and Peggy, since Steve had known and cared for both, and give a glimpse about his mother. Though the soldier doesn’t know
The tension in the room escalates steadily the longer the silence goes on. Tony bites his lip in an effort to keep from saying something. The urge to bolt is strong, but despite Cap having the reputation of never backing out of a fight Tony has the reputation of throwing himself head first into a struggle. Consequences be damned. They’ve been skirting around the bit fucking gap in their acquaintance for close to a month. Tony has kept his mouth shut against all the accusations he wants to scream at the blond. Starting with
, and was put out of commission for a while. I was handling another problem when the Accords were proposed or I would have been here to try to aid you all. I’m sorry about that,” Steve turned to look at him, but found that Phil wasn’t looking at him at all, but rather at Tony. Something squeezed in his chest when he saw his genius nod back solemnly. But I am here now, and I have been made aware of the situation. It wouldn’t be the first time I’ve had to deal with damage control of this kind, and I figured you needed all the help you could get, Ms. Maximoff.”
“’Teve,” Nate coos at him now, a big gummy smile on his face. The baby had refused to let go of his shirt since the morning when Clint had dumped him in Steve’s lap to feed. The blond soldier had been about to protest when he saw Cooper behind his father, a soccer ball tucked under his arm, and a smile on his lips. His eyes had snapped up to meet Clint’s and the unbridled
“Nah, buddy,” he says but his voice is rough. Sam gives his shoulder one last squeeze. “C’mon, let’s find the mini-bots before they destroy my building.” As if on cue, there’s the sound of cheering, both human and robotic, from the room down the hall. Tony laughs, and it’s a bit more genuine than it’s been in a long time. “You coming, Sam?”
This isn’t about him, and he knows that. He’s managed to muck enough things up trying to protect Wanda, treating her like a kid, to not know when to keep his mouth shut. Still, the urge is there. Every time he looks at her he remembers the way she’d found her after Lagos. Curled up in her bed while the newscasters had tore apart her every action, had accused her of things that she wasn’t. His protective instinct had flared up then, and it’s flaring up now, but he knows he can’t say anything. If there is anything that he’s learned so far is that his meddling isn’t helpful, not always, and he refuses to hurt her more than he already has. His meddling had landed her in the raft, it took a long time for him to realize that, a long while of blaming Tony for it, but he’s begun to recognize his shortcomings a bit better now. At least he hopes. So he keeps his mouth shut.
that he knows damn well his father has never been able to resist. So he just hauls him into his arms and buries his head into his son’s hair. “You didn’t think this through at all.”
was still imbedded in his chest. Maybe the voice is still the same, and the impact is the same, but the aftermath is infinitely different now. He wills his fingers to stop trembling where they grip the plate with his left over food and the cup with the coffee Rhodey had given him. He sees Steve’s angry eyes on them, though, and knows he’s failed at that too.
“Like I jumped to conclusions,” Tony says and tries to make his voice sound even. The words taste as dusty and bitter as a lie on his tongue, but he desperately wills himself to believe them himself. “My head’s just in a bad place right now, is all. Okay? He wasn’t going to hurt me. Right, Captian?” Tony forces himself to meet the blond’s eyes.
“Think I’m that stupid, do you?” Tony says and he’s not even offended. It’s not like the young man is lying.
,” Steve says loudly when it looks like Tony might interrupt, “disastrously ended up on you getting a concussion and needing three stitches.”
he calls out desperately. He cards his fingers through his hair and holds on to his head. From where Steve’s sitting, it looks as though the genius is trying to keep his skull in one piece. He leans both hands on the glass, his vision blurry by tears, as he watches.
Now, though, he can’t do that for them. They’d taken that confidence away from him, and now he can’t pretend like he can forget what they’ve been through and let them in again. Not this soon. So, instead, he does the second thing he’s best at when things get to be too much. When he can’t find the strength to put his armor on and confront the world. He wordlessly turns around and accepts the plate that Laura hands to him without another word.
“You fucking did it,” Peter said, and Tony couldn’t even be bothered to chastise him for the language. He was feeling way too much.
“Unca ‘Ony, ‘Teve?” he asked hopefully. Steve tried to keep his face from smiling too fondly at the now familiar question. For the most part, the baby could go most of the day without needing to see his uncle. He’d look around the kitchen in the morning during his breakfast, but wouldn’t give any other indication of looking for his favorite person. Unless his favorite person disappeared for more than a day, and seeing as Tony hadn’t emerged in a while, the boy was getting in what they now fondly called Tony withdrawal.
“I tore our family apart,” Tony hisses at him, and he can’t help but grasp at the edge of the table. The force of his grip hurts his palm, but he doesn’t care. He holds the king’s gaze, he’s never been one to back out of a fight, and tries to control his erratic breathing. “If it weren’t for me they never would have been targeted. They never would have gone to prison. This… this
This morning, though, he’d taken one look at the man sleeping beside him and knew that there was no way that he would be getting his morning run in. Not only that it was nearly seven in the morning, far later than he usually woke up, but he couldn’t afford to not be in the compound when the others woke up. He knew that most of them would be on their way out the door earlier than they usually did. It was already six in the morning, and he could hear the faint stirrings of the others as they got ready to leave the Compound.
Clint stares after him a second, clearly debating whether following him or not would work, before he comes to a decision. His eyes seek Steve’s, to see if he can deal with the Tony situation alone, and then rushes after his son when the soldier nods. Laura looks torn before Steve motions with his head for her to follow them. She asks that he call her when he finds their wayward genius before following her boys.
to lest he does something stupid later on. Again. “It’s the whole reason I signed them despite my own reservations with them. Everyone thought that I didn’t have a problem with Ross spearheading the efforts, but I figured that it was best if I involved myself in the proceedings lest he try to twist them into something much worse than what they ended up.”
The name on the headstone? Agent Margaret Peggy Carter. Founder of SHIELD. It had her birth date and the day they laid her to rest in London. Tony had been here, in Brooklyn, overseeing the marking of the plot and the installation of the symbolic headstone while Steve had laid her on the ground, thousands of miles away. He rubs a hand on his chest absently, trying to get rid of his phantom pain, as he remembers the last news he got from Peggy’s family. They hadn’t thought to call him, and that was fine, he’d never been close to them, anyway. After their falling out, Tony’s contact with Aunt Peggy had diminished to the occasional phone call while Jarvis kept look out. Once Tony had started at MIT, their conversations were sparse as they both became busier and busier. Then, the incident in 1991 had happened, and Peggy had been there. Tony still remembers the strength in her arms and the smell of her perfume, the stickiness of her bright red lipstick on his cheek, and the ticklishness of her hair, streaked in silver, rubbing on his neck. It’s the last time he’d ever see her as she was when he was little, strong and hardheaded and invincible, because he’d fall off the rails soon after that. He’d slick his hair back, and wear sunglasses at night, and do meth and coke and overdose on his antidepressants. He’d wear the badge of playboy and merchant of death with fake pride on his face and bile in his throat. Peggy would be so,
At eight am, they were all breakfasted and much more awake. They were due at the UN at nine fifteen, but they figured they should be getting ready to leave. As if on cue, T’Challa and Everett Ross and, surprising the living daylights out of everyone who knew him, Agent Phil Coulson walked into the room. Tony covered Nate’s ear and swore vehemently while Steve and Rhodey stared up at him wide eyed and Clint snorted loudly. Natasha, Steve noted absentmindedly, didn’t react at all. Sam, Scott, and Wanda stared between the newcomers and the others with curiosity. Vision merely smiled serenely.
“Together,” Tony tells him quietly. He stares off at the side where the Avengers logo is on the wall. “That’s what he said. That we had to it together or we would destroy each other. And what was the first thing I did? I went against that. He… they… I almost killed him, in Siberia. I was so angry, so hurt, that I didn’t care. I wanted him dead so that Mama… I was wrong, to do that.”
“I think it’s bullshit,” Rhodey says, and Tony can hear the barely controlled fury in his tone. A corner of his mouth ticks up at the surge of protectiveness from his brother. Though it’s tinge with guilt and bitterness as a hand goes down and fists at the Colonel’s thigh.
It was like walking into a wall. That was how hard the stench of alcohol hit Steve when he stepped into Tony’s workshop. His nose wrinkled as he ventured deeper, picking his way through an unhealthy amount of empty bottles on the floor. He could hear a voice from the back of the shop, though he couldn’t tell if it was Tony’s.
“Yes, it is!” Peter says urgently, looking at him. “You told me, months ago, to concentrate on being the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, right? Well, I can’t be that if there is no neighborhood!” Tony just looks at him for second, this heroic idiot of a son he’s been blessed with, and can’t help but feel an utter love and awe that he has played a part in raising him. Peter is the best parts of himself, and even if he wishes he could wrap him and his daughter in a bubble and keep them far away from this mess, Tony knows that is impossible. The best he can do is have Peter’s six at all times. The boy must confuse his silence for anger, though, because he starts stress-blabbering again. “Okay, that didn’t really make sense, but—”
Steve is left to stare at the door where his best friend since Kindergarten has just walked out of to comfort someone else. He doesn’t know what he feels, in that moment, but he will soon enough. Bucky has been with him for so many things, and the fact that he’s
“FRIDAY, where’s Tony?” Laura’s voice sounded a little desperate. Steve didn’t know how she’d even gotten the words out. His own throat felt as dry as a desert.
Tony was pulled out of his reverie when the other man stuck out a hand. The mechanic stared at him in confusion and then wearily shook his hand. Lang gave him a good squeeze, but it somehow didn’t seem threatening to Tony. Then, without warning, the other man pulled him in for the most awkward hug of his life. the mechanic tensed for a moment, and the other man let him go.
Tony frowned at Tasha, wondering who they were waiting for, but she merely raised an eyebrow at him and gave his hand a light squeeze. From the corner of his eye, he could see the hard clench of Barton’s jaw. He suppressed a sigh of annoyance. Sooner or later it felt like they would have to go to blows to get stick the archer had up his ass.
So Steve does what he has proven himself to be very apt at, and he runs. All the way across the pond and keeping only the bare minimum news on his former lover. Just enough to reassure himself that even though they might be together anymore, right here in this universe, Tony still exists.
“A-aunt Peggy?” Steve’s voice is a hoarse whisper and Tony’s head snaps up to him. He’d almost forgotten he was there. The soldier is standing stock still next to him, hands in the pocket of his leather jacket, but his chest is rising and falling as though he’s about to start hyperventilating. His eyes are wide, and red rimmed as they look down at Tony and the mechanic doesn’t think he likes the expression there very much. It’s this swirling mix of guilt and sadness and misery that turns his eyes darker and stormy.
The first memory Tony has of his mother is of her face, haloed in her perfectly coifed thick dark hair, looking down on him as she rocks them in his favorite rocking chair. The cherry wood one with the perfectly carved characters from Le Petite Prince. He remembers everything as being very bright, and rich in color around the edges. Flowers he wouldn’t learn the names of until much later surrounding them and permeating the air around them in their rich perfumes. The memories after that are blurrier and much less pleasant, Tony having blocked most of his shitty childhood around Howard as well as he could, but the greenhouse had always been one of his comfort places.
Finally, on the night before the hearing was supposed to happen, he found Tony lounging on one of the communal living room’s couches. He had a hefty folder on one side, and a tablet on his lap; his feet resting on the coffee table in front of him. There was a cup of coffee next to them, too, and Steve, despite his anger, was still glad that it was nothing alcoholic. He made his way noisily into the room, he had noticed with shame the way Tony flinched now if someone snuck around him from behind, and cleared his throat.
“Per favore, babbo, tornare,” Tony closes his eyes tight at the fear and pain he hears in his kid’s voice. Peter knows the language well enough, but he doesn’t make it a habit of speaking it to anyone other than Tony and Morgan. And that is only when and if he’s feeling particularly emotional. To hear it now breaks Tony’s heart. He wants nothing more than to get off the fucking donut and go home, hug his kids close, and keep them safe.
“Is nobody going to let that go?” there is a grin on the blond man’s face as he says it, though, betraying his fake exasperation. Peter is standing at the island by his side, looking at him with his big bambi eyes, and Rhodey is sitting on the other side with a plate of pasta in front of him and the other by his side.
He walks out of the quin mindlessly and blind. All he knows is that he has to find Rhodey and Bruce, has to make a plan, and above all has to find out what had happened to his family. He leads his friends across the lawn from the helipad and into the compound. He takes a second, allows himself just one, to take in the smell of
Steve wonders what Peter’s image of them is. If he remembers his parents as being in love, content and sated in each other’s presence. Or if it’s all tinted with betrayal and regret now. He wonders if Peter now sees it differently; not as Steve loving Tony just as fiercely, but as something darker, uglier. He wonders if Peter thinks of Steve as the man who took all the love Tony gave him and then stabbed him in the back with it.
“What?” Steve blurted out, not able to keep his words in. He stared up at them incredulously, and Natasha stared back. Her face impassive, but Steve knew her well enough to see beyond the mask. He didn’t like what he saw there. It looked too much like disappointment. “For what?”
“Or that you’d left. I thought maybe you’d realized you made a mistake taking me back; I thought maybe that’s why you’d waited so long for us to… do that.”
“And it seemed like that might have been the final straw, you know? Sure he went to the occasional party, but once I asked it was like—he had this idea in his head that he had a reputation to maintain, you know? It seemed crazy to me, but one day—there was this stupid gossip rag in the trash bin, and there he was. This grainy picture of him at a party, and something about how he was
“I know you didn’t kill him even when you could have,” Sam says and Tony rears back because what the hell. “Tony, Steve told us how the suit works. He laughed about it then, and so did we,
“I can see that,” Steve says and brings a spoonful of the cereal up to his mouth without even looking at it. Which is a mistake as he promptly spits it back out. He looks down at the bowl and the offending bright chunks floating on his milk and staining everything in off-putting colors and turns to stare at Tony in disbelief. “You didn’t,” he says, with feeling.
Harley screams and his eyes are wide in almost-panic. Steve swallows hard at the distress on the boy’s face. And he looks just like what he is when before he’d looked like a miniature adult; a copy of Tony who’d learned the genius’s mannerisms well. Now, though, he looks like a scared little boy who has no idea what to do. “I was scared that you needed someone to talk you out of your head again and there was nobody around. I could
Peter pulls away with a frown on his face, but Tony shakes his head. It takes him a while, minutes or hours he doesn’t know, but eventually he finds enough strength to sit up properly. He scrubs a hand over his eyes, and when he looks up Peter is looking at him with that honest, open way only he can muster. A part of him, the broken jagged bitterness he carries every day, tells him that he’s being stupid. That he’s shared this part of himself with someone else before and he paid dearly for it. The other part, though, the tiny part that’s been sheltered by Peter’s visit and his honest affection, tells him to try.
Before he can respond, Stark ambles from the entryway down into the hallway. He’s rubbing one of his eyes while he looks down at his phone, and the closer he gets the more noticeable it is. He’s been crying, and Clint’s chest grows tight. In the last two weeks he’s seen more of Stark than ever before, and he’s begun to notice a pattern. Even when they had been a so called team, none of them had ever interacted with the mechanic much, and sure he had a tendency to go on long inventing benders often, but—well, the archer can’t deny that while they had all been having dinners and movie marathons and the like nobody had ever really tried to bring the mechanic in. they had made an effort with everyone else, but not with him. Other than Cap’s fumbling and half-assed attempts, that is.
“Then all we can do is try. One day at the time; despite the blow outs and the fights… we can just try, can’t we?”
lose him if you keep being a stubborn ass. He and Lila and Nate are just kids, Clint, they deserve better than a father who has more important priorities than his own children. Take it from a guy whose father cared more about a soldier that went missing in 1945 than he ever cared about his own kid.”
“You had no problem bringing him into a war,” Barton says, and the black eye he had given Tony on his first day back had hurt less.
“Can I help you with something, Cap?” The man said with a sigh. He passed his hand over the screen of his tablet and the screen went black. He looked up at Steve, and the blond felt some of the anger melt away. The genius was clearly exhausted, and he had to bite his tongue at the chastisement that sprung up his throat. He hated it when Tony stayed days on end in the lab, always had.
Tasha’s voice whispered in his head. It had been after the battle of New York when Tony’s mouth was running a thousand miles a minute. When he was trying to convince them that the Tower was the best place for them to be. When he was attempting to restrain himself from sounded too eager as he offered them his home. After, when only Tasha and Clint had agreed because it was late and they were exhausted and Tony had been unable to sleep and Tasha had found him nursing a tumbler of scotch while he sat in front of the floor to ceiling window.
, that he deserves the way the other man is looking at him. It has been a long time, and he has been angry and insecure for a lot of it, and so he hadn’t even tried. When Rhodey had kept him in the car after he saw Tony at the cemetery was the first time they had even had an actual conversation. They had been friends, damn it, back before the Accords messed happened. They had ribbed each other good naturedly about their branches, had sparred on their free time; Rhodey had helped him with the history he’d missed and even some of the pop culture when Tony wasn’t around. They had had rapport, and he was damned if he was going to keep laying down while all of that was taken away. He had already lost the people that mattered to him once, and, if for nothing else, his ill-advised overzealousness for Bucky was proof that he would fight for the people he called friends.
“Like she wasn’t already,” Sam said, and Tony snorted in surprise. The pilot gave him a big grin as Scott continued to bemoan his daughter’s corruption into nerdhood.
Steve closed his eyes and wept, alone in the cold of a fall afternoon in Austria, miles away from his family.
He gets out of bed, nudity be damned, and rounds the corner of it to sit next to his lover. Tony doesn’t flinch away, thank God, but his sniffling turns to sobbing and he curls tighter into himself. Steve’s eyes sting as he looks at him, his heart constricting, but he doesn’t let himself cry. Tony needs him to be strong right now and Steve would do anything for him.
. He forces himself to stand there, a solid rock Tony can’t see and obviously thinks he can’t have, as the genius continues to run every possibility he can think of for that bloody disastrous day.
“Look at this!” he says heatedly. He’s waving the paper too fast for Steve to read, but apparently that doesn’t matter. “A C+ on fucking geography! A subject he could pass in his
Sam turns out to be a pretty good babysitter. Tony sits with Baby Bart on his lap on the floor of the rec room after the children make them move the furniture around for their puzzle. Cooper is acting as the official big brother for both Lila and Cassie. He lets them pick the activities that they want to play and doesn’t seem at all phased when the little girls put a sparkling purple crown on his head and make him color their My Little Pony book. Sam sits by them and hands them the colors for a good bit; he offers his sincere criticism of their coloring skills and Tony laughs at the seriousness of the children.
, and suddenly he goes out? His eyes snap at Peter and sees the panic in the teenager’s eyes as well. “When did he go out?”
Now all Steve had was a pocket full of memories, and a chain with a ring around his neck, and the constant feeling of emptiness that filled his chest with every breath. He bowed his head again, gritted his teeth against the sobs that were threatening to choke him and put the phone against his ear.
, is what he doesn’t say. Stark isn’t looking at him, he’s still riveted looking up at the sky with a heaving chest, but Clint has his eyes locked on him regardless. “So, yes, I was terrified. I was terrified and in denial and I made Ultron because despite the fact that
“Aw, ‘Teve!” and then a giggle. Sam turns wide eyed at Baby Bart who claps at the attention he gets. And then he points at the blond, and says, “’Teve!” the man in question is watching the baby open mouthed. In the past few days, while everyone has made a concentrated effort in befriending the children, nobody has managed to make Baby Bart pronounce their names. Except for Sam that first day, and nobody quite knows why Baby Bart decided he was worthy. Mostly, he merely points. The only words the boy seems to really want to say being Mumma and ‘Onny. Needless to say, the competitive bastards had turned it into a metaphorical bloodbath.
“That’s not what I meant,” Steve says with a small smile. He can’t express what it’s like to feel Tony’s unshakable faith in him. Even when he has screwed up and hurt him so badly. Tony’s heart is so pure, and he doesn’t even seem to notice. “I meant in here,” he brings up a hand to tap at his temple. “I haven’t been okay since losing Bucky on that train, but I was too stubborn and too angry to really let that sink in. Looking back,” he shakes his head and hugs Tony closer, “so many of the mistakes could have been avoided if I had given myself time. Even knowing I wasn’t okay, at times, I pushed myself to push forward.”
“Anyway, I just don’t feel like I’m the best fit to defend her. I don’t have much reason to trust her or give my word for her. I’m sorry, Steve. I really am. I wish I could but I—when they called me in for it, I recused myself. I told them that I couldn’t be impartial so I just—I suggested they call you in, but they—“
.” the confession tears itself out Tony’s throat and it hurts. It hurts to much to admit he’s been ruined for everyone else.
“It’s all right, Petey, it’s okay, honey,” Tony says quietly, carding his fingers through his boy’s hair. He grasps one of Peter’s hands, presses them against his chest, and takes a deep breath. “There, find my heartbeat, baby. You hear it?” Peter nods, breath still frantic. “Okay, okay, you’re doing so well. Now, match my breathing, bud. Deep breaths. In through your nose, out through your mouth,” Tony takes exaggerated breaths, hoping his boy will match him. It takes a bit, but Peter gets there. When his breathing has calmed down, he sags against Tony’s chest, and the mechanic wraps him up in his arms tightly.
, he just can’t. Steve’s other arm wraps around him to bring him closer, and Tony’s hands go up to rest against the other man’s frankly impressive chest.
By the time the others are gone, it’s only Natasha and the king that remain. Tony thinks that maybe they’ve thought better about what happened in Siberia and will stay to moderate. He’s hoping that is the case because his mind is honestly in so much disarray that he doesn’t think he’ll be able to control most of his instinctual reactions. That illusion is shattered when the woman by his side raises elegantly to her feet. Tasha presses a kiss to his temple as she walks out of the room, her hand strong and steady on his shoulder, and without even looking he knows that she’s giving the Captain one of those
“Stop interrupting me, asshole,” Tony growls at him and gets a wet laugh from the soldier. “I meant, I’m not good at—at this—you saw how I was with and after Pepper,” Tony gives him a look when the other man opens his mouth to argue and he quickly closes it. “I don’t know how this works. I don’t know how to make things work, but I do know that we can’t—Steve, I can’t—“
, but every time Harley or Peter or any of the kids do the whole pouty thing he feels like the worst human on the planet. He might be, but that doesn’t mean that he wants to feel the kids feel bad.
“That’s why,” Tony said, deciding to be truthful. When the other man gave him a confused stare, Tony shrugged and shoved his hands into his pockets. “You said you didn’t know what you’d do if your daughter were in danger. I—to be honest, I did whatever you could when my family was.” Tony turned his head to look at Lang, and caught sight of a pair of blue eyes over the other man’s shoulders. “I did whatever I could to keep
“Can you blame him?” Sam says from the pilot’s seat, the first words he’s spoken to the pair since their impromptu rescue.
It isn’t until he feels the hands squeezing his wrists that Tony realizes that he’d screamed all of that out loud. Steve is nodding to him, though, the determined expression still resolutely on his face.
“Nah, I’m serious,” he presses something on the controls and gets off the chair. They continue gliding through airspace and Steve thanks Tony for his tech even if it does bring a pang to his sternum. “Did he know where you were going?” he directs the question at Vision.
He notices the hair, first, peeking over the step that leads from the hallway into the war room. It’s not as curly as Peter’s no, but it’s almost the exact shade of brown. There’s her little, tiny forehead too. Not as pale as Peter and Steve’s but still not the same olive as Tony’s. Her big, brown eyes, though. God. Those are almost identical; not in color, no, but they’re just as big and the lashes just as dark and curled the way Tony’s are. She raises her head a little more, a chubby little fist going up to his mouth as their eyes meet. She can’t be more than 10 months, but her eyes are bright with understanding. She tilts her head, and then she’s scrambling over the step.
… We didn’t want to drag you into another war. You did that, all on your own, so don’t you fucking blame me for ending up behind bars because of your shitty choices. OR maybe you meant I had had my turn to explain my side in the Raft? When you and Sam and even some asshole
Don’t let him sleep, he roams around the compound in his pajamas. More often than not he finds himself being redirected back to the Blue zones by a clinical voice that turns his stomach. It’s in one these trips that he makes his discovery.
, when he’d been young and excitable. He’d been knuckle-rapped in the head on more than one occasion for letting his mouth run ahead of him. It seemed as though it was literally the job of a super soldier to make him shut his mouth.
“Click it,” Bucky tells him seriously. He raises his eyes to his friends and sees both of them looking back at him steadily. “You need to see what he says.” Steve doesn’t think the words strange, but he will realize what they meant later. Sam and Bucky had known what Tony had said in that interview. They had known that Steve wasn’t okay, but that he wasn’t the only one.
“But I was wrong. Even when Thor came back, and confirmed that you had been right, I was still so angry at you. I was so angry that you and Bruce had gone behind our backs to make Ultron, and God I was such a hypocrite. I was so angry that despite everything we’d been through you
They lapsed into a tense silence as Stark stared at him and Clint stared back, trying to unjumble his thoughts. He kept circling back to what the other man had said, about his memories and his triggers. About the description,
Steve lets out a sob and drops his head in his hands, elbows on his knees. He feels like he’s crumbling from the inside and he doesn’t know how to control the pain. He can’t tell them. He can’t. They won’t understand.
“When my Ma died,” Steve says after a long pause and his voice sounds so raw. He clears his throat, and scooches closer to the mechanic. This time he doesn’t even pretend as though he’s not doing it. “I would go out later than usual and get into fights. I felt as though it was the only way I could feel something for a while there. Almost gave Buck a heart attack a week when I came back bloody,” Tony sees the way he cringes a little as the word leaves his lips and sighs. Steve is immediately backtracking. “I’m sorry, Tony, I just—“
"You can't let others tell you how you feel, " Tony soothes, without thinking, a hand softly brushing against Steve's cheek. A frisson zaps through him at the feeling of the soldier's stubble spiking his skin. Steve leans into his touch like it's the most normal thing in the world. Tony's heart grows. "It's not even in your control, so why should it be in theirs? " He understands how Steve feels. More than the world would care to listen.
"Tony, Tony doesn't say that, " Steve's face is blotched red, painted in punishing torment. "I love you and Peter more than anything in this life. You're mine, both of you, how can you think I don't love you? I, -"
"Hey, fuck you, alright? But yeah dad, let's keep him! I always wanted a brother! Please? I said 'please', so you know how much I want this."
Right then, Tony entered the apartment holding grocery bags which he desperately fought for against Susan, the annoying neighbor from above, only to be welcomed by a shouting match. "What's all this yelling?! I can hear you guys from across the, --" he dropped the bags the minute he saw Pietro holding a baby. A human baby. A breathing, human baby.
"Is Papa comin' home today?" A hand squeezes Tony's heart painfully tight at the small question. He looks down at his son, smaller than usual and playing with his fingers at his feet. His frail shoulder raise, housing an anxious breath as he awaits an answer.
Horror shines bright and clear on the blue eyes Tony loves so much. He spots Steve's finger tremble at his sides, notices the quivering movement of his Addams apple.
"And I assume you already knew all of this before you brought my son here and called me. I am sure you were a rational person and heard him out instead of ignoring what he had to say thinking that you know better."
I was listening to Ready Aim Fire and thought, “Y’know, it was inspired by Ironman 3 anyway, why not write a songfic on it?” So I did, and BOY was that fun! A little angsty, but that’s to be expected with a song from an album called ‘Heroes Fall’ inspired by a angsty movie, so... Enjoy!
He can't bring himself to be angry when he feels so sorry for them. All that money, and they couldn't buy a second of peace.
He called Steve and asked for his help after Stone caught him having a fight with Thomspon in the cafeteria. After a scolding that bored the teen out of his mind, Stone ordered him to call his parents, which made Pietro pause slightly.
He had a family. A happy family, nonetheless. After so many years, Tony can say he's nothing like Howard, he can say his kids are content, he can say they're safe and comfortable, and happy with him. Tony made sure to give them everything Howard didn't give him. It couldn't get any better than that.
"... I didn't wanna embarrass ya, " the confession left Tony flabbergasted. Blinking slowly, as if he just mishear something. His words failed him, but nodded, processing, giving Steve the Que. "Tony, you just... Ya were a big shot, you know? You were handsome, rich, smart, popular, everything everyone wanted to be.
"WE'RE NOT YOUR FUCKING CHORES," His voice is more roar than man, ragged, tight, pushed to the last limit. The garden of silent pain, fury, rage, and fear he's been harboring finally blossomed into something that seemed to shake the world. His body shudders. "We're not some,- some pestering tasks that you have to save your precious time to complete! Some fucking pets other people have to force you to care about, or some dirty laundry you wash whenever you feel like wearing! We're your damn FAMILY,- " A sob hitches his anger, and by the broken look on Steve's face, it's worse than any rage.
Papers brush smoothly above the marble surface, ear piercing to him. Red hot blazing into white noise. It's the most terrible sound he's ever heard. He prefers his breathless, agonized screams in Afghanistan to this. Steve recoils away, standing up suddenly and shakily, as if the documents are bombs about to kill him anytime now.
He explains the incident to the woman who runs the place as he looks around, bottom of his shoes sticking to the dirty floors and the overwhelming smell of mold invaded his nostrils, making his stomach clench in disgust. The children in there look like they haven't seen a bath and warm meal in weeks, some in their lives.
"Wait wait wait. Wait. Back it up a bit, - Hammer? As in, Justin Hammer? Why would he have anything to do with this?" At Steve's blank expression, the wheels in Tony's head sped up, allowing him to connect the dots. "Steve... You know I never went to prom, right?"
"That's nice, Pi," Wanda replied, absentmindedly flipping the page of her novel, "you better share it with me, shithead,"  but immediately her eyes winded in realization, standing up in a hurry "WHAT DID YOU SAY?!"
Bucky and Peter click in less of a minute and have their special handshake by the second hour they're there.
Steve sighed, his own smile sad and barely there. "Would you believe me if said I didn't show up because I couldn't fit into my Pa's suit?"
Why does it matter if we're being unfair to the other kids? If we're not treating them equally like we do more  'important' students? I mean, it's not like they can actually DO something or speak up since we will side with money anyway, isn't it?"
Concern crawls inside him regardless of how many times he buries it, makes a tangly nest right in his chest, and makes no effort to move. He doesn't blame Steve for not wanting to meet him, to look at him, to give him the chance of staring into the bright, baby blue eyes that hold everything beautiful in the world.
“Welcome,” a voice says from overhead. There is nothing in it that sparks a sense of recognition in the current occupants of the room. It is nothing like the voice of JARVIS, their old companion, welcoming them all by name. It doesn’t even have the cheerful Irish lilt, the one that sent a pang through Steve’s chest as he remembered smoke-filled living rooms and gossip by a clothesline, that they had become accustomed to in the months after their disastrous sojourn in Sokovia.
Here’s Tony’s chance to prove it to himself, and, well. He’s a futurist. Despite his front of being a realist, Tony has always been nothing short of a hopeless optimist.
questions just fine, but he refused to even look at Steve. He couldn’t even be upset enough to say that he didn’t understand why his friend was so upset. Tony might not have known him for long, they had been together a little over a year, but Bucky and Tony had gotten along like a house on fire from the start. Steve had thought there would be some animosity there; Bucky was protective and Tony was so, so insecure sometimes and Steve’s relationship with his best friend was anything but conventional. His fears had been unfounded, however, as Tony’s naturally shy nature had had Bucky’s protective instincts flaring. It had been a good friendship, and Steve hates himself for putting both of them in the position they’re in.
, and I hurt you. I will never be done atoning for what I did.” Steve shook his head, and the hold on the mechanic’s fingers tightened. “If this is the last shot I have, then I want you to know that I will never be able to tell you how damn sorry I am for how I hurt you. What I said in that letter still, and will
This is probably as much of Wanda as I will probably write. It was the hardest thing to not go super bitchy to/about her.
The bitter part snaps back. Tony suppresses the urge to giggle nervously. Maybe he should talk to a professional about these boxes he has in his head, you know, in case he steps out of the “eccentric” and into the “raving lunatic” category.
“I swear it!” Steve says after they’ve both caught their breath. “She’d say it was for ma own good, but I dunno ‘bout that seeing as she was very, uh, diligent about it. That woman had one heck of a hearin’ though,” the blond says fondly. Tony has noted that his accent thickens when he’s talking about his Ma, as he calls her, still. “I’m half convinced the only reason mine’s so good ‘s ‘cause’a her.”
Being back in Brooklyn feels weird, even three years after his comeback, even though Steve desperately wishes it didn’t. Going out on his morning runs feels different now without the foggy, balmy air he had grown accustomed to in the last few years. The first year back, he’d had to remind himself every morning that his routine had undergone a change. He wouldn’t find the foggy air of London anymore, he wouldn’t go out and meet Peggy for an early morning coffee or get to the gallery or go down to the pub every other afternoon hoping to catch a glimpse at the news he doesn’t allow himself to seek anymore.
“Sure,” Rhodes says just as Hogan opens his mouth. Happy gives the colonel a sharp glare but Rhodes keeps his eyes on Steve. The blond can’t miss the sharp grin on his face and he swallows. Well, then. He figures he’s long overdue on this chat, anyway.
“Meh, you know me. I just get this need to express myself,” he winks at her and she wrinkles her nose up at him though he knows her well enough to see the amusement in her eyes.
Once in the car, he leaned back against the seat and let out a gusty sigh. He tried to block the reporters out, but suddenly it seemed that they had begun to chant the same thing. He knew it was his mind playing tricks on him, but he still couldn’t help listening to it. it had been the same question he had been making himself since it all happened. It was the reason he couldn’t look himself in the eye anymore.
“She would have hated it,” he says it so quietly it almost gets drowned out by the rustling leaves. Steve turns to look at him, to show that he, for once, is listening. It’s about damn time he starts. “It’s so… ostentatious. She would have despised all of this,” he waves vaguely at the tomb. “I let her down, even after she died, I still kept letting her down.”
, but he’d heard this sound before. This fake, broken laughter Tony sometimes did when he couldn’t handle what was going on around him. He’d heard it back with Ultron, once, and shortly after they came back.
Steve turns to Wanda, notices the crestfallen expression on her face, and Vision’s disapproving look into the pot he’s stirring, and falls silent. So much for hoping, it seems. He continues to feed the baby in silence, finding comfort in the way Nate trusts him to keep him safe, and tries not to think about what had just happened. A big part of him wants to take Wanda aside and have a chat with her, but he knows that she’s feeling guilty enough as it is. Maybe not about Tony, and he feels his hackles rising at the thought, but about making the boys uncomfortable. He makes a mental note to try to talk to her at a later date.
“You defended the accords,” Cooper says stubbornly. Tony closes his eyes in shame, and the boy sits back to look up at him better, though he doesn’t pull away. “You thought they could work, and you still protected us. You came to get us before the bad people did, mom said so. You were for the accords, but you didn’t pick sides.”
picture if it had been worth it. If breaking the family that they had so painstakingly put together apart had been worth what they were going through now. Wherever he was.
Two years after their breakup, Tony is hospitalized under mysterious circumstances. Steve had had the near heart attack of one of his kidnappings three months prior, then another year and a half before that, and then right after their split. Those had always been scrutinized by the news and gossip rags. Those times there had been plenty of information and multiple SI press releases. It never got easier; Steve was still as terrified on the latest one as he had been the first time. In his darkest, most selfish moments, he’s incredibly grateful they had never happened when they were dating. He doesn’t know how they might have dealt with that.
But they’d done it, and he was damn proud of them for doing so. T’Challa shouldered his way past the reporters, and Rhodey shoved him none too gently towards the car. He could still hear them hollering, and all he wanted to do was curl up on himself for a minute and put his head between his knees. He just needed to find a way to
So the secrecy is new, and it sits heavily in Steve’s gut. Bucky had been the first one to point it out one night when he and Sam had come over to Steve’s new dwellings. The apartment by Fort Green Park wasn’t big, to say the least, but it had been within his budget and there was decent enough lighting and inspiration for him to do his art (professionally and his freelance work.) Both of them had given Steve pitying looks when he tried to explain his reasons for moving, citing their budding relationship and need for privacy, but he knew they weren’t fooled. He was never any good at lying to himself.
“To check on my friend,” he says, voice cold. His coat isn’t even on before the door is slamming shut with enough force to rattle the walls.
. I understand,” he says softly and now he’s crying. Tony stares up at him in morbid fascination; he can’t tear his eyes away. “It destroys me inside to see you so—
Steve stays silent, listening, trying to keep his hands from shaking. Bucky tells them all of this in a flat voice, but they all know that he’s feeling his heart breaking over this too. Tony hadn’t only been his, Steve knows, he had wormed himself into their little tight knit trio and now they all felt his absence like an open wound.
So he avoids T’Challa until the last possible second, but makes sure that he is cordial to him when they have to confer. He keeps the skepticism he feels about this meeting to himself, though he guesses the king knows. It’s all the same, Tony supposes, seeing as T’Challa thinks he can keep his guests from Tony in return. They exchange quick last minute instructions for each other, and then they are being escorted into the latest UN meetings about the accords.
, was a shot at not having the same regrets about the Captain as he did about his father. His whole life since their passing, Tony had wished for a shot to tell them the truth. That they had shattered and damaged him beyond help; that every word Howard said in derision for his only son had left a mark far deeper than the signet ring that had hit Tony in more than one occasion. He’d wanted, for years, to tell his mother that kissing the places Howard had hit in hopes of making things better had never helped. Tony had too many regret, his parents, Obie, Ty, Pepper…
He stands there for a while, breathing in the ever present smell of grease and Tony’s expensive cologne, and lets the sense of
He pushes one foot in front of the other as he walks to the edge of the platform he is suspended on. He has to guide his scans through extremis now, without FRIDAY’s help, and he has never felt more grateful for the curse of his ever-sprinting mind than he does in that moment. It’s easier to compartmentalize the panic and the fear when has so much to run and observe and calculate.
that, but it still feels as though it’s my job to keep her safe, but… there are so many choices I’ve made that just ended up taking her in a more destructive path. That’s on me.”
“I’m so sorry, Peggy,” he’d breathed out. His training on consent and sexual harassment immediately kicking in. he should have asked first, damn it. “I should have asked if you were all right with me kissing you. It’s just—I’ve been—I just mean, I—”
that had gone when he’d tried in the past. “Now, go do your homework. I don’t need want to take the shop away, but I’ll have to unless I want your mother breaking down my door. Especially if it’s for something as easy as geography.”
sorry. You deserved better than what I gave you. Even if we didn’t talk much, or we weren’t as close as me and Cap, you deserved more credit that what I gave you. I don’t know what happened in Siberia, but I know it’s bad. And if Cap hasn’t told me about it, then I know it’s pretty bad, but I also know,” he says and bends his head when Tony tries to drop eye contact. “I also know, that if he
It gets worse from there, and even though weeks and months and years pass, the tide of grief doesn’t abate for Steve. He knows, logically, that he can’t blame himself for the choices Tony is making. How he chooses to deal with his emotions. Yet pain and heartbreak aren’t logical, and in the darkest hours of the night when he can’t sleep and Sam isn’t there to talk him off the ledge he asks himself what he would do if Tony made as choice he couldn’t take back. He wonders who is there to keep Tony from his.
Tony has never cried in the whole year and a half they have been together. Not once. Not when his butler/dad figure had been sick. Not that horrible spring break with Mr. Stark in the house. Not after his god-knows-how-many kidnappings. Not once. And here he is, tears pulling in his eyes and clumping in his eyelashes in the frigid winter air. Steve wants to double over with the pain that hits his chest, but he can’t. He
Naturally, Tony's supposedly genius mind chooses to glitch at the moment he intended to dish a smartass quip or witty one liner,  all he give is a small, high pitched "Huh? "
His mind torments him by showcasing Rhodey yelling in Sam's face and Sam yelling back, both standing their ground like two soldiers on a mission and defending their friends like avenging angels. Rhodey is more brother than friend, he'd take his side, like the devoted man he always proved himself to be, but he watches with a cut breath as Rhodey locks himself in his room and weeps.
Quietly, Steve took the smaller man's hands into his own, lacing their fingers together. Tony gasped slightly at the tender gesture, but didn't pull back or encouraged Steve to let him go. Steve took that as permission to go on.
"Not dumb. Just taking your own pace, " Tony chuckled. "So... All this time, you didn't contact me because you thought I was with Hammer? " His nose wrinkled in disgust just thinking about it, an expression Steve mirrored.
His breath is knocked out of his lungs in a silent punch, eardrums pushing out all the sound attempting to penetrate his ears. His fingers loosen so much they almost drop his water, feeling tingly numb. Tony's eyes, large and surprised, trace the circle of gold curled around Steve's fourth finger, gleaming softly against the artificial light around the dining room.
But Life decides to do what it always does when Tony finds something good. It takes, and it takes, until there's nothing.
"Look. I called it off, alright? I lit up the matches, I burned down the bridge, and I watched it turn to ash.  But it was meant to happen, one way or another. We were just too different. Guys like me break the world apart. Men like Steve put it back together. He'll move forward. Like he always does."
"No. I was just? Too chickenshit to face you, after everything. Honestly, I thought you hated my guts, which, who could blame you, but... I couldn't have handled that. So I stayed away." A self-deprecating snort accompanied a shake of head. "Guess all these extra inches are wasted, huh?"
Who, now, was smiling brightly down at him with a small but prominent blush dusting his fair features. Tony pouted, not missing the way Steve tracked the movement. "God. Did they give you Popeye's canned spinach in the army, or something? Who let you be this tall?"
The cab stopped, making Steve finally break the ice "So, uh," he shrugged helplessly, as he gestured to the building. "This is us, I guess. Pleasure masking business with you, kid."
So when Steve misses their son's 5th birthday party because he had more pressing business in D.C, Tony realizes bitterly, there's no saving this. People labeled him as a mechanic, a futurist, but he feels unworthy of both when he couldn't fix or foresee this.
Tony's always been good at hurting himself. The more pain he inflicts on himself, the less it'll hurt when someone else does it. So he unpacks the stash of letters he kept locked away in a seif, because they're prized to him, more than any sleek car or company, and reads them before he burns the bridge.
Tony was young, but he was never a child. He was naive, gullible, innocent, - but he was awake. While he didn't clearly understand what love was, he looked at the unhappy frowns on the miserable faces of the pair and thought: 'If that's how love looks like I want no part in it.'
He thought he'd feel vindication at seeing Steve taste a fraction of his pain, that his destroyed look would make something in Tony retaliate. It does nothing. Tony only loves him stronger, fiercer, and there's no win here for anyone.
"Stark, relationships need more than one person. Stevie ain't exactly blameless in this whole thing, - Far from it, trust me, I let that punk know. He got the scoldin' of the damn lifetime, because he threw away a damn good thing. He made a home for himself and then demolished it. You didn't hand him the sledgehammer, he picked it up on his own dumb self."
- Steve you had a job since you were 15! You helped paying bills even if you shouldn't have, because you wanted to help your parents. What's embarrassing about that? Do you really think I give a fuck about how much money you made?"
Their love is like rain in June. It's mellow and distractingly peaceful, makes their worry and everything that ever went wrong scarce away. They can breathe around each other even when they feel like drowning. For once, Tony feels like it'll be okay.
Why Tony bought a new apartment and they had to move away, stretching the distance between them and Steve.
Steve listened. Steve nodded. And Steve cried. One trembling hand wiped at wet eyes, and Tony resisted the urge to take his hand back and press comforting pecks on it.
"You ain't seen aggressive yet. And trust me when I say you don't want to," spoke lowly Steve, fixating Stone with a stare so cold and dark it made the teacher take a step and cause Pietro to stop in his tracks. He never heard that tone from him before. "And it's Mr. Maximoff to you."
Natasha doesn't voice it, but she doesn't need to. She tucks her phone away after a third failed attempt to coax, threaten, and guilt Steve into joining them, with muted movements, and Tony can tell she agrees.
The noise Steve makes when Tony breaches his mouth with his tongue, an invitation for further mind-melting kisses, it's so sweet Tony can taste it. He savors it, burns it in his mind, and is hellbent on making more noises of that variety. The taller man's knees buckle, like he's the one being kissed senseless, as if they're lovers who meet lips for the last time.
"Missed you, " Steve's voice is thick with want, hitching in the small puffs of air that came off raggedy and breathless, words melting over Tony's mouth. Steve's face glows with a blush he wants to kiss with inhuman greed. "I missed you, I missed you, Tony I
"Talk?" Tony rasps, pushes the words out of his constricted throat that seems to close more and more, synchronizing with his lungs. Sam's wide, concerned eyes tells him the surface looked as bad as the inside."You... You and Rhodey, you guys- Bad talk? You, you fought about it?"
It had hurt terribly, back then, when he was young and deadset on letting the anger stew in him, but as the years stacked on top of each other he learned to move on, and the little grudge he held for his high school sweetheart turned into a curiosity, declining  from a stab of pain to a subdued aching.
" I also assume you will call Eugene's father and let him know about what happened. Needless to say his son will get punished just like Pietro, yes? It wouldn't be fair to just punish one student when both of them were involved, would it?"
"It's nothing, -" Because it really is. Considering the sins to his name, the least he can do to atone some mistakes is make as many people as happy as he can. And Happy is a great look on Steve.
The other man laughed "Oh, that's not good, " he extended his hand, giving Tony a smile that made him weak in the knees "I'm Steve. Wanna sit down and tell me horror stories about disgusting food orders?"
"You know, your philosophy lesson would impact me better with wizard lingo. Throw in a riddle or a prophecy and I might bite. " Receiving a blank stare to his quip, Tony sighed, eyes downcast.
Sam's always been frustratingly talented at deciphering his thoughts, even when his face is emotionless. It's one of the many reasons why Tony thinks him and Rhodey match so well. "He said he's really sorry he couldn't come, but... Okay, his excuse is just sad, because I doubt you'd believe he'd rather attend  a Zoomba class than see you and Peter. Truth is, he's scared."
It's unbearably infuriating how the staff acts like everything is normal, ignoring how the kids were obviously unhappy and in need of care, as they lead him to the room where Pietro and Wanda were.
"Mmm. Try again. I mean, that's a Sunday for me, but he's already heard that talk before." Giggles are shared between the pair on the couch, snuggled under fuzzy blankets with wine glasses that clink slightly. Pepper's face relaxes into something sympathetic, earnest. "Was it something Peter related?"
"Don't mind if I do, sir," Steve smiled, sitting on a chair while Pietro remained on his feet, hands in the pockets of his hoodie as he waited for the whole charade to be over. "I know my son can be quite the rascal sometimes, but he means no harm, I assure you. What did he do this time?"
He wonders if it'll keep Steve up at night, how it never occurred to him that the danger he always wanted to protect Tony from might wear his face.
as good as you did. I didn't give a shit what the world had to say about it. Between the world and you, I pick you. I'll always pick you."
He doesn't leave Tony's side, arm snug and comfortable around his middle like they've known each other for longer than time itself, and Tony loves it more than he has the courage to admit. Steve's laugh is like a melody, rich and hearty, and what poets write masterpieces out of. His words pull Tony in like a honeytrap. Nothing else exits for him when Steve is there.
"I am 100℅ sure you're gonna poison me," he said drily, finally making Pietro snort. ", but I'll take the risk. Lead the way, kiddo."
Tony's hand rests over the man's broad chest. Steve's heartbeat is singing loudly, at the brink of being audible from his spot. The pounding is even more relentless under his hand, as if Steve's heart wants to escape it's clutches and take Tony for itself, to kiss him, take him away where only him knows.
Steve's mouth twists into an imitation of a smile, tries his luck at mimicking something  of the reassurance and ease variety, to hide his emotions with a mask of cracked serenity Tony undressed a million times, just as Steve undressed his. He's always been good at reading his husband. Or, was.
"I ruined your marriage. There ain't  forgiving that, but I DO regret it and you'll damn well listen to what I have to say."
Tony takes his tiny hand in his own, leaning down to press kisses on the back of his son's palm, apology on his lips. "Yeah, baby. He has to come and pick up his stuff. Maybe you can play a little when he arrives! I'm sure he'll be happy to see you. "
A discreet smile sketches Natasha's features, exhibiting confidence but betraying relief. She loves them both, Tony knows, and wants her friends first, not the fallen lovers. "Just wanted to know if I should hide the sharp knives or prepare some spare sheets."
He's morbidly curious, in a way, to see what was so special about Bucky that it made Steve want to trade that.
"Throw those away, Tony, " he says, voice edged with the kind of suffering it would bring Tony to his knees. "Get them the hell away from me and never bring them up again, you hear? I'm serious.''
Sam huffs. "Man, I've been involved with your shit for a while. Appreciate the feeling but it's a bit late for that. Trust me, me and Rhodey have in length discussions about it. I'm neck-deep in white boy drama, but well, sacrifices of the job.  Not much you can do."
His parents had done it more times than he cared to count. The frigid silences and artificial prompt politeness between the socialite power couple Howard and Maria Stark could last for two days, or two months, years, depending on how deep the issue picked out that time ran.
After an hour or so of chasing, where Tony had to stop two times because damn the kid with silver hair was fast, they barge into an old orphanage. It was obvious the building's seen better days, if the paint peeling off the cracked walls and broken windows covered with rotten planks was anything to go by.
"Stone, I'm speaking to my son. Don't interrupt me again." Steve's glare was enough to make Stone snap his mouth shut, not daring to mutter another thing. "Also if I may, using the term 'savage' to describe another student is incredibly disrespectful, not to mention inappropriate, and I'll make sure Ms. Hill will hear about it."
In his luck, Stone was new to the school, replacing the former science teacher who thought was a good idea to keep some girls after class for 'supplementary lessons' and forgot about the security cameras that spied every classroom, so he easily believed Pietro's lie.
Tony would will himself to shove this under the rug. To put a blind eye to it, to make it work, to ignore Rhodey's disapproval and Pepper's warm worry, to push away the pain blossoming in his chest, threatening to overspill.
"Then perish, " the boy scoffed, taking a seat next to her, stealing away the brownie as he took Peter into his arms, settling his baby brother on his lap, ignoring the drool spilling on his arm. "Come on sis, contribute! Come up with ideas! Help me! Do something! You're the brain of this operation!"
"Dad, don't look now, but that blonde over there has been checking you out for the past hour or so, " Wanda whispered to him with a smile on her face, gesturing to a blonde man drawing in a corner. Their eyes met for a brief second before he moved his eyes away in a flash, red dusting his cheeks and neck.
"...ony! Tony, deep breaths, come on, " gentle hands guide him away from the void his own psyche trapped him into, speaking in a low voice that plucks him back up little by little. "Come on, in and out. Focus on my voice, that's good. Listen to me, Rhodey and I did not and will not fight about this. We're fine, Tony, promise! We agreed, no side pickers. This isn't war, and we won't get into some life or death fight for your and/or Steve's honor, " he tries for a little grin. ''I mean, I'm not supposed to tell you, but we don't like you guys that much."
He wants no piece of "love" . He refuses to be the caged bird his mother was, to take form in the monster Howard let himself become.
Tony's limbs move mechanically, on autopilot, running to the nearest room, getting himself away from what his body detects as danger. Urgency is packed on his step, taking him to the bathroom in record time, but Steve's always been the runner, more athletic between them, and his sprinting lands him a spot in the sleat Tony was about to slam.
Instead, Tony reaches for his back pocket, and squeezes his ring. It burns in his palm, almost begging him to put it back in it's place, or on his finger, where it fitted like it always belonged. His being feels it, as if connected, and he decides to even the odds in the cowardice department.
He's building up nerve, Tony can see that much, and right when he thinks he'd lose it, that they'd part again, Steve pulled him against his chest and pressed light kisses on top of Tony's head. It felt like pieces of love. "We're going to go on a date, " Steve murmured, voice hoarse. " and I'm going to give you the night I should've given you years ago. I'll give you the fairy tale, baby."
Later, he sees Steve stand in flash before him, chatting with some faceless figures, hair longer than last time and flattened slightly at the nape, sporting a beard that framed his gorgeous face perfectly. The impeccable balance between scruffy and well-groomed. Tony itched to run his fingers against it.
Steve pauses, head pulled back for a second. Rebel hamstrings all on his red face, now coated with a thin layer of sweat, and looks at him with such plea that Tony is sure he would do anything for him.
"Steve said you can keep those, if you want," that sentence made Tony hunch his shoulders, releasing that bitter aftertaste in his mouth again, blending with something sweet, and igniting the warmth that pierced as deep as his very marrow. "Nothing he loves or wants back is in those boxes."
Tony listens and he pictures Rhodey falling. Steve loved Bucky in ways he couldn't even hope to understand.
Tony doesn't think anyone has the right to judge or blame him. This is Steve, the same little spitfire with heroic streak miles wide from the North pole that could barely touch shoulders with him in their youth. With
A trail of question rests blistering on his tongue. 'What happened? Who did that? Who were you fighting? Why? Are you okay? Did you win?' But he closes his eyes and bites his tongue, knowing these questions don't belong to him anymore.
Steve looks at him when the epilogue of the night strikes, too soon for either of their likings. He's tall, broad-shouldered, strong but has the softest eyes in the world. It hurts Tony to arch his neck to stare, but he doesn't want to miss a thing. "I've... I didn't laugh like that since I was in tour. You made my night, Tony."
"I tried, " he sobs in Sam's neck, sobs his demise his failure, his bottled cocktail of emotions that waited to implode. "I
mess, " Tony corrects, hating how easily he falls into conversation with him. He tells himself it's merely a distraction from the stomach twisting smell of medicine, stingy and sharp smothering his senses. "How offensive. I demand a trial by combat. Peter, make him pay in blood!"
It's pure desperation conveyed in the most ravaging way. Steve pounces on him, lips wild against Tony's own, pouring every emotion he went through in the past few months,- Longing, yearning, craving, hunger, desire, - his being, his love, his soul into that kiss, barely giving Tony the chance to breathe.
"Yeah. You know, where blood usually is, " Bucky snarks, heatless, propping Peter off from the spot on his leg and putting him on the ground . "Why don't you go ask nurse Joy to give you some magnets for the arm? Your father and I gotta talk adult business."
If he called Tony, he'll get grounded for sure. After countless times his adoptive father had to leave his workplace because of Pietro's mischievousness, Tony firmly warned him that if he received one more call from the school, Pietro will be stuck at home babysitting Peter and do chores for a whole month.
He doesn't understand why suddenly there's only two people there instead of three, why he isn't woken up by two pairs of arms tickling him and kissing his sleepy eyelids every morning, why Tony's laughter isn't echoing through the house as Steve spins and twists him around in the living room dance session they had at least once a week.
"Please, dad?" Wanda chimed in. "he's so cute! And I might finally have the servant Pietro was supposed to be!"
"Wow, " he mutters, clearing his throat so the break in his words is less noticeable, asaa last-minute attempt to dignify himself. "Well, it's a good thing the boldness remained intact. I always did say it'll get you in trouble, but it was also my favorite thing about you, so I can't really complain."
, but I still went ahead and - God, I'm so sorry sweetheart. " Laughter deeming, a pinched but guilty expression taking its place. " I... I at least hope Hammer treated you half right. It's more than I ever did, -"
Steve stares and says nothing for a prolonged moment, content to look at Tony as if he's falling in love all over again. It makes Tony hopeful, fills him with something warm he didn't think he'd want to indulge again.
And in others, time goes by in blink record, not keen on giving Tony the courtesy of healing, of moving on, of according him the patience or kindness in adapting his feelings to his pace, to accommodate to the arrangement it dragged him in.
"Exactly. So, if it's not too much trouble, " his timidity compliments Tony's smitten well. "Would you mind making me smile again?"
He feels seething, scalding guilt showering him for thinking that. Because Steve is not his to worry over, not his to call wonderful, not his to care for. Not anymore. He repeats that like a mantra against his eardrum when Natasha asks him if it's fine if she invites him to her party, too.
Steve doesn't agree. He looks sickened, struck even, at Tony for having the gall to suggest maybe Barnes would be more responsive if he talked with someone who had mirroring experiences.  "God, Tony, you don't... You're not a soldier. You're just a man. You've been through pain, sure, but not like Bucky. No one went through what he did. I'm honestly speechless you ever thought you could compare."
Rhodey holds back a laugh, but the way he bites the inside of his cheek gives him away. "You've been holding Steve's face for like 10 minutes now."
Tony laughs, at once, a pathetically small sound, but he's grounded enough to laugh. He basks in the lack of sound around them, like the silence of an after battle, suffocating, but free.
Tony thinks about Steve, with his frail fists drenched in blood from split knuckles, fighting back against bullies who thought they could walk all over him or others, with his loud voice battling ignorant, hateful ideas, against big foes and bigger, and he says: "You were tall back then, too."
"Apple pie and hot chocolate, right? Interesting combo, If I do say so myself, " Tony commented with a small chuckle. The blue-eyed man finally looked up. Tony could get lost in the sea of his eyes, as cliche as that sounds.
Tony blinks, hastily, and speaks before he can even register what he's saying. "No, you don't. Drop it." It comes off razor sharp, yet Bucky must be used to worse, because he doesn't falter.
Tony smiles in the chest, nose taking in the scent he missed so much, listens to the heartbeat whose pattern he could still remember, still knows as well as his mind. " You get the story. Leave the happy ending to me."
His fists are bruised, Tony notes with a wince as he gets drunk on Steve's form with a studious gaze, creamy skin battered and laced in a pattern of dark purple, crimson, and small patches of yellow shaping his knucklebones.
He knows being followed with unkind eyes, subtly (not so) trying to make it seem like they're busy in the area he was at. But it was obvious they expected him to snatch something and dash out of the store without a second thought. Their behavior made Tony feel helpless, unwelcomed, and inferior, like someone like him had no place in a place like that.
"Um, 'that' is a he, and his name is Peter! Can we keep him, dad? I want to steal his allowance and birthday presents. And stick his dirty diapers in Wanda's mouth when she's sleeping."
He chases after them of course, not with the intention of dragging them to the police or give slapping them a new one like Howard would've done. Not for something as simple as pies. But he well knows he wouldn't have taken if they stole money, either.
"And you promised to love me until the day we die, but by the looks of it we both could use a lesson in honesty, " Tony cuts icily, colder than colder. His words are resigned, hollow, at the brim of mechanical. He thinks all the people who say Starks are more machine than men had a point. "I'm the fuck up in this relationship. What's
He learns to measure the gravity of their squabbles, - If it was a small argument, Maria picked Germany, France, or Spain. She sends a letter stating the duration of her stay,  sends Tony well wishes, with a touch too formal for a mother, with her name elegantly plastered on the bottom in cursive, scribbled onto below a hasty written "Mom."
"I regret to say that your son has quite the record, Mr. Maximoff, " with a disapproving shake of head, Stone glared in his direction and Pietro had to hold himself back from rolling his eyes so hard they'd pop out of his head.
Tony was comforted by the warmth of Rhodey's couch and his arms when his father died. Even more comforted when he discovered his mother left him her family's bakery, as if she could foresee this all happening. Distant as she was, no mother wants her children on the street. And well, Tony had always enjoyed baking, and if it meant he'd stop leeching off his best friend, he took the first chance.
Carefully, Natasha chimes in, tone mild and neutral. " Steve. Tony would like to speak with you about something, alright? Let's sit down, and talk like grown-ups, -"
"Nat, " Tony pleads, choosing not to look at the tremor in his hands as he neats the papers he wants to see burn. "There's no need for that, come on. You know I love you, but I'm a big boy. I don't need you to hold my hand for this."
When Howard fucked up, she picked China, Britain, or Italy, and she disappeared from the earth until she emerged at her like. Howard is Howard, - the relationship between him and his son was too cold for Tony to tell how his father was like without the constant disdain gleaming in his eyes, but the liquor cabinet always needed at least a daily refill after a spectacular drama.
The quiet hangs in the air as they load the truck, too, not oppressing, but welcomed, with a touch of comfort that burns just right. When the last box is secured and road-ready, him and Sam stay just a bit on the porch to stare at the house. Because that's what it is, isn't?
He just knows that this one, this Captain, decorated to the teeth, hiding in awkwardness at this petty mingling, social climbing Gala, lowering himself at the bar because he didn't know anybody, was made for him. And if Steve clings to Tony the whole night, he agrees with the parallel drawing out on his part.
Tony sighed in the inside, anticipating this moment. He would've been more affected, probably, if that hadn't been the precise motivation that lead to him attending the event. He never had the chance to question Steve's change of heart as he enlisted as soon as he could, without as much as a peek back and no word of goodbye for Tony.
The duo was on the floor, scarfing down the pie they grabbed with two other kids, younger than them, Tony noted. The twins noticed he was there, but their eyes were downcasted on the ground, refusing to look at him.
He learned their names when they were practically spat by the director, and that they were Sokovian refugees, sent to America by parents who didn't want their children to bask in the violence and bloodshed of war. The room the twins lived was small, two bunk beds and a single closet.
"Every time you flap your lips another one of my brain cells dies and  I crave for death, you absolute disaster."
After a pregnant pause, Steve found himself surprised when Pietro asked him if he wanted to have dinner with them. There was no mockery or cutting hostility in his tone like there usually was. Steve would lie if he'd say the invitation didn't caught him by surprise, even made him worry further a bit, but nevertheless, he said:
His bitterness aside, Tony marvels at how similar they are. Maybe In another life, he and Barnes would've made a handsome pair of kindred souls.
Tony laughs, too loving and too fond for this predicament. "I said you'd drag his ass through every courtroom in America and drain him of everything he's worth?"
Tony giggled. '' You're still shit at lying. Steve, " his own tone softened slightly, squeezing Steve's large hands, rough skinned with callouses, but still comforting. "Just tell me."
Hand landing harshly on Steve's shoulder, Pietro's smile was forced and painful on his face as he turned to his science teacher whom he HAD to piss off that day with one of his usual acting up sessions, as he liked to call every time Pietro pulled his daily shenanigans.
He's pinned to a wall effective immediately, feels cold tiles plant clammy kisses on the back of his head and neck. Tony almost hisses at the force of the slam, but before he can make a peep, his lips stolen in a savage, fierce kiss.
"Divorce is a special kind of pain. It's like death without a body, " is what they say when two halves of a whole heart separate.
Tony adds to another thing he learned that night: When Steve says something, it stays how Steve says it. "No, its everything, Tony. I didn't smile once since coming home, " he croaks, like the confession pains him, and Tony aches alongside him. "Everyone is worried about me, saying that, that I seem upset, or sad, or just, never happy anymore, but how else am I supposed to feel?"
A theatrical gasps spreads in the room from the blue eyed brunette. Tony beams, kissing Peter's cheek. "That's my boy. I'm sure Bucky's bleeding a lot on the inside."
says that, it's why it hurts so bad. The man who swore he'd walk back into the hellfire of war just to find the people who hurt Tony and tear them apart.
His feelings for Steve remained as strong as they were since the blonde asked him on their first date, which, he realized was more than pitiful, still harboring emotions for something as little as High School romance, for someone who most likely moved on.
It's the perfect excuse to see how he's doing, but Tony elects to ignore that and remind Natasha grown-ass people don't ask other grown-ass people for permission on what to do. "Do I look like Pepper to you? No? Then why would I order you around?"
"Tony, " Rhodey had that barely restrain amusement clinging to his tone, the familiar note he had whenever Tony was being his trademark ridiculous self and he was getting a great kick out of it, but Tony was too preoccupied with oogling Steve to care. "Either kiss the poor guy or let him go."
Sam ponders if he should give in to Tony's insistence at wanting to know for how long he's been wearing it. "For long enough. "
"What's, " He started after a moment of silence, pointing at the crying babe in his son's arm "that?"
"Mr. Maximoff, I'm afraid that it'd  taint  Flash's record if we involve him in this incident and Mr. Thompson wouldn't be pleased with that--, "
"He'd probably die because he would not hesitate to fight you, " a small smile graced Tony's lips, feeling more real than he felt comfortable with. "Can I just... Ask why? I mean, you don't owe me an explanation or anything, we were kids, it's not that big of a deal, but I mean... If I did something, I'd like to at least know.''
"I won't do that anymore. I, - Do you want me to be at home more? I can, sweetheart, I can do that no problem. I can be at home, I can make time for dates and-and for activities, I can take Peter to the park and play ball, - Do you remember that? How we used to play until he fell asleep? I don't mind, its no problem, -"
He couldn't afford being grounded as he was invited to Harry Osborn's party which everyone will attend and he knew for a fact not a single person will shrug off his absence. If he missed this event, Pietro was going to be the main gossip material for who knows how long. Normally, he wouldn't mind a bit of attention here and there, but Pietro just knew he was going to be more annoyed by their whispers as time went by, and he didn't want to deal with it.
is not going to be a burden on anybody. I can put up with a lot of shit, but Peter is my limit. I can't and I won't put anyone above him. Not even you."
But Steve always had a more timid side to him, one that Tony loved as well, something very gracious and modest only men with old souls have, and he could still spot it now by how Steve ducked his head then as it did years ago. His younger self shined through his actions and it was more than endearing.
"Yeah, well, he's already got that job done on the to do list, " Tony huffs, petty and aware. He tosses Peter his baseball that lands in the backyard, gently nudging him away from the conversation. They watch the ball of energy squeal in delight as he runs to fetch it, tension momentarily on hold. "Sorry. You don't need my shit.  Let's just load this and be done with it."
The best way to show the displeasure of his son refusing to take over the company was to disown him, kick him out, and leave him homeless, by Howard Stark's opinion. An opinion he carried when he kicked the bucket and when they lowered him into the grave.
The facility hosting Bucky is uncomfortably pristine, from door corner to ceiling. Everything is tailored and arranged with ridiculous precision, clinical, professional, boring, and detached, as most medical spaces are. His workshop dances circles around it in the personality field, and he tells Bucky as such.
He looked at it from a small perspective belonging to a small person, as if the people in question were just two good friends who couldn't decide on what game to play, hurt each other, and needed space.
But he needed to know, even when knowing it wouldn't do much to squash the crush that gradually blossomed into something... More. On his part, at least.
Tony forced a smile on his lips and shrugged, taking his hands back so he could play with the warm amber of his whiskey glass, promptly ignoring the saddened shade taking home in Steve's look. "No hard feelings, Captain Crunch. If I wasn't trapped in this objectively hot body, I'd ditch myself too."
Time jumps from slow to fast, alters between stagnation and overwhelming in the first 6 months that pass after the finalization of their parting. Some days are agonizingly slow. As if the world wants him to stomach every second, consume every minute, where Steve is not with him, isn't his anymore, and choke on the pain that tastes just as sharp as the first time.
Huh. It's true, Tony realizes, as if he can only now see the pair of warm blue eyes looking down at him, shadowed with a fondness that makes his heart stop for a good second. His hands are cupping Steve's grinning face, and tries not to blush at how Steve nuzzled into his palm, not at all inadequated by the predicament he's in. "I'm good here, actually."
Turning to his kids to see what they thought about it, he got a thumbs up from Wanda and some clapping from Peter. In the meantime, Pietro shrugged, not taking his piercing eyes off Steve, but he softened, shrugging his shoulders.
Sam curls his hand around the ring, pockets it, and Tony wrestles with the urge to snatch it back. His eyes are trained to the floor, on his shoes, the fine leather ones Steve bought for him on their anniversary, he realizes.
"St-Steve, " He gasps, head tilting slightly to the side to escape the ministrations, to gulp air, moving to avoid the chase at reconnection Steve is playing at by trying to capture his lips again. "Wait, wait a minute, Steve, -"
Tony wants to go there, uncaring of consequence, and jump into his arms and protect him from everything. But fear battles love. And love is losing.
