Internally grateful, Steve leaned back comfortably in his chair as Tony tried coming up with words. Tony’s mouth would open and close a few times. He gave out a particular frustrated sigh as he couldn’t figure out how to respond.
Tony passed a few headstones, if you could even call it that. It was just like mounds of misshapen grass with a stone placed haggardly in its place. Tony continued walking amongst the similar burial sites, until he reached the one he wanted.
Ryder’s face grew enflamed with anger. “And then you’re kissing Bruce on the cheek and hugging him like he’s your long lost lover from war. When I, your boyfriend surprises you, you barely even react.”
“Her progress will be monitored. You may have daily check-ins and will be alerted to our location every 24 hours. Wanda will not be required to do anything she is uncomfortable with, but know this Steve she needs to control her powers. You will not be doing her a great service, if you allow her not to be trained.”
“Mr. Stark no offense because I totally appreciate everything you’ve done for me and like you’re super cool, but I’m not stopping. I can’t take a break. I have a responsibility and,” Peter’s sentence trailed off. Peter paused and looked straight ahead. “Look I just can’t.”
But quite possibly, the more days spent like this surrounded by the people he loved this fear would diminish. And he was looking forward to seeing the others come to the Tower. He had always promised Karen and the children there that they would visit.
Peter rolled his eyes. “MJ don’t be jealous okay. It’s not my fault that you were clearly not born as fabulous as me. Maybe one day I can teach you.”
“But he does that,” Pepper stressed. “He does that all the time. I mean we’ve gotten better at knowing, when he gets to the point where he can’t bottle things up anymore. But I want to make sure he doesn’t get to that point where it comes out like a storm, you know? I want to protect him from that.”
She leaned close to him and whispered, “Ryder took it off of you when you were unconscious. He used your fingerprint to take it off.”
Steve waited a moment and Tony really wondered if he would deny himself this until Tony had officially broken up with Ryder. He was ready to argue that kissing him right now wouldn’t be bad in anyway.
Peter sighed and rubbed a hand on his face. “Maybe. I just…he was living right here Shuri and we never noticed. Miles was telling us the whole time and we didn’t listen. It’s hard not to feel like this is my fault, our fault.”
“Now onto our final judge. Mr. Miles can you please talk about what you looked about the two buildings.”
These thoughts continued to swirl through his head as he made his way back to the hospital. Peter had called him, saying that he and the boys were on their way back to May’s. That meant that Steve had a few minutes to get to the hospital. He had passed them on their way home and stopped briefly to check in about how their day was going, before heading up to Tony’s room. There he was stopped by a doctor, who wanted to ask for an autograph for her son. He obliged her wishes and went toward the front desk so he could have something to write on. When he was done, the same doctor asked if he wouldn’t mind coming down to the children’s floor, before having to go back to Tony.
“I brought it,” Steve said as he took out the necklace and another piece of jewelry with him. “You still have the other stuff I brought it on Monday?”
Steve rolled his eyes at him. As the night went on, the others continued watching TV and just relaxed. Peter fixed Miles some dinner, before they both retired for the night seeing as though it was Miles’ bedtime. And Peter had to get rest since he alongside other students had to get up early in the morning to set up for the carnival.
“So we’re just fine with Loki being here and not chained up. I mean I’m just you know pretty certain the last time we were all together it didn’t end well and it did end up with Loki chained up. Unless I’ve somehow transported to some alternate universe.”
Isak sat up straight, as though a string was pulling him upright. He tilted his head to the side, left and then right. A flicker of regret crossed his features and then pulled tight into discomfort. He made a clicking noise with his tongue against the back of his teeth.
And to be rather frank, he hadn’t ever wanted to see this man again in his life. However, he would much rather isolate them than have him stay where his family was.
Steve wasn’t very helpful seeing as though any romantic relationship he ever tried having ended without having much been started. Clint later told him he was awful at the advice and went to call on Natasha for a woman’s advice.
“Are you and Sam not engaged in copious amounts of affection as well?” Thor questioned, rifling through the refrigerator for some orange juice. “Cause surely it’s not thunder that’s making walls shake at night so. Sometimes I find myself accursed with being able to hear so well.”
“I feel like we need to have curfew for our resident geniuses,” Steve said coming around Tony. “Morning sweetheart.”
So when she got the call from Natasha five days ago asking if they could come over, she enthusiastically agreed. After all, the children had most certainly missed him. There had been many voices of discontent when Karen had to remind them once again that Tony would not be making his weekly visit.
Steve really needed to stop taking anything that Ryder said as something outside of him wanting to illicit some type of visceral response from himself.
So he gathered Tony in his arms and walked him to his room just like he had done so a few days ago. Steve pulled the covers back and placed Tony on the bed. Tony curled up onto the bed and reached for the sheets. Steve pulled the sheets over his body and tucked him in. He was about to leave, before Tony reached out for him.
“Well, it was nice seeing you all again. I will see you all in three weeks at the gala. Please send Tony my love, when he wakes.”
“Tony,” Steve breathed, the impact on the story just increasingly pressing against his chest. How long had Tony had to keep all of this to himself? He wanted to know what on earth told Tony to stay or even give this man a second chance when he came back.
“Love you,” Miles said wanting to get in on the goodbyes. “Love you,” he then directed toward Rhodey…though this love you sounded a bit unsure because he figured had still made his baba sad.
Bucky did as Tony asked and did not say anything. Instead he turned his attention to the cartoon and paid attention to the heartbeats of the two individuals resting beside him. Tony was quick to follow Miles into sleep. It was nearly two hours later, until Bucky fell asleep.
Finals are over! And as a treat I am making up for my absence. I hope you all enjoy and feel free to comment, kudo, bookmark, etc.
,” Tony choked. “Because for once I thought I had found someone besides Pepper and Rhodey who I could trust. Who I could trust enough not to hurt me, but you did. You lied and you didn’t…you still don’t even seem to care.”
“I can’t say I will always be happy to see your face and sometimes I may literally make you want to cry,” Tony said.
“You said you can help us find Tony?”  Steve said getting straight to the point. He hoped that this meant they were only a few seconds from knowing where Tony was.
He watched as Tony discreetly tried wiping away a tear. Clint felt an aching pain settle in his soul as he watched Tony struggle with what to say.
When the elevator stopped, revealing the roof Tony opened his eyes, mouth open in shock. His eyes didn’t know where to settle.
Ryder looked up from where he was holding himself up and winked. “Ah, now there’s a little bit of intelligence underneath that golden smile.”
Tony then brightened. “Oh, you’re all having a sleepover. That’s nice. Sounds fun. Have a little boys’ night out and all that.”
He desired that Tony would look up into his eyes and bare himself to Steve…bare himself so freely that Steve could cover him with his body and protect him. He wanted nights just like this, with Tony trailing a finger over his knee, humming some song to himself.
“Ooooh, one point deducted from your wooing skills Steve. Not sure how this is going to go in your favor with this start,” Tony teased back, for the first time letting doubt flee from his mind and letting hope enter. He didn’t know how this would pan out. However, there was nothing inside of him that wanted to tell Steve to stop.
Steve looked back and Tony searched his eyes. Once finding what he was looking for, he leant against Steve’s chest and talked.
Steve looked on angrily, even knowing that he had no reason. He wasn’t the one to pull Tony out of these attacks whenever he stumbled upon Tony having one. He wasn’t the one who go to match his breaths with Tony. He wasn’t the one to hold Tony’s wrists and rub circles into the smooth skin there and bring Tony’s body closer to his as an excuse to calm him down, when actually he just wanted to be closer and that was the only time Tony allowed him to be.
“Uh, no reason. Ryder called me asking if I could get in touch with you. He said he’s been trying to reach you for a while, but you weren’t responding. I thought that something might have happened and so I called to check in.”
Her voice grew softer as her eyes darted around the room. “And like the older volunteers tried stopping it, but Ms. Romanov recruited Jaime as second command and most of the other volunteers look up to him so we’ve been outnumbered…”
Steve went behind Tony and wondered what he should do. Tony looked on the verge of a panic attack and Steve didn’t want to make Tony uncomfortable. He remembered how Ryder brought Tony out of his attack, but Steve also knew another way.
“What does he have planned?” Steve asked unsurely as he looked at the party invite in his hand. “It’s not Tony’s birthday, so it can’t be that.”
Tony’s lower lip trembled and he forced himself not to start crying. He was so tired of all the tears and he doubted his body could keep losing this water intake…or however bodies stored tears he was sure he was maxed out. But as Steve kept rubbing his back and pressing soft kisses to his temple, he couldn’t keep it all in. Guess those past few months of therapy were actually working.
Steve looked down to the jeans he was wearing and the coat jacket he had put on in a hurry. “No, I’m not. I’m just going out.”
Tony ignored the throbbing in his bottom lip and turned his back to Ryder. He didn’t want to know how long it had been. What good would that do?
Steve walked in and thought first of going to see Tony, but then thought otherwise. He went to his bathroom, which was only two doors down from his bedroom door, which was cracked open enough so that Steve could slide his body through it without even opening it further.
When he arrived back at the interrogation room, only Clint and Bucky remained. Natasha had texted him, while he was on the quinjet saying the others had arrived back at the tower and were going to look after Tony, just in case he woke up.
Nails scratched against the laughter coming out of Ryder’s throat. Foots were pressed against breaking ribs. Elbows were thrown into stomachs. Hands blindly grasped for purchase on shoulders for leverage to kick at the spot between Ryder’s legs. Teeth were bitten into the soft flesh of Tony’s shoulder.
He had told Steve that leaving didn’t make sense. But Steve had stayed with Bucky and now Bucky felt the need to go with him even if he didn’t agree and he told Steve that. Bucky looked to Steve again and hoped for once that him seeing how affected Tony was with his departure he would want to stay.
“Ryder, I didn’t know that you worked at this hospital,” Steve said easily, trying to force down an instinctual frown he had for every time he saw Ryder. “I thought Tony said you worked at St. Edward’s hospital.”
“Alright Bucky and Clint you’re with me. Come on little black widows. Let’s see if we can get in line for the Frosty rollercoaster.”
Right now, he needed to place Tony in his bed and watch over him. He pulled the covers back, realizing that they were warm as though fresh out of the dryer. He didn’t know who had come in and done that, but he sent an internal thankful to whoever it was.
“I thought Steve was the only one interrogating me,” Isak said lowly, mouth hinting toward a secretive smile. “Now you sure do love painting my picture in the bad light. What’s the saying…oh let’s not speak ill of the dead.”
Bucky looked at his tea that was beginning to grow cold and shrugged his shoulders and wordlessly followed Tony into the den. Tony sat down on the couched and cued up a cartoon. He handed Miles one cookie and Bucky another. They all sat in a comfortable silence with the cartoon in the background.
Tony was surprised with how easily Miles’ forgiveness came, but Tony was not the one to take this for granted. So he grabbed the blue crayon Miles gave him and rested his back against the wall as Miles sat on his lap. Miles placed the coloring book on his lap and told Tony where he wanted him to color.
Finally, Ryder blinked his eyes open and saw that he was in a cell that was roughly 15x12. He felt caged in and he suspected everyone outside was watching him like an animal. His thoughts were confirmed when he saw Steve and his little band standing just outside his prison cells.
Tony sat back in his chair, fingers pressed against his lips in contemplation. He could feel the crack in where he had bitten his lip too hard. He licked at it to soothe the sting and tasted the cool copper taste of his blood.
Bucky raised his eyebrow and headed toward the kitchen sink. “So you’re in a good mood. I have to say though I thought you and Tony would still be having dinner in here or moved things up to the bedroom.”
“You may have had time to deal with your parents being killed in an accident, but you haven’t had the time to rationalize that your parents were murdered by the guy you are currently playing host to.”
Steve ran a hand through his hair. He had a fleeting thought that he should get a haircut soon. “I think I’d like to show Tony that I am staying, truly apologize for leaving, and show him that I’m going to fight for him. I’m going to show him that I love him and I’m not going to let Ryder manipulate me into thinking that I shouldn’t be near Tony.”
Steve’s eyes narrowed, a thirst suddenly appearing inside of him that could only be sated by whatever Tony had in store for him.
After that, he took more time actually washing himself off of the day’s events than spending time ruminating about all that had taken place in what seemed like forever. He looked down at the bite marks left on his forearm and picked at the swollen skin there.
“If I had known you responded so well to other people, I would have done this sooner,” Ryder laughed all of a sudden turning behind him.
Natasha watched Tony’s expression. And she knew him long enough and had studied him long enough to know that he wasn’t partly joking. So Natasha playfully rolled her eyes.
Steve did as commanded, pressing forward in that one spot. He felt himself begin to come apart. But he needed Tony to get there before him. After all, it was always his hopes for himself to bring Tony apart first.
“Don’t worry, I’ll get you another funnel cake,” Steve said while he pressed a warm hand into Tony’s back.
“Perhaps we may discuss it more privately,” Vision suggested. “Then we can make arrangements, while the rest of the Avengers discuss their own plans of return.”
Steve looked up for a moment and watched how Isak’s eyes darkened. Isak shifted in his seat and placed a hand firmly against his lap. He licked his lips and tried scooting closer in order to get a closer inspection of the pictures Steve was showing him.
“Yeah, sure. You didn’t mean a lot of things. Just like you didn’t mean to hurt me, right? Just like you didn’t mean to leave me freezing and alone with a broken arc reactor in Siberia? Just like you didn’t mean to just leave a fucking phone and a letter and think things were solved? Just like you didn’t mean to make me deal with all of this alone.”
He didn’t lay down, instead choosing to prop his back against the headboard and silently wait for Tony to fall asleep. A few minutes passed and Tony’s breaths started to even out. Steve looked down at him and noticed just how small Tony was in comparison to him. His body instinctively tried curling toward Steve.
After sleeping in the boys’ fort that one time, Tony had made it a habit of quickly switching over to their room for his second night’s sleep whenever he woke from nightmares. He was glad that he had said yes to Peter’s invitation to stay in the boys’ makeshift fort. Usually, the second time he fell asleep he could get three hours of sleep in before a nightmare woke him.
At the mention of Miles, Tony froze up. He could not stand the fact that Miles had known and that he had placed him in a position to witness how his baba let someone hurt him. Tony did not want to hear that at the moment and Steve realized all of that without Tony even saying anything, but what he didn’t expect was the complete shutdown of emotion that passed Tony’s expression.
“When I realized, I actually have a family to lose,” Natasha regarded. “I thought you would have realized that too.”
Tony narrowed his eyes. Steve had no doubt in his mind that Tony would eventually try looking for these said sources.
“Hey, Tony. I’m just going to wipe your face a bit, okay? Is that alright?” Steve asked, fingers clenching around the warm cloth. While Tony hadn’t said yes, he hadn’t mumbled no. Steve swallowed back a noise of sadness instead to focus on his priority right now. He grabbed the washcloth and wiped Tony’s face.
“I’ll make sure that those videos are erased. I won’t allow them to be the reason your son is taken from you. You’re a good father,” Cali whispered. “Now go.”
“You think they’re done judging your wonderful masterpieces?” Karen questioned, tilting her head to where some of the kids had gone.
“Tony I am pretty sure that just went over the kid’s head,” Steve admitted as he watched Miles reach back in front of him to the fruit snacks. He was almost successful in his mission.
He stared up at the ceiling, weighed down by this love. He had never known he could love someone so deeply before. Sure, he had loved Peggy, his ma, Bucky. But those loves were different.
Natasha frowned and nodded to herself. Then she looked at Bucky and Sam. Seeing something in their eyes, she reached a conclusion. She stood up and grabbed Sam’s remote. She weighed it in her hands and set it down. She then looked around and her eyes brightened upon seeing a metal book holder in the shape of a falcon. She raised it in her hands and aimed straight for Steve’s forehead.
Tony tensed. He was used to talking and constant movement. Even when he was with his sexual partners he was vocal. It’s just how he was. But with Ryder he had learned to stifle his pained groans and the rare moans of pleasure. He didn’t even know how quiet he had grown around Ryder until Ryder spoke on his silence.
“I’m safe. Why wouldn’t I be?” Tony questioned looking around trying to see if anything was misshapen.
“I did not know we had to give speeches. I wish to redo my entrance,” Thor said, going forward to grab his Lego building.
“Yeah, everything’s good. Look please tell Tony I won’t see him until tomorrow. I have a double shift tonight,” Ryder said grabbing his bags. “You both enjoy the rest of your day.”
“Just think about how it will feel when you’re inside of him and you can feel yourself right here,” he said interlacing his fingers with Winston’s.
Steve took them and rolled his shoulders back. He strode confidently to his spot and began. First one, missed. Second one, didn’t even go near the bottle. Third one, bounded off of Jaime’s forehead. Jaime remained silent as though waiting for his body’s response. Finally, he came back to life.
“Pepper can you take the kids and watch them,” Steve said. “And can you see if any journalists were able to get any information. There has to be someone that stayed behind and might have taken pictures that may be helpful.”
“So seeing as though it isn’t my birthday please tell me what this is for,” Tony said brushing his hair back.
Steve laughed and picked off a piece and gave the rest to Tony. Tony grinned and followed Steve throughout the rest of the carnival. Eventually they found themselves at a rollercoaster. Tony finished off the last bit of his lemonade and threw it into the trashcan alongside with the rest of his funnel cake.
“You were never just a kid from Brooklyn,” Tony shyly rushed out, before his brain could catch up. “I mean you don’t have to talk down on yourself to make me feel better.”
As his hands traveled to wash the rest of his body, he gently ran his towel over the bruises left behind from a few days ago. Looking at them, he quickly shook his head to keep his mind from wandering to dark thoughts.
If he was being honest, he understood Thor. He would much rather get to the main course. They had a breakfast at the tower, but Steve himself hadn’t made lunch. Clint picked at his food somberly as Natasha talked in a low breath to him. He looked up with a bit of a smile, before going back to poking at his food.
Besides what more could Ryder say that would ever possibly change or alter the events of the past or the ones that were meant to surely arrive in the near future?
“You are literally a child. I see two children in this room right now. I am having trouble deciding which is older,” Rhodey dryly stated. “Plus who told you anything about Miranda and her assets?”
Helen looked at his downtrodden face and sadly remarked to him, “Fine, but don’t do anything that could potentially cause harm to my patient. I’m doing this because I honestly don’t think any patient should ever wake up alone and if by chance he wakes up soon, I think it would be nice to see a familiar face instead of the nurse who tried sticking him with needles.”
“Understand this Steve. You never should have left and you will have to deal with the consequences of that action. Be lucky that Pepper and Rhodey took Miles and Tony on a trip to San Diego for this past month or they would have come with me. I’m pretty sure we wouldn’t have made it this far, if they were here,” Natasha said hoping that Steve understood the importance of what she was implying. “Actually I’m still pretty sure Rhodey’s been practicing how to use his leg brace as a weapon and Pepper…well I’m pretty sure she’s out to make sure you can’t be mobile for a year.”
Tony mumbled again and drew further into the covers. Steve left the room warm and happy knowing he had something to look forward to, once he returned.
He felt immobile as Ryder ran his hands along where the arc reactor was. Even though it was covered by clothing his touch burned through the fabric. Tony had grown to calm himself down when someone unknowingly touched the arc reactor, but Ryder’s intent…his intent to put Tony in this space of abysmal darkness was tilting the world around him.
Ryder leaned over Tony’s body and gently grabbed the StarkPad from Tony’s fingers. He crawled toward the head of the bead and place his back against the headboard. When he was settled, he softly maneuvered Tony into laying his head in his lap.
“Actually, I called you out here because I wanted to give you this,” he responded taking out the box from his jacket. “I wanted to give it to you, once we exchanged gifts this morning.”
Tony’s heart was nowhere near the point where it could take all that stress of one of the kids potentially breaking something. Thankfully, Peter and Harley were rather helpful in keeping the running to the minimum…that is when they weren’t engaged in the running itself.
“Yes, and that building that was in the middle of nowhere disappeared as soon as we found Tony. So we don’t have any physical evidence that could even use against him.”
Steve snorted. Sam and Bucky were now in their own corner, talking in hushed tones. Steve was happy for the two of them, but he was even happier he didn’t have to play mediator this time. The two rarely ever fought, but when they did…well Steve couldn’t get between his two best friends. So he played a game of “Where’s Waldo” until they eventually sorted it out.
Tony felt the attention of them all and tried straightening his shoulders to make it appear that he was completely fine. He turned toward Miles and handed him his toys and the Starkpad, which was now playing some cartoon. He put the headphones over Miles’ ears, making sure to adjust the sound so it was fine. Tony had often kept the volume high.
Tony looked at the two and let warmth spread throughout him, once again taking the cold that had begun to settle in his bones.
As the photographer walked away, Tony wiped at his temple trying to get rid of the wetness Ryder had left. Tony continued playing up his Stark persona going around with Ryder. He merely only did this to ensure nothing got printed. He had to know that Miles would be seeing everything now and when he got older he at least wanted to start moderating how he was portrayed…though most of it wasn’t his fault how the media smeared his name during his teenager years and the years following his parents’ death.
“It really isn’t, but I would much rather send you home later, than to send you home too early and find out that something is wrong,” Pepper admitted.
He didn’t need Rhodey to feed him anger. He needed comfort and love. Since neither he nor Pepper could be there physically to offer that, he quickly texted Pepper to see if she still had Ryder’s number. Upon receiving a text with a phone number from Pepper, Rhodey began drafting a message to Ryder.
“If there’s one thing I missed greatly besides my wife and kids, while in Wakanda it was this,” Clint said openly salivating at the smell of food. “How did I survive this long without a burger from here?”
“You had better,” Steve said. “Make sure you dress appropriately for the weather wherever Vision takes you.”
“Oh, so he answered your call,” Ryder made a few noises under his breathe. “Did he say why he wasn’t answering my calls?”
“Did you want anything for lunch? I’m making something quick for when Miles wakes up from his nap, but…why are you looking at me like that?” Tony sighed softly. “Really again?”
“But I hope that when the day, mercy finally grants you the chance to die, you are welcomed into the arms of something greater than hell,” Tony said, fingernails clutching so tightly into the chin of Ryde that beads of blood streamed down.
He looked over to Bucky to see how he was faring. Bucky looked straight back at him with the barest of smiles and knocked his shoulder into his.
“Ryder only did this as a scare tactic. He told everyone that no one was to touch you. Okay, no one. He just wanted you to think that you were being…” Cali explained and allowed Tony to fill in the missing gap.
“Sweetheart he does love me. He just sometimes has a different way of showing it. Just because I cry doesn’t mean I’m hurting,” Tony lied.
“I didn’t know he was still having trouble sleeping. He’s been in my bed for the past few weeks and when
Wanda and Vision would be talking to one another in hushed tones. Wanda would often be going over what she had found out about the CMPNY from her trips down to those members that they had found.
Harley remained silent for a few tantalizing seconds before breaking out in laughter. “No, but goodness the face you made is hilarious. FRIDAY did you capture their faces?”
Bucky shrugged his left shoulder. “I don’t know. Everything was fine. Like literally last week, I left for a mission with a kiss to the cheek and a worried come back home. Then when I come back, it’s like hell froze over.  Like he greeted me back the day I came home with some awesome sex…I mean mind-blowing. Steve I swear some of the things he did with his mouth I ain’t even heard of.”
“I let him do this to me,” Tony said, trying to push away from Steve, but Steve only drew him closer.
“Tony you are going to spoil these kids,” she said sitting down at her office chair. “Each of them probably have five toys to their name.”
It was a long journey, full of self-doubt at time. But Tony was forever thankful for his family’s encouragement and help any time that he needed it.
He knew how Tony felt about anyone in this field. He didn’t feel comfortable around him and the amount of people with cameras in there made him extremely nauseated. His eyes settled on Pepper and she seemed just as angry. Her fingers were flying angrily away at her phone no doubt finding a way to get these journalists away from Tony or at least find a way to confiscate their phones, cameras, or any other recording devices for the time being. When he she looked back up, she sent him a sympathetic glance and in turn Tony nodded in thanks.
“Welcome again to the annual Stark Charity Christmas Gala. I was going to have this whole introduction, which I thought was entirely endearing, but Pepper has insisted that it is not appropriate for the younger ears here tonight,” Tony joked. “Especially Mrs. Goldman.”
But the most striking of it all was Steve standing in the center of it. Steve who was nervously wringing his hands together as Tony’s eyes finally landed on him.
Steve looked down at Tony, who was still staring at him as though waiting for the first move. With Tony’s therapy with Dr. Sana over the past few years, he had been more engaged with redefining what intimacy meant for himself and how much control he wanted.
The two sat in silence for a few minutes not able to say anything. What could they say? That everything would be okay? That felt like a lie, even before it was felt on his tongue. That Tony was strong and he would recover in no time? That sounded awful and dismissive of what Tony went through, expecting him to hurry his process of recovery just because those around him wanted him to be okay.
“By what saying that Tony needs a vacation,” Fury frowned. “We can’t do anything with that Captain. It seems to me you have forgotten my rules for this interrogation.”
“I don’t know how long or how short it will take for this changes to take into effect. But I know they will. Gotta admit to yourself, all throughout this conversation, your limbs grew numb didn’t they?”
But now there was nothing that could take Tony away from that bracelet or Steve. That bracelet that even Tony still wore was a hint of a promise that Steve was now strengthening after Tony hopefully said yes later today.
Tony turned his head to the side and mulled over what Steve was saying to him. Oh, how much he wanted all of this to be true. If Steve had come to him saying all of this a year ago, Tony would have unashamedly climbed Steve like a tree. It was only the thought of Ryder that kept him from doing so.
“Yeah. We especially were during our teenage years. Tony looked after me. I looked after him, even though he said that wasn’t my job. Then well his parents died and he had to become head of his dad’s company. I was an agent. I didn’t really have time to make home visits. I mean we still stayed in touch, but not so recently.”
His body sank into the bed and he wanted to cry in pure happiness that he was back home away from that room and that hotel. He looked to the door and realized it had been cracked slightly to the point where it was nearly closed, but just open enough that Tony knew he could leave if he wanted to.
“The fact that it looks like you’ve been crying and you’re hiding underneath three blankets,” Steve announced resting his back against the back of the bed.
Natasha angrily marched toward Steve. Fire settled deep in her cheeks as she raised her hand. Steve prepared himself for Natasha’s hit and prayed that for once it really truly hurt. He was disappointed, when she made no movement. He watched as she shook her head at him portraying her disappointment and grief over his actions.
Natasha ground herself closer more so to keep Tony upright. “Come on Tony. Just tell me what they gave you? You remember the color?”
. The disappointment on his eyes when Ryder kissed away those broken whispers of Steve was awe inspiring,” Miriam moaned.
“That wasn’t your fault Steve,” Tony said, his voice muffled slightly from his lips pressed against Steve’s knees.
“Just let me work toward getting my wife and kids back Tony, please. Then I can get my brother back too,” Clint tried. “I’ll stop pushing you away and being an abrasive asshole. I promise.”
Rhodey smiled, remembering the same ordeal with his mom and Tony. He knew that threat would hit Tony. Rhodey stared at Tony and looked at the circles under his eyes and the tiredness residing on slouched shoulders. He tried dialing back his anger toward the Avengers for making his friend…his little brother feel this way. He opened his mouth to say something more, but that wasn’t what Tony needed right now.
He didn’t know why his first instinct was to go to Steve. On any other day he would’ve called Pepper and Rhodey. He told himself he would give them a call and explain everything when he gets the chance. But Steve was here and maybe he just wanted to go to Steve to have proof that everything Ryder said was a lie.
Tony stared at him and looked at his hands. Nodding, he stood up and followed Steve to the kitchen sink. Steve made motions to pull up the sleeves of Tony’s shirt, but Tony quickly pulled his hands back and pushed the sleeves down to his wrists.
“Aunt Natasha stop,” Miles said laughing. Natasha smiled even more brightly and kissed his full cheeks.
“How’d you manage to get me home? No, I know what it was. You just used that oh golly smile on the hospital staff and promised them something like liberty and they let you spring me free. Probably added in a promise of puppies and rainbows for the next two weeks.”
“We thought the first time Miles sees you again, it shouldn’t be like this. We wanted to wait a bit at least until you felt a little better,” Steve explained.
Miles sighed frustrated as though Steve interrupted him. “Captain. Mr. Mean Bad One made baba cry. I don’t like you, but I don’t like when baba cries. Fix it.”
With Tony gone, Peter and Harley went to get their homework done early. Peter had laid out some alphabet worksheets for Miles. Miles was currently concentrating on making sure he was able to correctly copy the letter Q.
“Tony no. I never want you to change. That’s…Tony never think for a second that I’d like you to change anything about you,” Steve explained.
“I’m sorry,” he said, slower that time. “I do apologize that my relationship with Tony has ended this way. Had I known my actions would have brought such pain and heartache I would have sought to rectify that immediately? However, you know Tony, Captain. I am sure you know.”
“No, we haven’t done any of the sort. The house is still intact,” Steve smiled. Clint made kissing sounds behind him and Steve pushed him away.
Steve’s hand twitched on the part of the couch he had rested his hand on. He looked at Ryder’s hand rubbing slowly circle around Tony’s knees and speaking to him softly.
Bucky cleared his throat alerting Steve of his presence. Steve turned around and Bucky winced at the appearance of Steve. He knew he hadn’t gotten much sleep, hell most of them hadn’t with trying to find this driver and still looking for other methods of finding Tony. But Steve seemed to not be sleeping at all and it showed.
“Yeah?” Bucky said, running his hands nervously. “I just got so into the last mission, the dates kind of blurred for me. I never want Sam to feel like he’s someone that could be easily forgotten. I mean I love him with every fiber of my being and the fact that he’s out there thinking I don’t care enough to celebrate the biggest day of my life…our life…”
Steve realized his mistake, when Ryder pulled his head forward in order ram his head into Steve. Steve pulled back just enough for the impact to only hit him on the left side of his face. The bruise wouldn’t last longer than a day…but this anger well it certainly wouldn’t pass along so quickly.
“Ugh, please leave all the lovey dovey stuff to yourself. It’s too early for this hallmark movie sweetness,” Bucky joked, making way to wash a cup.
“That’s good. Oh by the way while I have you on the phone, I wanted to know if you all plan on going to the winter carnival Karen and I are throwing for the nearby orphanages. I mean it’ll probably be good to help build back all of your images in the public eye. Natasha is also coming so,” Tony trailed off.
There had been more baths and Tony hated how powerless he felt. It seemed just as he was finally gaining back power in his life it was ripped up from underneath him. He had been sober for years and now he was being forced to drink. He had even entertained the idea of taking a bath with the scented bath bombs Natasha had kept mentioning. Now he threw up at any mention of going near that large tub of water.
She looked at her watch and sighed. “I need to go know, before someone is alerted that my visit with my grandmother lasted longer than I intended. I am certain that the one I left in charge may sell me out, if they can gain favor in Ryder’s eye.”
Isak looked at his brother incredulously. “Childish grudges? Are you serious? I have every right to be mad at you, seeing as though you are the direct cause of everything that has gone wrong in my life and nearly every other person you have touched. I’m honestly surprised that Tony took you back into his life, seeing as how you are good at destroying everything closet to you.”
“It’s just funny. Who would have thought the blushing virgin from Brooklyn would so boldly ask his boyfriend’s AI to set a lube reminder,” Tony chuckled. “Just very eye-opening to me is all the ways I’ve corrupted America’s Golden Boy.”
Y'all this chapter physically drained me. So after this Chapter 5 is going to be the fluffiest thing, fluffier than cotton candy because...well just read and you'll see why.
They all hoped Isak was really Ryder because if so Steve was going to get the chance to show that he truly didn’t deserve anything as quick as a car crash, when he got through with him.
Wanda looked hopefully at Steve for permission. Steve knew that Wanda had missed the presence of Vision something great. However, he was still wary of leaving Wanda out of his sight. Vision took this hesitance of Steve’s approval.
He had no tomb to kneel over and offer flowers, but he had this silent moment here in the room he felt the safest in.
Clint nodded. “And I did. Look if I have only learned one thing in my career, it is how to take a quick shower and get ready in five minutes. Now let’s go! Can we stop by David’s Burger Shack first though? I’m starving.”
Steve came in, followed by Bucky. Tony turned his head to the two and the hazy expression was back in them.
Their laughter soon transformed into breathy gasps as the kiss grew more heated as though the two had been separated for so long and this was finally like coming home.
Peter face palmed and Harley snickered to himself. Karen raised an eyebrow and muttered something along the lines of, “of course.”
Harley and Peter, along with Julie insisted that they were going to be the hosts of this gameshow competition that the kids had elected to put on.
Everything just pointed toward Steve being the main person that wasn’t helping Tony. In order for Tony to move on, Steve needed to not be such a heavy presence in his life.
Just as he was about to press hand against Tony’s cheek, Tony woke up with a startled, “No, don’t!” with his hands pressed against his arc reactor.
Steve shook his head and followed the warring emotions in Tony’s eyes. One emotion didn’t rest easy with him.
Sam winced, already knowing that Natasha didn’t come here to play. Both him and Bucky seemed to get the idea and moved quietly in the kitchen as Natasha went to go sit in the den. Steve came out of the room. A moment of startled surprise at Steve’s appearance, shook Natasha. Steve dragged himself into the den. His beard looked poorly kept and his eyes were rimmed red with no sleep. His shirt was rumpled as though he hadn’t changed clothes in a few days.
By now Tony’s eyes were wide with unshed tears. He had settled his glass down in favor of reaching forward to hold Steve’s hands. Steve took his hands into his own, eyes reflecting the same unbridled emotion mirrored in Tony’s.
Tony smiled at the two. Miles had gotten used to Natasha over the past few days and had innocently asked Tony what he could call her. Tony had been honest and explained that he could call Natasha whatever she wanted as long as she was comfortable with it. Miles had settled on Aunt Natasha.
“Well, Julie all of them did well. I like a lot of color, so I really liked the one with all of the colors.”
“What does this have to do with why Tony was taken?” Steve said not really knowing why she was giving him this background information, but thankful all the less.
At this Tony grew slightly upset. “Why are you doing this? Are you trying to confuse me or something?”
“Alright Bucky, but please no more than two games. The boys need to get some rest. I’m taking Harley to go see his mom tomorrow morning and Miles had a bedtime.”
Steve remained silent the entire time as they headed back to the ballroom. He didn’t want Tony going with Ryder anyway. Wasn’t it too soon for the whole meeting parents? Steve watched as Tony said goodbye to everyone at the table with promises that he would get in touch with Rhodey and Pepper and set up a breakfast date for when they were all back in town.
“Oh, we can talk about this when I get into town? Oh, you mean before or after I have to meet with Pepper and Rhodey so I can tell them my intentions with you as your boyfriend. Like Tony you didn’t even ask if I agreed to this,” Ryder hissed.
Clint paused for a brief second. “And so I called her and told her everything. I mean she’s still upset no doubt. But she’s allowing me to see her and the kids when they come back from her parents. So I’ll probably be visiting them after New Year’s.”
Tony was about to say something, when May quickly asserted her piece. “Oh Christopher shut it. Don’t think we don’t remember when your son sent the whole school an unsavory video involving you and his chemistry teacher or when your daughter decided she wanted to drink a whole bottle of ketchup as her talent for the spring pageant.”
“Oh, right of course. I forgot that Tony used to take him. Well that is awfully kind of you Rogers. Look I am heading out in about thirty minutes. How about we save some gas and just ride back together, since we’re all heading back to the same place,” Ryder offered smiling easily.
“Shh, breathe with me Tony,” Ryder said gently pushing Natasha aside. “Come on sweetheart. Let’s start naming things in the room yeah. Adjective and noun? Red hair. Ugly painting on the wall. Really? I know billionaires buy things to just boast that they have a priceless picture, but Tony that frankly looks like ass.”
Tony’s mouth nearly salivated at the thought of some food. He had wanted a burger, but he figured he could get Steve to bring him one later. He made grabby motions to the food, not yet wanting to speak into the serene silence that wrapped Tony like a blanket.
I'm so sorry, y'all feel free to throw coal at me...I promise it will get better soon. Comfort is going to come like a gentle breeze.
He was so caught up in the shivering, that he didn’t even notice when they made it to his lab. He could hear Natasha whisper, “Five days,” as she grabbed a spare blanket and draped it over Tony’s spare shoulders.
Tony shook his head. “No, no. You’ve already had a long day at work. It’s fine honestly. I’m sorry I forgot. Hopefully we can still make the reservation. If not, I’m sure I can just throw my last name out there.”
By then her eyes had grown a wet sheen to them. “We didn’t notice anything wrong. I mean I was his twin sister, surely he’d tell me. But he didn’t. He told me about how wonderful things were. And I believed him. I didn’t know that he being serious was him actually being depressed. I didn’t realize that him becoming reserved was evidence of her isolating him from all those that loved him.”
Tony clenched his jaw and hoped that whatever was laced in his drink would wear of soon so he could choke Ryder. He had a flashing image of him choking Ryder, while in his suit. That image gave him a little bit of relief.
“That’s why communication is key. Both of you to need to practice it. It’s something that you’re always learning about. I’m sure if y’all just sit down and talk, have a real honest conversation, it’ll be fine.”
“I know. I guess I’m just concerned,” Peter admitted softly, quickly adverting his eyes. “I mean I know that like you’re an adult and can take care of yourself…but I’m the type of person that I get close to people quick. And you’re family now. So I just…I don’t know. I just want to make sure you’re safe, you know? Cause when I visited you I remember Rhodey cursing out the Avengers and telling me that they were the reason you were laid up in your bed like that.”
Listening to the beat of the heart monitor and Tony’s hand between his, Steve allowed his eyes to fall shut.
He allowed himself a few moments to gain back control of his thoughts and berate himself for even thinking of telling Rhodey about Ryder. It wasn’t a big deal.
None of the agents had said anything to them. They only offered short nods and hesitant smiles. Steve tried offering one of his own back. When an agent grimaced in response and quickly walked off, he figured that his smile was less to be desired.
After a few more hours at Karen’s, Natasha and Steve left with promises to come back. As promised Steve, along with Bucky and Natasha, went back to the tower. Bucky sighed loudly as he grabbed his bags and went to his room saying he was tired from proving to Sam that he could lap him five times easily. Natasha followed Bucky’s lead.
So instead, Steve resolved to wash himself with his hands that were equally as bruised and bloodied as the rest of him. However, he could not find it within himself to particularly care for his state of being, since he was so satisfied with how things had ended.
He bit his lip to stop himself from crying in aggravation and from pain. His body rocked and nausea continued to swell within him. He heard people outside move back and forth and he wondered why no one was coming in his room at least to open it.
“You were talking about meetings you have planned for the day,” Steve tried helping him get back on track, though his finger was now slowly pushing into Tony.
“Tony fell asleep almost a minute after you said sweetheart. Look it’s important that you answer my question,” Cali stressed.
“I’ll give you three days with him. I need to have him back and sober by then. He has a kid to take care of unfortuntely,” Ryder instructed. “I’ll be back then. Do level three.”
Tony then turned angry eyes to him. “You don’t have to ask. I’m not some fucking fragile person to be careful of touching. Fuck, Ryder’s done a hell lot worse, I’m sure you could tell. I little hand holding isn’t going to kill me.”
“Cali…told you,” Tony whispered, waiting for the betrayal to settle in his heart. He had trusted her. “You…why are you talking like you don’t know what happened. Like you weren’t there?”
“Steve,” Tony said turning his body to face Steve. His voice sounded like his heart was breaking. Tony placed a palm on Steve’s stomach and he felt the gesture ground him.
“Should I tell him or would you like to spin the lies as you so often do about how you’re actually a grown full-functioning adult,” Natasha commented, eyebrows raised in slight challenge.
Tony was completely glued to his seat. His heart was caught in his throat and he felt a burning in his eyes. Blinking quickly, he turned to Principal Davis. Principal Davis who had remained silent for most of this meeting finally chose to speak up.
When he went outside, he was met with Fury leaning against the brick wall. He was about to question why this secrecy, before Fury narrowed his eye.
So that’s why he hadn’t come in guns blazing. There had been room for error, but Tony lived with this man for long enough to know his mannerisms.
Steve shook his head, unsure of how to answer this. “It’s not bad to remember the good things. Those memories still belong to you. I know it’s hard and it may seem conflicted…I don’t know if I can tell you how to feel. Because honestly I don’t want you having any good memories of that man because he doesn’t deserve them. However, I didn’t know him and I’m…I’m sorry I can’t see any positivity. I’m sorry. May have to ask someone else that question sweetheart ‘cause I’m afraid I don’t have the answer right now.”
Suddenly, Tony realized the absence of one small body. He looked around himself and didn’t see Miles anywhere. He was certain he was latched onto his leg just a few moments ago, but there he wasn’t.
Bucky was next, deciding to make sure Steve actually finished his meal before retiring to his own quarters.
Steve shifted on his feet and looked past Tony. Steve’s refusal to look Tony in the eyes led Tony to look elsewhere. Tony noticed the bags resting near Steve’s feet and others that were piled up in the main living area. Steve’s jaw clenched and he kept his eyesight on the wall behind Tony.
“Hey, no talking to the competitor Jaime,” Harley announced, grabbing ahold of the kid in Jaime’s arms. “Or I’ll have to disqualify you for going against the rules.”
“So this is what some misplaced revenge on Tony?” Steve rasped. “He’s doing all of this because instead of graduating from MIT, he graduated from Harvard.”
Tony’s body quickly recoiled as Steve reached out to grab one of Tony’s hands. A moment of stagnant silence filled the room as neither one dared to move. Steve’s eyes immediately darkened with shame and he tried hunching his shoulders as though trying to make himself smaller. Meanwhile Tony was trying to calm his breath and uncoil the tightness in his body.
He brought their hands to his lips and kissed Tony’s palm. “He hurt you and I didn’t know. We’ve been living together again for almost half a year. Pepper tells me you were with him for a year and I don’t know why. I don’t know why you stayed with him. I don’t know how long this has been going on, but it doesn’t matter how long or how short the time frame was…he laid his hands on you and fuck…”
A smile made its way to his face as he remembered bringing Tony food down to his lab, during one of his working binges. Tony had told him one had never lived until they lived three days straight with no sleep. Steve hard argued that it hadn’t made sense. Tony had merely taken the offered sandwich and went back to his work, only stopping once in a while to bother Steve about what he had been drawing. Steve, almost always, obliged.
Steve hadn’t felt this type of unfurling anger, since he found out what Hydra did to Bucky. He had destroyed Hydra and he had no problems with burning Ryder and everything else he held close to him down. Steve hoped he was the first one to get to Ryder just so he could have the satisfaction of hitting Ryder harder than the sound of the slap that came over the phone. He was going to do more than hit him though. He didn’t know if he would be fine with just leaving him bruised.
“We argued about basically everything. How we should enter a fight, what we should have for dinner, how my suit wasn’t user friendly, how he was just a body in a suit, how I was just a serum in a body. It was this constant back and forth, but it became us. Soon the fights became less about serious things and more about playful things something you’d fight with a sibling about.”
He leant back and patted his cheek, sharply. He turned his shoulder away and began to exit the room.
“So is there a love interest for you Pep,” Rhodey said, trying with all his might to direct the attention away from him.
Tony grins at the memory, almost content to stay wrapped in this bed with one of his favorite people. But alas a snack actually did sound good right now. It was as though that now Tony had been trying to get on a healthier diet, his body was punishing him and wanting to eat nearly every second of the day.
“Your phone call took a while. I got worried,” Julie answered honestly. “You have to stay here, Mr. Tony.”
Peter took this and said, “But we told Miles don’t listen to him. That kid was probably just taking out his anger unjustly on a kid smaller than him. But either way he didn’t want to seem like he was a baby, so Harley and I have been letting him sleep here.”
He barely had the chance to place the other monitor on his shelf before Ryder pushed him onto the bed. Ryder began unbuckling his belt and pushing his jeans to the floor. Tony placed himself on his elbows and looked at Ryder.
“Look we can talk about this when you get back into town,” Tony told him. “I’m in public right now so I can’t really get into this.”
“Hey Tony…” Sharon exclaimed, but stopped when she saw her cousin and Steve close together. “Should I come back at another time or?”
“It’s yours just as much as it is mine,” he said and without a second glance to her, he was being led away to his floor with Ryder.
Tony shrugged, but when he realized Steve couldn’t see the movement he articulated his movement. “Yeah, sometimes I get a little jittery, when I’m in settings like this especially when I didn’t prepare beforehand. I may be good with crowds and media, but that’s because I always get ready to set up this defensive shield. I was setting up a shield for a small dinner not this.”
“So there’s no sense of you leaving, if I don’t need your protection,” Tony angrily shouted, fire coursing through his vein. “I don’t need anyone’s protection. I am fine on my own! I’m just like everyone else in this tower Steve yet you’re not running away from Natasha. You’re not telling her you have to leave because of some
Karen laughed. “Alright, let’s go deal with this yeah and then appropriately get started on the decorations?”
Tony licked his lips not knowing what to say. What could he say to that question anyway? He knew that Peter was right. If the situations were flipped, he could only hope that Peter would come to him. He quickly through this thought away, knowing that he would do everything in his power to make sure that the three other boys in this room would never find themselves in his situation.
Tony smiled as he took his spot beside Ryder. He had to keep smiling so none of his guests would notice anything was amiss.
Steve began calling Tony and the phone rang for a few seconds, before reaching the voicemail. “Hi, you’ve reached Tony…DUM-E put that down…crap…U…no you can’t eat that…ugh is this still recording? Pepper I don’t need-”
Peter grabbed his backpack as the only thing he wanted on his person at the moment. As Steve started the car, Peter reached into the front pocket of his backpack and pulled out a silver encased box, perfectly wrapped in intricate designs and fine silk wrapping itself in a bow around it.
“Like father like son,” Rhodey said his mouth tilted in a sarcastic grin. “So what do you take of the letter?”
“Did you just call me out here to give me compliments?” Tony asked, attempting to advert his gaze from Steve’s. “I thought I would never live to see the day.”
“How about you just be a doll and tell me what I did wrong. Make this little shindig go by a little faster, yeah?” Tony smirked letting cockiness feed into his tone, a defense that he relied heavily on.
“I am not lying and I do not appreciate you making me out to be a liar,” Isak professed. “Now, I’ll admit your teammate, Tony, is rather handsome. Had I not been married
Steve looked toward a sleeping Tony and debated how he should answer Ryder. If he said yes, that would at least ease Ryder’s worry that Tony was in trouble. If he said no, that would increase Ryder’s worry.
Pepper shook her head quickly at him. “What Rhodey means to say is that planning is nice. You love doing everything big and I’ll help you plan things once the time comes.”
“Hey, no. You can’t go there right now. Steve,” Bucky said sharply pressing his metal hand into the lower back of Steve. “Not now.”
“No?” Ryder asked amused. “See I believe that you do. And it’s not even just sex, is it? It’s in everything. You want me to take you out to dinner dates and curl my arm around you. You want me to go see movies with you and even invite Miles sometimes. You want me to kiss you gently on your cheek and brush back the hair that is curling against the nape of your neck.”
“No, Tony. Hey, no,” Steve said placing his hand on Tony’s chin to bring their gazes matching each other. “You did not let him do anything to you. Everything that happened to you was not because you let it happen.”
The cool water was a nice opposite to the fire licking up and down Steve’s skin. Brief moments of Ryder’s mocking taunts and Tony’s pained expressions were interspersed with one another. He wondered quietly to himself how long it would be, before those vivid images would become muted.
Ryder quickly grabbed Tony by the waist and brought him closer. Under his breathe he threatened, “It would be best if you do not finish your statement. You are going to go inside and say that you forgot that we are supposed to be spending a few days at my parents. Find a babysitter for that kid and you and I are going to take a trip.”
“Ah! I had completely forgotten about my brother’s infatuation with the Stark heir. I knew that he had a crush on the man a while ago, but I never kept up with him seeing as though I was living with my foster family in California at the time. However, he often would write me saying how he was interested in this Tony fella.”
“You’ll just have to open it,” Steve whispered as softly as Tony did, afraid to break the quietness and sort of innocence of this moment.
“Are you sure you’re comfortable with me going? I mean this is your thing,” Natasha offered, hoping that Tony wouldn’t mind.
A few hours after they had managed to efficiently end the party with minimum complaint, they were all gathered in the main living area, waiting for Tony to come back. After they had learned the true reason for the party ending, none of them felt comfortable going to sleep until seeing Tony arrive back and seeing how he was holding up after the break-up.
“I haven’t forgotten them so much as I don’t agree with them,” Steve claimed. “You and I both know that he’s Ryder. We’re wasting time playing this game. The place he would take Tony was called the Winston estate. Hell, Fury that’s where we found him.”
“Mhm, well five days is fine with me. I certainly wouldn’t want to rush them,” Tony whispered. “Don’t put it there Thor. Yeah, I want this thing to look like its fucking levitating. Those girls are going to be amazed by ours.”
He walked into the main living area and saw Bucky gathering some books into his bag. He raised an eyebrow, which was received by a half shrug. Steve laughed shortly and turned away intending to go into the kitchen and grab a bottle of water and some snacks. However, his movements were stopped, when he felt a body barrel into his.
“You need rest and I’m pretty certain Natasha will kill me tomorrow if she realizes I didn’t do the one instruction she left me with.”
“I know that and you’re the best family I have. But Pepper’s off in England and you’re off recovering because of me,” Tony choked out, tears now running freely down his cheek. “And it’s fine. I love you all and I know distance won’t change that, but they were becoming to be my family and I want them back. I need them back Rhodey.”
“Rules,” Harley snuffed out. “Now may you two please be seated? Our judges would first like to address the buildings, before they give their final statement on who wins.”
Steve’s eyes brimmed red hot with tears and he cleared his throat. He had no reason to feel this affected. He was the one who did all of this stuff to Tony. He was the one who put him in this position.
“No, Stark’s made it clear where he stands. He’s not going to budge if he doesn’t realize what is at stake.”
He laughed as Steve walked backwards from the lab. “It’s going to be great! I’m going to sweep you off your feet I swear. And I promise I’ll be nice to Ryder, when you break it to him that he’s just not good enough for you. I also will hold the box of Kleenex out to him as I usher him outside the tower.”
The smirk on Miriam’s face didn’t seem to ease Tony’s worries. However, he couldn’t help the small slimmer of hope that he could wash away the stain that their hands left. Ryder left the room, locking it behind him.
Cali placed the needle in Miriam’s outstretched hand. Cali steadied Tony’s head and Miriam leaned forward injecting whatever was in the syringe into his neck. A few seconds passed and Tony felt his jaw slacken and his mouth open up.
He walked everywhere and he kept running sweating hands over his jeans. His eyes kept looking around him as though waiting for Ryder to pop out of nowhere and take him to that place again. Tony felt his chest grow light and a head ache start to form.
Thanks again to everyone who commented, gave a kudo, and left a bookmark. You all continue to make my day :)
Tony didn’t dare allow himself to be hopeful. However, Wanda’s hopeful smile at the back of him and Pepper’s excited squeal caused him to want to look behind himself.
He tried holding in a sob, while his eyes were close. The pressure on his throat from holding in the sob did not ease up until his body succumbed to sleep.
“I’m truly glad to be back, Karen. I miss the little ones. And I’m sorry that I wasn’t around to help out more and make sure that you guys still had everything-”
His voice cracked and Steve froze knowing that Tony was on the verge of crying. However, being as calm and collected as Tony had grown to be, he quickly gathered himself.
“I’m gonna kill him Buck. As soon as I see him, I don’t care what I have in my hand. Whether it be by my shield or my hands, he is going to die,” Steve rasped on the verge of a broken cry. “He…I can’t keep hearing Tony’s voice and how he sounded. Bucky he sound like he couldn’t even breathe.”
Tony leaned back and shrugged. “It’s decent I guess. Certainly not on my level of refined, but I can see some people digging that lumberjack masculine esque appeal.”
Suddenly, Harley came into view eyes bright with anger and glistening with tears. “Fuck you! Fuck all of you and this whole damn hospital institution!” He directed it toward the doctor who was following him. “I’m ready to go.”
“Took you guys long enough. I was starting to wonder, if I needed to start a matchmaking scheme. You two aren’t subtle at all,” Natasha sighed reaching in her purse for her foundation. “Seriously, Steve you couldn’t have waited until we got home for you to jump Tony.”
Of course his phone call had been important. Tony should have answered and now Ryder had to go through all of this alone just because Tony wanted to give into his desires and give him the silent treatment.
The two continued talking, while Peter went back to looking at Miles. The hairs on Peter’s arms stood and a cool shiver went through his spine. He straightened his back as he saw a woman approach Miles and begin talking to him. Peter didn’t even hesitate as he sprung out of his seat and walked toward Miles.
He prayed for once that they would stop long enough for him to give a believable performance. He widened his eyes, looking imploringly at Ryder from underneath his eyelids. He ran his thumb over Ryder’s knees.
“I know I see him Miles, but let’s be quiet so we can hear the video, okay?” Tony said trying to calm down the excited child.
The two share laughter that is Peter’s pining. “But I’ll tell him you have a cobbler waiting for him and he’ll probably swing through.”
“Okay, look around Steve. Final check to make sure everything is looking according to plan. Need to run any last ditch errands?” Natasha questioned, completely ready to do so if required.
Natasha raised a brow at them as Bucky leaned over Sam to grab a piece of bacon, but not before letting his hand linger of Sam’s waist. Natasha turned to Tony who only shrugged as Sam leaned into the touch before turning away to talk to Thor who was already looking for some pop tarts.
He needed Steve to stay with him and denounce everything that Ryder said. He wanted Steve to be the domino effect, not the domino effect of people leaving, but the domino effect of people staying and actually caring about him.
Natasha crossed her arms angrily over her chest. She titled her head in agreeance with Clint’s question.
Cali leaned over from her spot behind Tony and pushed the bottle away. “Miriam stop it. You’re chocking him. And you will not be sleeping with Mr. Stark. That was not in our instructions.”
“No. Look we’ve been interrogating him, right. But look Ryder has somehow managed to make himself look like and behave similar to his brother, Isak. From an outside perspective we’re holding an innocent man, who was unfortunately roped in with his brother’s schemes. But we both know that’s not right.”
Steve settled his eyes on Bucky and shook himself of where he had gone. He had no time to go back into his head like that and he had already wasted enough time. He clenched his jaw and with his eyes seemed to tell the Avengers to get ready. No one wasted in time in grabbing their uniforms or weapons. Steve wanted to ask Bucky if he was sure he was up to coming with them and Bucky only seemed to raise a brow as if wondering why Steve had even asked.
“What do we do next?” Tony questioned, when both of them had calmed down and been satisfied that the other was still alive.
Natasha braved a kiss to his forehead and left Steve to his thoughts. Steve stared at the thrown Accords document and picked it up on the floor. Raising a finger, he flipped to the first page and began reading.
Ryder and he had not said anything since leaving the kitchen. Tony decided to place Miles in his guest bedroom and set the child monitor in his room. He gave one look back at Miles before cracking the door and heading to his bedroom.
His breath caught and he didn’t want his hands to further explore his body…to see what had happened. He leaned over the bed wincing at his tight muscles. A hand went down toward his legs. He clenched them together. His hands shook as he tried parting his legs to feel…
“I…” Steve uttered his eyes suddenly feeling heavy. He shook his head at Bucky and pursed his lips together.
The soft touch was so different in comparison to the last time Tony and Steve were physically close back in Siberia. Both of their minds were focused on this, but neither chose to speak up afraid of disrupting this silence.
Steve gathered all the Avengers. Thor came back, alongside Loki. He claimed he didn’t quite trust Loki to be by himself yet. Wanda and Vision flew in as soon as the news reached them. Sam had put a hold on his counseling sessions and offered his help in any manner. T’Challa offered his services and told them that if they needed further need of him, he would fly to America with great urgency.
Clint sighed under his breath and began to slowly realize what was happening. He was losing his family in a war that wasn’t even his to fight. He had no problems with the Accords. Hell he knew it was the safest thing that guaranteed his children would be protected if someone like him didn’t have morals. There was one time he didn’t…
Tony remained silent and let his hands grow limp in Steve’s. Tony had barely noticed that Steve continued to rub circles into his palm with his thumb.
Clint shrugged and leant close to Tony, so the others wouldn’t hear him this time. “Don’t worry I’ll sneak into the vents later and find our buildings and add some explosion thing to it. Come on, I know you like blowing things up in your lab. Let’s make it cool. We can even add glitter to it.”
There were some things he couldn’t share with Steve, at least not yet and besides Dr. Sana Tony felt most comfortable with talking to Natasha. Natasha didn’t outwardly show how much his thanks meant, but Tony knew her well enough to know that she was impacted.
“So please don’t lie to me now. Don’t put me through this pain of thinking that…the person I love isn’t here.”
Fury stepped in, just as Steve started taking great delight at the slumped figure on the ground. He wondered if he could wake it up to the sound of his fingers crushing. Just when he was about to step on his twitching hands, he was pulled outside of the room by Bucky.
Steve tilted his head, then followed Tony’s line of eyesight. Apparently, blood is pretty hard to remove from your fingernails. Steve resisted the urge to place his hands behind his back, and instead stared at Tony.
The two didn’t talk about what made them wake up with fevered looks and stolen breath. But in that moment they could almost fool themselves into believing that it was alright as long as they stayed together on that couch watching boring history documentaries.
So he had to tell her he’d be just a few minutes later, but would make sure that he was there in time for his boring board meetings.
Natasha pressed firmer into Steve’s shoulder. “Steve, keep your head on your shoulders. He’s just trying to manipulate you into doing something that gets him free. You know that if we potentially harm him more than within reason, without a confession we have no choice but to let him go and we could potentially get into trouble. Save all of this energy for when we have a confession. Then I would gladly assist you in putting a dagger through his eyes.”
“I’ve lost people I love. I can’t tell you that it won’t feel like the world is ending because for me it felt exactly like that. It felt like a piece of me was dying alongside with them. If they left, they would have been taking all my love along with them,” Steve rasped. “And I would be left empty.”
“Such a bold statement coming from someone who doesn’t know me,” Ryder laughed. “And you’re fine with taking him away from me? The noble Captain America pursuer of goodness is content with being a home-wrecker. He loves me, why are you so intent with embarrassing yourself like this?”
A doctor came in, holding a clipboard in her hand.  Steve looked at Rhodey and Pepper, who had just come at the right time. Rhodey led Pepper to a chair, beside Bruce who had his head tilted back. Pepper sat down and the doctor took that as her time to finally begin speaking.
Steve wondered if he could get Pepper to help him with changing the rhetoric around Tony’s image because Tony didn’t deserve this. He got so caught up in his thoughts that he didn’t realize Peter repeating his question to Miles who was looking on angrily at the television.
“Why? Why?” Ryder bemoaned. “I can do everything! I am the leader of the CMPNY. I have more power in my pinkie than you do in your entire being.”
Ryder didn’t particularly like that response. From there on, he became increasingly suspicious of Tony’s responses to him. It seemed like that month away had changed some things and he hadn’t even known what Steve had told Tony.
“We’re finished,” Steve said. “There are no more reasons to continue this interrogation. It’s over. You can’t hurt Tony anymore. And before this day is over I’ll make sure that you never even say Tony’s name again.”
Of course with his dear old dad and his saying of “Stark men are made of iron” that hadn’t gone over much well. So he kept everything bottled up, until Pepper and Rhodey suggested he try therapy after his kidnapping in Afghanistan.
Steve looked down at him and continued running his hands through Tony’s hair, giving him to gather himself. Tony curled his hands against the blanket and sighed.
“Yeah, and you were lying down for seventy years, but from what I heard you could basically run the first time you woke up. So Rogers put me down,” Tony asserted, though fingers tightened on Steve’s neck.
“Before I was interrupted, I was going to say that mine has a stable foundation. Even the winds of the mightiest force will not shake this. Even if I were to set Mjolnir hammer against its walls it shall not waver.”
“You know Stark-Rogers has always had a ring to it,” Tony said. “Get it ring. Because holy crap…I have a wedding ring. I’m engaged. Oh! I have to call Pepper and Rhodey. Everyone!”
“You can watch them play later okay. I promise,” Tony mumbled. Then looking down he realized that Miles had already fallen asleep on his shoulder. Tony tightened his grasp and looked to Steve. “Sorry, I need to put Miles to bed. Follow me?”
She exited the room, being quick to place the phone in her back pocket. She chose Luka, figuring he was the closet to a decent human being there and wouldn’t do anything to harm Tony least when he was asleep. She left him with simple commands and the parting instruction to tell Ryder she went to visit her grandmother.
Bucky placed the salt down. “Helps it boil faster. Now we just wait for the water to start boiling and then we can add the noodles. Hey, what’s that burning smell?”
She nodded her head a few times. “When I was nineteen my brother got his first serious girlfriend. He had been known as a player, so we were all shocked when this gorgeous lady tamed that player. It was like beauty and the beast. A freaking fairytale.”
“Any person would take time to forgive the transgressions of those idiots. Some wouldn’t find it in themselves to forgive at all.”
Steve shrugged. “I admit it was easier for me to leave and to never know what would happen if I actually fought for him…if I made him know that I thought I was better for him. Because what if I stayed and fought for Tony? What if I stayed and I became the person who destroyed Tony? But what if I fought for him and I lost him.”
It was like someone had dumped his body back into the cold bath water of the room. He felt hands pushing him down, trying to drown him. He pushed aimlessly at them. He could feel them at his shoulder and he twisted, nearly knocking himself down.
Or crap…maybe this will be part of the discussion. Tony had fought for the Accords and ramifying it to fit everyone’s needs…but he hadn’t fought much for claiming himself as an Avenger.
They had watched as Tony pulled in resources, spoke to DV advocates, gained partnerships with other shelters, and spoke to donors. He already had an amazing staff that of course went through not only Pepper’s intensive background search, but also Natasha’s slightly less legal method of insuring that the people they were hiring were good and honest individuals.
“Yeah, then you said you didn’t want any, when I asked. So in my mind I had already set that I was going to eat this all by myself. It’s not my fault your sweet tooth kicks in every hour of the day,” Tony sighed bringing his paper plate above his head.
I would just like to say thank you all who are commenting your words mean everything to me. There is simply nothing I can truly explain to how much I appreciate your words and am grateful. Even when you may offer critics they are done in such a kind and respectable manner and I just feel so blessed to have y'all as readers. To everyone who gave a kudo thank you so much. My heart feels that love and it brightens my day to know you all are enjoying it. To those who have bookmarked thank you for wanting this story to be a presence in your reading enjoyment.
Natasha took them, gave one to Tony and set one aside for herself. Then for Clint, she took his and poked the straw where it was supposed to go in.
Tony tried reasoning with the last bit of sense Ryder might have had. “Ryder I need you to let me go. I said no to your proposal and you need to accept that. I have a son…”
“I can either put you down in a wheelchair or carry you. However, I know fully well you cannot walk right now and that’s not a bad thing. It’s just you’ve been in this bed for a week and you haven’t really stretched your legs out yet.”
The day went by faster than Tony knew it. Spending it with Steve certainly did help. He thought to himself that he should have had thoughts of wanting to spend today with Ryder. But he could honestly say he was thankful that Ryder had been called to do work abroad. Tony hadn’t even imagined that a day like this could exist. Nearly a year ago he couldn’t even imagine going to the store with Steve without an argument. Now here he was enjoying this winter carnival with him and wishing that it didn’t have to end so soon.
“Oh, yes we definitely went. So we go to Amusement Park, yes. I had to pack snacks for Clint because as I previously mentioned he is a child. We go inside and somehow, someway in my bag are ten different juice boxes,” Natasha noted.
Without a second’s pause everyone simultaneously stopped breathing. Steve wasn’t Mr. Mean Bad One. His breath stuttered and he immediately reached for his phone to call Tony. It seemed like everyone had the same idea.
“But I won’t do that yet because I’m patient and the wait will be oh so worth it,” Steve whispered softly in his ear. “Granted I hope it won’t be that long of a wait.”
Tony wiggled back, noticing Steve still laying hard inside of him. “Always is with you. But I thought you were aiming to prove me wrong tonight. Care to up the ante and see how far you can go too?”
“I know,” he grinned as he watched her hand out the wristbands to the kids. Some of the volunteers began to help the little girls put them on. Once everyone had a wristband, Natasha threw one to Bucky and Clint.
“Guess, we’ll find out yeah,” Bruce said, whose arms were now full of an energetic child taking pieces of fruit out of his bowl.
Miles shook his head. “No, baba. It’s supposed to look like that,” he said growing frustrated. “Baba. Baba no.”
He pressed Tony’s hands tightly to his chest. “I have to leave because I can’t stay knowing that I’m the reason behind your nightmares. I can’t stay when I know my presence is still affecting you in a negative manner Tony. It breaks my heart.”
But with Steve basically being the antithesis to his own character, he had to reign in those instincts for a little while. He had to become a better version and let Steve slowly be warped into being the antagonist.
“Always…always tired here Steve. I want to go home and see my son,” Tony slurred. “Are you coming to get me? Ryder…Ryder told me you pr’bly forgot. I…I figured that…true, but don’t forget me please…I just want to see my bambino. I promise I’ll be good and I’ve been patient. Ryder…he…he likes my patience I think, said I was bad at it before. Tryna…tryna be good. Is that why you haven’t find me yet? Gotta wait til I’m good?”
Tony murmured, pouring the medicine into the spoon. “Okay, so medicine. Coughing medicine? Goodness, this stuff looks disgusting. I could probably make something that tastes and even smells better. FRIDAY put that on the list of things to do.”
Then Steve had the plans of just watching over Tony, at least until he fell asleep if he wasn’t already doing so.
“You will love me and then finally you’ll know how it feels to love someone that destroys you,” Ryder growled as he finally stood up from his spot on Tony’s body. “Hold him. And this Tony is where the fun begins.”
He had been dealt a few good things in his life, which he certainly hadn’t deserved. One of those things were Laura and the kids. The other was his membership in the Avengers and friendship with them. Another had been being friends with Tony.
“Since I can no longer just do it for you, I thought I would bring in a guest,” Ryder explained as he began taking off his shirt. “This is Winston. Not his real name, but we’ll go with that tonight.”
Miles shimmied into his pants as Tony helped button them. Once done, Tony moved to put on Miles’ shoes and then brush his hair. Satisfied with how Miles looked, Tony took his hand and led him to the kitchen.
“Oh, you were,” Steve replied with a large amount of enthusiasm. “I mean I’m sorry that the relationship didn’t end up how you wanted…”
Tony’s teeth suck into his lips, a moan escaping before his mouth had completely closed as Tony again got used to the feeling of fullness that Steve offered. Steve gave him a few more seconds to become adjusted, before getting the okay from Steve.
Tony turned wide eyes to Steve and Steve placed a comforting hand on Tony’s shoulder. Tony leaned into the touch and Steve had to force himself to separate in order to take out the packaged food.
As Tony laid asleep, tucked underneath Steve’s chin, Steve started wondering if he had done the right thing or if he should have done more.
Tony started laughing and scooted his body closer to Steve’s. “Please Steve you don’t need to pretend you aren’t happy I’m breaking up with Ryder.”
“Delusions? I am not delusional,” Ryder screeched, blood flowing easily as he stretched. “He loves me. He’s coming back. He always does. Even after the first time at Winston’s he came back. You don’t know him, Steve. He’s weak. He’ll break me out of here.”
He ran it delicately over the skin there, wiping away the remnants of vomit and tears on his face. He used that same one to wipe at the mess on the floor. He grabbed a few wipes and cleaned the rest of it, before throwing both towel and wipes into the trashcan. Steve went into the restroom and grabbed another towel and wet it with warm water. Steve ran the cloth over Tony’s forehead and cheeks, hoping to get some warmth back into his face. Tony’s shaking slowly subsided, with the added pressure of Steve wiping his face and his other hand rubbing soothing patterns onto the blanket covering him.
“Oh come on. I’m pretty sure this game is rigged. If I can throw my shield and hit my target, I am pretty sure I can toss a ring onto a soda bottle less than ten feet away from me,” Steve bemoaned.
Sending off a quick text to Harley, he wasn’t shocked when the young teen quickly knocked on the backseat door waiting for Steve to unlock the car.
“On one hand who are we to play judge, jury, and executioner you know? Like surely there are lines drawn and this…knowing he’s at the Raft should be enough. It is enough,” he quickly added looking at Steve.
Pepper reached out and grabbed his hand. “I know, but for all we know Natasha may not find anything.”
Tony stopped. “Ah, shit sorry. I know you don’t want to hear my fucked up childhood and early adulthood. Look that’s all in the past. It doesn’t really matter anymore. I mean I’ve been told it does, by my therapist on many occasions, but what does he know. Actually, scratch that he knows a lot. He’s actually nice. Probably need to schedule an appointment with him soon. I’ve missed a lot lately.”
Natasha chewed at her lip and looked toward Tony. Tony stared at her and battled with what he was going to say next. He knew what he wanted, but he didn’t know if he should. Besides did he want to be disappointed with her answer?
“You know Tony cried for you, when I got him to the state of drunken bliss. Kept moaning for his precious Steve to come.
Steve closed his eyes at the touch and moved his hands to Tony’s waist. Tony could almost see the blush fighting against the dirt on his cheeks as Clint gave out a whistle and Natasha began a slow clap. Both of them ignored the input from their teammates and just focused on each other.
Steve took notice of how his breathing had softened and his voice had gained a little bit of lightness. But he didn’t pay any more attention to it, instead going through the other pictures.
Tony looked ahead of him, toward the fountain. He watched as the colors transformed and was transfixed for a moment.
“Well that’s not a problem. Julia’s awesome and she could kick my ass even if she wanted to,” Harley sighed.
Tony laughed. “Alright ladies. This has been all, but fun. I’m ready to leave. I can pay you whatever Ryder is paying and more.”
Rhodey stretched out his legs. “Yeah, so they’ll probably be here soon and when they come I have to go to my PT.”
“So you used your son as an excuse to come back home,” Steve laughed as he began heating up the food and bringing out two plates.
“I was the one who taught you how to drive a car. I was the one who brought you home-made soup, when you were sick. I went to your awards’ ceremonies. So you may have all of these bad thoughts about me, but they will always be matched with all the good I did for you. And that’s going to conflict you for the rest of your life.”
Miles’ lips tugged downward and gestured toward his stuffed penguin and the Spiderman toy on the ground. Peter picked up the Spiderman toy, which Peter had given to him as a late birthday present. Miles had been fascinated with Spiderman lately and Peter was secretly pleased so he figured he could add to his toy collection.
“You know that Tony had fractured ribs, broken fingers, and much more. There were instances where there was damage done to the arc reactor. Ryder could have very well killed him,” Steve said and that admittance got stuck in his throat.
His eyes went toward his wrist and noticed it was bare. It shouldn’t…there’s no way. Every event that he went to he always carried some form of his armor on him. And that was through his watch, but it was gone. Panic seized him. Cali noticed his worry and shook her head.
Steve looked down and his heart seized in his chest. There Tony was in a similar position to when they first found him in that cold bedroom. His eyes were shut closed, tears streaming down his pale face. His shivering body was curled tightly fingers pressing close to his chest. Steve didn’t take much more time to observe his appearance, before he fell down to Tony’s place on the floor.
“Yeah, they’re taken care of. So now that you can rest easy with that, let me take care of you, yeah?”
“Look bambino I am not mad, but that scared me okay. I can fly because I have a suit that helps me. I can’t fly on my own. Please don’t scare me like that Miles. You cannot climb on things and jump from them, okay?”
Sharon narrowed her eyes at him. “You were looking fine just a second ago, when you were…oh…oh,” Sharon’s exclaimed. Her eyes widened and a bright smile grew on her face. “Are you brooding because you lost your talking companion?”
She sniffled and looked to where Diana and Miles were playing. “Don’t stay silent. Don’t let whoever is making you cry continue because they don’t change. They only manipulate you to think that they are until one day they snap completely and your son becomes an orphan.”
Shuri laughed. “Not particularly Peter, grow eight legs then get back to me on that. But stop trying to distract me. I know you have spider-senses and guess what I have Peter-is-about-to-get-into-some-deep-shit-senses.”
Steve had just come back from a two-week long mission and he was exhausted. He had literally come in not a few hours ago, freshly showered and deep dived head first into the bed. Tony had only known he had arrived shortly ago because he had just been on the edge of sleep, before finally being able to submerse into his dreams feeling Steve’s comforting presence near him.
His body became cold and he couldn’t feel air enter his lungs. But Ryder kept talking and kept his hand pressed against his back as they moved through the hallways. His body felt limp and the space around him felt distorted. He could hear Ryder talking and it felt soft and muffled against the disjointed mess going on in his mind.
Tony started to protest to an already standing Karen. Karen’s giggling made his way to his ears, before she landed a wet smack on his cheek. He pushed her away, his own laughter causing him to fold over himself as Karen began tickling him.
“Yeah, I mean I used to pretend that they were my real parents. I mean they were there more than my parents. I remember there was one summer my parents’ went on a trip to Spain and left me to be with Ana and Jarvis. That summer was the best and I told everyone that Ana and Jarvis were my mom and dad,” Tony laughed. “I was so fucking disappointed when I had to go back to being a Stark.”
If by any chance they felt themselves teetering on exposing anything, their mouths would form the words, “Benedici il CMPNY.”
“Hello?” Tony’s voice rang throughout the hallways. His brow furrowed as he caught on to the soft melody of music filtering throughout the rooms.
Miles shook his head and leaned up. “No, baba! Come on hurry! We have to get ready!” He jumped out of his bed and bounced on his feet, while holding Snuggles in one hand.
Ryder pushed Tony off of the bed. Tony’s shoulder gave a loud pop and he let out a loud cry of agony. Ryder looked down at him.
Natasha stayed silent for a few moments. “A few months ago it would’ve been a definite no. Now…it may be a maybe. I’m not sure. For so long I pushed that side of me that ever wanted to be a parent away. It’s what’s necessary for us in our job positions. Then seeing Tony with Miles…well a part of me wants that. Then seeing those girls,” Natasha broke off.
“Right, so she reaches out. Mind you she’s about four feet tall and Clint snatches the juice box out of her hand and I quote, he says,” Natasha paused, making sure she had Tony’s full attention, which she did. “If you don’t back up from me now little girl, this straw will go straight through your hand. I can open a juice box on my fucking own. Ooops, sorry bad word. Don’t say that.”
But Tony wasn’t handling it was he? He should have known that with how he found him on the floor that day in the hospital. Steve pressed at his heart, hating how it sank to his stomach and infused with the swirling bouts of anger, fear, and sadness.
“Apparently he thought tonight would be a perfect night to propose. Welcome to your engagement party,” Natasha said.
“Steve I am now going to need you to watch that show with me whenever I watch it. I need your commentary.”
Miles looked up at him grinning and said, “It was so much fun! Mrs. Frederick let us do free draw today in art class and I drew the whole solar system. She even showed it to the whole class and asked to hang it up on the wall. But I said no, cause I wanted baba and you to see it first. Then I’ll let her have it and she said that’s okay she can wait.”
Natasha nodded seemingly pleased with how the conversation had been going. “So is part of your plan moving back in?”
“Sorry,” Tony said curling into himself. “Sorry. I’m sorry. Don’t know why I…don’t know why I did that.”
Natasha’s cheeks turned bright red, but as soon as they flushed they quickly went back to its normal coloring.
“That’s Peter!” Miles exuberantly announced, loud enough for the whole audience to hear. “Look baba it’s Peter! Hi Peter!” He stood up on Tony’s lap and waved.
“It’s okay. You’re safe sweetheart. You’re safe,” Steve whispered as he led them out of the room, trying not to think of how much he failed Tony that he had to rely on some dream version to find him, with no hopes of the real Steve ever doing so.
“Yes. My conditions are set. If my conditions are not met you will have to be my backup in getting T’Challa to agree to let me go to Coachella.”
“You certainly outdid yourself,” Tony suggested. “Some of these meals I haven’t even seen, since like forever.”
Bucky ran a hand through his hair as he watched Natasha slowly calm him down. When Steve gained awareness of his surroundings, Natasha stood up and went back to her seat.
Steve hissed at the image of Tony being water boarded again. The others in the conference by then had tried listening into the conversation, but it was hard with it not being on speaker.
Tony fished out his phone from his coat pocket. “Yeah, but with Miles at home I like to always keep my phone on vibrate. Sorry, let me just see what this is about.”
This time when he was pulled up he heard the door creak open. His eyes couldn’t focus, but he felt good when a blanket covered him. It didn’t stop the shivering, but it did help keep him warm. He heard doors slam and people yelling at one another. He heard a voice screaming at Miriam.
He looked and saw the door was still cracked and that the television was providing a nice source of light.
“And he was, my first kiss. At least the first guy I ever kissed. It happened during a party. He was drunk and he probably forgot that he had told me. It was less than ideal because his mouth tasted strong like alcohol and a mixture of everyone else he had been hooking up with,” Tony inserted. “But it didn’t matter to me because it felt perfect. I felt myself falling in love.”
He was just about to speak up and see if Tony was about to continue his story, until he looked down at the man under him. Steve knew there was more to the story, but he could see Tony’s eyes strain to stay awake. He smoothed out the lines in his forehead, from him trying to force himself to stay awake.
The man placed the items near Tony and turned to leave. Tony picked up the bouquet of roses and frowned at it. Then he held the letter in his hand and saw it was addressed to him. Surely, Natasha wasn’t sending him gifts. He set the roses aside and Miles took one out and started to observe it.
“Sorry, Tony swore he wouldn’t do anything to crazy while I took a nap,” Rhodey replied. “Though after several years of knowing him, I should have none that wasn’t possible. That’s on me. Hey Tony!”
Pepper rattled off the questions back and forth and noticed with a quiet happiness how they for once were just listening…well until Clint spoke up.
Natasha looked down at him softly, brushing back a stray hair that had fallen as Clint argued about the hole in the wall. Tony knew without a doubt it was from when Clint tried seeing how fast he could throw an apple at Bruce. He didn’t know how the challenge had started, but he knew it ended up with the apple creating a sizeable dent in their hallway wall.
Clint clenched his jaw and turned to face the wall. Natasha sighed deeply at the childlike behavior of her friend.
Tony refused to meet Bucky’s eyes while he was saying any of this. Instead he trained his eyes on the point where his ankles were crossed on Bucky’s lap.
Steve laughed too, the noise causing his chest to vibrate under Tony’s ears. Steve ran his fingers down Tony’s back, fingers gently teasing as where Tony had grown soft and tender.
Peter cut his eyes to the woman and bit his lip so as to not say anything disrespectful. He found it dryly amusing she was saying that he and Harley were not quite respectable, while she was the least respectable in this room. Peter waited for Tony to defend himself, but he didn’t. If possible Tony seemed to take the accusation as truth. Now that Peter was not going to allow himself to be silent on.
Nick Fury had gotten in touch with them before they landed in America and had laid out heavy instructions to meet with him as soon as they reached land. Clint had complained profusely saying all he wanted was to go home to Laura and his kids. Steve had been sympathetic. If Steve had left someone he loved for six months with no contact and it was his fault for that lack of communication, he would grow mad.
Winston let out a ragged breath as his body bowed over. Ryder bit at his neck. “I want you to show him what he’ll get with another man that isn’t me. You got it?”
Tony felt the walls cave in on him. He wanted to propose in public? He didn’t know why he was surprised seeing as how Ryder truly didn’t know anything about him. Natasha placed a hand on his cheek.
Clint, Thor, and Sam had by then also followed. All of them were content to wait until Steve gave them an order. Something.
“Bucky I am sure you think what you are saying is justified, but this is already costing me. Tony is
He shook those thoughts out of his head, resolute to not spend any more time thinking about the past. The past often took him in his dreams, they had no place to exist in the now with him.
Tony sat back comfortably, nursing a cup of orange juice that had mysteriously wound up in his hands. His mouth was tilted up in an honest genuine smile as he watched the children run back and forth through the house. There were instances where he had to warn them not to run because he had seen some of the smaller children trip.
“Anymore,” Marley drawled, taking back on her accent. “And my dear that’s not impressive seeing as how you only stopped a year ago, when you were twelve.”
“No, it’s no problem. Your singing is amazing. However, I don’t want to be late, so I think I’ll follow May. It was nice meeting you,” Tony said bidding a quick goodbye to Miles.
Even though Jarvis had died of natural causes, he still left. His absence was the worst, Tony noted.
No Ryder…hadn’t even looked mildly surprised by Natasha’s words. Instead he seemed oddly fine with her statement as thought it was of no meaning to him.
Steve closed his eyes and walked near Bucky. He knew that Tony was asleep, but he didn’t want their voices to bring him out of it. After all that had been going on, Tony needed all the rest he could afford.
Tony listened to the harshness of Ryder’s voice and raised his hands in defense. “Fine,” he muttered sliding into the backseat.
Miles laughed and this time swallowed all his medicine. “Cookie?” He made grabby hands at Tony and snuggled closer to him, once Tony picked him back up again.
He looked at the phone placed in his lap and sighed. The lady on the television said they would be arriving back in America in two more months. She didn’t say if they were coming back to the Tower Tony made sure was ready for them when they returned. So Tony placed the phone in the box he’s kept it in. He locked it and placed a few files over it.
“Goodness, Tony. This might be the winner of all the holes in the Avengers tower. Did the Hulk make a guest appearance some time or did Thor’s hammer find its way kissing the wall,” Clint joked, eyeing the dent not aware to how Tony’s body was starting to get cold.
He wondered at what point he had stopped acting. The emotions had certainly become real, even if the words coupled with them had no ounce of truth to them.
But despite Tony thinking he was able to hide his feelings, Steve had become somewhat well-versed in the media portrayal of Tony.
Tony instead poured some apple juice for Miles and gave it to him. “No coffee, until you’re well into your 20s. Don’t want you relying on coffee like your old man. Trust me, it’s a hard habit to break.”
“Oh, testy I see. Jealous that I was the one who Tony let into his heart and in between his thighs. Don’t worry, he’s an easy lay. If you want him, he’ll spread his legs easily for you.”
Steve watched as Bucky followed Clint into the jail cell where Natasha was waiting for them. Steve fell to his knees as soon as the door was closed and rubbed the palms of his hands into his eyes cursing away the tensing pain filling in them.
“Maybe you should tell Tony this Clint and realize that while we may think we don’t deserve these people in our lives, doesn’t mean we don’t need them,” Natasha explained.
“Have a nice night,” Leauna said, winking at them. “I’ll be expecting you to come visit me again as soon as possible.”
Bucky open his mouthed to say Tony shouldn’t have said any of those things to him. He was to blame. He didn’t deserve anyone’s forgiveness certainly not Tony’s. But he couldn’t…he couldn’t say these things because he desperately wanted them to be true. Steve had often told him it wasn’t his fault, but that was Steve. Steve who refused to see Bucky as anything, but the Bucky who fought beside him and grew up with him.
“Always,” Pepper said leaning over to hug him and Rhodey joined as well. “Have a nice night. Love you.”
Bucky pulled his shoulders toward his neck as if being reprimanded and Steve became angry with Pepper making Bucky feel this way.
His shoulder made a sickening crunch and he had no doubt that if his ribs hadn’t been broken, they were sure to have been broken now.
“Yeah, we don’t need to know what happened in order to still be here for you and give you whatever you need,” Pepper added then stopped.
Steve nodded as he went to follow Tony, but not before Bucky and Harley were making kissing faces at him. Steve internally hoped Tony wouldn’t turn away and see those faces or just how red Steve’s face had gotten.
There was something haunting about his expression and something that screamed loss. Steve wondered briefly if he should be the one to reach out and offer some amount of comfort, seeing as though no one else was around him. He figured it ought to be lonely waiting to hear good news or bad news by oneself.
Natasha leaned back in his chair. “If only you had realized this sooner, we wouldn’t be in this position. As cliché as it is, I assume it is better late than never.”
But looking at him now like this made him want things to be better this time. With his face close to Tony’s, he could see him starting to sweat. He had no idea where the temperature was in his room, so he made motions to take off this heavy sweatshirt Tony had been wearing. He had been wearing a lot of them lately even when it was warm in the building.
“And I know correlation doesn’t imply causation, but like can you just…You know what never mind it’s probably stupid. I’m fine to sleep alone. Besides Miles will most likely come in here later because-”
“You don’ love me no more.” Miles whispered. “Sally said we come back here when our daddies and mommies didn’t love us no more.”
“Please, I can’t live like this. Like knowing that Ryder isn’t here. I don’t know, if I’ll make it another day. He is…was everything that I had. He was the one that needed and wanted me. He always told me he was the only one that was never going to leave me. Now look at us, he’s gone. But…if I’m right…Ryder…please don’t make me live another day without you…please.”
Someone must have cleaned his room at some point, as evidenced by the feel of new sheets. Maybe he would get FRIDAY to tell him later, so he could send them some fruit basket or something.
Tony’s breaths deepened and Ryder leaned forward on his knees. “Let me take care of you Tony. Let me be the one not to leave you like the others did. Like Steve did.”
With one look at Steve, Bruce shook his head. “I need to go, before I do something I…actually may not regret.”
Bucky had no doubt about that. He knew and now the others were about to realize just how ruthless Steve could get, when someone came across a person he loved. Bucky had been there on two separate occasions and without a doubt, Bucky knew this would be the worst one.
“I mean he is an Avenger, so he should have been able to leave, if he really so desired. My brother could have easily been overpowered,” Isak announced. “My brother isn’t that strong.”

So without saying a word, he turned on his heels and headed back to the interrogation room. He only saw Phil sitting there, staring at Ryder from the one-way mirror. He brought his face up to meet Steve’s. His eyes flickered to the others, as they had followed without a word.
Also Black Panther has me physically shook and I want to send marriage proposals to practically everyone in that movie.
Biting the insides of his cheeks, Ryder looked behind him to where Steve had walked away. Okay, so Steve was added back in. There needed to be simple adjustments made. He didn’t know where Steve had gathered this confidence, but he knew it could be easily broken. Because somewhere in that conversation Steve had revealed himself. Ryder grew excited over what he picked apart in the inflictions and expressions of Steve.
Bucky wondered if Clint could see the same. But looking at Clint now, whose eyes had widened curiously, Bucky knew that this team had never seen what Steve was capable of. But now Clint was getting a front row seat to it all.
“And you know that’s all it will ever be, right? A fantasy. People like Steve don’t go after people like you. There’s simply too much of you to handle. You think he likes you because you shared a funnel cake, did some exercise together, and he gave you this bracelet?”
“No, I’m leaving the tower and I’m going to stay with Sam until Bucky and I can find our own place.”
Tony shook himself out of the memory and pushed himself away from Ryder. He wasn’t going to let him do this to himself tonight. He was having a great time. Bruce and Thor were back. Rhodey and Pepper were here. Nothing was going wrong. Nothing.
At first it had been his skills in battle. Then when he learned about his art, Tony was always commissioning him for something to put in his lab even if it was just a sketch of DUM-E. Tony would smile at him, brightly eyes searching to make sure Steve was alright and taken care of.
And it sounded stupid, but Tony felt like Steve was weightless in those moments and even the weight resting on his chest was grounding. He liked the fact that the same comfort he could find in Steve’s arms, Steve felt the same.
He hated how soon after that he had to remodel his entire floor and nearly almost all of the main floor just to erase the footprints and hand prints Ryder had left behind. Never mind the fact that the hand prints and footprints on Tony’s body were healing as well, some only but a faint shadow on his tan skin.
Tony shook his head. “Nothing. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like something was taken away from me and I should know what, but I don’t. It scares me,” he admitted.  “It scares me that I let…”
Steve didn’t even say a departing word to the girl before he was bounding over to Miriam’s holding cell where they had her gagged. Steve ripped the cloth from her mouth and she turned sharp eyes to him.
“Nothing,” Tony hissed. “Out of all the people in this room, who’s exactly holding me hostage and forcing themselves-”
“I don’t know what you are implying,” Tony exclaimed. “I am actually very happy that you are available to be here. I was just surprised because you said that you wouldn’t be back until the fifth of January. However, I can show you later just how thankful I am that you’re here, when we get back home.”
“Oh, yeah? By the end of this week I would like a report. Do not disappoint me Parker,” Shuri laughed.
Sam looked up at her as though remembering that she had come to his house for something. Sam frowned then smoothed out his features. Natasha noted the tension laden in his features. Bucky was nearly a mirror image. Natasha breathed in to calm herself.
“Look, you’re not alone. All of us are going to help with moving forward. I mean we still have those group therapy sessions and hey don’t look at me like that,” Bucky announced as he looked at Steve’s wincing.
“Miles who is that? Tell them what you told me” Peter said turning on the television to a channel that was discussing the engagement party of Tony Stark and Ryder Deaver. The two entertainment talk show hosts were betting on whether Tony would say yes to the proposal or not, all the while talking about Ryder’s accomplishments, but not once talking about Tony in a good light.
“Well, you are lucky. I have just the venue that opened up that will fit this life-changing decision. My men and women will be fit to work alongside those of your CMPNY to give you more muscle. Though I do want a front row seat to the destruction of Stark,” the voice quipped. “It will be joyfully wondrous to see his damnation.”
“No, ummm I’m actually dating Ryder. I don’t know why my son said that,” he corrected. He felt his heart rate increase at the mere idea of Ryder getting word that Miles had said Steve loves him. He knew it wasn’t true, but that wouldn’t stop Ryder from thinking so. So he had to correctly address that before the woman went off talking about that.
“Set aside the penguin, please. I’ll be back to pick it up later,” Tony said as he stepped aside letting the other group who was waiting to move forward.
“He’s already left babe. Better luck trying to convince him he can’t drive, once he takes his test next month,” Tony said.
He didn’t know what happened next. He just remembered water, bodies being thrown against walls, and bones crunching.
“Oh, come on you’ve kept him with you hole up for far too long,” Natasha said, following Clint into the room and throwing herself down onto Tony’s bed.
“No, Tony did not leave. You all came and retrieved him from the little confines that my brother kept him in.”
“Now, me. I’m personally hoping you get the one that kills you,” Tony honestly replied. “And part of me hopes that you don’t ever take the pills and just remain in this sad state of never-ending pain.”
Tony continued to go about their plans, voice hitching and petering out as Steve’s fingers and mouth continued to play him like an instrument Steve only knew how to play. Steve pressed forward with four fingers, a feat only possible since Tony was still nicely stretched out.
Jaime, who had been holding one of the younger toddlers came by Tony. “So I’m pretty certain Ms. Natasha’s little spies voted for you and that’s a considerable amount.”
Tony turned to look at Steve who was gazing at his friends with a sort of reserved amusement only those three could inspire.
“Well, I’ll just have to tell Mr. Penguin that I missed him as well,” Tony said. “Have you been good, while I was gone?”
Steve bent over and held a hand to his chest. “Tony that’s not true. You have a lot of people who care. I love you. Miles loves and misses you like crazy. I caught Peter looking at his vlog videos of the two of you all night. Natasha was sitting in your lab, while she went through files. We care about you Tony.”
“No, Miles. We are not getting the fruit snacks. You already had a cupcake for breakfast. Don’t you want some delicious broccoli and carrots?”
Tony shakily nodded, placing his hands over the ones that Steve had on his face. Steve leant down to kiss him on the cheek. Tony pushed his body a few inches away and motioned to the empty spot beside him. Steve looked concerned, having noticed the bruises and the way Tony flinched in pain as he moved his torso. However, Tony looked at him unwaveringly.
Tony imagined that Natasha had thought he hadn’t heard her last statement and he decided not to respond to that. After all, he wouldn’t even know what to exactly say.
Tony looked back at her baffled. Steve’s touch didn’t last long enough to leave a…okay know what never mind Steve did go back to a few certain spots on his neck and collarbone. Steve looked at where Natasha was placing the foundation on his neck and Tony watched as his breath quickened and eyes darkened.
Steve jumped a little in his spot then turned sheepishly toward Sharon. “Sorry Sharon. Were you saying something?”
“I wish you wouldn’t talk to me that way,” Ryder bemoaned. He roughly leaned over and began to put Tony’s pants on, before throwing him back on the bed. “But since you want to talk back and think that I’m just some mean person…I’ll show you just how spiteful I can get.”
The voicemail cut off. It seemed Tony hadn’t gotten to correcting his voicemail as Pepper had suggested. He called the phone a few more times and each time the phone reached the voicemail. One time it didn’t even ring, but went straight to voicemail.
“It’s the ramblings of a mad man,” Bucky spoke, watching inside the cell with a narrow speculative expression. “There’s no sense in staying any longer.”
Tony woke with a slow awareness of himself. First he stretched out his legs, thankful that he didn’t feel the stinging numbness in them as he usually had for the last few weeks. Then he stretched his arms beside his body, making sure he could curl his fingers into the cool sheets. He wanted to make sure all parts of his body were able to move, that he hadn’t been drugged or those patches weren’t on his body.
“Well this has turned out lovely as always,” Pepper greeted kissing him on the cheek. “And it is nice to see that your former teammates are here.”
“Tony sweetheart listen to me. I’m going to find you, I just need you to hold on for me okay,” Steve urgently commanded, not caring anymore since Ryder knew he was on the line. “You hear me? Tony? Tony? Ryder I swear to you if you have-”
“Not former Pep,” Tony said looking at the table where all the Avengers were sitting. He had extended the invitation to everyone, seeing as though it’d be another way to get the Avengers back in a positive light in the public eye.
Tony hung his head down and channeled the theatre lessons he took, during boarding school. Tears sprang into his eyes.
Fury’s eye grew bright with anger. “I’d like you to remember Barton that Tony is not the reason you had to run off in exile, but he is the reason you are back here. Do not keep putting the blame on him because you are unwilling to be an adult and accept the repercussions of your actions. Do not talk about the man who has been protecting your family, when you’ve been fighting in a battle that didn’t even involve you.”
Bucky began to speak some words to him, letting his Brooklyn accent get through. He tried repeating the nursery rhyme Ms. Rogers would say to Steve, whenever he was high with fever. Bucky was sure that he was missing a few words, but as Steve’s eyes slowly became more aware he figured that didn’t matter too much.
Natasha rolled her eyes. “All I hear are excuses. You’re believing the words of someone you don’t know, someone you don’t trust over the words of Tony. The only thing that explains this is that you think it’s easier for yourself to just walk away. Were you looking for an out ever since you stepped in the tower?”
Eventually, groups had to be broken up and volunteers began to take their kids to their respective places. Steve had left Tony briefly to help assist in making sure the kids were in their appropriate meeting spot. Peter had handed Miles off to Tony as he went to go with the older kids who were preparing to have their own fun at the carnival free from the responsibilities of watching their kids.
He had to be an example for Miles. He didn’t want to become like his mother, who let Howard run over her and allowed Tony to watch on. He didn’t want Ryder to one day direct his anger toward Miles either. That was his greatest fear.
“Steve, I didn’t tell you so that you could persuade me to change my mind,” Bekah explained. “My decision is set. I’m applying and if accepted I have about three weeks before I leave.”
They had pushed aside those curious feelings that were whelming inside of them. There would be time later and if not there would be time later to at least dream again those dreams Tony had long since buried.
“You don’t have to be physically strong in order to manipulate someone. And surely as his brother, you were a victim of this covert manipulation as well. It probably started off as emotional manipulation and or abuse. Your brother was a masochistic. He was verbally, physically, and mentally abusive. And for you to defend him is for you to be complacent in his actions. I am sure neither your wife nor children will appreciate you supporting your brother’s actions.”
At the time, Tony was swept away with what he saw as genuine care. But he also knew he was sticking with Dr. Sana so he told Ryder no. He was not going to stop any progress he was steadily making. He was still going to continue his sessions with Dr. Sana. That resulting flash of anger in his eyes should have tipped him off, but Tony was so blinded by having his friend come back and actually wanting to be in a relationship with him.
“This is not up for discussion. Midtown High does not condone this behavior and to be frank I am letting you off easy with no suspension,” Principal Davis admitted.
Tony immediately stopped his rambling and placed the fruit snack box back. Miles turned slowly to Steve and frowned. It seemed as though he looked at Steve in betrayal for telling on him. Tony got what he came for on that particular aisle and went to the next one.
He scrunched up his face at Natasha’s worried glance. Natasha hooked her fingers around the back of his neck, meeting a patch. She smoothly took it off and watched Tony’s eyes blink to stay awake. Natasha did everything she could to make sure Tony wouldn’t fall asleep. Looking at the blood slowly trailing from his temple, he might have had a concussion.
Steve’s heart sank and he held back from collecting Tony into his arms, but at the same time he wanted nothing more than to find Ryder and put his shield through his neck. Tony kept babbling a mixture of this being a dream then altered into screams of him not wanting anyone to touch him.
As soon as Tony left the room, Isa was going to give these people a reality check and give them all hell.
Steve followed Natasha and went to go sit back in his chair. Sam had entered again and brought biscuits and breakfast and sat silently in the recliner. Sam didn’t say anything to break the silence.
“You know this is very romantic what Steve is doing for Tony,” Sam said, pushing the cooler to the side of the table.
“Yeah, the greatest moment was when you told her mom that her daughter shouldn’t be going around offering to open a stranger’s juice box,” Natasha claimed. “Needless to say we were kicked out of the amusement park and if it weren’t for some big payoff I’m pretty certain Clint would have made headlines with a picture of him holding a juice box by a sobbing little girl.”
Steve shook his head. “Hey, no this isn’t meant to make you feel sorry for me and forgive me easily. I’m sorry I didn’t mean that and-”
However, Tony knew he needed help. He always knew, he just never knew when he needed to go or who he could actually turn to at least until Isa suggested one of her co-workers Dr. Sana. The Accords ramifications already implemented that the Avengers would have to agree to therapy, but Tony had plans of brushing it off until Isa made him promise to at least try.
“Okay, preoccupied child. Red and gold headphones. You think you’re cute, right? I don’t like kids very much, but I have to admit its adorable seeing him with Iron Man headphones. Soft thighs,” Ryder softly muttered so as to not let anyone hear.
This…this is what Peter imagined when he became Spiderman. He wanted the chance to expand his family. And looking at Tony absentmindedly run his fingers through Steve’s hair, watching Bucky debate with Tony about how he didn’t need lasers in his new arm, laughing at Bruce turn bright red as Harley tried setting up a dating profile for him…was simply all he ever dreamed of.
So update on the fic's progress. We are more than halfway done because I promised myself this fic would not go over 40 chapters. Guys, I'm so sad that it's almost over, but I'm also excited to share the upcoming chapters because its' going to get good (also with the promised comfort and happy ending).
Helen looked at them and noticed their desperation. She sighed and pinched the bridge of her nose, hating how Tony had been taken apart like this. She looked back to her clipboard then back to him.
So why would he sit here and let Ryder destroy all that happiness. Sure, Ryder had been a source of happiness recently…but at what point does it become too much? And now he has all of
Ryder turned slowly to him, excusing himself from talking to the lady at the front desk. “I do. However, every now and then I’ll have to come in and give my expertise. The hospital board wanted me to give a demonstration this morning to a couple of residents. What are you doing here?”
“I’m exhausted Steve. It’s been months…and I’m still feeling like I’m not back to myself. I can’t,” Tony stopped speaking, not really confident in his ability to explain what he was feeling. And he didn’t have the energy to try finding the correct words that wouldn’t have Steve up all night trying to take care of him.
“Alright does everyone have their given wristbands on? Raise your hand if you have not been given a wristband that matches your group leaders’ shirt colors,” Tony instructed as he went through the heard of children and volunteers.
Steve tightened his hold on Tony as Tony reached up to rub furiously at the tears that were threatening to fall.

Tony watched on with dazed eyes as Steve completed the task. Steve noticed the attention, but did not stop his actions. Tony pressed his back into the cabinet doors and drew his legs closer to himself. His lips were pressed into a thin line as he turned his hands toward himself as if examining the damage.
Unfocused eyes met his and he flinched away from Steve. Steve winced at the response and curled in on himself. The two stared at each other silently for a few minutes not quite sure knowing what to do. Steve watched as the focus slowly appeared back in Tony’s eyes. Tony watched as Steve grew closer to getting off the couch and leaving.
Peter and Tony continued talking for a few more minutes. Then a moment of comfortable silence settled between the two. Both watched as Miles and a few other kids indulged in playing a game of tag. Peter leaned back into the bench and chewed on his bottom lip. He side-eyed Tony and wondered if he should say what he’s been wanting to say for a while.
