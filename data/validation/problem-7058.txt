Tony wished he could have found the words to express how anxious he felt, but nothing came to mind as he finally felt the plane he rode in begin to descend. It was almost time to fight again, and suddenly all those butterflies that had gone from his stomach, thanks to Steve, returned full force and made him gag only briefly. If was being honest with himself, he was terrified of what was to come.
Steve chuckled. "I hardly expected this all to be easy for you. From what I've heard about you, you've more impressed me than anything. Your inventions are amazing things, in fact, one of the prosthetic models you designed helped my best friend after he lost his arm while we were deployed overseas. We joined the army right out of high school."
“I don’t mind. Seeing an alpha down there is doing wonders for my inflated ego.” Tony wiggled his hips, “And knowing that my scent is going to stick with you all day really turns me on.”
When they found the source, Tony’s eyes widened at the intense heat that suddenly blasted against his face. It wasn’t as intense as the explosion, but it was close. He stepped back a little, then grew angry and shot the man wielding flame throwers that were blasting fire in a very specific direction. The fire stopped almost immediately, or at least the fire coming out of the flame throwers stopped. The man
The two soon had their drinks in hand and were watching those who were dancing to the music. Tony shuffled closer to Steve, almost leaning on him as his eyes caught sight of Peggy. She looked like she was at least trying to enjoy the dance with Bucky, though she didn’t look miserable. At least it was better than standing outside in the cold.
“Fuck, please.” Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck, “You like me calling you Captain, or so you have a real name you’d prefer me to cry out when you hit me deep?”
“He’ll be back,” she said. “He needs to get those tags back from you if he plans on becoming an actual soldier.”
“It’s the least I can do after scaring you so bad you smacked your face into a mirror.” Steve held his hand out for Tony to take.
Steve made a sigh that sounded slightly annoyed. "I can't believe 70 years have gone by and omega rights haven't changed. It's not like omegas are harming anybody if they have more freedom."
“You almost gave Steve a heart attack,” Bucky said with a smirk as he walked towards the flaming chunks of tank. “Commandos, search through the parts of the base not burning and gather any information on the last Hydra base.”
The door behind the woman opened again, and several armored soldiers came in with hats on their head and cords connected to their ears. Steve backed several steps away, alarmed at the preparedness the woman had for herself. The strange soldiers approached him and tried to calm him, but Steve was having none of it. He grabbed the two who tried to handcuff him and threw them through the wall. The wall gave way easily, and Steve jumped through the new hole he had created. A screen with an image of New York was set up behind the window that had been in the room.
“I slept a little during the night. Couldn’t fall asleep that much until like five I think. I slept pretty good after that.”
“Why don’t you sit down and relax while you wait,” James suggested. “You work too hard sometimes, just like Tony.”
It was late, and many shops had already closed for the night, so for the first time in his life, Tony found himself standing outside a 24/7 Walmart. He blinked dumbly up at the building, “Never been to one of these before. I thought this was just a grocery?”
Tony smiled, thinking of when he would see Steve again. He’d probably run to the alpha and hug him tight, maybe pull him down for a long kiss and drag him off to some broom closet again to get a little intimacy from him.
“I’m surprised you don’t know at this point,” he responded. “Though I suppose since he’s an omega and you’re a beta, there would be a few differences… Tony, when was your last heat?”
Tony was quick to pull his head back enough so he was still on Steve’s cock but wasn’t close to the knot. He took in every drop of Steve’s cum, groaning as it hit the back of his throat. There was a hell of a lot of cum, but Tony took it all into his mouth and swallowed, making a face at the bitter taste once he took his mouth off of Steve.
"Ugh, fine." Tony threw his hands up in the air as he stood up, heading back to his bedroom. "If you try to make a move on me though, I'm kicking your ass out and dumping you."
“The suit isn’t the hard part,” Tony reassured his alpha, looking up with wide eyes. “I have everything planned out for the suit already, I just need a few nights to complete it, without my dad knowing of course. I can have it ready long before the next mission, and I’m a quick learner! I want to go through all that training.”
Tony’s breath hitched in his throat as his eyes widened. He hadn’t known how seriously he had been injured until that moment, and he was thrown into a panic attack all over again. His shaking hands reached up to touch his chest, but before he could really touch the skin, a wave of intense pain that took his breath away jolted through Tony’s body. He cried out weakly as he fell forward onto the floor, clutching his chest as best as he could. New tears sprang up from his eyes as he struggled to breathe and stop shaking. He was terrified of what was going to happen to him. Not even the lingering scent of his alpha could calm him as he panicked on the floor, stripped of almost all his clothes and feeling colder than before.
The door opened to the room Steve was in, and his eyes darted up to the woman who walked in. A tall beta with long dark hair and a smile that seemed fake. Steve lowered his eyebrows just as little as he felt a growl form in his throat.
The brunet lowered his eyebrows. “Is that really how you see your own son? Just another omega to look pretty for the alphas? Do you know how hard it really is to fight off alphas who want to get under my clothes and do unspeakable things to me? No, because you’re just a beta. You don’t get to know what it’s like to have hormones fly into your face just from having a horny alpha walk by and look you over.”
“It’d be a miracle if he gets a break from active duty. Sure he’s got his own missions and items to take care of, but we are still in the middle of a war. Active duty terms change during war.”
Steve smiled and hugged his omega close. “Well, I suppose it's good to know that you can take care of yourself when I’m not around to take care of you.”
Tony eventually fell asleep to the sound of Steve telling him how loved he was and how much he meant to the alpha. It was soothing enough to relax him and let him rest as long as he needed. He didn’t even wake up when Steve was able to get up and clean up the both of them. He slept through Steve putting a blanket over him and Maria bringing by their food and water to keep their energy up. He even slept through Steve leaving briefly to join Maria and Jarvis for dinner. Tony’s exhaustion let him sleep well past when the sun went down, when his preheat finally hit and prepared his body for his full heat. Having Steve around in rut cause his preheat to last much shorter than usual, and when his body shifted over into full heat, Tony instinctively shifted around in his sleep and built up the nest just a little more, making him feel safer as he slept.
alpha before too long. Maybe even as soon as his next heat which was just a few weeks away if it came on time.
“Come on, you’ll learn very soon.” The dark skinned alpha patted Steve’s shoulder reassuringly before continuing to guide him back to a room that was closed off from the rest of the medical facility. Several medical professionals were running in and out of the room, but with the few glimpses Steve could get inside,  his heart rate started to go up, and he let out a whine, letting his pain be known to the other alpha.
Tony beamed at him, accepting his arm before guiding him further down the aisle of cameras so that his limo could pull away to make room for the next arrival.
“My tough little omega.” Steve smiled and was about to lean down to kiss Tony when Peggy interrupted again.
Tony shrugged. “You’re still not letting anyone else redesign your suit. Which, by the way, is it too early for me to start doing that? Because if I have to see this suit one more time on you, I’m going to barf.”
Tony cried silently as he received a string of vibrations from his ring, thinking of how badly Steve had wanted to stay with him instead of return to London.
Tony managed to crack a small smile, pulling his alpha’s head down to kiss his forehead. “I love you so much, Steve. I can’t wait for us to get married and have a family. I want us to be happy.”
“Well, I try not to let work come with me to hang out at a friend’s place, but I guess I can’t help it sometimes.”
“Don’t crowd them too much, Ms. Carter,” the medic said as he approached Howard. “My god… what happened here, Mr. Stark?”
Surely they’d be together again by the end of the day and could cuddle up together on a sofa and drink hot coffee together.
Tony kicked a scrap piece of metal as hard as he could, facing the door when his father stepped in. Howard took one look around the room, then raised an eyebrow at his son.
Tony chuckled and stepped forward, popping up on his toes to kiss Steve. "I forgive you, you big dumb alpha. Just make sure I'm the only one you kiss, okay?"
The omega purred a little bit at the praise. Briefly he was reminded of how much he missed Steve and the way he’d praise him after every little thing he did.
“Not at all,” Thor reassured. “I love meeting new friends, especially if an old friend has taken an interest.”
Tony excitedly jumped into the car when they were out back of the theater Steve had just performed in. Tony had wanted to drive so bad, but he never was allowed to because of his father believing in the ways of old. Besides, it was illegal for omegas to drive, vote, or even buy alcohol without the consent of an alpha, and even then, the alpha did all the work anyways, so really the omegas couldn’t do anything but watch their alphas do things for them. Unless, of course, it was house-keeping or raising the family, by which the omega was always responsible. Not things Tony really ever wanted to do.
“Steve’s ring. I gave him a ring for Christmas, and I have one that matches it.” Tony weakly brought his hand up out of the blankets for his father to see. The ring looked like it was barely holding on. “I made these rings… they are linked through wireless networking frequencies. It’s something I came up with… I have the notes on it in my desk if you’re interested.”
“What’s he gonna do? Lecture your ears off?” Tony shook his head and grabbed his now refilled drink. “I doubt anything will happen to you.”
"Well after not seeing each other for a while, I can't say I'm surprised you're like this." Steve caught Tony's lips in a heated kiss, hands roaming and pulling at clothing.
Steve had never been a huge fan of sticking around large crowds and looking pretty for them. Even in the army, when locals would swarm him to thank him for his service, he was never really comfortable. Steve was in his element when he was alone with his art supplies. So, being dolled up and presented at a huge gala, normally he wouldn't do it.
“It’s nice that you have your own work space. I know I always like to have a space separate from everything else that I can be creative and not worry about things being in my way.”
“Ah, you’re a simple omega then.” The man nodded. “Well, I can understand that. I myself don’t like to wear all the fancy stuff all the time. Is there anything specific you might be looking for? Something frilly or more revealing than button up shirts and suspenders?”
“He’s been nauseous and been throwing up quite a bit,” Maria said. “Those are the main symptoms that I have noticed, other than those lasting for a good week or so.”
He didn’t have to worry about that much during the performance, however, because their crowd looked very uninterested in what Steve had to say, unless the girls were dancing behind him and showing off tasteful amounts of leg. Tony stepped aside as the girls exited the stage, telling them they did a good job while looking back out, watching Steve struggle to engage the audience. He sighed and leaned against one of the support posts of the stage. The poor alpha was doing his best, but the soldiers ended up calling him names, one even mooning him with their bare ass, which Tony did not find attractive at all. These alphas had no idea how to act around anyone but other alphas or girls and omegas who wanted to show off and look enticing for them.
Steve looked around in wonder with wide eyes, impressed by the amount of tech lying around, waiting to be tinkered with by the master himself.
Tony shrugged as he hung the top back on the rack. “I’m… not sure what I like. I have a suit that the jacket flares out a bit, but that’s really the only thing I have that remotely looks omegan.”
Tony cried out and moaned into one of Steve’s shirts that made up part of the nest’s wall. He couldn’t do anything more than moan and whimper as Steve ate out his ass, that expert tongue flicking and moving in ways that Tony was sure he himself couldn’t come close to replicating. A huge shiver ran through his body, and then his body produced more slick to cover Steve’s face in. Tony moaned shakily as he was at the mercy of the alpha’s tongue.
“Well you were staring off into space, to be fair,” the alpha said. “But you shouldn’t be lifting things. Steve said you cracked your rib again.”
When the door closed, Tony let out a huge whine, shifting awkwardly as his gut twisted up. Damn his omegan body.
Nodding, the blond alpha headed back to the lockers, where the Howling Commandos and Tony were suiting up and preparing weapons. Tony had been given a sort of privacy screen to keep the other alphas out but to also make him feel safe enough to dress in the same room as a bunch of alphas that weren’t his.
“Tony, come on,” Peggy, urged, leaving her hands at her sides so she didn’t set the omega off any more than he already was.
As he thought about what he’d do once he was free from the painting, his phone began to vibrate in his pocket, silently letting him know that he was receiving a call.
“There’s a tent behind the medical tent that the nurses set up for him,” Peggy explained. I can tell everyone to clear the area if that would give you two better privacy.
Peggy hesitated at the entrance of the tent, sighing as she watched Phillips turn to look at her. “Any news?” she asked.
“Let’s get this briefing done quickly so you can leave,” Peggy said. “The Hydra camp is in Krausberg tucked between these two mountain ranges.” She pulled out a map and pointed to where she was talking about. “It’s a factory of some kind. Howard should be able to drop you almost on the doorstep.”
Tony’s face went white as Howard started grabbing for his bag, clearly wanting to find those pills. “Dad, stop! They’re my pills, you have no right to them!”
The alpha took a shaking breath in, letting it out slowly. “You and Peggy hang out too much, I think. You sounded just like her.”
“Let’s take your things to Steve’s apartment,” Peggy said once she pulled back and brushed back some of Tony’s longer hair. “Then we need to go find him. He’s been hiding from everyone since he got back from Austria…”
“Then grow up, act like the 25 year old alpha you are and take responsibility for your actions instead of blaming them on the omega you’ve been dating.” Tony stood up and looked down at Steve, his expression not as hard anymore, but still not happy. “Prove to me you still want this relationship.”
“You were kissing her back! Clearly you’re ready to help any needy pretty thing that comes your way begging for you to take them.”
The omega shook his head. “Steve and I have been together for over a year now. He’s got to get used to it, because as far as I can tell, I’m not breaking up with Steve at all.”
Before long they were at Peggy’s apartment building, and while Tony got out of the taxi and ran inside, Peggy paid the driver and thanked him. She hurried inside just as some small snowflakes began to float down in the chilly air. Good thing she had more coats in her apartment that the two of them could use when they headed out to the bar in their fancy clothes.
For several minutes, the couple watched the rain, trying to make sense of the new world they lived in while mourning what they had lost. Their baby, Tony’s parents, Peggy, Bucky, the Howling Commandos, every bit of their old lives was lost to time, and thus they had to make their way in the new world they had been thrust into. It was going to take time to adjust. Steve was already overwhelmed by how much things had changed, but at least they still had each other and their relationship. No matter what came their way, Tony and Steve knew they could make in this new world, as long as they could stand together holding hands in the process.
Steve’s eyes widened as he leaned against the shelves in the closet. “You’re really eager to do this…”
Steve closed his sketchbook and set it to the side. "Before the serum, I wanted so bad to join the army and do my part. I dreamed about coming over seas, being on the front lines, serving my country. Finally got what I wanted… and here I am wearing tights.”
Shivering, he let himself imagine what it’d be like to be Steve’s, to share both heat and ruts with him, to, every night before bed, be fucked so raw that the next morning everyone would know what they had done just by how he’d be walking into a lab to work on his latest invention and show up all the alpha scientists at Hydra.
Tony shuffled around, building them a miniature nest that would keep them both warm and comfortable, then he settled into it, waiting for his alpha to join.
“Maybe a couple hours? You woke up briefly when they put the IV in you, but you passed out again quickly. Doctors confirmed you had a concussion, so they’re going to work with you to manage your symptoms once you rest up some more.”
was unique to Steve only. Even Bucky’s scent was far from Steve’s, the darker haired alpha’s being more peppery with a bit of citrus to it, which was a scent that Tony knew he had smelled long before meeting Bucky.
The assistant frowned. "I… will let him know that." Without any more words, the assistant turned and left, leaving Tony and Steve alone again.
“As well as I’m going to be for the moment.” Tony smiled at the butler. “Thanks for breakfast. Glad I get to eat a real meal for once.”
“Yeah, your mother won’t be happy, but I can’t help it.” Howard shook his head as he ate. “This whole Hydra business isn’t what I thought I’d be working on when I signed up to help the SSR.”
Tony leaned into Steve again with a chuckle. “God, I’m glad you let me do this. Having you gone for missions three months in a row really sucks.”
“Do you think they’ll have any new shipments of clothes today?” Maria asked as they entered the mall, arms linked together.
Tests and examinations were done on Tony before the nurses cleaned him up and an IV drip was inserted into his arm before he and his parents were left alone once more. Pain medication soon kicked in, thanks to the IV, and Tony was soon feeling physically comfortable again, but emotionally he was completely destroyed. There was no quick recovery from the emotional trauma the omega had experienced, and it showed. Tony lay in the hospital bed, staring up at the ceiling as his tears rolled down the sides of his face. He had nothing left of Steve, and that was devastating on its own. Losing that last bit of Steve that Tony had been clinging to left him without hope or a will to live.
Steve kissed Tony gently and pulled back to smile at his omega. “Right by my side, even after the war.”
“I only adjusted what I told you so that I wouldn’t have to hunt you down and drag you up here by your ear again.” She said simply.
“Submissive is nice in the bed, but I do like an omega that takes control as well. If they’re moaning my name by the end, they can do whatever they want as far as I’m concerned.”
It was clear Steve loved Tony suddenly being more awake, because he kissed back with his own growl, pinning Tony down by his shoulders. When they pulled away to breathe, Tony tried growling again. It was a far cry from Steve’s alpha growl, but it was still more prominent than the first time he had tried it out in Czechoslovakia.
Maria let her hand run down Tony’s face with a soft smile before playing with the hair at the back of his neck. “What is it, Tony?”
“I won’t need to look, but Tony should. He’ll be talking you through some of our projects for inspiration, though you’d have to sign a nondisclosure agreement before we get to that. We have some projects we haven’t announced yet that may come up. Tony may end up launching into too much detail.”
That got a smile out of the brunet. “A shopping trip sounds great. Let me put on different clothes. You know there’s going to be alphas that can smell my heat coming.”
Peggy was waiting for Tony when he got off the plane and all his things were unloaded. He hugged her so tight when he saw her again, another round of crying shaking his body as he hugged Peggy. She did her best to soothe him, but she knew Steve was better at soothing, even if he was not in a good mental state.
It felt like hours of waiting. Nothing was coming through the radio. No static, no voices, nothing, and that worried Tony even more than he already was. He almost felt like his heart would stop beating.
“Pretty much healed at this point,” Tony replied, stepping back so he could look at both alphas that meant so much to him. “Doctor got onto me about not letting my original injury heal all the way before I dove into a fight.”
“I’ve seen you drunk. You’re still a tiny little thing just learning to walk.” Rhodey shot over at him.
Tony felt his knees get weak, but he had to keep standing for Steve. He was still strong without his alpha, and he had to show it. His eyes betrayed him though, his vision going blurry as he watched Steve quickly grab socks, shoes, and a jacket and leave with the soldier. Every fiber in his being screamed at him to follow his alpha, but he physically couldn’t move, only barely managing to whisper out “Please come back,” as Steve was taken away from him once more.
“I understand the pressure of being under deadlines,” Steve sympathized. “Hopefully your projects aren’t too hard on you.”
As the day went on, Tony and Maria visited a few other stores in the mall before making their final stop of the day at a restaurant, enjoying a nice warm meal before they headed back home with their purchases in tow. Once they were home, Tony proceeded to show his mother the clothes that he had gotten, and she smiled approvingly at all of them. Tony was glad to see his mother happy and involved in his daily lifestyle as an omega. It made him even happier to know that she supported him, no matter what. He was an omega, and she accepted that and treated him just as she always had.
“Perfect.” Steve rested a hand on Tony’s stomach and smiled wider. His blue gaze was filled with nothing but the purest form of love. “You’re perfect.”
Steve, being the gentleman he was, stopped attacking Tony’s neck and collar bone with kisses and bites, and he looked up at the brunet. It was like something clicked in him when he was called alpha, that deep primal instinct activating inside him, and a low growl came from his throat.
Maria nodded, seemingly satisfied with that answer. “Well, since you seem to be feeling better, think you could handle a shopping trip today? I was going to go with Jarvis to get groceries.”
for thinking I had found an alpha that might take my interest. Glad to find out I was wrong.” Tony huffed and looked out the window again. The rain clouds were darker now and looked more like storm clouds.
“There’s a balcony high above the city in this building,” the alpha replied. “It may be a bit wet, but it’s private enough.”
After a bit of silence, Tony took in a shaking breath and looked up at Steve. “Can we go lay down?” he asked, a few tears finally slipping down his face.
It took Tony maybe another half hour to finish getting ready for the party. While he picked out a pair of shoes, he almost had an overwhelming desire to just throw on his boots and not give a damn that they didn’t match his outfit. He wanted to be back with his friends in the Howling Commandos, truthfully, but he knew he had to wait until Steve was called back to duty to see them again. It wasn’t that much longer, he told himself, slipping on a pair of heeled shoes than made him a little taller. Soon. Soon he would be back with his friends.
Wrapping his arms around Tony, Steve chuckled. “I want you to be happy with me, and I know this is one way that I can make you happy.”
“You’ve got my knot for a whole hour, Tony. You can do what you want with it, and maybe I’ll make you cum again. Would you like that?” Steve’s voice held a dangerous purr to it’s tone as he spoke, and he pulled his hips back just enough to pull against the omega’s entrance.
Maria soon decided that there wasn’t anything in that store worth buying, and Tony was thrilled to finally leave. He wanted to be surrounded by actual scents and not the dead ones that betas had. They went into several more stores, searching and not finding much. It seemed that the war was taking a toll on all goods shipments, including omegan goods. There were only a handful of mixed stores that were offering a full line of omegan products, and those stores were not the most family friendly. Still, if they were offering any sort of clothing, Tony was highly considering stopping by one of the stores just to check it out.
Maria helped Tony to his bed and pulled the blankets up to his head to make him as comfortable as possible. “It’s alright, Tony,” she soothed, grabbing a bucket from underneath the sink in the bathroom for the omega to use in case he couldn’t make it to the bathroom in time. “Everyone gets sick, there’s no need to be scared.”
"Clearly. I mean you're smart and, I'm guessing, you invent your own things and want to use them rather than just let them sit as ideas on paper. Some alphas just don't get how smart omegas actually are. Hell, I've been outsmarted by omegas several times."
Tony stared at himself in the mirror. He wondered to himself if he was dressing up too much for the return of his alpha, but he quickly got rid of that thought. Steve was going to love seeing him again, dressed up or not, so Tony might as well dress up a little more than usual to go to the military base  and greet the alpha.
Steve was thrusting into Tony in a matter of seconds, his movements not as intense as they might be if they had been more awake. The alpha took it slow and gentle, simply enjoying the closeness he had with his omega in the morning hours of that beautiful Christmas day. There was no rush getting out of bed, so it was better to just stay in and enjoy it.
Amidst Tony’s daydreaming, he had lost sight of his father completely, and it wasn’t until he was almost to Colonel Phillips’s office that he noticed. Steve’s voice caught him off guard, and once again he realized just how wet he really was, and just from daydreaming! God, he really needed to get a grip on himself. Wait until tonight, he told himself. They could be together all night, have sex until the sun rose the next morning. It was a wonderful thought, and one that once again didn’t help his situation. Tony hoped Steve could spare a few minutes to take him to some closet and fuck him.
“No… No, it was someone else, and… you would have loved them so much.” Tony wiped his eyes as he sat back in Steve’s lap. “We… we had a baby, Steve.”
“Yup.” Tony opened a drawer and started pulling out his things, tossing them in a bag if he wasn’t putting them on, “The guy’s a keeper for sure, Clint. God, last night
“Oh please don’t apologize for this, Tony,” Maria said, petting her son’s hair in a loving way only a mother could pull off. “You don’t need to apologize for leaving with Mr. Rogers.”
The commandos were the first to agree, nodding and standing up to hurry out and suit up, prepare for the most important battle of their lives. Anyone else who wasn’t Peggy, Phillips, or Howard, left to also prepare, loud chattering filling the room as Steve stood up and looked down at Tony.
Tony opened his eyes and cried as he clutched his stomach gently. He had no one to seek comfort in but his child.
“Oh wow… I didn’t know you had these. You never wear anything like this.” Tony carefully took the box and looked over the gems.
"2008. Been a long time since 1945. But life hasn't changed all that much, I promise. You'll see soon enough. As for your concerns about your old mate…"
The hours dragged on, and Peggy and Tony were stuck either watching Howard or listening to other agents drone on about the war. Tony wasn’t too disappointed by being able to watch his father work on new projects, including some shields that looked like they were prototypes for a future design Steve might use. The omega took little interest in those, choosing instead to focus on the weapon designs his father was working on. He was more interested in the math anyways.
“Eh, I’ve shot at you before, you can handle being a test subject for a bullet proof material.” Tony chuckled as he took a drink of his water.
Tony’s eyes lit up and a smile graced his face as he reached for the dial and turned on the radio. The voice of Louis Armstrong filled the car as they drove into the darkening day, rain clouds in the distance. The omega sat back in his seat as he listened to the music, the smile on his face staying as he watched buildings go by.He felt a peace after having freaked out in the theater bathroom. There was no war, it was just him and Steve driving to get some burgers and relax for the rest of the night.
“Oh my god, I’m not actually going to stay here,” the brunet said with a laugh. “I’m gonna go back with you, if I have any say in the matter.”
“God, I love you too, Steve.” Tony smiled and laughed, the sound merry and light as it filled the room.
Heavy and quick footsteps came rushing down the hall towards Tony’s bedroom as his pain only seemed to get worse by the second. He could already tell his lower half was coated in his own blood, and that made his stomach churn, because he could smell it too. As soon as the door opened and light from the hallway made the room brighter, Tony let out a scared whine and tried to reach out for whoever it was that had entered his room.
Time felt slow as Howard worked and worked to save his son. Blood was far up his arms and on his shirt as he worked, trying to keep himself calm as he performed such an unpracticed medical procedure on Tony. It was the only quick way Tony could be saved, even if it was taking longer than Howard had anticipated. Racing against the clock, the beta worked and put aside his feelings, putting that true Stark brainpower to use as he came up with solutions to problems on the fly. There were so many things that could have gone wrong, and yet, everything Howard was doing yielded the least amount of blood and carving possible.
Steve smiled and looked back at Miss Potts. "The payment looks very good to me," he said while signing the NDA. "I look forward to learning more about the company."
“I...I don’t understand… You ask me on a date, act all gentlemanly to me...and then you tell me you might not want me to come with you to Europe? Are you really telling me this?”
“Wow, you actually have made my day.” Tony cracked a smile as best as he could while reaching an arm out to take the box.
The man who had encouraged everyone to cheer for Steve came close and patted the alpha on the back. “This must be the omega you were telling me about,” he said with a smirk.
Steve gave a quizzical look before Tony handed him a small box. He took the decorative paper off of it, then he looked back at the brunet. “Tony…”
"We'll do all we can now. I just hope we can spark some hope in our son. He's got more than one life to take care of now."
The omega smiled. “Yeah, we can go shopping. I need more formal outfits that I like, anyways. Most of the outfits I have I’m not too fond of, but I guess that’s what happens when you have omega relatives that want you to look like them.”
Tony scoffed and brushed past his father. “I’m going to put my uniform on… If I die, tell my mom that I love her, and that I’m sorry for the decision I made rather than staying home where we were safe.”
“I’ve always just wanted nothing more than to be free to let myself be smart. If I can be myself like that, then I’ll be happy.”
As he walked, Tony noticed more areas of pain, specifically in his legs. He was finding it somewhat difficult to walk on his own, but he’d get over it eventually. Besides, the warm water of a shower might help take away some of the pain. At the very least he would be happy to wash off all the dried slick, sweat, and cum, and to finally smell nice again.
“I’m not like the others, Tony, and you know that. Besides, how do I know you’re not sneaking around behind my back while I sit here thinking you actually love me?”
When Tony didn’t answer, unable to speak again as his sobs escaped, Steve said the omega’s name so gently, so sweetly, that Tony could literally feel his heart breaking into a million pieces.
With the party only being a couple hours away, Tony needed to start getting ready. Otherwise he would be keeping his mother and his alpha waiting. There was no need for keeping the two most important people in his life waiting on him to look pretty. It was better to be ready early than to be rushing at the last minute. Tony grabbed his eyeliner palette and started painting on the dark makeup will new skill that he had developed in the past year. When he was satisfied with how it looked, he focused on a bit more makeup, such as blush and a bit of contouring, before he was satisfied with his work. It was only then that he got into his outfit, which was accompanied by a knock on his bedroom door. Groaning, Tony headed to the door and cracked it open to see who it was. Thankfully it was just his mother.
Tony tried to speak, but it broke with a sob. He tried again once he had some sort of control over his crying. “I… I’ll pack up and try to leave today…”
“We’ll have a room as soon as we get back to the manor,” the omega said while shifting his weight to one side. “And it’s far away from my parents’ room, so we don’t have to worry too much about being too loud.”
Tony hesitated before he pulled back. “I don’t know… maybe, but the war is still going on, and I don’t want to risk losing you if we plan a wedding or something.”
The brunet blinked. His heart started beating even faster. Was Steve really suggesting what Tony thought he was suggesting? Did Steve really want to go to Italy alone? Was that really an option he was considering while on a freaking
The room was quiet and calm, the sound of Tony’s breathing seeming to be the loudest thing in the room. It was almost like the war was over, and it was just a time of recovery. Of course, that was the furthest from the truth, with Steve being gone and Tony suffering from injuries that weren’t caught until it was almost too late. The weight of it all rested heavily on Howard’s shoulders, and he wished more than anything that Tony would open his eyes and smile at him. Wishful thinking, since Howard had previously not been a great parent to his son, but that little snarky smile from his son was all he wanted from the world in that moment. A smile and a hug.
“Don’t just guess, Tony. Know.” Peggy lifted Tony’s head and offered a worried smile. “Promise me you won’t fight again until the baby is born.”
Tony pulled away quickly, eyes wide as he looked at who had greeted them. A wide smile came across his face. “Peggy!”
The European landscape flew by as Tony looked out the window, wondering just when the war was going to end. It had already lasted far longer than anyone had anticipated, but that nasty alpha who was the leader of Germany just didn’t know when to quit. It sickened Tony to even think of how many people were being slaughtered or taken advantage of. It was disgusting, and it would only end when the Nazis, and Hydra, were defeated for good. Only a few more steps had to be taken, but they were careful steps. One slip up at the Hydra headquarters could have meant disaster for the rest of the world.
Tony had been lost in the moment of being ravaged by his alpha, letting loose several gasps and moans, until Steve nipped at his scent gland. That made the omega jerk and shiver at the same time, letting out a longer moan. “Oh god,” he rasped out, bringing a hand to the back of Steve’s head.
“So,” Steve started once they were in the elevator, “what’s it like being an omega on top of the world?”
Steve looked up to find the course of the voice. "JARVIS is… like HAL 9000? The AI from 2001 A Space Odyssey?"
“Good.” Tony moved to press a kiss to the corner of Steve’s lips, lingering there a moment before smiling, “Even after washing your face, it still smells like my slick…”
Tony was told to stay in the apartment that day, Howard claiming that the weather was too bad and he didn’t want to have to worry about his son in case something happened. It was fine. Tony could stay warm inside and work on some more designs. The new uniform that Steve had was dashing to say the least. The strap over the shoulder, the leather gloves, the gun holster that went around one thigh, those were Tony’s favorite parts of the uniform. Honestly there wasn’t a single alpha that could make the uniform look better, which Tony prided himself in.
"They certainly are," Steve agreed. "I was a soldier alongside some of those types of alphas unfortunately. Real dickheads."
He was dressed in his best suit, ready for his consultation with the leaders of Stark Industries. Though he was a bit nervous, Steve never doubted his painting skills, and he was sure he was going to impress his possible customers.
At some point Steve moved a hand to the back of Tony’s head, pushing him to go further and faster while his intense blue eyes locked onto his omega. One of Tony’s hands was pushing against Steve’s hip, the other reaching down to touch himself, because there was no way in hell he was getting out of that closet without also getting to come. The more he touched himself, the more slick he produced, and he was happy he had decided to discard his pants all together That would have been a mess that would have taken longer to clean up, and Tony didn’t want to be out of his father’s suspicious gaze for more than was considered not suspicious.
“I wouldn’t mind it being known that I’m a painter,” Steve said. “Could get more people to look me up.”
“You don’t need to think about that,” Tony said. “Focus on me, on us… that’s all that matters right now.”
“That’s a challenge I’m willing to take.” Steve tugged at the remainder of Tony’s clothing, continuing to leave little bites at the brunet’s collarbone and shoulders.
“Wow, yes, I… yes, sleeping with me… sleeping in the same bed as me. Yes.” Steve cleared his throat, suddenly feeling warm.
“Of course not. Nothing says we can’t eat in the car, you know. We don’t have to walk into a burger joint in our fancy tuxedos to show off. We can just hit a drive through.”
Thankfully Tony was able to get down some real food, as opposed to snacks, and drank more water than he had in the couple days previous. It was enough to make Maria happy, and she sent Tony to bed with warm blankets and enough water to keep him hydrated. Tony was visibly not feeling well, even if it was only caused by his alpha suddenly leaving and giving his body absolutely no time at all to adjust. Each day that passed allowed the once shared bedroom to smell less and less like Steve and more like only Tony, which only left a dead scent in the omega’s nose. His room smelled like nothing, and it was the most unsettling it had ever been.
Thanks," Steve said, watching the agent walk away. He sighed and moved a hand to squeeze Tony's shoulder. "We'll talk more about this later. We have a Colonel to meet with in the meantime."
“I know,” Steve said, looking at the floor and fidgeting with his hands. “I know you probably will choose not to believe any word I say, and I understand. If I was in your position, I’d feel the same way.”
“Don’t blame yourself for this, Tony,” Steve said, stepping closer to the omega. “This is my fault. I brought you here with me, I put you in danger.” He sighed and cupped the side of Tony’s face with his hand. “I’m sorry, but I can’t stay with you right now. I have to find those soldiers.”
“Good to see you’re your normal self,” the dark haired alpha said, ruffling Tony’s hair when he stepped back. “How’s your rib?”
Tony couldn’t count how many times he had to pause his writing just to go to the bathroom, both for using the toilet for its intended purpose and also for scares when Tony thought he might throw up again.
“You hardly ate that burger I made for you… you must not be feeling well at all.” Maria sighed and picked up the plate with the burger that had maybe one or two bites taken out of it. “You haven’t been throwing anything up, have you?”
Those few weeks seemed to fly by as Christmas drew closer. Maria and Jarvis were quite busy with planning another big party to host, since it was common of the Starks to throw a huge party at nearly any big holiday. Tony made sure to stay away from the planning as much as possible, unless his smart mind was needed. Party planning wasn’t his forte, so he just stayed in his room with Steve most of the time and worked on invention designs. One of the more recent designs he had become obsessed with was the arc reactor that his uniform donned. It was probably going to need an upgrade as soon as he and Steve returned to London, so it was better to start working on designs before he was able to handle his uniform again.
Though the baby still wasn’t very big, Tony swore he could feel the extra weight already. Or maybe that was him just eating too much and thinking it was baby weight. Either way, every time he managed to think of his baby, the slightest hint of a smile graced his lips.
The alpha was climbing back on the bed as soon as he had the condom on. Tony hadn't moved an inch from his submissive position, which Steve was pleased by. He resumed his own position, hips lined up with Tony's and hands resting on the small of the omegas back. Once more the tip of his cock slid into Tony, then a little more, and the omega was letting out moans one right after the other. Slowly Steve fully sheathed himself into his omega, letting out a low groan once his hips met Tony's. There was a moment of pause where the two adjusted and relaxed, relishing in the sensation of joining together for the first time.
"If you have no other goals other than to try and make Tony feel guilty, I suggest you move along," Rhodey said sternly.
Lost in his thoughts, Tony was brought back to reality when Steve groaned and shoved his dick in as far as it could go, the knot inflating and causing the omega to inhale sharply and whimper, feeling Steve’s seed shoot deep inside him. Tony relaxed finally, his legs buckling beneath him. Despite how tired he was, he still loved feeling Steve's cum so deep in him outside of heat that he felt like he might get pregnant.
Tony shook his head, keeping his eyes trained on the floor as he picked up the pants he was going to wear. In his head, he was glad he already had his shirt with the high collar on that muted his scent and hid his stomach, even though he knew he wasn’t even close to having a baby bump yet.
Howard blinked, then he sat back rather roughly in his chair. “Oh my god… Are you serious? You’re serious… How long has he been pregnant? He doesn’t look like he could be more than a month or so along.”
“So, Captain, just how do you like your omegas?” Tony asked, running his fingers through Steve’s feathery hair. As his other hand reached under a pillow for one of the condoms he knew would be there.
Once the machine and the reactor were all ready to go, all that was left to do was create a serum that would increase Tony’s metabolism, which was what the omega had suspected would have kept Steve alive if he had indeed survived. Test after test needed to be performed with familiar faces, scientists from the Strategic Scientific Reserve volunteering their time to help the mate sick omega reunite with his alpha.
“Fuck…” Steve lifted his head to look down at Tony, growling lightly as he pushed inside of Tony just a little more. “You are just amazing, doll.”
Curled up next to Steve on the jet, Tony let his years of being brave melt away and expose his soft core; which no one but Steve now were allowed to see. Anthony Edward Stark still had a name, an image to uphold, but in the quiet moment on the plane, he was as fragile as a flower, as peaceful as a bubbling creek on a warm spring day. Tony was a prince at the end of a long war, fought bravely all the way to the end, and at last he was resting with his king, the alpha whom he loved with his entire being, affection transcending time itself, because just like any fairytale, true love was what won wars and broke spells. The kindness of a lover spoken millions of words to the right person, and love was all Tony felt in that moment. No remorse, no sadness, no guilt or emptiness.
“Good. It’s good to see you again as always, Miss Potts, Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes.” the man nodded before turning his gaze on Steve. “I don’t believe we have met?”
“You’re perfect—how are you perfect? No alpha can be this perfect…” Tony muttered after a moment of silence, turning slightly to lean back against Steve.
When Steve entered the area, Tony caught his scent almost immediately, and he glanced over the top of the screen that had been set up to glimpse at his alpha before returning to putting on his uniform. He hadn’t expected for Steve to suddenly be right next to the screen, tapping the top of it to get his attention, the familiar red, white, and blue uniform in the alpha’s hands.
The doctor watched him go, humming in thought. “Vomiting, dizzy, pain, and extremely hungry. How long has the pain lasted?”
The omega’s mouth dropped open, eyebrows shooting up in a devastated expression. There was another pause, this one filled with emotional pain so unbelievable that Tony couldn’t help but let tears slide down his face.
“Steve, you’re not really going to do this, are you,” Tony asked, sounding a bit more desperate than he intended.
“Not quite. They want my company and money to add to their own companies and fortunes, oh, and to push me to be the stereotypical barefoot and pregnant omega that only leaves the nest when the alpha overlord wants to show off of ye olde times.”
"Yes, ma'am, I'll be there." Steve brought his attention back to Tony once his friends were gone. "That was smooth."
The next morning, both Steve and Tony went to the local hospital to get the omega a prescription for suppression pills. The doctor made sure to note all the risks that came with the pills, but Tony wasn’t too concerned. Yeah, there was a slight risk of not being able to have kids in the future, but his mind wasn’t on having a family. He wanted to help end the war, and this was his way of doing so. He and Steve walked out of the hospital confidently, Tony with a slight skip in his step as he knew he was that much closer to being able to fight in the war.
Another satisfied noise made it past Steve's lips as he smiled and nuzzled Tony again. "Good omega."
“Yeah, well I think we can take partial blame for that,” Steve said. “We did clear you for fighting even though you weren’t fully healed quite yet.”
“Tony, if I end up going overseas and you come with me, you’ll be put behind enemy lines most likely.”
Tony waited until Peggy was far enough away to let out a louder moan he had been holding back. He reached down to the bags that belonged to Steve and fumbled with the zippers and buckles until finally one opened, revealing Steve’s casual shirts and his tan army dress clothes. The alpha might get upset if Tony ruined his dress clothes with slick and drool, so he went for a t-shirt, snatching it up and bringing it to his face to inhale deeply. Honestly, he just wanted to grab the whole bag and dump it on himself, feeling that sensation of something heavy on him that smelled like Steve. He settled for just putting the shirt on one of the pillows and rearranging all the blankets and remaining pillows into a nest, plus adding some more of Steve’s shirts to make it smell better. Soon he had a sturdy nest built, and he collapsed into it after shedding most of his clothes.
Howard and Maria walked in, Maria looking like she had been crying for a while. Tony didn’t pay attention to that though, because as soon as he saw his mother, his own eyes grew wet and he attempted to reach his arms out and sit up, which of course caused him more pain.
Steve’s eyes widened as he realized who it was tinkering with the entertainment center. “Mr. Stark? You’re here?”
Tony cried until his throat was raw and he could barely breathe, his whole body shaking as he felt cold. He stared at the floor long after he couldn’t cry any more, hugging himself and struggling to keep himself from going into a full blown panic attack, though he was mostly in one already. It was impossible for him stop as he realized how much he had been sweating, despite feeling cold. He had to get medical attention… but he was too broken to do so. He didn’t move himself from that chair in case, by some miracle, Steve came back on the radio asking for help. But the request never came, and Tony felt numb.
Steve just chuckled and smiled. “It’s fine, getting this kind of attention isn’t all too uncommon for me. I don’t mind.”
Steve tossed his head to the side like an animal and exhaled through his nose. He was fighting back against something, but whatever he was fighting against didn’t take long to beat down, because the alpha was grabbing Tony’s hips and flipping the omega over onto his stomach, forcing him into the submissive position that Steve went crazy over. He groaned lowly yet again as he grabbed Tony’s ass cheeks and spread them apart, shoving his face forward to lap up the slick that just seemed to be pouring out of Tony’s ass.
Watching the European countryside fly by while on the plane, Tony sighed, playing with the flap of red material he had attached to the chest piece of his suit. It covered up the glow of the reactor so he could go stealth easier. It was a last minute addition that Bucky had brought up after noticing just how bright the reactor was. Tony was glad the alpha had noticed that. Otherwise he would have been discovered far too easily during battles.
“Not at all.” she smiled and gestured for him to follow her, “I treated myself to a nice lunch out.”
“Might work part of the time, but you might just have to drag him away from his lab other times.” Rhodey said, “I’ve done that a few times. Just threw him over my shoulder and carried him up to his room and sat there until he finally let himself settle in for the night.”
“Oh, Tony…” The alpha only held Tony tighter rubbing as much of his scent on the omega as possible. “You’re so special, and you deserve to know that. Whatever your dad says about you, it’s not true.”
“I wasn’t about to leave Tony back in the US, Mr. Stark,” Steve countered. “His safety is my concern when he didn’t want to leave my side.”
“I think I could have a guess,” Steve responded, smiling back. “You did build a machine to freeze yourself in time so you could be with me again.”
He gave up on thinking and just laid back on his bed. Everything hurt. Everything was spinning. Tony could have sworn he was dying or something. Maybe… maybe he had one of those viruses that was flying around. He didn’t want to think that that was the issue, but he had to consider the possibilities. Besides, he was sure his mother wasn’t thinking he had some stomach bug any more. Not after a week of not feeling good. Stomach bugs didn’t ever seem to be as extreme as Tony was going through, even with taking medicine and eating well.
“Thanks.” With a destination, Steve headed to the kitchen and helped himself to a glass of water. He went to the living room with it, sitting down and watching the pair of legs sticking out from the TV stand.
Looking around Steve halted, tapping Bucky and Tony lightly to get them to stop as well. Instinctively the three stood with their backs to each other, looking around for any signs of movement from the vehicles. There was nothing that they could see, but it was still suspicious that there weren’t any Hydra agents just milling about the entrance to the base. Then there was a small metallic sound, a sound that caught Tony’s attention and drew it towards one of the cars near him. Hurried footsteps followed soon after, to which Tony raised his gun and moved to watch the fleeing Hydra agent. He was going to shoot, until he noticed the grenade right next to his feet.
"I'm sorry, I'm assuming you're one of Tony's exes," Steve said. "If you wanted to dance with Tony, perhaps you should have taken the advantage earlier in your life."
Rain was falling at a steady pace outside, the storm clouds rolling in fast the longer they sat in the restaurant. Steve got up and paid for their food before returning to the booth and grabbing the food Tony did not eat. “Are you ready to go?”
Tony was smiling like an idiot as he rushed to finish getting ready. He was minutes away from seeing his alpha again, so he was giddy and walked with a spring in his step. He was ignoring the fact that Howard would also be there because he didn’t want anything to ruin the day. Tony was going to see Steve again after several months of being apart, and the omega was dying to get his hands on that blond alpha once more.
They pushed through the crowd of soldiers growing the closer they got the camp’s entrance. Coming up the road, marching at a brisk pace, was Steve, followed by hundreds of men he had rescued from the Hydra base. Those who were in the camp cheered and clapped at the return of their own men, plus others from other militaries. They marched on through until they stopped in the middle of camp, meeting Phillips and Peggy. There was silence between them, then Steve spoke.
Tony’s eyes were glittering with tears as he looked back down at Steve. He wanted Steve badly, and the alpha wasn’t doing anything but looking up at him and growling. What a brat Steve was being.
“He probably doesn’t like that you’re taller than him now,” Tony said. “You alphas do tend to be sensitive about that kind of stuff.”
Huffing in a very alpha way, Steve cut the foreplay off and went straight for sticking the tip of his cock in Tony’s hole. He was rewarded with a moan and a shiver from the omega. As much as he wanted to go ahead, Steve knew they had to do one last thing before he entered Tony fully.
Tony had, as promised, ordered Steve a tux to wear and had it delivered to Steve’s apartment the day before the gala so that he’d have it to get ready. Tony also had promised to pick him up, and judging by the limo that had pulled up to the curb outside Steve’s apartment building, it seemed that promise had come through as well.
He knew he should've kept the gifts going. He knew it. Maybe Steve was testing him? Seems absurd to think about it but maybe it is so. No, Steve wasn't that kind of a person.
That night, they cooked, Steve making the sauce. He made sure to not tell Tony what he was adding and would continue to confuse the guy whenever he tried to keep a track of the ingredients. But, in all honesty, Tony didn't mind being in the dark about it. He wouldn't even ask JARVIS to recall the method to him later. Not just because he didn't necessarily cook, but also because he respected Steve and if it was a family secret, Tony didn't want to pry.
Tony was staring at the ceiling, remembering Steve's smile. His large hand so delicately helping Peter handle his cone that was probably too big for the three year old. His blond hair shining in the million lights reflecting on them while they were on the street. His pulp bottom lip, so pink, so full, so chewable. His long legs that Tony wouldn't mind having wrap around his waist. His large and hard chest, so firm. Those baby blues.
Tony lead him to corner where they were supposed to go. "How do you know he's right if you never know the answer yourself?"
Steve kissed him and pulled back, walking inside with a pleased grin on his face as he left Tony completely stupefied.
Steve had seemed tense the whole hour he was there. Now with him in the kitchen, Tony had time to collect himself. All he could think about was if he had fucked up somewhere along the way, wouldn't be the first time he'd done it. He tried thinking hard, it just didn't seem to help. Oh, where did he go wrong?
"I'll look after him." And honestly, he did not know what overcame him when he had said that. He had never looked after a child,
Tony brought his hand forward for Steve to take, who did after reluctantly unbuckling himself. He got out of the car and looked around, seeing that they were parked in front of a big house. Mansion? Looked like a mansion. But since Steve hadn't ever seen one, he was still confused.
"Can't I just shake a few hands, get a few pictures, kiss a few babies and be out of there within half an hour?" He asked, mostly just to piss Pepper. He gulped down his cup of coffee. God, that's good stuff.
"Me too." This was pleasant. Tony was proud he wasn't making a fool of himself. He didn't need that. In order to charm sweet Steve here, he would have to bring his A-game to the table.
"Welcome back, sir. How were the kids?" Came a British accent. JARVIS was his AI. The closest thing Tony had to a family. Closer than what even Pepper was to him.
Tony didn't think it was wise to beat around the bush now. The aliens would have to wait. He thought he could hold himself together but it was harder than he had anticipated. "Are you gonna break up with me?"
He pulled his phone, and typed out for JARVIS to find about all the people that had their children in the daycare. A few seconds later, he got the whole lists of names.
"Oh. I'm sorry. I uh, I only came in like twenty minutes ago and Peter usually gets up to go the bathroom around this time so I took him. I tried to be quiet, I didn't mean to wake you up-"
Okay, sure, maybe he had something against having Tony buy him stuff, even if Tony could buy him half of Manhattan with still money left in his pocket to buy the other half. He would always frown this adorable little frown, forming a little dent between his eyebrows. He would say
Tony closed his mouth and nodded. "Great. Great. Ice cream it is. Thank god, you love ice cream. Who doesn't love ice cream? Not loving ice cream should be a deal breaker everywhere. Worldwide. Don't you think? I mean it's ice cream-"
"I'm Steve." The other answered, shaking Tony's hand. A firm shake, Tony liked that. So Steve it is.
Tony had dropped Steve and Peter off in front of their apartment. The neighborhood wasn't great, old apartment buildings bordering the street. Steve had firmly held Peter's sleeping body in his arms as he thanked Tony for the evening.
Steve looked at their faces, two out of three people he loved the most in the world. His son and boyfriend. He looked the mansion, then at the two again and then around them. Tony was biting his lip.
Steve looked into Tony's eyes, not pulling back so that was good. Tony need that physical contact. Steve swallowed, blinking hard. Tony could feel his heart beating furiously. Steve finally opened his mouth.
"I didn't really look into much other than his name, I swear. And it wouldn't have happened if you'd have just let me talk to him at the daycare."
The door closed and Steve walked inside his building, when Tony rested back on his seat, still catching his breath, trying to get his heart to calm the fuck down. He had kissed a lot,
"People. Right. People. Well, yeah, I mean people are mostly wrong. They're - wait, what are they wrong about?"
"Peter, you remember Tony?" Steve asked, making Peter look up from the ball he held in his small hands. "Say 'hi', baby."
"Well, aren't you a charmer?" Steve smirked. He kept his cool despite the blush all over his face, Tony will give him credit for that. Tony loved to do that, make Steve blush, it was an incredible site, and he usually got flustered. Seeing him keep it together was worth a praise. "I see you've met Peter's leg's acquaintance."
Peter enthusiastically nodded while Steve pocketed the ball Peter held in his jacket. As they walked, Tony pulled out his phone and sent a text to Happy to bring the car to where he was dropped off. And sure enough, the car was waiting exactly there.
They mixed the ingredients according to a recipe Steve already knew. After a huge mess made, when the batter was mixed, Steve poured it into a cake pan and it went into the heated oven.
When he woke up, not knowing for how long he had slept, he looked around. There was something weird in the room, something different, his dazed mind still a slave to the affects of sleep couldn't pinpoint. He grumbled sleepily and rolled over onto his stomach, stretching his arm across his massive bed.
"Well look who's talking." Tony found his voice. He was very sure to watch the blush creep through Steve's pale skin.
Steve shook his head. "Nah, we're not leaving just yet. Got here a bit later than usual in case you..."
"She's not your boss, I am." Tony interjected, betrayed. "You're stealing my kids now?" Tony accused Pepper.
"It is everything for Peter. It is everything for him and he loves them very much and I can't do that for him. So don't you say that it's nothing."
Tony had JARVIS open up a list of Disney Pixar movies and picked up Peter in his arms to level them both. All of the Pixar movies were now just a tap away, posters all lined up to be chosen from. Peter was so starstruck by the screens that he didn't answer to any of Tony's or Steve's questions about his preference.
"Where is this coming from, Tony?" Even greater, now Steve seemed scared. Tony wasn't going to have any of that. Nope.
"I'm up. See?" Peter used his fingers to open his eyes as much as he could. Tony moved his hands away and rubbed the side of his face.
"You're sorry?" Peter nodded."And I'm better than JARVIS?" Peter nodded, giggling. "No, no , no. Say it out loud. Let JARVIS hear. I want him to hear."
"That should be me." Tony had said when he texted Steve so the latter could get his number. Steve had seemed hesitant while taking out his phone at first, patting the pocket with a tense smile on his face. Peter had thankfully gained Tony's attention at that point, asking the man about the next time he'll meet him, because apparently he had somewhat won the kid's heart.
Tony had called Steve over for a dinner and a movie in the tower. Peter was tagging along, apparently the kid was thoroughly animated to meet Tony again, or so Steve had voiced.
Soon dessert was brought over. Thanks to Peter clearly stating Steve having a sweet tooth, Tony made sure not to listen to his denials. And he was glad that he didn't because Steve ended up eating it all up, despite his previous refusal.
"I've got plenty to give. And don't talk with your mouth full." Steve batted Tony's arm. Tony poked a tongue out at Steve. Steve shook his head. "You know, the only difference between you and Peter is that Peter actually listens."
The robot obeyed the command as Tony took Peter to the elevator and up to his floor. When the doors opened, he walked to his living room where Steve was already sitting on the sofa, shoes and jacket already discarded. Peter was placed down on his own feet before he ran to his father.
"He's too young to be a rebel anyway. He'll catch up. Give him time." Tony said, purposefully with a mouthful this time.
, the best thing. A thing Tony would categorize as something he was not worthy of or completely undeserving of.
Soon, Steve fell asleep as well, out like a light. Tony knew staring at an unconscious body was considered creepy but he didn't care. Before that he hadn't noticed how stressed Steve actually was. How his normal composure was always tense. Now, having seen the man asleep, he realized this was how he looked like when he wasn't thinking of the issues and problems and responsibilities he had that were burdening his shoulders.
"I have picked out what you'll wear. It's pressed and hanging and waiting for you. I just need to get it out of your closet. I am always prepared. It's why you hired me."
Peter looked at Tony standing not far away and nodded. "Alright, sweetheart. Daddy loves you, alright? And I'll try to be back as soon as I can. I promise."
Mr. Samberg could suck his ass, for all he cared. But somehow Pepper had gotten him to be here, at a park, of all places, waiting for the guy to bring his dog, of all things, so they could discuss the deal they had wanted to get done 'out in the fresh air'. Blergh. Would it have been easier at the office? Maybe so. But was it happening that way? No, it was not.
They sat down at a table by the window, Peter beside Steve and Tony right across from him. Peter started licking the treat all over, getting on his mouth than in it. Steve didn't seem to care much about the mess. "It's no use." He said, but he did cover Peter's shirt with a napkin by tucking it in his collar.
Tony had admitted to not being world's best cook and came clean with having to order in. Steve didn't seem to have any problem with that and Peter had puckered up his face while deciding whether he needed to eat noodles or pizza. When pizza was deemed to be food of choice, the two adults didn't object.
Tony shook his head, a soft and loving smile on his face. He leaned down to give his lips another kiss. "No thank you's." He kissed him again. "None."
"Hey." Steve might've done it on purpose or this was just in his default settings but he pouted those sinful lips of his, offended. Tony had to refrain from cooing.
Tony instantly brought his hand to Steve's hair and started gently stroking the strand, having Steve let out a soft, quiet hum. Steve sighed deeply, looking at the stars.
The two Rogers followed Tony around as he guided them through the three floors and the deck, showing all the bedrooms, bathrooms, the kitchen, the pool, the room with the pool table, the small private cinema, the lake near the backyard. Everything. Steve looked overwhelmed, while Peter just oh-ed and ah-ed at things or didn't care at all.
Steve looked at Tony, eyes full of warmth and affection. "Thanks, Tony. I mean it. And I'm still sorry about being a jerk before. Could I get another chance?"
Steve inhaled, blinking. "Tony... Sweetheart, I... Yes." He nodded, a wide smile covering his face and sudden relief over Tony's. "Of course. Yes. Oh."
Tony chuckled. "Yeah, I had to make up for something I did for a guy and of all the places one could possibly think of, this is what happened." He then answered Peter, who, bless him, was still looking confused having not received his answer. "A business partner is someone you do business with. Kinda like who you work with."
When the evening passed with Peter loving his new friend and Tony happy to watch from the side, only occasionally having to step in. It was interrupted when JARVIS spoke. "Sir, Mr Rogers has arrived and is on his way to your floor."
"No, it's okay." Steve assured, climbing into car, thanking him, and placing Peter right beside him with a firm grip on him.
Tony kept his eyes on Steve's, not wanting to say something wrong and suddenly ruining Steve's mood. He tried to breathe in, a deep one, to calm himself. Then did it again. Then again.
He was pretty sure he needed something to eat so he went to the pretzel guy he saw. He dug out his wallet as he gave an order for one.
"People usually don't. They think it's Bucky, but it was usually him pulling me out of the aftermath. That's his only part in this. He's like a protective big brother."
Tony put a hand on Peter's head, to keep him close. "That's not a table, dear. You know what a robot it?"
Steve then pressed his lips to Tony's, firmly. Yet it was sweet. Everything Steve ever does, Tony would label it sweet.
"What's a business partner?" Yup, Tony was reminded that kids are known to be very curious little things.
"Uh, it's alright, kid. Your dad is right. I was just unlucky enough to have to wear this here." He made a point not to look at Steven, who from close enough was even hotter, if that was possible to begin with. Evidently, it was, as hard as it was to believe so.
"If you're not down within fifteen minutes, I'm coming in there and dragging you by the ear to the orphan house without a care of whatever you have on. I bet it would look great on the front page of everything that exists."
"I mean, I wouldn't say no to you being handsome either, just so you know." Steve muttered, just as Peter came to him raised his arms up to be held.
"This isn't a manhunt. This is... this is something else. Not a manhunt." The doors opened and he stepped into his lab. "Manhunt makes it sound so vicious. Jesus. Lockdown, J."
"Oh, so you know too?" Steve turned to give Peter a playful angry look. The boy laughed and forgot about Steve the very next second as he paid attention to Dino in his hand. Steve sat straight and stared at the road ahead and the surroundings, trying to figure out where they were headed.
He kept sitting on the bench watching people, families enjoying themselves, kids running around. Must be nice, he thought. He never had such a memory to adore.
Soon enough they reached the place. Tony got out first and Peter eagerly followed him. They had developed some weird friendship as they wouldn't shut up throughout the whole ride. Steve joined in from time to time but he let them do all the talking. Tony didn't know why but he did try to make him smile repeatedly.
They had sat down to lunch and Tony had been suspiciously absent. Tony didn't eat all that often, not at school, but he usually sat with the rest of the group and talked to them, but Wednesday afternoon, he was gone from the table. Bucky had mentioned that maybe Tony just wanted some time to himself, so Steve let it go.
. Howard Stark's son. Nobody gave a damn about my personality or what I liked." He sighed and then added, "And they most definitely would've never given me a painting of the two of us cuddling."
Steve felt his heart jump a little when he heard Tony admit he had a crush on someone. Who was it? Was it someone in their little group? Could it maybe be
"He found out and threw a punch. I can't act on my feelings anymore, Steve. I wish I could because this guy...he's the most amazing person I've ever met. So kind and generous, and he's one of the best guys I've ever known. But I can't give this guy everything he deserves, so maybe it's better this way."
There was a new kid coming to town. Now, Steve had been born and raised in Brooklyn, along with practically everyone he knew. Steve and Bucky had known each other since they were three years old, their mothers meeting in the park. Sarah and Winnie became really good friends, which led to Steve and Bucky becoming friends as well.
"I'm not going to bring it up to your father, so don't worry about that," she added softly. "Just whatever you want to tell me, feel free. I'll always be here for you, Antonio. I love you."
It was because of this that Bucky and Steve were pretty much brothers. If you saw Bucky, then Steve was either right next to him or a couple of steps behind. They were a team.
I'm so sorry it's taking me so long for updates. Between taking care of my mom, school, and working, my plate is incredibly full. Not to mention I've come down with a sinus infection that turned into bronchitis so I'm struggling with my health right now too. Thanks for holding on.
The thought hit Steve like a brick wall. Was Tony abused? Did his dad hit him? Did he do worse than that?
"The two of you are going to straighten out whatever's going on," Sarah soothed. "It's going to be okay, son. I promise."
Which was how Steve found himself at Stark Mansion on Saturday afternoon. He'd driven his bike there and had almost been denied entry, but then a man named Jarvis showed up and told security to let him through.
Steve was -- how he was kind but kind of rough on the exterior, but one of the best guys Tony had ever known. He stood up for people who couldn't stand up for themselves, and he was just one of the best guys that Tony ever met.
“Get in,” Colonel Phillips shouted at Steve over the noise that echoed off every wall in the hangar.
“And if I do bare my neck for you Mister former Captain America, what happens to my family’s business? Will it be Hydra’s? Yours?”
“Exactly. My only regret is that it took me so long to realize it and actually take the steps towards change for the company.”
his chest. He started to panic again, unsure of how he was going to keep living like this, but then his father put a gentle hand on his shoulder, and he looked up with wide, sparkling eyes.
When she was gone, Tony let out a whine, shaking more and leaning forward into Steve, taking in his scent with a moan. “I had hoped… that this could have waited a few more days. Would make this surprise mission so much easier.”
Unfortunately, Steve knew a lot about those kinds of things because his dad would often talk to those less fortunate. Women and children that were in abuse shelters. Kids that were in residential foster homes and even youth that were in LGBT shelters.
Steve had been pissed that Bucky had stopped him, but, as Bucky said, someone needed to check on the girl and make sure she was okay. She was violently shaking, skin pale and cheeks flushed; she looked barely two minutes from passing out.
Bucky came from a huge family, and every year, he challenged himself to get the gifts for his sisters that they'd love the best. Four years running, Bucky had gotten Becca, Lottie, and Nellie the gifts they loved the most, and so now, it was a personal goal for him.
And the enthusiasm in Tony's voice made Steve smile softly. He sounded like a kid on Christmas. And even though it was indeed Christmas, Tony had never sounded that small before. Even when he was talking about things he loved, or was passionate about, he had
Tony breached the distance between them and gave Steve a kiss, attacking his lips hungrily. They kissed for a few minutes, Steve's hands going to Tony's dark hair, and tangling his fingers in it.
Their only saving grace had been Tony wasn't financially dependent on Tiberius. He'd always kept money in shell corporations under various aliases and names just in case. While Howard had been a shitty father, he also taught Tony to never pt all his eggs in one basket. After the sale of Stark Industries to Obie, he'd hidden a good portion of the money in investment accounts and diversified funds through Swedish bank accounts. One could never be too careful.
"You're different, Stevie. So's your dad. Actually, your entire family. Not many pastors are like your dad, Steve. Your dad is an amazing man, and he doesn't judge LGBT people, and he most definitely doesn't try to tell us what we're doing wrong. He loves
Steve was a bad boy. And even though he acted a certain way, he still did the right thing. Stood up to bullies. Punched people who were picking on kids smaller than them, beat up people who wouldn't take no for an answer. One time, his best friend, Bucky, had to practically pull him off a fella who was sexually harassing a young girl and almost attacked her right on the street.
Tony Stark was the son of the technical genius, the founder and CEO of Stark Industries, Howard Stark. Even though Tony was only eighteen years old, some people said he was smarter than his father, but they also said that he didn't want anything to do with weapons manufacturing. Stark Industries was famous because of the fact that they had weapons contracts, but Tony wanted no part of that.
Tony begged to drive himself. The last thing he wanted was to be accompanied to school, to look like the spoiled rich boy that everybody thought he was anyway. He was really happy when his parents conceded.
"Pete, we're safe here," Tony soothed his son. "You saw Steve, right? There are two other guys here who are just as big as he is."
"Tony Stark, right?" Clint piped up. Tony watched him closely, and Steve couldn't pinpoint the look on Tony's face, but he
They sat down on the couch together, next to one another, and Steve opened his arms to Tony so he could slide into them. Whenever they cuddled, Steve had quickly learned that Tony liked being the little spoon.
"Tony watches you when you're not looking; you shoot glances at him when he looks away," Bucky continued, as if he wasn't fazed by the look on Steve's face. "You are
"We were just sitting down to lunch," Steve said to Tony when he opened the door. It surprised him at first; he was used to seeing Tony in blue jeans and old band t-shirts, but when he opened the door, Tony was wearing what looked to be an expensive three-piece suit.
Steve, the kid who wore leather jackets and blue jeans, who always wore t-shirts that were at least two sizes too small and made his muscles bulge out in the most enticing way, and his thick thighs were prominent in the jeans he chose to wear. The kid who often cut class and hung out around the back where no teachers ever thought to come looking so he could sneak a smoke.
Leather Jacket kid, the kid who Tony had been watching before class started, he seemed to be pretty damn smart. While Tony hadn't been very happy about being put in a class where he could do the homework with his eyes closed, he decided that he'd go through with the class, because, not only was it a good review for him -- not that he
"Stevie, you deserve better than that, and so does Tony," Bucky said. Nobody really saw the soft and sensitive side of James Barnes very often, but Steve knew why he was doing this. "You know how Tony's dad treats him. He deserves someone who's gonna love him, and I know you already do."
Being the son of Howard Stark, Tony was used to his father's celebrity. He was used to the way people acted around not only Howard, but his family. If you had Stark in your name, people bent over backwards to make you happy.
"Great!" he exclaimed. He looked back to catch his mother's eye. "I met a really nice group of kids. They aren't as smart as me, granted, but they don't look down on me for it."
Tony could easily keep up with any conversation, but Steve noticed how, when Joe brought the conversation around to sports cars, Tony seemed to light up and keep up with any conversation that Joe had brought his way. They were busy debating the best model of the year when Steve got up to help his mom take care of the dishes.
But Maria had begged her son to just go along with what Howard had wanted. To just do what his dad asked, this once, and skip the arguing.
invited them, after all -- but something about a big holiday with Tony was making him really anxious.
And something about Steve, something about how easy-going and how friendly the boy was, he made Tony feel like the weight had just been lifted off of his shoulders.
Instead of Steve being the one to breach the space, Tony did it. A few seconds passed before Tony reached out and cupped Steve's cheek.
Bucky was in a relationship with Natasha, and had been for a while, but everybody knew he was pan. And even though he was, he and Steve had never gone there, and never even wanted to, but Bucky could admit that Steve was very attractive.
Sarah had always had a talent of telling what Steve was feeling, and she'd also always had a talent of being able to calm him down faster than anybody else could. And even though Bucky'd learned how to do it a long time ago, Sarah was faster and way more efficient than even Bucky could be.
"Really?" Sam perked up. He and Rhodey had taken different paths in the Air Force, but after serving together aboard an aircraft carrier for several months, the two became good friends. They still kept in touch every now and again now that Sam had taken his discharge and returned to civilian life. It turned out he didn't want to be a lifer, unlike Rhodey.
However, Tony didn't have time to dwell on the past or regret his life choices. He had a job to find.
how much he affected Tony -- they hadn't gone all the way, and it'd only been a week since that afternoon where Steve had invited Tony and his family to Christmas dinner, but they'd had a few heavy make-out sessions since then that had left them both hard and aching.
They were starting him in geometry; although he was a genius, they wanted to start him in a certain math and then see where he was educationally before moving him to where he needed to go.
Jarvis led Steve up to Tony's room and knocked on the door. When Tony opened the door, he looked Steve up and down, and he could see the embarrassment written all over Tony's face. Well, embarrassment mixed with something that looked a lot like rage.
"He's too good for me," Steve answered, his face flushing beet red. "Besides that, he's not gonna be interested in a
-- but nobody had ever told Steve how beautiful he really was. Maybe because it was because nobody really noticed it.
"Actually, Antonio, I've known for a while. I know you're not ready to tell me, and that's fine, but I wanted you to know that anytime you're ready to tell me
Everybody expected a preacher's kid to be more reserved, but when it came to Steve, a lot of people were just blown away.
"How're you liking Brooklyn?" Natasha asked Tony after a minute had gone by. She opened a container that she brought from home and pulled out a strawberry, biting into it. "It's real different than what you're used to, right?"
After slamming his locker shut and going off to geometry, which was their first period of the day, that's when their friends Natasha and Clint sidled up next to them.
The painting was a picture of himself and Tony. His sketchbook was full of drawings of Tony -- even though he didn't really want Tony to know about it -- and, when he'd been bored in geometry one afternoon, he'd drawn a picture of himself and Tony cuddled on the couch.
His father had just finished the prayer when the doorbell rang. They all knew that Steve was expecting Tony, so they weren't surprised in the least when Steve leapt up to answer the door. Usually, they didn't answer the door during mealtimes -- they ate on a schedule, so anybody who was close to the Rogers family knew that they'd just have to come back later -- but they all knew that Steve needed to talk to Tony, and he had made it very clear that he and Tony were going to have a very important chat.
, he'd said when Tony asked for his name -- who everybody seemed to like -- he sat down and just wanted to be ignored. He didn't want anybody to bring attention to him.
He talked about the group as a whole. How friendly and outgoing they were. How nice they were and even how Tony had taken to tutoring one of them -- Clint -- in geometry, and, in return, Clint was teaching Tony ASL.
"I know it's too early to say it," Tony added quickly. "We haven't even been on our first date yet, but you have treated me so well and unlike anybody ever has. I've had feelings for you for a long time, but when I saw this, I realized it was love."
"That month guy come in yet, Stevie?" He asked, not even looking away from his newspaper. Steve looked up when Bucky spoke. He forgot about Bucky's Vulcan-like hearing; nothing got past his friend. Steve just nodded.
Tony always kissed Steve like it was the last time he ever was going to, and that was bittersweet for Steve. He loved that Tony kissed him that way, but did Tony do it because he was expecting Steve to leave?
thing, and Tony could've kissed her for it. He knew who he was, he knew that he was smarter than a good portion of the population, but he didn't want to bring anybody's attention to it.
"Are you upset?" Steve asked. When Clint and Rhodey had assured Steve that Tony would love the painting, nobody mentioned that he'd get so emotional when seeing it.
"What's the matter, Tones?" Steve asked softly. He patted the bed beside him, and Tony took the hint, sitting down. "Did I do something wrong?"
"Don't be dumb, Stevie," Bucky was saying to him that morning, when Steve was in his closet, trying to figure out what to wear. "Why not just your jeans and one of those ridiculously tight shirts?"
He sat on the bed, and maybe it was because Steve was anxious, but it felt like an eternity passed before Tony came through his bedroom door. He closed the door with a quiet
"Things are going to be okay, Stevie," his mom said as she ruffled his hair. She had to stand up on her tiptoes to do it, but Steve inherently loved it, and if he always bent down a little so she could reach a little better, he never mentioned it.
When he got to the locker room, without anyone seeing him thankfully, Tony sat on the bench in the screened off area he had put on his uniform in before. It smelled like Steve, which made Tony feel a little bit better, but his chest was hurting again, as well as his stomach. He tried to sit upright as he looked over his blood soaked uniform. He groaned at the sight, noting for future reference that red was a bad color for his uniform. Sighing, Tony kicked his boots off, and he almost fell off the bench from the simple action. There was something wrong with him, and he really didn’t feel good the more he thought about it. His stomach churned and his chest hurt with a pain that felt physical and emotional, which of course made sense to him. He had just lost his alpha, whom he was mated to, and that bond alone was painful to have when one side of that bond died. Tony wanted to scream, but his throat hurt too much to make any sound. He remained silent, thinking, mourning as he took parts of  his uniform off. He just wanted to get into comfortable clothes and curl up with his mother, maybe have her read him a story and sleep in his bed with him, just so he didn’t feel so alone.
Steve’s mind was completely blank from any thoughts other than the singular thought of his duty as an alpha that motivated him to keep going, thrust deeper and harder. Bond with the omega, bite his neck, put a baby in his stomach. Somewhere in the back of his mind there was a slight opposition of the thought of claiming Tony for good, that promise of waiting until they married to finally bond, which would happen after the war was over. It felt like such a long time to wait, but Steve was still a respectable alpha, and he wasn’t going to violate a promise he made to his omega simply because he was in rut.
Steve walked into the lobby of the Stark Tower with his portfolio in hand and headed to the receptionist with the best smile he could offer.
On top of the soldiers preferring omegas over Captain America, Tony could feel his body preparing for heat. He was spending his first heat away from home, outside of the US even. He was glad he had Steve with him, but at the same time, it was honestly scary. Tony had packed some of the basic things he would need, knowing his heat would happen while in Europe. He just hadn’t expected it so soon. They had barely been in Italy for a week before his body started to ache in his stomach and a bit in his chest. He really wished that he had some suppressant pills, but his father had never let him get any, and his mother was unsure of them, since they were a fairly new revolution in the medical world. After all, why would any omega want to put a stop to the suffering of heats every cycle?
Tony jumped at the cold towel hitting his red bottom, but after a bit it began to feel nice, having the cool, gentle towel cleaning him, even though Steve had used a condom and there wasn’t much to clean up other than dried slick and sweat. Regardless, it still felt nice to be taken care of after sex.
“Oh don’t you dare get grease all over my nice furnisher, Anthony. Go fetch your dirty stool of shame from the closet!” Miss Potts said.
Looking at the night stand beside the bed, tony briefly panicked as he saw the ring he wore, and he worried that Steve had left his. Looking over at the other side of the bed, he was relieved to find the ring gone, which meant that Steve had indeed taken his ring with him.
Howard and Maria had been sitting in the parlor when their son entered the room, looking like he had been crying yet again, but like he was humbled by something. Both parents ushered their son closer to sit with them on the sofa.
“Colonel Phillips couldn’t get me to leave you if he said the president urgently wanted to talk to me.”
“Well thank god for them, but you really do need sleep. Not getting proper sleep can harm your health severely. I’d hate to see you suffer because of your habit of not sleeping properly.”
"Now who's rambling?" Ton smirked, granting him with a blushing Steve who shut his mouth. "You think I'm cute?" The blush grew darker. "I mean I would've gone for handsome but cute works too if that's what you think."
Peter stopped walking and fisted his hand on his sides, looking at Tony, a large angry pout on his face. Trying to be intimidating, Tony assumed. The man held his hands up in surrender. "Alright, buddy. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right, though, you're daddy is always right. So you should always listen to him, okay?" Tony raised a finger at him.
"You wanna shake hands?" Tony shook hands with the bot to show how it would be if Peter wanted to do it too. Peter brought his chubby hand forward and Dum-E grabbed it in his claw and moved it gently up and then down. Peter shrieked in excitement. When Dum-E released his hand, Peter wiggled his legs which, Tony had learned by now, meant to put him down. When he did so, Peter ran the few steps they were away from Dum-E's body.
"Uh, I think i left my uh... watch in the men's room." He surreptitiously covered the watch he was oh-so evidently wearing. "I'll be a moment." He held a finger up to Pepper and almost turned to walk the other way when Pepper grabbed his arm.
Pepper had said to just go the Thai place Tony loved, knowing very well that the restaurant was five star quality.
. Words at the tip of of his mouth. They could fall off any minute. Tony felt overwhelmed with the emotion. His heart felt like it would burst out. They had been together for almost four months and he can't find himself to think of a life without Steve. Or his little son.
Steve smirked, the bastard, and turned to flip the pancake on the pan. "They're coming along just fine. Can you get the plates out?"
"Oh, sweetheart, I'm nothing compared to you." He kissed Steve's neck, and what a beautiful neck it was. "Let me show you."
Peter slowly climbed onto Tony's lap from Steve's and hesitantly pecked Tony's cheek and climbed down and ran to his previous position on the bean bag. "I guess that's all I get."
"I think you're going over to make a move on that poor guy over there." She said, pointing at the guy.
"Yeah. He's met Dum-E. And he loved him. He said you would too. It's okay if you don't want to though."
Before that day, Steve had never once mentioned Peter's mother. Never. Not even a clue of her. Tony was under the delusion that there might've been an ugly divorce. But now seeing Steve's condition, he realized even thinking about her had caused Steve immense pain. He wasn't sure if Peter knew about his mother, but he wasn't going to ask or judge any of that.
Steve bit down on his lower lip, an act Tony wouldn't mind doing himself. In fact, he would be quite eager. He blinked before smiling warmly. "Alright then. See you then, Tony. If you're not busy."
Peter helped with what he could, mostly just helped in keeping Tony busy while Steve did all the cooking. The two played with some of Peter's packed toys, kept Steve company in the kitchen.
"She pa... it was today. Three years ago. Today." Steve looked up to see Tony. "I just miss her so much." His words broke into sobs again.
"Not a dress. But three dresses." Tony showed three fingers to Peter who focused on the figures now rather than his face.
Steve turned to put the plate on the table and saw Tony standing there. He put the plate and smiled. "Hey there." He walked to Tony to give him a kiss.
"Peter! We don't say things like that to people. Apologize." He turned to Tony, with an apologetic look of his own. "I'm sorry about him-" His expressions turned into recognition. "Uh, sorry." He nudged Peter.
"It's okay," He assured Steven before he looked down at Peter, "I had to meet up with a business partner of sorts here for some unknown reason."
Good thing Steve had already given him a key. He walked in and was about to call for Steve when he found the guy on the kitchen floor, back to the wall.
Steve nodded quickly and Tony got a sheet from inside the library that was covering a single couch and spread it on the floor. He got a few cushions too. He laid down and Steve laid down with his head on Tony's stomach, so they were in a T-shape.
He couldn't bare the devastated look on Steve's face, even if the other man was doing a great job at hiding it, Tony will give him credit for that. But, no. Not in this household. Not under Tony's roof. Not when Tony can rid him of the sorrow with just three words. Three very truthful, genuine words.
Steve grinned at Tony and kissed him again. "Sit. Breakfast time." Completely ignoring Tony's words.
fine. Not at all. Tony hadn't loved someone in so long, hadn't loved someone who didn't turn out to stab him in the back. He had no experience loving someone who actually reciprocated the feeling. Not his parents, not his godfather, not a friend, not even a romantic partner. There was an irrational-bordering-rational fear that clinged to his every breath that if he loved someone, that would give them the power to hurt him. And he had been hurt uncountable times. And that's saying something, Tony is all about math. He knew how to damn well count.
"See? I've got J and I know enough myself." No, he did not. "So don't worry and get to your asshole of a boss who doesn't have any compulsion of being rational."
Steve released his bottom lip from between his teeth. "Well, what if you realize that you can't get much from me?"
There might be a delay in posting the next chapter. Tuesday is chemo day and it takes my mom about four days to recover, and she needs my help. She wasn't responding to the first chemo, so the newer one she's on is rather aggressive.
Sam was in the backyard, raking the fallen leaves. There were many trees in the yard of the bed and breakfast, some that Sarah had planted when she'd started the hotel what seemed like a lifetime ago. Steve loved those trees, and every few years he had another one planted in his mom's memory. Everybody who worked at the B&B knew how much those trees meant to Steve.
to comment on it, even though Steve knew it was going to be incredibly hard for Joe to hold his tongue.
to be Tony Stark. Steve himself hadn't ever seen Tony Stark before, but the whole school was aware of Tony's arrival and he was the only new kid that was coming this week, so it had to be him. But what surprised Steve the most was that Tony Stark was beautiful.
"Tell me, Tony, who's the guy you're crushing on?" Steve's voice was soft and tentative, but he needed to know what was going through Tony's head. Even if it wasn't Steve, he needed to know what was going through his friend's head.
"Hey, Steve-o," Tony said softly when he saw him. Looking back, he saw that his parents were busy introducing themselves to the others, so Steve leaned in and gave Tony a kiss.
He led him to a table, and Tony stopped in his tracks when he saw that Rhodey was leading him over to where the beautiful boy, Leather Jacket kid from geometry class, was sitting, surrounded by a few kids. Two other boys and a girl.
"I know you're nervous, baby," Sarah said soothingly as she put the turkey in the oven, "and I know that you like Tony a lot. But you need to calm down or else you're going to hyperventilate."
"We've gotta go out there, Tones," Steve murmured against his lips. "We don't have time for a make-out session right now."
"Why would you ask me that?" he asked, and Maria could tell by the look on her son's face that Tony was starting to panic.
"Bring her over here," Steve offered without even thinking about it. He hadn't needed to ask his parents about it; they'd opened their home to other people for Christmas dinner many times before. "Jarvis and Ana, too, if they want. Mom always makes too much, anyway."
As Steve reached into his locker to pull out his geometry textbook, he gave his best friend a tired glance.
When he walked into his class that morning, aided by the guy the school had set him up with -- a nice kid named James Rhodes --
"C'mon, Tony, come and sit down next to me," Bucky said, moving over so there was a space between himself and Steve. After shooting him a look, Steve understood why Bucky did that -- he could see the vulnerability in Tony as well as Steve could.
"I'm not as stupid as you and your father think I am," Maria joked, but then saw the serious look on her son's face.
Sooner than Tony realized it, it was lunchtime. Tony didn't really eat all that much, and he definitely never really ate at school, but before he could get out of it, Rhodey had grabbed Tony's arm and said, "C'mon, man, come sit with me and my friends."
Tony did not have many regrets in life, but the most critical thing he ever regretted was staying with that bastard for as long as he did. The moment he started to see his younger self in Peter, he knew it had all gone bad and he had to do what his mother never could; take his child and go. He regretted deeply he let it go on that long, that he'd ever put Peter in that situation.
"I make way too much every holiday," Sarah explained. "I always give Bucky some to take home, but I want you to take some." She watched Maria and then added, "I also made a cherry pie. I was told it was Tony's favorite."
Steve nodded. "Yeah. Used his manners and everything. I'm gonna show him the playroom after he and his dad get settled."
. There was a kid standing in the back of the room, about three people around him, and they seemed to be animatedly chatting. He was tall, had a lot of bulk on him, with short blond hair and crystal blue eyes. He had kind of an All-American kind of charm to him, and it made Tony automatically think of fireworks and apple pie.
“No, Rogers, Jesus,” Tony gasps, offended. “I am not asking my AI to research gay sex for me, have some respect for the poor thing's nerves!”
“No, no, Steve, it's fine, just,” Tony rambles, because this is starting to actually feel good now and they should both get to finish sometime this century. “Just, see, this one. Then touch me.”
Steve looked up at him without really raising his head, and Tony thought he'd never seen anyone more beautiful. “You... Really?”
Steve holds impossibly still, the only movement he makes little tremors that Tony can feel in the steely abdomen pressed against his ass and back.
Steve shuts him up with a kiss, and they start making out against the fridge, but then Steve pops wood again, and Tony admits he's too tired for a round two.
Natasha came sashaying into the kitchen, those magnificent hips swinging. “Are we going to the beach? I love the beach.”
Tony stares at him. Then he grabs Steve's dick and tugs on it a little, and Steve heaves for breath. “This, Rogers. This goes in my ass. I think. I mean, I've done anal before, only it was with a woman. The rules have to be the same, right? I mean, that part of our anatomy is pretty much the same.”
Tony breathes. Steve waits. And, after a minute, Tony exhales and notices that it doesn't hurt any more.
Then, finally, Steve moves in and begins pushing. And where Steve's super soldier American ass absolutely refused to be defiled by Tony, Tony's ass doesn't have much of a fight to put up against Steve's super soldier American dick.
“Uh, yeah, Steve, I don't think I'm up for the reverse cowgirl my first time,” Tony says, grinning into Steve's mouth. “Easier if you just get on top.”
“Well... Maybe we can try it the other way around,” Steve says, hesitant. “I mean... if you'd like to.”
“Nope,” Tony said, cocking his head to one side. “Not by any conceivable moral standard. Try again.”
“Nope, not unless I'm actually cooking for other people,” Tony countered. “Jarvis, breakfast foods. I want Danish pastries. Order them.”
It takes a little more shuffling, but finally, Steve is back between Tony's legs, Tony is crunching as hard as he can to tilt his hips up for Steve, and then Steve pushes back inside him. Steve keeps his weight off Tony, leaning on one hand so he can use the other to grab Tony's dick and pull. It's a little dry but Tony moans with pleasure anyway.
“Friends!” Thor boomed, striding into the kitchen. He was carrying a bakery box. “The most excellent Jarvis tells me that these are traditional Midgardian foods to accompany tea or coffee. As I love coffee, I am certain I will love these also.”
Steve has been trying to get over his feelings because he knows Tony doesn't normally do relationships, and Tony has been very confused because he's never gotten hard over seeing a man naked before. But in the end, Tony being hard and gaping at Steve is just the push that the captain needs, and he kisses the shorter man for the first time. Then Tony gets this “Oh! Oh, I get it now!” expression on his face, and kisses him back.
“Really,” Tony said, then leaned in to nuzzle affectionately into Steve's neck. “I'll even put on some pants, just for you.”
Steve goes slow, and it's starting to feel good, and Tony starts grinding his own cock into the pillows. Then Steve lets out a strangled groan and stops.
“If I'd like to? Steve, I've been getting hard over you in the showers for months. I've been fantasizing about this for weeks. Yes, I want to!” Tony exclaims.
Steve, not convinced, grabs Tony right back and strokes his dick a little. Tony bites his lip. “Well, why doesn't
Tony is rubbered up and Steve is on his hands and knees – Tony wanted him to be on his back but Steve insists this will be easier. He'd had a medical exam just like this once, he explains. Tony isn't quite level with Steve where it really counts, though, so he grabs a pillow to kneel on. Then he gets the lube open.
“Jarvis, I'm so sorry,” Steve said, looking up at the ceiling. “I didn't know it was locked.” Then he frowned. “Wait a minute. Why was it locked?”
Needless to say, when the two of them finally figure things out and realise they're in love with each other, there are certain expectations of how things are going to go.
“You wanna... maybe take a nap? Then we can, you know, when we wake up. Try again?” Tony suggests, and averts his eyes.
“But I want to do this,” Tony says firmly. “I mean, I think I'm going to go to a sex shop and ask for advice on toys and preparation and stuff. Because obviously, if it's awkward and uncomfortable every time then we're doing something wrong, right? The first time is one thing. Next time, I want to be able to do the whole reverse cowgirl thing without doing something awkward.”
“See, Steve, nobody takes this seriously except you. It's just skin; not even that much of it. Also, it's my house. I can do what I want in my house, right?”
“It's frustrating!” Steve snapped, shooting to his feet and beginning to pace the kitchen. “Honestly, Tony, not all of us are capable of ignoring half-naked people without getting a little hot and bothered!”
Tony gets back on the bed so fast he just about gives himself whiplash. Steve is struggling with a condom packet and Tony is shaking the lube bottle to get it ready, and then finally, the condom is out and in Steve's massive hands.
“And here I thought we were being pretty, well, pretty normal for people having sex,” Steve says, grinning into his glass of milk.
“Yeah, but there's... Tony, I didn't think you'd be offended,” Steve said, looking at the floor. He was frowning. “I just didn't think you'd feel the same way.”
Steve grins and puts his arms around Tony. He'd clearly like that, too, from the way he palms Tony's ass and grinds against the engineer. They roll around a bit, trying to find a comfortable position, and then one of them bites a shoulder, and they both get a lot more eager.
“No, not really,” Tony tries to reassure him, then hisses as Steve suddenly pulls out. “Ow, okay, now you hurt me!”
“I'm sorry,” the shorter man says. “I kinda can't stop myself. I really, really want some fucking to happen at some point in future.”
“No, really, I want you to, just, uh, no teeth? It kinda hurts,” Steve says, and wow, the man is crimson all over with how hard he's blushing.
“Really awkward, and kind of funny in the wrong way,” Tony sighs, reaching up to hug Steve firmly to him. “And you're really, really heavy. It was great.”
“Steve? I think your super soldier ass is refusing to be penetrated by lowly engineers,” Tony says, and sits back. “I think even those muscles are super serum strong.”
Steve struggles a little, turning the condom over, then grabs it and – puts his finger right through the thin rubber. It breaks. Steve gapes at Tony. “How did that happen?”
“Lock the doors, Jarvis!” Tony huffed, already winded. He followed Steve, turning the hallway corner just in time to see Steve rip the door to his room off its hinges.
Tony tries again, careful to cover his teeth, and this time Steve starts moaning, so something must be going right. Tony remembers some of his own favourite blow jobs, and tries to do that thing that Tina used to do, cupping his balls and maybe rolling them a little.
Tony was still gaping at Steve. Steve, who was apparently sexually frustrated by the sight of him pants-less. Steve was just realising what he'd admitted, and was beginning to flush a magnificent brick red.
Tony backs up a little, but he's still straddling Steve, and this is so confusing. “Well, yeah, with girls. Women. Steve, I've fucked hundreds of women but I've never actually hooked up with a man!”
Tony smiled widely. “I could do that, yeah. Or I could do you one better and help you out with that sexual frustration.”
“Well, it's not pliable either, so this is clearly not happening,” Tony sighs in frustration. “Jeez, and all I wanted today was a little sex.”
“Tony, we can't do this if it hurts,” Steve says, looking almost tearful. “We can do other things! Like earlier, we don't need to do this!”
Steve Rogers, on the other hand, has kissed two women before he went into the ice, and, well, exactly no women that counted since he came out. That is to say, he's not kissed anyone that he really wanted to kiss since Peggy. And, needless to say, he has slept with exactly zero women. But he was in the army, and he was friends with Bucky before the war. He's heard things. He knows things. Surely, some of the things he knows must be worth something. Even if his sexual orientation runs more along the lines of “hopeless romantic”.
Which makes even Steve's poor, bitten lip fail as a safety measure, and the super soldier comes, too, making this shocked, breathy noise as he bucks erratically into Tony.
“You wanna come back to my place? Uh, my room?” Tony asks, grinning up at Captain America. “I mean, since the elevator is right over there. And we're kinda in my house. Building. Whatever.”
Tony tries not to laugh. “Super soldier strength? Don't worry about it, Cap, I've got more. Here, let me.”
“Speak for yourself, I think I'm doing pretty good with not dying from being impaled on your Kraken cock,” Tony huffs, then hesitates. “Should I... Should I spread my legs, maybe?”
“Yeah, sorry, Thor,” Tony said, then put his mug down and flat-out ran after Steve. “Steve! Wait up, Steve!”
So it's off with Tony's unused condom, Steve gets a towel and starts mopping up all the spilled lube, and Tony starts building a little pillow barrier across the bed.
never done this before!” Steve says, then sits up. “Wait, Tony, what do you mean you've never done this before? You're... you're a playboy!”
“Tony!” Steve sputtered, outraged, as Tony wandered into the kitchen one morning in search of coffee. Well, technically it was early afternoon, but Tony was awake and working.
“We were, but you're ninety and I'm about halfway there,” Tony says with a sleazy grin. “I mean, it's a miracle your heart didn't give out. Especially when the condom -”
“I can't... get it in. Here, let me try with my fingers,” Tony suggests, and presses two fingers against Steve's entrance.
They stare at each other. Then they kiss again, and then Steve, being the stronger one, rolls them so that Tony is on top.
“Yeah?” Steve asks hopefully, lifting his head to finally look Tony in the eye. “Would you, uh, maybe like to do it again some time?”
Tony is back on his front over the pillows, Steve is shuffling in behind his spread legs, and then Steve starts rubbing lube into Tony's ass, and wow, that feels really nice. Tony sighs and tilts his ass even further up so Steve can have full access.
“No, this should be more than just pretty good,” Steve gasps, and slowly pulls out of Tony. “I think you need to be on your back.”
“Night-stand drawer,” Tony mumbles into Steve's awesome pectorals, which he's kissing. “Condoms and lube.”
Steve comes in his mouth, no warning or nothing. Just a huge spurt of viscous, bitter slime down Tony's throat. The engineer sputters, Steve moans, and things get messy for a little while. Tony runs to the bathroom to spit and rinse, and Steve desperately tries to get himself back under control.
They do start with that. And it turns out it's pretty easy to make them both come at the same time when they're face to face like that, both of them hands-on, so to speak. Then they shuffle into Tony's ensuite bathroom, both of them a little shy and slightly embarrassed, and clean off, and then back to the bed.
Steve gets those out, and then Tony moves down to take Steve's dick into his mouth, and suddenly Steve yelps and pulls that messy, brown-haired head off him.
Steve stopped and stood staring at the door handle in his hand as it came loose and the door fell noisily to the floor. “I... what?”
“Tony, where's the box of various nuts and bolts gone?” Bruce asked as he refilled his mug. “I need one that's slightly worn.”
“Yeah,” Tony breathes, and he matches Steve's movements. “Yeah, this is nice. We could start with this.”
“Sure I would, like, twice a day if we can get me some Viagra,” Tony grins. “I mean, not a super soldier here, Steve, and not gonna lie: that refractory period is just ridiculous.”
“Really, Rodgers,” Tony said, then put a hand on Steve's shoulder. “Hey. I'm kinda frustrated over you, too, y'know? Those pecs. Those shoulders. That ass.”
An awkward silence falls over the bedroom. They're both still naked, and this is so incredibly awkward. Tony fidgets a little. Steve clears his throat and stares at Tony's chest, where the arc reactor glows cheerfully.
They get in the elevator, and Steve kisses Tony again, and the genius billionaire playboy philanthropist puts his hands right on Steve's American ass and gropes. Things develop quickly from there, and by the time they stumble out on Tony's private floor, Steve is trying to get Tony's shirt off and Tony is trying to untie his shoes.
And with a shove, Steve is all the way inside him and Tony can't help but whimper a little. Wow, that's a lot of cock. A huge, pulsating, thrumming amount of cock that is making it impossible for Tony to even think, let alone speak. So he whimpers into the pillow.
“No, please, Tony,” Steve said, looking anguished. “I'm sorry about what I said in the kitchen. I shouldn't have mentioned anything. Please just forget about it.”
“Captain America is headed for his rooms, sir,” Jarvis said politely. “Shall I attempt to dissuade him from barricading himself within?”
“Uh, y'know, your dick. In my ass. You on top?” Tony says, and weirdly looks uncomfortable saying it. “I've never done this before.”
Steve shook his head, still avoiding Tony's eyes. “About me. I was in the Army, Tony, do you really think I'd get flustered over seeing just any guy in his shorts? It's... It's you. Not the pants.”
“I sleep naked, you're just lucky I put clothes on before I go downstairs to work,” Tony said. “What, it's not like you wouldn't see as much of me on the beach.”
Steve nodded. “Yeah. But you don't, I mean, I think you don't play that field, and that's okay, and we can just forget about it, but I thought... Maybe you can start wearing pants around me. Please.”
“Well, this is awkward,” Tony says, and is that a blush he can feel? Wow, he hasn't blushed during sex since his late teens!
So Tony gets back up, and together, they figure out how to get the condom rolled down over Steve's super soldier dick, and then Tony applies lube a little less liberally than he did to himself. Steve, on an afterthought, puts some lube in his hand and nods back at the pillows. “For you, too, I think.”
And the awe and pure want in that voice makes Tony bite the pillow and not say anything, because he wants Steve to have this. To really, really love his first time, despite all the mess they've made of it so far.
“Not joking, so not joking,” Tony assured him. “Really, Steve. Have you met me? Nothing sexual is ever offensive to me. And I mean, ever.”
“My hip,” Tony groans, and then starts laughing, because what the fuck? “I think... I think I pulled a muscle or a joint or something. I'm too old to keep up with you, apparently.”
“Well, maybe just a movie? Or, uh, a dirty picture or something?” Steve asks, rubbing at the back of his neck nervously. “I mean, just for a basic idea of what goes where.”
Steve does, and they do. Steve is naked, Tony is naked, and Steve is kissing the other man. They're both on the bed, they're both lying down, and then they're suddenly both lying on their backs next to each other on the duvet.
“Actually...” Steve said, arms coming up around Tony. “I don't mind so much, if you're serious about the making out.”
“I think I'd better be lying down for this,” he explains, and positions himself so that his hips are on the pillows, tilted up, and his ass is at the perfect angle for whatever Steve might want to do with it.
Steve's blush intensifies. “Well, sure, if you want. But, uh, the serum? I'm gonna be good to go again in... I guess, ten minutes.”
“Not cold, not doing anything that requires protective gear from the waist down,” Tony grinned. He was beginning to enjoy this. “Seriously, Steve, up your game. The forties will be so disappointed with you, failing to uphold their strict sartorial demands. Shame on you, Rogers. Shame.”
“Well, he's got the legs for it,” Natasha said, picked up an apple and bit into it. With an arched eyebrow, she looked Tony up and down and left the kitchen, Clint trailing after her.
The Rogers and Barneses had lived in the same apartment complex for a long time. And George Barnes had a drinking habit that everybody knew about, so it wasn't odd for Bucky to come over and hide out at the Rogers' apartment, because, as he'd often told Steve and his parents, he just didn't want to be around when his old man was hitting the bottle.
"I mean just what I said. If you ever need to talk, to get something off your chest, just come to me, okay? I promise I won't judge you."
Dinner went nicely, with great food and conversation. As usual, Sarah had made too much, and told Maria that she was welcome to take some home.
Steve shrugged, "If it's okay with your dad, I'll show you later. After the two of you have settled."
"Master Tony talks about you all the time," he'd said, walking Steve through the mansion. "He regales Ana and myself with stories about your school life constantly."
"That really is, Antonio," his mother smiled. She had always known that Tony wasn't straight -- she wasn't sure what label to put on it, because Tony never really said anything to his parents about it -- and she knew that Howard would have a hard time accepting their son if he ever found out.
"What, haven't you ever gotten a kiss hello?" Steve asked him with a teasing smile. When Tony looked at the ground, Steve's smile dissipated, "You haven't, have you?"
"I'm alright," Tony mumbled. Food was passed around and Tony took a generous helping of everything. Steve watched him for a moment in awe; he'd
Tony just nodded. Steve had a bit of anger at the way that Tony was so timid, but it wasn't at the boy himself. He just realized when somebody's gone through something so traumatic, they just didn't want to be vulnerable to anybody else. Bucky could be like that on occasion.
, was the first thing that went through Steve's head when Tony leaned forward and captured Steve's lips in a chaste kiss.
"Look, Stevie," Bucky sighed. "Tasha and I have a thing going on, but you're not gonna deflect. What's going on with you and Tony?"
Everybody in school knew how he was, but nobody wanted to tell his parents. Joe and Sarah Rogers were devout in their religion, but nobody wanted to break it to them that their son was a regular juvenile delinquent.
About half an hour later, Bucky sat down to watch TV with Sarah -- which, it had been strange the first time he did it, but Bucky felt like Joe and Sarah were second parents to him, and he spent a lot of time doing things with the two of them, so it didn't really seem as weird anymore -- and Steve and Tony went into his bedroom.
you to say it back until you're sure you feel it. But," he added, looking into Steve's crystal blue eyes, "when you
fella. You weren't afraid to go after Peggy two years ago, and you most definitely weren't shy about flirting with Sam Wilson last year, either."
"What's the deal with you and Nat?" was what Steve decided to answer with, even though that was technically another question.
He turned it around and showed it to his mom -- which, Steve knew that Maria and Tony were close -- and said, "Look, Mom! Steve painted me a picture of us!"
Steve grinned. "A friend of Rhodey's is a friend of mine," he stated. "Welcome to the bed and breakfast."
Steve had gone back and forth on what to give Tony. Tony pretty much had anything anybody could want -- and he had the kind of money to buy whatever he wanted. Even though his father tended to be strict about his money, Maria was often generous and gave Tony as much money as he wanted.
He thought about Pepper every single day. Her death had been a total shock to him; at times he still felt like it wasn't real. The accident that took her from him had been so sudden. Tony wished he could go back to that day and rewrite it. Pepper had been his voice of reason, the person who could talk him into, or out of, anything. Pepper had been there for him every single day of his life since they were kids, and one day, she was just gone. He hadn't adjusted to raising Peter alone and without anyone to assist. That was how Tiberius Stone wormed his way into his and Peter's lives.
"I've heard that about you," Tony commented. He grabbed his duffel bag and lifted it over his shoulder. "A good friend of mine did research on you guys before I decided to stay here."
Steve showed Tony and Peter to their room. "This is the nicest room we've got," he told him. "If you need anything, Sam, Bucky, and Natasha, or I will be around. If you have any problems or requests, let me know. We want to make your stay the most comfortable."
"Yes, Mr. Edwards, I see it here." Tony handed her a few bills and, as she rang him up, he noticed her eyes went towards the boy who was half-hidden behind him.
"But how do we know we can trust them?" Peter asked, his voice shaking a bit and tears welling up in his eyes. Tony hated that look and distrust. Peter was ten years old. He shouldn't have to worry about the trustworthiness of random hotel owners at his age.
"Steve, I..." Tony's voice trailed off, but then he shook his head. "Steve, you should just get outta here. I'll come by your place tomorrow."
Ty had been a friend of an acquaintance. Honestly, with the kind of people that Tony hung around with after Pepper's death, it wasn't surprising that he'd met someone like Tiberius Stone. Those were dark days he wished he could go back and change.
was the word Tony had used, but he'd also used it as a more friendly term than anything. He talked about how
"Uncle Rhodey told me so," Tony said, which was closes to the truth. "One of them was in the Air Force with him. And you know he would never have told me to come here if we couldn't trust them."
When asked how Clint could go to school and be deaf at the same time, Tony had explained to his mom that Clint could hear with hearing aids and he also could read lips like a pro.
Tony went into the bathroom, and when he didn't come out in ten minutes, Steve knocked on the door, "Tony? You okay?"
"What happened to not asking the guy out?" Steve asked, feeling a little kiss drunk, but managed to string a sentence together.
"I'm here to see you, Tony," Steve replied, and he couldn't help the hurt that laced through his voice. "I haven't seen you the last three days and I've been worried about you. If I didn't know better, I'd think that you were avoiding us."
Bucky could easily sleep until one or two in the afternoon if he didn't have to get up. Steve was an early riser -- he always had been, he was up and on his morning jog by
"So what's the deal with you and Tony?" Bucky asked, removing the unlit cigarette from behind his ear and lighting it. He took a drag of the cigarette and then looked at his friend, noting the surprised look on Steve's face, like that was the last thing he'd ask him.
Tony was so used to being shunned, especially at the old high school he used to go to. He was the smart kid, the kid who had a father who was not only a celebrity, but an asshole and a well-known womanizer. Howard had stepped out on his wife for
"Our new guest has arrived. His name is Tony and he'll be staying here a month," Steve stated, watching his friend. Sam straightened up, wiping the sweat from his brow, and took a drink of water from the bottle attached to his tool belt. He turned to face Steve. Steve knew that face; Sam was waiting for more information. "He's got a boy, around ten, it looks like."
There weren't a lot of people in Steve's family -- just his parents and himself. His grandparents on either side had already passed, and both Joe and Sarah Rogers were only children. The trip was actually more for Bucky himself.
When his son left the room, Tony laid back and let a sigh escape his lips. If Pepper were alive, she would have killed Tony. She wouldn't have understood how he could've gotten involved with someone like Tiberius Stone -- especially after having someone as amazing as her.
"You guys like each other," Bucky said, stating it as fact. He'd known Steve long enough to know that Steve was going to deny it. He watched Steve's blue eyes carefully before plucking the cigarette from between his lips and said, "Deny it all you want, Stevie, but you two watch each other like hawks, but only when the other's not looking."
Bucky laughed, and Steve smiled. "It's November, doll," he said. "This kind of weather is to be expected. Just be happy it isn't snowing yet."
Her voice was soft, gentle. It was at that moment that Steve understood why Tony and Maria were so close.
, unlike a lot of those so-called 'Christian' folks that are around now. So what makes you think Tony's gonna judge you on that?"
When Tony nodded, Steve shrugged. "I know Rhodey. He was in the Air Force with Sam. Sam retired a couple of years ago, but he and Rhodey stayed in touch. You're a friend of his?"
"That's Natasha, behind the counter," Steve introduced Tony and Peter. "There are a few other staff members. Sam lives here with me, and Tasha and Bucky live just down the block. We are a tight-knit group."
"We're cozier than most," came a masculine voice from behind them. Tony turned and froze; the man standing there was tall, with more muscles and sleekest hip-to-shoulder ratio Tony had ever seen. He breathed in deep as he took in the man's blond hair and blue eyes. He momentarily saw someone else standing there. Tony took a few minutes to remind himself he was safe.
"Yeah. Said he's been his friend for years. I'm nt sure how to make him feel more at ease and welcome."
There is mentions of child abuse, domestic violence, and of course Howard being a shitty parent. But nothing too graphic; most of it is just mentioned in passing.
If there was any way to get her son to open up to her, it'd be to ask him about school. Maria's mind wasn't as advanced as her husband and son's were, but, instead of acting like she was an idiot, Tony would always take time to explain things to her.
-- but call her that and she'll cut you -- and she knew what it was like to transfer to a new school, especially since she had to go and live with her grandmother in New York after her father -- the only parent she'd ever known -- had died. She had a lot of sympathy for transfer students, because she not only had to go to a new
Tony shook his head. "No," he murmured. "I am just so goddamned touched by it that I can't control myself. I love you, Steve."
It was no secret that Tony hated his old man. He hated the way Howard acted, hated the way that he didn't give Maria the respect she deserved. His mom was
about it. Maria had asked for no arguments, and Tony had been trying really hard, but he couldn't just let
He followed Steve to the table, where Sarah, Joe, and Bucky were already sitting. Silently, Tony took a seat beside Bucky.
On the first Saturday of December, Steve and Bucky had decided to do some Christmas shopping. It'd been a while since he'd spent time with Bucky, just the two of them, so it was a nice trip for them.
"Talk to me, baby," Steve said softly, totally unaware of the pet name he'd just given him. "What happened?"
Even though George Barnes wasn't the greatest guy when he'd been drinking, Winifred stayed with him. He wasn't abusive to anyone but his son, and he was only like that when he was drunk, so Winifred justified that as an okay thing. Sometimes it really pissed Steve off, but then again, Winifred had often gone out of her way to make sure Bucky was protected. She watched out for him, in her own little way, so Steve couldn't hate her
were safe. Tiberius wasn't going to hurt them. This man, whoever he was, wasn't going to hurt them, either.
He nodded. He let go of Peter's hand to go up to the desk and pulled out his wallet. "I'm Tony Edwards. I booked a room for at least a month."
"You know how much I hate being watched," Sam stated without even looking up. Being in the Air Force had given him a sixth sense bordering on paranoia about people's focus on him. "What do you want?"
. He treated his wife and son like the treasures they were. He never raised his voice to either of them, he never spoke harshly to them, and, most importantly, he never raised a hand to them.
