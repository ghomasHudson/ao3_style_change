“It’s mom.” Tommy points to the pink peg.
HIGHWAY TO HELL
“Steve’s not exactly
“We all went to NYU. People called him the One-Armed Buck, which he enjoyed all things considered.”
Another hour rolls by, and so do the clouds. Tony is napping on the picnic blanket, while Steve and Peter
Tony sighs in his sleep. Steve seizes painting for a second, then continues when Tony's breaths even out again.
videos?
I told you to take it off!
“Is it?”
“More like skipped,” Tony grunts. “On purpose. Because I wanted to.”
No, Tony.
“Made you laugh, though.”
Come on, baby.
What? I’m genuinely asking.
"Goodnight." When Steve has gone, Tony allows himself to say it. "Goodnight, Steve."
He eats leftover pancakes and gulps down three mugs of coffee—although the latter was completely against Steve’s wishes. Tony wins his boyfriend’s favor by shoving pancakes into his mouth.
“I am already at the airport,” Noh-varr says.
"Seriously, though,” Steve says, snapping him out of his thoughts. “How do you know about Thor's breath?"
“The Wrecking Crew. It was quick and easy. There was a plane waiting for you in case you and Happy needed to leave the city, but that didn't happen. I'm glad it didn't because I wanted to see you immediately after the debrief. Fury kept it short, thank God. And before we knew it, we were on our way home."
"Well?"
He opens one eye.
"Sure, Tony." Steve blows hot air on Tony's face. "Whatever you say."
You didn’t.
“Okay, take it easy. C’mon.”
“What are you doing to our dad?” Tommy asks again, still doing some ridiculous fighting stance. “Did you make him sleep on the floor?”
Okay, I think I understand where this is going.

She accidentally, quote unquote, put too much on Scott’s face.
“I ignored my family for a year to deal with the Accords. I didn’t listen to you or what you wanted out of the deal. I ignored Peter, the rest of the Avengers, thinking I was doing the right thing. For all of us. Look what that did. Look where we are now.” Tony’s voice doesn’t shift too high or too low. It’s holding steady, and that tells him he’s tired. He’s exhausted. “I’m not blameless in this.”
"No. No, it doesn't."
—ot fucking touch it.
Steve fiddles with his fingers as he answers. “It was fun. Hotter than New York. Oh, guess what, though. One of Kate’s friends that she introduced us to was the
“Oh, so he’s an engineer.”
“Like I got some sleep. How long has it...where are we?”
"Now, c'mon. Let's enjoy this frat party."
Tony is lying on his side. He’s been on his side for what seems like forever now.
Nothing says Holiday cheer more than trying to beat the worsening traffic the nearer they get into said Holidays. Now, Christmas itself isn’t that much of a big deal as much as it is a catalyst for their family to get together over some sort of notion of celebration. For one, the Maximoffs are Jewish, and while they don’t practice the religion much—or at all—Christmas week has been the only holiday when Erik, Charles and Pietro get to travel to America the same time Tony gets to take a significant break from teaching to welcome his sons’ grandfathers and uncle with a clean unit and good food to spare.
Relax, Scott.
"Thank you," Tony whispers back. "I'll make it up to you, I promise."
Tommy also tells Billy he loves him, but not without calling him a ‘loser.’
Tony sighs.
‘text me when youre done. dont forget to smile even around stinky old men. :) i love you. <3’
“Then how does he know so much about the Second World War?”

Steve sighs then nods. “We are.”
“What happened to Dad?” Great, responsible brother to the rescue. “Why is he naked?”
Steve sighs. “I know.”
“Daaad,” Peter groans. “Please.”
“I dunno,” Tommy answers too quickly. “He’s probably not
Bucky frowns. “Yeah, I think I do.”
“Wow,” Tony snarks, though the humor isn’t gone from his voice, “low blow.”
Tony closes his eyes and smiles. He relishes in the feeling of Steve massaging his face, relishes in the soft touch of Steve's calloused skin on his. "Letting you handle trips usually entails we take your death trap of a motorcycle."
Okay, um.
"Leave." It doesn't have as much bite as Tony intended. It comes out almost like a plea. A desperate plea, like how everything else in Tony's life has become a tad too desperate, so he doesn't try to mask it anymore. "Please?"
That way you won’t have to keep on stopping and recording.
Tony smiles. Then, he hears a honk outside. “I have to go. My ride’s here,” he says to Clint. “Tell him that I love him.”
Are you sweating?
I just don’t think it’s to get back with me.
“And there’s barely a flaw on your face, Mr. I’m Perfect.”
? Since when did you start living here, Prof?"
The first photo is of an entire class of students, and he easily spots his mother in the crowd.
What?
Tony smiles despite himself. “I won’t. And no doubt your Aunt Pepper will do that anyway even if I don’t ask her.”
Don’t call me babe in front of Steve.
“At least tell me you got some sleep last night. I know sleep is a bit of a touchy subject—”
No one’s recording a video, okay?
Tony shifts in bed to shake off the buzzing in his chest.
Billy guffaws. “You’re doing zumba with moms?”
“—twenty-seven! He’s twenty-seven.”
“My Facebook?” Steve asks, a hint of amusement in his voice.
“Uh-huh,” Tony says, dragging out the syllables. “What about the classes you’re teaching?”
“I’m not Tommy’s university friend,” he admits. “I’m sorry for lying.”
as utensils fall to the floor.
It seems Steve has found his new catchphrase.
“No,” Steve says, but it comes out as an exhale, his mouth too wide open to properly form the word.
"Okay, I'm derailing again. Let's see here. Panic in the morning. Cake. Chewing. Playground. Right, so since your dad was out of commission, I had to step in. But the thing about me and playgrounds, Pete, is that—well—they're not built for me. And I got stuck. Do you remember? Your dad had told you that I was having such a great time I didn't wanna leave. I doubted that you bought that excuse. And fairly surprised you hadn't ever brought it up.”
“Does it have something to do with the envelope Calloway gave you?”
Point is, the pregnancy had been unplanned. Now, they've done more planning in the last six months than their whole lives combined. That's a lot of plans considering their whole saving the world schtick every now and then.
“And then Victor, he...when the boys were ten, I could feel him becoming more and more distant. We got into fights because of that. Shouting matches, slamming doors, the works, you know? I just
“I’m feeling a bit like a broken dam, Pete. I don’t always get to let this out. So would it be alright if I do now? I’m almost done, I promise. Just wake up if you want me to stop.”
But logic catches up to Tony fast, even if he doesn’t want it to.
Steve squeezes Tony's middle even tighter with the arm trapped under Tony and begins poking and prodding his ribs with his left hand. Tony squirms from under Steve's grip, laughing and wheezing with Steve's every stroke. He wants to fold his legs up his chest, but Steve holds them in their original position. Tony automatically begins curling over himself in laughter and his joints feel a release. His neck still hurts like a bitch, but it has reached its threshold. Tony isn’t even bothered anymore. All the while, Steve's dick is still firmly in place. If Tony wasn't held up and tickled against his will, he'd be congratulating Steve for an impressive job done by now.
“If Victor
This is ridiculous.
“He’s doing neither.”
“I don’t know what that means, sweetheart.” Tony’s voice is gentle, calm, but anger flares up in the way he looks at Steve. Or is that resolution? It demands an answer, whichever way Steve tries to look at it. “Will you tell me what that means?”
Tony asks Billy and Teddy to head out and grab a box of bagels at their usual place. Noh-Varr offers to go instead, and Tony agrees. Teddy also offers to come with so Noh-Varr doesn’t get lost, and there really isn’t any reason for Tony to say no, so he sends them off with a few dollars in hand and gifts for the employees at the bagel place.
Yeah, Scott.
On the breakfast nook to the right of him, Teddy gets up and introduces himself to Steve.
“Hey.” Steve waves a fork in front of Tony. “It’s okay.”
In fact, they’ve gotten very few stares from civilians and passers-by. Those who do recognize them are young, those who ask for pictures are even younger. It’s Tony who humors most of them, taking the bulk of the spotlight not from want, but from Steve and Peter’s need to remain on the down-low. Whenever Steve gets the subtle nod from Tony, who has gathered the masses off to one side, he grabs Peter, if he isn’t already holding the boy, and walks further down the road, away from prying eyes.
“Gee, thanks,” Tony deadpans.
Ĕ̴̜̱̏͋̏͒͝
“That has literally not stopped you the last three nights.” Tony rolls his eyes as the rest of his face betrays the nonchalance. He claps his hands to his thighs as he looks around for something, anything that isn’t Steve.
Mine.
Steve had managed to convince Tony to come over to his old apartment more often than not. Tony couldn’t have pinpointed what it was exactly that had led him to agree to such a routine though.
"Yeah, I'm getting kinda hungry."
"Okay."
“I try.”
“That’s really good to know, Tony.”
is turning twenty-seven next year.”
Bucky walks back to Tony and sits across from him. "You're not wearing any pants."
Tommy reciprocates Tony’s hold. He can feel Tony’s quickening heartbeat, then his own, through the hand trapped between their chests. He closes his fingers and clutches onto the fabric of Tony’s shirt, afraid that he’ll fall, that Tony would let go, and there will be nobody around to catch him before he hits the ground.
“I love you.” Tony lets out a cough. “I will...I will always love you...no matter what.”
Noh-Varr sits straight. He hides his hands underneath the table. “Familiarity...with my ex-fiancee, Oubliette. I found it very difficult to leave her. She was the life I knew before I left Hala. Family disputes, you see? And she followed me to America without many protests.”
“You’re early.” Tony presses his back to the door. He forces as much space between Steve and himself as possible. Steve takes a step back, heeding Tony’s implied word.
“Why? What’s wrong?”
“Are we going back to New York?”
"Dad," Peter says, hoarse, his throat constricting from the tears he won't allow to spill. "Come here."
Tommy takes his place beside Tony again, snaking an arm around Tony’s elbow. “A lot of them are single moms. And you’re a single dad. You’re the engineer, you do the math.”
"Just...I don't know. I woke up feeling embarrassed. Just like that."
R̷̯̹̙̣̦̯̙̾̿͋̈́̈́͐̈́͘
They opt for coffee, instead of tea, as per Tony’s request, and breakfast commences. The three of them moan in unison as they relish their food together; Peter asks for more, and Steve doesn't think he has ever seen his son eat that much. This recipe deserves a repeat. Perhaps the rest of the Avengers would enjoy a taste as well.
Tony stops himself just in time from curling into a ball and telling his sons to leave him where he lies. They don’t notice that he’s frozen in place though, because Tommy growls and halts himself, effectively stopping the chain of Starks walking around Central Park. Tony could feel Tommy’s arm under his coat contract and relax with every vibration, but he doesn’t make a move to take his phone out of his pocket and answer the call.
“Who do you think I am? Of course I can tell you boys apart.” Tony loops his arms around his sons’; Billy on the left and Tommy on the right. “White does suit you, Tommy. But you’re not afraid that it’s going to ruin your hair?”
“What?”
“I was willing to give this ‘cult’ a chance. I thought that was your funny way of saying you live with a bunch of stoners or the local MLM group or I don’t know. People who think they’re stuck in the 60’s raving about John Lennon or whatever. I mean, Wade thought you rented out your place to Mormon missionaries.”
“Well, I like it.”
“Sheesh. You rich people and your demands. No tie.”
In front of Tony is an array of mismatched flowers from their own backyard. Snapdragons, goldenrods, purple fountain grass. Some smaller ones end up falling under Steve’s grip. Tony finds them beautiful all the same.
“They… they didn’t, Pete… I—” Except they did. Because Steve isn’t strong enough. And they put him in a chamber, a poor excuse of an imitation of Tony’s technology—and they put him inside and they wouldn’t let him out—
get to talk to you that way.”
"Thank you, Shuri," Steve echoes.
It’s a bitter cycle, one he claws at the earth to not fall into. He digs his nails into the soil until his fingers bleed. But at least he’s up on the surface. At least he’s not suffocating underneath.
After they say their goodbyes, Mr. Calloway sends them off with a wave of his handkerchief. Steve and his family take a short walk back to their car, where they take a picnic basket and more blankets than necessary with them and head to a nearby park for lunch. They settle on a spot by a tree, a little ways off from its shade. The sun is barely out and Tony needs to warm up. Peter is doing a little better than his dad, but he’s sitting on Tony’s lap and under the two blankets Tony has draped around his shoulders, munching his sandwich and drinking his juice.
“Noh-Varr?”
Steve gently pulls his hand away from Tony. "Goodnight, Tony."
Tommy runs to his dad first, his chest hitting Tony’s side with a lot more force than Tony is expecting. They almost topple over, which would have been all the more unfortunate because of the knife Tony is holding, but thank God for small Christmas miracles. He berates Tommy, but returns the hug with just as much force.
I was terrified.
Won’t be a problem, Sergeant Barnes.
I ruined the night.
"Pops is here," Peter says, whispers.
“Who regularly go to the gym.”
The tears reach Tony's lips and he licks them away.
“Dad telling us about partners. Having another step parent was still on the table, you know? And we were teenagers. Very impressionable teenagers. If Dad introduced us to the wrong person, got us close to the wrong influence, he was afraid that was going to fuck us up even more than—more than we already are.”
Hot breath tickles the nape of Tony’s neck. “I can’t figure out if he’s trying to scare you away or…or if he’s trying to turn you against me to scare
Peter jumps down from his seat and crosses the length of the kitchen and the stairs in four long strides. He’s still carrying the fork in one hand, while his empty hand itches for something else to grab; anything to throw, really. He climbs up the stairs in record time, and he can hear his dad following close behind, calling out to him. Peter doesn’t stop. He only goes up, up, up.
“Who’s that?” Tommy asks.
"That's because my ass has sucked all your nutrients through your dick."
“Carpet,” Tony says.
Our full names?
“Yep,” Steve says. “I have the day committed to memory. Our first date,” Steve teases. “The beginning of the rest of my life.”
“That’s it—”
Tony, you didn’t—
“For Tommy.”
“Natasha was a little mean, wasn’t she?” Steve tells him.
Those
“He took you to the MET.”
“I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop. For him to leave me, but it’s been a year, and he hasn’t left me yet. At least, I don’t think so. I keep calling him but he wouldn’t answer my calls. Maybe everything that I’ve said has been all for nothing. Maybe I did already fuck it up.”
Anybody wanna say something before we start?
met Steve? I can’t believe you, Dad!”
Of course, it wouldn't be a day in Steve's apartment without a half-naked Bucky, which he so clearly is, and the sunlight has a few more hours to spare before it disappears into the New York horizon.
Now, Peter is talking to one of the children on the same platform. They shake hands and the other boy goes down the slide first, followed closely by Peter. Peter almost knocks the other kid over when he reaches the end of the slide, but the other kid sidesteps easily, in part due to Peter extending his limbs to slow himself down the slide. They go again a couple more times, and Steve smiles, observing Peter in action and in making a friend.
"Dad,” Peter whines, “don’t—”
Natasha laughs. "Wise kid."
Don’t.
When Tony opens his eyes next, it's already morning, and Peter is still fast asleep.
"See," Steve continues as he plants his feet on the floor, "there was this giant snake. And I thought to myself, if I die here because of a giant snake, you'll never forgive me. Our kid will never forgive me. Captain America has battled all kinds of deadly aliens, but dies at the hands of—ah, no. At the scales of a snake? No siree. Not
“A shame Wade can’t be here. But I guess somebody has to stay and handle all the wedding planning, huh?”
Another clash between the thin metals. “Sorry!” Tommy exclaims. “Just loading these bad boys up.”
And that. That stops everything.
Whatever the break meant, the least it gave me is reassurance that I still have a hold on you.
Yeah, so…
Tony chuckles, biting down on Steve's finger when the fit of giggles doesn't stop. Steve doesn't even react to the bite, merely laughs along with Tony. "That's a fun thought. Coney Island with the frat bros. Maybe I can invite Bruce and Thor, then it'll be a real party."
Steve places his sandwich down and wipes his hands on the thighs of his pants. He raises an eyebrow at Tony as he slowly opens it. He pulls out its contents and studies them one by one.
much.”
Steve shifts. "I'm still hard." To Steve’s credit, he does have the decency to sound surprised.
Billy smiles, digging his elbow into Teddy’s rib to tickle him. “No, guess not.” He clears his throat. “I’m allowed to be protective too, right?”
“Immature.”
“Sorry about that, Steve.” Billy stands and hands Tommy the forks he had picked up. “What were you saying?”
“I have no idea if you’re trying to make me feel better or worse,” Billy deadpans.
“Tommy asked me to throw a party because he thought I was lonely.” Tony lifts his head to look at Steve. “While I watched you prepare for a party. It was ridiculous. I felt ridiculous
man?” Tommy asks, carefully iterating his words with an almost cartoonish cadence to them.
"It's not meant to be sexy. He has a stinky breath."
“Okay,” Steve replies. “A little better, I think.”
A jolt of pain ran through his right arm like it was being stabbed, electrocuted, torn to shreds. He doesn’t understand. All he knows is that it hurts. God, does it hurt. He tries to scream, but all he can manage is a choked cry.
Well—
Tony nudges him with a shoulder. “You sap.”
“And I was willing too! Willing to leave Victor and just hand them a fat pile of cash every year. But...And then…” Tony swallows. He takes a long swig of his coffee to wash away the ashy taste that has settled on his tongue. “And then I met them. I met Billy and Tommy and I knew I couldn’t. I wouldn’t be able to.”
“But I gave you your present first.”
It had taken Tony a while to get used to sharing a bed again.
R̶̢͉͈̩͚̲͎͔̬̗̬̳̼͒
But nope. Not tonight. Tonight, it’s whiny Steve. And whiny Steve is clingy. Whiny Steve can activate his puppy dog eyes without missing a beat. Which he does. And Tony’s fucked.
Then silence.
So that’s it?
And then I put your life in danger.
“Watch your words, young man!” Tony says, putting both hands on his hips. “What is
“Tony.”
“Your brother dying his hair helps with telling you two apart.”
“Me neither, if I’m being honest,” Tony says with a shrug. “Steve doesn’t really say much about their current practices. You know this household, your other dad and I raised you atheist, and I don’t think I’ll ever be anything else. And then there’s Steve, the High Priest of the Temple of the Red Skull. It’s a lot of religious differences to overcome, but somehow we just…” Tony stares off into the faraway distance of the kitchen counters behind Peter, hand on heart and eyes glimmering. “We just work, you know?”
"Nah. I don't really feel like it. Plus, I don't want the sheets to get dirty. I just changed them."
Just… the whole instructions?

Tommy rolls his eyes. “Yeah, yeah. I’ll tone it down.”
. I wanted to give you a hug and tell you your birthday is whenever you want it to be. We gave you the biggest slice of cake, and you ate it so fast your dad thought you were gonna choke. I did too, to be honest. I would drop your fork several times just so you’d have to stop eating and swallow the cake you still had in your mouth.”
“I never met him,” Steve spins the teetotum for his turn. He finally lands on the marriage tile, and he chooses another blue peg for his blue car. “But yeah, I can’t lie. If I ever did meet him I think I’ll punch him square in the teeth.”
“They banned
“Still. I should’ve done my research. Did more.”
"That’s not very smart of you, then."
“Sure, Tommy. I love you. Stay safe.”
Billy squints at the queue by the counter, and sure enough, Steve’s hulking figure and blond hair stands out among the rest. “What’s he doing here? Shit, the gifts.” Billy places the paper bags between himself and Teddy. They’re inconspicuous enough as they are, so hiding them in plain sight should be fine.
"You're right, JARVIS, it does." Steve pats the box, now placed under Peter's hand.
Tony shifts his weight, making it easier for Steve to lift Tony onto his lap. With Steve still seated on the edge of the bed, Tony wraps his arms around Steve’s shoulder and kisses him deeper. Steve slowly inches his hand down to Tony’s ass, tugging at the garters of his sweatpants and massaging the exposed skin.
Steve…
“This is the most ridiculous conversation we have ever had. I would laugh if I wasn’t so tired.”
“Must’ve been wild,” Steve comments. Nothing in his face indicates that he’s expecting a present of his own. “New York is a riot during Christmas Eve.”
"Yes."
“Of course, Colonel Rhodes.”
"Now, that," Tony says, bringing the back of Steve's hand to his lips. "That sounds like home to me."
Well, I didn’t exactly do any
I believe the term nowadays is simply ‘go viral.’
“It’s not just that.” Tony looks down at Steve, and Steve looks up at Tony. “They’re my
“I know our beginnings were less than ideal, but we can’t keep holding on to the past.”
And Peter would say happily ever after, but he knows, just like Pops' story, it's only just the beginning.
Steve feels almost apologetic. He hadn’t given the town much thought since waking up from the ice, too preoccupied with the fact that he had awoken seventy years into the future and then later, preoccupied with his newfound romance and his newfound superhero team and his newfound family. He hadn’t even considered that the small town his parents grew up in would still accept him as one of their own, but meeting Mr. Calloway has proven otherwise.
"I love you."
Elaborate.
"Pops. Is it okay if I borrow your favorite sweater?"
“Okay," Tommy says, though Tony can't figure out if his boy is disappointed or afraid or both. "Yeah, fine. Just… if you do that, be careful. Make Aunt Pepper run a background check or something. And don’t go on dating apps.”
"Oh ho ho.
Steve, just don’t go near him—
The conversation ends.
“Thank you for trying again.”
Tommy growls, his knuckles turn white from his grip on his phone. He feels silly, desperate and on the verge of tears. The growl turns into a groan, then to a scream muffled by the pillow he holds over his face. He hugs it tight when his throat feels sore, putting his all into squeezing the thing.
Instead, he hops off his bed and whacks the mattress with the pillow he’s been squeezing. The
“Huh.” Peter instinctively grabs his fork. He plays with it, drumming it on the breakfast nook’s granite countertop. Tony has gone back to watching something on his phone, completely unfazed by the fact that the words
“It wasn’t just about me and Billy or mom, though. You loved Victor anyway. You loved him still.”
Tommy stretches out his legs in front of him and Tony does the same. Tommy scoots closer to Tony and rests his head on Tony’s shoulders. “I always miss Mom. I miss Vision, too. But that’s not why I acted up.”
Here.
didn’t exist. He’d ignore us for weeks. Then—then come back home with presents in tow. Said he loved me, that he loved us. He’d dangle his love over his own sons’ heads and I—”
Tony, whose face he sees running towards him, a blanket wrapped around himself and a pair of soft boots on his feet. Tony, who crosses the grass that Steve had just crossed, kneels as Steve had just done, who pulls Steve into his warm hands and leads him back to their cabin.
Tony would cuddle closer to Steve if that were even physically possible. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to make you feel unwelcome.”
Where did you get this stuff, Buck?
“My dad...he’s seeing someone new.”
“I hate having to lie to them,” Tony says into the mattress.
“Tony.” Steve squishes Tony’s cheeks together with his thumb and forefinger. “I love it,” he says.
“That’s not good enough.”
Tony remains quiet, his gaze diverting to the clock on Peter's bedside.
“What?”
“Isn’t that a good thing?”
Steve rolls his eyes fondly. “Go. I’ll clean up.”
With all the time spent at Steve’s though, it had only been natural for Tony to come to the conclusion that Steve might want Tony to move in with him instead, which had already been a big question mark in Tony’s mind.
Tony crosses the distance between the door and his bed, squeezing through the small space between Steve and the table beside him, the table that still carries Pietro’s vase. He places himself on the bed, back to the wall, head over the window sill, his knees drawn up to his chest. He doesn’t look at Steve, but he schools his expression to something more neutral, opting for uncaring, but he doubts he has achieved that.
So he opens his mouth as Steve closes the distance between them, letting Steve in, letting Steve’s tongue explore him. Steve angles his body just right that he places both hands on Tony’s waist. He tugs at Tony, asking him to come closer.
What’s shrinking gonna do?
Tony nods. "Pops has been coming to see you every night. Isn't that sweet, baby?"
It’s Steve’s voice that usually lulls Tony to sleep. That night—well, morning, but Tony isn’t complaining—isn’t any different. Tony blinks once, twice, and then closes his eyes altogether.
I think this whole taking a break thing is going there anyway.
Tony knows it’s a joke. Of course, it’s a joke. He’s
“Pop-pop, what’s Hydra?” Peter asks into his ear, small and afraid.
“After this, I'm going straight home. I promise.” Tony crosses his heart to prove his point but drops his hand when he realizes Tommy can't see the gesture anyway. “You boys don’t have to worry about your dad so much, you know? I’m taking care of myself alright.”
“You and Pietro are similar like that.”
I thought you wanted some space—
We’re gonna have to start—
He’ll grow small and the mask will slip right off?
When the Avengers had first moved in, the tabloids went a little wild with their theories and their headlines, most of which involved Tony one way or another. They had reported on Tony’s sexuality ahead of Tony coming out. They had reported of Tony and Pepper’s breakup way ahead of the breakup. And they had reported on Tony’s new relationships when there had been none. One such instance included an article in a gossip magazine that, according to a ‘reliable source,’ Tony has slept with all of the original members of the Avengers. The article hadn’t only brought up Tony’s less than ideal past, it had also taken a jab at the other Avengers as well: Thor is a sex-crazed god, the agents—Nat and Clint, though the tabloids wouldn’t have known, it had been a different time after all—are well-trained seducers, and Bruce, with the Hulk’s libido, is bound to have gotten his share of the action.
“I—” He knows. Of that, he’s certain. “Maybe we should wait. I just think we should wait.”
in the kitchen. Sorry, bud.” He heads back to the StarkTab on the dining table, catching up on the news back home.
They slowly find which seating works best for all of them. Tony gives up his usual seat at the head of the table, and offers it to Tommy. Instead, he’s seated on Tommy’s left-hand side with Steve beside himself. Across Steve sits Teddy—and while that doesn’t help Tony avoid comparing the two, at least they both aren’t in his immediate eyeline—and beside Teddy is Billy.
Go ahead?
"Oh baby, we searched for you everywhere—oh, um. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to—" Tony tells Steve.
"Sir," JARVIS announces. "Captain Rogers is on his way."
Bucky sent a message to the Avengers group chat.
But he also knows that there’s a lot more to this than simply telling his sons about a new beau. And for once, he wishes he was wrong.
Somebody take it off.
“Asshole,” Tony says before walking away.
“It’s not about the age thing,” Teddy repeats after giving Billy’s shoulder a kiss.
Tony nods and scoots closer to Steve.
Tony had chuckled at the dig at Steve’s friends, but a feeling of melancholia had settled in his chest. “So you don’t want me to move in?”
Billy lets go to take a swig of his coffee and the rest of the table does the same. The murmurs of the enclosed space drowns out whatever sense of friendship they just had.
“He only has a Facebook.”
Tony had only shrugged and had said it had been as much for Teddy and Lisa as it had been for his boys.
Because the moment he pokes his head out of the hallway, Tommy screams “dad!” and that’s a normal breakfast out the window.
Don’t worry.
“Yeah,” Tony says, his chest feeling even heavier now. The truth setting you free doesn’t apply to everything after all. “Wow.”
More shuffling, fabric hitting fabric. “Would it be okay to tell you a story, Pete? I hope it is. It’s the only thing I have planned for tonight. Just wake up if you want me to stop, okay?” Steve pauses, and the silence is unnerving but not unwelcome. No one stirs, especially not Peter, so Steve hums and Tony releases the breath he has been holding.
He throws the battered pillow on the ground and leaps to his phone on the bed. Lying on his stomach on the mattress, Tommy feels his hands shaking as he unlocks his phone. He hears the beating of his heart in his ears as the message app opens.
He looks around the room one last time before finally heading out. Passing by Peter’s room down the hallway, he decides to take one last peek inside. The plastic stars and planets are still up on the ceiling. Saying goodbye to them shouldn’t have to be this hard; it’s not like Tony is saying goodbye to them forever. His eyes well up with tears anyway, and his fingertips linger on the cold doorknob after Tony pulls the door to a close.
“Let’s get you something to drink.”
“Of course you do,” Tony mutters under his breath.
"You're so beautiful," Steve whispers into his ear.
Tony doesn’t immediately fall asleep.
Too much hurt in one lifetime. He repeats the thought and lies still.
Steve nods, a knowing smile creeping up on his lips. “He introduced me to Pepper. Got me connected to some of their conservators. Said he’s helped engineer some of the equipment that they use, but all that came after.” He clears his throat and tugs on the collar of his shirt. “He showed me around the museum first. I like to think of it as our first date, but Tony begs to differ.”

We’re doing the masks, Buck.
“He doesn’t.” Tommy points a fork at his brother, then at himself. “I do.”
"Tony, please."
“Do you want something to drink? Coffee, juice, tea?” Tony asks Noh-varr, leading both him and Tommy to the dining area. “Maybe a sandwich?”
“That’s why that guy from your Facebook looks familiar. It’s Kate’s archer friend,” Billy says.
“Tony,” Steve pleads. And God if Tony doesn’t melt at the sound of that voice.
Pick up anything important about today’s activity, okay, FRIDAY?
“It’s taking a while, isn’t it?”
No, you asked everybody to take yours off because it was burning your face and we got too preoccupied with that I didn’t even notice my face starting to burn—
"I love you too, Darling."
“Help Dad set the table, Pete,” Steve says when the batter is ready to be fried.
There’s a group chat?
“Clint?” Billy pipes up from behind his laptop. “Clint...Barron.”
Peter shakes his fork in the air in lieu of adding to the conversation. His eyes dart around the room, a large open space where the kitchen and dining and living areas blend together unobstructed by solid walls. Nothing much has changed in his childhood home, it seems. Still the same finishes, the same furniture, the same pots and pans hanging over the counters. Peter would’ve thought that his dad is knee deep in renovation projects by now, but he’s both relieved and a little unnerved to be proven otherwise. Behind Tony, the first flight of stairs stands there, menacingly empty.
Tony and Steve chuckle as they watch their son power walk while holding his behind with both hands. Tony places a hand on Steve’s, places his fingers on Steve’s palm, and drums them on his skin.
“I tried to stop them, but they insisted.”
Tony nods and smiles.
A few texts from Natasha ask him how everything is going and he responds in non-specifics. A couple from Wanda and Thor and Bruce cooing at Peter’s size and wishing them back again soon. Steve receives a few selfies from them as well, and a few more photos of the tower in different levels of disarray. They had thrown a party the night before, says Nat. Steve tells them to clean up before they get back.
“Okay. I’m not gonna keep you any longer then. You should do your interview so you can get the hell outta there.”
He’s not going to break up with you.
Steve pulls Tony to a more comfortable position: still straddled on top of Steve, but with Steve now reclined on one of the pillows strewn about the bed, and Tony propping most of his torso over Steve with his elbows to get a better angle of his lips.
into his lifestyle as openly as possible if it meant it would bring him closer to his dad. Music, tech, fashion. Hell, Tommy had even resorted to gloating about how his and Tony’s names were practically identical. Just a few letters off and Tommy would be just like his father.
“Yes, for the most part.”
“You’re Christian?” Billy asks, no doubt trying to play the slightly better cop to Tommy’s ridiculously obnoxious bad cop, while slicing his pancakes into small square pieces.
“So that wasn’t you coming through the front door just now?”
Steve draws out a few more words along with a yawn. “We better get some shuteye.”
Do whatever you want.
Curse supersoldiers and their super hearing.
With their gifts in tow, they first head to the tree and arrange them with the rest of the gifts. Then they enter the kitchen, where Tony is now loading golden hash browns onto a plate. Steve is frying bacon on his right while Noh-Varr is slicing cheese and ham on his left. Billy and Teddy wait for Tony to finish his task, then Billy gives him a long, tight hug and whispers a small ‘I love you’ into Tony’s ear.
“I wouldn’t want it any other way.”
“I’m so afraid of fucking it up if I do.”
The rest of the day is simple enough. They spend the morning in their respective nooks and crannies. Steve goes back to bed to catch up on some sleep. Teddy is still working by the breakfast nook. Billy and Tommy are playing video games in the living area, while Tony is grading his students’ papers on the dining table and doing mild cleaning around the house.
“Are you really not gonna open them with all of us?” Tommy asks.
Tony takes one step forward, then another, and another. He sits on the edge of Peter’s bed, the one opposite Steve, and Steve sits on the other side.
"Thanks, J. Hey, Pete," he calls out. He walks to the bathroom door and knocks. "You okay in there? Come out soon. I have one last surprise for you."
It feels different coming from their mouths. Like an acceptance of sorts. Not just of Steve, but of the life Tony so carefully hid from them; the shame and guilt he has associated with it slowly chipping away. He fights a smile, lifting his mug just beyond his lips when he knows he lost the fight, and a grin slowly spreads across his face.
The both of them turn to Steve and offer him a Happy Holidays as well, at first with a timid clap on the shoulder from Teddy, but Billy spreads his arms for a hug. Steve hugs back with one arm, the other still very cautious of the bacon he’s frying.
“Of course.”
But his right arm has been hurting again, and Steve is convinced that he can do a better job than Tony’s left hand with Tony's dental hygiene.
“Shh,” Steve says. “It’s okay. I’m here.” He shows Tony how to breathe like it’s the easiest thing to do. Steve talks to him like he is a child.
“Hm, I’m starting a career. If Mom doesn’t like this decision, she can haunt me in my sleep tonight.” Tommy picks up a career card. “Hah! Athlete and...a hundred-
Just then, the front door to the small apartment opens. Steve and Sam make their way inside, paper bags filled to the brim with snacks and takeout in each arm.
"That Steve?" Bucky asks. “Tell him we’re out of milk.”
So breakfast isn’t as bad as Tony had been expecting. Verbal roughhousing is a pretty common occurrence in his home, and Tony’s a little more than relieved that they’re able to let Steve join in on the fun. The age thing does help the situation. There’s no pretense of authority from Steve, not that there would be any should his sons have been younger. To Steve, respect is something earned and that’s something Tony learned about Steve early on. And Steve doesn’t have to feel any sense of responsibility for his sons. Tony can’t think of a reality where he’d be able to convince his sons to think of someone only two years older than them as their stepdad. And that’s just as well, Tony thinks, because they’ve had enough experience with different step-somethings that could last them a lifetime.
Steve.
the answer I wanted.”
“Man!”
“Right,” Peter says amusedly. Then he shakes his head and gets back to business. “But don’t you know what they’re doing up there?”
"Wake up if he wants you to stop," Steve says lightheartedly at JARVIS.
Tony pouts. “Can you call him, please?”
Tony lifts the small octagonal box with one hand. He’s not sure how Peter had managed to save some of JARVIS’ data after the catastrophe that was Ultron, but his kid never fails to surprise him. “Found him while looking through the stuff Peter brought with him to Germany,” Tony says to Rhodey, as matter-of-factly as he can manage, then looks pointedly at the box, assessing it. “If I had known you’ve been in there all this time, J, I would’ve gone through his stuff sooner.”
Steve looks down, his jaw clenching. “I am. I’m sorry.”
Tony couldn’t help but think his twins would enjoy being around that crowd, but along with that had been the constant re-realization that he himself would be the odd one out in the scenario, so he had tucked the thought away and had enjoyed himself running around the apartment building with his bare feet, Nerf gun in hand, and firing shots at Clint’s big head.
Noh-Varr smiles, small and sad. “Exclusively, yes. Tommy told me he had told you about our past?”
Tony doesn’t doubt that.
What Tony does know, and hopes he isn’t wrong about, is that Steve isn’t like anyone he’s ever met before. He’s sure it isn’t just an age thing, because if it was, he would’ve hit the jackpot before he even hit thirty. The boys would have still had V—their other father with them, and Tony wouldn’t have had to deal with anyone that had come after. But that isn’t his reality right now, and he’s glad that it isn’t. Because now he has Steve, the Steve who has shown Tony that there’s more to a home than a large apartment unit, more to respect than showing the bare minimum of keeping boundaries, more to kindness, more to love.
“I want to apologize,” Steve says at last. “I’m sorry about last night.”
I just wanna help—
However, itt had been one thing to constantly be in the presence of pseudo-frat boys who used to be two of his rowdiest students in class, it’s another ordeal when said pseudo-frat boys had been—still are—
“He was brash, made a lot of jokes when I just wanted a straight answer. I thought he was wasting my time. I was a working student, you see. I didn’t have time to waste on an interview with someone who won’t even be able to help me out. He said I needed to come back some time later when I’m freer. I wanted to decline, but he gave me his number before I could get another word out. When I told my friends about him, they laughed. Said Tony was a good teacher despite his tendencies to talk around a subject. Bucky said, ‘if existential crises and dread were a sense of humor, Tony would be the funniest guy on the planet.’”
“Yeah, but Uncle Pietro liked to mess with him.”
Location: Avengers Facility Rec Room.
He shuts the notebook, sniffles and coughs before he’s enveloped by Steve’s hulking figure. He shudders under Steve’s embrace and lets himself rest there for a few minutes before finally pulling away.
“Dad!” Peter screams. “I’m done!”
“Dad, stop. Tell me three things you can feel. C’mon.”
“Case in point. I mean, you got Teddy new boxing gloves, which
“How much do you hate Lisa?” Tommy asks.
"If I may interject, Captain Rogers." JARVIS is hesitant, almost questioning his own motivation to speak. "I am well-aware of my protocols, and the Young Master's privacy is of my utmost concern. But perhaps it's time to put in place new protocols. One that might create a reaction out of the Young Master."
“No, Dad. I’m doing fine,” Tommy answers, rolling his eyes. “But that’s not the point. Where was I?”
Tony flails his hand over his head as he groans, long and loud. “That’s not the point. Oh my god, you are just like him.” Tony falls back on the bed and crawls underneath the duvet.
“I met up with him the next week. Told myself I should see if he has anything to offer sooner than later. My masters depended on it, after all.”
Here!
Tony raises an eyebrow. "You really didn't. Should you even still be here?" He looks around the empty corridor. "Someone might catch you."
“What does it say?”
Steve squints. Tony squints back. They’re locked in a squinting match for a few seconds before Steve softens his expression and gives Tony a quick kiss on the nose. “How about this? We go on an actual trip so you can have pictures to send.”
“The Young Master brought me with him during his field trip. He has also used me to hack into Oscorp’s data frame and gather as much information as I can on their cross-species experiments.”
“Sorry, sorry. I’ll wash them off again.”
Tony and Erik had spent the entire afternoon trying to be civil. They had broken their bread—so to speak—and drank their coffee, which Erik had pointed out that he had only made because Tony didn’t seem to drink anything else. That had been true enough, at least at the time. Tony had focused on talking about work while Erik had listened intently, asking questions and offering no insight. They had kept the conversation casual, up until the very end, when Erik had walked Tony to their door and had shown him out of his home.
Sure thing.
"I have a stinky breath and we're being very sexy right now."
Bucky’s been planning this for a week, Tony.
When Tony had first bought this particular condominium unit, he and the boys had just moved out of his Dad’s old mansion. Moving back to America had been their first step to starting a new life, and the mansion hadn’t been doing them any favors, what with being too big for just three people, two of which had been children. Endless hallways had led to more hallways, and finding each other had been a lot more work for the kids than Tony thought necessary. He had hated those hallways as a kid himself, always feeling lost, as if he had had to navigate through a labyrinth before he could find any sense of comfort from his own parents, if any at all. He had feared that his sons would feel the same, so they had made haste to move again after only two weeks of staying there.
Steve grunts sleepily. "Sum'nrng…?"
"No, Tony. This is the last thing you should be apologizing for. Please…go on."
“Hey.” Tony places a hand on Steve’s back. He rubs circles on it with his thumb. “Wanna head back?”
Hold still.
Tony sniffles.
“Sure. Come on, get up.” Steve pulls him to his feet.
And then you couldn’t.
Tony huffs out a laugh. “Why don’t you boys come in first, hm?”
“Walking around town all day is bound to knock anyone out right after.”
"Touché. But unlike you, I pay a third of the rent."
But no one is more surprised than Tommy himself. He punches Steve lightly on the shoulder and gives the excuse that he’s still pretty sleepy, and tired, and
"We were both up at the same time way too early. I fixed him a bowl of cereal and got too close when I handed him his bowl."
At 6:30 in the morning, Steve emerges from their room.
do it.
Just say your names.
“Nothing. It’s just… about this cult you keep mentioning...”
“Fine.” Steve sits up. “Should I leave? I could hide in the closet until—”
Then Tony just...crashed.
"Pops, I told you, it's not your fault I got hit by the shield—"
Steve asks for the free stool beside their table. The lady just grunts and nods, not looking away from the conversation she’s having. Steve takes the stool and places it by Billy and Teddy’s table. “Hey, guys! Just wanted to go for a walk, but it’s colder than I anticipated.” He places his coffee on the table. “I hope I’m not intruding?”
Steve looks at Tony, concerned.
“Hm?”
Steve shoots up, a jerky set of motion that ripples through his body; a quick flop on the bed as he tries to get up. Steve’s forehead hits Tony’s just as Tony has been clamoring for something to hold on to, feeling himself lose balance, and the force of the hit catches him off guard, blinding him for a split second. He loses his balance anyway, but not before clutching hard on the blanket.
“Dad!”
"Oh yeah. We're definitely taking the death trap. I've already ordered a helmet just for you."
This is about Tony, isn't it?
A set of muted footsteps echo outside.
Start from the beginning?
It might be faster if you let us help, Tony.
He heads to Steve and kisses him on the cheek. Which surprises Steve. And Tony. And Billy.
“Uh huh.”
Making boxty ends up with Tony joining them, much to Steve's pleasure, to help Peter mix and stir while Steve pours the right amount of liquid into their batter. They make a lesson out of it, telling Peter that it’s okay to ask for help when needed and that mistakes happen, but that doesn’t mean they won’t be able to make potato pancakes out of it. Peter nods and hums along whenever Steve asks him for confirmation that he gets what they’re saying. As small and as fragile as he sees his son, the kid is smart and clever, so he doesn’t doubt that the boy is internalizing what they’re teaching him.
Steve stands from his seat and reaches over to Tony. He pushes Tony back down and motions for Tommy to do the same. “It’s okay. I’m not offended.”
"Hm. Maybe it's because I have my penis up your butt?"
"You know he doesn't actually use the 5-in-1 stuff, right?"
Tommy scoffs. “I know you have more to say about the guy. Dad has obviously told you things.”
They reach the car in a little over fifteen minutes. Tommy offers to drive, but Tony declines, knowing that he only doesn’t want to take the backseat.
“Oh! I’ll be right back.” Mr. Calloway disappears into a hallway for a few minutes and comes back having produced a thin envelope. He hands the envelope to Tony. “It’s my pleasure. Having Captain America here, well… it’s a dream come true.”

But Tony notices of course. Of course he does. He places a hand on Tommy’s, the one still resting on the top of his own head.
“Tony…” Steve groans. “It’s embarrassing.”
“You know? So your barrage of text messages at buttfuck in the morning wasn’t even warranted?” More scuffling. Tony can hear distant clucking and mooing.
“Are you sure? It’s a long way from here.”
Teddy places his lips on Billy’s forehead. “Rest,” he whispers.
“What? Tommy—”
“I was scared I’d scare
“Don’t be difficult, Peter.”
Tony sounds baffled, but his face is more of anger, of remorse. The thought of Lisa, the mere mention of her sends Tony’s blood boiling. “Why is she still—oh my God, Thomas, tell me you did
"That's not very sexy."
Steve tightens his grip around Peter’s body and continues to stomp towards… wherever it is they’re going.
“So—”
“What if he doesn’t feel the same way? What if—Peter?”
He approaches Tony with his arms wide open, as if showing what a good job he’s done finding a shirt that actually fits him without his nipples up for display. He stops just in front of Tony and closes his arms around him for a hug. He places a kiss on the top of Tony’s head.
“Yeah, Dad,” Tommy says. “That

“Still doing them. Although, two weeks ago I switched my evening tap dance classes for the afternoon Zumba Moms. To make room for training.”
“A blanket?” Steve says after unwrapping his gift from Tommy. He reads the note and his face quickly reddens. “Oh my God.”
Tony closes the lid of his laptop and excuses himself from the rest of the preparations. He heads to Steve’s bedroom—his and Steve’s now, for the most part—and plops himself down the bed with a definite thud. He sends a quick text to Tommy and Billy, telling the both of them that he loves and misses them.
Well—
“Grew up Catholic, but I don’t really do the religion thing anymore.” Steve slathers syrup on his pancakes. He spreads the syrup around with his fork, and it drips to the sides of the stack, all the way to his eggs and bacon. “But my Ma taught me to be thankful where it’s due, and I’m always thankful for the food on the table.”
“I’m sorry, what?” Cho would say, metaphorical scissors ready to cut the thread where Tony’s dignity hangs.
“You used to do tap dancing?” Tommy asks from behind his gross shake. He takes one final sip before setting it further away from its usual spot beside his plate.
“My boyfriend’s cock made itself comfortable inside my asshole for, what, six...maybe seven hours straight,” Tony would respond and he would hear the scissors close and that’s his dignity down the drain. “Will I be able to take a shit properly again, or am I gonna have to wear diapers inside my suits from now on?”
You’re literally
Peter holds in the pained expression his face wants to make.
“Shit, are you sick?”
We can help you, Tony.
I thought you guys were just taking a short break.
Tommy’s sight goes in and out of focus. “When you told us about mom and Victor and you.” Tommy turns his back to his dad, suddenly ashamed of what he had said. “I never told you because it didn’t last very long, me thinking I hated you. Of course I can’t hate you. You’re my
To help.
You didn't have to beg or whatever it is you did.
Billy visits often outside of the Holidays, what with living only a few minutes away from Tony, in Upper Manhattan, and being in general control of his own schedule; perks of being a freelance writer. Tony is thankful that at least one of them lives so close by.
Steve laughs.
Tony had stood there, silent, searching for any indication whether he should or shouldn’t answer. There had been about a million different ways to interpret what Erik had just said, and Tony’s mind had been racing through all of them.
Sam is on his way here and he’s bringing home pizza.
Present.
What, that it would help me look at the value of your own life any less?
Are you winking?
Let the man enjoy his pizza.
Steve took a few creative liberties with the painting. They have their arms around each other’s shoulders, although they had been far from being that close during their first trip to the MET. Tony even vaguely remembers thinking that Steve had hated him.
Tony wraps Steve in an embrace, placing Steve’s head on his chest, and kisses the crown of his head. A few drops of tea spill on the furry carpet and Steve’s knee, but he doesn’t mind the burn.
“I don’t exactly find you to be in a ‘nice’ position, either.”
“So you’ve said.”
I’m just covering all my bases.
Ḭ̴̧̝͖̲̮̅͋͋͊̕
“We’re going around in circles. This conversation is going around in circles,” Tony mutters. He has one hand over his eyes. Tony suddenly looks ten times older than he actually is. “We’re never gonna get anywhere with this, Tommy. I don’t want us at each other’s necks when this is the only time you’re home.”
Well, at least Tony has a few more days to deal with that before Erik arrives.
“They’re ten pairs of socks!”
“Uncle Pietro—”
“Then we’re not gonna ask you to break up with him. Obviously, we’re gonna wanna meet him. And sure, it’s going to be weird at first, but you deserve to be happy too. And if we see that he isn’t like all the others—”
“Maybe, like, a field trip with a few old students?"
Peter’s throat gurgles with saliva and bile, and when Steve takes a good look at him, there are unshed tears in his eyes. He appears red in the nose, and he sniffles as he swallows down a sob.
They had them on for less than fifteen minutes.
“He’ll wake up. Whatever’s in that boy, it’s kept him alive and it’ll wake him up.”
I shouldn’t have asked him to come.
“Dad. Go.”
Tony gives the room a quick once-over as he listens to Tommy. Steve, Sam, and Bucky are all keeping themselves busy in the kitchen, putting chips in bowls, mixing a few drinks—none of which are for Tony’s consumption, he’ll have water, thank you—and bringing out plates and glasses and napkins. Steve reheats the chili they had prepared the previous day, and when Tony gets a whiff of it, his mouth waters. “Uhuh. A party. Right.”
"I heard JARVIS. It's the, uh...I have super hearing now."
“No one is sick—”
“Tommy. I don’t—”
Steve blushes when Tommy shoves him with a shoulder. “I wouldn’t call her...
helping!
Tony extends his legs in front of him. “They're gonna wanna know where and they’re gonna ask for—”
Okay, um…
“Yep.”
Tony sits up slowly. He rubs his face, scratches at his scalp, and he stretches and yawns into a more comfortable position. “We had just gotten off the London Eye. We thought Peter would be more afraid of the height, but he couldn’t stop pointing at places we’ve already visited.”
“Some university friend who wants to see you. Said he heard you were in the city and wanted to say hi.”
Just shut up and stay where you are!
Tony flops down on their bed face first and screams into the mattress.
Tony diverts his gaze from the two, but ends up facing Billy instead, and he could argue that that’s a lot worse than facing the fact that his boyfriend and his son’s husband does not only look similar, they also carry themselves almost the exact same way. And their heights don’t offer a lot of difference either.
Whatever you’re comfortable with.
Oh, for fuck’s—
“It’s not—”
Steve sighs. “Sorry. I wasn’t a very good tour guide. Ma always told me about the town, but she never got into specifics.”
"Nah," Peter says as he chuckles. "I think it's funny."
“So, I made a few calls behind your back,” Tony says to Steve as he wipes a smear of ketchup from Peter’s cheek.
"Because you were convinced he uses the 5-in-1 stuff," Steve says with a laugh.
“Looks like he’s ordering coffee.”
"Home is being myself. Home is in finding me."
“Tommy…”
“The privacy—”
“That does sound familiar.” Billy finishes off his pancakes by wiping the last square across the syrup smeared all over his plate. “And Bucky’s doctor...?”
Tony braces himself for the voice that comes next.

Is this our cue, Buck?
Billy nods but not before taking in the situation. He looks at Tony then looks at Steve. He shakes his head, pushing Tommy to the hallway and closing the door behind him with a soft click.
“Well…” Tony doesn’t spare a glance at Billy. “He’s turning twenty-eight next year. So that still makes Steve older.” Even to his ears, the reasoning sounded weak.
, as Tony had liked to dub the quiet mornings spent eating cereal and left-over dinner before they all head to work, they had appeared in the evenings for movie nights and game nights and Nerf gun nights and whatever other
Steve kisses his forehead. “We’ll get there.”
Tony laughs and flicks Tommy on the forehead with his forefinger. “Do you want your initials on your new socks?”
Steve kisses Tony’s forehead and says, “
Noh-Varr nods. “Yes. For Tommy. Okay.”
"Students," Tony replies without missing a beat. "They're here to do an interview."
Tony Stark.
Noh-Varr nods. “Tommy mentioned.”
He blinks.
Tommy gasps, frenetic as he pats himself down in search of his phone. “That’s mine. Sorry,” he says as he reaches into the pockets of his pants and finds the device buzzing twice in a single beat. He takes it out only to silence the call. “What were you saying?”
Tommy sighs in relief, though he tries to appear like he has his shit together.
“Stop. I need to let this all out before I get distracted again.” Tommy clears his throat and lays the side of his head on the bed. “I didn’t understand then how you could be with Victor, even after you found out he was still with Wanda. That he was still with
“Yes.”
“Noh-Varr.”
Tony wants to laugh. He stifles a soft wheeze by pressing his lips together tightly.
That’s why I’m—
I don’t know.
, because that’s a statement so far beyond reason it might as well toss itself into the sun.
It had been Tony who had found him, the first time around. Tony, who picked up where his father had left off and continued the search for America’s hero. After Steve had been thawed and warmed up, after he had awoken in a bed, in a mock-up of a 40’s hospital room, a Dodgers game playing on the radio from beside him, it had been the large brown eyes of a much younger Tony Stark staring down at him, telling him how it hadn’t been his idea to play dress-up and pretend. It had been Tony who looked after him then, even when Steve hadn’t welcomed all the fuss over him, and it’s Tony who takes care of him now.
“Feeling...distracted,” Tony admits. “But yeah. A little. I feel better. But nothing too different yet.”
No one passes up an opportunity to live in a big apartment unit in Manhattan. At least, no one Tony had known before.
“I do.”
Noh-Varr puts his glass of milk down and says, “New York milk is good.”
Steve leans in, and smiles into Tony’s lips. “I love you.”
for Christmas.”
“As I recall, sir, Young Master Stark’s privacy comes first. It’s my pleasure to have served that protocol for as long as I have,” comes JARVIS’ voice through the tiny speakers embedded on the side.
“Is Uncle Pietro sick?”
Bucky snickers when Tony flips him off again.
Tommy stays quiet.
Billy and Tommy’s brows furrow. “Okay, he’s a dude,” the former says.
“Now’s not a good time, kid.”
Let’s not try to make things more awkward, Tony.

“Pop-pop?”
"Tommy."
“Pietro and Vision were
“I could’ve. But you got some sleep.” Tony makes a turn as the GPS instructs. Their destination is finally set back to their cabin. “What are you thinking?”
Like, say, going for a walk during a cold afternoon in one of the busiest places in New York during Christmas.
You think this little break is gonna make me stop loving you.
It’s evil, I tell you.
"Meh, semantics."
“Please, Mr. Stark,” comes the voice over the intercom, the thick Halan accent making it through, and it makes Tommy’s heart skip a beat. “I just want to drop off some gifts. I can’t contact him. My phone died and—”
Tony is slightly taken aback, hand rising to his mouth and wiping off the mustard with his thumb.
Teddy doesn’t say anything, only sits up with Billy and gives him a back rub.
Steve makes a face. "I hope I didn't—God, I hope I didn't fuck it up with Peter."
It's Tony's turn to squeeze Steve's hand. "We looked for you in the pantry, the commons, Bruce's lab. You weren't in my workshop, either. Only Bruce had been around to help afterward because the rest of the Avengers didn't come home til later. Then JARVIS told us that we needed to change. There was still blood on your Pop's suit, and my undersuit was torn and soiled in a few places. We worried the mess was going to freak you out so we agreed, and Uncle Bruce and Uncle Happy took over for us while we cleaned up."
“You,” Tony says in between breaths.
Tony rolls his eyes at the characters’ lack of foresight.
“If he made it this far in life, then an airplane ride won’t hurt him.”
“Not really. I’m not allowed to check the attic.”
He’s heartbroken.
“Ugh, Tommy,” comes Billy’s voice.
“That’s two for the birds and two for me,” Tommy teases, his voice the hoarsest they’ve been that day. “What else?”
The softest solitary bell sound comes through his phone.
Like a prayer?
"Is it okay if I...if I don't see him? I don't…"
“It’s okay, Tony,” Steve says. “He’s not derailing anything.”
“Yeah, yeah. Fine!”
“I told them everything they need to know, Steve.” Tony crosses his arms over his chest. He glances at Steve, staring at the ceiling with his fingers interlaced over his belly.
