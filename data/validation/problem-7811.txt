They walked over to Peter's attached bath and then lazily undressed each other of the few parcels of clothing they slipped on before going to sleep. Wade was content to move at the slow pace Peter was going. He may have even taken a little pride from it. After all, he did tire out the Amazing Spider-Man with his lovemaking skills.
But he was no machine. James was a man who had a will, who could make his own choices, and who could love who he chose…and he chose Natasha.
He watched the videos on multiple screens in the main conference room of his base.
The subject was named “Spiderman” since his DNA was spliced with that of a gamma-radiated spider’s, though Norman never used the ridiculous name. “The boy” was name enough for him.
He leaned back and enjoyed the view of his new country pass by.
Thor was the only one who could keep up with him and the others were racing to follow.
He sat up and grumbled into his communicator, “Avengers Assemble.”
Tony had been walking around in his Iron Man suit for the last few days in an aloof manner but now he was all wide-eyed and clearly excited. When he was able, he shot Steve random questions about little things he saw like the shoes the soldiers wore or what duties they were performing. He clearly been wondering some things for days and had probably a buildup of questions for him. Steve happily replied when he was able.
They shared a silent moment, both staring out to the ocean.
“It’s almost time for Harry to head home,” Tony said with a shrug. “Plus it’s already over their time limit.”
MJ chuckled as she drew back but she kept her hands on him as she looked at him. she asked, “So who is Wade? And how did you make Pete fall for you in the middle of this mess with the press?”
“Yes, sir,” the junior agent murmured on the other end. The young man had to be standing only a few feet dozen from history. They had finally found it: the plane that had crashed into the arctic decades prior – the Captain’s plane.
Was Steve seeing Tony or was he already imagining somebody else? The thought pinched at his chest but he brushed it away.
“No, but I did record his companion speaking with him. He called him, ‘Chewie.’”
Pepper had left him a message on his phone about going into the office early that morning, so it was just Tony and Bucky alone all day.
Tony snapped open his eyes to see Steve staring down at him in horror.
Regardless of whatever happened between you two, he knew it. Treasure what you had, do not lament it, otherwise your memories will be tarnished.”
, are you trying to have your way with me tonight?”
“Err….” Peter said, feeling awkward. A shadow of the video he watched earlier came to mind and the Youtuber mockingly whispered in his ear, “He’s just doing this for attention.” Peter’s stomach flipped. He didn’t want this.
“Bucky…” Steve whispered. He wanted to comfort him. He wanted to reveal how much he cared for him. Yet the words were stifled in his throat. An image of Tony flashed through his mind and Steve clutched his thighs just as tightly as Bucky was doing to his own. He whispered, “He’s good to me, Bucky. I love him…”
New chapter! \o/
“J, start asking people to pack up and go,” Tony said.
“Likewise,” the doctor replied with a coy smile. She shook his hand then said to both of them, “I will give you two some catching up time. I’m going to return to my experiment.”
Steve clapped Tony on his shoulder and stated, “Don’t worry, Pep and I will help.”
“Yes,” Howard answered for Tony.
Peter flushed, feeling tongue-tied.
They hadn’t left each other’s sides since the first meeting. Steve never felt so happy and ecstatic in his life. It had been over a month since that faithful day and he couldn’t believe how much they had changed since then. Steve could actually imagine starting to construct a future with the man beside him.
“If he was fine with calling you Pops, I think he'll be fine with having you officially becoming one of his dads,” Tony replied.
Steve ducked his head closer to Tony and teased, “Not unless the ‘fucking’ comment counts?”
Steve refused to let go of him the entire night…but, come morning, Tony was torn from his arms like he was every time his soulmate woke…like he always will.
“He was not supposed to know,” Steve interjected.
The white blinked…an eye? Two eyes blinked and then a mouth grinned at him with pointed carnivorous teeth. Steve leaned back and garbled, “P-Peter?”
He and Tony exchanged glances. Tony was still in the kitchen. He was no longer making coffee but was now in charge of making the mixed drinks at the bar. Ben and Sam were waiting on him to blend something. Tony shrugged when he caught Steve’s eye as if he was saying, “Maybe things are better.”
Steve carded his fingers through Tony’s hand and looked at him with this warm, gooey smile that made Tony feel like he was melting under the sunny rays of his gaze. It was full of love and joy and so much excitement. Tony stared at his husband’s face and couldn’t help but remember all the impossible years they’d been together and how much light Steve brought into Tony’s life. Tony hadn’t known the true meaning of joy and content…until that day he met this legendary super solider and was ordered not to flirt with him. Out of all the rules and orders to break, that one changed the entire course of his life and he was so glad he did it. If he hadn’t flirted with Steve, not only would he have not had Steve but, he’d also probably still be drinking and still avoiding the fact that he had a son. Steve was the very precursor to Tony’s life story.
The audience ate up their banter and Peter smiled happily at his parents as they teased each other. Sophie was forced to return to the topic of life with the Avengers and they finished the segment within the hour.
He hadn’t left the building yet but he already felt lighter with his decision.
“I have it on me,” Peter replied with a grin. He couldn't wait to see their faces once Venom was in action.
Steve fell silent and became instantly alert as did the other Avengers within Iron Man’s line of sight, his AI had broadcast to all of them.
Steve clenched his jaw but did not break his eyes away from Tony’s accusing gaze. He stated, “And I will regret that for years to come…”
Bucky traced his lips and smeared away a bit of blood left over from his lacerated tongue. He grinned at his red fingertips then looked to Steve and chuckled.
Peter finally returned to his parents’ apartment and a strange cluster of emotions began to grow within him. On the one hand, he was excited to see Wade and introduce him as his boyfriend to his parents…on the other, he was wary how Wade and his parents would get along, Tony and Wade especially.
Why would his aunt and uncle keep this from him?
He’d done the one thing Cable had warned him not to do! What was going to happen now?? What was going to change??
For once in his life, Tony was struck totally speechless. When the silence expanded past the socially acceptable limit, Steve’s face crumpled and he looked away from Tony. His hand gently reached around Tony’s back and he lightly pushed him toward the shower. Tony willingly stumbled into the warm water and he leaned into the tiled wall, letting the water wash over his naked body.
A white bag with a grease stain and a logo he didn’t recognize sat on Wade’s other side. He could smell freshly cooked meat and southwestern spices coming from it.
(See the end of the chapter for
,” Howard hissed. He found his son on stage and saw he was already looking at him. Tony shot him a glare and looked away sharply. Oh, boy, he was upset.
“Tony…” She apprehensively murmured.
Cable smirked at Steve but then looked to Tony and frowned. He hissed, “If you call me Terminator again, I will knock your head off, Time Travel inventor or not…”
As soon as he heard the alarm, Tony dropped the zucchini and raced to his lab and jumped in his suit. Once inside, he demanded, “What happened?!”
Peter flushed. Well, it was a pet name but…it wasn't normal. He’d never heard anyone else use it but Wade and…Peter’s flush deepened, well baby boy was
Schmidt looked like he was holding back his laughter and he stated the final trigger with relish, “Freight car.”
Ben nodded and his gaze fell back on the photo. He whispered, “Richard and Mary talked about having children. They wanted two, a boy and a girl. I’m glad Mary was able to bring a boy into this world… Even though you are not the father she expected for her son, I know you will raise him right.”
And now the boys are together!
“Whenever you are, kid,” she replied, stretching her arms in front of her.
He did not have to look far. Someone, Pepper most likely, had thought ahead and placed his phone on his bedside within reaching distance. Shifting carefully, Tony reached out and grasped it off the bedside table. As soon as his eyes fell on the device, it activated and Jarvis’s voice emanated over the speakers.
. Steve was from the 40s. He still thought all of this was still considered “immoral” and they could be arrested.
Logan exhaled a large cloud of smoke and tapped his leg a few times before reaching into his pocket and pulling out his phone.
Above him, Steve and the Soldier continued fight and his boyfriend was begging the other man to stop. He kept calling the Soldier “Bucky” and was enraging the Soldier, making him fight more fiercely.
Steve grabbed Cable and demanded, “What did you say?”
shield. This person had CAP’s Shield. Anger was beginning to boil in his stomach. Were they planning to sell it on the black market?
Tony’s eyes snapped back open and his guilt redoubled. He wasn’t going to get any rest until he could finally meet Steve’s gaze and he could finally answer Steve wordless plea.
She opened the door and gasped, “Oh my goodness! Are you two lost?”
‘So they also use baby boy? ;D’
He did not pause to wonder what happened or gloss over his memories. There was no air in the enclosed space and he could already feel his mind beginning to grow fuzzy. He needed to act fast before he fell unconscious.
Steve’s mouth quirked into a small smile and he whispered, “It’ll come with time. The alternative would be me still being frozen so this is definitely an improvement.”
. It meant there was still a small chance of finding him and Tony was big on accomplishing the impossible.
His relief was short lived as Venom was being attack on all sides by the Avengers. Venom was quick and its body was almost like fluid as it moved and dodged attacks by taking inhuman forms but the Avengers were still able to hit him, Tony especially.
“I thought he’d stop once he got his soulmate but it looks like he isn’t done sleeping around. He probably is missing
He went straight to the elevator and could hear Clint grilling Natasha on all the details about what happened. As he stepped in the elevator he asked Jarvis, “Is Tony still in his workshop?”
Steve accepted the wrench and twirled it between his fingers thoughtfully. Steve considered the letters the little guy couldn’t pronounce yet and the general sound. He doubted this boy was named pony or boney, but maybe…
“He’s 13,” the woman replied and Tony made a choking noise. She stated, “No, I need your help.”
“I hope not,” Tony retorted. “If we have to go to the Wild West, I would literally tear out my hair. I went crazy enough with the lack of technology in the 40s…”
Marcel walked up to them and explained, “The prosecution is delaying the proceedings. Tyler is upset. It’s a sure sign they told her they’re not going to pursue this!”
Grinning cheekily, Tony undid his jeans and let gravity take over in dropping them. He was naked underneath and Steve could not look away from the sight. He'd seen plenty of naked men in the army but the fact that Tony was aroused because of him…Steve near about came at the sight. He so badly wanted to kiss and touch him but he remained where he was on the bed and waited for Tony.
Steve bit his lip and struggled to come up with an answer but was unable.
Tony laughed and grabbed Steve’s chin, putting a stop to his kisses. Tony teased, “Not that I don’t love the compliments, but your kiss will do for now, beloved.”
So sorry for the wait but the space time continuum is a bitch and I had to make sure everything adds up correctly so it'll all make sense in the end! :)
He was going to face death alone.
Peter hummed and pressed them together again and they both groaned.
“His father?” Mary asked in confusion.
Peter was currently leaning into Steve’s leg with his tiny arm wrapped around it, watching his parents kiss with an indifferent stare. It wasn’t the first time he’d seen them do it and it certainly wouldn’t be the last.
. I can find traces of Peter’s DNA in it to draw the symbiote to Peter but since your genetic codes are so similar the Venom remains on you are evolving and adhering to
Steve tossed the shoes on the floor and said, “If you were hungry, you should have just said something.”
The truck caring their food supply had fresh bullet holes marring its side. Soldiers were unloading the supplies and checking for damage. They came to attention when Steve ran up to them.
Venom stepped in front of Steve and shrieked defiantly at him. Steve tried to dodge him but the symbiote moved with him and pushed Steve back. Steve avoided Venom’s initial attack, not because he was focused on the fight, but because he was trying to keep his eyes focused on his husband. But Venom landed a blow and Steve went flying across the room.
Tony promised and the lie burned his throat. He was going to drink all night to catch up on the time he missed. His mouth was dry since he woke and he needed to quench his thirst.
Stark had been harassing SHIELD for weeks for documentation on Project Rebirth. Fury had just assumed Stark was using it to annoy him but now he could not help but wonder if he had ulterior motives.
“Ask where my kids are!” Clint gasped. Natasha grabbed his hand and the archer grabbed her offered hand with both of his.
He lasted five minutes into seeing the insides of Bucky’s arm and he ready to hurt someone again.
Peter nodded, understanding, but he still couldn’t wipe the frown off his face.
Kilian turned back to them and his eyes focused on Steve.
Gasping like he had run miles, Peter used the alleyway’s wall as support as he pushed himself toward the main road.
He fell to his knees beside Peter. Tony tried to speak, his words were indiscernible, but Steve could read his lips. He was trying to say, “I love you.”
Tony slowly lay back as Steve just as slowly crawled onto the bed and lowered him onto the mattress. He moved just as slowly as Tony did because he probably was not wanting them to separate anymore than Tony did. The constant touching was a life line that would probably take days to cut.
Still smiling to himself, Peter snuggled back into Wade's embrace. With his face inches from Wade's, and their noses just barely touching. Peter gently traced the side of Wade’s face with his finger, feeling out the shape of his jaw under the rough, pitted skin. He stared into Wade’s relaxed and closed eyes and felt blessed by the fact that he was one of the rare few who got to see him like this.
Tony...Tony was not going to be able to hold on much longer…
Tony held out his hand and said, “If you swear to me you will, then it’s practically a done deal. Captain America never goes back on his promises.”
“This isn’t your fault, Wade,” Steve whispered.
insignificant to you? And how many more blows will Peter and Wade have to take until you get your head out of your ass?? How else am I supposed to react when you are threatening to break our family apart?! Did you not hear Peter?? Do you really want to push him away because you were too stubborn to just get to know Wade Wilson? I’m your husband and I love you but…” Steve paused to catch his breath. His breathing was shallow and looked down with a broken expression, struggling to contain his emotions. He carefully continued, with a measured voice, “But I can’t stand beside you in this.”
“None of us have told anyone about Peter, not even Dr. Foster,” Natasha added.
In the time it took Steve to bring him his favorite moccasin slippers, Tony was able to drink most of the coffee.
Steve asked, “Is there a chance we could speak in private? Are you home alone right now?”
“Agreed,” Steve whispered. He spun around and grabbed his shield. As he slid it onto his arm, he asked, “Can I get a lift?”
Steve ducked his head and affirmed, “Our kids are going to be best friends like us.”
. The first chapter should be posted in a couple of weeks! Hope you guys will check it out! :)
,” Mary whispered fondly. “I haven’t been called that in years.”
Tony grinned and motioned to his waist where a noticeable bulge was and stated, “Then I suggest you let me and Steve return to our activities, otherwise, you’re going to have to wait a while and get a very irritable Tony.”
Steve did. His eyes were glassy with fever and Tony wanted to reach through the screen and hold him but all he could do was watch, hypnotized by the fact that Steve was there and alive and he was so scared about what they were going to do to him. Because this was not a coincidence. This was a show, for Tony, the Avengers, or all of them. The Red Skull wanted to deliver a message and he was going to use Steve to hurt them more.
What if this was it…the end?
,” Peter groaned. “
“Then, in the end, it will really determine when you are ready,” Logan said, stating the obvious but, with it spelled it for him like this, he felt it really settle in.
What exactly has happened to the future and the suit will be revealed next time! Thanks for reading! :)
Steve’s heart palpitated painfully as he darkly wondered…what if the future wasn’t changing back because of Steve? What if he was the one? Was it because he was still struggling to let Tony go?
This amazing man, New York’s beloved superhero,
Steve narrowed his eyes and asked, “Why are you dragging this out? Why keep me alive? If you’re going to destroy me just do it already. Why all the theatrics?”
Peter grinned at them and, at that moment, for the first time, in a long, long time, all the depression and pain disappeared. Peter felt safe and
“Tony-Tony-,” Steve struggled. “You’re still just a child!”
Tony wound his arms around the super soldier just as tightly and had to bite down on his lip to keep himself from asking the same of Steve.
Tony reached the penthouse but the shutters were in place. Tony demanded, “Let me in!!”
He was going to die.
“There should still be a Hydra safe house here,” Bucky murmured, slipping off the bike without looking at Steve. He avoided the front door and went around back.
“How shall I hurt you today, Captain?”
“Nothing,” he confirmed.
“Got it,” the President replied. He and the agent buckled themselves into their seats and went right back to their discussion.
As soon as he sat up, the AI stated, “Good Morning, Mr. Brock. Due to a security breach, you will need to stay confined to your room until it is resolved. Would you like me have someone bring you breakfast?”
Who knew nipple play was a thing for him?
Peter licked his lips and whispered, “We’ll both do it.”
Tony had a workshop there and he constructed manacles for the super soldier. The military grade metal seemed to be enough to contain and hold him down so far…
Howard sputtered unintelligibly and then garbled, “I-Is it coming back??”
“I only asked her—,” Bucky began.
“Tell the Captain, the Red Skull was just here!” The leader of the American force hissed to a subordinate. The soldier ran out of the room but Tony ignored it all to interrogate the agent in front of him.
The audience, even the studio’s cameras, seemed to lean in closer with baited breath.
He began to breathe shallowly and Bucky said something but Tony didn’t hear it. All he could hear was the pounding of his heart.
Peter hit the wall of a building and stuck to its side with his fingertips. He looked up to Tony with his glass eyes and Tony asked, “Are we going to see you for dinner or what?”
The police officer’s eyes widened and he gasped, “Do you know him or where he is?”
“With this swelling...this looks like some kind of reaction to an infection, specifically in your veins,” Gabe murmured thoughtfully. He put his medical bag on the table and rummaged through it. He pulled out a small bottle with a clear liquid and then stuck it with a syringe.
in love with you.”
Tony snorted but wholeheartedly agreed, “Yes, that sounds like a plan.”
Steve sighed, “Yes, yes they should and that’s why we’re trying.”
For a brief moment, Steve pressed his face into Tony’s hair and inhaled his scent deeply. He gave himself that one moment and, in that moment, he and Tony were together. There was no estrangement in their relationship nor risk to the future. It was just Tony and Steve. They both had survived and were leaning into each other for support in more than one way.
Guilt and sadness twisted inside him and Steve sighed, “Yes…”
“Thanks, Dad,” Peter replied sarcastically.
Knowing Tony was teasing him, Steve did not back down and boldly flirted back, “I liked what I saw.”
“Wade?”
Steve winced and said, “Please, don’t let Tony know. You can do all the digging you want just…just keep quiet about it…”
Tony twirled away, stepped back around the counter, and returned to emptying the bags.
Steve smiled gratefully at the other man and said, “Thank you, I think I’ll do all that…bar the mindless games…”
“He’s just a child!” Steve countered.
Howard hired a private car to move the tesseract and Peggy commandeered one of 107
“He probably won’t,” Steve admitted. “But even if there’s the tiniest of possibilities…”
“The Young Osborn,” Uncle Thor murmured with recognition. “But what of supervision? Your parents do not like to leave you alone without elders.”
But he gladly keep the pretense up if it meant his son was happy and, when Peter smiled at him, all of his worries disappeared. He stopped his pacing and said, “Hey, Pete.”
“Hand’ em over,” Uncle Bucky said, grasping Peter’s torso. He easily pulled Peter out of his pops’ grasp. Peter felt immensely baffled as he looked between his pops and Uncle Bucky with increasing misunderstanding.
Cable wasn’t much of a talker and wordlessly hunched over the reactor, immediately getting to work putting it back together.
Tony’s mouth twitched into a half smile and he replied, “Not at all.”
“No, bad call!” Tony gasped, “He loves his hammer!” He reached out to the god but he pushed Tony away like he was nothing.
“We all do eventually,” Tony pointed out. Tony ran his fingers through Steve’s hair, reminiscing with its texture, and sadly whispered, “Just some do sooner than others.”
But Tony did not let go. Steve stumbled forward a few steps and Tony slammed to the ground, shouting out in pain when his arm bent at an odd angle, holding onto Steve.
They let him go on even though the departure wasn’t for another two hours.
He followed Bucky to where Bruce, Scott, and Hope Pym were already setting up in a spot cleared of rubble, using Scott's old van and the scavenable pieces of the time machine Tony had built.
“Not both of you too…” Steve groaned. Even Bruce was getting into it.
Into his neck, Tony whispered, “I only know what Howard told me as a child…I don’t know if he embellished anything…”
Tony had expected for Steve to readily agree, especially by the way the man had been smiling at him ever since he saw Tony. He was interested in Tony. He also wanted this so it should have been easy…
“I know,” Uncle Bucky gritted but he did not stop his pacing or release Peter. Pops once told Peter that Uncle Bucky held Peter as a last line of defense. When Peter was a toddler, and his uncle was just beginning to recover his memories, he held Peter all the time. He used Peter as an anchor and, whenever he felt himself slipping, he grabbed onto Peter.
Tony spun around and muffled a curse. Bucky was leaning against the wall with a semi amused grin.
“…I could help,” Peter whispered. He may have been physically weak at the moment but he still had his spider-sense. He could use it to help the team in the coming fight. He needed to do something to help Pops. He couldn’t be expected to sit around and do
“Ben, I am going to pack some clothes for Peter and me. I-I can't stay in the Tower. Everything reminds me of him. It is making me insane. I need to clear my head.” Like this he was more destructive than helpful for Peter.
But he’d never kissed anyone without meaning to, he’d never pursued romantic entanglements with friends without thinking on it for a long time, and he’d certainly never done this with a man.
A part of this place belonged to him now.
He thrust his fingers into him a few more times then added a forth. Steve thrust fervently into Tony’s hand, wanting more.
Wade was approaching them and he seemed fine despite having his arm ripped off 10 minutes prior. Wade had made him go to Tony and had assured him that losing his arm was “just a scratch” and it’d grow back. Steve took him at his word at the time but was that really possible??
Once again, he fearfully wondered what would happen to them if Steve was prosecuted.
Tony was all that was left to Steve.
The Avengers filled in solemnly, followed by Bucky, then lastly by the Parkers. A tired looking Peter was in May’s arms and his eyes instantly focused on Steve. He stared at Steve blankly as if he did not recognize him. His tiny hands played with the dog-tag attached to his wrist.
Hopefully, they don't bash each other's brains out in the meantime! XD
Steve went bright red and sputtered nonsense. Natasha grinned when she saw she had guessed correctly.
Dum Dum was sitting outside the room. He knew the Commandos had been sitting outside in shifts, waiting for Steve to step out so one of them could take over for him.
– okay?”
They fell asleep wrapped in each other’s arms, with mirroring smiles on each other’s lips.
! Just imagining Steve hurt usually upset Tony but imagining this – Tony felt like his stomach acids were eating him alive at the mere thought.
“I know you’ve killed before. I know there’s a lot bodies on your ledger but…if you can promise me that you won’t kill anyone anymore, then I think I can be with you,” Peter explained. “Otherwise, we need to end this right now before we fall into this too deep.”
Apparently, in this alternative future, Bucky was a super soldier because of the experimentations preformed by Zemo while he was held captive. Bucky…
“Are you suggesting SHIELD falsified the reports, Sir?”
With his eyes already heating up, Tony scrambled to his bathroom. He fell right before the drawer where his sleep medication was. When he grasped the handle to the drawer, he was already starting to hyperventilate.
He flinched from her touch but uncurled and focused his light blue eyes on hers.
He stood and Tony stood with him, not letting go of his hand. He smiled at Steve and whispered, “I’m going to have to show you how to use 21
“Peter was much older when we went to the future and those two were together,” Tony sighed.
Wade pushed Peter back and gasped, “You’ve got John Carpenter’s
He sat against the wall, tapping his finger against his leg in an endless tick.
“St-Stop it,” Tony gasped. “
Mary broke her arm from the agent’s grip and hissed, “You can’t stop me. They won’t even know I was there.”
“Please, Tony,” he gasped. “T-Tony I-I want you-.”
?” Tony’s eyes widened upon Steve’s exclamation.
“James,” she hissed, her fingers digging into his arms.
Tony grinned at the super solider and all the mock seriousness disappeared. Tony led their dance into a wild spurt that had no rhythm or sense. It was just the spinning around, jumping with Gabe’s beat, and holding each other close while sharing laughter and fun in the circle of their arms. They tripped over each other's feet and fell into one another and just laughed and laughed and laughed.
If Tony was scared...this was bad.
“What have I been talking about for the last half hour?” She questioned, “And, in that same amount of time, what have you been doing with your suit?”
“He’s an idiot,” Natasha said, shaking her head and rolling of her eyes. “Is that really all he said?”
Steve smiled sadly and explained, “I went to the funeral alone and you ran into me on the way back. When we got to my place, I told you I would be fine on my own and you barged in like you owned the place and stayed with me the rest of the night. I was grateful…I had put on a show of being brave but I did not want to be alone. You distracted me and comforted me.”
“We love you, Pete,” Tony whispered into Peter’s scalp. Steve smiled gratefully at him. He reached over his son and grasped Tony’s arm. Tony raised his gaze and meet Steve’s with a warm smile. Peter tucked his head into Tony’s neck and sighed contently.
Peter’s eyes instantly focused on the woman he knew to be his mother. In the flesh, there was so much more to her than what a photo or video could ever show. She was shorter than he had imagined and her skin was paler. Since the only times he saw her before now was via photographs, he always imagined her to be smiling but no smile donned her features currently.
Steve nodded his thanks and ran to the team’s personal quinjet. Over the coms, Steve asked, “Clint, can you give me a ride?”
Tony shrugged and sarcastically retorted, “I was young and liked big explosions.”
He’d been taught that his only use was to obey, other than that, he was worthless.
Tony wasn’t lying in his own blood.
Tony was alive and Steve would never push him away again.
Peter hummed in agreement, drawing Wade’s mouth closer to his with a simple touch of his fingers. He whispered against his lips, “For the rest of our lives…”
Steve’s face pinched just as Tony touched it and Tony tensed, expecting to be caught in the act. With his phone in hand, he slipped back into Steve’s side and Steve relaxed. Tony waited until he was sure Steve was under before he pulled out his phone and took a picture of the adorable face of sleeping virtue that was his boyfriend.
“Uh, that’s not your business,” he stated. “Who are you? What do you want?”
Steve so badly wanted to run his fingers through Tony’s hair. Instead, he lightly grasped his arm and promised, “It does, he may have a big head but he’s also a good man. He’s going to grow old and grey and invent many amazing things.”
Tony explained it all to Steve on the ride over.
“I thought you were staying away from her!” Clint hissed.
“What if… I try going to sleep first?” Tony murmured. Steve’s eyebrow shot up nearly to his hairline and Tony hesitantly explained, “I was in the darkness when I was falling out of the sky and…and I wasn’t afraid.” He gripped Steve tighter and, even though he was staring at his beloved, all he could see was the void of space. He said, “The darkness of the dream world compares nothing to the vast emptiness of space…when I entered that portal, I knew if it closed behind me I’d…I’d never see you again.” He met Steve’s eyes and he was brought back to Earth. His muscles relaxed and he whispered, “In the darkness of the dream world, I at least know you are coming and I won’t be alone.”
The detectives on the case were called to the stand first and they gave their testimony on the investigation. It was odd to hear how they viewed Steve. With the belief that he was a rapist, they twisted his reactions from their interview to make Steve seem more callous and unfeeling. Steve couldn’t look at them as they demolished his character.
This was it.
Steve did not look away from the glowing screen of his phone and whispered, “Yes.”
Tony leaned back, slipping out of Steve’s gentle clasp. He felt exhausted, so he whispered, “I think I need to sleep...”
The Goblin held his husband’s limp body and grinned at Steve as he pushed himself up. The Goblin sneered, “You’re just in time, Captain. I was just asking Stark which limb I should tear off first his arm or his leg. He can’t seem to be able to answer me so do you want to decide or shall I?”
MJ had messaged him late last night asking him if: “This was for real?” and forwarded him a copy of his birthday invitation.
Bruce stepped back as Tony leaned back into his wheelchair and closed his eyes. Instantly, he saw Steve’s eyes staring back at him: ice blue as if the darker blue of its coloring had the tint leeched out of it and his stare bored into Tony’s very soul asking him, “Why? Why did you do this?”
Steve picked up Tony’s limp form and held him tight to Steve’s chest. If Tony recognized him it was all over. They’d not only have changed the 21
“Tis Mjölnir’s roar,” Thor stated. “Only a select few can hear it but most can feel it’s effects.”
Tony groaned and carded his hands into Steve’s scalp. He thrust his hips into Steve’s chest, enjoying the additional friction. Steve eye’s look up to him and, from his position so close to Tony’s waist, Tony could easily imagine what Steve would look like sucking him off.
“It isn’t blackmail!” Steve retorted.
It had been like the last chapter to the first book of the series of their lives. A pivotal time that neither of them would ever forget.
A slow jazz number began to play lightly in the background and the lights dimmed.
Peter moved faster than his eyes could follow. One second he was standing on the ground and the next he was flying through the air. Wade flailed his arms and grabbed onto his boyfriend with a frightened yip. Peter laughed and wound his arm tighter around Wade’s waist. Wade was only too happy to hold onto Peter and press himself against the man’s body. Peter’s strong muscles moved under his hold, propelling them up, to the top of the Tower, and Wade’s naughty mind could only think of what those same muscles were capable in bed.
Tony continued, “So, since I strived to explore the stars, I obviously studied the stars. The skies aren’t exactly the same in New York as they are in France but, there are some constellations that can be seen from anywhere on Earth.”
Steve pushed himself just enough out of Bucky’s grasp to look up at him, but not enough to leave the safety of his arms.
Tony ventured back into his lab and asked, “Are you decent?”
“Dad, I'm not twelve,” Peter retorted.
“We decided it would be best to keep your mother’s identity a secret. We told the press it was to protect her identity and reputation. All they know is that she was a close confidant to the Parkers and trusted you with them.”
Peter's hand was indeed moving. It shifted across the floor slowly. Tony turned on the speakers and called out to his son, “Peter!?”
Bucky smiled, his teeth red from the blood dripping from his nose, and he said, “I agree.”
Steve ignored the reporter until the medics took the half-dead man away. He then turned on the reporter with a hard expression and stated, “I am not denying it. I am gay. I always have been. What I was denying was answering such an inane question in the middle of a calamity!”
“Get out of there you two!” Steve said. He saw battle-ready helicopters flying in on the flat screen and his heart dropped. He yelled, “MOVE!”
His uncle began to run his fingers through Peter’s hair repetitively. Peter was instantly soothed by his touch and calmed down.
Yes, that explained it.
“What on Earth did I just miss?” Bruce asked, exchanging confused glances with the Parkers.
The rest of the week had been difficult. Natasha had accepted she would learn about James in stages as his memories slowly returned. But his unknown history as an American unnerved her. Her deepest darkest fear was that one day James would remember everything, remember becoming the Winter Solider was never his choice, and he’d realize that he hated her for what she was: an agent of the Academy, the organization that dehumanized him.
Tony tightened his legs and drew their hips together until their cocks touched. They both moaned heavily into each other’s mouths upon contact and paused to gasp heavily as they adjusted to the new sensation. Tony moved his hips, humping himself into Steve and ran his hands over Steve’s torso in an act of incredible torture.
!” Tony hissed, his voice bordering on frantic. “I need to go! Pencil me in next week!”
Norman was still holding the mercenary’s arm and he threw it to the ground with an angry huff. It flopped awkwardly on the floor and happened to land on one of his feet. He went to stomp on the limb but paused as he finally really looked at it. He was looking at the hand to be exact…a hand wearing a device he’d seen worn a few times by that time traveling freak, Cable.
But it also saw Tony, one step closer to his grave.
Steve nodded and carefully folded the photograph and then slipped it into his pocket.
“Your civilian life is over,” the man opposite him had stated gravely.
So since the normal channels weren't working. He had Jarvis looking into the more unconventional ones. In other words, nearly all of his resources went into the search and it might have been considered somewhat illegal…
Tony’s back was aching from where he had landed on his 1967 Shelby Cobra. The car was completely destroyed along with the floor above and his roof where he had attempted to land. But it was barely a blip on his radar right now because his suit could
“Then why did ours go off at the same time?” Natasha countered. Why would he think it wasn’t real?
Steve's eyes were conflicted and his brows were pinched together as if he were in pain.
Steve pulled back slightly and Tony groaned in protest as he tried to pull Steve back down. Steve let him pull him close enough that their noses touched. He asked, “Where are you, Tony? Are you safe?”
Steve was dragging himself out of the bed within the next hour. Outside, the night sky was giving way to the dawn of a new day and every time he looked out the window it was a different color sky outside. Once he got his land legs back underneath him, he was asking about being discharged.
Steve only broke from Tony’s mouth when it became too much. His entire body tensed and Steve came, rising into Tony’s thrust one last time.
The tinkering was a distraction. He had fully upgraded his suit three times but had yet to use it. No one was calling on the Avengers for help. It was like the world collectively agreed to give the team time to grieve.
The windshield imploded as a metal arm broke through it and robbed their car of its steering wheel. Sam instantly slammed on the breaks and a figure was thrown from their car.
Peter did not dignify his uncle with an answer and glared stubbornly at his bare feet.
“Ow,” Wade murmured, sounding offended.
He’d get Steve out of there and probably end right back in his master’s hands. His master would torture him again for defying orders but the Soldier would survive it, just as he would survive the memory wipe that would destroy all of the new memories that had arisen.
Tony nodded and whispered, “She ended it with me when she became pregnant. She, Richard, and the rest of the Parker family cut off all ties with me and anything Stark… and raised my son as their own. I doubt he even knows I am his father.”
She whispered, “We need to get you out of here.”
She soon found herself watching the man for no reason other than just to watch him to try and understand him. Why hadn’t he done anything? What was his motive?
Bruce juggled with what he should do next. Leave or try to talk to Peter…
“Really?! You are so awesome! C-Can I get your autograph?! Can I get a picture with you?! Mom, take our picture,” he said before Steve could answer. Steve chuckled and knelt down on a single knee as the boy took his place beside him. His mother took her phone out and snapped a few pictures.
He grabbed his suit and webbed out of there.
“They weren’t the only ones…” Steve sighed, suddenly feeling very tired.
Great Scott.
“Coming right up!” Steve replied and went into the kitchen with an extra skip to his step.
Peter frowned then looked questioningly to Steve. Steve silently nodded to Peter and Peter said, “He said I should ask if Uncle Bucky could train with us…c-cause I love Uncle Bucky…You love him, don’t you, Auntie Tasha?”
Steve jumped off the bed, his landing was a little unsteady since his head still was out of rights. He gasped, “No, there should not be a next time. You do not have to go at this alone. You are my best friend, Bucky. I’m sorry we cannot be more but-but we can still be friends.”
Steve did not feel rectified upon his answer and shame trickled into his chest. All this time he’d been thinking about himself and how great it would be to finally touch Tony the ways he always wanted. He never considered how weird it must be to his friend… Yes, Tony was bi but…Steve was his friend. Being anything more than that must be strange to Tony.
He looked shaken. From where he was chained, he would have been able to see the video.
“Machine? You mean the cryostasis chamber?” Tony asked.
Could…Did…Was – Was Tony always meant to find the notebook and come to the past?
, you said we weren’t going to kill anymore!” Peter countered.
Tony told himself, come morning, he was going to stop beating around the bush and just confront Steve about it. He did not get a wink of sleep as he examined his conversation with Natasha and Steve’s sudden departures after they made out and after dinner.
“Hm?” Peter whispered, running his fingers over Wade’s scalp.
Steve gulped and did as his friend commanded. He kept his one hand in Tony’s so he could keep caressing his palm but Steve started to move his thumb too. He could not caress Tony’s palm because his thumb was in the way so he caressed the small patch of skin between his thumb and pointer finger.
stinky.”
That elicited an emotional response from the Winter Soldier. The man rose a single brow and dryly repeated, “Jerk?”
Fury stalked up to him and growled, “You stupid, hothead.”
He also had a number of texts and phone calls from contacts and unknown numbers.
“You think so?” Tony asked breathlessly, staring down at the toddler with awe. He obviously did not believe the evident truth.
Vision tipped his head in affirmation and stated, “I have seen Peter brush off high voltage and ampere levels as he examined a malfunctioning equipment. Additionally, he has fought and survived battles with Electro.”
Steve was sitting at the counter with a platter of breakfast food in front of him and he was holding an open newspaper in one hand. Yet, the super solder’s attention was fully on Peter when he asked, “So, how was dad while I was out?”
“Please don’t tell me that’s all you’ve been consuming today,” Steve sighed, pressing his forehead to Tony’s.
Schmidt nodded to the two men who came in after him and they roughly grabbed Steve’s arms and forced him to his knees. He gritted his teeth as his weight settled on the sensitive, healing joints.
“Did you bring the goods?”
Steve needed to hold his son right now. He needed to show him that he was alright. He needed to comfort him after losing his favorite uncle. He needed to be there for him.
He slammed into the Red Skull and pushed him into deep the wall. It cracked around him from the forceful impact but Schmidt seemed unaffected. He grinned up at Tony and murmured, “Ah, the Captain’s soulmate. Did you come to save him? Do you want to know how often he called out to you while I hurt him?”
Steve chuckled as he imagined the sight and rested his head on top of Tony’s. He whispered into his lover’s hair, “No, this is fine…It’s perfect.”
Even his impending death hadn’t hit him this hard. He felt his eyes well up, but he adopted the blank mask he used for most scandals and didn’t let them see how affected he was… He was so angry and most of it was directed at Steve. Why did he do it?? It did more harm than good toward Tony and Steve’s own future.
Eventually, they pulled back and properly looked at each other. Pepper cupped his face and looked deeply into his eyes. She whispered, “You’ve been put through the ringer…”
He stared at his empty hands in horror.
But it did not seem Tony prayed hard enough.
“Yeah, our ETA is five minutes, what’s up?”
It was warm under his touch and quivered lightly. His heart skipped a beat when the shield reached out to him in turn. Black tentacle-like-cords grew around his hand, wiggling in his direction. His Spidey-senses were still not going off so he watched in fascination as black cords reached out and touched his skin.
Both Pops and Uncle Tony looked at Peter with similar expressions of bemusement then they looked at each other and exchanged grins.
Her teammates nodded, even Clint, but his son whined upon Natasha’s suggestion and Clint immediately rubbed comfortingly at his shoulder. He whispered to his son, “I’ll be okay. I’ve got to go save Cap and Iron Man. They’re useless without me. And Mommy has her gun and if anyone comes near she’s going to show them how well a two-time gold winning sharp shooter can handle a 40 caliber.”
Steve sighed heavily and slipped out of bed. He looked at the digital clock at his bedside and saw it was twenty minutes before dawn. He might as well get ready for the new day.
Steve leaned forward and stated, “I’ll be glad to help.”
After SHIELD and Pepper had left, they even made love for the first time in the bedroom, and then the kitchen, and then the living room…
Steve passed the new missives along and each man read the information as they ate. Even Tony looked at the information and his expression hardened from whatever was relayed. Bucky was dying with curiosity to ask him what he thought. Was the information good? How soon were they going to get their hands on Zola?
Tony pulled himself out of the hug and finally took notice of Peter’s clothes. He was wearing his white intern lab coat.
. They would debate constantly about the Avengers, politics, fighting styles, or who’s turn it was to do the dishes, but it hardly turned hostile or ugly.
“Okay,” she chuckled. “Did you pull another all-nighter? Bucky’s arm looks great, but you need to take care of yourself too, Tony. Help him move the clothes. I’ve got Chinese coming. It’ll be here in another twenty minutes and then you, mister, are going to bed.”
Their breathing became harsher as they kissed more enthusiastically and Steve began to slowly move against Tony in a hapless, wanton nature.
Tony laughed and said, “She was the wet dream of all the teenage boys of my generation.”
That night, they held a small, private ceremony with their closest friends in attendance, most of whom were of the Avengers. The Commandos were there as well and Dum Dum hooted the loudest as they kissed. Peter had been their ring bearer and had ran down the aisle in his excitement.
“…You okay, Steve? Do you not want to split up?” Sam asked, noting the change in his demeanor.
“Good!”
What was it that supposedly made them so compatible?
“That better not have been the kiss meant for Marcel,” Tony grumbled.
“Tony probably has a plan,” Bruce interjected from the couch, not sounding too confident.
Peter ran to the lab with his phone buzzing.
He betrayed Tony and there was nothing he could do to take it back.
“I wasn't trying to, J,” Tony sighed and kicked over some pebbles. He murmured, “If this were my timeline and Steve was just another man…” Tony looked to the door Steve had disappeared through and seriously stated, “In another life, nothing would've been an idle flirtation about us…”
,” Tony retorted, instantly on the defensive. “
Tony died in his arms and he could do nothing –
Tony’s heart plummeted far into his chest, farther than he ever thought possible. Steve was looking at him with an apologetic expression, but it took Tony several long seconds to believe what had clearly happened.
“We’re going to move out soon. I need to get ready,” Steve replied but he didn't move away, waiting for Tony to let go of him.
“Best. Birthday. Present. Ever.” Peter replied breathlessly. Wade chuckled and lay on top of Peter, resting his chin on top of his arms right above Peter's receding heartbeat. Peter put his hands on Wade's biceps and reiterated, “You are the best.”
Potts and Stark both looked like he just dropped cold water on them.
SHIELD used both Oscorp and Stark Industries as they were rebuilding. He had been under the impression that his company would merge with the spy organization and he would be heading its new weapons division. But SHIELD changed its mind. They said Norman was too unstable and his ideas were too radical. They dropped him and his company. As soon as the rest of the world heard SHIELD was no longer interested in Oscorp, the share prices in his company dropped significantly.
“It is no problem, sir,” Steve said.
“What is that?” Steve hissed, not understanding.
Bucky reacted to that. He lowered his hand with the broken vase in hand, but he still stood stiffly like he was ready to spring into action again at any moment.
He also wanted his old life as the nobody Peter Parker who could wear his Spidey suit under his clothes without a care…but he was never going to get that back. Would it be the same with this feud between Wade and Tony?
Wade turned to her in time to see her begin to fall with Brock’s foot in front of hers being the cause of her sudden shift in gravity. The glow around her hands disappeared when she hit the ground. Wade immediately turned back to Peter in time to see the magenta magic encasing him disappear. He too fell…but his body jolted to a stop, inches above the ground. The fall saved Peter from getting his head bitten off as Venom only but at air where Peter’s head had once been. But Venom’s tendrils had cut right through him and were skewered into the ground as the very things holding Peter up.
And what a night of surprises it was going to be….
“Good, because I don’t want him running across the country unsupervised, when I tell you that we found Captain Rogers,” Fury grumbled.
But he needed to find clothes before someone found him running around naked.
“Wouldn’t miss it for the world!” Wade replied excitedly, waving to Peter’s aunt with a big grin plastered on his face.
“He’s a very smart and noble four-year-old,” Tony countered, leaning closer to Peter. Peter grinned under Tony’s praise.
The elevator doors opened and Jarvis stated, “Most likely because Master Parker is with him. I tried to warn you, Sir,” his AI added, with a hint of aspiration in its voice.
"I only want what is best for you, Sir."
“Healing, I think I’m going to be all better sooner than I thought,” Steve stated. “Bucky, about that memory—.”
He sprinted to Steve’s room as fast as his stiches would allow and Thor followed, his expression made serious with Tony’s haste.
“Richard is a relative,” Tony whispered hoarsely, his throat was suddenly dry. He did not want to think about the possibility of Peter dying too. “He was my cousin. We share the same grandparents from my mother’s side of the family. You are related by blood, just not as closely as you thought you were.”
“Are you going to eat any breakfast?” Tony asked, crossing his arms over his torso.
Jarvis lowered the volume and Tony stepped up and peered over the outer shell of his tower’s reactor. Pepper stood below him with her arms crossed over her chest and an angry frown marring her face.
Pepper embraced him and held him tightly. Her crisp, white suit was instantly ruined but she didn’t seem to care. Tony melted into her hold and buried his face into Pepper’s red hair. He inhaled the flowery perfume of her shampoo and relaxed into the familiarity of its scent.
The handle shifted under their hands. Both of them tensed and held on with all of their strength, but neither of them were a match for a super soldier in his prime. Maybe if Steve wasn’t sick and hurt, he could have held out…but the “maybe” scenario wasn’t going to help them now.
Natasha’s head snapped up and, when she saw Bucky was awake, yelled, “James! Steve! Get out here or your boys will eat everything!”
“Marrying me will change how everyone perceives him…and take away what little privacy he has left…”
“Uh, the arctic? Unless you moved me?”
The door sealed behind him and Wade reminded himself, “This is for Peter.”
Peggy wrapped an arm around his waist and leaned into his side. Steve leaned back and dropped his head on top of hers and she whispered, “Don’t thank me…You two are falling into a tragic love story and I can see it all enfolding and there’s nothing I can do to stop it…”
Steve looked from the end of the gun barrels and then to the men who pointed them at him and then glared at them.
I know some of you are upset by the ending with Bucky. I reiterate, Steve's human. Since Part 1 I have been eluding to his smothered feelings for Bucky, long before he even thought of Tony any differently than just a friend. I am sorry it upset you and all I can say I have learned my lesson. I wanted the ending to be a surprise but from now on I will tag my fics appropriately.
“Yes,” Steve replied breathlessly. Tony pushed himself up and kissed Steve tenderly. Steve closed his eyes and returned the kiss with a happy sigh. He heard some of the phones around them click as they took their picture but Steve didn't care. He didn't even care if he and Tony were the topic of scrutiny for years to come.
This time it wasn't Steve who flushed and Tony embarrassedly flushed but also fondly smiled down at his notes. Steve's eyes were trapped by those lips. He was becoming obsessed with every way they moved. Tony's gaze rose back up in seconds and Steve saw an excited spark that wasn't there before. His lips quirked into a coy grin and Steve's breath caught in his throat.
But Steve and his parents were dead.
He dreamed of it again…Bucky’s fall.
“Interviewing the Chameleon in a SHIELD interrogation room that smelt like stale cheese is not much of a mission nor very romantic,” Bucky retorted. He picked a slice of bacon off Steve’s plate and Steve elbowed his side.
He walked up to Tony and asked, “Are you sure you’re okay with that?”
Tony groggily woke to the song of “Star Spangled Man” playing from Steve’s phone. Tony grinned into the covers as Steve groaned loudly.
He coughed up more blood and then sighed, long and drawn out.
“But you think I should go back too?” Peter murmured, not moving.
“Very well, Master Rogers,” Jarvis said.
Steve stared at the bag suspiciously and murmured, “I think you’re trying to poison me…”
“We’ll help her,” Steve stated, patting Tony’s hand. Tony nodded sharply.
“So…” Tony dragged out the word. He cleared his throat again and Steve’s eyebrow rose in question. Yeah, Tony was acting weird. He quickly continued, “I was thinking…” He kept one of his hands in Steve’s and then knelt down and reached under the worktable. He pulled out the box with the ring in it, it was a plain metal box he made after he made the ring. It did not look like the usual velvet ring box so Steve looked at it questionably. He was still kneeling as he held up the box and said, “For our 5 year, 3-month anniversary, I wanted…I was wondering, if you wanted to tie the knot?”
“Excuse me?” Steve asked. He must have not heard that right.
Pitch black and void of everything.
“Pull up the top trending on my screen,” Tony stated as his heartrate began to pick up. Did they finally publish the photos from yesterday?
He pointed his hands at Solo and the rubber bullet guns rose out of the shell of his arms. Tony threatened, “Let the girl go now or I will fire.”
“That certainly sounds like him,” Tony halfheartedly chuckled.
Tony’s eyes were wide and no longer hiding his emotions. He was scared.
He wound his arms behind Steve’s neck and Steve pressed him into his chest in a bone crushing embrace. Their mouths met in a desperate kiss which Steve accepted with a repressed sob.
After years of honed fighting, both Wade and Peter were fully awake in an instant and separated from each other like they had been training together for years. Wade grabbed a gun from under his pillow and Peter freed his fists from the blankets and faced the intruder.
Peter had a second parent all along and he never realized it…
Steve smiled warmly as he thought of them. Venom was gone and they had all gotten out of it alive.
“I’m not the one you should be apologizing to,” Steve countered, running his fingers through his hair in repetitive motions.
Deadpool threw back his head and laughed. Logan waited for the man to stop, watching him with a dry expression.
He silently talked to himself in his head to keep himself going:
Wade went still beneath him. Peter leaned into him and opening his mouth to encourage his reaction.
“Oh, my God,” Steve hissed as Tony’s skin was revealed. He removed more bandage and more metallic-black veined skin appeared across Tony’s chest. As the horror grew, he kept hissing, “Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Tony…”
“What should I say, Tony??” Steve demanded, his voice grating under the emotion welling up in it. “I ask time and time again for you to look at Wade in a different light but you keep shooting me down. How many more times do I have to pick myself up until you give in? Or are my opinions really
Natasha shook her head and pushed a bunch of documents into Steve’s hands. She stated, “First things first. We need to bring you back to life legally.”
She’d heard rumors of a super soldier working in the shadows for the KGB. They called him the Winter Soldier and he never missed his mark. It seemed those rumors weren’t false and the man himself just happened to be her soulmate. But…her side throbbed from the bullet wound in her side. She pressed her hand over it to staunch the bleeding. He supposedly never missed his mark and she was the first to not receive a kill shot. Was it really because he wanted to question her on her motive? He could have just told his master she attacked him. What if he had inherently known she was his mate?
“We can’t try to stop the Goblin from stealing the reactor in the first place without altering time more,” Cable stated with absolute certainty. “He’s a strong foe and confronting him in the past will do more damage than good. We can’t risk him killing another influential person. So we’re going to slink after him and fix everything he changes.
Tony kissed him one more time then hopped back and jogged into the bathroom. Steve lounged on the bed and contemplated napping until Tony returned.
In one ear, she had a direct line of the police feed running nonstop. She heard the call for backup on the hostage situation and, when Stark did not appear on stage several seconds later, she rolled her eyes and swung her rifle around and pointed it down the street with the action.
“We shall throw a great feast, one greater than those held in the halls of Valhalla!” Thor exclaimed, clasping the sides of Steve’s face.
“She knew I’d pass it along without too many questions,” Fury nodded.
Tony laughed and leaned happily into his hold. He rested his head on Steve’s shoulder and smiled jubilantly at him. The breath caught in Steve’s throat as he remembered how in love he was with Tony. He leaned down and kissed Tony, his goatee tickling his lips as he did.
“I gave him ample opportunity to shoot me, here in front of the Tower and in Brooklyn. He did not. He must have had a reason to shoot but it was not to kill either of us.”
James came in holding a long lab coat but came to a halt in the doorway.
Steve jumped as soon as her hand came into contact with that button and was flying in the air toward Tony.
Peter’s eyes shot up to his father’s and he looked at him with wide eyes as his shock and hope warred for dominance in his gaze. Had Tony…? Did he put Wade on the list?
“Enigma, sir?”
He and Tony exchanged messages as the day wore on, both of them missed each other and felt more wearied without the other there.
,” Eddie hissed as the mass began to change from black to brown to black again. Gripping the counter with his fingers turning white, Eddie gasped, “The molecules aren’t going to be able to handle it! They’re too unstable!”
Tony broke their kiss and gasped hopefully, “Is Peter with you?”
Grinning, Steve said his thanks and ran over to the gift shop. It was overfilled with every souvenir imaginable. He found some cheap black flip-flops stamped with Hollywood that were his size. It took Steve a few minutes to look through it all, but he found the map he needed. It was in a large, glossy booklet and, thank God, Tony’s house was listed on there.
Before Steve became anymore frantic, Tony pacified, “I survived. Past is past, remember?”
The next hour, Tony and Steve fawned over Peter and quietly spoke about the Mandarin, both giving each other their side of the story.
“You're fidgeting,” Natasha stated to Tony and she plucked a chip out of the bowl in front of her and ate it with a crunch. Steve had put out some snacks for their company and, so far, Natasha was the only one to partake. Steve and Bucky were together in the kitchen trading 40s slang and rhetoric that went over Tony’s head as they whipped up some sandwiches for lunch. Natasha and Tony watched it all from the other side of the counter.
“Hey, how is he?” Tony murmured, lightly grasping his arm.
“Hey,” Tony whispered as he lightly grasped his chin and turned his head enough so that their gazes were meeting again. “What’s with that look? You’ve got Time magazine’s most eligible bachelor laying under you wanting to go another round and-,” Tony paused as he lifted his hand and a bottle of lube appeared in his hand. Smirking, Tony pressed the bottle between their hands and clasped it tight. He whispered, “I want us to take it to the next level. I want to know what you look like when you come with me inside you and I want to know how it feels to come with you inside me. I want to know in every way that is physically possible…”
“What?” Tony said, not really able to form any other words…nor look away from Steve. Steve simply smiled warmly at him, but he didn’t seem to plan to look away any time soon either.
Steve shamefully opened his eyes and fell into the tiled wall at his side.
soul. He didn’t want to upset him or have him upset him in turn but…it was happening, right now, and there was nothing Tony could do to stop it because Tony couldn’t stand down. He loved Steve but he also loved his son too.
Bucky dropped his gun and with a tiny, scared but hopeful voice whispered, “What?”
“Going with my idea to explain why you haven’t been dating then, eh?” Tony grinned as he referred to their prior conversation.
“I won’t tell if you don-,” Tony barely got the last word out before Steve was shamelessly kissing him again. Tony chuckled into his mouth and told himself to remember to seduce Steve by dirty dancing more often. After that, any form of rational thought left him when Steve reached into his underwear and grasped his cock.
The robot nodded its head and then, to Steve's absolute shock, its face rose, revealing a flesh and blood man.
“We’ll get to that when it becomes a problem,” Tony retorted with an eyeroll. He held out his hand to Steve and asked, “So, do we have a deal?”
Steve’s hands bunched Tony’s shirt and they broke the kiss to pull the shirt over his head. Tony’s hands then grabbed Steve’s shirt and he wordlessly pulled it off. Steve wore an undershirt and Tony had on an undershirt in addition to the bandages he had wrapped around his chest. Biting his lip, Steve pulled off his undershirt and Tony whistled.
Steve pressed his face into Bucky’s warm shoulder and felt his very alive heart beating madly against Steve’s chest. He gasped, “How is this possible? How are you alive and here?? You died, Bucky! I saw you die!”
“It’ll be a surprise alright,” Peter replied sarcastically.
He and Tony wore hats, shaded glasses, and clothes they did not usually wear all to remain incognito. He even gave Peter a baseball hat, which he continuously tugged on. They snuck out through the underground garage and drove to a small park in Queens. May Parker met them there and made them all peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Ben could not make it because he had work.
“Mr. Stark, I require another charge,” Jarvis’s voice came out of nowhere making all three of them jump.
to escape this horror so much.
Maybe he was a stalker…with really good parkour skills.
Whoa! Where'd the weekend go? Sorry for the late update, here it is! :)
When they broke their embrace, Tony wiped at his eyes and said, “Listen, Fury seems to think Steve doesn’t have a destination in mind, but I think he’ll come here. I told him about my home in Malibu. This is the only place in the future that he knows about!”
Bucky and Natasha both automatically pointed their weapons at the imposter, while Tony and Sam exchanged confused glances.
If Tony weren’t there Steve would have probably already cracked at that point.
Tony lifted his head and pouted at Steve. Steve grinned and cupped the side of Tony’s face.
Here we go.
He heard Maria panting in shallow gasps beside him and he saw she was pinned, her legs trapped and her beautiful face pale, half covered in blood, and twisted in pain.
!” He’d been holding his breath and was now inhaling it all back in, in large gasps.
. Despite the Red Skull’s efforts, Steve still remembered him. They were going to be okay.
Tony leaned in and whispered, “If we did, you’d be discredited. Everyone would think you really did rape her…” Tony sighed and picked up Steve’s head with both of his hands. When their eyes met, he stated, “What you just watched is only the belief of a small percent of the country.
! What happened?” They pulled away from each other and Mary’s gaze fell and she appeared disheartened. Ben asked, “Mary?”
“Stark’s design was the cornerstone to
Tony’s hand was warm in his as they walked through Central Park. His grasp found Steve’s easily enough, more so by the fact Steve made sure to hold Peter with one hand and kept his free hand by Tony. Tony grasped his hand quickly and, as he did, grinned up at Steve like a child who had found his favorite toy.
“Yes, that is possible,” the medical examiner replied, the tone of his voice, however, showed how much he believed it.
Steve dragged Tony to the elevator and Bucky tried to follow but his legs shook too much for him to do so. He fell back onto his barstool and Natasha hovered to his side, looking concerned.
Steve grinned and he slid into Tony’s arms. He kissed Iron Man’s face plate and murmured, “I missed you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony didn’t put up anymore of a fight with Bucky and went back to work, not feeling as enthused as he did before seeing that image.
Tony was where Bucky and Steve had left him hours prior in his private room. Steve stood outside it for several long moments, collecting his nerve.
, it was driving him mad. He pushed her against the wall with a growl and she snickered when he sucked marks onto her neck too. Her snickers turned into groans when he palmed her breast and rolled his hips into hers.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You don’t need it. They still love you and they’re excited you’re back, Cap,” Natasha promised. Steve smiled in thanks and stepped out.
Most of the tests came back inconclusive but the more in-depth tests would take around 24 hours to run so they called it a night and locked their experiment up tight.
The detective placed his hand on his hip where his revolver was unclipped and ready to use. He stated, “I am going to ask you one more time, put down the shield and come with me. Your DNA results are in. You are a match.”
Eddie must have heard the video and recognized Wade’s voice. So much for being incognito…
,” Steve retorted, his flush growing redder. Blood pulsed to his dick at the very thought of Tony touching himself, nonetheless to the images of
“Late enough,” Pepper promptly replied and sat on the edge of his bed, making him bounce slightly.
Tony lifted his face shield and greeted his late cousin’s wife with a smile. He said, “Hey May, how’s it going?”
Yet whenever these dark thoughts threatened to overcome him again, Steve need merely glance behind him, meet Tony’s warm gaze, and forget all about it. With one look, Tony made him feel like everything was alright and he could figuratively feel their love pool into his chest.
He sat up and looked to the sound of the light whispers and spotted two men sitting by the front of the tent. They were next to a desk with several glowing monitors and Steve’s eyes were drawn to the amazing sight. Those monitors were so-so colorful and defined! They could not possibly be real!
Thor sat outside, in the pouring rain created by his turbulent emotions. Lightening flashed and seemed to be attracted to his hammer as it almost always hit it. The thunder roared and made loose, lightweight objects in the room vibrate.
Ever so slowly, he leaned forward and gently nudged his head into her hand. She could feel him shaking so she carded her fingers through his hair like she used to. He relaxed in seconds and leaned more heavily into her touch.
Tony exited first, followed by Steve who closed the door after them. Tony flinched slightly when he heard the near automatic click as Peter must have raced to lock the door after them.
It was strange to think that he once feared being ousted as a gay man and what he had with Tony was once a far, far away dream.
But there he was, staring at Steve’s casket.
“When Osborn crushed the reactor, he destroyed the only thing that had saved Stark’s life all those years ago and unraveled everything Stark had done…He’s created a paradox that very well may unravel time as we know it.” Cable stated. “Which is why we’re going back to fix it.”
Rogers instantly flushed and gave him an odd look as he replied, “I’m not perfect.”
How did this happen? Where has he been this entire time??
Steve shook his head and murmured, “You just survived a never before attempted surgery and the first thing you ask about is the jello?” Steve sat down next to him on the bed and rested his hand on Tony’s thigh. He whispered, “You are not eating until morning. Doctor’s orders.”
Steve spun around and should not have felt so surprised to see she had jimmied the lock and slipped in while he was out.
formulas that went in to making Venom!”
“I don’t care what it is! I need to save my family!” Clint hissed. “We need to split up. I won’t risk my wife or children!”
They were in love.
“Hello, Captain.”
Tony clenched his fists and struggled in Bucky’s hold as he hissed, “
Tony was on the ground.
The Academy found them just as they were crossing the border.
They grinned at each other with matching smiles and parted still wearing them.
“…I’m not expecting us to jump into sex. I just want to be with you. Cuddling!” Tony nervously said with Steve’s silence. “Like last night! Ugh, that came out wrong!”
Steve laughed and leaned into Tony’s embrace, pressing his hips into Tony’s chest. Tony wrapped his arms around Steve's hips and Steve teasingly asked, “What do you want to do on such a momentous occasion as our 5 year, 3-month anniversary?”
Tony laughed and embraced his friend, asserting, “Steve’s alive.”
Tony did not linger in the cold water long and grabbed the towel he had left at the water’s edge and patted himself down as he shivered. Jarvis opened the suits hands and turned the thrusters on their lowest settings to help warm him up. The air heated around him and his shivering lessened.
experience with the tests?”
BUT Jarvis
Peter sighed and wrapped his arms and legs around his uncle so it would be easier for him to hold Peter. Uncle Bucky’s mind was fragile and Peter felt guilty for stressing him so much. Peter whispered, “I’m sorry…”
All of his fears and trepidations melted away and Tony smiled so widely at his boyfriend -
be one of Tony’s fantasies?
He tried to catch his father’s eye but the man was glaring at Wade. So Peter asked for clarification, “I…I’m sorry?”
Steve affixed a small smile to his own face but he could not look away from the back of Tony’s head and look at the reporters but he still waved too.
What he didn’t expect was to see Bruce be the one standing and interrupting the proceeding. Bruce was visibly shaking with his fists clenched at his waist and his eyes a dangerous shade of green.
Steve gulped and his gaze took on such a serious nature that Tony could not help but remember the man beneath him was Captain America: his leader, the First Avenger, and a Super Soldier.
“I won’t save them,” Tony promised whatever forces controlled the space time continuum. His already broken heart crumbled into a finer dust as he imagined losing Steve.
When Tony woke the next morning, Steve whispered, “Tell me how it happens.”
“We don’t have to hang it up,” Tony reasoned.
(See the end of the chapter for
He was convincing himself more than Panzer.
“The last statement will be stricken from the record,” the judge stated and turned to the medical examiner saying, “Only give us your professional opinion, sir.”
“Yes,
(See the end of the chapter for
His eyes shot back to Clint and he saw the archer was on the verge of a panic attack. Steve saw the photo too and he got to his feet, reassuring their friend, “We’ll get her, Clint.”
“You’re barely lived your life yourself,” the older man argued.
Tony sputtered out the soda he’d just taken a drink from and argued, “Peter is a genius! He knows better! And he’s
“I heard a noise and came to investigate…Did you tell him about me?”
Fury silently left them alone and, with his eyes still closed but his hand tightly grasping Pepper’s, he began to whisper his tale.
Steve dropped a towel to dry off with and spare clothes on the bed, an undershirt and boxers, and said, “I’ll come back in ten minutes. Is that enough time?”
Flushing, Steve pushed himself up to be sitting on his bottom and pulled his pants back on as they had fallen to his knees in his fall. He buckled his pants with a flush and demanded of the machine, “Why do you need to speak to me privately?”
And then snapped.
Peter felt so exponentially heavier to him than he had a few minutes before. He never imagined meeting his future son like this and so soon.
My next fic will be solely superfamily (and maybe some spideypool :D) and it will be a sequel to
Tony scrambled to his feet as soon as he was able. His eyes were riveted on the figure on the bed. In the pale light, Steve face was soft with sleep and Tony hunched over him, waiting for those beautiful blue eyes to open.
The answers he came up with for many were alarmingly bleak.
Scratching the back of his neck awkwardly, Peter asked, “Please don’t give me too much details but, what about the physical aspect?”
“What am I going to do without you?” Steve gasped into his embrace one day, finally revealing what he was being so tightlipped about.
He must have come to some sort of conclusion because he dropped his head and turned back around. His expression was closed off and he went straight back to the elevator, leaving Tony dying of curiosity again.
He shook his head and dislodged her fingers. He whispered, “I need to say g-goodbye to Tony.”
“We’ve got a pantry right down the hall,” Steve murmured.
“What kind of host would I be if I didn’t treat?” Tony admonished. He motioned to the stack of boxes, sitting by the delivery boy’s feet, and said, “But you can help out. I think you can handle the heavy lifting.”
Tony nodded and then cautiously went back to fixing the socket. Bucky stared off into space, his expression was blank, but his eyes were dark with the depth of his hidden feelings.
Bruce placed his hand a pad beside the elevator. There was a flash of light on the pad as it read his palm then the elevator dinged open. They stepped inside and the doors closed behind them.
Tony exchanged glances with Steve and then said to Steve, “I’ll call you as soon as Dr. Cho looks him over or if he wakes up.”
Peter snorted and his parents walked out into gym. They waved to Clint and walked up to where Peter was stretching and Steve asked, “Aren’t you going to get your shield?”
In the 40s, Steve had been ashamed of his attraction to men and before he started dating Tony, his attraction to Tony embarrassed him. Now everything they did was so natural and Steve could not imagine going a day without kissing his boyfriend or telling each other that they loved each other.
“Good old Dad left some valuable notes with SHIELD.”
After all his running, literally in Los Angeles and from the Hydra agents who were after him, he finally made it. Tony was right there.
Logan glanced up from his phone to the man he was just sparring with.
in the flesh. God…he missed her. How many months had it been for him? And how much time had passed for her? A week?
The Soldier lay down on the floor to try to dispel the feeling rising up in his chest. It lingered for a while. It was almost as if something was tethered to the center of his chest and pulling at it moderately, not letting go.
Clint had commandeered the TV again and Thor sat with him. They were watching one of the Star Wars episodes and Thor was loudly commenting on the miraculous feats of the great and wise warrior Yoda but paused when he saw Steve and Tony.
MJ shot him a glare and then turned to Wade and embraced him without any warning. Wade immediately stiffened and MJ said, “It is nice to meet you Wade and thank you for being there for Peter when I couldn’t. I could tell the moment you entered his life because he sounded so much more happier.”
Both men immediately stopped what they were doing and Pepper charged in from the dining room after Peter’s exclamation. Tony glanced at the others and then refocused his gaze on Peter before finally saying, “I am just trying to protect you. You don’t need to worry yourself with what they are saying.”
Peter tucked his head onto Wade's shoulder and whispered, “I’m fine,
He could feel that same horror growing within himself. Why had Venom done that??
Natasha got to her feet and whispered in warning, “
He was never going to do anything with Tony but…maybe if he imagined it, it would go away. Maybe that was the problem? Maybe he just needed to get it flushed out of his system.
Tony shrugged and murmured, “Dad’s just being a jerk and won’t listen to me about stuff…”
Steve looked down. He and Peter locked eyes and, without another word needed, he gathered his son into his arms and held him tightly. Peter did not complain about being picked up in front of his friend like he usually would. Instead, he wrapped his arms tightly around Steve’s neck and asked in a whisper, “Could it really be her, Pops? Are-Are you sure Hydra killed her?”
survive this,” Steve pressed. “You are Tony Stark. You are amazing. A little shrapnel can’t keep you down!”
He stared blankly at the comforter and bitterly swallowed back a lump in his throat.
Steve didn’t see what happened to the Goblin because his entire future was on the ground in a crumpled heap.
“Your pops and I are actually going to meet her again tomorrow,” Uncle Tony replied. “But we thought it best to hold off on bringing you just yet…”
“I am fine,” Steve murmured. He stiffly pushed himself up and asked, “How long have I been out?...And please don’t tell me Peter’s seen me like this.”
“Shit…” Tony murmured to himself.
“Hi,” he said to everyone but his eyes stayed focused on his son. Peter’s brows knotted upon hearing his voice.
The team easily acquiesced and they headed to the safe house.
Steve had wanted this but had to clench his jaw to keep his chin from trembling. He nodded curtly to show he heard him.
Thank you for reading!
“Peter Parker,” he sighed. There was no use in denying it at this point.
Thor grinned and, neither confirmed nor denied Tony’s statement, but replied, “Mjölnir will only be wielded those who are worthy. Tis a stubborn weapon that uses its roar as a battle cry to send shivers down the spines of my enemies.”
“Yes, it’s just…” Bucky sighed and said, “I just wish my dream was really happening. I wish I could go back to that moment in time…”
He heard Steve laugh and grinned mischievously to himself. He walked back to the front of the house, stripping as he did. Eventually he was only in his birthday suit and his cock was already hardening. He opened the front door and leaned on the frame, crossing his arms across his chest. Steve was standing in the warm surf and reaching down to touch the water. It was his first time in a tropical climate and he was only used to the cold waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Steve did not notice Tony and continued to happily marvel at the warm waters.
Aunt Tasha muffled a sob and then stated in a trembling, nonchalant tone, “…Took you long enough.”
“Thanks for the complement, he’s quite badass,” Bucky retorted.
“Just want some notes, Agent,” Tony murmured. “Then I’ll get out of your hair.”
Bucky grumbled, "Stop calling me jerk all the time. Just call me Bucky. It's my name, ain't it?"
“Uncle Bucky…Can I go see…my-my fathers?” Peter stated the plural patriarchal term carefully as he cautiously tested it out.
Steve took a deep breath and pushed himself to his feet.
Steve put down the tub and openly stared at the robot as its eyes followed his movements. He replied, “It’s – ugh – nice to meet you too?”
He did as the officer suggested and jogged to the North end of the park. From there, he followed his nose and found one of the churches the officer spoke of. They gave him warm oatmeal, toast, an orange, and coffee. His stomach gurgled with relief. With his metabolism, it was hardly enough to tide him over but the act of eating alone was amazing.
He was probably thinking the same thing as Steve: How were they going to explain this?
Steve smiled sadly into Tony’s flesh as he remember the extent of their relationship and some of his good feeling disappeared as he whispered, “Yeah…”
It was just making him sad and he had tonight to look forward to! He smiled, thinking of Steve. At least he wasn't completely alone in the past.
“Alright…and thank you, Wade…”
“Thank God,” Steve wetly gasped, clutching the image to his chest.
Without a word exchanged, he and Tony spun around and ran from the building. They ran over a metal bridge, running parallel with the direction the crane was moving.
“I need to speak with Tony privately,” Steve murmured to Peggy, lightly squeezing her arm. She jutted her lip but her expression held the promise of getting answers later. He nodded to her and then looked to Bucky.
“Are you going to let me go?” Steve asked, feeling lighter than he ever had. Tony was alive, he no longer had to hide, and SHIELD could not keep him much longer now that the world knew he was here.
“For the rest of your natural life,” Tony stated.
Since he was in the past, he didn't have to worry about his image with Steve. It was refreshing. However, as he thought about it, he realized he took a lot of things for granted in the future and he really didn't know how much he valued things until he was thrust into this era.
He shoved it on to his own hand and glared across the field at the hero’s ambling to their feet. He hissed, “Two can play at that game.”
Steve silently went up to Tony, placing a holo-counter between them, and whispered, “It was Thor. When I was in the ice, he’s the one who woke me…” Tony’s head snapped up and he stared at Steve with shock. Steve continued, “Or it was the hammer, at least, he’s the reason I’m here. I don’t know if I should thank him or…”
“No! I broke up with him! I…I’m not going to save Steve! Or Bucky! I left him! The timeline should go back to normal! It should correct the future!” Tony argued with his suit.
“Uncle Tony made my sad go away by doing dis,” Peter explained and stretched out his mouth with both pointer fingers and exaggerated gagging noises.
It took him a while to find what he was looking for. In the time since he left it there, the snow had buried everything. Luckily, despite his fainting, he was able to triangulate where he had left them. It took him only a few minutes to find the exact spot and a handful more to dig everything out.
Steve broke the kiss and murmured, “Now what was this thing about super soldiers snuggling with billionaire geniuses?”
Sneaky raised his hands and did something weird with his fingers, creating a V from the space between his middle and ring fingers. The robot sarcastically intoned with a flat voice, “I come in peace.”
Cap and Stark-!” Clint gasped.
“What!?” Peter squawked. “
“I remembered Natasha,” Bucky murmured.
“What’s wrong, Jarvis?” Tony demanded within a heartbeat over the feed.
Steve leaned down and carded his fingers into Tony's hair as he kissed him again, this time more tenderly. Without any fears eating away at him, Tony returned the kiss wholeheartedly.
“Nanotechnology,” Peter supplied. “And that’s all I’m going to say…and don’t look at anything either.”
Peter stepped in, wearing the boring Stark Science Division Intern lab coat and the round glasses that made his eyes look twice as big. Peter smiled at Tony and greeted, “Hi, Dad!”
After a short hiatus of silence, Tony suddenly gasped, “You still love him.”
Steve slowly faced forward and the prosecutor nervously cleared his throat.
“We noticed,” Tony growled.
Natasha scrambled to her feet and glared daggers at him. When he met her angry gaze, she yelled something in Russian. Bucky flinched and looked down, flushing with shame.
Tony knew how Bucky was going to die. He must have known all along. Bucky had been his friend but he let him die.
“I’m trying to get him to start, it’s a great relaxer,” Wade stated from the doorway.
Steve grabbed Tony’s arm and his dad glanced back at the super solider before turning back to Peter and stating at a more controlled level, “I know you are an adult and that who you choose to date is your own business but…but this is Deadpool. He’s a killer.”
“More than fine,” Steve replied before Tony could overthink Steve’s question. Steve even kissed the top of his head for good measure and Tony grinned so widely his cheeks hurt.
They left the bears on the big couch in the living room and Steve threw out the remains of their cotton candy and left their bag of souvenirs on the kitchen counter before turning back to Tony with a dark look in his eyes.
They were in some kind of ratty hotel room. Steve lay on top of a queen sized mattress and Bucky crouched in the corner of the room on an ancient looking desk. All the lights were off and the only source of light came from the single window between him and Bucky.
“You…okay?” He asked awkwardly.
The priest didn’t get a chance to finish what he was saying as Steve pulled him into a hug. He never before felt so blessed until he heard a priest from his very religion say that he was normal despite knowing his once most heinous secret.
An indicator went off, notifying Tony that the transport ship had taken off. Steve would be with him in a few more minutes.
Steve was still staring at his hand and he said,  “I…I just thought – my mate would be a woman…I thought…” Steve didn’t finish his sentence and Tony winced. Alright, this meeting just got ten-times more awkward and worse.
“I’m okay, Uncle Bucky,” Peter whispered to try to calm his uncle.
The feeling was sharp and painful.
Natasha froze upon hearing Peter’s voice.
Wade had lost count of the number of times he’d found himself in her embrace but was forced to leave time and time again because of his mutation. There were times Wade had yearned to see her but, by God, today was not that day.
His eyes focused on his husband, laying on the ground, in a pool of his own blood. Wade was there, breathing shallowly, but applying pressure to the worst of Steve’s wounds. Tony fell out of his suit and put his hands on Steve too.
Steve wordlessly grasped the clasp to Tony’s jeans and then dragged him closer to the edge. Tony laughed as Steve drew him nearer but then he bit down on his lips as Steve bent down and lightly kissed the exposed skin just below his navel.
“We’re not making love in the locker room,” Steve groaned as he got to his feet. He held a hand out to Tony and helped him to his feet and then pulled him back into his arms.
“Mmmmm,” Tony happily hummed as he nestled into Steve’s arms. “Amazing as always.”
“Tonight will be our last night to escape into the forest,” Steve observed in a whisper. They reached the coal container and Tony grabbed the scoop and Steve held out his basket to let him pour the coals in.
The Chitauri swarm over New York like a plague of locus. Steve directed everyone to their places and where they would be most beneficial but, if they don’t get that portal closed, the battle would not end in their favor.
They usually were given boxed rations of dry, unappetizing food, but their cooks raided Hydra's kitchen and had been cooking them up feasts since they found the large kitchen its abundant pantry. Steve's stomach was growling as soon as smelt the first whiff of sweet brown sugar and bacon. Steve picked up his step and Tony instantly moved in step with him and they quickly joined the line for food.
“Stop hogging, Peter, it’s my turn,” Wade whined and squeezed between the press of his parents’ bodies. Steve and Tony laughed as Wade pulled Peter into his arms and properly nuzzled his face into the side of Peter’s neck. Any cold that had lingered in his bones totally disappeared when Wade was able to properly hold him. Peter sank into his arms and Wade whispered to Peter, “Let’s go home…”
Tony’s entire frame jolted and he felt nauseated. His chest ached with a phantom tightness he hadn’t felt in years…ever since he had the reactor removed.
Tony fell silent and after a while Steve felt brave enough to look back up at him. He was still “preparing” their food. He asked Tony, “Then why were you such a douche when we first met?”
Tony turned to his husband, about to argue the fact that Peter was with Deadpool, but stopped himself. Steve didn't know he had Friday keeping tabs on Peter. He had even pushed for Tony to let Peter have his space…but, with all Peter was going through, and now with Deadpool in the mix, how was he supposed to not be involved??
“But once the judge hears our testimony, he’ll have to admit the prosecution is in the wrong!” Tony interceded angrily.
They left the sewer without incident. According to Venom they had hibernated for a few days as they bonded. So the streets were no longer crawling with SHIELD agents and the populace was back –
Tony was using every ounce of mental strength not to take a drink, not even a single shot of liquid courage. Tony knew where exactly in the lab where his hidden alcohol was and the knowledge burned into him like an old Scottish whiskey. Despite his dry mouth and tight throat, Tony was not going to inhibit himself in any way.
Wade spared no time and lifted his hand to his ear and stated, “
“They’re the best,” Tony replied.
“Why do you even want to be with me?” Tony asked suddenly. His voice was louder and filled with hurt. “Why do you want me? I’m almost twenty years older than you. Bucky is near your age…you grew up with him and you have said time and time again that he is your best friend…hell, he’s even a super soldier, so why? Why me? Why not him? You love him too, don’t you?”
Wade smiled wobbly at him and threw himself at Peter. Peter was still sitting on a lab stool so he was much shorter than usual therefore Wade’s arm went around Peter’s head and Peter buried his face into Wade’s stomach.
For the last week, he had been meeting with Marcel and his team, going over the testimony and evidence. Steve knew exactly what to say and how to react to any question the prosecution threw at him. But he also knew he would not be testifying today and he anxiously wanted to get it over with.
Wade leaned into the kiss Peter was initiating and he swore to himself that he’d love Peter with his entire soul.
Wanda nodded and stepped forward. Vision went to follow but Wade grabbed the corner of his cape and whispered, “Take me with you.”
But first he needed to drop his tail.
This will mostly be Howard's POV and will take us from the day after Steve's death to his own death! And then we are back in the future...and, well, things are going to turn out a little differently...
Tony shook his head and murmured, “He wasn’t even there for it…not that I noticed, at that point in my life I stopped caring what my dad did in his free time…He wasn’t really there for me…”
Tony had been his best friend for years and he helped keep him together first after he woke, then after the Winter Soldier-Hydra fiasco, and then again with Peter. They had been best friends for years and Steve had been attracted to him for months and they had already dated for a few weeks but their compatibility was so great that Steve knew they were meant to be...
“Yes! Bruce! This is Peter and Peter this is Dr. Bruce Banner,” Tony gasped excitedly, glad to have something to say.
Steve went to the kitchen and straight to the pantry. He pulled the Animal Crackers from their usual spot and returned to Peter. Peter sat on the blanket and was trying to get the action figure to sit too.
“…Sir, is there anything I can do?”
He could feel the nanorobots crawling frantically around the skin of his neck, but the metal seemed impervious to their onslaught.
Before Steve could ask if Tony suspected Sam, Tony dove sharply so they would be less likely to be noticed and landed them on the hospital’s roof.
Steve shook his hand and replied, “And I’m Steve Rogers. Nice to meet you, Mr. Solo.”
Steve shot away from Tony laughed as Steve scrambled to save their lunch and his title as grill king.
In his mind’s eye, Steve saw Tony disappear into the void with the nuclear missile and he drew his gaze away from the broken window and back to his fiancé. If Tony hadn’t been there, New York would have been destroyed.
Steve felt like the entire world was beginning to skew. First Bucky and now this monster? His mouth dropped open and he gasped with horror, “
“You’re an egomaniac,” Steve groaned.
Marcel looked at the photo with a perplexed expression and murmured, “That’s an odd place for such a stain…”
“Two minutes, Tony!” Pepper called after them.
Tony stayed in his friend’s hold. He took comfort from it but, mostly, he stayed in it because he was too dazed to move.
“Everything alright in there, soldier?”
Tony pushed up his welding goggles so he could see Steve more easily. He knew it looked bad. He was currently testing his anti-gravity boots to see how long he could stay on the ceiling with them but he grew bored so he took it as a perfect opportunity to do some work on the Hulkbuster suit from a different angle. Tony was welding upside-down which many would probably regard as insane but those foold just couldn’t comprehend his level on genius.
“And when we do, we will justly avenge the great Jarvis!” Thor promised, stabbing in steak knife into the table and drawing a grin from Tony.
Natasha sighed heavily and sat beside him on the couch. He silently leaned into her side and counted it as a minor victory when she didn’t push him away. She stated, “You understand how much more dangerous this is? What if you’re an American sleeper agent? What if the Academy finds out? They’ll send their top assassins to kill us both.”
Steve's heart fluttered as he remembered Tony's gentle fingers over his heart in the same place.
It was the same photograph he and Tony had looked at an hour earlier of their future wedding. It was different though. The bottom half of Tony's body had disappeared and, as he watched, the fading slowly encroached up, eating away more of Tony.
“This boy is not Dr. Banner’s son, sir,” Steve gasped. He cautiously raised his hands, his right side throbbed as he lifted the bullet ridden limb. He pushed himself up to his knees with his arms still held up in compliance. “He is
He could already picture Cable’s frown deepening further with Tony’s appearance at the apartment and his glare burning two parallel holes into Steve.
Someone snorted off screen, it sounded like Scott. Steve rolled his eyes and murmured something under his breath.
“The precognition?”
It looked like there were a few pictures from last night taken of them without their knowing and Steve commented to Tony, “You were right about people noticing you.”
It was a relief but also strange. At first, he didn’t know how to spend that time so he started to devote more time to growing his empire…and then being with his family.
Wade snorted and replied, “I think Peter Parker has been surprised by one too many times and if a super villain tries this again, he or she will be very surprised when Tony Stark’s supposedly normal son turned out to be a little stronger than most.”
Steve grabbed his hand as he was withdrawing it then slowly brought it up to his lips and closed his eyes as lightly kissed the center of Tony’s palm. He opened his eyes with Tony’s hand still connected to his mouth and Tony trembled under the heat of the other man’s gaze.
Wade nodded and Peter’s face became quite serious. Wade would have teased him if he weren’t teetering on the edge of orgasm.
“I know but another smart option would be to leave and go back to our normal routines,” Tony tried to rationalize.
“Thank God,” Steve murmured. If he was going to escape SHIELD medical he would like to do it in some pants. Steve and Clint were notorious for slipping out against the doctors’ orders. After Clint scaled down the side of the building, with his lower half for all to see and ended up the front page story for the next month, SHIELD started making the sweats standard issue whenever one of them was hospitalized.
“That you are, my boy,” Ben said, lightly pinching Peter’s cheek. Peter giggled under the touch and smiled bashfully at his godfather.
“Thank you, again, Father,” Steve tightly whispered.
“You two scared the Devil out of me I thought you were dead!” Tony gasped indignantly. He glared down at Steve and said, “And you! That’s twice
“It just took our wedding to do it,” Steve observed with a fond smile directed to the other couple.
“No wait…
“One step away from passion,” Tony said, waving his words away with a twitch of his hand. He continued, “Maybe I can help Barnes do more than be friendly with her, maybe I can set them up.”
If it was not safe his Spidey-sense would have gone off.
“H-Hey,” Peter squeaked. Tony Stark, his idol, was standing at his front door and Peter was in his Hulk boxers. He felt a red blush of mortification stain his cheeks and he asked, “Wh-What are you two doing here?”
They went into the neighboring library and she let him go with a shove which he stumbled from. He adjusted his collar and glared at her.
The toddler years seemed to have passed in the blink of an eye and grew skinny child with gangly limbs and a fierce intelligence.
“Both of you?” Tony gasped, his eyes shooting to Bucky.
What he didn’t see, were Eddie’s fingers.
Tony just found Steve. After all of these years of searching and waiting, he finally had his mate. They just indirectly told each other they loved each other
Wade placed a finger over Peter's lips and said, “Say no more.” Peter leaned into his touch and Wade moved his hand so he was cupping his face. He traced Peter’s cheek with his thumb and Wade promised, “I know you'll be amazing. You're Spider-Man! You can't be anything less! What you've done to me already has made me nearly blow my load!!”
Mary entered cautiously. She opened the door slowly and regarded the men before her with a steady stare. She was tense with square shoulders and her mouth was clenched in a hard, thin line.
“I love you too, dad.”
“You got to be kidding me,” Tony replied. “Jarvis hooked me up with photos from your graduation. I saw you with that blonde, you were all over her! What’s her name? Who is she?”
Little did he know, it was
“You had me worried there for a bit,” Wade admitted.
“You used it on me last week to win at poker,” Bucky stated and poked at the hot dogs.
As Peter took a hot shower, Wade went onto Peter’s tablet and pulled up the storage app where he and Peter saved all their photos. He swiped through them and each photo drew him back in time as he remembered each instance. There were birthdays, holidays, or just lazy days.
the country’s capital of all places!
Stark!
The only thing he was
Cable nodded and adjusted his hold on the Captain and stepped through the SHIELD agents, who parted for him like the tide.
“Peter?” His uncle called out to him, finally noticing him gone. “Where are you?”
Peter closed his mouth and stared grimly down at his coffee cup.
“What we wanted cannot be measured by a simple question,” Coulson stated.
He couldn’t think of any other reason for Tony to feel so shamed.
There was a long pause as the robot regarded his question. He and Bucky traded glances. What was the machine contemplating?
The alarms and red coded messages were gone in an instant and he could think a little clearer.  Steve’s voice, though, remained.
“Mr. Stark?” Coulson answered his phone on the second ring.
Within the next dream, Tony was laying down again but was bandaged. The world around them was dark and undefined but it was not the same frightening blackness that had been threatening them earlier.
He’d always choose her.
“Friday, has it shown the ability to speak before?” Bruce asked the AI, furiously turning through his notes.
Bucky moaned into his mouth, the sound vibrating down Steve’s throat. Bucky pushed him back and they landed on the bed with a slight bounce. Bucky rubbed his hips into Steve, pressing the forming erection into him.
“Sorry!” Wade squeaked.
Steve bent down and lightly kissed him. When he pulled away, Tony’s eyes flickered back open and he smiled warmly at his husband. Tony asked, “So, what are you going to do?”
“And everyone is not going to say another word,” Tony interrupted Bruce.
“Most are,” Tony replied with a shrug. He sat up and said, “But it’s all in the past…well, future... or my past which has yet to occur, because ‘Hello, Space Time Continuum!’”
Wade followed him closely behind and Peter grasped his hand as soon as they were outside.
Tony clenched his fists wanting with all of his heart to pull Steve back to him and assure him they would all be alright.
“…He makes me happy and I know he’s different, and I like that…whenever I’m with him I feel just so relaxed and happy…I haven’t felt that since Gwen.”
“He’s my soulmate, obviously,” Tony would reply for him and they’d move on, both smothering chuckles at the reporters’ expense.
Peter was still asleep. Steve leaned over him, touching his belly lightly as he did. He watched him sleep and loved the sound his light exhalations. He leaned down and kissed his son’s tiny hand, the side of his soft cheek, and the tip of his button nose. He did it lightly enough that Peter slept through it all, drawing another smile to Steve’s lips.
But Bucky wouldn't truly live without knowing he had at least tried.
It was immediately disconcerting.
“There he is,” Steve sighed and Bucky rolled up the map with a knowing smirk.
The events of the day were horrible but, with the adoption, he felt prized and loved. So he was surprisingly in a good mood when he swung up to the roof.
Natasha directed Thor to take James to her room and, surprisingly, her teammates did not kick up any kind of fuss. Maybe they were too tired to object or maybe they felt less worried about James since he broke through some of his brainwashing. Either way, he was not going back to that room that was no bigger than a closet.
“Front of the dress, bottom left corner, right above the blue rose,” the man retorted.
Steve pulled back and smiled gratefully at Bucky. He stated, “As long as you’re with me, Bucky. I will be just fine.”
James froze and all that he was emptied out of his mind and was trapped behind a dark curtain as the machine that was the Winter Soldier stepped into him.
Wade slumped over Peter’s back and playfully suggested, “Maybe we went a little crazy last night…”
They shared an awkward silence as they stared at each other, both wondering how to interact with the other. Peter darkly wondered if Harry feared him now. Had he looked online at all the articles and reports about Venom? Venom was reported as a demon from Hell. The monster was vilified as being one of the worst as it was responsible for a number of deaths, Pops included…
The battle had put him in a foul mood. Steve gritted his teeth and snapped, “I can walk.”
Peering at his feet, Peter stated, “T-That guy…The one the media was calling the Goblin. He was my friend and he – Harry, blamed me for what he became and…it is my fault. My blood did that to him. But anyways, he realized I was Spider-Man and he wanted to get revenge. Harry took Gwen to the top of a clock tower and was going to drop her…” Peter paused, his throat became too tight. He had never voiced this aloud. He had always grieved for Gwen alone. Tony came up to him and gently placed his hand on Peter’s back. He flinched but then leaned into his touch. He whispered, “I caught her and placed her on the walkway and then fought with Harry. Harry’s glider broke away from him and crashed into the walkway. It broke and she fell…”
When Steve took the lead back to base, Tony followed him close behind and then stared at Steve as if he was seeing him for the first time.
There was no doubt between them that they loved each other but Wade wasn’t sure he was ready to share that with the world.
“We could tell how happy you were to see us by the way you attacked Stark’s mouth,” Natasha commented dryly. Tony threw back his head and laughed but Steve felt his face turn bright red.
Steve looked over his shoulder to glare at the man in his bed. He repeated, “I am
“Jarvis,” Natasha hissed when the elevator did not automatically open. “Open the door.”
That was right…This would be the first time his life as ‘ordinary’ Peter Parker and ‘Tony’s son’ Peter Parker would converge. The last couple of birthdays he had, he had hung out with his friends and then hung out with the Avengers separately…but, now he can do it all at once.
His heart seized in his chest as he realized what he let slip.
“Sir, Agent Coulson of SHIELD is on the line. He wishes to see you.”
He rubbed his hardening desire into Tony’s abdomen and his husband groaned into his mouth. Steve reached down, picked Tony up, and deposited him on the counter. Tony busily ripped at Steve’s clothing, his lust, driven by intoxication, seemingly erased from his mind whatever he was going to ask Steve.
with Steve, Tony decided to take a risk: he would drink at the Tower with Steve in the building. He held off on drinking all day and spent all his time with Steve. By the end of the night, Tony slipped away and told Steve to go to bed without him. Steve did but told him to not spend all night in the lab.
Steve’s heart contracted painfully as he remained tightlipped.
Pointing at the knives, Peter teased, “Are you angry about the laundry or are you just happy to see me?”
Peter fidgeted with his papers and then he glanced at his friend warily and murmured, “…Hi.”
Fury turned back to Stark and said, “Alright, I won’t arrest you for being a suspected terrorist.”
Peter hurried over to the station where their supervisors kept the interns' files and pretended he didn’t notice everyone watching his every move. He picked up his files and, as he thumbed through the reports, the whispers started.
-!” Tony hissed in warning as the Winter Soldier took a step forward to put himself between Tony and Fury.
Steve wasn't sure if he or Tony did it, but their clothes were willed away and in an instant their bodies were naked. They both moaned and Tony's hands were quick to run down Steve's back and cup his behind. Tony murmured something in an appreciative voice and Steve flushed again.
His worried voice drew her eyes. She looked from James’ blank face, to Bruce’s pinched face, and then to Tony, whose hands were working quickly on the monitors in front of him and they looked nothing like blueprints. She intoned disapprovingly, “
“I want to fix my camera. I figure I swing over to the nearest lens repair shop, pop in and then pop out,” Peter stated.
“Sue me. I just survived a bad fight where I almost lost one of my best friends
The communal room had transformed overnight. The floor was covered in bright balloons, speakers were set up in all corners of the room promising loud music, the bar was lit up and flashy like a bar at a popular Vegas club, and there was so much food that Peter even doubted the team members with legendary metabolisms could finish it all.
Venom cocked his head to the side upon hearing his voice. It then threw itself at the nearest wall with a screech, hitting the wall with a loud thud.
Grinning, Steve pressed his forehead to Tony’s and whispered, “I am head-over-heels wooed.” He kissed Tony and let his mouth show Tony how enamored he was with him as his tongue found its way into the other's mouth. The hands on Steve’s neck suddenly dug into his flesh and Tony moaned encouragingly.
Natasha watched their landing on the top balcony to Stark’s tower and kept an eye on the two men until they disappeared into the building.
-ed, oh God, don't –
,” Steve gasped in disbelief.
“You’re so amazing,” Peter laughed with him. He kissed Wade as his boyfriend gasped for breath, making their kiss as Wade needed to catch his breath.
The couple shared one of those looks now. They lost the masks of the unfeeling assassins and unbridled warmth flowed between their eyes. Steve smiled sweetly at his friends. Bucky had come to the tower with only Steve as his anchor to his sanity but now he had Natasha for an anchor. No, she was stronger than an anchor that could be moved at the tug of a chain. She was more permanent like a firmly built beam at the center of a bridge, standing immobile and tall while being supported by cables, girders, arches, concrete, steel, and such. Nothing would move her from his side.
The smile stretching Steve’s lips lessened slightly.
His dad’s cheeks were flushed with emotion and he opened his mouth to retort but Steve grasped his arm and stepped between him and Peter.
Steve felt more blood rushing to his face and it doubled when he saw Clint’s jaw drop.
“What does Sam have to do with this?”
Steve stared at him wide-eyed and his mouth slightly agape. Tony suddenly took a step back and reevaluated what he just said and revealed. Some of what he spewed may have been a personal fantasy of his, dreaming that the reason Steve didn’t date was because of old 1940s fears…but, for all he knew, Steve himself might still hold onto those homophobic tendencies from his era.
“Do me a favor and give me a head start,” Peter asked and then jumped off the side of the tower.
“Yeah, Tony and I had breakfast.”
“Because it’s fun,” Wade retorted, swaying lightly. Peter moved with him and lay his head right under Wade’s neck. Wade tucked his chin right over it and inhaled the faint scent of shampoo from Peter’s hair. For a few passing moments, they simply swayed like a pendulum of a clock, and Wade imagined that time slowed down just for them.
Tony sat next to him and tightly clutched his hand. Guilt bubbled in Steve’s stomach. If Tony knew what he had done with Bucky…
Steve dug his fingers into Tony’s back but returned the kiss in the same relaxed manner.
His only consolation was that the Soldier had survived his gun shot and she thought her mate was dead. He had heard living on without one’s mate was a fate worse than death and he hoped she enjoyed living the torture.
Tony walked forward and Pepper wildly grabbed him, hissing, “
Who was Tony kidding? Steve knew there could be nothing between them. He just wanted to enjoy the night with a friend, nothing more. Tony was overreacting to these new feelings inside him and the fact that Steve liked him too. He needed to keep a cool head. The worst that could happen would for them to talk about their feelings and acknowledge they were both being ridiculous…
“Is that a yes?” Tony wrapped his hand around the head of Steve’s cock and lightly nipped at the base.
Without pausing to think about it, Steve dropped his head close to Tony’s, so their faces were inches apart, and whispered, “Do you still feel sick?”
Tony was true to his word and returned to his workshop. He went straight to work on Bucky’s new arm, wanting to give him back full mobility as soon as possible. He started straight from scratch, grabbing materials that originally would have been used in the Mark 19. He tried to keep it close to the original design however to make it easier for Bucky to move and to be less distracting to him. He must have been used to the arm by now and any major changes would be disconcerting. Tony wanted to make everything perfect for Bucky so he put his entire concentration into his work.
Steve was practically crying.
But Obadiah did no such thing.
Peter choked on a chuckle and Wade smiled jovially at him.
Peter’s hands tightened on Wade and he gasped to his father in a pleading voice, “
I was a virgin!”
(See the end of the chapter for
Peter led them deeper into the house and it changed from a family home to an active facility. He took them to a locker room and Steve asked, “Is this our home or a command center?”
Rogers smiled sadly at him and said, “We haven’t even properly introduced ourselves to each other and you’re doing this for me?”
“Thank you,” Steve said as they both selected a badge.
“Come here often?” Tony joked with a crooked and most definitely flirty grin.
Tony leaned heavily on the edge of Steve’s bed during the short exchange and stared at Steve’s unchanging expression. He was waiting for a reaction but nothing was happening…
Tony thought his interview with
“I actually wanted to make an announcement,” Steve stated and his heartrate picked up.
Tony snickered and whispered, “You know you’ll love it.”
Tony was usually inapt in mentioning it, but his father was a technological genius along with being an asshole. The man was coming up with inventions and elements so advanced that the technology of his era was too slow to keep up. Tony was like a sponge and only wanted to learn
He had a Google alert set up for any pings about him or Tony Stark all night but nothing was posted online either.
“More than that,” Peter replied. His gaze rose and that glow Wade had seen last night was there again. Peter cupped his face and whispered, “I’ve never been happier than I am right now, with
Steve shook his head and said, “I want to…You can’t imagine how badly I want to…” Steve reached out to him, as if to touch him, but he pulled back at the last second and continued, “But we can’t…you said it yourself, even the littlest of things can change the future. I do not want to change the future you laid out to me.”
Around them, the white steam from the hot water hid them from the outside world. It was just Wade and Peter there.
“We’re decent,” his father informed him as he went past the spot where they were located.
Steve was thrust violently into the dreamscape as he had been before and he immediately expected the worst.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony picked his face off Steve’s chest and squinted open his eyes to glare at Steve. He groaned, “I will never get used to this ungodly hour. The Army is Hell. Pure and simple.”
He inhaled the cold air in deep, hyperventilating breaths. It was the middle of the night and the cemetery was devoid of any other living beings. Steve was still buried waist deep but he fell forward, still gasping for breath, but unable to hold himself up anymore.
“Then it must only activate when the danger is inevitable. I may not be able to see it in my scans unless he is in danger,” Bruce said somewhat dejectedly.
Tony grinned and he wanted to hug Peter for calling him dad but held himself back. He could always hug his son tonight when he stopped by and later when he left. He had a lifetime with him and he was grateful for every precious second.
model.
Steve had been outfitted with a mouth guard and a machine that covered his head and half his face. He was breathing shallowly, trying to shake his head away, and was pulling at his bonds.
One of Peter’s eyebrows pricked up and he asked, “And how will we go about doing that?”
“I think I was quite courteous,” Tony retorted.
He fell back onto his bed, staring at the number. His heart was beating wildly in his chest and considering what Wade wanted made him feel enthusiastic and wary…but an excited wary, like what one felt when you were about to board a rollercoaster.
“And I do not want to relive that part of my past,” Natasha stated, jumping off the beam. She did not meet Steve’s eyes as she strolled past him.
Tony frowned. After their last encounter, Steven made it very clear their association had been a coincidence and he did not want to continue it but…but Tony may need to butt into his life once more to answer these lingering questions and assuage his nagging uncertainties.
Tony bought them a bunch of tokens and then they were off. He showed Steve the simplicity of the machines and they were playing in no time. They hopped around the arcade, sometimes playing together to beat the boss, or beside each other on single player games, or against each other, shouting taunts at the other as they played. They had so many tickets in the end that they could’ve gotten anything. They paused by the prizes and both of them zeroed in one item in particular and then looked at each other.
That drew a small smile to Steve’s face and Tony continued, “Now, now, that smile is not big enough. Where is that pearly white smile that puts the white stripes of the American flag to shame?”
“Are you sure?” Steve whispered, cupping his cheek. Their exchange was a long enough that Steve had to pause to make sure this was fine.
He remained standing in his spot, waiting for Steve to tell him off or start the awkward conversation about wanting to be just friends. Tony was practically vibrating from the tension.
That was why their encounters left Tony feeling confused and out of place. Steven’s tone had always been…been of someone who cared? Was he connecting this right?
“Lana’s never going to date me now,” Tony lamented.
I've been wanting to draw at least one picture for this series and I'm finally getting one out with the last chapter! But the chapter won't display the picture so, if you want to see it, here's a
Cable frowned deeply at the question and then murmured, “You want us to go out and…
Most wanted to know from Steve: “
“I'm excited,” Wade replied.
Barton frowned deeply but nodded and left, closing the door behind him.
He took down four before he finally reached the last two and broke their necks in unison.
Tony sighed heavily and dropped his blankets.
“Norman, killing Stark would do more than solve your problems,” Fury cautioned. “He’s done a lot for the world. Remember the fall of Hydra? The Chitauri? Ultron? Thanos? None of those victories could have been accomplished without him. Think of the fate of the Earth or, at least, think of your own son. What if he doesn’t survive? In any of those instances, he could have died if it were not for Stark and the Avengers.”
When they came again, their bodies were slick with sweat and other substances but they curled into each other with happy sighs.
It's about 1,000 more words with some valuable info!
He mixed in the egg and his mate watched with a horrified expression.
Steve expected an ambush, even booby-traps. He was tense and battle ready. Everything was so quiet and his heart was hammering so loudly in his ears that it seemed as if it was drowning out all other sound.
He was recognized in seconds but Steve did not notice. Internally, he was wagering a war with Venom inside his head.
Peter shook his head again and said, “I need to take a shower.”
Peter’s face lit up and he excitedly gasped, “Yah!”
Steve chuckled wetly and then pressed his head in James’ chest, gasping, “Please be real.”
Turning to Eddie with his excitement mounting, he stated, “It could be anything!!”
They were running to the church van before the man could get out another word and this time Father Michael jumped into the driver’s seat. The van’s engine roared loudly and continued to hum with it’s age as they drove out of there.
