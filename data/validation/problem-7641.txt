to the wall with ten tons hanging off of you, but at what point does your arm rip from your body?” male Tony mused at one point.
“No,” said Bruce, who clenched and unclenched his fists and breathed deeply. Steve found it a testament to the nanite technology that, despite the close quarters, despite the fact that his own children were in the room, 3490 Steve looked entirely unconcerned with Bruce’s state.
Peter had attended a lot of funerals in his short life. Most of the time, they were for people he’d never met before—soldiers who had died in battle and his father and family had been invited to come and maybe say a few words, foreign dignitaries his mother had known through philanthropic work, members of the fifty state initiative he’d never actually seen or spoken with. Both sets of his grandparents had been long dead by the time he’d been born. In fact, the only funeral Peter could recall with clarity that was for someone he had actually known (if only a little), had been that for Scott Lang, the Ant Man. Peter hadn’t known the man well, though. He had never lived at the manor. He’d known Cassy, though, and he could remember seeing her at the funeral with her mother, dressed head to toe in black, an all-too-solemn expression on her eight year old face.
“Does that make it ok? Does that make it better?” Peter asked listlessly.
“Do you trust me or not?” James shouted into the comms. “Eighty-three more seconds—HOLD.”
. It was a low blow and it was somewhat unfounded and Tony was beyond hurt—she was

? I married him because I love him. Is that really so hard to believe?” Antonella asked. Her last words were soft, laced with concern, and Tony felt his gut twist. He knew pity when he heard it. Antonella left the room before Tony could think of anything else to say.
,” Kate yelled as Jeanne slowly approached her again. Kate got to her feet.
“Woah, easy, we’re not breaking the kid’s bones to see how fast they heal or anything,” Tony said. “We’ve been doing surface tests, for one thing. He sticks to glass.” Bruce whipped around to look at Peter.
For the rest, if you have anything you want to know, anything you are still curious about, please leave a comment with your questions. I may write an epilogue, or a separate collection of ficlets to address these things. No guarantees.
“Well, it’s about time,” Fury, seated casually on an old swivel chair, stated as they walked in. It had taken some time to find the secret room, even with 199999 Fury’s tips.
“Don’t you?”
“That’s bullshit, Kate,” Peter said flatly.
. She steeled herself and fought the panic slowly rising.
. This was real, and Tony was safe, and alive, and home.
“Does that ever help?” James asked. He had to wonder. For all that he’d witnessed over the years, he’d never had someone so close to him die before. Did the closure of a funeral ease any of this?
“Most?” Steve asked.
He’d wanted them to both have a chance to experiment with other people because he felt what she felt too. That the two of them, that Francis-and-Kate, was a packaged deal. That they were forever. They were the Real Deal. They’d just found each other so early—he wanted to make sure that they were both

“I swear you do a remarkable impression of Tony circa 1994,” Steve stated. He sipped his coffee and flipped to the next document on his tablet. Mutants robbed a convenience store in Queens—well that was no surprise. It had been handled. Energy spikes coming from various areas in D.C., no known culprit…He’d have to put Bruce on that one, see what was going—
“But that was Tony. Always thinking of everyone else first. Even in death, she couldn’t let that part of her go. And she—she didn’t always see it, Tony. She didn’t always see how much she gave. I know that for most of the public, to suggest that Tony often didn’t think of herself as a hero would sound absurd. She wasn’t exactly known for humility. But Tony often didn’t think of herself as a hero. She could get blind to it, to how remarkable she truly was.
believe that of you, and I’m having trouble believing it now. How could you
“I like these too.” Steve was startled as 3490 Tony took a seat on the bench next to him. It took him several moments before he even realized what she was talking about. Her gaze was on the shrub directly in front of them. It still had pretty pink flowers, despite the temperature.
“Evening, Mr. Stark,” the driver replied.
“What question was that, ma’am?” Steve asked, legitimately puzzled.
Things had been quiet on their end for a grand total of five days. For five miserable days after James returned to the bunker, they had run through drills and sulked and sat in mind-numbing boredom. Kate wished desperately that she could go back to school, that she could hang out with her friends and play her cello and run the French club. This? Well, this wasn’t exactly Kate’s definition of
“Kate,” Francis said. His voice was full of remorse.
“Permission to speak, sir?” James interrupted. His cheeks were tinged red. Steve gestured his acquiescence. “I requested the posting, sir.”
“Uh, Steve—could we maybe talk in another room for a minute?” Tony asked. “It’s important.” 3490 Steve frowned but nodded.
“It can wait,” Steve insisted. “Get some rest, Tony.” She made a small noise of protest but did not speak again, and minutes later she was sleeping.
Oh, God—what had he put his children in the middle of? Steve got up from the chair quickly, Natasha following again.
“I’ll continue to be an agent of the Secret Service. I’ll continue to be on your guard, if I can be. But heading things up—that’s Fury’s division,” Steve said. Tony seemed satisfied by that answer, so Steve left it at that. “You’re really sure you’ll get elected?”

“Hey Uncle Bruce,” Peter said, giving him an upside down wave. “So uh. I got bit by a genetically altered possibly radioactive spider and now we’re doing science. Sound fun?”
“It…relaxes me,” he said wryly. Kate laughed.
“Y-yes, ma’am,” Peter mumbled.
Being stripped of command, Steve wondered, or the unraveling? Because, if he still had the capacity to really feel, he would probably be afraid that both of those things would be far less temporary than Bucky promised.
to be right here, still swinging that shield while you’re flying that tin can, telling kids to get off my lawn,” Steve said.
“Yes, sweetheart, bad people,” Jane said hurriedly. They were almost out of the house. James walked quickly at the head of the pack; Jane was behind them all, keeping an eye out. Her eyes darted everywhere. James had never seen her scared before, but he could tell that she was now. James opened up the sliding glass door that led to the garden.
“It’s a goatee, kid,” Tony corrected. Peter just grinned.
Silence.
. That’s the whole reason we wanted you all to
“What?” Peter asked.
“Thank you. For telling me,” he said.
“Ok,” Kate replied quietly. “But not here.” Francis visibly perked up at her ascent, a cautiously hopeful expression settling on his features instead of the clear misery that had been there moments before. Well, Kate would take it. She got up from the armchair and led the way back through the facility to her room. She shared it with Torrun, but fortunately the half Asgardian was still in the living area. Kate shut the door behind them, took a breath and folded her arms. She turned to face Francis, who looked at her with an open, vulnerable expression. Kate steeled herself. “All right. Let’s get it over with. Say what you want to say.”
? Kate just gave him a sardonic look in response to his gob smacked expression. “Oh, come on, like everyone doesn’t see you staring after her with little lost puppy dog eyes. So you’re probably already in love with her or halfway there and my advice is worth shit, but seriously. Don’t fall in love with her. There’s no way that ends well for you. I mean, she’s probably one of the very few women who doesn’t actually exist in your universe. Well, she does, but she’s got a dick. And maybe a thing with Pepper? I can’t tell. Which I think is the weirdest part in all of this whole alternate universe thing because I can’t imagine how Pepper could possibly stand Mom both at work and at home. I mean Dad manages but that’s because he’s a saint and also because they speak in the language of bickering anyway, but I don’t know how poor sweet
,” Tony said, following after him. “Pinch me, I think I may faint.”
“I think…I think he’d rather hear it from you than anyone else, Tony,” Steve said. His thumb was moving in soothing circles again, and Tony never wanted him to stop.
Peter sighed in relief when he finally reached the door to the basement—he felt like he’d been walking forever. He opened it up, then headed straight up the stairs to the overhead hatch. He shoved it open and heard it hit the other side of the floor with a dramatic clatter as he stepped up. It took him less than a single second—
“’Course I do, Agent Giggles. I’ve also got another place here in New York, a place in D.C., a place in Malibu, and a place in Dubai,” Senator Stark said, looking amused.
“Then you should have let
“I’m sorry,” Tony said, adding in the signs for the words. “I’m distracted. Natasha’s in Albania with Bucky, I can’t send her. What’s the situation with the alts?”
“I doubt vegetarians much like burgers,” Steve interjected as the elevator door opened. He and Tony walked through together.

“No, it’s a statement of fact. You are an

Touchable holographs—they’re just thin air until they come into contact with…well, it doesn’t matter how it works, point is, this is as close to a magic shield as you’re ever going to get. Unless you talk to Thor in which case I’ll be highly insulted,” Tony said. James just blinked, still uncomprehending. “It’s an energy shield. It can also expand, see?” Tony moved her finger on the smooth blue surface, and the shield grew in size. “Or contract. And if you press this here—“ Tony pressed some invisible button that James could not see, “—then you can actually pick it up and toss it. It won’t stay ‘live’ for long though—it’ll disappear after about two minutes, tops, without the control panel. This is not

“Good for the Joes.”
“Who do you think? Pepper,” Steve said. “She was telling me a while back about needing to organize Christmas presents—I thought she was a bit crazy, it was September after all—and she was going through a list and mentioned that you’d probably want to get Harley’s present together yourself. I asked who he was. She didn’t keep him from me.”
“You should learn karate,” Tony said. “It only takes one 80s training montage and then boom, you’re a black belt.” Peter just looked at him, then nodded, his eyebrows raised.
“Didn’t want to go to private school—tried that once, really hated it—didn’t want to go to nimma,” Peter said by way of explanation.
“If you’d prefer a pyre and cremation,” Steve ground out as he absorbed three more blows with his shield, “we can arrange that.” He noticed, out of the corner of his eye, Iron Man bust into the hall through the window, swooping in to scoop up Clint and Kate with Natasha hopping on back, before flying back through it. Good—three less things to worry about.
“God, I really hope you’re not evil,” Kate said wearily. “Follow me.”
“525,” Steve said, knowing he spoke for the whole group. “What happened with 525?” Steve looked around at the faces of the children still in the room. “Go. To bed. To the gym. Just go.” Slowly, reluctantly, all of the children dispersed, save James. Commander Rogers locked eyes with him. “You were included in that.” James folded his arms.
“I still don’t understand why you sent strippers to my room,” Steve said.
“That’s not the
“How was I supposed to
“Right,” he said, and he was about to head back in the other direction when he realized something. His eyebrows knit together. “What are you doing here, anyway? Hanging out outside the lab for no discernible reason?” Steve let out a deep, throaty chuckle.
“Mmph,” was the only reply Tony could manage as he finally got his breath back. He tried to lift himself up—Steve grabbed onto him, helping him get into the same squatting position behind Steve’s shield. The other Avengers, he could see, had scattered, taking shelter where they could. His double stood in the middle of the street. She wasn’t yelling at

“Very well in fact I’ve been told,” Steve called after him. Peter shrieked and clapped his hands over his ears. The deep blush on Steve’s 199999 counterpart did not escape his notice, either, nor did the raised eyebrows of 199999 Tony as he determinedly stared at his tablet.

, to memorize every curve of his lean, muscular body, to drink him in the way Tony drank in bourbon.
“The science?” Tony asked. He looked disturbed. Dr. Richards coughed.
, Steve recalled a little seven-year-old Kate telling him quite primly, quoting from the Harry Potter books. He and Tony had been trying to avoid using the word “sex” around her and Peter. Kate hadn’t quite known what they were avoiding but she’d caught on that there was something they weren’t saying. Tony had laughed her ass off.
“I will.
“Today,” 3490 Tony said. “Today is a
“It was years ago—but it was my fault. I should have known. Should have had a better grip on my company. Shouldn’t have been making weapons in the first place. That’s why I switched to the green movement, to clean energy, because I saw what happens when those weapons end up in the wrong hands,” Tony took a long drink of the coffee. He set it down and poured another mug, handed it to Steve. “And now, years later, other people are still paying for my sins.”
“Who?
“Me, too!”
compromised. I’m invoking protocol 53. You have to be taken off command Steve—this isn’t—this isn’t good for you.”
“No bugs?” Steve asked.
“Chill,” she said. “There was no overstepping of bounds.” She finished tightening a screw and then looked back up at him. He felt frozen, unsure of whether or not to just go. “You know if this were your permanent universe I would just tell you to get out more and go date people. Actually that’s not true. If this were your permanent universe, I would tell Clint to take you to a strip club and then out clubbing and systematically desensitize you to the twenty-first century so you might be encouraged to start dating or even just engage in some casual hook ups to get your mind off things. Sadly, this is not your permanent universe and knowing your luck, you’d fall madly in love with some woman here and then get dramatically ripped away and for some reason be unable to return on pain of the collapse of the multiverse or something.” She sighed deeply. There was pain in her eyes. “I can’t help you, Steve. And that kills me, it really does, but I can’t help you. So I’m going to give you the best advice I possibly can, and please, don’t take this the wrong way.” She paused, and in her focused gaze there was enormous pain. “But stay away from me.”
,” Jane said quickly, putting Peter on the ground and taking Kate from James. “Shush, honey, it’s going to be all right, I promise. Shh.” James’ heart was pounding. If the bad men showed up, Kate would give them all away. He had to do something.
It wasn’t that she didn’t
not winning any points with me, extending my grounding like this.”
“Oh no, I knew she was crazy from the start, that’s why I picked her,” Tony assured him. “Crazy in life, crazy in the sack—but the ABBA antics were a bit much. Kristi! Her name was Kristi. Kristi with a ‘k’.” The two of them just laughed for a moment. Their children had long since left. The only ones left in the kitchen were them, Steve, and—well, Steve looked around. No one else was left. It was just him. He started to slink out, embarrassed. He hadn’t meant to be intruding.
“I can’t make up for any of the times, now, when I forgot to remind Tony of how incredible she was, how heroic, and how much we all loved and cherished her. But um, this is—this is a time when I can at least remind all of us here of all of those things. There are, um, there are little booklets and pens in front of you; I would ask that everyone here, if you have a favorite memory of Tony that you write it down and we’ll… we’ll gather all of those together.”
“I’m well aware,” she said, then looked back at the plant. “Bucky, right?” Instead of answering, Steve just tipped the sketchbook so she could see. “Hm. You know, we’ve never really gotten along. It’s an endless source of Steve’s headaches. We

did it?” James asked. It was much more tremendously difficult to get those words out than James ever anticipated it would be. He knew he was asking a lot with this question, the one question that had plagued him for thirteen years.
“Mmm,” Tony said. She was draped across his bare chest, happy to just snuggle against his warmth. Steve was always warm.

been alone too long.” Steve Rogers noted somewhere in the back of his brain that staring so intensely at the man he was sworn to protect probably violated some ethical code somewhere, but he no longer cared. Something seemed to dawn on Tony then, and that look he’d had magically changed as something finally clicked into place.

“We aren’t clear on the circumstances,” Coulson said. “The redacted sections weren’t recoverable. I got the information we have by a lot of rooting through other reports filed around the same time and asking around the Triskelion, eavesdropping—they killed them. All of them.” The words settled as a heavy weight on Steve’s chest.
Tony didn’t know whether to feel relieved, elated, or still terrified as he flew Steve out over the battlefield and dropped him in the thickest bit. Hydra agents, unfortunately, weren’t droids from

question for him, something he could not resolve.
“Do we have any idea why the breach stayed open so long?” Steve asked. He frowned, reflecting on it. It was particularly odd—they Hydra agents hadn’t seemed particularly confused. They hadn’t just been dumped out into this universe; they had to have moved forward through the breach. They’d also been prepared for battle, so either they’d already been in the middle of a fight or preparing for one—or they’d been preparing for

“Oops,” Peter agreed. It wasn’t surprising, though, that in the chaos to help out in Times Square, something had gone forgotten. But Peter knew as well as James did, as well as they all did, that they had been deeply lucky that nothing had happened. They couldn’t afford to make mistakes.
“What the
“How are things outside?” 199999 Steve asked seriously. James navigated his way to a seat on the couch next to Peter. Pretty much everyone in the room was sitting down—Kate had been at the kitchen bar with Billy and Teddy. Azari, Francis, and Torrun were on the floor in front of the couch, having only just paused their game of Wii Mario Kart. Most of the MCU Avengers sat at the kitchen table, eating sandwiches for lunch.
“Aren’t you both a little old for that?” she asked.
that I’m really hoping don’t…get back to normal.” Tony looked at him then, his expression somehow both guarded and a little hopeful at the same time.
did you find me?”
“Peter and Kate and even James all know the trigger words,” Tony said, a crease forming between her eyebrows. “We talked about this before I brought them back, Steve.”
“I think I’ll go to bed now,” Peter said slowly, rising from his seat. Kate followed suit.
“Emergency Field Medicine,” Kate said, and then she raised an eyebrow. “Are you even CPR certified?”

“With all due respect, Commander—no. I am not. And you know it,” James said, and his voice was as cold and hard as steel. 3490 Steve did not, for whatever reason, argue. He turned back to the MCU Avengers.
“Excuse me?” she asked, inherently offended by the question. Her brain initially wondered if Other Clint was right, given her constant paranoia on the subject.

welcome her husband home from his last mission, and very excited to do so as well. Steve leaned down and kissed her again. Tony didn’t care that they were still in the middle of the kitchen, or that the Other Avengers were about five feet away, doing dishes. It was her house damn it, she’d commit PDA if she pleased. Apparently, however, the universe didn’t appreciate her actions. Her and Steve’s emergency Avengers comms went off at the same time. They broke apart and Tony sighed in frustration. They both answered at the same time.
“I NEED MEDICAL!” James screamed, but he knew he might as well be screaming in space. No one could hear him. Anyone who could hear him couldn’t help. He turned his attention back to the man, horrified to find him slumped over, consciousness lost. He put his hands on his shoulders. “No, no, no, dude, c’mon, stay with me, man.” He moved his hands to the man’s thigh, squeezing down hard to try to stem the bleeding more than he could do with a tourniquet.
It was not an unfamiliar position. Steve was very used to commanding the Howling Commandos and various other military personnel. But he certainly felt out of his league these days. After all, what could he say that would be of use now that they were trapped in an alternate universe? Tony could offer more solutions than he could. All the same, he cleared his throat.
“Nope,” James said, emphasizing the ‘p’, “free food.”
“Getting slow, Captain,” James goaded his opponent. “You’re all pretty slow—you look great doing it, though, like

“I know it was more than that,” Steve said, his gut twisting horribly. James just shrugged. He wasn’t looking at him. Steve put a hand on James’ shoulder. “Look we don’t—we don’t have to do this right now. I just want you to rest up and get better. But I want you to know—I know it doesn’t matter how many times I say it if I never show it, but I

It probably would have knocked a normal guy unconscious, but James just felt the sting of a broken shard cutting him on the forehead.

“Fine, fine, it’ll just be messy then,” Tony grumbled. He grabbed the lining of the jacket and ripped it open, and suddenly things became clear to Steve. He was checking for bugs.
Chapters 55-57: Saturday, November 19, 2016
“Don’t tell me you’re shy,” Tony stated. “
“It’s not how I ever pictured it, but just add a white picket fence and a golden retriever, and it’s everything I thought I’d be coming home to, after the war,” Steve said, hollow.
It wasn’t long before they were dropped off in the parking garage beneath Stark Tower, and the Senator took them up in the elevator to the penthouse.
“Of course not sir,” JARVIS said. “I cannot transgress my coding. I will merely state that this action is inadvisable.”

know it sucks. Let’s be real about it—if I want to join the Avengers one day, I’ve got a spot on the team. No question. Does it matter what skill I have, what training I’ve done? A little. Peter wouldn’t have a slot without his recent run in with a spider. But I think we all know that really, my dad will put me on the team when I’m older if it’s what I want. I have only to ask. Or hint. Or join SHIELD. It will happen for me one day. But the rest of you? Well, you’re bound for the 50 States Initiative. Or no team at all. Or Prison 42 if you make a mistake.”
“Did you have sex?”
“We’ll take care of it,” Kate cut in, saving them the awkward silence. Peter was fine. Kate would believe nothing else. To Alt Steve she directed him. “Hang a left, take a shortcut through the alley.” Alt Steve put on a little more gas, and they were zooming through the tiny alley. Kate had to shoot a Hydra agent as they went. She tried not to think about whether they lived or died. She tried not to think about the fact that, with Peter in danger, she didn’t much care.
That question had turned Steve’s veins to ice.
“Can I get either of you anything to drink?” he asked.
powers, and I’m here. I shouldn’t be, but I am. But really it comes down to the fact that…look, Avengers Academy? It was a joke when I was little. It was what James and I would call it whenever Dad took us to the archery range or Steve took us to the gym to teach us some new fighting style. And then it became a regular thing, and that’s what we said we were doing on weekends—we “went to” Avengers Academy. It wasn’t really a thing until Stamford. But after—after, the Avengers and SHIELD realized there needed to be an

, her mind screamed at her.
“Will he even do it? Or are we stuck here now?” Clint asked.
“I’m not one of your bots, Mom,” Kate replied, her voice barely above a whisper. “I can’t be perfect all the time.” Her mother pulled her close and kissed the top of her head.
Oh, hindsight.
“He did it! He did it! Guys, look at Peter!” the other kids were getting up off the couch to come and see, and in the distance Peter could see Kate, James, Francis and Torrun watching as well. Actually, half the room seemed to be watching. His hands, feet, and face were numb, but it was
“Do not concern yourself with such earthly problems, Captain,” the Red Skull spoke. “You and I are above such considerations. We are as Gods. We cannot be buried.”
“I was wondering why it didn’t come back,” Steve said with a smile. He held out his hand, and his double frisbee tossed it to him lightly. A split second later, 199999 Steve was leaping and rolling out of the way as
The team of various and sundry superheroes worked to push back the soldiers. The strategy was to get their backs at the Hudson so that the small army could not break off and circle around to attack the avengers from another side street. Lucky for them, the unidentifiable soldiers did not appear to have any sort of grasp of the geography of twenty-first century New York City. Some of them shouted in a language Natasha could not comprehend—they seemed more baffled by the whole situation than aggressive. Some of the soldiers weren’t even firing at all, and whenever Natasha raised her guns, she shot to disable and disarm, not to kill. Many of the young avengers were similarly only using scare tactics to move them back—James threw his digital shield to scatter them. Torrun and Thunderstrike called lightning down to crack at their feet—but no bolts ever hit the confused soldiers. Azari used his static to frighten as well.
“Everything ok, Tony?” he asked quietly.
“Did you put coffee on? I’m stealing some,” Tony informed him before searching through the cabinets until he found a mug and pouring himself some. Steve sat down at the table with his toast and eggs. Tony, who Steve wasn’t paying any attention to at all, he was barely aware he was in the room, really, leaned against the counter, drinking his coffee.

have your own Tony after all.” Then Kate finally turned and left the little forest, heading back to the mansion. Steve found himself feeling stricken, like her last, ginger words had been a jolt to his system, and he aggressively beat them away. He found himself wondering, not for the first time, what had happened between Steve Rogers, Bernie Rosenthal, and Tony Stark, but he didn’t really want to ask. It seemed like a bad subject to touch, one the household tried to sweep under the rug as much as possible. So Steve turned back to his tree and sketched, with no idea how to help matters and a sickening pit opening up in his stomach, threatening to drown him in his own muddled emotions.
. She was still suited up even though her faceplate was off. Her arms moved wildly as she gestured, and Steve felt dread settle in the pit of his stomach as soon as he heard the car alarms starting to go off.

think. She was consumed by a singularity, consumed more fully than she was even in drugs.
“You’re the dancing queen, young and sweet, only seventeeeeeeen!” they half-sung, half-spoke in a chorus as the music played. Steve was highly amused. It was a ridiculous sight, his older self rhythmically drying dishes as Tony scrubbed, intermittently using the long scrub brush as a microphone. They were entirely free from prying eyes, whether that was true or not. They were wholly unselfconscious.
“At the end of the day they’re not Mom and Dad,” Peter said. “They’re not Director Stark and Commander Rogers, they’re not Captain America and Iron Man. They’re just people.” Kate was quiet for a moment, but then she spoke again.
“I guess that’s a no,” Alt Tony said. Peter did a flip down from the ceiling. “Ok, you were definitely not that athletic
“Director, Doctor Richards could not be reached,” JARVIS spoke. Tony felt her anger spike. No, she definitely wasn’t going to make dinner. Obviously, this person from an alternate universe with a cosmic cube was out to ruin her night.
“Unless they’re using the doubles,” Johnson pointed out.
“I feel kind of bad hiding down here,” he said. “I know it’s Tony’s party and she’s been so nice to us, I feel bad. But…she kept calling me Daddy. That little girl up there. She kept calling me Daddy. And then there were the two little boys, and they were calling me Dad and asking if I’d seen something—I don’t know what—but—” Clint broke off and shook his head. “I feel rude but I don’t want to go back up there.” There was silence for a moment. Steve couldn’t think of a thing to say. No one could. Until Bruce spoke up.
to see their stunned expressions. His mother appeared in front of him so suddenly Peter nearly disengaged from the wall in surprise.
“You do that,” Tony agreed, but as James turned to go, she called him back. “James?”
She recognized the scene. She’d played Clara in the Nutcracker that December, the coveted title role. She’d worked the whole

she even pregnant at forty-six? Tony guessed it must have to do with Extremis. It was keeping her body too well conditioned, maybe even slowing the effects of aging. She was going to have to look into that. But what did being pregnant with Extremis even mean? She’d been a regular human when she had Peter and Kate, no extra virus in her system. Would it infect the baby through her bloodstream? Oh, god—were they going to have a kid born with the internet in its head? That could control local electronics and accidentally turn things on or off every time it had a crying fit? A temper tantrum? Tony didn’t even realize she’d stopped walking in the middle of the hallway until Other Clint walked by, an eyebrow raised.

floor, it was powerful enough to blow all the windows out. Given that Mom was in pursuit of a suspect, it’s likely that when the explosive detonated, she was at or near the epicenter. The amount of force required to blow out the windows—bullet-proof glass—is incredible. Mom’s suit can sustain a lot; it’s capable of entering into space, and withstanding up to 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit…but there are explosives that can out-do that, heat-wise. Some plastic explosives like semtex would do it.

instead of chucking us in a containment cell in the Triskelion for a year?”
“Can’t leave you,” Peter said, shaking his head vigorously and biting back tears and emotion. The past few days had been emotionally exhausting, and Peter now found himself unable to contain it all.
It took a while for the Avengers to get organized to leave. By the time everyone was ready, it was ten in the morning already, and 3490 Tony was practically shoving them out the door. 3490 Steve still seemed oblivious to his wife’s intentions, which Tony found hilarious. As the Avengers were all headed in the same direction, they all took a stretch limo into town. As a stretch limo was not a car parked at the Stark Rogers household on a daily basis, Tony deduced that his doppelganger had put quite a lot of thought into planning the day. Since they were all taking the same ride into town (driven, of course, by Happy, Pepper’s husband, who looked
Peter wasn’t actually sure of the details of the plan. Were they going with old school assault on the castle? Secret tunnels? Creep through the sewer system? (Did ancient castles have sewer systems? Peter would google it later.) Full on siege warfare until they capitulated? It could be anything; the plan seemed to be need-to-know and he had not been designated as someone who needed-to-know.
“Wow, all right then, not that I haven’t been thoroughly entertained by this beautiful display of maturity, but I have some patents I need you to sign, Tony,” Double Pepper cut in.
speciality and—this is just…such a complex mess.” Steve capped his water bottle, coming over to the table. He put a hand on the table near Tony’s and leaned over, looking at everything. “Got something to contribute, Capsicle?”
“Oh, like potentially sacrificing your life for the greater good?” Tony asked.
“Can’t,” Peter choked out. James stopped pushing at his hands and instead put his own over them, grabbing onto him with a gentle pressure.
was a girl and married to James with three kids. That would be some fucked up shit. So he could sympathize.
“We were defending the base from a pretty large scale attack. It shouldn’t have been that difficult, honestly. We’d set up landmines all along the perimeter, and their weapons weren’t particularly long-range. They had to get up close to do any real damage, and getting up close involved getting blown to kingdom come by those landmines. So we were mostly just waiting them out, taking out enemy soldiers who came through the few gaps we had in our perimeter. Since we knew where the landmines were, we didn’t worry about soldiers coming from those directions. We knew they’d be taken care of.

But he didn’t move. He stood there, his heart pounding and his mind racing, until he heard the shower turn off. A few moments later, Steve emerged, toweling off his hair but lacking towels in any other locations. The second Steve saw him, he yelped and rectified the situation, wrapping his towel around his waist.
“This could be our last night,” Natasha observed. Steve hadn’t even noticed that she’d been standing beside him, but Steve thought that had more to do with Natasha’s skill set than his own negligence. Probably.
“What’s up with the different schools, anyway?” he asked bluntly as the thought entered his mind.
“No,” said Thor, in a booming voice that indicated his fury.

“ Over five painstaking years Columbia’s genetic research facility has fully mapped the genetic codes of each of these spiders. Armed with these DNA blueprints, we have now begun what was once thought—impossible—inter-species genetic transmutation,” the tour guide continued, leading them through the insect room and into another laboratory. Only a few, tiny boxes of spiders were on display, obviously being used in research.
“I should have known better. How many people have I lost, with how many things unsaid? I’ve almost lost Tony so many times—and yet, I was horrible to her the week before. That’s time I’ll never get back. I know, logically, you can’t appreciate another person every second of every day no matter what—but I wish I had,” Steve said. He turned his head to stare up into those concerned brown eyes, and his whole being ached. “Do me a favor, Tony?”
“Then what was the point?” Bruce asked, frowning. “If they know we’d be after our files, they must have planted them there.”
him. Steve resisted the urge to move away from his gaze. “Is something puzzling you, sir?”
“No, of course not,” Steve said, but he continued to look at the plans with concentration on his face. “Just trying to figure out how in the hell you follow any of this.”
It was almost like being back in the ocean, for a split second. Everything was blue, and they were floating, weightless—and then gravity returned with a vengeance and Steve slammed to a grassy earth on his stomach and scrambled to get back up. He was on the field before the castle, just a touch away from the thick of the fighting. Ranks of superhumans pitted against ranks of Hydra—it was the closest thing to straight warfare he’d seen in a while. Steve couldn’t even tell if they were winning or losing.
The first thing Steve was aware of was a dull ache in his gut. He grunted and opened his eyes to darkness. There was only a faint blue glow in the corner of the room. Steve squinted, it was the Senator, absorbed in his tablet.
“Then why’d you bring them home?” James asked. Tony sighed.

“You’re so mean to me,” female Tony said, with no note of actual offense in her voice. “Coffee now?”
“I’m—I think…I think maybe we should move to Protocol 42,” Steve said. Her eyes opened and she looked up at him.
A dozen other names and faces passed by Steve as everyone arrived for the meal—Henry Pym and Janet Van dyne (who Tony once again appeared to know the doubles of), Luke Cage and Jessica Jones, Storm and T’Challa, Ben Grimm, Johnny Storm, Henry McCoy. Steve had no idea how he was supposed to remember all of them. A woman named Wanda arrived with her husband Vision, a floating sentient robot apparently from the future, and their two children, and that one really threw Steve for a loop, but he decided to ignore it and ask another day.
“Gee, thanks for the vote of confidence, Torrun, I really appreciate it,” he teased her.
“Copy that, Commander,” both Carol and Sam replied.
“Cool, I’ll stick around,” he said. Then he looked at the table with the Alts. He grinned. “Woah, hey, look, it’s

“Cap, we’ve got to—” Iron Man started, but the stone was falling now around their ears. Steve threw his shield up over them as the stone rained down. They were about to get buried. At least, that was what Steve thought until he saw the Red Skull pull something blue, and contained within an amulet of some sort, from his pocket.
“I don’t think he’s
“If everyone’s going—I guess I am, too,” he said. Francis could hardly believe it. There was the whole Academy, minus the legacies and the little kids, ready to stand united, ready to forget old grudges, ready to save the multiverse. They were misfits, outcasts, and orphans—but they were already proving that they were heroes, too. The wind bit at Francis’ cheeks, and his hands were going numb. Kate and Jeanne worked out a few logistics as he waited and the others began to head inside. They would join them at the safe house later when they had gathered their belongings. It would simplify and streamline orders, even if it would make living spaces a bit cramped again. At the end of it, Kate and Jeanne nodded to one another curtly in respect, and Kate headed to the motorcycle. Francis climbed on behind her.

“Oh, so you do have a sense of humor? Good to know. And no, you’re right, it wouldn’t be Hammer industries. Justin Hammer couldn’t invent his way out of a paper bag,” Senator Stark said. Steve declined comment, but he couldn’t agree more.
“The tree with the face,” he said. Kate looked where he was, then squinted.
“How do you never miss?” Kate asked him, ten years old again and looking up at the man who was her second father as they practiced in the shooting range at the Avengers Academy. Clint didn’t even look at her. He only had eyes for his arrows. If Kate were sixteen, she would have joked that he fondled those arrows more fondly than a lover. Clint would joke back that she didn’t want to know how he fondled a lover. But Kate was not sixteen, so she said nothing.
flirted with this week, anyway?” James replied. Francis scowled. It didn’t take long before Kate was walking towards them, drinks in hand. Even if James hated that he was eyeing up his baby sister, he had to admit the guy was an excellent bartender. James had no idea what he was drinking, but it was dark and heavy and had a lot of burn going down. It was just what James needed. Kate’s drink, however, was Pepto-Bismol pink and probably horrifically sweet. Francis’ was blue, and he seemed to like it against his will. They all headed down to the basement together, but they were soon separated. James was quickly snatched up by a hot brunette with a forked tongue; he didn’t know where Francis had gone, but he could see his little sister dancing with a few guys at the same time. Well, that was just her style.

“Simple—they started an aerial assault and we’ve only got two guys who can fly,” Tony said.
“I’m surprised to see you alone,” Tony commented. “Where’s triple B?”
“Stark?” her double said, sounding delighted. “My sister?”
“No, sweetie, no,” she said, soothing. “We were fighting over something I did. It’s not your fault. Your father and I fighting is

“I don’t—I’m not really sure on the specifics,” Peter admitted finally. There was no point in hiding it when he’d been caught stuck to the ceiling. “But, short story, I got bit by a spider on my field trip.” Alt Tony raised both of his eyebrows practically into his hairline.
He took his seat at the front most pew. Kate and James slid in next to him. Their father slid in last, closest to the aisle. There was no body. They’d never found one—there wasn’t one to be found, Peter knew. But they still had a dark, shiny black casket in front of them, wreathed in red and gold flowers. Peter stared at it, stared at the shiny black and felt like it might just swallow him whole.
Steven Grant Rogers from Earth 199999 had never had a stranger few months in his life.

family affair, and that, Tony and Steve, still living in the home that used to be Avengers Mansion, hosted it every year. It wasn’t too different, Steve figured, to the Thanksgiving the MCU Avengers (and yes, damn it, he was using that godawful acronym because it was so much easier than thinking or saying their full universe designation) had planned for this year. 3490 Tony and Steve had of course invited them to join them. They wanted them to get to know the rest of the team, they said. They wanted them to feel welcome, and less like outsiders (even though they were, even though everyone knew they would always be).

This went on for a month—Steve sketched in the days, and watched the mad scientist at night—sleeping, of course, in the early morning. He wasn’t super human, after all.

He didn’t try to engage him in empty conversation or insult him or develop new nicknames for him (though, unfortunately, Agent Giggles

There was no great embrace, no passionate kiss. After a few heavily emotional moments, Steve kissed his wife’s cheek gently, and they moved the presents he’d brought to a spot under the tree. They didn’t have long until the start of the party, so Tony had to spend her time redoing her make-up while Steve set up the refreshment table. There would be time for great declarations later. Much later, after the wounds had healed, after they’d worked through the things they’d said, perhaps with some professional help. There would be time for Tony to tell Steve about the secret perched on the tip of her tongue—the morning, perhaps, almost like a Christmas gift. They would have time for passionate embraces and the stuff that romance novels were made up of. But for the moment, they could not concern themselves with that. For the moment, it was enough to hold a temporary truce, enough to spend time with family and be together for the holiday.
“Peter,” he said. Peter didn’t even bother speaking. He just hugged him. Based on how tightly he held him, Peter knew that he had needed that. “You know I love you, right?” Peter nodded. Dad held him tighter.

“Let yourself be happy. Let yourself get hurt. Allow yourself to risk hurting someone else, if they’ve agreed to take on the risk of being hurt. And don’t wait. Don’t wait to say something, to show something, even if it doesn’t feel like the right time. Even if it’s awkward, or embarrassing, or the hardest thing you’ve ever done. Because if there’s one thing that I’ve learned the hard way, over and over again, it’s that there are no rewind buttons,” Steve finished.
“You know,” she said, “after most of the other Avengers moved out, we didn’t really keep this gym up to date. We’ve got
“And I already took care of it,” Steve replied over the system as well. They were fighting Doombots. Considering that they were villainous robots that 199999 had fought before—and that it was rather difficult to screw up cleaning up Doombots—the 3490 Avengers had given them the task of cleaning up the streets of Doombots while they went after the real villains. Doombots were, as usual, just a distraction. But they were a pretty

Steve wondered how much alike this Tony was to his wife. What had he gone through, alone? He had been standing by his wife’s side since she was twenty years old. He knew everything that he’d had to pull her out of, recalled vividly every time he’d had to help her keep standing on her own. This Tony had done it all by himself.
nepotistic, are they?”
. And Tony wasn’t really sure how he felt about it, unsurprising as it was. Still, as they left the gym, Tony was just happy to see that smile on Steve’s face, and know he was the one who put it there.
“Oh Kate, Kate honey

It was strange, for Steve. He had no idea how to navigate the stormy seas that surrounded James Rogers. He had made it perfectly clear that he did
Peter sat on the couch in the safehouse, his knees drawn up to his chin, his toes gripping the edge of the cushion. He wasn’t really seeing or hearing anything at all; he knew that Benjamin, Azari, and Francis were busy getting some of the younger kids to bed. Some of the kids closer to Peter’s age—Billy, Teddy, Tommy, Valeria, Franklin, Lyra—sat in the living area with him, though none of them sat directly beside him. Torrun sat at the far end of the couch, occasionally glancing over at him and looking worried. He knew that the Alt Avengers were crowded around the kitchen table, drinking coffee MCU Bruce had brewed and speaking quietly to one another. He knew that his sister was washing blood off of herself at the kitchen sink since James—far more covered in blood than anyone else—was in the only shower and the little kids were taking turns in the other bathroom.

operate the suit very well like this. And considering she had a new team of Avengers who might or might not be hostile, that wasn’t a particularly great situation.
“You ok, Stark?” Steve asked.
“Our Natasha intercepted her and give her a warning. Told her double she wouldn’t
He couldn’t respond. It was like he couldn’t remember how, like someone had accidentally deleted his source code, all the parts of him that hooked his mind to his body and let them work together. It was something Tony would say, he thought, an analogy that she would make. What would he have thought, before her? That he was like a car without a steering wheel? A typewriter with no letters on the keys? He didn’t know. He didn’t know anymore, because she was so inextricably a part of him now.
. But there’s no way these guys came from your universe.” He looked at them all in turn, his face horribly grave. “Truth is, there’s nothing we can do with you still here. I don’t think these guys are gonna stop, and—” His words were drowned out by an explosion not far from them. There was yet more screaming. Commander Rogers shouted over it. “Kate, James, get the other kids and get the hell out of here! Gather up the Alts and get to safehouse three—James, do you remember the route? The password?”
“Thank you,” his father spoke quietly, so quietly it was more of a vague deep rumble than anything else, almost mistakable for a quiet sound from sleep. But James heard it.
“You aren’t serious,” Azari commented. One of his eyebrows was raised, but it conveyed an entirely different meaning.
Of course, Tony should have known that he would speak too soon. Just a few minutes later all of the doombots that were still on the ground began to rise, flying up over the Avengers and attacking from above.
“Round Two and you can’t pin me,” Jeanne said. “You’re a talented fighter Kate. But you lack the killer instinct.” Jeanne said, just as she elbowed Kate in the back. Kate screamed in pain and fury. She had had enough. She turned and grabbed Jeanne’s broken arm, spinning to twist it behind her back. Jeanne couldn’t help but give a shout of her own, and Kate kicked the back of her shins. Jeanne fell to her knees, laughing.
“I know you wouldn’t hurt me or Francis on purpose,” Kate admitted. “And we didn’t—there wasn’t a

“Yeah.”
“But she was just being
“I don’t think you have a right to be a smart ass right now, Rogers,” she snapped. Steve looked surprised by her outburst, and he winced slightly.
“Jesus, Pops, just drop it, I came on this little outing like you wanted didn’t I? What else do you want from me? Let’s just watch the damn game,” James snapped. Dad fell silent, as did the rest of them. Well, the rest of them minus Kate—when, the next second, their team hit another homerun she popped right back up out of her seat to scream and cheer. Dad stayed seated, that look never once leaving his face. And Peter felt anger pooling in his stomach, and then frustration and anger on top of that at his impotence, his utter inability to do anything about the situation. He couldn’t put a grin back on his dad’s face anymore than he could put one on his brother’s. He couldn’t restore cheer to the ball park, couldn’t turn it back into a place of sunshine and cheer and bubblegum. Only James could do that. And he never would.
in front of his children. He’d only said it because it was what they needed to hear, to have that confirmation. Steve shook his head.
“You’re still a bit of an enigma to me, Giggles,” Stark said, rising from his chair. He didn’t look relieved, as Steve thought he might have. He looked troubled.
By now, other Avengers had begun returning from their various stations evacuating civilians and fighting in other areas, likely hearing the commotion. Tony yelped in surprise as one appeared right next to him.
“Why haven’t you told him, then? If he wants the baby, and you’re going to keep it…I don’t know, don’t parents always get excited about that sort of thing?” Tony asked. “New life and beginnings and whatever?” Antonella shot him a sardonic grin.
. And Steve was so
—first at St. Catherine’s, then at NYMA, and finally West Point—had been hell bent on joining the army. The day when he was shipped out overseas to defend their country was always inevitable in coming. Steve was, in fact, surprised it hadn’t happened sooner, surprised he hadn’t left immediately after graduation. But that didn’t mean he felt prepared for it.
“It’s a secret. Suffice it to say there’s a decent amount of everclear, so you’re not going to feel it until it hits you,” Tony explained. She finished by refilling Other Steve and Bucky’s shots, then her own.
There was a flash of blinding light, and then the alarmed shouts of the young, super-powered children as they hastily retreated. Rising up from the river were giant blue creatures with cold eyes, and as they rose the water turned to ice.
