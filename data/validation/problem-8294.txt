“Don’t apologise,” Steve says in a sleep roughed voice. “She okay?”
“No,” Steve says, relaxing a little. “It’s not that, I—I’m committed. To you, I mean. I love you, you know that.”
“And you?”
Steve lifts his head from Tony’s thigh and rolls onto his back, his cock tenting the sheets that are still wrapped around him, and Tony smiles at the sight.
“No.”
“No, Tony, it’s—look, Sam invited me to come home with him, but I said no. I’m fine being here at the compound, I promise. And, hey, I’m not alone,” Steve says, glancing at him. “You’re here.”
“Makes life easier,” Steve says, throwing his keys on a small table before they walk into the living room. “It can be hard to get around when my leg starts to ache.”
And then when he’s conscious it’s a fucking nightmare and he wishes he could scream.
Brushing the shattered glass off himself, he stands up, puts the sceptre back in the case and looks around. There’s no sign of his double, and Steve doesn’t understand how he’s ended up back with the sceptre when his double was so determined to get it. There’s an echo in his ear and he’s reminded he’s still linked to the rest of the team. “Stark? Anyone? What’s happening?”
Tony pushes up and kisses Steve’s cheek. “You’d better come in when I call you, don’t make me look like a liar to Peg.”
“You’re crazy,” Tony says, staring at Steve who is standing in the water, moonlight playing over his skin, with his hand outstretched. “It’s dark, and I—”
It’s not that Steve doesn’t want to see Peggy, he does. He really does. He wants to hear her tell stories from the life she got to live, he wants to listen to her talk about all she’s seen in the decades Steve missed, and he really wants to know what she can tell him about Tony as a kid.
“I’ll always take care of you,” Steve says softly, rubbing a circle on Tony’s hip. “Especially when you’re like this.”
“I get it,” Tony says. “Promise.”
“Okay,” Steve says, a flush of colour high on his cheekbones almost hidden by his beard. “Good. I mean, thank you.”
“Calendars to sell,” Tony says. “Sure. So I’ll see you at—”
“Yes,” Steve says, his voice muffled by the way he’s pushed his face against Tony’s hip. “Shut up.”
“Mmm?” Tony looks up from his coffee, blinking at Steve. “You going to SHIELD? You got your phone? Let me know if anything’s hinky.”
“I do,” Steve says with a short laugh. “I’m not sure I trust myself.”
Tony shivers as Steve wipes up the excess ink and blood on his skin, slowly realising how much his side is aching.
“That’s—I don’t—” Steve breaks off and sighs. “He gave us all somewhere to live,” he says. “He tries his hardest to fix everything he can, even when it’s to the detriment of his own health, and he’s so smart. I don’t know how I couldn’t—”
“Down my side,” Tony says. “But, uh—” Tony cuts himself off and sticks his hands in his pockets, rocking back on his heels a little. “Do you not recognise me?”
“Rude,” Tony says as he reaches Steve. “I’ve been plenty productive.”
“It’s—” Tony pauses. “You can come in.”
The door opens slowly, and Steve sticks his head in like he’s not sure if Tony meant it. “Jesus, Tony,” he says when he looks at Tony’s chest, quickly walking in, the door closing behind him. “Have you—is there some cream I could—”
“Shit,” Steve bites out, and he barely has time to move before Bucky’s throwing it back at him. Grabbing it out of the air, Steve runs full force at him, and can see Tony aiming repulsor blasts at Bucky from a distance. “Iron Man, stay on him,” he says, voice as firm as he can make it.
Tony’s done this with a lot of people, he’s not ashamed of that, but it’s never felt so all enveloping the way it’s feeling with Steve, and part of him is a little terrified at that. The rest of him wants to sink to his knees and feel Steve’s hand on the back of his neck. Breaking away, Tony brushes his lips over Steve’s mouth, smiling when Steve whines a little. “Can I—” Tony pauses. “I want to blow you.”
He’ll try not to.
“Christmas morning.”
He’ll try.
He dodges Nat hitting Clint with a spatula and slips into the chair next to Tony, taking the opportunity to kiss his cheek.
Steve picks up the mug of coffee on the side and takes a sip. “Guess we’re both as pathetic as each other,” he says, smiling at Tony over the rim of his mug.
“Now you’re worrying me. Open the door or I open it.”
“That’s what the hot chocolate is for,” Steve says. “And you don’t like the cold either.”
“I didn’t know you’d rip it from my body and tie me up,” Tony says, raising an eyebrow. “That was all you.”
“Okay,” Sam says, looking down at the paper with a slight frown before glancing at Tony. “Sure, you got an idea of where you want it?”
“Sounds like a story,” Tony says. “Maybe you can tell me sometime.”
“It’s okay,” Steve says, ducking his head, a light flush on his cheeks. “I kind of, uh, started drinking it black after we broke up. It was comforting.”
“Really?”
“It’s fine,” Tony says, his voice rough. “You don’t—”
“Yeah?”
Taking it back from Tony, Steve slips it on. There’s no visual difference to a regular watch that he can tell, and there’s definitely no weight difference. “You don’t think they’ll take it from me?”
“Oh really?”
“It’s for a good cause, right?”
“I know,” Tony says quietly. “I know. I heard. It was—”
“Then why does anything else matter?”
“I—” Tony laughs in disbelief. “Yeah,” he says, reaching down and running his hand over Steve’s hair, resting his palm on Steve’s neck. “That’s one word for it. Let me—I want to touch you.”
“The press,” Steve mumbles into a couch cushion. Feeling like an idiot, he rolls over and stares up at the ceiling, looking at the patterns the holoscreen lights are making. “I don’t understand how they can—all I want to do is help.”
“I know.”
“Relax,” she says. “I don’t think anyone is looking to you for fashion advice. But I’m sure Tony would help you out if that’s your thing.”
“She had a good life, if that helps,” Tony says. “And I’m sure she can’t wait to tell you stories about me as a child, so that’ll cover a lot of time, Aunt Peg loves to embarrass me.”
Steve buries his face against Tony’s neck as he chases his orgasm, his entire world narrowed down to the feel of Tony’s warm skin underneath him, the scrape of the gold bikini against him, and the sound of their bodies moving together. Steve can’t get enough of it, and he groans, pushing inside Tony one last time, his hips stuttering as he comes deep inside Tony.
“Coffee.”
“Like I said before, I’m not here to prove myself.”
“Any idea who tipped them?”
Tony snorts at that and rolls onto his back, wincing at the pull of his muscles. He’s sweaty and disgusting, can taste vomit in the back of his throat, and he wouldn’t be surprised if Steve ran screaming from him. “Twentieth century,” Tony says. “No one says stupor anymore, Cap.”
Tony hums happily, soaking up the praise as Steve’s fingers trail over his ass, his touch lighting up Tony’s abused skin. “
“Now you can lean back a little,” Steve says. “I’ll move you where I want you, don’t worry.”
Tony sighs at the feeling, and he turns over in Steve’s arms so he can face him, hooking a leg over Steve’s hip as he cuddles closer. “You’re a pain,” he says. “In my ass.”
“No,” Tony says. “I mean. It’s your choice, and given that I once hid I was dying from everyone, I don’t think I’m the person to say when to spill your secrets.”
“Love you,” Tony says. “I didn’t—before—you need to—”
“Yes, I’m well known for agreeing with you when I don’t have to,” Tony says. He shifts on the couch until he’s sitting next to Steve, one hand resting between Steve’s shoulder blades. “Steve, we can change the shoot if you don’t like it. Just say the word and we’ll re-do it, get this one pulled.”
“Yeah,” Steve breathes out. “Yes.”
“Uh—”
“Tony.”
Steve’s almost healed by the time they make it back to the tower, but that doesn’t stop Tony from fussing over him, and Steve lets him, indulging in the novelty of someone looking after him. Pulling the uniform off is always the worst part of being injured, and today is no different. The skin knitted around the edges of the fabric with both the knife wound and gunshot wound, and Steve hates how it feels to have his skin ripped away.
It doesn’t take long before Tony’s coming, his hips jerking, and a strangled groan slipping from his mouth as Steve swallows it all down. Pulling off, Steve wipes his mouth with the back of his hand and looks at Tony. There’s sweat pooling in the dip of his throat, his chest rising and falling with every breath, and Steve surges up to kiss him, covering his body with his own.
“Sure,” Steve says. “Your scarring is centred around the—what do I call it?”
“No, no,” Tony says. “Keep going, I can—I’m so close.”
Steve finds Tony in the kitchen, bags of something that smells good scattered on the breakfast bar, along with groceries that Tony appears to be putting away. “Please tell me you slept,” Steve says, wincing when Tony bangs his head against the fridge door.
“We could.”
“You really know how to brighten my mood,” Steve says, looking over at him. “It’s not that I thought all the evil in the world went away when I crashed into the water, but Hydra still being around? Bucky possibly being an assassin? Not exactly what I expected from the future.”
“After Afghanistan, things changed,” Tony starts. “I changed. Not just the business, my purpose, but my body. And none of it was done with my consent. At least this is my choice.”
“Tickets home, that I made him accept because I roped Mama Rhodes into it,” Tony says with a smile. “He let me join him and ended up being annoyed that his mom fed me his favourite mac and cheese first.”
“Fuck,” Natasha swears under her breath, the only sign that she’s rattled by this. “I didn’t know for sure, Steve, I’m sorry.”
“How’s that going?”
“Move in with me, when we get back to normal life.”
“Both,” Tony says. “From what Natasha says, the longer Bucky’s out of cryo, the less under their control he is. That gives us something to work with. As for SHIELD, we go digging. Find out every dirty little secret they don’t want us to know about.”
A half smile crosses Steve’s face as he glances at the poster before he joins Tony on the couch. “When I came back, I eventually got a VA counsellor. I didn’t want it,” he says with a heavy sigh. “But I’d promised my Ma that I—before she died, I said I’d get help, so when they called, I agreed. But I can be stubborn, and I thought—. I don’t know what I thought. I was really messed up. The guy I got assigned to, he took a whole lot of me not talking, and then one session he gave me that poster and said he’d give me a similar one every session until I started talking. It was what I needed, I guess. Someone who was equally an asshole.”
“Hi,” Steve says, from Tony’s side, his face strained. “Tony—”
It’s been a long time since Tony’s woken up wrapped in another man’s arms and he lets himself enjoy the feel of Steve’s body up against him, the weight of his arm across Tony’s stomach. He doesn’t want to open his eyes, because if he does it means he has to actually wake up for real, and that means Steve will go on his run and Tony’s half baked plan for a lazy morning with him will be ruined.
“Huh, I—good point. Carry on.”
“Someone had tipped them off,” Clint repeats with a shrug. “At least, that’s what we assumed. Nothing there but a bomb, which we narrowly escaped. Never seen anything like it before.”
“What’s the plan?”
“It’s not like we’ve talked about it.”
“Okay,” Tony says after a moment. “I’m up.”
“Yeah,” Tony says, looking up and taking a sip of coffee. “And too many people who knew where to find me, including all the people I didn’t want to see. Instead, I went back to Massachusetts, hunkered down in a small town and kept to myself for a year or so.”
The next three hits come quickly, one after the other, and Tony’s throat is sore from screaming, his cock is so fucking heavy between his legs. There’s tears running down his face, and Tony knows his bottom lip must be as red as his ass with the way he’s biting it. He’s completely overwhelmed by everything, his mind so at peace it’s making him wish he could stay in this haze forever.
“Your biology is missing a few vital components here, but sure, we can practice,” he says before catching Tony’s mouth in a deep kiss, one hand coming up to cup the back of Tony’s head. Steve’s never going to get tired of the taste of Tony, the soft play of their mouths against each other, the way that Tony always sinks into the kiss like it’s everything he’s ever needed.
“Would you come with me?” Steve asks, looking down at the table instead of at Tony because he’s afraid of what he might see on Tony’s face. Judgement, maybe, or pity. Neither of which he’s comfortable being on the receiving end of. “To see her, I mean.”
It’s quiet for a moment before Steve hears Tony sigh, and then the door opens and Tony’s standing there looking twenty years younger than he did when they left the tower. Steve can feel his eyes widen as he looks Tony over. “I—you—”
“Wasn’t bad, right?”
“Keep staring like that and you’ll make me self conscious,” Tony says, a lazy smile on his face as he runs a hand down his body and grips his cock. “Thought you wanted—”
“Forward,” Steve says, one hand pulling Tony closer. “We go forward.”
“Like it,” Tony mumbles, his head feeling pleasantly fuzzy. “When you use it on me when m’already sore. Feels g—oh
“Not so far,” Tony says. “But I’m still sending him twenty of your calendars. For fun.”
“Elegant change of subject,” Steve says. He’s got his gaze fixed on Tony like he’s searching for something, and Tony only just resists squirming under it. “How are you?” Steve asks. “Really?”
Steve sighs, fingers rubbing a circle against Tony’s skin. “I’m sorry for destroying it.”
“Get out of here,” Tony says, smiling as she does just that, Adam’s chubby cheek resting on her shoulder. “What were you saying before, Steve?”
“So,” Tony says, breaking Steve’s focus. “Christmas market?”
“It’s been eight years, Tony,” Steve says gently. “It didn’t happen until I moved here.”
Steve ducks his head. “It was—I always hoped you were doing well, but I—” Steve breaks off and looks back up, meeting Tony’s eyes. “I was scared. I didn’t want to find out on the news that you’d died.”
“I want you to have a life, Steve,” Peggy says softly. “I did, you deserve one as well. Take that look off your face, you don’t have to be so dramatic.”
“No,” Steve says as he walks over to the wardrobe and kneels down. “Just you.”
Christmas Day sees Steve waking up with Tony’s head nestled on his chest, a comforting warm weight as he slowly opens his eyes. He sighs, pulling Tony a little closer, enjoying the slide of Tony’s thigh against his legs.
“Dad met them all in the sixties, partying hard in Vegas, I imagine. Think there’s still some photos around somewhere,” Tony says with a small smile. “I met them as a kid, but I don’t remember. Wasn’t exactly the best environment for a kid to be running around.”
“Reed thinks there was something funky going on.”
“How do you want me?”
“I mean, that can be arranged as well,” Tony says. “I wouldn’t be opposed.”
Tony grins, getting off the stool and walking over. “Come on,” he says, tapping Steve’s legs. “Let me sit down, you couch hog.”
There’s a thoughtful hum from Steve, and Tony would swear the air feels thicker. “This might sting,” Steve says. “Slow breathing.”
“If you’re picking Die Hard, I get to pick what we do next.”
If Steve wasn’t turned on before that speech, he sure as hell is now. “Maybe you should be the one giving inspirational speeches,” he finally manages to say.
“Yeah,” Steve says. “I went through a bad patch after I got out of the service. That piece, it—”
“Work?” Steve asks as he sits in the chair next to Tony.
Tony pauses, the spaghetti spilling into the water with a loud rush of noise. Putting the box back on the counter, he turns to see Steve looking at him through his lashes. “It’s not a—”
“Yeah, but—”
“Can you put me down? I’m starting to feel dizzy and I don’t want to puke on you.”
“If you try and run off, I’ll come after you,” Steve says as he helps Tony slide to the floor. “Look, if I overstepped, then I’m sorry, but—”
“Yeah. I don’t know how to fight that.”
“Yeah, Pegs, if you taught me anything it’s that Steve Rogers is the one I should brag about bagging,” Tony says, winking at Steve.
Bucky screams and the noise sinks into Steve’s bones.
“Fuck.”
“I’m okay, Tony,” Steve interrupts. “You can go back to your work.”
“Oh look at you two under the mistletoe,” comes a voice from behind them, and they turn around to see the trader smiling at them. “Go on, have a kiss.”
“No,” Tony says, leaning in and kissing Steve, his orgasm fried mind unable to think of what to say. He shifts on his knees when the kiss comes to an end and grimaces at the sticky feel around his crotch. “Ugh, that’s not going to be fun to go home with.”
“So why now?” Steve asks, breaking into Tony’s thoughts.
“You sound very confident about that,” Steve says, pushing himself up, leaning back against the headboard. “Wish I could be.”
“Skills. Sure.”
“What—where did these kids come from?”
“Sorry,” Tony says. “You spend as much time as I have around the military, you can spot it, but I’m sure the tattoos work for everyone else.” He pauses for a moment, not sure he has the right to ask the question he wants to, but his curiosity takes over. “Why’d you get out?”
“You know Natasha?”
“Tony—”
“Something tells me you might have a solution for that,” Steve says. “But it can wait. JARVIS?”
It calms down, mostly, once people realise it’s not an attack, and the crowd starts to thin out, putting their phones away and leaving. Steve takes a breath and looks around at the small crowd that remains, the injured being treated, trying to tamp down on the adrenaline still running through his body in anticipation of a fight that never really came.
“He’s not as subtle as you’d like to think.”
Steve catches Tony by the arm before he can vanish into the bathroom again and lifts him up, walking over to the bed with him before gently putting him down. “Stay,” Steve says, squeezing Tony’s shoulder. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to—”
Tony nods as he takes them, paying an inordinate amount of attention to the pan, and Steve watches him for a moment before he turns back to his own mixture. It’s looking ready, so he pours it into a mug and steps away, leaning back against the counter while Tony keeps stirring his.
“I look that bad, huh?”
“You don’t,” Natasha says, taking a sip from her mug, her usual calm demeanour shaken. “And you hope he doesn’t find you.”
Not needing more than that, Tony wraps a hand around Steve’s cock and presses a sloppy kiss to the head, warmth spreading through his body when he hears the groan Steve lets out. Tony lets his mouth get wet, spit spilling down Steve’s shaft, and he jerks him slowly as he runs his tongue over the head, knowing Steve’s eyes are on him, following his every action.
“Huh,” he mumbles against Steve’s skin. “Steve?”
And Steve? Well, he can’t argue with that.
“I’m a post divorce insecure mess, surprise,” Tony says as Steve pushes himself up and sits on the towel with crossed legs. “You don’t have to—” Tony breaks off, rolling onto his back again, and waving a hand in the air. “It’s fine.”
“Tony—”
“Actually, I’d rather keep talking,” Steve says. “If that’s okay with you.”
“Pretty much,” Tony says. “Left this morning on the jet, so that was, what? JARVIS?”
“Here,” Steve says, holding out the bowl of fruit. “Eat.”
Letting that sink in, Steve sighs. “I’m hungry.”
“Sir? It’s 6:30,” JARVIS says, cutting into Tony’s thoughts.
“Fuck,” Steve mutters under his breath. He doesn’t dare go and disturb Tony, not wanting to push him to the point where Tony won’t talk to him, but after putting the cookies in the kitchen, he finds himself walking down the hallways towards Tony’s room anyway. Pausing at the door he can hear Tony inside, and he almost brings his hand up to knock, but changes his mind. Instead, he leaves Tony’s bag outside and heads to his own room.
Tony’s unconscious more often than not, now, and he—.
“No, it’s not,” Tony says, swallowing around the lump in his throat. “You should—” he steps back and gestures extravagantly with a smile. “Come in.”
“You sure? Because I’m killing it on Angry Birds right now.” Tony looks up, his brow furrowing. “And also you still look like you’re about to face a firing squad.”
“Your GQ shoot,” Tony says, flicking the holoscreen up so Steve can see. “You look very... all American.”
“I told you before you might not like what you find,” Natasha says, her hands fiddling with a napkin on the table as she looks up at Steve. “And you still want to do this?”
“The fact you’re not sure about that worries me.”
“Sure.”
The next morning, Steve gets woken up by Tony’s hand in his face, poking his nose, and he bats it away. “S’rude,” he mutters against the pillow. “Nicer ways to wake me up.”
“Steve? Hey, we have this now,” Tony says, shuffling closer. “We worked it out.”
“Fuzzy,” Tony says, staring at Steve. “But yeah.”
Steve raises an eyebrow. “The answer would still be yes.”
“And what might that be?” Tony asks as he straightens up and walks over to the sink.
“So,” Steve says in a rough voice, moving his thumb away, his hands running down Tony’s arms, unable to stop touching him. “Was that obvious enough?”
“What?” Tony asks, suddenly going very still.
“Then it’s a date.”
“Tony—”
“Tony—”
“You can get lucky in another way if you know what I mean,” Tony says, wriggling a little on Steve’s lap, and Steve just holds onto him tighter.
“Not sure,” Tony says, leaning in and trailing a line of kisses up Steve’s neck. “Maybe we should move this to my room and you can try and convince me again?”
“Sure, Mr Stark,” Cynthia says, propping Adam up against her shoulder. “I’ll be sure to work on that.”
“You said ‘were’,” Tony says, his cheeks heating up as he rocks back on his heels. “And I don’t want to be pushy—”
“You’re going to owe us an explanation,” Natasha says over the comms, her voice still hoarse. “You know that, right?”
“Seems so,” Steve says. “Got any ideas?”
Tony’s words punch Steve’s orgasm out of him like a thunderbolt, his entire body trembling with the force of it as he spills inside Tony. “Fuck,” he breathes out, his face pressed up against Tony’s cheek. “You really—”
“I was reading,” Steve says, picking up what Tony threw at him. “What’s this?”
“Hi,” Steve says, breaking the awkward silence.
“Technically? Yeah. Probably.”
“Yep,” Steve says, meeting Tony’s eyes. “You’re stuck with me.”
“Well,” Pierce says. “Who would’ve thought that you, of all people, would be on our side. I wouldn’t have believed it if Sitwell hadn’t heard it himself. Captain America, part of Hydra.” There’s a pause, and Steve doesn’t speak, waiting to hear what else Pierce is going to say. “I’m not sure I do believe it,” Pierce says, finally. “In fact, I know I don’t.”
“Yeah,” Tony says, yawning. “But I always like hearing you discuss his tactical prowess.”
“Widow? Widow?” Steve looks around frantically but he can’t see her. “Anyone have eyes on Natasha?”
“Whatever you need,” Steve says softly as he uncaps the bottle and tips two of the pills out into his hand. “Here, do you need water?”
Then Steve’s mouth is on his, and his mind shorts out.
“You’re doing so good, Tony,” Steve says quietly as he moved over a particularly sensitive spot. “We’re almost there.”
“Relax, we’re just borrowing it for the night,” Rumlow says as he waves a scanner over Steve. There’s a beep when it passes over Steve’s phone, and he takes it out of his pocket when Rumlow holds out his hand.
“Good to know,” Steve says, resting his hand at the base of Tony’s spine, his fingers lightly stroking the strip of skin exposed above Tony’s waistband. “Morning.”
“Yeah,” Steve says quietly. “Okay.”
“Today?”
“You just takin’ my breakfast away from me now?” Steve asks, raising his eyebrows as his messy hair flops over his forehead.
“Shrapnel’s a bitch,” Steve says. “Ripped up my quad, got an infection, got shipped out so I wouldn’t lose the leg.”
“Because—” Tony pauses, all the excuses running through his mind. It’s been too long, they don’t know each other anymore, Tony’s barely set up his life here, Steve’s still carrying around the hurt from before, Tony’s still working on his recovery, and they’re good reasons. All of them. They make sense, and Tony knows why he should listen to them, why he should be wary of jumping into this, but—.
At some point during their make out session, they must have fallen asleep because Tony wakes up half on top of Steve and half wedged against the back of the couch, his head underneath Steve’s chin with one hand tucked in the waistband of Steve’s shorts.
After being made to leave his phone, and the initial scan of his body, Steve’s lead into a lobby style room where he ignores the couch and instead stands, arms folded across his chest as he waits. It doesn’t take long before Pierce walks in, and Steve wonders if he should’ve switched the watch on before Pierce came in.
“You look like the best present,” Tony says, tugging at the sheets in an effort to reach Steve’s skin. “All wrapped up so prettily with sunkissed skin.”
“Of course, Captain.”
“Yeah?”
“Yeah, yes, I—
“Appreciate it,” Tony says, a weight lifting from his shoulders. “Really.” He taps his fingers against the counter. “Okay, so, who will have the honour of stabbing me with a needle?”
“Worried someone’s going to chop off your head?”
“The future is full of strange and wonderful things,” Tony says with a low laugh. “But you, uh, I mean you don’t—”
“Yeah, but—”
People used to hand babies to him all the time on the tours, just shove them unthinkingly into his hands like they didn’t realise he could crush them. It was
“Yes, that.”
Steve smiles, a soft curve of his mouth that Tony was never able to resist. “You had a problem,” Steve says softly. “I don’t blame you.”
Tony’s had a grand total of one visitor since moving to town, and that’s only because Mrs Davies insisted on bringing him a casserole when she saw him working on the house. Which, to be fair, had been very welcome considering Tony had forgotten about dinner while getting JARVIS wired into the house. Tony’s not used to being social now he’s sober, truth be told it’s half the reason he ended up in rehab, and his rusty social skills being put to the test by Steve of all people has to be some kind of cosmic joke.
“You look in pain,” Steve says, stepping forward and catching Tony’s chin, gently tilting his face so Steve can see the bruise. “I don’t like it.”
Steve leans back against the couch and sighs. “I don’t know,” he says. “If I say no, he’ll lock me out of everything and we lose our one lead.”
“But they’ll all—” Tony cuts himself off and sighs before letting out a soft laugh. “You really don’t get how the media works in this era, do you?”
Tony unwraps it carefully, like he’s worried it’s going to vanish from his hands, and Steve’s so nervous he wants to rip the paper off himself to get the waiting over with. Instead he watches Tony’s face as the gift is revealed to him.
,” Steve chokes out as Tony takes more of Steve’s cock in his mouth. “So good, Tony. So good for me.”
“Hi,” Steve says from the doorway, walking in when Tony looks over. “What are you doing up?”
“Unchartered territory,” Tony says with a smile. “Technically. Body wise, anyway. Fuck, this is confusing. My body is a virgin but my mind isn’t? How does that—
Steve looks at Tony, the exhaustion on his face clear. “You okay?” Steve asks, pressing his sock clad toes against Tony’s thigh.
Not that Tony makes a habit of associating with kidnappers, but he’s painfully aware he’s glad handed with some unsavoury characters in the past.
“Don’t think I—not exactly up for anything,” Steve says. “Want to, but—”
That evening, Tony doesn’t get home until late, and Steve’s still awake when Tony walks onto the main floor from the elevator. Turning his head to greet him, Steve notices how exhausted Tony looks, his tie loose around his neck and his suit jacket crumpled in his hands.
“My son Tony Stark is cradling? Yes,” the woman says, glancing over at him. “Oh, I didn’t—it’s very nice to meet you Captain.”
Tony pushes up on his tip toes and kisses him softly. “Just put pickles on mine and we’re good.”
“Before you got distracted by how much you wanted to nail my twink ass?”
“About me?”
“Beautiful,” he breathes out without thinking.
Tony pulls off and wraps his hand around Steve’s cock, not dropping his gaze as he works him. “Do it,” he says, running his tongue along the underside of Steve’s shaft. “You already put a permanent mark on me, I want more.”
“You can afford to fix it,” Steve says, meeting Tony’s gaze, the corners of his mouth turning up in a smile.
“How long?” Tony asks, trying to move his fingers to squeeze Steve’s hand and not succeeding. “What’s—” he frowns at the taste of blood in his mouth.
He dreams.
“Thank you,” Steve says, leaning back in his chair, keeping his gaze on Tony. “What do you think I should do about SHIELD?”
“Play the Rat Pack Christmas album please. Low volume.”
“It’s the power you get off on, isn’t it? Not the pain.”
“Tony, look at me,” Steve says, his hand sliding to cup Tony’s cheek, but not forcing him to look up. “Do you think I would’ve spent the last eight years missing you if I thought that? If I’d ever thought that?”
“All American,” Steve says with a huff. “It’s like everyone forgets about my parents.” Putting his book down on the floor, Steve swings his legs round to the ground and sits up. “If they meant all American as what I think it should mean, then that would be one thing, but they don’t.” Rubbing his hand over his face, Steve shakes his head. “It doesn’t matter, I’m being—”
“I know.”
“Sleep, Steve,” Tony says, reaching out and tugging on a strand of Steve’s hair that’s flopping in front of his face. “I’ll still be here in the morning.”
“Yeah,” Tony says. “Part of the whole, learning to be a real human thing.”
“I do,” Tony says, taking them when Steve holds them out. “Thank you. I’m sure I have something that can work as a vase somewhere around here.”
“If Bucky’s alive, then someone must have found him after he fell, and I don’t know how he could survive that, except—” Steve stops, a memory shooting to the forefront of his mind. “When I found him, the first time—”
“What made you make the choice?” Steve asks, rinsing off the dishes.
“And besides,” Tony says, running a hand down the baby’s back. “Like all sensible people, she seems to be very comfortable in your arms.”
“You’re getting out of bed—wait, what?” Steve looks over at Tony who is very studiously avoiding his eyes. “You bought me clothes?”
“Nat, just give us until tomorrow,” Steve says, when he and Tony catch up to them. “Please.”
“You’re not in any immediate danger,” JARVIS says. “But given the circumstances, I would advise you take a look at the reactor sooner rather than later.”
“Steve.”
Steve returns the smile as he puts his gloves on, and he gestures to the bench covered with saran wrap. “Hop up,” he says. “On your side.”
“I—” Steve pauses as he adds another finger, watching as Tony’s hole takes him so easily even as tight as he is. “That I wish it had been me,” he says, looking up and meeting Tony’s eyes as he fingerfucks him. “That I’d been the one to give you this for the first time, that—”
“Then can we move this somewhere else?”
Steve smiles, looking down at Tony holding his hands, Tony’s sleep warm skin a comforting balm. “I guess we need a plan other than blowing stuff up,” Steve says. “If we’re going to get this done.”
Now he’s built up a collection, people ask Tony what his favourite tattoo is all the time, and his answer has always been the roses that led him and Steve to meet. Now, though, as he watches Steve tattoo his left ring finger, he realises he’s probably going to have a different answer. And he’s really okay with that.
“Yeah?”
“Well, I’m not inviting them in here,” Tony says. “And good lord, who knew you were such a snuggler?”
“The shield’s mine,” Steve says with a soft smile. “But the rest of it? I don’t know.”
“Don’t be,” Tony says, his fingers rubbing a soothing pattern on Steve’s skin. “I know.”
Conscious of the fact they might still be watching him, Steve walks to the nearest bodega and absently buys a Gatorade and a protein bar, his mind racing. He wants to call Tony and check in, to hear his voice, but if they’re still watching him then he knows he can’t. Ripping the cap off the bottle, Steve starts to drink it as he walks out of the bodega, heading to the subway. All he wants is to go home.
“Tony—”
“This helps,” Steve says as he holds their hands up for a moment before bringing them back down. “You—knowing that you’re here with me, it helps. And I’m trying.”
“I’d like to be,” Steve says, as Tony fumbles for his words.
“That,” Tony says. “And now I’m here, and exhausted.”
“I don’t know what you mean,” Tony says, looking around for something to put them in before giving up with a sigh. “JARVIS? Got anything I can use as a vase?”
“Steve, come on,” Natasha says. “You two have got very close very quickly.”
holding babies, will push Steve out of the way to take a baby, and it’s—.
Tony pushes himself into a sitting position, his head screaming at him as he does, and he has to take in a few deep breaths to stop himself from puking. “I have to,” he says, looking at Steve.
A weight lifts off Steve’s shoulders as he listens to Tony jump in, discussing what he found on the helicarrier when JARVIS infiltrated. There’s a long road ahead of all of them, and Steve doesn’t know how this is going to end, but he has trust in his friends, and he has someone he loves by his side. And that’s more than he could’ve hoped for when he woke up in this century.
“I was gonna say you can stay,” Steve says, not looking at him. “I could throw your pants in the machine, they’d be clean for the morning.”
But then Bucky pauses, like he’s being given instructions, and Steve squints, suddenly noticing the comms device in Bucky’s ear. It had been hidden before, but now that Bucky’s still, Steve can see it, and he would bet his goddamn shield that Pierce is on the other end of that device.
Tony’s not exactly a fan of waking up sticky and gross with come stuck to him in awkward places, but given that he also gets to wake up with Steve in his bed again, he’ll take it.
The problem with dating another superhero is that your dates inevitably eventually get interrupted by something terrible. And so it goes that they’re having burgers at a diner, being what Clint would call ‘incredibly gross’, when Steve hears an explosion a few blocks away. By the time he’s turned to Tony, the suit is already crawling up Tony’s body, and Steve throws some cash on the table before they head out.
It’s a different building tonight and, judging by the amount of security around, Steve doesn’t think it’s a temporary one like last time. It can’t be their permanent base, Steve knows Pierce isn’t stupid enough to bring Steve in that closely, but it’s somewhere important and that makes Steve uneasy. He’s suddenly sure that whatever they’re going to show him is a lot worse than he initially imagined.
“Oh, sorry,” Steve looks up from where he’s breaking down his station. “I—no? Unless that’s what you want to do?”
“You don’t have to be him if you don’t want,” Tony says, taking Steve’s hand and squeezing. “We saved the world again, I think that gives you permission to retire. Figure out what you want to do.”
There’s a sudden lump in Steve’s throat and he stares at the floor. “Tony—”
, Steve’s pulled back. Tony stares at him, the bubbling of the spaghetti the only sound aside from their breathing.
“The butcher is getting us roast beef,” Tony says as he polishes off a muffin. “If that’s okay.”
“God, Peggy,” Steve groans, his face flushing like the first time he met her. “Don’t say it like that.”
Steve holding him is the last thing Tony is aware of before everything goes black.
“No,” Steve says, his palm smacking Tony’s ass again. “You don’t get to try that.”
“Yeah,” Steve says as he slides off the couch, joining Tony on the floor. “You’ve been so good for me,” he continues, fumbling with the waistband to Tony’s sweatpants, not even bothering to push them down, just shoving his hand inside. “So good.”
love with you. I never stopped.”
Steve pushes his hair back off his forehead and nods. “If that’s okay?”
“Wait until we get home?”
“If it doesn’t work, then—”
It’s chaos, the fire department is working on getting the flames out, and Steve can see people injured and confused in the crowd. “Iron Man, you help the fire department with search and rescue,” Steve says through the comms. “I’m going to do what I can down here.”
“I’m just glad I knew enough to keep them for myself,” Tony says. “Not that these would’ve been a blip on the radar in terms of my behaviour back then if they’d got out.”
And that, somehow, is more terrifying than anything else Tony can imagine.
“Yes Captain,” JARVIS says. “All but Mr Banner will meet you aboard the quinjet. And if I may, there is food ready in the communal kitchen you can eat on the way.”
“I’ll try and remember that.”
Steve pauses before he nods. “Yeah,” he says eventually. “I do.”
“Very, uh, small,” Steve says, looking down at Adam. “Tony, I don’t—”
“How long will it take?” Tony asks, glancing back at the stencil. “Not that I’m in a rush, but this is... big.”
Keeping his face neutral as he stares at the back of Rumlow’s head, Steve swallows. “I’ll be there,” he says.
“But you couldn’t know I was going to be here,” Tony points out. “If I hadn’t come by, if I’d been caught up in SI business, would you have just spent Christmas alone?”
Steve’s still kind of wired by the time he tries to go to bed, and he’s awake when he hears a noise at his door. Getting out of bed, he opens the door and finds Natasha standing there. “Hey,” he says. “You okay?”
“Do you want to? Know more, I mean.”
“Brat,” Steve says, the corners of his mouth turning up as he leans in to kiss him.
Steve furrows his brow. “I could do that,” he says slowly. “I’d need help from people with more experience than me, but I’d like to do that.”
“Say it.”
“I know,” Tony interrupts, holding a hand up. “It sounds ridiculous, but think about it, Hydra would want access to the highest levels of government. Things like the serum, Bruce’s research, Loki? That’s all information that SHIELD wouldn’t share with any other organisation because they’re too damn paranoid. It’s the only organisation Hydra would bother with.”
“No,” Tony says suddenly. “No, I’m—this is good.”
“No, it’s—I’ve been thinking about it since I woke up,” he says. “I loved Peggy, but I don’t know if we would’ve had a life together if I hadn’t gone in the water. I don’t know how we would’ve worked. I wanted it to, I really did, but back then I was a symbol, and—” Steve breaks off, his eyes starting to sting. “I don’t mean to put this on you,” he says. “I haven’t talked to anyone about this, I don’t even know how to put it into words.”
“M’sorry,” Tony says as he straightens up enough to lift his face off Steve’s chest. “Guess that nap I took wasn’t enough to see me through.”
“I have to,” Tony says. “After—when I found out what the company had been doing behind my back, I rooted out everyone who had a hand in it, but I’m still not sure I got them all. We have bases across the world and I personally oversaw getting everyone who was connected to Obie out of my company any way that I could. Created a lot of enemies doing it, but I knew what I had to do. I knew what was right. Just like I know what we have to do with SHIELD. We take down Pierce, and we don’t stop until we’ve got rid of everything to do with Hydra, even if that means burning SHIELD to the ground.”
“Can I do something before you ask me that again?”
“That’s fine,” Tony says. “Funnily enough, I get to make my own schedule. Usually.”
“I can,” Tony says. “It’s fine, I don’t need—I can—
“Sometimes, sure,” Steve says honestly, a tired smile on his face. “But there’s still good out there. Vaccines, people still look out for each other, the food’s better. What we do makes a difference, or will make a difference, I have to believe that. And I see people out there fighting everyday to make a better world. That gives me hope.”
“So don’t,” Steve says, and Tony’s sure he’s heard wrong.
There’s a soft look on Steve’s face as he reaches down and touches Tony’s cheek. Tony turns into the touch and closes his eyes, savouring the feel of Steve’s skin against his. It’s not even close to being enough to quiet his brain, but it’s something. His eyes fly open when Steve’s hand vanishes, and he bites back the noise that would’ve all too easily escaped his mouth.
“I do?”
“Greedy,” Steve says, his fingers grazing over Tony’s ass, pressing against the already reddening skin. “Do you think you deserve it?”
“Tony—”
“Steve, you—” Tony goes silent for a moment, and Steve just holds him patiently, waiting for him to gather his thoughts. “This goes both ways. Before you came along, I—well you know what my life was like. After Afghanistan it was like all I had was the mission, was the fight. Then you came along, with all the misfit friends, and suddenly I had a whole lot of people in my life I didn’t have before. I had people, other than Rhodey and Pepper, who stuck around. And for the life of me, I’ll never understand why, but it’s—. You changed my life, Steve Rogers. And I love you for that.”
“Yeah. You ever tried explaining Thor and Loki to a bunch of Washington suits?”
special day today’,” Peggy says, her shoulders shaking with laughter. “Oh, Tony, sweetheart, you looked ridiculous. Bright red lipstick all over your mouth, eyeshadow around your eyes and on your forehead, it was so funny.”
“You think?”
“I get that,” Tony says with a slight shrug. “It’s how I know Natasha.”
“No, Tony.”
“What are you thinking?”
“How young?” Steve asks, lifting his arm up as Tony curls in against him, soaking in the comfort that having Tony near him gives.
“I was good,” Tony says, leaning back a little to meet Steve’s eyes, enjoying the crinkles that appear when Steve smiles at him. “And I’m tired. You should take care of me.”
It’s easy, Tony realises, as he stands and sips at his coffee, watching Steve throw pineapple into a bowl, and he thinks he should be scared of that. It’s only been a few days and Steve’s slipped into his life like he’s always been there, like this is how they were always meant to be, and that’s—.
“Not for that,” Steve says. “Though, yes, that was incredible.”
“Sam said you wanted it here, right?”
Natasha pauses on the second to last step. “I’ve learnt to be comfortable with a lot of things, Steve, don’t worry about me.”
“Why are you making this into a fight?” Tony asks, confused. “Steve, I thought we were on the same page here? I thought that—” he breaks off, his shoulders slumping. “I thought you knew that we wouldn’t be doing this if it wasn’t going to be serious.”
“He says he has something to show me,” Steve says, frowning at his phone. “I think he’s testing me.”
“It’s okay,” Tony says easily. “See you tonight.”
Sinking further into Tony’s body, Steve lets out a groan at the feel of Tony around him, and he leans down for a kiss. “You’re so good to me,” he mumbles against Tony’s mouth. “Whatever I want, you’re always—”
“I don’t know,” Steve says, folding his arms across his chest now he knows Tony is mostly okay. “I thought I was fighting Loki, but when I woke up—” Steve cuts himself off and looks around. The floor is mostly cleared out with only the Avengers still around, but even so he lowers his voice so only Tony can hear him. “There was a note, in my handwriting, and it—it had something only I would know.”
“Stop tryin’ to wake me up,” Tony mumbles against Steve’s chest. “Rude.”
Steve picks up his gift for Tony and hands it over. “I, uh. I hope you like it,” he says as Tony takes it from him.
“I do, but it’s nice to hear it.”
“So when my marriage fell apart you saw your chance?”
“I—” Tony breaks off, aware he’s still resting a hand on Steve’s arm, and he pulls it away, sticking it back in his pocket. “No one’s ever said that before.”
“Yeah?”
Tony tries not to laugh as Steve finishes a line. “You know what I mean.”
Natasha’s quiet for a moment, looking him over, and Steve doesn’t know what she’s looking for. Her face softens slightly and she sighs. “I’ll help. If I can.”
“That happens on Christmas.”
Tony reaches for the shower gel and squeezes some in his hands before reaching for Steve and lathering his body up. “Too fast? Am I making you uncomfortable?”
“Ma died,” Steve says, looking uncomfortable. “There wasn’t much of a reason to stick around in New York after that.”
“You don’t have to—”
“Pervert,” Tony says, smiling at him, hands curling in the sheets.
Steve smiles at Tony, before he pulls him on top, enjoying the comforting feel of Tony’s body against his. “So,” he says, hands running along Tony’s skin. “You want kids?”
. He really did. It just fell short, and now Tony’s left hiding in a beach house trying to piece himself back together.
“No,” Tony says. “I mean nothing’s foolproof, but it’s a prototype for the next generation of StarkPhones, even if someone took it from you, they wouldn’t be able to get in. If you’re worried, I can—”
“That would be within my parameters, Captain,” JARVIS says, voice sounding almost pleased. “I will endeavour to do so.”
“I know you are,” Tony says, biting his bottom lip. “You know, if you’re having trouble sleeping, then—”
“Yeah,” Steve says, feeling comforted by the length of Tony’s body next to him after his long day. “This is good.”
Despite Tony’s proclamation, it takes another twenty minutes for Steve to coax him out of bed, and another fifteen on top of that before they make it to the kitchen where, thanks to FRIDAY, the coffee is already brewing.
Tony’s eyes narrow as he examines Steve and Steve barely resists squirming under the scrutiny. “Yeah,” Tony says eventually. “I think it’s this way.”
“Best Italian food outside Italy,” Tony says. “But don’t tell Luca I said that.”
“What does that mean?”
“You seem pretty keen on it,” Tony says, his head bumping against Steve’s chin as he fidgets on Steve’s lap.
“Not like I haven’t done it before,” Steve says with a small shrug. “Really, it’s okay. There’s food in the fridge, the decorations are up, and I’ve got more than enough things to keep me occupied.”
Tony’s legs are squeezing Steve’s sides as he tries to pull him in faster, but Steve easily resists, taking his time until he’s firmly seated inside him.
Tony doesn’t say anything for a moment. “Could I have some hot chocolate?”
“Maybe,
He doesn’t know if there’s a reason to be grateful.
“Right,” Tony says. “I—you mean—”
“I’m pretty sure I can make sandwiches,” Steve says with a shrug.
“Maybe,” Tony says, tongue darting out to swipe over Steve’s bottom lip. “But is it any worse than the other ideas I’ve had lately?”
Natasha told him it would be worse if he tensed up, so he doesn’t, but the anticipation makes him hold his breath until the machine hits his skin, and he lets it out slowly.
Steve yawns and rolls on his back. “Shit,” he says. “We’ve got to—”
“No, I do,” Tony says, walking over to the counter, smiling at the man there. “Natasha recommended you.”
“It’s fine,” Tony interrupts, pouring himself a drink and knocking it back. “Promise, Cap.”
“I didn’t mean to imply—”
“Tony—”
It’s hideous. Bright green with a reindeer on the front, and what Steve sadly suspects are light up bulbs on it that are draped over the reindeer’s antlers. Sighing, he pulls on a tank top before he looks at the sweater again. He knows Tony left it here, and if he doesn’t wear it, Tony will definitely have something to say. Or he’ll pout mockingly and Steve won’t be able to resist putting it on anyway.
“Guess you must be pretty disappointed,” Tony says, putting his tablet down.
.” Tony pauses, trying to gather his thoughts, when something occurs to him. Narrowing his eyes, he looks up at Steve. “You want it,” he says. “You’re worried about me, sure, but you never—” Tony glances down at Steve’s crotch and raises an eyebrow before looking up and meeting Steve’s eyes again. “If you wanted to get off, all you had to do was ask.”
“Thank you,” Tony says, meeting Steve’s eyes reflected in the mirror on the wall. He wouldn’t swear to it, but Tony thinks he can see Steve’s ears turning red, and something settles in Tony’s chest upon seeing that.
“Tony?”
“Okay,” Tony says with a smile. “You can’t cook and I don’t want to. There’s stuff for sandwiches in the fridge, though, and there’s some bread I got from that lady down the street.”
“Now?”
“I didn’t even finish the sentence, what if I’d said you want to fuck me over the table?”
“I’m sorry,” Tony says, one hand coming up and cupping the back of Steve’s head. “Hey, let's get you upstairs.”
“Okay.”
Steve shrugs. “I don’t know. These last few years, it’s—I can see why other places were fearful of a man wearing the flag. I can understand that, and I don’t know if that’s who I am anymore. Don’t know if that’s who I want to be.”
Tony feels his cheeks flushing as he tries to avoid asking for what he wants, and he ducks his head, tucking his face against Steve’s neck.
“Tony, there’s very few people I’d want to spend a holiday with. You’re one of them.”
The vulnerability in Tony’s eyes kills Steve, and he wishes he could erase whatever it is that still has Tony sometimes feeling like he’s one misstep away from Steve not wanting him anymore.
“What happened?”
“I know you’re awake,” Steve says. Tony feels the bed shift as Steve perches on the mattress. “Tony—”
“I want it,” Tony says. “Spank me again, Steve, please.”
Steve wasn’t snooping, he wants to be absolutely clear on that. He’d been clearing out boxes that had been sent over from one of Tony’s storage facilities as they started sorting out what to bring with them to the new house, and, well. Steve hadn’t exactly expected to stumble across photos. Polaroids, to be exact, of Tony when he was younger.
And that would be fine, even Tony has old photos, they’ve gone through the photo albums he’s kept before, but these—these are Tony in lingerie, and Steve can’t stop staring.
“Yeah,” Tony says, reaching up and pushing Steve’s wet hair back. “Really hard.”
“What wouldn’t I want to be here?”
“Yeah. But then I saw you hiding behind a plant and realised that maybe with everything going on, you weren’t happy any longer.”
“There are more fun ways to warm me up,” Tony says, nudging Steve with his knee. “If you’re interested.”
“What is it?” Steve asks, getting out of bed and pulling out a dresser drawer before realising he doesn’t have any clothes in Tony’s room. Rolling his eyes at the laugh Tony smothers, he takes the robe Tony hands him and tugs it on, the fabric skimming the middle of his thighs. “Director?”
“Really? Felt refreshing to me,” Steve says, walking over to his set up and flashing a grin at Tony.
“Steve—”
“I guess we’ll find out,” Steve says. “But I’m pretty sure I’m reliable.”
“They’re still not our kids,” Steve says. “And yes. No. I don’t want to get up. But I’m hungry.”
“I’m not a child,” Tony protests.
Tony sticks his hands in his hoodie pockets. “Call it making amends. Besides, I can't go ticking off the local firefighters if I’m going to keep building things in the shed.”
“What?”
The needle hits Tony’s skin and he breathes in slowly, acclimating to the sensation. It’s a different kind of pain this time, compared to the line work, and his mind turns over as he tries to place it. The line work was sharper, more exact, but getting colour is almost blunt, a constant scraping against his skin. Tony wonders what it says about him that he enjoys it.
“Good to know.”
“Okay. Go look in the mirror, tell me if you like it.”
“Well, Adam likes you,” Tony says, looking back down at the baby, leaning against Steve’s side. “Don’t you, kiddo? Christ, how do they make them this small? Look at his nose, it’s obnoxiously cute. Cynthia you’re going to have to keep this kid out of the office, I’ll end up giving him anything he wants.”
“It’s gorgeous,” Tony says, watching Steve’s face light up. “You did more than I could’ve imagined, and my imagination is pretty incredible.”
Steve looks around, taking in the people from town walking around, laughing and enjoying time with their friends, the kids on the mini ice skating rink holding onto penguins to stay steady, and the teenagers drinking hot chocolate and sharing fresh donuts. “No,” he says hoarsely as he turns back to Tony. “It’s a lot, Tony.”
“Date?”
“You’re doing pretty good already,” Steve says, offering Tony a small smile. “I guess it feels strange sometimes, everyone knows so much about me, but there’s this side of me no one ever asks about.” Steve takes a moment before he shrugs awkwardly. “I don’t even know anything about that part of me.”
“I don’t want to let you go,” Tony says quietly. Some of the fuzziness in his brain is clearing up, and he hates how weak he sounds. How clingy. Steve always says he loves Tony like this, but. Well. Tony doesn’t want to know if today’s the day he’s tired of it.
And that’s all Steve gets out before he’s kissing Tony, his lips tentatively pressing against Tony’s mouth in the briefest of kisses, and Tony swears his brain shorts out. Before he can even react, before he can touch Steve, return the kiss, do
There’s a look on Tony’s face that passes before Steve can interpret it, and he ducks his head. “So,” Tony says, tapping his fingers against the table. “Since I’ve done all the hard work this morning while you slept in—”
Wiping her mouth with a napkin, Natasha frowns. “You don’t give up do you?”
“I don’t.”
Tony hums, his fingers stroking along Steve’s shoulders. “I’ll ask some people,” he says. “We’ll figure it out. SI already has specific scholarship funds targeted to immigrant kids, but—”
“Can’t—” Tony says, waving a hand in the air. “Gonna come.”
“Well. Okay then. Someone get a distraction going before I have to pay to replace every tree in Central Park.”
“Well,” Peggy says, looking at Tony who waves a hand in the air in resignation. “I’d stopped by in the morning, I was going to be away for his party and I wanted to make sure I saw him. Maria and I were having tea when Tony came running into the room, make up smeared all over his face.”
Head swimming from the praise, Tony catches Steve’s mouth in a kiss and runs his hands all over Steve’s still clothed body until he can cup Steve’s cock through his pants. “Fuck me,” Tony mutters against Steve’s mouth. “Steve, I want it, make me feel it.”
“Yes, Captain?”
“Tony—”
“Yeah.”
“This is fun,” Natasha says, raising an eyebrow as she drops her stance. “You don’t whine like Clint does when I hit him.”
“Regretting fighting for that whole freedom of the press thing?”
“What do you think?” Tony asks, his fingers running over his stomach. “I had it custom made after—”
“Well,” Natasha says. “They have met you.”
“That is?”
Tony turns away from Steve’s searching eyes, fixing his own gaze on the ugly macrame hanging from a nail in the wall opposite him as a form of distraction, but all it really does is make him feel slightly nauseous. “I don’t want to be an asshole,” Tony says, looking back at Steve. “But you—were we ever friends?”
Steve’s sure he should say something here, but there’s suddenly so much of Tony’s skin in front of him that his brain feels like it’s shorting out. It’s not like he’s not used to seeing Tony’s naked body, but—. Somehow this feels new, seeing Tony like this, and Steve itches to touch him.
But now—Tony can’t even believe Steve’s still here. Then again, maybe Steve just wanted to make sure Tony didn’t die in his sleep after last night, and is here to tell Tony he’s leaving.
“Steve—”
“Yeah, yes.”
“It’s milk and chocolate, Tony, you’d have to try pretty hard to screw it up.”
“Sounds familiar,” Tony says, wishing he could turn around and look at Steve properly. “Steve—”
. If I wanted a twenty two year old to fuck, I could go and get a twenty two year old to fuck. But I don’t want that, I want you. However old you are, whatever you look like, it’s always going to be you.”
Steve’s never asked if it was that that made Tony want to come back permanently, or if Tony had been looking for an excuse to wear the armor again. And he’s certainly never asked if Tony rejoining the team was the reason he and Pepper broke up. Steve’s not sure he wants to know.
If Tony could cry, he would, but his dehydrated body won’t cooperate, and instead all he can feel is his body shaking with the need to cry, but Steve—.
, but he couldn’t say anything. The only time he had, the stage manager had looked at Steve like he’d admitted to wanting to eat babies and told him to suck it up and get on with it.
Taking it back into the lounge, Tony notices Steve’s found some glasses and is pouring the wine he brought into them, and he’s struck by how painfully domestic it feels. It’s like a painful flashback to how his life had been until recently. He
An easy smile crosses Steve’s face, like it used to on the days Tony was with him and sober, the days when Tony thought he could stay clean if he had Steve. That was always doomed to fail, Tony knows that now. He had to get clean for him, not for someone else, even if that someone else had been the love of his life.
“I enjoyed it as much as you did,” Tony says, snuggling back against Steve’s chest. “But you’re welcome.”
“If I whine you’ll just hit me harder,” Steve says, wiping the sweat from his brow.
“I want to hear those stories,” Steve says with a smile.
Steve lets her get away with the deflection because the smells coming off the food truck are mouthwatering and by the time they get to the ordering station he feels like he could eat everything on the truck. He lets Natasha order for him, slightly overwhelmed by the amount of choice, and ends up with an entire platter of meat, pita, and salad. Taking their food to nearby steps, they sit down and start to eat.
“I kissed you, in the middle of the Christmas market,” Steve says quietly, sucking in a breath when Tony’s hands slide around his waist, fingers tapping against the small of his back. “How much more direct could I be?”
“I hated myself back then,” Tony says simply. “And being back in that body, thinking about what I was like, it’s—”
It seems like forever before they make it back to the tower, and Steve heads straight for the workshop, thanking JARVIS as the doors open. Tony’s working on the armour when he walks in, one of the boots on the table in front of him and Steve steps into Tony’s eyeline. “Can people hack my phone?”
“Nothing to be nervous about,” Steve says, opening the door. “Only a coupla more hours to go before you’re finished.”
“Nice hat,” Natasha says, reaching up and flicking the brim. “Your boyfriend give you that?”
“But you’re—you have a support system? Even here?”
“Your secret’s safe with me,” Steve says with a smile. “I’m just happy you didn’t take me somewhere I’d have to work out what fork to use with which dish.”
“You want to be punished until you can’t form a thought,” Steve whispers in his ear and, just like that, Tony goes from semi hard to full on needing to come.
“Wipe him,” Pierce says. “Get rid of everything.”
“What happened? JARVIS said you were in DC.”
“Still—” Tony starts before shaking his head. “Never mind.”
“Yeah,” Tony says, letting go of Steve’s hand and standing up. “It is.”
Tony groans at the movement, Steve’s cock still buried inside him, and he rubs his face with one hand, wiping the tears and drool off his skin. “Fuck,” he says, leaning back against Steve, taking comfort from the length of Steve’s body behind him, Steve’s cock still nestled inside him.
“The words that come out of your mouth,” Tony says. “Moms everywhere would have conniptions if they knew.”
“Yeah?”
“No,” Steve says quietly. “I don’t think you can.”
“I think Fox News just imploded and doesn’t know why,” Tony says. “Which I’d be okay with.”
“It feels like I’ve never had you inside me before,” Tony says, bottom lip red from where he’s been biting at it. “Didn’t expect that,” he says with a grin. “Kind of like it.”
“I’m a little sorry.”
“You—” Steve cuts himself off, unable to find the words for what he wants to say. Running his hands up Tony’s back instead, Steve cups the back of Tony’s head and draws him down into a kiss, the feel of Tony’s mouth against his grounding him. He indulges in it, Tony all around him invading his senses and soothing his twisted up feelings. When Tony pulls back, Steve chases him, grabbing another kiss before he laughs softly, his hands settled on Tony’s lower back. “I got lucky with you,” he says quietly, meeting Tony’s eyes. “You know that?”
The rest of the team files out when the meeting comes to an end, leaving him with Steve, and Tony just wants to sink to his knees and let Steve take care of him. He won’t, not in public with the glass walls all around them, but he’s itching to. Wants to rest his head on Steve’s thigh and let him do what he wants. Rubbing his hands against his own thighs, Tony can feel Steve’s gaze on him and he looks up, raising an eyebrow.
“Shit,” Steve’s voice says again. “Tony, stop, stop. You’ve gotta stop or else I can’t—”
“Tony.”
Tony’s eyes widen. “Sure,” he says after a moment. “You mean going out somewhere, right?”
“How many times did you lose this dude, Steve?”
“I didn’t know you lived here,” Tony says before Steve can jump to conclusions. Not that Steve would. Or, at least, the Steve he used to know wouldn’t. “I retired, and Rhodey, he picked the place without me knowing, if it’s a problem, then—”
“I know,” Steve says, punching Bucky in the throat, his eyes widening when it barely has an effect on Bucky. “I don’t want to kill him.”
Straightening up from shoving a box of cables in a corner of his office, Tony pauses at the sight of a photo on top of another box he’s yet to unpack, and he picks it up, running a finger across the glass. It’s he and Steve almost twelve years ago, the sun’s shining on them, Steve’s kissing his cheek, and Tony—he looks happy. He was happy, he remembers that. He’d flown them both out to Malibu for two weeks and they’d spent that day on the stretch of private beach in front of his house. Tony hadn’t been high, and it—. It had been good. Tony had almost felt normal. But then that weekend he’d had to meet up with an associate and he’d ended up making excuses for standing Steve up while doing coke in Vegas like the worst kind of cliche.
Rumlow offers no more information before he gets off at the next floor.
“You good?”
“Natasha and Rhodey, they found you, I—until they did, I didn’t—the thought of you not—” Steve wipes his eyes with the hand that isn’t holding Tony’s hand. “I was so scared,” he whispers, barely audible to Tony’s ears.
That’s the last thing he manages to get out before Steve’s kissing him under the moonlight. The heat of Steve’s mouth is a stark contrast with the coolness of the water surrounding them, and Tony tightens his legs around Steve’s waist, wishing he could get closer. Steve nips at his bottom lip as he breaks the kiss, and Tony rests his forehead against Steve’s, closing his eyes.
“Sometimes,” Steve says. “Not as much since I got this place.”
“See you around, Captain,” Rumlow calls after him as Steve walks out of the building.
“I know you missed the eighties, but no one says hacked anymore,” Tony says, looking up and wiping his hands on his tank top. “Where did you learn that word?”
Taking the two mugs of coffee Bruce offers, Steve smiles at him. “Thanks.”
“Wow. Didn’t realise you’d got married,” Natasha says before taking a sip of her tea.
“And you—I mean—it was your choice?”
“Happily fuzzy,” Tony says. “But quieter.” He’s not lying, he can feel his brain relaxing back to it’s usual state. “Thank you.”
It’s a tacky tourist magnet, and Tony tells Steve the story of how their tradition started at MIT because Rhodey didn’t have a clue what to buy him, so ended up giving him a tacky Boston magnet that Tony immediately stuck to his toolbox. “No one had ever bought me a Christmas gift when they didn’t have to,” Tony says, looking at this year’s magnet from Ohio of all places. “Rhodey was the first person I met who didn’t ask me for anything because of who I was.”
“Oh,” Steve says. “Would you mind if I—”
Steve smiles, kissing him again before he moves, gently pulling out of Tony even as Tony complains about it. Gathering him up in his arms, Steve rolls onto his back, holding Tony close. “Can’t say I ever expected to do that,” he says, his fingers tracing a lazy pattern over Tony’s skin. “Fucking you at this age, I mean.”
“Santa never reveals his secrets,” Tony interrupts.
“Here,” Steve says, handing over some chocolate. “Melt these in with the milk.”
“Peg? Are you okay with it?” Tony asks, his gaze fixed on her.
“Turn around.”
“Not ready for kids, huh?”
“You don’t have to talk me into anything,” Steve says when he’s done taking his fill of Tony. “I just don’t want you to regret it.”
“Still,” Tony says, looking at Steve. “I’m sorry.”
“You’re acting like I’ve never held a baby before,” Tony says in a sing-song voice. “Relax, Cynthia, I’ve probably held more babies than you.”
Steve smiles as he ends the call, slipping his phone back in his pocket. Holding the bag out, he shrugs. “Better than me,” he says. “Have a muffin.”
“Sounds like a good Christmas,” Steve says, squeezing Tony’s shoulder. “I’m glad you had that.”
The sound of skin against skin echoes in the bedroom, the setting sun casting shadows across their bodies, and Steve hopes that the cameras in their room are recording, that later they’ll be able to watch this together, because Tony looks so fucking stunning. The orange glow coming through the window lights Tony’s skin up, making Steve want to paint him exactly like this, with Tony’s hole stretched out around Steve cock, sweat running down his body and his head tipped back in bliss.
“Steve, please,” Steve says, awkwardly rubbing the back of his neck. “Are you, I mean—”
It’s chaos in the wake of losing the Tesseract, but Steve mostly misses it, instead waking up on the ground with the sceptre beside him and a scribbled note in his own handwriting that tells him to trust himself, to trust Tony, and offers up proof in the form of what his mom used to make for him on his birthday. To say Steve’s a little confused would be the understatement of the year, and he hasn’t even been awake for most of it.
“You know what’s not pathetic?”
“You’re just—I want to see you,” Steve says quietly, trailing his fingers down Tony’s neck, tugging on the loose collar of the hoodie that’s exposing Tony’s collarbone. “Please.”
Steve nods. “If they ask me to do something I won’t do, my cover gets blown and everyone I know is in danger.”
“You were staring,” Tony says, casting an amused look Steve’s way.
“Nothing, I—I’m going to go to the workshop and—”
“I should’ve gone back when he fell, I should’ve looked for him, found him, if I had then he wouldn’t be—and I wouldn’t—”
