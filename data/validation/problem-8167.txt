Stovok stood perfectly at attention, but Tony felt the urgency as he said, “I wish for no war.”

There was this, too.
“Sir, I must advise, this is poor healthcare practice,” J.A.R.V.I.S. felt the overwhelming
“But can we?” Clint insisted.
“Monsters?” Thor repeated with interest.
“Anything you wanna get outta your system before we’re very politely deported?”
—Steve felt the tight feeling in his chest return with a vengeance as the opening notes to
“Good thing it’s not a sweater,” Tony said, tugging the hood up over the back of Steve’s head.
The nurse finally showed up.  Rogers’ steadying grip made the visit more tolerable, but Tony still wanted to go
“You’re not
Tony snapped the door shut, then walked around the hood of the car and slid into the passenger’s seat.  He shut that door, too.  He inhaled slowly.  Let it out.  “Can’t beat that new car smell,” he sighed.
Tony kicked him in the gut.
.  These’ll be great, trust me.  No one has ever made these cookies before.”
“Pick six numbers,” Clint said.
. o .
And away they went.
Steve scowled.  “Thanks,” he deadpanned, accepting his change and a cluster of tags from the ticketer.  The ticketer’s hand trembled with barely repressed awe.  “Thank you,” Steve added less hostilely.
The keeper just said, “They’re squealers,” and offered Steve another bucket of apple slices.  “Watch the horns—they’ll gouge ya.”
”I told my scientists about your heart condition. I am pretty sure that they took it into consideration. But you know what they say. Better safe than sorry.", mumbled the blond and left the hut with his S.H.I.E.L.D phone.
Steve grinned evilly and pressed a soft kiss on the mechanic's exposed neck. Tony bit his lip even harder under normal circumstances he would show Steve how much he loved the kisses to his neck, now he tried to do anything to ignore his husband.
"You know what? Today is probably one of the greatest days of my life. It's beautiful, here!", Tony couldn't get enough of the beautiful flowers and plants that grew in the garden.
"Play it"
"Funny is a funny word! Don't cha think? Your eyes are beautiful by the way like an ocean.", Steve raised an eyebrow at that. That was definitely not the result he was waiting for. The scientists, after all, said that he will fall unconscious once taking the serum.

Steve smiled back at her.
They gave everyone knockout drops and it seems like no one remembers anything. Including you. The team is fine, they are in a safe house. They are all okay, besides Fury, they shot him.", it took Tony a second to process the spoken words before he nodded his head again and cuddled himself into Steve's chest.
Thor, Rhodey and Bruce looked confused to the projection.
Tony had trouble breathing, why was it so dark in here?! Why couldn't he breathe?!
Clint instantly began to type some commands into the keyboard and the team could hear a loud clear voice in the video.
"Would it be a problem for you if Brock gets the champagne? I thought that you could go to Tony and see if everything's alright? You know how nervous he can get.", said Steve which made Natasha nod in agreement, and she left.
„'s wrong.", slurred Tony, he didn't want to say it, it felt so god damn wrong to even think about it.
He gently took Tony's soft hands in his own and looked into this beautiful whiskey brown eyes.
Tony opened his eyes to see Steve hovering over him.
"I am so sorry, darling. But you were already asleep and I didn't want to bother you, anymore", that was true. Steve knew that Tony couldn't sleep when he went to a mission. Tony stared back at him, his eyes still tearful.
The second audio began to play and this time it wasn't Steve who talked, it was Rumlow.
"Don't know. How about you tell us about your day.", said Clint and even Thor and Natasha seemed interested in that question even though they couldn't wait to start the movie.
„Well, that really was a spectacular wedding.", said Rumlow before he took a sip from his non-drugged champagne.
Steve smirked at Tony's attitude.
"It's not only that! You barely spend time with the team! You keep saying that you are in Washington because of S.H.I.E.L.D, but I don't believe it anymore!", Tony began to sound angry now, but Steve kept his calm.
"See? You enjoy it.", whispered Steve into his ear and Tony whimpered as he felt how the soldier opened the button of his jeans.
The next clip showed the wedding ceremony.
----------------------------------------------
Steve smirked a little and placed another soft kiss on his lovers lips as he slowly unbuttoned his surely expensive trousers. Rogers carefully lifted Tony's backside up and pulled down his jeans while Tony let out soft little moans.
Steve's eyes softened and he carefully rubbed Tonys left cheek.
'Well, that's great. He really doesn't remember anything.’, thought Steve as he sat on the other side of the bed.
"Where are we going?", asked Tony, humming softly as Steve brushed one of his curls out of his face and nipped at his ear.
He didn't even concentrate on the words of the priest. He only waited for the question:
"I love you! I always had and probably always will, but I don't know if I can do that if you are part of a freaking Nazi organization!", Steve also stood up and waited patiently for Tony to stop screaming.
"Will you marry me?", Steve didn't even have time to prepare for the bone-crushing hug from Tony.
"Enjoying the view, Rogers?", asked the brunette as he seductively dried his thighs and then threw the white towel away. Steve grinned even more at that question and hugged his boyfriend from behind where he placed a wet kiss to Tony's jaw.
Steve Rogers belonged to Hydra. What a nightmare.
Clint laid a comforting arm around her.
‚Come on Stark, think! There has to be a boat or a Quinjet somewhere!', thought the genius and kept running as he suddenly found himself at the beach again. 'Goddamnit since when is this island so small?!'
Hold on why was he alone? He looked to his right and saw that there was no one else. Just as Tony began to wonder where Steve was he heard the door opening up.
"That's no problem! I'll tell the waiters to give everyone a glass.", Natasha just wanted to leave the small room as the soldier called her back.
Tony walks up to Steve’s side and takes his hand, and sighs loudly.
“Okay, so this started when Peter was still in high school…” Tony starts the story.
“Mr.Stark and Captain Rogers, your daughter wants to come into the lab,” JARVIS says.
Proof that Morgan Stark has a heart.
Tony might not have full control of Morgan’s situation, but he can help her. He can be there for her in ways his own dad wasn’t. They’re going to be okay. That’s what Steve told him, and he believes him.
Before he takes Morgan to bed he puts her on a bar with chairs.
“Because… because when the doctors told us that Morgan might need a third surgery done I short of… well definitely had a breakdown and built her an arc reactor like mine as a back up so that way she wouldn’t need any more surgeries after putting the arc reactor in. I thought if we need to put the arc in I could finally fix everything.” Tony explains.
“Hey, do you know that daddy also went through heart surgery too?” Tony asks Morgan.
“Hey, Morgan, before we go to bed can I check on your scar for a second?” Tony asks carefully.
“Tony, what are you doing up so late?” Steve asks as he walks towards Tony.
“Yes, JARVIS, Steve can come in,” Tony says.
“Why did you build Morgan an arc reactor?” Steve finally asks.
“Yeah, yeah. I think I believe you, Steve.” Tony finally says.
Tony doesn’t know how long he was hugging Steve, but after a while, JARVIS breaks the silence.
Her scar has definitely healed over the past year since her most recent surgery. It’s not as red as it was at the start of her recovery. The doctors prescribed a cream to help with the healing and Tony takes it and puts it on her. She shivers a little since it’s cold but is a lot more corporate with him then she was at first. At first, she wouldn’t let him put the cream on her but now she does.
“Really?” Morgan asks as she puts the plush Iron Man back to her chest.
Tony notes that she’s holding a plush version of Iron Man, a gift from her older brother Peter Parker from her surgery over the past summer. He gifted her a plush version of every avenger before the surgery so she would feel safe during it. She still sleeps with all of them but prefers the Iron Man plushie most of all out of all of them. Including the Captain America one.
“I was just doing some research, love,” Tony says. Not sure if he should pull something else up to hide what he was actually researching.
“Tony, how about we go to bed before we start that, yeah?” Steve whispers into Tony’s ear.
“Yeah, I know you’re right. I just wasn’t in the right headspace when I built that and it was the only thing that made me feel better about this whole thing. I’ve told myself that I will hide this so she won’t find it, but I haven’t gotten the time to do that. Lucky she isn’t allowed to be near all the suits and arc reactor anyways.” Tony says.
“Sure, babe. What’s up?” Tony asks as he walks up to Steve. His face freezes when he sees what Steve is looking at. He hasn’t told Steve he built an arc reactor for Morgan. Because mainly he hoped that Steve would never need to know about it. But he knows now.
“Oh, um, nothing really - “ Tony rambles.
Steve occupations his time by looking around Tony’s lab. Most of the things in it is stuff Steve has seen as he’s been down here a lot throughout the years but something near Tony’s old arc reactors caught his attention. It’s a new arc reactor. One Steve hasn’t seen before. Steve walks closer to the row of arc reactors and finally gets to pay close attention to the newest one of the row.
“There, now your scar is going to be better,” Tony says and he puts her shirt back down.
“I just… I just don’t get it, Steve! I’ve saved the world from ending twice, helped Peter with his medical transition, made time travel possible, but I can’t fix my own kid. That’s what parents should do. Help their kid. But I can’t… and I feel worthless Steve. Not being able to truly help Morgan. It just hurts.” Tony says. He can’t help it, but he cries after he talks to Steve. He has cried a lot during this journey with Morgan. Especially during this past year, when she had to have her second scheduled open heart surgery this past summer. It was a lot longer than Tony thought it should be, and he had a lot of breakdowns in the waiting room while his child was getting the help she needed. All the Avengers took up the entire waiting room at the children’s room so Steve wasn’t the only one who had to help Tony. It wasn’t until a nurse came up to Steve and Tony and told them that the surgery is over and it was successful that Tony could finally breathe. They couldn’t see Morgan as soon as they would like, but once they were cold they never left her sight.
“Calm down, love. Breathe, Tony.” Steve says unto Tony’s ear.
“You have helped her. You’ve helped her so much, Tony. You’ve made sure to have the best doctors in the country to help her. You always make sure she’s not overdoing it when she plays and makes sure her teacher knows what’s going on so they’re in the know. You’re doing your best, Tony. Some parents of disabled kids don’t care about their kid as much as you do and I’m so thankful that you care so much about your child’s wellbeing. I couldn’t picture myself being on this journey with anyone else.” Steve says.
“JARVIS, search everything about Truncus Arteriosus, please,” Tony says out loud.
“Of course, kiddo. I have a lot of stories with Spiderman.” Tony says.
“Sure. I’ll just close up shop and then we can get to business.” Tony says. He lets Steve out of his hold and turns around to turn everything off for the night with JARVIS’s help.
“Tony - “ Steve starts, but before he goes into his lecture he turns Tony around so they’re face to face.
He pulls Tony into his arms and hugs him tightly, not wanting to let him go. Tony feels the safest in Steve’s arms and feels like they can go through whatever comes at him. Steve is that much-needed reminder that everything will be okay and the worst won’t happen. Because to Tony, he feels like the worst always seems to happen. He needs to stop thinking that way.
Tony’s crying comes down and his tears stop. After a while, his breathing got back to normal and he looked at Steve properly.
“That’s okay, sometimes we have things about us that we won’t ever like,” Tony explains as he pulls her shirt up.
“Yeah, but Tony, next time tell me how you’re feeling, okay? I hate thinking about you going through your dark thoughts alone. Because you’re not alone. You have me, you have Morgan, and you have the Avengers.” Steve says.
This whole thing started when Morgan was born, even before she was born. When they would go and have routine checkups they found out that something was wrong with her. At first, the doctors couldn’t figure out what but later on they figured out that she doesn’t have two separate blood vessels in her heart as there should be. There is a name for this health issue, called Truncus Arteriosus, which 1 person in 33,000 births gets it. And at first this bothered Steve the most because he had heart issues as a kid so of course, this was his fault, but Tony had to remind him that the serum fixed everything in Steve’s body and made it stronger, better. If anything, this was Tony’s fault. But he wasn’t going to tell anyone that. Not even Steve.
“Yeah, I was really scared but your Aunt Pepper made me brave and helped me,” Tony says.
“What are you researching?” Steve asks. Trying to look at the screens in front of him and Tony.
It doesn’t take that long for Tony to hear Steve’s footsteps in the lab. Then he can hear Steve’s voice and he held his head up for the first time in hours.
Steve smiles at Tony and gives him a kiss on the lips and Tony gives a happy sigh in return. Steve feels Tony’s hands move to Steve’s built and trying to remove it. Steve stops Tony before things get too heated in here.
Then it was quite when Steve gets to read the article that Tony was reading. Then Tony heard Steve sigh loudly and he knows what’s coming up.
“What is it, Morgan?” Tony asks her as she gets up on the couch to look at her dads.
It’s Tony turn to sigh loudly and hide his face in Steve’s face. He feels Steve’s hands move up and down his back smoothly, trying to calm his husband down.
“Oh, I didn’t? Thank you for reminding me! What story do you want to hear tonight?” Tony says as he picks up his daughter and holds her in his arms.
“Have I ever told you how I met Peter?” Tony asks Morgan.
“I know you had good intentions behind this Tony, but I think we won’t need it. Morgan’s doctors told us that a third surgery will most likely not be needed. She’s going to be to fine and won’t need to become the next iron man to save herself.” Steve says.
“You didn’t read me a bedtime story.” She says to Tony as she holds the plush Iron Man close to the chest.
“Yeah, it did at first. But I got used to it over time and now I don’t have any problems.” Tony says.
“Okay, but I still don’t like it,” Morgan replies.
Tony knew he was going to stay up late tonight. He normally does, and after that Steve would try to actually go bed with him. But Tony couldn’t sleep tonight. He had something on his mind that won’t go away. Will probably never go away, despite what Steve wishes will happen. Since the problem at hand deals with his child, their kid, their daughter, it will never let him rest unless he fixes the situation. But as Tony has learned over the past 5 years, and especially over the past year, and whenever Steve reminds him, he can’t fix everything. Even though he was Tony Stark. He got himself out from being locked in a cave by building himself a suit, he saved the world more times that he can count, the most recent time when he finally defeated Thanos and actually lived. But he can’t be the one who can save his own kid. And for some reason, Tony is having a hard time with this. Letting other people, wonderful doctors from top hospitals in the US, to take care and save his kid. Tony is used to doing all the saving. That’s his job as being an avenger. Steve would probably tell someone he’s overreacting over everything, but he’s not going to agree with him.
It’s not as small as he thought it would be, but not as big as Tony’s old ones. As soon as Steve sees the writing he knows why Tony built it. It’s for when Morgan is a teenager and she might need a third open heart surgery. He gets it, but he thinks Tony was overreacting when he was building it. But he won’t tell Tony that. He knows better than to tell Tony that.
JARVIS does as what he told and all the research on Truncus Arteriosus throughout the years show up on the multiple screens in the lab. There is a lot of information that comes on the screens, but the one screen that catches his intention the most is the one about treatment and cures. He zooms into the article and finds it to be quite long. He starts reading it from the top and works his way down.
„Steve?", mumbled Tony and tried to look into these beautiful blue eyes.
"I love you with my whole heart and I think that it is finally time to ask you.", Steve made a dramatic pause as he bent down to one knee, pulled out the small box and opened it, the silver ring reflecting the last sun strays. Tonys' eyes widened and he clapped both his hands over his mouth, tears of joy welled up in his eyes.
Tony didn't bother to struggle he just gave his husband a deep glare.
He felt a soft hand that caressed his cheek and looked directly into Steves's ocean blue eyes.
"It wasn't your fault. We should have been much more careful.", mumbled Clint and stared at the DVD on his hands.
"Tony, please listen to me. Steve is the one who ruined your wedding. He, Ward, Pierce, Sitwell, Rumlow and lots of other S.H.I.E.L.D members are part of Hydra.", Tony blinked a few times and tried to understand the situation.
Delate Tony's name from the list.", said Steve and Rumlow, Ward, Sitwell, and Pierce nodded in confirmation before they made their way into several jets.
"You either drink this willingly or I swear to God that you won't like the outcome of this, have you understood?", Tony nodded his head anxiously and opened his mouth slightly as Steve placed the bottle to his lips. He instantly swallowed the weird flavored fluid and felt how his head began to swim.
It turned out that Tony loved the Maldives. There was nobody except the two of them and it was perfect. Steve cooked breakfast, lunch, and dinner and it reminded Tony of home. Well, there was one thing Tony missed on their honeymoon. There were absolutely no electronic devices. No smartphones, no TV's, no tablets, and no notebooks.
Tony struggled to get free as he tried to slip through the metal cuffs.
"Come on, Honey. Only two words and I promise that nothing is going to happen to our friends". Tony shook his head. The champagne was definitely drugged, who was he kidding he couldn't even stand on his own two feet.
Thor looked suspiciously at Pierce and Rumlow, they were one of the first guests besides the Avengers. He didn't even know them but apparently, they were good friends with Steve.
He slowly opened his eyes and wanted to rub his head to ease the pain as he realized that his arms were chained to the bed.
The blonde smiled and pressed a soft kiss to Tony's forehead.
"You know, I kinda knew that you wouldn't join Hydra that easily. I also knew that you would try to escape. I prepared something for you to be more obedient. It's nothing dangerous and it won't hurt.", Tony's heart began to race and his breathing got much faster as Steve stood up and tapped on the little bottle.
"Understood." Steve grinned and put on a pair of black jeans, a white T-shirt and a brown leather jacket that hung in the wardrobe. He quickly checked if the small box was still in his pocket and opened it, just to be sure that the ring was there. Steve smiled as he saw the silver ring with lots of little diamonds. He closed the box and put it back into one of the pockets of his jacket. Steve then made his way downstairs to the living room where he saw Tony wearing a pair of blue jeans combined with a grey T-shirt a pair of sunglasses and a brown leather jacket that seemed very similar to Steve's one. Tony smiled at the sight of his boyfriend and already pressed the button on the elevator.
"Are there any other calls that focus on the serum?", asked Bruce as he thought about what Steve would want with a serum.
Tony nodded carefully and broke free from the hug.
"Okay I have enough of you and your Self-destructive behavior.", said Steve and instantly grabbed Tony's wrist and tied it with some rope to the bed frame.
After a few more minutes of waiting Tony heard the door opening again.
The priest repeated the question for Tony and he also answered with a cheerful "I do"
Tony felt numb. Howard and Maria Stark got murdered 23 years ago and he only found out now. He remembered how often he got drunk and ended up at Rhodey’s house, where he blamed Howard for not driving carefully enough. How he went to the funeral and hugged Jarvis as tightly as he could and asked him how it could be possible that they both died the same death.
"You, I want you.", moaned Tony as Steve squeezed one of his ass cheeks.
"Tony! Thank God, how are you?! Where are you?! Is Rogers with you?!", Tony was confused, was something wrong? Okay, that was a stupid question, of course, was something wrong or Rhodey wouldn't sound so panicked.
”I planned to, but then came Fury to me and told me that Loki stole Hydras weapon, the Tesseract. I couldn't resist ya know? I wanted the power of the gods.", the soldier carefully stroke Tonys cheek with his thumb.
Tony didn't waste another second he ran into Steve's arm and began to kiss him wildly.
"Hydra killed your parents."
He just wanted to call Natasha or any of his friends. He had to make sure that they were alright.
He couldn't breathe.
"Oh honey, that's what they told you, right? That they died in a car crash. It's awful how no one told you the truth about your own parents.", Tony began to shiver and he once again felt like there was no air to inhale in the room.
"Hmm weird? Maybe a little bit touch starved? And my arms hurt because I am bound to the bed? I mean you know that I have a huge bondage kink but it's really kinda starting to hurt.", mumbled Tony and Steves's eyes widened in shock. What the hell?! The serum really did work! It seemed like Tony forgot everything that happened the last hours.
"Love you too, baby. Now tell me what you want~", whispered Steve and began to kiss and bite on Tony's neck.
"The scientists were able to repair it. I already called Thor, Banner, and Rhodes they should be here in at least five minutes.", said the Archer as he sat down next to the red-haired.
He still had no clue about what was going on. A warm hand caressed his left cheek and someone pressed a tender kiss on his forehead.
"What is wrong with you?! Steve is probably one of the best things that ever happened to me. He would never force me to anything I wouldn't want! I am sorry, but I can't let him go. I can't.", with these words, he ended the call and threw the phone away.
"Guess it would be the best if I show you.", said Steve as he opened the blinds with a small remote.
Well, at least he laid in a warm big bed.
"Hey, we just wanted to see if everything was alright.", said Natasha with a warm smile on her lips.
Tony took a few deep breaths and felt Steves soft lips on his forehead. Brushing away a few curls.
"Oh honey, don't worry I just gave you something so you won't feel afraid. It's okay.", shushed Steve as he continued to caress his lover's cheek. Tony didn't understand the world anymore. He was so god damn confused.
'Why can't I sleep?', asked Tony himself and rolled back on his stomach. He suddenly felt a warm hand on one of his shoulders and stopped moving.
“Tony? Honey? You are crying.", Steve tried his best to contain his worry and carefully swiped away some tears.
"You may kiss now.", Steve didn't waste another second, he pressed a possessive kiss on Tony's lips and the brunette felt slightly overwhelmed in his husband's strong arms. His mind was foggy and his knees began to wobble.
"I am sorry.", without rethinking the idea he kicked Steve with all his force between his legs and sprinted away as Steve hit the floor in pain.
———————————————————
"Good excuse, Captain.", said Rumlow as the red-haired assassin closed the door behind her.
Nat, Clint, Maria, Fury, Thor, Bruce, Rhodey and a lot of other guests lay unconsciously on the floor. Rumlow, Pierce, Sitwell, and Ward held weapons in their hands.
"I love you. I know I tell you this one hundred times a day, but I also know that I have been a real jerk, the last few weeks. I just want to keep you safe and I feel like I can only do that if I work for S.H.I.E.L.D. It was a stupid idea, I know that now.", Tony nodded slightly at that, happy that Steve recognized his own mistake.
"I hope you know that if anyone finds out about this that we are going to have a big problem. There aren't many excuses for a mind manipulation serum.", Steve looked into the mirror frowning at the last sentence.
"Please fuck me~.", Steve grinned widely at the instruction and pulled down Tony's pants, licking his lips at the beautiful sight.
"Please, Steve! I don't want this, please! You didn't even test this! What if I fall into cardiac arrest?! It could damage my heart and you know it.", the soldier stopped abruptly at his motion and pulled the syringe back. Steve seemed to think about it and carefully lay the syringe down.
Steve smiled and prepared himself to finally marry Tony. It was a very fast process he approached the altar and couldn't help but smile as he saw Tony in the near same suit as his. The only difference was that he wore the midnight blue tie.
"I successfully found a recording of one of Steve Rogers's calls. He called Brock Rumlow, member of the Strike team.", Natasha frowned deeply at that and opened the audio data which Jarvis transferred onto the computer.
, Tony had a giant smile on his lips as he said
He pulled his arms protectively around the brunette and pressed soft kisses on his forehead.
„Kinda sad, that we had to drug the champagne. It is surely expensive.", said Ward as he also took a greedy sip of the fizzy liquid.
Steve smiled into the kiss and rubbed Tonys back slowly.
'Yeah, this is fine', thought Tony as they went for another deep kiss.
"They drugged Tony with benzodiazepines. It's usually used to handle anxiety and has a relaxing effect"
Tony stared into his eyes, this goddamn beautiful ocean blue eyes. Which were full of fury.
This shit has got to be out of vibranium. There was no way that he couldn't get out of just normal handcuffs.
"Why did you leave without telling me? You told the whole team but didn't bother to tell your boyfriend about the mission.", Tony tried to look angry but he looked more like a kicked puppy. Steve carefully cupped Tony's face in his hands and stroke a tear away. He tried to look into the brunette's eyes to give him a feeling of safety.
The blonde smirked at that and pulled a small syringe out of his jacket pocket.
"Hey, you want some company?", asked Steve who also entered the pool.
"Oh honey, but it is.", Steve carefully wiped away a few tears that trickled down his already reddened cheeks.
"I think you guys know the plan, project insight will start in exact 100 hours. I want Zola's algorithm checked.
He slowly sunk down to the wooden floor and realized that he was in a God damn hut which was built above the water.
"Jesus Steve, how am I supposed to hide this?", asked Tony and saw through the mirror that Steve just shrugged his shoulders.
Natasha took a deep breath before she started to talk.
”I always wanted to rule this world. You know back in the 40s there was not much Technology, people showed you respect if you did something great like going into the war. Life was hard and we didn't have a lot to eat but we tried to make the best of it. Then I crashed the plane and woke up 70 years later.
"Well, you better don't get caught then. I want the serum delivered as soon as it is ready, alright?", the tone of the soldier's voice left no room for any arguments and Brock ended the call with the word.
He looked around the room and stared at the blinds which darkened the room.
The priest who stood shocked behind the altar stared at the sight.
The only thing he really understood was the words Hail Hydra.
Tony instantly began hyperventilating and screaming for help. He couldn't stand up and he felt so helpless.
Tony felt sick. What the fuck was going on?
Tony ran straight into the forest and searched for a place to hide.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Am I the only one who realizes what's going on?! Steve knows that Tony would never side with Hydra, willingly. There is only one way how they both can be happy", Natasha's eyes widened in realization and even Thor seemed to get it.
"I detected another call, the date when it took place is pretty interesting. Captain Rogers called Brock Rumlow on the 26th May 2014 which is the same day when the Captain proposed to Mr. Stark.", Clint looked at Nat and she nodded in confirmation.
"It's alright my love.", whispered Steve into Tony's ear and the brunette got goosebumps at the low tone.
And they called Steve inexhaustible.
Steve said, “Gee, I hope not.  Need something for the rest of us to do.”  He refilled the cup, then said congenially, “I’d’ve thought in a hundred years, they’d have a new wonder bread.”
Tony held out a hand over the edge of the bed unthinkingly, reaching out into the darkness.
Loud as they all were, their voices paled against the omnipresent roar of the Falls.  For once, Steve could not even hear his own breath.
Tony dared to look, placing a hand on Stovok’s shoulder to keep himself from falling into the abyss.
“Where is everybody?” Steve asked at once.
Strapped in, Tony nodded.  Romanova echoed from beside him, “Ready for jump.”

“What risk?”

to live in an iron lung, even though Tony Stark had apparently been doing it for almost four years, now.  Steve skirted a red-gloved hand over Iron Man’s chest, still trying to find a nonexistent pulse.  “I’ll live,” Iron Man impressed.  “You can . . . let me up, now, Cap.”
Tony frowned at him.  “I didn’t even—”
Tony groaned.  “I hate you.”
Kind of reminded him of shawarma, he thought, heart filling with fondness.  Boy, that had been a treat.

Iron Man fisted both hands in his shirt, seething, “You can’t have it,
He listened, anyway, like a telegraph receiving an encoded message, his attention totally focused on Tony as he drew.  He was meticulous about it, but he added each layer on top of the previous one, complaining briefly, “I can’t splice this,” before flipping to another page, hastily drawing his original wheel, and carrying on at a new level of detail.
They met Natasha at the hotel.
Tony whistled once, telling himself that dragon hearing was only so acute, that Marker had been alone for almost a century and was now surrounded by dragons, that he knew Marker and Marker knew him, and Gravemarker would never leave him.
They could have been explorers mapping the wilderness in the mid-1800s, a time so distant yet so real to him.  Clint would have joined the Lewis and Clarke expedition, standing on the brink, shouting into the wind in drowned-out exultation.  Bruce, the scientist, might have tagged along, huddled against Clint’s back, apparently not caring who was shielding him as long as it was not his own destructive alter ego.

If Steve heard a word Tony said, he gave no indication, watching the seal with intent.  “You
Tony pivoted audibly on the rocks towards Bruce, who was sitting next to him.  “How much weed did you put in that cake?”
A small, chalk-white figure peered down at him, huge black eyes disconcertingly void of irises.  Tony held perfectly still, even as the Nibiran reached out, touched his cheek.

There was a long silence.

Steve kissed his forehead.  Tony closed his eyes.

Captain America stepped forward, cowl up but looking dangerous, like the wolf who had come to chastise the pack for misbehavior, his gaze alighting on Pierce with unexpected malevolence.  “This seemed more important," Cap explained.  After a long beat, he added,
He heard the very distinct chatter of Happy and Tony conversing, but none of their words made sense to him.  It was like they were speaking in Greek.  He huffed in a breath.  What was he doing?  What was he doing, hurting these people?
, frantic to find the way out.
. o .
The floor creaked when they stepped inside, but the rest of the interior was eerily quiet.  It had also been tidied up, erasing all traces of their presence.  Immediately, Steve knew that Natasha was gone.
“You made a phone call to my brain,” Tony said at last.
“What of their poisonous fangs?” Stovok reminded dryly, taking a seat in the vacated chair.
The grim hours that ensued brought Steve back down to Earth.  He appreciated the layout of the day—the heavier events offset by the lighter ones—but nothing could make the wreath he laid at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier any lighter.
“You weren’t in the doorway two seconds ago,” Tony announced.
Offering a new approach—softness instead of hardness—Steve offered, “I could carry you.”
Steve gave him a squeeze of approval.  Tony made a sound like he wanted to comment but decided against it at the last moment.
.  Almost shaking with pent-up energy, Tony said carefully, “We come in peace,” and multiple hands patted him on the shoulders.  “Huh.  You know that one—
“Not on my watch, Doctor,” Stovok said firmly, then turned back to the improbably narrow chasm at their feet, maybe half a meter deep.  Tony shook his head to himself, resolving to freeze to death or climb back up the mountain and take his chance with the natives, even as Stovok lowered himself to the ground and slithered into the hole, like it was easy.
He could feel the thunder, the crushing weight of an ungraspable and yet highly tangible sum of water striking the river far below.  It was so incongruous—a tame river morphing into the violence of the Falls, only to mellow out again at the base into another river—as to jar the mind.  He wondered what people who had never been to war thought of the transition point, the loud, loud, loud way a river could simply fall off a cliff.
“I know what you meant,” Tony dismissed.  “You’re a very plain person.”
Rhodes wisely opted to keep his presents behind a locked door, but he did accept a mug of fresh coffee from Steve with a nod of thanks.  Marker warbled joyfully around the largest cow bone Steve could procure; Snow declined to make an appearance, which was probably for the best.  Steve disappeared to spend time with her, which was fine by Tony—he could hardly complain that Steve was not there for him enough.
Steve sighed.
Blue-tinted Actinium sniffed around the doorframe, then clicked a few times.  Tiberius stood up, venturing over, and before Tony could formulate a protest, grasped the honey-badger-sized animal under both forearms and hoisted him into the air.  Actinium stared at him.  “Where on Earth did you find it?” Tiberius asked wonderingly.
“Nah, I get under everyone’s skin,” Tony murmured.  Steve felt the surreptitious weight of a knee against his own, a mute thank-you, before Tony waved a hand to dispel the conversational smoke and went on, “Although, I do have to say, I’m surprised at you two.  Continental breakfast?  There’s a Vietnamese shop not three blocks from here.  You’d love pho.  That is—if you’re not too full on bread.”

While accruing vast swaths of wealth was somewhat frowned upon, Tony managed to get by on good will, proliferating his technology and solving problems across the galaxy.  He enjoyed few things more than spending time on the experimental vessels, messing around with the warp drive until he was on the brink of breakthrough or cataclysm.

“It’s got heart,” Steve said.
“Tch.  Crowd-pleaser,” Tony muttered, hiding behind a short wall.  He gave Steve a look that said,
Steve breathed easily, shield at the ready, guarding his chest, his throat.  “You may want to consider a different wardrobe,” Hill advised.  “If you’re serious about laying low.”
The decapitated Stark pointed at him.  “Pretty

“Thanks, Dad,” Tony said, hanging up.  “Such a sweetheart.  Speaking of, we hear from Romanoff yet?”
“What gives?” Tony grumbled.
Even Bruce froze.
“I’m only human,” he managed.
He did not respond to his own name.  He found the white dragon, lounging in the freezing space—the west coast was warm, but Snow came from the north, and she preferred the arctic chill that they had so carefully upheld for her.  She had four hatchlings around her—purple Iodine, blue Actinium, jet black Barium, silver Ferrum.  Her black eyes bored into him, full of noiseless nothing.  There was no compassion, no sorrow, no hint of surprise or curiosity.  If she cared about the fate of his dragon, it did not show.
“French toast,” Bruce corrected without looking up from the page.
Steve matched his pace.  “Tony, without your suit, you . . .”
“I am surprised they are not attacking us,” Stovok observed, still standing near the pilot’s chair but watching closely as a Gorn appeared in the open bay doors, looked around the interior, and then stomped back over to Thor, joining the others.

Affronted, Tony pointed out, “Just because I didn’t

It would have been easy to grab Tony by the collar, pull him back onto the sheet of ice, insist that they stay aboveground.
Tony fished them out with a long pole, grumbling about billionaires needing to be their own pool boys.  He twisted the wrong way and his back went numb; terror gripped him as he dropped the pole reflexively, struggling to stay upright, away from the water’s edge.
Then he offered it to Tony.
“Well, clearly,” Tony said, swiping the pencil from Clint and vigorously erasing

“Tony,” Steve warned.  That was the real question that demanded the real answer—
“I am your people.  You call me,” Mayor Cuff said firmly.  “If you need something, I’m all ears, Mr. Stark.”

“Let me up,” he gasped, and he meant,
“See this?  This is what I

, but Tony gulped down a shallow breath, anyway.  “Stark!” Thor said, tears in his eyes, gripping Tony in a surprisingly gentle hug that almost pushed the pain aside.  “You return to us!”
Tony said, “Nice work, Smokey,” and pulled out a cutting knife.  “Who wants to bet I can slice the cake from this distance?”
He was also born half-Vulcan.  Shaking his head to himself, Tony startled when a white hand jutted out of the hole in the ground expectantly.
Steve gave him a pointed look.  “Why?”
Steve shook his head, not in negation but: “Above my paygrade.”  It was like fine art; he was there to look, not touch.  If he needed a ride, he could buy a share—the thought of owning a vehicle, even his own bike, was wishful thinking, borderline dangerous.  Envy had driven many men mad over the years.  He could not want outside his means.
It was Bruce who said, “That’d be nice.”
Steve got to a knee so he could use both hands to rub the bloodhound’s furry head.  “If I knew, I’d tell ya,” he said truthfully.  “Just trying to get out of the city, I guess.”
Shaking his head, Steve said, “Thank you, Bruce,” as Bruce gave him a slice.
Tony helpfully brushed some snow off.  What a nice guy, Steve thought dryly, giving him a firm,
“We ask,” Sojef began, and then faltered visibly, turning his chin inward in mourning before lifting it and carrying on, “that you think of the children.  They have never known mourning.  Should death befall those around them—it would prove a terrible shock.”

“Ah,” Thor said, in that delighted,
“Oh, no—Stark doesn’t plan anything,” Natasha chimed in, making Tony startle as she materialized behind him.  “He just falls and hopes somebody else catches him.”
In shouting distance, he called out, “STOVOK!” and the Vulcan looked up.  Although flushed green, he looked dauntless as ever, a huge silver something strung across his back.  As Tony halted, Stovok crossed the distance between them in long strides, easily outpacing the slow-moving Nibirans shuffling along behind him.
Folding his arms over his chest, Tony pulled his ballcap down over his eyes.

Steve elaborated with toneless calm, “She tried.  Nothing doin’, there, either.”  Tony blinked, surprised, not following, as Steve went on, “So, I—asked the Mind Stone.”
Vibrant.  Still living.
Rolling his eyes, Tony said, “I didn’t make him up.”  He pulled out his telephone, then pocketed it again, saying firmly, “No, you know what?  You have to earn it.”
“Why not?” Tony prodded, mean-spirited, knowing full well the answer.
There were no words between them, no exchange of thoughts, yet he knew Marker’s wishes, for they were his own.
“Uh.  Sure,” Tony said, even though Stovok stared at him in strong rebuke.  “Love to.”

.  About anything.  The roads, the weather, the state of Ohio (“Name one good thing about Ohio;” “. . . The Wright brothers;” “That’s—Steve, be quiet”).  Above all else, Tony complained about the seating arrangement.
Steve grabbed him by the back of his shirt to pick him up.  Bruce growled, low and leonine.  Steve froze.  Everyone else did, too.  Then Bruce yawned tamely, “I love nature,” and allowed Steve to carefully pick him up.  Steve set him on his feet, giving him a gentle nudge in the right direction.  Bruce went.
Cap took him up.  “Nice of you,” Rogers acknowledged.
Tony’s breath hitched.  It hurt.  He gripped a hank of his own shirt, right over the hole in his chest, furiously.
.  I want him
“Tony, no,” Steve rebuked, wrapping an arm around his waist as Tony clambered up onto the counter to make good on his mental threat, parking him back on the floor.  “If you want cookies—”
“Kind of begging the universe to let a hog tip you,” Tony said, sitting on the sidelines, Bruce at his side.
2:22 A.M.
Correction: They met Natasha
“Had to make a pitstop,” Natasha explained, holding up a package of long sticks.  “Hope I’m not too late.”
One of the Nibirans passed him a coconut-shaped object.  Tony’s growling stomach warred with his scientific mind.  Consumable materials were so rarely compatible among different races that alien delicacies were considered the gems of the consumer market.  Life loved to experience all that the universe had to offer, but few things were more incompatible than digestive systems.  Hell, even Vulcans refused Terran foods, and they could practically suck nutrients out of
Steve was not a daffodil enthusiast.  But it was hard to be sour around Thor.
.”  Tony did not move an inch.  Steve detected sarcasm.
Steve did not move a muscle.
He knew he was suffering.  He already knew it.  He just wanted space to let his wounds cauterize themselves.
“No shit?” Tony said, surprised.  “Wow.  Isn’t he—”
Tony blinked.  “Like what?”
“Spelunking?”
“Gee, Rico,” Steve acknowledged, still holding his cat burrito in one arm and a rather eclectic assortment of cat items in various bags in the other.  “You know what I used to play with when I was a boy?  Sticks and mud.”  He shook his head to himself, but nevertheless nearly poked his own eye out on the cat “feather teaser” that kept swinging around inopportunely at every corner street.  “Rocks, if we were really feelin’ rich,” Steve added, shaking off once at the doorstep, fumbling for the keys.  He plugged the keys into the hole and turned the handle.  Gratefully, he set down the cat stuff—including litter, box, food and bowls, and accursed feather teaser—and finally unleashed Rico on society, even if society was a house of one.
fashion.  “This is Steve Rogers, ma’am,” he replied.  Very nearly in slow motion, Tony thumped his own forehead with an open palm.
“Everybody’s just a fucking comedian,” Tony Stark declared, storming off for a shower.
Steve let out his own quiet sigh of relief, waiting a full twenty minutes to be absolutely sure Tony was out before beginning the painstaking process of shuffling away.
.  Each letter would be sent to a distinguished soldier.  It seemed like a good cause, although Steve joked that he expected a room full of letters waiting for him elsewhere.  To his relief, the peanut gallery laughed.
Well, Tony was entitled to his opinions, too, Steve supposed, taking a few moments to be grateful that Tony was not a mule.  Mules had better aim and harder footwear.  Revising the plan, Steve moved away from the bed and said decisively, “All right, I’ll make coffee first.”
The spear tip moved away.  The Nibiran said something—Stovok could only offer a rather tame-sounding agreement, consonants without vowels—before moving back to rejoin his own family, posture relaxed.  They seemed at greater ease as the elder said something to them, spears replaced in carrying positions.
.)  To call it a parasite—its metal claws anchored in his blood red bone, its cold metal flesh leeching the heat off his endothermic body—was to articulate the give-take of the matter.  He fed it, cleaned it, and protected it from external intrusions; in return, it protected him from the flock of shrapnel pieces lurking inside his own body.
Natasha squeezed his arm briefly, then let go.  A paranoid part of him wondered if it was a signal—maybe Clint was in trouble, or Tony was hiding a wound, or, God forbid, something was mangling Bruce.
Thor plucked a jar of M&M’s off the shelf, scooped out a tiny handful, and popped them in his mouth.  He chewed them slowly, then beamed.
to you?”
Tony gave him an unimpressed look.  “You can share Ginger,” he dismissed.
“I get it,” Tony said smugly.
Steve inhaled through his nose, softly and deeply.  “I can’t give you false hope, Tony.”
“What?” Bruce asked.  “What does that mean?”
After two hours of spirited debate and a full loop around the planet, the crew of the
Steve sighed.  So much for compromise.
Breathing in harshly, Tony exhaled and said, “No.  You don’t.”  Pushing himself off the wall, he made himself step closer.  It was like approaching a gravity well.  He knew he could get too close, could not even see that line.  But he could not show fear, either.  “You don’t know
Steve ignored him.  “I said,
“Exactly.”  She lowered her uniform.  He blinked.  “My scars are gone.  Yours are, too.”
“Indoor voices, people,” Tony complained, looking around the suite with a mixed air of skepticism and discreet pleasure.  “Low-profile, budget-friendly, huh?”
Bruce paled.  Clint corrected, “One of us is.”
“I know what it is,” Tony grumbled.  Then he peeled a cookie dough ball off the tray and sighed euphorically, “Come to

Having a dragon at one’s side represented social status, too.  Those who had dragons beside them were considered very special, elevated above the average.  Simply having the love of a dragon was a rare and exciting thing.
“No sign of Clint or Thor?” Steve prompted, one hand resting bracingly on the small of Tony’s back as he drew in a deep breath, trying to catch his breath.  Tony did not notice; Steve knew he would have moved away if he did.  Bruce noticed; Bruce looked deeply into his glass, like it held secrets, too.
Tony was relaxing in his quarters when the door slid open.  “Uh,
.  “I just—”
“Stopped listening halfway through that sentence,” Tony announced.
“Monkey in the middle!” Clint crowed, tackling the proffered hammer.
, he thought to himself.
.  “You could get hurt,” Steve said, which was not much better.  Imagining Tony all crumpled up did awful things to him.  He would not let it happen.  “You need a suit.”
“Of course you can’t.  What are you, some kind of psychic?  Know the fate of the Universe?”
, and I’m about to become the—Thor’s in the water.”
Vulcans were terrifically strong.  Tony dug in his heels.  He’d rather gnaw off his own arm.  He was about to hysterically threaten it when Stovok paused suddenly, clarity in his smooth shoulders.
He stiffened.  “You hear that?”
And then, at last, Steve drifted into sleep.
Then he awoke with his chest in pieces.  The splintering noisy agonized feeling inside him was irrepressible.  It was hot, rampant, and fast-moving, like an overheating piece of machinery that needed to be cut at the cord, too dangerous to unplug.  He breathed shallowly through his mouth, too hurt to scream.
“I don’t need your help or your pity,” Steve snapped.
Taking the telephone from Tony’s open palm, Steve greeted neutrally, “Rogers.”
Steve blinked once, slowly.  He looked right at Hill, even as Natasha stepped back, inviting him in.
“Klingon?” Hill prompted, holding a mug in one hand, an aromatic tea oozing from it.
“I shall escort you, fair lady,” Thor volunteered, which was gracious of him, until Steve realized Thor was leaving
“Royalty,” Mayor Cuff said, offering a gracious bow of the head.  “You surround yourself with interesting people, Mr. Stark.”
His knees went weak.  Too proud to fall, he put a hand on the frozen wall and controlled his descent, letting his legs fold in the pebbly gravel.
For some strange reason, accepting orders to “subdue members of a violent alien race, preferably without remorse” made more sense to Steve Rogers than futuristic airports.
, he had called the beast, and Gravemarker had accepted his new name, responded to every cheerless and loving alternative Tony had come up with.
Iron Man said, kicking his metal feet comfortably, looking out over New York.
Somberly, he said, “I apologize.”
“I should drive,” Tony insisted.  Looking out the window, he complained, “I don’t like—it’s giving me a headache.”
“Uh-huh,” Steve said, glaring at the landline with real ire as it failed to reveal its secrets to him, unplugging the cord.  Natasha laid a hand on Steve’s arm.  To have words with him.
“Good
And then, sonuvabitch, he actually fell asleep.
“When you said it like that, it sounds weird,” Steve told him.
“Mm,” Tony said ambiguously, stealing a fry from Steve’s basket, ignoring the instinctively rebuking look Steve gave him.  “See, I thought you were on

“Be quiet,” Steve snapped.  His head was pounding, but at least he did not have to speak to the Canadian Mounties about the heroic rescue Thor had made of an “unidentified civilian.”  Bruce and Clint had been roped into going to the precinct: Bruce to bridge the cultural gap, Clint to star as the “unidentified civilian.”  Clint had even donated his shirt to Steve and dumped a bottle of water over his own head to lend credibility to the story.
He dreamed of Vulcan red, and Earth green, and Tony blue.
“Have I mentioned how much I hate space?” he said softly.
“What’s Plan B?”
“How’s the prune juice?” Steve prompted.
,” Tony grunted, spinning back to the console.  “You’re not here.  You can’t make a report.”  He took the wheel and sped up for the hell of it, pushing the sub-warp capacities of the ship.  “And I’m not talkin’ to you.”
“Tell me I’m wrong,” Tony said dryly, grabbing a pen from the nearest plastic box.  “I’ll sign hoods, but then I want you kids

“I enjoy working with Captain Carter,” Stovok deferred, looking up at him.  “I would miss working with her.”
It was also shared by Steve Rogers.
Barnes placed a hand on his knee and squeezed it.  “You know these guys.  They just want to keep us on our toes.  Keep us afraid of them, so they can operate outside the rule of law.”
“But?”
“Many, many words with you,” Tony warned him.  “Like: ‘get out of my brain’ and ‘who invited you here?’”
A rueful smirk crossed Steve’s face.  “Myself.”  When Tony’s expression smoothed back into shuttered indifference, he added, “He won’t—he won’t understand, Tony.”
“Are you okay?” the monster repeated, voice shifting, no longer neutral with concern but calm with reassurance.  Tony knew, instantly, that he would not win the battle of wills, that he was too encumbered to even lift an arm to fight.  Hating himself for it, he released the handle and staggered away from the door.  It opened immediately.
“What brings you out to the boondocks?” Tony asked Steve.
.  Words with you.”
“You know, for a genius, you can be a little dense sometimes,” Steve muttered, fishing out his room key, miraculously keeping his cargo on his back.
Only Marker could make such unspoken promises—because only Marker was a dragon.
“Well, ain’t that a bitch,” Tony said, ignoring Stovok’s rebuking look.
Steve tried to coax Rico to play with the feather teaser, but Rico seemed to prefer the sticks-and-mud-and-rocks-if-we’re-feeling-rich approach: he shredded unattended bags of cut oats and gnawed on Steve’s newest pair of shoes to his purring heart’s content.  And he pissed on the floor.  Still not a fan of boxes.  The Google said it could take four weeks to litterbox train a cat.  Steve figured that was just proof that everyone was a work-in-progress.

Stovok’s expression did not change.

Steve sighed, but he took a bite, then tried and failed to suppress a smile.  Tony ribbed, “See, I told you.”
Steve shook his head.  Tony waved his hand again, a vague
They screeched to an improbable halt eight minutes later.
A heavy hand landed on his upper arm.  For a moment, Tony expected a speech, about bravery, courage, triumphing over adversity.  But Stovok just released him and offered kindly, “I can proceed.  I can pull you through.”
.”  The anger came back, a shaking frantic thing.  Steve stepped towards Tony, and one tiny fraction of a flinch was all it took to cow him.  “Please.  I can’t—”  He deflated, almost sat down, so sickening was his defeat.
“I’m . . .”  Heaving in a breath, Iron Man suddenly moved away from the wall and began to pace, in a drunken, disorderly manner, a grotesque, human-sized puppet.  “This is bad,” he said softly.  “I’m fucked.”
, Tony thought, as Steve toed the severed broom head aside and picked up the cord instead, plugging it back into the wall.  The vacuum came alive.
.  What the hell did it matter if Tony Stark had a will?  A strong desire to suffer alone, away from them and their godless acts of salvation?
Soulful, sad eyes fixed on him, Bruce repeated again, “
and wonder how it came to this?” Tony mused.  “An id-based rage monster, a Norse god who literally doesn’t know any better, and a former clown with a killer streak?”
The Coleman Fruit Farm and Cider Mill was hardly the place Tony Stark, billionaire tech mogul, would be expected to stop by on a lazy summer’s morning.  But it did boast fresh strawberries.
The unreadable expression melted into something softer.  “I’ll be back.”
“Is that what you call them?” Anij asked.  She gestured at her forehead, drawing striations curving upwards.
4:04 P.M.;
Steve glared at him.  Tony held his gaze passively, then reached suddenly into his pocket, pulling out Steve’s journal.  “Dropped that.”
Almost.
For a beat, Steve thought Thor would rebuke Tony for trivializing a clearly important matter.  But Thor’s face bloomed with another smile, his big hand latching onto Tony’s shoulder briefly.  “You are trouble, Stark,” he said, but he said it fondly.  Then the smile slipped away.  Without a word, Thor slipped away, rejoining Natasha, who had managed to corral Bruce, farther along the footpath.  He painted on the smile for them again, inquiring buoyantly about another statue.
.  As part of the unspoken agreement between dragons and humans, each new companion had a new name.  In nature, Radon was radioactive, bright yellow and enigmatic—a fitting name for the sun-yellow creature that dominated Tony’s childhood.  As they both grew older, Tony’s hair threatened to gray, while with each yearly shed, Marker’s scales metallicized.
Steve’s hands shook as he gathered up his coat.  He did not need it, but he hated not having one around.  Who knew what would happen if he woke up in the arctic without one?
Happy fixed Steve with a stern glare.  “And you,” he said.  “You’re trouble.”
Tony just whistled, replacing his wallet in his pocket, waiting.
Instead, he froze as a strange fuzzy noise filled his head, and he felt not the thoughts themselves but the shape of them, a yellowish glow that radiated joy tinted a somber blue that radiated worry . . . deep, stormy purple, dismayed, unsure, followed by waves of green—green like grass, green like a world he had never seen.

“I’m afraid he’s not for sale,” Juliet said carefully.
but he was too focused on moving forward,
Grimacing back at him, Tony waved a hand.  “Just—make it snappy, all right?”  Then, reaching up, almost proprietarily, he straightened the uniform over Steve’s shoulders, stopped himself from smoothing down his hair by brushing a thumb past an ear quickly instead.  “I’ll see if I can’t rodeo that case back.”
Tony said, “About
“It’s also an empty brick building,” Natasha chimed in, tucking an arm around Tony’s in a familiar way, stilling his pacing, “that sentimental old men revere.”

Sighing, Tony sat down on the couch, letting an arm flop over the back, mentally resolving to send both Jimmy and Pepper flowers, simply for dealing with his existence.  “Send him to Nick,” he said decisively.
“I need this,” Clint said, holding up a metal rooster.
For the days before Tony had a life-altering stroke.
“Don’t slip,” Tony said quietly, as if speaking too loudly would amplify the danger.  The rock shelf narrowed instantly, from a comfortable lip to a nauseatingly narrow footpath, clearly carved by many travelers over centuries of traverses.  Tony noticed that a groove had formed along the wall, the work of thousands of grasping hands, daring to venture where no man had ever gone before.
Tony just laughed at him.
By 0630, it was Steve Rogers’ favorite time of the day:
“I had no idea you were such a daffodil enthusiast,” Tony drawled, but he let it go.
Dr. Banner and Tony exchanged a look.
tried to remove a burning log from the fire pit.
The heat of it drew the ache out of Tony’s bones.  Marker’s presence, quiet and almost uncertain as it was, drew an ache out of his soul.  The golden dragon had made his way indoors and curled up in the far corner, watching him intently.  Tony could feel the questions in those black eyes, but he offered no answers.  He cast no blame, either, although a part of him wanted to.
For an impossibly long moment, Steve did not move, staring at him, then Snow.
“’A national treasure,’” Bruce parroted quietly, sitting at a rounded table with his back to the stunning city panorama.  In front of him, a small noisy coffee machine hissed loudly.  Bruce seemed oblivious to the noise, head in both hands, looking like he would rather turn in early for the night than attend any kind of festivities.  Tony, who had his second wind, did not appear to be offering any
They took five.
His lousy human ears could not make out a response over the sound of Clint and Natasha scuffling and Bruce rhapsodizing about his teammates.
“What do we do?” Steve asked.
Then, slowly, Steve—pet him.
“Strike?”  Looking at the coffee, Tony added, “No, I just don’t drink drip coffee.”  He stepped outside, slid the door shut behind him, and looked around.  “You wanna go look at some flowers?  I’ve heard good things about the Conservatory.  I haven’t seen any flowers in a while.  Nobody buys the billionaire any flowers.”  Lifting his coffee, Tony gulped it down, then added, “Oh, and, I wanna show you the playboy mansion.  It’s a national treasure.”
“It is well,” Thor assured, returning with improbable speed from the little convenience store with a handful of rope.  “I shall secure Smoked One to the rooftop.”

Stovok sat back on his heels for a long moment, looking at what he had made and the children had expanded upon, and then, at last, murmured, “I must finish what I have started.”
Confident that he could beat the runner, Steve loped easily towards first base, and he rolled easily into a fence as Thor crashed into him.
Tony nearly fell off his throne.  The cloaked figure never came into view, but Tony knew that voice.  “God damn you,” Tony deadpanned, shifting to a seated position.  “You son of a bitch.  You’re here to torment me, aren’t you?”

To his surprise, Tony rasped, “Don’t.”
“And can we help you.  And can we fix you.  And you must understand, as we are acting in your best interests, these are not questions.  No, questions preserve the right to decline, to abstain, to object.  Your right to object has been
smart; I can see why Stovok likes you so much,” Tony observed, then shrank a little under her glare.  “I’m listening, I’m listening.  You think they’ll let us take our own samples?”
Steve looked him over once, pointedly.
“Yes.  Yup,” Tony agreed, ignoring Stovok’s heavy look, helmet turned towards him but expression hidden behind the black glass.  “We bow to your majesty.”

Natasha pulled a black backpack out of the backseat and tossed it at him.  “Red is for the job.”
Nodding once, Steve said, “It’s not all bad,” and then offered a parting pat to Ezekiel’s—or was it Jeremiah’s?—head.  “I’ll be seein’ ya.”
“Missed like Miss Carter or—”
Yet somehow vulnerable, immensely breakable.  The parasite in his chest seemed especially insidious, yet covered in blankets, no one could see it.  Steve understood why Tony hid it.
The sub-rigorous application of the monster’s true strength failed.  A second, more rigorous application would not.  Tony knew this.  Tony held on anyway.
Drawing in a breath through his nose, Steve said, “I’ll check it out.  You two stay here.”

“I’ve heard good things about them,” Natasha prodded.
“A lot has changed in three centuries,” Liaison Hill assured.  “We can be very discreet.  We won’t infringe on your colony.”
“Uh-huh,” Tony muttered, the first and only thing he had said for the duration of the trek, and Steve supposed that was a pretty good repayment.  The warmth against his back was not entirely bad, either.  Illinoisan nights in early May were almost as brisk as New York nights—the joys of living on coastal waters, Steve mused.
Staring at the cat and the distinguished shoe, Steve thought out loud, “. . . Cat litter.”  Rico plopped himself on his rump and looked up at Steve.  “I did forget cat litter,” Steve acknowledged.
Tony said, “Stuff.”  Which was code for:
“My first and most universally acknowledged attribute.  Kindness.  Right, Bruce?” Tony said, looking at Bruce.
Thor stepped into frame, wearing only a loincloth and carrying a spear.  “Might I have the first kill?” he asked.  Without waiting for an answer, Thor lofted the spear.  “
“Good night,” Steve said again for good measure.  The woman nodded again.  The elevator doors shut.
“Really?”
“Live alone, die alone,” Tony thought, skin crawling at the memory of the Nightmare in the skies, taking him out without remorse.  “Tough life.”
.  I have never been that
“Then why are we here?” Natasha prompted.
Thor looked genuinely put out, one hand planted next to a block supporting a bear statue.  Bruce looked relieved.  Natasha looked indifferent.
.  “J.A.R.V.I.S., grab one of the—heating pads, you know where they’re at.”  The suit vacated the couch, and although Tony stepped around so he could fix the straps on the splint.  Steve immediately tried to thwart him, one big hand resting directly over the undone straps.  “You let
“No,” Tony said stubbornly.  He paced away and parked himself on a large rock off to one side, insisting, “I will stay right here.”
.  “Are you even listening to me?” he asked.
Thallium laid her own head back down on Tony’s chest.

“But you could,” Sojef said.  Tony whirled sharply.  Even Anij looked aghast, staring at Sojef.  The other members of Starfleet could not have sat more at attention as Sojef disclosed, “The metaphasic radiation is found in the ice crystals.  All you would have to do is harvest it.”
“No,” Tony interrupted again.  Steve understood why he had been kicked in the shin, twice.  “No.”  Then Tony surgically extracted one card from each of the three piles before placing the trio into a small envelope.  “The killer,” he announced, laying the packet on top of the board.  “The weapon,” he added, distributing a handful of silver trinkets across the board.  “And the scene of the crime,” he added, tapping one corner labeled

“That’s enough,” Tony said.
“I feel you have forgotten that they are already dissidents,” intruded another elder.  “Hopeless detractors.  They disowned themselves.  This is not our concern.  It is between the Terrans and the Romulans.”
And it probably had something to do with the fact that the Avengers were the biggest celebrities in town.

“Hold on,” Steve grumbled.
Marker blinked, utterly unreadable.
“Different culture,” Bruce piped in meekly.  “Can’t expect—”
Half-listening, Steve echoed, “. . . The High Mountains?”
Tony chose not to answer.
“Fuck you, too,” Tony said in response, taking a bite.  “Mm.  Charcoal.”
“It is true,” agreed the first elder.  “We have nothing to gain through negotiations.  “We have nothing to lose by their extinction.”
“Now what?” Tony asked him.
Steve frowned more.  He had not revealed his plans in advance.  He had
Tony sat out on the front lawn, like a kid, waiting anxiously for his dragon.
“C’mon, upsetting the neighbors is a

Steve warned, “Leave that in, you probably need it.”
“Good.”  Thor turned away again, facing the front of the transport vessel.
“No.  Go make it up to him,” Clint ordered.  At Steve’s expression, he gave Steve an encouraging shove in the right direction.  “I will not have Operation
Steve rolled his eyes.  “Where’s Thor,” he repeated, no-nonsense.
Lang let the door clang audibly behind him.  Steve had the distinct impression that Lang stood just on the other side of it, like a bodyguard.  He didn’t care.  They were alone.
“It’s so
Clint roared back into the parking lot, tires squealing as he braked.
“What gave it away?” Tony asked.
. o .
Tony nodded slowly.  He seemed tired and overwrought, too.
Tony tossed back the rest of his scotch in one gulp.  “Cheers to becoming cranky old men.”  He spun his chair carefully to watch Tellurium glare at the pool, her little wings extended to their full height.  “She’s a terror.”
“What the hell is fluoride?”
Yours truly,
“We beamed you onto a ship that did not exist,” Fury said.  “You landed on the closest world.”
Realization dawned on Stovok.  Tony could feel his surprise in the air—red, like the Briar Patch.  “You left the planet?”
“Lucky number seventeen,” Clint announced, cracking his knuckles.
Clint pushed back his chair and reclaimed his takeout with a triumphant little laugh.  They all watched him cackle maniacally to himself as he abandoned the room, slamming the bedroom door shut behind him.
“Oh, please,” Tony sighed, taking the mug in both hands, “you were an angel.”
.  “Get,” Tony gritted out.
Stovok inhaled a long breath through his nose, more annoyed than worried.  “Vulcans do not take carnal pleasures lightly,” he said at last.
Instead, Steve shut his own eyes and rested his cheek against the top of Iron Man’s head, absorbing the magnitude of his presence.
. o .
At least Clint said, “I got something,” but the gentleman cried out,
Despite years of surveying, it remained an unbreachable vacuum, indifferent to their attempts to negotiate with it.  Full of pinpricks of light and even smaller collections of celestial dust, some home to life, some of which was naïve enough to believe itself capable of controlling the game, space was beyond understanding.  It was terrifying.  And exhilarating.
Tony thumbed the strange Rorschach blotch on the front of Steve’s hoodie.  Steve looked at it critically.  “. . . Is that what it is?”
“We’re ready to fly,” Romanova announced.  “Buckle up, boys.”
Eyes stinging with the remnants of the liquor, Steve said in a slightly snuffly voice, “I hate your guts, Stark.”
Steve clicked the radio again.  Something that passed for music filled the car.  Tony bemoaned, “Absolutely not.”
“Not enough time to explain,” Tony replied.
“You are really talented,” Steve told her, because somebody ought to, and Thor was too busy learning and Tony staring in silent interest to remark upon it.  “What’s the point?”
He was not an item on Steve’s to do list, a project to be finished, a fascinating specimen to ogle over or a terrible man to be derided for his bad decisions.
Steve squeezed him gently.  It did not hurt.

.  The war was won and the girl was gone.  Next question?
Shaking his head, Tony said, “This is the high ground.”  He gestured around.  “Shouldn’t we keep it?”  He thumbed the huge volcano at his back, maybe ten kilometers on foot.  “Or we could—”
Like Iodine, Tony had not spent much time with either hatchling.  Getting too close to Snow was a no-go; that meant waiting, hoping the hatchlings would come to him.  He came to long for their intrusions, for any proof that he was still worthy of a dragon.  Even just a little one.
The incredulity prompted Stovok to interject, “Let her speak.”
He stalked across the bridge, ignoring Barton and Romanova and their pristine contracts, nearly smashing the elevator button.
.  “Well, points for accuracy,” Tony huffed, still holding his good hand, bringing it down to rest on a knee.  “Leave it,” he insisted.
He then stacked the remaining cards into a single pile, shuffled them again, and began distributing them.

“You wanted . . . to see if I was weak.”
Steve recited frankly, “One minute,” like he would uphold the bargain.
“. . . Wow.”
“Sweet,” Clint said, sliding in the driver’s seat and revving up the car.
“It smells like poison,” Steve insisted.  “Is it poison?”
Breathing in through his nose, Steve said, “You won’t be sleeping here.”
When she tried to sell him something else, he insisted, “No, I don’t want any frills, I just want New York, dammit, a ticket to New York,” and was swiftly escorted by another security guard to a separate room, under the false promise of being reasoned with.
“Knowing you, Stark, I would assume it to be none of these things,” Thor rebutted lightly.  “You should come to my hearth,” Thor insisted suddenly, laying a palm flat on the table, “and I will have my finest cooks prepare you a meal.  You all are such starved creatures.”  He stacked another plate on an already precarious six-plate pile, then shook his head.  “It is like attending to starving dogs.  Eat,” he insisted, putting the berry bowl in front of Bruce, who dutifully reached up and plucked one off without looking up from his book.  “A warrior must upkeep his strength.”

“But could it fix your roof?”
Dispirited and evidently tired of arguing with Logic Personified, Dr. Banner took a hard seat on the ground.  “How the hell do we get out of this one?” he asked.  “No, really, Commander.
Tony stood, frozen, inarticulate, uncomprehending.

Tony thumped a fist on the closed door.  The music paused.  “Password?” Clint asked.
“Monkeys?” Thor, a huge security officer who was one of the few Hirogens who did not hunt humans for sport, intruded.  “I do not understand—”
Rolling his eyes, Tony gave himself a minor concussion backing out of the hole—
Clint really was a Blue Heeler.  He could jump four feet into the air.
And nothing bad happened.  No other monsters burst through the door.  No life-changing agony split open his chest.  No demands were made.
A classical brick four-story, the Mansion hardly looked like the kind of place where indecent affairs would be conducted.  Indeed, if Tony had said that it was an art school, Steve would not have batted an eyelash.
As carefully as he could, he drifted away from the ocean, the pier, the party.
“I’ll buy,” he offered, a compromise he felt transcended time, transcended tastes.  Three sets of eyes affixed on him.  “You—everybody’s gotta eat,” he clarified.  “Let me buy.”
Steve’s gut twisted up with shame.  “I don’t know,” he admitted.
“You could
“I plied Fury’s secrets and sent the location to interested parties,” Tony sniffed.  “Interested parties being myself, of course.
“How did you find this place?” Tony asked, intrigued despite his reservations.
Tony shut the transport doors firmly.  “Uh-uh.  Next, you’ll find out their saliva is poisonous.”

Steve wondered, as Natasha and Tony trailed behind them, arguing, while Bruce clung to Steve’s sleeve like a man hanging over a pit of piranha-infested waters.
“Guess bein’ rich has its perks,” Steve deadpanned.
“Tony, you’re not supposed to

“And who gave
Steve seemed equal parts floored and relieved at the news.
“Do you have to call them that?”
“Dragons, for you,” Tony agreed.  “No two are alike.”
At last, Thor relieved him by scooping up Mjolnir.  Steve let Clint drop; Thor tossed the hammer once into the air, silently considering something.  “What plans have you for us, Stark?” he asked, tone very odd, trying and failing to be idle.

—and arrive at the present moment, where Tony Stark stood in his laboratory, scraping a soft-pawed hand over his benumbed chest, careful not to press on it, spark any enmity between him and the heartless metal monster inside him.  The parasite clung tightly to his ribs, which meant only hard pressure really counted: a hug would not necessarily leave him teary-eyed, but a direct blow could be lethal, and given that the blue light was essentially a
Slowly, painstakingly, Tony lifted his own arm, and curved a hand in the back of Steve’s shirt, clinging back mutely, the only source of light left in the darkness.
“Foot massage,” Tony deadpanned, wiggling his toes.  Steve gave him an unimpressed look.  “What?  It’s Christmas.”
. o .
, he thought.
“I’m not gonna.”  Tony hiccupped once.  “What the hell were you doing down there?”
“Fair Lady,” Thor greeted, his voice the only force on Earth, Steve suspected, capable of dousing confrontational fires across interspecies.  “Care to adventure with us?”
“Would ya shuddup already?” Steve quelled as they reached the door.  “It’s too early.”
Standing by and slightly ahead of schedule, Steve signed 1,752 letters with his trademark
He could have sobbed as it faded all the way to the shoulder.
He could see why his father had brought a troubled Vulcan on board the U.S.S.
“That is not what—”
“And the cider,” Aislinn added.
There was a short pause, and then Tony accepted it.
Tony inhaled deeply, covered his eyes with a hand, and muttered, “You’re actually giving Captain America the shovel talk.”
Steve looked at her for a long moment.  “I don’t know,” he said at last, deciding there was no world that he could begin to pry the mind of Tony Stark successfully.  All he could do was speak his own truth, and it was: “But I kinda wanna find out.”
“Just shut up for two minutes,” Tony told him, radiating enough
“Hello, prey,” Thor greeted jovially, stepping on board in his traditional battle armor and looking around the vessel with his typical
.  His pointy ears were also burned copper-green.  “Sister world,” he repeated.
Sighing, Steve reached up, but instead of throttling Tony, he simply rested a hand on the back of his neck, at the base of that frenetic, genius mind.
“You’re not,” Clint told him.
Steve frowned, putting two-and-two—or two-by-four, as it were—together.
Steve drove a little ways longer, then clicked on the radio.  “. . .
I’ll do a psych evaluation,” Tony snapped.  “You can’t ground me without cause.”
“I’m not gonna give you any numbers,” Steve insisted.
Wondering what life forms might have inhabited the doomed world was what kept Tony up at night.  Life wanted to propagate; life feared extinction, erasure above all else.  Confronted with proof of the Universe’s unflinching violence, Tony felt weirdly unmoored.
“Stupid rule,” Clint complained.
Steve looked at Tony skeptically.  Tony wagged his telephone.  “I put a tracker on his phone.  I have
“When?”
The museum staffers exchanged worried looks.
“Of course it’s fair,” Steve said, leaning up on very tippy toe to set the bowl on top of the cabinet.
“You’re going to have to,” Tony admitted, hating the sudden claustrophobia clinging to him, the abject
Steve sighed.  Then he sniffed—gross—and wiped his nose on his sleeve again.  Looking up, he opened a cabinet, pulled out a box of generic, pre-made cookies, and handed them to Tony.
Goddamn, was it worth the view.
Thor sure ate like a lion.
“What’s that mean?”
“You stole my cookies.”
He was not sad.  He was bitter.
“You’re too big,” Tony told him.  Marker clicked at him curiously.  “No, you’re too big,” he insisted.  “Go back to bed.  I’ll be out in a bit.”  Once the ache in his back died down.
It was fitting.
Surprised, Steve acknowledged from the forest floor, “You’ll tell me why you don’t like God, but not dogs?”
.  “Some kid grabbed me.  Said he picked up my distress signal.  But I’ve been trying all night—”  He paused, mulled it over.  “The
Steve drew in a breath, ready to take his chances and fly with a dragon that was not his own.
A human in the same gear approached.  He had a jauntily placed cap on for good measure.  “Ready to kick some Romulan ass?”
Clint held up a hand, pointer finger extended, and lifted his other palm above it, sliding his open palm along the length of his pointer finger before closing it around an invisible fly.  “
.  He shrugged, feeling exposed, stuffing his journal back into his pocket.  “Didn’t see the point,” he defended lamely.
Kind of ironic, Steve mused, stripping the bed, that after such a fearsome argument over who got which room, they congregated in one room, regardless.  He had half-thought that after finding a place—following an hour-long sojourn of bothering various hotel clerks about their borderline conspiratorial lack of vacancies—that Clint might room with Natasha.  But he should’a known better, really.  It was miraculous that they had found
“What really happened in New York?” Happy insisted.
.  That,” Tony protested, disobeying Rule Number One and laying a flat palm on the side of Stovok’s face, intending to give him a gentle shake as a reminder that scaring years off his life was only cute the first time.
, Steve did not say, frowning back at him.  “No,” he said simply.
Tony wondered at his ceiling,
“Big baby,” Steve grumbled, setting down the clean knife.  “All right, all right, settle down,” he said, scowling as Tony covered both of his eyes.  “Could you not?”
Tony thumbed the Vulcan in the room, pointing out, “I can see why he’s your second-in-command.”
Following Tony’s back to the cabin, Steve swallowed down questions:
Thor wrapped an arm around Steve’s shoulders, then pulled him aside.  “What is a ‘hippy’?” Thor asked.
opportunity to—”
, he thought sulkily, stepping away and locking himself in the bathroom.
Tony went stiff.
A strange, guttural trumpet sound made both of them look to the side, where Marker stood, still caked in sand but upright.  He bobbed his head a few times, then looked at Tony expectantly.
Thor set down his mighty hammer and declared cheerfully, “I like this place.”
. o .
Gripping his chest over his heart, Tony flicked the ship into autopilot and spun furiously to face the stowaway.  Stovok looked unrepentant, holding onto an overhead strap and looking down at Tony without malice or surprise.  “I will have to make a note in my report—”
Steve was alive, and well, and Tony knew he would speak the pain out of existence if he could, incant the exact recitation needed to erase it all.  But Steve, like Tony, was only human.
Whatever fight Tony Stark had on reserve had clearly been tapped out, Steve knew, but Iron Man still spat, “
.  That was almost harder—help, he could turn down, wave off, but trust was a two-way street.
“I asked Stark,” Thor dismissed, putting a paw over Tony’s helmet to shush him.  “What say you?”
There was a long pause.
Shaking his head, Tony turned back to the Ba’ku, bowing a head in formal dismissal.  “We’ll be in touch.”
“Haven’t exactly put a good taste in my mouth yet,” Steve grumbled.
, this is my bodyguard.”
“Just one of my many missed opportunities,” Tony said, unsuccessfully stifling a yawn.  “Remind me to have the film printed before you go.”

Relieved, he kicked back in his chair, only to be hit with a wave of heat as the transport vessel pressurized with the ambient humidity.  “Whew, it is

Standing noticeably straighter with undisguised satisfaction, Tony noticed Steve’s arched eyebrows and affected an air of dismissal.  “See?  Nice guy.”

“Tony?  Tony, are you hurt?” Steve asked urgently.  He had had the arc reactor removed years ago, but the artificial sternum still bothered him, and if—
“You haven’t met Thallós,” Tony pointed out.  “She’s a sweetheart.”  He thumbed the dragon on Steve’s chest, adding, “They’re not bad.  I mean, not

“The Vulcan gave us hope,” admitted Anij.  “Vulcans have always exercised restraint.  We admire their ability to act for the greatest good.”
Stovok inclined his head.  “Stark believed in taking risks,” he acknowledged.
“Oh my God,” Tony summarized breathlessly, catching up to Steve.
It would take a lot of work.  Tony Stark could not take any more.  He trembled.
“‘Bruce, get the knife,’” Tony mimicked meanly.
It was locked up tight for the night, but they paused outside the marble steps to gaze up at the quietly illuminated temple.  There was something particularly arresting about it, at night—solemn and entrancing, truly a place out of time.
Then he looked over and saw the two bachelors on the couch—one beheaded, the other zonked out of his mind—and told them, “I

A blue-gray rug came scurrying around the corner.  Steve lit up like a Christmas tree when it changed course abruptly and scrambled over to say hullo.  “Oh, Secret,” apologized the stranger, as the dog,
They’ve kept a close eye on Morgan’s health condition as she grew up. She even had an open heart surgery around 2 months after she was born and that was one of the hardest things they went through. But lucky she healed well, and they had the support from the Avengers team to get through that tough time. After that, they still had to go to multiple doctor appointments over the years. They’ve tried to give her as much of a normal childhood as they can, but sometimes Tony thinks they aren’t doing enough and he beats himself up about it. But then Steve reassures him again and he stops doubting his ability to be a good parent.
“I know, Tony,” Steve said a third time, and that was that.

“You’re going to find the threshold of strawberry toxicity to humans,” Tony muttered, plucking one off the top and rubbing it off on his cardigan before taking a bite.  He made a surprised expression before schooling it back into his usual neutrality.  “Too bad Pepper’s
Metal glove in place, Tony reached down to pry Actinium off his leg.  Then Curium lunged for his elbow, tiny teeth snapping down.  “
“They changed it,” Steve insisted, pointing to the label.
Steve nudged Tony’s shoulder gently.  Tony swayed with the motion, then gave him an annoyed look: “What?”
Steve had never dreamed of running away with them, but there was something friendly and almost familial about seeing them again.
Tony glared at him.  Steve sipped his shake calmly.

Steve gave Tony a flat look over his stack of strawberry-rhubarb pies.  “I’ll buy you another pair, all right?”
Tony deflated.  “

“Briefly,” Thor confided, stacking another plate on his seven-plate-pile.  He had commandeered one half of the booth for himself.  Clint sat across from him, along with Bruce, who seemed to be competing with Thor but only in cups of coffee.  Steve had seen him refill his mug five times.

“Well, then, my new favorite is torta barozzi.”
“Finally,” Tony Stark said, looking up from the kitchen table, where all five of Steve’s unwelcome guests had congregated.  They had a board game open in front of them, although Steve did not know what it was.  “We’re wagering our souls, right?” Tony said, cutting cards.
“You’ll stay forever, won’t you?” he asked, half teasing.  “I’d take very good care of you.

Some people called dragons soul-stealers.
Rico slept every night next in their bed, right to Tony, and Steve, for some reason, slept easier for it.
Leaning between the front seats, Steve asked for the fourth time, “Where are we?”
“No,” Steve said.  Tony deflated.  “I’m saying you do it for Steve Rogers.”
A superstitious part of him worried that even learning the basics might impair his chances of successfully going home, as if he really would start to look like a futurian and act like one if he spent too much time reading all about how things

“Twenty’s fair,” Tony said.  “Mind if I write you a check?”
Iron Man did not respond.  It seemed plain enough to Steve that the answer was a pure lie, anyway.  He knew all about the man underneath the suit, even if all records of Tony Stark had effectively ceased less than a year after he had returned from three months of imprisonment.
Tony said, “Bullshit, they can’t love.”  At Steve’s genuinely affronted look, he added, “Don’t you

He was halfway to dozing when Steve said, “Aw, gee,” under his breath.  Tony opened an eye to see him inspecting the door, then looking at Marker, the demon puppy responsible.  “Well.  It is Christmas,” he said enigmatically, and brought the mugs over to the bed.  “Need a lift?” he asked Tony.
The Viceroy hotel is real, and the Avengers are staying at its penthouse suite.
They found Clint first.

Iron Man walked out.  Steve did not miss the way he limped, gripping at the doorframe in brief, passing aid.
Shrugging, Stovok said, “We survived.  I consider that an overwhelming success.”
Steve glared at the cans.
Steve said, “I think that’s a yes.”

It did not matter if Marker never came back.  He would only act as if it were inevitable that Marker
Tony could not imagine it.
“I am,” Stovok said simply, face utterly unremarkable behind the opaque helmet.  “I take no sides.”
Steve blinked once.
.  She chose you.  Actinium gets to choose.  Don’t you dare give up now, Steve.”
Stovok gave him a confused side-eye.  “You were gone before I woke.  How was I to contact you?”
Happy let it go.  “Where to next?” Happy prompted.
Tony let the silence steep between them, interrupted only by the wind and crashing waves, dimmed by the thick rock walls, and Dr. Banner’s soft snoring.

Tony said, “Hm?”  When Steve looked at him, he was tapping at his telephone again.  Steve nudged him.  “What?
—but Tony could not decide what flavor of malevolence was most present before, with indifference, Cap added, “It belongs on Asgard.”  Thor cuffed Cap on the shoulder, giving him a huge, jovial shake.
“I can do it,” Steve growled, head spinning but mind clear enough to recognize what Tony was getting at.
“No.  That’s what makes it heroic.”
“Why don’t I show you the ones available?” Linda prompted.
Nodding, Steve acknowledged, “He’s a crazy sonuvabitch.”  Bruce relaxed a little, like the elephant had finally been spoken for.  “But he means well.”  Consolingly, he added, “If he gets out of line, I’ll reel him in.”
“Should’ve held onto it, then, Tweety,” Tony said, still filling in answers.  “It’s too easy,” he complained suddenly, crumpling up the paper and chucking it at Clint’s face.
Clint and Bruce both looked at Steve for guidance.  Clint said, “Be lyin’ if I said I wasn’t kinda intrigued.”

“As you should,” Thor chuckled.  “Come.  You will like it down there.  Far less . . . disagreeable, than this wretched transport vessel.”
“Gaffe,” Tony said immediately.
It was . . . a world.  A seemingly habitable one, with an actual crust covered in greenery and

“You know what?  I’m glad we went with the Hell Hole,” Tony said, sitting in the back of the truck with Bruce, who was snoring on his own shoulder, and Steve, who was sitting across from him, sipping on a milkshake.  “This ain’t bad.”
Steve looked into Ashley’s eyes and saw a younger man, maybe fifteen, looking back, wide-eyed and uncertain.
Reeling from the impact, Steve pushed a hand against his right eye, more startled than hurt.  Clint took off like a shot.  Steve lost nearly three seconds confirming that he was not hurt before giving chase.  Clint was halfway across the pitch—Clint was fifteen feet from base and closing fast but—Steve caught him by the back of the shirt with six feet to spare.
“No, that’s it, I’m engaging a medical—override,” Bruce announced, staring openly as Tony released Stovok’s shirt and Stovok stepped back briskly, meeting Bruce’s eye with only a vague air of disapproval.  Bruce made a slightly punched sound, then paled, then pointed between the two of them.

Tony Stark popped out of existence.  And then reappeared.  On Nibiru.
He pulled himself back from it, watching as Tony sketched: “The neural network is like a superhighway system,” Tony said.  “Habits are like roads, formed and deformed over time.  You can almost see their presence in the folding of the brain. . . .”  And on he went.

Steve let the talk wash over him, staring out the window as the rain neared them, one thought in mind:

“How fare you, Stark?” Thor asked, his voice somber, standing in the doorway like a sentinel.
“Got that?” he asked shortly.

“Why?”
“I would like to feed the hogs,” Thor said, his voice resonating impressively throughout the African hall, setting off the monkeys in a spirited display of hooting and jabbering.

And there was.
Steve quelled, “We don’t have to talk about it.”  Then, when no one seemed inclined to take the out, he offered quietly, “Not over breakfast.”
The remaining Gorn hissed and resumed pummeling him with closed fists.
Hulk roared, making both of them flinch, but as soon as Clint turned the hose back on him, he subsided back to a peaceful smirk, seated almost like a Buddha.  It was, admittedly, surreal, with all the blue-purple-pink foam on him.

“What if it’s my life’s dream to die young?”
No one disputed or agreed with the claim.
“Try,” Steve said, one word, one hand extended, invisible but so plainly there.

There had been something indescribable about them.  The retiring

a hole in my head.”
Not that she was mean, no, but Steve had spent less than two weeks with her and already knew the Rule: Natasha got her own space.  Even Clint, who believed personal space was an affront to humanity, attempted to respect hers.
“You got a bike.”
Making was dangerous, Tony knew.  Especially in his line of work, where he worked not just with explosive matter but
Out of the frying pan, into the circus, Steve thought, lifting his hand to knock again.
Tony clung to him like a limpet, plastered to his front, gripping only parts of Steve’s clothes.

But Steve could make sandwiches.  Good sandwiches.

Anyway.  Steve didn’t move his foot.
“I’m not doing this again,” Steve said anyway, just so Tony could know he was not some kind of pony to be trekked around.

“You probably know more about Earth than the average Terran,” Tony joked.
“Do I look like a clown?” Clint asked.
“That’s why you’re supposed to butter it,” Steve remarked, very dryly.

“That’s five more than we would’ve seen if we hadn’t come.”
Slinking over to a bench, he put his head in hands, suddenly grateful for the stupid hoodie, which hid him from plain view.  Thor approached, seemed to weigh a few responses, before wordlessly retreating.
Time passed.
Loved them and loved them and loved them.  To the ends of the Earth, the edges of sanity, the limits of ambition.

Narrative side note, "Roscoe" is an OC concierge--his job is to pull strings and make things happen for a wealthy client like Tony Stark. I always find Tony's billionaire status to be a particularly fascinating facet of his lifestyle, and during my research, I kept coming across the man-behind-the-curtain of the ultra-wealthy class. "Roscoe" won't take a bullet for Tony, but he will find the doughnuts Tony really likes and have them shipped across the country to his doorstep at two a.m., for a really heavy room service fee.
Steve caught the keys Tony tried to throw into the pavement.  “All right,” he placated.  “It’s not that bad.”
“I—did—everything, I could, to minimize casualties,” Stovok said, his voice more halting than Tony had ever heard it.  “But that is not the nature of war.  War is . . . beyond reason.”  Drawing in a visible breath, Stovok recited grimly, “Lieutenant James Barnes was killed fourteen days before the Battle of Cheron, the final battle of the Romulan-Earth Wars.  He was one of 7,952 Starfleet officers killed in action over the course of the war.”  Softly, he added, “I remember your father.  He saved 842 lives.  Including mine.”
The reactor was gone, but the pain lingered.
“Aw,” Clint called.  “C’mon!”
“Gee, I didn’t know we were so close,” Cap huffed, voice very close.
“Believe me, pal,” Steve said, quiet but earnest.  “Family ain’t just blood.”
He shook with a violent shudder, rattling the desk at his back.  A pleading tone entered the monster’s voice: “I don’t want you to suffer, Tony.”
Clint obligingly disappeared around a corner, whooping with delight,
“No,” Steve said firmly, sitting back against the headboard.  “I’m restraining you.”
With an almost visible reigning in of his own emotions, Thor stood at his full height and reached for his collar.  He then peeled back his armor and handed it to Barton, who staggered under the weight.  “Guard this.”
They watched the morning news as the sun rose over Detroit.
Tony thought, patting him on the gold-sleeved arm.  “S’fine,” he said out loud, words slurred.  The air was cold, even though Stovok put off body heat like a living furnace.  Tony’s face still felt numb.  “Not exactly how I planned to spend m' evening, but I’ve never slept with a Vulcan before.”
“Natalie Rushman,” Natasha introduced, surprising Steve.

Hunched over his own chest, Tony said, “No, I don’t.”
Steve deadpanned, “What’s the big idea?”
“Just one?” Clint chimed in.  “Good thing I brought this.”  He held up an empty water bottle.  “Pee bottle,” he explained.
—did not look at him as Tony sat down next to her.  Tony reached out and hesitated, putting a hand on the hatchling’s back.  It rippled with a shiver, but the hatchling did not move away, looking out at the water.
“Yeah, well.”  Tiredly, Mr. Cap Bird himself—
Tony lowered the bear spray cannister with a conspicuous rattle.  “Oh, come on, I’ve always wanted to try it,” Tony whispered, as a black bear snuffled at the trail, not ten yards ahead of them.  “Does poison ivy grow in Alaska?” he asked, staring intently at a bush.
“No,” Stovok said firmly, ending the discussion.
Cadmium hiccupped, which might have been cute, except the silence that followed was ominously deep.  Marker clicked quietly, as if to warn Tony off from whatever Tony was not doing.  Then Tony heard the soft scrape of claws on the floor outside the door.  Marker clicked twice in quick succession and Tony saved his own life by dropping the red hatchling and bolting away from it.
Tony soothed, “And you know what?  We can come back in ten years.  Maybe even a hundred.”
“I strive to.”
Steve gave him an unimpressed look.
Steve grinned.  “Wouldn’t miss it for the world,” he promised.  He slid out of the booth and started to thumb twenties out of his wallet.  Sam shook his head, starting to argue, but Steve demurred, “No, I can’t take any more affairs with my teammates.”  Sam laughed.  Steve set down a pile of twenties and instructed, “Tell them to keep the change.”
Steve’s stomach was growling by the time they reached the:
, he thought, and then a big huge fisher’s hand hooked him by the arm, wrenching his shoulder out of socket as it yanked him out of the turbulent flow.  “You fool!” Thor chortled.  Steve gasped around the stinging pain in his arm, his eyes, his lungs, dangling like a fish on a line in Thor’s commanding grip.  His arm strained to hold his weight, the current yanking him towards the edge.

“Don’t we have ground to cover?” Steve asked him.
They granted him no peace, no
“. . . No,” Stovok admitted.  “You did not.”
“Uh-huh.”
“Awesome,” Clint said.  “I’m gonna get a whole pie.”  And he disappeared back inside.
“You’re lucky Rushman used your card,” Happy said, sitting at picnic table, eating a paper-wrapped cheeseburger with one hand, his other wrapped in a black splint.  “Made it easy to track.  I had to catch a redeye, you know.  God only knew what city you’d be in next.”
Groaning theatrically, Tony slouched over and slumped against his side.  “You stole from me,” he complained.

“I’m a Lieutenant in Communications, Stark, not Command,” Romanova replied calmly.
Then Tony said: “Wait a sec, if you’re both

Setting his hand in the thousand-year-old groove, Tony shuffled down the mountainside, following Stovok’s gold back.
“Oh, I’ll believe it,” Steve said grimly, arms folded across his chest.
Reaching into his pocket, Steve held up the blue lollipop.  They all stared at it for a moment.  “It is one hell of a reward,” Steve said at last.  Swiveling it once, he added, “This is seventy years of advancements.”
“We done here?” he asked instead.
Thor held out a hand, and Mjolnir flew into his palm.  “Fare thee well,” he bade them, and took off.

“I’m not saying I will.  I’m just—gathering ideas.”
Steve took a step forward.  Clint shoved the pack against his chest.  “Password?”
“Gross!” Clint complained in the not-too-distant distance.  “Get a room!”  Lucky yelped beside him, then took off.  Tony scrambled to get up on the table before the dog made landfall.  “Incoming!”
He would never get tired of it.
He snarled impotently.
Tony toyed with a spoon.  “You were robbed, Peter Pan.  Or maybe you’re more of a—Benjamin Button type.”  Laying down the spoon again, he elaborated, “Either way—you’re not getting it back.  That time.  That—bright-eyed wonder.  And that’s. . . .”  He shook his head, met Steve’s eye, his own still bloodshot with fatigue.  “That’s

11:30 P.M.
“I’ve got what I need,” Steve agreed neutrally.
When the Vulcan reached the scouting party, he greeted them with his usual impenetrable composure, nodding at Dr. Banner and then gesturing at himself with a single hand.  After an inaudible confrontation, two of the Nibirans abruptly shoved Dr. Banner towards Stovok—Tony yelped in alarm, but Stovok caught and stabilized him.  Then he gave Dr. Banner a nudge in the right direction, stepping around him carefully, and received the scouting party with a welcoming nod.  The Nibirans turned back towards the path.  Stovok followed them.
, under his breath.  Tony wouldn’t look at him, at all, until Steve ordered, “Say sorry.”  Then annoyed eyes shot to him, like Tony could not believe Steve was holding him at proverbial gunpoint over a
There was a very long, rather awkward pause.
“I’m actually appalled it took you this long to notice.”  He finally stopped stealing Steve’s fries to work on his own burger.  Steve ignored his own food completely, laser-focused.  “Of course I am.  I’m an unstable mutating radioactive element.  It’s my job to rock the zeitgeist.”  Taking a bite, he gestured eloquently with a hand, indicating the park.
, the possessive as natural as every article attached to his own name—standing in the middle distance, hugging the wall in his black uniform, like a gargoyle presiding over the cards of the mortal masses beneath him.  He was smart to stand back, Steve thought numbly, as the Tony in front of him, fully ten years younger than his grim huddling successor, went from pale-faced, white-wheeling-terror to eyes-rolling-back unconsciousness.
Steve focused on the more immediate problem at hand.  “Tony, don’t encourage him,” Steve said, as Tony held up his telephone and instructed:
,” Tony called after him.  “Now.  Right now.  We’re already gone.  You’re
“Look at him, he’s the picture of health,” Barton said, propping his feet up on the edge of the gurney, overbalancing promptly and collapsing onto the floor.  “As am I,” he added with a beat of laughter, cackling like a hyena.  “Jesus.  We’re some crew, aren’t we?”
.  He gasped out loud, shoving himself frantically to his feet.  The combined motion set off a coughing fit, huge and racking, but he pushed back against Steve’s extended arm.  “The others,” Tony rasped.  “Where are the others?”
“Commander,” Rhodes filled in.
—he said, “I barely know this man.”
“So it
Tony groaned.  “Not
The headache came and went again.
Listening to Tony talk, Steve felt almost . . . real.  Not merely a passenger flying by on an invisible train, hoping against diminishing hope that the next stop would take him home, but a part of the equation, of the real and now.  A quiet but very cynical part of him agreed with Tony’s assessment of S.H.I.E.L.D.: they wanted him badly, and
“Let me take care of my friend,” Tony said, speaking to keep the atmosphere jovial, well aware that they did not truly understand him.
“We would have left sooner,” Sojef submitted, “had we been able to requisition a vessel earlier.  First Contact had just been made with Vulcan when we sailed off into the stars.  We recognized your. . . .”
“All right,” Clint acquiesced, turning back towards the door.  “I’ll ask Stark.”
Tony may have had a point.

Tony and Romanova were on their feet, but Stovok had already splashed into the water, grasping the Hirogen’s flailing arm, heaving him forward.  Thor resurfaced, sputtering and clawing.  Stovok walked backwards, holding onto the Hirogen’s arm until Thor growled and shoved him ferociously aside.  “How
Steve gave him an unimpressed look.  “Why?”
Sometimes, Steve wondered what it would have been like to have grown up in Ireland.  To have been surrounded by family, instead of growing up in an empty home, his Ma—God rest her soul—always away, returning late and leaving early, to help save other souls.  In a wry and oddly self-aware manner, Steve reckoned that he would have sat on barn rafters and dreamed of leaving it all behind for the city, to go somewhere something was happening, and do the good he was born to do.
“Briar Patch,” Tony agreed.  Then, doing a visible double take, he asked Stovok, “Since when do you speak
“Harder to refute photographic evidence.  Especially in, what?  The Forties?”
“Please tell me that’s not real,” Dr. Banner implored from the very back of the vessel, as far from Thor as he could get.  “The lizard monster can’t be—”
And in no time whatsoever, Clint was back to his bright-eyed and bushy-tailed self.
In the same shivering wavelength, Thor, son of Odin, valiant warrior of the Hirogen, reappeared.
“What?”
“Not as such,” Coleman said.  “Just wanted to send you off proper, Cap.”  He held out a small comic, rolled-up and aged but clearly an early edition of the
Tony said, “I do,” and poured out a cup.  He set it in front of Steve.  “That’s not coffee.”
Tony said dryly, “Well, you wouldn’t,” and leaned forward to kiss his nose, making him briefly cross-eyed.
That would definitely work.
“But, like—we won’t
Tony nodded to himself.  Then, finally, he looked over at Steve, the stars in his shaded eyes taking a half-second longer to dissipate.  In its place was the calm, calculating Tony Stark he knew.  Wearing sunglasses and a woman’s cardigan.  “But
Finally, at 2340 hours—less than thirty minutes until zero-hundred—Steve sat before a crackling fire and asked lazily, “What’s with the pack of cigarettes, huh?”
Tony shook his head, passing him the box back.  “I don’t want these, I want the real salt of the Earth
“No poutine,” Clint said mournfully.
“More,” Clint said, as an unruffled employee dumped an entire scoop of sprinkles over a bowl of ice cream before looking up at him expectantly.  “Keep going.  I’ll say when.”
“Why not?”
“It’s stickball,” Steve said.
Steve looked between her, on the bed, and Natasha, still seated on the couch.
It was an ugly name for a beautiful beast.
Thor paused, gave him a look that had frozen the heart of more than one lion, and continued calmly towards second base.
faster than a speeding bullet—but he was a whizz on the rebound.  As the green streak of light sliced through an invisible pitcher and smashed into the fence, Steve caught the rebound.  He lobbed it back as gently as he dared in Bruce’s direction.  Bruce chose life: he scurried out of the way, and the ball bounced harmlessly past him.  “Come on,
He shut his own eyes, but it was harder to ignore the sharp ache inside his chest, the metal encasement implanted in his ribs, like a dozen needles deep
As Clint pulled out his new trinkets and knickknacks and gadgets and gizmos, Steve found himself wondering what Thor and Tony were up to, planning their very own expedition.
A half-amused, half-disbelieving huff escaped Tony.
Tony arched his eyebrows expectantly.  Steve reached for his wallet, grimacing at the soaked leather.  He quickly thumbed through thirty-eight twenty-dollar-bills.  Seven-hundred-and-sixty dollars.  “Yup.”
Maybe that was the real reason they had come.  Nothing beat fish fresh off the river, although how Tony had foreseen Clint Barton deciding, on a whim, to go fishing, was beyond Steve’s humble, non-genius mind to wrap itself around.
Clint looked between the bait and his own hand a few times.  At last, Tony sighed, reaching forward to reclaim the bait.
—would have been gratifying, maybe.  But Steve was not a spiteful man.  Tony scowled and said:
He went through the winding blue maze, hyper-aware of his exposure.  The tired travelers around him were looking anywhere but at each other, but he had the strong impression that at any moment, he could be spotted.  He was jumping out of his skin with impatience by the time he reached the front desk and asked in a friendly but assertive voice, “Now, all I need from you is a ticket to New York, can you do that or can you not?”
Piercingly loud at proximity, Snow clicked back.  Tony grimaced, but he had no choice but to hold his ground.
“Are you dying, Tony?” Steve asked solemnly.  He found he did not want to hear the answer.  He found, more than anything in the world, that he wanted Tony Stark to live.
After maybe twenty minutes of comfortable walking, not quite at spearpoint but not quite free to break formation, Tony mused, “Always wanted to take a romantic walk in the woods before being ritually sacrificed in a volcano.”
“You’re gonna jump.  I can feel it.”
Steve drew in a shallow breath.  Tony held on, unafraid but too smart not to know what kind of danger Steve could be to him.  The wordless was there:
Steve gave him a deadpan look of his own.  Well, at least they were on the same page, Tony thought murderously.  “No, it’s not,” Steve dismissed, waving a hand, bearing a cookie.
Natasha rested her head on his shoulder.  Steve allowed it, long after he felt she could have come up with a yes-or-no answer.  Then he sighed, signaling her to lift her head.  “All right,” he said quietly.  “I’m done feeling sorry for myself, now.”
He did not mention the incident to Steve.  Steve hovered enough as it was.
. o .
“. . . I don’t actually know what that is,” Steve said instead.
Tony loosened his grip.
.  An awful crackling noise, an awful splintering sensation almost made him stop, but his Tony hissed out, “Keep going,” and he did.
Steve was not stupid.  He knew that fame was a double-edged sword; people chased him around for interviews and endorsements, all while knowing he had the power to ruin their businesses with a single scathing remark.  Still, seeing it so plainly made him feel bad for the poor people involved.
Thallium obliged, clicking softly, close-mouthed.  Like her mother, she had two long horns protruding directly from her brow, which would someday become fierce deterrents for any creature foolish enough to approach her.  For now, they could punch holes in Tony’s arm, but they would hardly kill him.  She sniffed tamely at him but did not bite.  Despite himself, Tony’s heart melted.
“Ah,” Steve replied.  Then: “Barton’s?”  The yelping returned, but he caught Lucky on the jump, looking around the estate curiously.  “This isn’t New York.”
“There’s truly a lot you don’t know about me,” Tony sniffed.  Then, in a purposeful undertone, Tony added, “You ever have a brother?”
After three more repetitions, Tony rallied: he stood up and unplugged the vacuum.  Without waiting to see if Steve would try to twist
“The rope—”
On principle, Tony turned him down.  Steve, damn him, gave him one anyway, a little cup at the sink.  And Tony drank it.
Steve limped upstairs.  He did miss the elevators at the Avengers Tower sometimes, but it was hard to deny the charm of a Brooklyn brownstone.

“All right,” Steve said.  Then Steve sat down and disappeared into the hell hole.
Tony grumbled, “Of course you don’t, they didn’t try to steal your memories.”  Nudging his shoulder against Stovok’s, he added, “I actually think they wanted to keep you.”  Stovok frowned, gave him a pointed look.  “Not that we’d

“It’s not.  The hard part is—keeping—”  He shuddered once.  And Steve understood that, oddly enough.  He understood cold better than most people.  Tony didn’t need to say it out loud.
