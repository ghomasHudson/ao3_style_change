Steve took a shower first and chided himself for staring at his closet for too long, picking out one of his normal shirts rather than the nicer one he'd been gravitating towards.  His crush was getting a little ridiculous.  "JARVIS, is Tony in the building?"
As she left, Steve opened his notebook again, staring down at Peggy.  Unlike Bucky, her eyes had remained the same.  So bright and lively when she was in her more lucid moments.  He knew what she would tell him.  She always called him on his dramatics.
Steve hummed in agreement, rubbing small circles into Tony's tense shoulders.  He'd admit if Kor'la'vin were to walk in right now, she probably wouldn't be leaving the room in one piece.  "And what about the time you nearly brought the whole Tower down because-"
Tony slapped Steve's hand away.  Steve was surprised to find Tony's eyes were wet when they finally met his.  They were also angry.  "You damn well know why.  You saw the video.  It means I
Steve nodded, reluctantly letting go of Tony.
Tony looked up to see the brown dragon from yesterday, Sam.  He was holding a wooden basket that reminded Tony of the murals outside the gate, finely crafted with a myriad of colors.  He hadn't been at dinner last night, so Tony assumed he must have been somewhere off with Steve.
Steve was chatting amiably with some of the airmen a few days later when his phone rang.  He excused himself, then frowned as he looked at the unknown number.  "Hello?" he said as he picked up the call.
The thing was that it really
"Indeed, Captain."
The arc reactor was a problem.  It shouldn't be, because Tony had had one in his chest for almost two years and it had worked fine then.  ...Aside from the whole palladium poisoning thing, but he'd gotten that fixed eventually.  But now the elements weren't forming right and the alloys were too brittle.  Why couldn't he think clearly and get this done?
"Tony!"
"Sorry," Tony whispered, and Rhodey hugged him a little tighter.
That was a lesson which had been brought home painfully.  His return smile was brittle and bitter.  "Of course I can't," he agreed.
"Nothing," Wanda said.  "But know it is not your fault.  You are only the warning."
"You probably could," Tony replied absently, but he leaned in instead of away, allowing the touch.  "You're better at adapting than anyone I know."
They were both talking over each other, growing more excited as terms Steve wasn't familiar with started being tossed around too rapidly for him to even try to make sense of it.  Thor was grinning broadly as he came up behind Dr. Foster, looking fondly at both her and Tony.  Neither of them knew Tony was Iron Man, and Steve could see when Tony realized that, his scientific explanation faltering even as Rhodes bumped his shoulder with a gentle smile on his face that didn't quite say 'I told you so,' but it was close.
"Why?  Did he have some sort of grudge against Tony?" Steve asked.  He found it hard to believe that Tony would hurt people, at least on the level Fury was implying.  Tony only aimed to hurt when he himself was hurting.  He'd seen that easily enough in their first meeting when Tony had been friendly up to Steve making incorrect assumptions. Tony had been genuinely kind to the airmen and hospital staff.
He stared into the darkness quietly, Stark's shoulder pressed against his as they sat on the hard floor.  He should be heading back to the jail to check on Red Wolf.  He should be doing any number of things.  He didn't move though, and Stark's steady breaths beside him were comforting.
"Just because I post more of Tony than the others doesn't mean I'm in love with him," Steve said, not quite meeting Rhodey's eyes.  "He's popular for the requests.  And I can't...  I can't seem to get him
"And what was that exactly?"
Rhodey picked up a tablet that had been on the counter, unlocking it and sliding it over to Steve.  He wondered how much Rhodey had set up in advance, then glanced through the tabs that were open.  A lot, apparently.
Steve sucked in a breath.  Iron Man had said Stark didn't have a good relationship with his father, but that was an understatement.  Stark went on, ignoring Steve's reaction entirely.  "People form first impressions within a tenth of a second of meeting someone.
"Yeah," Susan said, ducking her head.
"It was a shoddy AI interface Tony threw together since Iron Man was needed to protect Colonel Rhodes," Steve recited.  "It didn't work very well and Tony was caught by the electricity of the portal after I pushed Kang in."
The dragons were gone?  Tony spared a brief moment to worry about where Steve had gotten to, but that would have to wait for now.  "Don't move.  I'm coming down," he said.
Wanda's voice snapped him back to the cavern.  Tony opened his eyes then shut them against the light, rubbing his temples.  "You're hurt," she said sharply, and he could feel Steve's worry on top of hers.
"I am called Viper," she said.
Iron Man let out a small scream as he shot into the sky before Steve could grab his wrist.  Steve watched for a moment before rushing back into the Tower.
"So you just what?  Wanted to thank him?  I could have passed along the message."
"Gonna put it on your Tumblr?" Tony asked, just as Steve had started to drift off again.
Rhodey's smile turned a shade of vicious Tony hadn't seen since putting Hammer behind bars.  "Don't worry.  Natasha, Clint, and I took care of it.  Natasha's interrogating the survivors now."
* * *
"It is now," Rhodey said, smiling grimly.  "Because I can guess at some of Tony's terms in this deal, and I think a lot of them still apply, don't they?  If the US government were to find out Doombots are behind all of this, I don't think they'd take too kindly to it."
She rolled to the side in the air as another blast went by her, heeding the warning Tony put up on the HUD.  She banked around the train and took down the last two soldiers.  As she flew by, she could see the human skin they'd been wearing changing to a darker color.  At least they were hitting the right train.  The Skrulls were so entrenched in the government now that mistaken identity was a definite concern, one Susan worried about a lot.
Tony pushed up on Steve's chest, blinking down at him owlishly.  "You draw them kissing and holding hands all the time.  Even without requests."
* * *
And no, he wasn't thinking of how excited Rhodey would be to see each new leaf or exotic flower.  That would be too much like missing him, and that Tony was willing to deny, if just to push back the ache thinking of his friends brought.  He wondered how they fared the rest of the fight without him.  Rhodey was an even better pilot than Tony, so they had to be alright.
"No, it's f-fine," Susan stammered, torn between trying to help him and staying put.  "We were just going to-" she started to say, then cut herself off.
"Yes," Tony said, his voice tight.  It figured that dragons would be gossips.  "It's... It'd be very dangerous for me, if word got out about it."
"Shh," Tony said again.  "It'll get better."
That was a good question.  Fury would hound him trying to find out what Tony knew, and there were plenty of things down here that would help with the war effort.  Tony wasn't sure the dragons were safer with Uncle Sam than they were with Hydra, however.  "I won't tell anyone what I've seen down here, I promise," Tony said finally.  "This place really is better off a secret."
"What?" Steve asked, feeling like this went even more over his head than it had been before.  He understood the terminology, of course, because even Captain America couldn't escape the hell that is TV tropes (he blames Clint entirely), but how did Carol factor into this now?
"I'm fine."  Tony didn't quite snap, but he was getting close.  Steve backed off with a meek apology and Tony sighed.  He wished he could rub his temples, but the suit stopped that right enough.  He didn't apologize, instead slowly opening the door as he peered around it.
.  Please, don't tell the dragons I'm here.  They do not like humans."
When Jarvis came into view, Tony almost felt like crying again.  The three people he had missed the most over the past few weeks and now they were all here.  Home.  As much of a home as he could have without Steve.
"Yeah?  And what's this about you saving the world by
"Then I will go immediately and let you know upon my arrival," Thor replied.
"I'm fine," Steve said stubbornly, picking up his own tablet and swiping away at it with a grace Tony admired, though Tony doubted that he was doing anything but changing the app pages.
"You should eat your soup before it gets cold," Tony said, his voice tight, but he leaned into her just a little instead of pulling away.
It was a moment before any of them noticed.  Stealth technology had come a long way since his time, and the new suit was nearly silent.  But Steve noticed the presence beside him and looked up.  "What-"
Steve shook his head.  "We should have been more thorough in our search and forced them out sooner, or found Hydra's EMP device quicker.  Then you wouldn't have been..."
Steve was suddenly very glad she hadn't known.  Though 'racier photoshoots' were definitely relevant to his interests, knowing her, she'd have sent them at a horrible time.  "I've been doing fine on my own," he said, hoping it came out sincere and not defensive.
"Little Bird, that's
"Yeah, you're a beauty.  Orange and black are fantastic colors.  I should do an armor in those.  And look at those gorgeous eyes.  I'm sure if I were an insect, you would be irresistible."
," Tony said again.  "Honey, I'm so-"
Steve did not turn so she could see his blush.  "I'll keep that in mind."
"Huh," Tony said, pushing aside thoughts of experiments to see the limits of draconic telepathy.  He touched Steve's wing for added measure, since touch made the telepathy stronger from what Tony could tell.  While he wasn't all that comfortable sharing his thoughts, the dragons seemed to hear the top ones regardless.  Besides, he'd woken up to Steve curled around him the past two days because he'd been too tired from digging to make a proper shelter.  It wasn't like Steve was going to tell anyone his secrets.  "Can I see your drawings now?" Tony asked.
A few days on the airship gave Tony a chance to recover from the sleep debt the dragon healing gave him, so he got up and put in a few hours in the workshop, fixing Rhodey and Pepper's armors.  He knew how quiet he was being worried the others, but it was either that or screaming at them, and it wasn't their fault the universe was a bastard.
Steve opened his mouth to reply or possibly even offer to make Tony some dinner (his food-comfort quirk worked both ways, Steve found, and he could always pick something easier than lasagna to make) when his phone beeped cheerfully to notify him of a text.
"That's just what I'd do this time," Tony said, not sure where this was headed.
Steve let his shield fly, ducking behind a car as the robots continued to shoot.  "Save the innuendos for later," he said.  She had a point though.  It wasn't a particularly good time for Doom to attack, either for the Avengers or for Doom.  Latveria had just come off of an uprising, and most of the superhero community assumed it would be a month or two at least before Doom got his feet back under him.
He was alone.  So alone.  The dark was almost oppressive and he couldn't find Steve.  "Don't leave," he said, frantically searching for the soft dragon scales.  "Steve, don't-"
"You're telling me you don't know any of this?" Pepper asked as Tony skimmed over the notes on the process.
"What..." Tony said, his own voice breaking.  "What happened?" he asked.  But he knew.  How could he not know with all the feelings he was getting from Wanda and Steve?  But there was a desperate need to deny it, to hear them say it wasn't true.
"Trying to convince me to get back to posting art?" Steve asked when his voice started to work again.
"This is he," he replied, glad no one was around to call him on how formal he was being.
, it really wasn't much of a home to go to.
Leon ducked his head as Cap spoke, still not able to meet the AI's eyes.  Tony was easier to look at.  While the history books may have left out certain facts about the heroes, the Stark-Rogers family history said plenty about Tony Stark's faults.  He was more... human, if one could call an AI that.
"Just take things easy for now," Steve told her.  "We'll go over everything at dinner."
"So that means you can put Natasha and Clint in danger?  For what?  Your vanity?"
"You could help people again," Steve said, knowing his face was flushed from the drink but not caring.  Tony'd never see it in the darkness anyway.  He kept his grip on Tony's arm.
Steve did not make his run the next morning.  Or his first class training SHIELD agents.  He rushed in the last five minutes of the class with a pounding headache and queasy stomach that only got worse with Deputy Director Hill's glare.  He was very glad to see her covering his class, however.  Surprised, because he'd have thought she would have much better things to do than train newbie agents, but then again, once she was through glaring at Steve, she seemed to really enjoy teaching.  It might be a nice break for her.
* * *
be running a Fortune 500 company one day and I want her working for mine, not anyone else's.  She's
Tony felt Steve's throat grow hot, but there was no flame.  Instead, Steve gave off the impression of 'not this early' without actually saying the words, the lazy bum, and he puffed a bit of smoke grumpily.  Tony was an old hat at Steve's morning crotchetiness by this point, so he poked Steve again.  "We have to find Viper today," he said.  "No time for a lie-in."
"Christ, you were, weren't you?" Tony asked, answering his own question.  "It's a wonder Snowflake didn't kill you outright.  Also a good thing I didn't know, because that's about when we-"
"But how will they find you again?" Tony tried to push Thor away, but Thor was stronger than him on a good day.  Neither of them answered his question, which made Tony think it must have been too slurred and Steve's earlier answer had simply been a good guess to try to comfort Tony.  "No, you can't..."
Steve gasped awake, hearing both Bucky's scream and someone softly saying his name.  Half of him was still staring into the snowy valley, wondering how damned he'd be if he let go as well.
The plane shook violently.  Tony only had second to cry out before pain on the side of his head flared up and took him out.
"That's not an answer," Stark said.  Steve just drank the last of the whiskey before Stark stole back the bottle.
"Nah, can't be those.  Must be the fact that I love you."
While Steve was fairly adaptable and good at expecting the unexpected outcomes in battle, to say he was surprised to see Nick Fury leaning against the wall as he walked out was an understatement.  He nearly dropped the sandwiches, but he caught them just in time.  What was Fury doing at the Tower unannounced?  "Director Fury.  I thought the debriefing was tomorrow?"
"Don't worry about it, Cap," Happy said, motioning for the other security guard to follow her as he walked back to Steve.  The people around them who had been staring went back to their drinks.  "She's been banned from all SI and Maria Stark Foundation events, but she manages to find and bribe a rookie every so often.  We keep an eye out for her harassing people.  Even the boss has had trouble getting her to lay off.  You can press charges if you want, and SI will foot the bill.  I know Natasha likes to, and that should have all been on camera."
Fear settled between them and Tony couldn't tell if it was him or Steve.  He fought for breath against the pain, words lost to the empty rasps echoing through the cavern.
since you two turned me back on again.  You can drop the cuddly octopus act."
He rolled Steve over and climbed on top, pinning Steve under him and ignoring the way his ribs protested the motion.  Not that Steve was the running away sort, but people... people had a tendency to
"That's 'cause they're sexy when they give orders," Tony replied.  He'd always loved Pepper getting bossy in bed, and while Rhodey might rate a one on the Kinsey scale, Tony most certainly did not and he allowed himself to look and appreciate from time to time.  Rhodey didn't really mind, considering he knew Tony was just appreciating.
Tony gave him a true, if broken and hesitant smile in return.  "You shouldn't be doing this."
* * *
"Tony,
Tony snorted, not looking up from the game as he kept his shoulders from hunching over.  "Never would have guessed."  Steve certainly had looked tortured the last time he'd seen him.
"Maybe," Tony said.  He pat the tail still wrapped around him only to realize his hands were shaking.  "It's easier to hurt someone if you're only thinking of yourself."
"Tony,
* * *
"And Natalie also deserves her own movie too, even if Natasha hates them.  She was pretty kickass," Jan said.  "But obviously, they're not making a movie about her either.  And since Natasha doesn't want movies, I will step up as the obvious choice for a Hollywood blockbuster."
envy the shrink that has to deal with your sulking," Sam said with a laugh and a fake shudder. "I just set people up with the things they need to get better. I'll leave the psychoanalyzing to the professionals."
"They're going to be disgustingly cute now, aren't they?" Clint said.  Natasha poked him in the side with her foot as she was lounging with her feet in his lap, not saying anything but apparently getting across her meaning to Clint loud and clear as he laughed.  "Point.  Okay, you two.  Either get a room or come watch the movie with us."
," Leo snapped, shocking Susan.  He'd never snapped like that before, not at her.  "I don't need both-"
When he looked back, Rhodey was lying on the bed with Tony snuggled up to him.  He nodded his thanks to Steve, rubbing Tony's back as the other man hid his face in Rhodey's shoulder.
Steve had been reaching for the armor, shock now written on his face as his hand went through rather than circling around the armor's wrist.  "Sorry, Cap," Tony said, giving a sloppy salute with the suit.  "It'll wear off in about four minutes and twenty-three seconds."
Hold him down?  Tony carefully unclenched his hands from Steve's undershirt and traced his way up to Steve's face.  He hadn't thought that he could get colder, but he realized he was wrong the moment his hand was no longer trapped between them.  He didn't care though, continuing his path and ignoring the way Steve's breath hitched slightly as Tony's fingers brushed against his neck.  When he got to Steve's cheeks, it took him a moment to realize that they were wet.
"So I do," Tony said, not denying what he'd said earlier.  He didn't believe in shame when his body could actually blush, and he wasn't about to bother now that it was too cold to do so.  Though admittedly, blushing would actually warm him up a little, so he wasn't as opposed to it as he usually was.  It wasn't like Steve didn't know anyway.
.  You shouldn't let them get to you," Steve said.
"Steve?" he asked.  He could breathe again, despite the now fading fire.  "Your wing-"
"You okay?" Tony asked.
Steve looked at the dark circle, feeling the unnaturalness of it.  "And what happens if I go in?"
He did take off one of the armor's gauntlets, figuring the repulsor might come in handy.  It'd been easy enough to rewire in the end and it had only taken a few minutes separate it.  It felt strange without the rest of the armor, and he flexed his hand thoughtfully as he hooked up the wires to his heart pump.  The orichalcum should have no problem with the output, but he didn't think firing repeatedly would be a very pleasant experience for him.  Still, he probably had worse from the days he had to continuously recharge the pump.
Tony stood, and the suit opened up as he stepped out of it.  "This isn't a good time.  You should go to bed," Tony said, his voice flat as he ignored Steve, going over to the table.  Blue holograms sprang to life, and he started to manipulate a project.  Steve was pretty sure he was just moving things around rather than actually doing anything.
"Did what I just see not terrify anyone else?  No?" Iron Man said scathingly.
"Tony..."
"I don't know," Steve said, rubbing at his forehead. "I didn't think... That's weird, isn't it?"
Susan looked at them, uncertainty and fear taking over.  Tony disentangled himself from Steve to stand in front of her.  "Hey there, Little Bear.  What's wrong?"
"I think I might have an alternative," Steve said turning the idea around in his head.
Tony was not an overly vain man.  When Gialetta was around, he made an effort to look properly dashing, but Rhodey and Pepper had seen him with a bush instead of a beard a few times when they'd been on the run.
Tony didn't know how to respond to that.  Instead he leaned against Steve's flank to give the dragon what warmth he could.  He clutched the crystal against him, tracing Steve's star crest with his free hand.
"Yeah, just a sec," Susan said, going over to the armor.  She pressed a few buttons and a small device came off.
Tony's chest was rising and falling rapidly.  Steve didn't know if he wanted to take out a few punching bags or shake Tony.  He really should have left it alone and given Tony some space at the start of this, because neither of them were up for this sort of fight so soon after the battle.  But he couldn't leave now with Tony's trust on the line.
You did, didn't you?  No more soap operas for you, Steve," she teased.  "We'll sort you out when I get back.  One thing I do know about Stark is that he's had threesomes before."
Steve's head was in his lap, a soft rumbling in his throat that Tony equated to dragon snoring.  His mind was open and relaxed, and Tony got the impression of a lot of food when he pet Steve, most of it meat.  Given how much Steve ate, even compared to the other dragons, Tony couldn't say he was surprised.  It was, however, greatly entertaining to know what Steve dreamed of when it wasn't a nightmare.
He barely felt the landing, mind whirling with questions. "How many of there are you here?"
Then he realized where this was headed, seeing the guilt in Tony's eyes.  "Colonel Rhodes was in the armor when he was hurt."
doesn't explain why Jan is becoming a super-villain," he repeated, clamping down on the frustration.  His teammates were just being a little enthusiastic and forgetting the question, he reminded himself.
Sighing, Rhodey shook his head.  "Look, I just wanna know when you're going to make an honest man out of Tony, because God knows he needs it."
He'd heard of nagas in his studies of various mythologies, but he'd never thought he'd actually meet one, even with all of his adventures and strange things he had seen.  "Sounds dangerous, living in that temple by yourself," Tony said.
"You don't know that," Steve said.  "You didn't even tell me about your plan, preferring to turn off my tangibility without my permission!"
"Because if there's a chance I could lose you, I'd rather spend what time I have with you than without you."
"Color me impressed," he said, looking at the now well-lit room.  He'd seen all sorts of clever tricks the ancients used, but dragon fire had a different sort of light that put him at ease.
"What're you doing?" Steve asked, half attempting to pull Tony back.
Kor'la'vin was still wearing her mother's face.
"Yes," Tony said, trying not to think of how many his company made, or how necessary they were.  "We humans war more frequently than dragons.  Hazard of being more easily accessible to each other, I suppose."
"The original pilot of the War Machine armor," Cap confirmed.  "He was paralyzed after one of our fights.  It took a while, but he never let his injuries define him.  He held the line with us against
"Steve, come on.  I need you to wake up," he heard a panicked voice say.
Steve frowned, crossing his arms over his chest.  "But why?  What was he denying?"
He got off the bed and checked the mirror one more time, forcing his hands at his side instead of tugging at his collar like he wanted to.  "Think I'm good to go?"
"Because it's your armor," Susan said.  "You're the one who should be wearing it, not me.  Iron Man is the Stark family legacy, so I can... I'll wait until we can-"
"Because he doesn't trust you," Ms. Potts said easily, as if the answer wouldn't cut him deeply.  "He trusts you to save the city and his own life if the situation called for it, but he has a long history of trusting people who have hurt him, and that starts to take a toll.  And after Afghanistan, he hasn't given his trust to much of anyone who wasn't already in his inner circle.  You have to understand that it will take time for him to find that trust again, and it's not your fault.  And once he gives that trust, he gives everything."
Carefully, he put his foot on one side of the crack and his hand on the wall.  Nothing happened, but he held still.
Tony stood as well as he was able and pushed Steve's tail away.  It was persistent in keeping him close, however, re-wrapping around him as Steve's wing continued to box Tony in.  "Steve," Tony said, flicking Steve's snout in exasperation.
Susan winced as the shield wavered.  "85% and holding," Tony said.  "Let's take them out before they get another hit like that."
Steve's nostrils flared.  "No," he said to Tony's vast relief.  "There are so few humans that come here, so only the elders may eat them."
He felt a hand on his shoulder, and Steve looked up to see a small smile on Rhodey's face.  "You're not the only one at fault, Steve.  God knows Tony doesn't make it easy on himself, and he never took a chance.  I'm willing to bet he hurt you a lot in the process of getting to know him as well, since I hear you don't always let things go when he asks."
"I haven't really done anything," Tony replied.
"I did try earlier," Steve said defensively.  He'd extended a few invitations through Iron Man the first month, but they had all been declined.  Of course, he hadn't really tried that hard.
"Isn't that Bruce's friend?" Steve asked, placing the name from Bruce's file.
helping.  "Just a message from Natasha," Steve said, calculating the distance from the kitchen table to the door and how likely Tony would realize the source of his discomfort in that time.  Highly likely.
His heart sank.  "I-"
"Bruce said you'd only been eating fruit," Steve said, walking back over to the tray.  "It's not much, but I thought you might want something."
"He what?" Steve asked.  Iron Man prodding the Hulk was one thing.  Inadvisable, still, but something the team had come to accept.  Tony didn't have a suit of armor in case something went wrong though.  He wasn't trained like Natasha or Clint either, who were both now familiar with fighting with the Hulk.
Tony didn't respond, and Steve shifted him to get a better look.  His heart nearly stopped.  Tony wasn't breathing.  He tried to touch Tony's chest but got another shock for his troubles, the white light that had been coming out of his shirt earlier now dark.  Steve swallowed, pulling up Tony's shirt.  He was shocked to find the same sort of arc reactor that powered Iron Man in Tony's
He sighed, then readjusted his glasses.  "I came to tell you I would be staying near Betty and Leonard for a while.  They were...  The robots were after her.  Not that the Hulk isn't just as likely to hurt them, but I..."
"I wouldn't," Steve said, anger pushing though his headache as he raised his voice to be heard over her.
Bruce tapped at his tablet again, then turned it around to show Steve.  "Then there's this."
"It makes us unable to use fire and weakens us," Steve said, his mental voice pained.  "They tried to use magic on me so I could...  I was really small when I was younger.  Small and sick.  Johann wanted to show us the surface, so-" Green, Gray and Brown.  Curiosity and wonder as wide and big as the cavern sky.  The scent of wind on a summer day, and the tang of sweet spices and minerals from the earth's secret places.  Deep magic that was as malleable as a branch in the wind. "-tried to use the magic to make dragons stronger on the surface with a higher tolerance for the cold.  I volunteered."
"And you won't," Tony promised, fondness entering his eyes as he watched Steve.  "But we do have a lot of free time now that the twins are taking over monitoring Susan..."
"It's read only now.  Cap's too.  You need our express permission to make changes.  Not that we don't trust you, buttercup, but-"
Steve grabbed his wrist with his good hand.  It was easy to keep the already wobbly Tony down with him.  "I'm sorry," Steve said.  "That wasn't... I shouldn't have lashed out at you like that."
Steve took a deep breath and winced.  He continued to listen to the chatter, to Iron Man's voice.  It did seem a little flatter than usual, but otherwise it was like their fight had never happened.  That hurt more.
Steve tried to move back discreetly.  The plan was foiled when he let out a surprised grunt as she groped his ass.  He gave her a disapproving glare as he removed her hand, noting the ring on her finger as he stepped back again.  She had to be in her sixties, and Steve wondered how anyone thought he was a prude with her level of shamelessness going around.
"Easy, Tony," Steve said, his face pale in the now lit cavern.  "I'll be fine.  You need to go first."
* * *
Tony pushed Steve away, his vision tunneling.  "Change back," he said as his eyes felt wet.
As Steve sketched a picture of Rhodey smiling in uniform, Steve thought about what he had said.
"I'm awake," Steve said, finally allowing Tony to move away.  He did not sound happy about this fact.  Steve shook his whole body and let out a small flame once Tony was clear, glaring at the glowing moss like morning was a personal affront.
"That's insane," Tony said.
"You're angry," Steve said softly, as he helped a gun-less Leon to a nearby chair.
Finally he came to a door.  Unlike the rest of the temple, this one was made of wood and the metal around it gave way to stone.  He could feel Steve's relief at that, though it felt a bit distant.
The ground got closer and Tony figured that Steve's head was down.  "I know," Steve said.
"But I..."  Susan said, telling herself firmly not to cry.  This was an easy mission.  Kes always laughed and called her a crybaby, but Kes wasn't here right now.  And if Susan messed this up, she'd be just like the resistance leader who...
"Is that when Tony started acting strangely?" Steve asked.  Bruce nodded.  Guilt flared up; Steve had been the one to suggest contacting Doom.  "I don't like the sound of this."
The silence this time was more comfortable, and Steve allowed himself to enjoy what contact Tony would permit.  He could live with this.  Maybe someday, Tony wouldn't need an old relic like him.  But until then, Steve was going to stick with him and put his stubborn head to good use.  He was bound to make more mistakes, but he wasn't going to give up.
"Dr. Foster also wishes to relay that if you touch it before she has the chance to examine it, she will do some rather undesirable things."
He'd been alone in the ice, even if he didn't remember it.  He didn't want anyone else to go through that.
Two hours after that the Hulk was roaring, carefully cradling the broken suit as he pulled the rest of the building off Tony.  Steve had to be held back by Thor, pale and trembling, so that he wouldn't rush into the dangerous wreckage as well.
"That... doesn't sound good," Tony said, knowing too well how Hydra was particularly adept at finding or making weapons that could change the tide of the War.  If they were still refining the ZEMO chemical, he could bet a dragon would be very useful to them, and the thought made Tony sick.  "You see the future, supposedly.  What can I do to change it?"
Steve took his hand, rubbing gently at the joints to make him relax his fist, then checked to make sure the IV wasn't disturbed.  Tony wanted to bat him away, but he couldn't.  He wanted to revel in the feel of Steve's hands covering his own, but he couldn't do that either.
He waited until Ms. Potts looked back at the window before raising his eyebrows at Steve.  Steve, for his part, hid his sweaty palms behind his back and tried to think innocent thoughts like Bucky had coached him.  Kittens, puppies, and the American way.
Stark tried to yank away, but Steve kept his grip strong.  He didn't know if this was the right course of action.  In fact, he was pretty sure it might make things worse.  But Steve wasn't backing down on this one.  The fact that Stark was opening up at all was a marvel, and he wasn't going to let this chance pass him by.
"And why should I trust that promise?" Steve asked.
Of course.  Steve always appeared when he was getting frustrated or questioning why he couldn't figure out even easy things.  In the end, Steve had even suggested putting off their date if Tony was on a roll.  How close had Tony been to giving in?  If he hadn't already been shaking, he would have shuddered.  As it was, Thor had to help turn his head as he dry heaved.  The Red Skull had used
"Takes a while to get used to the notion, don't it?  Keeping the circle small, that I can understand though.  Pity having him at SHIELD wouldn't have worked," Fury said.  He took Tony's wrist and pressed two fingers against where his pulse should be, then frowned.  "That is creepy.  The doctors are sure he's alive?"
"All the ones I found were for some expensive program," Steve replied with a sigh, pushing around a bit of ketchup with his french fry. "I didn't want to spend that much money when I could draw just as well on paper."
"I'll stick with Steve," Tony said, patting Steve's arm.  "But it's nice to meet you when you're not trying to kill me."
"I'm not the top of my class," she said, her cheeks having a light dusting of rose as she laughed.  "But at least I can still help with her homework.  Maybe one day she can help me with mine!"
"Please don't fight," Susan said.
He got a glare for his troubles.  "Of course not.  The armor would have told us."
"Really," Steve said mulishly, knocking Sam's legs down where he'd put them up on the table. "I'll ask FRIDAY about it tonight."
"Stay with me, Tony," Steve said, almost pleading.
"Isn't it a bit early for Christmas movies?" Steve asked.  An adorable confused look mingled with affection on his face, affection that was aimed at
"Shh," Steve said.  "I'm angry too.  But I don't give terrorists my home address when I'm angry."
That kicked the anger right out of him.  "I'm sorry to hear that," he said, feeling at a loss.  The rags talked about cheating all the time from what he'd seen, but not really about a break-up.  He wondered how they hushed that up.  And why.  "But I still don't think the favor Ms. Castillo owed you was for sex."
"I am upholding my side of the bargain," Doom said sharply.  "Doom is a man of his word, and Iron Man has fulfilled his role.  I would not be in his debt."
"But they're working," Steve said with a laugh, kissing Tony again.
"The ring!" Tony said, trying to turn.
Peggy pulled Tony closer with her tail as Wanda went to the balcony and took off, shielding him from the gust of hot air.
"I'll keep that in mind when I upgrade the security on this place.  Which will be soon," Tony grouched, offering Steve a hand up.  His codes were going to be changed and soon, and he was going to find out what mole Fury used to infiltrate the place.
"Bad weather stirring up the trolls and the goblins," Peggy said, her tail flicking to the side in worry.  Tony didn't let himself think about how there was weather underground, because that was more of a headache than he wanted to think about.  He
"Yeah," Steve said.  "Never got to test it."
Natasha and Thor burst through the door, followed closely by... Tony closed his eyes, hunching over.  He was still dreaming.  He had to be.
"Indeed, Captain."
"Mr. Stark, you shouldn't just head straight down to the workshop," Pepper said, her hands on her hips as he started to unload the equipment from the ship.  He needed to get a proper look at the Rescue armor, because something about the aerodynamics was off.
Tony concentrated on breathing in and out now that pain screamed in his ears like a banshee.  One breath at a time.  Freezing air dragged along his burning lungs, making it hard to draw another breath, puffing out in front of him to taunt him of his lost warmth.
Tony needed a hangover, not a concussion, to deal with this.  Better yet, a drunken black out.  He snorted, not caring about the jolt of pain that caused his head.  "You want to do this
"Don't..." Tony said, watching his breath in front of him in the last of the light that the little crystal gave off.  "Go.  Save...  I'm sorry."
Tony didn't reply, but kept petting Steve.  Neither of them went back to sleep, but the company kept the ache from haunting them too badly.
"But Cap reminds you to gosh, darn it, watch your language," Tony continued in that tone that meant he was annoying Cap.  "Keep shooting, Rhodey."
Tony who had turned him down the first time.
Clint, for his part, looked longingly at Bruce's tea, then up at Natasha.  She raised an eyebrow.  "Cruel, Nat.  I don't rate high enough in your affections?"
"You got it, Cap."
Steve started at the unfamiliar voice, automatically reaching for the shield that wasn't there, but back in his room.  Would he have time to get it?  Who-
did this happen?" Kes asked.
"I wasn't that bad," Steve said, giving her a mock glare. "Why do people like that sort of thing?" He didn't draw himself for the most part, and the proposal of drawing himself kissing another teammate was daunting.
Steve didn't ask how she had gotten his number, as JARVIS would probably give it to her if she asked.  "How are you today, ma'am?  It's pretty late there, isn't it?"
"Stark," Steve said, warning.  His patience was wearing too thin for his liking.
It was always Stark first.
Steve flushed and snapped, "Don't do that again."
So T'Challa
.  Whatever you do, you have to keep him safe.  Protect him.  He..."
"Tony?" Steve said, his eyes widening.  He didn't let Tony up though, and Tony got a very faint sense of unease coming from the dragon.  "I can't... I can't sense you in there.  Prove you're him."
The fact that Tony even had to ask him showed just how burned and scarred he was, even if Tony didn't realize it.  "Because you're important to one of my best friends," Steve said, considering his words with care.  "Because you've inspired loyalty from a lot of people despite making it hard to like you.  Because I never really thanked you for helping me calm down earlier.  Because I'd like to change those preconceptions I had about you.  And because I've never been one to back down from a challenge.  Iron Man must have told you that much at least."
Steve flushed.  "I didn't mean to scare any one.  I just ah... I eat a lot with the serum.  I'll pay you back."
"Believe me, Little Bear,
"Thor ain't the one with a god damned suicide note," Steve shouted.
"I can go, if that's what you want," Steve said, not looking at him.  There was an unspoken 'but I'd like to stay' that baffled Tony.  Was it the fact Steve had sent him in and now felt guilty?  Or that he knew Tony hated being alone in hospitals and he was just being a responsible team leader?  Either way, Tony didn't want it.
"They what?" Susan could hardly picture it.
"Tony, what are you talking about?  Of course I do," Steve said, hands going up to his shoulders to shake him gently.  "Hey, look at me.  Tony, what's going on?"
At first the light was small, but he kept up a continuous blast and soon it was nearly blinding.  He could feel the strain it was putting on the reactor, but he didn't dare stop.  He only stopped when the room started to shake and he heard Viper give a startled yell, his own breath heavy, and his heart pounding.  A sharp pain went through his heart, but the heart pump held up, keeping the broken organ still beating.
The blue dragon flattened closer to the ground, folding his wings against his back in a posture that looked like shame.  "He was thinking of armies!  And others that would follow him down to see the city!" the male voice said, apparently coming from the blue dragon.  "You know what happened the last time we let a human in.  He killed-" another name-feeling: Green, Gray and Brown.  Curiosity and wonder as wide and big as the cavern sky.  The scent of wind on a summer day, and the tang of sweet spices and minerals from the earth's secret places.  Deep magic that was as malleable as a branch in the wind..  "-and..."
Natasha shrugged.  "Just saying.  You don't tap that ass soon, it might get taken.  It
It was almost two weeks since they'd rescued the twins, and though he was an AI, Steve felt
She closed her eyes, shuttering out the comforting sight of the HUD.  She
"You're going to have to talk to me," Steve said after careful consideration of his words.  He promised himself he'd back off this time though if Tony said.  "Is it Doom?  What does he have over you?"
He had to make an account before he could really look through the site, but he only grumbled a little after FRIDAY assured him it was okay. Account made, he typed "Avengers" into the search bar and it came up with all sorts of different things, ranging from drawings, to text posts, to costumes, to pictures from their battles or interviews. Not all of them were good opinions either, but he was used to that. Or he was supposed to be used to that, not nearly breaking his tablet. He reminded himself everyone was entitled to their opinion.
"I'm sorry," Tony said, his throat feeling dry.  It didn't seem to matter.  Even as a bonded link he was a disappointment.  Steve had left right after the bonding and...
"But can you tell me what it looks like from the outside?" he asked, because he trusted her judgement on most things.
upset that Tony risked it in the long run.
He swallowed, then swallowed again, forcing his back straight as he took the rear exit to avoid the crowd that was going to form.  He managed to get five paces from the back door before he doubled over, dry heaving the empty stomach that had already upturned its contents once today.
The green dragon he saw in the cave wasn't just lying on the ground.  Tony watched as - Green, orange, white.  Sunlight on an open plain.  Dew drops in the morning and song.  Natural rhythm and a blooming daffodil - was wounded by a human she had been trying to save from a vicious pitch black wolf.  She tried to make it back to her mountain, to her brother, but the wound was too great.  She fell to the ground, barely managing to lift her head to look at the sky she could never return to.  She was going to die like this.  She couldn't-
"Should you be out of bed?" Steve asked, willing to place even odds that he shouldn't.
"Tony promised he'd work on a containment for the Hulk," Bruce said as they walked through the broken building.  "He didn't want to, but I convinced him.  And Iron Man will have a direct connection to my heart monitor watch.  JARVIS will alert the team if the Other Guy breaks loose."
Steve stifled a laugh, feeling a little guilty for not coming forward.  The butterfly flew along the bush, slowly bringing Tony closer to him anyway.  He supposed he'd be found out soon.
Instead of hitting him, the man raised his hand and stopped the shield in mid-air.  That wasn't a good sign.  "Who are you?" Steve asked.
"You're not angry?"  Leon asked.
"From what I heard, neither did the other one," Tony said.  It was probably not his best idea to remind Steve of all the reasons not to trust him, but Tony felt a little concerned about how trusting the dragons were.  It was probably a side effect of telepathy, but it could be dangerous for them if other people wandered down here.  He felt a surprising surge of protectiveness at the thought that left him a little speechless.
Steve stopped moving, his hands coming up so that he held Tony's face.  Tony closed his eyes and sighed as Steve's thumbs brushed over his cheek bones.  "Steve..."
He fisted his hands.  "Right," Tony said, trying to detangle himself from Steve's limbs.  "I'll go-"
Leon looked away.  He wanted to ask, but couldn't find the words.
Tony forced his eyes open.  He knew instinctively that Steve wasn't going to make it to him in time.  Three heads were attacking Steve now and there was no way he could get to Tony before the claw came back down again, this time to crush him for good.  He tried to use the thrusters to push away, but they sputtered and died.
"I think it was more to protect Stark from SHIELD than the other way around," Fury said, watching Steve carefully.  "He felt that with his original failing, SHIELD would only make the matter worse.  With what I know now, I agree with him.  Didn't always, which is why I sent Natasha in to get around Coulson, but her cover was blown too soon due to another agent's bad call."
"Why not?  It's working so far," a bitter voice responded.  Steve forced himself to relax, recognizing the voice if not the tone.  Stark.  The billionaire had a guest over, though why he was in the Avengers' common area was a mystery.  Maybe he was just showing it off to his guest?  He'd never, not once to Steve's knowledge, actually come up to the Avengers' quarters after he'd finished designing them.
Steve was going to take his embarrassment over how he acted while meeting Hedy Lamarr to the grave.  "I was a propaganda piece, not a movie star," he insisted.
"It took us a long time to find another way down to this place," she said.  She kneeled down in front of him, tracing her way down his chest until she stopped at the heart pump.  Tony stilled completely.  He wanted to flinch away from her fingers, but there was no where for him to go.  "But you have saved us an even longer time avoiding the dragons and searching for the crystals.  You have served Hydra well, Mr. Stark."
"Oh," Steve said.  He felt a little taken aback by the admission and his wings fluttered out.  "Is that normal for humans?"
"Shh," Cap said.  "It's okay.  You'll be okay."
Viper reached down and picked up the HT, glaring at him with her one visible eye.  "Let the dragon go, Cobra," she said into the HT.
Peggy was there when he came out for dinner.  He sensed faint disapproval from her, but he got the feeling it was for both him and Steve.  He didn't back down, however, and he could hear her sigh.  "Come on," Peggy said, greeting him with a touch to his cheek that she made sure he saw coming.  He returned it grudgingly.  "At least one of you is through sulking for the night..."
"Why?  You want me to tell you everything just so you can tell me how crazy I am?"  Bitterness wrapped around him like ice.
"Mm-hm," Steve said, kissing Tony's temple.  "The grey that was right here," he said, moving to Tony's eyebrow.  "The small scar that was right here.  The wrinkles-" Steve kissed the corner of his eye, "-right here."
He looked at the murals as he went, wondering again who had made them.  The dragons never came out this far and Steve didn't even like sticking his head through the gate to yell at him if he was late for lunch or dinner.  Perhaps they had been made before the dragons sealed themselves underground?  But surely not even 'magical' dragon colors would still be this vivid from that long ago.  Then he pushed that thought to the back of his mind, because if any of the dragons heard it, they would probably tell him it was magic.
Steve swallowed down bile and focused on breathing.  He coughed, glad nothing came up.  Clutching at his shield, he pushed himself up just in time to meet another blast.  It caught the shield, but still sent him flying.
for Steve, but he thought of Steve and slowly the cavern faded away to Steve curled up against one of the lava baths.  He could physically feel the warmth of the lava, though it wasn't too hot for him this time.  The strangest thing though was that Tony still felt a little cold despite it.  He couldn't actually see Steve, and Tony was almost jarred out of the contact when he realized he was seeing out of Steve's eyes.
He punched through it just as the door slid open to reveal a wide-eyed Tony Stark.
* * *
But his worrying was for naught when Tony waltzed in like he owned the place, which he did technically.  Bruce was used to Tony's antics, Thor amused by them, and Steve was starting to see the kinks in Tony's own personal armor when the day started with Mario Cart and went well.  Even if Tony bemoaned Bruce being better than him at backgammon.
"That we've been captured with no contact for a while and that we'd like to stay that way a bit longer."  Natasha was hiding all of her tells, which was a tell in and of itself.
"He said 'Women aren't fit for war,'" Pepper mimicked in a pretty fine impersonation of Jarvis's throaty bellow.  "
Tony took a bite of the meat.  It was a little unevenly cooked, but edible.  "I know," Tony said.  There was just something that set Steve apart from the other dragons.  He was
"You're so tense," Steve said as Tony placed the mug on the table, hands still tightly wrapped around the warmth.
"From what I hear he's only been snacking on fruit," Steve said, not rising to the bait, but only just.
"In the video, he said-"  Steve sounded pained when he spoke, his voice tugging at Tony's heart.  But it couldn't... he was
Fury noted his use of Tony's given name with a faint look of surprise.  Steve refused to back down from that, looking back at Fury and keeping his chin up despite his embarrassment for the slip. He didn't know why he was keeping up 'Mr. Stark' with Fury and the others, but he suspected it might have to do with some denial of his own and he wasn't going to think about that right now.
live up to the legend.  And his posters.  Oh, God, this was so
"Has anyone shown you
Then everything stopped.  The quake, the noise, everything.  Tony caught his breath, pulling himself back on the ledge.  Was it over?
"Hello, me," Projection Tony said, his voice dull and hollow.
"Don't worry about me," Tony said.  "I'm good at surviving too."
"Yeah," Susan said, smiling softly.  "But someone's gotta fight."
"Damn it, Tony, would you let me
"We just watched my best friend kill himself to spare the world, and that's all you can say?  And you were just going to let him-" Rhodey said, pivoting around and walking towards Doom.  Steve barely managed to keep him from falling over with his cane forgotten and his legs still not able to hold him.
"Captain America would never work with a dictator!" Steve said, fighting to keep the smile from over coming his mock outrage.  "But Steve Rogers knows tactics and that you can't always do something by yourself.  What do you think?"
There was pride and excitement in Tony's eyes, though it was hard for Steve to read human body language.  Steve reached out a hesitant claw to touch Tony's covered hand.  The awe and wonder doubled and Steve himself felt pride at Tony's accomplishments.  He wondered how-
Sharon giggled, a sound like soft chimes.  Peggy just lightly cuffed him on the shoulder with her wing tip as a reminder to behave.
, because the happy memories just let him drift.  His father.  Putting in the heart pump.  The War.  The long War...
"We were not aware you wished it to be a secret from us."
Tony looked out over Steve's wing at the dragon crystals that hung over the buildings.  They lit up the houses below, but the city itself was quiet.  Too quiet.  There were always songs and music till late at night with the dragons flying to and fro over head to visit.  Most times Tony was lulled to sleep by the soft hum of the city.
"I love you," Tony said as the Skrulls tried to tear apart the armor.
Steve wondered how many times Tony just wanted a bit of positive attention growing up.  From the files, he hadn't gotten a lot of it from his father.  Or apparently his surrogate father.  To be considered a good guy for once in his life, he could see the appeal.  Iron Man was someone people
The small light on meant it was recording, and Tony grinned broadly at the camera.  "Okay, listen up, past me.  There's two theories about this.  Either I am creating an alternate universe by sending this back, or I'm giving myself much needed instructions and I'm not chancing the latter.  Either way, good news!  We did it."
"What if I mess this up?"  Steve asked.  "Ms. Potts said he'd try to start a fight and I don't have the best temper either.  He's Iron Man's boss.  What if I just make things worse?"
Tony raised an eyebrow.  "What's been going on?"
Tony's mouth pressed into a thin line and he stood up, not once even glancing at Steve as he tossed the tablet down.  "You know what?  This was a mistake.  Stay up here if you like, but I'm-"
Steve didn't know what hurt more, Tony's lack of faith or the fact that he was right.  He walked back over to the tray, unsure if he should take it back or not.  This wasn't what he'd planned at all.  But when he got there, he noticed a surprising amount of paper diagrams that he'd ignored as general paperwork when he'd first come in.  "I thought you did everything in holograms?" Steve blurted out, sifting through the pages.  It looked like the machine Tony was working on.
"He should be here," Kestrel said, her voice fragmented until Tony fixed the audio codes.  "I don't know why -"
"I've missed my friend a lot lately," Steve said, smiling through it despite how much the word 'friend' cut him.  "Maybe you know him?  He's a real wise cracker who walks around in a tin can all day and always knows the right thing to say to make me feel at home."
"Thank you..."  Steve peered at the uniform and tried to recall Airforce ranks.  Those were new to him in this century, and he hadn't given the ranks much attention when there was so much else to learn.  "Sergeant," he finished, hoping he remembered correctly.
"Are you two being disgusting and romantic again?" Rhodey asked.  "Because if I was interrupting-"
"We're not Skrulls!" Susan said, looking to Steve for help.
Tony nodded, then thought of a clear picture of the clasps.  "Run your claw along here and here," he said, pointing to the sections.  "And push down on the panel in the back as you do.  No, closer to the top of my inner arm.  There.  And open the catch.  You won't be able to see it, but you should be able to feel it when it pops open.  Be careful of the wires.  I don't know how well dragons take to being electrocuted, but humans don't do well and I've been banged up as it is.  Also, I still need the gauntlet to function.  There's a few more catches on the inside, but it should come apart easily enough after that.
"Captain?" Fury asked.
Tony checked his watch, then looked back at the portal.  "And that's probably all I should tell you.  Frustrating that I can't give you a step by step, but with the other people who might be listening, I shouldn't say too much.  Though this will go right under Kang's radar as too low tech, Jane figured it out enough so keep an eye on her.  It took us nine times to get it right, but we did finally, so keep up the good work."
"She seemed harmless!"
," Tony demanded.
He could only guess that meant she was impatient and she knew the direct approach usually worked best with him.  That didn't mean he was just going to tell her though, especially not after she insulted his chicken chunks.  "How long what?"
"Of course."
Kang charged after him, leading with a punch that was choreographed and easy to duck under.  He grabbed Kang's arm as it swung at him, leveraging it on his shoulder and using Kang's weight to toss him over.
"I won't look if you don't want me to," Steve said firmly.  "Though I might...  That will take some getting used to for me, but I'll try to remember to ask next time.  I know it's difficult for you."
"What's our status?" Tony asked.
Tony looked torn, glancing between the armor and the door.  "I'll make sure no one steals any of the parts," Steve said, then he hesitated.  If it were anyone else...
"Steve..."
stick around and visit the man who had saved him.  He could also put off their talk awhile longer and go through JARVIS's code with a fine-tooth comb to make sure Hydra hadn't succeeded in leaving any surprises.  The latter would test Steve's resolve to actually talk about 'this'.  Considering the last time Tony had brought it up he'd been shot down, he was leaning towards the latter option at the moment.  Once burned, twice shy, and all of that.
"Succeed in what?" Steve asked, reminding himself not to take out his frustration on his CO.
in the dreams.  Tony took a step forward before he could stop himself.
Tony felt his throat constrict.  Steve would have had better chances without having to worry about him.  And the idiot just did all of that like it was
"Tony?" he asked gently.
"Aye, Tony.  We'll get you out," Thor said, and Tony blinked as something vaguely warm was wrapped around him.  "Captain, I will return once he is safe."
That thought sobered him, killing his curiosity.  As much as he'd like to explore, he wasn't an adventurer any more.  And the War was so long...
Zemo leaned over him, bringing the needle closer to his eye as-
"There," Tony said, pulling his hand back once Steve finished.  "You've done your patriotic duty to patch up a wounded team mate.  You can go be heroic elsewhere."
"I don't think Colonel Rhodes will be drinking coffee for a while when he wakes up," the dark-skinned nurse said, though she giggled behind her clip board.
Steve understood, even if Tony didn't say anything more.  The grip on his shoulders was released, and Tony was pulled into a proper hug.  "I hate the cold," Steve replied, his voice almost lost in the howling of the wind.  "And planes.  Especially crashing ones."
He stayed like that for a long while, not sure if he was guarding the door or if he couldn't bear to go too far.  He tried to sort through the mess in his head, but the more Steve tried, the more confusing it got.
Tony took his hand off Wanda's flank like he'd been burned.  He was breathing heavily as his heart pounded, blinking back the emotion of the vision.
The movie was fun, and Steve was charmed by how far Willow was willing to go for the baby.  It wasn't twenty minutes into the movie before he felt hard metal against his shoulder.  He looked over to see Iron Man's head against his shoulder.  The normally blue lights where his eyes would be were flicked off.
Steve followed his gaze to the tablet.  "Are you on a break through?  We can order in.  I know how it's been frustrating you lately."
"Steve, you know I can't - what are you doing?"
"The plane was only so big," Steve finished for him.  "He couldn't make the apology in person?"
Steve sighed, rubbing his forehead with his palm as he calmed his own temper.  That hurt more than a lot of what Tony had said.  That memory of Peggy was one he clung to.  He shook his head to clear it.  He could worry about that later.  "Stop that," Steve ordered, though gentler than the last demand.  "I get it.  You're angry.  But lashing out and pushing me away won't help."
"What happened?" Steve asked, pushing aside his mixed feeling about Natasha spying on Stark like that.
"Yup," Tony said, sighing as he hit the wrong block.  "Realized it was a mistake.  We're good to go.  Unless you're mad about the whole privacy thing, but I think I learned my lesson on that."
"I've slept in worse places," Steve said with a grin.  "And this way I get to see both you
Steve pushed Iron Man against a shelf with his arm at Iron Man's neck.  Not the most effective move with the armor, but it got whoever was in there to stop talking.  "You are
"So tell me then," Tony said, using every trick he knew to get around the pain.  "What's a pretty doll like you doing in a place like this?"
"I'm going to find you," Steve repeated.  "Stop arguing."
"Ha!  I knew it," Stark said, snapping his fingers.
"If this suit is supposed to fly, where are its wings?" Peggy asked, craning to get a better look at his back.
"Natasha!"
The new uniform was easier to move in, he'd give it that.  He wasn't too keen to find out if it really did stop futuristic robot energy blasts, however, so he kept his shield close to deflect the beams.  Thankfully, decapitating robots in close quarters was just as satisfying as throwing his shield, and seeing the wires up close as the machine stumbled back fulfilled a dark desire Steve usually tried to ignore.  It got his blood running the way nothing else ever did and as much as Steve hated it, he
She flew straight at the Skrull, going full throttle.  The speed ripped at her stomach, but she ignored it and tackled her to the ground.
Slowly Steve's tail unwound from Tony's waist.  He rubbed his cheek against Tony's before pulling away.  "Stay in contact," Steve said.  "I'll look in when I can, but I need to keep an eye out here in case of attack."
* * *
"Tony!"  There were hands gripping his shoulders, forcing him to sit back down on the bed.  His hand tightened around the card.
Suddenly, the whole chef routine made a lot more sense.  Well, Tony-sense.  For normal people, this was still baffling, but Tony sometimes lived by his own warped sense of logic that one could learn to translate eighty percent of the time with a little effort according to Rhodey and Pepper, and Steve had recently been putting in that effort for reasons he was trying not to think about too hard.  Steve was still working on his average, but this one was easy.
"I'm sorry," he said, knowing full well how unkind humanity could be.  This whole damn War sometimes felt like one atrocity after the next, and it shamed him deeply to admit it wasn't just the Axis Powers that committed them.  What he'd seen the few times he'd been sent to the front lines...  "Must be lonely, living down here by yourself and hiding from the dragons."
Voices were more likely to wake him up, and Steve grumbled, curling further in on himself and away from whoever it was.  It wasn't the most comfortable he'd ever been but he had enough problems sleeping that he wanted more, damn it.
"Okay?" Steve said, wondering what he had gotten himself into.
Tony had the same expression from the last time Steve had brought him food.  It was a mixture of touched and baffled, and Steve realized he probably should have begun with the snack.  Food struck a chord with Tony that Steve didn't quite understand but was definitely willing to use as an ice breaker.
"Do human faces often turn red?" Wanda asked, reminding Tony of his surroundings.
Tony's head shot off Steve's shoulder.  "You're what?" he asked, his eyes wide.
"Sam, Dum Dum," Steve said, his mental voice anguished as he paused to gather his thoughts among the sea of loss, almost choking on the names even though they weren't actually vocalized.  "Keep an eye on Sharon.  Make sure she doesn't create...  Make sure she doesn't make more of the heads."
"It's just a skull," Tony said, swallowing hard, feeling a sense of trepidation.  "A red one."
"Wanda, you can't mean..."  Steve said uncertainly.
"You left me before!" Tony shouted, pulling away more forcefully.  Steve let him go.  "You left when I woke up, then again when Wanda brought me back.  And now you're asking me to stay?"
Steve blinked.  He was missing something here.  He could have sworn Jan said she was making a super-villain outfit.  "Why are you turning to crime?"  It couldn't be for money, because both she and Tony helped fund the Avengers and had their own well-earned and large fortunes.
"There's too many of them, Cap," Susan replied, her voice strained.  "I can't - You have to get Kes and Leo out of there."
Rhodey spoke slowly, letting each point sink in before moving to the next one with an efficiency that Tony always appreciated about him.  It calmed the slowly whirling thoughts in his head that panicked him since they weren't at his normal speed, and Tony nodded, allowing Thor to pick him up.
Steve's arms tightened around him, and Tony realized he was straddling Steve's lap as Steve tilted his head up to kiss him.  He wasn't exactly sure

He needed to get close.  Steve threw his shield again, angling it so that she'd have to dodge towards him, rather than away.  He rushed her.  She tried to avoid it, flying up, but not fast enough.  The shield caught her in the leg, shaking her off balance, and Steve grabbed her foot, anchoring her in place and using her shaky balance to throw her down.
his lunches with Tony, even more when the super heroing business was slow and they talked about other things.  And Tony was obviously attractive, no one could deny that, especially not when he wore that red shirt under his suit and took off his jacket to reveal the vest underneath.
Steve paused at that, then got out the blend JARVIS spoke of.  That explained why Tony and Colonel Rhodes had come down here that night of their argument.  It was a weird quirk, but he supposed billionaires were entitled to be a little eccentric.
He'd had plenty of dreams about Iron Man, but those never brought him to completion.  Steve was attracted to his fellow Avenger, but not to the armor itself.  Any kind of dream with Iron Man's armor coming off ended up too vague and left to his imagination.  This was obviously not a problem with Tony.  Steve swallowed hard, trying not to think about the details of the dream or Natasha's words about Tony's tongue.
"I..."  He hadn't thought about that, but now that he had, the thought was very, very tempting.  But truthfully Steve wasn't really sure why he had come down here.
sigh after his long lost best friend?  Though, sorry to hear about that, by the way.  I can put out feelers again if you want?"
Peggy let him rub her cheek in apology, and he tried to come up with a less touchy subject.  "What are these disturbances in the north?"
He started to realize he had no idea where Iron Man was hiding.  He looked around, the garden thankfully not too torn up by their fight.  "Iron Man?" he called out softly.
"I'll see what I can do," Fury said, drier than the Sahara.
"So what's with the depressing drawing?" Iron Man asked.
Tony groaned, the pain in his head pounding harder than his heart.  "Well, well.  Look what we have here," a familiar voice said.  Tony opened his eyes, trying to move his hands only to find even more pain.  He cried out, arms tied behind him, and he guessed that the arm with his gauntlet was broken.  The wires were pulled out of the heart pump too, leaning down from his ripped open shirt that no longer guarded the heart pump.  He wouldn't be able to fire it like this, and his heart was completely open and visible in ways that made him have a full body shudder in a way that had nothing to do with the cold.
cheeks.
"I'm not," Bruce said, sighing softly.  "But I did study the serum for years, remember.  I know what an increased metabolism can do to a person when they don't keep up with it."
