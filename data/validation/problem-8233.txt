“No need to rush away, Cap. No amazingly hot sex is complete without post-coital snuggles. Relax before you get all tense and we have to start all over.” Tony followed up by grabbing the blanket off the couch and settling it down over both of them, laying his head over Steve’s chest. Steve thought maybe he should protest this, but it did feel nice to be pressed up together like this. Tony warmed the chills back out of him. Surely, a few minutes wouldn’t hurt. He closed his eyes and drifted off to sleep to the feel of Tony breathing softly over his heart.
Steve wasn’t going to give into these urges again.
Tony’s voice warbled and he closed his eyes again. Some of the tension that had been residing in Steve’s chest for the past few weeks suddenly began to uncoil. Tony couldn’t possibly still be playing a game in his current condition, which meant he was telling the truth, had been telling the truth the whole time. The suspicions and paranoia retreated in the light of this revelation. Steve reached down to unlace and remove his boots.
“You know what I want.”
“You know things would be a hell of a lot less complicated if you would just let me blow you. Orgasms are a great cure for sleepless nights.”
“It’s mainly so people can monitor their health and physical activity. Though if you don’t actually care about exercise, I can see why it would seem useless.”
Steve opened his eyes, unaware he had ever closed them. He turned his head to the side, cracking his bones before meeting Tony’s eyes.
They would have them all.
He reached the box out towards Steve, who took it with trepidation. The bright yellow wrapping paper failed to cheer him as he diligently peeled the tape back and removed the wrapping in one piece. Tony rolled his eyes at Steve’s caution, but it was nice paper and Steve saw no point in ripping it to bits when he could easily reuse it this way.
Tony grabbed his hands.
“Tony”
It had taken time, but they’d finally managed to narrow down the Hydra activity to the Rockies. Steve had been tempted to go it alone, but he wasn’t stupid enough to think he’d be able to handle a twisted version of himself as well as a twisted Tony solo. Especially, if he brought the real Tony with him; they were barely functioning around each other. They’d assembled a team of whoever was available, whichever Avengers felt like coming along. Everything had gone well. Too well. They’d stormed the base, taking out Hydra goons left and right. And then there he’d been: the other him. They fought hard, the rematch Steve had hoped he’d never have to fight. But it was all just a distraction. The other Tony had been nowhere in sight, and then Steve had taken a repulsor hit to the back and the other Tony, the AI made real, was there grabbing Steve’s evil counterpart and flying off. There had been a machine, the other Tony apologizing for the “change of plans”, and a flash of blinding light. And then there had been the real Tony, frantic at the keyboard, shouting about the multiverse.
It was easy enough from there to coax Tony into taking a shower once they had returned and eaten some lunch. Tony had been the one to suggest that Steve join him on the flimsy excuse that they should conserve water while they were off the grid. Still, Steve hadn’t found much point to argue when Tony led him back to the bathroom. If Tony thought he was ready for more touching than simple hand-holding and quiet kisses, then who was Steve to deny him?
“Even more astounding, you only go a few times a week at most! They tried to get me to tell them whatever secret workout routine you do at home to keep all those rock-hard muscles of yours in tip-top shape.”
“Tony?”
Tony managed a lazy smile as his eyes trailed over Steve’s body.
Steve couldn’t help the small smile that bloomed across his face. Leave it to Tony to suggest they fuck not five minutes after landing in foreign territory. Steve looked around and saw nothing but trees and grass in the immediate area. Tony had probably scanned for electronic surveillance as soon as they landed. Despite his reservations about this plan Tony seemed to have hatched, Steve felt himself harden. Adrenaline from the previous fight and argument spurred his arousal onward. Steve channeled the last of his aggression into their kiss as he allowed Tony to pull him down.
“Tony, he was willing to send Sharon to Dr. Faustus, at the end. We need to get you tested for signs of mental manipulation.”
Steve pulled his fingers free and trailed them along Tony’s jaw to curl up the back of his head and grab onto his hair. He’d expected it to feel stiff or maybe slick with product, but was pleasantly surprised by the softness he found there instead. He used his grip to leverage Tony forward, pulling him down as Steve raised himself up to meet in a harsh kiss. Tony was panting, pulling in gasping breaths against Steve’s mouth. Steve held his head in place as he kissed Tony thoroughly. It occurred to him as he licked into Tony’s mouth that kissing was a level of intimacy that probably didn’t belong in whatever the hell they were doing here. He hadn’t really thought about kissing Tony. He’d just decided that Tony’s mouth was being wasted on his fingers and had wanted a taste of it. The brush of facial hair was a shock, though not an unpleasant one as it turned out. The foreign sensation spurred him on to press closer, bring his hand down to palm his face, rubbing at the bristles. Tony kept grinding down on him through it all.
It was as steam began to fill the space between them and form glistening drops on Tony’s skin that a new thought skittered across Steve’s mind.
“Why not?”
Steve wasn’t sure he’d be able to watch on his own. His mind raced, trying to imagine what the video could possibly contain. Brutal murder? Hundreds of followers hailing Hydra? Or maybe it was something Rogers had done while Steve had still been trapped in the cube? What kind of footage would an insane version of himself possibly deem important enough to go through all this trouble?
Tony’s hands hovered reverently over Steve’s legs, not close enough to pass through.
“Steve? Will you…will you hold my hand for a bit?”
“I’ll say it again if that’s what you need. I’m sorry. I should have told you about your parents as soon as I found out. But Hydra was taking over SHIELD and we had bigger problems to worry about. And soon we were going on raids and everything was good and I didn’t want to spoil it. Then Ultron happened and you took off. It just never seemed like the right time to bring it up. And what was I even supposed to say? ‘Hey Tony. You remember that accident that left you an orphan? Turns out it wasn’t an accident at all. Hydra just wanted your parents dead. No idea why though. And whoever ordered the hit is likely dead now anyway so there’s not much you can do about it. Just wanted to dredge up your pain and make it worse.’ Is that what you wanted?”
That was an answer Steve could live with. This Tony wanted to help Steve save the world. This Tony said he loved him. Whether that was true or not, Steve thought he could make this work for now and plan for anything that may come later. He placed the champagne flute back into Tony’s gauntlet then picked up his own glass.
“Then you couldn’t either.”
Steve woke up fully clothed and alone the next morning wrapped in soft sheets that did not belong on his bed. They smelled like hot metal and scotch. Steve remembered that smell fondly. Fuck.
It figured that Tony would try to put on a brave face in order to give Steve whatever he thought he wanted.
Tony shook his head and focused back on the screen. Steve tried to make sense of it all. He knew the other him was delusional, but how far would he go, if he were to truly go after Tony, how much was he capable of?
“Yes, I would!”
“You need to get checked, scanners or no scanners.”
Tony took his lube-and-semen-coated hand and began stroking his dick, which had remained hard, lying up against his stomach this whole time.
“Tony, tell me what we’re dealing with here. What is it?”
Five minutes in and it was apparent that this cartoon was designed for an audience much younger than Steve. On the plus side, Steve had learned how to say “up,” “down,” and “nearby” in Spanish. Fury had been rather insistent that in addition to Arabic, Spanish would be a very good language to learn.  Steve had been acclimating to modern English through prime time for a few weeks now. It stood to reason that television could help with his other language problems.
The jet landing disrupted Steve’s thoughts. He went through the motions of disembarking and debriefing. It was nearly as awkward as the flight home had been.
“Those are completely different and you know it. You lied because you knew I wouldn’t approve of this. How could you do this to me? You can’t just pick out a shiny new Earth and think that makes it home!”
“This is how it starts, Tony. This is how it always starts. You lied to me!  I thought we were going to be different from them. I thought we were going to be better than Stark and Rogers.”
Tony’s eyes flickered with something Steve couldn’t read. Eyes were supposed to be the windows to the soul. Did computers even have souls?
“Gu,” Steve managed to get out. His voice caught in his throat after the disuse. How long had they been here? He cleared his throat to try again. “Good.” It came out stronger this time. “Really good, Tony.” Steve would swear that he could feel the force of Tony’s smile behind him. It was clearly evident in his voice. Steve warmed. Tony was happy that he’d made him happy. He shouldn’t think about that too much.
The words were a slap to his face and Steve flushed red at the obscenity. Tony stood up and moved to walk away but Steve caught his arm.
Steve came back to the room as he shifted and realized he was hard. He glanced around at the others nervously, but no one was paying him any mind. Pietro and Wanda were leaving. Hawkeye was arguing with them, no surprise there. Jan was talking at Tony while he gulped down more and more liquor. His Adam’s apple bobbed as he swallowed. Some of the alcohol had missed his mouth and a droplet very slowly trailed its way down through his stubble. Steve hadn’t noticed before, but Tony had left his shirt mostly unbuttoned. Steve wasn’t fond of liquor, but he wondered how it would taste mixed with Tony’s skin and sweat. Steve was saved from wondering where the hell that thought had come from by Venom bursting through the living room wall.
They’d lost them. Tony had managed to piece together that his counterpart had built a machine to hop across the multiverse. He’d used Reed’s old tech to view different planes of existence until he’d found one that was ripe for world domination. Steve knew his own counterpart wouldn’t give up on this world, what he perceived to be his, but it sure would be a hell of a lot easier to conquer with entire other Earth’s worth of an army fighting on Hydra’s side.
-No I want the green one- Tony at this moment has tears going down his pink cheeks
-Wait a minute baby, I’m just gonna change you’re brother. Both of you are a little a smelly don’t you think-
The two babies now were crying his eyes out. And Bruce trying everything to calm them down.
-Bucky give it back- Tony yells running chasing his brother
"Not yet, Baby. I need to change you of that wet nappy and then you can go play." Steve said, resting Bucky on top of the changing table. Thor and Loki left the room to give the two some privacy.
-I’m sorry Daddy I was just playing- Loki said fresh tears going down his cheeks
Tony nods his head.
“Thank you V”
-No Tony I’m not, I’m really sorry I blame you for what happened, it wasn’t your fault was that stupid door-
Thanks for reading, if anyone have a request you can do it
-What happened here- a very mad Thor ask
He didn’t like to see his two babies angry with each other, was something hard to see.
-um? Steve? I have something to tell you but please be calm- Bruce said slowly
“Hay baby” Jane opened her arms picking up Loki giving him kisses all over his face while the boy giggled happily in his moms arms. Thor then when over them kissing  Jane on the lips earning a whine from  Loki causes both Thor and Jane to laugh.
"Sorry, Daddy. Loki wanna play with Bucky.  I didn't want him to cry." Loki said through his tears, sniffling quietly.
“Teddy!” Loki scream exited picking up his bear and hugging it really tight he went over his parents bed and start jumping with the bear in his hands giggling happily.
Thor picks up the two babies. He first change Tony about of that wet nappy and then do the same with Bucky.  He then take the Little’s to the playroom. to then take loki to the potty and then bring it back to the playroom.
So that’s how things in the house had been lately.
While the three of them were playing Thor said
Steve started
Steve took Tony to the nursery where he dress him in fresh nappy, making sure to apply good rash cream and he put him  blue pajamas, also a blue dummy.
Thor exited the room to go to make Loki a bottle of warm milk
Thor headed for the diaper bag only to remember that he did not have extra underwear.
He the turned to Tony, "Okay baby your next, let's see that diaper of you"
“He’s doing well, we had kind of a problem yesterday when he ate a little to much and believe those diapers smell like hell”
"Loki, please calm yourself. You're much too loud." Thor said, adjusting tony in his lap.
And it all started that morning.
“Promise?”
“Okay Baby Im gonna change you right away” “Tony do you need a change” Steve ask while also touching Tony’s diaper and in fact he was dry.
-No baby we are going to the tower but I promise you, once Uncle Steve is all better they can come and you can show them your room- Thor said
"Hey don't cry Baby, Daddy doesn't like to see his baby sad. Do you want a warm bottle of milk?" Asked Steve, trying to comfort Bucky.
“Okay Daddy bye” Clint said grabbing Bucky’s hand while Steve was carrying Tony.
“I’m glad you are enjoying it” Steve respond with a smile
It wasn’t a lie. Yesterday Bucky had told Steve that he feel bad for saying that was  Tonys fault. Bucky knee he hit himself with the door. He was just to ashamed to admit the truth. That and also the fact that he thought Tony hate him now.
"Owie" Tony cried
-Okay I will count to ten and you will hide I would fine you okay- Bucky said
“Shhhh come on baby’s, shhhh” steve said but the two babies continue crying.
SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK!
“Hey Thor”
-Shhh, babies come on is okay. It was an accident it wasn’t anyone’s fault- Steve try to say
"Boo is okay, I wasn't that mad I'm just tired" steve kissed Buckys cheek "you are just a tired little boy aren't you"
“Don’t worry Steve we understand that this my be a little to much for your little kids and besides this happened with just the two of them I cannot imagine how things are gonna go with the other little ones” Dan explains
“Then why people keep saying it” Eddie cry rubbing his tired eyes with his little fist while playing with his hair,  venom manifested in front of him one of his tentacles wiping Eddie’s tears.
-I want that- Tony said pointing to a green car
Today wasn’t the best day for Steve sake. Both of his boys had been in a horrible mood all morning. First was Tony refusing a well needed diaper change, clamming he didn’t need one But to be honest he really needed one it was a very stinky nappy in Steve opinion. After the change he let tony crawl around the nursery while he went over to Bucky who decide he was a big boy and didn’t need to listen his Daddy.
"I'm not gonna talk about this now, please let's go to bed will discuss this in the morning come on off to bed" steve said picking up Tony checking his diaper to find it clean at least.
Sugar is evil for Steve !
Going over Tony’s crib Steve woke tony up the same way he did with Bucky.
-was funny- they reply in the last minute before they close three eyes.
“Me too, Wanna go to park” Bucky said standing up and going to search for his Daddy.
"Its gonna hurt?" He whimpers
“Shh come on boys why are we so moody today” Steve start rocking both babies as they continue crying both firmly clutched tightly Steve's shirt.
“Anne! Dan! Hi I’m glad you came” Steve said happily letting the door open
Steve led Tony to the bathroom where he quickly stripped him of his clothes, leaving him alone in his diaper while he prepared the tub. When it was at a good temperature he removed Tony's diaper and placed him inside. He put some toys in the tub, hopefully so Tony could get distracted. Steve started first with his hair while Tony was hypnotized by a yellow duck that made noises when squeezed.
Tony just sniffle and cuddle in his uncles arms
-They are busy, Wade had promise Peter today was a “Daddy and baby day”- Steve said
The two brothers were silence for three minutes until Tony speak first.
Buckys start crying loudly squirming under his daddy's hold but Steve had a good grip on the boy.
While Steve was busy packing Tony and Bucky decide they were boring of watching TV now that their bottles were finished.
(See the end of the chapter for
So let’s say Steve wasn’t having the best day.
She was about to do so when she heard a click and then the door opening slowly, a tired looking Eddie emerging from it.
They arrive to the mall in no time. Steve getting everything he needed while the two babies were happy in their pushchair sucking on his pacifier looking around with amazing eyes. They didn’t went out a lot. Just for missions because Little’s need more protection some times.
Steve put Bucky on the table putting a bib on his little neck, he then went over to Tony picking him up and strapped him on his highchair.
Bucky went over his daddy's lap, before feeling his diaper being lowered exposing his little bottom.
-Loki- Bucky and Tony start screaming all over the floor on the way to their nursery
-Don’t worry friend Bruce everything will be fine-
-I’m sorry-
“Yes Daddy” Bucky said still a little tired putting his thumb in his mouth after his pacifier fell in his crib.
Steve quickly put Bucky on the couch and went to remove the block from Tony's mouth.
"We are gonna talk about that in a moment"
“Dad when is mom coming back” Loki ask Thor sulking in the couch
-Okay Daddy- Loki answer
The bath was a disaster, well. For the boys it was hilarious see how Steve got wet with every single toy. The thing about this toys was that they shot water so Steve of course was the target of his babies.
SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK!
"No!" said Bucky adamantly. Tony's eyes began to fill with tears as Steve immediately addressed Bucky.
“Oh wonderful I’m starving” Jane said placing the dinosaurs on the floor picking up Loki and going over Thor who kiss Loki’s head. The three made their way downstairs and sat on the table. They put Loki on a normal chair. He still wasn’t completely in his headspace. In front of him a sippy cup full of apple juice.
“Aunt Jane!” Both boys said happier
“Oh Phil I’m sorry he wanted to enter and I couldn’t said no” steve explain
Tony was the first to greet the boy
Both of them kiss Loki’s forehead and them leave the room leaving of course the door opened.
Thor and Loki were having a relaxing day. The two of them were watching movies. Well more like Thor was watching the movies while Loki play with the toys around him. In one moment Thor turn off the TV
He scrubbed soap all over his baby's body, leaving it clean and free of dirt.
Steve stopped for a minute to rub his baby's back.
“Oh baby that must hurt” Thor said a little sad for his baby
-buddy was sad, and I was trying to make him happy but I couldn’t. I’m sorry uncle Bruce- Bucky cry
-Yes- Loki and Toby said at the same time
Steve took Tony's nappy and with the wooden spoon began.
-Damn- Bruce curses
It took me moths but finally and update !
"Come with me, Loki. Let's play!" Bucky said, grabbing Loki's hand and leading him to his play room.
“Daddy want out, up! up!” Tony said standing up in the crib making hands into Steve direction.
That morning
-You aren’t- Bucky ask surprised
It was dark under his crib. That was where Tony was hiding from his Daddy. Why? It was bath time and, unlike Bucky, Tony was not a big fan of getting wet. That made bath time a nightmare for Steve. After searching the whole tower, a few laughs led him into the Bucky and Tony's nursery.
"Please calm down you two. Tony you are going to have ten minutes in the corner for biting Bucky. Bucky you will have five for throwing the tower down." Both children seemed ready to complain but the look of their Daddy was enough to leave them speechless. The two both dragged their feet on the way to the corners. After the time finished, Steve called both of his children and took them to the nursery. There he gave them their bottles and put them in their cribs. It had been a long night.
“Of course no Eddie you and Venom are so unique, I’m pretty sure Bucky wasn’t even thinking he was just scared” Anne tried
“Boys I said no” Steve said sternly
“Don’t be silly you know your undies are not itchy” Jane went over Loki’s closet and put out a pair of underwear and the rash cream
-Daddy I’m sowwy- Tony starts to cry making grabby hands for his Daddy too
He was wearing only a diaper because of his coming bath and a green pacifier in his mouth.
“Hi” Eddie whispers
Things were fine for the moment until  Tony turned to pick up a green block and heard the sound of blocks falling. Bucky had collapsed the tower with a single kick. He immediately began to cry, but made sure to show his brother how upset he was.
After that he pick up Bucky and put one of his fingers inside his diaper.
-I can see everything is fine now- Steve said entering the room. he had listened to the whole conversation.
"Stay still Bucky dont make me add more"
Bruce take a few pics for Steve to see later. And with the two babies asleep he proceed to call Thor.
One the bottle was empty and Loki burped by Thor he was put in his crib on his nursery with teddy beside him.
The little boy walked towards his Daddy and looking up to Eddie he said
"Hey baby boy someone is happy, I'm glad because we are are gonna talk about what happened yesterday"
-Okay Daddy thank you-
“Hi There Tony” Anne said
“Oh phil that look great” steve said taking out Tony and then Bucky.
"Aww baby, your little tummy does not feel good eh, do not worry daddy will make you feel better, but first let me clean you I bet that diaper does not feel very good"
A smile showed up in steve face. He missed his babies so much but he was sick and a little week to get out of bed. Thanks to the serum he would be able to recover soon but until that he had to rest.
“Oh come on baby today is gonna be a fun day we are going out wouldn’t you like that?” Steve ask, and I’m that moment a very hyper Bucky start jumping in the crib.
sometimes babies get sick of their little tummies, but daddy always knows  what's best for their babies
This water taste really good
-Daddy!!!- Bucky wailed hiding his face in his Daddy’s neck. Getting wet Steve’s shirt. Not that he care anyway.
"What happened to you today baby boy, those your little tummy still sick"
-I know I know, come on baby everything is fine your fine shhhh- Steve starts rocking Bucky patting his butt a little.
He put each boy on a corner in the livingroom.
“Oh believe me V they knew...I’m...We...I’m just a freak and you just an annoying parasite!”
“No im tired” Loki whine
Steve took Tony and Bucky to their nursery were he changed them in less than a minute. After cleaning all the boys toys and feed them some bottles the family sat happily on the sofa watching a movie while their guests arrive.
"Yes Daddy"
“Is a little late for that love” Steve said
And that is the story of how Steve have two overtired Little’s, full of sugar.
Once there they put out all of Loki’s toys. Jane could see he was starting to go into a much younger headspace now that she was here.
And just with those words both babies stop crying, and magically a smile appears on their faces. They could be like that some times but Steve love them the same and some times even more.
“Okay baby let’s see what the problem is”
Anne and Dan watching happily from the bedroom door. They both looked so cute. They definitely had the best boys.
"Daddy wook!" Said a happy Tony, squeezing his toy so it quack.
Sorry for the long wait I will try to update more so I hope you like
In one moment Loki start feeling a little itchy inside his nappy, so bringing the hand covered in cream he put the hand inside his nappy and start scratching down there, leaving some cream inside.
-Shh little ones, maybe you’re just tired-
-No baby please don’t cry is not your fault come on- Bruce lift Bucky with his other hand
"Okay looking at the wall, were are gonna start....now!" Steve set the alarm before going leaving the room for a moment. Both boys sniffling sadly.
"Tony bit me Daddy! Hurts!" Bucky cried, holding tight to his daddies chest.
"Buddy, I already told you no, it's raining and I don't want you to get sick." Steve said placing Bucky in his lap on the couch.
Jane then smile and start unbuttoned Loki’s pants then she pull down his boxers and Loki just look away.
Loki was fast on grab Jane hand
“Love you Daddy lots”
-Don’t worry dear fellow we will be there soon-
“Come on baby the soon you sit and pee the soon we would be out of here and you can continue playing”
"What?! No Tony we are so close come on"
When Bruce enter the living room he was meet with to sad babies. Tony already crying.
Tony just nodded, then leaned his head back on Steve's shoulder.
“Oh my babies both of you knew this was gonna happen”
"Breath baby, look same as Daddy" Steve start breathing calmly for Tony's sake, the little following his Daddy.
“Hi Im Eddie”
"Boys what happened yesterday was very naughty, you know I don't like that kind of behavior you know better and yes there's gonna be punishment"
“Who Old is Loki right now?”
Thy arrive to the tower only to find Clint and Phil eating lunch already.
Steve took Bucky to the changing table and opened the diaper, he could see a bit of a rash in Buckys penis, he grabbed some wipes and start cleaning the silent little.
Steve put him on the changing table before opening his diaper witch was heavily wet.
“Hi I’m Tony and this is my brother Bucky you wanna play with us”
-And I don’t want Bucky and Tony to be mad At each other, you are brothers you should love each other-
Steve was In the rocking chair a baby in each arm.
After that breakfast Steve took them both to give them a bath to quiet all that honey until their hair had lodged. As he began to undress the children Steve noticed that Tony had again dirtied his diaper. So after the bath Steve would put the two babies to watch a movie and give some medicine to Tony to calm his Little tummy.
“Eddie! Venom! Dinner is ready” Anne called she was thinking maybe it was time to literally forced the door open.
Once there Jane sit Loki on the toilet, he wee a little before Jane clean him up putting some rash cream all over his bits, bum and between his genitals. Then she put the blue with clouds undies.
“Baby I’m cooking Dinner”
-Is you brother still sleeping?- Steve ask referring to a sleepy Bucky In the sofa. Also only in his nappy.
“Mom stop!” Loki laugh
“And how’s my beautiful baby?” Jane ask bouncing Loki who just giggled sucking on his fingers “very little I see”
“Okay boys come on” Steve lay down between his two babies a give each of them a bottle. He then start stroking the boys head, singing for them to calm down. After the bottles were finish he burp them and let them sleep for a while.
Tony laugh.
“Venom no. he is a friend”
"Daddy, can I go play now?" Bucky asked, whining for the third time that day.
-We will have a play date with Tony and Bucky!- Thor said exited
"I'm glad to heard that I'm gonna bring some cream for your poor bottoms and then a nappy"
Steve return moments later with the cream and applied some on Tony's and Bucky's butt's, before putting them on diapers.
“STOP”
Steve opened the door letting Thor and to his surprise Jane, and behind her Loki.
We are not a monster
-Thanks for coming I have to go now here- Bruce he said passing Tony in Thor's arms
“It’s What mommies and Daddies do baby” Thor said
"In sorry daddy no spanking please" Tony wailed running towards Steve making grabbing hands to be lifted up
"NO! I'm a big boy, I don't use nappy." Loki cried, stomping his feet on the floor.
“Thanks, are you hungry” Phil asked
"Oh I know would you like a warm baba, will get you one after this change" Steve didn't wait for an answer, he applied some cream on Buckys willy before close a new diaper around his waist. He then pick him up and made their way to the kitchen.
-Hi Tony- a very happy Loki said entering to death for Bucky
Say yes!
It’s been two days since the incident. Bucky’s face was good as new but he kept saying it hurts so Steve could give him cuddles. Of course Steve knew Bucky’s face didn’t hurt at all.  But he was happy having a cuddle Bucky. That was very rare for him when he wasn’t felling that Little.
"Aw baby don't cry" steve pick up a half naked Bucky "in not mad I know you guys can be really curious at times, but you know better than to climb out of your crib and help Tony you know that"
“No! Daddy no yet!” Steve sigh “come on Buck is not gonna be for that long besides you two can still play with Anne’s and Dan’s little boy” Steve said trying to sound exited
“No daddy I’m tired” was the answer Steve got
“Nothing to be ashamed of  baby, pee please” Jane said gently.
“She told me she is on his way don’t worry” Thor smile at his brother for then continue preparing dinner. Some chicken nuggets for Loki and spaghetti for Jane and Thor.
At that, Bucky’s eyes met his with a smirk. “Caught me.” He leaned in for a deep kiss, then took the empty mug from Tony and handed it to the bot, who turned to leave the room, presumably heading back to the kitchen.
Holy shit.
“Parts are on the house. Consider it my thanks for your military service.”
Tony glares up at him. “Looking for a contact,” he replies sarcastically, “What do you think I’m doing? My bulky boyfriend rolled over and knocked me off the bed!”
Steve blinked. “Wait, what?”
Steve opens his mouth to agree, just to get out of the conversation, but instead what comes out is, “I’d rather not.”
There was a grim determination on his former lover’s face.
“He’s... just not the same guy,” Steve explained to Bucky, “And it’s my fault. I wish... I wish you could’ve met the sarcastic fella Tony used to be, full of piss and vinegar, you’d have gotten on like a house on fire.”
“Well, you don’t see something like that everyday,” Bucky said, and Steve was surprised to realize he’d sort of forgotten about his friend for a minute.
He tries to keep it light and gentle, cognizant that Tony’s still recovering, but Tony unsurprisingly pushes into it more passionately, before pulling back--but not releasing Steve.
“I’m not going to watch you get yourself killed.”
“Whatever, they’re mine now, and they love me.” Clint nuzzles an animal that appears to be a small purple six-legged rat, while holding another out toward Nat. “Want to hold one?”
“I just needed, like, two more days. One if you’d let me work overnight.”
“Hey, no, Steve,” Tony puts a hand on Steve’s chest, “Breathe.”
“I could have a heart attack and die,” Steve points at the sign listing all the “do not ride if...” conditions, several of which he’s had over the course of his twenty-one years.
“I know, I’m sorry. But I’m okay. Really.”
But they aren’t.
Everyone stares at him.
“...to the end of the line.” That’s... that means something.
“Better?” Tony asks. True to his word, he’d stayed with Bucky through the whole process.
Tony wouldn’t have known who the delicate lace angels had come from, if he hadn’t seen a patch of matching lace on the floor of Wanda’s room the day before before they appeared.
still interested? I basically threw up all over you!”
Tony’s gaze is steady, non-judgemental. “What about a friend?”
But it’s not long before the laughter gives way to sobs, and then it’s Captain America on his ass on the waxed floor of the Sanctum Sanctorum, crying his eyes out and unable to stop.
“What the hell?” Bucky seemed as taken aback by the... thing hanging from the line as Steve was.
He wasn’t sure why he felt himself compelled to accept the traveller’s offer of an enchanted mirror, nor why he didn’t even ask to see the item before the trade was finalized and the traveller left in their freshly repaired carriage.
“Come on, let’s get you up and dried off.” He guided Tony behind the counter to rinse his arm (thankfully not actually scalded) and then handed him a towel.
He didn’t, as tabloids liked to claim, worry that Tony was cheating on him when he was away, or getting drunk the whole time. No, Tony wouldn’t do that. The problem was that when Bucky was away, Tony would get a little wrapped up in projects in the workshop. “A little wrapped up” meaning he’d forget about anything else--like eating or sleeping. Bucky always asked whichever Avengers weren’t on the mission to check on him, but there was only so much they could do when Tony seemed determined to spend every possible moment in the workshop.
The man’s nervous smile gave way to something more pleased. “Thank you.”
“Captain, is something wrong?” Thor asks, stepping forward to place a worried hand on his shoulder.
Now, he waits, alone. He eats, he sleeps, he exercises, he sketches (page after page of Tony and Bucky, individually or together), but mostly, he stares out the window toward the empty area of space where the wormhole had been.
“My, my. I never would have guessed you of all people would be having a lazy morning. I even stopped by that sweat-soaked, testosterone-fueled, beefcake factory you call a gym, only to be told that you hadn’t been seen all morning.”
Steve was not picturing Tony sucking his cock in the middle of breakfast with the team. It was completely unhealthy to have an ice pop for breakfast. Tony was an adult. He should know better. Plus the slurping noises were distracting. Jan thought so too if the look on her face was anything to go by. And really, did it have to be the Captain America ice pops? Steve was not jealous of a goddamn ice pop.
Steve looked at him incredulously.
“Do you ever take this thing off? When was the last time you relaxed?”
Steve picked the plug up and wagged it in front of Tony’s face.
He shoved forward, entering Tony without warning and delighting in the high-pitched moan it earned him. There was no time to adjust as he pulled back out and rammed right back in, setting a fast and brutal pace that shook the desk with every thrust. Tony cried out around the plug, keeping time with the wet slap of balls against flesh.
Stark pat his thigh gently and pecked Steve’s cheek quickly before stalking off to the liquor cabinet. Steve went to bed feeling sated and content and not at all disappointed that he hadn’t quite gotten to make Tony fall apart in his arms.
Steve nodded his assent. The edge was fast approaching after so long spent teasing. Tony licked his lips and sped up his movements.
“Sorry, other me, but I can’t do that. Captain Handsome and I have a date with the Multiverse. See ya!”
It wasn’t often that Steve found himself struck speechless. He’d always looked at Tony and thought ‘maybe,’ But Tony had never said anything, and surely after so many years there would have been more to go on than his gut feeling and own useless fantasies. Steve ached as Tony’s expression closed off and he started to pull away. Steve didn’t want that though. Without thinking, he reached up to cup Tony’s face and-
“I can’t say the same. That AI was literally an exact copy of me. Really, I’m the one that has to apologize for all this. I’m the one with the capacity for evil given the right motivation. I mean, this isn’t even the first time.”
Steve kept his eyes firmly locked on Tony’s as he plowed into him. He’d lost count of how many times they’d done this. Tony always felt the same, just as hot and tight as the first time. Steve didn’t think he’d ever get tired of this. Beneath him, Tony gasped and clenched down. Steve kept moving and leaned down to lick into Tony’s mouth. He kept his eyes open until the last second as his orgasm crashed over him. He told himself that it still didn’t mean anything as they cleaned up and curled together on the bed.
Steve was still weighing his options as he worked the heavy bag when a SHIELD agent wandered into the gym. The gentleman went over to one of those funny machines that were basically moving sets of stairs, picking up the television remote as he went. Resigned to search for the game show channel another day, Steve went back to pounding the sandbag and focusing on more important things.
As the words left his mouth, Steve realized that the LMD could be a possibility. Rogers had been given unlimited access to all of SHIELD’s resources, including what Steve knew was a very impressive stockpile of robotic replacements. But would he have done that, used a gussied-up sex doll to taunt Steve? Steve looked into himself and thought about it without his general morals getting in the way. Was he desperate enough to sleep with a fake? Or rather was he petty enough to sleep with a fake Tony and record the whole thing for revenge? He didn’t think so, but he didn’t like the alternatives any better.
He should know what to do next. He’d done it hundreds of times before. Yet memory and instinct both failed him under Steve’s relentless onslaught. It made sense. Cap was a master strategist. A plan had probably formed in his head the moment he’d decided to stay the course with their interactions this evening. Tony finally decided to get with the program and began undoing his buttons.
Steve flushed deeper at the praise; felt his arousal spiral unexpectedly higher. He canted his hips for a new angle and listened to Tony keen. He was blinded by more pleasure that just kept him spiraling up and up and up. Climax hit him like a freight train when Tony whispered his name in completion.
Dinner was just finishing up. Gail was still just as good a cook as ever. Steve was so glad that she had finally stopped hiding from him. It was still bizarre for everyone at the table, but the faint air of awkwardness that had been pervading his visits seemed to finally be fading. He was trying to figure out if it would be proper to hug Gail goodbye when she spoke.
“Cap. It is okay. You felt good; it’s only natural your body would express that. It doesn’t have to mean anything more than that. If you don’t want any more, that’s fine. I can leave, but not while you’re this angry,” Tony said gently. The typical bravado and swagger he’d come to expect had all but disappeared. Steve wouldn’t have thought him capable of such gravitas. This abrupt seriousness threw Steve off balance and left him spiraling. He didn’t know how to react, and then suddenly his anger felt wrong, twisting and filling his insides. How could he be angry when Tony was being so calm and understanding? It was the opposite of everything he’d come to expect from Tony Stark. He grappled for an appropriate response in the face of Tony’s new docile approach. Tony looked up at him with big, blue eyes under dark lashes. Steve opened his mouth, but whatever words he’d been about to speak seemed to dissolve along with his anger. Tony placed a hand on his knee and Steve felt the fight go out of him.
Tony sped them through the compound down to the basement where he’d spent the last several weeks building a machine that would supposedly fabricate a better, stronger armor. Steve was beginning to have his doubts about that purpose as Tony tapped away at a computer terminal and a pulsing blue light spun into being in the center of the machine.
“Don’t be mad, I’m saving us.”
“Shall we get these off and wash ourselves up, Darling?” Steve lifted his hips and allowed Tony to pull his sopping underwear off. There was a bathroom with a shower attached to his sleeping quarters, but that would require putting his uniform back on over his sweat and cum-stained skin. He wondered what his chances were of making it there unseen with just the throw blanket from the couch wrapped around him. Tony reached over his head, momentarily distracting Steve with the sight of his chest and the musky smell of their sex. He leaned back and started mopping Steve up with some tissues from the end table. That solved one problem at least.
“What kind of reinforcements? You said an army? How? Where even are we?”
A few weeks later found Captain America standing next to a computer console with a newly un-comatose Ironman working to decrypt the mysterious flashdrive that had been sent to Steve by express mail with no return address. The flashdrive had been very heavily protected, and though Steve hated to bother Tony so soon after his recent trauma, he hadn’t been able to find anyone else that could crack it without risk to the data it contained.
“Okay. I guess for starters I should tell you that machine wasn’t for fabricating armor. I’m sorry I lied to you, but I wanted to give you a surprise present. You understand, don’t you?”
They Wanna Grip The Cross
Light flickered around the room, dancing as the color faded from Tony’s surroundings. He pulled the B.A.R.F. glasses off and threw them across the room in distaste. At some point he’d exchanged the glass for the bottle. It was empty in his white-knuckle grip. His pants were damp and sticky against his softening cock. Slowly, he stood and shuffled to his room. The images of the re-memory danced behind his eyes as he folded himself into bed. Like every other night this past month, he tried very hard not to think of the phone in his nightstand. In that, like everything else lately, he failed.
It had taken weeks to get this far. Ever since Tony had told Steve of his plans they’d had to move carefully and quietly to secure the last of the materials needed. Even the followers Tony had managed to gather for Steve had no idea what they were doing. Tony had insisted that not so much as a hint of what he was attempting get out, lest one of the many superhero groups currently running around the country catch wind of it.
No. Not like this. Tony deserved better. Besides, this new body didn’t have to mean that Tony would leave him. Everyone that had once stood at Steve’s side had either died or betrayed him. Perhaps he wouldn’t have to add Tony to that list.
Tony’s mouth. Holy hell, Tony’s mouth!
Tony brought his other gauntlet up to cradle Steve’s hand holding his wrist. The metal should have been cold to the touch. It wasn’t.
“You mean you didn’t know when you threw us through the portal???”
Steve hated himself, hated that he was even capable of entertaining the idea as an explanation.
Tony had more channels available than Steve had ever seen, including those ridiculous pay-per-view ones that made you cough up even more money for every show you watched. Steve decided to take full advantage of this and gleefully began scrolling from one channel to the next. He was determined to find something more exciting than a home-shopping channel.
It all made sense now; why Tony hadn't been able to look at him this past month. He'd been too busy simmering in guilt. Well, that was going to end now. Steve wanted to place his hands on Tony's shoulders and will him to believe that this was all Steve's fault. But that kind of contact would likely make Tony uncomfortable now. Instead, Steve settled for taking a step closer.
Tony cut off as the man on screen spoke again. Apparently, the show wasn’t over yet. With the gag out, Tony was much more vocal despite the much less frantic tone to their movements. Tony jumped into action as the other him started issuing amorous declarations that Rogers returned with vigor. Various windows popped up around the video feed, clearly trying to extract as much information from the file as possible.
They were pretty words. Tony had always had a flare for dramatics and romanticism. Steve was even tempted to believe him. Vision, after all, had proven that androids could be just as human as the rest of them. Thoughts of Pym-tron up in his new frozen home kept Steve grounded. This man was not Tony Stark, but he was no less dangerous.
The motion on his chest slowed and narrowed to a single fingertip tapping gently above his heart. It trailed down the center of his chest and stomach and came to a stop at the waistband of his briefs. It stayed there, not moving, and the tension built. Steve waited, silently hoping Tony would move that inch lower. His arousal was painful to ignore and he no longer cared where the end came from. He could care later. Tomorrow. Steve opened his eyes and looked up at Tony leaning over him.
“Why am I here?”
Still, that television on the wall was awfully inviting. He hadn’t really explored beyond “Jeopardy” after that awful venture into the five o’clock news programs.  Bucky had mentioned a whole channel that was devoted to game shows. Maybe if he could find that he’d have something new to watch. Surely there wouldn’t be anything else like that newscaster who had been spewing nonsense about “the homosexual agenda destroying America.”
“I’m guessing there’s something special about this watch if you want SHIELD to buy it. What is it? Water-resistant?”
Tony went still.
Tony carefully refilled Steve’s champagne. He held his own glass for the first time and gazed pensively at the bubbles rising to the surface. Steve watched his electronic eyes through the golden liquid and waited.
Tony’s finger slid down and (finally!) brushed over Steve’s erection. Steve arched his hips up in an attempt to chase the sensation, but Tony simply removed his hand. There was a quiet hiss as Tony unzipped his fly. Steve opened his eyes and watched him shuck his pants and shirt. Tony climbed back up the couch to straddle him again. This time Steve didn’t shove him away when their erections met.
“So in that case, you should focus on touching me. You can touch yourself too. Get readjusted to the way it feels.”
They parted and stared at each other, assessing. Tony waited to see what would happen next, though he already knew. The course of this evening had been decided the moment their lips touched. Tony kept his eyes steady and willed Steve to move first.
“Do you like this? I can’t touch you without the suit, but I can show you anything you want.”
Tony instructed him to remove his shirt but to Steve’s disappointment made no mention of his pants. He guided Steve to rub up and down his stomach and sides before finally trailing back down to his thighs.
“I’m not him.”
Steve expected relief, but instead Tony’s face dropped into a picture of barely contained misery.
“Lock the door.”
Tony took several heaving breathes and looked back up at Steve with a wide grin.
“Couldn’t be…locked him down…but would he? Would I?”
“Cap…Steve…Yes. Eyes. Eyes on me, Captain. I’m going to make you feel so good.”
Steve pushed Tony's pants down over his hips and cupped his erection through his briefs. Tony was so sensitive right now it probably wouldn’t take much at all to leave him a sated puddle on the floor at his feet. They’d have to go slow if Steve wanted more than awkward fumbling in the shower. Speaking of which…
“Wha- Why’d you stop?”
“How would you touch me if you could?”
It took a moment for Steve to register that he’d been asked a question, and once he did, it just served to confuse him more. Thankfully, Bucky took the silence as a cue to fill him in.
Tony’s smile was warm and inviting, the way it had always been. This wasn’t Tony, but that smile did things to Steve’s stomach nonetheless, and Steve blamed his other self. Damn that man and his weakness for Stark. Steve hadn’t been able to quite dismiss it, the longing and hunger that were instinctual reactions at this point. His gaze was drawn to Tony’s shimmering lips as he spoke.
Steve nudged Tony’s brow with his lips and twined their legs together under the sheets. He thought of the shining red and gold armor at his back in battle. Stifling a yawn, Steve grinned into the space between them.
“The latest fitness tech out of R&D. I was hoping you would test it out for me, put it through its paces, before I talk to Fury about issuing them to the wider SHIELD agent population. Eventually, we think there may even be a market for them among civilian consumers, though that will be a few years down the road once we work out the bugs and figure out what features people actually care about.”
“Sorry about that. I didn’t mean to turn the volume up so high. I just wanted to unmute it to hear what they were saying. This shit is too dramatic for captions.”
Tony nodded. Steve guided Tony’s hand down to wrap around his cock and sighed at the way Tony immediately tightened his grip to squeeze him more firmly.
The thumb paused, twitched against his skin, and began rubbing again.
Steve looked down and ran a hand through his hair. It was the most truth that he could offer right now, though it may not be enough to satisfy Tony. There was a pit, deep and throbbing in his stomach and he refused to think about why he so desperately wanted to offer Tony more than this. It would be better to give him more reassurance, to make sure he wouldn’t leave. Steve told himself that was it anyway.
It probably would have been best for Tony to rest in one place for a while, but there was no time for that. The power siphoned off to get this done would have more than a few eyebrows raised and it wouldn’t be long before someone was sent to investigate. Working quickly, he methodically dressed Tony into the armor his incorporeal form had been using to interact with the world. It would have been preferable to have him walk out of the facility as they had come in, but that didn’t appear to be an option at the moment.
Steve watched Tony’s back until he turned the corner. Slowly, he pointed the remote up and snapped the tv off. He stared at the black screen for a long minute trying desperately not to think about what Tony was most likely doing up in his room right now. He took a deep, steadying breath and glared at his own erection. Not tonight. He forced himself to rinse out his glass of milk and return to his own room. He stripped and settled into bed, with full intention to sleep. Instead, his eyes turned to the remote for the smaller TV nestled on the wall, and his mind automatically supplied the numbers for the channel he’d had on downstairs. He shouldn’t.
“Steve. Calm down. It’s okay.”
The others were talking about the scandal, and Steve knew he should be paying attention, but the film just kept drawing his eyes back. He’d known Natasha was beautiful. Evidently, she was pretty good in bed too. It was little wonder why Tony had fallen so hard for her.
“I’m glad. We can do that as often as you want, although I have an even better proposal for you.”
Steve wasn’t avoiding Tony. He was a busy man. Tony was a busy man. They couldn’t be expected to keep in constant contact. It wasn’t through any deliberate action that their only interaction was during official Ulitmates business in the next few weeks.
“Harder…faster…Yes, so good, so perfect.”
It was the kind of frenzied fucking that wouldn’t be able to last long. All too soon Steve was moaning as he stilled and came inside Tony. Tony remained still even as Steve pulled out and admired the way his seed dribbled out and down Tony’s thighs. It was a lovely sight. He hoped the camera was getting a good shot.
Steve looked up from the surveillance photos he’d been studying and over at Tony. His holographic projection had moved closer in a blink and was only inches from him now, staring intently.
“So, what do you say, Mr. President?”
- wanted Tony and had resigned himself to the fact that he would never have him.
It was Thursday night and Steve was terribly bored. “Wheel of Fortune” had just ended. The last puzzle of the night had ended up being some new slang term that had really thrown Steve for a loop. What the hell was a “mosh pit”? Melancholy from his failure to understand 21st century terms, Steve wondered if he’d ever be able to catch up to the new culture of America.
Steve broke out in a cold sweat, still unsure what was about to happen. When had this video been recorded? If Tony was there, then before his coma, but Steve hadn’t seen anything like this in the glimpses he’d gotten of this lunatic’s life. Steve continued to think he was about to witness Tony be beaten, right up until he started removing his clothes. Even then, comprehension stubbornly evaded him until Tony got on his knees and started sucking his double’s cock.
He shivered with sudden cold as it sunk in that he’d just had sex with Tony Stark in the pseudo Oval Office. Tony broke away and slipped his fingers under the elastic band of Steve’s now ruined briefs, drawing Steve’s attention back to the sticky mess in his lap.
He copied Tony’s circling motions, brushing over his nipples again and again as they stiffened. They weren’t the only thing getting harder either. Steve spread his legs to either side of the chair, alleviating some of the pressure from his tight pants. He wanted to reach down and unzip, to pull out his cock and jerk himself off nice and hard, but Tony seemed to be ignoring that part of his body for now.
Tony frowned and Steve could see his metaphorical hackles rising. A distant part of him recognized that arguing like this would be counterproductive, that it wouldn’t get them any closer to the truth. Tony probably needed some space after what they had just witnessed. And the thought that Tony wouldn’t want to talk to Steve, that he might even be repulsed by him, was a knife to his chest. Steve dug in his heels.
“Stop right there!”
The bed creaked as Tony made a fresh attempt at leaving. Steve knew it wouldn’t be that easy, but he hadn’t actually come up with a plan to convince Tony to stay. Good thing he was great at strategizing on the fly then.
Steve startled awake with a shot of adrenaline that had him reaching for his shield before he was even fully aware he was no longer dreaming. He scanned the room as his harsh panting filled the space. Finding a lack of a threat, he finally allowed himself to flop back down on his brand new too big, too soft bed. He tried to think back and remember, but whatever nightmare had been plaguing him tonight was gone, disappeared into the silver beams of moonlight that slipped through his curtains.
“Dear Captain,…It’s so strange to write a letter to yourself…Probably wondering…Escape…The true Hydra will never die…no intention of…won’t let you win…already started…This isn’t over…Love, Steve”
Steve’s grip was impossible to tight. He held Tony firmly in place on his cock. Tony worked the base with his free hand and moaned. Steve’s cock jerked in his mouth as the first load of jizz shot down Tony’s throat. Steve pulled back, causing the rest of his orgasm to splatter hot and sticky on Tony’s face, dribbling down through his beard. Tony continued choking on spit and cum as his own orgasm slammed into him. He panted and caught his breath before glancing back up at Steve and-
Tony made a distressed sound and sprung to the other side of the room, muttering angrily.
They lay there quietly, the air filled with gasps for breath. The silence was broken by Tony giggling. Steve leaned up to look down at him.
He leaned over into Steve’s space, looking up at him with big, blue eyes.
The words were hardly out of his mouth before he realized just how they sounded. He had a moment to ponder a clarification but then Tony was giving him a look that absolutely smoldered and suddenly it didn’t matter.
“So, what’s in the box?”
“Wait. What?”
“Do you love me?”
“Every night at 7, there’s this game show on that we like to watch. It’s called ‘Jeopardy’. It’s a sort of trivia show. Me and Gail keep score to see which of us can answer the most questions right. And then after is ‘Wheel of Fortune.’ That one’s a word puzzle game. They’re a good way to keep our minds sharp.”
“Do you really think I’m settling here?”
“Do it properly. You have to get my dick nice and slick.”
“I wish I could touch you.”
Tony gave Steve a long glace up and down to drive the point home. Steve looked appropriately disjointed by this revelation for all of a moment before he schooled his expression back to neutral. Tony relished the shock.
“Tony?”
Steve’s eyes were drawn back to the computer as their counterparts whispered soft, loving words and kissed slowly. The sight of himself tangled together and lip-locked with Tony was mesmerizing. Could he and Tony have had that? He knew it was too late now and hated Rogers just a little bit more.
“It’s okay Shellhead. It was only a dream. You’re here. You’re safe.”
As it turned out, “Jeopardy” was very entertaining. Steve had experienced some difficulty with the contemporary literature category, but he’d nailed just about all of the Renaissance art questions. To top it all off, he’d actually learned quite a bit to boot. Perhaps “Jeopardy” could be employed as a means to catch up. The SHIELD files wouldn’t have everything he’d missed. Besides, Bucky said that while some of the questions were obscure, a good bit of them were common knowledge and any average, well-rounded adult would be able to answer at least a handful every show. SHIELD had been encouraging Steve to begin adapting to newer technology, so maybe watching trivia shows on television would be a good place to start.
“How do you like it, Steve? Fast and rough? Slow and soft? Do you like a light touch, or do you need a firm grip? I want to learn all the best ways to please you.”
“It wasn’t supposed to be like this you know. The Accords. The Team. It- We were supposed to be better. I was supposed to be better. Back Before, when we were still hunting down Hydra bases, I could see it all so clearly. What we were becoming. A real team. A family, almost. And then the scepter happened and the vision and I realized I’d been wrong all along. We weren’t heading towards greatness. We were heading towards destruction. Something had to be done. I could save us, I knew I could. But then Ultron happened and Sokovia happened. And it was all my fault, yet no one held me accountable. Aside from a dip in the stocks, there weren’t any outside repercussions. Why? Because I’m Iron Man. Because I’m an Avenger. SHIELD is gone so now we’re the big kids on the block. No one can come in and stop us from doing what we want because we’re the ones you call to handle people like us."
Steve leaned down to tell Tony he was leaving only to receive a kiss on his open mouth. He spent several minutes distracted by Tony’s tongue. Finally, Tony released his mouth and settled down half on top of Steve. Steve continued to lay there as Tony’s breathing evened out. He slipped out of the room about an hour later. Staying the night would have made this something.
Slowly, Tony reached back out to the keyboard. A capital “H” blinked to life, followed by an “A.” Dread filled Steve and he wanted to ask Tony to stop typing. It had been a mistake to demand it. Tony pressed steadily on through the final “A.”
So this was going to be show and tell. Steve wasn’t much of a talker, but he had a feeling Tony was an expert.
Sleepy compliance had Steve moving before he could think about it. He could have more of this; it wasn’t over yet. He moved eagerly, so smooth Tony didn’t even have to get up. He didn’t notice the hardness he was sporting between his legs until Tony settled back down against him, bringing their erections together. Steve choked on the panic rising like bile in his throat while Tony released a moan.
“Why?”
The loud, creaking protest of the chair brought Steve back to the present. The back of Tony’s chair was probably beyond help and a stab of guilt struck Steve at breaking Tony’s innocent furniture.
Steve’s mouth went dry and he choked on his breath. He’d mostly gotten used to Tony’s endless flirting, had even managed to come up with a few witty remarks to fire back. But that’s all it ever was. Tony had never done this before, and Steve hadn’t let himself think about what might happen if Tony was ever serious. There was a hunger in Tony’s eyes that Steve had only ever caught glimpses of in the past. Tony had never directed it his way with such intensity and Steve realized that this was a legitimate offer that Tony was handing him. The look sent a brief spike of lust shooting through him which soured just as quickly.
Steve frowned and opened his mouth to respond, but paused, his gaze shifting focus to his hand still laid on top of Tony’s head. He swept his hand through Tony’s hair and tightened his grip. He pulled back tentatively, still nervous about exerting too much force. He looked back at Tony’s face. Tony flashed a grin full of teeth.
Steve punctuated this point with a sharp pinch to the nipple he’d aroused. He released the bud between his fingers and went about gently caressing Tony’s sides, warming his skin and soothing the goosebumps that had arisen there despite the heat from the shower.
“We’ll stop them. Steve, I promise, we’ll find a way.”
This time Tony surprised him by remaining on the floor. He took Steve’s hand gently in his. For a moment, Steve thought Tony might kiss him there, but he simply stared for a long moment before drizzling more oil on his arm. It tangled his arm hair as Tony rubbed up and down. He moved slow, going over front and back, up to his shoulder and down to his fingertips. Like he had with his toes, Tony pulled at each of his fingers, popping the joints.
After a couple of minutes Steve returned to his room with Bucky still in his arms and sat down in the bed. He put Bucky between his legs and approach the tit of the bottle to the baby's face who happily take it and start sucking fast.
with you."
"Okay let's get you clean and then we can go and wake Tony up"
"Daddy says I'm a big boy too. It's just that sometimes I need more help just like Tony." Bucky said.
“Good! Now let’s eat I’m gonna call Anne and Dan after this”
-No Tony that’s mine yours is the red one-
Back in the room Steve gave both boys the sippy cup and then settled into the middle of their two babies, each of them placed his head on each of Steve's legs.
Once Thor arrive he was relive Loki was on his headspace, he missed his baby boy. The three of them made his way over Thor and Jane room with Loki on jane’s arms.
“Mom!”
"Yes daddy we are"
"Okay, try to calm down, Baby. Everything is fine. I apologize for this, Steve." Thor said while rubbing the top of Loki's dark hair.
Steve put Tony in the changing table, changing his nappy that was just wet and then putting clothes on the boy. Both boys have the same shoes and pants but the t-shirts were different. Bucky’s was blue and Tony’s was green.
Later in the morning Steve was in the kitchen preparing waffles for his Little Boys, when he felt a hand pulling his shirt. It was Bucky.
-nine...ten!- Bucky yell, he start to look around when he heard some cuddles coming from the bathroom
Steve went over Bucky to wake him up.
-Sorry little one anything but that, your Daddy is sick and is better if we let him rest-
“It seems that we have three little shy boys” Dan laugh while Anne put Eddie in front of her
-That must be Thor and Loki- Bruce said going towards the door and opening it
Anything you wanna see ?? I accept everything ;)
"Bucky Daddy is gonna get mad at us we should go back"
In that moment venom decide to materialize in front of Eddie, kissing softly his cheek whispering
-Clint is big today and is with Phil doing some work for Shield-
-Yes please-
“Okay then let’s get you ready”
Steve went with Bucky still on his arms to were tony was focused on the TV
-theres something in that crib-
“Baby are you okay, take that hand out please” Thor said picking up Loki and putting the hand out.
-what about Thor?- Bruce ask
“What do you say baby sounds fun isn’t!” Dan ask grabbing Eddie’s little hand, they both walked were Tony and Bucky were. “Have fun Eddie mommy and I would be right there” Dan says pointing towards the table in the kitchen “call us if you need anything same goes for Venom” he said whispering the last part on Eddies ear.
Tony and Bucky looked at each other in fear.
“Okay buck the time is up come here please”
A whole week was needed for the two babies too be fine again. And steve couldn’t be more happy two have back his two happy and lovely babies.
“Is okay baby I’m not mad, love you” Steve put a kiss on his son forehead. After some cream and another nappy the three of them were ready to say hi to Thor, Jane and Loki.
Even Steve in the shower.
“But Daddy whyyyy!” Bucky said getting sad
“Come here baby lets go to the potty really quick and then we will play” Jane extended her hand for Loki to take and both went to the bathroom
“The monster did it” Bucky cry in his daddy’s neck
Thanks for reading lol!
-don’t worry I wold take care of them- Steve did trying to stand up
"Daddy, wait I'll take a bath!" Tony cried frantically, fists rubbing at his eyes.
-we’ll actually last week Tony and Bucky got sick and consequently Steve got sick to. The babies are fine but Steve need a lot of rest and u can’t watch them thus afternoon and I was wondering if you could come and have like a play date with Tony Bucky and Loki- Bruce said
Immediately the room went silenced, Tony sat down on his crib sucking his dummy and playing with his stuffies.
Eddie look up to venom seeing nothing in his eyes. Not a single expression. He saw how his friends make his way inside him again without saying a word. Eddie knows he did wrong, he really does but he is so mad at everyone it’s simply not fair.
“Well I’m sorry but you won’t see your kids  again until we’re are gone” Thor laugh
Thanks for reading !
"Oh baby, do not worry daddy's gonna get you out of that nasty diaper"
-Now you can continue playing-
“It was a monster a black scary monster” Bucky cry at the top of his lungs
“Okay then Clint do you want to help me clean the babies?” Steve ask to a boring Clint
Steve went to the changing table and set Bucky down, he made a quick job changing the nappy, cleaning Bucky’s penis and bum then putting some rash cream and finally tapping the a new nappy in the baby. He went to the dresser and took a some jeans and a t-shirt’s for Tony and Bucky. Once Bucky was full dressed he let the little play around the nursery with some toys while he goes to take care of Tony.
"Sowwy Tony." Bucky apologized and continued his fun together with his brother. Steve contentedly headed to the kitchen to prepare two bottles for his babies.
Both Anne and Dan gasped
“Hi” Tony said hi to Dan and Anne with a shyly smile
-Loki do you have something you wanna tell to Tony and Bucky-
“Loki” but before a tantrum could start they heard the front door being opened. Loki of course was the first to run at the door screaming.
Steve still half asleep, he got up and quickly went to the nursery.
-thank you so much Thor-
Steve then got and idea, he put the two babies in the big crib he uses when tony wanted to sleep with Bucky and vice versa. The two babies start crying stronger with big fat tears going down their cheeks.
"Not yet, you still have another hour left to play. I just came to see if Loki needed to use the potty."
Daddy Thor Mommy Jane and Baby Loki
(See the end of the chapter for
“They are taking a nap, they are a little cranky so I hope now that they are napping they moods would change” Steve said he then look over Loki who was looking a video in Jane’s phone. He seemed to be in an older headspace but he would ask later.
-looking forward to see you, They hope you feel better soon so they can give you cuddles- Bruce said
"Daddy are we gonna get spankings?"
-What's up- Steve answer calm
SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK!
-Stupid-
The three adults (and Eddie) make his way over the living room were Bucky was waiting for them. but in the moment he saw the couple he was fast to hide behind his daddy’s legs.
"Love you too, baby boy." Thor replied with a smile.
“I’m bored!” Loki said going over the kitchen and sitting all muddy in one of the chairs looking at Thor
“ Okay Okay if you stop crying I will buy you some candys” Steve said defeated
Out of nowhere the baby monitor came to life causing bucky to shudder in Steve's arms for silence.
-I love Bucky Daddy, I think Bucky don’t love tony- Tony said disappointed
-Hello- Thor ask
(See the end of the chapter for
“Okay boys, let’s finish  this lazy day with a relax bath”
The little went over his mom and dad’s room and opening the door he went straight to the bed they have in the room from when Loki wanted to sleep with them but he didn’t saw his teddy. Loki then start looking all over the room after a moment he went to the bathroom and for his surprise his teddy was right there on the on the bathroom floor.
OMG did I actually update wow that's like a big deal to me
-I’m your brother Tony I always gonna be your friend...Are you my friend?- Bucky ask
Bucky who was the one being chased didn’t saw the door in front of him and a big knock of Bucky’s face hitting the door was heard.
-Daddy more juice please- Loki ask going to the kitchen
“Hi there baby” Steve said looking at Bucky enter to the room, the pick up the baby and kiss his cheek
Loki and Bucky happily continued playing. Quickly the pressure on Loki's bladder got worse and he wanted to call for his daddy. But as he stood to go he felt like his pants were dampening without his control. Loki felt his eyes fill up with tears. Months had passed since his last accident, and now he was uncomfortable in his wet pants
"You know I'm doing this for your own good, you know that what you did was naughty and as a Daddy I have to punish you to teach you what wrong and right"
“CLINTTT!” Both babies said happily to see their cousin there
Goodnight Eddie I love you too.
-Ready to go baby ?- Thor ask entering Loki’s room
“I don’t think so baby I know how you and Bucky get when you have candy”
“You’re welcome.” Steve places a soft kiss on his neck, then lets him get back to work.
“See this connection here?” Tony pointed them out. “The pressure sensors aren’t calibrated correctly. If I just...”
“Can I--” Steve starts, desperately wanting, but realizing how important his phrasing is right now. “Do you want me to hold you?”
Steve stares at him for a moment, then laughs as he understands. The spell is no longer affecting Tony. Steve responds in turn, “My shield tastes like strawberries.”
He doesn’t know what he’s going to say, or how crazy Tony will think he is, but...
“Well, if it helps, I’m pretty sure my answer will be ‘Yes.’”
As he’s grunting through the pain of punishment, Maria repeats over and over, “I’m sorry. Thank you for trying. I’m sorry.”
Steve sobs, letting himself fall to his knees in front of Bucky, stopping himself from wrapping his arms around him only at the last second as he remembers Tony’s warning--which wasn’t about the ‘stranger’, and wasn’t about Steve’s reaction to seeing
“It’s just a broken leg. They shouldn’t have even bothered with the cast, I’ll be healed by tomorrow.”
“I’ll do my best.” Tony’s words are light, but his eyes are serious. Then he smiles and pulls Steve in for another kiss.
“Shit, and I’d been worried about mine...”
All seems hopeless when Bucky is recaptured by Hydra.
The ridiculousness of that, of Captain America falling on his ass (“America’s ass”, thanks, Scott) due to something as mundane as waxed floors, suddenly has him laughing.
“Need more pillows?” Tony asked.
“Whoa!” Peter shouted, pulling the mask off and staring at Dad. “Who was that?”
The soft-spoken man’s fists tightened, and his voice cracked. “I can’t, Tony. I just... Don’t make me do that. Ask Dr. Cho; she won’t ask questions, and she’s not...”
“Hey, rich boy, school lunch not good enough for you? Bet this is some real fancy food, huh?”
Now Bucky gave an indignant huff, clearly trying to glare but only looking cuter.
Tony barks out a mirthless laugh, then starts to cough as his parched throat can’t handle it. When he recovers, he knows he shouldn’t waste energy or moisture talking to a hallucination, but he does it anyway. “Not seeing a lot of hope. Not seeing anything but sand and a dead man. For all I know I’m heading further from any chance of survival.”
“Sure thing, kiddo,” Steve promised, returning the hug, then allowing Peter to lead him to the fort.
Steve is relieved that when he and Bruce enter the common room to find the others around the television playing Mario Kart, they barely acknowledge him, focused on their game. He decides that means it’ll be safe enough for him to sit in the corner and sketch, the noise combined with the activity keeping his mind busy enough not to really think.
“Oh, is that what this is, I’m just a glorified taxi service?”
“Yeah.”
Steve suddenly imagined the horror he’d feel if he ever saw the light not glowing, and was glad for Tony’s warning. He’d probably still panic a little if it happened, but knowing there were other possibilities would help until he knew for sure what had happened.
The alien shapeshifter who had impersonated a supersoldier.
asked
, Rogers!” she shouted after brushing the snow away.
The ice cream was quickly melting from Tony’s now reddening cheeks, but he nodded. Slowly, so Tony could pull away or stop him if he was freaked out, Bucky leaned in and, this time, licked at the purple streaks that still remained.
“My son...” she says, then turns pleading eyes to his, “You have to help him!”
“Call me Tony.” The dragon--Tony--looked down at Steve’s sword. “But if you’re going to fight beside me, I think you’ll need something better than that old thing. Let me forge you a new one, or at least improve that one.”
Bucky caught it.
“I...” Steve realized, feeling foolish. Of course Rhodey would be more upset about his best friend than his own paralysis. “I’m sorry for hurting Tony, too. I should have told him about his parents as soon as I found out.”
Tony refuses to let his eyes shut for longer than a blink, fighting the fatigue trying to take over. Sure, JARVIS could pilot the suit if he falls asleep, and he would continue the scans, but what if Tony’s eye catches something that the sensors don’t detect as anomalous?
“No.” The answer slips out, surprising Steve as much as the others present.
So this is super late, due to a combination of being busy and having an uncooperative muse. Sorry about that, I really do hope to keep going until I reach the end of the prompts!
“I am,” Bucky acknowledged, “But we’ve gotta get you trained if we’re gonna beat Clint’s weird circus friends in the game next week. So next time, maybe try to hit the ball?”
,” Clint moaned as the paintballs exploded in the center of his chest.
The crew of the other ship looked torn between defending their captain, and avoiding the fire of the pirates carefully watching their every move, rifles aimed and steady.
Unfortunately, raw power still worked, and they had the numbers to eventually wear him down. As he started to tire, becoming slower to block attacks and take down one minion after another, he felt a sharp pain on the side of his head, and then the world went black.
The man’s cheeks pinked and he looked away. “Not exactly... but the sorcerer might have said something about only being released if someone found me, uh... attractive.” He cleared his throat. “So you can see why I thought it would never happen. Of course, no one else ever kissed me in all the time I was in there, so maybe it was just that someone had to be willing to do it at all...”
“Because I interrupted you before you could?”
“You...” Tony clenched his fists, taking a slow, deep breath, then let it out. “I need to go,” he said, then turned and walked away.
Tony looked confused, then his eyes narrowed. “...for what?”
Maybe this school wouldn’t be so bad after all...
“Oh, it is
“Kiss me,” Tony says, and Steve does.
Tony slid the ring onto Bucky’s finger, bringing the metal hand up to his lips to kiss. Then he laughed, and Bucky gave him a curious look. “Tastes like plums,” he explained with a grin.
Clearly still bewildered by Tony, Bucky looked down at the tools and began to take the radio apart.
A strange hydraulics sound was his only warning before he was hit with a stream of liquid... and a horrendous stench.
,” Clint moaned, and Tony couldn’t help but grin, grateful the armor’s filtration systems weren’t allowing the apparently pungent smell through.
The paramedic seemed momentarily frozen by Tony’s probably intense stare, then asked. “Excuse me, who are you, Sir?”
“Leave him alone.”
“Imadesomethingforyou,” Tony said in a rush, “And now I’m realizing now that I probably should’ve talked to you instead of just building a solution that might
Tony’s eyes went first to the Zenith radio the man was cradling in his right arm, then to the empty sleeve on his left, then to the man’s face. His features were striking, long dark hair, bright blue-grey eyes, and a mouth that made Tony want to do all sorts of illegal things. His expression was wary, though, and Tony realized he might be waiting for some kind of negative reaction regarding his missing left arm.
Tony grinned and dropped to his knees. He started rubbing under the husky’s chin with both hands, and was pleased to see Bucky’s eyes start to close, obviously enjoying it. Then Tony found a spot that made Bucky’s back left leg start thumping, and he laughed. He kept scratching the dog’s chin with one hand, using the other to stroke the soft fur on Bucky’s shoulders and back. After a moment Bucky flopped over on his side, tail flapping wildly in pleasure as Tony started rubbing his belly.
Tony gave him an offended pout when he shouted, and Steve sighed. “I’m fine. Really.”
the man he loved?
“Steve. About what you said earlier.”
The Skrull was slumped forward, elbows on its knees and head hanging down.  Then, apparently noticing Tony’s approach, the alien stood up.  Despite the inhuman green skin and oddly wrinkled chin, Tony could read the expressions that flashed over its face--a moment of joy, before it fell back into misery.
“Take all the time you need,” Bucky reassured him. “After all, we have forever an’ ever.”
There are some questions that don’t get an answer at all, but most do, and the game helps them all get to know each other, to feel a little more comfortable living together.
Tony’s swings improved rapidly after that.
Next, a few well-crafted nutcracker ornaments appeared, which Tony suspected came from Natasha.
“Morguna, are you giving away daddy’s secrets?”
“Please... I can’t...”
It takes Steve a moment to realize his soulmate is gesturing at him. “Oh. Steve.”
Tony smiled, but there was still worry in his eyes. “I don’t like the idea of you blacking out at all, since it could happen at a dangerous time, or you could go hours without food or water.”
“An’ I didn’t want to get between you, but Steve said you wanted...” Bucky stepped forward and put a hand on Tony’s arm, meeting his eyes intently. “Tony, do you want to date me?”
Tony shakes his head, opening glazed eyes in question.
Steve swallowed. “At first, I thought it wouldn’t matter to you--but then... you were so angry.”
Minor content warnings at end of chapter.
“Why?”
“Nope,” Steve answers simply, “You all helped, but Tony took a truth spell for me. That warrants some special treatment, I think.”
“Of course! This is the storelskas’ natural coloring.” Thor reaches out to scratch under the chin of the rodent Clint is holding out, and it makes a contented chirping sound.
“It does if you’re gonna keep pickin’ on someone who doesn’t deserve it.”
He turned to his colleagues, quickly explained the situation, and then headed into the burning building with greater urgency than he’d ever had on this job.
“I don’t think so, but even if it is, it’ll be fine by tomorrow,” Bucky points out. Super healing sure is handy.
“I can if you want me to. But I’m just here to talk.”
“It’s really not--” Tony takes a look at Steve’s face and gives in, “Fine.”
For a brief moment Tony had hope the scrawny kid had a big, beefy friend to help out. The brunet behind him was definitely bigger, decently built... but apparently had only one arm. His left sleeve was pinned up to his shoulder, while his right arm was up in a fist, as ready for the horribly unbalanced fight as his blond friend was.
The sleeve of Tony’s white dress shirt is definitely ruined, a several-inch line of bright red surrounding the slice. Tony uncuffs the shirt to pull the sleeve up, and Steve is relieved to see the cut really doesn’t appear to be too deep.
, but words just didn’t come.
“No!” Bucky interrupts, a jolt going through him at the thought. “No, thank you, JARVIS,” he says, and moves to dump his cereal and find a softer breakfast.
Tony’s gaze was--no longer angry, not exactly, but intent. “What do you think it is?”
Bucky turned the volume down, perhaps not wanting to silence completely the evidence of his hard work just yet. “Thank you. For the parts and everything. Don’t suppose you’d pay more for a working radio?”
As long as he was there anyway, Tony had the HAZMAT teams spray down the suit, so at least he wouldn’t have to do that back at the tower and smell it when he took it off.
“There is a... situation in your workshop.”
“Yeah, but isn’t it more important for us to help Tony clean up?” Bucky grinned and reached out, using one finger to wipe away some of the purple ice cream from Tony’s face.
That wasn’t good. Tony tried to stand to comfort them, but the world started spinning even more, and his stomach jolted. Then he was being gently lowered to lie back down. A soft voice in his ear said, “Hey, no, you stay here, okay? Help’s on its way.”
The door opened a crack. Only a sliver of a face and one blue eye were visible, but Tony had seen enough pictures and newsreels to know this was the man he was looking for.
“You’re brilliant, you’re funny, and you hide how much you care, but you’re willing to put it all on the line as much as or more than the rest of us. You’ve given us... me... a home. You’re more than good enough, Tony, whatever shit your father might have told you. You’re incredible.”
“Come on, Stevie, what’s the worst that could happen?” Bucky says as he drags Steve into the line of people waiting to ride the Cyclone.
“Who?”
The attendant looked a little flummoxed, and Bucky figured he hasn’t seen someone get all the cans in one throw before. “No, uh, you’d have to pay again to try again,” he stammered, grabbing the hook to pull down the requested prize.
“People,” Tony shrugs. “Rhodey. Then Pepper.”
“Bucky. Come on, sweetheart, come on back to me.
“You have
“Sorry, Tony, I’ve got to head back. The ‘jet and I are almost on empty.” Clint’s voice through the coms is regretful but exhausted.
Bucky abruptly pulled back from Tony, leaned out from behind their shelter, aimed into the branches of the tree from which the voice had come, and fired twice.
“Goddammit, we’re not expecting him to leave you. But Tony at least deserves an apology for the way he left.”
Except Bucky wasn’t really choking, he was clearly breathing through the coughs, and eventually his breathing leveled out. He looked down at his metal hand, where he’d apparently caught the bit of plum he’d nearly choked on. Then he looked at Tony, then at the basket, then down at his hand again, and then back at Tony. “I’ll be right back,” he said firmly. “Don’t move.”
“So we’ll do our best to keep you safe while you do it,” Tony added. “One way or another, we’ll be there to catch you when you fall.”
“Tony?” the man himself had appeared in the living room. His eyes traveled down Tony’s form, his bespoke suit crisp and dry after the cleaners had worked their magic. If the genius wasn’t mistaken, there was some appreciation in Steve’s gaze. “Nice to see you warm and dry.”
The flickering candlelight and vase of marigolds set a simple but beautiful scene, and the air was filled with the aroma of Tony’s delicious Italian cooking.
“What. The hell?” Bucky repeated, staring at the thing.
Tony’s upper body isn’t bulky, but there are defined muscles, especially in his arms. In the center of his chest, though, where his soulmark should be, is a web of scaring. On the edges there are remnants of words, “I’m” and part of a “y”, but that’s all.
A year later, Natasha looks up from her book, not disrupting the storelska perched on her shoulder, as she hears the familiar sound of stiletto heels.
“I’m glad he did,” Steve says, and he hates that Tony looks surprised at that. Then Steve finds himself needing to ask, “You said, ‘not then’?”
“You ready for us?” Steve asked, his heart racing in anticipation as he opened the door to the roof and looked out at the table Tony was setting up.
Tony took a deep breath, but said nothing more, turning to walk down the hall and out of the Raft.
, but his reaction to seeing
“Tony.”
A well-built blond man toward his right caught Tony’s eye.  Could that be...?
“I’ll take the stuffed Iron Man, please,” Steve said innocently, then held up the second ball. “Do I get to go again?”
Finally Tony corners him. “Sweetheart. You’re in pain. Do you have a broken tooth?”
“Of course!” came one man’s reply, while others gave mixed grumbles. “Well, it carries off some of the livestock, and once kidnapped a young lady!”
“I think we can get Tony to let the storelskas stay.”
“Blanket?”
“When--you said you ‘used to’ feel... like this. What helped?”
The man’s eyes widened and his cheeks turned red, and Tony was pleased to see his whole face react, even if his blue eyes were still wonderfully expressive. “I--really?”
Tony’s eyes are wide, flickering between Steve’s eyes and his lips. “For what?”
As he reached out to touch Tony’s arm, the genius jerked, startled, and would have fallen if Bucky hadn’t reached out to steady him.
Steve hated the cold.
“Snack?”
“I--I needed equipment for something, but I don’t want you to see it.”
“Good to hear, thanks, J.” Fortunately they’d gotten the docks cleared of civilians, so no need to worry about unknown individuals’ allergens.  Tony relayed the news to the team, “Nothing dangerous, you all will just have to deal with the smell until you can hit the showers.”
“I wanted to spend time with the man I love. Of course I wanted you to enjoy it, but the fact that you didn’t is
He ended up catching Spider-Man in something like a bridal carry, careful not to let the kid’s head smack the armor. Then he gently lowered them both to the ground.
Tony’s serious when he replies,
“I’m afraid, Sergeant Barnes, that teeth are composed primarily of minerals rather than living tissue, and as such are not able to repair themselves the way bones can. Minor damage due to decay can heal slowly over time, but a deep cavity or broken tooth will not mend itself without medical intervention.” After a pause, probably to let Bucky process that depressing news, the AI questions, “Do you require a dentist? I can arrange--”
He doesn’t respond.
The screen was shattered and liquid was seeping in. The phone was almost certainly useless.
“Thank you,” Steve replies earnestly. “So you want to watch me do it some more?”
regret
Then Tony asks, “Why do you think I asked you those questions earlier?”
“You do realize he knows now,” Tony points out. Steve can’t have missed the admiring looks. “And he doesn’t seem upset about it.”
When Steve struggles to reply, Tony clears his throat.
It’s been two weeks since the Intergalactic Space Alliance ship came and left. Two weeks since Steve refused to leave the remote outpost, knowing that the chances of Tony returning were infinitesimal but unable to consider returning to active duty while knowing Tony could still be out there. General Fury hadn’t been happy about leaving Steve alone there indefinitely, had threatened to court martial him and throw him in prison if he failed to return, but Steve had called his bluff.  Sending a famous war hero to prison would be bad PR, and considering the losses they’d suffered in the war, they needed to refill their ranks with new recruits.
“I do not believe so. The best description might be an unexpected growth.”
Once alone with the still-unconscious Tony, Steve hesitates but eventually reaches out to clasp Tony’s hand. They’re just friends, but Steve thinks recently they might’ve been heading toward something more. Steve wants to be heading toward something more.
Steve steadily returned his gaze, considering for a long moment before finally replying, “There was, um... something my mom did sometimes. I’d lie down with my head in her lap, and she’d rub my hair, my temples, and... it helped sometimes. It was soothing.” Steve’s heart was pounding with the thought of suggesting such an intimate activity with Tony, but... it didn’t feel wrong.
Bucky smiled. Tony was here to save him.
“He left Tony for you, he’s made his choice.”
Blue-grey eyes come up to meet his, almost unseeing for a moment before focusing. There’s a moment of strange uncertainty before Bucky--oh, god, it’s Bucky, he’s alive, how is he alive?--says in a lost voice, “Steve?”
“There won’t be time,” Tony reminded him, gently. “You can’t risk being captured.”
The glow of an arc reactor.
The bright warm honey-brown eyes of the stranger--
The response shocks Steve--not just the answer, but the delivery. “You--I really thought you just wouldn’t answer.” There’s an uncomfortable feeling in his gut.
They enjoyed the rest of their treat in a similar manner, sharing and flirting and laughing. It was silly, and sticky, and a perfect first date.
“Your name is James Buchanan Barnes, and you knew my husband, and you were a good man, once.”
“I didn’t hit my head--”
Bucky forgets almost immediately the backhand he takes to the jaw that has him spitting blood. Sure, it hurts and momentarily makes him wish he were sniping instead of in hand-to-hand combat right now, but he’s taken worse hits and healed up fast, so he dismisses the pain and helps the team take down the minions while Tony locates the head honcho.
“Thank you,” he breathes as he pulls back.
Right. That didn’t sound good, but if they didn’t want him to stop being Spider-Man, what could they want? “Which is?”
When Tony is having a terrible day, a kind stranger gives him the coat off his back.
Ned shrugged helplessly. “Wherever the cat went, I guess. We saw the fire, and we were about to call it in when he saw a cat go in that window there, so he went after it, and I tried to tell him to just leave it to you guys, but he went anyway, and--”
“No, Tony--”
Tony grimaced in sympathy. Work had been hard to find for some returning from the war, and he imagined it was even harder for amputees.
” Peter demanded with the righteousness of a six-year-old who believes that some things, like playing in the snow, should be universally adored.
The blue eye widened.
answer is something he probably would’ve said regardless of the spell.
Tony stopped. “Yes...?”
The joy on Bucky’s face was clear, and Tony couldn’t help but grin himself. “Nicely done.”
“Yeah, I’m sure they have one of those,” the friend--Platypus? that has to be a nickname--replies dryly, then turns toward the shop. “Or maybe one that says ‘Tony Stank’.”
“So we can keep them?” Clint asks hopefully.
“Morgan says when you fancy someone it means you like them and you want to kiss them,” Steve says, his voice going a little raspy as he takes a step closer.
Had Bucky been in human form, he might have wondered what an exotic bird was doing in the forests of New York. He might have contemplated the beauty of the bright red and yellow feathers, and pondered whether it was a pet escaped from some wealthy eccentric’s home.
me to keep going?”
Then Tony was in his space, arms wrapped around him, lips on his, kissing him deeply, urgently. Then Steve was being lifted to sit on a nearby table, as the kiss continued. Steve was starting to feel short of breath when Tony stopped and pulled back, leaving his hands on Steve’s shoulders.
A woman in robes appears beside him. She seems to step out of thin air--handy for bypassing the waxed floor problem, Steve supposes, even as he tries to bring his sobs under control and sit up. She slides down gracefully to sit beside him.
Tony stared at his friend, bewildered. “What?”
“Doesn’t matter, you’re sleep-deprived and possibly concussed--”
“How come nobody’s put anything on top?” Tony asked.
Then he opened the faceplate and, seeing the way the world spun around him despite the fact that he was laying on the ground, realized maybe it wasn’t the armor that was damaged.
“This isn’t ‘a little’, for God’s sake, this is three months’ rent, and I’m not gonna accept this for just helping you out when you needed it!” Steve’s eyes flashed, righteousness flaring from his clenched jaw to his slim, tensed-for-a-fight shoulders.
Tony hesitated, looking down at the destroyed phone he was still holding. He couldn’t call Happy to pick him up from the coffee house he’d been heading toward, so he’d have to walk back to the office. It wasn’t a long walk, but even a few blocks in a dripping wet suit would be sheer misery. The coat, while neither the warmest nor the most fashionable, would at least make the trip more tolerable.
Tony simply leaned against a nearby table and watched.
Tony shakes his head. “Captain America is human.  You don’t have to be perfect.  Especially not in front of us.”
“Will you go to dinner with me?” Steve surprised both of them by asking. But before Tony could respond, he backtracked to hear the rest of what the man had said. “Wait,
Steve feels like the air has been punched out of him. Taking a shaky breath, he asks, “What do you think will happen if you safeword?”
When they finally got in, the cabin itself wasn’t much warmer than outside, but being out of the wind alone was a relief. Steve stood in the entrance, suddenly too tired to even walk further in, much less assess the accommodations and see if things were in place for their mission starting the next day.
Her eyes widen in surprise, but then she smiles. “Maria. Maria Stark.”
“Thanks, Pops,” he replied, then threw the ball back to Steve.
“I went to the sorceress’ holding cell and had her cast the truth spell on me.”
“You don’t fancy each other?” Steve asks, remembering Morgan’s phrasing and wondering if that’s how they’d explained the concept to her.
Finally, turning the corner, Tony slowed, feeling nearly lightheaded with relief at seeing his son in one piece, standing in the back of one of the ambulances. Apart from the oxygen mask over his nose and mouth, and some ash on his clothes, he appeared unharmed. As Tony got closer, he saw the soft smile on Peter’s face through the mask, as he looked down at someone or something on the gurney.
I've realized several of these this year have had themes of isolation and/or despair... Thanks, 2020.
After finding an enlightening photo from Tony’s college years, followed by an intense talk with Rhodey, Steve goes to see Tony in his workshop.
“Really, Barton?” Tony shook his head. “Did you fill a Super Soaker with that crap just so you could force me to go through what you did?”
“I hope not,” Steve replied coolly, “But
He doesn’t see how she reacts to his screams.
Today, though, there was no flirting. Today was a barely-conscious day, Tony’s mumbling indecipherable but Steve just smiled and got him his usual, a dark roast with a cheese danish on the side.
She points at the headline on a newspaper at a nearby stand: TONY STARK MISSING IN AFGHANISTAN.
Natasha hears strange sounds coming from the common area before she enters the room. Then she blinks at the sight before her.
Steve wanted to throw up. Rhodes had been right that he’d almost killed Tony. Even if he hadn’t been in love with Tony, maybe if he’d been a better friend, told him the truth about his parents as soon as he’d found out, it would have made a difference.
“Not to lock me out of my own workshop. Override, Juliet Bravo One Nine One Seven.”
“Says the man in the tin can,” Clint grumbled. “You don’t even smell it, do you?”
“And you didn’t tell--” Steve interrupts himself as he realizes, “You did tell me. But I didn’t believe you because you didn’t safeword.” He sighs. “We’re not doing that again. You say
Tony felt a hand hold his armored hand, and he wished he weren’t wearing the gauntlet, but retracting it seemed like an impossible task. “How about we talk about this more when you’re feeling a little better, okay?”
“I had time to get out of the suit before sending JARVIS to pilot it as bait, but no time to tell anyone I wouldn’t be in it, I’m so sorry.”
She reaches in and, somehow without making physical contact with it, pulls the shining green stone out of the case and places it in her necklace.
Later, he would recommend Tony analyze the armor’s footage of the woman so they could identify her and keep an eye on her activities, just in case. But for now she hadn’t technically done anything illegal, simply asked to meet him and then tried to use some obsolete brainwashing.
Spider-Man will be totally jealous--”
“You’re the best, doll,” Bucky said, then finally chose a plum and took a big bite. “Mmmm....” he moaned, and suddenly Tony’s heart was pounding for a different reason, watching his boyfriend savor the fruit.
It was a bot. It looked a little like DUM-E and his brothers, but this one was smaller, and had two arms coming out of the central base, shaped more like prosthetic human arms (normal substandard ones, not like Bucky’s) than Tony’s bots’ crane-like arms.
The man stopped his frantic motion away from the threat and stared back at Bucky. “
“Apart from discovering the love isn’t unrequited after all, surgery is the only way to survive Hanahaki. The growth is removed from the lungs. There’s a side effect, though, so a lot of people refuse the procedure. The patient loses all feelings for the person they loved. Not their memories, exactly, just the emotions associated with them.”
Steve’s mind sputters to a stop as he imagines Tony in the short striped skirt, the backless top, the silver heels...
Tony watched Barnes head back to Steve, as Rhodey approached him. There was purpose in the one-armed man’s step, and Tony took that to mean the duel was officially a Go.
Bucky loses his worried and suspicious look, and grins. “Well, then, you can say ‘I told you so.’”
Tony crossed his arms. “Yeah. Tomorrow. Today, you’re hurt, and I want to help. You mother hen me when I’m sick or hurt, so what, I can’t return the favor?”
“Okay?”
“No!” Tony shouted, tears threatening in his eyes, but he knew crying now would only make everything worse.
Bulky (Steve/Tony/Bucky) - Steve and Bucky’s bed was not made for three, especially not when two are super soldiers.
It’s not the food or the game or the mementos that make this modern life more bearable. It’s the people. He has friends who care about him, who want to help him however they can, to be there for him. And that makes him want to be there for them in turn.
“No, silly,” she denies with the confidence of a child, “I’m still his little girl.”
Clint shrugs. “Sorry your taste buds are shit,” he says matter-of-factly. “I’m still gonna make it, but you can have something else and leave more for those of us who’ll appreciate it.”
” came a feminine voice.

A grey cat, and three tiny scraggly-looking kittens. One of the kittens was fidgeting with what seemed to be a tiny version of the oxygen mask Peter had, while the other two kittens nursed from the mother cat. She was lapping at a bowl of water, occasionally pausing to glance over at the masked kitten as if to make sure it was still there.
This time, Bucky had only been away for five days, but from the smell when he entered the workshop, he suspected Tony had not showered in that time.
Then he realized it was Tony’s voice. What...?
Tony stills. He’s silent for a moment, before answering quietly, “True.” He doesn’t say anything more.
Steve nods, relieved Bruce chose something he’s mentioned particularly enjoying. “That sounds good, thank you.”
“It’s incredible,” Tony said, feeling choked up. He built things for other people--no one had ever built something for
From behind him, Steve sits up and looks down as well. “Are you hurt?”
Rhodey raises a hand in acknowledgement and continues toward the shop.
When he returned to himself some time later, the pleasant floaty feeling was wonderful, but even better was the soft, contented smile Tony gave him.
it. Then we’ll stop, and I’ll check in with you, see if you want to keep going or not, and you’ll see that either way, I’m not leaving. I want you to stop being afraid of using a safeword, so when you really do need it, you’ll use it and know that I’ll still be here for you. Okay?”
“Okay. Uh. Here I go.”
Then they start hitting a little harder:
Tony frowned. This was not how it was supposed to go.
“I said ‘not then’... huh.” Tony’s brow furrows. “There were times I wasn’t exactly trying to die, but I did stupid, dangerous shit without caring if I’d survive.” He blinks. “I hadn’t realized I thought of those as actual suicide attempts, but yeah, passively suicidal is a thing.”
I've written where they have to deal with aggressive flora...
“Okay, yeah, let’s do this.” Tony walked over to the basket, took out the gold-titanium ring half-hidden under a plum, walked back to Bucky, and got down on one knee. “James Buchanan Barnes, you are everything in the world to me. You keep me sane when I’m losing my mind, but if I’m only going half crazy you come along for the ride. I love you, and I want to spend forever with you. Will you marry me?”
Steve jolts a little, uncomfortable with the word even if he hasn’t heard the phrase. Suicide isn’t something you
“Ooh,” Bucky said, eyes alighting on the fruit basket. “Plums! Ripe ones, too. Those look amazing, love!”
Steve hears a choked sound from Tony, and he moves his gaze to his standing lover without moving his head away from Bucky’s gloved caress. There are tears in Tony’s eyes, and a smile that’s somehow happy and sad at the same time on his lips. “What’s wrong?”
“Go’n’ home?” He sounds so young and yearning it breaks Tony’s heart.
“Nope, it’s making a comeback, deal with it,” the friend--Rhodey sounds a little more plausible to be a name?--retorts as he heads off.
Tony braced himself against the cold, the suit jacket which had been sufficient to keep him almost warm now soaked through, sending icy misery through his body, worse when a gust of wind buffeted him. He gritted his teeth and reached for his phone, cold fingers fumbling once before managing to grab it.
Had Tony been a prisoner, too? “I’ll do my best. Are you okay?” Steve asks. “Do you or he need immediate medical treatment?” There obviously isn’t a doctor on the outpost, but it is fairly well stocked in medical supplies, and Steve has some field medic training.
I can live with. You think Snowball will wanna sleep in the bed with us? Maybe without the Iron Cat armor?”
Tony frowned. The point was to let him keep the radio he clearly wanted. “It’s yours, you didn’t look happy to be giving it up.”
Steve and Bucky find something unusual when out fishing.
Tony lay there, wondering how badly the armor must be damaged for the HUD to be displaying such a meaningless blur of light and color.
Tony stared at the small, open box Steve was holding in front of him. At the gleam of the gold band with a magnificent stripe of red. At his boyfriend, whose face had changed from excited to concerned, probably due to how long Tony had been staring.
“For not killing me?” Tony asked, no edge to the words.
He shakes his head. “I don’t think I ever did. And now--”
“He is not a monster he my friends”
“Eddie honey Bucky is still to little to understand what you and Venom have. And what you have is something beautiful because you are always gonna have each other your are never gonna be alone. We love you both of you no matter what”
The two Little’s were running over all the floor screaming. Steve who was taking a shower didn’t listen to their Little’s  screams.
He put both boys in their high chairs and went to the kitchen to start breakfast. He made some pancakes and orange juice. He put a plate in front of each boys.
Loki then decided the cream was bored so he put the jar again in his place and continue watching TV, scratching some times his balls and penis that were a little itchy.
“Okay then, but first let’s wake up your brother. Wanna help me?” Steve said
-we forgive you- each Bucky and Tony give a kiss to Loki cheeks
-haha you’re right you'll be fine I'll be back at night call me if you have any problems. Bye baby- Bruce said kissing Tony cheek to then leave
They don’t know what they are talking about
“Loki!”
"Don't say that, baby boy. You're still good, you just made a bad decision. Daddy still loves you." Thor said, carrying his baby to the nursery.
Im so sorry i know it’s been a while and that I haven’t update in years so sorry !
“I gave him one in the afternoon to help with the rash so I think he is very clean” Thro said tickling Loki a little
“I’m bored” Tony whines pulling Bucky’s arm a little
"DADDY DADDY UP UP UP" Tony start yelling happily making grabbing hands towards his daddy.
They know Thor was currently living in Earth. In a little building next to the stark tower. Thor didn’t like the idea of living in the tower cause he want a different environment for Loki so they live close to the team.
“Shhh baby is over” Thor said changing Loki’s nappy and taking his baby to the bed with a warm bottle of milk.
“It’s was a pleasure knowing your littles Steve we will arrange another visit some time” Anne took the boy in her arms wiping away his tears.
