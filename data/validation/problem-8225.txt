Tony swallowed.  Then he said, “I want it.”
Tony thought back.  There was a thunderclap of white, then—not much.  Muffled, underwater.  Hell.  “He’s—please tell me we got him.”  He could not imagine gearing up for round two.
Tony asked, “What was her name?”

“I will take that as a negative,” Stovok said.  “Who would like to go first?”

Tony huffed.  “Things—I will be writing Nick a very strongly worded letter.”
Steve sighed, but he went with it.
In the end, he was not sure the speech actually made a difference, but the farewell handshakes he received seemed warm, genuine.

Pulling over on the road’s shoulder, Steve sat on his bike and looked up at the black sky, asking the stars,
“I want one horrible line for this horrible drink I am about to drink,” Steve explained, holding the shot glass up demonstratively.
“Do it again,” Steve insisted.  “S’my birthday.”
“This seems . . . normal.”
“Here’s what we’re gonna do,” Tony said, voice calm, not at all alarmed.  And he put everything aright.
Not merely the poets would suffer.  The navigators, who looked heavenward for inspiration and consolation, would be stranded on pitch-black nights.  The Earth itself would look vastly different, her spin untrimmed by the resisting tug of the Moon, her waters tepid without the churning pull of an orbiting satellite.  Days would be shorter and nights would be bleaker.  Whole ecosystems, dependent on tidal forces, would simply vanish.
Bruce looked at Steve.  Steve raised both eyebrows expectantly, resisting the urge to say,
“You know how fast you were driving?” the cop asked, shining a flashlight on Clint.
Tony sighed, stopped, and faced him head-on.  “Let’s just say we’ve both been a jerk and call it even,” he said.
“It’s just for show.”
Shaking his head, Tony insisted, “You can’t be serious.  I’m
“That’s it, the clock is ticking, I’m going to die in twelve hours,” Tony said mournfully.  “So long, snowball.”
“Abraham Lincoln,” Clint filled in.
When Steve said blankly, “I’m guessing it doesn’t have to do with an automobile?” Tony huffed and made a gesture for the journal.
Tony said, “I
Clint snorted a laugh into his beverage.  The volume in the living area reached a crescendo as Thor finished his guitar solo.  “Would you
“That’s a little much,” Tony chimed in, but Clint shushed him.
“Well, if he dies, he asked for it,” Barton said dryly, but he seemed almost acquiescent, like he, too, trusted in the plan.  A moment later, the prickly, cold water feeling of being unmade was offset by stepping foot on a terrestrial world.
Steve approached.
“Eh, shuddup,” Steve muttered, more on autopilot than mean-spirited rebuke, finishing off the bite and rolling up another ball.  “You’re nothin’ but trouble, Stark.”

“Yes, Steve,” Tony said.  “I have kidnapped world famous German composer Ludwig van Beethoven, imprisoned him in my car, and forced him to play at a moment’s notice for our private enjoyment.”
Sighing, Cap Bird looked at the camera and said, “We can win.  We will win.  Whatever it takes.”  Then he stepped out of frame and told Tony simply, “And if you call me Cap Bird one more time, I will never make you chocolate chip cookies again.”
“Of course I do,” Tony said, typing something on his telephone.  “It’s my very special skill.”
Steve clasped his wrist in a proper Asgardian greeting.  “It’s good to see you, too, Thor,” he greeted.  “And I’m not that easy to kill.”
“It is, of course, an absolute pleasure to meet you,” their guide—a man named Carlton, who seemed unbothered by the belated hour—simpered.  “I must say—you are even more impressive in person.”
“You, uh,” Tony said, and hiccupped once, pronounced against Steve’s chest, “you new in town?”
I'm back! Sorry, champs, didn't mean to leave you hanging. 🐼❤️ Updates might be sporadic for a few days, as I have family coming in town, but I still hope to write at least a few installments! Thanks so much for the support, you guys are a treasure!
Steve ignored him, scrubbing up and setting out a tray.  “
, and laughed at himself, passing the fruit along.  He had no need for credits—the Stark legacy was six generations deep, and would carry on for another six, with Tony’s post-warp theories for manipulating space and traveling to the most distant vacuums already being prototypally implanted.
I tend to change names of small franchises to not besmirch real locations--i.e., a real cider farm becomes a fictionalized cider farm--but in the case of Chicago, there's plenty of character built right into the city that I'll do my best to capitalize on. Still, the proximity of nameless coffee shops and ice cream parlors to the hotel is real, although, like the alpaca farm, I will continue fictionalizing plenty of actual establishments to protect smaller brands from my goofy wrath.
“Back up a bit, did you say
“Ask Cap,” Natasha replied guilelessly.
“Dick,” Tony said at once.
Steve gave him a funny look, like he really wanted to say,
Steve wanted to say that daylight was burning and lives were at stake, but only half of that statement was true.  “All right,” he insisted, because he would not watch them waste the day away forever.  “Get down.”

“Then no,” Steve said simply.  “And for God’s sake.”  He took the Pepsi away and set it on a high shelf.  “
A city.
with a mischievous grin.  “
Tony scrammed.
Who frowned at him.  “You think I would expire so soon?”
“Tell Fury to lay off,” Steve said at last, grateful for how measured his tone was.  “I don’t care what his motives are, I don’t care if he’s worried—the situation is under control.”
Rolling her eyes, sitting in the only other real chair in the room, Natasha flicked off the lights, pulling out her phone and chiding dryly, “Boys.  Don’t wake up the other patients.”
“Really,” Steve said.
.  Caught her.  Signing . . . paaaapers.”
.  But he thought about the alternative—being stranded in the middle of nowhere with only his reflection for company—and decided, “Okay.”
Tony was reminded, for an odd moment, of an early human comforting another early human, gravely wounded, yet, through some miracle of survival, clinging to existence.  He buried his face into the comforting hide of Steve’s shirt-covered stomach, listening to the firm rhythm of his respiration, a metronome of life.
Hill’s look flattened briefly, almost exasperated, but she nodded on her other side.  “My bag,” she said.
“. . . Do you really think they’re alive?” Tony asked.
A tiny, almost missable smile quirked the corner of Steve’s lips.  “You make me happy to be with you,” he acknowledged.
.  She’s a
“If you knew who I was,” Tony said, “you’d already know the answer to that question.”
Steve held his ground, unblinking.
“Thank you,” Tony said.
He had a vision of Thor in the teleportation pod and leaped to his feet.  “Yahtzee!”  At blank looks, he said, “Romanova’s right.  We did transfer them.  Somewhere,” he finished lamely.  “Is this radiation poisoning?  Is my skin going to start blistering?”
“A fly on the wall,” Natasha said.
“Tell me about her.”

Tony nodded, then shook his head, trying to find a way to prelude it.  “. . . You’ve heard of Vita rays?”
is my jam.”
He would not let them hurt him.  Not today.  Not ever.
Good thing, too, Tony thought, watching him effortlessly navigate the foreign terrain, while carrying Dr. Banner, no less.  Vulcans were inhumanly strong—born on a desert world, they had to be.  “Let me know if you need a break,” Tony offered.  Stovok looked at him, measuring him, before deciding he was unmeasurable, or simply not worth his time, shaking his head and moving along.  Puffing up his chest, Tony strode confidently in his wake, intending to overtake him, when another, louder rumble of thunder stilled him.  “We’re in for a storm,” he said.

With palpable reluctance, J.A.R.V.I.S. obliged.
He stared at his own reflection for so long he sort of forgot who he was looking at.  His new avatar of a body hardly needed to blink, compared to his grim façade of the past, a full head shorter.
“No,” Steve interrupted.
Tony said, “No—yes.  Kind of?”  Stovok kept frowning at him, walking without looking at his feet.  Tony nearly stumbled over his own, catching himself.  “It’s exciting, isn’t it?  It’s proof.  Of celestial roots.
Steve . . . hesitated.
“I swear to
“You should go,” Natasha prompted.
“It’s for educational purposes,” Tony insisted.
In an utter daze, poleaxed, he walked away from the car and the scene of the crime, towards the house.

at the last second.  Stovok’s face twisted, a frown furrowing his brow, turning down his mouth.  “Never mind.”
Tony steered him towards Stovok with an arm around his shoulders, hissing, “No, you?”
Steve blinked once, twice, checking that the horse-and-buggy clopping towards them was not a mirage.  “Amish?” he repeated.
“You could fit ten people back here,” Clint said, sitting cross-legged in the back of an open white truck.  “Can we get a creepy white van?”
Steve felt like a jerk.  “I’ve been an awful jerk today,” Steve acknowledged.
“I don’t regret it,” Steve assured him, worn but sincere.
Gotta love crocodiles, Steve thought, following Thor around a glass wall and into a dark, underwater world.

Could be funny, if Tony found out the hard way.
Stupefied once again, Tony could only watch Rogers gather himself, looking a lot less steady than he had in the lobby, standing up to the full logistical might of S.H.I.E.L.D.  He seemed surer, like there was not a force of nature that could pry his grip from Tony’s, and yet less sure, gaze flickering over Tony, lingering on his chest long enough that Tony looked down and saw the source of his own discomfort.
Strand him on an alien planet with no way home, he could at least blend with the natives.  Different kind of language, he mused, accepting another fruit and taking a bite.
Steve thought grimly.
The tangible proof always amazed Tony.  Steve’s skin radiated healthiness; like stone wrapped in silk, he felt like an Olympian, straight from the mountaintop.  Michelangelo could not have carved a more perfect man in a thousand years.  The fact that Steve allowed him to
“Are you sick?” Steve asked frankly, because it seemed less frightening than the real question knocking on his door:
Stovok held out his own PADD, a Personal Access Display Device capable of sending messages at faster-than-light speeds—perfect for the traveling starship crewman.  “Captain Carter has requested our presence on the bridge.  It has been marked
a bit hand.  Tellurium hissed strongly at the disturbance, but, to Tony’s relief/surprise, she allowed Steve to scoop her up and set her on the floor.
Both Happy and Steve stared at him.  Tony just said, “Don’t ask questions you don’t want answers to.”
Tony gave him a very exasperated look.  “Yes, Steve,” he said, which surprised Steve, more than it should have, his own name spoken back to him.  “Of course I do.”
A longer, more dismal silence.
Mayor Cuff smiled, offering her a hand.   “Ms. Rushman.”
He was a dragon without wings, who yearned to be beyond the clouds, above the worldly.  The worldly was precious, but up top, he felt timeless.  Outside it all.

“Something wrong?” Steve asked, stepping around the car.
“I don’t like that look,” Steve said, narrowing his eyes.  “What’s that about?”
Steve rolled his eyes.  Twice!  Tony would have felt

It was an odd asynchronicity.  The airy space was almost stiflingly warm, but the cold was low, in his bones, perforating outward.  He chafed a palm over his arm to warm it.
“No, I don’t.  Don’t be stupid.  They’ll be fine.”
Looking back out the window, Steve said nothing.
Tony blushed.  “Well,” he started, and Steve laughed, a big, unexpected thing.
“Good morning, sleeping beauty,” Ensign Barton greeted, piloting the little transport through deep space.  “I thought we’d reach the
With a small sigh through his nose, Stovok said, “I have failed more than I have succeeded.  I do not know what that makes me.”
Tony jotted something else down.  “I wanna play,” Clint complained, shoving himself between the seats again and ignoring Steve’s restraining arm.  “It’s my newspaper.”
They stared each other down.
Steve thought about digging in his heels, forcing Tony to meet the consequences of his actions.  Then Steve shook his head and stepped up to bat.
There was nothing but quiet breathing from the couch for a long time.  Tony waited.  He wondered what he was waiting to hear.
Mr. Stark
They were babies, barely the length of Steve’s forearm, but it still counted.
As he entered the living room, Tony was struck by a feeling of—not triumph, precisely, but conviction.
Thor looked at him like the last tree on Earth had been felled mere hours before Thor’s arrival, leaving only shrubbery behind.
“It seems others have claimed this trophy,” Thor mourned, indicating a huge crocodile helpfully identified as a
The cashier punched the numbers into the machine.  Then he handed Clint a card.
“It’s already got a name,” Bruce grunted, but at least he looked marginally less murderous.  “Nibiru.”
“They sent out the fake transmission,” Admiral Fury said.  “We only found out after intercepting a Romulan contact complaining about potential interference.  It took . . . a few days, to decode.  You can thank Lieutenant Romanova for the assistance.”
.  He let go as quickly as he dared, Stovok’s hands steadying his waist as he backed up.  “So, I found a fruit.”
Shrugging a shoulder, Steve informed him, “I didn’t choose it.”
A firm knock came on the external door.  Tony sighed loudly as Romanova switched the transport into pre-transit once again.  He just wanted to get in,

Marker nudged him again, bobbing his head in a clear,
He could not bear to shut his eyes, to not see the danger coming, so he stared at the space in front of him, watching Steve creep into his periphery.  There were no bloodstains on the floor, no massive red flags waving in the wind, begging for a quick fix.  A bleed could be stemmed.  But this—there was nothing for

Finally, the black-and-gold Iron Man suit stepped forward.  Together, they managed to haul Steve’s limp-noodle carcass onto a couch, which ruined the upholstery, but restored Tony’s dwindling faith in the universe.
Thor still had one hand upraised, perfectly frozen in time.
He marveled at the marble dunes of Steve’s back, smoothing his palms over them methodically.  Steve’s breath wafted across his folded arms, his half-lidded eyes regarding the ocean view with mild interest.  His entire demeanor reminded Tony of a lolling big cat, approaching but never crossing the line of boredom.  He indulged Tony’s whims.  He indulged

“Can I try?” Bruce asked shyly.
“Hot dog,” Steve corrected, holding the last one up.
“What?” Dr. Banner said, irritably holding up a hand towards his ear.  He yelped and slipped abruptly, and Tony noticed in horror a white hand wrapped around his ankle.  “Tony,” Dr. Banner bawled, clawing at the sand.  “Help me!”
“I’m not crazy,” Tony hastened to explain, before Steve could have him politely taken away.  “I’m—wait a sec.”  He frowned.  “You really were.  There.”  He stumbled over the words.
Tony made a small retching noise.  Steve patted his back twice in consolation.
“That was
“I do not know,” Stovok said, which hurt, more than Tony wanted to admit.  “I have never had one.”
“Ain’t that something,” Tony scowled.
“Yeah.  This’ll be easy.  See if I can’t catch Pierce on my way out.”  He smiled.  It was a smile you could fall in love with, Steve knew—and, he knew, smiling back, just a little, unable to help himself, he already

Tony waved a hand dismissively in Steve’s direction, digging into his burger again.  “Give him the shovel talk again.”

“Nah, it’s fine,” Ice Cream Man said, sweeping the floor nearby.  “Keep calm and party rock on.”

Steve was pretty sure he was meant to say something that was not,
“I was out of the game for . . . two days,” Barton said, plopping down on the rolling stool used by medical professionals only with an insouciant half-smile.  “Trust me.  I’m wired for a while yet.”  Slapping his own shoulder, he added, “

all over the world of a prized collection.”
“Guy’s gotta eat,” Steve said, shrugging self-consciously.  He had always had an offbeat relationship with food—for most of his life, it had been the one point of envy that he could not shake, the yearning in his gut that entreated his humble lifestyle for more.  His Ma’s cooking had always been comforting to him, but he had preferred the company more than the food.  “What’s your favorite?” he asked suddenly, putting distance between himself and the memory by directing his attention at Tony.

Even Tony could not expect to hold up to centuries of damnation, as evidenced by his unceremonious removal of the enfeebled former King known as Kevin, now a pile of skeleton bones artfully arranged near the foot of his throne.  A helpful reminder to rebel-scum what would happen to them if they challenged their new
“Good thing I’m not the leader,” Steve grumbled, which set Clint off.
Tony rolled his eyes, turning away and walking out.
Steve pinched the bridge of his nose.

in the night, you know what to do.”
Stovok gave him a palpably unimpressed look behind the mask.  “We will most certainly be logging our journey, regardless of the outcome.”
“. . . You think it was ever inhabited?” Tony asked quietly, the elephant in the transport vessel.
“Calm yourself, Doctor,” Stovok repeated, almost softly.
Near panic, he broke Thor’s hold and fled through a pair of brightly-lit doors.
It did not matter that it was impossible to find a dragon that did not want to be found.  It was not magic; it was simple fact.  Dragons were sleek, cunning, and experts at camouflage.  From a young age, Tony had known that dragons were good at hiding—they had to be, to survive against covetous humans.  Even a relatively large animal, like Marker, was miniscule when compared to the vast continent below.
“We don’t get along, he’s Dad’s dragon, why should we?  Old Man hated me.  He’s fine.  He’s just hungry.  He wants to hunt.  He’ll be back.”
Shrugging, Tony said, “No idea, I don’t make the rules.  I want that,” he added, pointing at the bag.  “Share.”
“Don’t I get one?” Clint wheedled, leaning against the fence.
Thor merely held out both arms and shouted, “Fair Lady!” with such an award-winning smile Natasha smiled back.  “You have returned!”
Thor bodily tossed a Gorn several meters with a triumphant
Tony snapped his fingers.  “Listening to me.
“It’s such an honor to have Captain America on set,” the crew effused.  When Steve demurred that they had more interesting guests on all the time, they replied, “It’s not every day we get an Avenger.”
There was a long pause.
“Because I’m not gonna sponsor a menagerie of taxidermized birds.”
“I suppose.  I don’t know.”

“He took one.  He goddamn—”  He was out the door.

Thor sauntered up to first base, a big, satisfied smile on his face.  He scooped up the tennis ball and made to pocket it.  “Give it here, big guy,” Clint called out, whistling, and Thor chucked the ball to him, far less violently than Steve would have expected.  Fast learner.

, but: “Fury should’a locked me up.”  That surprised even him, and for a long moment, the only sounds were the glacial waters, the glacial winds, and the glacial breaths.
“You’re foul, Tony,” Steve told him.
“You know what I don’t like?”  Tony tapped the metal parasite in his chest.  “Know what I do?  I
“I’m just a sucker for a fluffy white cottontail,” Tony said conclusively, drawing Steve from his thoughts.
The wound on his arm had already begun festering.  Another round of antibiotics, he thought, massaging his right arm.  The scars from a much larger bite were still visible.  He had tangled with a wild dragon, seeking to swallow the hatchling entrusted to his care; he was lucky to still have his arm to show for it.
Tony grimaced.  That made sense.  But—“You said Talosians were involved.”
“I don’t trust you,” Steve grumbled.
, Tony thought, and jogged towards them as fast as his uncooperative legs would allow.  Snow shook off, unfazed, but Steve was moving fast, still holding onto his neck and his dragon.  “Steve!” Tony rasped, voice dry from standing silent and still for so long.  Steve did not pause, entering the house.

in his own world, the very foundation of something right, was unstabilizing.
Steve ground his teeth.  “I don’t recall inviting you,” he informed them.
“What’s weird?” Tony asked.
“Am I not supposed to?”  Tony shrugged a shoulder, grimaced at the way it pulled on his back.  “They’re . . . like people, but . . . different.”
“Enemies.  Keep ‘em closer.”
In an odd way, Steve was actually touched.  The Captain America charm worked on the
“Pleasure’s all mine,” Coleman agreed, waving him along.  “Now, go on.  Good luck.  It’s a mean world out there.”
Bruce swung with heart and managed to bounce the tennis ball to the pitcher’s mound.  Clint, who had been loping around the farthest reaches of the field, took off like a shot, streaking across the field while Bruce, blind with panic, raced for third base.  “Other way!” Tony shouted.  In a definitely-illegal but highly efficient maneuver, Bruce cut directly across the field, now on a collision course with Clint.  Clint dove past him for the ball, rolled, and came up running.
“No, you have to bake it,” Steve said, replacing the cookie dough ball on the tray, rolling up more dough without missing a beat.  Tony gave him a floored look.  Steve did not even pause.  “Don’t you know anything?”
Tony nodded once, then slid a shot glass across the counter.  “Try that.”
“You people are out of your minds,” Steve said, shaking his head and breaking off another piece of muffin for himself.  “Absolutely mad.”
“Actually, Iron Man has nothing better to do,” Iron Man replied, sauntering over, blocking the city with his own metal back.
While Steve stood back and watched in stoic resignation, Tony picked up the ingredients and poured them into the bowl, indicating, “See, the beautiful thing about cookies is, you don’t have to be perfect to be
Yours truly,
But, I shall make it worth your while with all the fun in store, and still more coming soon! Thanks again for all the wonderful comments, you are truly amazing, and even just silent hits are spectacular! Thank you, champions! Carry on!
“You could fit the whole family in this one,” Clint went on.  “Come see for yourself.”
Leaving himself open to retaliation, Steve gripped the sides of Iron Man’s helmet in both hands, looked right into those soulless eyes, and insisted, “No one’s gonna take it, Tony.  We just wanna help.”
Then he turned to look at Steve, lying beside Tony, feigning sleep.  Steve’s eyes were closed, and his breath rose and fell evenly, but Tony knew he was awake, like he knew the sun would rise again.  Tony also knew that Marker was alive and well, and that Tony would find him, because these were the unshakable truths.
He barely recognized his own wide-eyed visage in the mirror, a haunted ghostly specter, half-dead already, but the hot water flushed color back into his cheeks.  He rinsed out his mouth, even lathered up his face, shaving off the stubble.  The grim specter still looked back at him, but it was less severe, consoled.  Nothing like hot water and a good clean shave to make one feel new again, Steve thought.
“It’s not mean if it’s factual,” Tony said, then tossed the ball into the air and whacked it nearly vertical.
Simmering privately, he said, “

“Oh, sure, she gets the—”  Grumbling to himself, Tony pushed himself upright.
He was about to reassert his disapproval when the door to the barn opened.

Tony made a wounded noise against him, clinging to him.  “You,” he began, voice raspy, “have terrible timing.”
“I gathered that,” Coleman said with a nod.  He stood.  Both bloodhounds stood with him.  “Aye—you kids be good,” he warned, as they padded around Steve, sniffing hopefully.  Steve just dropped a hand onto the nearest one’s head, patting it.  “Dogs.  Trouble at the best of times.”
“The universe is a vast place,” Sojef added.  “There is enough to explore for . . . ever.  Even when you think you have seen it all, you realize it is constantly shifting.  Constantly

Steve side-eyed him, looking almost as persnickety as Tony felt.  “What’s it to ya?” he asked.
Tony slid down his sunglasses.  “And?”
He frowned, but went along with it, not missing the way Clint grabbed his plate and declared, “More for us.”
Bruce and Thor’s voices joined the fray, but it was Iron Man’s sibilant, “Never let you in,” that carried, somehow, to the underwater muffle of Steve’s thoughts.
“Intentions rarely matter in the grand scheme of things,” Anij said somberly.  She did not appear to have a weapon on her, but Tony felt the tension, nonetheless.  He shifted, moving to grab his tricorder, and felt the pinch of a needle in his neck.  He reached up to rip it out, but the hypospray was fast-acting.  “I did not want it to come to this,” Anij said, looking oddly teary for an alien about to murder them.  “Why did you come?”
Read on and find out! (And thanks a billion for the kind comments! You warm my heart.)
Tony looked down at Steve, cocking his head.  “What does?”
“No, I’m makin’ cookies.”
“No,” the cashier said.
I had a bit of a rough spell, but I return to you, excited and ready for Alaska. First stop: Juneau! Thank you for being patient, and I hope you are well. And, for your patience, have a complimentary cookie: 🍪
“But not for long,” Tony pointed out.

, his Ma would say,
“Grody,” Clint repeated.
Tony switched the radio dial to a far more abrasive outlet.
Still dripping, Steve glared at Bruce, who looked almost wonderstruck, and Tony, who was holding a perfect poker face.  “I ain’t sorry,” Steve said firmly.  “I’m not gonna apologize.”  He could hear Clint refilling the bucket.  “And that’s final.”
Stovok’s expression turned flat.  “Admiral Fury respects you.”
“Says the man wearing the pink apron,” Tony pointed out.
” Thor announced, speaking at a cadence that indicated he had not heard Tony’s humbler contribution.  “
“A tracker,” Clint repeated.
“Hey, sweetheart,” he murmured.  Thallium looked up, depthless black eyes fixing on him, communicating something he could not hear.  “Wanna go for a drive?”
Tony moaned.  “Darling, I’ll marry you for the heating pad.”  It was agony to shift onto his side so Steve could lay it down, but then he settled onto it.  As the warmth slowly seeped into his muscles, he sighed.
,” Steve said sternly.  “You stay outta it.”  He pinned Clint’s foot under his own before Clint could make a break for the water, applying just enough pressure to pin Clint, well aware that he could break his ankle without trying.
“Come here.”
“All right,” Steve said plainly.  “I’ll stay.”
“Thirteen years after the last Great War, we left Earth behind,” Anij explained, seated in front of a large, empty hearth.  “That was two-hundred-and-thirty-nine years ago.”
Tony blinked, surprised at the question.  It had been instinctive, really.
Distracted by his own ails, Tony just sighed and said thinly, “Go.”
He took the clothes.
“Oh, Nat torched that.”  At Steve’s suitably floored look, Tony huffed a laugh and looked away.  “Made you think it.”
“You two eat?” Steve asked them, aware that he sounded a bit mother hennish.  Old C.O. habits died hard.

The clerk traded the bag for the box, asking, “Do you have a litterbox?”
Steve huffed.  Tony’s jaw actually dropped.

Lying face-down next to him, Dr. Bruce Banner snored.
When she stood up, he had his answer.

Steve stared at him uncomprehendingly.
Steve whirled and saw Thor stroking across the water, heart dropping to his feet.
“Say it.”
“And if I had my suit, I could unstitch you,” Tony replied, tapping at his telephone again.  “Not saw in half.

“Wow.  People
He heard more excited whooping in the distance and squeezed his eyes shut.  Probably just murderers.
He heard a slightly louder knock.  The monster was growing impatient.  It would not be much longer until the monster broke down the door.  Acting in Tony’s best interests, of course.

“They have to,” Tony insisted.
It was only minutes before the hour when the President of the United States arrived.  Steve had time to shake hands and exchange a brief greeting before raising the flag at 0600 hours.

,” Hill warned.
The clicks died out.  Snow shook Steve loose; Steve let her go.  Stepping back, Steve weaved on his feet.  Tony punched a soft huff of amusement out of Steve as he grasped on, hugging Steve ferociously from behind.  “Hi, Tony,” Steve greeted him.
It was a sure strikeout, Steve knew, as Clint wound back his arm and launched the tennis ball towards Natasha, still waiting at the plate.  Sure enough, the tennis ball streaked past Bruce, mere yards from the base, and—kept going, uncontested, as Natasha stood her ground and Bruce skidded to a halt on the base.
. o .
He barely noticed the shield slipping away from his loose grip until she had pulled it fully away from him.  Defeated, he looked around the empty room—no monsters, no people waiting to escort him politely back to a room and explain that he really, truly, was not going home—and shook his head.
Dream-Marker looked at him.
“I’m afraid it’s not in my control.”  Reluctantly, Carter admitted, “I have no qualms with your presence aboard my ship, but I am not the one who controls your placement.  As I am sure you are aware, there is a mandatory three-month cooling period on a Federation planet before reassignment—”
Steve sighed.  “It’s too hot for sweaters,” he grumbled, but he tugged the sweater on obediently.  It was a gift—and if there was one thing his Ma had taught him, it was never to reject a gift, no matter how odd.
Four minutes later, a pair of medics arrived.  Using the miracle of electricity, they had Tony Stark breathing the new old-fashioned way, no hands-on maneuver necessary.  Steve sat back, sick at the sight of bruises forming around the arc reactor, those were
Steve sighed.  “I didn’t mean it like that.”
“No, of course you didn’t, you’re a very well-meaning person,” Tony said, which surprised Steve.  Steve halted.  Tony kept walking, then turned at last to face him.  Between the moonlight and the faint blue glow underneath his white shirt, Tony stood out in the darkness.  “I fell out of the

“They aren’t mine,” Tony assured.  Marker crunched down on the cow bone.  “He is.”

“While you were sleeping,” Tony said, waving his free hand dismissively, ignoring Stovok’s reproachful head tilt, like he would correct the implication behind
“Tony, I don’t—”
Steve immediately attempted to hoover up the severed broom head.  Tony face-palmed.
Uncrimping his fingers, he hesitated to remove his grip from around Steve’s neck.  To his surprise, Steve waited for him, instead of taking the opportunity to make a quicker escape.  Relieved that Steve would not abandon him, he forced himself to slip his arms over his head, shuddering as he skimmed his fingers against the cave walls.  He scrambled for a moment in animal desperation upward, but Steve caught him by the hips, holding him steady, insisting, “Hey.  Look at me.”
The old-timers called cars
“Did I laugh?”
“All right,” Steve said slowly.  “Assuming I buy any of that.  Which I do not.”
“That’s confidence,” Tony muttered, looking down at his feet, almost—sweet, in his uniform, bashful and thrown, as scared as he was and yet, when they looked at each other, certain, too.  He even smiled a little.  Steve released him, very conscious of his own hands, what he could
Steve glared back down at him.  “That’s

Shaking his head, Steve told her, “I’m not tired.”
, of course.”  He tried valiantly to suppress a smile at the tiny, almost grim smirk Stovok gave, adding to save himself, “I would never associate with a recreational spelunker.”
“Steve,” Natasha began, and that was enough.
.  He would be here, alone, until his wounds healed.  He would be here, safe, untouched, undiminished.  They could not demean him, sneer at his life’s choices, if they could not get to him.  Hide well enough from the monsters and even they would have to huff and give up, complaining among themselves how difficult Tony Stark was.  Resisting his salvation!
“First the Nibirans, now the Ba’ku.”  Shaking his head, Tony said, “You’re gonna get a big head.  I can feel it.”
“No misunderstandings,” Tony assured.  Steve nearly cracked a tooth.  “You’re in the right place.”
Tony looked at him, taking him in.  Steve wondered what a sight he made, a fox without a foxhole.
They looked at each other for a long moment.
“It’s okay,” Natasha assured.  Somehow, it was.  He dropped into a chair across from her, feeling a big breath come off him at the gesture.  “Oh, it’s too early to be tired,” Natasha teased him.
It was called the
Another scene: “Stovok.”
“I can do it.”
Clint frowned at him.  “Really?  No cake?”
Steve said, “You’re kidding.”  At Tony’s unchanging expression, Steve’s frown deepened.  “. . . You’re not kidding.”
.  “Here,” Steve insisted, graciously cupping both hands under Bruce’s foot and boosting him up onto a support beam.  Bruce scrambled for purchase, offering Steve a shaky smile once he was up.  “Don’t fall,” Steve reminded him.  Bruce nodded, gripping the wooden support beam tightly.
“That is factually incorrect,” Stovok murmured, concentrating on the art, a tiny furrow in his brow.  “Dragons are not real.”
For good measure, Clint dropped the empty bucket on his head.  “Ow,” Steve said neutrally.
. o .
Just an uncontrollable fit of giggles, unstifled and almost drowned out entirely by Clint’s raucous cackle.  Thor, ever one for good humor, grinned, still holding the hose.
Marker folded down on the floor mutely, resting his head on his paws, looking up at him with earnest black eyes.  “Demon puppy,” Tony told him.  Marker’s tail did not wag, but he did blink once in acceptance of the nickname.  “Demon puppy,” Tony repeated to the ceiling, shutting his eyes, waiting.
“Then why is it on my body?”
“Apologies for the interruption,” “Jarvis” said.  “I am only looking out for you.  Might I recommend
After a long minute, Steve reached for his journal.
Tony turned and stormed off.
Natasha broke the silence.  “I wasn’t expecting you,” she said without remorse.
Reflexively, Tony kicked him in the face.  “I’m sorry,” he immediately blurted out.  “I’m sorry, I thought you were—”
“I don’t need it,” Steve deterred, looking around, feeling like he was back on stage, reading a script, judged for every missed word.  “I’m—”  It would be untrue to say,
There was an innocence to the way Stovok drew, a certain lack of self-consciousness, that ached in Tony, reminded him of piles of crumpled digital paper consigned to the digital trash bin.  Stovok made each brush stroke without fearing what would happen, without regard for what could go wrong in the pursuit of something beautiful.  He simply
“The Carnegie?” Bruce asked tentatively.

Steve had to juggle a set of mental pins labeled
“We have to stop,” Clint replied, leaning between the two front seats, looking ready to hijack the wheel at the first indication that Steve would not follow the signs indicating,

on elevated platforms.  Admirers flocked to every car; it was no wonder, Steve mused, that every hotel in a thirty-mile radius was booked, almost solid.
Stovok looked up at him skeptically.  Tony looked back, propped up on one elbow, like they were at a sleepover.
“Not my problem.”

material, not one book or pamphlet or cleverly disguised poster outside his door, nor had he attended any of the classes, group meetings, seminars, “wellness checks,” or any other poorly-designed programs to get him back into society.
Steve nodded at the cup.  “I see you’ve broken your strike.”
“I’ll pass it along,” Steve assured, confident that Clint would find them, when he was ready.  He turned again.
Frowning, with more questions than answers, Steve nevertheless took the hint, exiting the bar ahead of them.
“It’s got a sick beat, though,” Clint said, bobbing his head to the new rhythm.  “Most famous pianist in history was deaf, ain’t that something?”
Slowly, almost sloth-like in its vague sense of motion, Steve’s good hand lifted away from the splint and settled on Tony’s forearm.  A brief shiver of involuntary dread wracked Tony’s central nervous system.
“Vital signs for Master Stark are critical,” informed the same disembodied voice, filling the room in a strange way.  “Please respond accordingly.”
“Be calm,” Stovok advised, turning back to the Nibirans and clicking a few times, then indicating the mountain.  The Nibirans clustered around them, caging them in, and began to march towards the hill.
Stovok looked down at him, unimpressed as always.  “Cease-and-desist.”
“Most people don’t have a
“No,” Steve corrected.
On board the U.S.S.
For a moment, Natasha leaned against his arm.  Then she stepped back.  Steve drew in a shallow breath.  “I’m fine.”
Tony waited.
“Seven,” Natasha said.
“You ever shut up?” Steve asked, not meanly, but perhaps a little less nicely than he might have when the sun was still up.  Buck had always said he was mean after dark, but Steve had thought that that was a disservice to his equally mean sunny-side-up personality.
When he heard no signs of movement, he lifted his shield, prepared to break in.  Then the door swung open, revealing a very rumpled-looking Bruce.  Bruce blinked once in surprise.  “Hi.”
Steve would not drag him away to be seen and picked apart.  Steve would keep him there, close, and above all else,
Tony Stark drove home.
Tellurium got lost.  Rhodes mused, “Your life’s a fairytale, Tony.”
“Where’s Thor?” Steve interrupted, gripping his own legs, willing himself to remain present.  A cold sweat clung to the back of his neck.
“Tell me you have brought the Smoked Bear,” Thor stated somberly, standing behind the door in nothing but a white bathrobe.
. o .
“Tony.”  There it was.  The Cap he knew.  Sharp, clipped.  Not on his side.  Tony’s mouth twitched into a frown.
“Aye,” Thor agreed, prolonging the roll.  “Who does not?”
,” Tony insisted, pinning down the unplugged cord down with the broom.  “
Tony frowned, pacing the bridge.  “Nibiru is thousands of light years away.  Hundreds of thousands, if I remember correctly.  And I do.  Surely, it wasn’t the first choice.”
“Hippies are all about flower power,” Tony said suddenly, pushing himself to his feet.  “Peace in our time.  Make love, not war.”  At Steve’s expression, he added, “I didn’t invent them,” with a self-absolving shrug.  “Oh, and, uh, dams.  Too many dams.”
“Sir, I must inform you that this volume is considered damaging to human hearing for any duration,” the radio interrupted in a calm British tone.
Romanova offered a hand.  Tony warily took it, letting her pull him to his feet.  Then she said, “Positive radiation.”
“You didn’t have to do it.”
and more like a guy with a hangover who had his ways of combating it.
Steve liked polar bears.  He had never had a favorite animal—he liked all animals, equally, except mules; mules kicked, and kicked squarely below the belt, as Steve discovered once, and once was enough—but there was something swell about polar bears.  Maybe it was the influence of all those Arctic explorers he had grown up reading about, as a boy: ill-fated Shackleton, northbound Peary, and larger-than-life Amundsen, swathed in his rich Arctic furs.
“No,” Cap grunted, then, self-correcting, “I do like you, I—it’s just, what’s the word?”
like me.”
—Happy stood up, lurched around the table, and grabbed the back of Tony’s shirt, hauling him into his chest for an embrace.  It was three seconds long, and Tony barely reciprocated, only patting Happy once on the side as Happy returned to his seat, but Steve did not imagine the sheen on Tony’s eyes or the way he avoided looking at them, glancing around the park.
After a solid hour of gladhanding, he finally caved to his baser instincts and took refuge behind a hot dog stand.
But then Tony said, “Aren’t we all, Steve?”  Steve almost wanted to cuff him, to throttle him for the scare, for the sheer dread he had put so simply and easily in Steve’s heart, but Tony was not wrong.
Romanova waited until Thor was out of earshot before explaining calmly, “Hirogens can’t swim in water.  Their muscle density is too high.”
“Favorite what?  Bread?”
. o .
. o .
“But life ain’t about cards,” Steve said seriously, halting on the path, so Tony halted, too, his breath coming in thin but not altogether alarming gasps.  Steve went on: “Life’s about people.  We all need somebody in our corner.  We lose that, we’re in a real tough spot.  We only make it together.”
“You can keep him,” Tony dismissed, enjoying the flat look Stovok gave him.
They climbed to the top floor and looked down upon the
Second-favorite.
Marker ignored Hogan completely, staring right at Tony.  He had not changed—dragons grew explosively early on, then exponentially for the remainder of their extraordinarily long lives—but Tony had.  Tony had changed a lot, limping towards his dragon, feeling like strangers, again.
Stretched out across the folded-down seats, Steve inhaled deeply and exhaled cool night air, letting himself relax a little.  He felt almost dopey with contentment—it was a rare day when he could let his guard down, but the almost cave-like space paired with the crunching of contented popcorn eaters very nearly lulled him off—but he need only shift into a slightly more upright position to remind himself of his job.
,” Thor seethed, standing and approaching in six brisk strides, clasping the man by the shoulder and a hand forcefully in his own huge paw.  “Wonderful.  Delicious.  Prepare more.  As much as you can spare.  I have changed my mind.  Spare nothing.”
“A bell would suit you,” Tony said, nudging Steve’s shoulder.
biographies—twice as many as Tony Stark, but Tony had been alive half as long; he still had time—and every one had tried to capture the enigmatic magnetism that Steve exuded.
” Steve repeated incredulously.
and turned to Dr. Banner.  “Well, it was nice knowing him.”
We're going to Ohioooo.
Not hard enough to take him to the floor, although Steve did wonder how strong Clint thought Natasha was, if this was considered a normal embrace.  “Get off me,” Steve grunted.
Sometimes.
“Do Vulcans drink?”
“Were you not to follow me?” Thor asked.  Then, with a scraping laugh, he added, “Of course!  Only the most valiant shall descend first.  It is my honor to receive this distinction.”
Ignoring him, Stovok kept descending the cliff.  The Commander had a long stride, but at least he moved slowly on the rocks, perhaps for Tony’s sake but more likely Dr. Banner’s.  Still, they made good time—shooed forward by the ever-increasing threat of the storm.
. o .
It landed like a loaf of bread.
Picking up the soaked hatchling, Tony shushed, “Shh, shh, it’s okay, you’re okay.”  Cadmium screeched.  Actinium and Curium followed Marker, who growled at them, as if to say,
Ol’ Pokey promptly made his move.
Tony muttered into the pillow, “Mean dumb cuss.”
“I’m serious.”
“That’s a hell of a dog,” Steve acknowledged, pushing himself to his feet.

The scene shifted: they were sitting on a ship, now, side-by-side, strapped in, ready to warp.  “Are you afraid?” Barnes asked.
“OK, let’s take five,” Steve said, pressing a button on the camera that did absolutely nothing.  In the same voice that once made an alien dictator pale three shades, Steve growled, “
“Maybe not, but I still know how to handle more weapons than you do,” Tony replied.  “Bigger ones, too.  Plasma ones.  Those’ll get you.”
The gleam of mischief in Tony’s smirk was obvious as he looked at Steve and asked, “Do you want me?”

“I’ll take that,” Tony called after them.

“Should we tell them?”
“’end.”
It was an early December morning—never mind which day, exactly—when Steve paused at the stove and turned to look at Tony, sitting in his favorite chair in the living room, with Rico on his lap.
Hours later, Tony lounged on Stovok’s chest on his outsized cot, feeling Stovok’s chest rise and fall with soothing regularity as the half-Vulcan reported, “Stardate: 2305.239.  After responding to a transmission from a group of unidentified Talosians impersonating a distressed Romulan vessel, Dr. Banner, Mr. Stark, and I, Commander Stovok, arrived on

,” Steve relented, waving a hand threateningly at him.  He practically stomped off after Tony, wondering what kind of nonsense was in Clint’s head that Steve needed to shake out of him.
The danger of a good politician, he mused.  Like Stark, Cuff was charming without being overwhelming about it, never so in one’s face he could not be evaded.  He made one want to lean in to listen: even Thor sat silently next to the Mayor, listening to Cuff off-hand Chicago’s history.  “It’s been a long journey.  But it is as they say: ‘A house divided against itself, cannot stand,’” Mayor Cuff said.
“Almost makes you miss New York, doesn’t it?”
Steve scowled, but did not have an answer on file for that, other than,
Steve looked up at Dr. Banner—who had wanted the serum so badly that he had risked it all and suffered the terrible consequences for it—and then back down at Tony’s drawings, losing himself in their intricacies.

“I think we’re done,” Tony said calmly.
Tony finished his coffee before he finished the puzzle.  “Four letter word for

that made Tony want to snarl back at him.  Or just shrink under the bed and not be seen anymore.  He looked away.  “Coma-dream,” he rasped.
The back of his neck prickled.  He resisted the urge to turn around, see if there were more agents in the hallway.  He stepped forward, purposefully calm.  He listened very carefully for a third party, but other than his own pounding heart and the two women before him, all was quiet.
“We ask that you remove them,” the man said.  “We are a village of peace.”
Steve pulled back to look at him.  It was hard to look at him; ashen gray, bandages wrapped around his throat.  He looked like a corpse.  Yet he breathed steadily, asked evenly, “What for?”
, he thought, that funny, funny, funny
Then he took a seat on the bench, inviting with a hand wave Tony to do the same.  Tony sat right next to him, highly aware of his own unwashed garb, and waited for the Vulcan to speak.
“You pass the dove along,” Thor explained patiently, like Tony was particularly slow on the uptake, which was funny enough Steve had to fight a smile as Tony frowned at Thor.  Thor paused his eating long enough to cup his hands around an invisible bird and mimed passing it along.  “It is very easy, even you should be able to do it.”
Marker stood nearby.
. o .
“Sure.  It’s breathtaking.  You haven’t been to Juneau if you haven’t seen Mendenhall.  You’re here tomorrow, I’ll take you there, myself.”
“I grew up with dragons,” Clint had gone on, kicking back with him at some indeterminate hour.  “Grew up in a circus, actually.  Same difference.  I wanted a dragon and my brother, he knew how to get one—and all you gotta do is join the circus.
“Probably for the best,” Steve agreed.
. o .
Thor turned to Tony.  “You can resolve this?”
“James Bond,” Clint said instantly.  “James Bond—the Second.”
Mayor Cuff nodded once.  “Very good, Mr. Barton.  You know, we named the park after him.”
“I asked Stark and he said he’d skin me alive,” Clint reported cheerfully.  “So.  You wanna?”
Steve opened his mouth to argue, but Clint asked, “Where to?” behind him.
Weirdly intrigued, Tony pressed, “So, you
The homeworld of the Ba’ku was eerily similar to Earth.  But—not the Earth Tony had grown up on, which had been shaped in every way by the stars.  It more closely resembled an Earth of lore, where Corinthian columns and sprawling bathhouses were not out of place.  It was like a living time capsule.  It made him uneasy.
Steve stared at it, then, once, stroked the pad with his fingers, just like he had Tony’s arm.
“All right, that’s it.  I’m breaking-and-entering,” Steve declared.
Clint shrugged.  “Still got a couple magic tricks up my sleeve.  Give me a name and I will make it disappear.”
As Tony crunched over the gravel beach towards the hiking trail, Clint indulged Steve: “I didn’t think you’d come lookin’.”
“It’s not the Romanov palace,” Tony conceded, looking at her with a mixture of playful defiance and wary alertness, caught in her trap.  “But this is the Rockefeller Center of the Gold Coast.”
“No,” Steve grunted.
Bruce was right: he was never going off-world
Approaching the tin man seated on the edge of the skyscraper, Steve asked,

models had been preferred on Earth for billions of years, and many seemingly disparate civilizations had been one people, long ago, before dispersing to the stars—but it still surprised Tony to meet one.
Throat tight, Steve reached for the journal and tucked it into his pant pocket.
The scene faded abruptly.  Tony blinked, surprised, and did not have time to collect his own person, seated on a bench, before Stovok stood, paced towards the far window.  He stared out into empty space mutely.
, back onto the ship.  “You are becoming dehydrated,” Stovok said, and handed him an in-case-of-emergency hydro-pack.  “Drink this.”
Stovok inclined his Vulcanic head—pointed ears, flat expression, but unusually soft brows, like his supposedly half-human parentage—and allowed, “I can neither confirm nor deny.”

Steve ignored him, even as Tony tapped him on the back of the shoulder with the brush.  “Hey.
“Don’t get crumbs in my car,” Tony grumped.
A swelling of emotions—pity, anger, frustration, sorrow—engulfed him, only to be swept out to sea on the next wave.  It was not his place to judge Tony’s place on the team.  If Tony wanted to hide his wounds, then who was Steve to expose them?
“Be grateful I didn’t shove you in the
“Props,” Steve repeated dubiously.
“Something like,” Steve acknowledged vaguely, licking his chops.
Tony let out a breath.  A tiny voice piped in, “. . . Should I take this one?”  Moments later, Scott Lang appeared.  He looked more sober than Steve had ever seen him.  Steve felt embarrassment scorch through him, turning away, ashamed at his own reaction.  “No, it was my bad.  I think.  Maybe the—”
If he had a fishing pole, Steve would net and haul Clint himself.  As it was, he could only watch in frustrated horror as Clint disappeared from view.  “And it’s goddamn beautiful!” Clint added buoyantly.
“To be fair, Pepper is probably even more likely to take the shot than you,” Tony muttered.  “Maybe we should—”
Steve sighed a little.  Tony shimmied again, relishing his newly aligned spine or simply bothering Steve, he could not be sure.  Probably both.  He took a leaf from the Bruce Banner book on human relations and looked determinedly out the window, in silence.

And the hatchlings.
“The . . .”  Tony waved vaguely.  “Hatchlings.”
“Right, uh—look, I’m gonna send you coordinates, can you get to them?”
Tony brushed a hand over the blue heart, briefly, and Steve thought it was,
All he could do was love, and hold, and will Tony to endure it with him.
“Bruce washed,” Steve pointed out.
“If you’re gonna learn,” Natasha said, handing Steve the keys to the car, “there’s no better place.”
.  Tony threaded his fingers more tightly in Steve’s shirt.  He did not say it.
“Calm yourself, Doctor,” Stovok said.  “We have hardly exhausted our options.  There are—”
Tony shook his head, apparently arriving at a similar conclusion.
“No, I wanna hear this,” Steve protested, leaning around him and flicking the dial back.
Tony stifled a noise against Rogers' shoulder and gripped his hip, the nearest part he could reach.  “It’s okay.  I know.  I know.”
Bruce looked at the remains of the car wash and paled.  “Oh, no.”
The answer was yes.

And drifted, allowing one arm to settle around Tony, because Tony was there and easy to hold.  There was something burning inside him, something that wanted to be warm and could not get there, but Steve refused to retreat inward, because at least he could feign warmth, this way.
Steve waited until she was out of earshot before asking Tony, “You ever even
He hit the table again in a semi-controlled fall.  And to Steve’s astonishment, the armor on his hands began to retreat, like paint melting down a canvas, revealing a man underneath.  Yet the metal had scarcely retreated to his forearm before it sprung up again, covering his fingertips.  A shiver wracked the metal monster.
“No,” Steve said coolly.
“It feels like homeworld,” Stovok said softly.  He shifted a hand from his own thigh to brush against the blades, using the back of it to avoid the sensitive fingertips.  “It’s . . . sharp.”
“Please,” Steve entreated.
“You don’t think it’s mean to leave him?” Steve asked the assembled in the elevator.

Sitting stiffly in his chair, Iron Man rasped, “I get what I need.  Sunlight.”
“You get hungry or bored?” Tony asked, voice devoid of emotion.

Bruce nodded, barely awake, shuffling up.  Tony sighed audibly, but he did not bite off either of their heads when Bruce grabbed it.  Bruce found a fucking closet, grabbed three.  “Oh, bless you,” Steve told him sincerely, thinking of his Ma, and people who were actually meant to be healers.
“Perhaps,” Sojef allowed.  “But the plant is harmless to the body.  It merely induces a short retrograde amnesia.  Trusting you not to reveal our location . . . would have put our people at risk.  Forgive us, but our faith in Terrans is . . . somewhat limited,” admitted Sojef.
Tony blinked out of his trance, scowling.  “No.

“It may be difficult to accept at this juncture that our actions were not hostile,” Sojef said, speaking very quickly, so as not to be overridden.  “We only desired to send you away in peace.”

Steve shouted back grimly, “I figured that.”  He moved back towards the car, the monster that could probably rip him in ‘twain, and announced, “Fine.  I won’t leave.”

“Hope not,” Chief Security Officer Rhodes said beside him.  “Because last time, you lost one of my best men and the ship’s second-in-command.”
“Oh, God,” Bruce moaned, while Clint and Tony cackled.
“In that case—”  Natasha turned back to the car, then swapped out his original cap with a stiffer baseball hat.  “There.”

Marker quieted for a moment, then backed out of the room.  “Good boy,” Tony whispered, only to eat his words as Marker then shouldered his way, loudly and unapologetically, through the doorframe.  “

“Of course not,” Tony agreed breezily.  “We’ve seen all there is to see in Canada, right?”
Tony just thumped him on the back of a shoulder and said, “Giraffes,” like he might choke on his laughter if he held it in any longer.
“Shh.  Savoring.”  Tony stared at the card a moment longer, then pulled out his telephone and said bluntly, “Roscoe, it’s happening.”
There was a Velcro peeling sound.  Tony frowned, gears turning slowly.  It was only fair: it was

“It is just you and I now, Stark,” Thor said cheerily, leaning back in his chair.  “What say you?”
“We thought about it.”
Barton cackled.  Tony harrumphed.  “Kiss that Andorian beer goodbye.”
“Last I checked, Thor was boozing with the locals downtown,” Clint said, his tone conversational, like none’a the nonsense had transpired at all.  He picked up the rod and cast out the line again, careful not to hook them.  “I didn’t figure I’d find you crazy kids anytime soon,” reel the line, spin the lure, “so, I took it upon myself to keep busy.  Any further questions, Your Honor?”
It did weird things to Tony’s heart, was what it did.  He coughed to distract himself.  Stovok finally acknowledged him: “I am in the middle of something important.  Does your quest supersede it?”

Tony smiled, still looking away, a big, boyish grin.  It looked almost strange on his face, too young, too bright.  “I think it’s called ‘being together, in Chicago.’”
The next target was even stranger than the last.

“Gotta stick it to the man,” Clint said.
“Life’s very short.  Don’t forget to have fun.”  Then he cast the line again.
Cap responded, “No, I don’t think I will.”  Before Pierce could really bristle, Cap went on benignly, “This doesn’t belong to S.H.I.E.L.D.”  Tony heard more words in his tone—
Tony’s predictions were right: the waves foamed close to them, soaking their feet, lashing them with icy mist.  To Tony’s surprise, it smelled vaguely of chlorine.  Stovok encouraged, “Ingest as little as possible,” over a wind that Tony’s tricorder reported as 52 kilometers per hour, strong enough he leaned his head into it and followed directly in the Vulcan’s path, taking advantage of his human shield against the elements.
“Aw, nuts,” Ice Cream Man said, as rainbow-colored sprinkles covered the floor.  “I was hoping that wouldn’t happen.  Let me get some more.”
The future was a weird country.
Steve scowled, nerves feeling raw.  He did not know how he would have responded if Tony
is a mouse.”  It did come alive in a frighteningly real manner, skittering across the table in such a way that, had Steve been a little more awake, he might have leaped to his feet in alarm, but as it was, he watched the fuzzy ball roll along before returning dutifully to Clint’s palm.  “I’m gonna put it under Stark’s bed.”
“Doctor.  You are becoming hysterical,” Stovok said, his voice hardening.  “Still yourself.  Or I will do it for you.”
wondered the ten thousand individuals not chosen for every one dragon-pair.
An unrelenting white fog descended over the peaks, spreading a fine ghostly mist over the trail.  Fearless, Secret trotted down the graveled footpath, clad in his own coat, which amused Steve endlessly.  “He’s Irish, but he can still catch a cold,” their guide explained.
being punishe—”  Then he paused, composed himself.  His expression went blank.  Holding himself at his fullest height, a robotic aura of calm settled over him.  Tony felt a shiver walk down his spine.  To Alexander Pierce alone, he asked softly, “Save the city—get a demotion?”

—as he attempted, semi-successfully, to drag Steve from the scene of the crime.  “Why.  Are you so.

Tony shrugged, then began walking along, encouraging Steve to do the same.  “The history books leave out many sins.  Captain America’s bastard brother doesn’t exactly sell
Shutting his eyes, Steve agreed, “I know.”  The reminder—
Romanova spun her chair around to give him a look.  Behind the opaque space helmet, it seemed only more severe.  “Please don’t eat me,” he begged, then thought of Thor, who literally ate people, and shuddered.  “We only need one Hirogen on board the
And bloodhounds.
“Actually a wizard?
“Please,” entreated Sojef, hands up and face ashen.  “Allow us to explain.”
For once, it was Steve who was ahead of the curve, holding the sniffing tabby close.
“Hugh Hefner defined a generation.  Several generations.  His art was revolutionary for its time.”  Sliding a fresh cup of coffee away from the machine, Tony paced away, tapping at his telephone.  “C’mon, it’s five minutes.  Don’t tell Barton there’s a Secret Agent Supply Store less than three miles from here.”
Of all the things he had expected to go extinct, drive-in theatres seemed high on the list.  There was something precious about them.  Precious things never lasted.
, all gunmetal gore and exposed guts, animalistic creations—but Steve saw the cars of the future for what they were, robotic perfection, sealed off in strange, oblong packages.
They glared at each other.
Sitting top-down in the Audi, Tony offered Thallium a vanilla ice cream cone.  Thallium chomped down on it, not deterred by its cold texture.  Dragons were hardier than humans and smarter than humans.  Even their relationships with humans expressed complexity, ranging from warm to standoffish.
“Fine, I’ll scratch off
“What is this place?” Thor finally asked, as Bruce stood outside the gates, wringing his hands like he would be asked at any moment to recite every indecency that had ever been conducted inside its pristine walls, while Tony paced mutely in front of the gates, unforthcoming.
Third and last, Juneau was truly remote: there was no way in or out but by air or sea.  Just mountains framing every edge, like something out of a storybook.
Shedding his coat, Steve decided it would be at least twenty-five minutes before they arrived at any destination, shimmied until his back was against the soft leather floor, and for good measure, draped his own leather jacket over his face to block out the city lights.
When he awoke again, there was a warm hand in his own, the faint sound of a television sitcom.  There was also, weirdly, no pain.
Still, there was more to life than star-trekking.  There was more than the great big nothingness out there.
Tony shook his head to clear the morning fog, then looked around the shuttle.  “Must’ve been a hell of a ringer.  I don’t even remember the party.”
With a sigh, Tony yanked a throw blanket off the back of another couch and chucked it at him haphazardly.  He started to storm off, relieved of duty.
“An unauthorized rescue, but an invaluable one,” Admiral Fury said.  “Once Captain Quill—”
“See, an equal partner would do something, right about now,” Tony wheedled.
“Well, that’s dramatic,” Tony muttered, shaking out a handful of breath mints.
“Aren’t you a good Samaritan,” Steve grumbled.
Bruce had cautioned, after
“No,” Tony said stubbornly.  “That’s stupid.  You’re stupid.”
,” Tony insisted, as Steve started traying up
Bruce gulped.
Steve’s hand lingered a moment.  Then, he said, “You do deserve peace, Tony.  And I will help you get there.”
Looking at the two would-be rabble-rousers, Steve mused, “Ain’t it early to bar crawl?”
Marker held his gaze, unblinking, silent.  Tony rasped, “I looked for you.”
Stovok inclined his head carefully.  Tony resisted the urge to say,
“At least remember me fondly,” he impressed upon her.
Drawing in a deep breath, he crouched.  He stared into the darkness, a horrified shiver creeping over him.  “Nope, can’t do it,” he announced, getting back up and dusting his hands off, shaking all over.  “Cannot do it.”
Tony stumbled, hit dirt.
“Shouldn’t you be wearing a seatbelt?” Tony asked, looking at Steve for the first time in an hour.
. o .
“This count as bonding?” Steve asked the lot of them, arms folded comfortably across his chest.
Antimatter was wondrous, almost fantastical: the opposite of all the living stuff that made up Tony and the Ba’ku homeworld and every other bit of celestial stardust.  It was the negative symbol in front of the positive number, the logical balancing force of the entire universe.  And it was spectacular in application.  When antimatter came into contact with matter, it annihilated both particles with so much energy it could propel a starship to warp speeds.  The positron—the antimatter’s pairing to the electron—was especially useful, since electrons were generally more persuadable than the tightly knitted proton and neutron at the atomic core.
,” Tony ordered waspishly.
They fed the hogs.
“. . . Of course it is.”
, and up he got again.
Steve pointedly slid the window back up.
Bruce looked dolefully at Steve.  “What?” Steve asked, keeping his voice as neutral as possible.  Bruce still flinched.
,” Dr. Banner whined, but he did get up and even approached the group on cautious footsteps, as their song abruptly halted and they stared at him.  “Yeah, I—hi.  Hi, I’m Bruce.  How are you?  I’m Starfleet.  You know Starfleet?  Oh, God, what am I doing—”
“It should.  For one as intelligent—”
“What does that have to do with anything?” Tony grumbled.  “I’ll die on Christmas if I want to.”
“I somehow find it difficult to imagine you grounded.”
“Your critical misunderstanding of hadrosaurs aside, it’s not.”
Steve bit back an immediate response:
The-Thing-They-Did-Not-Talk-About haunted Steve.
” he complained.
Steve stared at him.  He had a dinosaur puzzle on the carpet in front of him that was three-fourths complete.  Bruce immediately folded onto the floor in front of him with a thankful sigh.
“No,” Steve repeated.
Ready for Chicago? I have *plans.* 🐼❤️ (And a new puppy! Been having an absolutely lovely time with him behind-the-scenes.)
Steve blinked once.  “Of course they do,” he said.  “Monkeys love peanuts.”  He looked at the monkeys bouncing joyfully from branch to branch.  “They’ll eat ‘em right up, I promise you that.”
Looking around the space—some kind of infirmary, yet with more tools than the average mechanic’s shop—Steve spotted a blanket in the corner.  “Be right back,” he said, shifting.
A perfect chameleon, despondency set aside for unfettered anticipation, Thor stepped into the greenhouse, drew in one huge breath, and declared that it smelled like
Tony got to his feet.  He ignored the urge to inject himself directly between the Captain and her First Officer, setting himself beside Stovok.  He had nothing to fear.  Stovok favored him.  Tony had nothing to
“Why, thank you, honeybunch.”
Breathing fast, worked up and beyond the point of trying to calm back down about it, Tony grabbed one of the pillows and flung it hard across the room.  Steve longed to gather him in his arms, hold him, protect him as he had been so unable to, but all he could really do was say, “OK, I’m leaving.  I’m gone.”  And leave the door open.  He kept his footsteps loud, creaking, announcing his departure as he made his way back downstairs, holding Rico to his chest while Tony screamed into a pillow in muted rage.
“Only my fair lady,” Thor said jovially, shaking the dice in his palm.  Bruce watched him curiously.
“Not even if,” Steve agreed, tugging his jacket straight.
“I’m gonna go, now,” Tony prompted, already inching towards the door.  “Got a date with a Hirogen.”
to need you to come home,” Tony gritted out.  “I just . . . do.”
Also, it was too cold, and his clothes were sticking to his skin.
“Oh.  Well.  Same as you,” Tony said, swaying into him as the elevator began to descend.  Steve let him stay without moving him.  “‘Fuck off, Nicholas.’  I added the ‘Nicholas.’”
“Yeah, you heard him,” Tony chimed in.  From behind Steve, of course.
.  Like the Quinjet and the traditional jet, the helicopter hardly replicated that fateful flight.  The acceleration of that final descent had been a beast unto itself, like fighting a hurricane head-on.  Without the adrenaline, Steve would have been hard-pressed to stay awake for the sixty-thousand-foot elevator drop to the ice.
, he thought dryly, but Tony Stark would surrender the shirt off his back before he would surrender the wheel.  Not that it would be a fair trade: the shirt on Tony’s back was
“It is nice you’re doing this,” Steve said at last.  Tony looked at him, an almost defensive anger in his eyes, like Steve was making fun of him.  “No, I mean—for them.”  He waved vaguely at Clint, who was still valiantly deflowering the entire orchard, it seemed, and Bruce, who had hidden himself in a tree.  “I think that it’s—very unselfish of you.”
Tony froze.
It had not been a particularly unusual mission, Tony thought, following in Stovok’s footsteps, careful not to twist an ankle on the shifting terrain, flinching quietly from a rolling wave of thunder in the distance.  While Vulcans were hardly warm and fuzzy, they were one of the most reputable members—indeed, the first non-human members—of the United Federation of Planets, and Vulcans and Romulans shared a close common ancestor.  Indeed, they were once the same people—but the Vulcans had chosen a path of peace to end their endless warring, violent and emotion-driven, while the Romulans had shipped off, colonizing Romulus and Remus and embracing their hostility as a way of life.
Mayor Cuff nodded, then looked around at the group.  “You’ve brought friends.”
“Toots?”
He met her halfway, flinching when a huge drop of blood landed on his shoulder.  She breathed on him, hot and oily.  She could set him on fire faster than he could make the door.  And still, it was the least effective of her killing techniques.
“This is how we handle it on the farm,” Clint huffed, carrying the newly refilled, sloshing bucket over.  “You know, when shit’s misbehaving, you just,” he heaved the bucket, and Steve just stood, impassively, as Clint dumped it over his head.  “You just do that.”  And he dropped the bucket again.  “Now, I don’t wanna give you head trauma—”
“Probably not,” the kid said with a nervous chuckle.  “I’m Peeker.  Peter!  I’m Peter Parker.”
,” he said, louder, spinning on his chair to look down at the perpetrator.  “Give a damn guy a break here, I don’t have my steel-toed boots on.”
Tony said, “You wish you had my armor, hunter,” and probably deserved the elbow to the side from Stovok.  “
”  Looking up at the overcast sky, Tony said, “Isn’t there like, a ten percent chance of rain?”
Then Iron Man dragged him close, so close his cheek pressed against metal, and breathed out, “
“What?  No.  Lincoln Park Conservatory.”
Tony pulled back, wiped the back of his hand over his mouth, and complained, “You taste like dog.”
“You didn’t answer my question.”
“Thor.  Clint,” Steve reminded patiently.
“Indeed,” Thor said, dragging a large red bag behind him.  “I have procured gifts.”
He would literally never live this one down, he thought mournfully, imagining all the future social gatherings full of laughter and shared drinks and constant reminders that he was less manly than Barton.
Steve scowled automatically.
Instead of relaxing at the prospect, Steve bristled.  “Don’t you think that’s a little unnecessary?”
Sitting on a bench beside him, Tony gave him a mean look.  Then, seeing that there was nothing but curiosity in Steve’s eyes, he said, “

Steve said, “Non’a your business,” and jotted down
Clint swung the line back suddenly, nearly hooking them.  “
“I will lock you in the room and tie you to the floor,” Steve snapped.
“The smaller the crew, the less the risk there is to overall loss of life.  Given the starting perimeters, the crew party size was . . . logical.”
, he was ready to argue.
“Okay,” Tony said again, inspired.  He started to move away, and Steve let him without a fight.  Finally: a hint of

Then he felt a warm shoulder crash into his own, a black-clad agent landing next to him.  Steve jolted, nearly scrambled out of the way, nearly
“Actually, that’s spelunking,” Tony said, staring in disbelief as Stovok shimmied and squirmed his way into the improbably narrow crevice.  “You’re absolutely insane, you know that?”
Tony blinked, then looked down at himself.  Heart pounding, he shucked his shirt off and—smoothed a hand over unbroken skin.
This close, he really could feel the weight of a

Steve said, “Aw, no, I couldn’t—” but she insisted:
—was not like ice water.  It was simply a ticking clock on the wall, counting towards midnight.  “I miss you.”

“You ever consider dyeing yours?” Natasha asked, as Tony lifted the backpack out of Steve’s hold and carried it off.
Tony waved him off, dismissing him, and said, “

“Where is he?” Carter repeated.
Marker simply halted beside Tony, close enough he could rest a hand on the dragon’s shoulder.  He was smaller than Snow, and far less dangerous, with his stubbier brow horns.  He was a good dragon, Tony thought, leaning on him.
, and there was nothing Tony could do about it.  Why weren’t the others freaking out?  Why was
“My super-massive-spy-skills.”  Clint squeezed past him and leaped onto the bed.  Natasha pinioned him with lightning-speed—Steve blinked and missed the attack, only catching Clint’s yelp as he found himself trapped between her legs.  Then Clint laughed, breathy but unafraid, like a hyena caught between a lion’s teeth.  Natasha held him for barely a second, then released him, but Clint stayed where he was, asking in a wheedling tone, “How come

Natasha said blithely, “Dwell.”

“A bit early, isn’t it?” Natasha said.  Which, Steve agreed,
Natasha smiled a little, that small, almost familiar smile that made him feel more at home.  “Anyone stuck with Stark for two days is bound to go crazy.”
He squinted at it, focusing on the task.  “No?”
“Well, you should’ve thought of that before getting banned for life,” Tony replied.
“You ever been to Denny’s?” Tony asked him, leaning against the side of the car while Steve went through the motions of filling up the tank.  “I never have.  And I never will.”
Tony crossed the floor, never so far from the machinations of his own body that he could forget that he had one but swiping up the paperback and swinging it in the air meaningfully.  “You don’t get it.  This isn’t a book.  This is a blueprint.  Somebody’s going to make this.
, but he could not leave the dragons alone.  Not even with Happy.  They might very well eat Happy, he thought, two sets of dragon eyes fixed on him.
It was too late.  The Hirogen took one step further, slid down a mild incline, and disappeared under the glossy surface of the lake.
On the 0400 hour, Steve Rogers greeted the nation with a heartfelt proclamation: “Good morning, America.  Happy Fourth of July.”
The two clerks exchanged a brief look that Steve caught in the reflective glass, but neither reached for the telephone to call the cops.  Good clerks.
He pressed his cheek with desperate gratitude against Steve’s arm.  “I’m not crazy,” he whispered.
Steve looked at him blankly for a long moment.  “You are a piece of work,” he said, and then Steve left him,
They sat, almost shoulder-to-shoulder, for the better part of an hour.  Then they followed the tribesmen deeper into the heart of the volcano.
Then Tony sat down by the nearest—admittedly very pretty—fountain and complained about his feet hurting some more.
“What
Rhodes huffed, sipping his drink.  Then he asked seriously, “He treating you right?”
He nodded at it, then clarified, “Toucan.”
“Not about deserve,” Tony said.  Bruce looked at him, hopeful and sad and bitter.  “Not about deserve,” he repeated.
“I thought you had a tracker on him,” Clint replied, teasing the line in the water.
“Gettin’ sleepy over there?”
Thanks again for the support, hope you all are doing well! Enjoy!
“They are highly intelligent,” Stovok said, his voice dead, utterly devoid of emotion.  “They will not wage open warfare on a greater force-in-numbers.  As I have communicated.  Repeatedly.  To Admiral Pierce.”  His voice shook with barely repressed emotion.
Tony looked at him incredulously.  “Best thing since sliced bread, what is
“Aye,” Thor agreed.  “I am a grill master.”
relationship with touch.  Giving it was dangerous, but receiving it was much, much worse.  Even Steve knew to tread carefully.  But Tony did not flinch from him: the morning light was soft, and Steve’s hand was steady near his waist, and Tony trusted him.  “I’m pretty sure you’d find a way to be attractive then, too.”
Clint’s stupid shirt shrunk.
Tony sat with that.  He had never known his father, and his mother had died when he was very young, which had left him an orphan—raised by a family friend, the powerful Obadiah Stane.  Obie had given him everything he needed to excel early in life, even pushed him into Starfleet, although not into the traditional Academy route.  The Stark name alone had helped him make pivotal connections, and he had relished being able to dabble in a bit of everything, to jump off-world on a whim and work on actual warp cores while other cadets simmered in gruelingly tedious theoretical coursework.
He heard a chair nearby, heard Steve Rogers take a seat.  He wanted to snarl about invitations and lack thereof.  He wanted to force Steve to stand if he was to stay, to endure if he was to observe.
“Sons of bitches,” he said.
“Hi, my name’s Clinton Francis Barton, I’m forty-one-years-
.  “But you’re
Thor said, “Truly!  You are of another world, Stark.  ‘Small Smoked Bear of the Big Sandy Lake.’”  Stepping forward, Thor passed “Smokey” along to Steve and hugged Tony, who had the wisdom not to shock the god.  Thor lifted Tony off the ground, squeezed him with an impressive amount of bony crackling, then set Tony back down.
“As to verge on the impossible,” Stovok murmured, then looked aside.  “My apologies, Captain.  I did not intend to interrupt.”
Steve ignored him, continuing his ascent until Tony was forced to back out so he could finish the climb.  Tony did not let Steve push himself to his feet before collapsing on top of him, both arms wrapped around his neck.  Steve huffed in exasperation or amusement, Tony could not tell, and stood anyway, forcing Tony to let go.  Then Steve held out a metal bracelet.  “You dropped this,” he said politely.  “Didn’t think anybody would find it, but—can’t be too careful.”
“‘My life would suck without you’?”
“I don’t have one,” Steve dismissed.
“Is that my
This was all Barton’s fault, he thought, whining audibly as he shuffled forward.  The hellhole entrance reminded him of a storm drain, the kind on the sidewalk that led to unthinkable places.  He hooked one leg over the edge, carefully straddling it.  He squeezed his eyes shut, then swung his other leg over the edge.
“You got a—you need a smoke?”
“. . . Are you serious?” Bruce asked weakly.
Steve frowned, giving her an appraising look.  She stroked a hand over the shield once.  It hummed at the touch.  According to legend—according to
Steve reached out, gripped Tony’s shirt loosely.  “Love you.”
The other door to the van creaked open.  Bruce, who had been hiding behind it, asked meekly, “That was binding?”
Tony just said, “If you give me one of every flavor, I will write you a check for $1,500.”
According to a helpful pamphlet, the Niagara River had an average current speed of four knots.  Given that the threshold for a fast-moving river was
That was the nice thing about Natasha.  She knew how to let things be.
“‘Time is diminishing,’” Tony repeated, shaking his head to himself.  Time had already run out, at least for the crew of the
“I don’t know,” Tony simpered, and then, taking the galaxy’s greatest risk, leaned forward and kissed Stovok right between the brows.  “These are human,” he finished, leaning back, taking in Stovok’s carefully blank expression.
Natasha tilted her head slightly, a vague concession.
“Don’t talk with your mouth full,” Steve replied.
“Sir,” J.A.R.V.I.S. insisted.  “I do not believe this will be productive.”
Tony prodded the suit with the broomstick handle.  The vacuuming ceased.  Both suit and man turned to watch as Steve calmly rolled the vacuum across the floor, raveled up the cord, and hooked it over the back of the machine.  “Perhaps he has ceased,” J.A.R.V.I.S. speculated, turning to look at Tony.
, he thought dourly.
. o .
Thor nodded in agreement, placing a big hand on Tony’s shoulder—Tony winced but had no choice but to go along with it—and declaring, “Absence does encourage the appetite.  A wise move, Stark.”  Looking at the cluster of unsure museum staffers, he added, “And thank you for providing a court worthy of a king.”
Tony made a sudden punched-out sound, then spun around so he was facing the far side of the field.  “What,” Steve demanded, and before he knew it, he had three laughing baboons on his hands.  Well.  Steve was pretty sure Bruce was laughing out of fear of being excluded, but Clint was cackling loudly in pure enjoyment, and Tony, try though he might, could not suppress the giggling fit that overcame him.
Tony said, “Wow.  Pretty
It was only when they were in the elevator, Tony still holding his head, Steve still holding his shield—God help them, if S.H.I.E.L.D. decided to take a less tactful reacquisition approach; they were sitting ducks—that Steve asked quietly, “So, what exactly

They slipped outside the red nebulous clouds and drifted for a while in empty space until Barton announced, “Ready for jump?”
.  Tony had been resting for weeks.  He could not make himself work, could not escape the fog of unwellness, lost in those three damnable words:
“Well, now it’s ruined, you can’t cook that one,” Steve said, shaking his head.  “You have to
“No, I gave it to Bruce,” Tony said, indicating the empty shake and the sleeping not-so-giant.  He passed the drink back, adding, “I hate vanilla.”
The silence was ice-cold.
For the first time in months, Tony felt safe.
“Of course,” Natasha said, very, very coolly.

One thing was for sure: Alaskan wild-caught salmon?  Top
“Um.”  He could practically hear the stalling gears in that genius head of Tony’s.  “What.”

Shifting his weight, leaning into Steve’s physicality to bring himself away, away from the darkness and into the light, Tony searched fruitlessly for scars, signs of the war Steve had endured.  It amazed him that Steve had emerged unscathed from the ice, that seventy years had left no marks.  His fingertips almost could not accept the lack of imperfections, tenacious in their search, sweeping over every millimeter of exposed skin.
Steve toasted it in the fire like a marshmallow, ignoring the errant sparks scattering everywhere.  Tony only noticed when it was almost done, yelping and pulling his arm back.  Steve frowned at it as it petered out.  “Hey,” he complained.  “It wasn’t finished.”
“S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn’t let me visit them very often.”
“Just steal the bear, that’ll work.”
Steve sulked, “Don’t
“RAHHHH,” Thor roared, disembarking at full speed, charging into the middle of a cluster of rather peaceful looking reptiles, who all looked over and scattered like bowling pins upon impact.  Not one of them stood down, and Tony sat in the Captain’s chair of the small transport as Thor roared again and wrestled with approximately seven Gorn simultaneously.  It was the most low-energy fight-to-the-death Tony had ever seen.
Steve gave him space—Tony had no room for anger, no space in his lungs to shout, but Steve knew the importance of being alone, sometimes—and Tony waited and waited as the stars peered out, one-by-one, and Marker did not return.
“You’re going to make dinosaurs,” Steve said dryly.
Then Tony leaned in towards Steve with an audible creaking-of-chair sound.

And Steve . . . Steve did the right thing.  He fished out his very own room key, held it in the air, and whistled once in invitation.

“No, they won’t, they still think fluoride is poison.”
Tony opened his mouth to ask what she was so concerned about at 0300 hours when she reached out and pulled hard on his tunic, tugging brutally on the back of his neck and revealing a large swath of his sternum.  He squawked and reeled back, but she had already let go, so his momentum took him to the grass, where he landed on his ass.  “What the hell was that for?” he grumbled.
“Listen,” Tony bargained.  “We’re both equal partners in this, right?”

Thor said around a crunchy piece of bacon, “Your courtship requires more bread.  Perhaps a dove, if you are serious.”
me,” Tony snarled, almost choking on the word, hunching forward, more scared than angry but angry, too.  Steve would be a fool to not see the anger.
Reeling from the implication, Tony said, “And destroy your world.”
He stepped forward.  “What’s so special about this one?” he asked.
“We might not be your friends,” Hill acknowledged, “but we’re not your enemy.”
“Now the only question is—who’s flying with Thor?”
“Password?”
with Tony Stark still at hand.
“If I knew, I’d tell you,” Steve replied truthfully.  Thor nodded in acknowledgment, releasing him.  “I’ll look into it,” he offered, pulling out his journal and jotting down,
“No, I am not,” Steve said stubbornly, aware that he was probably two wrong moves away from a real penitentiary.  God damn twenty-first century and its god damn rules.  Whatever happened to a little trust?  A little understanding?  He breathed the wrong way, it ended up in the paper.  Huffing—
At a loss for what to say, Steve did not respond immediately.  His legs had fallen asleep, but Steve would be damned if he moved, left Tony stranded, to the wolves.  “You know, I gathered that,” he managed.  After all he had helped do, orchestrate, he deserved it.  He envied Natasha’s ability to do what was hard; he was exhausted, weak, when it came to his team.  Hurting them was unbearable.
“Leading question.”
“Then don’t

, look, but he did, grimly, take it.  “You’re a piece of work,” he told Tony.
Gut twisted up by the pointedness of the confrontation, Steve had to point out, “I know there’s no going back.”
Tony did not respond.  Frustrated but trying to be understanding, trying to be anything but tired and clueless and swamped by the inescapable feeling of
Stovok hemmed and hawed silently, staring at the floor with both hands clasped tightly.  Then he said, “Do you trust me?” without looking up.
“Asgard is a truly wondrous place,” Thor said warmly.  “You would scarcely know what to do with its beauty, were you confronted by it.  The air is as refreshing as a cool lake on a midsummer’s day.  The mountains are treacherous and steep and inhabited by

“Fuck yeah!” Tony echoed, shaking a very frazzled looking Bruce by the shoulder.  “That’s a run!”
Tony gave chase, stiff, unsteady.  “Where the
As the credits rolled, Clint started clapping.  Thor joined in.  Bruce, who had been dozing against a pole, jerked upright, then started clapping with them, looking around unsurely; he flinched when Clint whistled loudly.  “All right,” Steve quelled.  Clint ignored him.
This is a good place to note that I am not a Russian speaker. Nevertheless, I like to include multilingual phrases whenever appropriate, and I do my best to vet them on the Internet prior to placing them in the narrative.
Steve grimaced, an apology already on his tongue.  “Said you’d . . . be right back,” Tony explained softly.
“Careful,” Tony advised, reaching up to pinch his cheek, then mirroring his pose, both arms tucked under his head.  “You’ll make me melt.  I’d make a very unsightly pile of goo.”
There was nothing to fight.  Hogan popped the door open.  Tony suppressed a sigh, climbing stiffly out of the back of the car.
And they all three waited.
Thor’s smile did not dim.  “An apt alternative.  Perhaps such a name would deter the unready.”
, Hasselhoff?” Tony finally prompted.
“My love for them remains undiminished,” Thor said.  “I confess a certain envy for your collection, Stark.”
He propped open the door, a towel high on his waist, and frowned when Natasha offered him a small pile of clothes.  Then, remembering the ugliness in the mirror, he smoothed it into a more neutral expression, somewhat less angry.  “I don’t need your help,” came out of his mouth, which was probably the stupidest thing he could’ve said.
Shaking his head, Steve looked up as their waiter returned with a single slice of toast and a side of margarine.  “Let me know if you need anything else,” she said sweetly.
Then Thor spared him from further dilemma by stealing the basket, and Steve grimly waited for the future King of Everything to have his fill.  Just because Steve was de facto leader of the Avengers did not mean he had supreme authority.  Getting one’s hand bit was very different from getting one’s hand
Tony cleared his throat.  When Natasha released him with a parting kiss to Steve’s cheek, Tony made an objecting noise and promptly shoved his way between Steve and Bruce, who cowered aside.  “Tony, be nice,” Steve warned.
To Steve’s relief, the Zoo finally kicked them out around seven.  Even Juliet had a family to get home to, after all, no matter that the animals would, technically, be there all night long.
Steve frowned.  “A sparkler?” he repeated.  “Yeah, I’ve seen ‘em.  Get a lighter, get. . . .”  He snapped his fingers lazily, indicating the semi-urgent need for compliance.  Clint semi-urgently complied, leading Lucky inside the house and returning with a lighter.  “There, now we’re talkin’,” Steve murmured appreciatively.  “Let’s see some sparklers.”
“That’s not what I meant.”
“Merry BIRTH-day, dear . . . THEE,” Thor insisted, setting the cake on the table.  Steve could feel the heat from two feet away.  “Merry BIRTH-day, to THEE.”
“Where do we go from here?” Natasha asked him.
A short walk down a long hallway, he paused outside Natasha’s room, and knocked on it quietly.
Fury said, “

or I will send you right back to S.H.I.E.L.D.,” Tony warned.  He was not squeamish, but if Steve played doctor and ruined all their hard work, Tony might actually throttle him.
Sam, who had barely touched his second burger, burst out laughing.  Steve, satiated, allowed it for nearly three minutes, then kicked Sam lightly under the table.  “When it’s
Thor’s effortless strokes belied the strength of the river.  The tug below was powerful.  The shock of cold water robbed the remaining breath from his lungs.  Ascending proved difficult; staying above the water, nearly impossible.  The fast-moving current made it impossible to tread.

appeared to be an understatement.  Even from a distance, Dr. Banner’s face was bright red; his blue uniform was navy with sweat.  “I shall retrieve him,” Stovok announced.
“Sure thing, hon,” Sam said, well within earshot of their not-so-subtle entourage.
.  Here, I mean.  Say what you will, you are an old man, now.  In this century.”  Tony looked at him, but there was not a hint of mocking in his eyes, no laugh-with-me humor in his tone.  “It’s been sixty-seven
Steve just stared at him for a long moment.  Disconcertingly long.  Was he a mirage?  A dream?  “Uh,” Tony managed.  Rhodey moved away.  “Hang on,” Tony rasped at him, grasping at him loosely.  Rhodey lingered by the side of the bed, just as Steve lingered in the doorway, staring at him.
“Billiard room,” Natasha announced, laying down the card.  “You’re out.”

Grumbling under his breath, Tony shoved the vacuum back in the closet, dumped the soapy bucket in the sink, and dispatched a Roomba to siphon up the mess.
“They certainly don’t want us taking anything away from them,” Romanova mused.  Tony leaned forward a little, the better to see her.  “It’s far from the first time an alien race has tried to protect itself from outsiders.”
“You—really?” Tony asked, turning fully in his seat to frown at Steve.  “They aren’t new.”  Then, turning back to Natasha, he said, “Oh,
“Looks like one.”
Tony looked at Stovok.  Stovok looked at Carter unblinkingly.  “How?” was all he said.
Stovok remained silent, but Tony heard his answer, loud and clear.
“No,” Steve said.  He would not kill Gerald for Tony Stark’s eccentric tastes.  “Just Ginger.”

but it was so much easier to take Steve’s word.  So much easier to just let his eyes shut and sigh, “I’m betting on you.  And them.”
“That’s basic first aid,” Tony said.
“Deny your delusions and substitute them with my own?”  At Steve’s blank look, Tony shrugged and said, “Yeah, probably.  But it’s hard to break an old man’s heart.”
Tony said again, “I wanna see him.”
.”  Furiously, he retracted the Pop-Tarts.  Thor retracted his own flask, still smiling, at peace with himself.  Then, to rub it in, Thor uncapped the flask—even from across the table, Steve could smell the surprisingly warm aroma emitting from it, like a fire crackling in the hearth—and lifted it to his lips.
“Didn’t like it?” Tony said.
Steve asked, “And what will you do here?”
“They’re . . . not exactly friends of the Federation,” Hill added.
Tony had never seen a planet stripped of its crust before.  Barton voiced his thoughts: “What the hell could do

was a strong word—at best, dragon-pairs had a mutual misunderstanding.  Dragons did not appear to understand human tongues and humans certainly did not understand the wide range of super- and subsonic noises that characterized dragonspeak.  It was well-documented that more than ninety percent of all dragon chatter was completely inaudible to humans.  The linguistic bridge was limited and rudimentary; it was as if the only means of communicating were finger snaps.
“I got mucked up in the desert,” Tony murmured.  “And I never, ever got better.”  Drawing in a shallow breath, Tony went on, “I don’t think you understand.  What that’s like.  I don’t think anyone understands.”
“What,” Tony said, then snickered, before reigning himself in with a visible effort, “do you call—a masturbating bull?”
“Wanda.  The Maximoff kid.  The one who—”
“Nay,” Thor said.  He was aiding Bruce in the removal of candles, mostly by eating them.  “You have arrived.  Exactly as intended.”
It was the only dream he remembered, but it felt real.  Like a promise.
Relieved, Steve prodded, “So, why Alaska?”
“Actually, it was,” Natasha chimed in.  Something in Steve’s shoulders relaxed as he spotted her lounging on a couch by a set of floor-to-ceiling windows, looking particularly modern in a flattering white shift.  Steve looked away, taking in the view, never one to ogle.  “Although there were some

But it was not Happy.  It was Steve.
,” Tony said, following the convoluted logic easily.  The Nibirans below were making ground, so he began walking backwards, one hand on the grooved stone.  “Stovok—this planet appears fully compatible with Earth biology.”
Looking in the mirror, he saw his own beleaguered face—lines around his eyes, smudges underneath—and reached up to feel the stubble.
“Roylans,” Stovok replied, his voice still weirdly close.  “Talaxians.”
And then Steve very pointedly shut the door behind himself.
“Sea ice.  I like that.”  Watching Thor and Siku for a few calm moments, Tony finally said, “This is awkward, Juliet, but I don’t have a polar bear carrier on me.”  Juliet laughed; Tony could make anyone laugh, Steve thought, watching Siku duck back into his pool.  “Got any of those . . . neat little disposable cameras lying around?”
Nodding in agreement, Tony waved a hand and said, “You’re the boss.”
At last—at very last, when the friendly little clock said 4:01 A.M.—Steve managed to step on light footsteps to the window, peering briefly through the curtain at the luminous city.
“You okay?” Steve asked again.

, for the first time in days.  An undercurrent of trepidation dissipated.
Then he forced his fingers to release his shirt, tried to take in a breath.  It did not help.  He tried again.  The results were infuriatingly paradoxical: his chest expanded, but he did not feel the relief of a breath.  He felt only the urgency of the lie, of Everything is Fine.
And here we are! Back at it again. I still have plenty of ideas for this story and nothing but warmth and enthusiasm for it. Might be slow and steady for a while, but I do hope you enjoy and I thank you again for your tremendous support. You have been above and beyond what I have expected, and I really do hope you have been well.
Dr. Banner covered his mouth fearfully, and Tony snarled audibly at him, biting into the meat of his hand.  “You idiot,” Tony whispered.  “You could’ve been killed.”  Already hauling himself to his feet, he insisted, “C’mon, we have to—”  Whoops, excited, nearby, and accompanied by flying spears, made Tony nearly piss his uniform.  “Oh, for the love of God,” he seethed, then yelled openly as Dr. Banner made a break for it—thankfully in the right direction, but, still.  “BANNER!”

The door opened, and Tony spun in the chair, ready to deliver bad news to Happy.
Shy, sweet Bruce approached the animals without hesitation, extending one hand to pet them.  Half of them turned and walked away; the other half allowed him to proceed.  A few lowed; one chirruped.  If Bruce had trouble looking his food in the eyes, it did not show.
“That good, huh?” Steve pressed, nudging Tony’s shoulder with his own.

He remembered feeling that small, that lonely, on the Front, after Bucky’s death.  It had seemed so simple, signing up for War, ready to do what was right, even if it meant dying for his country.  Living—that was the real challenge.  Persevering.
“What does—”
Gravemarker stood up, shaking off his coat harshly.  He seemed a stranger, so removed that Tony wondered if it was not a feral dragon, slipping into his life and pretending to be the dragon he knew.  Tony had seen the feral dragons, the way they handled themselves, the way they attacked their own kin—Gravemarker was not like them.  Gravemarker put up with him, all of him, the exasperating and mean and forgetful, the kind and doting and optimistic.
“I am never too full on bread,” Thor said seriously.
The engineer blinked.  He looked young, unsupervised, and disheartened: “I’m sorry?”
“Hands-only,” Tony concurred.

Startled out of his laughing fit, Tony said, “Wait—what?”
Creaking along the old hardwood, Steve called out a second time, “Tony?”
With a shudder of revulsion, he thought about how lucky and unlucky he was, not to simply be a beating heart in a box, harvested by the glorious future.
Hulk looked at him for another moment, perhaps hoping he would break, before making an almost exasperated grunt, standing up, and sauntering around the building.
Natasha knocked on the door.  Steve saw his reflection scowl, and purposefully let go of his anger, let it be less mean.  He could be nice.  He was nice all the time, life just kicked dirt on him.
Thor did, doubling back to sweep up the tennis ball.  Bruce kept running.  Steve thought about calling out to him that the coast was clear, then shook his head.  Bruce would figure it out.
“Not even if—”
at the center was hardly more arresting.
Steve caught him by the shoulders, boiling to throttle the truth outta him, but he kept himself perfectly still, barely even gripping Tony.
“Oh, come on,” Tony wheedled, in the almost petulant tone that Steve was beginning to associate with a man used to winning people over, “we’re driving through the night, what’s the rush?”
True to Tony’s word, they left, posthaste.
Then Steve said, “Well.  It’s better than cryin’, ain’t it?”
Thor looked down at his shadow, who blinked up at him expectantly.  “Ah,” Thor said, sounding, for the first time in his life, perhaps, surprised.  Then he scooped up Vættr, who looked at him with those big black eyes, and said something in old Norse that Tony could not hope to understand.
“Unstitch.”

“Sometimes, I do, too,” Steve admitted.  “Sometimes, I can,” he offered.
Stovok said, “Look to the horizon.”
“Great.  See you soon.”
The colors faded to black and white, empty, almost blank, and Tony ripped his hand away belatedly, surprised to find the world around him, the cathedral silence in his head.  He looked around at the white trees with their red leaves, the dark earthy ground, and then back at Stovok, whose eyes had slipped shut again.
.  But he shook with anger.
“No.”
There was a prolonged silence.  Steve’s chest ached; with sympathetic pain or simple despair, he did not know.
