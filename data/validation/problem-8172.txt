“Nope, I’m serious. Come back,” Tony insisted. “I won’t stop until those two hundred and forty pounds are laying on top of me.”
When Tony emerged from the lab half an hour later, it was to the smell of cooking tomato sauce. He walked into the kitchen and was greeted with Steve plating spaghetti and meatballs. Tony was pretty sure he couldn’t even muster up toast with the ingredients in this kitchen, let alone spaghetti, so he assumed Steve had bought groceries.
Steve was squeezing his fork a little hard, so he tried to relax his grip.
In fact, pretty much everyone sat up excitedly, leaving Steve even more confused.
“Well, then. I’ll just have to keep you in check,” Steve said around a smile. “Or maybe I don’t want your restraint...” He bit his bottom lip, and Tony wanted to kiss him so badly.
He had changed into a gray henley, the buttons undone at the top to reveal his collarbone, but wore the same ripped jeans he always wore in the lab. Steve wondered if he’d ever stop feeling that heat in the pit of his stomach when he saw Tony. He hoped not.
“Tony,” Steve breathed into his ear, his name infused with so much else that Tony had to clutch one of Steve’s hands around his waist.
Tony didn’t ask him why or act disbelieving. He just tugged Steve closer and nipped his ear, before murmuring, “Well then, I am very impressed. And honored.” Steve gave an amused huff and let Tony glide his fingernails up and down his back, using his place on top of Tony to grab behind his knee and hike up his thigh around Steve’s waist. Their position made it very obvious how Steve was being affected.
But instead, Steve surprised him by simply swallowing and stepping away from him. “Have you had dinner yet?”
“Yes, JARVIS? Play it out loud.”
“I do,” Steve replied, smiling softly. “They make you look handsome. Not that you wouldn’t be without them. And not that you even have that many.” Tony was a very generous-looking forty-three.
Steve frowned at him. “That’s not what I meant-”
“What do they want?” Tony asked. Steve hesitated, but they would tell Tony soon enough. “No, let me guess,” Tony interrupted. “A weapon.” Steve frowned over at him, and Tony just nodded his head in resignation. “The bomb was in my lab, so they were targeting me,” Tony continued. “You were probably a bonus in the whole thing-- incentive for me to cooperate, no doubt.”
Steve nodded thoughtfully, glancing again at the irritated skin. “If I could give you the healing factor, I would,” Steve said honestly.
Steve was thankful that at least Tony hadn’t been able to see that particular blush.
He knew that after the Chitauri attack, when Tony had flown that missile through the portal and Steve had started to grasp just how wrong he’d been about the man, Steve had started to find Tony’s eccentric habits endearing instead of annoying. He’d started smiling at Tony’s sarcasm instead of feeling burned by it. But he couldn’t exactly pinpoint where his mind had switched from friendship to relationship.
Nick Fury, however, was a different story. Steve knew he wouldn’t have the same compunction about preserving their feelings, so Steve was determined to intercept him before he could get to Tony.
“You look tired, have you been sleeping?” Steve asked, but Tony just shrugged it off.
“Are you alright, Steve?” Nat asked, frowning at him. “You seemed quite cheery yesterday.”
When he pulled Tony into a slow and desperate kiss, it turned into the most torturously enjoyable hour of Tony’s life. At least, he thought it was an hour but it could’ve been longer or shorter, for all he was aware. He didn’t know if he’d ever yearned more for something to both end and continue forever.
“Uh, no,” Steve said, rubbing the back of his neck. He looked extremely soft and sleep-warm, and Tony wanted desperately to drag him back to bed. But it had been established that he didn’t like what came with sleep. “Did- did you sleep any more after...?”
Steve wanted to stop Tony there, but he was on a roll now.
“We don’t really need to get back into it,” Tony evaded.
Steve pulled away and glanced around for a moment until he found a chair to sit in.  He pulled it over next to the bed and collapsed backward.
Tony started rubbing his forehead in frustration. “I can’t seem to locate Kray. I’ve tried everything that usually works- tracking telephone lines, credit card transactions, traffic cameras- but he’s not showing up anywhere. And I know SHIELD is probably not telling us everything. Maybe they even know where Kray is. Maybe they even have him in custody and don’t want us to interfere. Wouldn’t surprise me at all...”
Tony huffed, and raised his eyes to look at Steve across from him. “Other than a splitting headache and a sore back from my little nap on this stone mattress, I’m great,” Tony said, grimacing as he sat up fully. “What happened?”
“Did you find Tony?” Clint asked.
“Steve, you naughty boy,” Tony gasped, acting scandalised.
“No, are you crazy?  Violet Chachki is gonna win, hands down.”
“Hey, the music didn’t wake you, did it?” Tony asked, checking that the suit’s sensors were still calibrating correctly.
“No Tony, you’re right. We’re...” Steve nodded his chin at the open air around them, but Tony wouldn’t stop tugging.
Steve’s body finally gave in and the world faded to darkness.
Tony actually looked a little embarrassed at Steve's words, like he knew it was what he would've done if Steve hadn't laid it all out in that way.
He finally opened his eyes and took in what he could of his surroundings. He was lying face down on top of Tony, who was still unconscious. There was a cut on his forehead that was bleeding slightly, which pointed to something hitting him in the head to knock him out. Steve moved his head slightly to check that there wasn’t blood coming from Tony’s ears, which there wasn’t, thank God.
Steve took a moment before responding to think about what it would be like for him, watching them torture Tony, knowing that if he gave in, Tony’s pain would stop. Steve realized he would’ve given up hours ago.
Steve sighed and leaned one elbow on the desk so he could look Tony in the eyes better. He gently took ahold of Tony’s hand covering his face and pulled it away but didn’t let it go. Tony looked at him with an exhausted expression, but his thumb dragged across Steve’s knuckles soothingly.
Steve made a vague sound of acceptance, but didn’t let himself relax.  He still had a lot of questions.
--------------------------------------
Tony glanced at Steve and motioned to the paper in his hand. “Crossword troubles?” Steve startled and unfolded the paper on the desk.
-------------------------------------------
Tony didn’t react, but Steve could see his jaw working, like he was biting back one of his usual sarcastic responses. It bothered Steve how much Tony was in denial about this. He’d never met anyone that acted so narcissistic on the outside and yet had so little concern for his own wellbeing.
They lay like that, kissing softly and talking quietly, until Tony drifted off.  Steve watched him for a while, comforted by his even breaths.
It went on like that for several more days- Tony being swept away in the early morning and not returning for hours. Steve didn’t have anything to do in that time, but a piece of rock had broken off of part of the wall, so Steve spent the hours using it to carve drawings into the stone ground. The rock would be too dull soon to even do that, though.
He’d only just dislocated Steve’s knee and almost definitely broken his left shin bone, when Kray reappeared. The last strike to his leg had pulled out a strangled shout from Steve, but it was by no means the worst pain he’d been in. He was definitely aching though, and breathing quite heavily from both the pain and the exertion of keeping his reactions in check.
The change in topic gave Tony whiplash. “Uhh, no.”
Steve sat back from the bars, watching as the man with the crooked nose from before returned, but this time with two different people. And this time, it was obvious that the man leading them was the boss. His presence exuded confidence and narcissism, and the men behind him stayed at a distance. Even if he was the boss, Steve wasn’t intimidated. He was just another man who thought he could take advantage of the defenseless, which was just another kind of cowardice.
“You’re here,” Steve said. “And only a minute after seven.”
The words caused Steve’s chest to ache as he remembered he’d said something not so different when he’d first met Tony. But he knew now that Tony’s greatest weapon was his mind. Let these men think differently. They’d figure it out soon enough.
As he plated the food, he stole glances at Tony, mostly because he couldn’t help himself. He really wanted to kiss him, but he wasn’t quite sure where they stood with each other. Tony had definitely enjoyed their earlier meeting. But they also hadn’t talked about it at all. Steve thought they needed to have that conversation before they went any further. And it seemed like Tony needed to get something off his chest too.
Tony tasted like coffee and he smelled like his cologne, and Steve hadn’t realized how much he craved the combination until that moment. His facial hair scratched against Steve’s chin, and Steve might’ve groaned a little bit at the sensation.
“No, we should stick to the plan. Leave him and take Stark,” another voice, quieter.
“Steve!” Tony’s voice was at a breaking point.
“Ali,” Tony said automatically.
Steve resolved to track Tony down tomorrow.
------------------------------------
In the spirit of clarifying things, since that’s what they seemed to be doing, “Tony, about some of the stuff you were saying earlier,” Steve said.
Steve frowned to himself. “At least, let me go first,” he insisted.
Steve sighed. “It’s...worse than they realized. DC is completely corrupted as well. And it extends all the way to the higher-ups. Fury doesn’t know who to trust. And half the time, he’s just waiting to see who’ll put out a hit on him.” Tony squeezed Steve’s hip in comfort, as Steve looked at him with ghosts in his eyes. “It’s HYDRA, Tony.”
“Hm? Oh, yeah. Great,” Steve said.
“I thought all your cars had safety codes to prevent anything like this from happening.  Isn’t Jarvis able to override or something when he thinks you’re incapable of driving?”  Steve asked.
Tony glared at the man. “You know those people that kidnapped me? They’re all dead now,” Tony said. “So you might want to rethink your whole strategy.”
Steve took a left and pulled into the hospital’s parking lot, hastily parking the car and jumping out, for once not caring if he’d parked between the lines.  Walking through the hospital doors, he immediately headed toward the elevator and pressed the button for the seventh floor.  He took a moment to think about the fact that he’d been to this hospital enough to know which floor Tony would be on.  It was kind of a sad thought.
The Captain smiled his abashed, earnest smile and walked after the woman “Thank you”
Thor released his husband, reluctantly; ignoring the pointed looks from his brother and mother, as they had felt with their last touches the happenstance of their bond. Thor could not handle pity right now, or derision.
“Shhh” Thor hushed the Captain as he pulled the chuckling man to his chest and held his ear out to the loud shuffling of the Warrior Three as they too settled down for the night while thoroughly intoxicated. Steven chuckled into the God’s neck, his warm breath ghosting over his heated skin, eliciting a sharp shiver from Thor, who groaned loudly and gripped the charming man closer still.
Gasps rose again and Thor spotted some fainting in the multitude, his grip on Mjolnir slacked and slowly, he brought his hammer down, his hopeful eyes resting on his father while the older God extended a weathered hand to rest on Loki’s pale and stunned face. Odin touched the bandages with care, his blue orb dulled with regret as a soft light sparked from his fingertips and the offending cloth fell away, leaving Loki’s face unmarked, the All Father’s holy will vanishing effortlessly his horrible deed.
“That’s Ringerike” The Captain whispered, caressing his husband lax hand with a gentling thumb “Thought it was appropriate.”
Thor glared but could not avoid his eyes from darting at the door on the other side of the room, where his Captain had disappeared in joy. “Does Steven know?”
Clint was the first to disembark, followed closely by Natasha who walked now with a strange step, a little spring to her feet and shoulders lose and relaxed. Steve shared a confused look with the Doctor and followed the pair a couple of steps behind. Outside of a dimly lit house stood a woman, beautiful in the soft light of the empty porch and pregnant stomach bulging obviously under her pajamas. She smiled wide at the sight of them and opened her arms wide to receive Clint with a tight hug.
“Wouldn’t hurt” Banner added with an uncertain smile.
He spotted the suit and lunged for it. Nat snatched it away and held it above her head. "Sit."
"Positive, kid. I'm positive."
"What about your mom, huh? She can't be marrying her shitty ex too."
Peter grinned cheekily as he adjusted his microphone. "I took gymnastics."
"Leave now or I'm getting my suit."
Peter's mind started closing in on itself. It felt like his throat was closing in. He coughed hard, trying to get oxygen in. He gripped onto the couch.
Clint smiled sadly, kissing her hair. "Yeah, sweetheart. I'm here."
"Oh, I haven't seen anything. I'm so sorry-"
"MJ!"
"F-For being a freak."
Cooper.
Clint hasn't been this happy since he had his kids ripped from him. He hugged his, well, technically small doesn't describe his 6'1" son, but no matter what, he'll still be a ten year old child in his eyes. Lila was curled into his other side, nuzzling into his ribs, which was honestly very uncomfortable, but Clint couldn't ask anything more.
tony makes a promise he intends to keep and meets some important teens
"Not when there's people willing to kill him for Tony's attention!"
"We are simple children with simple needs, Corneal," MJ replied, smirking.
"Hell, she even made Buck’s arm. We both really trust her, Pete."
Clint smiled. "You feeling any better?"
"Su-"
That was the first thing that got Peter out of bed in two weeks.
Tony was leaning against his car across the street from Midtown School of Science and Technology, looking for the short brunette boy. Suddenly, three teens popped out of the crowd, a mixed girl smirking at the two boys, a short Filipino boy, and the exact small brunette he was looking for.
The bell rung and MJ took the chance to rush off as Ned said, "See you in calc."
"Peter?"
That morning, Steve was freaking out. Tony wasn't in his lab, so Steve had no clue where he could be. Tasha had to literally grab him by the shoulders and explain that Tony had went to sleep in the living room couch, which let Steve take a deep breath.
"Karen?"
Cooper laughed a cold, joyless laugh. "That's what I thought too."
Tony glanced at the clock. "Okay, fine. We're not done, though, after school, you come straight home, alright."
"Oh, yes! Sorry."
"So- uh- are you in Mrs. Jamerson's homeroom!"
"Not much, geek."
He took a deep breath in. Everything is okay when he was in his stupid little outfit. He hopped off the building to look for trouble. But in a helpful way.
"I didn't cheat on your mom."
Her footsteps are approaching the door.
"So, just to clarify, that
"Dad. Dad. Father. Where's the kitchen. I'm very hungry. And I can't find Peter."
"Yes, sir."
"May I have a drink?"
"Talk to you later, kiddo." Tony ruffled the teen's hair.
clint wants his kids back
"What?"
When he turned around from the window, what he absolutely wasn't expecting to do is to see the tiny kid from about three days ago. "M-Mr. America? Are you okay?"
Tony squeezed his eyes shut. "I can't believe I still love you so much."
"For you to stop wasting all our coffee, first of all-"
"K-Karen?"
"Hey, Stevie," Tony called, walking out of the kitchen, "walk with me."
"Man," Peter mumbled.
"Sorry, Mr. St-Dad," Peter whimpered, cowering down. Yelling? Not his thing.
"Hey, Shuri," Peter started as she tinkered away at his shoulder, the cold metal connecting up to his collarbone, "my friends are coming over soon, wanna hang out with us?"
"'Sup, Michelle and Nedward?"
"You- You do know your dad will kill you once he finds out!" she fussed, hands on her hips.
"It's okay, kid." Tony patted his back gently. He tried to force out a smile which Peter returned. "What's your name?"
Tony, unable to form coherent thoughts after anxiety spikes unless it was his deepest, darkest fears, just blurted out, "I'm going to ruin Peter's life. I'm so not ready for a kid and I'm going to mess him up."
Peter choked out another sob, this one thankfully mixed with a laugh. "Sorry, Dad."
He still wasn't sure what happened between his son, daughter, and his ex, but he knew it wasn't anything good. Peter told him he'd explain once Cooper calmed down more. Clint thinks he's actually going to fight his ex.
"Yeah, I know. You sent me a text. One, singular text at three o'clock! But wait, what time is it again, F.R.I.D.A.Y.?"
Then, suddenly a whole new family dropped from the sky. His (at first, reluctant) father was Tony Stark and his aunts and uncles were the avengers.
Nat was a good friend. She always defended him. She almost got him custody of his kids.
Peter opened his eyes slightly, frowning at him. "You're still up, Coop?"
"No, you can stay. Sit," Tony smiled at him as Peter sat. "So, your mom was Mary Parker?"
appeared on screen and Tony began pretending to swing around Thor's hammer, which made Ellen scream out "Thor!" This kept happening until Tony mimed not being able to pick up the weapon, making her guess immediately.
They played Jenga and no one decided to play other than Peter, Bruce, Tony, Thor, and Clint, who were all way too competitive. Except for Thor, he was just happy to be involved. Clint knocked down the tower when he went to pull out his bow and Tony smacked him on the back of his head.
Cooper gave his hand one last squeeze before letting go. "You got this, Petey."
"Pete-"
Peter tried his best to, but couldn't. The yelling was too much. Help him. Help him.
Cooper sat behind MJ, next to Peter.
Peter held the small button to manually turn off Karen. Mandy walked in holding another drink.
"Yeah. Everyone seems nice. I'm just kinda awkward around new people. Anxiety and stuff."
"Pete!"
"Stapleton. Call me Jen. Come on in."
Please, Ned, please come soon.
(See the end of the chapter for
"It's... it's our code in case either one of us get... well... kidnapped."
The door opened and Peter rushed out. "Daaaad! Me and my friends are taking over the living room!"
"Oh, god dammit, I'm sorry, Peter, I fucked up your night-"
"And how long is that from 15:00?"
" Tony screamed in his face before closing the lab's glass door. Through the glass he heard, "F.R.I.D.A.Y., put the lab on lockdown."
"I-I-I'm s-s-sorry-"
"Barton!"
"Shh, my dear. Now, let's go."
"Yeah, you're right. I'm Captain America! I got this!"
Sam wrapped an arm around Steve. "It's gonna be okay, Steve."
"So, we'll be playing two rounds, one, I'll be guessing and Tony will be giving me clues, then Peter will be giving me clues! So, Tony, you ready?" Ellen had a shit-eating grin as she was handed an iPad.
Peter Benjamin Parker was never normal. Ever since the day he was born with two X chromosomes, yet still felt like a boy, he was abnormal. Then when he was thirteen and bitten by that stupid radioactive spider. Then he had to come out a school, which was unbearable because of an asshole nicknamed 'Flash.' Said asshole placing the name 'Penis Parker' upon Peter. At least there was one thing some of the kids wouldn't touch with a ten foot poll. His late mother and uncle. But his deadbeat, run-away dad and disgusting sexual comments towards his amazing Aunt May. At least he still has some friends, Ned and MJ.
"Captain America keeps staring at me."
MJ shifted uncomfortably. "Fine."
"Don't you walk away, Stark!"
"Uh... hi, dad?"
protective tony tries to cheer up his son
"My- my own kids think I'm a scumbag! Because of- just because my wife-"
Peter raised his left-his only-hand to cup the back of Tony's head. He let a few more years slip from his eyes, onto his dad's tee shirt. He fully wrapped his arm around his neck and sobbed into his shoulder.
Peter opened up the door, hair ruffled up, eyes a bright red. He was obviously not wearing his binder, though it was mostly covered by his baggy sweatshirt. Before Tony could say anything, Peter squeaked out, "I'm sorry."
, if you were wondering), Steve's email was already pulled up. He knows he shouldn't snoop, or even care, but... can you blame him? Yes? Okay, fair.
"F.R.I.D.A.Y., where's Mr. Stark?"
He's watching Tony crumble before his eyes. Cooper, who seems like such an energetic young man, has become increasingly closed off, only speaking to his nuclear family.
MJ blew air out her nose. Peter noticed her clenching her fists and whispered, "Don't."
"And... why did you say all that shit to me when you stormed out?"
"No, listen to me for once, Stark-"
Clint listened intently to the young adult, pure shock on his face.
Nat shrugged. "Apparently the mom never told him about Peter."
He was about to open their bedroom when Tony yelled back, "Ex-fucking-cuse me?"
"Agreed. Steve, get into civilian clothes. You all stay in your coms in case of emergency."
Coming next Saturday:
"What? He? Why would you cheat on mom with a dude, you're straight!"
Bucky smiled, wrapping an arm around his waist. "Boyfriend, actually. Nice to meet you, Laura. See you on the floor."
Tony took a sharp breath in. "Kid, send the cords to Fri, Steve-"
Nat scooted over to let Steve sit down. "What's up, Barton?"
Sorry I’ve been gone so long, I just got surgery lol
In all honestly, they were all having a lovely time... well, at least until after dinner.
Peter was staring at the floor.
easy. He just put his hands on his hips and yelled, "PATRIOTISM!" and Ellen immediately responded, "Captain America!"
"She's not dead! She can't be!" Peter started sobbing. "She's all I have!"
Still not letting go of Peter's hand, Cooper stood up, frankly towering over Clint. "I said stay the fuck away from me."
Honestly, that went better than he thought.
"If you'll please move, I'll be going to meet my friend
"So, Pete. Some of the guys are a little intimidating, okay? So, you can go ahead and choose the games, alright? And tell me if you feel uncomfortable, it's okay if you want to leave."
"Well, Peter, wanna play a game you may be better at?" the woman smiled. Peter's eyes lit up.
Tony always has trouble working when he knows he's a complete douchebag. He was struggling to not show feelings, but he had to apologize to Peter. He wasn't his dad, it wasn't his place to force himself into Peter's life. He needed to let Peter know he did want him in his life at the very least. So after Bruce and him had finished some experiments and Bruce was going to get them both entire kettles of coffee, Clint style, he asked Bruce to send Peter down.
"It's the thing I am, Thor," Bruce whispered. Peter perked up at this. The Bruce Banner was a freaking trans guy?
Currently, he was curled up in his side at two am, both of them unable to sleep from nightmares. Clint had made them both hot chocolate, Peter barely keeping Clint from chugging a pot of coffee. Clint's hand was absentmindedly running his fingers through Peter's hair as they watched the rerun of the stupid gossip show on early that night. Both of the boys, though they were trying to keep their drooping eyelids open, were frankly falling asleep
"Thanks, I try!"
And that brought to the first email Tony read, the emails continuously being written where Steve is mainly defending Tony. Tony's breathing became heavier as he continued reading before he came to the end of the chain where Steve just stopped replying, the last email from the day where Tony kicked him out. He forced himself to close the laptop and hide it and the sketch book under the bed. He stood and almost ran to the kitchen to wait for Peter to come home and work on a new project. Maybe Steve did love him.
He should be dead.
"Where the hell were you?"
"Yeah. Just... tell Pete he's allowed to have people over, I'm going to go punch shit downstairs."
Peter nodded quickly. "D-Do you mind leaving so I can get dressed-?"
"Pete?" Tony looked up at his worried son, trying to wipe away the still extremely obvious tear marks. "Whatcha need, kiddo?"
"Cooper. Cooper!"
and he faked putting on an Ironman suit. When that didn't work, he then tried pulling on Captain America's suit, which made her get it.
"Sorry, sir."
Peter's room was... surprisingly clean for a kid. A few posters were haphazardly set up on the walls, displaying Star Trek, Star Wars, and even the Avengers. Natasha smiled softly at the poster of her and Clint hanging next to his wardrobe.
Steve grinned at Natasha, completely unrepentant. “I have a few calls to make, I’d like to check in on Tony and Thor”
Thor frowned but settled again on the floor “I fear I see not what happens in the kingdom, I do not know Asgard as well as I thought…” Thor pursed his lips to a thin, frustrated line. Even Loki in the depths of Asgards dungeons had caught wind of the Captain’s charms. Word was truly a dangerous weapon.
“No Cap, don’t do it, have mercy!”
?” Thor growled in disbelieve.
Lonely.
Disclaimer: I own nothing
“What? No! it’s not like that, its…” The Captain weaved an agitated hand through his blond locks, meeting the other man’s soulful gaze and shrinking with a troubled sigh “God, I don’t even know what it is. He is my friend, after the ice, he was the only one who kept my head up water.” Steven explained, his voice soft and tight “Everywhere I went, I found myself thinking: I better call to check in, or; hey, I should send this over, he’ll get a kick out of this, he… he was
Thor nodded once, his resentment on Steven’s behalf still fresh. Master Bragi bulled his hand away and met his eyes in a very pointed gaze. “This is your mistake, and how will you pay for it?”
And now, he had it. He had in his hands the universal rights to the man he adored, and he couldn’t feel more sick to his stomach.
“You are so vulgar.” Drax mused incredulously as they were surrounded by Asgardian forces.
Thor fidgeted in place.
“I trust you will have the honor and wisdom I have lacked. To serve my people fairly and impart justice where I have only dealt pain… I leave my son’s fate in your worthy hands.”
“I have spent my days in Asgard mingling with the crowds and word of the Captain is getting hotter by the minute. So you would understand that while business deals are made, there will always be other contenders to take interest”
“Hydra?” Steven startled, his slumped back straightening in alarm and eyeing the silent Director with a searching glance.
Thor cut his chain of thought quickly, shaking his head and walking around the common room in search of someone to distract him from his dangerous thoughts. He found Barton and Romanoff leaning on the bar, drinking and conversing quietly to each other, heads drawn together over their joined hands. He was remiss to disturb them when in such deep intimacy, but was caught by a sideways glance from the Black Widow, who beckoned him closer with a smile and a salacious wink.
“Goodnight, Tony, Pepper” Steven said with a withbearing fondness.
That night Thor and Steven stumbled into their tent sharing deep, needy kisses; both giggling around their lips as they tripped onto their beddings with a cry.
“Argh!” Thor groused in disgust, his feet kicking on the dirt floor where he laid in dismay, prompting a hearty laugh from his Betrothed, now thankfully calm and at ease. Thor laid on the ground in protest, his actions silly while his mind swam with dark thoughts and steely resolution…
And the Soldier turned to the large, imposing bed and scurried around it to the nightstand.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve smiled his earnest, wholesome smile and tucked the device away only to pull another, smaller and more elegant communicator “Then I would like you to have this…” The Director took the gift with curious hands, eyeing it intently before pocketing it in his long trench-coat as he met the Captain’s pointed, serious gaze “Wherever you are, for whatever reason. Call me, I’ll be there.”
So when the day finally came and he stood next to the jubilant Captain by the Bifrost gates, he was more than eager to see his Shield brothers and sister. To rejoice in the camaraderie and the security of the mightiest heroes to protect his betrothed. Not that he would ever tell Steven this, as he would probably get his shins kicked for the offense; and his balls too, just to rest his case.
Tony Stark had a crush on Steve Rogers.
Thor released a peaceful breath, pressing a kiss to the back of the knuckles adorning the Captain’s ringed finger, twin to his own, in private devotion; unwilling to ever part from this innocent but so comforting embrace unless of course, he could obtain something much better.
The Captain blinked, that empty, faraway look ghosting over his clear blue eyes again.
“Father?” Thor called; his voice tentative as it had not been since he was a child. He cleared his throat as he entered the antechamber, spotting his Father sitting by the high windows. He had a sense of déjà vu as he regarded Odin smile at him, beckoning him further into the rooms with a wave of his hand.
Thor frowned his confusion “What is this Stag Party you speak of?”
“Aye, and since then, Frandal and I meet every decade and I beat him to a bloody pulp.” Thor swallowed thickly, turning to give a shaky smile to the horrified Captain in a weak attempt to lighten the mood “We have made it a tradition at this point.”
And now all of Asgard would pay for her sins.
Tony clenched his fists in the air, convulsing shut as he fought the will to again, scream and scream and never stop.
Thor released a long childish wail as Steven strutted forward to the basket he had procured with him and began to set their lunch for the afternoon. “Would you like to join us, General?”
The All Father cupped Thor’s face with an Iron hand, holding him in place, into submission. “This conflict with Midgard will not end in war”
Frigga plots, Thor is in love, Steve joins Asgards Council and they share a trip and heartbreak.
“Actually” Fury countered “I would prefer to begin negotiations as soon as possible, preferably before any wedding preparations begin”
“By what?”
“Mother?” Thor groused softly, voice rumbling in his chest as he tried to keep from awakening the Captain.
As Steve entered his rooms, he took a deep breath and barely managed to close the door behind him before he began to rip off the ridiculous cape from his back in harsh tugs. Wincing in shame as he heard hissing rips of the fine fabric under his ruthless hands.
He toured the Continent in an almost dreamlike state, rain followed him wherever he went, and in some places he stayed for longer than he absolutely needed. Millions set their hands on Mjolnir, none could lift it. Thor moved on to the next Continent.
And then the moment passed. Odin blinked first. He turned to his wife and nodded tiredly.
“I don’t know” The Captain sighed blinking his sweet eyes open and smiled crookedly down at his husband “It’s hard to remain unbiased with him when all I keep thinking is he’s going to plop me over his lap and give me a spanking for talking back to my elders”
He wisely doesn't mention JARVIS, who's still strapped snugly around his wrist. As much as he'd like to show the AI off, he knows it'd probably be a bad idea.
"It's the way you look at him," his best friend said simply.  "And the way you talk to him, or about him.  Even if
Thor grinned at the slight wince of the Captain, nuzzling blissfully the smooth cheek as he corrected with a low whisper “That Good.”
Steve took the elevator to the roof, where the rest of the Avengers, minus Tony, waited for him. Director Fury and Maria Hill stood to the side, equal blank faces as they watched him approach. Crisp uniform, Shield slung at his back and Mjolnir strung on his belt at his side.
Tony thought, he had called the payphone outside his hotel, no voicemail, no missed calls alerts, then
Loki heaved a deep sigh of contentment as he stood outside of his cell, eyes meeting with the prisoner to the left, the giant dark elf, his dark eyes looking on in silent approval and a wide grin took over the mirror visage of the Crown Prince. His large palm extending to the controls as he unlocked and released the guarding cells.
“Gamora used to work with him!” He called, softly shifting forward and trying to call the Guardian’s attention to himself “knows all the ins and outs of his army.”
Disclaimer: I own nothing.
“And he possesses the power stone.” Heimdall continued, sword still and deadly on the warrior’s throat.
“Odin said-“
“Yes, he hails from Brooklyn.” Thor said in ways of an explanation, still grinning widely. “Vicious, blood thirsty sort”
“My Steven is very talented” Thor boosted proudly at his old Master, who remained unmoved by his vehement claims.
------
“Hey Stark, put on the suit and give it a go”
Thor blinked as a sinking feeling began to settle in his loins “What?”
“Why?” The Director asked sharply at the woman, the only sensible one of the group it appeared as the other human mimed to her to shut up in anxious fits.
The All Father watched him; his eye intense in his scrutiny.
Thor struggled more desperately as he observed the Captain’s cheeks hollow in around his digit, right down to the third knuckle, releasing it with an obscene pop, shinny and wet with spit. Which he slowly approached to the God’s ear.
He knew, even with all the assurances of all around him, that this was coming and he could feel it, as surely as he felt the vibration of his shield under his hands, he knew that Asgard was not to be played, or stalled, they would stop at nothing to take what they perceived theirs, if Thor and Loki were any indication of what their people were like. They would not take kindly to rejection, not from the humans, a race they believed so bellow them that the thought of being denied by them was not only beyond laughable, but mortally offensive.
“ha, ha, Thor…” Steven’s eyes widened in shock as the God gazed on, serious as death “really? That bad?”
To stake his claim.
“I don’t know this dance.” Thor scrambled to excuse, as he let himself be swooned by the smiling Captain.
Steve was worth a fight and then some. He was worth everything.
The first rays of Asgards sun broke Thor’s restful sleep with a gentle caress. The God smiled to himself, eyes closed and relishing the warmth tingling in the bare skin of his torso. His body sated and loose with last night’s exertions, humming still in orgasmic bliss.
That is how he came to discover a very interesting proclivity of his own.
“Yes, I…” Sif started, her voice wavering and breaking for a vulnerable second before she regained her composure and declared firmly “It is no fault of Thor, much less yours.”
Loki swallowed thickly, lips pursed in silence and nodded.
anything…”
that” And the Archer stepped back under the stern frown of the Captain with a childish giggle.
The rainbow colored flash of the Bifrost hid Thor’s less than princely grin, though he was sure, that for a single blink of a moment, his father’s lips had curved in return.
Thor gripped the Soldier’s hands, holding them onto himself, letting the man feel what he provoked on the God. Those lovely, artist hands cupping Thor’s aching cock as the God dipped his head down and prayed “Say yes”
Steve tried anyways, feeling like a child wishing on a shooting star, a beggar tossing his last penny down to a wishing well.
This retreat had done wonders for the man’s peace of mind. Going as far as being able to joke about the Other Guy in more than one occasion. As Lila had asked him if he could turn into the Hulk to play, both children regarding him with dubious eyes.
Steve saluted them and they were dismissed, leaving with an awestruck look in their young faces as they marched to join their troops. Steve took a deep breath and turned to his friends, with a quivering smile.
“Please, Pepper”
Tony bit his lips to smoother a moan; some of it must have escaped because the Captain laughed and finished pinning the last of the medals on; picked a military white hat from the couch and spun it in nervous hands.
Steve glared furiously and lunged forward, his sword meeting the Thing’s with a deafening metallic clash, Steve pushed with all his strength at the hold, slow but surely pushing the monster back and away from the entrance.
And he left their chambers with a docile click of the door.
“A house?” Steven gasped, eyes scrambling over the pages and up to Thor in such a hopeful, vulnerable gaze Thor felt his heart break once more “Our… House?”
the shower wall, kissing her wet back all over, gently spreading her cheeks to reveal the tight little hole that lay in between. He struggled to keep his mind in the present and not let it wander as he prepared her gently, with soft presses of his fingers in her warm, silky walls.
Dream of better things… of the pitter patter of tiny, tiny feet.
(There will be some smut in this chapter, I have indicated with dark bold letters the start and end of the scene if anyone would like to skip it, if not, enjoy)
“You will not regret this in the morning?” Thor questioned, voice frail as he had never allowed himself to be “You will not regret us?”
Thor had never seen his brother cry so bitterly, not even in his willful childhood had he shed miserable tears as that day. Thor’s own heart broke to remember his brother’s heartache.
Loki coughed a rough chuckle at the insolent man. “Idunn apples… sacred fruit” He gasped for air “Magic… properties”
This is mostly a gap chapter, certainly not my best of favorite but necessary to fill in some blanks and sort of lay down some ground around the relationships in this story. Next chapter some ThunderShield to come, I promise. Please remember that this a very slow built story.
This wasn’t how it was supposed to be like, for Tony to call Steve ‘mine’, he hadn’t meant for literal legal ownership. For fucks sake it even had a receipt sighed by Ronald Fucking Reagan.
That afternoon, barely a day after the Avenger’s departure, Steven had to say his goodbyes once more. Thor followed the Captain’s step as he approached the strange leader of the group with that winning, kind smile that could command armies and make seasoned warriors bend the knee.
Steve released the link, then noting with a spot of alarm that the knot had not been untied, only grown. He extended his will again to unleash it when the chain retracted swiftly from his hold.
Steven was bent at the waist, massaging a thick hand to his spasming thigh and eyeing Thor in reproach. “That hurt”
He heard some loud shuffling from within the camper, a series of muffled shouts and seconds later, the tin door flew open with a resounding smack, leaving a wide eyed, petite woman in its place.
Days after the incident with the Idunn apple, Steven had not only recuperated; he had flourished. Taking his role in court as the Crown Prince’s consort, his steely fortitude and righteousness had resurged with a vengeance, having now a purpose and a responsibility to settle the matters of state and war. The Captain was a force not to be reckoned with in the Council Rooms.
The Captain turned his blue gaze towards the God, a frightening emptiness to those darling orbs freezing Thor in his spot by the open doors.
The realization came with a shock, the truth she held burning on the tip of her tongue and just as she quaked under the weight of it, the escape it would give her; Loki pulled her away gently, embracing her around the waist and meeting her eyes in the mirror with a pointed, pleading gaze.
Hey, sorry for the late update! I hope you guys enjoy this chapter, the fighting scenes are always so hard for me to write. I hope it isn't to akward. Next up, Steve says goodbye and enters Asgard.
He flew over oceans with his heart in his throat and the harrowing feeling that he had failed, himself, the world and Steve. God, how was he going to protect him now?
The Captain’s lovely cheeks darkened with the memory of their lovemaking, bending at the waist to press a chaste kiss to his husband’s lips, his soft tongue darting out shyly, as if seeking to catch the ghost of their shared taste.
“Mother?” Thor husked out, eyes bulging at the state of the Mother of Gods as her beautiful blue eyes jumped from one newlywed to the other.
Peter scampered over to the entrance, trying to greet the producer but being ignored.
"Be careful, you fucking nerd."
"Isn't that the direction of your apartment?"
"I'm not a douchebag!"
"Of course I can, come on. Let's get you to bed."
"Oh shit."
"Ok. Proud of you, kiddo."
"You pushed me to this point!"
That asshole. That fucking asshole. He slung his backpack over his shoulder and hit the button on the elevator multiple times. He wiped a few tears from his eyes.
"Wait one sec, let me get you a notepad to write on."
"I'm your son!" Peter suddenly shouted out, clutching the backpack straps tightly in his whitened knuckled.
Bucky scoffed, drawing Laura's attention to him.
"One."
"If Bucky wouldn't 'do this to you,' why don't you just go fuck him like I always thought you would!"
"I'm not-"
"Hey!" Peter snapped, but Clint just said, "It's stupid gossip, Petester. Don't let it bother you."
Peter knew he had a black eye. He could feel it aching and slowly start to swell. When he refused to drink the water, Mandy slammed her fist into his eye. There was a cut at the corner of his eye because of her ring. Since it hasn't closed up yet, he's beginning to think that his super-healing was being slowed by either the drugs or the little food.
Clint fucked up. Clint really fucked up. Tony is going to murder him. "I-I went to check up on him 'round midnight last night."
That asshole.
Peter and Shuri clicked instantly. Peter asked her if she could make his hand sticky since he was Spider-Man. After fan girling for a second, she agreed to.
"Yeah, what's it to you?"
In the morning, Tony was more than worried when he saw Clint in Peter's room, since that only meant one thing, it made Tony sick. Peter must have had a nightmare. And he didn't come to Tony. That's why he was urgently whisking waffles, Steve trying to calm him down.
"MJ, chill out, he doesn't need to get his heart-"
"Hey, it's okay, Peter. We're all scared of something." Bruce smiled softly. "And if you're embarrassed by your panic attack, don't be. Both I and your dad also get them."
"I don't know. I left once I realized they were talking."
"Slightly. No offense Ned, but it's somewhat better now that I'm actually living with someone who's in my family."
"I-I can't fucking believe this, I gotta find Peter-"
The lab door creaked open. "Tony? You okay down here?"
"What game are we going to be playing, Mrs. Ellen?!"
"My kids hate me. And I don't know why."
He did it.
Ned shrugged casually. "I'm better at Mortal Kombat. And Lego Games."
"Do you actually consider me your boyfriend, Buck?"
His little sister grinned, "Hey, Peter!"
"Peter, come here kiddo!"
Then one day later, the lawyer gave Peter both his mom's will and his aunt's will.
"M-My last living relative died two weeks ago in that apartment fire in Queens," Peter whispered, staring at his hands. "Hell, I almost did too."
"Fuck," Peter wheezed, throwing himself out of bed. Using the wall to support himself, he stumbled to the bathroom (not before seeing Clint naked and sleeping by accident, which will now be forever burned into his brain). He tugged off his shirt to see his binder pressing into his rib cage. "Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck!"
He hopes someone comes back for him soon.
"Nothing! I just had a good day."
No, that's Cooper's name for him, she can't use it.
about everything I do in my romantic life!"
Peter soon stood up to start dancing.
It took Peter only 45 minutes to get to school instead of his usual hour. Maybe he just really wanted to avoid Captain Annoying (Nice one, Peter).
Cooper noticeably tensed up at the last name Barton, but no one payed attention.
So, Peter basically fell asleep at the lunch table until Cooper poked him in the side followed by MJ throwing ice cubes at him.
"No."
He could see the frown on the girl's face.
Steve's grin stretched across his face. "Yeah, buddy. Go back to sleep. He'll be here in the morning."
Tony's heart is going seventy miles an hour, which considering its condition, is probably way to fast.
"Peter Benjamin! Contrary to your belief, I can take care of myself and make my own decisions."
"We're all only childs," MJ commented. "Pete's always been obsessed with having a little sibling."
Cooper flushed red. He set him down and coughed on embarrassment. "Fine."
"Yeah, I kinda do it almost every day."
littered in. He tapped on one named
"Your little sister's nice."
"If you weren't hurt, I'd punch the shit out of you right now," she threatened, a worried expression still plastered on her face. "You're an idiot, Parker!"
The brunette winked cheekily and lead Clint and Cooper away. That was the first time either of them put titles on their relationship.
Ellen grinned as a crew member handed her a piece of paper.
"I'll go find her, you just sit down."
"How does it feel to lose to an old man, MJ- why are you smirking?"
"Go away, Cooper. You suck."
Ned sighed. "Too many, Miss Widow. He's kind of a a mess."
Peter rolled his eyes, still smiling through, ears turning pink.
"Okay, little miss rich girl. Daddy pay for your spot on the squad too?"
Tony smiled, making Steve's heart seize again. "Pete, Steve's staying at the tower again."
"Fine,
"Okay, thanks, Fri! Tell them to come say hi!"
"Clint, go sit down. Peter, get up here."
Has Peter ever mentioned how much he loves Clint?
It truly reminded Tony of himself. And that absolutely terrified him.
"Clint!"
"My dad's on his way to pick us up, Cooper. Come on, let's get you packed up. Maybe your mom just has to process."
"He got back with his stupid exboyfriend."
"Nine. Hours. Peter. And nothing more than a text telling me you're okay!"
He felt like he was screaming his throat raw. He couldn't even open his eyes.
The oven beeped quietly and Bucky rushed over, just grabbing it with his metal arm, but Steve still snapped, "Be careful, Buck!"
Steve was fiddling with his suitcase strap, chewing his lip roughly.
"Hey, hey, it's okay, Pete."
are you doing here?!"
"Yeah!"
looks. How could he even begin to believe he'd be good enough for Peter?
Clint took a deep breath in. "I'm sorry."
Cooper huffed, zipping up his bag. "Go away, Lila."
"Bullshit!"
"I'm here to talk to him like civil people, alright? I need to talk to him about something very important."
He basically tackled hugged her, almost knocking her over.
"Yes it is."
Steve was going to make Peter like him if it's the last thing he ever does. He hasn't been able to talk to Tony yet, and that conversation has been chipping away at the edges of his sanity. But, like a good captain, he has a plan.
"Steve- STEVE! What in hell are you doing?"
"Y-You're Tony Stark."
Is she dragging the food?
"Let's see what the DNA test says first." Tony wasn't sure if this kid was his son, but if he was, Tony wouldn't be surprised. He was bound to have a kid with all the one night stands he's had as a young adult. He grinned softly at the kid.
"Clint's struggling with something and we're trying to help him out."
"Lila! One, watch your fucking language-"
"Karen must be offline. I don't see her."
"My house. And if Rhodey didn't like your best friend so much, you'd be kicked out in an instant. Now, fuck off."
"Two."
"How is it living with the Avengers? Are they anything like the media portrays them to be?"
Steve took everything bad he's ever said about his friends, they're absolutely amazing.
Peter shuffled down the stairs to his dad's lab, planning out what to say. He had a feeling Tony wouldn't like his black eye. He took one more deep breath before knocking on the glass door.
"Hello, Peter. It seems like some of my systems are not operating correctly."
Peter set his bag on the chair he was sitting in and decided to explore. He crept up the stairs and looked around the base. He smiled, imagining what it would be like to live as a superhero in their base. He could be his better half, Spider-Man, in front of all of his inspirations. He'd be all like 'Hey guys, what's up? It's me, Spider-Man' and they'd be like 'Hey Spider-Man! How was saving the world?' No talk about school or bullies or grades, just awesomeness. At least in Peter's eyes.
'Breathe in four, hold seven, and breathe out eight, ok?'
Peter heard Mandy's steps coming down the stairs, and if she catches him talking to anyone, he's scared of what would happen.
The next one was
"Please?"
Steve's eyes shot up to the duo when he heard this. "Tony? Can I talk to you?
Tears started to gather at the corners of Cooper's eyes, pulling his little sister into a hug.
"Y-yeah. That sounds nice."
2) I've been trying to spend more time with my family
As they ate, they swapped stories, Peter starting to open up and share his stories (just as Clint planned, and he thought that he should definitely be Peter's Godfather now). Sam eventually wondered into the kitchen and started baking, as he does when he's stressed, mumbling about his two 'idiotic fucking best friends.' Clint and Natasha filled Peter in on who's dating whom, and who used to date whom (literally none except Tony and Steve). Peter was actually quite surprised that Sam didn't stand up for Steve. In fact, he said Steve was an idiot, a very, very stupid idiot.
"You need to chill out a little, Stevie."
peter is scared and clint is great uncle
"You thinking about hot girl Liz again?" MJ smirked, eyes flittering with mischief.
"I'm pretty sure he had a nightmare and then he didn't come to me. He's mad at me, right?"
"I didn't kiss her!" Steve suddenly snapped, face flushing red. "All I did was fucking flirt! She kissed me!"
"No, listen to me. There's nothing to apologize for, okay? I know you've been having a really tough time recently, so how about we have a game night? Everyone in the tower. And we can introduce you to everyone! I'll even make Bruce get Thor over here. How does that sound?"
"No, Tony, it's fine." Steve grinned at the teen and held out his hand. "I hope we can be friends."
Tony was mad. No, he was absolutely livid. How the hell could
Peter smiled wider. "Thank you."
Peter signed. Having MJ meet Tony Stark would be... problematic to say the very least. She already didn't like Peter's dad for never being there for him, but she really hated Tony Stark. She didn't like him because he was the one who created the weapons that killed her uncle, he created Ultron and that battle almost killed her mom, who was in Sokovia to help with the locals, he had countless acts of reckless behavior, and he's 'just a douche with way too much money' according to her. Though her meeting Tony Stark may end up with MJ socking him in the jaw, but maybe all that anger will drain out of her when she sees Black Widow (who she 100% has a crush on, despite her disputes). Maybe she'll cuss him out. Maybe she'll accept him.
"Morning, is Peter up?" Cooper asked excitedly.
As Tony and Clint bickered, the other Avengers came down to gather in the living room. In all, Natasha was sat next to Peter, followed by Rhodey, Sam, and Thor, who had pulled Bruce into his lap. And even Steve was sitting on the floor next to the couch.
"Uh, I'm fifteen, I go to Midtown Tech, I have two friends, and that's really it about me."
"You don't get it!" Steve yelled, fists shaking as he gripped onto a shirt. "He doesn't want me here! I mess- no, I fucked up! Tony doesn't want me here, he isn't taking me back anytime soon, and I'm just torturing myself by being near him constantly! I-"
"No, no wa-"
"Alright! Be safe!"
sorry this is late!!!
"Second, there's much better ways to ask if I'm dating someone. And the answer's no."
"That's the point, it was a surprise." Tony smiled and ruffled his hair. "Get in the car and introduce me to your friends, alright?"
"Your recent kissing records say other wise, blondie."
"Oh, hey, kid I threatened!"
sorry this is late <3
Peter flipped on the TV, switching it to the switch. Ned flopped onto the couch next to MJ. Cooper strategically sat next to Peter. He tossed everyone a controller.
"What?"
Clint smirked. "Nat can kiss my ass."
"Peter-"  Ned tried to start, but Peter already stormed away.
"Sh, I know, buddy, I know."  He hugged him tightly. "The-The poison kicked in too quickly, they- they couldn't."
"We can fix you!"
"Steve, what in- do you even have a place? Why are you doing this?"
About three hours and half a robotic arm later, another knock rang on the door.
He swung through the rooftops, loudly laughing and whooping. When he was Spiderman, he was free from all the reality of his bad life. No need to think about school or gender or family, just the people who needed saving. He grunted softly as he landed on a nearby building. He sat on the edge and let his legs limply dangle.
"I-I what? She told my kids I cheated on her? With who? Fucking... Nat?"
"It's fine, Pete, don't worry."
"Well, I have his last known coordinates 'cause of code Bucky Barnes-"
make sure you've read all of chapter 16!
"Positive." Peter forced a smile and Clint returned one just as strained. He pressed a kiss to the kid's head. "I'm proud of you"
Peter grinned. He looked over at his dad, standing next to him. He lifted his hand to touch his father's face.
"Hey, Steve. I'm really happy you took up my offer." Tony grinned, charm radiating off of him as he gave Steve a hug. What the everloving heck is happening? "Hey, can we talk? Like, in private?"
Oh, shit, this was a reply from an email chain.
"Yeah. He's coming as emotional support," Clint grinned.
"No, you're acting irrational! Keeping your douchebag ex here, just to hurt you more?"
When Steve saw the moving trucks outside of the tower, he started crying. Was he being kicked out? Was Tony leaving? What the actual hell was happening? It was like he was trapped in one of his reoccurring nightmares where he watches Tony die over and over before they could ever even make up and Steve was powerless to do anything.
"One more chance, Spidey."
"Step aside, old man. Mrs. Ellen and I will show you how it's done!" Peter and Ellen shared a high five.
"Yeah. Now, I have to actually scold you for what you did yesterday with Peter!"
He blacked out.
"I did, but it's okay-"
"Do you want me to leave, Tony? Cause I fucking will if it annoys you so much that I simply have to exists in your presence, your majesty!" Steve spat, stopping at the top of the staircase that lead to Tony's lab. Tony suddenly turned to Steve, fists balled and jaw clenched.
"It was just this kid at school, it doesn't matter-"
"If you want to meet him, you might be able to come over this weekend."
Peter swallowed hard, scratching his arm. He scampered down the stairs before knocking on the glass door.
"You're a conceited asshole! You ruin everything! You ruined your life, my life, and anyone's lives you come in contact with!"
"Focus on me, alright?"
"Could anyone really think you're trans? Not like there's anything wrong with being trans, you're just so masculine."
"Get the fuck out."
"I'll get it!" Steve said, rushing to the door and swinging it open. On the other side of the door stood a short boy, no older than fourteen.
"Boys!" Natasha snapped. "It doesn't matter now. We need to stick together if we're gonna find him. Now come on."
"I'm a dad."
Steve sighed, rubbing the space between his eyes. "Trapping a 16 year old in a room with a grown man. That sounds like a tabloid line waiting to be written."
He coughed slightly, blood slowly dripping out of his mouth. What the fuck was happening?
Peter exited the bathroom, towel thrown over his shoulders. The blonde man smiled. "Sorry about scaring you. Again."
Peter was curled up in the corner of the couch while Tony was busy grabbing all the games in the tower. Peter wanted to help, but Tony refused to let him help at all.
Thor raised his hand, only to be pushed down by Bruce.
"Peter-!"
A frantic woman rounded the corner, wiping her hands on the apron tied around her waist. "Ye- oh my goodness you're the Avengers."
"Remember. This is about him."
Steve almost wilted at the glare coming from his boyfriend. "Wh-Why is he moving in?"
Peter woke up the next morning to extreme pain and trouble breathing. He wheezed, trying to figure out what happened. He turned his head to see Tony curled up in a chair. He coughed hard as anxiety swelled on his chest.
Nat was about to ask more about him, but Clint's Dad Mode kicked in when he sensed the teen's awkwardness.
Cooper huffed. "Go away, Lila."
Even years later, when Peter and Cooper were married with a child, Peter would bring up the promise his father made to him in his teen. He’d say, "Thank you for keeping our family together."
"I'm sorry, Pete. It's hard to take you seriously. You just sound like an angry but harmless kitten."
"I love it. Thank you, Dad."
And he will do it. If Steve is two things, persistent and stubborn are them. Maybe he'll get to be in love again. Maybe he deserved a second chance.
"You look and sound like you're thirteen, kid."
"You didn't help raise me and the only reason you took me in was because of moral obligation, I'm not stupid!"
There was no hope.
Peter crept down the street, now in his civilian clothes. He brushed a hand through his hair as he slipped into the lobby. He sprinted into the elevator and rapidly started pressing the penthouse button.
"Guys, this is Peter, my son. No questions please, just accept my son. Peter, you know all of their names, right?"
"Y-You want me to have your last name?" Peter asked, the pen slipping out of his hand.
"Peter, sweetheart, I'm a super spy. Now do your work."
Cooper doesn't exactly remember how or when he got a crush on Peter, but... god, he's so fucked. His eyes, his smile, his excitement, he's just-
"Of course, lovely."
"I know this family is kinda messed up and broken, Pete," Tony sighed. "But I'll fix this family somehow. Even if I have to do it on my own."
Clint flipped his imaginary long hair and strutted up the stairs, Peter trailing behind him to the kitchen where they found Nat making them all lunch. As the boys sat down, Nat called over her shoulder, "tell us about yourself, Peter."
In less than ten minutes, Peter was curled up in Tony's side, snoring peacefully.
Ned knew of his powers ever since he caught him climbing on his ceiling with his homemade, shitty Spiderman outfit. MJ just thinks her two friends are, in her words, 'absolutely fucking insane weirdos' and weirdly never questioned anything. Peter's sometimes suspicious before he remembers, she just probably doesn't care.
"That's not even the best part! After Nat shoved Tony off, he started doing a very badly reinterpretation of Single Ladies with an even worse a Capella version by him. It's still my favorite Tony story."
Clint snorted and focused back on the show.
Peter is kissing Cooper.
"Hello, Peter." T’Chala smiled.
"Yes, and I will be."
Peter stood up and tackled hugged him, slamming his head into his chest. "I love you, Dad."
Peter scrubbed his hands over his eyes. "Yeah, just... family troubles."
"We need Mr. Stark to come in alone."
He faintly heard Nat's voice in the back of his mind, but it was muddled and blurred and confusing. Like it was just clouding up his mind.
Ned sighed quietly. "Yeah, Pete. You're in the hospital right now."
(See the end of the chapter for
Peter has never been to school a day in his life. Once he turns 14, his guardians think he should give it a shot and join at least one extra curricular. They didn't expect him to choose cheerleading. And they expected the truths they learned along the way even less.
"Steve, stop. You're gonna make yourself bleed," Bucky reprimanded, nudging him gently.
So... if Natasha was a teenage boy, where would she hide her things?
"Mr. Stark."
When he hopped out of the car, he glanced up at the building. For such a dinky, run down apartments complex, it filled him with absolute dread. He swallowed the lump forming in his throat as he walked in and up the many flights of stairs.
He forced himself to take it off, sliding his shirt on immediately afterwards, trying to not look at his chest. He started crying again. This day couldn't get worse. He couldn't wear his binder and Tony would find out he's transgender and kick him out and Flash would mock him more and everything would go to shit. The worst part? He knew damn well not to wear his binder to sleep, but he became so paranoid Tony would already hate him he did it anyway. He wanted to slam his head on the wall. He pressed his back against the door, trying to help himself breathe better.
Cooper kicked the back of MJ's seat. "Fuck off, Michelle."
Peter was curled up in the corner of the couch while Tony was busy grabbing all the games in the tower. Peter wanted to help, but Tony refused, simply saying "he could handle it."
"What?!" Peter tried to jump up, but MJ was pushing his shoulders down.
"Well. It's definitely that house," Clint mumbled into the coms.
"Jesus Christ, kid, don't scare me like that!" Tony's eyes looked a bit frenzied.
"Stay the fuck away from me." Cooper stared at his feet.
Bucky rolled his eyes and he scooped the cookies off the metal pan. Clint, who has a super sense for food, swooped into the kitchen and tried to steal a cookie, but Bucky slapped his hand away. "Good Lord, you're almost as annoying as Sam."
"Are you sure?"
"I was wrong. I was being selfish and only thinking about myself, kiddo. I should have realized that I should have been here for you. I'm sorry, kiddo."
"Hey, that's one thing you guys have in common."
"I'm just going to check again-"
An annoying beeping rung in Peter's ears. Quiet murmuring woke Peter from his not-so-peaceful nap. He cracked open his eyes, only to be blinded by harsh, white light. ]
"Dad, I have to get to school."
Peter giggled. "It's a deal."
"I want my kids back, Laura."
"My gaydar is amazing. Plus you have a lesbian flag pin on your jacket."
"Language!"
"But I'm going to."
steve finally gets some love
"I'm not. I'm just right about this." Steve kissed his head gently. "You're lucky I didn't let Clint come down here to have a word with you. He was doing target practice with your eyes."
"Okay, Peter. I'll try my best."
"Maybe he didn't wanna bother you, huh?"
Peter couldn't help it. From the weeks of pent up emotion, he started to cry. He didn't even quite know why. He just started crying. Tony, meanwhile, had no clue what to do. Does he give him a hug? Kids like hugs, right? Tony pulled him into a hug, patting his head. Peter just cried harder. Why is he crying? God help Tony. He had no clue how to handle a kid!
"Steve, please tell me you're not sleeping on the floor again," Natasha Romanova whispered from the stairs. Steve rolled over on his side. "C'mon, Steve. You're gonna mess up your back."
Peter huffed quietly. He spotted Steve in a cap and sun glasses waving him over. The only up side to this is that Steve drives a really nice red 1964 Chevrolet Malibu. He threw his bag in the back of the car, slipping into the passenger seat, trying to ignore Steve.
"Sp-Spider
As he read article after article about building up a teen's confidence and communication, his head started to throb. He was going to kill this kid before he turned sixteen. He felt terrible. Peter seems like such a sweet kid and he was mess up his entire life. Tony was just an idiotic, drunk, playboy billionaire. He didn't even know he was a dad. He probably passed on his worst genes, like his anxious tendencies and proneness to addiction. He was going to ruin this kid. He felt a weight press on his chest. Jesus Christ, not now, not ever.
Tony's slight, developing dad senses kicked in. "I'll go try to help?"
Peter helped him stand up and walk to his room. They worked together to shove things into a few bags for Cooper.
"Absolutely. You could punch me in the face and cut off Steve's face and I'd still love you."
Tony stared at him. What was he supposed to to? Tony sucked at feelings. "I'm sorry."
An hour later, Lila walked into Cooper's room, without knocking, and saw Peter and Cooper cuddling in all their glory.
Steve's jaw dropped. "Tony has a son?"
Two Bartons and Starks ride up to the community floor of Avenger's tower. "Fri, tell Barton to get his ass into the living room."
"That's it, Stevie."
"Clint, no. Just relax and try to get to sleep."
"Y-Yeah." Well, this was mortifying. Telling one of your idols you're scared of something as stupid as yelling.
"So, you're being seen out in public with us, the Avengers, more."
"Pete-" He whispered softly. His balled up fists started shaking as they opened and relaxed. He cleared his throat and said more clearly, "Go to your room."
"You know you love me!" Cooper yelled as he stepped into his elevator.
"She's a brat, but okay. Now, let's go gorge ourselves on pasta."
Peter was floored.
"Depends. Is it a good or bad talk?"
The teens were on their fourth movie of the night. Ned and MJ were collapsed in a pile of asleep kids, Peter was curled up into Cooper's side, half asleep, and Cooper was wide awake, watching Sharknado, because
"No."
Peter yelped, turning to see Natasha in the doorway. "O-Oh. H-Hi, Miss Romanoff."
"So, this was the first mission we all had ever gone on as a team, even before that damn alien attack, since Fury wanted to see if we would actually work well as a team. So, we were all on a quinjet on the way back. Thor is trying to get everyone to drink this Asgardian whiskey, and I didn't drink any 'cause I'm a responsible adult-"
"Ha!"
Steve smiled goofily. "That's one hellava way to say it."
@ that one person in that one game shop
Peter tried to force out a smile. "I love it, M-Mr. Star- Dad- Mr. Dad Stark."
"Thank you again for signing up for this, Mister Parker. He'll be in here soon."
"I'm not a child! I'm fifteen!"
Cooper furrowed his eyebrows in concern. "Are you okay, Peter?"
"What? Are we not good enough?" Ned cried. MJ patted his shoulder.
Steve chuckled softly. The kid was to nice to even possibly hurt someone. "Come in, Peter. I'll go try to get Tony."
"Hey, Peter, and please, for the love of God, call me Natasha or Nat. Miss Romanoff makes me to feel way too old."
"Don’t know. They as cool as you?"
Peter blushed sheepishly. "S-Sorry. I was getting to know and moving in with my dad."
Cooper looked shocked. "Go to hell."
"Wait, you don't know?"
"We've decided we're just gonna spare you the shame and hang out, Clint," Nat joked, patting his shoulder while she walked out of the gym. "I'm going to make lunch!"
Steve stormed out of the room and then the building, leaving Tony alone in their once shared room. How dare he? All the pent up emotions from the past week bubbled up inside his throat and came out in heaving sobs.
"Oh, hey! You're MJ, right?"
"You know what? You get this from your father. He's a little faggot too."
Everyone chose a tiny car, or one of the extra ones Tony made since there's only six and game nights can include up to thirteen people, and got set up. Everyone but Clint went to college ("College is for pussies!" "Language!")
"I know nothing about being transgender. I'll fuck it all up."
"Dad?" he whispered softly, shuffling over to the desk Tony was hunched over. "I-I'm sorry about earlier. I was way out of line and-"
Tony slipped out of the room, letting Peter slip on his academic decathlon sweatshirt and jeans. He smiled softly at his reflection, seeing as he passed pretty well that day. He grabbed a comb and pushed his hair out of his face like his Aunt May used to always tell him to do-
"Y-Yeah- I think."
"Well, at least tell me you didn't forget you were showing a new kid around today."
Steve's eyebrows furrowed. He couldn't even know why a random child was moving into a tower he also lived in? This was just getting ridiculous. He just wanted the chance to even explain himself!
"Maybe if you spent five minutes without your head shoved up your ass, you'd realize you're not exactly perfect either!"
"Let's play some Just Dance then we can watch a movie!" Peter grinned.
Peter finds his dad (who doesn't quite believe him)
Peter gently pulled away. "Oh my God, I'm sorry-"
"Shut up, Clint, Peter may be heterosexual."
"Woah. Watch your language, Spider-boy."
It doesn't help that all the cis guys were basically sweating testosterone, making Peter even more insecure.
Bucky busted out laughing.
"Nice. Great job. What about three things you can hear?"
"F-Fine. I'll take it off."
Mandy came down to feed him.
Tony rolled his eyes. "You have to go to hair and make up. Sadly, you didn't get enough of those looks from me."
Peter smiled softly, but he couldn't stop thinking about what if Clint was telling the truth? Ms. Barton really was homophobic? What if she disowned Cooper?
"How'd you know?"
"I'm gay," Ned added, when Peter blurted out, "I'm bi!"
"Oh, he is! The scariest thing I've ever seen was him playing Jenga with Dad, Dr. Banner, and Mr. Thor. I was almost killed-"
"Mr. Stark, I'm so sorry-"
MJ scowled. "Yeah. I want to have a word with him."
Peter hugged him harder.
Clint Barton scampered down the stairs and bursted into the lab.
"Yeah, I know. I was there."
"Since when could you do
. Isn't this kid supposed to be a teen boy?
Cooper kissed his mom goodbye, ruffling his little brother Nate's hair, before trotting down the stairs of his apartment building where MJ was honking the horn. He slipped into the back seat, despite he was the tallest.
As soon as Peter thought he heard the familiar voice of his dad, he brought out all of his energy to yell for him.
Ellen.
"Fuck."
MJ huffed, "Fine."
"That's a plan. Also, I love you."
"I- I was being an idiot. I-I felt like you were trying to ignore you so I wanted a way to get you to notice me somehow. So, I just decided to flirt and she kissed me and you just looked over at the wrong time-" Steve took a deep breath. "Sorry."
"About...?"
"Begin!"
Peter makes a mistake and Steve realizes his own
He shook his head, pressing himself into his bed.
Cooper rolled his eyes, shoving her away. "Bye, Liles."
Cooper let out a soft sob. "You wanna know something? My lil' brother, Nate, he was- he was fuckin' one! One year old! And that asshole just- just fucking left!"
"Do you want me to call you an Uber or something to get home? I'll sit out here with you while we wait."
"Mr. Hawkeye!"
"Perfect!"
"I never said I thought that, don't shoot the messenger!"
"Steve, come on, I'll talk to him-"
"It's gigantic. My room itself is as big as my old apartment in Queens! And, sadly, no pets."
"Did you convince him into this? Do you want
Then when Steve came home, either from his drunkness or pent up emotions, he screamed at Steve. He didn't even know what he said, just a lot of 'fuck you's and 'I can't believe I ever loved you's. Then, he just went to the lab and cried his eyes out. Until he fell asleep with his head on his desk.
"Let's go, losers."
"Sh, sh, sh! I'm not telling anyone yet! You were supposed to find out at dinner."
Tony furrowed his eyebrows in worry. Peter's identical eyes to Tony's were rimmed with red. His fingers tapped rapidly against his thigh like Tony's did. His hair fell in his face lazily in his face like Tony's did when he was too stressed or tired to fix it.
"Oh, ok Ms. Ba- Laura!"
"Alert sent."
"Okay, that's good. Come here, buddy."
"Don't insult Peter!" Tony scolded.
"What about Pete? Tony asked me to take him to his room."
"I-I'm Peter Parker. I need to speak to Mr. Stark." Peter awkwardly smiled, clearly trying to calm himself down. Steve almost smiled at his nerves, but he was a bit suspicious how the kid even got up to the top floor without a card. "I-I can call the guy who needs me to speak with Mr. Stark if that helps!"
"He's sprinkling garlic onto the bread."
"He reminds me of you, Tony. You do the same thing."
1) school has been kicking my absolute ass.
Tony watched the teen sit across from him, the boy slightly curling in on himself, making Tony wince. Before Tony could even open his mouth again, Peter rushed out. "I'm sorry about snapping at you last night, it was wrong, and if you want me to leave and never come back, I understand."
"Don't worry, Spidey. You're with me now."
"Y-yeah. A bit."
"I mean he's not with Tony and no one else knows where he is."
"Oh! So... is it Madame Parker-Stark?"
And, no matter how many times Peter said it, Tony would always respond, "Pete, it was you. You were the one to pull us back."
Peter decides he doesn't care. He's hungry.
"I am? Why didn't anyone tell me, I would've gotten beer."
"'Cause I'm an asshole and an idiot, Tones. I-I was mad and hurt and my idiotic brain wanted to make you hurt as much as I did. I know that sounds just plain
"Hello there, Peter! I never thought Stark would have a child!" Thor boomed, a sweet smile plastered on his face that made Peter feel he was mocking him (even though Thor wasn't).
"Nah, let him get into our dumb circle."
Peter sat down, pulling his boyfriend to his chest, despite their obvious size difference. "Hey, you can stay with me."
"Laura divorced Clint when she found out he was bisexual."
"Thank you for bringing me into your family, Dad." Peter walked around the desk and hugged Tony. Tony placed his head on his son's.
"Listen, I would never hurt Peter. I'd rather die than let him get a scratch on him, alright? I'll protect him to the ends of the earth in the real world if you'll protect him at school. He won't let me talk to whatever little douchebag is hurting him. He's too nice to let me."
Nat walked up to him. "Stark being a dick?"
"You know what? I don't even want to know!" Sam whisper yelled. "I am sick and tired of telling you that the last thing Tony needs on his plate is is douchebag
"Okay."
"He'll get down here eventually, Thor the God of gayness," Tony quipped, making Clint look confused.
The door slammed open and he felt the binds being ripped from his wrists. He fell into whoever was in front of him, his eyes slipping open slightly.
Bucky stepped into the kitchen, kissing Clint's forehead and handing him a cup he salvaged from Cooper. "Drink up, we gotta get goin' soon."
Him and Ned exchanged an overly dramatic handshake. Cooper went in for a hug, picking him up slightly. "Petercus!"
Peter pulled away, cheeks red from both crying and embarrassment. "S-sorry..."
Tony's face was buried in his hands. Peter threw his arms around Tony. "Oh! And Miss Widow- I-I mean Nat, she wants to be called Nat, is also really nice! She and Mr. Hawkeye wanted to teach me how to fight, but Mr. Hawkeye said Dad would yell at them 'cause he said he didn't want me hurt. And Mr. Hawkeye is really nice too! He played Mario Kart with me and my friends!"
"How long has he been missin'? Do we know anthin'? Everyone knows, right?" Clint asked quickly, shifting from foot to foot.
"Well, it's nice to meet you, Parker Peter." Cooper playfully winked, making Peter almost choke on air itself.
some how?"
"All three?"
"He fucking WHAT NOW?" Nat screeched.
"Yeah."
Peter felt defeated. "P-Please no..."
"Nothing."
"Bu- I- fuck..." he let out another choked sob. "I-I should've listened to dad... god dammit."
peter loves his family, both at school and at home
Like how he was never going to be a real boy.
Steve carefully sat down next to Tony. Tony wouldn't look up from his feet. "What's up?"
"Peter, please. It's your dad."
"Quiet, Peter. I'm bragging to your teen friend." Clint started doing a mocking dance.
"I'll be fine, Steve." Tony forced a fake smile onto his face, squeezing his hand gently before walking off. Steve sat on the uncomfortable plastic chair again.
"Come in!"
"Yes?"
"Pete? You still up?"
He started to examine his chest, thankfully no bruises or blood showing up. Just some trouble breathing. Thank god. He pulled on the water of the shower and checked his phone. 05:00. Good, no Avenger should be up for a while, right?
with Jacksepticeye. If I have to hear
"No problem, kid."
"Mister Parker. Mister Barton has requested your presence in the living room."
"Ned. Quiet down. I'm trying to sleep," he whined quietly, rubbing his eyes.
"Wh-What? That doesn't sound like Clint-"
"I'm here to talk to Mr. Stark and he told me to explore while he worked on his suits!"
"Yeah." Tony smiled before putting on a fake serious face. "You are my son, right?"
MJ laughed loudly. "You never crossed the finish line, bird bitch."
"Then bring him in! I'm in the kitchen with Lila and Nate!"
"Mr. Stark. Come on."
but in the moment it made sense."
"Is Tony Stark here?"
"Don't listen to him, Peter. He got so drunk he made out with the wall," Nat noted, leaning against the breakfast bar.
A few hours later in Manhattan, Tony Stark was in the midst of the very beginnings of a panic attack. He rested his elbows on the lab's desk, hands gripping at his brown hair. All this started with Tony thinking of Peter, trying to even get a grasp on that he, Anthony Edward Stark, had a child, a son. A nice, amazing, sweet son who Tony is going to end up ruining. Whether it be from his seclusion, his alcoholism, his trouble forming relationships, his anxiety, or, hell, even just from being a superhero.
i deadass cried while writing this so have fun lol
He, in all honesty, did not mean to cheat on Tony those months ago. He just got mad Tony seemed to be spending time with every other person but Steve. Hell, Tony seemed to enjoy the company of his A.I.s before he'd talk to Steve. He just wanted Tony to get jealous. A little riled up. Maybe even think that he might be losing Steve. So he flirted with a pretty red head girl with freckles splattered across her pale face. Sure, she was cute, but she wasn't Steve's type.
"Really? Then why did you need to talk to me?"
Steve saw Tony walk into the room out of the corner of his eye, making his stomach explode into butterflies. Tony spotted him and rushed over.
Peter froze, shutting and squeezing his eyes closed slowly. "Please tell me I have my binder on at least."
"Mandy-"
"As ready as I'll ever be. What's the category?"
Clint slipped into a long sleeved button up, matching it with a black blazer and a purple tie. He stumbled his way to the kitchen, where Cooper was chugging a pot of coffee just like his old man.
Cooper and Tony walked into the kitchen, Clint immediately shutting him mouth and Steve moving towards the door.
A knock at the door rung through his room. In a raspy voice, Peter weakly said, "Come in."
"Coop and I missed ya. Now c'mon. I have a court case to win."
"I was so worried about you!"
And with that, the glass darkened and the door was basically bolted shut. He knew yelling wouldn't help, though he desperately wanted to scream for Tony to give him half an ear to why he did what he did.
Tony walked over, kissing him on the cheek. "It's gonna be fine, Stevie, we'll find someway to he-"
Peter wiped away his tears. "Yessir."
With Peter waking up so early the subway was somewhat empty (still pretty full, but the morning work rush wasn't quite there), Peter made it to school twenty minutes early, despite the hour commute. When Peter closed his locker, Ned encased him in a surprise hug. He jumped slightly before wrapping his arms around his friend.
The poison in his body was moving so, so slowly. He could feel every bit of pain spreading slowly through his body. He could hear his heartbeat, and it was going way too slow.
"Yay! Thank you, Coopston!" Peter hugged him, causing his blush to deepen. MJ mimed making out and Cooper discreetly flipped him off.
"They're on their way sir."
"Okay, cut the shit, Stark," she snapped. "You're not a good person, and we both know that, but Peter is. Peter is the kindest, sweetest boy in the entire fucking world, yet he's been through some tough shit. If you ever hurt him, even unintentionally, I will fucking end you. I don't give a shit that you're fucking Ironman. Are we clear?"
"Fine. Let's go..." Clint flipped Lila over his shoulder, making her squeal. "...get food!"
"What would you do if your kid was missing, just sit around? If you just spoke up, we might actually have Peter back by now!"
Clint was curled into Bucky's chest, fingers tapping gently against his metal arm. Clint was... panicking to put it extremely lightly. He forgot how stressful it was to be a parent.
"Ask F.R.I.D.A.Y."
"Good talk. Nothing about Steve."
His sense of time is screwed up.
"Coopston! Put me down!"
God, he sounds like a sixth grader.
Tasha sighed, deciding to give up for the night. She scampered up the stairs as Steve fell asleep once more.
"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Tony."
"You're not softly scolding me for not eating."
"R-rain and gasoline."
"You cheated!" Sam snapped.
"Sorry."
"Yeah!" Peter grinned. "I'm on TV! That's so cool, Clint!"
"I think they've calmed down, okay? Was the yelling scaring you?"
"Mr. Parker, sorry to interrupt your time with your friend, but Mr. Barton and Miss Romanoff just arrived back."
Jessie chuckled, starting to mess with Peter's hair. "Is this the way you usually part it?"
"Get Peter to bring Cooper back. Explain what Laura did and told the judges."
"Ned, relax. It's fine, dude."
Peter was shaking. He couldn't do this. Everyone would hate him.
Cooper stormed out, leaving Clint in tears. "God fucking dammit."
"It is 00:00, Mister Parker."
"Hi, Miss Widow!" he squeaked our quietly.
"Your Honor, the divorce between Laura and Clint Barton was sometime in 2014, a few months after Sokovia, right? Well, I did some digging and found that the judge for their first custody battle was anti-hero," Bridgette smiled. "In fact, he was later convicted for conspiring an anti-hero terrorist attack. So, if anything, my client was at an extreme disadvantage and should have never lost custody of Cooper, Lila, and Nathaniel. Thank you for your time."
"Then why aren't you up there, confirming you still fucking love him? Do you know how absolutely terrified he was to come out to you guys? He's had three panic attacks in the past twelve hours."
"Ah, dang." Peter pouted.
"And you didn't tell anyone?"
"Cooper-"
"Tony, hon, calm down," Steve mumbled. "What's wrong, doll?"
Two hours later, Clint was on Laura's doorstep, letting his daughter go back to her mom and handing his ex a document.
"Hello to you too, sure, and what's your rush?"
"Uh bupbupbupbupbupbup. This is the part where you zip it, Peter," Tony said, standing over the teen. Peter cowered down. "You need to keep me updated, Peter! You know what? You're grounded for the week. No, month. Actually, until you leave for god damn college!"
The teen was obviously nervous, fiddling with the straps of his backpack, his brown eyes flickering between Steve's eyes and his own red converse.
"You're gonna do fine, Clint, your kids are gonna be yours again. Your ducks are all in a line," Bucky mumbled.
peter is super gay
Tony put his arms behind him and tried to wave them in a cape-like way. He then shoved his fists in front of him, trying to act like Superman. Ellen got it after two guesses.
Steve swore he could hear something beneath him.
Peter was struggling to keep his eyes open. He felt blood gurgling at the back of his throat every time he breathed. His chin was touching his chest and he couldn't even find the energy to bring it up. He heard  Mandy leave ages ago, so he thinks he's safe.
"Uh, the last time anyone saw him was last night, 'round nine."
"Of course, dear, anything." Laura's eyebrows were furrowed in worry.
"You need to breathe, Clint."
Clint knows he's been sneaking out. Sometimes, when his anxieties at night get the best of him, he goes and checks in on Peter and Cooper. Cooper, more often than not, is fast asleep, snoring as much as Clint know he snores, but Peter is either thrashing, wide awake, or just not there. But he's always back by morning.
"You good, birdbrain?" Tony snorted.
"Yessir."
"But-"
"You're doing good, Peter," he heard another voice whisper. Peter opened his eyes to see Bruce Banner. Bruce smiled softly at the boy.
"Never talk about my kids again, if you know what's good for you, Stark." Clint stalked off back to the living room. Peter was talked quickly to Bruce, Clint picking up quick words of talk about transitioning.
Ned threw his arms around his friends, starting to guide them towards their shared homeroom. "So, how big's where ever you're staying? Huge? Tiny? Does he have pets?"
Steve slapped his arm, huffing angrily. "Look, Buck, please don't do that around Tony. I'm trying to build his trust again. I just hope his kid likes me still."
"Oh, like flirting didn't help that?"
He ended up stopping a few tiny thefts and a kid who dropped his ice cream cone, which the mother repaid him by getting him ice cream. As he sat on a balcony in Brooklyn, he ate his honestly gigantic ice cream cone. The sliding glass door was shoved to the side harshly, making Peter yelp and drop his ice cream four stories.
"Tones-"
Cooper lead Peter out to the table, sitting down with Peter to his left, Nate on his other side.
. Holy shit. Out of everyone in NYC, sweet little Peter was the last person she'd guess. She picked up the suit to fold and place it on his bed so they could have a little chat about it later when a piece of cloth fell out. She quirked an eyebrow and picked it up.
In Peter's room, Tony was giving him a lecture. Peter knew he was right. Steve was, and although Peter didn't like swearing, was an asshole. Peter was a little sad, though, Tony looked really mad at him.
They walked to the door, even feeling Laura's glare on their back. As they walked to the elevator, they heard a teen girl yell after them.
Something touched Tony. Whether it was seeing Clint cry for the first time ever or the fact he was imagining Peter in these situations, he was convinced. He was going to try to relate, but instead just said, "I'll find you the best child custody lawyer money can buy. We'll get your kids back, don't worry."
"Hey, Ned!"
"Sorry, guys. I'm a bit out of it today."
Peter yelped, and Clint brought the boy to his chest, cradling his head in his hand protectively.
It was almost scary how competitive the three teens and one manchild became. So far, they have played two rounds, four races each. MJ won the first, Clint narrowly won the second by a single point, and now they were on the last race of the last round. At the moment, Clint and MJ were tied for first, Peter in second, and Ned coming in at a nice fourth. In the current race, Clint had a pretty massive lead.
"No, I won't 'chill out,' Ned, Peter ran into a burning building and almost died!"
Peter elbowed her, making her punch his arm. MJ's eyebrows furrowed as she sniffed the air. "Pete? Do you smell smoke?"
"If you're ok with it."
"Oh, my bad." Peter took his voice to a whisper. "I like your accent, where you from?"
"The kid has a name, Steve. He's his own person. What is his name?"
"Who the hell are you?"
"No, I-I thought he'd be back by morning!"
"He's in his lab, Mr. Parker. Would you like me to notify Mr. Stark of your approach?"
And how his dad will never love him since he was never with him.
"Hey, mom, I'm gonna show Peter my room, can you call us when it's tine for dinner?"
"You're the worst!" Peter screeched.
He eventually reached the towering building, and it seemed as if all of his hopes and dreams crowded up in his throat and blocked his airway. The lack of oxygen clearly cut off his rational thinking considering he decided to run right into the flaming building. He sprinted up six flights of stairs, smoke starting to crawl its way into Peter's lungs. He started coughing harshly, slamming open his apartment door. His vision started burring once he saw Aunt May. And he passed out once he grabbed her hand.
"Go away."
Peter started walking faster. He heard Flash huff from behind him.
"C'mon. Let's get you to bed. I'll stay with you, but no binder, alright?"
Bruce winced. "Okay, Tony. You know the breathing exercises, right? Four in, hold seven, out eight. Here, follow along."
"Dad..."
"Hello, Peter! I'm Alana and they're Jessie. You're so polite."
Peter tried not to cry because if he started he wouldn't be able to stop then he'd have to explain to Tony Stark that he dreamed of the day where he actually met his father and his father loved him. With a shaky voice, he muttered out, "O-Okay, D-Dad."
"What happened between you two? I thought you guys were dating."
Tony brought Peter into a hug. A sudden clunking came from above as a blonde fell from the ceiling. Clint groaned loudly as he held his back.
What did Aunt May always tell him to do when he panicked? Fuck... Aunt May. Aunt May. She's dead. It's all Peter's fault. He should have been faster. Why wasn't he faster?
"You bet."
The family is terrified
Her fingers hooked under his chin, lifting it to look her in the eye. She had a sickly sweet smile on her face.
"It's so nice to meet you!" he squeaked out.
The concept was always hard for Peter to grasp onto. Growing up, he’s only known a lot of death and abandonment. His father didn’t know he existed, his mother left him and then died, and his aunt and uncle died.
"Peter Benjamin Parker, first of all, you do not yell at your father-"
"Fair. Who doesn't? But not what the endgame of this conversation. Since you are my one and only true heir, I was thinking, and you don't have to say yes, maybe adding Stark to your last name? Like Parker-Stark? Or Stark-Parker?" Tony said, fiddling with his robots.
"The one and only. Pete, can you introduce me to your friends?"
"Nice to meet you too, Peter!"
"What the fuck does that mean?!"
"Y-Yeah. i know you don't like him, but please try to be nice? Let's just go upstairs and hang out, alright?" Peter begged.
life moves on
"Peter's mad at me."
Tony actually laughed for the first time in weeks. "If you're comfortable, you can call me Dad, Pete."
On days like these, Steve really wishes he could get drunk.
"Steven Grant Rodgers..." he whispered, squatting down to see his boyfriend closer. His hair was longer and his beard was getting scruffy. Tony sat near his head. He ran his fingers gently through Steve's hair and sighed. "How can you be both a complete and utter asshole but such a damn sweetheart?"m
Tony froze nervously. "I'm sorry, Peter. My own mom died when I was six." They sat in awkward silence for a good few minutes, Tony fiddling with two little pieces of metal. "I'm sorry, Peter, but what did you mean earlier when you said I'm all you had left?"
"I'm pretty sure that's what's happening, darling."
"Eat."
The little boy gasped, his bright blue eyes widening. God, he kinda looked like a tiny Peter with Steve's eyes.
"I’m Liberian."
Clint sat carefully on the couch. After Cooper left, even Peter ignored him. Peter was mad at him. He doesn't know why. He doesn't know what happened. He gripped the couch. God dammit, he hasn’t dont this in so fucking long, why now?
"Peter!" He heard footsteps slamming down the steps.
"Thank you, Pete."
In all honesty, Peter ended up finding Clint in the kitchen, starting to make a pot of coffee. He was going to get his dad, but Tony was sleeping in Mr. Roger's arms and he just looked so... peaceful. He didn't want to ruin it so he just dragged himself to the kitchen and willed himself not to be too loud when sobbing. That's where Clint and Peter met, Clint quickly switched the coffee for cocoa (with lots of whipped creme, for your information) and suggested that they watched a bad celeb drama TV show if Peter didn't want to talk about it (and since it  was another dream that included Aunt May's death, he absolutely did not want to).
"Should we knock?" Tony asked his clueless teammates.
"Yeah! Even worse, he's trying to get his kid to call my mom mom! And she
Peter was worried MJ was talking about his arm before he caught her staring at Shuri. Peter smirked as Cooper nudged her.
Tony was about to leave before a girl stood in his way.
"Competitive Heads Up!"
"You look like you're twelve."
"The answers no," the fourth and final girl said. "He's gay and dating Captain America, a fellow avenger. Can there be more dangerous conditions?"
Tony anxiously rapped on the front door of the cozy house. The door swung open to a small boy holding the handle.
After about thirty minutes, the entire team chatting casually with Ned and Peter. MJ was staring at Tony, which was making him very uncomfortable. Why was this tiny teen glaring at him?
Cooper's nightmares, Lila wanting to be with him again, the simple fact that he might see his little Nathaniel again, his fucking court case for his kids the next day... and that's not even mentioning where ever the hell Peter's been at night.
Clint snorted. "Ha! She wishes she could get someone as gorgeous as me."
Tony's mind supplies – asks, seeming intrigued. "Is it the jewelry you wear?"
He'll regret it later, alongside all the other things he'll regret, but for now Steve just knows when he's not wanted.  "I'll come back later," he promises quietly.
Natasha just glares at him and starts walking down the stairs.
Gun in one hand and map in the other, he treads through the woods until he reaches the side of the highway he'd been traveling on yesterday. His legs ache, but at least it's good exercise; any softness he'd had before the apocalypse has completely disappeared. Back in the second month, when people were still trying to adjust to the fantastic notion of "zombies" and Howard hadn't yet kicked him out, he'd gone out in his Audi R8 and driven through the city pretending to be a Formula One racer. Those days of fun are long gone, though; none of the cars have any gas left in them and most have been abandoned by the roadside or utterly demolished.
Tony nods, tapping his chin with an index finger. "Okay, okay, I see. Colors, abstraction, that's your thing. Hey, you got a sketchbook or anything around here? Journal to document your travels and whatnot? Steve's Artworks: Apocalypse Edition?"
Tony spins around, the action almost lazy, to face him.  "Steve," he blubbers, and Steve can't help the disgust that wells up in him.  His - his - hell, his
Steve frowns.  "I talked to Wanda on the phone yesterday, you know.  You don't have to... do this.  Worry about me."  (Wanda's not doing well either, from what he can discern.  There's a Vision-shaped hole in her heart that never did get filled.)
"Thor Odinson," booms the muscular blond guy. His deep voice matches his outward persona; Tony will have no problems remembering him.
Steve takes another look at the rumpled man in front of him.  The drink has done nothing but mar his beauty, that tentatively captivating gorgeousness.  "Go to bed, Tony," he says tiredly, suddenly feeling all of his ninety plus years. Even then, he knows - somehow - that the bed Tony will eventually retire to is not their own but the couch in the workshop.  "Just - Jesus. Go to bed."
But he restrained himself and just replied faux-casually, "Something like that."
He reaches Philadelphia around noon. The city, just like he suspected, is devoid of sound. The buildings stand tall and proud, old and wretched and beautiful at the edge of the city limits. Checking the map, he realizes he's right at the outskirts of West Philly, where U.S. Route 1 cuts right between two counties. An arch looms high above his head, with a sign mounted on it that reads:
God, imagine getting killed by a
"You haven't drunk in four months," Steve says.  He's incredulous. How could Tony just - give up - how could he - ?  It hurts. It hurts seeing his father beat his mother every time he closes his eyes and then open them and see his lover, stinking of expensive bourbon, try to excuse himself.
He's still thinking about this, chuckling quietly to himself, when there's the hiss of a door swinging open, and then a clatter from behind the counter.
"You're the kinky one," Sam says with a raised eyebrow.  "Bastard."
"Actually, there
even wishes that Steve hadn't found him…. That he'd died like that, collapsed amongst the rubble, shirt blooming a deep red.
"A smarter one," Tony says honestly. He has no qualms admitting that he shouldn't be alive, not unless it was for a reason. He'd been stupid, had marched into the Rite Aid like he was invincible, and suffered a high price for it. It'd only been by some ridiculous stroke of luck that someone like Steve had heard the explosion and decided to check for survivors.
The gun clatters next to him and he reaches out, but the zombie stomps on his fingers and then kicks the gun away. Great – an intelligent zombie. The guy must've turned sometime in the last month, then; he's not stupid or slow enough to have been infected for very long.
It burns.  They start separating, just a little bit.
He's big and blond and tall, and he's clearly an attractive man, but that's not what captivates Tony most. Instead, it's his gaze – stern and tough but also smart and caring all at once. His eyes are blue, and he's
"Can you play some music?" he says, lying back so that he's bisected at the neck, his head sticking out of the tent flaps so that he can stare up at the stars. "You know what I like. Your pick, JARV."
Tony flashed him a grin.  "That's sweet of you, Rogers."
"There is a Blick Art Materials on Sheffield Lane, between Overbrook Parkway and Henley Road."
The stairs take time to conquer, and he has to pause several times when the throbbing in his chest increases, but he finally makes it to the top. He finds himself staring out at the deserted ruin of what appears to be the remnants of a county building.
The group here, however, is made up of six faces. There's a dark-skinned guy with a rigid, military-like posture; there's a muscular blond with warm blue eyes; a man with a hostile gaze watches him steadily, his shoulders hunched and his dark brown hair tied up in a loose bun. On the other side of the table is Natasha, her face impassive; and she's seated between a rather unassuming man with curly brown hair and glasses and a lean guy with sandy brown hair and a sharp edge to his mouth. The man with the glasses looks oddly familiar, but for the life of him, Tony can't place why he recognizes him.
“Stark! Lady Natasha!” Thor beamed “my friends, what a pleasant surprise. To what do I owe the pleasure of your visit?”
Odin smiled at Frigga.
There was a quiet moment between them, where Jane clenched his hand so tight that he could almost feel the pressure, and then she relaxed, she let go.
The booming sounds of Asgards barriers drowned the sound of the choir singing the tales of old, blessing the royal union in a cacophony of death and song.
But inches away from the ground, a golden staff halted the stroke, as easy as one finger stops a page from turning with the soft breeze. Ronan choked as he came face to face with the All Father himself. Aged as he was, the elder warrior slapped the Kree Lord across the face and ripped the hammer from Ronan’s hands, like one handles an unruly child.
As Steve landed on the side of the plaza, next to the tanks advancing and failing to hold the fight against the metal giants, their resounding shots so pitiful against the fiery beams that cut through them like a hot knife in butter.
“Oh?”
And he lunged.
“Ehhh, hold that thought for a second.” Tony brought out the manila folder from his coat, only a couple of new stains on the front as he set it in front of the President “He doesn’t belong to America.”
The Halls of Asgards palace laid empty in the early marrow, the halls of learning deserted as all the students rested inside the rooms, lectures being had dutifully by all Asgardian younger court. Out there, prowling silently in an incongruent match of beings, the Guardians of the Galaxy tip toed around the rooms in search of their target.
Fury had warned him about her, now Steve was beginning to see why.
“Brother”
One dark brow rose to match the other, and Thor’s chest broke like a dam overfilled, spilling word after word to shape the events following Loki’s defeat, which earned him an enraged scowl, to his dealings with the United Nations and finally, Odin’s vow.
“Hush, Steven, it was only a dream.”
Thor nodded stiffly and prepared himself for a bloody encounter “Aye, Captain”
“Xandar pledged alliance with Asgard to be granted protection of the Kree empire” Gamora explained, gaze caught still by the All Seeing eyes of the God, as if they were physically compelling her to speak
Tony grit his teeth “I warned you” and he shot forward.
So when Steve had walked in at the party, Tony had freaked. Everything came back to him, all he had held down, hid and buried under elaborate lies and sweet promises had come to light at the sight of those baby blues and that fucking perfect smile.
“He is well, aye. As well as can be expected in those cells” Thor shared, his hands slowly but surely becoming more adventurous as he dipped his fingers under the laps of Steve’s shirt, carefully exploring his clavicle before retreating to the safety of his shoulder blades. His strong fingers drawing circles on the supple flesh of his husbands back, sneaking caresses to his soft, ivory skin there where his clothes allowed his unencumbered advances, and then just a bit further. Steve’s cheeks began to heat with every stolen touch but did not complain.
Steve sighed and turned away from that problem immediately. He ain’t touching that with a 10 foot pole.
Heimdall blinked.
The doors shut with a loud bang and the only sound left was the pained gasps of the dark God.
“One… two… Three!” Volstagg counted and as soon as the count was done, he curled over their joint hands, pitting all his strength into the hold. And still, Steven held fast.
“Wow,
“Councilmen…” Steven said, stopping the impending shouting with a firm and commanding voice “The goal of political argument or discussion is not victory, but
Loki curled into Thor’s embrace with a sigh “Brother”
Much like he was doing right now, in fact.
“Thank you” Steve whispered “Just… Thank you”
“You will make a fine addition to this Court” Odin complimented the Captain, who smiled tightly and thanked the God graciously. Thor stayed in his chair until his father left the room. The Captain waited by the door, looking back at the God of Thunder with a confused frown as they were left alone in the Council rooms, quickly dissolving into a stunned flush as Thor stood from his seat with an impressive erection tenting his trousers and a playfully suggestive wiggle of his eyebrows.
“I’ll give you a deeper something…” Steven glared and muttered as he once again limped his way across the room, earning a sultry grin from the God.
The crowd did surge then, the guards drew their weapons, crossing spears and blocking the violent court from reaching the princes. Thor rose Mjolnir with a fierce snarl and lightning sung from afar. To Loki’s side, the Captain gripped his shield higher though his eyes did not follow the spiting Asgardians as he, but were resting on the King instead, unwavering and unapologetic as he stood at the ready to cross weapons with the mightiest God of them all.
“So be it, the Master is Stevens to have, from today to the end of his days”
They all turned their heads abruptly at the struggling Archer, who had both his hands on Mjolnir in a tight grip, pulling with all his body until his face turned cherry red. He released the handle with an irritated scuff.
“Time is up, Captain.”
Steve could not remember how he moved or when he decided it was a good idea to cross the Father of Gods, but as his face was splashed with Loki’s blood, still warm and pulsing. He suddenly found himself face to face with the All Father, Mjolnir forgotten across the room and now Gungnir clasped firmly in his bruised hands.
” Thor growled and Drax nodded “Yes, he is not a dude,
“Where is he?”
Frandal moaned in despair as the blond pair exited the tent, his complains drowned out by the Giant’s eager coxing and chuckles.
“How is Loki?”
“The children you sire in him will be fierce”
Thor tried and failed to speak, reassurances rising and curdling on his tongue. What could he say in Odin’s defense, when the evidence of his bias rested plain and hurting in his brother’s face? Thor felt his courage and hope shrivel into himself, a lost child in a man’s disguise and aching. How could he help his brother when the same man who was supposed to defend him had hurt him so badly?
Thor could barely hold his excitement as the Soldier rose from his seat and hooked his fingers on his underthings with a shy grin. “Ready?”
And then he had given him this, for his child. Steve had pictured him as a father and smiled, had been happy for him. Tony’s heart had broken.
“Jesus Fuck”
“It was nothing I did not deserve” Thor admitted, downcast and gloom “I have failed Earth many times over, I can only hope the Norn’s give me life long enough to make amends.”
Steve sighed, and adjusted the grip on his shield.
Her eyes rolled back into her skull, veins in her neck bulging as she gapped her mouth trying to scream, to cry, or plea. Her legs shaking wildly on Tony’s hips.
The Soldier snickered silently and his eyes twinkled that devious light that made Thor frown suspiciously.
The Director’s resolution broke and his shoulders slumped as he allowed himself one more concession to sentiment “Come here, Steve.” And there in the cocoon of their friendly embrace, the Director whispered softly into the Captain’s ear “Don’t trust
Steve pressed a palm to his heaving chest as he threw his head back in loud rings of laughter.
“So we are traveling to the edge of the planet so you can beat Frandal” Steven said, tone blank and dry as the Midgardian desserts. Thor nodded, hands fidgeting on the reigns of their cart.
He heard the jet’s guns fire after the squadron that followed Steve exited the squabble and cut short all the Asgardians that pursued. Steve made a sign to Natasha and waited as she expertly landed the jet in the small space before the chambers.
Then he saw it.
And his sympathy for the Man of Iron froze him to the core.
Thor pursed his lips together, startling as the door on the back screeched open. Steven walked out with a grand block of precious stone in his arms. Master Bragi lifted an appreciative eyebrow at the selection or at the show of strength and nodded at his student. “Well done Steven, very well indeed”
Odin eyed his clean, unmarked clothes and chest, then Steven’s bruised and soiled attire. “Alone…”
And Steve could have sworn the God looked lost, sitting there alone and unguarded for the first time in years. It was only a second and gone without a trace, Steve closed the door behind himself with a sorrowful sigh.
Three days passed, and three days it rained in New Mexico. Raging thunderstorms that threatened to level the skies over their heads, and in some near melancholic moments, a soft peppering of raindrops fell; scattering in the winds to instantly dry in the hot sands.
The musicians halted their song and the mages fell into silence, the luminescence ended and only the natural beauty of sunrise remained, all the more lovely now that it was left unimpeded and glorious in it’s own right.
Sif sheathed her sword back into its scabbard with a sigh “He attempted the three minute thing?”
Thor pressed his body over the now bare skin of the Captain, rubbing the length of his own body, fully clothed still against the naked expanse of the Soldier, eliciting a soft heated groan when Thor’s rough breaches scratched against the sensitive length of the man’s cock.
Heimdall was quiet
Thor felt his face burn in rage as yet another ignorant human made light of the All Fathers vow. His fingers tapped impatiently on Mjolnir’s handle as he barely suppressed the urge to smite the Earthling on the spot.
The Avengers sat in the large royal table, next to the Guardians of the Galaxy, both teams speaking quietly to the other, or throwing insults at each other, as Tony and Peter argued of the source of the Starlord’s abysmal intellect. Thor approved of this.
“And there are no Gods on Earth”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Thor” Frigga began.
The Man of Iron’s features twisted as he stared at the bands with barely concealed distaste. The man swallowed thickly; hands frozen around the bread basket as he struggled to regain his composure. “Ok so you put a ring on it, that’s lovely. Anyone want more bread?”
“Mother
“Thor” The Captain said in greeting, a small gentle smile that made the God’s heart leap and flutter in his chest.
“Aye, Steven wished to see our friends before they must part.” Thor confided, following the blonde pair to the great halls where they would break their fast with their friends and subjects before smiling a besotted, shy thing to his Husbands back “And I find myself reluctant to deny him anything at all.”
Thor hurried to divest in the dark marbled room, near falling in the steaming baths as he struggled to undo his mother’s work. Even now seeming to Thor to be on purpose to dissuading the marriage consummation. And Thor quickly shook his head of that, the implications too dark and horrible to dwell on in such a time as this. Once in the nude Thor produced the bag he had ordered be placed in the rooms, gleeful to find it resting snugly by the towels and toiletries.
Barton grinned mischievously “I could say something, but it’s just too easy. Take care of yourself, Steve.”
-----
- husband to stay put. As he could feel in his soul, there where it was connected to the brave human, that he yearned to join the fight. To protect.
And Tony had just given everything away. It was only right, justice served even. One merchant of death for the pinnacle of freedom. Seemed fair.
Steve climbed one and observed the chaos. He saw the Hulk go head to head with the invulnerable giants and smash at them with vicious glee, giving relief to the soldiers on foot, but only while they did not encounter the Asgardian forces, whose armor didn’t even dent under the force of the bullets that rained on them, and were cutting their way forward in slow, but unrelenting paces.
Frigga nodded “I wish for that too”
Thor was both offended and vindicated as Frandal cried his outrage.
“I am fine, Captain”
Thor’s marriage had been set up for failure.
Steven broke into a quick sprint, his face set with determination and completely oblivious.
“Loki. Let’s change those bandages.” The Captain proceeded to gently peal the cloth, layer by layer, off the passive God, revealing angry wounds marring snow pale flesh on Loki’s regal features. Thor swallowed harshly at the sight, bile rising and threatening to burn him from within. This was his father’s doing. The same man that would hold them as infants and curl with them in their tiny cribs, undignified and uncomfortable, when they refused to fall asleep after a bad dream. The same who swore his very soul to protect them…
Silence took over the room. Fury met the shamed gaze of every man and woman in the room before sprawling onto his seat once more. “So, I’m all ears, Odin.
Steve returned the smile eagerly “My thoughts exactly.”
Steve tugged at the cloak with an abashed smile. “Yeah, I guess so. Still not a fan of capes though”
“I can taste the tension” Barton whispered loudly to Banner’s polite nod and Stark’s cutting glare.
And Steve; well, he never was one to turn down a challenge…
“Hey, wow, you’re…
“Tony, this… this is…” Steve rasped, an artist’s hand coming up to cover his trembling mouth.
No gods on earth, indeed.
“You will”
“Don’t thank me yet” The Archer shot back, an absolutely wicked smile on his face “We’ll see you at the bachelor party”
Loki glared at his blond companion, his unkept golden locks, his sunken eyes the only thing avoiding the slew of insults Loki felt bubbling in his chest. There would always be another chance for that.
Thor gave an evil grin and slid the baked curse past the magic protection, feeling the runes and spells shy away from the thing as if appalled by its existence, and straight to Loki’s eager hands.
Chapter 26: An Apple a Day
“Certainly, Mother”
“What, Steve?!” Tony yelled, nerves shot and wired “The holy spirit? Put your fucking hand down!”
Steve smiled when Thor joined him in the water, his unwilling arousal having mellowed out in the cold waves now slowly twitching back to life at the sight of the God and his loving touches. Bringing back the guilt he had beat down and turning his back to his tender husband to hide his growing erection. Which was all thrown to the curve when the God went ahead and copped a feel of him; his large, hot hand cupping his throbbing member just so, the callouses and the firmness of his palm fondling his flesh perfectly. And the jolt of the God’s own swollen cock slotting and thrusting along his cheeks, the flimsy fabric of his boxers doing nothing to dilute the feel of that large, hard cock pressed onto him, sending a shiver down his spine; the feeling of Thor’s body fitting along the curves of his own, his warmth and solidity. Steve nearly dissolved into putty in the God’s hands, a shock of lust so harsh he couldn’t help but gasp and still. Then the God whispered those filthy words into his ear.
Tony swirled, finding a smirking Nick Fury leaning on the open door with a satisfied, cat with canary kind of expression that made Tony’s skin crawl.
Steven smiled at the threat and settled into pose again “Yes ma’am.”
-----
Thor nodded wholeheartedly “Thousand-fold. Any other Midgardian traditions to be had, husband?”
“I take it he liked it”
The widow nodded placatingly “They’ll come around; they always do” She smiled then, secretively “Word on the streets says that the Captain is going to make a surprise appearance”
“Hey Thor!” Clint shouted over his shoulder, right into Banners ear “Tomorrow! Spar! You and me!”
Norn’s above, but Steven was gorgeous. In the soft shadows of their tent, only the moonlight shining shyly through the laps of curtains; his husband was a sight to behold and
“Steven.” Thor greeted from his crouch on the floor, his mind halting from it’s frantic whirring now that it had something far more important to latch onto than his incestuous faux pas.
“Th-thanks, really.” Quill turned to gaze at his teammates in similar shock “Wow, dinner with the God’s. If Yondu could see me now.”
The rest of the breakfast went pretty uneventful, until they began to pick up the table and Cooper managed to spill a tar of jam on Steve before he could help the boy with his load. The boy’s bottom lip wobbled dangerously as he flushed deep red and eyes watered. Steve felt a shot of panic and scrambled to his side.
Only one person could be that clever. Loki hid an ugly smile as he recognized the Queen’s halls and dutifully walked by the Captain to the gardens.
Steve jolted out of his horrified reverie and barked: “Avengers!”
The All Mother sneered at her beloved husband in irritation “That is a man, not an allowance.”
Thor laughed heartily at the woman’s playful words “I would tolerate nothing less.” Then the God turned to the final, silent member of the Avengers. Thor stepped up to the morose Man of Iron, back straight and shoulders tight.
“I have my orders” The General said “I will obey my god”
“My love” She greeted him.
The noble man blinked and stammered, clearly not accustomed to being denied “Listen?”
Heimdall squared his shoulders and sprung forth, bringing his sword down with all his might several times, watching in fascination how the Worthy one spun and duked with incredible speed and grace, Mjolnir a distracting feature in his hands, humming with godly power, waiting.
“That’s ringing some bells” Tony quipped, bringing a mocking hand to his ear “Anyone else hear them? Sounds awfully familiar, so much déjà vu.”
Another round of laughter and the man mounted the animal, another opening the metallic door as the Bull sprung forward. Its leap being cut short abruptly and forcing it back in a violent flip. The Beast landed in a cloud of dirt and screams of pain, as the vulgar man was crushed under the weight.
“Yes Thor?” Steven inquired sullenly, raising his embarrassed eyes to meet Thor’s and startling at the sight of the God’s face.
-----
Sif laughed softly, feeling a release in her soul as she spoke, all truths she had not wanted to face and now, standing before the man she had wanted to call her rival, gazing into her eyes with such care and open acceptance, she could finally let go “He is so much more
Thor crossed the Royal chamber halls in meditative silence, descending in an almost dreamlike state to the lowest level in the dungeons to a particular holding cell. There, behind hundreds of intricate spells and runes, laid his brother. Loki’s face was smoothened in sleep, near innocent in appearance if not for the little twitch that would curve his fine lips into a croaked smile or snarl, reminding Thor that Loki, God of Lies and Mischief, was at his most dangerous when he appeared to be most harmless. Thor could attest to this by the many stab wounds he sustained as they grew up together.
Tony growled, pressing his hands on her breasts and massaging them in wide, kneading circles. She gasped and fell back onto the couch, her back curved in an obscene arch, pushing her sensitive breasts into his calloused hands. Tony ran his tongue over her sternum, getting two handfuls of that green fabric and ripping.
“Has he any inclination for the fine arts? Or is this in preparation for his introduction to the court?”
“Your highness”
“No, Thor. I’m not.”
“It’s ok buddy” Stark consoled. “I believed you, back to the peanut gallery with you. Now, who’s next?”
to protect our planet and attacked it within the year.” Fury recriminated, a dry smile parting his lips as he stared directly into Odin’s now unreadable eye, ignoring the twitches and nervous fidgeting of the councilmen all around “For what? A delay in negotiations?” The Director barked a humorless laugh and yelled “You have no word!”
But Norn’s, Steven was more beautiful than he remembered.
The morning after the fever had abandoned Steven’s skin, Thor lay wide awake, blinking tiredly and smiling quietly to himself as he rested his bearded chin on his husband’s shoulder. The Captain had fallen back to sleep after whatever horrible dream had woken him and been peacefully resting ever since.
“Release my magic, then” Loki sneered back, irritation hiding the real horror that lay under.
Chapter 4: Jane
Heimdall’s eyes flashed as the skies parted and three Destroyers were materialized onto Earth. The reporters scrambling away, cameras forgotten in their mad rush to safety.
At that moment, in the silent Darkness of Asgards dungeons, The Queen and Mother of Gods stood mutely before her son’s cell, face pale and fallow.
“You’re not”
Steve smiled and waved as both uncle and nephew disappeared to the far end of the planet in a flash of laughter and slashes.
With a minute nod Jane rose from his lap. “Goodbye, Thor”
(See the end of the chapter for
And thus Thor leapt once more to the skies, followed by angered cries.
“I just gave you the tools and motivation to do it”
Stark did a spit back and coughed in rattling surges, battling to dislodge the whiskey from his windpipes. Thor smirked and patted the man’s back and jolting smacks.
After a rather short and awkward class with Master Bragi, Steve ambled back to his bedroom with sagging feet, ready to call the day off and sleep it’s troubles out.
Tony seethed at that. “You little…”
Quill gritted his teeth and fisted his hands up, preparing for a fight “Shut up, it’s just one dude, we can take him”
not deserve a chance to live?”
What a strange conversation, but it was offensively early in the morning, no light shining out still. So who was Thor to judge what the Captain had in his mind at the hour.
“He has lifted the Hammer” Heimdall said “He is worthy”
“Steven?”
Until, of course, life came bellowing.
Tony knew that ass…
Tony snorted loudly, trying to convey more security than he actually felt “I hardly think Big Daddy up there will start a war over the Captain, when we all know he offered that just to shut you up. He’ll be relieved to have this thing over with.”
Heimdall watched him, unblinking “You will come with me then?”
“Thank you, Thor.”
“Aye, these are unfortunate circumstances”
And the heavens flashed in rainbow lights above.
“Shut up, Loki.”
Steve was trying, he really was. Feeling the bond of their souls, picturing in his mind the leash that bonded Loki’s ‘Sedir’ to him by Odin’s will and trying to ignore the other end of the bond, where Thor’s essence blended seamlessly to his own in a swirl of hurt and regret that made it even harder for Steve to be angry. Which, surprisingly, only made him angrier.
“Go ’way…”
Thor opened his mouth to explain why exactly that was not a good idea, crawling back onto his wedded bed in a hurried scuttle but Loki was far faster, scribbling in his elegant script and shoving it back to the unsuspecting Soldier. Who read the text, flushed a furious crimson and promptly dropped the pad on the mattress.
Chapter 9: The Broken
“You can tell yourself I forced you to agree, but you know better, the words left your mouth, not mine”
Thor had said he was happy to be married to him.
“You have known my people; we do not fear the other. You would suffer no scorn in Asgard.” Thor vowed to the troubled Doctor before laying a comforting hand to the smaller man’s shoulder “But you must not decide now, a thought for better times, my friend?”
Thor smiled tightly to his sullen mother, coming forth and placing a parting kiss to her furrowed brow “Good night, Mother mine”
“All the more reason to hurry”
The man spluttered and turned to the crowd of Midgard rulers who now had a calculating gleam in their eyes that made Thor weary.
Steven pulled his hand back as if he’d been stung, his expression pursed and fighting between amusement and despair, finally settling on a stern look as he turned away from his giggling husband to finish his dressing out of their wedded room “That’s it, don’t touch my records again.”
Jormungandr’s eyes followed the Soldier, tongue slithering out again in a quick flash, almost a greeting as his eyes shone with something akin to amusement.
So when he arrived to the class room where Steven partook in his lectures, he was well prepared for the rush of want when seeing his intended bent over a furiously scribbling Master Bragi. Both men raised their heads to the sound of the grand doors bursting open. One in quiet pleasure, the other carefully blank.
Thor was cut from answering the prompt by Stark shouting from the other side of the room: “No, no, no. It’s my wedding, Thor can’t have it!”
Not a second later, an explosion as Asgard had never seen before, quaked the earth beneath their feet, glass shattering above and pillars cracking under the force of the backfire.
Odin and Frigga sampled the sumptuous meats and gave an approving nod, and thus, the celebration truly began. The cooks came forth and carved the gigantic beast to serve the portions to the royal table and then fed those in attendance.
Until Steve was ready.
“What Captain?” Drax cried, shifting to stare at his companions and his enemies in a confused state “We came for the Siren!”
“Calm yourself, Stark” The spy drawled, completely unperturbed at the threat of losing his only eye. “He’s safe, I had to take some precautions, you see. You’re a bit of a loose cannon” Nick strolled past him, siting in the chair where not 5 hours ago Steve had sat, shoulders slumped, and eyes dulled. “Wasn’t sure you would come through”
Asgardian blood did not mix well with Earthlings, he had learnt this well.
None did.
Thor heaved a relieved sigh, shoulders slumping as the weight of pending rejection lifted and he swiftly pulled at his thick leather belt and brought it up to his husband’s lips “Bite this”
Thor felt the plea cleave his heart, that was the width of it wasn’t it? To free Steven of that tight confinement his wholesome ways caged him in. His honorable Soldier who would not burden another with his troubles.
“Maybe he missed the invite?” Barton sent a sharp look at the man of Iron, who was now reaching for his drink back, his face back to his tan hue, if a bit flushed, and avoiding everyone’s eyes.
Thor shrugged nonchalantly and raised his tankard to the Captain with a winning grin “To us”
“Well done, Captain!” The Giant commended, swaying slightly on his knees as he grinned and patted the Captain’s cheek with overbearing affection “You are as stubborn as those creatures Thor adores”
“And Hogun, general of war and mightiest swordfighter of the land” Thor boomed, winking at his usually shy friend as he smiled kindly at his Betrothed, his thin eyes shinning at the praise from his Lord.
A dark, tall man with an eyepatch emerged from behind a pillar, a small weapon pointing squarely at the other human’s head.
“If you would give us but a minute” The Master demanded, taking Steven’s hands and turning them over in his owns, not even asking for permission as he pulled at the Soldiers fingers and rolled his wrists in intense scrutiny. Steven blinked down at the man but did not stop him, then turned to Thor in silent askance.
“Captain, it is an honor” Hogun murmured.
Thor seethed silently, glaring at the female representative of an European country belt out, gearing others around her into another angry round of demands. Odin stood silent as more and more restless humans shouted out demands of physical evidence and shows of faith and public agreements that made Thor’s head pound and ache in beat to their angry screams.
! He had not had the heart to tell Steven, the darling Captain so proud next to his ungodly concoction; listing all his troubles to obtain the right ingredients for the crust to be just crisp enough. And setting the temperature in the tiny kitchenette oven; how do you put the right settings to
“I’m really sorry Tony”
“Yes, it is” Stark quipped.
“Of course” Steve agreed, lips trembling with the effort to remain serious and
For once in a long, long time, Tony dearly hoped it was his guns they were using.
“Trapped”
Thor loved him even more.
“No, I’m here for the important stuff”
Thor growled but listened, nonetheless. The man had managed to please Steven, so maybe it was not all for naught in the end. Even if he had to grit his teeth to dust to avoid punching his friend in the balls. Which reminded him…
He began to thrust into her, soft now, lingering. A long, sensuous rolling of his hips, drawing out near all his length, teasing her little quim with the bulbous head of his cock, then pressing in slow, but unrelenting, until he hit her end and then he pressed further, making way for himself inside her, knowing how she enjoyed the little shocks of near cramping pleasure when he knocked inside, just so, just like this.
The first thing he did when he saw the Warrior Three was to take Frandal by the throat and
Would she be proud of him? Tall and strong as he was, his hands stained with the blood of more men than he could count…

“Captain America!” A man shouted, jarring Steve out of his silent mourning. The Captain turned, finally noticing the Jet with the Council Women and Men having landed some feet away, over a pile of charred bodies no less. Steve felt bile rise to his throat, then he glanced at General Ross, approaching with a smug, starstruck grin in his face.
The answering cries of delight were loud enough to nearly make Steve deaf, but he laughed gamely at the doctor’s joke, happy that he was beginning to feel comfortable enough to cause mischief with the children. To not be constantly crippled with the fear of himself. And if a couple of laughs at his expanse was the price to pay for that, he thought that wasn’t half bad a deal.
“Thor.” He breathed, clenching his fingers onto the God’s arms, stalling him. The God gave one last peck to his lovely lips before rolling off and settling down to his side; large, grand smile and flushed face for his stunned husband as he turned the lights off with a flick of a wrist.
The All Father walked up to the stand, where the voice man stayed pale in face and scrambled to give way as Odin settled face to face of the now nervous Earthlings.
At the 7 months mark he received the news that Stark’s house had been attacked. The man of Iron’s body not found.
Steven’s smile grew at the other’s pouting “Please?”
“I’ve killed him this time, I’m sure of it…” Thor wheezed, eyes wild and sorrowful as he shook his head frantically, soaked, golden locks falling onto his face as he curled into himself with a whimper “All this blood, it won’t come off…”
“You know I’ll do it, don’t test me, Gramps.” Tony warned them, all fun and games evaporated from his posture and only the hard, cold blooded business man left to deal the blows “I’ll have him in a star spangled thong faster than you can say ‘America’…”
” Clint clapped his hands together, face hard and serious as he eyed his teammates “who gets to walk Captain America down the aisle?”
“I would do anything and everything in my power to see that Asgard reigns supreme.” Odin stated. “You were young still when my father and I forged this kingdom, you have not known the true strife and anguish of war.”
Steve punched and pushed his way to the Kings chambers, ripping a stolen sword from one of the inmates hands that had tried to cut him short and ended cleaved by his own weapon when Steve had spun and tripped the man on his march through the brawling hallways.
“But then you killed a Bilgesnipe.”
Thor’s shoulders slumped, all his sensuous thoughts of the Captain gone as the earlier meeting came ringing back. Thor knew his failings, he carried them close to his heart so he would never forget and ever struggling to do more, be better, be worthy. Now he saw that it was still for naught.
Moments later, a brave, stupid soul dared to lay a hand on his shoulder. Heimdall opened his eyes and glared. The slim, tall man fell backwards in convulsing wails, his eyeballs pouring out of their sockets in red viscous gushes.
Last night had been a blur of sadness, of gripping touches and hungry lips. He had never touched another like he had last night, much less a man; Jacques stolen kisses usually ended in Bucky or Dum Dum pulling the man aside and waving a gun under his nose. Not that it summed up to anything; as soon as they survived another ill-fated attack to Hydra Headquarters the man would be pawing at Steve, or any one of them really, to re assert his surviving the impossible.
Chapter 27: The Hunting Trip
Steven nodded “Ok, that’s nice”
“Just like that?” Gasped the man in disbelieve. As if Asgard had need of anything Midgard could offer. Heimdall nodded, nonetheless.
That night he tossed and turned restlessly in his bed, thoughts spinning a suffocating web in his mind, like an itch he wouldn’t scratch least he uncover the rotting, worm filled innards of his doubts.
“Huh, you certainly got the hair right…” Steven mused with a grin, slowly stepping away from the looming, ragging God.
Of course, Steven would assume he worried for his mother, this gnawing guilt that clung to his chest. Bringing him here to share bread with her and see with his own eyes that she was well was just a typical kindness from this man… Loki felt a tug, a shot of emotion from this gentle gesture that took him back near a century ago.
“Will you, really?” Sam asked, his voice calm and reasonable, Steve could almost picture him in his chair, face open and welcoming, understanding.
He sighed when he laid the God on the couch, leaving him to happily drool onto the dark leather while he faced his justifiably enraged fiancé.
Would anyone have heard the fall? Would anyone notice when the prickly old man failed to show for his groceries?
Thor pursed his lips and giggled.
What else had she to be ashamed of? She had never been worthy anyways.
“This is amazing Thor”
He tranqued his Godly ass.
“Can they stay in my room? I have sleeping bags!” The little boy pleaded, still latched on tight to Bruce’s hand and not willing to let go.
His inquiries went unheard as the table continued to fawn over the wedding rings, aliens and human’s alike muttering about the bands in excited musings.
Bruce remained frozen still, like a deer in headlights, looking at the little boy wrapped around his thighs with barely concealed terror. He mumbled something like yes and the boy lost his little mind. His mouth shot off a 100 miles a minute, prattling happily about his last Halloween costume and his beloved Hulk fists that glowed green and roared when smashed together. He promptly released his legs and latched on to Bruce’s irresponsive hand, pulling him along to show him his beloved Hulk fists.
Thor roared unintelligibly, lightning echoing in the heavens like a threat. Tony swallowed dryly. No jokes then.

Steve pushed on, eyes insistent and hard “I win… I get a day.” The General cocked his head to the side slowly, almost mechanically, his golden gaze burning though Steve refused to back down, he extended his hand “One day to put my affairs in order. Then I’ll call for you.”
Gamora nodded dutifully “Will my sister be freed. Your Highness?”
Tony let out a shaky breath, to grateful to put it into words. So, he used his body.
There were screams and Midgardian weapons cocking.

“I’ve not the slightest idea, but Loki spoke of it very fondly once.”
She came with a gasp and a full shiver, her pearly skin breaking into goosebumps as her innards milked Tony, almost drinking from his cock, and he lost it too. Pressed her hard against the marble wall and shoved up into her, once, twice, and there.
They could not have been more wrong…
“Shut up” The Captain barked, red-face and mortified as he argued his point to a ravenous God “You saw the suit! It just kept bunching up and… Shut up”
“Odin, my love”
“Wait, don’t listen to him!” The Racoon cried, jumping onto the tree’s shoulder in a startle “Groot, we’re out of here! I told you it was a stupid idea, Quill!”
Howard had been on his way to deliver his version of the Super Soldier Serum, the closest approximation to the one that had made Captain America. He had sold it off for the one thing Tony never could’ve imagined possible.
Cries of outrage shook the hall, some of the court stepping forth menacingly. Thor gripped Mjolnir’s handle, the phantom feel of Steven’s soul pushing steadily, still unexperienced against his own enough to steel him for what awaited them.
Thor shook his head in agitation “You do not understand the implications of this act, what it has brought upon us.” He was screaming by the end, eyes wild and flashing, then his voice began to break “The Captain, Steven he…”
Steve found himself on the marbled floor once it was over, the remains of his cape shredded under his fingers, strips of it scattered in the floor. Like claws had been taken to the fabric in vicious snipes.
Steve clenched his jaw “No, I don’t think I will”
Steve sighed as the booted feet began to kick on his coverlet “Let him up Thor, I want to sleep. I have an early day tomorrow.”
Now I banish myself back to homework, bye bye my dearests!
Thor recalled the times as they grew together, Loki and him, how they were both considered Crown Prince as the younger’s claim to the throne, simply by being borne of Odin’s own flesh, was equal and for some, far superior to Thor’s first-born status. Of course, this went away with the reveal of Loki being a Jotun prince. But if not for that, who would dare question Odin’s word for it?
Frigga blinked “Why would he ever…”
“You will look precious in your wedding dress”
Pepper sighed as he breached her from behind, slowly feeding her hole with his cock, feeling it clench and suck him in deeper, embracing his length as he went balls deep.
Said God landed in the ruins of the Halls of healing. Eyes flaming and Hammer buzzing with barely repressed power.
Steve felt like a toddler scurried along by his Mother’s skirts.
“But this is
Still, every night, Thor gave them rain; and they in turn, gave him kindness.
Steven turned and blinked at the agitated God, whose smile bordered on manic. Heimdall wisely stepped aside without uttering a word.
Suddenly a slender hand smacked smartly against his unsuspecting face. Steve blinked against the sting as he resurfaced. Well that was unnecessary.
Thor slid to the stone floor, tears streaming down his bearded cheeks unapologetically.
Chapter 17: Courting
The General nodded, his face slack with awe as Steve commanded the men to form a front before the stairs. Steve barely startled as two grown men in catsuits joined him in the line. He nodded in acknowledgement and lifted his shield “Soldaten! Auf mein signal!”

Outside, the maids squealed as the loud sounds of furniture shifting about violently and hard thuds of heavy bodies hitting the walls rose once again from the bedding rooms. The Guards flushing and shifting as the commotion grew louder, crashes and grunts joining the fray and culminated with a harsh cut off roar.
“Here, husband.” Thor spouted hurriedly, purposely obtuse while shoving the fruit to the startled Captain’s chest “A gift from Idunn’s trees.”
Thor both envied and rejoiced in his friend’s resilience. He could only hope that time would take the same grace with him. Sooner rather than later.
i feel like i should mention this book is a slow-burn? like theres a ton of bonding and repairing. nothing really happens instantaneously, ya know?
"You were right."
'Panic attack.'
"He might as well be his dad, considering I'm gonna fuck him over." Tony pushed away from his desk and stood up, going to work on random upgrades for the team.
"Why are you here, Peter?"
Peter squeezed his hand tightly, smiling up at him. Lila leaned onto Cooper's other side, Cooper's arm tight around him. "We'll be alright, right Coop?"
"It was fine."
"What the fuck, Tony?"
Cooper smiled and scooped up his little sister and carried her into the courthouse. Laura was sitting with Nathaniel when she spotted the almost complete family. She glared at Cooper.
"And you Barnes-" Sam hissed.
. And Tony thought Steve looked broken after their first fight. Tony's heart was beating miles a minute. "Can we talk?"
"I wasn't involved in the idea of that bullshit lapdance. Wasn't even good." Peter snorted.
"Great, kiddo." Tony kissed his hair. "Can we talk, kid?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Two..."
"Y-Yeah," Peter breathed, suddenly finding interest in his sock-covered feet.
"Hey, hey, it's okay, bud, it's okay. I accept you. Wholeheartedly."
Clint held onto Peter, helping him keep his balance. Peter half-stumbled-half-was-dragged to the balcony. Once the cold Manhattan air hit Peter's face, Peter collapsed against the railing, one hand still gripping onto Clint's wrist.
