"Are we there, yet?" Natasha asked for the millionth time making Steve sigh and glance at the twenty years old female, which was playing with his phone while chewing gum.
Steve and Tony got a routine of their own now, something that made Tony happy, it really made him happy that Steve can drop his son at Tony's home without being stress when Sarah or Winnie wasn't in their respectable homes (Thanks to Clint and him voting for Tony being the babysitter of the whole neighborhood) Saturday and Sunday were spent at the clinic, with Steve and Peter going to their therapist and Tony going to his before going to the children's section to take care of the kids, a lot of whom Peter made friends with, chattering happily with them and playing, even listening to their stories and getting to know them, Tony can say that Steve always feels proud that his son was reaching out, the Alpha became one of the volunteers.
Part of Tony was wondering why he didn't just go to the lake, part of Tony was sure that if Tony managed to summon the monster, Steven Rogers may answer his questions. If what Angie said was true and that Rogers was also a victim then he wouldn't hurt Tony, he may even answer him, right? Another part, the one that still believed that Steven Rogers would take his Morgan as soon as he saw her hissed at that thought; Tony didn't have it in him to disagree, no one, not even the victims of this town are as innocent as they appeared to be.
The quiet was more unnerving than the stumping and breaking glass Tony heard, causing his heart to pound in his chest at the thought that the intruder discovered Tony's plan and now is after his baby. "I know you are here!" The furious voice of Peggy Carter caused Tony to inhale sharply, any new plan he was about to make was forgotten at the sound of the woman's voice. "I gave you enough time to come to the kids' room to wake them up." Carter continued, unaware of Tony being frozen in his hidden place, shock and horror of what could have happened to Peter and Harley had the woman found his babies made nausea nearly overcome him. "…I will let you and your son, leave Mr. Stark, I promise you that, just hand me Peter and everything is going to be alright." That snapped Tony out of his daze and he gazed at the closet door like it was the answer to this unsavory situation, his hand going to his belly caressing it as he tried to calm himself.
"Please Mama; can Papa stay here tonight, please?" Peter hugged Tony's legs looking at the Omega with big brown eyes, begging the Omega to say yes, that made Tony let out a sigh and look at Steve with a small frown.
He told her about her and Daniel's death, and how he spent years grieving for the family he lost. He told her about meeting Tony and marrying, spending seven years with the love of his life, and falling pregnant in the end. He told her about Bucky coming into his and his husband's life, and how Tony started pulling away from him. He told her about the stalker and Bucky, about the pained and shocking discovery that ended up with Steve running for his life only for his car to be hit by Bucky who was delusional and wanted him for himself. He told her more and more until his throat ran dry and he went through a whole jug of water.
Starkad huffed as he walked around the house, looking for the Omega with a frown on his face when he didn't find him. It has been a month since he allowed the Omega to go and see his little friends, what was supposed to be a one-time thing turned out to be an everyday affair as the Omega either went to check on his friends, or they come into his house to check on the Omega, and it was driving the Alpha a little mad because no matter how much he screamed at them to not come to his house they always show on the second day, and not only did the Omega took it as his chance to run loose and start slacking in his work, he didn't listen to him anymore.
"I know that it hurt Steve, but you need to move on, this will only hurt you in the end." Tony said as he leaned toward Steve, which made the Alpha growl at him and back away as he sends the Omega a harsh glare.
"What happened to your face?" That was Tony's scathe reply when he found them later making Bucky press his lips shut, tightly; Steve who was treating the wound send Tony a harsh look, causing the Alpha to huff and look away for a second. "The police are on their way." Tony stated as he went to the fridge, getting a cool bottle of water. "I went through the security feed too, found someone suspicious lurking around the house, but couldn't see his face due to the strange face mask and hat he was wearing." Tony growled as he opened the cap, causing Steve to shift uncomfortably.
The sound of the British voice made Tony blink and look at the mask near him and pick it up, looking at it, he didn't answer the AI, and the AI didn't ask him back, he just stored the information for a later date. Tony raised the mask to his face and looked through the mask's eyes, humming a little as he inspect the room while wearing the mask, though his heart skip a beat when his eyes fell on the doorway, because there Steve was, crossing his arms over his chest and leaning on the door, an unimpressed look on his face when he was gazing at Tony. "S-Steve…" Tony stuttered and nearly ripped the mask off and run to the Omega, but the Omega shook his head when he tried to lower his mask, which made Tony freeze in his place and gazes at the Omega.
"You called for me?" Steve's voice answered him, making Tony shriek and jump when the voice came from behind him, causing him to whirl around and gaze at Steve who was grinning happily, just like a cat who got the cream. "You are the first person who was able to cross inside my room, every other one that dared to, nearly died.
"I knew you will say this Mr. Stark, that's why I prepared a surprise for you… say hello for your little family." Zemo nodded his head and the screen behind him start playing a video feed, gazing up, Tony felt like the life was already draining from his face when he saw that Steve and Peter were tied up in Steve's room, Tony was unaware of his team letting out a shocked gasps, he wasn't even aware that Bucky started snarling as he threatened Zemo as he tried to find a way out of the cage they were in. Steve's face has a deep dark bruise on his jaw, while Peter was shaking uncontrollably as he hides behind Steve who was glaring at the man standing in front of him. "What an interesting little family you have Mr. Stark, I was impressed that you were able to hide them for so long, it wasn't until one of my men followed you around that we discovered your little dirty secret… Rumlow!" The man snapped which made 'Rumlow' who was standing beside Steve walk to the Omega and the pup, which made the small boy let out a whine when the man pulled Steve from his hair and directed him to the camera.
"What the fuck is going on here?" Peggy snarled and Steven winces at her loud voice, entering the room hoping that the wolves didn't attack her before Steven save her… reaching Peggy, Steven's eyes widen when he heard the loud sound of bones breaking, and then suddenly the two wolves that were there turned into humans… Steve and Tony to be exact, while Tony was glowing red with embarrassment, Steve was crossing his arms around his chest but he was not looking at Peggy's eyes, what made Steven's eyes widen though, was that both men were naked as the day they were born, which made Steven turn his gaze away from the two, face turning red with embarrassment as the realization of what took a place not a few seconds ago hit him with a new light… "You what?" Peggy's screams made Steven blink his eyes returning to the conversation once again.
Steve swallowed at that and went to Jarvis touching him on the shoulder. "Come with me, let's bring them coffee," Steve stated, making Jarvis paused a little looking at the group, he let out a tired sigh and followed Steve who went to the staff room to brew coffee.
Tony grinned widely as he walked through the alley, a skip in his steps and an ax in his hand, humming happily as he tried to find his prey for the night; an idiot by the name Zemo. A bastard who tried to fabricate a video of Steve killing his parents hoping to initiate a split in the Avengers; all in the name of sweet revenge so he can steal Steve away. What an idiot! Did the bastard really think that Tony was going to hurt the love of his life for something as nasty as his parents? For all Tony care, the two of them can fuck into limbo and Tony wouldn't pat an eyelash; Tony knew he wouldn't pat an eyelash, especially being the one who sends them to the other world with Hades not five years ago.
Tony repositioned himself slightly and with every thrust, he hit Steve's prostate, dead on. The omega knew he wouldn't be able to last much longer, but he refused to come without Tony's knot buried inside of him. Steve knew just what to do to make that happen.
"Oh honey, is this all for me?" Tony asked, grunting when Steve took hold of his cock; Tony turned his head to the side kissing Steve's neck, it was a few seconds later before Tony starts running his hands through the slick, letting out a moan when the scent of his aroused mate became stronger and stronger.
"He is with you for half a year now, right? Did he improve in that time?" Tony asked as he leaned on the tree behind him, causing Betty to hum and title her head in deep thought. The Beta looked like she was a step ahead from ranting and complaining about her job, which by then Tony would have let her do it.
The sound of the alarm going off made him jump from his seat, heart pounding in his chest; he stood up and went to the sticks that he arranged on the desk, his breath hitching as he put his hand on the first stick…
He was told what happened after he went to his death… how they won the war… only to go into another war with another country called Vietnam, how they won most of those battles, but lose so much at the same time... and went to another war, and another... and another… how Peggy and Howard worked together to create an origination that was called 'Shield', how they created it to help people from all around the world, and stop any threats that were going to befall their earth… he was told how 'Project Rebirth' had affected all those who witness it that day… how those scientists and doctors and soldiers who were with Steve on that fateful night changed… it was a slow thing that no one notice, until years and years later… how their lifespan was longer than their fellow friends, how they seemed to age slower than everyone else, how they are stronger now, better, healthier… that this was the reason why Peggy and Howard looked in their early forties instead of their late seventies…
"Don't be an idiot Rogers, you cut one head, two shall take its place, you get out of this door, and you will alert Hydra, they have people in high places, which can have you behind the bars before you even took a step outside. So get your head out of your ass and stand down." Steven said which made Peggy come and pull Steve away making the Alpha growl at the brown-haired woman.
"My deepest apology Ancient One, but it seems that I have an urgent matter in Asgard I need to attend to." Thor gave a soft smile to Steve, causing the star to hum and nod his head still looking at Thor's battle attire. "I cannot take you with me, for the Bifrost cannot handle but one soul; I do promise that I will be fast to return." Thor reassures the star, causing him to let out a hum.
Tony shiver at the cold breeze that hit him; Winter was coming. Finally Tony arrived at his house, gazing around the place, blinking his eyes when he took in the place; nothing changed, everything was still the same as he left it back then. Taking a deep breath, Tony gather the courage to walk toward the house, taking in the gardens, taking in the house, and lastly, he took in the lake.
The sound of chocked whimper made Tony stop and look at the pup that was shaking, looking at Tony with fear and sadness, and Tony had to swallow and stand on his shaky legs, walking toward the pup and ignoring the groaning man, and the people that tried to drag him away from the pup, but no one really touched him, they were scared, a protective Omega can be worse than a feral Alpha. Tony kneeled near the pup his heartbreaking a little as he heard the hitched breath and saw the pup took a step back away from Tony.
?' as he gazed at Fury like the man sported seven new heads and start talking alien; because surely, Fury did not just tell him the fastest way to die and have his soul ripped from him.
"Sorry to say that, kid, but you are out of luck," Tony stated in a bored voice as he raised his finger to poke the baby's cheek, mainly to annoy the kid and cause it to cry nothing out of affection or anything. "Ouch! What the hell?" Tony squeaked when the kid held his fingers in a strong fist (Stronger than any baby that wasn't the hulk's) before biting his finger.
Steve walked passed this room every night, every night sleep refuses to come to him, every night he felt suffocated by the ice in his lungs, every night he felt like he was about to breakdown. Steve didn't know why, but it was probably because fatigues, and not being able to sleep for four days. But that day… that day, Steve stood outside of that room. Looking at the dark brown door that had a little chipped paint on the sides, Steve raised his hand and put it on the handle; he thought about leaving, that the door was closed, that he shouldn't invade the privacy of this room… but something was calling him inside…
Petrus was left fidgeting in his place, looking down at his feet while sneaking glances at the Omega through his curls. It ended with Steven giving the small pup a gentle smile, which did nothing but bring a flush that painted itself on Petrus' cheeks, and the boy looked down as fast as he can, trying not to show Steven his flushed face. "Y-your highness…" Petrus mumbled, and Steven's heart gave a pang at the self-conscious tone the boy used.
"Dad…" Tony whispered, pressing his lips tightly before smiling softly and shaking his head. "We know…" Tony laughed, smiling at the shocked look crossing over his father's face, the
"What did you do?" Bucky snarled in Howard's face, if it wasn't for Peggy, the Alpha would have jumped Howard and pounded his head in the wall behind him, something that Tony wouldn't have minded at all. But Tony didn't care; he didn't move from Steve's side since reaching him, Tony just held Steve's hand tightly and begged him to hold on.
"T-the one that Captain America fought in the seventies?" The pup asked with wide eyes, and he couldn't even believe his ears, was the Alpha telling the truth? Were Hydra really back once again after years of everyone thinking they were gone, or maybe the Alpha was talking about the mythical creature with the five heads, which then it will be even better! He will ask the Alpha for one of that thing scales or even a photo of it to show it to Harry and Gwen, which the two of them will be so jealous!
"Yeah, his name is Steve Rogers." He let out a snort as he saw his father choke on his wine… will more of having to spit it out, but the man will say otherwise if someone asked him. The room became even more silent afterward. "I promised myself I will mate no one but him… shame, I am sure that Hammer is a good boy and all, but I already have an Alpha." Maria looked more confused and distress by the second. Tony was relishing in it.
"Oh, that? Nothing, baby, Mr. Stark was just teaching me a little Kung Fu moves to beat bullies!" Steve laughed nervously hoping that his son will believe him, it was a few seconds later that the baby squealed happily and rushed toward the Omega pulling his sleeves.
When he entered SHIELD, he shuddered as he saw everyone stopping what they were doing, staring at the Omega as a tense silence filled the air. The Omega swallowed and walked inside, wondering what was going on, wondering if everyone knew about his fight with Steve; the Omega continued to walk toward the place he remembered Peggy's office was at, hoping to find Steve there.
"Of course, Sir, what did you expect? And by the way, excuse me for being rude, but who are you?" Steven blinked at that lips twitching up into a smile against himself, the real Jarvis was really as sassy as the AI version of him; Steven saw the older or was he younger man? Look at him with suspicion in his face, which caused Steven to clear his throat.
She knew it was wrong of her to go to the Omega's house, to force herself on the Omega and the pup's hands after what Howard did to them, but she couldn't help it, she couldn't, she wanted to see the Omega who stole her son's heart, she wanted to see her grandchild, she wanted to say sorry because if she knew about Steve and Tony back then, she would have helped the two of them to run away from Howard even if it hurt her in the end, but she didn't, she didn't help, she didn't notice, she didn't care enough… it was her fault that the pup was sitting all alone on the front porch, tinkering with whatever it was in his small hands without his father by his side to help him and smile at him proudly when he did something right.
A small smile took over Steve face at thought of finally seeing his husband again, a shining light shined before his closed eyes and there was unbearable pain after, the last thing that crosses his mind was Tony's young face smiling when he heard the first love confession Steve told him years and years ago, before Pepper and Morgan, and Civil War, and Ultron…
"Are you Ok?" Maria asked when Steve walked around the corner to see Maria and trying to calm a shaking Tony and a crying Peter who was whimpering and whining all the while Tony was trying to calm him, Steve sighed at that and nodded his head to Maria which made the woman sigh and turn to Tony.
Dr. Ross was usually sitting on her normal seat humming a little to herself as she once again asked him that famous question that Tony wanted to scream every time he heard the doctor repeat at the start of every session. "How are you today?" She will ask after he got comfortable in his own chair, which made all the comfort that Tony manages to get disappear just like that.
The next two hours passed quickly, they were the fastest but at the same time, they were the slowest two hours of Tony's life. Sarah and Howard arrived at their home, Howard an hour before Sarah; both of them were excited and nervous at the same time. At first, when Tony told his father about the adoption, his father had looked confused, he looked like he wanted to open his mouth and argue with Tony about it being too much, about Tony already having a step-son so there is no need for another; Tony saw many emotions in his father eyes, emotions that made Tony fidget in his place and wait for his father to start speaking. In the end, Howard ended up sighing and looking at Tony, only asking him one question,
"Sleep…" Steve mumbled as he throws his pillow and blanket on the carpet arranging them in the way he used to when he slept in Tony's room pulling an all-nighter trying to fix Dummy, Goose, was sitting beside him waiting for him to finish so they could go to sleep.
"It doesn't matter if I am captured; I will be of no value to whoever takes me." Steven finally declared, leaning on the wall behind him and crossing his arms, overlooking the stammer that Thor did at such horrible words. "What you weren't told of, all the stars who fell were shining, those who seized them ensured of that, taking care of them, giving them hope, promising them sweet words that laced with poison underneath, and when the stars start glowing in this form once more, they were swiftly killed to extract the illuminating source of our magic; our hearts. In my case though, I almost petty the fool who wanted me, for even if they succeed in obtaining my heart, I'm not a glowing star. The most they can have of my magic is seventy years of existence before their death. What I fear is Midgard turning into a battleground if someone discovered a star is on your realm after six thousand years." Steven's remarks caused deafening silence to take place in the room, and Steven can see how everyone starts shifting uncomfortably by these words.
Until he felt his lungs burning, until he felt his body strain, until his breath was nothing but gasps, until his muscles protests... until his legs trip making Steve roll down the hill. Steve gave a groan of pain as he tried to sit, only to freeze as he saw Bucky standing before him, Bucky with his beautiful face that was as pale as death, Bucky who was wearing his blue coat, the last thing Steve saw him wearing, Bucky who didn't have his left arm… Bucky who was grinning at him, a dark look in his eyes, Bucky… Bucky who raised a bloodied knife… Steve didn't scream as the knife was thrust into his chest…
Steve turns to the small slip of paper and took it, ignoring Sam who slammed his head on the bar and Bucky who plead with Loki for another drink, only to get water thrown at his face. Steve sighed at his friends' antics and turn to the paper, reading it and rereading it with a sad look on his face, it was such a sad thing, and Steve knows that if it was him instead of the Omega, he would have burned the world, because Peter was his world, and losing him, it meant that Steve was going to lose his sanity.
/Warning/: This chapter contains cursing; darkness, horror elements, creepiness, torture, fluff, kissing, Steve and Tony are so in love! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
"Talk…" Steven hissed as they reached the workshop, glaring at the Alpha and taking a dark pleasure in the flinch the man let; serve him right! What did the man expect Steven to do after the accusation he throw in Steven's face, smile at him, and play coy? In fact, the man had a few seconds to talk before Steven rips his eyes out and throws them to the birds.
The walk was a long one, not because of the distance no, not one bit, but because Steven has to stop every five minutes or so, mainly to catch his breath. To Steven's surprise, the king stayed with him the whole time, looking more manic than ever with the dark look on his face that scared everyone passing; something that Steven knows was only a façade trying to hide his tiredness, it made Steven wonder what happens to the cocky and foolish king, only to roll his eyes and pull away from any of the king's affairs.
"The space stone; when I opened the portal to Midgard, the space stone start acting strangely before it shoots toward the stars, closing the portal after it." Nebula hate this, she always hates talking about her only failure and that was invading Midgard, she always hates how she was able to run away by the skin of her teeth, she always hates that every time Thanos taunt her, it was always by this failure of hers. "I have been reviewing the path the stone took for the past two years; it seems that the star-" The narrow eyes that Nebula received for calling the star without the title Thanos bestow made her bite the inside of her cheek, hating every minute of this. "-The Golden Bride Astral Form had passed near the portal when it opened, and because of that, the space stone reacts to The Golden Bride being nearby. We find the stone we find the Golden Bride." Nebula stated, trying not to shiver in fear when she saw her father smiling, it was the first time she saw him smile like this, like a predator who finally found his prey.
"Mama, what's going on?" Peter asked shakily, following Tony when the Omega finally opened the bedroom's window and stick his head out to look around before nodding his head when he saw the street empty and start walking around the room, collecting the bed's sheets before trying them into strong knots creating a long rope.
Tony hummed to himself happily as he left his room fully dressed, heading downstairs for breakfast, knowing that today was Steve's turn to make breakfast, which made the Omega hum happily at that, and a smile took over his face when his eyes fell on a sleepy Peter who was trying to stay awake in his chair, that made the Omega let out a soft chuckle as he made a B-ling toward the pup and gave him a kiss on the forehead causing the pup to purr happily and take a tight hold of Tony's shirt, leaning his head on Tony's chest, trying to sneak a few minutes of sleep, which made the Omega's heart warm at that and he held tightly into the pup, until Steve put the dishes on the table and call them out, making the Omega let go of the pup, but not before getting whines and complains from the small boy.
That was funny and sweet, but when Tony is seven months and wasn't allowed to do even the more boring work, it started to get annoying. Though, Tony doesn't blame his family for their overprotectiveness, especially, when Tony was a nerve wreck at the beginning of his pregnancy.
Whatever Steve was thinking of, it seemed that he reached a satisfying answer because he changed his direction to Peggy and stand in front of her with his hand extended to her for a dance. Peggy's eyes were wide as she took in Steve who stood in front of her which made Peggy glare dagger at Bucky who laughed nervously and backed away. It took Peggy a few seconds before she took Steve's hand with a smile; her eyes though, were hard as she promised Bucky death and pain when this was over…
"Yeah, I do." Rhodey said then took a step forward. "Why?" Rhodey asked as he saw the hope and sadness in Maria's eyes, Peggy was looking at him like a hawk as she walked around her office.
Steve huffed a laugh as he got out of the car and to his house, a huge grin taking a place over his face as he reached the door, opening it and humming a little to himself, feeling elation that he was finally able to put Howard Stark in his place after all these years. The only regret Steve had was that he didn't do this sooner, and if given the chance he will do it once more, but that thought was for another time because for now, he has to return to his home and give his baby the tightest hug out there. Steve reached the door toward his house, opening the door with his keys and then went inside closing the door behind him, a skip in his steps as he went toward the sound of laughter, smiling happily when he saw Peter playing with Ben and George, May was talking happily with Winnie and Becca, probably telling them about the first time she met Steve and the years after it.
It seems that Tony looked pathetic and miserable enough that Bucky 'I don't give a fuck about anyone but my family, Steve, and his son' Barnes asked him what the fuck was wrong with him, which ended up with Tony laughing miserably and just saying Steve… which made the other Alpha wince… because if anyone knows how Steve is, it will be the one who lived all of his life with the Omega…
And that was a mistake because not a few seconds after that, a shape rises up from the lake. A head cocked to one side, its features obscured by a tangle of dirty hair, lake water dripping down its broad shoulders. It crawls forward, hands digging into the dirt for purchase as it drags itself along, the dying fire limning its moon-pale skin, as the creature dragged the lower half of its body out of the water. The weight of its body sliding across the grass is a low susurrus, its trailing legs gouging into the dirt as he climbs up, moving slowly towards the fire bit.
But as always screaming at Rogers meant that he got screamed at by Bucky. He seemed to take it as his place to protect Rogers from him, the man even did a slid show about how Tony was too harsh on Rogers, and that he was holding Steve back from recovering, which made Tony growl at the team and curse Barnes seven ways to hell. If the man was too blind to see how Rogers was, then Tony wouldn't care when Bucky's head get chopped up when Rogers used him a voodoo sacrifice!
"You can pay your debt to me by abandoning your hate, you nearly fried the universe with your stupid plan, next time, please throw a tantrum like a normal brat." Steve said with an eye roll as he starts floating planning to return to his real body and maybe sleep for the next thousand years, it really bothered him that it will take four years for him to reach his real body, the perk of astral travel. "Farewell Loki son of Odin." Steve said nodding his head a little before he shoots off into the space planning to return to his body, he may even bother Sara before that about going on an adventure to Jotunheim to see what happened to their planet and help in any way they can.
Peggy picked her way through the debris, swearing to herself, and went to check the state of the bathroom and the second floor, hearing the woman swear made Tony focus on the British accent in her voice, which brought a pang in Tony's heart. The young man follows, looking over his shoulder, and sees the bathroom suite is still intact. A bath, toilet, and sink, all unharmed amid the devastation, though there are streaks of mud across the walls, and several inches of murky looking water in the bath.
"y-you can't do that…" Tony stuttered looking at Steve and then at his pup, his face becoming flush at the idea of the Alpha staying with him in his room, he nearly starts having a panic attack, why would Steve sleep with him in his room? His bonded or not the Alpha should respect his privacy!
After a year of absence, the Starks and Peggy appeared once again, it caused a scandal… especially when they accuse Alexander Pierce the head of the 'World Security Council' of being one of Hydra's leaders… the evidence they showed everyone… and the president… having a crush on Captain America… you can say Pierce went into Shield custody to get interrogated and imprisoned.
son ended up paying, not to forget that you are rarely home to take care of your pup, I think that we both know that by the end of the year the Child Services would have ended up knocking on your door and taking the pup away, I'm doing you a favor and taking the custody of the child from your hands because apparently my foolish son became attached to your pup, don't worry I will pay you for your time." Howard's words made the room became dead silent as everyone was looking at the Alpha with a shocked look.
“How can I help you, Mr. Stark?” Mrs. Rogers asked after she put the teacup in front of him, and the flash of pain took a grip of Tony for a second, he hating how the two of them went from the first name phase back to the Mr. and Mrs. Kind of phase, he missed the time when Sarah Rogers will care for him like one of her own, but he will never regret dating her son and getting to know Peter, even when it hurt to be at the end of the cold shoulder from a woman he admired.
As much as Tony wished to say that living with an Addams wasn't weird (even if he was half an Addams half a Rogers) he knew that he was lying to himself (and lying badly)… not only was Rogers weird, but he was the dangerous weird, the kind of weird that will remind Tony of Stephen King's books, the kind of weird that remind Stark of that book 'IT' with the murderous clown.
"A strange organization appeared a few years ago, calling themselves the 'League of Evil Inhumans' you will find everything you need to know about the members in the file, one of our spies told us that they invented a time-traveling machine, planning to go to the past and help Thanos in his quest, they somehow were able to steal the original blueprint of the time travel machine from the Time Heist. Your mission is to destroy the machine and take the blueprint, do not engage with them unless necessary." Fury said making Steve nod his head taking the file and turn around to head out. "Be careful, Steve, don't do anything stupid." Fury said softly making the soldier paused and turn to Fury giving him a tired smile.
"Tony?" Pepper called out and when she reached the living room she grins happily "Oh, my God! I miss you." Pepper laughed as she runs toward Tony hugging the Omega, Tony grin at that and hugged her back, taking in her lavender scent. "It had been such a long time! Oh, Wow Tony, you look glowing! What's your secret?" Asked Pepper as she let Tony go, making the Omega grin at that.
Two years since Tony decided to return back to New York, not to stay, no, but to finally check on his friends whose news was cut off for a year, leaving Tony worried sick, and confused about what the hell was going on with his friends. Thankfully, Rhodey and Pepper were fine, if a little stressed and banged, apparently, Howard had accused them of kidnapping and killing Tony; because there was no news from Tony, no body to be found, the case had proceeded and his friends were nearly prosecuted, thankfully the two of them had a strong alibi, not only where the two of them out of the country the day of the 'kidnapping', but his mother also testified with his friends against his father, the only thing that saved his friends from jail. That though, didn't stop people from talking, didn't stop reporters from harassing his friends and mother, nor from breakig and enter from the noisy gossipy mongrels. It was only when Tony was back to New York with a child in tow that people finally put two in two and stopped from harassing his friends for his 'death'.
"Moving." Tony finally says when Phillips looks at him expectantly. "I saw an old cabin on sale just outside of Atlanta." Phillips pulls a battered little first aid kit out from under the counter and pushes it towards Tony, which the teen took it gratefully going to the bathroom in the back where the old man pointed, thanking the man in return, grimacing when he looked at his face in the bathroom's mirror, and start cleaning and dressing his wounds as best as he can.
Waking up the next day, Tony sighed happily as he snuggled with his baby, which made the pup give a broken purr and a sleepy yawn which made a sleepy smile take over Tony's face. God, how Tony didn't want to get up today, he just want to stay in bed and snuggle with his baby all day long, he felt a purring come from behind him, which made Tony blink at that and turn behind him to see the small Flerken looking at Tony with her tail swishing back and forth, making Tony blink at that.
"Please, just go and do what I said, I would be fine." Tony plea with his kids, ordering them to climb down before the person who trespasses on their house found they were aware of their presence. After a harsh stare down between Harley and Tony, the older boy finally nods his head with trembling lips and shiny eyes, leading a soft crying Peter toward the rope before urging the boy to climb after him.
"Hey, Steve…" Tony clenched the rag in his hands, the two adults were in the kitchen, cleaning after the breakfast that Steve spent embarrassing Tony in front of his son, but to be honest, it was the most warmth and heartfelt breakfast that Tony ever had in his life, filled with his son and mate's laughter as they exchanged old stories and start planning for new ones, and for the first time in Tony's life, he knew what it was like to have a beautiful family to return to after work, knew what it felt like to hold on his son tightly in his arms and gave him reassurance when the sickness threat to take him away from them, knew that it was like to hold into Steve as they brave on the road that was filled with darkness and doubt, and Tony… the Alpha doesn't want this to be a one-time thing only… he wanted to stay with his family, forever and ever, but to do that, he has to hope that Steve will inform their Peter about his real parentage, something that Tony wished for, with all of his heart, he wanted his baby boy to look at him and call him father, he didn't want his son to turn to him and call him 'Mr. Stark' like the two of them were nothing but strangers on the street. "Do you ever think that you will tell Peter who I truly am?" Tony finally dared to ask, being thankful that their son was at May's house, as the woman came to take Peter to give Steve a little alone time with Tony, but the woman didn't go until after she gave Tony the stinky eye making him feel even lower than he already was.
"No Dad, no just go to sleep, everything is going to be fine," Tony said, trying to smile at his father, but his trembling lips won't allow him.
"I love him!" Tony finally gathered his voice to say those words and Steven had to stop himself from going to Tony and bring him into his arms hugging him tightly until everything is better, hating himself that he couldn't stop the tears that were running down Tony's face as he looked at Peggy hoping that she will understand.
"You made a deal with him?!" Howard snarled as he took hold of the front of Steve's suit, making the blond Alpha hold himself back from killing his friend, his friend was on thin ice and any second now Steve was going to crack and snap. "How could you? After-" Howard wasn't able to say anything next as his words got stuck in his throat when he saw Steve's eyes.
Today the three of them decided to go and buy the necessity to the baby nursery; Rhodey had already painted the room a lovely creamy color, the only thing left was the furniture, which was already bought and delivered to the house without Tony saying a thing because apparently living in a small town meant that your business will always have people sticking their nose in, and when they know that you are buying something for the baby, it meant you get everything for free. No matter what Tony did, plea, or threat the owners that he will pay them or he won't take a thing, everyone just coos at him, and then they wave his threats away, saying something about it being their present to the baby or something, they even argued with Tony when he wanted to give them at least half the price; to make the matter worse they even called Peggy on him, which got him nothing but a painful ear pulling that caused him to pout to Kingdome come, it ended with Bucky taking pity on him and take the list off Tony's hand promising Tony that he can pay him back by fixing things around their house when Bucky doesn't have the time for it, which Tony agreed happily.
To be honest, it was concerning Tony more and more as the days passed, how his baby was getting attached to the lake and the monster within, when she doesn't even know the fate that would wait for her the second she would get close. "Tony…" A familiar voice made Tony snap from his dark thought as he turned to the source of the sound, his lips twitching down when he saw that the person who called him was no one other than Peggy Carter, who was walking toward him with her husband.
"Please leave…" Steve said after a while of silence which made Bucky's heart drop, no, Steve can't do this, Steve had to listen, if not for himself then for his son. "Please Bucky, don't make yourself the enemy." That shut Bucky up and he walked to Steve holding him tightly for a few seconds then kissing the back of his head before leaving the room planning to return to the mansion…
"Oh, I only signed up, because Dr. Erskine promised me there is a chance I will die!" Steve chirped happily as he runs after Tony, his words causing Tony to stumble on his feet and turn to stare at Rogers with disbelieving eyes. "I wanted to witness the glory of death, pain, and suffering that was the war; so I tried several times to enlist, only for them to kick me out after knowing I was an Addams. Dr. Erskine was nice though, he offered me a chance for suffering and dying in a dangerous experiment as payback for being a lab rat; everyone was surprised when the serum worked, even with being an Addams." Steve pouted when he said the word 'worked' like he was planning on suffering and dying from the start only to be denied that sweet pain.
Tony let out a shaky sigh as he finally reached his destroyed mansion; his nerves were stilled being fried as he remembered the horrible screams that he was subjected to listen to for an hour before he finally managed to make his escape. Tony wonders what Natasha was going to do once she learns that her workplace was destroyed and that Fury is possibly dead; Tony hoped that she wasn't going to kill him and would be content by being angry at Steve, but knowing his luck, Tony knew that this was just a wistful wish.
Thinking about that always made Anton's heart give a pang of pain and hurt, it always made him want to curl around himself and let out a broken whine full of agony and despair. If the sweet Omega was to see him now, he would have been embarrassed by what Anton would have become, an Alpha who never married even when he reached the age of thirty-one spring, an Alpha taking care of an orphaned child without a mate or someone to help him, an Alpha who was what everyone considered a demon, even by his own people. Maybe, maybe it was for the best that his love moved on, at least then Anton won't drag the sweet Omega with him when he falls down to Hel.
Just as Steve expected, Natasha throws a storm when she heard about what happened, shrieking and screaming until Steve's ears rang because of her loud voice. Steve doesn't even think it was funny when the woman threat to hire a bodyguard to tail him for the rest of his life (He knows that Natasha doesn't say anything she doesn't mean). In the end, it ended with Natasha promising him that she was going to look into it and find the stalker only to break both of his legs and dick; to be honest it was a little scary, and Steve sower that Natasha's hair was floating around because of her dark aura. Needless to say, Steve was scared for life; thankfully, he wasn't Natasha's target this time.
"What happened?" Tony grounded out, frowning darkly as he gazed at the lake, not wanting someone else to come and tell him another sob story about how poor Rogers is nothing but a victim. It wasn't like Tony didn't suspect that, but he doesn't welcome the fact being shoved in his face to try and soften the lies and betrayal the town has done.
Steve's eyes widened and his breath hitched. Slowly, Steve raised his hand, putting it into Tony's, causing him to give a relieved sigh as he tugged Steve toward the dance floor. "You want me to lead?" Tony grinned cheekily, causing Steve to smile and nod his head, which ended with him getting pulled into Tony's arms. Tony smiled as he took Steve in, humming along with the song the woman was singing as he took Steve's face, smiling at the awe he was seeing.
When they finally reached the hospital, Steve was separated from the pup; he walked around the place until he saw a sobbing Peggy sitting in the waiting room, Howard was with her his shaking hand on her shoulder, Maria was screaming at the doctors pleading with them to let her see her son, Angie was there rocking herself back and forth in her seat, tears streaming down her face, and Jarvis… Jarvis was taking all of this with a shocked slack face, trying to be stronger, going from Maria to Peggy, pleading with them to calm down or they will hurt themselves or worse someone.
Steve though, could only shake Peter Quill's hand away when the man tried to drag him away from the communal floor that turned into a battleground; Steve doesn't want to leave, he doesn't want to leave Tony who seemed to be the Witch's only target, the witch who attacked to kill and torture, the witch who cussed and hissed and throw her magic left and right… her tainted magic that tried to latch into every being and break their minds with her torturous spells.
"Anthony… Carbonell..." Steve said looking at the picture with a sad look despite everything Steve had mixed feeling toward his Alpha, thanks to him Steve got the bundle of joy in his arms; but Steve, he couldn't think of the man who destroyed him easily as his son's father, so Steve split the Alpha into two people, unhealthy? Yes, crazy? Definitely, but that was the only way for Steve to be able to move on with his life. his Alpha was Anthony Carbonell, the kind and loving person, the person who loved him and Peter, who always talked about starting a life with Steve away from everything and everyone who wished them harm that was his Alpha not that Tony Stark, the egoistic playboy who goes through his dates like people go through their shoes, his Alpha was not that Merchant of Death who took pleasure in making missiles and guns that took people's lives, the Alpha who left him and Peter alone, no, his Alpha was that awkward dork who loved robots so much that he could talk hours about them with sparkling eyes.
"And your dad?" Tony asked as he leans down a little to be in the same height as the kid, that question made the boy smile a little and puff his small chest.
So for a whole year, Steve leads SI in a new direction… it seems like being Captain America has its advantage as no one out of Obadiah's loyal dogs oppose his decisions… in six months of him managing SI Steve was able to make impossible deals become real, which was one of the reasons that the shareholders backed away… it seems like Captain America leading SI, was too much, as people were still enchanted by the legends that were 'The First Avenger'. Nine months later, Steve was able to lock Stane out of the company while imprisoning half of the shareholders that took his side… because apparently they were Hydra sleeping agents, who sold SI weapons in the black market, the blackmailing material that Peggy gave him was one of the reasons he was able to do that… sadly they didn't have anything against Stane… yet.
Meanwhile, Thanos has been planning to capture Steven, ever since he knew about him finally returning to this universe, but the thing was, he never really knows what Steven was reborn as and what he was, he just knows that Steven was here and he has to find him. because of that, Thanos made his move way too early, now instead of the eight years the Avengers had to stop Thanos, they only have a few short months before he comes to earth to collect the infinity stones.
"Yeah, yeah, smile all you want, you are sleeping on the couch tonight." Steve said playfully, which made the Alpha laugh at that before glancing at his watch, jumping from his chair when he noticed that it was getting late and that he needed to go to work before Howard arrived at his office.
The Omega heard a hum from behind and a sigh, making the younger man smile at the thought of the Alpha waking up, and his smile widens when the Alpha behind him start giving him slow kisses on his neck and shoulder, making the Omega let out a happy sigh, trying to hold into his giggles as the beard tickled him. "Good morning…" The Omega was finally able to breathe out these words, which made the Alpha hum at that and kiss his neck a few more times before stopping.
"Brat!" The Alpha growled as he stood up, trying to intimidate James, only for the boy to squeak and hiss at the man, calling him a
In the end, Tony opts to avoid Steve at all times of the day, mainly in his tower with the excuse of doing paperwork (Oh the hateful paperwork). It worked thankfully, and Tony was grateful, considering that Steve took their first kiss as permission to drop out of thin air and try to kiss Tony again. It was too much stress to Tony's already damaged heart. What stressed Tony, even more, was that Pepper and Rhodey decided to throw Tony a birthday party (Birthday ball? Can Tony even say that?), inviting everyone in the higher places, something about improving the image of the Avengers, especially after Loki and the zombies' fiasco.
The two of them watched Peter for a little while, Steve drinking his drink and watching the pups with a proud smile on his face, while Tony could only watch how happy Peter was, not even flinching or screaming when one of the volunteers came to give him a box of apple juice and cake. It made Tony's heart flutter in happiness to see his pup nodding his head to the older boy who couldn't be older than sixteen, and he even thanked him. Tony looked at his hands while running his tongue over his lips trying to wet the. "Thank you, I am going back if you don't mind." Tony asked which made Steve smile at him and nod his head, watching Tony as he march toward the therapist room with a determined look in his eyes…
… Tony's mind whispered as it tried to urge himself to save his baby, to replace the evil in front of him with the lesser one… the one that is named Steven Rogers.
Steve ran all the way to the hospital, heart pounding in his throat from fear, tears stinging his eyes, he still couldn't believe what Cassie had told him, he just saw Tony this morning, laughing and joking with him, they were even going to Cassie's to meet her boyfriend and parents, how did this happen? Thought Steve as he thrust the glass doors open, making everyone look at him, he saw Cassie crying in the corner so he rushed toward her, he didn't remember what he said or screamed, but it ends with the doctors rushing toward him, trying to calm him down.
Tony didn't know how long he walked, but he knew it was far away, if Tony even bothered to look around the place or even cared about where he was he would have noticed that he walked far away that he was in Manhattan, Central Park to be exact, but Tony didn't care as he continued to walk, away from parents and their children, away from the laughter and shouts he was hearing, away from the sound of his phone that was ringing constantly, away from his raging thoughts, away from the memory of him waking up six months after his child's birth feeling like someone ripped his heart, just away from everything in general.
He refused all the invitation from his friends, from the Coulsons, the Banners, The Barnes, from his friends, he refused them all, he never get out of the house unless he has too, or was dragged out by force, always spending time with Dummy and Jarvis, always trying to close the hole in his heart…
OK, so here was the thing, Tony may or may not have a small, so small; so tiny that it doesn't exist (Huge) respect that turns to a crush on Steve. After the events of Ty (Something that brought him great joy, and made him sigh like a school girl every time he remembered it) Tony starts seeing Steve in a different light. The crazy Addams was an OK person when you get to know him better and Tony can finally admit that he can see what Bucky saw. (Even if he refused to admit it) So Tony admit, that Rogers wasn't really a bad person when he abandons all the Addams craziness behind him for five seconds; hell, he was half a decent person even while being an Addams (If he wasn't trying to kill or torture you) so maybe Tony misjudge him a little bit (Not). Anyway, what Tony was trying to say is that he was becoming more and more acceptant of Steve's crazy life as an Addams, what he wasn't accepted of was his supposed 'Friends' trying to off him for 'Seducing' Steve (When the hell did Tony even manage to do that when he spent half of his time running away from Steve?)
Steve looked at Tony's face with pursed lips, seeing the emotions passed on the Alpha's face, he wondered what the Alpha was going to say, but it seems that the Alpha won't open his mouth and say it, the fast gasps of breath made Steve look at the Alpha to see that he was choking on his breath, gripping the roses in his hands tightly, and he wondered to himself if Tony was going to have a panic attack while standing on his house's front yard. years later and it seems that the Alpha was still having unhealthy levels of anxiety, he looked around the place, stiffening a little when he saw people pointed at the two of them, guess they noticed Tony Stark, which made Steve bite his lower lip then let out a sigh, turning away from the Alpha and opened the door he closed when the Alpha pulled his hand, he can hear Tony's choked whisper of his name, which made the Omega let out a harsh breath through his nose, cursing himself for being softhearted with the bastard, Steve entered his house, dragging the Alpha by his tie, slamming the door behind him while grumbling about noisy peoples and noisy exes. "This won't change anything Stark, now try to get yourself together, Peter is napping." Steve said as he went to the kitchen to prepare herbal tea, hoping that it will calm the Alpha before he passes out.
It made them concern, how the boy was so sure the two of them was going to get rid of him just because they were having another baby; they even talked with Betty about this behavior, and no matter what new approach the woman tried to use with Harley, it was of no use, the boy kept sticking to Steve or Tony's side, following them everywhere they went… Tony was so going to destroy that family when he was going to find them.
Steve gaze at Stane with hard eyes, the once billionaire Alpha who always made sure his look was always perfect… looked like shit, like a homeless man, even calling him that was a light word to descript the situation, it made a dark part of Steve smile in glee at the sight. Stane was thrust into the chair harshly making the older man groan in pain and throw a glare at the agents.
"Was I an inventor? Oh, oh! What was my rule in Athens? Was I married? Did I have kids? Tell me, tell me, tell me!" Tony whined as he held into Steven's hand, only getting an eye roll from the star who detached himself from Tony in a will practice move that Tony was sure Bucky taught him.
Gasps echoed from the king's subjects, while the surrounding Vikings sneered in agreement in the same foreign tongue. Steven felt his friends shiver in fear and huddle closer to him.
When Tony arrived downstairs to the dining room he was greeted with a round of 'Good morning' from everyone, making the Omega smile at them and sit in his chair beside Steve with his baby on his lap, which his baby took a chance to pester the Alpha about wanting to go to the zoo again today, which made the Alpha chuckle at that and promise the pup that they will go soon, Tony hummed and smiled happily when everyone was sending him happy and excited looks, which made the Omega excited, and then a plate was put in front of him which made the Omega contain his choked gasp, eyes become teary when they fell on the blueberry pancakes.
"No, I didn't." Peggy said in a steady voice looking in Maria's tear-filled eyes, and she really didn't, Peggy felt like the ground under her feet was shaking because she didn't know what the fuck happened other than what Natasha and Clint were able to explain, how? How could Howard do such a thing to Tony? For how long was Tony suffering like this without anyone realizing it? Tony was going to be a father… a father! And with Howard refusing to tell them what took a place, she didn't know where the Omega and the pup where! How old is the pup? Does he know about Tony? Where is the Omega? If he was Bucky's family like the Alpha always told her about then that meant he was dead, right? That meant the pup was dead and the Omega was dead and the killer was Howard, and Peggy was this close to having a panic attack in front of everyone because Tony has disappeared and no one knows where he was and where was she going to find the Omega that Barnes spent ten years searching for only to get nothing! Will she find him in the cemetery? Peggy nearly screamed her head off.
Anthony wished for these happy times to never disappear from him, he knew he was crazy, after all, who will buy a wedding band for someone that they were dating for only nine months? But every time he looked at the ring, he knew what he was feeling was true, he was madly in love with Steve Rogers and wanted to marry the Omega, so in the end, he proposed, and to his joy the Omega said 'Yes' Anthony would have cried in joy if the Omega didn't pull him in a kiss, telling him that he loved him.
"… Are you alright, Tony?" Steve's voice made the Omega blink and look at the Alpha who was gazing at him with concern look, and it made Tony blink and look at Steve with wonder since when did the Alpha arrived here? Looking at Peter who was gazing at him with worried eyes, Tony smiled a little, showing his baby that he was fine, which made the small pup give a grin of his own and return to his drawing.
After walking around the place, and taking the sights, Steve then steers them toward the children's zoo, which ended up with Peter trying to pet every animal he sees, squealing when Steve put the bunny in his hands. And God, did Tony want a camera to photo how happy his baby was? It was the first time he saw his baby this energetic and happy, which made him happy. When it was sunset, Steve then took them to a small cozy Italian restaurant, and Tony had to stop a loud moan from leaving him at how delicious the food was. All the while Steve and Tony exchange pleasant conversation, from talking about the changes Tony saw, to the kind of movies that Steve and Tony liked.
"Ah, you are talking about Harley Keener. You know I can't really tell you that much about him, patient-doctor confidant, and all of that." Betty let out a sigh when she drank her hot tea, shivering pleasantly at the warm feeling spreading through her body, causing her to relax more.
Knowing Steve, his Omega needed space, and the minimal time someone can give him is three days sometime four, but Tony was too impatient, wanting to see his mate and pull his bambino in his arms peppering both of their faces with kisses, telling them how much he missed them, and how much he loved them more than the whole wide world.
I hope I was able to explain as much as I can if you have some other questions for me please don't hastate to ask. For all the people who comment and liked the story, thank you very much, it made me happy to see many people liking my story.
In the end, even Tony can't hide from his birthday party, not because he can't, because he can! But because Serpentine decided to pay him a lovely visit and threaten Tony that she will haunt every person who arrived at the party if Tony refused to go with Steve as his plus one and announced their engagement. No don't get Tony wrong, he would
Steven looked at Thor who was talking to the shop owner with a grin on his face, waving animated stories of Midgard and its heroes, it made Steven wonder if his Thor will ever smile like this again, but he knows that it was just a childish wish, after all, the last time Thor smiled was thirty-five years ago and after the Time Heist… you can say that he lost the ability to feel emotions, it was probably the reason why he left with the guardians, a thing that Steven wouldn't fault the man for doing.
“So when is the wedding?” Carol asked with a huge grin after everyone took their seats, Tony smiled shyly at his friends’ excited faces, all were waiting to hear what Tony was about to say, the Omega so grateful for how supportive his friends were, even now when it was supposed to be Rhodey’s day.
"I'm sorry…?" Tony murmured, getting a huff from Steve who then turned out and ignored him when the movie started. The marathon started with Snow White, throughout the movie everyone kept glancing at Steve, watching how wide his eyes were, how slacked his jaw was, even once or twice, Tony caught Steve humming the songs with Peter.
The shock on their friends' faces was priceless, nearly causing Tony to start laughing until he was on the floor; Howard nearly choked on the drink in his hand if it wasn't for Harley patting on his back and looking like he wanted to be anywhere but this awkward atmosphere.
"Of course Peter knows about his father, Bucky! I am not that cruel to hide from him that information." Steve said with a huff, returning to drying the dishes with a sad look, yes, Steve had made sure to tell his son everything about his father, Anthony Carbonell that is, the dorky scientist who loved them so much… not the self-proclaimed superhero Tony Stark…
"Why didn't he tell us about him Rhodey?" Peggy asked as she saw the Beta looking lost and dazed which made the man blink and turn to Peggy. Everyone stayed silent, no one dared to say a word, and some of them were uncomfortable about hearing this as this was Tony's private life, but they keep their mouths shut and listen.
He was so tired, that he wanted to end his life for once and for all, so Tony thought it all through. He calculates every way he could kill himself and how much time it would take him to do it. In the end, he stood up in his lab with a knife in his hand, and for the first time in two years, he smiled at the thought that he was finally going to be free. Though his smile fell off of his face as he felt someone push him and pulled the knife out of his hands.
Steven looked at Tony with a small smile on his face, though the sadness in it made Tony's anger vanish. "I knew you for more than forty years; Tony, beside you, named your AI Jarvis, and nicknamed him J for short." Steven said as he tried to lighten up the mood, which made Tony hum at that.
"Can't you like; I don't know, throw him in the space and end it?" Anton complains; more of a whine really, but Steven was struggling hard not to attack the fool, drawing deep breaths to remain relaxed. "Hell! You can even call that idiotic strange space crew to arrest him, I'm positive that he and the Groot tree will make acquaintances." That was what made Steven lose it and he picked up the cushion beside him and hurl it at Anton, causing the smaller man shriek when the pillow collided with his skull, and it made everyone stare at him with large eyes, doubtless wondering how Steven was able to secure a headshot when there were a few of Anton's teammates blocking the view.
"Think I could join you?" Tony said as he wiggled his eyebrows, causing Steve to laugh and push Tony away, causing his Alpha to pout and follow the Omega to the bathroom, ignoring how Steve sighed and pushed him away. The pout on Tony's face was endearing, but Steve knew that if Tony entered the bathroom with him, it meant that the two of them would stay in the shower until Bucky come and knock on the door.
The stars were beautiful, so is the moon when its light falls on the lake, giving it a glowing halo. Tony will always lay on his back and gaze at the beautiful stars, ignoring the cold as he took in everything with wide eyes full of wonder and amazement searching the constellation and keep talking about them, talking about the stories and myths that circled them; hoping that whoever was listening will get to enjoy them as much as Tony does. Tony knew that after his baby is born, he will always bring her here with him to gaze at the beautiful star and enjoy them as she was rocked to sleep by the calm waves of the lake.
The question made Tony shake his head with a sad smile. "Because someone told me sad news today, I guess I wasn't ready to hear them." Tony then stood counting the pictures and returned them to the envelope and put it in the inner pocket of his suit least he lost them.
It was a shock, him hearing these words after more than twenty-two years; it made him think, and it made his heart ache, and not for the first time, the Alpha cursed the foolish queen for always doing this to him. When was the last time he thought of the sweet Omega who stole his breath away? The Omega who became his first and only friend until he was eleven springs old, the pretty Omega who jump in to defend him from the village's bullies, the beauty who wiped his tears away when both of his parents would have sneered at him for being a week Alpha, not like the rest, not strong enough, not smart enough, never enough…
"Petrus's room…" Steven muttered to himself before walking on shaky legs toward the small pup's room; ignoring the Alpha who followed him, too busy trying to reach his babe faster than his legs can take him. Reaching the boy's room, Steven opened the door and let out a choked sound when he found his baby sleeping beside Petrus, the content and sleepy scent of the children made Steven's muscle relax. After that everything happened fast, one second Steven took a step toward his babe, another second he was falling down, his vision going dark as he heard an alarming noise from behind him…
"That's me, why don't we go inside so you can tell me about why you are here?" Sam said as he offered his hand toward Tony who took it with a tired smile, after that the Beta direct Tony inside, making Tony hum at the desks he passed and give a little pause at the missing children's posters on the board they passed.
"Belong to us?" Peter asked after a little pause, his eyes wide eyes becoming bright at the thought of Tony being theirs, something that Steve caught, and he had to hide his smile because it seems that his son has a possessive strike like him.
"Honey… you know that's not true, even with me being married to Tony it doesn't change everything," Steve whispered running his hand through Harley's hair, causing the boy to sniffle even more. "Sweetie, Tony likes you, and he would have preferred you coming to us than running away, you made him worry sick when Betty told him about what happened, he was so scared he couldn't help getting angry at Betty." Harley nodded his head, still hiding his face in Steve's chest, refusing to show his face.
"God no, she is on a romantic vacation with her husband, lucky…" Bruce grumbled, which ended with Tony laughing happily, causing Bruce to give a small smile, the two of them chatted for a few more minutes catching up before Bruce went over the tests results that Tony took. It was only a few moments before Tony was lying on the chair ready for his ultrasound, nervously shifting in his seat, gazing at an equal nervous Rhodey and Pepper.
Steven swallowed, refusing to answer the king's question, not when five minutes passed, not when the five minutes turned to ten and the ten to fifteen. "It does not matter, does it?" Steven finally answered the king's question with one of his own, ignoring as the king shifted in his seat and gazed at the Omega with a blank expression. Gods above, how Steven hates the man in front of him.
It made Tony stumble, because the glowing did nothing but highlight Steve's natural beauty, causing Tony's breath to hitch in his chest and blush to take over his face. No, no, no, no, no, no! Tony was not going down that road, no! The last time he did, it ended up with him pregnant and alone, besides, Steve will end up back to wherever he was from, in the end, leaving Tony and Peter alone. Tony doesn't need an additional heartbreak to the heartbreak that Peter will have the day he realize that Steve will leave them and won't stay.
"Daddy, what's going on?" The childish voice that came from the door froze Steven in his place, and he turned to the side to see a four years old kid looking at them with big eyes, making Steven hide the pillow behind him and smile innocently at the boy like he wasn't about to attack Anton and send him to his death.
Two weeks and finally, Betty called Tony telling him that they can come and get Harley any time they liked, causing Tony to bite his lips and thank her, before closing the phone and squeal in delight at the thought of Harley finally being home; everyone was excited, especially Peter (Before getting bored about having to wait more time before Harley come home) now, they just have to wait for Sarah and Howard before they are sit.
He said coldly at them, and they stared in disbelief at him for a second, but the redhead soon was snapping at them to do whatever they had been told to do. Steven watched wordlessly as they marched towards the castle servants and ushered them out of the throne room. They whimpered and hugged each other, some feebly resisted, but they all were crying out for Steven and Margaret even begged them to grant the queen mercy for he didn't do anything, that made the king raise his eyebrow and look at the queen with a raised brow.
Tony swallowed as his eyes darted around the place, taking in the upturned living room; furniture were thrown around the place, sofas and chairs thrown upside down as if a fight had taken place in the room. But what caused Tony to freeze in his place was the red that was sprayed everywhere, the red that was dripping from the walls and painting the floor red… this was… this was where Steve was beaten up. "Oh… God…" Tony's voice cracked as he started shaking, wondering if what he saw was an insane trick from his imagination, but the blood that was everywhere informed Tony that what happened was true.
Now I am sure everyone is probably wondering why Hammer wasn't punished as severely as his 'friends' were, to answer that: It's because he admitted to his crime in hurting Steve, in Norse society as long as the accused was open and honest about his crimes and killing and announced it straight away, then they would normally escape death and could be outlawed instead. However, being outlawed was a tough punishment and could sometimes be very dangerous even resulting in death. Outlaws had to completely remove themselves from their community and they couldn't receive any help or protection from members, they also could be lawfully killed by anyone at any time.
"I will my friend, thank you." Thor called out as he swung Mjolnir around, using her momentum to throw himself up in the air. It had been years since the last time Thor's gaze fell upon Asgard and its golden city, years since he saw his father, mother, and his friends, years since that fated day when Loki fell from the Bifrost into the unknown and hadn't been found yet, even by Heimdall himself.
For the first time in a long, long time, Tony felt beautiful; a feeling that Tony hadn't felt for years and years now, not since he lost his baby and himself after. But in the end, it seemed like the only thing that he needed to feel like himself once more was his beautiful family and friends; it seemed that Tony only needed his beautiful Alpha and amazing child, to feel this way once more.
"Is that so?" The king asked as he tilted his head, gazing at the Omega with an unreadable look like Steven was a puzzle he was trying to solve. "Then why did you not kill me? I am sure you had a lot of time to come up with a plan that will end up with me dying without you and your people getting accused." The Alpha stated causing the Omega to give him a smug smile, which caused the king to narrow his eyes.
Steven's mind remind him as he narrowed his eyes at the way the woman studied him before turning to Nicolaus.
"He must be an important someone." The king ended up saying after a while of silence, looking at the Omega up and down before a dark smile took over his face. "Your freedom for theirs, Aye? Fine I will take your deal; for your sake, I hope your son knows how to clean well." The Alpha said which got him a snarl from the Omega.
"Yeah, can't wait to see Peter… and our home which is hopefully still standing and not burned by our parents' competitive nature…" Tony said the last part dryly, causing Steve to let out a laugh, knowing that it was true. Howard had volunteered to housesit their home, but both Steve and Tony knew it was because he wanted to spend more time with Peter, which made Sarah's competitive streak rise…
"How is my baby doing?" Tony cooed as he stood up, Peter was still in his embrace, giggling happily when Tony struggled to pick him up, the boy was getting a little heavier, which do nothing but make Tony happier, because it meant he was healthy. "Don't worry big guy, I didn't forget about you." Tony grin as his gaze fell on Steve, the Alpha though only smiled as he shook his head, pulling Tony from his waist and kissing him on the cheek, causing Tony to flush feeling pleasant on the inside, Peter though continued to giggle but he starts poking Tony playfully on his pink cheek.
Fury on the other hand just let out a tired sigh and lowered his arms from their defensive position, looking more tired than angry if Tony had to say so. "I don't hate him, I just hate the…
"What do you mean by that, Edith, why is Steven considered a risk?" Natasha asked, eyes darting around the place searching for a gap, she realizes that she can't crush the glasses, the risk of Edith transforming its conscious to the Stark mansion is extremely high, and the probability of them being held here if they destroy it even higher, so that left her with nothing but work to gain information from the A.I. until it deemed it clear for them to leave the workshops.
"Oh no bambino, no, it wasn't your fault, I should have told you why you are not allowed in the room, it's not your fault Peter." Tony cuddled the boy close to his chest which got him a small sniff and a nod from the boy, the teary eyes broke Tony, for the Omega never ever wanted to see the baby in his arms with such a sad look, he never wanted to see the pain and doubt on his face. "Tell you what, bambino, why don't we go to the zoo today? Me, you, and your Papa? I am sure the three of us will enjoy our day off, we can even eat out today." Tony put on a false cheer as he said those words, he wanted nothing but to hide in his room in his bed today but seeing his Peter look so crushed was the only thing that shook the Omega out of his pity party. The boy was his, as much as the baby in his belly was, and Tony will not accept making the child sad at any cause.
Tonton was so different from Anton; it was like day and night, where Anton was born in Greece when it marked the height of Greek civilization in all of its aspects. Tonton was the next chieftain to his tribe, he was smart that much was true, but he was a hunter, he lived from the earth he walked on, he knows what nature wants and what he wants from it, he was not that much of an inventor or philosopher, his only concern was his tribe and family and providing enough food and protection to them.
As a star, Steve's role was to write the history and shine, lightening the way for the people who cross the space; a star's rule was to never tangle themselves with the affairs of the mortals' realm, they are to see how everything will come to an end and never interfere. When it comes to Anton though, when it comes to the person Steven loved with all of his beaten and broken heart, Steven can't help himself from tangling himself farther in Anton's life, protecting him from his foolishness. "Then we will do this together." Steve finally turned to Tony smiling at the inventor gently. "We will win together and if we lost we will do it together too. You don't have to carry the weight of the world on your shoulders, Tony, not when you have a family that will always have your back." Steve's hand reached up and held Tony's hand giving the inventor a soft squeeze of assurance.
Steve's heart leaped into his throat and he swallowed hard around the lump. "Lock the door please." His voice sounded like a growl to his ears and Steve was kind of embarrassed at the commanding tone but Tony complied, a teasing smile taking over his face. As they stood before one another once more, Steve asked Tony one last time. "Are you sure?" Not wanting Tony to give in to him if he wasn't ready.
"I did… will Loki did… he is still raging about the news you brought and tried with everything he can to help; he wanted to take the queen and his people back to Asgard, but he could not for the queen refused his offer for the third time." Magna sighed, and Anton could only press his lips together. If only the queen will agree to go to Asgard, he will have a fresh start and try to forget about all this madness, but no one knew why he stay here in Mantta when he was clear on his hate for Anton.
"Anthony!" Howard's snarl made Tony misstep and he nearly slides down the eaves, causing Tony to curse at how he just nearly fell but alerted Howard to his whereabouts. "So here you are." Sneer Howard when he finally leaned out of the window, only to see Tony, grasping into the wall behind him. "Just be a good boy, Tony, it doesn't have to end badly. If you come back home I promise I will let that small pest live." Howard said in a gentle voice, trying to soften Tony with the false promise of him letting his baby live.
"Ah, but you did." Steven stated, giving the king a narrow look that ordered him to stay quiet, and to Steven's surprise, the king did. "Six years ago, do you remember attacking the Hydra king's ships?" Steven asked with a sweet voice full of poison, which caused the Iron King to sit straight in his chair unconsciously. "I remember that day very well, do you know why? Because that day, the Hydra king killed my seven days old babe and James's twin brother in a fit of rage; that day I sower that I will personally guide the Hydra king to Hel's gates, with you not that far behind. But you! You took my revenge away from me!" Steven snarled his words causing the Alpha to clench his fists tightly.
"T… Tony?" Steve mumbled as he lowered his hand, opening his eyes and blinking them a few times before he stilled on Tony who was kneeling beside him, touching him everywhere he can just to confirm that he was real. "What… what happened?" Steve asked, only to get a lapful of a crying Tony who couldn't believe that Steve was in front of him after a year of seeing him die. The loud cry of
"Yes, baby, he is…" Tony ends up saying, trying desperately to hold into his tears, his baby's happy grin was worth it.
"What does that mean for Steven? Should we tell him about Thanos?" Bucky finally asked, his eyes catching Peggy's and the two of them had a silent conversation that made everyone uncomfortable, especially when both Bucky and Peggy frown darkly.
"We will see when we go home, now wave goodbye to your father." Tony said when Steve's phone starts ringing for the second time which made the Alpha sigh tiredly and waved to both the Omega and pup before he answered his phone and start screaming at whoever was on the other side causing Tony to laugh at that and wince a little… poor Alpha! "So what do you think of having breakfast before going to meet the bots?" Tony asked which get a grin from the pup, which made Tony's heart flutter in his chest as the two of them walked toward his house…
Is he staying because he felt guilty? That was a hard question, but even Steve knew that he will never stay with someone because of the guilt; it will end up leading to more heartbreak and pain in the future, and Steve loath to be the one to cause pain for the small pup and his mother. Then what? Regret is making him stay? Steve has lots of regrets in his life, from letting Bucky fell from the train to crashing the plane, to past regrets that will make people shake if they knew what he did, Steve refuses to make Tony and his small pup a regret, if he left them now, he will only regret it in the future but he will hate himself more and more because of that, and if he stayed with them he didn't know what is going to happen… but he knows that Tony needs someone right now, a friend, a stranger, a family, a mate, Steve could be all of those and none at the same time, but it will end up in a hopeful note in the future. "No, I am not doing this because of guilt or regret; I am doing this all on my own." Steve said looking at Jarvis, the older man must have seen something in his eyes, because he smiled happily and nod his head.
The twin familiar giggles, made Anton blink his eyes, snapping out of his intense concentration on not thinking about foolish Omegas going to swim in this kind of cold; turning his gaze from the metal he was working on, Anton located from where the giggling was coming from, making him smile when he heard his son whispering behind the door. "Shhh! He will see us, we have to sneak quietly!" Petrus whisper (Or what he thought was a whisper, because to Anton it was a shout) made Anton's lips twitch up in a conspiring plot, turning his head back to the metal and gave his back to the door, gazing from the corner of his eyes to see what the two brats were going to come.
"As my husband wishes…" Steve said, leaning down to steal a kiss from Tony, ignoring the way the Omega let out a few more protests at the thought of morning breathes and heavy Alphas and being hungry as hell so Steve should hurry. Seeing his Alpha's naked body on display as Steve stood up, made Tony give an appreciated whistle at the amazing sight in front of him; which to be honest only gain him a laugh from his Alpha as he headed to the kitchen.
"My husband was a drunk and abusive piece of shit," Angie stated, finally snapping from her dazed look and turn to Tony, whose eyes were wide at the words that left Angie's mouth. "He was someone I would have never married if he was the last man on earth, but our marriage was arranged by our parents, just like all the marriages in the sixties and the seventies," Angie explained, gazing at Morgan with a sad smile on her lips. "It was hell, but unfortunately I couldn't leave him, not when he had so much power and influence, I knew he would find me wherever I flee, so I suck it up and stayed with him, bearing the abuse and humiliation for sixteen years straight…" Angie hummed, taking the empty bottle from Tony's hand and stand up to wash it, all the while Tony's eyes were on Angie.
The Avengers were called on a mission, it was supposed to be an easy mission (Fury's words) just detain the Scarlet Witch, just take hold of her and stop her from killing more people, just that. Only when they reached the Witch's hideout, she wasn't there, it was a trap, a trap meant for Tony from the look of it.
Rogers… he… he was kind, helping Tony when the younger man did nothing but run away, screaming and crying as he tried to hide Morgan away from what he thought was nothing but a monster… a monster that showed Tony more humanity and kindness than his father managed to show him in all of his 20 years of life. Tony blinked once more, letting out a shuddered breath as he silently left the sofa, surrounding his daughter with as many pillows and cushions as he can so that she won't fall.
James hissed, causing Tony to surpass his snarl and rein his inner Alpha before he attacked his younger brother.
So now, until the Bifrost is repaired, Steven was held on Midgard; defenseless, without his magic to protect him and not even knowing how to handle the stone that was attached to him, depending on the son of Odin and his merry crew of 'Superheroes' to keep him safe… how ironic.
That was a year and a half ago when Steve was eighteen at that time. At first, the two of them just continued to talk with each other once a week, with Anthony asked about Steve's shoulder, the Alpha clearly was still feeling guilty about hurting the small Omega. Then it turned into every three days with the Alpha asking about the Omega, and what he was up too, they will spend the time talking about significant and insignificant things. Then it turned to every day, a little text here, and a call there until Anthony finally asked him out on a date after half a year Steve always teased the Alpha about that, the Alpha had been worried at first considering that he was older than Steve by ten years.
The letter said making Steve blink at that and cock his eyes in confusion, thanks to Peggy and Howard, who made Steve take a crash course in technology, Steve can perfectly understand what's happening before him, but what he doesn't understand was the computer turning on without powering it up, and who was Sir? It seems like he asked the question loudly because not a second later he read the answer.
"Well, well, look who is still alive and kicking!" Angie came to their booth, smiling brightly up at Tony, causing him to grunt and whine, hating how Angie always greeting him like that, but secretly loving the gentle and motherly smile she sends his way, Tony can feel how awkward Rhodey and Pepper most be feeling, as they send the woman an awkward little wave when she smiled their way. "You are eating? You got to eat; you're getting way too skinny!" Angie suddenly asked with narrow eyes, giving Tony a once over making him shift in his seat; no matter how many times Tony swore that he eats, Angie doesn't believe that he can take care of himself, which is harsh… Tony got better, he stopped skipping meals!
The third time he woke up Steve let out a tired whine, trying to calm his heart down so that the doctors wouldn't force him down once more, his head was killing him and his body hurt! Opening his eyes, Steve looked around the place until his eyes fell on someone, the female sitting in the chair reading made Steve pause and for his eyes to widen in shock. It can't be… it really can't, this can't be Peggy Carter, because his best friend died more than 10 years ago in a car accident that took both her and her husband, so this is impossible.
"That's because it's fall, baby, every year the trees change their colors in fall, then they fell off the trees in winter, only for new leaves to show in the spring." Tony said to the pup purring when the pup's face lighten up and start looking out of the window, taking in the different colors of the trees, it made the adults smile at the sight before them, especially Howard and Maria, as the two of them had refused to leave their son and grandson's side these whole two weeks.
"If… if you managed to handle it for so long, then why? Why did you leave him?" Tony asked, wondering how Angie managed to find her way here, wondering how she even managed to find this town that no one knew about, how did she manage to fool her husband long enough for her to run away? He wanted to know why she would run away if she managed to live like that for sixteen years. Tony can sympathize; Tony knew why he had to run away from home, he did it so his baby was going to live. If he never got pregnant with Morgan, Tony knew that he would have married Stane; he knew he would have handled his abuse just like he handled Howard's. For him, it was the arrival of Morgan that changed everything.
"I called work today, so I have a day off." Tony explained which made the boy's eyes widen a little at that. "And you forgot something baby, Papa can't punish you without me, so technically you are not grounded yet, do you know why?" Tony questioned with a grin stretching his face, causing the small pup to let out a smile of his own.
"What do you mean why? That eye-patch freak is trying to separate the two of you, that's why!" Serpentine huffed, playing with the spiders in her hands before growling and crushing them, causing Tony to grimace as he saw the black widows' bodies fell on the counter; Tony made sure to put in his mental list that he needed to wipe the counter off poison and spider guts later. "That bastard, who does he think he is? My baby is finally marrying the person he loves after years of torture, and that pirate dared to order you to break off with him! Gah! I should have done more than destroying that stupid organization he runs!" Serpentine huffed and puffed, shadows dancing behind her wildly as to show her anger.
So Tony, knowing that he was going to house a crazy Addams, did what every sane person will do… he decorated the room before Rogers did (With humans skeletons if Barnes was to be trusted) he made sure that the room was padded, in hope of the man not hurting himself (It wasn't because he knows that someone will end up trapped here and it wasn't even Rogers, nope!). He even made sure to write on the walls in dried red paint that looked like blood when it dried
It was then that Tony finally dared to kiss him, pressing kiss after kiss on Rogers's lips, though Rogers did not return them, only tilting his head; silent and curious, and when Rogers finally started kissing back Tony couldn't help but let out a chuckle. There was something predatory in the way Rogers was kissing him, a tease and a lure and a sharp pinch of teeth. He plucks at Tony's shirt, winding his hands under the soaking cloth and savoring the touch of his bare skin, the shirt bunching up as he works his way up to Tony's shoulders. Tony should stop him… he shuddered as Rogers mouthed at his throat, he really should… Tony though, did nothing of that sort, only letting out a hum and relaxed his body into Rogers's gripe…
"It is OK, Tony…" Steve whispered, putting his right hand on Tony's stab wound, pulling the Space Stone power, and tried to purify it with his magic, refusing for Tony to come close to the maddening power of one of the Infinity Stones. "Promise me you will return back to Midgard, Tony…" Steve whispered his lips wobbled when Tony shook his head. "Promise that you would take care of Peter and forget about your stupid quest of saving me. Promise me that you would forget about me…" The tears that left Tony's eyes, broke Steve even more, and Steve wondered how much Steve can handle before breaking off completely.
The sound of breaking glass made everyone look at Howard whose eyes were wide. "I'm such an idiot!" Howard exclaimed as he scrambled to stand up, Tony looked at his father like he had lost his mind, did his father called himself an idiot? Did Tony break him? What happened?
The next time Tony woke up, was to the sound of his door being knocked on, which made the man groan in pain and sit up, blinking his eyes in confusion when he saw that he was sleeping on the floor with his hammer beside him, which made the man tilt his head, he can't remember what happened last night after he went to bed. Before Tony can pounder on it more, the sound of the door and Clint's voice made him blink and stand up, rushing to open the door for the two of them fearing that they will break the door if he didn't.
They stayed for a month in the hospital, Steve getting more worried by the hours when his baby was struggling the first week, but after that, the little fighter managed to surprise everyone by pulling through, it made Steve proud when his little baby fought to keep his place in this world, it gave Steve strength to continue for another day…
"You are awake? You are awake, oh my God! You are awake…" Tony's voice cracks as he realized that this dream was a reality, that his Steve was awake, that his love was here with him and this beautiful dream was real; not something his tired mind cooked up because he was desperate to have his mate back once more.
"Of course, Mr. Stark." The doctor agreed with a gentle look on her face and she turned to the machine, a few seconds later Steve was holding six small picture of his baby, which caused Steve to give a wide smile, a happy laugh wanted to be known as he gazed at the shape of the small peanut in the picture…
"She is Steven Rogers' daughter isn't she?" Tony counter back, not caring about listening to the insane couple in front of him anymore, his hackles rising by the second as he took the couple he thought of as his family, he took them in and wondered if they were trying to find something to use against Tony, making him question himself more than he already was. "Isn't it why you are all over her? Because she is '
Tony couldn't help his right eyes from twitching, his left hand twitched too, Tony really, really, really, wanted to say to the hell with it and go beat Howard to a pulp. Really? Seventeen years and the first words out of that geezer's mouth is
"Darling, I want you to be honest with me sweetheart, does your Papa knows about you running away from home? Is he hurting you?" Tony asked the pup gently which made the pup shake his head as the tears start gathering in his eyes.
"Good morning," Steve whispered back, giving a soft purr when Tony started kissing the back of his neck, an action that caused Steve to sigh and snuggle back into Tony. "Tony let go… I need to start breakfast soon," Steve said as he tried to stretch; as much as Steve loved to spend the day in bed with Tony, Steve needed to start breakfast soon, he was hungry, and the baby was hungry, let's not forget Bucky who was probably starting coffee now. "Besides, we are going to choose a baby name for our daughter today, and you promised to help Bucky decorate our daughter's room," Steve stated causing Tony to sigh before letting go of Steve.
So far Peter was the most enthusiastic one about the baby, going on and on about finally being a big brother and taking the baby with him on adventures and all the other things ten years old would say before pleading with their parents to give the baby to someone else so they could sleep. Harley on the other hand was still a little bit unsure about the baby, probably feeling threatened by the arrival of the new family member; no matter how much Tony and Steve tried to assure the boy of his position in their family, Harley was still walking on eggshells, clinching to Steve and Tony every chance he had as if he was afraid they would kick him out. So far the numerous visits to Betty and many family therapies didn't work out, no matter how much Steve and Tony tried to make Harley see that he was one of them.
Steve sighed softly as he tried to open his eyes slowly, he felt like shit, but that wasn't something new to him, he felt like shit ever since his husband died, maybe even before that. The thing is, Steve and Tony both knew that the super-soldier wouldn't age like a normal human being, it made them suspicious, but it was confirmed in the end when the year 2030 arrived and Steve didn't look older than his mid-thirty, it made Steve concern, especially when his husband was in his early eighties and was getting older and older by the day, it was Dr. strange in the end who told them that Steve was bond to live a long, long life, for the serum that was created by Dr. Erskine was still an 'Unknown' in their universe, it had crushed Steve to think that he would outlive his husband and friends, and he may even outlive Fury, it seems that the only person who would outlive him by this point was Thor.
Steven knew when they reached the shore, after all, the energy was buzzing inside of the ship, everyone was in high spirit, even the guard, the only one who has a grim look on their faces were the Hydra servants, especially because reaching the shore meant that they will possibly lose their Queen, especially with the Iron King being involved, something that no one wanted to think about, someone that everyone fear will use and hurt their queen like Johann did, which was in the realm of possibility considering the northerners' reputation, that left nothing to be desired.
"What about me? That's not fair!" The boy whined as he shuffled, snuggling into the Omega's stomach more, glaring at his father, giving him a warning look, causing both Tony and Steve to let out a laugh. 'Brat' that's what the blond Alpha whispered, affection in every letter in the word; the Alpha grin as he ruffled the small boy's hair causing the boy to squeak, and try to slap the big hands away from his hair, which gained him nothing but happy laughter from both the adults surrounding him.
"Hey, Tony?" Steve cleared his throat, trying to keep his smile when the inventor raised his head and gave a questioning look. "Will you go will me to the ball?" At the confused look that crosses Tony's face, Steven sighed how stupid he acted, of course in this time they don't use the word 'ball' anymore. "The Maria Stark Foundation," Steve explained, causing Tony to blink his eyes before he starts laughing.
"But it was boring! All those people ever talk about was money, money, and how much pity they felt for the kids!" The pup whine which made Tony hide his laughter, the kid had nailed it, at such a young age and he realized what a lousy people those who came here were, excluded few who really cared about the children and not showing how much they donated for this case.
"My problem is you nearly killing yourself! Please, Tony, this isn't you!" Howard said as he pointed at the shape Tony was in, and Tony would have admitted he look like death warmed him over, with how thin and pale he was, the dark circles around his eyes didn't help that much.
If he looked at Tyber now, Anton will probably see how pale and sick the Beta looked, no wonder, especially when facing a person who you thought will have no power in pointing out your deception. "I am sorry but do I know you fair Omega?" Tyber tried to say in what he thought was a smooth voice, but Anton could only close his eyes and wince… Tyber should have stayed silent; it would have given him an extra few minutes to live.
Every night without fail, a call will come, and Steve and Tony will race to answer it, both of their heart pounding wildly in their chests when they both hear the sound of their Peter. God, how much did Tony miss Peter, he wanted the boy in his arms today; Tony may not be Peter's biological parent, but the small boy was his just as he was Steve's, and Tony missed him dearly, wondering why they couldn't bring Peter with them even when Tony know the reason to why.
Steven said which made the king pause and look at Steven with a strange look in his eyes, Steven could hear the whispers surrounding them, as the Vikings looked at one another then at Steven who was looking straight into the king's eyes without fear, the Omega was talking in their language.
"I know you wouldn't say something as distasteful as that, not when you hate Steven Rogers, so I accept there to be some truth in your words," Tony stated, raising his head high and looking at Fury from under his nose, waiting for what Fury's next action would be while hoping that the man would cut this off and tell him what he wanted.
Steve paused in his place, not knowing what to do when Bucky's lips made a connection with his, and maybe secretly he hoped he will be able to feel something, anything, that will discourage him from doing what he was thinking of doing, but sadly, there was nothing. Kissing Bucky was like kissing a family; just like the time Wednesday kissed him on the cheek so she could tie his hands up, it made him warm, yes, but other than that, nothing. Steve pulled away with a soft frown, causing Bucky to scuff his shoes and sigh.
It was hard, Tony discovered later as he spent the last hour trying to calm the pup getting desperate a little and nearly calling Steve, but the pup calmed down eventually and ended up sleeping in Tony's embrace which made the Omega sigh to himself as he tried to calm himself down a little when he sat on the living room's sofa with the small pup in his arms refusing to let go.
"I was foolish and got my heart broken; it's as simple as that." His words could do nothing but widen Thor's eyes, disbelieve and horror and pain burning inside of them, and Steven, he couldn't deal with such an express sent his way, he loathes being subject to that look, he suddenly straightens himself and left the room, leaving silence behind.
"Thank you, sweetheart, you are sweet!" Tony smiled at Harley, causing the boy to flush and look down at his feet like they were the most interesting thing in the whole world, which caused Tony to chuckle. "Tell me, Harley, do you wanna go to the movie tomorrow with us? I'm sure I can talk with Betty so she will allow you to come with us again." Tony's smile widens when he saw Harley's eyes widen in wonder; only for his eyes to deem after a while.
Also many thanks to my friend Stingray! Without Her, this chapter would have never been written at all!
Steve leaned down, taking Tony's mouth in another heated kiss. He tried his best to multitask, unbuttoning the silky shirt his husband was wearing as best he could try not to spend too much time trailing his hands over every bit of newly exposed flesh of his husband's chest along the way. Once the shirt was opened, Steve got to work on Tony's pants only to have the man push his hands away.
Tony could only smile as he shuffled closer to Steve, not that there was any space between them, to begin with, but Tony couldn't help himself, he just snuggled into Steve's warmth and took him in, smiling happily as he felt his heart pound in his chest as butterflies made themselves known in his stomach. A groan was heard a few minutes later, informing Tony that Steve was waking up.
! For taking those… those... nothing but bags of meat side! The king curled his mouth into a sneer as he gazed at the Omega's unflinching eyes.
The splashing coming from the lake made Anton still in his place, wondering if there was someone other than him who knew about the hidden lake (Which was unlikely, considering that Anton didn't see anyone come near this place ever since Mantta was built) and decided to use it for a swim. Anton could only frown, wondering if his journey here was for nothing; running his hand over his beard, Anton let out a huff as he walked toward the lake, deciding to take off his fur coat and take the swim he came here for. So what if someone came to take a swim before him? A harsh glare from Anton would shut even the chattiest person who wanted to get close to Anton. Taking his tunic off, Anton throws the tunic on the ground near his fur coat, taking the last few steps to break through the tree line toward the lake, hoping to take a nice dip in the water without being pestered by anyone.
"Fine, just a headache…" Steve said through his teeth, he couldn't say to them that the sound of singing was getting louder and louder, that Steve thought his eardrums were about to explode, that instead of a melodic singing it was a shrieking plea. Steve just swallowed, hoping nausea would pass away soon.
"We should crash the plane into Bermuda triangle!" Steve chirped happily, his words entering one of Tony's ears and leaving by using the other one. "Uncle Fester, you meet him at the wedding, he went there in the 1900s and went missing for 25 years! He said the place was fun, last time I checked it has a great internet connection…" Steve continue, babbling about how they should go and see this black hole and how romantic it would be to get lost in there and die together and other things that Tony was sure were one of the Addams family traditions or something.
"Do you have a family, Tony? A wife?" The woman asked once again which made Tony blink at that wondering why the woman will ask something like that and why did she sound as if she was choking on something, and it kind of made Tony tense a little but he tried to calm himself down and turn to the woman, watching her for her reaction.
The two of them went to the kitchen, Tony shakily following the floating ghost who was humming and singing under her breath, giving creepy giggles here and there as she went after the small dolls that infested Tony's mansion, like cockroaches. Tony kept his mouth shut the entire time, trying not to put his foot in his mouth more than he already did; Tony had this… feeling… feeling that Serpentine is far more dangerous than anyone Tony had the misfortune to meet, even more, dangerous than Steve, and Steve was another bag of terror by itself.
The hardest part of all was seeing Tony, seeing his beautiful husband so young, so full of life, waiting to take the world by storm as he always does. Tony always asked him about the future's techs, asked him to let him do a little tests on Edith promising to return the AI unharmed, but Steve couldn't, he couldn't give the last piece he had of his husband to anyone, even for his husband's youngest self, his husband gave him Edith on his dying bed, and he wasn't going to give the AI to anyone out there.
The first day of physical therapy was a nightmare of its own; Steve could only grunt and hiss as he tried to move his muscles for the first time on his own in seven years (As all the doctors like to say) apparently Steve was recovering well and faster for a patient who was in a coma for a long time all thanks to his husband who spent the last seven years taking care of him and helping him exercise his body; that thought alone made Steve's blood boil, the thought of Barnes touching him while he was asleep and defenseless nearly summon a snarl out of him.
"I apologize…" A voice behind Tony made the inventor jump and turn around, brandishing the soldering iron like a weapon, which Tony lowered after seeing that the person who scared him was no one other than Rogers, which Tony knew that if he wanted he needed the Iron Man armor to even scare that man and not a small soldering iron that probably won't even damage the soldier, even when it was a dangerous instrument.
It started as a normal morning, a good one too… Steve was the gentleman he always was, taking care of Tony and Peter making sure that the two of them got their breakfast and enjoy their time, he even took them out to the park, mainly for Peter so that the little boy will play with kids his age, while Tony and Steve sat in the back on one of the benches next to each other, talking and laughing, with Tony telling Steve about his plan of installing his Ai in the house as a security system.
Tony snarled as he tried to push through the electric bearer that was their prison cage that was put in the middle of the room, hissing when the bearer melted the outside layer of his suit, everything was fine, more than fine even! They were able to save the hostages that Hydra took and threatened to kill… only for those hostages to turn out to be Hydra's agents, Tony didn't know how Hydra was even able to win and capture them, throwing them into these cells, but the Alpha was going to grumble and say it was because Bruce wasn't with them on this mission so they couldn't use the Hulk to get them out, so that meant it was up to Tony to find a way to save his teammates and himself… just when he finally was able to have the talk he desperately wanted with his Omega.
"Yes, yes, well, you see Ma'am, I am looking for a house or something of that sort to buy… hopefully moving in it, too, by today or tomorrow in the latest…" Tony's words trailed off, already knowing that he probably sounded crazy to the woman's ears, and Tony won't fault her if she called security on him, the police chief maybe? Though the woman just hummed and went to her desk opening her computer and looking through it after a few clicks on the keyboard, pointing to Tony to sit down on one of the chairs near him.
"Oh, that… I forget about it. I am sure Steve is a nice person, maybe he married Bucky and forget about the deal, don't worry… holy shit, Tony!" Tony was done when he heard Howard's bullshit; he just took the vase throw it at Howard with a battle cry, ignoring the shriek both of his parents let out when Tony dove for the kill. He was done, Tony was so, so done; he was going to end this for once and for all! Screw his parents for selling him, and screw him for hoping that they felt something when they abandon him, they were the same as they were when he was a child, it was true that his only parents and family were the Jarvis and the Carters families.
When he turns around he found that it was Dummy who did it, by the orders of JARVIS. He doesn't remember what happened that night, other than how he screamed at JARVIS and Dummy, how he chased the robot hoping to get the knife back, how he screamed and cried and begged them to just give it back, that he wanted to be with his baby… he didn't remember much other than JARVIS' words that left him shaken…
"I have every right… it was that or jail, remember." Steve's final word seemed to be the last straw because Carter growled darkly, turning to Tony with murderous eyes as if she was blaming him for what was happening to her, Tony could only stand straight, his head held high as he dared the woman to do something to him where everyone is waiting for them.
"So you are the leader? Took you long enough! Do you know how long I've been here waiting?!" Steven inhaled sharply and closed his eyes if he had thought that he will be able to reason with the leader about sparing his son then it will be even impossible because of Johann's foolishness. The Viking Chief, however, didn't answer. He just eyed Johann for a moment and then raised a brow, seeming to reassess the king with disapproving eyes. That didn't sit well with Johann, of course, who foolishly stepped forward as he continued to yell, "Are you not listening to me, you foolish savage?! You are in the presence of your king, so you better-" Though Johann wasn't able to finish his words because suddenly...
The sound of the doorbell caused Tony to blink, wondering who the person on the other side was; considering most of his friends would just barge in and make themselves at home after complaining about their day. Wiping his hands Tony looked around to see that he nearly finished the sandwiches, causing him to hum and walk to the door, trying to think about who was knocking on his door, was it Bucky forgetting about his keys and running from Winnie once more? Tony lost count on how many times Bucky escaped from his home after Winnie started pestering him about having kids and marrying Natasha.
Steve though, looked at Tony for a long time, making the Omega a little nervous but then the Alpha gave him a sad smile. "They got into a car accident nine and a half years ago, the only survivor is May, but she is in a coma to this day." Steve said which made Tony hold himself from taking a deep inhale, shock freezing him in his place.
"You are late." Everyone flinched and glanced around when they heard the voice reverberating through the walls, when they raised their heads they saw that Steven was already watching them, resting with his back to the wall with Bucky sleeping soundly his head in Steven's lap, who was gazing at them with crimson eyes, binding them in place, and for a second they all feared what will take a place. After Steven was done with the last Hydra agent, Edith finally cleared the lockdown, permitting the Avengers to run after Steven, and by that point, no one actually preferred to go in dread of what the man will do to them, but in the end, they accept it and get ready to head to Hydra's HQ, and hopefully, by then Steven will be back like how he was before.
"Of course, come in!" The man offered with a gentle smile, opening the door for Sarah, causing the woman's breath to stutter at the thought of going inside the house after all these years that passed, it was only the gentle understanding look the young man offered her selflessly made Sarah brave enough to take the first step inside the house, followed by another, and another, until she was inside, her eyes were wide at the changes she was seeing. "My name is Tony Rogers, Ma'am." Hearing that name, caused Sarah to take a shocked breath and turn to the young man who led her to the kitchen, where there was a kettle on the stove. "I must say I have been excited to meet the person my husband always talks about." Tony, smiled as he went to prepare tea, causing Sarah to tilt her head, her eyes tearing up as she finally placed where she saw the young man before.
The months passed, and Steve was getting used to the life of single parenting, on top of caring for the baby, Steve had to go to work in hope of paying rent and the bills that kept on getting larger and larger, Steve prayed for a miracle to happen when his son starts crying loudly for the third time in an hour.
"He looks like someone you know, doesn't he?" Howard teased causing Tony to pout and send his father an annoying glare, which only gained a chuckle from the older man as he went to check the garlic bread in the oven. "Tony, I can already see how an amazing life that kid is going to have; the four of you have been bonding for over a year now, and Steve told me that Harley adores you, everything is going to be fine." Howard smiled, causing Tony to hum and lower his head, his lips twitching up in a smile despite himself.
Snarled a familiar voice making Tony flinch, an action that Steve noticed too well, for he turned to Stane and gave him a look; if Stane was alive he would have been dead all over again.
"Thank you for the reminder, I will take him off your hands." Tony said as he walked toward Steven, taking Peter into his arms, smiling when his son snuggled into his chest, murmuring something that sounds suspiciously like 'Lucky Star' which caused Tony to chuckle a little at the sleepy murmur his baby was letting.
Tony hummed as he went through his list once more only to see that he had finished the list, which meant he can either go to the register… or it will give him free rein to buy what he wants! It's not like he doesn't have the money for it, and Tony admits that the only reason for him to have the list is because of Steve; usually, when Tony goes shopping by himself he will throw everything that he fancies in his car without a second thought about it being healthy or not. But ever since Peter and Steve start living with him, his life took a turn to the healthy road, to both Pepper and Rhodey's disbelieve who made fun of him for that; it doesn't mean that Tony's house stopped being the candy wonderland it is!
"Mama! Papa promised that I will train with you today!" Peter squealed happily as he ran toward the Omega hugging his legs tightly which made a gentle smile taking over Tony's face as he kneeled down and held the baby, giving a happy sigh at the content scent he picked up, pride filling his chest until it felt like it was about to burst open when his baby spoke with a perfect pronunciation like was an adult, Tony thinks that he needed to thank his mother, after all, the woman took it on herself to teach Peter whatever his babe had in mind.
"The most important thing is that you take care of yourself Tony, but it's ok to spoil yourself once in a while." Tony and Dr. Cho said goodbyes after that, with Tony, going home in happier mood then he was months ago, thinking about what he was going to do, he already packed his things (Pepper and Happy did, they wouldn't even let him raise a spoon if they could) and he had already sent Dummy and his new AI into their new home. He finally finished the AI, and he ends up naming him JARVIS if he gave him a British accented voice? No one needs to know. He already installed JARVIS in his new home, it was an amazing place to be in, big and spacious, with lots of room for him and the baby (And maybe a Good Alpha if he found one) he already turn the basement into his new lab, even after finishing his house, there was still a lot of space in there to be used, and lots of rooms were waiting to be turned to something else other than guests rooms.
Tony felt something small sit by his side leaning on him, hugging him? It made Tony sob harder at that, he didn't know how much time passed, but by the time Tony stopped, his head was killing him, he looked to his left side to see the pup that spoke to him a while ago sitting beside him, playing with the grass with a concentrated look on his small face. "Thank you…" Tony whispered which made the small boy blink and look at Tony; the Omega had to hold himself last he cries once again, as big brown eyes were looking at Tony with so many emotions on the child's face.
/Warning/: This Chapter contains, cursing, sadness, crying, anxiety, near mental break down, near child kidnapping, a little bit of violence, fluff! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
"He… he wouldn't be angry that I damage the rings… right?" Tony asked hearing his aunt huff and massages her forehead calling Tony an idiot, and Tony really felt like an idiot for damaging the rings, it wasn't like he meant for it to happen! He just saw the rings and something inside of his just… just snapped, his wolf just screamed 'Mine' until he finally took the rings, at first he thought that the rings were enchanted with magic, or it was a rear metal that controls minds or something, he didn't imagine it would be Vibranium from Steven's Shield, it explains why Steven didn't have his Shield when he fell into Tony's lab, he destroyed the Shield to create the rings because Tony knew that Steve's Shield was not pure Vibranium, and that to collect that much Vibranium as he saw in the rings, meant that Steven completely destroyed his Shield and any lingering chance of being Captain America ever again.
Steve paused at the question not knowing what to do, should he tell his baby that his father had left them, or should he tell him that he died? After all, both answers were correct to some extent, his Anthony Carbonell had left him alone in this world, he died when he refused to answer Steve's pleas and letters, Steve was only nineteen and a half when he realized that he was pregnant, he was still a child himself, and a year later Tony Stark appeared to the world. "He is abroad… working." Steve ends up saying which made Peter look at him with wide eyes. "Your Daddy was an inventor baby, the best of the best, so Wakanda…" Steve had always told his baby the stories that the kind doctor had told him years and years ago, Steve made sure to pay his respect to the kind doctor every time he went to visit his mother, because if it wasn't for the older man and his kind heart, Steve would have been stuck in that shitty apartment struggling. "They plead with him to come and help them because they wanted to teach their daughter the princess how to become the best engineer… he will come when he finished his work there." Steve ends up saying which made Peter's eyes sparkle which joy and he starts asking Steve to tell him more about his father, Steve hated himself for lying, but…
At night Antonette will tell him stories from her imagination, she will whisper how he came to her and saved her from her mad husband, how he will take her away from all the pain and how they will fly in the skis together forever, how he will never hurt her, how she loved him. "Sir Steven… that will be your name from now on, such a beautiful and noble name..." Antonette said one night out of blue, and he stopped breathing for a second.
Tony furrow his brows at James actions, he knows his brother, he also knows that a loose punch like this would have made James dodge it, not stay in his place and gaining a black eye in the process, why would James do that? He will gain nothing from this, unless… "Bucky!" Steve's panicked voice made Tony's eyes widen in disbelieve, his jaw fell when he was pushed by Steve who rushed toward James to check on him. "What did you do Tony?" Steve snapped after checking over James and help him sit up, Steve than stood up and glare at Tony with anger that caused the Alpha to take a step back.
"Not at all, Steve, the boy was an angel as usual, so who is your friend?" The Beta asked looking at Bucky with narrow eyes making the Alpha shiver a little at the suspicious look he was at the end of, but the woman gains his respect for being protective of Steve, God knows what the punk would have thrown himself into if she wasn't there.
What Steve didn't realize was the shocked woman he left in his wake, Peggy sit still, trying to make sense of what happened just a minute ago, she then stood and shakily brushed the man's hair off of his face to get a better look, when she studied him closely she discovered that he indeed looked like Steve, but he was… he was older? The only differences were the few laughing lines on his face and the white hairs that were mixed with his blond. But what throws her off was not his age, no, what throws her off was that he smelled like a… a Beta? No, that wasn't right, Peggy leans toward the man's neck and sniffed, she desperately hoped that no one was watching her or they will think she went crazy… the man's scent was full of power… so much power it burdens on insane, it made the hair on the back of her neck stand on its ends, he smelled of lightning, rain, and roses, thinking about it the man smelled like Thor, maybe he was Asgardian? It would explain why he smelled like this after all Thor told her that his people don't have the Alpha/Beta/Omega Dynamic the humans have.
Reaching the man road, the Alpha had to stop himself from letting out an angry roar when he saw Hamar stepping on his babe's hand, while his baby was crying and trying to wiggle out of the lesser Alpha's hold, just as he was about to rush toward his son, an angry snarl was let loose, nearly causing him to shiver to the bones at the fury and rage it holds, and from the corner of his eye, he saw the foolish queen rush toward Hamar and tackling him to the ground, far away from his babe as he could.
An old voice said, making Steven turn to old Philips as the man leaned on the bars looking at him, his head bandaged informed Steven that the hit he gained from Johann was harder than it looked, the old man's question made Steven pause at those words... what is he to say?
"Wait! Did Steven make a joke?" Clint asked with a mocked gasp, which got him a slap on the back of the head from Natasha and an eye roll from everyone else, though Steven snorted at that and a smile twitched on his lips, so Clint took that as a win and stuck his tongue at Natasha who narrowed her eyes on him.
That made Steve's mouth drop a little, no; this was not his Anthony… Anthony wanted to change the world for better, he wanted to save people's lives, make it better, he wanted to invent and for his invents to use for good, like Dummy and JARVIS, this… this was not him, that was a cruel man, that was… it made Steve shiver at the laughter he heard coming from the TV, it made him turn away from the screen and change the channel… it seems that his Anthony was dead, or never exist it the first place.
"I did not know that you were capable of making herbal drink without burning it to ashes, princess." The king said as he took the Omega, the blond man was blowing gentle on his drink before taking a sip, humming a little before he throws the Alpha an unimpressed look, which the king pressed his lips tightly at the action, not wanting to start another screaming match with the Omega while the children were asleep.
Tony was smiling all through breakfast, sending playful looks to Steve which the Omega only rolled his eyes at but an amused smile stayed on Steve's face as he went to serve his husband another cup of coffee, knowing that the Alpha will be grumpy all morning if he didn't drink his two-morning cups of Joe, which something that Steve always argued about with Tony, as he scolded him about his unhealthy coffee addiction.
"Oh my God, a girl; I'm having a girl, Buck! A baby girl!" Steve breathed out as the two of them left the appointment, Steve was holding back his embarrassing squeals of delight at the thought of him having a baby girl to spoil and hold in his arms without letting her go. Just the thought of him holding her and granting her every wish was enough to make butterflies flutter inside his stomach.
He let out a shaky breath and crawled to his son… why was he even trying? He was the reason Jarvis died, his parents and Aunt Peggy died from an attack on SI, and Stane killed Angie, killing the last family he had, and his friends probably forgot about him, and his baby… God, his baby was dying in front of him and he couldn't do anything to stop it… he reached his baby and touched his burning cheek, he kissed his forehead and lied down beside him holding him tightly… Stark men are made of Iron… Pff, Yeah, right… as if that was true… he can't do this anymore, he can't, he can't! He wants out, out, out of here! But what's the use? He has no one, he promised himself a long time ago that he won't break! He was a Stark he was made of Iron… and Iron melts at the temperature of 1538 Celsius… Jarvis, his parents, Peggy and her mate Angie they all were 1536 Celsius just enough to bent him but not break him… but his baby… his Peter was all it takes to finally do it…
…" His mother used to whisper these words to him when he was a child; his mother who was protective of him until the end of her life, even when she was at the end of the Hydra king's sword, she protected him until the bitter end.
Starkad though was feeling guilty, for only now he noticed his son who was sitting a little farther away from them, gazing at the Omega with teary eyes; the tears refusing to slide down his face, but Starkad noticed how the boy was clenching his hands in anger uncaring of his injuries; as the Alpha stood up, his movement seemed to snap Petrus out of his frozen statue and he too scrambled to stand, ignoring Braes's concern as he followed Starkad who adjusted the Omega in his arms until he was holding him tightly, not fearing that he will fall.
"One slave and the rest of them are workers… Magna, if you will please find jobs and a house for them…" The king spate through his teeth like saying those words were like a poison he was forced to drink and was trying to spit it out, something that gave Steven pride as he straightens himself and gave the king a mocking innocent smile, which gained him a hiss from the king, like an angry lion who got his tail squashed by a rock.
So here Tony was fighting Loki, unfortunately, he wasn't able to corner Loki alone and ask of him to break Rogers' spell, considering that the man wanted to do nothing but to kill Tony as he seemed to target the brunette even after Tony screamed at the crazy man to stop, but as always no one listens to him. Rogers though seemed to be enraged, especially when Tony didn't pay the man any attention, but spent all of his time trying to dodge Loki's attacks that wanted to cut him in half, and Rogers' face became dark as time pass and Tony didn't care to even give him an annoyed glance.
"But don't worry! Tomorrow night we are going to have a picnic outside in the garden. I'm sure Peter will talk your ears off and force you to tell him the story of every star in the sky." Tony stated, holding his sigh of relief when he saw Steve shining once again after a small smile made it over Steve's face.
"Is Betty here?" Tony asked getting a nod from the Omega as she gave Tony directions to the staff room, making the Omega hum at that. "I will talk to you later, Darcy." Tony said as he walked toward the staff room waving for the Omega, sending concern looks to Peter and Steve, the Alpha was crooning to the pup, and kissing his forehead which made Tony's heart flutter at the scene before him.
That was Tony's voice shrieking followed by howling of agony, it had been nine months since Tony's heat finished, six months since the discovered that Tony was expecting, something that they thought Tony will hate, but the Omega surprised them, being the most enthusiastic about the news of another baby, followed by Peter and Steve.
"Peggy…" Steve's panicked voice made Peggy leave Stane and rush to Steve… "Call the ambulance, fast!" Steve said as he jumps through the hole he made, making Peggy scream at him to come back, Steve looked around the place to see a dark corridor ending with a metal door, Steve run toward it all the while, hearing the singing get fainter, fainter, fainter… when Steve reached the door he could hear the sound of footsteps follow him from behind but Steve didn't mind them, he raised his Shield and start hitting the lock until it broke down and the door swing open, what he saw made him nearly trip as he took a step back from the shock…
"…'s…'k…" Steve slurred, his voice being faint, causing tears to slide down Tony's face faster; Tony could only lean down and kiss Steve's hand with shaky lips, his breath shuddering in his chest. "Pete…?" Steve murmured, blinking his eyes tiredly.
“He did what!” The Alpha snarled, practically causing Tony to jump in fear, his body frozen in place as he gazed at Sarah waiting for what the woman will do. “Doesn't he ever learn? Did he even think about Peter before thinking about his knot? Does he want a repeat of what happened years ago? Is-“ Before Sarah can continue with her rant, Tony cut her with a snarl. He couldn’t believe that Sarah will say such a thing; he couldn’t even fathom how she insulted her only son just because he decided to move on; that is not her being protective of her son, that was her being controlling! And for what? Because Steve was in one failed relationship, it suddenly means that his sense of judgment was bad? What happened to Sarah? This was not the woman that Tony met and looked up to.
Maria looked at the house in front of her with a blank face; it was only because she didn't know what to feel, sitting in her car and looking at the house that spoke family and love, looking at the pup in the blue baseball cap, sitting on the small flight of stairs to his house's front porch, holding a screwdriver as he tinkered with whatever machine that was in his small hands… he was so much like her bambino when he was a child… she wondered if this was the kind of life Tony would have had if his plan worked and Howard didn't know about it. Would Maria find Tony here in this house, sitting near his son and teaching him how to tinker with the device in his hands, smiling happily when the pup will say and do something that brought the smile on everyone's faces? Would he smile proudly when the pup will fix whatever problem it was with the machine?
"'Morning, Mr. Stark, Mr. Jarvis." The pup muttered as he rubbed his eyes with his fist, yawning as he looked around the place with sleepy eyes, Tony nearly squeal at the adorable sight, and he had to give it to Steve for not jumping when he heard the AI repeated the young pup's greeting, which caused the Omega to smile, make sure that his wallet, keys, and anything he needed was with him.
"But… but Peter knows about his father, right?" Bucky whispered/asked looking at the kitchen's door afraid that the pup was going to come running any minute now, it would be a disaster if the pup didn't know about his father, it would be a disaster and heartbreak on both the pup and the parents' sides, and just thinking about the pup looking heartbroken was enough for Bucky's hackles to rise.
When he finally reached the HQ, the Omega took a shuddering breath as he gathered himself as much as he could, taking off his Nano-mask and leaving it in the car. He knew that no one would let him in unless they saw his real face. He tried to shove away the discomfort of leaving the car with his real face, hating the fear he was feeling at the thought of a reporter waiting for him around the corner, but the Omega soldiered on, getting out of the car and walking towards the door with a raised head. He tried to stop himself from trembling, wanting to find Steve and hold him, as the past month had been like torture to the Omega, mentally and physically.
From Rogers's side of things, he finally manages to make Bucky remember him, even if Bucky sometimes space out and couldn't focus on him, his mind still not healed enough to handle everyday life. Though Steven, even if he hates Rogers he couldn't see Bucky suffer anymore, and after a long talk with Rogers, the Alpha ended up accepting Steven's advice of finding a therapist for Bucky.
It was only a few more seconds before everything went down, the sound of a broken door reached Steve, and then the gunshots were heard, causing Steve to flinch and rush to hide in the bathroom's tube in fear of a stray bullet hurting him or his baby. Whatever was taking a place on the outside of the door was hell from the sound of it; screams of the police, the snarl of his stalker, the guns that kept firing… it was probably fifteen minutes before everything became quiet, but to Steve, it as forever until this nightmare was over.
"You know what to do, soldier." Zola said with a smugly satisfied expression on his face, he presumably thought that the shock and the rage clouded Steven's face was from him seeing that the soldier in front of him was his long-lost friend and that Steven won't do anything to struggle least he injured that said friend. Unfortunately for Zola though, he had just signed for death when he left the room, leaving Steven with Bucky alone; just a few moments more, and Steven sower that he will unleash what he struggled to suppress for years, and wipe out all of Hydra today.
It was nice, more than nice really, and it made Tony think that the lake monster (If such a thing exists) wasn't all that bad; because if the monster was really as bad as dream-Ty stated, than Tony would have been dead a long time ago, not being protected and looked after and ending up feeling safe and content every time he enters the lake. So with no one to stop him or scold him about doing things he shouldn't; Tony continued to take the boat and row to the middle of the lake, humming to himself and singing silly songs, sometimes he will tell whoever was listen to some stories of his childhood.
Steve was shocked, that was the only thing he could feel at the moment; he didn't know if his shock was about how Tony could act like this in front of his brother. It was then that anger replaced the shock he felt, anger at Tony for ignoring his calls, anger at him for abandoning him on the most important day of their life, anger at his husband for snapping at him when he was the one wrong, and the most important one, anger at his Alpha for embarrassing him in front of his brother. "Out…" Steve said through gritted teeth, it was the only word he can get out without him starting a shouting match with Tony; he doesn't want Bucky to feel out of place than he already was.
"You? You!" Tony growled as he advanced toward Bucky, ignoring how Bucky tensed like he was preparing to go into a fight, the sight in front of him shook Steve, it reminds him of that dream. "It was you who took him out! What was your plan huh? What did you think you were doing by taking my husband out, who do you think you are?" Tony snapped, causing Steve to flinch; pain and hurt took over Steve's heart, not only he caused his husband to get angry with him, he caused him to fight with his brother, what has he done?
There were many options Tony was considering, ranging from taking them to the park to inviting Howard for dinner (If he didn't go to Malibu to work) to taking them to eat out; sadly, all the options made Tony pout because he was sure that Peter would try and invite the whole neighborhood if they decided to go on a picnic… where is Steve when you need him?
... he felt like he was choking, he who starts trying to fix Dum-E, as a way to ask for forgiveness, begging a machine to forgive him because he was a coward… a coward who decided to crash his plane nose-first in the ice, because he couldn't handle losing his mate, he who thinks that the AI was his only friend who truly accepts his craziness, who talked with an AI more than he talks with his friends, he who made JARVIS show him Tony's old college books and plans, so he can learn, so he can become a good engineer, so he can finally fix Dum-E, and gain forgiveness from someone who is long gone… gone for six years, three months, two weeks, five days, one hour, twenty minutes, and ten seconds… not like he was counting or anything…
"Sorry babe, but I really needed to go." Tony got up as he said that going to Steve and kissed the Omega tenderly before quickly drinking the rest of his coffee and grabbing his Jacket. It was only a few seconds before he rushed toward the front door, Happy was already waiting for Tony, which made the Alpha, nodded to him as he got inside of the car.
It made Steve pause and give a sad smile as he remembered his friends, everyone was with him when Natasha had asked that question, everyone wanted to ask him questions of their own.
Though the man didn't do anything of that sort, he didn't attack Steve nor did he flinch when he felt Steve's hand on his shoulder, and when James raised his head, his eyes weren't glossed over, lost in a painful world of violence and pain and explosions, no, the Alpha's eyes were clear, but they were clouded with pain like he was hurting physically, and the brunt closed his eyes and tighten the hold on his head which made realization painted the Omega face. Steve rushed quietly toward the curtains and closed them heading to the lights next, trying to make the room as dark as it can get, the Omega had never had any migraine before, but his mother did, so he knows what to do, though his mother's migraine never acted this badly as to make her cry on the floor as she held her head begging for mercy.
Tony wrapped his arms around Steve's back and Steve rubbed his hands up Tony's arms to settle on his shoulders. He fingered the buttons questioningly and Tony gave his permission in a soft tightening of his embrace. After a few moments, they broke apart for air. Not breaking eye contact Steve slowly opened the buttons and pulled the shirt off Tony's shoulders. Tony let him, staring at Steve's face in turn. When the shirt lay carelessly on the floor; Steve followed his example by pulling off his shirt.
"He… I do not know how to explain it exactly but… you can say he is famous in Asgard and the nine realms." Thor mumbled his gaze turning to the man with wonder, and everyone can see the determine taking over Thor's face. "He can see what is to happen… a gift from the Norns themselves." Everyone turned to Steven when Thor told them these words and Tony scuff at that.
So after pleading and whining and crying to Bucky about how trapped he was feeling and how he was turning into a depressed whale (Making Bucky panic when hormones got the better of Steve and he started to cry) Bucky finally allowed Steve to go to the supermarket, but only if Bucky came with him. This was how Steve ended up here, walking through the supermarket as Bucky kept a lookout for any suspicious individuals; Steve was grateful to Bucky, he really was the Alpha stood by his side through the thick and thin, a position that his absent husband should fill.
Reaching the police station, Tony finally let out a sigh, wondering how much time he was going to have with Fury before Peggy and Bucky decided to interfere; Tony hoped that he would have enough time to decide what he was going to do with his future. "I am here to see Fury," Tony said as soon as he saw Carol, Tony could only glare at the woman especially when the only thing she did was blink and look at him strangely.
Today was one of the good days it seems, Harley didn't have any anxiety or aggravate his asthma from how wound up he became, plus Howard was coming to babysit the kids because according to him, he missed the two street urchins (He mainly say that, because the Harley and Peter always win his money in card games). Taking it as their chance, Steve and Tony went to the doctor's appointment, both of them were excited and a little bit overwhelmed about the news they would no doubt receive.
Steve just shook his head at that, the sound of ping from his pocket made him frown then pull Peggy's phone out of his pocket, he was still waiting for Natasha to fix his phone, and holding Peggy's phone a hostage… he knows that no one knows this number other than their friends. Steve thought for a bit then shrugs and decided to read the letter, when Steve opened the letter his breath left him and he dropped the phone in fear…
The boats traveled for four days without stopping, in that time Steven was still in the cellar with his friends, and it made him angry that no one had shown up since that redheaded Alpha, it was like they were all forgotten, but on the other hand, they were giving their meals daily twice a day, which was a miracle considering that they were held as slaves to be traded later for nasty owners who will treat them like they were the scum that walked on earth.
"What woman?" Peter asked curiously his eyes going from Harley to Tony, probably trying to connect if the woman who came today was the same one who came months ago and caused Tony to go to the hospital.
"A den deprived bear…" Anton confirmed, his free hand going to the reins as he tried to calm his horse, fearing that he would be bucked off if the horse continued to act this scared. Anton words gained many gasps and murmurs, the shock taking over everyone at the realization of who was the foe they were facing; this had never happened before, never happened and everyone accepted that it never will, especially when this neck of the woods doesn't have any family of bears in it since the start of their village, and even if it did, all bears should be asleep now that winter was approaching. Everyone wondered what they are to do, should they leave the bear alone and retreat? Or should they attack? So far the bear kept watching them without making a move.
"I see." Maria hummed giving a smile to Morgan who let out a few noises of complained until Tony started humming a cheerful song under his breath. "The DIY section is in the back, do you want me to come guide you there?" Maria asked, and Tony had to stop himself from frowning at her obvious offer of trying to follow him.
"Are you happy Tony?" Howard finally asked after a short while of silence, causing Tony to blink his eyes in confusion. But Tony as always was smart and seemed to realize what Howard meant because his eyes soften and his smile became the pure definition of happiness causing Howard's heart to pound in his chest; this, this was the look that Howard longed to see on his son's face, this was the look he and Maria wished Tony will have when he will see his one and only, and it seems that God has heard his prayers because Tony has that look on his face.
was dead, couldn't handle Jarvis pleading looks that always begged him to do something. Steve couldn't handle this madhouse anymore, so in the end, he talked with Peggy about him wanting to have a place in Shield that he wanted to go on missions once more that he was getting sick of waiting here. Peggy took pity on him and starts sending him on missions once more… he was grateful.
"Shush, little one, I am fine, I am here, and no one is taking me away." Steven whispered, giving his pup a gentle smile as he kissed his forehead, whispering soft words of love and encouragements in his ear, causing James to whine and hide his face in Steven's neck, shaking as Steve ran his hand on the boy's back, trying to calm him down least he got sick from all the crying.
"Look what I found in the dumpster!" Tony cheered, raising the baby for Steve to see, only for his husband to scrunch his nose at the child, like it was something nasty; Tony won't blame Steve, this was his initial reaction before the little kid bites him.
Fury's lips twitched down before a tired smile took over his face, his eyes taking in a distant look like he was thrown far away in the past. "Yes, that's true." Fury stated, blinking his eyes and letting out a tired sigh. "It all started with Sharon, Peggy's sister. No one noticed at first, how she became distant and withdrawing, how she turned her back on everything… no one noticed but Steven Rogers. Before his death, Rogers comes to talk with me, back then I had just graduated from the police academy, but Rogers still came to me; maybe because our parents were friends or maybe something else, I don't really know. But two days before his death, he came to me and told me about Pierce, about how the man was not what he seemed, about how he was assaulting Sharon, about some of his nefarious plans… no one really believed him, and I am ashamed to say I too didn't, not even with the evidence he provided." Fury whispered, pressing his lips tightly with a thoughtful look.
Edith said after she hacked into the towers speakers, which made Tony squeak at the words he was at the end of, his face becoming red from embarrassment and a little bit of anger, he never thought he will be sassed to death by an AI with his mother's voice, though if Tony was true to himself, he knows that these words will be the exact words his mother will say to him if she was alive. "Amateur? Do you even know who I am, I created J! You can ask him and Dummy about my excellent work!" Tony said waving his fist to the ceiling hoping that the sassy AI will see reason.
"W-what did you do, Tony?" Steve's voice cracked as he said those words, and he only realized he spoke when the Alpha turned to him and blinked his eyes, grinning when his sight felt on his Omega.
Tony closed his eyes, trying to banish the question in the far away corner of his mind… and maybe he wanted to learn a little bit about Rogers.
"I never asked you how you spent Clint's heat with him, did I?" Tony asked just to be a little shit, grinning madly when Angie shriek and whirl on Natasha who tensed like a bow, ready to dash any minute now that Angie's eyes settled on her, it was only a few seconds of intense staring before Angie charged at Natasha, which caused the redhead squeak (Something that Tony knows Natasha will choose death than admitting) and ran out of the room with Angie hot on her heels.
"Mama!" Morgan squealed as she waddled around the gardens, her childish giggles getting louder and louder as Tony raced after his baby, catching her and twirling with his baby in his arms, causing the girl to squeal and laugh loudly, her arms and legs flying all around the place.
6-Bears were sacred animals in Norse mythology, not only were they kept as pets, were gifted to kings, and were used in ritual sacrifices. The Norse Gods Thor and Odin often took the shape of a bear to visit the human world. The bear stands for strength, healing, inner wisdom, and balance between the seen and the unseen world. The female bear was the symbol for the feminine aspect and principle and the male bear was the masculine principle. That's why everyone went mad when Ty tried to kill the bear that left them unharmed, some thinking that the bear was either Odin or Thor.
"Oh, that? Those were just dummies." Steve said with an innocent smile, not knowing that he just signed his and Tony's parents' death. Tony could only twitch when he saw the smile on Steve's face, his lips twitching in a sneer that seemed to frighten everyone in the dining room if the flinch that Bucky and Natasha let out was anything to go by.
"No! Papa will never hurt me, I promise!" The pup said when Tony looked at him with a strange look. "It's just… ever since Papa and I came here from home, he is always sad… I just wanted to make him happy, want to buy him something… but that mean man came and start dragging me…" Tears start running down the pup's face, which made Tony wipe them away pulling the pup to his chest shushing him gently while rocking the pup, which made the child hide his face in Tony's neck sniffing. "Papa… gonna be angry." The child muttered sniffing and shaking.
