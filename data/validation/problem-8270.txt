"Funny story actually, Stevie and I have spent, what, our entire lives trying to get jobs at the same place. Sad, huh?" Bucky joked, "But anyways, he saw the job vacancies and called me up all excited, so I couldn't go letting him down."
He and Bucky had been best friends ever since they were 8 years old, when Steve got into a fight with some older boys. They'd been pulling on this brunette's pigtails, and he'd stepped in to try and stop them. It worked... mostly. They left the girl alone, but only so they could turn their attention to Steve and start beating him to a pulp. Bucky had stepped in, telling them "pick on someone your own size!" and proceeding to (somehow) beat up the biggest guy. The others ran for it, leaving Steve on the ground with a bloody nose and mouth agape at the boy who'd actually stuck up for him.
were they a lovely sight. He mentally upgraded Steve from 'companions' to 'eye candy with a side of friendship'.
"Right, let's go see the big guy in the office." Clint said, and they all resumed walking.
Tony quickly cuts off that train of thought, forcing it back into the darkest corner of his mind, refusing to face reality. He returns his attention to the computer, to the document full of false starts and cliché concepts.
“Are you sure?”
Steve’s hands are back on him like they never left. Like he never
For a split-second Tony thinks he’s flying. But he’s not in the suit—it’s
“Tony!” Steve’s voice comes through loud and clear and audibly relieved, which melts some of that frozen terror still lodged in Tony’s chest. “124 5th Avenue—we managed to lure the Crew down to the basement, but—” Steve’s report cuts off with a startled, agonized cry. Tony curses and heads for the address, flying right through the front entrance (which isn’t really an entrance anymore so much as a giant hole in the wall) and dropping down through the gaping hole in the center of top floor all the way to the basement. The Wrecking Crew did some heavy damage in a short amount of time, as is their way, but Tony isn’t worried about the bill right now.
Like a shot, Steve is up and holding on to Tony so he doesn’t hop backwards into the glass coffee table. One arm wrapped around his back and the other hand on his bicep, Steve steadies Tony as Tony searches underfoot for whatever hurt him.

, and that’s fine, Tony hates himself plenty enough for both of them, but neither does Steve wrap Tony in a hug like Tony wishes he would. Instead, Steve just laughs quietly, the sound puffing out of his nose in a short burst, lips turning up at the corners. He looks ten years younger.
“You’d better,” Steve growls, so low and rough it makes Tony gasp wetly against his crotch, because apparently Tony is
But like everything else in Tony’s life, he’s happy to take what he can get. And if it’s Steve Rogers offering to fuck the need for alcohol—however briefly—out of his head, then Tony is hardly going to complain. But he will hurt, tomorrow, and the next day, and every day after this point, because Steve is going to give him a perfect memory and then leave him to face the future alone.
This was the moment when Tony, so tender and impressionable even at that “advanced” age, learned what his father really thought of him.
It’s quiet for a second, but that’s to be expected, since Tony soundproofed every Avengers suite. But Steve doesn’t even have time to get antsy before Tony’s throwing the door open, a wave of rock-and-roll noise coming out to meet him. Amid rasped lyrics and snare drums, Steve hears Tony tell FRIDAY to turn the music down with a smile, throwing in a pet name for effect that doesn’t make Steve irrationally jealous at all, of course not.
Steve frowns. “Something tells me it’s not,” he says, leaning down to brush a kiss against Tony’s burning cheek, “but we’ll table that discussion for later.”
Between them, the steam rising off the rigatone alla vodka swirls, disturbed by the sudden breeze, then continues curling lightly upwards like nothing out of the ordinary has happened. Like Steve’s entire life wasn’t just irrevocably changed, upended, by a single kiss.
,” he says.
Tony stoops to pick up and pocket what looks like a dissected nine-volt battery. Steve kind of wants to ask, but he’s too distracted by Tony’s ass in those black Levis to ask any cogent questions.

When Natasha plants both hands on either side of his face and makes him look her in the eye, Steve realizes with cold-blooded dread that she’s not kidding.

The Time stone flashes a vivid green from the safety of its cradle of dense foam inside the carbon steel suitcase, which Steve holds out to the Ancient One like one would a box with an engagement ring inside.
Walking in deep shadow, Tony slowly works his way toward the front of the ballroom where a lectern has been brought out with a single microphone attached, jutting out insistently into space. The silk pennant on the front bears the name of the foundation Tony is about to plug, but the words seem to blur the closer he gets. From the dark outskirts of the busy ballroom, he watches the crowd move with and against itself—toward the food, toward the bar, toward and away from each other—and wonders, not for the first time, why he bothers coming to these events at all. No one has spoken more than a few sentences to him all night; he might as well be a particularly expensive window dressing.
, that makes you think I don’t still want you? That I don’t always want you?”

There’s a name for the feeling that fills him at the thought of not being engaged, fake or otherwise, to Tony Stark after today.

team, with as big a smile as he can muster even as he shoves his trembling hands into the back pockets of his jeans and pivots on a heel, fully intending on beelining it straight to the elevator and down to the workshop.

“It’s nothing.”

“Steve.”

it takes time. good things always do.
“We’ll see about that, Shellhead,” Steve says, flexing his thighs hard and fast so Tony almost bounces up off of them and pressing two dripping wet fingers into Tony’s empty hole as he comes back down.
The footage unspools, harmless—albeit embarrassing—at first: it’s a home movie from when Tony was young, no more than eight or nine. He’s wearing what looks like the remains of what was once a nice suit, something his parents forced him into, probably, but devolved into undershirt and slacks and suspenders hanging down past his knees. He really was a gangly kid, wasn’t he?
“Have you and Tony seriously been seeing each other all this time?”
Biting his bottom lip, Steve runs a hand down the front of Tony’s tie, obviously enjoying being able to touch him like this, to see his gift displayed above the arc reactor like a visible claim. Already Tony is imagining all the ways he can get Steve to look like that in public as often as humanly (or superhumanly) possible. He will wear every dorky tie Steve buys him, if that’s what it takes; he will sport hickies and tattoo the shield on his forehead. He’ll put on a charm bracelet, carry photos in his wallet, put a ring on it—anything,
because
Tony flushes as he stares at the back of Steve’s head, remembering the feeling of the man’s big, hot hands palming the undersides of Tony’s thighs as he’d kissed him senseless. Tony hasn’t had a lot of time to sleep this past week, let alone jerk off, but that hasn’t stopped him from replaying the events of that night in his head like projector footage behind his eyeballs. He’s only human, after all, and that material is solid gold. They flicker and catch, snapshots of images and feelings, even now: the chesty sound Steve made when Tony stuck his hands under his shirt to grasp at warm skin; the filthy swirl of Steve’s tongue against his; the long, thick press of Steve’s dick against Tony’s when their hips met the first time and the way Steve had kept Tony there, one hand on his hip and one on the back of his neck so Tony could

life depends on it.
Before Tony can retrieve his wrist from Steve’s grasp, the fingers around it squeeze ever so slightly. The energy in the elevator shifts just as subtly, a frisson of
“Well, can you blame me for assuming, Mr. Fate-Brought-Us-Back-Together?”
“Top of the line!” Tony smirks, saluting Steve with his Phillips Head. “Nothing more high tech in any of them than a heart rate monitor and some other odds and ends—no rocket launcher eyes, don’t worry. I kept my baser urges in check with these.”
The rattling has settled somewhat, but Tony still has to rely on Steve to tell him when to breathe and how deeply. He forgets, sometimes, that Steve has experience dealing with panic attacks, which so often came before an asthma attack. Steve once told him that even years removed from his sickly days, he still remembers what it’s like to lose that grip on reality, feeling the heart too acutely as it beats against too-brittle ribs.
) in both hands and tries to collect himself. “Wait, just…wait,” he breathes, thumping the man’s sternum gently for emphasis. When he finally looks up, Steve’s face is inches from his, lips wet and parted and waiting, but that’s not what gives Tony pause.

“absolutely lovely, but this all coming a bit out of left field. Care to share with the class what it is you’re scheming?”

“Hah?” Tony breathes, still wincing slightly from stepping on the magnet. “Oh yeah. For Bucky, when you find him. Ow, mother

chuckle. He also missed that gentle brush of fingers against his forehead, right under his hairline, the way Steve knew exactly how to gentle Tony with his touch and voice and presence.
The reporter is breathless as she gives the play-by-play of everything that happens next on screen: Tony’s helmet coming off in Steve’s hands, Steve sobbing openly over his unresponsive body, Steve leaning down and kissing him like it’s the last thing he’ll ever do, right before Sam and Thor come up behind him and pull him away so the paramedics can get to work.
comes one week after their small hours rendezvous, when Tony finds himself back in the communal kitchen drinking fresh coffee, staring a burning hole in the back of Steve’s head.

“Uh,” he says, smartly, “I don’t know what you mean, Cap.”
“Didn’t know y’all would be around, else we would’ve stayed outta sight.”
“I think all is clear,” Vision says smoothly, drifting forward with Wanda, who is visibly fascinated by the woman’s tattoo until she steps into the throng and sees something that makes her face fall.
“Clint, have you seen my watch?”
It’s so, so much. Tony is almost afraid of it, how much he
“Over here, To—agh!”
“Careful, Steve,” she coos, “keep talking like that and people will start to suspect something’s going on between you two.”
. “Next time you feel like going into a tailspin over whether or not I feel the same way, I want you to remember this,” Steve says, moving his fingers to massage the sensitive skin of Tony’s perineum through his jeans until Tony’s eyes are rolling up into his head where stars live.
Captain, sir, wow, it’s—fuck,
Steve darts forward to nip and lick at Tony’s lips and groans before switching the rhythm of his hips to a slow, hard, purposeful grind that makes Tony’s whole body flush hot and his skin go tight. Someone is moaning like they’re dying, and Tony’s pretty sure it’s him. He grasps frantically at cloth and skin, takes and takes and
It’s a short distance for his hands to travel, up from Steve’s heaving chest to his neck. For all that Tony was the one crying a minute ago (and he might very well be on the verge of tears again—jury’s out), Steve looks like he’s not far off, himself, bright eyes noticeably wet.
He’s had years of practice keeping his feelings for Steve from the man. He can handle an elbow and a wink. That shit’s practically child’s play.
If there’s beeping, Tony thinks, he must be in Hell. That’s the only possible explanation for it. It doesn’t cross his mind that he’s in a hospital until he hears a sound like a relieved gasp somewhere out there where the world isn’t pain and nausea and everything spinning in the wrong direction.
Before he can stop himself, Tony presses against Steve,
Tony’s almost through the door when Steve wraps a hand around his trailing wrist.
It spills over him like sunlight, that feeling—not just Steve’s body, but the way Steve’s breath trembles against Tony’s lips every time he pulls back for air. The way his strength never wavers, holding Tony up against the door. The way he looks at Tony, taking in the sight of him like a starving man at a buffet; the way he settles the more Tony touches him, making little gasping noises when Tony runs his fingers through his hair and whining when he scratches him gently behind the ears. Tony takes it all in, already breathless at the thought of what other sounds he can pull from Steve.
”), which became a blush whenever Tony directed one of those goofy, face-stretching smiles at him, the ones that make his crows feet accordion. Then Tony invited Steve into the workshop the first time he worked on Bucky’s arm, and the compassionate, gentle tack he took with his childhood best friend was like a bit of sun come to earth, a warm, blue glow that melted the hard edges of him in Steve’s eyes until he was just Tony, a mechanic, a man, wearing goggles and an old t-shirt stained and threadbare past all hope of saving, doing his best to
Steve smiles, so hard it hurts, and pulls Tony in by his tie. “Shut up and kiss me, Tony.”
Steve chuckles, nuzzling Tony’s nose with his. This close, Tony can count the freckles on Steve’s cheeks. There are twenty-seven. “I did.”
“I see what you did there.” They’re helpless, both of them: as Steve oscillates wildly between seducer and nervous wreck, Tony looks like he can’t quite decide if he wants to put on the Stark Charm™ to soothe his own nerves or if he wants to stay like this, in this quiet, vulnerable place with Steve and follow it, wherever it may lead. “Were you jealous of the others?”
it, gorgeous like Steve said, because if Steve said it, it must be true. Never let it be said he can’t come around to seeing things from Steve’s perspective.
you're baffled. genuinely, it doesn't make sense. you've loved each other for
Behind him, Steve hums thoughtfully. “Hi, Rhodey,” he says, knowing Tony will pass it on, because of course Steve would, and of course Tony will. Tony scoops ground coffee from a bag, not caring which one he’s dipping into, and fills the bottom of the French press as the electric kettle comes to a hissing boil.
Promise they'll meet in the next chapter, but if I don't just post what I've got it'll be another month.
“When I took charge of Stark Industries, I gained access to a letter from my father. He spoke of his work with AI weaponry, and I have a new insight on them.” He took his sunglasses off, emulating a heart-to-heart conversation with his body language. “My father was many things, but emotional wasn’t one of them. Despite this, he ended his own life because he couldn’t handle the guilt, describing the creation of his bombs as carrying his own coffin to the tomb.”
Tony paused for effect, and there were a few gasps from reporters. “Because of this, effective immediately, I am shutting down the weapons manufacturing sector of Stark Industries, in search of a project that will both protect the Empire and my own future conscience.”
Steve is always coming to him.
However, now, in the cold light of day, he was the forgotten toy on the shelf- with a brand new perspective on his relationship with Steve. He allowed himself to wonder whether, maybe, he could take a chance on a relationship with the other man.
Headed up by the calculating Sharon Carter, Gamma Team always gets the job done but there’s rarely any room for chatter, making it fairly boring to work with them. Gamma consists of a large quantity of junior agents who need time in the field. What they lack in experience, they generally make up for in sheer numbers.
“Rhodey, I have an idea, an incredible one I think, and I need you to listen to me.” He took a deep breath, before launching into a long explanation. “Our world is so full of machines and non-human technology that we’re overflowing with it, and yet they’ll never be as effective as humans
"Nobody asked you, Huntress. And-"
It was if someone had ripped open a faucet, everything that wouldn't type poured out onto the page. The poem was a mess, a formless chunk of angry, brutal, beautiful sentences that expressed everything he wanted it to.
Steve huffed out a laugh, before deciding to retreat back inside after noticing he wasn't welcome.
There were two issues with this plan.
“It can,” Tony tugged him down to his height, so he could whisper into his ear, “Hill’s dead. Pierce told me personally.”
“However,” Pierce continued, “this is far more than assumption.” He strode into the room, taking a seat at the head of the table that most of the room had stood up from to yell at Tony. At the arrival of the Director, the room settled and took their seats at the table. Rhodey was extremely proud to sit at the other end, opposite Pierce, and Tony sat on his right hand side. The rest of the agents all seated themselves, bolt-upright and battle-ready.
Bucky burst out laughing. "Something tells me we're gonna fit in here just fine, Stevie. We can all be disasters together."
Tony grins and hangs his head in some strange combination of shame and amusement, as if to say
“Sure, give me a couple minutes. Plug it into the dash at the side there, and J will run the programs.” Tony saw the progress bar pop up, and he flicked the box over to the side for Barton to keep an eye on.
"Killing me with poetry." Steve mutters, but he spoke too close to the microphone and Tony smiles a small, hopeful smile.
Next to the red frame was a small silver one, embellished with rubies. He saw himself, eyes shimmering with adoration, throwing his head back with laughter at something Pepper had said. And there she was, carefree and… well, he thought that sparkle in her eyes had looked like love. She was smiling at him in a way he only ever saw on their best days. Smiling like he was an idiot, but
"Bullshit." He paused. "J, have this cleaned up."
Tony freezes for a moment, before grinning. “Son of a bitch, you’re Cheese.”
The other issue with this ill-conceived idea to snag himself a super-soldier was that Steve wasn't currently in the tower. Or in America. He had left for Brussels a month ago to negotiate with some EU leaders, which left Tony in a strange, indecisive limbo.
“You always come to me. You know when to come and find me, God knows how. Why?”
He moved to deepen the kiss, chasing more of the high that is kissing those lips, but as soon as he tried Steve pulled back, causing Tony to make an undignified whine that he would vehemently deny ever making later.
"Well probably, but there ain't much to be done. Unless you got a single, better idea? 'Cause I'm all for keeping this assignment."
Watching it fall was almost poetic. The cut crystal of the glass glinted wildly, reflecting every light in the city back into the eyes of the broken-hearted man that watched. He heard her walk away just as it hit the sidewalk, breaking into a million billion pieces.
He flinches. Feels the onslaught, rushing over him like the-
Steve grins, and takes the two steps necessary to close the gap between them. “No.”
"Come to mock me, Rogers?" Tony snapped, convinced that the soft tone of voice was to make fun of him.
Coulson was apparently displeased with the comment and he- oh Christ.
Steve hesitated, and said "As much as I hate the boss, he probably knows what he's doing. Pains me to say, but we gotta just trust him."
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve tried not to blush like a tomato at the concept, and Bucky stifled a laugh, smirking at how his best friend turned bright red despite his obvious efforts not to.
Tonight, he does something different- he goes out to watch the sunset. It's 7:43 pm, and the autumn breeze chills his skin as the cool air of night seeps in. He'd never taken the time to watch the sun sink below the cityscape before, preferring to take solace in the comfort of the night. And, he thinks to himself, he wouldn't be out here tonight without the gentle prompt from his gentle friend.
“In easing the conscience of a thousand soldiers, I have carried my own coffin to the tomb.”
This still isn’t a great idea, he knows. He only just lost Pepper and probably isn’t ready to jump headlong into something else that’ll break his heart. “God, this is going to hurt,” Tony starts to ramble, talking to the skyline, “but what doesn’t? When don’t I jump into ruthless, idiotic situations despite knowing it’s gonna kill me one day? C’mon stars, tell me one thing, is it worth it? Is it romance? I have all these questions that nobody’s ever gonna answer, and-”
It had been a long time since Tony had smoked like this. Sure, he enjoyed a cigarette now and then, but he kicked the habit in his early twenties.
Obadiah was the caring father figure that Tony desperately needed, until his jealousy got the better of him and he went from supportive to unplugging the life support. Tony cursed the man who invented greed.
Steve, the paper informed him, had a placement as art teacher at the school. He smiled a little at this; he'd been looking to indulge his old hobby recently.
During the day, he manages to find something to keep him busy. He works on the armour, making the tiniest detailed tweaks and the craziest overhauls. He allows Bruce to introduce him to strange teas, carefully sipping out of bone china cups and categorising flavours. He even does the paperwork Pepper sends him, despite the fact that seeing her email address still makes him shudder unhappily. Add in a couple of stray thoughts about a certain Captain, and his mind is well-occupied.
his mind supplied hopefully.
“I love you, sweetheart,” Steve complied easily, bending down to pepper Tony’s stomach with kisses. Tony felt like hiding his flaming face in his hands but if this was just a dream then it didn't matter right? So instead, he dug his hands in Steve’s hair again, forcing him to stay where he was, and trying to lead him to what he really wanted Steve’s mouth to kiss. As if reading his thoughts, Tony felt Steve’s hot breath brush up against the hot skin of his erection. Tony let out a whimper and stilled, waiting for Steve’s next move.
“Hair? More like a bird’s nest who had lost its owner long ago,” Sam jabbed at Bucky who was about to snark back until he spotted Steve.
Tony made his way to exit the room when a sudden curious thought popped into his mind. Why leave when most of the answers are going to be in this room? So after checking that Steve was too busy to notice him snooping, Tony set to work on exploring the content in the room.
“Hey Ma,” Steve spoke up finally up as he sat on the edge of his bed, “why do I feel so sad?”
“-eve!”
After a long track back they made it to the town. It was small and busy bustling with life. It was like most towns they passed in Nework, people moving around trying to get by and makes ends meet every day. If Steve were any other man, this would probably have been his life. But he had been given a chance to help make a difference instead. Even if a part of him wished he could live a simple life he never regretted his decision in his life.
“Give me the satchel,” Steve asked stepping into Clint’s space. The archer looked like he was going to fight Steve but reluctantly gives over the satchel back to Steve.
"I know," Tony sighed, "I just worry because the only one with any sensible instinct is Pepper. Happy is hot-headed so it often clouds his judgments and Rhodey well he acts like he has good preservation skills but most of the trouble I got into as a kid was because of his ideas."
Suddenly Steve felt a hard thomp on his forehead that pushed his head back and snapped him out of his thoughts, “you’re thinking too hard punk.” Bucky stood in front of Steve with a large smile on his face.
Rolling his eyes, Steve got up stood in front of the mirror and scowled at the sight he saw. He was too small, too bony, too sickly. No one would ever want him. He was tempted to punch the darn thing but he already broke too many mirrors. Steve does not want his mother to waste more money on a new one.
The prince was about to respond when someone called for him and Tony took advantage of the prince’s distraction to leave. Tony waited until he was over the bridge before looking back for a moment to memorize the prince’s face one last time. This was probably the last time he will ever meet him again. Shaking his head, Tony left to go find papa Rhodes who was waiting for Tony at the back gate.
The pit in the bottom of his stomach churned more causing Steve to feel nauseous and horrified. He could not let that happen. A harpy losing his wings is one of the worst things that could happen to them. Wings are a part of their identity, who they are and to lose that has a major impact on their well being.
It was that moment that Steve realized that he was in love with Tony. He had been this whole time, from the moment he had met him. Steve was hooked. And it broke him to even think about leaving Tony behind and continue as an Avenger without him.
“You're looking distracted punk,” Bucky, Steve’s best friend, spoke up after the first few minutes of silence.
Tony was already halfway dressed and even as Pepper gave him nervous glances he was not going to stop now. “This is crazy,” Pepper commented moving away from the windowsill, “you are going to get yourself on the boat with him! Why did I agree to this!”
Taking a deep breath, Tony followed Pepper out the door.
Steve gave the signal and the Avengers attacked. Thor and Steve rushed in quick enough that the harpies didn't have time to react properly and they were taken down but the rest caught on quick and it was a full-on chaos. The civilian harpies rushed out of the way some leaving the throne room while others just watched from the corners. The fight was chaotic and messy but the Avengers had the upper hand. Stane tried to run but Clint fired an arrow which shot through Stane’s leg and into the stage.
Steve smiled to himself and went to fetch the item Tony requested from the blacksmiths in town. Harperia was a city of fliers so it was often hard to navigate for those without wings but luckily for all the Avengers, they were great climbers. So it might have taken Steve a little longer to get to the blacksmith market than it would have taken Tony but he got the job done efficiently as he could.
“The 107th, why? Do you know someone in this unit?” Peggy asked but Steve was not listening. All he could think about was the fact that Bucky was not there. That his best friend was somehow gone. Does this mean he’s.-he’s dead? No. No. No.
“Hey, Rogers!” Shit! Darcy was walking towards his cubicle, in a swift movement Steve clicked the send button and exed out of the tab as fast as he could. Guess that was it. His decision made. Though knowing his luck he would probably not win. It took him five tries to get into the Erskine project, so for all, he knew he could bet that Steven Grant Rogers will still be dateless as he is now on Valentine’s Day.
“Okay,” Tony heard himself reply and felt his tense body begin to relax into the other man’s hold. If this was his only chance to be with Steve he would try to make the most of it.
“You can let go of me now,” Tony said as Steve looked at him with a growing blush on his face. He seems to be doing that a lot lately, blushing. It was odd for him since Steve was not easily embarrassed since joining the Avengers and meeting Clint for more than a few days.
“Haha very funny,” Steve rolled his eyes, “no it’s just...my company’s throwing this raffle for a mystery date for Valentine’s Day and I guess a part of me is more interested in it than I thought.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well we...could have always gone out,” Steve interjected pausing only to take a breath.
Tony Stark can officially tell you, as the most intelligent six years old, that he hated grown up parties. He found them quite boring. Everyone just hovered around him and his parents flaunting themselves. They acted like ignorant peacocks showing off their tails. Though Tony would love it if they were peacocks they were easier on the eyes.
“We will hide out in my place,” Steve whispered to Tony once they were free of the distracted crowd, “we all live in the same apartment complex. For tonight you can sleep on my bed and I will take the sofa and tomorrow we will find you a more comfortable arrangement. Sound good?”
Stane was going to not make it out alive and Steve was going to make sure of it.
He was glad to do what little he could to repay the only family that ever treated him with love and kindness.
“Yeah,” Steve smiled bashfully, “they call me Captain America. I just...I wanted to help in the war and if I had listened to Colonel Phillips I would have been stuck on the sidelines. At least this clown costume helped me do something rather than sit around fiddling my thumbs.”
“We are in,” Steve spoke up standing up abruptly. Tony stood too, looking into Steve’s eyes trying to figure him out. Even after all this time, Tony did not believe that Steve and the Avengers not only cared for Tony but want to help and assist him in anything he needed.
Steve watched from a distance as Tony wore the vest and tied the small cloth belt over his waist and continued to move around and test out the material on his skin. It was red like the last few remaining feathers Steve could see on Tony’s cut up wings with a gold trim that matched his eyes. Steve wanted to tell Tony that he thought it looked good on him and that he was glad to have met him but he thought it was best to just leave him be. So Steve turned and began to walk away expecting to never see Tony again...except Tony started to follow him.
“Not causing too much disturbance are we?” Steve asked with a soft smile as he joined the two on the ground. Turns out Sam was working on redwing using some guides that Tony had drawn up for him and Bucky had decided to keep him company.
After their short tour and discussion, or more like a one-sided conversation, Steve spotted the rest of his team stumbling into camp. Bruce and Thor were carrying new firewood for tonight’s dinner, Clint who had left soon after meeting Tony was holding their latest game, Nat was checking her knives, and Sam was holding up a map studying it to make sure of markings and navigation points on there were correct for their trip. They were all back and now so Steve was able to finally introduce Tony to all the members of the ream properly.
Tony woke up slowly, taking his time opening his eyes in an attempt to shield himself from the bright light of the sun demanding he wakes up. But, as he opened his eyes and his mind began to focus, Tony realized that the place he woken up in was not the same place he had fallen asleep in. First, he was abundantly warm, almost too much so. Second, there were birds chirping close by as if he was stationed next to a tree. from what he remembered, he quite literally had been surrounded by nothing but concrete and salt water. Third, as he opened his eyes and adjusted to the light, Tony found himself in a bedroom, pressed against a large firm chest, and kept there by two very strong arms he knew did not belong to Pepper.
“Thank you,” a voice croaked at him and although it was harsh from disuse Steve found it soft and gentle. He turned around so quickly to stare at Tony who looked at him ready to cry, “Thank you. You...this means a lot.”
a female voice shouted in his mind. She sounded desperate. And angry. Her words filled Steve with the urge to fight. He felt like he needed to throw a punch. Guess it was time to head to the fighting grounds. There must be some other recruits still up for a one-on-one fight.
“Well,” Tony started, “it was nice talkin’ to you—”
“The girl pissed me off,” Steve grumbled.

Steve felt a body press up against him and he froze. Slowly, Steve looked down dreading to find another woman latching onto his arm but instead he found Tony there holding onto Steve as tightly as he could. The harpy did not look pleased at being trapped and surrounded by all these people and looked ready to attack anyone that came close to touching him. So Steve quickly maneuvered them away from the crowd apologizing and thanking anyone that caught him as he moved away. Steve held onto Tony as he took a sharp turn into an alleyway that was not only deserted but also one of the few ways Steve used to get home.
It has been three weeks since Tony joined the Avengers and Steve has yet to crack the code to get Tony to talk to him. Tony seemed to get more comfortable with his team but seemed to take it upon himself to do every chore, every task, every order that Steve gave without complaint. It bugged Steve that Tony was acting less like a free person but as a caged and collared service animal. Still, Steve thought it was probably Tony trying to repay Steve for saving him though Steve could openly say he hated it. Hated how cold Tony was, how distant. No matter how hard Steve tried nothing seemed to crack Tony’s walls.
“I know but at least try to talk your way out of it. You were always good at that,” Pepper pulled fully away before turning and leaving Tony on his own.
Why would you...I can't. Just fuck you.”
“I assure you sire we have not met,” Tony huffed as his hands wandered to play with the cloth of his omega wrobes.
“Who put a lemon in your drink?” Clint asked Steve pulling him away from Tony and Bruce. Steve did not bother to really reply but sent Clint a glare. The man raised his hands in defeat letting Steve go back to his inner broodings but he found that he really was not in the mood to watch. Tony was free to befriend whoever he wanted but Steve really, really wanted it to be him. It was not like he was not trying to get the harpy to like him and open up to him but no matter what he did it seemed to have the complete opposite effect. And now seeing Bruce easily touching Tony without the Harpy freezing up bugged him more than it should. Steve should be glad he was getting along with his teammates!
Steve blushed hating to indicate that Tony was a prize to be bought, “twenty three dolls.”
“You look kind of like him but I am guessin’ you look more like yer ma,” Rogers suddenly spoke as Tony rushed to leave stopping Tony in his tracks.
“H-hey! That was not fair! You broke the rules!” Tony called after him and Steve just laughed heartily at Tony’s antics as the harpy came running up to him and lightly punching Steve’s arm in retaliation.
Steve looked at the man’s face and for the first time in his lift he could see him and man was he beautiful. Steve let out one last remaining of his breath in a small happy sob because he was not fully alone. He had Anton at least to keep him company.
As if taking pity on him, Sam nudged his shoulder and asked him questions about his week long quest for ingredients to see if he had any fun tales to tell. The Avengers often switched stories when they went on solo missions so that they were all in the loop with everyone’s actions and experience no matter how small. Steve was glad for the slight distraction as he began to tell them how he stole the horse and fought off a few bandits who tried to rob him without knowing who he was.
There was a knock on the door. Steve looked up to find his mother standing there holding a cup of warmed milk. She smiled at him as she stepped into the room, shoving the cup into his hands. “Thanks,” he grumbled. She smiled placing her hand on his cheek.

Everything was going to be fine. Well mostly fine. Now that Tony was back home with his family he will have no reason to continue traveling with the Avengers. Their role in Tony’s story was about to come to a close and it broke a bit of Steve to think it. They were going to move on and Steve won’t have Tony’s smile, Tony’s stories, and ideas or Tony’s playful sparring to look forward to. He couldn’t stand the idea of being separated from Tony. The harpy had become a big part of his day and he always loved it the time he spent with him.
Jarvis had tried on multiple occasions to report Howard’s abuse of his only son but every time was refuted. It seemed like either no one was willing to believe that the great Howard Stark would hit his child or they were paid real good to look the other way. The butler always suspected it was the latter. He tried on multiple occasions to convince the young Stark to allow him to take him away but the kid had refused to leave his mother behind. Maria Stark was quite oblivious to the situation and neither of the participating parties was willing to inform her of these events. Watching this small child suffer at the hands of his own father crushed him.
The answer to
“Where is Tony Stark?”
“I told you,” Steve says. “The Avengers are a thing of the past.”
“Tony,” Steve sighs. It’s a prayer, a mantra - one that clears the last remnants of that darkness from his face. Tony lets himself be held and petted, wondering again at the person his other self was, to have arrested Steve’s heart - and sanity - so absolutely.
No. That star should not be white, but red.
“Bullshit,” he says, a vein straining in his brow. “You wouldn’t have come all the way back here if that was all you had to tell us. Stark, that bastard - he can’t have - “
He’ll need to play a softer game, if he means to make it out of here. As much as Tony is itching to rage and roar and
“It doesn’t matter what you meant,” Steve tells her, and he can’t keep the edge from his voice. “Tony will see this, and he’ll go away from us again. This time, forever.”
“The Avengers are a thing of the past,” he says smoothly. Straightening in his chair, he goes on, “You and I have to look to the future, Tony.”
Steve breathes, and the world corrects itself. He is standing in the soft gray dark of the second floor, and he’s not sure how he got there, but that doesn’t matter. The double doors to their bedroom stand in front of him. Behind them lies the world.
The strong urge for a drink overtakes him then; as he climbs into bed, Tony considers giving in to the demon and asking Steve when he returns. But no, no. He scrubs a hand over his eyes. That little girl will be with Steve, and she’ll look at Tony with those eyes and...he can’t. He can’t.
The words die in his throat when Steve gets in his face, snapping, “Enough.”
“What.” The word is scraped out of him, a breath of sound.
She shakes her head, that furrow deepening. “I feel it,” she whispers. Her hands are tight fists in her lap, the faintest glow surrounding them.
Steve smiles.
Steve stares at the floor, steels himself. The dread sits thick within him, thick and cold.
He walks to the very edge of the strip, his hands folding behind his back.
that, but it’s hard to remember the shit he’s in when this near-perfect copy of the man he maybe-loves is here, hot and real and devouring him like he’s the only thing that’s real, that matters.
he thinks, but dares not voice. This Steve, as loathe as Tony is to admit it, has sufficiently cowed him for the time being. He nods once, mute and stone-faced. Steve pulls back to assess him, lush mouth pursing slightly at the wall of nothingness he finds.
“No,” Sarah whines, clutching at him. “I didn’t mean to.”
Steve relaxes infinitesimally.
“I’ll be back sometime tonight,” Steve tells him, pale eyes sweeping the room. “The TV works, and your favorite books and magazines are all on that shelf there.” He gestures at the far wall. “Plenty of things to entertain yourself with while I’m gone.”
Steve is frozen. His gut is

Every eye in the room is pinned to Steve, now; he tries not to shift beneath their attention, but can’t help how his fists curl at his sides. There’s been some mistake, clearly.
Again Steve’s eyes flash. He steps forward, but Tony steps back, continuing, “Because I’m going to kill you, first chance I get.”
It’s not a question so much as a promise, each word soaked with the cold ichor of sincerity.
His Tower contains failsafe upon failsafe upon failsafe, for hundreds of scenarios; should Ross - or anyone else - seek to take advantage of his absence and seize the suits, for example, Tony has programmed each and every one of them - including his lab - to promptly self-destruct.
Steve’s jaw works. His hand falling from Tony’s face, he steps back and says, “About that. It’s time we talked.”
The words spring from his lips without thought: “What happened to you?”
Well. Driving Steve’s own blade into his jugular might make Tony feel a little better.
Steve’s fingers haven’t stopped drumming.
(See the end of the chapter for
in his ear, like a reproachful parent.
He starts by placing a hand on Steve’s chest, suppressing a wince at the blood he feels wetting his palm. It’s all over him, now, but Tony has bigger problems.
Steve considers him for a moment, silent. Then, without looking away, his hand slides up Tony’s wrist, and he
“What are you saying, Director?”
He rubs his neck, remembering the sting of the needle as it sank into his flesh. The suspect was ruthless in his assault; had Clint, hungover and incoherent, not staggered into the nearest room (which happened to be his), the suspect might actually have succeeded in drugging him.
It’s not that simple, though. It never is, with Tony.
he says it --  soft and warm and fervent, like a prayer…
He wonders what other differences will make themselves known in the future. Will they be little, like this? Or vast?
He keeps quiet however as Steve stops before the glass doors barring them from the launch strip he used here as Iron Man. Steve presses his hand to the glass and Tony watches, teeth gritted, as the bioscanner lights green.
Tony doesn’t trust himself to speak, and so does not.
“Oh - it’s fine,” Tony lies, and bites down on his most winning smile. Steve might get suspicious if he smiled. “It’s just - it’s my favorite.”
” he grits into the silence. “Not while innocent people are dead - and who knows what gets away with an attack on the capital. While we hide here,

“Steve’s right.” Wanda’s voice, barely audible, stops Steve’s retort.
One hand snarling in Tony’s hair, Steve says in his ear, “No streaks of luck that end with you escaping me.”
“The world,” Tony says, and has the confusing pleasure of witnessing Steve’s face warm with a grin.
His heart thundering in his ears, he flattens to the ground - a corpse among several,
White pulses across his vision, and Steve has to turn away from them, blood seeping from his shaking fist. At his back, the room is silent, but he can feel every one of their eyes. It is not like him to lose his composure.
The mob turns as one to him, each soldier raising their weapons like a well-oiled machine. He notices, for the first time, the white star emblazoned on their shoulders, and feels sick.
The thing is, Tony can’t blame Steve.
he murmured, as Steve was overcome with fog.
There’s the heavy weight of a hand on his shoulder, and then:
Still Steve lingers. “Make sure your choice is the right one,” Tony hears.
“Who are you?” he asks finally.
sorry for the wait!! I really have no excuse except life. Endgame comes out in april (honestly i'm not ready) and in my hype i found some inspiration, thankfully. Hope y'all enjoyed!!
He has treaded every inch of this bedroom; flipped through every channel allowed to him on the TV; pawed through all the books on the shelves - just as in his world, they are more for show than anything - and brooded for as long as he possibly can without falling into the familiar pits of his own consciousness (self-loathing and regret and despair and all the other jagged things that tear at him when he lies awake in the dark).
The thoughts drum within him, and their shadow tracks his every step; breathes goosebumps along his flesh when Tony tries in vain to sleep.
he snarls, at no one. “The
Well, Tony will remind him. In time.
His voice is even, his face stoic enough that Tony could almost dismiss the near-hysteric man from earlier as a hallucination. The forming bruises on his biceps beg to differ, however, and it’s only their ache - a preview of what looms, should he misstep - that keeps back an acidic reply.
because they have the same flaxen hair and muscled build, the same soft mouth and square jaw. But there is something fundamentally
Whatever conclusions he has come to about his own feelings, Steve clearly does not reciprocate, and Tony knows now that he was a fool to ever hope otherwise.
Well.
Tony still wakes up gasping from the memory, sometimes, of her body disappearing into the flames: gone from him, forever. The world had screeched to a halt around him, blood roaring in his ears and something awful - nameless - howling in his skull, until he thought he’d come apart with it.
Tony’s chest tightens. Maybe he was even good at it.
No amount of alcohol will ever rid the sight from his memory - but Tony can’t be blamed for trying.
“The one who took Tony was you.”

He swallows, his eyes flitting about the gathered cronies. They’re bunching towards their leader now with an air of expectation, a mob of masked faces and
A ringing starts in Steve’s head, his gut

he calls, his repulsor glowing, ready.
The smile that splits Steve’s face is ghastly. His teeth glint in the light, and as Tony looks into his eyes he understands he was mistaken; Steve isn’t angry with him at all.
Steve’s mind races with the information, his heart flipping while his brain works.
Just the thought robs him of breath, of reason. He could do it. He would.
Tony murmured, pressing the gift into Sarah’s hands.
It’s been four hours, and Tony still can’t believe it.
“And the arc reactor?” she demands.
Steve says nothing for a long moment, his eyes boring into Tony. Tony can’t say for certain what it is that lurks in his flinty stare, but it makes the hair rise on his arms. It takes everything in him to look back, his body stiff with an apprehension he can’t hide.
Steve’s voice cuts through the buzzing in his ears, low and soft. Instinct almost makes him relax, but then Tony
Tony focuses every ounce of will he possesses into keeping his face blank. Cold rooting in his chest, he looks back mutely as Steve goes on, “There will be no
He turns in a circle, gloved raised, waiting for one of the bastards to emerge from the smoke. He can hear them, boots slapping the marble, but he can’t pinpoint an exact position.
The bourbon sears down his throat as he drinks and drinks, until blessed numbness settles in. Until Tony can remember that day -  when Steve walked away from him for the final time - without pain. Without the raw, hot swell of
Steve lets that sink in. When several seconds have passed without Tony saying a word, he releases him. Tony folds his arms to his chest immediately and walks back to the window where Steve first found him, seating himself exactly as he was before he was disturbed.
“Oh, sure,” Tony replies. “What’s on your mind, Cap?”
Tony steps back. “What do you mean?”
(And then? Steve still can’t say.)
“Go ahead and eat your vegetables, darling,” Tony murmurs, dropping his eyes. The endearment is oddly smooth on his tongue. “They’re good for you.”
Steve is insane. Steve will kill him.
No, he reminds himself, his hands flexing at his sides. Not remnant. Tony is here.
There are a hundred things Tony could say to that; a thousand curses and denials. He keeps quiet however, his whole will focused on not flinching as Steve takes his hand.
blooming on his skin, along the lengths of his arms, his neck, his face. They glow softly beneath Steve’s shocked stare.
“Is there anything you’d like me to bring back?” he asks, eyes on the door.
But more than those, Tony is afraid. It has settled over him, the fear, like an old blanket: an odious shadow that haunts his peripheral vision, it throbs at the back of every thought.
Steve considers her for several seconds, his daughter. She belongs to him and Tony, but is Steve’s spitting image, with her golden hair and deep blue eyes. Sarah has his gifts, too: his speed and power. Steve knows she will be fearsome, someday - an unstoppable force honed to carry on their legacy - and even now, in the wake of this betrayal, he loves her terribly.

The words are bitter in his throat. The last thing he needs right now is Captain America’s evil twin blowing up state buildings and killing civilians while the real Captain is on the run. The media will just
There are people watching, he knows, but they cease to matter as Steve’s hand winds through his hair and Steve’s tongue slides, electric, against his. Warmth curls low in his gut, and a distant part of Tony is horrified at the moan in his throat, at the eagerness with which he presses up, up, up, into Steve.
“You want
A woman in a lab coat has entered the room, Agent Hill trailing behind her. Every eye is focused on them at once; Fury glares expectantly at the woman, who is too busy frowning at her clipboard to feign intimidation.
“The test results were all positive,” she informs them, sweeping past Fury to stand next to Steve. Her name is printed on the breast of her coat:
it reads.
Tearing his eyes away from Tony’s, he ignores the hammering in his chest and croaks, “Alright.”
- ignores him, leaning dangerously close again. Tony tenses and turns away, his teeth gritting, but Steve seizes his jaw, forcing his head straight again as his lips brush Tony’s ear.
He taps lightly at Tony’s temple with his free hand. “You should know that.”
He puts his plate aside. “And if I never adjust?”
he means to ask, but then Tony is looking at him like he’s starlight condensed into human form. His mouth is parted, his eyes shining.
The world is blue and black and Steve says, “You’re going to die here, Tony.”
And Tony understands, like a bolt of lightning, that he’s dealing with
He can’t seem to tear his eyes away, and is only dimly aware of Tony’s fingers spreading in invitation.
Tony’s been watching
“Really,” she says.
They’ve been sitting in silence for a short eternity now. Tony is alternating between plotting his next move and morbid curiosity. The latter eventually wins out.
Later, after it’s all gone to shit, Tony will wonder if it wasn’t his own self-pity that summoned the catastrophe. It wouldn’t be the first time.
Tony downs another glass.
-- he offers, “Well. I think everyone deserves a chance at redemption, Tony.”
Steve lets out a tremulous breath that Tony steals for his own lungs. He knows in this moment that he could ask Steve for the sun, and Steve would seize it without question from the sky.
“Maybe.” Fury’s disbelief is palpable. He swings back to the window, his coat flaring dramatically behind him. Silence reigns while he considers the suspect.
“Who?” he demands, and his own voice sounds strange to his ears, low and dark and
Steve blinks. He is struck with the distinct sense that he is toeing at the precipice of a long, long drop. He thinks carefully about his answer, before nodding, “I do.”
And a shudder tears through Tony’s body, because that sounds like
Steve’s gaze is hawkish. “Why?”
Tony thinks.
“I’m sorry.” Sarah’s voice is tiny, tremulous. It is nothing to the thunder clapping in Steve’s skull, a preclude to the storm. “I’m sorry, Papa.”
Because Tony knows what it does to you, the cold blade of grief. It first came for him when he was twenty-one, and Obadiah Stane told him his parents were dead. Then again in the mouth of that cave, when the light went from Ho Yinsen’s eyes. Both will follow him the rest of his days; but they don’t compare to what he felt as Pepper fell into the fire.
“Steve,” he says, softly. Tony never called him by his name; it was always “Cap,” or “Capsicle,” or some other catty sobriquet that left Steve flustered. And the
“Tony.”
Tony can’t say what would have become of him if she hadn’t come back. But he knows it would’ve been ugly. Uglier than anything this Steve could come up with.
Sarah starts to cry as Steve tears the picture from the sketchbook and lowers himself onto the edge of the bed. It’s an ugly sight from her, all violent shudders and gasping breaths.
“The future,” Tony echoes. He can't help the wry twist of his mouth. “That's a funny thing to hear from you.”
“Let me meet her properly, then,” Tony murmurs, and he works up the courage to grasp Steve’s wrist. As Steve’s face warms with delight, he adds, “I can’t...I can’t be who she wants, right now, but. I’d like to meet her.”
Steve’s own shoulders stiffen. “I -- that’s  -- “

Tony recognizes the weapon. How could he not?
Steve’s heart feels ready to burst from his ribs. He and Natasha exchange a look.
He wants badly to jerk his head away, to wipe away the blood this distorted version of Steve Rogers is smearing on his skin. Instinct whispers to be still, however, and for once he listens, watching instead as Steve’s face transforms, his previous mask of neutrality flooding with a tenderness that has Tony swallowing thickly, his heart thumping violently in his chest.
. “Tell me.”
blue eyes sink back to his.

It’s not hard to act subdued as he sets in on his meal, nausea flipping his stomach when  the first bite of chicken touches his tongue. Aware of Steve’s intent gaze, he tries to chew more enthusiastically than he had the pancakes earlier, and makes a show of going in for the next bite, and the next.
He recalls that same shield falling onto the snow: a marker of the choice Steve made.
Tony stares at the purple stone glowing at its center. It is one of the few instances in his life where his mind has gone silent.
The warmth in the comment nearly drives Tony mad. “As if you know me,” he snarls.
She’s a child, Steve has to remind himself, amidst the winds howling in his ears. She is small and ignorant and silly - so
He’s torn between vindictive glee and the same grim certainty that had seized him hours ago, when Steve first left him.

has quickly spun beyond his control; he’s not sure what’s happening, only that they are on an entirely separate track from where they started. It’s like they’re operating on two completely different wavelengths.
Steve is not Steve. Steve knows that Tony is not
Natasha straightens, but before she can say anything, Fury pins her with a sharp-eyed glance.
Well. He means to find out one way or another, starting with the girl. Sarah.
Shaking the last of the static from his thoughts, Tony gets to his feet, his mind racing furiously. He was barred from bringing the full suit with him; the glove’s all he’s got.
So Tony stamps down the fury bubbling beneath his fear, locks it away with his yet-simmering defiance. It’s become clear that he’s in more danger than he realized.
It isn’t until not-Steve’s expression spasms that Tony realizes how the other man was staring at him a moment ago, like a lost puppy sighting its master. The look contrasts sharply with the blood splattering his uniform, dripping from his hands - one of which grips an eerily good imitation of the shield.
of his secrets, his failsafes, his codes.
Tony Stark has fought both gods and men - and strange hybrids of the two - unflinching. But none of his many enemies, save perhaps the Ten Rings - who drowned and beat and hammered him into the man he is - have ever quite inspired the gnawing terror that thrums within him now, beneath Steve’s gaze. Slowly - no sudden moves - he shakes his head.
But Tony isn’t there, yet. Tony is afraid.
“What?” he presses, leaning forward. Something is going on here. The desire to understand what is a striking thing.  “What were you going to say?”
What happened so differently here, he wonders. Could it be that the Tony Stark of this  world never crossed Aldrich Killian and his ilk? What else is different? The questions gnaw.
He gives the paper a vicious little shake. “Why did you disobey me, Sarah?”
“We,” he echoes, after a moment. “Was this the Avengers?”
Tony blinks at him. There’s little enough space as it is between them, now - any closer, and he’ll step right into Steve’s chest. Steve sees his hesitation; his fingers tightening around Tony’s chin, he leans down and says, gentle as a lover, “Don’t make me repeat myself.”
And Tony asks, “Do you believe in second chances?”
“Believe me, I want nothing more than to go after whoever did this,” Sam goes on. His face has not stirred from its grim cast since he first came barging into Steve’s room. “But our situation hasn’t changed. The moment we land on American soil - hell, the moment we leave Wakanda - it’s a rap.”
But Sarah is here and Sarah is real, a warm presence nestled into his side with the kind of trusting adulation only children are ever really capable of - and Tony is
Tony’s voice is in his ears. Tony’s breath is on his skin. The ghostly imprint of his hands sear Steve’s flesh.
“Sir.” One of the goons is standing at attention a few feet away.
Sarah finishes eating before either of them, and startles Tony when she immediately crawls over towards him, burrowing into his side like she belongs there. Maybe she does.

and he wants so badly to raise his hand - to blow that beloved face to smithereens.
“Tell me,” he says.
“Tony,” he murmurs, shifting towards him, and Tony is suddenly, searingly certain that Steve means to throw him into the sea. He braces for it, his jaw locked, his eyes wide - but all Steve does is break their hands and wind his arm around Tony’s shoulders, like they’re friends.
“Yes,” Thor says suddenly. He has been unusually subdued since the battle. “Let us be glad for now that our friend has returned to us.”
He’ll never know.
“Stop fighting me,” Steve says, that edge returning to his voice, but Tony doesn’t hear, too lost in his burgeoning panic, in the terror that little stone and its implications inspires.
standing bold  --
The sudden swell of nausea Tony feels is not the chicken’s fault, this time, and its with herculean effort that he manages to keep it down.
The Norse god has just caved in the steel door with Mjolnir when they are stopped in their tracks by a blinding light, like the implosion of a star.

- in a way that still rattles him, hours later. The suspect had acted with lethal intent towards everyone but
His fingers curl with the desire, cold and ugly in his soul, as Steve murmurs, “Can’t have you doing something you’ll regret.”
He is tired, and angry. Oh, how he burns.
And he can feel his daze lifting in another tide of molten anger, as the smoke billows and his palm grows tacky with the blood staining the white star on Steve’s chest - as the room swells with the thunderous silence of death.
Steve thinks about that, his eyes falling to the picture in his hand.
And Steve can only obey. He meets Tony’s stare, his jaw fluttering, and feels his throat bob as Tony leans into the space between them, his eyes earthen pools.
Steve stares at the picture she’s drawn, and stares. Slowly he becomes aware of a pressure in his jaw, the bone clenched tight enough to crack.
The forest was dark and unwelcoming. Steve could feel eyes on him as he took his first step into the forest. He knew they were bound for a fight so he took out his shield and waved at Bucky and Thor to take out their weapons. Thor carried around a hammer that let out strong electrical charges through magic ruins getting activated when it gathers enough energy from being thrown around, while Bucky depended on a crossbow that was self-loading. The crossbow was an old design by Dum Dum but Steve was sure Tony would have some form of improvements to the crossbow to make it more efficient once he got his hands on it of course.
“We decided to try and locate you once we realized you had a high chance of being alive still. If there was a sliver of a hope we followed it,” Pepper chimed in coming onto her knees in front of Tony and placed a hand lovingly on Tony's knee.
“Night J,” Tony whispered back before falling into slumber.
Hope you like this chapter! Let me know what you think! :D
I hope you enjoy it! Next up is Steve's perspective ;)
“How would you know?” Tony growled, “you haven’t even seen my mom.”
“What the hell Buck? Why did you threaten him with me! You know how hard I'm trying to get him to like me!” Steve growled looking at his friend as anger boiled deep inside him. He did not appreciate being used as a threatening tool against the harpy. Steve would never hurt any of his teammates or traveling companions deliberately.
Tony looked at him with worried eyes before pointing to his legs. Ah, people would know he was a harpy and often times harpies are treated worse than pets in human establishments. This sucked and it really should not be the case. People need to learn to treat other creatures with respect that they deserve. Humans are ugly creatures.
The truck hit a hard bump and heard a delayed warning from the driver after they had passed it followed by laughter. Steve glared at the back of the truck before answering, “Hey! Can you not drive like a moron? I could have gotten seriously hurt.”
There it was again. That vague reference to a hidden person he feels like he knows but cannot grasp to remember.
After getting an ice pack from medical, Steve headed to barracks to find his bed had been ransacked again. They seem to make it a habit of toying with his stuff in an attempt to get him to leave. Many people think having him here was a waste of time but what they did not know was that Steve was stubborn. Probably more stubborn than them so if they want to get him to leave they better start upping their game because at this rate they will get nowhere.
It did not stop him from leaving with a black eye and a nose bleed though. The fight lasted longer than usual since Steve had been figuring out different fighting techniques that fit his body and allowed him to out maneuver his opponents much easier. This by no means says he has won any of the fights just survived longer without too much injury.
“It's not like that,” Steve felt his face heat up and he knew Nat could see his blush, “I, he, fuck this, I don't have to explain anything to you Natasha.”
“That is not very nice,” Tony grumbled but smiled back at Steve’s contagious smile.
“Like you had a choice,” Steve could hear Sam’s voice on the other end say, “like they’d enjoy themselves knowing you were sulking at home alone.”
“Tell the rest of the team to come out and I will introduce you guys to the people I consider my family,” Tony said and a small pang of hurt coursed through Steve at those words. He wanted to be a part of that family but for Tony to use those words...these harpies must be very precious to Tony.
Once Steve ran out of coin to buy items with, Steve lead Tony towards the west exit where he had first entered from. It was easier to retrace his steps that way and find his way back to the team without having to do more recalculations in his mind. They walked in silence with Steve trailing ahead of Tony just by a little trying to make sure they were moving in the right direction. It did not take long for Steve to deem this a good place to release Tony from those shackles. The skin underneath looked like it was chaffed and inflamed. Seeing that made Steve’s blood boil. He really hated those men so much.
Steve Rogers didn't have time to reminisce; he had to focus on the mission.
"You've gotta let your heart catch up with that genius head of yours, or
"Jerk." Steve cut in, "Actually, he squealed like a child on Christmas day and applied immediately."
After the ceremony that he (barely) survived, he was pulled aside by Secretary Pierce. This was fairly surprising for Tony; the two men have a history of getting into pissing contests over the pettiest of things.
"Steve?"
Bucky scoffed, and Steve nudged him half-heartedly.
Team Beta is run by the possibly late Maria Hill, Tony’s second-favourite team leader. Beta squad has two field operatives, brothers. Their codenames are Thor and Loki; they refuse to go by anything else. There’s also an astrophysicist computer whiz named Darcy, who is an excellent science bro.
Both men stared blankly at their boss for a few moments.
Bucky quirked an eyebrow at this, trademark smirk on his face. "James Barnes. But ain't nobody calling me that, just call me Bucky."
Firstly, he was still so confused about his feelings towards Pepper Potts. Was it romantic love? Was he just a desperate old fool?
"I read your poem, Tony."
"Either this is a typo, or you're revealing our identities to a school for special snowflakes." Bucky snarled, conveniently forgetting Steve's warning.
Fortunately for Steve, Bucky had remembered, and swooped in to (verbally) save the day.
“J, I love you. Do that.”
"Sir, Captain Rogers is requesting entry to the penthouse."
"What the actual fuck?!" He exclaimed, giving Hammer a dirty yet still shocked look. "This is me! My actual, legitimate name. What shit are you on, buddy?"
Once again, the lift interrupts the conversation, and both men swiftly enter it. Pressing the button for the ground floor, Steve takes in a slow breath. He's preparing himself to get into character.
to hurt.” He pulls Tony into a warm hug. “I want you. But I also want to be more than a lovelorn rebound.”
Steve’s eyes are glacial, his face an Arctic landscape, devoid of warmth or light or anything approaching humanity. If Tony were another man, he would flinch away - would scuttle back, panicked, as Steve reaches for his hand, crushing it in his own. Instead he remains stone-still, his heart pounding.
There is...a strange, charged tension swelling in the short distance between them. He wishes, with sudden ferocity, that he had not agreed to do this. That those eyes would
“And how do you propose we do that?”

Steve doesn’t move, or even blink. He says nothing for so long, in fact, that Tony begins to feel insulted. Finally: “It's complicated,” Steve says, folding his arms. He looks like he wants to leave it at that, but Tony isn't in the mood for mystery. He bares his teeth in something that could be a smile, to all but those who know him.
Adding to his chances is the fact Steve underestimates him. If he can lower the Commander’s defenses...play along with this Stepford nightmare, if just for a little while…
Tony looks. He sees sky and sea and their endless convergence; sees seagulls squawking on the distant cliffs and the silhouettes of far-off cities. He sees -
“Uncuff me,” Tony says abruptly. He looks back up at Steve with a familiar set to his shoulders, the way he used to when he was particularly intent on getting his way.
He’s had time to stew on the whole ordeal, and while the rage has simmered, the bitterness within him is no less potent. If anything, it has begun to gnaw at him, shortening his temper and his tolerance for the rot that so permeates his world.
