“Yeah, after you came back from Loki’s trick... I had all these memories of my grandpa teaching me about mechanics. All these memories of him telling me about this girl who taught him all he knew about machines.” Reed said, turning his attention away from the wires and meeting the shorter brunette's eyes. “He told me, I’d meet you one day. He knew of it. I always thought he was crazy. But then you showed up at the Baxter Building the next day after the memories appeared and I knew he wasn't crazy. I just thought, because you never got to say goodbye...” Reed shook his head and turned his attention back to the machine. “It was dumb, I ruined your wedding day instead.”
“That, she is. Enjoy your night.”

Toni turned her attention to her super-soldier, her eyebrows raised in shock as she listened to the words that left her fiancé’s lips.
“Oooh,” Toni whispered, as she looked around at her teammates. “Being a god would be Hella cool, but then again being a super-soldier would be fantastic too.” Toni bit her lip, deep in thought. “
“Ohh,” Happy muttered, as he shot Steve a knowing glare through the rearview mirror. Steve just turned his gaze to Toni, ignoring the older man's look.
“Edwin Jarvis?” Steve sniffled as he looked at the envelope in his shaking hands. A questioning look in his blue gaze.
And later on, Toni leaned over his shoulder, showing him how to move a file on his computer. Her chest brushing his shoulder as one of her hands rested over top his, showing him where to drag his mouse and drop the file.
Toni noticed Steve’s cocky smirk as he watched her check him out. The bigger man just squared his shoulders and raised his chin slightly, presenting himself for his fiancée.
Steve smiled and closed the distance between them, sealing his lips with the smaller women’s. Moaning as her fingers dropped from his neck to his shoulders, gripping his shoulder blades pulling the bigger man impossibly closer. Their lips moving against the others like the steps to a perfect tango. With perfect execution, familiarity, and passion. It was like an art craft that had been perfected.
“Joseph! How could you even ask that! You know Steven is a good man.”
“Not possible.” Steve’s hands danced up and down the lace that covered her back, settling perfectly, finding their claim right atop her backside. Smiling as those brown eyes he loved so much rolled fondly at his actions.
She knew Fury and Reed were gonna be pissed but fuck them. These were her in-laws, they deserved to know about their son.
“Oh, they’re just teasing you.” Toni giggled, as she felt her future husband pick her up, throwing her over his shoulder.
speak like that about him.”
“Fuck you, Howard.” Toni spoke as a dark chuckle left her lips. “You’re a good for nothing, piece of shit. The only good thing you ever did for me was make it possible for Steve to still be alive today.”
“What? He can’t bless me with the armor on!”
But he guessed it wasn’t a secret, as the whole world knew how much he loved Toni Stark.
His conversation with the guys, completely forgotten.
“Happy wedding week.” He muttered, capturing her lips in a kiss.
Steve nodded his head, biting the inside of his cheek. Howard hadn’t once even mentioned his daughter. Steve knew any parent worth their salt after being thrown into the future, their first question would have been about their own child.
“Now son,” Joseph said with a chuckle as he pulled a handkerchief from his pocket and wiped the lipstick off his son's face. “I know you’re not ruining your wedding by messing up your doll's makeup, now, are you?”
Toni raised her eyebrows at the harshness of this butler's tone and words as Daniel just rolled his eyes. Invoking a laugh from Toni’s lips.
“Have fun!” Fury waved as the elevator doors closed.
“I think if you put an apron on, Stevie here would lose all his ability to function,” Bucky muttered.
cute! He’s terrifying, even small!” They heard Clint in the background.
“No can do,” Natasha said, crossing her feet as they rested upon the table.
“Yes, thank you, ma’am,” Bucky said, knocking his best friend upside the head. “Look at her when you talk, you jerk,” he whispered.
“I’ll have you know mister, this is the most clothing I’ve ever worn before to seduce a man. But, this happens to be my favorite reaction.”
“Toni..” Bucky said softly. “I’d do it all over again, doll... I’m gonna miss you, so much. Be good, don’t beat up too many fellas, come back and see us.” He pulled the smaller brunette into his embrace. “I love ya, ya crazy psycho.”
Steve dropped Toni to her feet, placed a quick kiss of apology on her lips, and chased the short blond right out the hallway. Threats of murder and other unpleasant things leaving his lips.
“You aren’t going anywhere near him,” Steve whispered into her hair, as his grip tightened on her hips. “I promise.”
“Hey,” Steve muttered. “I didn’t think we were supposed to have candles in the building?”
“No sex, just. Just let me..” His eyes conflicted with an emotion Toni had never seen in the crystal blue before. She just nodded, letting him pull her shirt over her head, only to be replaced with his own.
met my dad. Stop laughing!” Toni placed a smack to his chest, hollering:
“Thank you,” Toni whispered, as Bucky placed his arm around her waist and whispered something into her ear.
“You fly and are also an expert marksman.”
“One more point and it’s tied up, losers,” Clint stated confidently with a wink.
“A Norse goddess.” Toni whispered, staring at Thor and Loki in surprise. “Freyr is goddess of sex, love, beauty, war and fertility.”
“No, I wanna know what he’s hidin-
“I think it’s genius, really.” He whispered, his tongue running across his bottom lip as he moved closer to Toni, resting his hands in their rightful place on her hips. Toni smiled and placed a soft kiss on his glistening lips.
“Good for him. What about me?”
“I don’t... I just... I dunno...”
Toni smiled at even Steve sharing the tiniest bit of information. This was gonna work.
“Take the lift to the twelfth floor, enjoy your evening," Nodding his head to Steve. "Sir, Ma’am.”
.” Bucky spit through gritted teeth.
“You can’t say that, because it’s not true. I’ve almost lost you... three times now.”
“Sam Wilson.”
“YES!” Clint yelled, meeting the grinning Steve for a high five on the way back to his seat.
“Yep, that’s true.” Bucky turned the door handle. Both men awaiting the frigid air of their apartment. Only to be greeted with a wave of warmth, and the smell of pasta hitting their nostrils.
“Touchy, touchy. I didn’t realize Midgardians were so into monogamy. I apologize.” Loki said and began swirling a ball of green smoke between his fingers. “But if you’re ever interested. I’m always available.”
“I promise, baby doll, I promise.”
“The MoMA!” The brunette shouted, pulling Steve to his feet.
When the whistle blew, alerting Toni it was time to board she placed a kiss on the smaller man's cheeks and whispered.
Steve stood up from his sofa and made his way over to Bucky. He lifted the genius into his arms and brought her back to their shared sofa.
The love in this woman's embrace was something she never quite experienced before. This Toni knew, this was what a hug from your mom felt like.
“Yep, those.” Pepper said, unhooking the last button on the dress just in time for the Iron Man armor to walk into Toni and Steve’s bedroom.
No calls for a fight, no meetings for SHIELD, just a regular old week, and every single Avenger was bored out of their
Toni scratched her head, blinking her eyes, fighting every urge she had to run and jump Steve Rogers right in the middle of the SHIELD hallway.
“Stoni? I can’t tell if someone just liked my name more than Steve’s or if that was honestly their only option.”
“Are you guys five years old or twenty-five years old?” Steve asked, standing to his feet, turning to face the grinning Clint Barton.
“Toni, this is a long walk. A real long walk... Are you sure you wanna go?” Steve asked, finally giving up the fight against the stubborn brunette.
“Come on, boys, let's get you some food. You’ve gotta be starving.”
Steve just needed to ask Howard questions about his time period, get a date and get out of there. But all his mind could think about was killing that son of a bitch, for what he did to Toni her whole life.
He whispered. Nodding her head softly, Toni felt herself fall into the smaller man's comforting, safe embrace as tears poured down her face.
“Save that for the honeymoon, we don’t need to see that!” Bucky shouted. Joseph smiled at the three of his children and made his way over to his second son, pulling the younger man in for a hug.
But it didn’t matter, because two walked through those doors hand and hand and helped put everything back together.
As if it was a reflex, Steve chucked Toni’s stapler right at the back of the brunet. Glaring at his friend as Bucky walked back to his desk, laughing. Completely un-phased by Steve’s glare or flying stapler.
“Thank you,” he muttered, taking his left hand from his chest. Not moving his hand that was covered with Toni’s, but using his other to bring the glass of water to his lips.
They made their way back into the living room and saw Pepper and Natasha on their phones. telling whoever was on the other end of each of their phone calls that things were changing, and they were gonna make it work. Toni feared for the businesses who dared to cross Natasha Romanov and Pepper Potts.
“Promise?” Steve questioned the brunette with a knowing look on his face.
. Just let me hold you.”
“Listen to me, Rogers and listen good. Without me, you wouldn’t be living this beautiful life here, you’re
The team turned to the god of Thunder, looks of disbelief covering their faces.
He didn’t have time for feelings right now and his wedding day of all days was not the day to deal with his dead, piece of shit - father-in-law.
“Nobody changes. Let's all go to the roof,” Toni told the group.
“No, we did not,” Toni whispered; her lips curled up in a smile as she turned her bright brown eyes to face Steve.
“No matter what you look like, Steve Rogers --” Any air that he had regained in his chest was now gone as he felt Toni’s small, rough hands on his bare skin. Her lips began placing soft kisses on his neck, as she whispered: “I’ll always want
“Steve’s way too possessive to share Toni anyways, he could never be in a triad,” Bucky informed the group. “He couldn’t handle her snuggling up to Clint during movie night. There’s no way he could let someone else fuck his girl.”
“We’re only a block away from home, anyway. She needs ta’ stay warm.”
styles of art. You never talk about what
He stared for a second or two more. Then it was as if he snapped out of a trance. Steve brought his left hand up to cover his eyes as he kicked the door closed behind him.
He saw Toni raise an eyebrow in confusion at her fiancé’s antics over an old, silly sketchbook. “Clint, give him his book back,” Toni hollered, her attention back and focused on Steve’s old white shirt. Her nimble fingers running delicately over her favorite shirt.
“Promise me, you’ll look after my future grandchildren.”
Bucky placed a kiss onto Toni’s cheek, muttered a quick thanks, and went to clean up the mess that was his haircut before heading over to his desk to finish up his work.
Steve pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose with his pointer finger, mumbling: “Ya think?”
“Steve, what is going on?”
Toni chuckled as the older man spoke. She loved working with Daniel when he wasn’t on a shift at the hospital. For most of the time they spent together he was on call. While Elisa was at work, she was a nurse in the ER, Daniel told her. Toni wasn’t sure what Daniel specialized in, but Elisa had said he was the best in the country.
Toni whispered, her brown eyes flickering up to Steve’s, her hands placed firmly against his chest. Steve drew painfully slow, deep breaths. Cursing himself as he breathed in nothing but the smell of Toni’s perfume. The subtle smell of pears, red apple, and mandarin rushing underneath his nose - the smell that always reminded him of Toni.
Toni smiled as the door opened, revealing a sobbing Steve Rogers. Toni took a step back from his parents, expecting him to engulf his parents in a hug. Only for him to run over to Toni.
“Any day, Mister Empire State University.”
It all happened so fast. Toni couldn’t even blink before she was pushed against the door. His lips pressed to hers for only a moment before she shoved the bigger man off. Gathering her breath back as the taller man did the same.
“I don’t mean to…”  Sue whispered. “Interrupt... but we need the date, Steve.”
“That he does, a spitfire of one too,” Nat responded.
“Adult Steve has a soft spot for Toni,” Natasha answered and took another bite of her cheese pizza.
“You and Toni?”
Daniel opened the large white door, revealing the darkest office Toni had ever seen. The contrast of the brightest white house Toni had even been in. Only to enter this room to see the walls painted black, along with an ebony black hardwood floor. The furniture was all a dark green, with some silver accents throughout. Toni wasn’t sure who designed the room, but they were awful at their job.
“How could you, I never said anything."
, are you gonna undress at all during this?” Steve smiled against her neck as he successfully got her pants undone with minimal struggle.
“Yeah, I guess it is,” Toni said softly.
“She’s the most beautiful dame I ever seen, Buck. I dunno how ‘ta speak to a gal like that.”
“How? How…” Bucky asked, sitting down in the chair, smiling as he ran his fingers over the worn leather on the armrests. “How is this even around?” He turned to Toni with a smile on his lips.
“You do know this place falls apart without you, every third Wednesday of the month when you have off. I just wanna know why you like to torture me?”
Coming up empty, his eyes landed back on the gash on Toni’s cheek as she softly nodded her head. Thankful it had been Daniel and Elisa that opened that door, and not Steve.
“Here, Miss Toni. Let me get this lug off yer chest there.” Bucky offered, moving closer to his dazed best friend.
Toni’s grip never wavered as the older man struggled to get loose of her grip.
“You did it," Steve told her, the amount of pride in his voice was almost unreal. "You did it.”
Werner Von Doom? Who names these people?
She flipped her phone around showing her future in-laws a picture of Steve in a pile of puppies that they had rescued. The bigger man was sitting on the ground, donning his Captain America suit with an unbelievably wide smile on his face as the puppies jumped and licked him all over.
“How’d ya get him to stop fightin’ like that? I could use that trick; it would save my ass lotta trouble.”
He also thought about waking up beside his little genius, seeing her crazy bed head as she lay snuggled up to his bare chest. Steve dreamed of going on ice cream runs together at three in the morning. He dreamed of taking Toni to a drive-in movie and holding her close to his chest as they watched a film on the big screen, where he would steal kisses from her lips during intermission.
“Run,” Bucky whispered, watching the anger as it grew on Steve’s face.
“Toni! Hey.” Steve’s head jerked up from his book and gave Toni a soft smile while quickly closing his book, pushing it away from his body. Toni’s eyes followed the green-colored sketchbook as she smiled.
“Shut up, Barnes,” Natasha said, handing Sam a bottle of water.
“Toni? You there? JARVIS, did we lose Toni?”
The Avengers jumped to their feet, turning their attention to the intruder who just appeared in their kitchen. Bucky had a blacked-out knife in one hand, his trusty Stark Industries hand-gun in the other, and Clint guarded behind his body. Sam jumped to his feet on the counter with the knife block, tucked in his left arm - ready to start throwing steak knives at their intruder. Steve had Toni guarded behind his back, hands up, ready to throw down with their mystery guest.
“I did it,” Toni whispered. Steve lifted her off her feet and began swinging her around, joy falling off his lips.
“I’m sorry...
“Time and place, Barnes.”
“At least it’ll be fun,” Toni smirked sliding into the cab, nodding her head to the driver as he tipped his hat in the presence of a lady. Steve slid in behind, closing the door gently.
“Deal,” Steve smiled proudly and placed a kiss on his genius’ cheek.
“Where did my shy Steve go?” Toni asked with a smile on her lips as the bigger man's lips dropped back down to his love bites on her neck.
“You’re a thousand times more beautiful than that sunset, Toni... I love you.” And with that he captured her lips in a kiss, pulling her body tighter to his. Their lips moved in a passionate flurry as Steve’s large ran down Toni’s plump backside like he was claiming her as his. The moment was short, but had a fire burning in her lower abdomen almost instantly - Steve Rogers always had that effect on her.
“Yes, of course.”
“Nope, I am not. Wedding night bra and panties at that.”
“She saved ya from gettin’ in another fight. Ya should thank the lady.”
She pulled herself out of the older man's embrace and quickly stood to her feet, a bout of worry stirring in her gut as she heard the panicked tone of Steve’s voice.
The taller brunet rubbed the back of his neck and shrugged his shoulders, saying: “She’s real pretty...” Steve and Toni laughed as they watched a slight blush rush Bucky’s cheeks.
Just as Toni went to respond to her future mother-in-law, The familiar blaring of The Avengers alarm rang out through the building.
“Oh Elisa, don’t scare the kids. Toni, doll - I’ll see you tomorrow afternoon. We can head down the street and get those sewing machines fixed... Get you some pretty gowns and another supper or two as payment.”
Fifteen dollars in 1938 was about two-hundred and sixty-one dollars back in the future. If Toni's math was right, and it always was.
“Well, this is delightful! I cannot wait to play!” Thor exclaimed. Toni couldn't help the laugh that fell off her lips as she watched Steve roll his eyes at the god.
“Where are we?” Sarah asked, looking around the room. Eyes wide in curiosity.
“Come on, Toni. You’ve got a fella to get home too.” Daniel told her, placing his hand on her back.
“Stevie, how did you get rice on your glasses?” Toni whispered through her smile, her delicate fingers picking a tiny grain of white rice off his black frames. “There, all better.
But, hey. He wasn’t gonna complain.
“Okay, stay here. Don’t move Tones, I’ll get him and we’ll get you home safe, alright?” Toni nodded her head as Bucky placed Steve’s jacket around her shoulders. “Don’t move.” He said softly, his blue eyes flashing her a soft and comforting look before he ran over to his dumb ass of a best friend exchanging punches with a man three times his size.
“I think we should keep this one, I like her.”
Their temp Peter Parker always took Toni’s off days and normally did an okay job. Toni had taken the younger boy under her wing, training him upright.
Daniel snorted at the thinner man's ignorance and said: “Miss Grant is her name.”
Steve’s gaze fell to the genius that was seated to his left; he watched as her brown eyes grew in wonder at the words the god had just spoken.
“You’re my... My right-hand man?" Steve asked Toni.
They’d just gotten back to the tower around eight. After their day at the spa, the two heroes were relaxed and ready to cuddle up with a glass of wine and a sappy movie.
And with that Toni made her way out of the bedroom and onto the balcony just in time to see the quinjet taking off.
“Hey! Enough, let’s just fix this machine.” Toni said, looking between the two men. “I have a wedding to get to.”
“HA! She’s known you for an hour and she even knows you and Steve need to tone down the loving looks!” Clint shouted from across the room.
“The white roses, they mean--.”
“Forever right?”
Then it hit him, his head was laying on her chest, and his arms wrapped tightly around her lower back. Steve pulled back with a yelp and stumbled into Bucky.
“Eig-eight babies?”
Before she could even react, the super soldier's arms wrapped around her waist, pulling her down onto his chest.
“May thirteenth, 1999,” Maria whispered. Clint immediately pulled his phone out and shot a text to Richards.
“He’s in a SHIELD interrogation room, with your mother.” Steve whispered, his hands softly gripping Toni’s forearms.
“You must be James’ girl. Well, it’s nice to meet ya. My wife - Elisa had mentioned him carrying a lady home in his arms last night.” And with that Toni let the older man through the threshold and into the quaint apartment.
“There’s my dancing girl.” Steve smiled, pulling his fianceé onto his lap.
“Yeah, well. Steve over there started a fan war.” Bucky muttered, a laugh falling off his lips.
Steve got ready to break the two apart when he saw Bucky’s hand reach up to rest on Toni’s cheek. He froze in confusion as Bucky’s free hand moved to the brunette’s waist and pulled the shorter woman in for a heated kiss.
Steve chuckled as he and Clint held up flashlights to help Toni cut his hair. Steve didn’t know how Toni knew how to cut hair so well, or where the fuck she found clippers. But she was Toni Stark, she never failed to amaze him.
“No, come on. I hate inside jokes,” Clint begged the taller man, grabbing onto the bottom of his shirt. “Bucky tell me!”
There wasn’t a dry eye between the three of them as they arrived at the platform, setting her bags down, chatting mindlessly avoiding the obvious. Toni smiled regrettably at the train and turned to face Steve and Bucky.
“Sounds wonderful,” Steve said softly, leading the taller woman over to her seat, pulling the rickety chair out for her to sit down.
Toni couldn’t even begin to put into words what this painting meant to her. The fact that it was some of her most treasured things all in one: Steve, their flower, him holding her, her red lips, the memory of them in the MoMA and so much more. Steve had given her the most perfect gift.
“Good,” Toni patted his bare chest. “Don't you forget it either.”
“Ew, like in bed?”
“My question is for Sam,” The young girl asked. A smile widened on her bright pink lips as her attention was solely focused on the Falcon.
“Loki!” Thor shouted. “No tricks!”
She always had fun flirting with the blond, because she knew it got Steve riled up and riled up Steve was always good fun in the bedroom. It was also hilarious for Steve and Johnny to be in the same room together. Johnny was the spitting image of Steve. Just way more douchebaggy.
“Interesting,” Toni muttered, for some reason, the name Doom and Latveria sounded eerily familiar to her.
“All right, it’s time to grow up, fellas."
“What can I get ya for, little lady?” The man asked, a thick jersey accent falling from his lips.
“Well, anyways.” Loki turned his attention to Toni and Steve. “I wish you two the best. You have been blessed by many deities, but I would like to bestow my own on you two. If you allow that?” Steve and Toni turned to Thor, seeing the look of surprise on his face.
“Well...” Toni whispered, looking down at her engagement ring. “We are getting married today, but we had a little work emergency and then you two showed up.”
“Let’s get you home,” Bucky whispered, as Toni buried her face into his neck.
“Can I take it off?”
Steve’s gaze was set on Toni’s lips as he watched her slowly bite her bottom lip, he didn’t even hear Bucky asking him.
“Men.” Toni grinned, running her fingers through his blond locks.
Toni was not at all prepared for what she saw when the elevator doors opened.
“I don’t want you there either.”  Toni muttered looking up into those baby blue eyes she called home.
He had friends, Bucky being his best friend - who was also a salesman. There was Sam who headed up shipping a couple of floors down, Clint who goofed off in the office more than he sold office supplies. There was Natasha who, well, Steve wasn’t really sure of her title and in his five years here, he was too terrified of her to ask. Coulson was a sales rep from another department and Steve was never sure why his desk was on their floor, but he didn’t care enough to ask.
“Two super soldiers...” Toni whispered. “That would be a lot to handle.”
“Oh,” Steve muttered.
“If Steven continues to age like you, I have a really good future ahead of me.” The smile that broke out on both of their faces was something Toni never wanted to forget.
Toni saw full-grown Bucky and Clint cuddling on the sofa as Sam was cuddled up on his own couch, with a bowl of cereal in his hands as he watched an episode of ‘Full House’.
“You’re alright, although I could have gone my whole life without havin’ to see ya mauling Toni like that.”
“Hey, what’s takin’ so long, I wanna go danc-
Is she alright!?” Steve shouted as he dropped to his knees beside the unconscious woman.
“Here,” Toni reached into the white envelope gathering five of the one-dollar bills.
Bucky had talked Steve out of buying a ticket to California, countless times. One time he even had to lock the smaller man in his room to keep him from leaving the apartment.
“Sweetheart?” She heard the panicked voice of her loving fiancé as he ran over to her side, his hand resting on her shoulder as the other one held his pancake battered covered spatula.
“One of the most legendary duos in the history of... Well, the world.” Natasha confirmed for the smaller man.
“No. Now come on, let’s go look at art.”
He also wondered if Toni was somehow related to Howard Stark - because his genius was something Steve had only seen in Toni, but he wasn’t near as smart. Steve asked him one night as he sat in Howard's lab and wrote his umpteenth letter to Toni if the man had any family with her name and he just shook his head ‘no’. He did mention how he liked the name Tony, but he swore he’d never have a daughter, just a strapping boy, like Steve - he said. And that ruffled Steve’s feathers, but then again so did a lot of other things Howard did.
Toni watched as Joseph held his wife’s waist tight to his. The way he was whispering reassurances in her ear, told Toni maybe Steve was more like his dad than she thought. Joseph's actions towards Sarah mimicked the way Steve had just comforted Toni not thirty minutes ago.
without me and you’re gonna remember that for the rest of your life. I made you, Stark. Don’t you ever forget it.” Howard’s hand rose, moving to smack Toni across the face like he did most everyday of her life.
As Toni looked around, she smiled as she saw Nastaha and Edwin standing at the foot of her bed, slight smiles on their faces.
“What’s that, doll?”
“Not long after the battle of New York,” Loki informed them. “So, may I? Give you two a gift?”
Whichever was
Steve’s steps came to a halt, and he turned them around to face the scientist, Reed Richards.
So, this one is a little sad. Prepare yourself. It's not very long as I will be updating again tomorrow. So, fasten your seatbelt folks, it's about to get angsty on this ride.
“Thank you, sir.”
“James Barnes, a pleasure to meet ya, doll," Bucky said with a smirk.
“Oh yes, yep! That’s me, tripped on the dance floor last night, and he carried me home. He’s such a gentleman.” The older man smiled, believing the lie that just left Toni’s lips.
“Go to work, Buck.” Steve pushed the bigger man out the door, closing it behind them taking the two men out of sight.
“I can’t believe it, Tones.” Bucky smiled looking back at his favorite chair.
“Oh dear, look at you,” Elisa whispered, walking across the room, setting her medical bag down on the floor in front of Toni.
“You speak
,” Steve shook his head, fighting back the smile on his lips.
Clint stole Toni right from Steve’s arms, using the smaller woman as a human shield, protecting him from Bucky.
Steve and Bucky’s expressions change from concern to heartbreak. Their eyebrows furrowed, as sad frowns appeared on their lips. A sadness that only the other two men could understand, showing in their blue eyes.
to let me help
“Thank you, both of you,” Toni whispered, crossing her arms over her chest as she felt the chill of the living room run down her spine.
“Nice to see you too, Barton.”
“I love you, Pa.”
“I suppose I would like that. Thank you, Lady Stark.”
“I talk to you about art all the
“Just you Stevie, just you.”
Steve just ran his fingers through his hair, adjusted his glasses, jumped up from his chair, and made his way over to Toni’s desk. The bigger man sat down in her black, leather chair and answered her phone.
Toni placed her hands on the center of his chest, a concerned look in her eyes as she asked:
“Ya know, Toni you’ll have to start visiting us at the Baxter Building more often.” Reed muttered as he closed up a panel on the machine.
to lead her to the table.
“Umm, no. I’m not quite finished with it... But, I can show you some of my other ones..” He smiled at Toni and asked. “If you’d like?”
“Oh, feeling cocky are we, Grant?” Bucky asked, with a shit-eating grin on his face.
“You have the letters?”
“Anyways,” Stephen cleared his throat. “You have two days left here. Which, a day here is about twelve hours at home, and that’s enough time to gather a couple of other sorcerers and bring you home. But, here is a train ticket for Friday afternoon. Board the train and we will grab you from there.” Toni took the ticket from the taller man's hands and slowly nodded her head.
Toni had a couple herself back home in the tower, having grown up with Maria Stark and Edwin, music was very big in her house when Howard wasn’t around. Maria would play Toni a Beethoven record and then begin to teach her how to play it on the piano. Where Edwin stuck to Frank Sinatra or Dean Martin. Who Toni grew to love immensely and learned to play it for Jarvis on the piano as well. Now, Ana’s taste surprised Toni most of all, she was a very classy woman, always dressed to the nines, never a hair out of place.
“That’s disgusting.” Clint informed them, as he played on his phone.
“You would?!” Clint squeaked.
“AI-J,” Bucky whispered, ignoring Steve’s confusing glance in his direction.
Bucky laughed, as his blue eyes glanced down at Toni’s head that rested peacefully on Steve’s broad shoulder. “That don’t mean shit, Clint has shown me Tumblr and Twitter fan pages. People ship ThunderIron, WinterIron, Stony, Winterhawk, IronFalcon, and WinterWidow; it’s wild the things these people come up with.”
“Um, if you two could switch powers with any of the other Avengers. Who would it be and why?”
Ekkkk, I'm very excited about this chapter!! Hope y'all enjoy!!
“I’m ready,” he told her, standing to his feet, reaching his arm out for Toni to grab. His eyes danced up and down her form once more and as his voice dropped an octave, he whispered: “Forget lingerie, you’re wearing that tonight, and nothing else.”
Toni brought her hands to her face, covering the smile that had grown on her lips as she watched Steve slur his words. She actually felt sad for the bigger man, as she saw the look of heartbreak in his glassy eyes.
“Not the time,” Fury commanded before turning to Toni with a fake smile on his lips.
Steve nodded again and ran down the hallway chucking his clothes as he went.
“And Thor is an All Speak so…” Toni gestured to the god, as he smiled proudly. Steve tried to hide his surprise as he heard Toni say that. That meant Thor heard Steve call Toni his love. Steve just turned away from the god, ignoring the grin on his lips, and focused his attention back on the audience.
After they finished their dinner, Steve threw their trash away, holding onto the large soda for their trip home. They walked hand and hand down the street, moving closer together as the cool night breeze rushed upon them.
“Oh...”
“Steve, calm down!” A frantic Bucky and Clint yelled after the panicking Steve Rogers.
“I don’t think a little lady like you can handle what I’m packing over here, babydoll.”
“You can hold me however you want, Mr. Rogers,” Toni whispered, smiling at the bigger man.
“Toni?" He whispered. “Can I ki--" and with that the elevator doors opened, revealing a man and woman waiting for the lift and the man who was taking the tickets. Steve cleared his throat, wrapping one arm around Toni’s hips, and walked them out of the elevator. Toni flashed the couple a smile and threw them a wink, seeing the older man blush and the snobby older woman look at them in disgust.
“Nope, I said what I said.”
“So...” Clint asked. “How often does this happen?”
“No one can, Stevie. That’s why he’s a living legend.”
Toni froze as she took in the bright white of her spare room. But, instead of the blank white walls, she was expecting to see; she was greeted with forty-some paintings with splashes of every color Steve owned. Hot rod reds, glittering golds, chocolate browns, and brilliant blues filled the room instead.
“You awake?” Bucky asked through the thin wooden door.
“Barnes struck gold with ya, didn’t he? Well, he’s one lucky fella. Hey, I don’t suppose you could do a neighbor a favor and come take a look at ours, could ya? Elisa is so cold-natured, and with the Winter season upon us... I just want my doll to be comfortable..” The older man rubbed the back of his neck and said: “I ain’t got much in the fund's department, but maybe Elisa could whip the three of ya up some supper, as payment?” Toni smiled at the older man and nodded towards the door.
A little insight of how Toni is spending her days in the 30's, a nice surprise character reference and artist Steve!!!
“No.” Toni told him.
“Why," the god threw Toni a flirty smirk. "That’s not the same leg as the last time I saw you.”
“So what? You’re a figment of my imagination?”
“I’ve never been more sure of anything in my life.”
“I love you more.”
It was nice to see that Toni was affected by Steve's physical appearance just like he was with hers.
“You’re my bride,” Steve told her, carrying her through the threshold of their bedroom door. “I get to carry you like this whenever I want now.”
“Does he try for sex every time?” Nat asked with a knowing glint in her blue eyes.
Steve just smiled as he watched Pepper roll her eyes, taking his bride across the roof top to talk to some friends.
“I draw things, how I seem ‘em,” he told her, placing his right hand over her left as they rested on the table.
“It's not a bad thing, Toni. Joseph and I are the same way.” Sarah told her, a soft smile on her lips. “You two just love each other, and I’m glad. That’s all I ever wanted for my boy.”
“Alright, you gotta deal.”
“Hello...”
So, between no caffeine, grumpy, sleepy coworkers, and his father, bugging him every thirty minutes since his day had begun. The day hadn’t started off well at all.
They stood in front of the Monet for another hour, just embracing each other. Taking in the beauty that was Toni’s favorite painting.
“Comfy?” Clint asked, smiling at his boyfriend.
“Yes- Yes ma’am, he did - " Steve muttered. Clint rolled his eyes, sitting up further in his seat, cutting the shorter blond off mid-explanation.
“Thank you... For all of this.”
fell from Toni’s lips, her knees giving way just as Steve’s arms wrapped around her waist, pulling the smaller genius tight to his chest.
“I’m good, right here,” he told her, as Toni felt his smiling eyes on her face.
Toni glanced back at the teenage boys on the sofa and gave them a soft smile.
“Oh?” Maria asked softly, a smile growing on her own as she took in Steve’s facial expression. Steve grinned even wider as he realized Toni got her breathtaking smile from her mother, along with her sculpted cheekbones.
“Well, The Captain has spoken --” Toni said, as she leaned her head down onto Steve’s shoulder. “-- He’s never wrong.”
“Of course, Steven. You two take a seat; this is your home after all. I’m gonna get out of these work clothes, and I’ll be right back.”
“No, either Bucky or Toni. I think they have some sort of pact or something.”
“Oh, Steve.. sweetheart,” Toni whispered, not realizing that Steve was actually upset over Toni, Clint, and Bucky’s jokes. “I didn’t realize it really bothered you, we were just joking around.”
“Yeah, he did.”
“Can we just go home?” She asked softly, crossing her arms tightly around her chest.
Steve just smiled as he looked down at his
“He does, actually,” Toni muttered, her eyes running over Steve’s form.
“Nope, ya love me.”
“You like The Impressionist?” Steve asked softly, almost in shock of Toni knowing anything about art.
“Gross,” Bucky groaned. “I did not need to see this.”
“The mouthy blond?” He asked, throwing his head in the direction of Clint’s sleeping form.
Steve ran his hands down his face, slight anger bubbling in his baby blue eyes.
“Fuck, okay. I’m on my way.” Toni rushed out of her office, hollering to her PA as she dashed towards the Avengers private elevator.
“Go for it,” Toni whispered, smiling at her fiancé.
“Oh, really?” Steve asked, his eyes still focused on her beautiful smile.
“We really are superior to Steve, ain’t we?”
Steve yelled concern building in his gut, now for his fiancée and brother.
“Awe, It’s so nice seeing the two of you together," Elisa said, joining her hands in front of her chest. "What a beautiful couple you make.”
Bucky and Clint had cold looks in their gaze as they talked to Fury. By the way they were standing, it looked like Fury had been preparing them for a battle.
“Yeah, just leave Captain Iceberg at home.”
“These hot towels on my calves are heaven on earth.” Toni agreed.
As the bridesmaids and Clint made their way down the aisle, Toni couldn't help but smile at what was her life.
Just as Toni and Nat jumped in front of the smaller blond, the elevator doors opened. Revealing Steve, Bucky, and Nick Fury dressed to the nines, looking unbelievably handsome in their military dress uniforms. The metals shining brightly on each of their jackets. Steve’s chest donning the most - making Toni’s chest light up in pride.
_________________________
“What is it? It’s..” Steve watched as Toni’s face dropped and she turned her gaze to the floor. Steve took in the beautiful blue light that sat in between her breasts and smiled. “
“I’ve never quite..” He gestured down to her naked body beneath his. “Done this...”
“Clint and Natasha already know, what’s three more.”
“Why are you two going?” Toni asked, eyeing the older men as the door closed.
“I’m with you on that one, doll. It’s been a heck of a day.”
Yes, she had several small storage compartments in her leg; she was Toni Stark after all.
The blond turned his attention back to his best friend and shook his head in disbelief.
“You kissed Toni?” Clint asked, a grin growing from ear to ear as he looked between the two.
“Ravish me then, Captain,” Toni whispered, taking in her lover's lust-blown pupils.
“I am, my name is Toni Stark.”
“Can we do that?” Sarah asked, her blue eyes softening as she closed her hands in front of her chest.
“He did, as a matter of fact,” Toni told Bucky, as she snipped the ends of the stems at a slight angle, and began filling the vase half full of warm water.
“And? Nothing wrong with an afternoon beverage!”
Steve was deadly quiet, the only emotion he expressed was the coldness in his eyes. He was falling into his Captain America/battle mode, preparing to push his emotions down and out of his system.
“I don’t... I don’t know... I just, I looked at you..” His tongue swept across his bottom lip. “An' your brown eyes just..” and before Toni even realized it, his lips were on hers again. Bucky’s strong arms enclosed around her waist, backing her into the bedroom door.
“Oh.” Steve took another sip from his water bottle. “I figured you and I would go catch a movie and get some pizza.” He placed a wet kiss on Toni's lips, wiggled his eyebrows suggestively, and said: “Them come back here and Netflix and Chill.”
He was done with sharing his genius.
God, he missed her and in moments like this, it was even worse. Moments where he wished he was still that ninety-pound boy in his old ratty apartment in Brooklyn, cuddled up beside his girl.
“I’ma lucky fella, that’s for sure.”
Toni rubbed her fingers softly against his pectoral muscles, a similar action he would always do to her hips.
“Yes, ma’am. Anything is perfect,” Steve muttered.
“Umm, so that's nine?” The host spoke, pulling the two heroes from their gaze. Steve ignored the blatant grins on his teammates' faces.
“I didn’t say I enjoyed it, Stark.”
A low growl escaped his chest as he danced his eyes up and down the exposed skin around the arc reactor. Digging his nails into the palms of his hand as he was fighting back every instinct and urge to rip that dress right off her and carry her to their room.
“Alright!! Let’s get this show on the road! We are so fortunate to be in the presence of these real heroes. Let’s not waste their time and go ahead and get started with these questions!” The large crowd of over five hundred people erupted in cheers once again. Steve looked out among the crowd and saw lines had formed; several mic stands were placed at the end of each aisle.
“A pure soul, and everlasting love,” Steve told her, placing a chaste kiss on her cheek. “You’re so unbelievably special ‘ta me, doll.”
“What Stevie said,” Bucky cut in, pulling her from her thoughts. “In good conscience, I can’t let a beautiful dame like yourself back out there with nowhere to go and no money on ya,” Bucky took a seat in the beat-up, brown leather chair that sat five feet away from where Toni was standing beside their sofa.
He didn't answer so she tried again.
“Oh, sweetheart... You don’t wanna see this.”
It was that day all of Steve’s dreams began to turn into a reality. He got to wake up every morning beside his beautiful dame, ask her for ‘help’ with his computer at work, steal the supply closet from Bucky and Clint every now and then, and still torment the others in the office together.
“It’s… weird,” Sam agreed, holding a cup of tea Steve assumed Edwin had made him.
“Overrated, Steven! This drawing of this movie theater down the street is 10,000 times better!”
They heard Bucky shout as he ran into the living room.
“Together.”
The first month passed like this:
______________
“Okay, but as much fun as this is... Bucky, did you say people ship Toni and me as a couple?” Sam asked, bringing the conversation back to the soldier's earlier comment.
“Anything else?”
“Depends on the day,” Bucky muttered, hand in Toni’s as she led the man out of the break room and to her desk.
Loki's eyes slowly raked up and down Toni's body, taking in the new appearance of the genius, and cracked a smile. That
“Then we’re alright. Just don’t go-'round disrespecting any more dames.”
“Oh no!
“Bra and panties?” Clint asked. Toni heard muffled laughs over the comm line and an uncomfortable groan from Steve.
“If I open up.. If I share myself with someone else.. I’m so scared they’ll be ripped right from my grasp. I’m so afraid to be alone again. I hate it,
“One second, close the door.” She mumbled, grabbing one of her ‘travel’ brown bags from the ’30s.
“We need you both at SHIELD. Reed Richards and Sue Storm are there with the machine and he needs your help, and well... We need Steve to talk to Howard.” Nick told her, a soft smile on his lips.
“Wrap it up! There are condoms in my bedside drawer." Bucky sang as he closed the front door.
Clint asked a majority of the questions, Bruce piping in every now and then with a question on how things medically and scientifically were different. It was a nice, heartwarming moment, not only for the team to hear about a part of the trio's life but also for the three supersoldiers to relive the life they just lived.
“On us, you seem like a wonderful young man.” Steve looked in shock at the older man and saw him nod along with his wife.
“I lied,” Toni whispered. “I heard...”
She wasn’t afraid of him, not anymore.
.” A groan fell from Steve’s lips, as Clint’s eyes grew wide taking in one of his drawings of his dame.
“He’s a very important man to me,” a fond smile rose on her lips as she thought about the man she knew as her father. Edwin Jarvis was one of a kind and she didn’t know where she would be without that man. “You’ll meet him one day.”
Toni laced their fingers together, smiling as they walked, hand in hand, step for step as they began their journey home.
“So, Natasha... Who is Miss Toni engaged to?” Bucky asked, making Steve choke on his bite of pizza.
The team didn’t know it, but the next two questions that came would start an outbreak between the fans.
And with that Toni felt the smaller man's arms wrap around her waist, and she laid her head on his bony, thin chest. Feeling nothing but disgust with herself for feeling peace in Steve’s embrace. Knowing that not even six hours ago she had just kissed another man, and that man was her fiancé’s best friend.
,” Bucky whispered, wiping his hand across his lips.
“Wait, wait, so what are the ship names again?” She asked, turning to Clint.
So, this, this was uncharted territory.
Pepper and Sarah had just finished buttoning Toni into her white gown, smiles covering everyone's faces as it was t-minus five minutes till the wedding.
“Your new home,” Steve agreed, not stopping the grin that grew on his lips.
“Weapons down.” They heard Bruce, and the guys popped up from their hiding spots.
“I vote yes!” Thor shouted. “We should head to Quill’s and grab a lager or two!”
“Yeah, apparently there's not enough testosterone in my tower, and they need to have a whole night dedicated to it.”
Bucky pulled the sheet off, his eyes growing wide as his mouth dropped, taking in the sight of the brown leather, pleated chair they had in their Brooklyn apartment in the late ’30s.
Toni had her hands tight around Steve’s bicep, leaning against the bigger man as he pulled her into the elevator and penthouse.
“Daniel?” Toni whispered, turning to face the scientist. Forgetting all about her parents across the building with Steve.
Steve just never had the heart to tell her she actually was the boss, as everyone in the office went to her before even thinking about Fury or Natasha. She knew the most and had a solution for every problem.
“Yeah, I know it is. But I needed to talk to him alone..” He told her, smiling as he watched her continue to re-fold the same pair of pants, to appear busy and not at all interested in what he was saying.
“Wait, Miss Stark! Miss Potts is gonna be so --.”
“Alright, follow me, doll. Don’t worry fellas, I’ll bring her right back.”
“JARVIS get everyone to the roof!” Natasha shouted.
Steve smiled up at his fianceé as she sat on his chest and then took her left hand into his, sliding the ring on her finger.
“Thanks, Nat.” Toni closed the book, placing it under her arm, smiling seductively up at her soldier.
“Don’t you have work to do, Mr. Rogers?” Toni quickly turned his attention away from the wonderfully smelling apple candle. “Instead of bothering me at my desk?”
“I get jealous..” He whispered.  “I get jealous because Bucky always got the girls... He always got the ones I wanted... Shit,” he muttered. “He even kissed you before I did. So, he won there too.” Steve clenched his jaw and continued. “I just... I’m still that insecure ninety-pound kid from Brooklyn, Toni.”
“Stop bullshitting me,” Natasha snorted, with a look of disbelief on her face.
“Well.. -”
“Good boy,” Joseph whispered. He looked Toni up and down and raised an eyebrow. “He take good care of you?”
“Hey," Steve said softly, closing the door behind him.
Apparently, she and her father didn’t get along.
“You’re the one engaged to her, you big blond doofus.” Bucky chuckled, downing what was left of his beer. Toni would guess it had some mead in it, with the way the metal-armed man was swaying on his feet.
“Wanna show me some more of your artwork?” Toni asked as they made their way into the kitchen.
and his jaw followed as he watched his best friend passionately kiss the love of his life.
Steve whispered, pulling Toni to his chest. Wrapping the genius up completely in his embrace, no part of her body was untouched by the bigger man as he was comforting her in a way only her soldier could.
“That is an understatement, son.”
“I don’t think it’s gonna fit ya anymore, pal.” Bucky laughed as he saw Toni holding the shirt up.
“Of course, of course. One of the nicest men I’ve ever known, and his grandson is a prick.” Steve chuckled, pulling his fiancé back to his chest - knowing he wasn’t ready to let her go just yet.
“No, Howard is dead. He has been for a long time now; I was there when they put that son of a bitch in the ground.” Toni felt as if her heart was gonna beat right out of her chest. No one in that room dared to speak as they watched the scene unfold in front of them. Toni ran her fingers through her hair and with a tight pull of her locks she shook her head. “No.”
“No tricks brother. I just came to congratulate my favorite couple on their nuptials. I was a bit upset that I did not get an invitation though.”
“Oh.. Okay, okay..” She whispered, nodding her head. “We can do this if you’re sure. If you’re comfortable.”
“We can’t just leave her, Buck! She’ll freeze ta’ death out here!”
“Oh, so he’s got feelin’ for her. Hmm, so, he’s like his pa. His pa is very protective over his ma, she thinks it’s sweet, likes it lots. But Stevie always thought it was annoying.”
She was sitting on the couch, Clint’s head resting in her lap as he complained about not being able to wear a purple suit at the wedding.
Did Clint and Natasha really climb around in the vents? Yes.
“Should you put clothes on under that?” Pepper asked.
“I’m down.”
“Tones?” The smaller man asked, making Toni’s brown eyes meet his blue with nothing but curiosity behind them. “I want ya to be my girl... If you wanna be tied to a fella like me, that is?”
“I always miss you, doll.” He whispered into the phone, slammed another drawer as his mission
“Right, I’m ridiculous,” Toni muttered. “Steven Grant Rogers, you’ve spent our whole relationship - the past three years digging and clawing into my life. Helping me come to terms with my fucked up past, and all the shit I’ve been through and caused.”
There should be one more chapter after this one!!
His forehead still resting against the smaller women’s, Steve’s blue eyes looked suspiciously around to room, and he asked: “Am I good at...
“Have a guy’s night or something,” Toni suggested. “Anything besides moping around my tower as you’ve done for the past couple of days.” She told them as she finished off her third cup of coffee.
“Go, Toni, have fun,” Bucky said, nodding his head. “We’ll be fine.”
“Thank you.” Toni smiled at the shorter man, then turned to Bucky, saying: “And don’t worry, Barnes. Your stuff is safe with me. Doubt I could get much for it anyway.” Toni sassed, throwing a wink at the much bigger man. Steve’s expression looked a bit taken back as Bucky’s grin only grew.
It took Toni squeezing her hand into his to bring the bigger man out of his surprise. He smiled down into the bright beautiful gaze of his soon to be wife, whispering: “I love you.”
Steve couldn’t help the laugh that left his lips as the brunette struggled with the button that held his pants up.
This is so bitter sweet, I'm sad their wedding story is ending, but I am beyond excited to share this chapter with you guys.  I hope you love it as much as I do!!
“Call me Daniel, doll. I have a feeling you and I are gonna get along great.” The older man lifted his arm out for Toni to grab.
“Could you give me and Bucky a moment alone, doll?”
“Maybe, I’ll take them up on their offer. Bucky’s a real gentleman.”
“Mine.” He confirmed, nodding his head.
“I can’t wait to marry you.” Steve told her, placing a soft smack on his genius’ ass.
An hour passed them by, as Daniel sat on the sofa, keeping Von Doom busy talking about work, life, the military, and so on. Toni had just finished up fixing the record player. She packed her tools back in the bag and lowered the lid down on the dark oak player.
“This is for the whole group... Who are you guys' celebrity crushes?”
“Sam, grab him! He’s gonna pass--.” and that was the last thing he heard before the blinding pain took over and his body fell to the floor.
Toni shouted as her face collided with his lower back.
“Anything you need, doll.” Steve handed her his flashlight and with one hand, reached up easily grabbing the box Toni had asked for, noticing the subtle shake of the shelf. And with it one hand, he smiled down at the brunette, asking.
Till she would be able to call him her husband, for the rest of their lives.
________________________
“Two admissions for the MoMA please,” Toni asked, gripping Steve’s arm a bit tighter as the man looked her up and down. She felt Steve’s body tense under her grip as he noticed the older man's wandering eyes.
“Art.” He told her, opening the door.
came from his phone.
“--Because you two are both giant losers.”
Bucky.
“Fine, to our bed,” Toni said with a smile.
Bruce said it would take four to five hours for them to wake up in their adult forms, so Toni headed down to the lab to finish up some work she had been doing earlier before her teammates were temporarily de-aged.
“He’s being an ass, Stevie, just ignore him.” Natasha rushed over to Bucky’s side, trying to help him hold the bony teenage boy back from beating the pulp out of Clint.
I need you to share some of your feelings.” She whispered. “I learned more about your heart in the two months I spent in the ’30s than I have in our years of friendship.”
“No shit, Sherlock,” she muttered. “What is it you need?”
“We found you passed out in the alley beside the theater... We brought ya back here, to keep ya from freezin’ to death... My name’s Steven Rogers. We don’t mean ya any harm, miss.” The short blond said, an uneasy smile resting on his lips.
Toni turned to face the source of the drunk voice, not expecting to see Steve holding a black nerf gun in one hand and a bottle of Asgardian mead in the other.
“I’m better now.”
Bucky and Steve had just left the theater after another failed double date. But, before they headed home, Steve wanted to make a quick stop off at the bookshop to look for a gift for his ma’s birthday.
“Sorry...” Toni whispered to Steve as they crouched down to the ground together, cleaning up the spilled breakfast.
Toni was a safe space like Steve had never experienced before. The two heroes had gotten off to a rocky start back at The Battle of New York, but they moved past that quickly and had gotten to know who the person was that actually lied beneath their mantles.
She softly turned to face her smaller fiancé, seeing the same beautiful blue eyes that reminded her that she was always safe when he was around. And seeing Steve with a bloody lip and the light purple of what would become a black eye reminded her just how true that feeling was.
“Eat all you want. It’s all yours," Natasha said, pushing the boxes toward the smaller man.
“Thank you,” Toni whispered. Her grin grew even wider as she watched the shock rush across the bigger man's face. “Thank you for trying to bring Daniel back for me, that’s the greatest wedding present.”
“Yes ma’am!” Clint saluted the younger woman and made his way back to his desk. Poking around with the files on his desk, pretending to sort them.
He had Bucky, and he was Steve’s oldest friend. Bucky knew almost everything there was to know about Steve Rogers. But there was something different when it came to his relationship with Toni.
“I do,” Toni cried. “I really do.”
“Baby? Baby,
Steve looked at Toni and raised his left eyebrow in confusion.
“I do, I really do,” the last of the giggles leaving his lips. “30’s me liked it too... You weren’t mine, but you kinda had my name. I promise you, doll,  I love that you picked my middle name. You could have used any other name in the world.” Toni’s face softened as she listened to the older man and sealed their lips in a soft, tender kiss.
You're allowed to be angry with Toni and Bucky, but don't hold it against them. It gets explained, have grace for my confused Bucky baby.
“Show off,” Toni muttered, taking the box from his hands. She sat it outside the door and turned back, pointing the light at one more box. “I can get this one.”
think, what style
“Ya hungry?” Toni asked as she noticed a hot dog stand ahead of them.
“He was being an ass. You deserve to be treated with nothing but respect."
“It’s alright,” Toni whispered, as she laid her head into the captain’s lap as her now bare feet rested in Bucky’s. “I was tired anyway.”
“Toni... You don’t have ta -”
Toni Stark stood about 5’7. (Much,
_____________________________________
...” His mouth went slack as his blue eyes darkened, taking in Toni’s appearance in her new dress.
“Hi," Toni spoke softly, giving the two men a weak wave.
“Forget Steve, I don’t know if my body could physically handle two super-soldiers! That’s so much man... Well...” Toni muttered, her thoughts trailing off.
“Could you grab the pizzas from the elevator and bring them to the table?” Toni whispered to Bucky.
“Good for nothing daughter, turns my own friends against me. Giving all my hard-earned money away, what the fuck else has she done? Handed CEO over to someone else?”
“Don’t you
“Huh?” They asked softly, looking around the room. Toni heard the locks click shut and heard a muffled yell on the other side of the door.
“You said Stark? Huh, didn’t think Howard Stark could produce such good-looking offspring.”
“Now we dance?” Toni asked, shooting a smile in Steve’s direction as she locked arms with Bucky.
“He spit it at me when I told him to shut up. Then I tried to pull it out and well...” Bucky held up his now ruined hair.
“Oh man, well at least ya get a well-deserved, long weekend now.”
And that’s how that sat for the next ten minutes.
“Clint spit his gum in my hair...” Bucky muttered, holding a handful of his brown hair with a bright purple piece of chewing gum spread through it.
“I’m... I mean I’m probably a behind-the-scenes kind of fella.” With that, he joined his shaking hands into his lap and turned his attention back to the floor.
“Clint.”
“Yeah huh.”
“I, I hope, this fella. I hope he makes ya happy-
“Toni is. I want my parents to meet Toni...” His grip on his fiancée tightening, as he informed the shorter man.
“Let me at him! Buck, let me
Her brown eyes fluttered open and she flashed that perfect smile at the younger man. “Yes, Steven, forever.”
“He’s on the phone for ya.” Daniel reminded them, his green eyes looking a bit foggy which had Toni a bit on edge.
“I’ve already seen your penis, Steve.” She smiled at the laugh that bubbled off his lips. “It’s a great penis. My personal favorite, I love it.”
“I love you,” Steve told her. “But, also could we maybe watch FRIENDS? The episodes with Tom Selleck are my favorite.”
“Who’s next?” The host muttered from his stool. A young man made his way up to the microphone, a wide smile on his lips.
“St-Steve Rogers ma’am," he said with a blush rushing to his cheeks as he continued to look at the floor. Bucky elbowed his best friend with a laugh.
“You’re welcome to stay here, as long as ya need,” the short blond told her softly. His smooth, deep voice calming her nerves.
Steve held her tighter as the tears poured finally down his cheeks.
“You made sure she knew that didn’t you? When you beat her every day since she was just three years old! Didn’t you, you fucking piece of shit!”
“Get the information, get out, marry Toni,” Steve whispered back to his brother - like a soldier confirming his mission. No emotion, just fact. “Get the information, get out, marry Toni.”
“Guys night, huh? Sounds fun, where are you guys going?”
Natasha took her feet off the table and leaned forward in her seat, a sigh leaving her lips.
Toni shook her head in disbelief. “This is so fucked up.” She whispered, running her hands down her face. “God damn it, James.”
“Well... You share great chemistry with Sergeant Barnes and Clinton. But personally, I would choose either myself or the great Captain here.”
“Same procedure,” Fury muttered. “Someone goes in and gets the date, then we get to fucking wedding.”
“Oh, come off of it ya little pipsqueak. Lay down and give us yer gal. You can’t fight me.”
She groaned, moving herself to straddle the larger man's hips as he could barely breathe from the laughter that had taken him over.
Toni’s eyes widened, not sure how this conversation was going to go. She knew should choose her next words carefully, knowing how women were supposed to act in this time period and fixing radiators was not something that they did. But, then again when was Toni ever careful?
Steve said, as his gaze locked on those beautiful eyes he loved so much.
“Shut up,” Natasha rolled her green eyes at the trickster god.
“He makes regular men look like garbage.”
Steve made his way across the street, flowers behind his back, smiling as Toni looked at him with curiosity shining in her beautiful brown eyes.
“Steve..." Toni smiled at the lovestruck look on his face. "What was the question?”
“It’s not my fault, you guys asked... And how is it disgusting that I take pride in pleasuring--”
Fury had been on her for two years now to take the desk beside Clint and become a sales rep so she could work her way up the company because everyone knew she could run the place. Hell, she practically did now. But she always told him no, she was having fun where she worked right now. She liked doing something she’d never done, she liked that for the first time in her life she wasn’t the ‘boss’.
“We should probably save my boyfriend from yours.”
Toni worked as the receptionist and basically kept all the employees in check. If anyone ever needed anything they always went to Toni. Toni knew where everything in the office was, from bulk pens to notes cards and staples. Prices of products?  Toni knew. List of clients? Toni knew.
“You don’t have to tell me twice, doll.” Steve gently pulled himself off of Toni and threw her over his shoulder.
“I don’t know... But for some reason, I have a memory of seeing a passed-out Toni Stark in the alley beside the theater in 1938...” And with that Bucky brought his hands up to his temples, closing his eyes. “What is
It was as if Steve was trying to share some personal information to make the brunette feel more comfortable as he extended his large hand out for her to shake. Toni responded with a soft smile, meeting his hand with hers. Her smile grew wider as she felt the same comfort rush through her veins as their hands met. Toni couldn’t help but notice the way Steve’s pupils grew, looking down at their interlocked hands.
I’m so sorry, Miss.” Bucky chuckled, helping the smaller boy to stand up straight.
“What did she do to you, Steve?” Howard asked, cutting Maria off mid-sentence. Steve’s gaze flickered over to Maria before turning back to face Howard, crossing his arms over his chest.
“I love you more than anything in this universe,” Steve whispered. “You know that right?”
“Howard and Maria Stark are at SHIELD...”
“Thank you, babydoll.”
“So, does this mean we can all go home?” Nebula asked, looking over at Coulson who was doing paperwork with his very own flashlight.
__________________________
“You don’t know the half of it.” He drew a deep breath and danced his eyes around Toni’s personal calendar on her desk. Seeing Fury’s meetings, his and hers scheduled lunches, and the third Wednesday of the month just had a little apron drawn in the square. Steve never knew what that meant, and never wanted to ask as Toni wasn’t big on talking about personal things. But she had her moments.
“Nice to meet you both, truly.”
“Two days,” Bucky said softly as he turned to face his heartbroken friend.
“See, Miss Grant I have this Victrola in the corner here.” Werner led Toni over to the corner of the room and she smiled as she took in the beauty that was a 1932 Victor Victrola Record player.
“Yea?” Toni asked.
“Of course!”
“Hello!” Toni stood to her feet with a smile.
“So, doll? Would ya let me show you around the dance floor?”
And as if it was on cue, Clint tossed a paper airplane across the office. Hitting Bucky right in the face.
“Congratulations, Steven, a well-earned victory,” Thor said, smiling at his younger teammate.
“If he’s your son, Daniel. There’s no doubt.” The skinny man turned his attention back to Toni and raised his thick, black eyebrow. “Then who is she?”
“Please tell me you’re joking?” Steve muttered.
Toni grabbed the bigger man by the back of his shirt as he took off after two of his best friends. She pulled him back, spinning him around, and laying her head on the center of his chest.
“It was great, we went into Manhattan. Danny introduced me to some of his friends after we did a couple of jobs around the city.” Toni sat her messenger bag and the containers with their supper down on the flimsy kitchen table, making a note to fix that over the weekend.  “I’m exhausted.”
As the boys continued to eat, tensions were high between Clint and Steve. Having enough testosterone in the room, Natasha continued to throw a glare to the smaller Clint Barton until he huffed, saying: “I’m sorry for what I said earlier to Toni. I didn’t mean to offend you, Steve.”
Steve made his way across the room to sit down beside the brunette. But as he sat down on the bed beside Toni she moved in the opposite direction, scooching away from the smaller man. He couldn’t help the grin that grew on his lips at Toni’s stubborn antics.
“I think it’s funny how we are kicking your butts, that’s all”
“Bucky, that night at the apartment..”
“I guess, I don’t know why though.”A sad sigh left Steve’s lips as he unhooked her prosthetic, laying it gently on the floor beside their bed. “But, it’s not like you’d tell me anyway!” Steve gathered Toni in his arms, and crawled into bed, keeping her pulled tight to his chest.
Steve turned to see Bucky shaking his head in disgust. “Cover your eyes,” the blond told him, with a laugh forming on his lips as he felt Toni’s body shaking with laughter against his. “And watch your language.”
“We do,” Bucky said, nodding his head toward his boyfriend.
“A punk, that’s what you are.”
“Yeah, I love them so much.” Toni placed a kiss onto his cheek, feeling the blush rush to where her lips had just touched. “Thank you, Steven.”
The smaller man's body stopped pulling to get away from Bucky and Natasha's grip and fell into Toni’s embrace.
“Three hot dogs please, just ketchup on one, mustard and onions on the other two.” and with that, she handed over the fifty cents, the man's face growing in shock.
” Bucky muttered, as he threw Toni a wink.
“It’s my tower!” Toni reminded them.
“Oh, come on, Cap!” Sam laughed.
he growled into her neck.
Toni opened the chestnut chest, taking in the small photo album and several sketch pads that rested on the bottom of the box. Her strong fingers itching to feel the different colored-leather bound books. Just as she reached her hand out to touch, she was interrupted by a knock on the front door.
“You’ll like this one. I promise.” He pulled the small bouquet out from behind his back, watching the shock grow on Toni’s face as she took in the flowers in his hands.
“You’re a loser, Stark.”
Toni huffed in annoyance at her wardrobe change, without a reason to tell her why.
..” And with that Toni turned around to face Bucky.
“What is it?” Toni asked, curiosity getting the best of her as she sat up off the black leather sofa. Interested in what made the archer’s face run a ghostly shade of white.
“See, buddy, much better now.”
Just before he could ask the question, he’d been dying to ask for the past three years, the lights flickered out, leaving the office in complete darkness. Well, that was until the emergency floodlights came on illuminating their little break room with an ugly yellow glow.
“Stevie, I’m serious. You know those nothing guys you see walkin’ down the street, with beautiful dames hangin’ off their arm?”
Within seconds of JARVIS alert, Toni shot out of the lab, taking the stairs three at a time, thanking Howard for the first time in her life for this serum that ran through her veins.
When Toni wasn’t at SI, at SHIELD working, or out on a mission - She was in the lab, in their bedroom, or lounging around the living room.
“You’re never leaving my sight, ever again,” Steve whispered, tightening his grip around her waist.
“I guess we’ll trust ya not to steal anything... Not that there’s much here ‘ta take anyways..”
“Toni?” Steve asked, scratching his head at the mixed signals he was receiving.
Who ate the most - Steve or Thor, they weren’t sure?
“Buck! He--” and then noticed Bucky was pointing to Toni. She looked uncomfortable, sad, and small the way she was standing. The way her arms were wrapped around her body, her eyes looking down at her shoes - as if she was comforting herself so she didn’t feel unsafe.
“That’s an honor,” Toni told him, smiling up at the older man.
“You do?” Toni asked as she turned to the archer in surprise.
“That’s my ring,” he whispered, his blue eyes flickering up to Toni’s brown ones. A soft smile growing wide on his lips.
“I..” Toni whispered and reached into her pocket, pulling out a small letter and a business card with an address on it. “Write to me. I might not be able to respond, but, I promise, I’ll read them.”
Just as Toni began buttoning up her shirt there was a knock on the bedroom door.
“Lead the way, Mr. Richards,” Toni told him with a grin on her lips.
Toni and Nat were snuggled up in her bed, watching
Toni ran her hands through her hair, a loud exhale falling from her lips as the events that just took place finally began registering in her brain. Toni took an uneven breath and felt her knees give out beneath her. Not fighting the exhaustion that racked through her body, she prepared herself to hit the cold concrete floor, only to be caught in Steve’s strong arms.
She just shook her head softly and whispered: “Wait." As she got up off the bed and stood to her feet, beginning unbuttoning her white shirt.
“Don’t you already know about it?” She whispered, her eyes not leaving the painting.
.” He pleaded.
Steve Rogers wanted everything that Toni Stark would give him.
“Yeah, I definitely think so...”
“For the last time,” Toni chuckled as her fork stabbed a piece of soy sauce-coated broccoli. “We are not your parents, and don’t you have a boyfriend to be dry humping in a closet somewhere?”
“Toni!” Steve yelled, “You coming doll?”
Steve an Toni arrive at SHIELD. Steve reunites with Howard Stark and Toni with Reed Richards.
“I know,” he whispered. “I remember what you told me in bed, that night we slept together for the first time.”
“Or when you’re dancing, God, doll when you dance..” Steve brought his hand up and cupped it alongside Toni’s jaw. “Especially with me, when you dance with me. Even though you’re ten thousand times better than I’ll ever be. The way you trust me to guide your steps. The way you trust me, Toni.” He shook his head fondly. “The way you trust me with your life, with your future, with your body - that makes my heart do cartwheels.” Toni sealed her partner's lips into a kiss, before laying her head back down on his chest. Her heart was full of joy as Steve had just begun opening his heart to her. The two laid wrapped in the other's embrace for a while longer before Steve spoke again.
“That he is,” Daniel told Werner.
“Wanna take off your clothes now?” She asked, her teeth nibbling at his earlobe. Using all the strength he had in his lythe body, he flipped Toni onto her back, raising a giggle from her lips.
“Didn’t know you had it in you, Edwin.” Bucky laughed, sitting back down at the table.
“We really fucked up, didn’t we?” Toni asked as she took the white cup of tea from his hands.
“I can’t promise that.” Bucky shook his head no, eyes watching Clint maneuvering Toni’s hips, blocking every part of his body from Bucky’s gaze.
“Fine," Toni grumbled and made her way down the hallway, slamming the bedroom door behind her for good measure. Steve smirked as he listened to the door slam, rattling the few pictures on the wall. The sass in that woman was unbelievable and he loved every ounce of it.
The bridge rested across a small river, with white roses growing wildly around them - framing the two as if they were the center of the universe and not just this painting.
“Some stupid sorcerer, they’ve got her at SHIELD. Bruce is working on the reversal potion now. Should only be a couple more hours.” Toni sighed and ran her hand through her short, brown hair.
Steve couldn't fight the blush on his cheeks as Toni flashed him a smirk. Her chocolate gaze running over his biceps, painting over his shoulders in his black button-up and back down his chest to settle on his muscular thighs. Steve just beamed with pride as Toni's heated gaze continued to linger on his form.
building a home.”
getting together and the one to go, well. That was him and Toni.
you’ll let me die first.”
fell softly off Toni’s lips, as her back collided with the hallway wall and Steve’s lips returned to their rightful spot on her neck.
“I’ll deal with you later, Bucky…” Steve turned his attention back to the brunette.
“Goodnight, Toni.”
“Good luck!” Toni yelled as the elevator doors closed.
“Steve - ” Toni pushed the smaller man back on the bed. His back hitting the blue blanket, knocking the air out of his chest. Steve’s eyes grew wide as she crawled on top of him, her bare legs straddling his waist. “ -You are beautiful. You are more than some bulging muscles or broad shoulders... Steve.”
“Then please leave the room, Toni,” Steve ordered and smiled as he saw a fire grow in her eyes as she looked between both men.
“He told us, we all work together as adults, as like some sort of ‘superhero group.’”
“My name’s Toni. Toni... G-Grant..”
It felt very different for Toni, having gotten so used to being in the '30s. She understood a bit now how Steve and Bucky felt about the future. Toni was so glad to be home, but her heart missed the late nights of doing nothing with the guys, just being a normal person for the first time in her life.
“Very, very good
“Aw, come on doll.”
“Oh... Well. Should I apologize to the young Captain? I did not mean to offend him.”
Steve walked over to the chest and gently ran his hand across the lid. It felt like he was like seeing an old friend again after years apart.
“I’m everything I am today, not because of you. No, I’m everything I am,
“Hot.” Clint muttered, looking his boyfriend up and down - a sultry smirk growing on his lips.
Steve pulled back, confused as his best friend's name left his girlfriend's lips.
“I promise, Daniel.”
“Well, I can’t argue with a scientific fact.”
“Hello,” Toni whispered, softly smiling as her future in-laws looked toward the brunette.
“Thank you, Steve.” Toni smiled, biting her lip, as she struggled at holding back her chuckles.
“Okay... I’m so lost. How many languages does the team speak?”  The host asked, looking honestly confused.
God, she was beautiful.
“Of course, this is nothing compared to what you’ve done for me,” Toni told him, smiling as his heated blue gaze rested on her lips.
“We could,” Reed said, smiling at his wife. “That sounds like a lot of fun.”
_____________________________________________________
Steve growled lowly in her ear. “We’ll be discussing this later, Miss Stark.”
“I promised her and.. I- Peggy find her, find Toni and tell her.. Tell her I love her.. Tell her she’s the only one I’ve ever wanted.. Tell her..
Toni took a deep breath, seeing the pain in those beautiful blue eyes and agreed. Knowing it was a promise she could never really keep, but for the sake of his mind, it was worth making.
“Yeah, a genius told me that. She also tells me she’s never wrong, so it would go against a scientific fact to disagree with her.”
“Oh my gosh,” Sarah whispered. “I have a daughter.” The older woman closed the distance between them, wrapping the taller brunette in her embrace. Toni couldn’t stop the tears that fell down her cheeks as she hugged Steve’s mother.
Steve did his best to ignore the colors of the couches and how they matched his and Toni’s superhero uniforms. Every time he saw the colors of red and blue together, he was immediately reminded of his and Toni’s relationship.
“Would you like to attend our wedding?”
Toni whispered softly. She couldn’t help but laugh as she watched his blue eyes grow wide from shock, as he pulled away from Toni’s embrace.
Toni finally comes face to face with Howard.
“Can’t be Rogers or Barnes,” Fury told him.
“Next question!”
Bucky nodded his head and shot him a thankful smile.
“Fuck off, Barnes,” and with that Toni went back to kissing her super-soldier, on her couch, in her tower.
“I’m listening,” Clint whispered, his gaze never leaving Buckys.
“Why white? Why not red?” Bucky asked, sitting down at the table with a beer in his hand.
“JARVIS, call Strange... And alert Edwin... We have a problem.”
“I’m technically not, well physically anyway.” He waved his hand straight through the sofa.
“Yep, I’m here.”
Steve flipped the locks up and opened the chest, the smell of their old apartment wafting under his nose. He turned to Toni and Bucky and waved them over. His two best friends made their way over and kneeled down beside the chest, smiling as the smell of their shared home flooded their senses.
“You said something about dancing?” Toni asked, smiling a weak smile at Bucky.
Walking into the room, the smell of fresh lavender wafting under their nostrils, as they heard the soothing instrumental music coming from a speaker in the ceiling. They noticed the lowlights of the room, sending a very calm vibe out as they saw two white massage tables in the center of the room, and two tall men standing with their hands locked behind their backs.
“New beginnings, marriage,” Toni whispered, smiling down as she held the three roses so delicately in her hand.
“Oh yeah, umm,” Toni said softly, noticing she had left the tools out on the floor. The older man looked at the tools and then back to Toni.
_______________________________________
Was it her? Who was he drawing?
Steve’s hardened gaze ran up and down her form as if he was reminding himself who he was speaking to and softly shook his head. Bringing his large hands up to his face, Steve rubbed his eyes with his fingers as whispers of ‘sorry’ fell from his lips. Anger still evident on his face and in his tone, but not like before.
“Yep, always fun to spin a dame around a dance floor. Or in our case a gym or kitchen floor.” Bucky said, stealing a sip of Sam’s soda.
“Hello handsome,” Toni panted, as she placed a kiss on Steve's lips.
“No can do, my fair Captain. She’ll be back in maybe a week's time. Maybe less, maybe more.”
“Yes sir?” Reed answered, looking towards his wife with a confused look on his face.
“Like build you a car smart.”
They arrived at SHIELD headquarters about thirty minutes after leaving the tower, Steve’s mindset and form grew colder and stiffer by the minute.
A couple of weeks passed by since that Wednesday where Toni came in on her day off, saving the office from turmoil, pulling Bucky and Clint’s heads out their asses, and getting them together.
“No, you just have the stamina of a racehorse.” Bucky breathed, taking a sip of his own.
Steve told her his pa would say that to him at least once a week, and Steve hated it.
“Yeah,” she whispered. “I’m here.”
The days after Toni left dragged by. Bucky and Steve both noticed the emptiness in the apartment without their lively genius bumbling around.
“You aren’t naked in all of them, some are you laughing, some are sappy, some are you being sweet and innocent -
Steve’s art bag hit the floor with a
“Toni...” Steve whispered, in shock.
“I’ve never seen you working on this notebook, can I see?”
Toni looked down the aisle as she locked arms with Fury and Edwin Jarvis, smiling at her found family. Each dressed in their superhero costumes, from Natasha’s black leather outfit, Clint’s purple combat suit, Sam’s red and grey wings, and Thor’s Norse armor.
(See the end of the chapter for
“The exact one.”
“Call me Toni.” She said smiling and pulled her phone out of her pocket to type the pizza order to JARVIS.
“I leave Friday at noon. The first train to Los Angeles.”
“Toni? Who’s yours?” The fan asked, a slight blush on his cheeks as he talked to the superhero.
“Everyone grab a test tube and go lay down on the couches, it won't take too long, and you’ll be back to your normal adult self,” Bruce informed them, laying the glass tubes of pink liquid down on the table.
“Put her down! You can’t use Toni as a shield, that’s not fair!”
“Have a good night,” Toni told him, handing Steve his two hot dogs.
“Yeah, speaking of sharing. Toni, wanna join Bucky and me tonight, in bed?” Clint asked, wiggling his eyebrows up and down suggestively.
“It’s not disgusting, Clint,” Natasha said with a smirk as she placed a kiss onto her girlfriend's lips. “It’s hot.”
Toni couldn’t help but pinch herself as she stared at her reflection in the mirror. The beautiful white gown that covered her body. Designed in a white floral lace, and a sweetheart neckline giving her the perfect amount of cleavage showing - hoping she would catch her fiancé's eyes drifting down to her cleavage and arc reactor. The dress was a simple, light, ballerina style. Semi-sheer, as the back was low cut and tattooed up her bare skin with the white floral lace.
_____________________________________
“I did not need to see this.” With that, he placed his hand over his eyes. “Oh gross, Steve.”
“Of course, I’ve had such a great night.”
“Yeah, don’t you remember? You sent them to Jarvis.”
Toni makes her way back home, and angst. Yeah, that's it.
“No,” Toni mumbled, as she continued folding the same pair of pants she’d been folding since he walked into the room.
Steve just outwardly groaned, knowing in his heart Toni would hate those shirts so much she would make him wear it, and well that thought made him smile. But then again, everything about Toni made him smile.
Toni unfolded her black slacks once more and rolled her eyes, mumbling: “That’s stupid.”
“You played an excellent game, Miss Stark.”
Natasha whispered, the smaller blond nodded his head and moved his fingers over his lips, like a zipper.
“We already did that,” the short blond shrugged his shoulders, stealing a small piece of chicken off Toni’s plate before bolting out of the break room.
“Come on, Stevie, ya remember what your pa said. You gotta treat a lady with respect. Look at her when she speaks, open her door, stand up when she leaves the table. Ya gotta give her your attention,” Bucky whispered to his small best friend, Toni only catching that because of her serum-enhanced hearing. Steve turned his attention to Bucky and whispered back:
.” His baby blues shining bright with unshed tears.
“You’re only here right now because I made you who you are.” Howard spit, his breath coming out ragged and weak. “You’d be some scrawny kid in Brooklyn if it wasn’t for
“Oh please, I know everyone in this room has sex.” Sarah smiled and shot Toni and a knowing look.
“Th’ts good Tones,” He slurred, eyes still closed the same look of defeat covering his face.
“Fine. But I’m not gonna like it.” He pouted.
“And they have so much fun doing it.”
“Stark, what are you wearing under that suit?” Falcon asked. “I damn sure know a wedding dress wouldn’t fit.”
When she felt the warm air of their apartment settle across her skin and the comforting smell of Steve and Bucky. Toni knew she was home and safe. The slightly musty smell along with the mix of old wood and leather. That smell had become home. Her home.
“Of course, he’s a very lucky man, I’m sure,” Werner said and pulled a white envelope out of his jacket.
“He’s in his beloved Asgard, and I wanted to visit Earth’s Mightiest Heroes.”
“Thank you, James..” Toni whispered, the brunet responded with a sad smile.
“Keep up!” The blond shouted as they made their way to their front door.
Toni hadn’t noticed how the distance closed between their two faces. But, it had and Bucky’s blue eyes were staring right at Toni’s lips.
Making him suffer, just like he made Toni.
“Shut up, Barnes!”
“Yes! Welcome aboard the winning train!!” Sam shouted with a grin on his face.
Toni and Steve are finally back in the present!! Time for fluff!!!!
“Come on in, I’m decent.”
“Captain Rogers, you may kiss your bride.” Steve wrapped his arms around his bride, sealing their lips for the first time as husband and wife as he dipped her at the altar. Their friends and family erupted in shouts of joy as the two were finally married.
Toni snorted looking at one of JARVIS’s speakers.
“Well,” the host laughed as the room erupted in screams yet again. “Captain America has spoken; Iron Man is the greatest Avenger.”
Toni laughed into his chest and whispered: “I love you too, James,” she placed a kiss on the taller man's cheek.
Natasha signed, and with that, the taller man nodded his head.
“Oh, MIT this, MIT that.”
“Yeah.”
“Thank you," Steve said, making Bucky roll his eyes.
_________
“Hello beautiful,” Steve breathed, dropping his forehead onto hers. Smiling as he felt the soft skin of his nose as it brushed against the side of his own. His black glasses softly bumping up his nose, only for Toni to gently fix them before dropping her hands back around his neck.
“You’re crazy.” Toni panted, leaning against the door frame as he unlocked their apartment door.
“I’ll be okay... I should be askin’ you the same question, doll.” The brunette sighed in response, staring up into his blue eyes as they were lit perfectly by the moonlight shining through the window.
“So was Toni.” Clint chuckled under his breath.
The domestic feeling that was Toni’s life, for the time being, was a great one.
Or how Toni changed her schedule with SHIELD to match up with Steve’s - there was something that just pulled the two heroes together.
The next couple of weeks flew by as Toni’s days were filled with working with Daniel across the city. Bringing home meals and some cash. Her nights were filled with laying around the living room as Steve filled sketchbook after sketchbook, never showing her his drawings, but talking mindlessly to her as they did. Some nights all three of them played cards or went to the movies.
“Huh?” She panted.
“Now can we get in the bed?”
“Disgusting.” They heard as the door closed with a click.
“Ah, young love. Well, we will let you young ones get to your supper, have a good night. But not too much fun, no babies until after you're married!” Elisa said and Steve couldn’t help the snort that left his nose. Seeing the shocked look on Toni’s face and hearing Bucky choke on his own breath.
Toni walked out from behind her super-soldier, looking the dark-haired god up and down. “What can we do for you Loki?” She asked, crossing her arms in front of her chest.
Toni and post-serum Steve had talked about kids before, both expressing their desire to have a little mixture of them running around in this world. But, she had no clue Steve had desired such a big family, and honestly... It warmed her heart. Both of them having been an only child, it started to make a lot more sense that they both craved that bigger family.
“Shut up, Barnes. I’ve walked in on you doing way worse.” Steve watched as Toni’s fingers buttoned up his shirt on her body and bit her lip as she caught him watching every delicate move her fingers made.
“Take me upstairs,” she whispered on his lips, not expecting the smaller man to grab her hand and yank her up the final staircase.
one on each side of his dame’s head. His five-foot-six, a hundred and ten-pound body felt like a six-foot-five, behemoth of a man with the way Toni surrendered to his movements. Like he was Captain, brave and commanding when he was her embrace. He felt like a man who had the world at his beck and call. He felt like he was the man he always wanted to be in her embrace.
The brunette just shook her head at the stupid antics of their friends, ignoring their shouts, and just as she turned back to Steve. About to ask the bigger man to finish his thoughts when Bucky and Clint came barreling through the door.
“You’re probably right.” He chuckled at how small the white button-up was. Seeing how much bigger he was now, that was still a shock to him some days. “Well,” he whispered, “it looked better on her anyway.”
“We’ll treat ya good, doll,” Bucky said, a smile on his face, biting back his laughter as they both teased Steve.
“Surprise.” She heard Steve’s voice, closer this time.
“Let’s go answer some crazy questions!” Bucky shouted as he ran ahead of the group towards the stage door.
They both hated being compared to the other. Acted as if that was the biggest insult in the world.
“Brother, bring her back this instance. Lady Stark has been nothing but good to the people of Asgard.” The trickster god sat up on the table and smiled at his older brother.
So, instead of getting dressed for her wedding in four hours - no, she had to go deal with her dead parents instead. Well, that’s what every girl wants to hear on her wedding day.
“I’m sorry if this is inappropriate.”
“The sass,” Steve muttered, smiling at his fiancée as she rested over his shoulder.
Unless it was on the battlefield or the bedroom, of course.
“Dum-E if you don’t stop rolling around with that fire extinguisher, I swear you’re going to live on Clint and Bucky’s floor and your new job is gonna be cleaning their bathroom!”
“I could say the same for you, grandpa.” Johnny smirked and handed him the Stark Pad. “I don’t like you. But I figured this could be your wedding gift, watch your fiancée meet your parents.”
“Possessive aren’t they?” Sarah asked, smiling at Toni.
“They sure have,” Toni smiled as she popped a piece in her mouth, dropping the wrapper in Steve’s trash can. The little brunette unwrapped another one, discarding the trash, and made her way back over to Steve. “I’ve told you for years, they weren’t in
“Mine.” He groaned, burying his face into her neck, now resting his full body weight atop hers.
“Okay, good. Now, sit down and eat some pizza. I’ll be back in a few and we can watch a movie or something.” Steve nodded his head, taking a seat at the table as Toni made her way to her room to change.
Toni held a large plate of scrambled eggs, making her way over to the table, her mind replaying the past two months in her head when it hit her. The large plate of scrambled eggs dropped from her hands and shattered to the floor. Yellow blobs of eggs and ceramic pieces scattered across the room. The steady stream of conversation grew quiet and everyone's eyes were now focused on Toni as she stood there, frozen.
“Thanks, Brucie.”
“How was work?” Toni asked Bucky, making her way to sit down on the couch as Bucky took a seat in his classic, brown leather chair.
“I know just what you need.” The grey-haired lady disappeared behind the stand. Reappearing not a second later, walking back over to Steve with a small bouquet of three pure white roses.
“Bless them brother,” Thor muttered.
“For one, it’s the third Wednesday of the month. The day the life of the office leaves me, and of course, everything decides to break. The coffee machine blew up as soon as Clint plugged it in. No one knows how to fix the copier or even knows what’s wrong with it and Clint’s even more annoying than normal not having you here to throw paper airplanes at.”
“You’ll be fine, Capcicle. You’ll have fun with the guys.”
Steve whispered. “No, Toni should.” Steve looked around the hallway. “Where is...”
“I’ll give ya and Stevie some time alone.” The brunette nodded and waved as the bigger man made his way over to a bench, giving the two lovers some time alone.
Toni sniffed, feeling the tears as they fell from her eyes, onto his bare chest.
“I was gonna give you guys some family time,” Toni whispered, watching as Steve’s smile fell off his lips.
“Good, she deserves that.” And with that, Steve continued to stare at his half-eaten pizza slice on his plate.
“I got him, thank you, James," Toni said, running one of her hands mindlessly through the blond's hair.
“Well no, but, Steve--."
Steve whispered, his voice breaking at the fullness of emotion that coated it. “I lost
Toni stormed back to the table. Leaving the man clutching his face in shock, on the middle of the dance floor.
“T-thank you. Thank you both, so much.” Steve gripped the dollar bill in his hand and asked: “Are you sure?”
speak that way about a lady!” Steve jerked forward in Bucky’s arms, fuming at Clint. “Especially not
“I would love to!..” Toni paused and reminded herself she only wanted to see his art if he was ready to show her. “Only if you’re comfortable with me seeing them. I know what they mean to you, Steve.”
“Where is she then?” Sam asked, stealing the words from Steve’s mouth.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve stumbled into the spot where Toni had just stood, not seconds before. A boiling fury like no other rushed through his veins as he grabbed the trickster god by the collar of his green shirt, and threw him against the fridge.
Once the wedding festivities calmed down, the newly married couple escaped the crowd and made their way to the penthouse floor - exhaustion had hit them like a truck as soon as they hit the elevator.
“Hello, Johnny. Wanna give me and your brother-in-law a hand on this?”
“Which one of them hit ya?” Bucky asked, his eyes running across the gash on her cheek. Toni shook her head in response, not knowing when or how the cut had gotten on her cheek.
“I’ll make sure Fury knows there were witnesses.”
Steve paced around the living room floor as Stephen Strange searched the multiverses for signs of Toni. It had been a little over an hour since Loki pulled another one of his tricks, sending Toni off to God knows where leaving Steve and the tower's residents a mess with worry. All Steve could think about is what if she's gone forever. What if time fucked him over
“Well, I don’t mean to interrupt ya and whatever this is..” Bucky gestured between the two of them who were now holding hands and smiling at the other like idiots. “But, I’ve gotta head down to the steel mill, and Stevie, you have that tutoring lesson for that little punk down the street,” Bucky informed them, breaking the two from their trance.
He wasn’t weird about it, because sometimes he caught her smiling at him too. Toni would watch him as he sold more products to a client than they needed, using his silver tongue to keep him at the top of the sales leader board where he had been the past four years.
“I swear to God, Stark. I will kick your ass one of these days.” The man laughed as he stretched his arm across the room grabbing a tool, he needed off the work bench.
One key thing stuck out.
“Babydoll, I need you to breathe.” She heard Steve, his hands firmly gripping her shoulders as he leaned down into his sight of vision. His spatula fell, forgotten to the floor as his attention was solely focused on his fiancée.
The soldier carried Toni over his shoulder, out of the interrogation room. A smile unbelievably wide on his lips as they made their way down the hallway.
“People are like that, Toni, it’s just how it is.”
“Even drunk, he’s the biggest sap I’ve ever seen.” Toni heard Bucky chuckle.
_____________________________
Toni sighed, nodded her head, and began making her way over to her side of the bed where Steve stood near the window. She pulled the covers back only to be pulled into Steve’s arms as stood beside her.
“Toni, doll, breathe,” Bucky said, taking the smaller woman's hands into his. “We ain’t mad. If anything, we’re overjoyed. You got us a free dinner and a warm apartment all in nine hours. We should be thanking you.” Toni turned her head as she watched Bucky talk.
“I promise. What’s up, Rogers?” And with that the blond took his hand off his eyes, smiling at the appearance of Toni standing in front of him. “What?” Toni asked, feeling a blush rise to her cheeks.
It was nothing like either had ever experienced before and now never wanted to go without - from this day forward.
It had been an oddly quiet week for the Avengers.
side as they walked down the hall to their bedroom.
Today had been one of those days where even though it had just started - you already wanted it to be over.
“One second, babe.” And with that, she walked into the kitchen and grabbed the midnight blue apron that hung on the pantry door.
“Never too tired for cheeseburgers, Hap.” Toni snuggled closer to Steve and flashed him a soft smile, saying: “Wake me when it’s time for cheeseburgers please.”
“How long?” Bucky asked.
use that tone with me, Steven.” Toni glowered at the taller man. Reminding him that no matter how angry he got - he was never allowed to speak to her like that.
“It would really help when I’m kissin’ ya doll if you didn’t shout out my best friend's name..”
Steve dreamed a lot when it came to Toni Stark and yeah some of the time there were some sexual thoughts, but he blamed the serum for his ridiculously high sex drive.
“I’m going in case the big blond decides to try and kill Howard.” Bucky informed them, then pointed to Clint and said: “He’s going so you don’t kill Reed Richards.”
Bucky yelled as he sat back down on the couch. “That’s another image I’ll never get out of my head.”
“Wouldn’t you like to know,” Toni smirked, making both men spit out their drinks. Neither one of them expected those words to leave her mouth. Bucky wiped his lips with the sleeve of his dark shirt. Then reached over, patting his coughing best friend on the back.
“My grandpa,” he whispered. Hands moving faster as he worked with some wires, not wanting to look the shorter genius in the face.
“Happy wedding week.”
Toni just smiled as she approached the taller man, hand feeding him the pink Starburst. A heated look flushing her pupils and a sultry grin growing on her lips as Steve’s teeth softly brushed her fingertips, and his tongue quickly danced across her soft skin.
“Mhh,” he muttered, burying his face into Toni’s chest.
“An hour, I only witnessed the small Captain mauling you in the hallway, no worries.”
“Ain’t she a looker, Stevie?” Bucky grinned from ear to ear as he watched his best friend's mouth gape like a fish.
“Yes, do ya like dancing?”
“All right. Let us play.”
“Yep,” Bucky nodded, wrapping his arm around Toni’s shoulders. “I watched him do it.”
“Water boy?” Clint chuckled. Both men receive a sharp smack to the back of the head from Natasha. Steve took his bottom lip in between his teeth and looked back down at his interlocked hands in his lap.
really.”
. Clint, give it to me.” Steve commanded.
“Toni..” James’ hand cupped the side of her face and before she could even blink. His lips were on hers.
“Wow, thank you, ma’am.”
Toni just smiled at Steve as he strode across the dance floor and as she opened her painted red lips to speak, he sealed them with his own. Running his hands delicately down the lace that was painting her body, firming holding in his arms what was
“I don’t know why you ruined that, I wanted him to lay one on Steve so I could see Steve blush as red as a tomato.”
“Hiya, doll, my name’s James Barnes… Ya can call me Bucky...” The taller man scratched the back of his head, as he turned to face the five foot five, Steve Rogers. “We uh --”
“Oh, come on, you two get her all the time. Tossing her around like a real whore, I’m sure. Give a real man a chance to fuck her.” It was with those words Steve lost it. Pushing Toni into Bucky’s arms, he marched himself over to the bigger man.
“Right, I’ll be right back, Steve.”
She shouted, raising her hands in the air as she figured out who she would wanna be.
“You liked that, huh?” Toni asked, her eyes darkening as she turned to look up at the blond super soldier that now stood over her shoulder. Steve smiled, admiring his drawing of the two of them in the middle of his bed.
“Well, then why do you love it so much?”
“That’s a beautiful dame if I’ve ever seen one,” Joseph said, smiling at Toni. She watched Sarah roll her eyes at her husband and flash Toni a smile.
“Just make sure that letter goes in your first one, so J knows what he’s getting.”
“Well, what about some ice cream?” Toni suggested, grabbing the tiny Steve’s attention from Thor’s arms around her waist.
“You want to talk about not remembering something! All Toni and I did was a kiss, you fuckin’ mauled her right in the living room!” Bucky announced to the room, earning a chuckle from Natasha and a gasp from Jarvis’s lips.
“It’s delicious pizza, Stevie, really.”
One of the guards came close to Toni, only to back up when Steve shot a murderous glare in his direction. The soldier protectively threw his arm around Toni’s waist and pulled the genius closer to his body. Ignoring the snort from Sam and Clint as he heard Bucky whisper:
The archer continued to play a game on his phone as Pepper asked questions about the honeymoon in Italy. It wasn’t until Toni caught Clint’s eyes growing wide after a soft ‘
“Let’s get to work, Richards.” Toni said, flashing the man a soft smile.
Knowing that her time here would be ending sooner rather than later and she had to think of a way to break it to Steve. She needed a good enough lie that he would believe. Because she sure as hell couldn’t say, ‘Hey! You become a superhuman, punch Hitler in the face, and then sleep in an ice bath for seventy years. Then you become a part of a super-secret boy-band of superheroes and we fall in love, even though you’re eighty years older than me.’
to speak.
“It was
“How about you, Maria? Any questions for Steve?”
“It doesn’t seem that’s possible.” She heard Clint mutter.
“Arc Reactor...” Steve muttered, letting the words roll off his tongue. “Does it hurt?”
“Is Bucky alive?” Toni asked dryly, not looking up from her pile of clothes.
“Did you forget how ta knock?” Steve asked, fixing his collar.
“Well, why wasn’t it me? I had it funded for at least another ten years even after I passed away.”
“I’m sorry, did you say alive?” Joseph asked.
“It’s all yours, doll. But I want your suit.”
Toni smiled brightly and reassured him. “Babe, I’m just checking to make sure he isn’t here.”
, like you know
“I love you,” Toni whispered, laying her head down onto the bigger man's shoulder. Those beautiful chocolate eyes smiling up at him, like he had personally hung the moon and stars just for her.
” Bucky shouted over his shoulder, as he made his way closer to the passed-out dame. “Miss, miss are you alright?” Checking her neck for a pulse and breathing a sigh of relief as he felt the
. I wanna know what makes you jealous, I wanna know what makes your heart do cartwheels in your chest. I wanna know what tv shows make you laugh, Steve... You don’t talk about yourself.. I just wanna know you better.” Toni wiped the tears from her cheeks and whispered.
“I get jealous..” He muttered, releasing Toni’s hands, rolling off her body to bury his face into one of their pillows.
“Come on, doll.” Steve reached his arm out, as a sad smile grew on his lips. “Let’s go see your parents.”
“Nope, Nat’s rules. No penises allowed.” Toni told him. “That means you and yours, Mr. Rogers.” Steve huffed, his bottom lip poking out into a pout, as his arms wrapped tighter around her waist.
“Hi, handsome,” she whispered.
“We must have adopted him,” Steve stole a piece of Broccoli from Toni’s plate, smiling even wider as her eyes just watched him drop the small vegetable in his mouth, sucking the soy sauce off his fingers.
“Good, I’m very glad.” Maria turned her gaze back down to the table as she asked her last question.
Toni took a step back, not believing the words that just left her fiancé’s lips.
“Give that back!” Sam shouted, snatching the drink out of the metal man's hand. “Get your own..” Sam took a long refreshing sip of
“God, Steve. These are... beautiful,” she told him, not having seen this much of his work before.
“Can we look?” She asked, a soft, unsure smile gracing her lips.
“Yes, I would. They have done wonderful things for this galaxy. You have blessed them, so why shouldn’t I?”
“Ask away!” Toni spoke into her microphone as she snuggled back into Bucky’s chest.
He wasn’t sure why the beautiful woman would pick Steve’s scrawny self over Bucky.
“Why, thank you, Miss. Grant. You will come highly recommended from the Von Doom household.”
“I kissed ya, doll, you didn’t start it. If anything you pushed me away, both times..”
Steve told him, shaking his head intently. “No, no we do not.”

“Cover your naked wife man!” Sam shouted.
“Go back home, Loki,” Clint sneered.
“There you two are, I was wondering where you scurried off too,” Bucky said, placing a kiss on Toni's temple and smiling at Steve. “Gorgeous flowers. Stevie get ya those?” He asked Toni, turning and wiggling his eyebrows suggestively at Steve. Steve rolled his eyes and nodded his head.
“Ladies, please undress to your comfort level and we will be back in five minutes.” The taller man said as Toni picked up a slight Hawaiian accent slipping from his lips.
He sat Toni down to her feet, and she watched as he barreled across the room, wrapping his arms around his parents. Toni smiled as she listened to the whispers of ‘I love you’ from all three of their lips.
“What?” He asked, confusion clear in his eyes.
“Seems so.”
“Fine, don’t cry. You’re not going anywhere, babe,” Toni said, opening her arms to her sensitive robot to roll into a hug.
Toni used her free hand to strike the man in his neck. Using the area between her thumb and pointer finger, to knock the breath right out of his throat. As he dropped his grip on her wrist, his hand came up and knocked her across the cheek. Toni retaliated by landing a roundhouse kick to his chest. Using her vibranium leg to make the landing. As the pervert stood hunched over, now groaning over the pain in his chest and throat - Toni swept his legs out from under him, knocking the man unconscious as he hit the hard, cold pavement.
“You’re alright my darling, you’re home.” She heard the deep, soothing British tone she grew up finding all her comfort in. “Sergeant Barnes has been awake for several hours now. The Dr. said something about how your Steven still had a little more of his past to live through before he awoke.” Edwin flashed her a reassuring smile. “Sergeant Barnes has been with Clint sharing stories, and your soldier should be awaking any--”
“Hey, cut that out. You’re Steve Rogers, youra catch.”
“And you aren’t...
I hope y'all enjoyed this chapter!! I can't wait to update the rest!! We get to see Toni and Steve acclimating back to 2014 together! (aka small angst)
“We shall,” Toni told him, locking her hand around the smaller man’s arm.
Toni smiled into Steve’s reassuring, ever true blue eyes and nodded her head.
“So good to see you son,” he muttered, placing a kiss on Bucky's forehead.
you did anything and everything in your power to beat her down, like she was garbage. Didn’t you Howard?” The red grew rapidly in the older man's face as Steve’s grip grew tighter around the man's neck. “
“You’re not from here, Toni, I don’t know how I know it, but I do.” He placed his bony hand on Toni’s shoulder and smiled. A look of comfort and love in his eyes. “You’re different. Bold, outspoken, brave, intelligent beyond my own beliefs.”
“Yes.” The older man choked. Tears streamed down his face as Steve continued choking him to the brink of asphyxiation. He dropped the older man to the floor, wiping his hands off on his uniform pants in disgust.
“I’ll get it,” he grunted as he pulled his body off the couch and out of his lover's embrace.
“You were accidentally pulled into the future.” Toni muttered, folding her hands together in front of her chest.
“No,” Toni replied, her tongue peeking out to wet her bottom lip.
“Pizza sounds great, boys. That alright with you two?” Toni asked the Brooklyn boys as they made their way into the kitchen.
“I love you,” Toni said, placing another kiss on his lips.
“Toni, doll..." Panic in his eyes as he knew he didn’t have funds for a cab.
Who was single on the team? All of them.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No, don't you dare!” The smaller blond sighed, crossing his arms over his chest. “I’ll get over it. I’m the maid of honor, fuck them.”
He growled, nipping again at her bottom lip.
Even if it did turn out for the worst.
“Thanks, Tones,” Bucky said, sincerity clear in his tone.
Steve wanted to take Toni to an ice-skating rink and hold her hand as they did laps around the rink, just enjoying the company of the other. He wanted to take her out to central park with a picnic basket and layout on a blanket, enjoying the springtime in New York City.
“Fuck, can’t ya do that in the bedroom. I did not need ‘ta witness this.”
“I wasn’t gonna let him hurt ya. Yer my fella after all,” Bucky reassured his boyfriend.
“Also, Joe?” Toni asked, watching as the taller man redirected his smile to her.
Just as Toni’s fingernails slightly tapped the glass of her arc reactor, Steve lunged. Grabbing his
The two got to work on the big white machine as Sue was messing with a laptop that was connected to it.
“He’s kind, intelligent, and much older than me...” Toni whispered. “He has blond hair and blue eyes.” Steve cracked one eye open, raising his eyebrow as he stared at the shorter woman in surprise.
“Yeah,” Steve smiled at his teammate and turned back to Toni. “Doll, wanna teach me Italian? I learned a bit of it from the war, but I think you’d be a better teacher.”
“I might just have to steal a dance with your bride, son.” The soldier rolled his eyes, a chuckle falling from his lips. “She is one beautiful dame.”
Stark.
“Portuguese, German, Russian, Latin, and Japanese,” Bucky told them.
“Tell me Steve, did my own daughter turn you against me?”
The brunette jumped to her feet, slamming the chest closed in shock. Brushing the imaginary dust off of Steve’s borrowed pants, and quietly made her way to the front door.
“Mrs. Stark, Howard.”
“Don’t have to tell me twice,” and with that Steve threw Toni over his shoulder, like he always did. “Come on Pa, Ma. Let's get me hitched.”
Toni looked down, noticing she was still in the same clothes she got on the train with, and glancing around the bedroom she saw her two brown bags against the wall. Toni smiled, deeming those her best travel bags yet.
“You think she’s warm enough, Buck?”
“Alrighty then." A smile on the driver's lips as Toni nodded her head in excitement.
“Can I have some rice!?!” Clint shouted as he ran into the break room, a dark red hickey on his neck. Telling both Steve and Toni that he and Bucky had snuck into the Supply closet yet again.
And by the looks of it, Toni had a great future to look forward too if Steve continued to age like his father.
“No, no it’s perfect up here,” Bucky whispered, running his flesh hand over the scratches that littered the arms of the chair. “Thank you, Toni.”
“No!” Clint shouted, holding the laughing Toni tighter to his chest. “Not until you promise not to kill me!!”
“Cuddling you.” Toni placed a kiss into his blond locks as she snuggled her body closer to the bigger man, smiling as she took the position of being the big spoon.
“You’ll survive,” Bucky informed him as he turned his attention back to Toni. “So, relationship rules. Would you fuck an alternate timeline, Steve?” Toni scratched the back of her neck and smiled.
“Clint, you don’t have to be my maid of honor. I can ask Pepper or Nat.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Enjoy the rest of your miserable life, Howard.” Toni told him, a confident smile on her face as a blue cloud appeared over them and they both disappeared from the room.
“You’re very welcome, Lady Stark. Please, do let me know if you are ever interested, you are always welcome in Asgard. And I can say as the god of Fertility you would not go unsatis --”
“How’s Antonia?” She asked meekly, Steve noticed Howard’s eye roll in his peripheral vision.
“No child deserves to be beaten by her own father. You were supposed to
“I can’t wait to see you in your dress!” Pepper squealed from the sofa, as she drank her green kombucha through a metal straw.
Steve just groaned as he got a warning glare from Pepper, watching the fierce redhead pull Toni away, leading her to greet some guests.
The two men, equally as frozen as the genius.
“No, you ain’t, man.”
But Toni won’t ever forget the look in Steve’s eyes when he told her:
Toni swore Steve was a man from the ’40s with the way he worked electronics and dressed. But if Steve was being honest, he knew how to work a computer, better than anyone in the office - besides Toni.
I lost Bucky. I lost my parents. I wasn’t even alive when they died, I was frozen in ice…” A broken laugh left his lips. “I’ve lost everything I’ve ever loved and if I open up again... If I..” He took deep, watery breaths, gripping her tighter to his body.
Steve watched as girls and guys alike began exchanging punches, shouts of a ship's names leaving their lips. Signs and objects were thrown across the room, and when a shoe made its way to the stage, landing less than two feet in front of Steve and Toni. That was when security rushed up onto the stage and told the heroes it was time to go.
“Thank you, Mr. Von Doom.”
“Umm...” Steve muttered, turning to Toni as her head rested on his shoulder. “I... um...”
“Nice!” Sam cheered, turning to Clint with his hand up for a high five.
Toni heard a few beeps of disappointment and then the crashing sound of Dum-E dropping the fire extinguisher on his collection of things in his cubby. His cubby was in the corner of the lab. That was where he charged and stored his favorite things. It was like his bedroom if robots had their own bedroom. The corner room, Dum-E’s room, was full of things like fire extinguishers, tennis balls, and the artwork Steve drew for him.
“Let’s go get you married, huh?” Nick asked the couple, a soft smile forming on his face.
“He’s tall and a gentleman...”
“And?” Steve asked softly, worry prevalent in his voice. Toni held up the ticket in her hand, her heartbreaking as she watched Steve’s face fall.
Toni heard a soft groan fall from the smaller Steve’s lips, and his arms tighten around her waist.
Preparing himself the best he could to face his soon to be father-in-law as he opened the door.
she whispered, smiling softly into Bucky’s comforting blue eyes.
“Come on, let’s go see what she did.” Steve told him, shrugging his shoulders when Clint mouthed ‘What is it?’
“Are you alright?” Toni whispered, hearing a groan leave the blond’s lips, as he got situated under the covers.
“Yes, sir, I did. About an hour ago.” Toni warily eyed the older man as he took in her appearance again. Then a smile graced the older man’s lips and Toni breathed a sigh of relief.
“Well, it’s a pleasure to meet ya, Toni Grant,”  Steve smiled. “Grant’s a good name. My ma’s maiden name and my middle name.”
..” Fell off Toni’s lips in a breathy moan as she ran her fingers through his hair, slightly tugging on his golden locks.
“Well, now I sure would, doll.”
She stuck her tongue out in response to the taller man and then turned to face Bucky, doing the same to him. Bucky smirked and stuck his tongue back out in response to the genius.
“If I'm sure?” Steve chuckled, shaking his head in disbelief at Toni's gentle care of his heart. Just another reason he loved her so much. “Toni are you? I mean you deserve a fella who can wow ya... I don’t think...” He looked down at his body and sighed. “I’m not that guy.”
She made her way into the apartment seeing Steve, sitting at the wobbly, wooden table sketching in one of his notebooks.
“Oh, no. I don’t know about that. My work doesn’t hold a candle to Monet or Van Gogh.”
- doll. You des-
” He slurred, holding Toni’s hands in his. “Lif’ is so un-unfair., Lif’ sucks ass!”
“Don’t worry about it, Tones. Stevie can’t get enough of you. He’s pretty possessive of his dame.” Bucky reassured her with a soft smile.
“I never expected him to go for a brunette, especially one with short hair. But gosh dang it, he got the prettiest girl I’ve ever seen.”
Steve nodded his head as he fixed the collar of his jacket, saying: “I’ll be back ‘round four, we can scrounge something up for supper after I get home... It gets pretty cold in here with the heater being broken. But there’s a jacket or two in the closet in my room, if you need ‘em.”
Toni chuckled.
“Oh, man! Who made ‘hose dum dum rules?”
“Mine as well, brother.” Thor nodded to his younger brother, smiling proudly at Toni.
“That would require us actually seeing Steve for more than fifteen minutes.” Bucky chuckled, reading his newspaper.
“I love you, future Mrs. Rogers.” He muttered against her lips, admiring the blush that flooded her cheeks.
“Yes, follow me.” He led them out of the dark office, down the blinding white hall, and into what seemed to be a living room.
“Yes, I know him... He works with m-
“Bucky, you end up with someone who makes you really happy too... Just so you know.”
The older man drew a deep breath, sighing in relief as he placed a kiss onto her forehead. “Thank you, dollbaby.”
“It’s 11:30 in the afternoon, Steve."
in her dress. He had been talking to Sam and Clint, but as soon as she stepped off that elevator his feet were moving before he could even realize it.
“Why doesn’t he just fuck you instead.” Toni shrugged her shoulders. “Save me and everyone else in this office from the disgusting sexual tension between you too.”
“Wait, wait. Thor, you would sleep with me?” Toni asked, a bright smile on her lips as she brought her legs up on the sofa and pulled them close to her chest. She locked her hands around her knees and smiled at the god.
An hour or so later, Toni made her way into the kitchen to grab a bite to eat when she saw Bucky sitting in his brown leather chair, reading the newspaper.
But that wasn’t something he wanted to confess in a room of over five hundred fans and most of his teammates. Hell, that was something he was only just now admitting to himself.
“Welcome back, my sunshine.” Her father said, placing a kiss on her temple. “I have missed you.”
“Yes, thank you," Toni and Bucky walked arm and arm, showing the older couple out the front door. "Danny, I’ll see you tomorrow, and thank you Elisa for the dinners.”
Plus, the floral lace reminded her of her and Steve and all their memories and stories with white roses.
Always having ‘meetings’, but Steve knew they were just three floors up, avoiding the chaos that was Toni’s absence.
Steve laughed at the antics between his future wife and brother. They were truly like brother and sister, always picking on one another, and starting petty arguments. They acted like Steve remembered Bucky and his sister Rebecca’s relationship.
