So after a lot of instruction from Braes (Who still doesn't know that Steven used to be a healer, he has to, or he would have died at the hands of Hydra king a long time ago), and glaring darkly ordering him to rest and not do anything (Mainly directing his glare at the foolish king, who looked sick and tired, not that Steven cared about him or anything). Steven was finally released to go home, or as much as you can call it home with it being your prison and the place of this idiot king.
"Can I touch you?" Steve asked just to be sure, and he can see the irritate in Tony's eyes at Steve, probably thinking that Steve doesn't want him, or something of that line, which Steve has his work cut for him to convince him otherwise.
"Then why is the small fella here is complaining? You are eating for two now, you can't skip your meals! Look at the poor baby!" Angie glared at him, causing Tony to pout when he heard Rhodey and Pepper start laughing behind their hands, uncaring about the glare send their way by a flushed Tony. "Anyway… does the baby have a gender yet, or am I waiting until the birth to know?" Angie asked, turning the conversation one-eighty, nearly causing Tony's head to spin.
In the end, Tony was left with too many loose ends and too many 'What ifs'; he was left with too many questions and not enough answers to them. With that, Tony finally decided enough was enough and he left the house, planning on interrogating and threatening people until he finally got the answers he wanted and needed; answers that would decide what Tony's next step would be.
"Hey…" Steve whispered to the man when he saw him awake and blinking, his eyes taking in the room with wonder. "Here, drink this; hopefully it will lessen the pain." Steve said as he took a seat near the Alpha, raising the coffee mug from the tray to give it to James, whose eyes never left Steve, even when Steve helped him to sit down and put the mug in his hands. "James?" Steve tilted his head which made the man blink his head and turn to his mug, taking a small sip while letting out a breath of relief at the taste. "Do you prefer cold or hot compress?" Steve asked, thinking that it will be better if he asked the man what he thinks, after all, the Omega didn't want to do more harm than good and trigger and even stronger migraine.
Stane raised his head and start word-vomiting, he talked about his work with SI and how he used to sell weapons in the black markets without anyone knowing, how he hired some of Hydra's agents from time to time to do his bedding, he talked about Tony and the kidnapping, when Steve told him to go into details Stane froze in fear, but Steve's snarl made him talk, he talks about the torture and starvation, how Tony always fought and refused to submit, about him actually being able to break the bones and defeat a few of his minions, and nearly being able to escape a few times if they didn't act fast, he talked about Tony's one and only heat that happened four years ago, him falling pregnant, Stane using his voice, how the Omega stopped resisting Stane and slept with him willingly if it meant Stane will give him a little bit more food or some clothes for the baby, who was born in August. Stane talked so much that he didn't realize that Steve's face turns dark and hateful the longer he talked, he didn't feel the room temperature drop drastically and the scent of ice that always surrounded Steve sharpened.
," Steven stated, his lips twitching into a soft smile when he saw the relief in the older man's eye. "Last time we saw you, my mother threatened you with castration if you died in the sea… it is a relief that you ended up heeding her words." Steven offered, his words banishing the last of the Alpha's doubts and causing a smile to twitch on the Alpha's lips.
"Hey there, Pete…" Tony called out as he walked toward the pup hugging him tightly, which made the boy purr happily and snuggle into Tony's chest. It will be easy… Tony just has to pull a few strands of Peter's hair and then he will know, it was easy, he could even ask the pup and the boy will jump at the idea, thinking that it was nothing but a school project, it was so easy… but Tony found himself too frozen to even do it.
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, a little bit of sadness, a little bit of violence, maybe fluff, Tony being mean, and poor Steve! All reviews are appreciated.
"No… no, it's not that, I just… well, my Ma still hounds me about asking you out and shit, and I am just thinking if I should run away and leave you with my Ma or something…" Bucky said with an embarrassment which made Tony blink a little at that and shook his head.
The whimper seemed to increase when Tony reached the last box, which made Tony's smile widen even more as he kneeled down and opened the box, hoping to see a dying animal or something. What Tony didn't expect though, was him finding a baby… a baby… a child? Whatever, it was a squirming small human being.
The Omega bites his lips to stop his wide smile from widening even more, but that was already a lost cause as the Omega was already grinning like a loon. It ended with Tony going to the bathroom to regroup, taking a nice long cold shower to calm his flush down a few pages before going outside and embarrassing himself in from of the Alpha. By the time he was finished with his shower, Steve and Peter were already finished with their morning routine, the Alpha taking it as his mission to wash his baby's face and brush his teeth and hair… caring for his baby like he was the Alpha's own always made Tony curl in pleasure and relief, the Alpha was already taking the first step to being Peter's
it was usually followed by an uncomfortable silence as whoever caught sight of him tried to run away from here, either run to the town or run away from the town.
"Aw, don't be like that, love!" Steve cooed, causing Tony to growl and turn to the man, planning on giving Steve a few hits on the head, maybe that will give Steve his mind back; Tony wondered how Rogers survived the forties with that kind of attitude, didn't they use to burn witches alive in those times?
Anton, on the other hand, stood still, his eyes were wide, and whatever amusement he felt not a few seconds ago vanished as he leaned on the tree behind him wondering if what he heard was right and that the person beside Steven was asking the Omega to court him. "Wow, is this the best I can get out of you?" Steven chuckled, the light tone the Omega used made Anton narrow his eyes and lean a little trying to see the man who was asking the Omega courting him. "Fine, I accept." Anton's eyes widen even more at the acceptance, and he nearly left his hidden place behind the tree and march toward the Omega, demanding an explanation for this. "What are your conditions and what kind of dowry are you demanding, first of all?" Was the queen insane? Anton wanted to scream wondering why the queen would accept marriage when he was a widow for only a few months, but he was also marrying one of the Christians he protected while paying for a dowry without silver to his name or a witness! (5)
Tony whimpered as he tried to stand on his shaky legs, letting out a cry of pain when his left leg gave out of him; taking deep and shaky breaths, Tony let out a huffed breath as he hoppled toward the lake hoping that by some miracle Rogers was still here and wasn't angry at Tony for his display hours ago.
"Please stop! Hurt…." Tony let out a sob, shivering in pain and fear as more voices assaulted him, not letting him catch his breath. Sitting on the white nothing under him, Tony shiver as he held himself tightly, trying to block the voices that nearly split his eardrums with their constant chatters and orders and screams. Suddenly there was silence… louder than the words that were screamed in Tony's ears, causing Tony to shiver and look around him terror rising in his heart when he realizes he was alone…
"So where were you, Steve? We came and were told that you are out for work-related things." Ben said as he came and put his arm around May's shoulders which made the Beta smile happily at him and turn to Steve who had a feral smile on his face, which kind of made Ben blink a little at that a shiver going down his spine.
Whatever Tony wanted to say next was frozen in his throat when his eyes fell on the person that caught Pepper's sight and did he caught Tony's sight too? There was Steve, heading toward them wearing a light suit that brought the color of his eyes. "Hey, Tony, Pepper." Steve smiled nervously when he reached them, not that Tony manages to return his greeting he was shocked speechless to say anything.
"Peter!" Tony cried out as he rushed toward his son and Steve, this time Peggy and Bucky let go of him; not that Tony would have cared, he would have rushed toward his son no matter what. Reaching the two, Tony pulled both Steve and Peter into his embrace, something that he will think about later. "You are alive, you are alive, oh, God, oh, God." Tony sobbed as he pulled the two of them tightly into his embrace, ignoring the embarrassment that wanted to make itself known, and just take in his baby, who looked a little ruffled but overall fine.
After that he spent all the time he has watching Midgard, learning everything he can about the man, he learned that his name was Anton, and the place he lived in was Greece, it was strange place Anton's Greece, it was a brutal place, but at the same time it was beautiful, he learned that Anton was what they called an inventor and a philosopher, that people always whisper when he passed them calling him crazy, it was probably why he didn't have any wife or children… why he was always alone…
A small burst of childish giggle came from behind the door, causing the woman's breath to leave her in a rush, her eyes widen even more as the past came to embrace her once more, causing her to suffocate. In and out, in and out… the woman whispered inside her mind as she finally managed to calm down, raising her shaky hand and knocking on the door, wondering how foolish and stupid she was to return back to this house after all these years.
"I think you already know why I am here Officer Fury, so cut the chase, what do you know about Steven Rogers and this town?" Tony asked, irritation coloring his voice as he glared at the man sitting in front of him. Tony was a little unease with how uncaring Fury was, but at the same time it made him relax a little, with the way he was acting, Fury was unlikely to sing Steven Rogers praises and look at him like he was a God on earth.
That what was written, that was what made his blood run cold, what made him nearly throw up, that was what made his jump from his place and run out of the room toward Peggy, what made him ride his bike and move on top speed. He didn't know how many laws he broke after he reached Shield HQ, but he was sure he nearly causes a few road accidents. Steve didn't care, after leaving his bike he ran to Peggy's office like the hounds of hell after him, he ignores Natasha and Clint, he pushed Fury out of the way, he nearly throws Coulson down the stairs for God's sake!
"So you were a Demi, right?" Tony asked which made the man nodded his head. "But you met him when he was forty, right? He was still young and I am sure he wouldn't have minded having sex." Tony pointed out which made Steven laugh at that, count on Tony to say it as he sees it.
Steve's lips trembled as he tried to give Tony a reassuring smile; the smile though did nothing but break what's left of Tony's heart, because the smile was resigned one like Steve already knows that it was late saving him and that he was dying soon leaving Peter and Tony alone…
"Steve… honey… there is someone here to see you…" Natasha's calm and soft voice caused Steve to blink his eyes tiredly and turns to look at the woman, his mind was still miles and miles away, that's why Steve needed a few minutes to understand what his friends said to him. Natasha's words made Steve furrow his brows, wondering who came all the way to see him when Steve made sure to reject any call he got.
"Oh shut up, don't you realize that we have someone who never saw a movie in his life with us? Do you want a repeat of what Thor did when his first movie was 'Mama'?" Tony questioned, causing everyone to flinch at the reminder of how Thor nearly destroyed the Avengers' tower the first time they watched that movie together.
"Oh yeah, great, excellent; we are just going to tell Steve who is a self-sacrificing idiot by the way; that Thanos is on the move and is planning on making him his bride. Steve will love learning that Thanos will kill him and rip his heart because Steve refuses to shackle with that crazy purple grape!" Tony hissed, his nerves getting frazzled the more he remembered how much beating Steve took for refusing Thanos. He still remembers Steve's heart being ripped out of the star's chest, shining faintly as Thanos swallowed it.
Steve remembered how he met Tony years ago, how the two of them met by chance because of Natasha; Steve remembered the way Tony gazed at him, with wide eyes full of interest and a dropped jaw. At that time, such a thing had made Steve very uncomfortable; being fresh out of college and having spent years and years surrounded by uncaring cold Alphas who only wanted him for something or another, it was hard being around an Alpha who acted... differently.
"Tony loves white roses." That was the only thing he said, as he gave the rose to Steve, which made Steve smile at the older man.
So finally after a lot of argument and agreement, Tony and Rhodey finally started working. When Tony and Rhodey started working they started by installing the cameras and the sensors outside of the house, mainly the front of the house and the backyard near the woods. Tony didn't know why, but when he installed the cameras he made sure that they weren't pointing at the lake; it was absurd, it was insane, but it seemed that part of Tony still wasn't ready to break the illusion of the lake being Tony's save haven. So Tony turned the cameras away even when Rhodey grumbled at him and tried to adjust the cameras for the tenth time (Only for Tony to pointed them away when Rhodey wasn't looking)
Tony hummed to himself, letting out a happy sigh as he stretched his body, giving a faint purr at the way his body tingled pleasantly, reminding him of what took a place last night. Shuffling closer to the big source of warmth, Tony let a smile stretch his lips when he picked up his husband's scent mingled with his. Finally daring to open his eyes, Tony bit his bottom lip to stop a mad grin from splitting his face when his eyes fell on the Alpha sharing his bed.
"That's when you are the wrong Commander; you see the assist is a few minutes from fierce heat, and when it arrives, the assist has every right to restrain you and do anything he wishes, think of it as a… reward, for serving us faithfully for seventy years." Steven pauses at those words his fury increasing every moment that passes, and he realizes that any time now, he will certainly lose it, and when he does no one will escape this place alive. "If you think that you have it in you to force him away, think again, we will make certain his discipline will be worse than yours, isn't that right, Sargent Barnes?" Zola questioned with a nasty grin, his sharply stare, making Bucky raise his unsteady hands to draw his mask off, letting it clang on the ground.
Steve shiver at that and turn his attention to the Omega and pup, the pup who had the smell of death surrounding him, the pup who was too small that Steve would have mistaken him as two years old, the pup who was scrunching his nose like he was about to wake up… that made Steve's breath nearly leave him as he saw the pup blinks tiredly. "Mama…" The kid muttered, trying to wake the Omega, Steve swallowed at that and he gasped softly as the pup raises his head toward him. "C-Cap…?" The kid stuttered, raising his hand toward Steve, he didn't know what took over him, but Steve took the child's small hand in his, which only made the kid tear up. "You are 'ere…" The kid sniffed, looking at the Silver Star that dominates the front of Steve's suit.
"OK, enough! That's it, no one has the right to choose any movie, and not when you broke so many essential rules tonight!" Tony huffed, causing everyone to groan, whining about how unfair Tony was, which the shorter man ignore. "Steve." Tony called out, causing the confused and overwhelmed man who was sitting on the love seat to raise his head, looking like a dear caught in a headlight. "Considering that this is the first movie night you experience and the first movie night we host in months, you have the right to choose any movie you like, just keep it PG." Tony stated, glaring at everyone, daring them to say otherwise, which thankfully they didn't, they just grumbled and went back to their seats as they waited for the movie that Steve will choose.
"That's not true, listen to me Steve please!" Bucky begged as he followed the Omega out of the kitchen Peter was in the living room watching National Geography, too interested in the science show he was seeing to turn to his mother and Bucky. "Look, everything happens, it was because of Howard, that bastard sent Tony away to get rid of you then he lied to him saying you demand money from him and blackmail him, it caused Tony mental break down when he knew about this today, he was about to kill his father today if it wasn't for his mother, Steve are you even listening to me?" Bucky begged when both he and Steve reached the Omega's room, Bucky prayed that Steve will listen but knowing the Omega that was impossible.
Steve sighed as he continued his walk through the supermarket, frowning as he put a few things in his cart before continued his way. It was so stupid, it was so insane, and Steve in all of this was hurt; part of Steve couldn't help but think that this is it, that Tony will finally say enough is enough and leave Steve. It did nothing but cause Steve to panic every night, wondering what would he do when Tony left, wondering what would he tell his daughter when she asked about her father and why he doesn't want them, Steve wondered how he would overcome the heartache that would refuse to let him go. The only thing that Steve was thankful about was that Tony, even with their seven years of being together, never once gave him his bonding mark, even after three years of marriage; the only silver lining here is that Steve won't suffer the bonding sickness when Tony decided to leave.
"I… I'm not him…" Tony finally said, he didn't even know when he gained the courage to finally say those words that plagued him for a long time now, and when Steven tilted his head in confusion Tony took it as his chance to explain. "I'm not the person you always think of me as, I'm not Anton, whoever that way, I'm Anthony Edward Stark, I'm not him." Tony really hoped that his explanation will stick in Steven's head this time; he hoped that Steven will realize that he wasn't Anton, whoever that fella who made Steven hates him for no reason.
"Loki!" Thor snarled as he took a threatening step toward his unfazed brother, which made Tony tense and stand in front of Steve protectively. "I swear on the Norns themselves that if this is another one of your mischievous tricks, I will throw you from the Bifrost bridge this time!" Thor growled his fists were clenched tightly and his eyes were alight with thunder, sparking and threatening as they took Loki in.
Tony returned a little after eight, humming to himself and singing under his breath, a big smile making itself known as he took careful steps going toward his home. He was already planning on spending a little time on the boat but he knows that he can't today,
"J.A.R.V.I.S. ignore her and take me to Howard Stark." Steve mocked her which made the woman's face flush at that and for her face to become red in anger but the ping and the voice coming from above made them stop.
"Yeah, maybe I should give Goddess Frigga offerings in hope of finding someone I will not hate and end up killing by the end of the year." Grunt Anton, frowning at the metal that was of no use to him now that it has cool and took a strange shape. "I just have to bear the Stone clan staying here until the end of the Winter, after that I will try and search for someone." Anton start, throwing the metal far away in the workshop, planning to work something out with the metal later.
"No, but I saw your handy work." Steven said snidely. "So where are we going? The cells?" Steven asked which made Odin look at him with a sharp look on his face, causing Steven to smile savagely. "Am I going to find Loki's mouth sewn shut, to stop him from telling 'lies'?" That made Frigga inhale sharply and look at Steven with horror at his words.
"What if I refuse? After all, you are just a stranger who broke into my house and start waving his gun at me, if my husband found out…" Tony gritted through his teeth, trying desperately to buy enough time to think of a plan that will save his baby from this monster before he hurt her.
Today though, Tony was not going to be a spoilsport about his family watching him like a hawk, he is just going to smile and have fun and spoil both of his babies… especially with it being Peter's birthday, the pup has finally become eleven years old! Just thinking about his baby growing up caused both happiness and sadness to take hold of him. Happiness because his baby was growing up healthy, happy, and loved by his parents, siblings, and friends; sadness because his baby would end up leaving their home when he is all grown up.
"But Tony! It could make an amazing present for everyone back home! We can even make it our pet if you refuse to eat it!" Steve said, and Tony's jaw dropped as he saw the shark flinch and flip around like crazy, trying desperately to dry itself fast so it would drop dead faster. The whispers and panicked shouts Tony was hearing made him twitch and a frown took over his face, especially when the shark seemed to turn white… well whiter… by the second.
Tony waited until he was five months before telling their friends (Being amazed and thankful for his husband's shirt for hiding his small bump) one of the reasons for that was because he was scared that this was a dream; he wanted to make sure that the baby was really here with him before telling everyone. The second reason was that Tony doesn't know how his friends would react to him planning on having another child; trying to adopt Harley after a month of marriage was mind-blowing as it is, what would they say when they knew about Tony being pregnant with another child?
' over and over again, causing Tony to stiffen a gasp and rush toward the boy, thinking that the boy hurt himself by stepping on the shared of the glass lettering the ground. "Harley, baby, tell me what's wrong?" Tony whispered his picking the boy up and put him on the couch checking for injuries and being grateful when he found none.
Any why not living near a friendly lake monster? The monster seemed to only hate bullies, he doesn't hurt anyone, and Tony didn't hear about anyone getting hurt. Maybe the monster doesn't even exist and that everything happened was just the fault of those teenagers who liked to terrorize people, the ones that Fury finally caught.
An Omega with his back to the door wearing old tattered clothes, that Steve wonders how they didn't fall off of him from how thin he was, Steve swallow and enters the room rushing to the Omega… the Omega was as pale as the walls around him, with a long and tangled hair that reached past his shoulder. Steve froze as he saw the Omega's empty eyes staring on the walls, curling around himself holding a pup… a pup that couldn't have been older than three years old, a too-small pup with a too-big shirt and pale skin and a scent of sickness and death surrounding him… the Omega didn't pay him any mind, he just continued to hold the pup and sing softly, not caring if someone was there with him… not seeing that there was someone with him...
Bruce shiver as he wrote in his notebook, gulping in fear as he wrote what could possibly be his will; his mind going over and over the near-death experience all of his friends suffered because they decided to come between Steve and his love interest, which turned out to be Tony. Now Bruce wasn't one who will get annoying at something and try to sabotage it like how his friends decided to do, Bruce was the kind who will stay quiet and watch when it was going to end and how, see his chances and take the best one to move; with how things are going Bruce was glad that he never made his move, he was so glad that he wasn't an idiot enough to paint a target on his back like how his friends did with their idiotic actions.
Tony stood up then turn around and start walking out of the café, he could hear his father calling out to him, rushing to catch up to him. Tony paused a little waiting for the lights to turn red to cross the road, ignoring his father's calls of his name. When the lights turn red and all the cars stopped, Tony start crossing the road.
"Start using it after Afghanistan, because of this." Tony taped at the covered Arc-Reactor which made the Omega look at him in confusion before shaking his head. "Tell me, Steve…" Tony finally dared to talk after the awkward pause that fell on them. "Is there a chance that the two of us can make things right again?" Tony looked at his feet hearing Steve sighing at that.
"Don't you dare listen to them Stark!" Steve suddenly screamed which made everyone's eyes widen at that, especially Tony whose heart nearly stopped when he saw the man beside Steve snarl and put the gun at his temple while giving him a threatening look as he pulled his hair harshly. "You do this and everything will be over between us!" Steve suddenly freed his arms from behind him and jumped at the Rumlow, the two of them rolled outside of the camera's view… It was chaos with Peter's terror-filled screams as he called for Steve as the Omega fought the man, it was only a few minutes later that they heard a gun firing and then… silence…
Steve also met Clint Barton, twenty, and an ex-mercenary and a new Shield agent that was the reason for them finding about Hydra… well, he was able to change the mind of a Russian assassin and made her join them and give the information? Steve was able to meet the woman, Natalia Romanov, a red hair assassin. When Steve entered the holding cell she was in… he and the others were met with insults in Russian, Steve was sure that the teen (Because that's what she really was, just a teenager of seventeen) didn't think that any one of them knows Russian… but Steve surprise her, and surprise everyone in the room because he starts interrogating the teen in fluent Russian right away… no one needs to know that Bucky's mother was Russian immigrated that taught him Russian because she missed home…
"A present? Are you serious? Six years with no word on your side other than threats and you dare to come into my home after nearly attacking my husband with a present?" Steve sneered, his hands clenching into fists, causing Tony to put his hand on the Alpha's shoulder, hoping to ground him and calm him down; the action didn't go unnoticed by Carter, for the woman scowled harshly when she saw Tony, only for her to still in her place when she finally caught the sight of his belly.
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, sadness, confusion, a little bit of violence, Steven being an overprotective AF, and Tony is a little shit! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
Maybe this was Tony's way of apologizing? Granted Steve would have said yes as soon as Tony said sorry, it was still sweet of Tony to send him this note. Maybe it was Steve's fault as it was Tony's; admittedly, ever since the pregnancy was confirmed, Steve and Tony spent their time pushing each other away than spending their precious time together as they should.
"Steve!" Tony cried out as he pulled Steve from his kneeling position and holding him, causing Steve to swallow and for his lips to wobble; stupid Tony! Didn't he realize that he had endangered himself? That Thanos would kill him? That Peter would grow up without his father for the stupid stunt Tony pulled?
The superstitions of Medieval times hit badly on twins. So logically, giving birth to twins, was evidence of adultery. Either the mother lets one of the babies disappears, or gets punished for having sex with another man out of wedlock. The twins were also considered a bad omen, mainly the issue of who will be the heir and the head of the family. That's why Steve lost James's twin; if you reread through the last sentence of Steve losing his child once more, you will notice that he died by burning. Steve having twins was also a tightly kept secret that no one but a few knows about. Also the reason that Steve blame Tony for the twin's death, was because the Johann didn't care about the twin until he lost the battle to Tony!
The A.I. was cut so sudden that Steve couldn't help but hold his breath, the whimper Peter let out made Steve want to growl, and maybe he did, but no sound get out of his throat. "
Tony shuddered as Steve let out a pleasant noise and deepened the kiss, three weeks after the day Tony kissed Steve, the two of them start kissing like their lives depending on it, not a day past without the two of them sharing a hundred of kisses, and Tony was grateful, he was so grateful that Steve was accepting him back into his and Peter's life, even if it was slowly, the Alpha was grateful that he will have his family back one day…
"Tony…" Howard gave a small smile holding a present box in his hands, the older Alpha looked tired, so tired, like he aged a hundred years old since the last time tony saw him, he doesn't look like the sixty years old man that he was, Tony can see his older man shift uncomfortably, probably didn't know how to act around him, he can also see the self-conscious smile, and the tiredness in his eyes made Tony's heart give a painful pang. "My flight was delayed, sorry for coming late." Howard offered as an olive branch, his smile slipping when he noticed Tony's shocked face, and he probably took it for something else if the distressed look in his eyes was anything to go by. "I was late, wasn't I?" Howard asked in a small voice, which snapped Tony out of his shock.
"It's OK, I forgive you… I know you want the best for Steve and that's why you did what you did, I would have probably done the same thing if I was you." Tony gave Sarah a reassuring smile, hoping that the woman will feel better, he really wanted her to know that Tony forgave her, that he didn't hold this against her, he knows what's it like to always worry about your baby and wishing the best for him, he knows that he may have acted like her with overprotectiveness if he had the chance to meet his baby ten years ago, or if his baby survived his death.
It took time before they were finally back into the king's home, which was something Anton dreaded ever since the queen had become suspiciously still, not thrashing and moving like he did when he faced Tyber. "You can leave now; I will handle the rest… and tell Magna to bring Petrus and James back," Anton ordered, hoping that he didn't do something stupid and that the queen won't stab him with a knife as soon as they are to be alone.
As soon as Peter smelled that Steve was close he whined and tried to twist around, hand outstretches in the Alpha's direction which made the Alpha croon gently to the pup and walks toward the pup, looking at Tony asking for permission before taking the pup in his arms humming gently when Tony allowed him to hold the pup rocking the pup back and forth whispering that it was OK until the pup calmed down. "The reporter took a picture of Peter." Tony's voice cracked as he said that looking at his son who was snuggling into Steve.
They chatted with Angie for a while before they finish, Tony went to the counter to deal with the bill; only to have Angie glaring at him like a disappointed mother and telling him that everything was on the house, pushing a foil of wrapped food toward him with a threatening look on her face that caused even Pepper and Rhodey to shift in their places. "Thank you." Tony whispered, taking in the bag that Angie handed to him with a shy smile, knowing that he can't win against Angie no matter how much he put his mind into it, he tried to ignore how Pepper and Rhodey were smiling smugly, happiness radiating from their expressions.
"Can I help you, sir?" A voice asked making Tony blink his eyes, he turns toward the person who spoke only to see an African-American male, from his scent he was a Beta and a concern one at that as he looked at Tony who was spacing with worry and a little bit of suspicion.
"Stop in your advance Omega." Howard snapped, using his voice, which made everyone freeze and looks at the Alpha with dropped jaws, it was true that using Alpha voice wasn't prohibited by law, but it was frowned upon, people were even sure that the law will prohibit its use by the end of the year, and Howard just used his carelessly.
"Brookland… Brookland was destroyed a year before the Beta's capture." The king whispered, trying to calm Steven as he ran gentle hands on his clenched fists; his soft words and action didn't stop his words from piercing Steven's heart and causing him pain, at the lie the Beta gave him when he told him about Brookland still standing. "That was the reason we rage war on the Hydra kingdom because they destroyed our home. The Beta only brought information, he sower on Odin's rule that he stole them; there was no child with him, nor did I found the letter you said was within the scrolls." The king gazed at the Omega in front of him in concern, probably wondering if he should call the healer when Steven looked like a doll that was ripped from the seams.
Tony glanced at Harley, wanting to see the boy's reaction to the news, what Tony didn't expect to see was the trembling lips and the clenched fists in his lap as the boy tried to hide. "Harley, sweetheart, is something wrong?" Tony asked, passing Peter to Steve before standing up, going toward the boy who nearly flinched when Tony came near him.
The cruel smile that took over the king's face made everyone's breath hitch, even Loki and Thor, the fierce warriors became as quiet as mice as they waited for the punishment that will befall Hamar. "A slave you say?" The humor in the Alpha's voice, scared even the strongest warrior there was, one thing was known in every place in their world, the Iron King was a volatile entity, one second he could be your best friend, smiling, joking, showering you with gifts, the next he will turn into your worst nightmare as he stabs you in the heart; he wasn't called the Merchant of Death for nothing. "Then do tell, Hamar, did you see the marks of a slave on the Omega?" Starkad cooed, his words made everyone still as their eyes widen even more if that was possible, even the advisors and the king's friends, they weren't immune to the shock.
Steve sighed at that and dry washed his face looking at the counter before swallowing. "His mother was an Omega and she... she…" Steve ended up saying couldn't continue his words, which made Tony inhale sharply, working in the Omegas clinic and group therapy, Tony heard a lot of stories, and it broke his heart to say he heard a lot of sad stories, one of them the reason why some pups fear specific dynamics, he never thought Peter was one of them.
"I think… I think I made an unforgivable mistake…" Anton murmured, gazing at Jamti who was tilting his head to the side the look on his fellow Alpha's face informed Anton that Jamti is expecting Anton to tell him what he did. Anton could only wince at that, wondering what Jamti would do after he explained the situation to him; he didn't have to wait long, because, by the end of his explanation, Jamti's eyes were so wide that Anton wondered how they didn't jump out of his head.
Steve frown as his gaze fell on the envelope; Steve couldn't help but blink his eyes, a little surprised and confused, wondering from where did the envelop came. Steve was sure he shut and locked the doors and windows when he got out of the car; he was sure that when he went to see Natasha there was no envelope in the car, unlike now.
"Coming!" Tony called out as he opened the door, smiling when he saw Bucky and Peggy on the other side, holding boxes of takeout with them. It was then that Tony knew, that he will become fat from Angie's delicious cooking. "Hello." Tony waved toward Peggy and Bucky, letting them come through.
That made everyone looks at the ceiling in surprise at the words. "What do you mean by that buddy, I am sure my word overrides everyone, besides this, isn't the first time you met Steve?" Tony said as he looked at the ceiling, with narrow eyes, heart pounding in his chest at the possibility of Steve meeting his AI before.
"I said get them out! Out, out, out of here!" Tony scream and shouted the doctors and nurses rush into the room, at that sight, Tony started screaming loudly, which ends up by having the doctors sedating him. He continued to scream and plead with Steve to get everyone out, it left Steve shocked and frozen, and he could fell the heartbreak rolling from everyone at that. What Steve hated the most was when Tony starts crying when Steve didn't do as he asked…
"Cut the acting, we both know that you are not a slave, just as the two of us knows that you will not break and go back on your deal; I am tired of this cat and mouse chase, so just… enough." The king groan, his words made Steven press his lips together tightly, making a pale line with his mouth; this was the closest that the foolish king came to admit that Steven was not a slave or a servant, or the king wouldn't have given him so many liberties.
"How 'Slim' are we talking?" Tony asked in a hollow voice, feeling drained and tired and so many other things, like the weight of the world is on his shoulder, crushing him with every whimper and cry from his mate; why? Just why wasn't he the one who took the hit of the poison, why was it Steve? Why is it always Steve?
Glaring, Steven's hands twitched several times as he tried to calm the fire that roared inside his body; he tried to stop himself from picking the first thing his eyes fell on and breaking it into tiny pieces. A prostitute! The nerve! Alphas were so full of themselves, always thinking that a genuine offer of friendship meant more than what it really was. Foolish brute, uncultured Alpha! As if Steven was ever going to bed someone so brutish and feral, a bastard with no regard for Omegas and their feelings! Steven would kill himself than bed someone like the foolish king, even if he was the last Alpha in this damn land!
"You are anything but helpless." Anton huffed, his words gaining him a genuine smile that went as fast as it came, which made the Alpha shuffle in his place, not knowing how to act in this awkward conversation. "What are you doing here? I thought that cold weathers like this are not that good for Omegas." At least that's what Braes told Anton, something about the cold messing up with heat-cycle or something, but the queen seemed to be enjoying the cold just fine, and by the look of it, the queen didn't even bring his fur coat with him or anything.
Steve sighed at that thought and get out of his car smiling at the irony that flying cars do exist in the far away future, he walked toward his and Tony's home, the two of them did end up living in the Avengers HQ with Steve training new recruits with the help of Peter Parker, the man who was like a son to him and Tony.
That left Tony, Steve, Thor, and Clint… no scratch that, it left only Tony and Steve because not a few seconds after Natasha disappeared, Clint went after her like a lost puppy. Thor, on the other hand, sends Tony a threatened glare before he stood up, and going to bed, something about needing to check on the progress of the Bifrost by doing some handy wavy magic that will transport his Astral form to Asgard.
"Oh my God! May I am so happy for you!" Steve laughed happily as he went to hug the Beta, getting a tight hug, and a small laugh in return as the woman pulled him tightly toward her. "So when I am going to see my nephew?" Steve asked teasingly as he let go of May, a huge grin taking over his face as he looked at the woman who was glowing with happiness.
…" Steve purred, causing Tony to let out a dumb 'Huh?' as he gazed at the scariest assassin in the world… just how?
That day Steve held his screaming and crying son as the doctor did test after test, it ends up with Steve having to hold his tears as his son whine and begged him to go home that he will be a good boy and eat his food. In the end one of the doctors sat him down, his son was with May, who was trying to calm the squirming Pup with a toy she brought for him that replicas of the Iron Man helmet and glove, it was a famous toy in the markets right now, and his son had calmed a little as he wore the glove and moved his hand around acting like he was shooting.
Tony then start humming in boredom, looking around the place with a thoughtful look on his face, wondering if he should decorate the place or not, he did give a few comment to the sleeping man, complaining all the while about Rogers. "What did he do this time?" Came the sleep-filled voice, which made Tony jump and let out a squeak he will deny letting out for the rest of his life.
"You are a star…" Loki let his breath rushed out of him at the realization that a star saved him a celestial being older than the time that never involved themselves in the affairs of mortals and immortals alike, beings that write the history since the beginning of time, ones that can grant immortality 'Whoever possessed a star's heart shall be granted immortality' his mother used to say, the last person to possess a star heart was six thousand years ago, shooting a star out of the sky and ribbing it's heart, for such treason and disrespect he was killed brutally, after that, Odin collected all ancient scribes of how to summon stars and burned them in Muspelheim's fires. "Oh Ancient one, thank you for your generosity, I am forever in your debt." Loki said bowing a little, after all, it was an honor to have a star look upon you and guide you, let alone save you, and Loki knows that he will forever be indebted to the star until he deemed that he paid the debt.
Reaching his house, never felt like a death sentence until now, probably because his mind loved torturing him and remind him that the only reason he even bought it was for his baby to grow up in a nice place, not a penthouse in Manhattan or his father's mansion, always big and empty and made Tony felt like he was the only one in the world without someone there for him. Tony let out a sigh as he forced himself to enter the house, hoping against hope that Pepper and her daughter had left, just so that Tony can cry in peace.
Knowing this, made the Avengers rush in their preparation they had been doing for the past three years, and with the help of the Ancient One and the Asgardian warriors, they were finally prepared to face Thanos. This time they were prepared, and they were able to finally defeat Thanos before he even collected the first infinity stone, but it came with a price, in the last battle between Steven and Thanos, Steven was wounded fatally that he falls into a coma.
Rogers did nothing but try to express his love in a creepy kind of way, harmless to Tony, yes, to others? Sadly no, but still, everyone lived in the end even with a few scares to go through. Tony was fifty/fifty percent sure that if he had calmly sat Rogers and explained to him that he wasn't interested in him, the man will understand. Going into that line of thought made him feel like scum and made Tony 100% sure that he needed to apologize to Steve.
Tony couldn't help but lean on the pillow behind him taking everything in, his mind going over what was happening and convincing himself that he was losing his marbles. "I am losing my mind… I am losing my mind and talking to a… a…" Tony couldn't even finish his words, feeling that if he finished this sentence then he was admitting that he was insane.
The creature stopped grumbling when he felt a hand taking hold of the wet pants he was wearing; the action caused the creature to tense and let out a threatening hiss as he turned to the boy who dared to touch him. The creature paused when he noticed that the boy was still in fact asleep and that the boy's hand seeks the creature unconsciously. That made the creature send the boy an annoying look, and turn away, refusing to gaze at the boy's tired face and shivering form, that start shivering violently as the air around them became colder and colder. With one last glance, the creature untangled the boy's hand away from him, turning to the edge of the boat.
"Anthony…" The low voice behind him made him tense and for the hair on his body to stand on its ends, and he then turns to the person who called him, putting his back to the wall while putting the suitcase in front of him, protecting his midsection, heart pounding in his throat when he saw his mother's blank eyes looking at him, as much as the younger man wanted to talk to her, hoping to be able to sway her into taking his side, he knows that she will never do it, after all, how will she chose her idiotic son's side, her son who destroyed his life by falling pregnant (Even if he was forced without his consent) destroying a perfect arranged marriage with his father's business partner before it even happened.
The gentle hand that ran along his back as they rise toward his head and removed the pillow, the different scent that wasn't his mother but meant a family, all the same, the soft and calm voice that shushed him as it crooned to him, made Peter let out a whine at that, turning to see the Alpha that he has been waiting for the whole night, sitting on the edge of his bed, looking at the pup with a tired smile. "… You didn't come…" Peter's voice cracked as he said those words, causing the Alpha to give a sad smile, his eyes were glassy.
Unfortunately for Tony, life was never fair to Tony, fairness was out of play ever since Tony was ten years old and Jarvis died… anyway, out of the pity party Tony threw himself into; at this moment Tony was in one of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s meeting rooms, getting his head hammered by Fury and the PR personas for the stunt he pulled at his birthday-ball… so what if Tony was engaged to Steve? It's no one's business but his! Right at this moment, Fury took it as his business to go on and on about how reckless Tony was by making his relationship with one of the Addams family public and exposing Steve's identity of being the original Captain America/the former Winter Soldier in the process.
"This is the first time you refer to him as a son, quite the upgrade don't you think?" Steven said as he walked around Odin and continued on his way, finally seeing Thor who was getting out of his room with a fresh and clean set of clothes. "Thor, where is Loki?" Steven asked sharply which made the thundered jump a little and pointed to the door in front of him which made Steven nod his head at that and went to the door, knocking on it in three sharp knocks before opening the door, seeing Loki sitting in the small chair in his room, chains surrounding his legs and arms. "Loki." Steven said as he felt Odin and the rest of the party behind him stop inside of the room.
"If I last recall, foolish king, I was nothing but a slave, giving me a room like this surely will make people talk." Steven stated, trying desperately not to yawn and inform the king how wound up from the short walk he was; if it continued like this, Steven would have to enter the forest to find his own medicine, one that doesn't cause him to sleep.
"So then, talk!" Serpentine smiled sharply as she said these words, putting a few huge ice-cream tubs in front of Tony, part of Tony wanted to run away to the hills, ignoring the ice-cream that was no doubt poison with something, but Tony know if he ran away now, he will do nothing but anger the ghost who was floating in front of him with a chocolate ice-cream (With spiders sprinkled on top of it...Ewww!).
"He refused to see your birth, and then was hated by the others for not approving you to be the king." Bucky finally spoke, filling the blank page that Thor couldn't do, his words made everyone blink at that, a mix of shock and disbelieve about how someone can be hated for centuries because he refused to gaze at a woman who was screaming her head off as she pushed a child out of her body.
It was only a minute or so before Pepper's eyes widened as she made heads and tails of the weird shit Tony word-vomited to her and when she did, her face paled. "Are you crazy?" Pepper screamed as she jumped from her chair, walking toward the man with threatening steps, which Tony was grateful for the armor as it was going to protect him from the woman's rage, "You housed an Addams in your house? An Addams? Those crazy sorceresses that live in the cemeteries? What were you even thinking?" The woman screamed as she turned her wild eyes at the poor man who was cowering in his place.
The soft noise that slipped from Tony was embarrassing, his face turned red, but the gentle smile Steve sends his way was worth it, it made his heart beat with desire and hunger. Tony brought a hand up to touch Steve's cheek, to keep him steady as he leaned up to kiss the star. They stand in the middle of the dance floor, kissing over and over again until finally, they both have to breathe. Tony never felt like this before, and he ignored the murmurs and whisper around them as his eyes never left Steve who shined brightly than ever…
"I am s-sorry… so, sorry, please let me explain." Tony plea which only succeeded in making Steve laugh and shakes his head, running his hand through his blond hair and look back at Tony, who took a step forward only to stop by Steve's glare that freezing him in his place.
It made Steve's lips twitch up a little, but the smile fell as his son whine in fear and throw himself at his father when a female Omega walked near them, Steve looked at his shaken son and sighed to himself as he stood up with his son in his arms, it shocked Steve deeply when he found his son holding that Omega's arm without him screaming and throwing a fit like he always does when an Omega tried to talk to him. "Do you want to go to grandma's house today? Bucky would be there, and you can bother him all you want." Steve said as he starts walking, he heard Peter hum in thought then nod his head a, yes, holding into the bear in his hand tightly. Steve sigh at that and throw one last look behind him in wonder, that was the first Omega his son stood near and didn't scream his head off, that made Steve shook his head…
"We did it for your own good, James." Tony said as straightening himself, trying to show James that he wasn't affected by the way he was talking down at all, his action only gained him a snort from James and a sneer of disgust. "Just tell me, what did you think you were doing by taking Steve away huh? What was your goal? Obviously, he would have answered the phone after the first time I called him,
"OK, I don't want to be a killjoy or anything because that's so against me, but what the hell was that and why does it sound like my mother?!" That was Tony who squeaked and looked at the ceiling with a suspicious face a little pale at the thought of his mother knowing Steve's full name… maybe that traveler Steve was right and that he was dead, because why would the voice of his dead mother knows his name if he wasn't dead already?
"Hey Stevie, there you are!" Steve sighed when he heard Bucky's cheerful voice, he narrows his eyes and looked around to see that yes, he was still covered with shadow so he was invisible, and yes, Bucky was still able to see him with no problem, and no, Steve will never be able to hide from the former sniper no matter how he wished he could do it. Steve turned toward Bucky and paused a little with a thoughtful look, taking in the blue button-down shirt and the black slacks, contrast to Steve's tactic gears he always loved wearing, it's just something about the leather, metal, and black that always attracts him, but right now seeing Bucky in normal clothes made Steve a little self-conscious.
They didn't stay on the floor as long as Steve thought, but it was long for the man to have finished his coffee and look like he was going to fall asleep which made the blond raise his brow, he thought the coffee would have alerted the man to forget about sleep, but Steve know for a fact that not everyone who drinks coffee is affected by caffeine, Sam, always tell Steve that he usually falls asleep faster if he drank coffee before bed.
The sky was still thundering, and it wasn't even Thor who was causing the sky to turn dark in color that it was all black, it was actually Steve, and it was scary how all of New York was swiped away with the storm that Steve created because of his anger. Bucky, the foolish (And Thor's target) mortal, spent the whole day trying to calm Steve down, but it wasn't even working because Steve did nothing but ignore the Captain and go scratch the doors to Tony's lab as he begged the man to get out… which he didn't.
the words were clear as crystal, and were only changed in the last second because Maria was probably instructed by Natasha no doubt to keep the secrets the town's hold from Tony.
It was funny how a five minutes' walk to the iron gates of their mansion took more than fifteen minutes to complete with all the reporters throwing themselves at their limo, by then Peter was awake, and he was shivering and trying to hide himself behind Tony while whimpering and listening to Steve, who was crooning and holding both Tony and Peter trying to calm them down, Howard has already left the limo, screaming at the reporters and cursing at them, while promising to fire them all and to sue them if they didn't leave his property, Maria was instructing Happy to drive, and not care if the limo hit someone, while the nervous Beta trying to reason with the woman, all in all, it was a chaos.
"What did you do? After their death…" The star said, really wanting to know what Sara did to make the pain go away, to force herself of not thinking about the mortal every second of every time, the star really wanted to know, how she managed to shine so brightly when the only time he could shine was when he was able to see his mortal's face.
Howard, after lots and lots of snipping and snapping and being dragged around by Peggy, the Jarvises, and Maria; apologized to Steve and Peter for being an asshole, something that nearly made Steve chock on thin air for how sudden and surprising it was to gain the apologize. What makes Steve even consider forgiving Howard for years of pain and hurt, was Peter taking a shining to the man, and Howard being dotting and an understanding grandparent, even when he refused to show everyone but Peter his soft side
"You don't have to be sad love; your Daddy had been with us for a long time now, it's my fault because I didn't tell you who he really was." Steve whispered shakily, causing Peter to raise his eyes in confusion and equally hope, making Steve's breath leaving him. "Anthony Carbonell. A genius, billionaire, philanthropist…" Steve stated teasingly causing Peter's eyes to widen as realization painted his eyes.
The room was tense, no one was brave enough to break the silence, and they could only take what Steven shared with them, such a dark future… "What about you?" Loki finally said which made Steven blink before a harsh smile taking over his face, eyes going distant before they focused on Loki.
"Still, there must be some you can do as a counter back! An interview? A virus in his computer?" Rhodey asked, cooing when he saw a cute stuff doll dancing around; Tony though shook his head at how Rhodey seemed to be attached to the little terrors walking around, Tony didn't even react when the cute doll pulled out a small knife from somewhere and stabbed another doll who was crawling around making Rhodey jump back and let out a cry of denial at the action.
Tony gazed at his (Ex?) friends as they flinched at the harsh look in Steve's eyes, Tony even saw Bucky and Natasha take a step back; probably fearing that Steve will turn them into flies this time and try to kill them by dumbing them with a hungry spider… wow, wasn't Tony's imagination running wilder now? "Remember the deal…" Tony gritted out, even if he wanted to not die, Tony can't have Steve turned the Avengers to whatever he liked, not when an attack on the world could happen any minute now.
"How did you know… that the Omega was down there?" Fury started fidgeting a little. "When we talked with the neighbors they told us that the phone towers had a problem in the past few days, that the message the Omega sent was three days late, that in that time Stane made sure to close the staircase that went down… how did you know he plans on burring them alive?" Fury asked desperate to know how the other Alpha knew all of this, how he knew he should use his voice on Stane.
Also, this is my first try at iOS messages, probably sucks at it, I know nothing about coding, the green text is SMS messages.
Tony pursed his lips when the phone rang and rang and the only thing he was greeted by was the sound of the voice mail, but maybe that was better because Tony doesn’t even know what he would have said if he talked with Howard right now. “Hey, Dad… it’s me, Tony. I… I called to ask how you are, I know it had been two years but I… I wish we… I wanted to say I’m sorry.” Tony ended up saying, trying to stop his sniffing, taking a deep breath before returning to the phone once again. “New York is great; I’m doing good and I… I wanted you to know that I have met someone, his name is Steve… we are engaged, we are having the engagement party next week in our house, and I will really love if you could came…” Tony tried to stop his sob, talking with Howard even after two years of nothing still hurt, not only because he doesn’t know what to say and that there are so many things he wanted to say at once, but also because Tony left with nothing but the reminder that he was the one who shut his father down over and over again when the older man wanted nothing but to make things right. “I really missed you Dad, I know we had so many issues in the past but that we were able to overcome them in the end, I know it will take us a lot of time before we can go back to how we were before this time, but… can we try again, please? I don’t want to spent all of my life hating you for something that wasn’t your fault, I know I was angry and irrational, Steve helped me understand that; he is a good man Dad, I’m sure you two will get along when you meet…” Tony let out a tired laugh, wiping the tears that he didn’t notice until his hand made connect with them. “I hope I will see you this weekend, I miss you Dad, goodbye.” Tony hanged the phone, too tired to say anything else, already knowing that he shoved his foot in his mouth, and for a second Tony wondered if he was too late…
"He is well." The man's answer was short which made Steven raise his eyebrow at that and look forward, lips twitching up as he heard the Avengers 'Oh' and 'Ah' as they walked on Asgard's marble roads, gazing at the huge houses, it made Steven's eyes roam over the place with a sad look, so this was Thor's home before it was destroyed…
"Twenty-five it's then." The woman peeped making Steven blink his eyes at that and turn to her, watching as she returns to what she was doing not a few seconds ago, which was tinkering with her protection armor. "Don't worry star and strips; we are going to return home, already made a contact with Shield and they are en-route." The creature gives a croon of triumph, which made Steven hum at that and return toward his cuffs trying to bite through them with no use.
To be honest though, Tony can’t wait to marry Steve, and he was happy that the same sentiment was shared between his Alpha, which is probably why they agreed to hold the wedding in four months from now, maybe it was fast, some will say, and some will say they haven’t planned it at all, but the truth was, Steve and him just couldn’t wait anymore, the connection the two of them felt was too strong for it to be a fling and the was no uncertainty to cloud their relationship, the two of them knew that they wanted to spent the rest of their lives with each other.
The four of them got in the car in the evening heading home, with Tony holding into Peter's tightly, focusing on his excited chatters, trying to chase away the ghosts that Dr. Ross brought back to life. "And then we colored!" Peter said happily waving his hands in excitement which made Tony smile at the boy kissing his forehead and inhaling deeply taking his pup's comforting scent. "Look, Mama, Papa help me with drawing!" Peter said as he showed Tony the picture he draws with a happy grin on his face. "Dis is me, you, Papa, grandpa, grandma, Aunt Peggy, and Ang and Nat! And there is Jarvis and Goose!" Peter said as he pointed at the childish drawing, causing Tony to smile at that.
"I will say this one last time, Dad, so please listen well. I am not wasting my life, I am finally happy, can't you see that? Can't you see that the only reason I wanted to be recognized was so that you will finally look at me so that you will finally notice me? Can't you see that I am finally letting the company go to care for my baby? Away from the war, and killing, and bombs, and guns can't you see?" Tony questioned, making Howard look at his son with a strange look.
Humming a soft song under his breath, Tony grinned when he saw the town come into view, wondering about what change in his absence. Entering the town, Tony's eyes followed the familiar paths, taking in the changes that took place, the new shops that opened, and the old ones that closed or changed, making Tony's heart flutter in his chest.
"No, I just woke up from my nap a while ago." Tony gave Peggy a sleepy smile, causing the woman to let out an amused chuckle as she took the pie in one hand and throw her other arm around Tony, causing the teen to snuggle in her embrace,
"Rogers killed them because of that, didn't he?" Tony asked, already predicting what Rogers did but not having it in him to be angry at the life he took; the only thing Tony was angry about is Rogers not arriving in time and saving Peggy and Bucky's son.
He was once again, drunk, not something new as he was drunk for the past two years since his baby's death, it was nothing new for him, but he was tired of this cycle that continued to repeat itself over and over again, he was so tired.
"Race you to the room?" Steve asked in a husky voice, causing Tony's breath to hitch at that and for his eyes to darken, and the excitement Steve felt increased, making his heart pound in his chest as he rushed toward the room, hearing Tony's footsteps following him…
It was thanks to Loki who came in to receive his new dagger that Anton was saved; finally being able to throw that wench of an Omega out of his workshop and running away to the forest, hoping to gain a few peaceful hours before being forced back to the complicated situation the elders of this village throw him into. Something that the elders didn't leave unscathed, especially with how much Anton snarled and threatened them with death and pain if Fury found something unsavory about the Stone clan.
He attends Happy and Pepper's wedding in November, and was the maid of honor even, he was so happy for the two, they deserve all the happiness, and if he paid for their holiday in Hawaii? No one needs to know. And to top it all he knew the gender of his baby! He was going to have a boy! Tony was never this happy in his life, he wished with all of his heart that this happiness won't go away.
"It's OK… it must be hard, being fresh out of the military…" Steve gently offered, knowing that it was always hard for soldiers after coming back from overseas; maybe he will ask his friend Sam for a bit of advice, the Beta usually knows what to do in this kind of situations, maybe he will even invite the Beta to see James, hoping that he will be able to help the man.
After breakfast, Tony spent the rest of his time with his family, vibrating in his seat when Pepper, her mate, and Rhodey showed up to spent the day with him, and even that crazy Beta Carol showed up for a bit (Mainly to talk Steve's ear off about something, but she did wish him a happy birthday and gave him a crushing hug to match her enthusiastic persona) Tony spent that time looking between Carol, who was chatting Steve's ear about how she missed him, and Rhodey, who was looking at the woman with hearts in his eyes… well, they weren't hearts, but Tony saw how the Alpha perk up like a puppy when he saw the woman, and Tony promised himself that he will get Steve's help to set the two of them on a date.
"Dis is a tree!" Peter pointed out proudly looking at Steve and Tony who looked at what he was pointing at with amused smiles on their faces, though Howard and Maria tried to hide their laughter and were having a hard time at that.
Steven struggled to keep his breathing even, resting on the floor crossed legs with the sofa to his back, he was struggling hard to meditate, to calm and collect himself after what he learned, calmly daring anyone to move near him and try something, so that Steven may strike without feeling guilty at all, thus far everyone knew not to disturb him or else, even that purple wearing idiot, the only one though that seem to love pushing Steven's buttons was Anton, which Steven swore he will murder him and get rid of him this time, by himself!
It took a few more minutes for his mother to calm down and when she did, Thor couldn't help but smile when he saw his mother give him a soft look. "You have grown up…" Queen Frigga whispered as she caressed Thor's cheek causing the man to let out a happy sigh for being at the end of his mother's affection. "Come, your father is waiting for us." Frigga let out a sigh as she pulled away, and Thor gave his mother a nod as he followed her, trying hard not to act like a lost lamb.
The third one 'He Is An Addams!' with Steve being an Addams and the Winter Soldier in this fic, trying to court Tony, being desperately in love with our feisty brunette, while getting the cold shoulder from the said man, there is a side Steve Rogers/Everyone, but man is Steve only has his eyes on Tony?
Because of Steve not being with him, Tony had to work, half the working hours before rushing to school to pick the kids up; no one speaks or complain about Tony being absent from work most of the time, not when he managed to invent such breakthrough products from his workshop at home, with that Tony felt safe to clock out anytime he wants (Reasonably though)
After a year, Howard showed his face in SI, Steve saw Stane's face for the last time… a face full of hate and want for revenge… it made Steve uneasy… that night someone attacked Angie, she was able to escape thanks to Peggy teaching her self-defense, though she got half of her hair cut? and injured her arm, everyone was glad she was fine, her complaining about her beautiful hair being all gone made them laugh in disbelieve, but happiness at the same time.
…' Peggy could only hiss those words as she clenched her fists ready to hit Tony, but she was stopped by the scent of an angry Omega… a very angry Omega that was coming from Clint who was marching toward Peggy with a gun in his hand… really? What the hell is going on here?! "What are you doing here, Carter? You know that you are not welcomed around these parts anymore." Clint hissed, raising his gun, which caused Tony to flinch and try desperately to stop himself from raising his hands in surrender.
The first time he flew in it, his breath left him, joy took over him as he laughed and hooted and fly more, and then he saw it once more; his lucky star. He remembered his breath leaving him, and an insane idea came to him, and before he was able to stop himself, he was flying toward the star, maybe in the foolish hope of him being able to catch it, he will never know, but he knew one thing, and that was he needed to reach his star, he needed to have it by his side… and then the armor froze and he was fallen.
"Who do you think you are, ordering my husband?!" Tony screamed before he tried to attack his brother, which made the taller Alpha tense, especially when Tony attacked again, making Steve froze in his place as he took a step back followed by another, his breath speeding up as panic creeps inside of him and he took a step back but tripped and fell on his ass, but that didn't stop Steve from crawling away from the men that were screaming and raging at each other.
Reaching his room, Steven froze a little because Tony was waiting for him near his door with a frown on his face when his eyes fell on Steven's form; it was making Steven a little bit uncomfortable because out of everyone, he didn't want Tony to look at him when he was like this. "Are you really OK? I know some good therapist if you are interested." Tony said gently which made Steven press his lips tightly.
Grumbling to himself, Anton continued his walk to the lake, his mind wandering in a different direction, trying to think of many different solutions to the problems that the Stone clan are going to cause no doubt if they were left as they are. The best course of action at the moment, is leaving the Stone family alone while trying to avoid the two serpents, but saying this is easier than doing it, considering those two try to follow him everywhere he went; the only place they didn't try to follow Anton to was the outhouse, and even then Tyber is usually near when Anton finish his business.
Again, as Tony was saying the plan was easy, now that the town realized that Tony knew about the Rogers family son's death, they will probably test and retest him to get the answer they wanted from him; God knows what they will do to Tony if he didn't give them the answer they wanted. So today, Tony was going to the town's library to do his research. Tony was sure that at least the library had enough information about any murder cases that happened in the last thirty to forty years. Come to think of it Peggy and Bucky stated that their best friend 'left' the town thirty years ago; narrowing the search down,  if Stevie was the Rodgers family's son, which meant that Tony had to search the murder cases that took place in the sixties.
"I am g… going to pack…" Harley whispered his breath hitching as he stood up, sniffling as he tried to sidestep Tony and run to his room; Harley's words caused both Tony and Steve to freeze looking at each other with a confused look burden on horrified.
"Little one, I want you to meet Peggy and Angie." Papa said when the Jarvis let him go, that made Peter look at him and turn to see the women finally took a step toward Peter.
Now it brought Steve to where he was, trying to sneak out of the house to the supermarket, only to be stopped by Bucky who nearly had an aneurysm when he caught on to what Steve was planning. Now Steve knew what he was doing was wrong (Oh he knew, Bucky gave him an hour-long lecture to make sure that he does, he even brought out the dangers of going out when they still hadn't caught the stalker/prankster/trespasser/serial-killer?) but Steve couldn't stay in the house another minute or he would end up killing someone.
"Me… hero?" He stuttered Peter couldn't believe his little ears, his Papa just called him a hero, him! He turns to his Mama who was smiling with teary eyes, Mama told him that sometimes people cry when they were happy, Papa was finally back and he saved them from the bad men so Peter was sure his Mama was happy.
"Nah, the serum will save Steve before he bleeds out, he can do it all day, remember?" Peggy said with a twitchy smile, struggling to cover her terrified expressions behind teasing, something she didn't quiet success in doing perfectly, but no one pointed that to her, for all of them were suffering like this on the inside, specifically with the threats Tony was growling and the noises of thing or things crushing inside the room, they should have realized that something was awry, especially with how cheerful and over the moon Tony was, never becoming angry not even once in all of those nine months… if only they realized that the Omega was stewing it away to unleash the fury of thousands of suns on his birth.
"I did all of that, Mr. Wilson, and the files you have in your hands are the only things they were able to uncover," Tony said looking desperately by the second, from the corner of his eye he notices a photo on the desk. "I came to you because I was told that you were the best, that you could do the impossible…" Tony looked at Sam who was looking at the files on the desk. "Don't you have pups, Mr. Wilson?" Tony asked which got the Beta's attention.
So after Tony gathered his courage, he went outside to Sarah's backyard, he mingled for a little bit with everyone, smiling happily when he saw Pepper and her family and Carol with her baby, Rhodey was back to the base and hopefully will return next week, after mingling for an hour with everyone Tony finally said fuck it and stand beside the fence too tired and drain to mingle anymore, and he was thankful when everyone left him alone, probably they realized he needed a little time to himself, though on the downside, it seems like Sarah's son was a little late, something about work running longer than he anticipated.
"It's OK; he probably didn't get the invitation or something." Tony said as he pastes a small smile, turning in Steve's embrace to give him a kiss on the lips, letting out a soft purr in the back of his throat when one of Steve's hands start playing with a strand of his hair, trying to distract him from his thoughts; the doorbell rang, making the two of them break their kiss and give each other a confusing look before Tony shook his head and smiled at his fiancé. "Probably Rhodey forgetting something, I will answer it, can you be a dear and help with the living room?" Tony asked, getting a kiss from his fiancé before Steve turned to the living room.
It didn't stop Harley from fantasying though. It didn't stop him from staring at the Rogers house and dream about what it would be like to return back home every day and get hugged tightly, it didn't stop him from wondering what would happen if Mr. Tony accepted for Harley to stay with them even after having a baby… it didn't stop Harley from calling Tony
Stupid Anton, stupid foolish Alpha who refused to move on and mate one of the Omegas that Fury sent his way; the stupid foolish boy who continued to torture himself even after years and years with his stupid hope. Fury couldn't help that a part of him admired the young Alpha for staying faithful to a ghost that's long since left. Another part of Fury was angry at the hope Anton held, even after years had passed and the proof had been given that the person he was waiting for was dead.
"I am scared…" Tony ended up saying, his words causing Steve to hold his mate tightly, letting out calming pheromones in hope of Tony relaxing. "I mean… we have two kids to take care of… are we even ready for a third?" Tony asked, his voice breaking and his hands were twitching causing Steve to sigh and kiss Tony's head.
"You should be aware of what happened to that place." The woman spat and Steven scowled at her, gazing at her straight in the eyes with a glare making the woman scuff at that. "Was your
/Warning/: this chapter contains, cursing, a little bit of sadness, fluff, everyone being protective AF! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated...
After that date, you can say that Steve became a little soft on Tony, he no longer glare at the Alpha if he opened his mouth to say something, and no longer want to kick him out if the house every time he made Peter pout a little, but even with the soft way Steve treated the Alpha, it didn't mean that he has forgiven him, the Alpha knew that, he also knew that Steve still thinks that the Alpha was still going to leave him and Peter any minute now and that's why the Omega never told Peter about Tony being his father nor told the boy about him dating Tony Stark…
It was a few minutes before everyone finally let go of Steve and by then Tony finally pulled him from the robs he was wearing and kissed him harshly on the mouth, wanting to make sure that Steve was real, there was a time for gentleness, but later. "If you do this again, I would be the one who will kill you… I love you damn it, stop doing stupid things…" Tony stated with a strong voice that trailed into a choked whisper, his lips wobbled once more and Tony hated that he was going to cry for the third time that day because of the stupid martyr in front of him.
It hurt, it hurt so much; it hurt to breathe, it hurt to move, it hurt to even think. It hurt, and Steve wanted to cry. Steve wants to cry and sob and curl on himself until the pain goes away, but he can't, can't, can't! Not only because it hurt to move, but also because everyone needs him to stay strong. Everyone was breaking down in front of him, Tony, Bucky, May and her husband, the Barnes clan, even his goddammit doctor. Steve doesn't want that, he doesn't want that, he never wanted to be the reason to break his precious people's hearts, but it seems that he did exactly what he promised not to do.
Tony doesn't know how long he stayed sitting on the floor, the door supporting his back as he tried to calm the crying child in his arms. Tony knew that a long time had passed, when his baby finally stopped crying fell asleep and the panic that gripped Tony vanished, leaving Tony as nothing but a shaky mess. "I am so sorry, baby, so sorry…" Tony whispered as he rocked his hiccupping baby, wishing that it didn't turn out like this.
Tony shook as he saw himself putting on the mask and then a few seconds later he was talking to himself, it made Tony bit his lips and look at the mask lying on the table… Come back? Where did Tony go if Steve told him that? It ends with Tony getting back to work, it ends with the Alpha finding a new element by a miracle, it ends with him creating a Vibranium core, and it ends up with him defeating Whiplash for once and for all…
Realization dawned on Hamar and his face paled even more as he realized that, no, the Omega doesn't carry the marks of a slave, his hair wasn't cut short, but it was long, his clothes weren't ripped and old, but they were new, as new as any clothes that someone who had the wealth owned, there were no bruises on his body, he doesn't walk with his head lowered to the ground the Omega hold it high as he walked down the streets, and his son always play around the village not forced or bound to any work, it all leads to the realization that no, the Omega was not a slave, he was free as any citizen walking down the street. "B-but… but y-you said…" Hamar stuttered, the realization of what he did and what that meant for his punishment made him feel faint, for attacking another citizen and an Omega at that was punished by death after being tortured for an unknown amount of time. "You cannot kill m-me, m-my father will not allow it…" Hamar said in the last attempt to save himself from his approaching death, which gained him a loud and joyful laugh from the king, and that, more than ever sealed his fate.
"I'm going to see take the armor and go see Peter if he didn't go to the daycare, call me when you find something other than the man being a crazy bastard!" Tony says with a wave, causing Steven to growl at the metal man, taking one of the soft pillows beside him and throw it at Tony as hard as he can, which seemed to surprise everyone when the pillow collided with Tony's head, Steven always had a good aim, Sara praised him for it daily when he was young, Steve was grateful when the man didn't turn around and just kept on walking, the blond knew if the metal man turned to him, he will jump him and bash his head on the glass table that was near him.
Groot and Rocket stayed silent, letting the Avengers take in their words and come to the conclusion that suited them. Steve… Steve on the other hand could only bite his tongue as harsh as he can to stop himself from screaming and crying and cursing, he could only clutch his shaking hands tightly hoping that it won't give him away… it was true, the vision he saw was true, Asgard had failed, they had failed and now Thanos was going to come to Midgard; Thanos was going to come to Midgard and destroy the place that Steve loved and adored with all of his broken heart, Thanos was going to come and hurt his family, he was going to hurt his lover, he was going to come and hurt
"It's OK, little bambino, everything is fine, no harm is done." Tony told the small baby gently, which got him a sniff from the kid as he shook his head, trying to stop himself from letting out a small sob, but he did end up letting sniffles out now and then causing Tony to kiss the boy's forehead once more.
By the time Steven returned, it was eight a.m. just enough for him to shower and change into one of his dark uniforms that Edith kept in her storage unit in the pocket dimension, the first time he heard about this from Edith, he had laughed and cried at the same time, because his husband knew him to well, no matter what age Steven was he will always be a troublemaker who didn't back down from a fight even if it meant his death. 'Suicidal Bastard' his late husband always called him, and somehow Steven always felt that title fit him more than a thousand others the people around him gave.
Tony after leaving his room, he walked around the house searching for Steve, not calling the man's name, not wanting to wake up his family and annoy them when it was the middle of the night, he searched in his lab, his father's lab, the kitchens in fear of the soldier being hungry and that was the reason why he wasn't back, he searched the soldier's old room, and aunt Peggy's office, frowning when he didn't find the soldier anywhere, which caused the Omega to huff to himself, having only one destination left and that was his father's office.
It was like a normal day… or as much as normal it was considering that the first thing Steven after waking up was glaring at his counterpart with Peggy, daring the man to do something, to try something, which the man was smart enough not to dare them, Peggy made sure to pass on Steven's threat of ripping the man's knot perfectly.
"You… you are here; I thought… I thought you left… Howard…" Steve whispered shakily, trying to wipe the tears that refuse to stop; Tony was here, Tony was here with him even after Howard ordered him not to. The traitorous part of Steve couldn't help the hope blooming in his chest, wishing and praying that Tony was going to choose him, just this time he wanted Tony to choose him.
Tony blink as he saw the lights changed and he waited until the cars stopped before crossing the bath, his eyes zeroing on the big building in front of him. A lot of things changed in the past year, Tony get to know more about Sarah Rogers who always talks about her ex-soldier/famous artist son and her grandson, he always wonders why the son never visited his mother, but Winnie ends up telling him that the Alpha (Sarah's son) lives in London. It was a year since Winnie came into his house with George, both of them crying their eyes out, telling him about their son losing his arm overseas and that he was being shipped home next month, that day Tony create his first prosthetic limb; he worked on that arm to perfection and with the help of Bruce, the limb was a perfect replacement for the arm James (Winnie's son) lost, Winnie even told them that her son could fell things with his arm, like temperature, texture, and other things, the prosthetic was success when SI launched it a month later into the markets. A year pass with Clint taking it upon himself to help Tony with finding his son; Phil working with the government had its perks, but finding where Tony's pup was not one of them, though the two helped him whenever they can, even if it meant that Clint will force Tony to babysat his little devils when he had a date night with his mate. A year pass since Carol dropped from the air force because she fell pregnant, now she and Rhodey were on their leave, enjoying their three months of bonding with their one-month-old baby James the second or Jimmy for short, needless to say, Tony laughed his ass off when Rhodey told him about the name. a year pass with him and Pepper becoming close to a sister and brother more and more, the Beta always worried about him every time he left her sight, old habits die hard, especially when Happy became his personal driver to keep Pepper updated on his whereabouts, it was kinda insulting, but he could understand from where they were coming.
The next time Steven woke up, it was to a killing headache as he looked at the creamy white ceiling with a dazed look, he turned his head a little to see everyone was sitting there talking with someone with yellow/blue clothes? Steven's mind was too groggy to think or care about details at this moment. Sighing softly to himself Steven sat himself on the bed which made everyone gasp ad rush to him, they were all talking his ears off, which made Steven contain his urge to scream his head off to shut them up, so he looked at the person that was standing in the back of the group looking at Steven with an interesting look.
Clint was finally reunited with his family, and he was the happiest person Steve saw, he and his wife ends up having another child, a little girl they named Natasha, to honor their dead friend that sacrificed herself, Clint still live in the farm, with his children and grandchildren visiting him, Laura (God rest her soul in peace) had passed away ten years ago. Steve has never been as proud as when Clint told him he was opening an orphanage to help children with superpowers abilities. Sometimes Steve will drop for a little chat now and then, these days they mostly talk about the past, Steve never mentioned to his friend how tired he looked, how old he looked day after day if Steve was right, his friend was going to be ninety in few months.
Steve, whose body bends pliantly along Tony's movement, moans loudly, and staring at Tony with wide, submissive eyes; for a while they just stare at each other, their noses brushing together, sharing a vulnerable wordlessness. Their lower stomachs are slippery from pre-cum from Steve's cock that's pressed between their bodies, and Tony slowed down for a bit, concentrating all of his senses on how hot and wet and easy and perfect everything is. They belong together, like this. "You belong to me…" Tony whispered his words to Steve and Steve clench around him in response. A particularly long and demanding thrust cuts of Steve's voice, cutting whatever he was about to say voice.
"Well, it's a little hard to calm down…" Tony mumbled before leaning on Steve, furrowing his brows in deep thoughts. "Say, do you want a boy or a girl?" Tony asked suddenly, causing Steve to blink in surprise and turn his eyes to Tony who had a mischievous look on his face. "Don't you think we are already outnumbered with two adventurous boys? What about a girl to help balance things down?" Tony wiggled his eyebrows causing Steve to snort and let out a chuckle, leaning to kiss Tony's cheek before pulling back.
Bucky's voice greeted Steve, causing Steve to sob in relief before flinching at the curses he heard outside of the bathroom. "Bucky… t-there is someone in the apartment, I don't know who but they broke in, please hurry up," Steve whispered shakily he wondered if this was his imagination and he was losing his mind or that someone really broke into the apartment, the growl and the slam of the doors made Steve flinch harder and hide in the tube behind the curtains, shaking as one of his hands went to touch his belly. At the end of the phone, the curses Steve heard made him shake, fearing that it was too late and that Bucky can't make it.
"He is alright, my queen. I just came from his room; the little prince was as fussy as ever about taking a bath." Margaret's words made a quiet laugh leave him, as he stood up after the Beta was finished with his hair, he then went to the tub in his room hiding by a screen, letting out a sigh of content as he disrobed himself and lowered himself in the warm water.
Rogers faltered for a second as if he doesn't know what to do, his hands hovering at his sides, as Tony held to him tightly. Rogers's skin was freezing and cold, but it was warming a little bit in Tony's arms. Taking a shuddered breath, Tony managed to smell Rogers; his scent was of damp, rich soil, of pale green shoots growing under the frozen earth.
"Tell me about Steven Rogers. Why did he become what he is now? Why did no one arrest Peirce when Rogers reported him? Why does he kill?" Tony ask instead, trying to change the subject as best as he can; Tony didn't want to think about what Fury just told him, that was another thought for when he is home and going to have a panic attack, not here in the office trying to discover what Steven Rogers want from him.
"I do not know what you are implying by your words; for I have not touched any child of yours. I admit my actions against you were wrong, but you have no right to accuse me of such a thing." The king said darkly, raising his head and gazing at the Omega with a daring look; daring the Omega to lie and spread wrong words about him, something that did nothing but amuse Steven even more.
Steve narrow his eyes at the Omega's back then turned toward his son, who was looking at the toy with a happy look on his face. "Ne, Peter…" Steve asked gently as he lean down a little to look at his son. "What did he smelled like when you went near him? You know he is an Omega right?" Steve held his breath waiting for his son's answer.
"… Didn't know that you use inhalers?" Steve said trying to change the subject, which Tony didn't care about much because it meant that Tony had won this battle, which caused him to relax a little, taking his inhaler from Steve outstretched hand.
Tony wanted to ask, but it was silly and too much. Tony knows that he was gearing himself for a heartache, especially when Steve was going to return to his home at the end, when they defeat Thanos and everything is over, Steve will return to his old life with the stars and forget all about Tony and the Avengers. Tony knew his heart will break when Steve was going to leave them, and he hoped deeply that the blow will be softer for his son because his baby was just like Tony too attached to Steve to let him go. Just for a second, Tony tried to imagine, what will his and Peter's life be like if Steve left them.
A few more minutes pass before the shadow finally decided to show itself, causing Steven's eyes to widen and for his jaw to fall a little; shock painted his face clearly when he saw the person in front of him. Steve blinked his eyes, wondering if what he was seeing was true, that the person standing in front of him was real and not a play of his imagination. A part of Steven couldn't help but wonder if the Alpha standing in front of him was the same Alpha his family considered a dear friend; Nicolaus Fiðr, an Alpha supposed to have died in the sea not long after Steven and his mother left Brookland.
Bruce… Bruce was always shy when he was around Steve, he took it as his mission to question Edith on the biology of the humans in Steve's world, then ask Steve to do some tests for him, what Steve learned was not something that he ever wanted to hear in his whole life. He was told by Bruce after a lots of tests that Steve by this world's standers an Alpha through and through, other than the biological changes as not having a knot, scent glands, and inner Alpha or the most favorite name, inner wolf, the doctor also told Steve that he most likely had the lifespan of a werewolf, it made Steve stunned, it made him wonder how Dr. Erskine created the serum, it made him wonder if this was the reason that every serum was created after his death was a failure, it made him wonder when Dr. Erskine met a werewolf to even create the serum, if werewolves actually exist in his world.
"What the fuck is that Tony?" Barnes squeaked as he eyed the room with disbelieving eyes, turning to the short man with a murderous look on his face. "How could you do this? It's horrible! It's bloody! And no decent human can even live here! It's… it's…" Barnes lost his ability to talk but the glare on his face promised Tony death, and maybe Tony shouldn't have tempted fate, especially when it was going against Captain America.
/Warning/: This chapter contains cursing, darkness, horror elements, creepiness; Steve is so in love! And we will meet surprising characters! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
"Yes, I am married to Rhodey…" The woman said as she twisted her hands nervously which made Steven turn his eyes to the man for a brave second before returning his gaze to the woman.
"Don't do that!" Tony shrieked when he regains his normal breathing and heart rate, looking at Steven who was awake and gazing at him with amusement clouding his eyes. "God, you are even worse than that asshole, didn't Aunt Peggy teach you not to scare poor Omegas? We have a delicate hearts!" Tony grumbled as he took his seat back, glaring at Steven darkly hoping that he understood the meaning of his words.
Marks of slaves: As everyone knows being a slave in medieval times was a death sentence, but in Norse Society, slaves were known by marks only they held, and the most important one of them the short hair, only slaves has short hair, the free, rich, and noble has long hair and beard, Vikings valued their long hair, as for the other marks of a slave I mentioned them and they are easy to follow.
The woman closed her eyes and took a deep breath before going to the door, and opened it, ignoring Howard's piercing look as she entered the room he was in and closed the door behind her looking at the Alpha's eyes with her tired ones, the older woman just walked until she seat on the other side looking at Howard straight in the eyes. "Why?" Maria could only say after a while of silence, and she didn't know what that question was for, why did you change? Why were you so cruel? Why did you destroy Tony's life? Why did you destroy his mate's life? A lot of questions in just one single word… it was funny in some twisted way. "So you are not going to talk? Nothing? Not after destroying our son and his mate's life, after you destroyed your grandson's life." That got a reaction out of Howard which was him glaring at Maria which the Omega ignored.
As time went, though, Tony became grateful for the additional time he had to straighten up his mind; the additional time gave Tony and his family a lot of time to think and bond with each other; especially he and Steve. It was true that the two of them were nearly on the same mindset and never argued that much, but the extra time for just them and Peter helped them greatly.
Steven paused in his walk back with a frown on his face. "When was the last time?" Steven thought to himself with furrowed brows, wondering when the last time he bleeds was… continuing the days, Steven pales as he discovered that he was a week late, a week late and his heat was a month ago and he didn't bleed after it… suddenly the fatigue and nausea made since, his want for more food but always stopping himself last the king discovered he was using more than normal while making food, him always looking at the lining and soft clothes wondering which was the softest to make a nest… Steven shook his head and gave a nervous laugh at that, he was probably paranoid, probably got the numbers wrong, and that he will start bleeding today because there was no way… no way!
"I am sure Tony." Steve stated, feeling so uncomfortable standing naked in front of his husband; Steve shifted in his place before going to pick up his clothes from the ground, redressing himself, trying to ignore how sticky and sweaty he was, he will shower later. Tony catching on to Steve's discomfort so he went to redress himself, sending Steve worried looks now and then.
The woman's words made Steven pause as he took the woman in. "I wish I could believe you, Mrs. Rhodes, I wish I could." Steven said which made the woman open her mouth and close it not knowing what to say which meant that it was Steven's cue to leave and he did, he rushed toward his room, slamming the door to his room shut and taking off his clothes, going to the shower hoping that a long cold shower will calm him down.
So knowing that by the end of the day her grandson and possibly son are going to be drained from interacting with Omegas, she made sure to keep her eyes on the two of them. At first, when the two of them arrived late, she was just happy to see them she hugged her grandson tightly, and then her son, when she let go, to ask Peter if he wanted anything, the pup wasn't there which nearly made her have a panic attack, that was until she saw the pup hugging Tony who was standing in his corner away from the party, and she had to hold her jaw from falling on the floor, so when her son went to collect his pup away from Tony, she made sure to follow him and keep an eye on the Omega.
This baby was one of his creations, as much as Dummy, and his (In the process) AI, he couldn't get rid of him, so what if Tony needed a little bit of outside help to create him? It doesn't matter, because Tony decided on keeping the baby. He just hopes that he wouldn't mess up too much.
After the first day, when Tony and his friends discovered the secret room, you can say that the haunting really started (Or get worse, not that Tony noticed his house being haunted before, not when there was a lake monster nearby) usually it was harmless pranks, as harmless as it can be, and it seemed that Tony and Morgan were the only ones not affected by the haunting (Tony didn't gain any hardships after the first time he nearly tripped by the ghost and nearly had a concussion.)
Steve also met a cute cat named Goose, who is revealed to be an alien Flerken… from that day on Steve gaze at every cat, he saw with suspicion… Goose, as it seems, took a huge liking to Steve, following him everywhere and rubbing herself on the older man, Dr. Lawson told him that the cat liked him and this was the first time she saw Goose acting like this toward anyone even Carol, the only person after Dr. Lawson Goose tolerate. Fury still has a sour relationship with the cat, and Steve can sympathize after all the cat ripped his left eye. Talos flinch every time the cat comes near him and when Steve picked the cat up and start scratching under her chin, every alien was stunned how the cat starts purring and nuzzling Steve… the Soldier didn't expect the cat to regurgitates the Tesseract in his hand (In such a disgusting way) it made Steve pause for a long time, and look at Howard and Peggy with a blank and dark look, making the two Alphas shift uncomfortably, in the end, it was agreed that the Tesseract will stay with Steve, guarded Goose as no one wants to go near that demon cat other than Carol and Dr. Lawson.
Sitting on the boat, the creature looked around the place curiously, puffs of breath leaving him, painting the air in front of him white; the creature ended up letting a huff of annoyance when he didn't see any interesting thing on the boat other than the sleeping boy, even the oars; looking around the place, he saw them floating far away from the boat, there wasn't even a warm blanket he can use to dry the water soaking him and the place he was sitting on.
"I am sorry, my name is Steven Rogers, I don't know how I can say that without laughing, but I am from the future, well, a different future." Steven said with a serious face which caused Jarvis to blink and put the grocery on one of the kitchen counters before returning his face to Steven, and the blond could see how hard the brunet was trying to hold his laughter.
"Yeah, that's me, in the flesh!" Tony said with a cheer and he really wanted to thank his mother for forcing him to take acting classes, because if it wasn't for them Tony would have caused a scene by now. His response made Steve smile and look at the small pup that was playing with his toy.
Steve took them out for ice cream; the last time they will enjoy that amazing treat considering that fall was coming soon followed by winter. After that the three of them returned home, to spend the rest of their day enjoying their time, Steve though ended up leaving midway of them watching a Disney movie that Peter spent three days whining about seeing.
Tony walked toward the mirror to inspect himself, tilting his head a little to the side, inspecting if something was off; only there wasn't anything odd about his attire, he looks handsome… as handsome as a walking corpse with a target on his back that is. "You look dashing, dear!" A feminine voice cooed making Tony squeak and jump, looking around the place with his heart pounding in his chest.
It ends with Tony letting out a sigh through his nose as he put the pup on the ground. "Hey, baby." Tony whispered to the pup gently which made the pup look at him. "Mama Need to go for a little while can you wait for me with Papa and be a good boy?" Tony said which caused fear to appear in the pup's eyes as he whines a little and shakes his head tears appeared in his eyes.
"Baby…" Steve sighed as he held the Omega tightly, pulling him away from the room, away from the place that seems to break his Omega's spirit every time he walked inside, he made sure to close the door behind them and lock it, not wanting the Omega to return to the room later, he hid the key in his pocket. "I can't tell you how to move on, I can't tell you what to do, you can't really recover unless you take the first step for that." Steve explained to the Omega gently which got him a growl in return.
Thor shivered in his place in the gym, he still remembered Steve's face when it twitched into that scary terrifying face, and he hoped that he wouldn't see that face ever again in his life, it was true that the thunder loved Steve dearly, for the man strangely reminded him of his home in a way, but the thing, is ever since Loki dared to come to Midgard, Thor felt like his life was hanging by a thread, not a feeling the man liked or wanted to feel like ever again, but once again, Thor could do nothing but grimace at his luck and the dark fate Loki seemed to have sent him to.
"…bad day… a really shitty bad day…" Sam said as he sat up and took a swing from his beer, sighing and putting his head in his palm. "You know, I never hated my job so much as I hated it now, I couldn't believe that I was the reason breaking that Omega's heart informing him that his pup died." Sam muttered which made both Bucky and Steve look at each other over the Beta's head.
"Wait! Please let me explain!" Tony gasped gripping Steve's hand, the only thing that followed was the feeling of pain blossoming on his right cheek, and he let go of Steve hand going slowly to touch the stinging he felt, though this was nothing compared to the look Steve was throwing him because Steve was crying, he was crying and it was clearly Tony's fault.
"Then let us pray to Odin that the queen will not catch a sight of Tyber; for I know I will not stop him when he goes at that weasel with a sword." Anton hissed standing from the wooden stool he was sitting on. Part of Anton wanted to be the one that will have a go at Tyber, but knowing the queen; the man will have a go at Tyber before Anton and turn his sword at Anton if the Alpha dared to stop him from having his revenge.
"Greetings Avengers, welcome to Asgard, my name is Frigga I will be the one to take you to meet Odin." The calm sound of the woman made them look up to see them waiting for them on the top of the stairs, which caused everyone to bow to the woman when they saw Steven do it.
Steve should be thankful to Bucky, his friend was with enough sound mind to drive them to the hospital; all Steve could do was sit in the back seat with his boy, kissing his forehead and checking the rising temperature that didn't seem to go down. He should have been fast; he should have taken his boy to the hospital before his baby collapse, why did Steve wait until it was this late? What took over his mind and let him be this ignorant until it was late? So many questions running inside his mind and not enough answers to satisfy him at all.
"I… I ended up marrying an Addams…" Tony admits, his voice sounding distant even to his own ears, and Tony wondered if he really deserved the title genius when he so easily fell into Rogers trap. Just one date he said, it won't hurt he said, Tony can decide how it could go he said! It should have never ended up in marriage!
"Uncle Bucky…?" The pup… Peter asked which made Bucky kneel in front of him and nod his head making the child's eyes sparkle and the pup ends up throwing himself at the man hugging Bucky when the Alpha opened his arms. All the while Bucky was shaking on the inside as he smelled the scent of sickness coming from the pup, Steve's teary eyes was enough for him to hold his questions in for another time, it was not the right time, not when the pup was nuzzling his neck, touching his shoulder-length hair with fascination…
"Tony, look what I found!" Steve called out happily as he ran toward Tony who was enjoying himself in the chair; the sight of Steve running toward him in his black swimming truck made Tony make a double back and raise his sunglasses, not because of how handsome and edible Steve was looking, but because in Steve's arms… there was a great white shark being held effortlessly by its middle like it was a light plush.
"What did I say about eavesdropping, Pete?" Tony asked causing the little boy to mumble something in a low voice and hide his face in Tony's chest, an act that made Tony sigh and kiss his boy on the top of his head. "Besides, Steve isn't going to get hurt, baby." Tony assured Peter, getting a skeptical look from the boy in his arms which caused Tony to chuckle. "It's true baby, no harm is going to come to Steve, do you know why?" Tony asked getting a head shake from Peter who was still sniffling. "Because we are the Avengers, and we are going to protect Steve no matter what." Tony assured his boy.
The possessiveness that Steve showed Tony last night, made him shiver just thinking about it, his toes curled and he had to bite his lips to stop his gasps as he remembered the possessive hands that run over every exposed skin of his body. How Steve marked him and refuse to leave any inch of his body unmarked, making Tony moan and groan and scream in pleasure.
The two start sparring and Peggy, quickly proves herself to be a much better warrior than Steven imagine, a fact that proved to be less surprising to Steven considering that he knew Peggy was a strong cookie from the start. Their size difference hardly has any bearing on the outcome. Peggy knows how to use her body, but more than that, she knows how to use Steven's, which may have tripped him up at first, but he regains his composure, being more careful with her now.
“Don’t be mad, honey bear, it was only a week since he proposed; we decided to gather you all in a party a week from now to inform you.” Tony smiled at his friends gently, heading to hug Carol before going to Happy, thankful that Rhodey decided on a small get together for his birthday, it meant that he will be able to tell his friends all he wanted without feeling embarrassed.
"No, no, no, no…" Was the breathless whisper Steve continued to let out as desperation took hold of him, it can't be; how long was he out? Where was his baby? Where was he? Steve's breath picked up the longer he was left to ponder on this line of thoughts, the horrifying nightmare of his baby is gone, made a scream tear from his dry throat, uncaring of the pain he was feeling or the sound of footsteps drawing near him.
After that day, Tony finally saw Pepper, Happy and Rhodey, all of them with tears running down their faces; he remembered getting lots of visitors, and not even turning his face toward them, he remembered that he screamed at his father every time he entered the room begging him to give him his baby back, he remembered how he screamed the day he saw Stane in his room, nearly attacking the man ready to kill him if it weren't for the nurses and the doctors sedating him, he remembered how he hated his father more and more when he gave him his baby's death certificate.
Steve bit his lower lip, excitement warming its way through his heart at the thought of finally getting his husband back from whatever headspace he had been in for a few months now. Maybe they will have a date night with just the two of them; no thinking about S.I., about Howard, even Bucky. It will be just Tony, Steve, and their baby…
Slowly they moved the few feet towards Steve's bed and together they sank onto the mattress. Steve dragged his hands across Tony's chest and his nipples and Steve pushed his thigh between Tony to rub against the erection he found there, making the Omega gasp into his mouth. In turn, Tony rubbed his fingers and palms over Steve's arms and chest, stomach, and into his hair, everywhere he could reach.
The shouting of the servants as they called for him, telling him that they were alive, made something tight in Steven's chest loose and for relief to take hold of him.
"Don't worry, I will protect you don't worry…" Steve whispered looking around the closet. Seve then turned to the hidden door behind Tony and opened it slowly as to not make any sound, pointing to Tony to go through the door to the other side. "Get in, no one will notice the hidden door, I made sure of that when I build the room…" Steve whispered, causing Tony to nod shakily as he crawled toward the door knowing that if the door closed probably, no one will realize that there was something amiss if they didn't look closely, both Steve and Tony flinching at the crashing sound followed by laughter they heard coming from downstairs.
"Steve!" Tony's voice cracked when he tried to call out Steve's name; Tony could only run toward Steve, his eyes tearing up when his Stevie let out an ear-piercing scream of pain as he clutched his heart. Tony wanted to cry, he wants to break down and cry and curse and whine like a little child who lost his parents, but he can't, he can't, he can't! He has to stay strong, if not for himself, then for Steve and Peter.
Steven pressed his lips tightly to stop a cruel smile from crossing over his features, thinking about the answer took a few minutes but in the end, Steven turned to gaze at the king with empty eyes. "It does not matter what you think, two of my children died because of you; so if I wanted to blame you, I will." Steven started his words, swallowing as he shuffled around to sit, wondering if he should say the real reason why he hates the man in front of him. "Did you know that I would have given Johann the information he wanted to know about my people just to spar my children? I would have done that, I was close to doing that, but I knew it would not matter in the end." Steven admitted telling the king the secret that he promised to take with him to his grave. "But I promised myself to hold on so that I will take my revenge from you; you, the person who did not have the courage and honor to come when I send you all the information you needed about Johann and his palace, begging you for help as one of your people," Steven whispered, ignoring how the king's eyes widen at his icy words.
"Steve… what's going on…?" Tony's lips tremble as he asked that question holding into Morgan tightly as fear froze him in his place. What was going on? A second Tony was on the boat, another one he was in Morgan's room which turned out to be Steve Rogers's room, and now he was in the closet? This can't be happening, it can't be happening, it just can't; this was crazy, crazy, crazy!
May and Ben finally became parents, their small boy was born three months after Steve gaining the serum. Peter had gotten attached to Harley so fast that he starts pestering Tony and Steve about wanting a little brother something that caused both Steve and Tony to flush in two parts embarrassment, one part longing, which end up with one part lust, but the two of them reign themselves thankfully, though that didn't stop Bucky and his girlfriend from pestering them about their next child (Bucky finally gained the courage to ask Natasha out after Steve kicked him in the ass).
"I always notice you, Tony. I always recognize your work; I just don't understand why you refused to tell me things like this." Said Howard as he took hold of Tony's hand, but the teen pulled his hand away, making Howard look at his son, with a broken look.
From the corner of his eyes, Steven saw Peggy reaching him, and before she made any sudden move, he stopped her by hissing at her which made the woman stop in her place. "Don't make any sudden moves… there are wolves inside." Steven said which made Peggy frown and just like always, Peggy ignored him and enters the library which made Steven nearly scream again… why does Peggy always do this to him?
Steve took a deep breath as he looked around the place, swallowing when it finally hit him why this room was the only forbidden one in the whole house… a room that held so many promises and heartache… Steve went to Tony, touching the Omega's back gently which only caused the Omega's sobs to become louder, hiding his face in his knees, and Steve knowing the Omega he knows that there was no moving him.
. I wanted to present the house to you before all this mess with Howard and Pepper happened." Steve choked as he heard these words coming from his husband; his heart couldn't help but pound in his chest like crazy.
"I informed them they should give birth in the hospital, but no! They chose to do a home birth, and now my household will turn into a crime scene." Howard grumbled, unknowingly answering Maria's question, causing the woman delivered a silent pray that Steve will get through this day, she really liked the Alpha, he was a good one for her Tony, besides she doesn't wish for her granddaughter and grandson growing up without a father.

It was five minutes before Steve was back and he gave Tony something that looks like a gelatin mask, which made the Omega blink at that and looks at the Alpha. "What is this?" Tony finally said while still looking at the mask holding it with two fingers and shiver at the cold and smooth texture he was feeling.
"Would that be so bad if I did?" Steve asked, and Tony can see the sincerity in his eyes, and nope, just nope, he did not just ask Tony that question; will it be bad? For Tony, no, it won't, because he will get to live with someone normal and maybe he will eventually like, but for Steve? The man will be miserable! He practically lives for summoning demons and voodoo dolls and being creepy all night long. This will kill him! And no! Hell no! Tony was not going to be that bitch who order people to change who they were just to fit to be with them, how dare Rogers pull a Tony on him? That was Tony's shit, not the crazy Addams!
It was a normal day… well, as normal is it can be for fifteen years old in his last year of MIT, it was summer so for once Tony decided he was going home in New York, mainly to visit Jarvis and Aunt Peggy, if someone deserves to be treated with respect and love, it was those two. His first week there, was even good! His parents were in God knows where and would come by the end of the week, Aunt Peggy took a vacation and come to visit, she told him more stories about Captain America then his poor heart can stand… Aunt Peggy always laughs at his poorly hidden flushed face, but that doesn't matter he got to listen to more stories about his hero so that was as good as it can be. Jarvis took it as his job to overstuff Tony with his delicious food, stating that Tony was starving himself to death and that he won't stand it, for once Tony didn't complain he just drooled as the amazing food was laid in front of him, all in all, it was an amazing week… until he presents as an Omega by the end of it.
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, sadness, time skips, shocking news, near mental break down, panic attack, and awesome Peggy Carter! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
Tony wanted to scream, he wanted to shout and order whoever was talking to shut up. There were so many voices talking at once, maybe a hundred, maybe a thousand, and they were causing Tony a great headache as he tried to make sense. They all were talking at once, not giving Tony a chance to make sense of their words, causing Tony to chock in fear when he did; the fear increased when Tony opened his mouth to question them and nothing came out, no sound, not even a whine…
Steve gaze around the room his eyes fell on the balcony that was facing the door, the closet to the right that was hidden by a huge claw-like machine, taking in the double bed with the blue sheets in the  right corner that was made; the couch beside the door, the wooden floor, the posters on the walls, and his original shield from his time as a USO dancer hanging above the bed, the small nicknacks that were every way he looked, the left the wall was covered with shelves that were covered with books and prizes and pictures it made Steve walked toward them to take a good look. A computer on the desk under the small library lights up making Steve blink in confusion and look down toward the computer only to see a text on the screen.
"Bring them in… please." Tony said with a shaky voice that made Steve pause and look at the pup that was too busy playing with the Shield and the plush to pay attention. "Give him to me, I will try and calm him down." Tony said as he extends his hands to take the pup, which made Steve stand from his chair holding the pup, which made the small boy squeal happily as he was put in his mother's lap. "Hey love, had a lot of fun over there didn't you?" The Omega hummed as the pup giggled and nod his head snuggling into Tony's chest. "Baby…" Tony's trembling voice made the pup look up at his mother who was giving a trembling smile. "Mama is about to meet his family, remembering grandpa and grandma? They are here with aunt Peggy, Angie, Jarvis, and some of Mama's old friends… they are good people love, so you don't have to be afraid…" Tony said which made the pup look at the door then at his mother, worry and fear to shine in his eyes.
"Look at me you piece of shit! Just because I rejected you doesn't mean that you are to go after my teammates! Why can't you understand that I hate you?" Tony screamed at the man, throwing the knife at the shadow he saw moving from the corner of his eye which got him a moan of pain followed by a banshee scream… then nothing… but the look on Rogers' eyes when he turned to the side to see smoke rise made Tony nearly rip his hair off because the man practically had hearts instead of eyes as he returns his gaze toward Tony.
"I just wanted to talk." Steven said his smile slipping a little when Tony's face fell and became darker at the word 'talk' like he already expected Steven to try and sway him into Peggy's side, and maybe that's what Steven was after, but he was far more subtle then what Peggy or anyone thinks he was capable of. "Do you want to escort me for a walk?" Steven asks phrasing his words in a way that gave Tony no choice to decide, which the Omega seemed to catch on, as he bites his lower lip and nodded his head after a while following Steven when the man nodded to.
The winds pick up, sending a chill down Tony's spine, and he gazed at Stane, whose attention seemed to be away from Tony. Taking this as his chance Tony tried to take a step away from Stane, only to flinch when he heard another gunshot and Stane snarling in an angry voice; Tony could only shake as he tried to take another step toward the lake, for he knows that if someone will save him then it will be the lake, he just needs to reach it.
. Thought Steve to himself with a small smile, everything changed in the past forty years or so since he woke up from the ice, lots of things changed, for the better or worse, but the world was spinning and that was the important thing.
"What do you mean that there is already a whore out there trying to steal my mate!" squeaked Natasha looking at Steve like he told her he was working with Hydra all along.
"Angie! How many times I have to tell you! I eat my food! Even that extra food you send my way by Clint and Nat, which is sweet but unnecessary, you and Peggy are practically stuffing me full of food!" Tony whine which made the old woman raise an eyebrow at him, reaching over and poking Tony gently in the stomach with a frown.
Thankfully, Pepper, sweet merciful Pepper saw him struggling and came to his rescue! Good, because Tony was about to growl and storm away from the woman he was talking with, something which would have probably cause scandal because he was sure that the woman he was talking to was the wife of some general or something. "Stop pouting Tony." Pepper smiled, her eyes were twinkling like she knew something that Tony didn't.
A shuffle from his left side caused Anton to turn around to see Fury gazing at Tyber with a narrow eye; Fury had never liked Tyber a day of his life, always doubting Tyber especially when he came back with the needed information from the Hydra king. If it was up to Fury, he would have probably killed Tyber on sight; this was why Anton tolerant Fury, the two of them see eye to eye on some things and agree on some others.
"That was harsh don't you think?" Loki said as a smile played on his face, causing Steven to roll his eyes and turn to the dark-haired man with a shrug." He made you angry didn't he?" Loki asked as he leaned on his chair looking at Steven's eyes, amusement flicker on his face, causing the blond man to give a mocking smile.
/Warning/: this chapter contains, cursing, a little bit of sadness, fluff, dancing, everyone being protective AF, and Steve and Tony are going to kiss! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
"Tony…" Harley called out as soon as he crossed the street; his heart was pounding tightly in his chest as he reached Tony and the strange woman, trying not to flinch when the woman send Harley a glare, looking like she wanted to slap him for his interruption. "Come on, we need to go…" Harley nearly choked on his breath when he took hold of Mr. Tony's hand, trying to pull him toward Mr. Clint's house without shaking in his place at the annoyed and angry look the woman was sending his way.
" The Omega said showing his left wrist, and the Chief narrows his eyes when he saw a white thread of wool wrapped around the Omega's wrist, that made him blink.
"She is not my mistress, she is my friend! It was just a stupid kiss in the heat of the moment, the only reason I didn't tell you about it, is because I know you will overreact like you always do!" Tony shouted, causing Steve to flinch at the dark undertone Tony used, but that didn't stop Steve's hackle from rising at how his husband spoke to him; overreact? Steve would show him what overreacting meant!
"I am sorry, sweetheart." Steve sighed as he came and held Tony tightly, scenting the Omega and causing him to purr. "But Fury is hounding to come tonight and finish the next chapter of Iron Man, he promised me the week off if I finish it tonight, so I might be late." Steve huffed, which gained an amused smile from Tony who accepted the fact that his husband no doubt agreed to finish the chapter of the comic tonight for the promise of a week off; a week he needed after Peggy throw a dark threat to both of them.
What throws her off was also him knowing about Tony, he talked about her nephew with such softness, Peggy was sure his eyes were sparkling at the mention of him, it made Peggy narrow her eyes and took her phone. "Fury, bring the Avengers to the HQ," Peggy ordered in a commanding voice as soon as the phone was picked up after the first ring, she didn't even wait to hear the other Alpha's confirmation; she just clicked the phone shut and turned her gaze toward the sleeping man on the bed.
It was two hours later and just as Tony's friends promised him, today they decided to have a picnic in the park. It was a nice day to be outside, the sun was shining, the autumn breeze made everything bearable and cool, there was no cloud in sight and everyone was having fun. The kids were running and screaming in delight, being led by Peter on a treasure hunt, the adults were sitting and exchanging stories and food, laughing and joking with each other; Bucky was hiding behind Steve for protection against his mother who vowed she will kill him for hiding the secret of him dating Natasha for years without telling her.
! I brought you dinner from your favorite place!" Steve's cheerful voice made Tony squeak and dove under the table once more, trying to hide from Rogers who seemed to waltz inside the workshop without needing permission from Tony. "Oh, who are you?" Rogers asked when his eyes fell on Rhodey, Tony's eyes widen when he saw Rhodey tilt his head when his eyes fell on Rogers, and dread filled him when Rhodey stood up to give his hand to Rogers in a handshake.
Steve grips Tony's hips tight enough to bruise and worked himself back up to a steady pace, until he's fucking into Tony with thrusts that rock Tony back into their bed of pillows, eliciting a lewd, wet sound each time his hips slap into the back of Tony's thighs. Tony feels himself clench again as his body produced another gush of slick, trickling out of his stretched rim while Steve's pulling out. "Oh, fuck…" Tony breathes, sounding as ruined as he was feeling.
So Steve sat beside the Omega pulling him in his arms once more, waiting for the Omega to cry himself to sleep, and when the Omega passed out, Steve carried the young man their bed, letting him sleep while holding into the blanky with all of his strength, Steve's eyes becoming sad when they felt on the letters sewn into the blanky…
"What year did you die?" That was Natasha who took a step toward Steve? It was kind of getting confusing to call that man by the name Steve when their Steve was coming any minute now.
…" Anton winced when he heard that, which caused Jamti's eyes to widen before the other Alpha let out a sigh. "Really Anton? How foolish can you be? For an Alpha who plans on courting his intended Omega, you did a wonderful job of driving the Omega away." Jamti sighs and shook his head causing Anton to furrow his eyebrows in confusion.
Tony shivered as the voices echoed in his head, getting louder and louder, causing his breath to hitch. Tony curls around himself, hoping to wake up soon from this cruel nightmare, hoping that the cold and emptiness will leave him. It made Tony wonder, how can he have a nightmare and still realize it was one? Tony never had a strange dream like that before.
It was a wonder how Steve managed to pull this off, a grin taking over his face when Steve reached the gardens that were empty at this time of the day. Breathing hard, Steve looked around once more to make sure that no one was following him before he wheeled himself to the exit; after a few tricky twists and turns in the gardens, Steve managed to reach the exit gates, his breathing was harsh and his grin was wide now he was a few minutes away from freedom.
Because something inside Steven snapped, something ugly reared its head, and then Steven was screaming at the woman with so much hate and pain he bottled down for decades. "What the fuck are you doing here? Didn't you do enough?!" And then followed by so many curses and threats, that the woman was left shaking in the corner, by then everyone rushed to see what Steven was doing and it took Peggy and Natasha to pull him away from the woman before he stabbed her in the eye.
It was only a few seconds before Peter was pulled away from him, which caused the scream to be trapped in Steve's throat. The star wanted to scream and rage and let loose, but his body, his damn stupid body! "Let me go!" Peter screamed, fear and pain in his voice, and Steve, Steve raged!
As Tony was saying, what Tony doesn't accept was his friends trying to off him, why? Well, ever since the news of his engagement came out (With photos) everything had gone down, literally and figuratively. When the words got out because of those crazy women, who tried to seduce Steve, the hall went crazy, trying to corner Tony and threat him to leave Steve (Hell, even General Ross glared at him with a subtle threat, EEEWWW!) all in all, by the end of that night everyone in New York, no! In all of America, knew about Tony being engaged to Steven Grant Rogers the original Captain America and one of the four heirs to the Addams fortune.
Steve sobbed as he heard the Italian accented voice of the AI call by that name. Long-time ago, when Steve married his love, he wanted to change his last name to Stark, to tell his love that he loves and adore him too much to care about last names, but unfortunately, Fury refused, saying the world needs Steve Rogers more than they needed Steve Stark, his Tony had looked so crushed but agreed with Fury. He was so happy to hear someone call him that, especially in a voice that resembles Maria Stark's (He spent a lot of nights going from video to video from Tony's childhood that he would never forget her voice) Steve cough a little and wince taking a deep breath. "S… a-activate... th-e mis... missile…to h-here..." Steve stuttered, making the AI paused if that was even possible...
As you all know I also published two new stories, the first one called 'A Little Place Called Home' it's a Stony Omega-verse, if you want heartbreak, hurt/comfort, and family feels then this is your story.
"W-when did you g-get this?" Peggy asked with a cracked voice, making Steve look at her to see her looking at Steve with glassy eyes full of unshed tears. "Please! When?" Peggy plea making Steve take a step back and swallow.
The Omega sat on the bed after letting go of his babe, sleep refusing to came to him, making the Omega let out a shaky breath, covering his baby in furs before he stood up, walking on silent feet, not making any noise as he took a step after step, planning to go to the fire pit that warm the house and prepare a herbal drink to soothe his frayed nerves.
Moving his left leg around, Tony discovered that there was no pain there anymore, no hurt, and no dislocated bones grinding and hurting Tony. That did nothing but pull a soft smile from Tony as he started walking toward the front door, already planning something crazy in his mind. Reaching the outside, Tony's breath left him as he found Rogers in the lake, his head peaking around the surface as his gaze was taking the house in… taking Tony in.
Grandma Addams huffed, causing Steve to wince, and for the rest of his family to give an annoying sigh at the older ghost statement, Grandma Addams was still a traditionalist at heart, hating every normal because they will never and could never understand the true Addams way, she was still angry at his mother for changing her name into a more normal name and marrying one of them; she was even angry that his Ma gave him a normal name.
Johann continued yelling and being ignored for Gods' know how long (Though from glancing at the window, Steven saw that it was sunset) before something actually happened, the throne room's gigantic wooden door swinging open to allow passage to an entourage of new Vikings Steven had yet to see, and that had Johann shutting up almost immediately, and that by itself gained Steven's respect toward the people who entered the room.
"As you wish…" Steve murmured before leaning down, kissing Tony like his life depended on it, as for Tony he didn't even push Steve or pull away from him; after all, why would he do that when he already sold his soul to the devil in exchange for gaining the justice he always wanted but everyone refuses to give it to him. Suddenly it doesn't seem so bad being trapped with someone who would never hurt him…
"Are you alright?" Jamti's voice made Anton blink his eyes and turn to his friend, without really seeing him; it took Jamti repeating the question twice before Anton realized that his friend was looking a breath away from panicking and calling Magna, which will end with an even more disaster.
The two of them walked out of the workshop, Anton planning on finding a way to end this Gods-forsaken matchmaking, and Magna going with Anton over what he should do and what he shouldn't, stressing the subject of not killing Tyber until proven guilty. Ah, if only Magna wasn't mated to Jamti, at least then Anton would have mated her, but he couldn't do this to his friend, subjecting her to live her life with a husband who was pining for a dead Omega for all he knows.
"Don't flatter yourself; a lot of realms out there are more advanced than Midgard, for them, what you are doing is nothing but a child play." Steve grin widened when he was the beginning of a pout taking its place on Tony's face. "Did you know that if you made your armor with a mixture of symbiotic and biological materials, you will not only get the strongest armor there is but the lightest one as well? Mainly because in the normal state, the suit will be in liquid form, but for psionic command, it will fit your body and solidifies." Tony's eyes widen and his jaw dropped on the floor when the words Steve said made sense to him.
Currently, everyone was heading to the Stark's mansion, Peggy and Angie decided to go earlier to prepare the house for Tony's arrival, they, of course, were led on by Jarvis who wanted everything to be perfect for when Tony and his pup were back, that left Howard and Maria, who wanted to be there for when their son and grandson discharged, Pepper and Rhodey were working, but the two of them promised to be there before sunset, though Pepper did threat her mate Happy (The Starks' driver, which shocked Tony the first time he heard it that he nearly faint.) that if he let anything happen to Tony, she will skin him alive, all in all, everything was turning out fine.
In this video Rogers was actually in a bright room full of a childish cartoon drawn on the walls, children's music playing in the background, and a lot of stuffed toys of all shapes and sizes and cuteness were in the room. The Winter Soldier was huddling in the middle of the room while hissing and trying to thrash away from the Hydra agent that was combing his hair while singing him songs that were meant for little babies. Everyone could see how pale Rogers was, and the dark circles surrounded his eyes told them that the man didn't have a good night's sleep in weeks.
Steve the mean bad husband, only chuckled and leaned down to kiss his cheek, ignoring how Peter screamed 'Eww!' and gaged, while Harley scrunched his nose and gave them a judgmental look. "What Tony meant to say is… in a few more months another family member is going to join us…" That made both Harley and Peter still looking at Tony and Steve with the confused looks (Peter) and blank ones (Harley) which made Tony a little concerned. "Tony is pregnant," Steve said, which made Peter's eyes widen before he squealed, jumping off his seat and rushing toward Tony, taking a mile in a second, giving Tony a little whiplash trying to make sense of what his son was saying.
"It's alright. I won't move." Steve murmured comfortingly into Tony's ear after breaking the kiss. The Omega pressed the side of his face against Steve's and let one of his hands join Steve's between his legs. He touched a finger to the place where Steve was resting in him and shuddered. Then he pushed it in alongside Steve's. He wrapped the rest of his fingers around Steve's hand and moved them together; In and out.
"My husband loved dancing… we used to dance in a private garden every date night," Steven finally shared with Tony. The young man looked down, causing Steven to pause before turning the subject to something lighter. "Say, where are the high heels you always wear? Tony squeaked at that, looking at Steven with shock and betrayal.
"Do you think that saying sorry will cause everything to go back to how it was?" Steve asked glaring at Harley who pouted and looked down; the kid probably thought that if he just apologized everything will get magically better. "Harley, you ran away! Not only did you endanger yourself but you also made everyone worry sick about you!" Steve snapped, letting out a sigh and curse internally when he saw Harley flinch. "Did you not trust us? Did not trust me? Is that why you ran away?" Steve whispered biting the inside of his cheek when he saw how Harley's lips trembled like he was about to start crying any second now.
But never once in Tony's life, was he prepared for what he saw… where he was expecting to see bunches of rocks and stardust, there was a man who was passing out… a handsome man... but a man nonetheless, a man with blond hair and was wearing blue, red, and white robes like they were in some type of fairy tale and he was a king or a knight or something… most likely a knight prince, because damn! Did you see those biceps?
"Am I finally dead?" A hoarse voice asked making Steve straighten in his chair looking at the Omega who was looking at him tiredly, too tired to care if he was dead or not.
A whimper left Steve when he noticed many doctors and nurses around, him, trying to tell him something; Steve was too lost in panic and loss to hear a word of what they said, trying to jerk his arm out of one of the doctors, trying to scream at them and demand they bring his baby to him. No sound left his throat, causing him to let out a rushed breath of distress, tears gathering in his eyes when he saw the doctor bringing a needle full of some fluid before sticking it in his arm. It was a few seconds later that everything went dark and Steve lost his consciousness.
?" Steve asked in a soft voice gazing at Tony with soft eyes; that made Tony scowl mainly because his heart started pounding like a crazy bird in his chest that wanted to be let out. Swallowing Tony's eyes darted around the place until they stilled on the bar in the far end of the room, it was true that Tony stopped drinking ages ago, but if Tony played his cards right, he may gain a few minutes to gather himself before having to interact with Steve again.
"Hey, sweetie why don't you go and play?" Pepper said after she and Tony sat on the bench that looked over the playground, which made Megan squeal and run toward the swings. Tony and Pepper ends up spending the afternoon of their day off talking about the company, about everything that crossed their mind. "When are you going to seek happiness, Tony?" Pepper asked gently making Tony pause at that.
"You are awake…" Peggy said, and Steve mind was still too groggy to notice the coldness in Peggy's voice, the older man just hummed and tried to lift his arm only to stop by his hand being shackled to the bed.
Tony wondered in the back of his mind if he was going to die, he wondered if everyone was going to forget about him just like how they forget about Ty. "M… my M-Morgan…" Tony's breath hitched, he couldn't hear anyone, no sound was heard after Stane's terrified scream of pain disappeared, and Tony wondered if he was left alone… he doesn't want to die alone. A cold hand touched his feverish cheek, and Tony couldn't help but shiver at the coldness as his head was turned to the side. Blue, so blue, it looked so blue, these eyes that were gazing at him… it was the only thing Tony could focus on when he gazed at the person in front of him. "S-save her… save… m-my M-Morgan." Tony plea, hoping that whoever was holding him in their cold embrace will listen and save his baby, even if it meant that he will die, he wants his baby to survive.
After meeting Goose who took a shining to Tony and Peter, Tony then was led to his room then he finally met Dum-E (Though Tony screamed Dummy which made Steve blink and look at the robot like he was some traitor) and JARVIS which made Tony smile happily when the AI told Tony that Steve took care of them in his absence, all in all, everything was perfect, it made Steve hope, which was something strange as he seemed to have lost hope in the past five years.
Whatever warning Edith gave them, didn't prepare any of them to the sight they would receive, fear starts taking grip of them and their breathing was trapped in their lungs, too chilled to do anything but gaze at the carnage that was taking place in front of their own eyes, their eyes didn't blink at the red that covered the walls, their ears still continued to reverberate from Steven's brutal laugh and roars after every kill he carried out, and the song he chanted, made their blood freeze in their veins as it echoed in their minds over and over again.
"W-wha… what do you mean Steve? Of course, I will be here for our son." Tony said as closed the door behind him and rushed to Steve's side, from the shocked voice the Alpha used, he probably didn't expect Steve to talk to him like that, which was so funny now Steve think about it.
Imagine Tony's surprise (not really) when he heard an ear-piercing scream coming from the kitchen. Natasha's, if Jarvis was right (which his AI was always right) and Tony should have known that the criminal was no one other than Rogers.
…" The second part of Howard's speech, informed Steve that the man was talking with himself, not really paying Steve any attention, which normally will make Steve go on and on about disrespect.
and then he would be forced to return home or worse, in hope of stopping the scandal that was going to take a place. A pregnant Omega without a mate? He would better kill himself than be at the world's mercy.
"What's… what's his name?" Tony finally dared to ask, shaking in his place, wondering what kind of name that the Parkers choose for his baby, did they think about the name for a whole year like Tony? Going from baby book to baby book, walking nervously in his place as he wonders what kind of name his pup would like? Did they hold the babe gently in their arms as they whispered his name for him? Just like Tony always imagined doing.
." Steve stated, turning Tony to face him even when the genius wanted to look away, but at least it was the first time that Steve apologizes to him… sincerely. "I just thought that you will be more acceptant, Bucky was." Steve tried to explain, getting an eye roll from Tony who let out a groan at the admission; of course, Bucky was!
"Papa!" Peter squealed as he saw Steve arranging his pillow on the floor and run toward the Alpha throwing himself in Steve's arms purring happily when the Alpha hummed and start running his hand through the pup's hair.
"They seem like good people…" Howard started, getting a happy laugh from Tony as his son stood up, taking the rest of the plate with him putting them in the dishwasher after cleaning them; it was only a few minutes before Tony was back, two mugs of steaming coffee in his hands.
The sky was overcast, sending down a light drizzle of rain; Tony walks up the trail to the main road, his umbrella in hand, seeking to stop himself from running in excitement at the prospect of finally meeting Pepper and Rhodey again. The little parking lot across the road is empty, and Tony zips up his coat and hides under his umbrella while he waits. The trees around him shudder, sending down a flurry of dead pine needles. Tony’s heart skips a beat and he glances up, hoping to see a woodpecker or maybe a falcon. There is nothing there; and Tony sigh in exasperation, hating how stressed and restless he was these days.
A few months later, Steven finally woke up, to find the Avengers in his recovery room sleeping on any surface available. He ended up nearly choked to death with how tight he was hugged by Tony and everyone else. A few months passed and the first anniversary of Tony and Steven arrived; to Steven's shocked, it was Tony who proposed to him, using the same rings that Steven gave to his husband in his universe.
Most of the time Tony would literally melt in his place when he sees the Alpha dot on his baby, and Peter will beam like the sun, always following the Alpha if he wasn't with Tony trying to learn something new, and the Alpha was all a sport about it and never complained even encouraging the pup to come to him all the time.
"Why?" Tony choked out after he managed to dislodge the piece of bread that made it its mission to choose the wrong pipe and kill him; other than his shocked and annoyed reaction and Steve's happy cheers, all of the Avengers had a horror look on their faces as they tried to protest one way or another to change Serpentine's mind, as for Bucky, the man looked ready to commit genocide, and no doubt the first target on his list was Tony.
Steve frown at Tony, making the inventor bristle at the look he was receiving, the only thing that stopped Tony from throwing Steve out was the sad anguish in the star's eyes, it made Tony stump, why was the star looking at him like this? "Sounds like a cold world, Tony," Steve stated in glancing at the screen with a frown, causing Tony to take a deep breath trying to calm down.
The rest of the Avengers were all sitting in different places, bickering about whose turn it was to choose the movie, so far the fight was a tie between Bucky and Peggy, the later wanted to watch a romantic movie, while as usually Bucky was all about action, explosions, and guns, the rest of the Avengers were cheering them on causing Tony to groan at how uncaring his friends and family were, letting Tony and poor Peter handling all the food relating issues.
"Who are Björn and Hvítur Úlfur?" The king asked instead of answering, his words causing Steven's breath to hitch and for him to look away, his heart pounding inside of his chest as he bit the inside of his cheek, hoping that what he heard was nothing but his imagination; no one, no one other than his people knew about these names... or stories as Steven liked to think of. "You were calling those names when you were asleep… are they the name and title of James's…" The king asked his words trailing at the end like he doesn't know if he should continue the question or drop the matter altogether.
"I think that I should introduce myself… since we're neighbors and all. My name is Tony Carbonell… nice to meet you I guess?" Tony looked at the lake, a place so small and still and tucked away that it doesn't even have a name. "I don't know what to call you, but what do you think about Rogers? Like the old owners of the house?" Tony knew he was rumbling but he couldn't help himself, the air around him turned cold which made the teen shiver and rushed inside his house, not sparing another glance at the lake… if he did he would have noticed…
Steve no longer slept with them in Tony's room, he no longer ate meals with them. He no longer took Tony and Peter out or sparred with Tony, teaching him how to fight. The longest the Omega saw him was five minutes, and that was when the man was heading to SHIELD. It was draining, it made Tony hate himself, made him want to explain everything and anything to the Alpha, but the thing was, the man was never home. He was never there anymore, spending all of his time at SHIELD, and when the Omega tried to ask his father or Aunt Peggy about him, the two of them always changed the subject.
"But… it's leaves?" Peter murmured getting a kiss from his Mama causing him to purr at the affection he was receiving from the Omega. "I don' understand…" Peter ends up saying with a pout as he turns to his Papa, it was very confusing! His Mama told him only trees have leaves, but his Papa said that this thing wasn't a tree but a bush! It made Peter confused, and he hates being confused, what is a bush even? Probably some evil sticks stealing the pretty leaves when they fell from the trees, he doesn't want to look out of the window anymore. With that Peter made a grapy hands at his Papa, which to his delight made the big Alpha look at his Mama for some reason but it ends up with Peter in his Papa's lap, though as soon as he felt his Mama's hand through his hair, he starts purring uncontrollably, which made his Mama coos and purr, and he started feeling sleepy, which made him yawn and snuggle into his Papa to get more comfortable…
Getting out of the house, Steve was greeted by the sight of Ban and May, the two of them were ready to get inside the house; Ben was holding his shotgun in his hand while May was holding a bat. Both of them had a scared look on their faces. When May and Ben’s eyes fell on them, May let her bat fall as she rushed to him, pulling him in her embrace as she sobbed, letting out a choked gasp when she saw the bruise on his jaw and the marks on his neck, Steve was grateful she hadn’t comment on his clothes that were ripped and dishevel from the fight.
"Anton, they are here…" Magna stated, disgust coloring her tone informing Anton of who she was talking about; those simple few words caused rage and hate to war inside Anton and the Alpha wondered if he could just say fuck it and kill Tyber for once and for all, ending all of his sufferings at once. A low and dangerous growl left him, causing Magna to sigh but stay with him in his workshop, probably waiting for him to gather himself. "I know you want to kill him for being an oath breaker, but right now, it is the queen's words against Tyber's, and you know how many people follow that weasel," Magna said, causing Anton to curse his people for how stupid they were sometimes.
"Thank you, Mr. Stark, for stopping the kidnapper." The Alpha said which made the Omega look down and nod his head. "Come on Mr. Stark I am sure you want to return home." The Alpha said which made the Omega look at the watch then around the place looking for someone.
He doesn't need someone on his land, he doesn't need another person that will end up hurting him, he doesn't need someone screaming at him and saying the words
A voice called out desperately and the Omega wondered why the voice sounded like it was coming from under the water… or maybe it was Steven who was underwater? But everything sounded so fainted when all Steven could hear was the sound of his crying and weeping Omega as its voice increased making Steven's head throb painfully like it was about to split open, which didn't seem to matter to him anymore, because when darkness finally embraces him…
Steven could only smile at that and shake his head at them grunting in faux annoyance when Thor raised him for a hug, talking about Steven being a true Asgardian or something like that, which made the man roll his eyes and try to pat Thor's arms away so he can be put down.
So today was the day. The day that Tony tried to avoid for many months, but had accepted as what it is; today was the day that Tony had dreaded and anticipated for months and months now. Today was his wedding day. It was so funny that Tony thought about it now, it was so funny for him to remember that he spent months trying to avoid this wedding, thinking that he would end up doomed and cursed by marrying Steve. It was laughable thinking about it now, because when Tony finally opened his eyes after the unsavory incidents that kept happening around him; he realized that Steve really liked him and wanted what's the best for him.
In Howard and Peggy's year of absents, Steve learned that Hydra was not gone as they all had thought, Steve learned that the thing he fought against, lost Bucky for, nearly died because… was still alive. Steve wanted to rage, he wanted to kick and punch and break things… but he couldn't. As much as Steve wanted to be involved with the investigation of Hydra, Peggy and Howard had forbidden that, least Steve ruins their cover. So, in the end, Peggy gave the mission to one of her spies that she trained and trust, his name was Fury, an energetic boy in his mid-twenty, Steve met the young man, as much as he didn't like someone else taking his mission, he told Fury to be careful. He also met another one of Peggy's spies, Coulson… a kid with huge hero worship for Captain America… the kid nearly screamed his head off when he saw Steve walking with Peggy to meet Fury, Coulson, and Maria, the youngest of Peggy's spies… Coulson didn't let go of Steve's legs until Steve signed his cards…
