“So what’s your plan?” Natasha says.  “Take on the entire New York mob outfit single-handedly?  Sounds like suicide.”
“Hi,” Steve said.
And it’s not until Steve’s cleaned up the Shake Shack detritus and said goodbye to Sam and gone back to Brooklyn that Tony realizes that maybe, just maybe, Steve was
obvious and walk right past.
Tony snorts.  “Right.”
“I’m not sure yet,” Stark says.  “Rogers, what’s your plan?”
“You know how it goes,” Tony says, and Nicola smiles at him, more real this time, because she does.
"Rogers!" Odinson booms as Steve slides in between a couple of ladies who are sipping martinis.  "Good to see you!"
“‘Alien’ is actually somewhat offensive, you know,” Thor said.  “Where I’m from,
“You?  Never.”
“Tony,” Steve said weakly.
“I’m going in,” Rogers says.
It’s dumb, Tony thinks as he sits around the big conference table in between Peter and Wanda, it’s
“We live together and I didn’t realize it,” he clarified.
“We’ve had some run-ins.  You sure you want to go in there?”
Banner takes a swig of tonic water.  "I'm not sure what you're looking for, but you should know that my connections to - certain people aren't what they used to be."
“We could always use more,” Steve says from the couch.
But when he got back to the table it was empty.
game of baseball was that everyone had a different idea of what was and wasn't "fair play".
“I’d love to,” Steve says.  “Hey, Happy.  Tony.”
"Might've worked if Rogers was here undercover, but considering he's off the clock, that'd raise a lot of questions," Stark chimes in.  "Anyway, Aldrich's paid off half of City Hall.  He could have somebody stabbed in front of the Chief of Police and he'd walk out with his nose clean."
Clint threw up his arms.  “Is nothing sacred anymore?”
Afterwards, they lay on top of the white Hotel Collection bedding and catch their breath.  It's the middle of the afternoon; Steve realizes, belatedly, that Tony was in a suit when he arrived, which means he was possibly doing something important before he got Steve's text.
“Cap,” Tony says.
Eventually, Steve realized with a growing certainty, they wouldn’t talk about anything at all.
“For some value of trust,” Romanov rectifies.  “The nice thing about the mob is that they know everybody’s got ulterior motives, and they don’t much care what yours are as long as they get what they want.”
And -
"What do you think of him?" she murmurs, holding out a cigarette for Thor to light.
“And sometimes if I am, he feeds my kid breakfast?”
“Maybe we should talk about your fashion sense,” Tony said.  “That’s already an embarrassing topic for you, how much worse can it get?”
“This conversation is not happening,” Tony said miserably.
year for a man who likes to make his living serving drinks to come to America, but it could be worse."
"Over my dead body," Romanov says.  She ducks under a bodyguard's swing and snags his wrist, then twists his arm behind his back.  "Clint?"
Tony wipes his feet on the mat at the front door.  He hadn’t noticed much about Strange’s weird, dusty brownstone last time he’d visited, what with Bruce back and Thanos on the way and the world about to, you know, end.  He’s about to comment on how weird it must be to live in the lobby of a haunted hotel from the 1920’s when he’s hit with what feels like a very strong but very localized tornado.
“Yeah, because I’m trying to skirt the issue in case I’m reading this completely wrong,” Steve said.  “Give me a break, will you?”
“Sorry, Lang, you’re breaking up,” Tony says, and hangs up on him.  “Technology, am I right?”
“Considering you
Steve stared at him.  “What the hell is that supposed to mean?”
live together and I didn’t notice.”
“Sure, takeout menus in the second drawer from the top.  You thinking Chinese?  I could go for - ”
“Kiddo, Cap’s busy, it’s a long drive, he doesn’t have time to - ”
Steve, who is sitting as far from Tony as he can get while still being at the same table, says, “I’m not anybody’s boss.  I’m more like a supervisor.”
“You don’t need to be here,” Steve murmurs for the tenth time.
“Yes, I do want, not that it matters because apparently we already
“Well, Jonah, I‘m not the only one thinking it,” Beck says.  “In fact, I’m announcing exclusively, just for your viewers, that the Department of Justice is about to announce that they have opened up an investigation into Tony Stark’s involvement in the Blip.  And frankly, Jonah, I think a lot of people are going to be very surprised by what they find.”
“Coulson seemed like someone we could trust,” Odinson proclaims.  “And I have an eye for it.  I had you made in under a minute, if you’ll recall, Rogers.”
wipe away five years from the people who Blipped, all because I was selfish and couldn’t risk disappearing my kid - ”
“Because it sounds like you’re accusing me of - ”
"I've gotta go," Banner mumbles, backing away from the bar.
“I can make nachos,” Natasha said.
.  He’s not sure he likes it.  “Well, you know.  You can make it work.  If you want.”
.  We can all agree it was a feast.  I won that one, in the end.”
Tony’s skin goes hot.  “What’s that supposed to mean?”
“Oh,” Clint said.  “What if he had some of Thor’s special liquor?”
“How’d it go?” Tony says.
“A couple backroom deals here and there, sure, but nothing major that I’m aware of,” Steve says slowly.
Back in New York after the night in Florida, Steve works out and leads neighborhood meetings in Brooklyn and leaves leftovers in the fridge for Nat and goes with the National Guard when they need extra hands in Houston or Detroit or Portland.  The riots have quieted down, for the most part, but there are still periodic food shortages and Steve's been on tour before, so it feels familiar enough.  Someone in Reno throws a hot coffee back in his face when they realize who handed it to them, and Steve wipes his face on his shirt and hands a coffee to the next person in line while local law enforcement drags the woman away.  She keeps screaming at him until she's all the way out the door.
CNN plays the clip of him falling out of the sky on repeat.  Fox News finds some Jersey local to claim she was the woman who Tony brought back to his room, and that he was blackout drunk when he went to fight the fire elemental, which “quite clearly put the public in even more danger”, as several commentators point out.  J. Jonah Jameson has a field day with “exclusive” footage from the scene, which is completely doctored and surprises Tony not in the slightest.
“You think you’re right about
“It’s a long story,” Tony says, and points at Peter’s ear. “Gimme.”
to outrun that, just like you don't deserve anybody's forgiveness, like you don't deserve for Natasha to even
"Not yet," Odinson says.  He slides Steve a glass across the bar as, in the corner, a three-piece jazz band starts warming up.
“Didn’t you once tell me you started drinking when you were 13?” Steve says, arching an eyebrow.
and knocks.
Heading out of the apartment, she pauses and looks back, noticing approvingly that he hasn't moved from his frozen position. "Think about it," she says.
“We weren’t expecting so many people,” one of the men says.  The light gleams off his sawed-off shotgun, and Steve suspects he’s Ivan Vanko.  “I’m not a fan of uninvited guests.”
“Who’s next?” Clint said.  “Natasha, do I hear you volunteering?”
Steve breathed in, breathed out.
“Long time no see,” Tony says.
“Peter once went out with a girl whose dad was trying to kill him.  Like, unrelatedly, though.  Long story.”
“Yeah, so was I,” Tony said.  “What about you?  Anybody special in the picture?”
“ - and I just, are you ever going to let
The answer, it turned out, was “enough” - baseball caps did a lot of heavy lifting for high schoolers - and before long Tony was rushing Steve, Bruce and Clint into the back of a Range Rover and thanking the god of scheduling it wasn’t Happy’s day off.
Tony raises his eyebrows.
Steve ducked his head and went a little red in the face which, oh no, that was
familiar with the rulebook but I’m pretty sure there’s nothing
“I’m good,” Tony says, and watches as Peter slides in between Ned and Wilson at the food table.
It wasn’t anything Steve hadn’t thought before, but hearing it in Tony’s voice was especially galling.  “Fuck you.”
“I want to make you come,” Steve murmured against his mouth.
“I’m definitely not qualified for this,” Tony said.  “Nobody has ever even left me alone with a plant, much less a bunch of
weird.”
“That argument doesn’t work for everything, you know,” Rhodey says.
,” Bruce said wonderingly.
Steve stifled a wince.  “Pretty much the same.”
Natasha arches an eyebrow.  “Already?”
The speakeasy at the bottom of the stairs is a lot like the ones he's seen before, though without all the bullet holes in the walls.  It's dusk, and though a few tables are occupied the bar's empty.
“Nope,” Fury says.  “Only a few witnesses, and all of them say the same thing - it showed up out of no where, destroyed their town, and then it was gone.”
to each other - ”
“Believe me, I don’t want to be here,” Tony says.  Around them, Jameson’s lackeys are setting up equipment all over the penthouse, bright stage lights and multiple camera angles; J. Jonah himself is across the room having his face powdered.  “But it’s my house, so, you know.”
They set up in Bruce's lab, with Natasha on standby in case they need to talk the Hulk down and everybody else behind the glass to observe.  Steve's got his shield on his back, just in case.
“Sometimes,” Steve says.  “Sometimes, maybe not.”
more in the way of direction.  Luckily for everyone, Tony doesn’t mind taking the initiative, he thinks as he slides down Steve’s body, stopping only to press a kiss against his ribs and taste the skin of his thigh.
“I don’t know, stop it?  Or maybe encourage it?”
Only a couple people get hurt, but the Rialto Bridge is seriously damaged and after the dozens of clear-as-crystal StarkPhone videos are uploaded to YouTube all the headlines ask: “So Where Were The Avengers?”
“What are you doing putting clothes on?”
Tony’s already had a few too many drinks when Nicola Blake saunters up to him and says, “Long time no see.”
"Password won't have changed?" Steve says with a half-smile.
“You’re a dear, Edgar,” Natasha said, flashing him a winning smile.
“I’m sure,” Rogers says dryly, and Natasha allows herself a smirk.  “Having a good night, Dr. Banner?”
Natasha doesn’t have a view around the bar, but she can tell by the footsteps and the air in the room that whoever it is brought a crowd.  She’s surprised: they’re not a mob-run joint, so there’s no reason for the Unit to send more than a clean up crew.
Stark sniffs and then pulls back.  "Funny," he says.  "You've been drinking all night, but I can't even smell it on you."
,” Steve says, and wraps one big hand around both of them.  They’re slick with Tony’s spit and Steve’s precome, and Tony arches forward, meets Steve on every thrust.  Steve keeps their mouths pressed together like he can’t breathe without Tony’s lips, takes Tony apart with his tongue, and when he comes he
“That’s because there aren’t many to share,” Steve says.  “When Thanos came back to earth to end humanity once and for all, we were able to delay him long enough to recover everyone who was lost.  Our base was destroyed in the process of taking down him and his army.  We lost good people that day.”
“Are you, um - do you swim?” Bruce said, looking a little flustered as he approached.
“It’s a shield?” Steve says.
With a roll of his eyes, Strange closes the door behind him.
“Because he cared about you,” Steve says, and Tony flinches.  “And he knew I cared about you too.”
“It’s not going to kill you,” Steve said, factually, because he couldn’t help himself.  “You’re wearing too many clothes.”
“It’s funny for
“You fucking
working for guys like that, you know.”
The kind of bad guys that they used to deal with back before Thanos - HYDRA, and the Abomination, and the Mandarin - all seem to be pretty quiet these days, but the creeping tendrils of corruption neatly fill the holes they left.  They get word of someone re-routing supply lines from upstate and track the rumor to a warehouse in Queens that's filled with black market weapons and gasoline and canned goods and manned by what seem to be mostly teenagers.
the right term for hooking up with a friend and colleague you were currently on the run with.  No pretending not to recognize each other in the elevator after this, that was for sure.
“I’m learning to be,” Steve said.
“To the
“Where?”
Banner jumps slightly, and when he looks at Steve he ducks his head.  "Who are you?"
Tony turned back to his tools and picked something up at random.  Ah, a blowtorch. Perfect, he could light himself on fire.  When had he become a 12 year old girl who couldn’t stop talking in front of the boy she liked, and also, when had he decided he officially liked Steve?
“At the moment, or like, existentially?” Tony said.
“He tagged out,” Steve says.
“So you’ll do it?” Tony said.
“So what comes next?”
Natasha walks upstairs, slowly, pausing on the first floor to take the temperature of the slow-simmering argument between the married Ukrainians who keep--and sleep in the back room of--the deli that is her business's (admittedly thin) disguise. It sits on top of her bar like a cheap hat, cocked over the eye of the entrance, and to a certain eye, draws attention to what's below. That's fine. Natasha made a choice, a long time ago, between discretion and brazen outlawry, and she's never once regretted that choice. Besides, make a speakeasy too subtle, and the drunks can't find you.
Steve shot him a glare.  “Right,” he said tersely.  “All right, team, get cleaned up and meet back here in thirty minutes.”
“Show me,” Tony says.
Steve feels his false smile slip a little.  "I wouldn't mind having a chat with him.  Do you know where he is?"
didn’t want to know any additional details, “hair removal”.
“I deserved that,” Tony said.
"Could you get me in?" Steve says.
“Why didn’t you call me?” Steve asks.  “I wouldn’t have stopped you from trying to draw Beck out.  I would have gone with you.  We all would have.”
to be told you could openly stare at Steve but only if you actually looked past him.
“Are you sure?” Peter asks.
“Nothing,” she says.  “Another drink, Mr. Stark?”
He trails off, because Steve’s staring at him, and Tony barely has time to think,
Steve looks at all the art he spread around his living room floor and sighs. He probably won’t even make it to a preliminary interview. So there is no need for him to get anyone else up in arms about his portfolio, right? Right. Least of all Iron Man.
“I can’t-” Steve ran a hand over his face, spreading the filth, “You shouldn’t have- You shouldn’t be here, Tony, please.”
So Tony laid down in his way too big bed, hiding under his soft duvet from the dimmed lights that he couldn’t escape from and thought about how it would have been if he stayed awake for a minute longer that night, to feel two hefty fingers dive into his mouth, over his tongue, inside his cheeks. How it would have felt to taste Ty’s blood and to know at that moment that he was dead. That the torment was now over, forever.
Lately he was suspicious of everything though.
Maybe it hadn’t happened that way. Maybe Tiberius Stone had gotten to hold his Omega’s hand until his untimely end and had now made his peace with it. Maybe Tiberius Stone had been ready to let go, the moment he shook Steve’s hand for the last time on that very porch. Maybe he hasn't looked back since.
Tony opens the door for Pepper, “So how was lunch.”
“I don’t want you to, uh, get the wrong impression with this. I really do give the last go on the art and design stuff, I- I am this game. I’m in this game. This has been- Well, you probably know that part, sorry. The thing is, the art department really liked your portfolio and they sent it to me with all the others because well, we are looking for a level designer and an environment designer. And I just recognized one of the arenas we had designed and it just looked good in your hand and I-”
There he was, sitting under a tree, scratching at a pad, head bent comically close to the paper. Tony could literally hear the blood rushing in his in his ears. He hadn’t planned any further than this. To be fair, he hadn’t thought he would ever get this far either. So he stood there, unseen, slowly growing colder and colder while a hurricane went on inside him.
Steve threw the porcelain dish full of ashes across the wall. It hit in a dull thud. Didn’t break. The burnt edge of the vanilla got sharper, acrid.
In the middle of the glistening fog, was a… Young boy, about the age of Tony. And he was the prettiest boy Tony had ever seen. His thin frame, combined with his light skin and hair, made him look like an elf. He wobbled on the toadstool he was sitting on. Tony reached to steady him, holding his hand. Blue eyes met his.
Actually, it’s a little refreshing. Tony has always been the weirdo in his relationships. He has no sleep schedule. He’s a billionaire, playboy (no longer), philanthropist. He talks to his home security systems and has a green energy company.
“And no one will question me disappearing because…” Tony took a big step back aligning himself with the island counter, Stone followed him in.
Steve sighs and goes to set out some vegetable scraps for the little rascal. He looks at the goose as it gobbles down the carrot peels, “You started this mess and you fix it!”
“Honk! Hooonk!!”
He pulled his head back into the house and by then, the smell was gone.
“Tony!” Steve scolds him and takes a huge sip of his drink. “Table manners.”
Steve looked away suddenly, Tony saw his jaw clench and tremble. He tried to scoot his armchair unsuccessfully.
He gets the email when still in school and he has to physically stop himself from screaming by putting both his hands over his mouth. His phone burns a hole in his pocket.
He continued, his voice shaky, “I had nothing to lose. Before you. I- Now, the thought of them touching a strand of your hair makes me want to bash their skulls in, God. Tony, now that I have you, I cannot lose you. That’s,” he kissed Tony’s cheek lightly, a complete contradiction to the vice of his arms around him, “that’s the only thing that scares me in the entire world.”
Steve turns to find a tall, ginger woman in an impeccable white suit waiting, “Yes, ma’am?”
Emboldened, Tony offered that they check out the apartment. They slowly walked, quiet, arms rubbing at every other swing.
“Congratulations?” He cocks his head for a moment, “What for?”
Tony put his hands into his hair, soothing, “Baby, Steve, lets go-”
“They could very easily write that I seduced my boss and frankly, I don’t care about either.”
“I have to talk to you,” damn it, not a great way to open conversation.
It’s not that hard to get the orbs. Steve racks them up pretty easily with the damage he’s doing. But now he is divided. Does he want to win? Or does he want the orbs? He shoots, “Okay, that’s thirty four. Is it always controlled by a human and is there only one of you?”
When Tony arrived at the apartment around five in the afternoon with bags and boxes in hand, Steve was gone. He placed the shopping bags by the door. He had bought whatever came to his mind; quality notebooks, pencils, a phone, a couple hoodies and stuff, he had guessed the sizes, he wanted to buy bottoms too but that was harder to guess. But that could wait anyway.
Steve shook. Adrenaline coursed through him. His eyes burned with unshed tears. Bile came all the way up to his throat, stinging but he pushed it back. His ribs hurt where he had flung himself onto the banister, pain pulsing with every breath he took.
I want to do that too, Tony doesn’t say. Instead he says, “It’s a robot, it doesn’t have feelings.” Steve steals another mini sausage from in front of him.
A mantra of I fucked up, I fucked up, I fucked up went over and over in his head. He should have stayed behind. He should have stayed in the shadows. Helped without getting involved. Done something selfless for once in his life but no, Tony had to go and be selfish again. He had to go and want him and lust after him like a creep and get himself on his knees in front of Captain America. For once in his life, he could have just been happy with what he had but no, he had to go and want more.
What was his plan, really? Tony and people didn’t really mix anyway. Just look at the people who did stick around. Ty, after his ass and money, trying to find a new blackmail material every single day, and if he couldn’t find it, he wasn’t any above creating it. Obie, who called Ty a bright boy, even after everything and had slowly detached Tony from SI, somehow.
For a while, he must have actually fallen asleep. When he came to himself with a jolt, the sun was setting, painting the curtains down in the living room a purplish blue. His ass was numb. His legs filled with static.
Unlike Steve, who had waited a little too long and worked a little too much and in the end he had his name and his illustrations but nothing fulfilling to come back home to.
Steve had loved the constant sun, the warmth, laying by the poolside in a hoodie. Tony had started calling him Toasty.
Back into the living room, Steve walks over to his boyfriend who has appropriately put away all the dishes in their respective places. “Hi, got all your stuff.”
“Thanks for calling.  I’m glad you showed me.”
much of an asshole?”
“I know what I said,” Steve said shortly.  “But I don’t want to hear it from you.”
have one.  I’m just a lonely billionaire with no one but my bots to spend Christmas with.”
When he opens his eyes again, he’s pretty sure it’s been more than five minutes.  He sits up with a frown.  “Friday?”
“Look, I don’t do that very often,” Steve said, “but I had a pretty good time last night.”
Maybe even earlier, if he’s honest with himself, which he isn’t, usually.
Steve adjusted the shield and straightened his cowl and walked straight up to Santa Claus, fat and jolly as always in his chair at the head of the room.  “May I?” he said politely.
Steve glared at him.  Tony tensed, and before he could blink the ball was hitting the fence behind him.  He glanced at his gauntlet; 148 MPH, but
“Because I’m not throwing an armful of plates at you!”
“Yeah,” Tony said.  “I know the feeling.”
“And there’s nothing I can do to change your mind.”
Pepper narrows his eyes.  “Of course not.  How could you
“Are you happy here?”
There is a long silence.  Everyone is thinking about what it would take, about how much and how little there is to say; about whether they could handle it themselves, if somebody did it to them.
?” Natasha said.
Natasha smirked.  “Three guesses.”
“Fuck you,” Tony says, “I’m not - appalled!  That’s the word.  I’m still
Steve leans back in his chair and tunes them out.  He’s pretty sure they can count it a success, all in all: Banner has a black eye, Tony’s wrist is singed from his armband, and Miss Romanov lost her hat in the commotion, but they got nineteen girls out of one of Vanko’s establishments.  Miss Romanov’s got them set up at a ladies boarding house across town, and Tony’s offered them all bus tickets home or jobs in one of Stark Industrial’s typing pools.
have?” Natasha asked with interest.
“Shit,” Tony says.  “All right, I’m going, I’m going right now.”
“Honestly, it would be great free marketing,” Clint said.  “Things have been a little slow this season.”
a swimming pool til a few years ago.”
Peter dives to the floor in the center of the room and catches, at the last possible moment, a priceless porcelain vase that Sam’s thrown for him to catch.  “That was a close one,” Sam says.  “You getting tired, Parker?”
But there is still an hour and then some until that can happen.
“If you bite me, and I mean it, even if you just, peck me a little, I’m taking you right to the butcher’s shop.”
He wasn’t going to back down now.
There stood the house, pale blue and behind a generic white picket fence. Up close and personal, it all looked pretty tame and ordinary to Steve. And frankly, a little bit tasteless but he had refrained from commenting, in the face of the other Alpha’s enthusiasm.
It didn’t work.
The sounds, he could take. The trepidation that never left him as long as he was in the house. The constant state of alert, in his own home, his sanctuary. But the smell. That whisper of a smell was going to drive him crazy.
“I mean like,” Steve does a couple solo attacks by tapping his mouse, “People can find out where you live and stuff. Doxxing happens. It’s just… There are too many things that could go wrong with being a public figure.”
Steve felt his lungs burning. Either his head swam from taking big gulps of air, trying to get some more of that smell in or his chest ached from a constant, conscious effort to try and take the smallest breaths, trying to shun the smell.
Inside, the acrid smell lingered. Steve opened all the windows, sitting in the living room with a blanket over his shoulders.
“I saw rats on the Christmas tree. One of them already knocked down the topper, I- Uh- Didn’t know what to do,” he looked at Tony’s tired face sheepishly.
“Sir, I believe pancakes are to be cooked.”
A smell, like vanilla gone bad, aromatic but with a sharp edge of something noxious to it came and went.
“I’ll mute you.” He threatens jokingly.
Iron Man comes “alive”- or more like online, at specific hours every day. Only a single player can fight him at one time. There is a waiting list. Every fight goes different. Every fight Iron Man has different tactics, different dialogues; sometimes even different visuals, making his hitbox larger or smaller.
“Yeah.”
All by himself.
He looks after the waddling white bum, slowly disappearing in the distance. Oh well, he has other screwdrivers.
Keeping a tab on Steve.
When he’s home, in front of the computer with a posture that would make orthopedicians cry, he’s TheCaptain. In the player communities, he’s kind of a big name. It’s not that he engages in the chats a lot. He knows firsthand how nasty they get. Still, everyone knows shit’s about to go down once TheCaptain logs in.
“You’re Iron Man,” Steve, after shaking hands, is still pointing at him with his right hand.
Steve.
“Just a second JARVIS, I know what to do,” Tony looked around the workshop with purpose, “Ah! Here we go,” he picked up a little case.
Tony pouts, “I have to go, class is about to start.”
Tony looks around and sees one of the colorful post-it notes that he has lying around. He balls it up and tucks it into his pocket. Then picks up their drinks and walks back into the garage.
It does. Several times.
The same woman that took their orders came with a little tray full with their drinks and warm croissants, dusted sugar starting to melt on them.
Different types of wall material, rocks, tiles, power-up crates, malleable obstacles… It’s a treat; both for his artistic side and gamer side. He recalls details from the one and only match he had with Iron Man. He remembers what he needed and when, he remembers what he could use to his advantage and what felt unnecessary. He leans back and gets to work.
They talked about Steve’s moving adventures first. Then his reasons; his Ma’s illness, losing her at the hospital and his best friend overseas and looking around Brooklyn to see pain everywhere. And in turn Tony told his own story, about leaving a busy life with three cities in one day, shareholder’s meetings, inventing with strict deadlines on endless budget that got quite unfulfilling really quickly.
He talked about Bucky and the Howling Commandos. About not wanting to come back to the States after the war was over. About actually going through with that plan, drifting around in Europe, lost in every sense of the word. Cutting ties with everyone, once he realized he couldn’t age. Coming back years later, dejected, to find out that everyone he knew was either dead or about to be.
Please be a rat, Steve thought. Please be a huge rat. A rat the size of my head.
He had hoped for a unicorn. Delicate and shy, white coat gleaming under light streaming through the trees. Or maybe, maybe a centaur! Strong and tall, looming over him. A wolf with thick fur, trotting right beside him, tipping his head up to Tony.
“Baby?”
“Dude,” Iron Man’s voice is incredulous in his ear, “You’re famous. Like, actually famous.”
And Tony, bitter about people he wouldn’t be able to bring back and battles he wouldn’t be able to win, now that Howard was dead, had let it happen.
Then came the test results for the blood samples from Ty’s face.
It’s a Wednesday. They are asking him if he can make it Saturday morning (because they remembered that he’s a teacher), but are open to rescheduling in work days. Steve’s hands shake as he writes the email back at home, saying that yes, he can come on Saturday.
His character design stuff left from the art school days don’t really fit The Avengers’ style or aesthetic. There are some unrelated videogame-y stuff he has done as personal projects but they just feel… Uninspired.
They keep on sitting at the table. It’s been hours and Steve feels like neither of them want to leave.
He didn’t know many things, to be completely honest. He looked down again. After doubting the truth under his nose for so long, so selfishly focused on himself, he owed Tony a happy ending.
Obie started talking the moment Tony tapped on accept. HIs tone was familiar. His worry was disgustingly familiar too. He recognized this voice and tone from way back. Had it always been this fake? Or was it Tony’s newfound distrust coloring his ideas. The call ended without Tony saying much about anything and Obie running over him with his words.
Steve laughs. Working for Stark Industries. Yeah. Sure.
Tony flopped down beside him on a lounge chair, “We’re really doing this Avengers thing, huh?”
He threw the shirt into the trash to be dealt with later, he would buy Steve a thousand more.
“Do you want to sleep on cardboard boxes?”
He looked around. The apartment was barren, other than the mattress. However it wasn’t dusty in a way that one would expect from an empty house. Someone had been living here. He got up and peeked through the open door to another room, a bathroom. There were still fresh droplets on the shower curtain. Tony turned the tap open. The water flowed clear. He washed his face, his mouth, then took a drink. The cool,stale water did little to settle the queasy feeling in his stomach. His head still swam.
The goose is waddling around in the open areas of his garage, its little orange feet making cute flapping sounds on concrete. But weirdly enough, it doesn’t seem to be stealing anything. On the contrary, it’s just… Waddling. Around. Hmm...
The Omega curled up even further into himself if that was possible. Steve didn’t want to touch him. That was a lie. Steve wanted to pull him in, apologize. Keep apologizing for the rest of his life for being so wrapped up in his own made up suffering to recognize Tony’s.
“I can’t- Tony, I’m not-” Steve took a harsh breath, his eyes hardened, suddenly focused, an almost animalistic expression appeared on his face, “I can’t control it, when I see things, when I hear people saying things like that- They would have done it too,” the hand that covered his face went up to his hair, pulling, “they can’t- They don’t deserve to live, they can’t- When everyone else is dying, they can’t-”
He had never understood though. Howard’s decades long obsession. Only now he was realizing that, maybe, Howard had suspected this. That Captain America was still alive. That maybe he couldn’t die.
Tony closes the distance between them and pulls him into a kiss, “You— I was going t—”
Steve screams. Tony screams. Dum-E… Well, Dum-E has no sound card.
“If this goes wrong, do you think we can blame Pepper?”
“You’re really Iron Man, oh God,” Steve wipes at his eyes, “How do you even find the time?”
He needs the opposite. Needs to think about what Rogers thinks of him. Which, from his reaction was when they met, isn’t really anything pleasant.
That wasn’t really a lie, was it?
Tony was sure there hadn’t been a plate when he woke up. Had he been that sleepy still that he hadn’t realized? It still bothered him. Nagged at him like a pebble in his shoe. He would have realized a platter with a cloche sitting on his side table, right? Right. Why would Obie lie about bringing food, even?
Steve sticks out his tongue at him.
As he placed his reference books and fantasy novels in the bookcases, he could almost imagine the sweet smell of an Omega wafting through the house, elusive.
“I heard you quit drinking since the accident, hm? If your psycho knight in shining armor hadn’t interrupted the little altercation between Ty and you, would you have quit just the same?”
A thought occured like lightning, sudden and terrifying with its force, how long until someone else figures it out.
“I- OH SHIT! You little- Well, I said what I said Cap, bring it on!”
“Yeah, he’s kind of… In pieces already. And, oh! We will need more trash bags.”
He carried his precious cargo into the kitchen. He didn’t open the lights, not wanting to shock the Omega’s eyes after God knows how long in that dark hole. He placed Tony onto the floor, positioning him so that his back was supported by the cupboard.
Steve expects to find himself in the lobby again or a clean slate on the map editor but no. Where he is, is the arena he just created. And Iron Man is right there. He fumbles for his headset immediately, plugging in the USB at the fifth try.
Steve shuddered, suddenly acutely aware of the hard ground underneath him, the wetness that had been seeping through his clothes.
“Well, congratulations babe.”
“JARVIS. Do we have pancake mix?”
Steve turns it around in his head. Maybe Iron Man is a much higher level employee, or maybe he is just… Too good at his job. Or maybe he just doesn’t care.
It was funny, looking through women’s forums about how cool water and ammonia would take blood out of sheets and fill up a tub with water to soak two different recently dead men’s clothes while his boyfriend, who was a legendary war hero, dismembered and bagged up one of them downstairs. Funny how easy it was to get hospital grade disinfectants over the internet and get them delivered to their door.
“It’s called being a Big Name Player and no, I am not famous; the nickname is.”
“You’re not eating, is everything okay?” Steve swirls his spaghetti around with his fork.
Yep. And Steve knows all of them, “Hit me with something different.”
“It has,” Tony stopped for a moment, “it has four actually. Also, your boyfriend is a tech genius babe, you don’t have to worry about nothing,” he winked at Steve.
Fuck.
Tony heard him shuffle on the other side. A flutter or pages. A zipper. Semi-slick, almost rubbery sound of dewy grass and mud under his shoes. Leaving. Don’t leave.
Steve blushes and sweeps Tony off his feet, causing the brunet to squeak, “Steve!!”
“Ugh, tell me about it.”
Steve insisted on carrying their dishes back on his way. While he was gone and Tony was paying, the cashier woman discreetly leaned towards him, “Look dear, I have known Steve for a long time but if he ever did-” she gestured to his exposed wrist.
“Oh no,” Steve slumped over him on the bed.
Had they treated him badly? Like a lab rat, rather than a human? It would be a shame if someone were to go and dig up dirt on government officials and then release it into the public but what could you do?
A tiny dot apears in the horizon. Steve‘s eyes lock onto it. It grows, rapidly, and there is only one thing that Steve knows flies so fast.
“I don’t want things to change either. And yes, maybe your position combined with mine will make things hard at times, a Crown Prince and- Well, me.”
It was like sinking into sleep at last. Steve closed his eyes.
Steve smirks, “I remember you asking for seconds.”
It’s weird. But it surely isn’t the weirdest thing that has happened throughout their relationship.
It only hit him once he let the door close after him, the bang echoing in the empty entryway, that the car hadn’t been there, that the mansion was too quiet for any of Obie’s show-off diners. Tony pressed his back against the door, unmoving.
Had he been trying to get a rise out of Tony? He found himself over analyzing everything Obie has ever said while laying in bed, waiting for exhaustion to do him in. Thinking about how he was somewhere in the house, right now, or in his own bed, sleeping soundly while knowing very well what Ty did.
And now there is no use to it. No use to keeping it secret. No use to the fighst and standing his ground because he is going to freeze to death. To death, he is sure of it this time.
Stone continued, “Mind if I ask how long it would have taken you to drown in your own vomit? Ty and I had a wager going on, you know. I was willing to give you some more time, no lie; but he had said five months tops until you managed to kill yourself. That was before someone caved his face in, of course.”
Then the crying started.
The elevator door pings open and Steve walks in, he slides his leather jacket off and turns to see Tony, with an apron on, nonetheless bent over the table as he places something down, he blushes and clears his throat. “Well, hi there mista—”
“I’m scared,” Tony whispered.
The lights bothered Tony since he came back to the mansion. It was like someone had put a film over his eyes that blurred out everything. It made him sluggish. Slowed down his thinking. But that newly discovered sense of sudden and boundless freedom never left his chest.
That, Steve doesn’t expect but also, he realizes he doesn’t know himself. Different how?
Well. What happened had happened and Steve should have apologized when he had the chance. But now, after so much time, it would be weird to go to the guy’s house and apologize.
And he had been right. His theory was proven. Captain America was really still here.
“Hey, you know, if you ever lose anything you can,” Steve can feel his blush rising, “well, call?”
“If I knew you’d get hung up on that low-key thing I said, I would have never said it.”
Stone screamed again, frenzied and cut off, but there was no one in the entire mansion to hear him. You and Obie made sure of that, Tony thought as he heard the bone give a wet crunch, thank you.
“It’s not like he can go anywhere.”
“Thank you, thank you. Well, yeah, I think I’ll be fine,” Tony looks at him with a clipped smile.
Obie had lifted his head from his papers, “Electrician? For what?”
He was a fucking idiot. The biggest idiot that had ever graced the earth.
“God, you’re not gonna believe this shit.”
“You never have just one idea,” he smiles at him, “it turns into a few ideas.”
Tony took in his face, barely there crow’s feet starting to settle around Steve’s eyes. One day Tony had found him in front of the mirror, late at night, smiling. He was periodically clenching and unclenching his face, eyes rapt on his own features.
Tony watches him through the door he left ajar. Steve gently pokes the screw down the table, then he pokes it with the tip of his shoe on the floor, watching it roll around with glee.
“Then?” Tony puts his hands into Steve’s hair.
It’s just that, sometimes it’s still hard for Steve to remember he has grown, both literally and figuratively, and possibly more than doubled in weight. He’s… Well, decent looking now. Not a scrawny little kid. On the outside, at least. Inside is a whole another matter.
Tony had made a noncommittal sound.
“That’s all Mr Stark. You’ll be hearing from us.” Pepper smiles and stands up to dismiss the rather dreary looking men from the room. They each exit one by one, chattering away, while Pepper maintains her composure till it’s just the two in the room.
There, in the barely foot wide gap in the wall was an Omega male, stick thin and dirty, curled up on the floor, trembling and weeping.
Steve laughs and kisses him, “So is that a yes? We can make it a competition.”
Tony’s head jerks right up as there’s a foot nudging his, “Won’t we, Mr Stark.”
“I should-  I should go wash my hands.”
still, reaching for the phone like it’s 2012
So, the first part of his plan had gone well. Tony took his phone from the nightstand and unlocked it. When Obie got him a debit card with an anonymous name on it, he probably hadn’t been envisioning this. He had one and so did anyone else with a name like Tony Stark. You wouldn’t want a name like that showing on your every internet purchase after all. And no one from the accounting would bat an eye if a couple of grands went missing on a lease and a cleaning crew.
And Steve, after being convinced that Tony wasn’t going to perish immediately in the middle of Central Park from a bruised wrist, suggested they go and find some ice.
He walked into the bathroom and checked himself over with a critical eye, now that the haze of the alcohol was finally gone. His face was scraped and bruised, his clothing was absolutely vile, he looked horrible. Perfect. I am sorry officer, I hit my head, you see, I don’t remember a thing.
He tried not to be dejected but… Well.
The point was that with one pair of ordinary jeans and a pair of sunglasses later, Tony was just a guy.
“Oh fuck, I can’t help myself, Tony, please, I can’t-” Steve let out a shaky breath, “I’m gonna hurt you, Tony, I can’t control it, please.”
“Ooh! That’s a cool one! I forgot that one was even in the game. Did you know that was one of the first attack power-ups ever created?”
Even though Tony was so out of it, he could still hear the music playing through the walls. People chatting and laughing, muffled but still there, a reminder that anyone could walk in on them, Ty and him. Just a single raised voice and someone could barge in. He wished so much that someone would barge in, headlines be damned.
“I wanted to do more, I-” Steve took a deep breath, rubbing his greasy fingers harshly over his eyes, “God, I wanted to just,” his hands clenched into fists, he presses them against his face.
“Cap? Caaap? You’re there right?”
He just needed a little break.
Tony doesn’t seem mollified by that. And frankly, it’s not like him to be so nervous about interviews. Not outwardly, at least.
“I think they know it’s me” had said Steve, his head hanging down in the dark.
“Oh no!” says Steve.
That had gotten Stone wistful, “I had built this house for my Omega initially. It was supposed to be a bonding gift, you know,” he had sighed, ”well…” He had gestured stiffly.
“Fuck,” he murmurs into his pillow.  His head hurts and his mouth is dry and yeah, the sex was great, sure, but god he hopes nobody saw them leaving together, for a number of reasons, including Pepper, and Morgan, and Rhodey, who will probably yell at him about how he’s too old to be sleeping with actresses who used to be ten years and are now fifteen years his junior, and, he thinks with a wince, oh yeah  -
“Because I am- Ugh- Involved? In the process of making these maps and arenas and such?”
Steve saw it was a pack of tranquilizer needles.
He let it fall to the floor, nearly missing his foot. The sudden thud of the hammer hitting the floor broke his petrified reverie.
The worst thing is that Tony Stark was as intimidatingly and effortlessly handsome as he remembered. Steve hadn’t been able to stop peeking at him as he gingerly taking off the ribbon around the goose’s neck. He had been in a black tank top; his slightly tanned and toned arms flexing as he fiddled with the bow. He had wiped his hands on an already grease stained fabric before opening the note.
Doesn’t mean he likes it though.
“That’s… Also a surprise. But it will just be the two of us, not, like, not a grand gesture, I mean, public and all.”
Central Park at 7AM was cold as fuck. No one would ever catch Tony outside at this hour. Or out of bed. It was more like bedtime for him, frankly. Tinker in the night, sleep through the morning, breakfast in the afternoon and repeat.
“It is. It really is.”
Steve’s voice had immediately gone cold, “What?”
Well, Pepper had been the one who handled everything from the beginning so she already knew but still. He deserved some credit for improving from his past duty shirking ways.
Tony snorted, “Like I’d let that happen.”
“No, I’m going to call you Tin Can.” Steve closes his mouth so quickly that his teeth hurt.
To Tony Stark.
So Tony had hugged him close, the hand, freshly wounded from the keys elevated, laying on his shoulder, bare skin touching from head to toe.
Outside, the sun was shining.
He just can’t put a finger on it though.
Did he know Tiberius from before? No. Where had he come from? New York. What was a big city boy like him doing here? Looking to slow down. Did he know what had happened in the house three years ago, oh God such a tragedy it had been. No he didn’t know. And frankly, I don’t want to either, Steve had wanted to say, but couldn’t have.
“Okay, first of all,” Tony said, “I’m so glad I died and then came back to life so I could hear you say those exact words, it was all worth it, and second of all, no, you don’t have to go back to the future.  You live here now.”
"Yeah."  Steve sweeps his tongue over the head of Tony's dick and feels Tony shiver.
“First of all, I’m thankful for these yams, obviously,” Tony said, helping himself to the last of the yams.  “Okay, what else?  Uh, I was all prepared to be kind of a dick about Thanksgiving, because as you know I don’t really do Thanksgiving.  And when I said I didn’t do Thanksgiving, I meant that I don’t do Thanksgiving on purpose, because I don’t like Thanksgiving.”
“Oh, don’t worry, I knew right away I wasn’t interested in sharing,” Tony dismissed.  “But then I realized… there just might be a solution.”
“Anything,” Tony blurts out, which is just a
Tony pulled away with a sly grin.  “Sorry about that.  It’s just that I met my childhood hero, and, well, you know.  Might not get another chance.”
Steve groaned again, like he had the first time Tony pulled his hair, and Tony may not have been a supersoldier but he could learn too: he pulled Steve’s hair again, harder, and Steve picked up the pace, his tongue sliding around the head of Tony’s cock.  When he looked up at Tony there was a
Steve glances at Pierce.  “You, sir?”
“As fun as all of those sound,” Steve said, “I was thinking that maybe I’d dare you to kiss me at midnight.”
“Feels wrong to be on vacation when Ultron is out there making plans to destroy us,” Steve said.
“He stops by sometimes and asks if you’re home.  Says he’s on his way to Miss Maximoff’s quarters or the gym, usually, but sometimes he leaves if you’re not here.”
He pulled out his wallet and dropped a few crumpled bills on the table, then pushed himself out of the booth and headed for the door.  The bell tinkled behind him, and he walked half a mile before he looked up to see Tony trailing along beside him.
And with a self-satisfied grin, Steve got off Santa’s lap and headed back to the table in the corner to hand out more turkey.
“Please get me off this topic, I am actually begging you,” Steve said, looking miserable.  “Natasha, I wasn’t planning to ever tell you this but when I was dropping off your laundry in your room one time I saw two different vibrators in your room - somebody
He holds out Steve’s phone, and Steve takes it.

“Well, if that’s settled,” Coulson said, sliding the note back into his pocket.
Time passes.  Tony updates the rest of the team, leaves a message for Pepper, gets a coffee.  Sam comes by, then leaves again.  Barnes doesn’t move from his seat.  Finally -
"Hi."
Steve takes a step backward, swallowing hard.  "Guess I can handle my liquor better than most."
“What on God’s green earth does he do with six cars?”
“I can’t believe I ever thought you were in my head,” Steve said.  “I never could have made up how annoying you are.”
Tony stared at him.  “The - what?”
“That may be true,” Steve says, “but making the decision not to do so would be unconstitutional and wrong.  Who are any of us to be the sole arbiters of justice?  It would have made us no better than murderers.”
“No, hey, that was a shitty opening move, my bad.  Can I start over?”
, and it was only 8:15 and there was no way he could sleep, and what the fuck was he going to do if he had to spend the rest of the night
“Where’s Banner?” he asks.
“You’re drunk,” Tony said.  “Hey, can the other guy get drunk?”
as creepy as it is,” Steve mumbled, rearranging his pillow.  “What have you been up to?”
“You got new glasses,” Tony said eventually.
And Steve surged forward and kissed him.
“You heard him,” Sitwell says, and Steve looks from the car to Sitwell and back again.  Sitwell tightens his grip on his pistol.  “In.”
Tony jogs toward him.  “Nah, Spidey’s got the rest of clean up covered.  Benefit of having junior team members, right?  They talk to the cops.”
And then - and really, Tony should have predicted this, he was a goddamn
“We were good enough to bring you back to life,” Tony shoots back.
Bruce chuckles weakly, takes his glasses off and pinches the bridge of his nose.  “Keep going.”
“I have no idea what you’re referring to,” Steve said, his face all innocence, and then he started coughing, a loud, hacking cough that made them all wince in sympathy.  “Just my asthma,” he said between deep breaths.
Steve raised his eyebrows.  “Are you serious?”
Tony shakes it off and flips the faceplace up.  “Thanks for coming.”
“Guess I can find a way to forgive you,” Steve breathes.
“Yeah?” Tony says.  “Me, huh?”
“So what are you seeing?  I mean really
“Steve’s hungry,” Tony explained.
“Wow, that makes it sound way creepier than it is.”
Steve narrows his eyes, but when Tony jerks his head down the corridor he follows.
“More than a little bit,” Steve called over his shoulder as he headed back down the hall.
Tony sighed.  “Look, I know it’s hard to understand, but I’m okay.  I see my kid sometimes, I see Peter and Rhodey.  Pepper, too, once in a while.  But, you know, it’s been almost ten years in the future too, so.  Some ships have sailed.”
Peter winces.  “And that fight in the Quinjet - ”
“You have no idea what that’s supposed to mean,” Tony echoes.  “So all that shit you said, that was how you feel about Bruce?”
“There’s going to be a
she hung up on him.
“You gonna ask him to join the team officially when he turns eighteen?”
“Except Captain Rogers, sir,” JARVIS said.
Steve and Thor busied themselves with looking literally anywhere else.
Tony freezes.  “Friday, play that last four seconds back.”
” Steve gasped as Tony got a hand between them and wrapped it around both of their cocks, the lube and spit slick as Steve fucked his hand.  “I can’t - I’m not going to - I want to see you come - ”
“Physically, at least,” Clint muttered.
"Any progress?"
“I’m good,” Bruce said, taking the deck chair on Natasha’s other side.  “Did you guys see the tiny soaps in the bathroom?  I didn’t think Clint was a tiny soap kind of guy.”
“I wasn’t sure you’d remember,” Steve said, and he sounded… cautious.  Nervous, maybe.  Tony didn’t like him nervous, he decided, especially not when it was

"You too, but would you mind keeping it down a touch?" Steve says.  "Be nice if there were a few people around who

Steve snorts.  “It’s just that easy, huh?”

“Figures,” Steve said, and that’s when he leaned forward and Tony leaned forward too and they met in the middle in one of the sloppiest and most awesome first kisses Tony had ever had, and for the record he’d had a
Tony smiles at Morgan in the rearview mirror.  “It’s you, kiddo.  You’re so pretty, they can’t help taking pictures.”
“Not even that!” Tony says.  “We’re - we went on what was maybe a date.  Maybe two dates, I’m not totally sure, the second one involved more muggings than the term usually implies.  Also I think he tried to hold my hand but I got weird about it.”
Steve looks up, surprised.  “Thanks, Miss Hill.”  He hurries over to the phone room and lifts the received to his ear.  “This is Agent Rogers.”

Until one night, when he woke up and Tony was staring right at him.
“Nope.”
"No," Banner says.
“I want to sleep for a week,” Tony said.
"Killian and his boys stop by often?" Stark says, leaning against the bar.
Steve turned to look Tony straight in the eye and said, “A Maserati.”
“Nothing better to do.”
Happy, tactful as always, slides out of the car and gently shuts the door behind him.
now, even though you don’t have to pretend to like

Natasha gives him a smile.  “You know the way to a girl’s heart, soldier.”
"I know," Stark interrupts.  "I was just messing with you.  There's
“Because you said my name,” Tony said.  “What were you dreaming about?”
“Pretty sure that’s not enforceable,” Steve said, pulling back and smirking up at Tony.
They talk about work, and the team, and they spend a decent chunk of time making fun of Fury, which is pastime Tony can finally admit he really missed during the years Nick was dead.  When the check comes, Steve pays, which Tony finds kind of hilarious considering he’s the team’s only current benefactor, but also kind of sweet, so he doesn’t say anything.
Tony’s eyes widened.  “No.”
"Having fun?"
“Not really,” Steve said.  “I just say I like it because I know you do.”
“You don’t need to pick me up.”
“How independent?” Tony asks.
“The thirtieth anniversary of Stark Industrial,” Miss Potts says.
Steve looks away.  “I know that.”
All eyes swivel toward Stark.  “Mr. Stark,” Pierce says calmly.  “You’ve gotten mixed up with the wrong crowd.”
Miss Romanov arches an eyebrow.  “What a surprise.”
“That’s right.  Balance.  Here in the city.  You know what keeps this city balanced?”
“Freeze it there,” Tony says, and the whole scene grinds to a halt.  “Zoom in two hundred percent.  Above the bridge.  Yeah.  You see that, Friday?  Let’s play it again.”
Steve’s entire search history was adorably typed out in full sentences.  He’d searched “Tony Stark” six separate times, which Tony mentally filed away and promised to pull out only if Steve
“Just another Saturday night at the office,” Natasha drawled, holding back a laugh.
Steve pushed the door open.  “Sorry for interrupting you.”
“I think that’s our cue,” Clint said finally, backing away from the table.
“Oh, I’ve been skinny dipping,” Tony said, edging toward the pool.  “I did spring break in Cancun in the 90s.  There were Victoria’s Secret models involved.”
“You’re insulting Steve,” Clint accused.  “He’s insulted.”
"Leave her out of this," Bruce says, his voice an octave deeper than usual.
“I guess I did forget,” Steve says finally, and he sounds
“Tony?”
?  You know about this?”
Steve wonders what that means, and why, if he doesn't drink, he's risking spending time in a speakeasy, but Steve isn't here to satiate his curiosity about Dr. Bruce Banner.  He's here for answers.  "I need to talk to you about something."
“You have no idea,” Tony says, and Steve rolls his eyes.
"Ah."
“Rogers, why are you yelling at my calisthenics room?”
“Well,” Steve said, “if you happen to have room in the sleigh, there is
“We can take out a dozen guys,” Stark says.
“Tell me about it,” Barnes says, and they settle into silence, punctuated only by the beeping of Steve’s heart monitor in the room.
.  Steve liked pretty much anything that came out of the microwave, from popcorn to entire pot pies, not because it necessarily tasted good but because it was
It was potentially not as important as Tony had just implied, but what was done was done, so Tony rallied, “Where do you brush your teeth?”
It’s a good feeling; in fact, it’s a better feeling than Steve’s had in a while.  Ever since the war, there’s been work, and searching for Bucky, and looking over his shoulder, and not a whole lot else in between, and now all of a sudden there’s Romanov and Barton and Banner and Odinson and -
It must be catching, because Steve grins right back.  “Hi.”
From behind him, Steve can hear the sounds of other fights breaking out, and he gets low, taking one goon out at the knees and slamming another’s head into the bar.  “Miss Romanov?”
He needs to get to- Get to a place he has signal. Steve is in the middle of the desert but he knows he isn’t in the middle of nowhere. He still remembers the mission map. The desert climate might be ruthless but he is a super soldier for fucks sake. He can do this.
“Tony, I have one more lesson, just one more and then I’m home, okay babe?”
“I’m sorry,” Tony slipped his hand into the crook of Steve’s arm gently, unsure of what he did.
Steve knows exactly how the high-end, diamond tipped cutter came into his house and from where. And the screwdrivers. And the pliers. And the tape.
He still did.
Tony couldn’t get enough of that boyish smile. Steve’s left eye was getting pinker by the second, where he had rubbed his buttery hands onto his face but his eyes sparkled still. He dropped his ice bag that was mostly water now onto the table.
“Yes, Mr. Rogers, it is indeed about the art department.”
Steve came up to him, walking as if moving slowly was a challenge he had to win, then knelt between his legs. Tony’s hands found his hair. Steve looked at him with blown out eyes, he could see a muscle ticking in his jaw.
God, he realized with absolute horror washing over him like ice cold water, there is something in the walls.
Ammonia. Smoke. Acidic. Vanilla under it all, begging to be released.
Tony shook his head, “You’re not getting a word of what I’m saying.”
Steve got up. Restless. Paced the living room. He caught his faded out reflection on the windows. In the faint reproduction of his mirrored image, he could see the deep valley between his brows, the dark purple that circled his eyes. He shivered, turning away from his distorted face.
i’ll send them not a word attached
Once they eliminate the chance of a house fire (and without the help of Dum-E or its beloved fire extinguisher) and take out the over-cooked eggs from the oven, the situation calmed down a little bit. Tony is still hurt. And Steve is still abashed about everything, as he should be.
“Okay.”
He scratches his chin for a moment, “Hm, I do like winning. JARVIS, we’re going to bake!”
He stepped out, rumpled and still bleary with an orgazm blush on his cheeks and walked a couple blocks before he hailed a cab. Cold evening air crept down his collar. He checked his phone but he had no notifications. That’s normal, Tony tried to reassure himself, not like him to pester after calling once anyway. Still, everything felt like an omen. Inside of the taxi smelled like dust and stale smoke. He buried his nose into his own collar to breathe in the lingering aroma of Steve’s flat.
He went back inside, looking down at his coffee, dejected.
“Well,” Tony turned around, “I love buying shit from internet so sue me, I guess.”
Steve buried his nose into Tony’s hair, “I never questioned getting caught as much as I did back then, you know. I really, really wanted to beat him into pulp,” he pulled away a little, his hand came up to cup Tony’s face, with utmost care and gentleness that was in stark contrast to his steely voice, “And I wouldn’t have minded, you know? After seeing, after- How he treated you- How could do that to you?“
“Oh, yeah, sure. Just let me-” Steve disappears back into the house and comes back with his phone, gives a little nod, “Mhm?”
“Perfect,” comes his reply, quick and so honest.
Tony hadn’t even known that he had a hair kink. No wait, he hadn’t had one. Until Steve. Until Steve and his stupid little beanies and complete avoidance of taking them off or letting anyone touch his hair.
Dum-E pulls another pack from under the counter with its pincher. Steve coos and pets it.
And after two days, he was still all by himself.
Crying stopped immediately.
Steve loved Christmas time in the tower. It was cozy and… Well, a lot. But without being in excess somehow. Or maybe it would always feel a lot to Steve, tinged with sadness left from the times when no one had enough to make Christmas look like Christmas and the Rogers family has even less. But it only made him cherish it more.
He looked around the room with its weirdly placed columns and haphazardly hung wallpaper. He could make it in here. In the memory of the ones who tried to build that dream from scratch, only to abandon it in the hands of a stranger.
He wanted to do everything now. He wanted to take Tony to a hospital. He wanted to clean him. Feed him. Call the police. Call a lawyer. Find Stone and sink his fist right in the middle of his face until his face stopped existing.
He took the keys out of his hand, blodied. Steve had cut his palm on them but he didn’t even seem to be aware of the cuts. To be fair, he seemed to slip away somewhere inside his own mind, eyes glazed and shivering from time to time. Tony unbuttoned his shirt, gently pushing it off of his shoulders.
His panic had put Tony in a mindset that he would panic about later and would call it “I was scared of becoming my dad but oh no, I am turning into my mother”.
Tony’s mind immediately went to the image of his bent, bruised, vomit covered form; he couldn’t help the giggle that escaped in his disbelief.
Tony cannot remember any other time in which he couldn’t care about sex this much. They hadn’t had any, yes. But that was something Tony had foreseen. That was something he had accepted once Steve had said he wanted to take things slow.
He heaved soundlessly but there was nothing else to puke in his stomach. Somewhere in his peripheral vision, Ty tried to break free first, then he tried to call for help, then choked in that uncontrollable way people did in the movies. The periodic thump, the crunch of the hits got wet, squelching.
As if it was also listening, gauging the reactions from its surroundings, making sure no one followed it and then continuing its travel.
“Oh Steve.”
“OMG CAPTIAN!!!”
Steve clears his throat, “I will go get your, uh- Tools? Yes. Just a sec-” He disappears behind the door as the goose squeezes inside beside his leg.
Steve, in Steve fashion, laughs some more, “I am absolutely not laughing.”
She smiled at him, “I knew I was right about that boy.”
He sat down, leaned back and closed his eyes as everything rebooted and the security sweep got completed. Steve and him had talked until late at night. Tony didn’t want to push him, but there was still so much he wanted to ask Steve.
But then again Obie knew. Or at least he must have, considering his lack of reaction to definite drugging and attempted sexual assault.
His mind addled with sleep, he wondered if this was it. A ghost, a deadly apparition would be the end of him. The remainders of an Omega who went into this house with hopes for a sweet and easy life and had never been able to get out again, traversing his grounds that never belonged to Steve in the first place.
He couldn’t let him go though, clammy hands holding onto the bony shoulders, muscles jumping under Steve’s hands now and then.
“Mr. Rogers?”
“Tall, bald with a goatee?”
“Oh!”
Creaking of a board and Steve was awake.
Beautiful, strong, caring Steve with napalm like temper, who was still at the door with his back to Tony, forehead pressed against the wood and hand trying to rip off the doorknob.
He plugged in everything he has disconnected, which was a sure way to stay unhacked. If you didn’t exist, they couldn’t find you. Whom he was scared of, he wasn’t sure yet. Obie? Government? But he was playing it safe this time, with Steve on the line.
It’s just that Tony, being Tony, hadn't been able to say no to flirting with the handsome stranger. It’s not like they get new blood in this town that often. And definitely not of that caliber. Rogers had looked good, coming out of the little store with groceries, biceps swelling with the weight of the bags. Face open and hopeful. Tired, but hopeful.
The billionaire leans forward, “Hey, you’re eating said chef’s spag bol,” he laughs and eats more of the spaghetti.
“When?!” Tony cannot name the emotions going through him. One side of him is devastated. The other can understand, logically, why Steve didn’t immediately want to tell him that he was the Crown Prince but he can understand.
He couldn’t remember being afraid.
But he also doesn’t want to do it.
It was kind of funny to think they had gotten together because of the Tsum Tsums in some degree. They had appeared on an alien mission once and… Just never left. Or couldn’t leave, until Tony had figured out where they came from and how. There were others too. A Hulk one, a Black Widow one… But the Cap and Iron Tsums never left each other's side. In the lab, after the fighting was over, they had huddled together to sleep; stacked on top of each other, watching Tony work...
“I refuse ‘almost’, I’m Tony Stark. I don’t do ‘almost’. Oh, and 3 out of 5 stars is not good enough either!” he huffs and crosses his arms, furrowing his brows, in the way Steve calls adorable and can’t help teasing him about.
Steve is the definite proof of that statement.
as we should
“Good,” Tony said, grabbing a handle under the counter, where the cooks kept the knives they rarely used, the big ones, “then no one will question why they never saw you getting out.”
Tony grabs his jacket and Peppers bag, “I’ll walk you out. Enjoy dinner, don’t have too much fun.”
“But really,” Steve continues, “I didn’t have many friends growing up. Well, I basically just had one single friend. We’re still friends. It’s cool. But I also like being able to jump into the game and chat with people who just know my gaming persona. And that’s… Freeing, I guess. Oh look! A Skrull basecamp, I’m sure we can steamroll it.”
“It’s your house, you should open the door,” Tony made a ta-da gesture.
“No, listen,” Tony takes Steve’s hand in his, “ when I had said that, I had meant- Well, see how we’re now. We could be going out? Eating at the most expensive restaurant in the world. We could be having brunch in Paris. But you don’t want that. If you did, it’d give it to you. But you don’t. And frankly, I don’t either. I like having homemade, mediocre frittata muffins with you. I like that we make them together. When I had said low-key, that was what I was getting at.”
“Lunch? I’ve barely made it alive through breakfast,” he throws his hands in the air, emphasising his point, “Somethin’ DUM-E can cook up, so how does an oil-smoothie sound?”
Steve stares at the drab wallpaper across the room and tells him, efficiently and without emotion.
“Search them,” the man says briskly, and Steve puts his hands where everybody can see them as the other men step forward.
“Well, I don’t think it’s the
“Captain Rogers, I’m appalled,” Tony said.  “You had
Pierce pulls himself together and smiles blandly.  “Here’s a proposal for
“Glad to hear it,” Pierce says.  The door next to Steve opens, and Steve looks out to see Sitwell.  “I hope we don’t have to have another chat again soon.  Oh, and son?”
Peggy had taught him how to do it, back when he’d just arrived and they were building his identity.  He used to watch Natasha do it, when they were on the run, but it worked different in the 1950s, and anyway he couldn’t have explained any of that to Peggy even if he’d wanted to.
“Nat called it a hateboner.”  Steve crossed his arms over his chest.  “It’s funny, this isn’t at all how I pictured you’d react.  I’m surprised my subconscious is getting it so wrong.”
unfair because Sam couldn’t even read minds!
“When SHIELD
“Sorry,” she says, slinging the bag over her shoulder.  “No time to chat.”
"Wait," Steve says, "I need to - "
Tony opened his mouth, then closed it.  “And what if I say no?”
Steve jumps up from his desk and ducks into the office.  “Yes, sir?”
that we destroyed it.”
Natasha rolled her eyes.  “Obviously.”
“You got it.”
“So use your security codes to override me,” Tony said.  “Oh, wait.  You can’t.  Because you don’t remember them.  Because you’re a
"I'm not here undercover," Steve says quietly.
," she repeats emphatically, grabbing his chin and training his gaze on herself, "isn't my business. I don't care. You can keep secrets from me. I won't pry. All I'm trying to do is play a little." She slides her hand up his arm, gives him a gentle squeeze. "You know. For fun."
.  You really know how to warm a fella’s heart.”  Stark knocks his shoulder against Steve’s.  “It’s nice to be on a team for once.”
“I’m sorry, is that you offering to help?”
experimenting with the Quantum time machine, because they destroyed it, it never existed, whatever your particular clearance level indicates, etc.  Wanda takes 102, and Wilson moves into her guest room.  One weekend Tony visits and finds that Steve has re-done the gym with the kind of supersoldier-tolerant weights they had back at the base, even though he’s still living in Brooklyn in what Tony can only assume is a sad, asbestos-ridden bachelor pad.
There's a creak from the other side of the bar, and the door swings open.  A man in a long, scruffy coat and a fraying hat looks around nervously and then takes a seat at the bar.
At one point, Natasha inexplicably burst into tears, and all of them stared at her in paralyzed, abject horror until she ran to her bedroom.  Tony had JARVIS delete all footage from local and backup servers, and made the boys swear never to mention it again, which they did without question.
“Ribbit!”
Steve buried his face in his stomach. He huffed, his warm breath penetrated thought Tony’s clothes, tickling his skin. Tony scratched his nails down the back of Steve’s head. Steve slumped. Tony knew he won this argument.
i hope you stay safe until then
“Great.” He smiles to himself as he takes his seat.
“Yeah, some, though to be fair, the snail mail is mostly genuine fan mail. Like, trolls don’t really go that far to troll. But emails and social media? Weird. Just, weird Cap. We have a group channel where our social media guys share the funniest or weirdest ones. Some of them straight up make you question what they were thinking when sending that.”
“Miss Hill?” he says blankly.
“You were asking her to spank you harder.”
“Why, are you trying to drug me?”
“Probably better not to risk it,” Tony said.  “When I get really small again I might explode.  I’m all stocked up on tardigrade meat, anyway.”
, that voice and those eyes and that smile, and Tony hasn’t earned any of it so he gets to work trying to.  Tony tends to keep his eyes open during sex, he’s a visual guy, he likes to watch, and he doesn’t think there’s anything in the world right now that would make him close his eyes to Steve, sweat gathering at his temple, head thrown back, biting his lip to stay quiet, and Steve is the most controlled person Tony has ever known and god, all Tony wants is make him
“You think?” he grumbles, shoving the bag into her arms and running back toward the building.
“Jasper,” Steve says, turning to Sitwell, “c’mon, you can’t possibly think what Pierce is doing is - ”
“One of my friends growing up, his dad had a still in the basement,” Steve said.  “It wasn’t a big op, just made it for him and his buddies in the neighborhood, but he let us keep it going after ‘33 because we were underage for a few more years.  Anyway, one time, I was maybe sixteen, we got drunk and took the train into Manhattan and went swimming in the pond in Central Park.  And it’s not like it was allowed back then, but it was a hot night, you know, and we were kids, but anyway some cop came by and chased us away and we ran all the way to Rockefeller Center carrying our clothes.  Why are you looking at me like that?”
“How do we get him out of it?” Natasha says, kneeling on Tony’s other side.
They meet up in Apalachicola, Florida.
“Hi,” Steve said.
“Yeah, after you took off?  He picked up his shield and went too.”
“What we did, Pep?  It didn’t come free.  I can’t stand by and let them denigrate everything we worked to save, everything we lost saving it.”
“And you
“That’s pretty bold, coming from you.”
“I resent that.”
exists - decide to come back for you, when you swore years ago that he was gone for good?”
The thing is that Steve said it was
“Just putting off the inevitable,” Sam says pointedly.
“Captain Rogers is approaching the lab,” JARVIS said smugly, and Tony groaned, because, in fact, according to Tony’s Official Guide To Shit You’re Allowed To Interrupt Me For, Steve
“Okay, so come on,” Steve said, kicking off the edge of the wall.  “The water’s great.  Isn’t this the kind of dumb stuff people get up to when they’re drunk?”
, but when you brush your teeth, where do you do it?”
Here’s the thing: Steve didn’t actually really like to cook.  He’d done plenty of it growing up, out of necessity, and one of the things he liked best about the 21st century was that he didn’t have to do it anymore.  There was no deep-seated love of cooking driving Steve’s all-day cook-a-thon; it was just plain practicality.  He had, after all, come of age during the Depression, and he didn’t like for anything to go to waste.  And after tonight, for one reason or another, anything left behind in the fridge would fall into the category of waste.
"Whisky, rocks," Steve says.
Third floor, the heat building as she climbs, Natasha hears the clamour of the Krajnc family with their six daughters and fox terrier, all of whom, by the sound of it, are future opera singers.
“Do you not think we can handle something that might come up?” Hope asks, arching an eyebrow.
thing each.  Choose wisely.”
“You probably could,” Tony said.  “You threw a Jeep Wrangler the other day.”
Tony smiled ruefully.  “I’d apologize, if I thought you’d believe it was really me.”
You know it’s gonna be a good party when you hear it before you see it.
“Would you prefer the reasons alphabetically or chronologically?” Steve sighs.
Tony swallowed Steve’s groans as he came, and when his shaking subsided, Tony grinned and then lifted his hand to his mouth and licked it clean.
Suddenly he feels out of place.  The old feeling rises up inside him, familiar and well-worn in the time since the Blip, like the version of him sitting here can’t possibly be the real one.  He’s a replacement, obviously, a photocopy, because the real Tony Stark isn’t the kind of guy who sits too close to Steve Rogers on a bench in Brooklyn, hoping against hope that he isn’t trying to hold his hand but also kind of hoping that he is -
.  Even if it wasn’t for the fact that I could lose my job if anybody found out - you and me, it was fun, it was real fun, but it doesn’t make any sense.  You’re - ”
“It’s so like you to think you know whether or not I’m going to be sick,” Tony said.
“My measurements?”
Steve looks back over his shoulder, but there’s nobody behind him, and he’s about to open his mouth to ask Sitwell what the big idea is when Sitwell stops dead in the center of the sidewalk.
“I’m sorry, I was doing something to permanently keep us
Here’s how it happened: there was a call to assemble, and there was a guy doing magic, and there was an explosion.  So, you know, typical.
“What do you mean, we’re not allowed to say stuff like that?”
“What we saw was you fighting the elemental and then falling out of the sky when it disappeared.”
Strange leans back in his seat and considers Tony.  “When I told you on Titan that we only succeeded in one outcome,” he says, “it was because that was all I could see at that time.”
“Well
“Sorry,” Tony said.  “My brain’s still kind of soggy.”
He’ll run the machine, anyway.
“Well, yeah,” Tony said.  “But hey, still not rock bottom.”
"It's pretty deep," Banner says.  "I know you don't want to draw attention, but it might be worth seeing a doctor who can - "
“It’s perfectly legal,” Natasha says, “or, you know.”
"You want to come with me?" the Hawk says in Steve's ear.
"Don't mention it," Romanov says, and shoots him the first genuine smile he's seen from her.
“That’s an understatement.”  Steve leaned against the sink, stared into the mirror.  “I don’t know how much longer I can do this.”
“Where are we going?”
He chopped.
He’s been in South Dakota three days when Tony shows up.
Tony wasn’t much of a cook.
“You didn’t wake me up,” Steve snapped.  “I woke myself up.  And now I’m talking to myself.  Because you’re
“Very funny.”
Steve had left his phone behind, and he knows Natasha’s inspected his motorcycle for any tracking equipment because Natasha does regular sweeps of literally everything they come into contact with, but he’s
“Too good looking? I know, it’s my cross to bear.”
Clint whistled.  “God bless America.”
"I'll keep it in mind," Steve chuckles, and shakes his hand.
“Of course, go ahead,” Tony says, and Steve follows her into the house.
about my arm, I'm outta here," Bucky said.
“I’m thinking about clothes,” Tony says.  “Barton could use something a little more form fitting for when he’s sneaking up on people, and we can’t have you popping a button every time you take a swing, you’ll be out of shirts by next Tuesday.”
“He’s not armed,” Clint says, looking over his shoulder.
“Okay,” Tony said.  “Now we’re getting somewhere.”  Steve could imagine him shifting on the bed behind him, and he reached down and grasped himself, just to relieve some of the pressure.  “Where was I touching you?”
“Yes.”
“The kind of spontaneous road trip where you ditch your phone and don’t talk to your team for three and a half weeks?  Didn’t realize that was something we could do.”  Tony waves for another round, and the bartender nearly trips over himself racing to pour it.
“You talk too much,” Steve says, wrapping a hand around Stark’s neck and pulling him closer.  Stark grins against his lips and does something with his tongue that Steve finds
Sam opens the door and waves him inside wordlessly.  “Glad I didn’t actually bring pizza,” Tony says, gesturing to the greasy boxes on the countertop.
“So why did this Thanos - who you’ve always
“Do you know what he changed?”
“Can you get hangovers?  Because if you can, tomorrow is gonna suck.”
“Come on, I’m sure you were a cute kid.”
“Ah,” Tony said.  “So it wasn’t just… a drunk thing.”
“Hey,” he says.  “Need something?”
find himself staring at him at completely random times and sometimes gets the feeling Steve’s staring back -
“Glad to hear it,” Tony says, wandering over to his breakfast car and snagging a piece of bacon.  “See you at the Black Widow tonight?”
Tony grins up at him.  “I thought you’d never ask.”
“What’s Thanksgiving?” Thor asked.
The address is up in the hills.  He parks next to a bright red Lamborghini and pushes open the front door, which is unlocked but doesn't look like it was recently picked, and Steve wonders vaguely if Tony stills owns property on the west coast; he's considering poking around looking for clues when he hears a crash.
“You doing okay, boss?” Happy asks once, when he comes back from another drop-off and the penthouse feels cavernous.
“Last time I went on a double date with Sam we ended up with a four page spread in People.”
Pepper puts out the most incredible press release the day Tony officially moves back into the penthouse.
“I’m not just leaving something behind,” Steve said.  “I’m going
“Why, you looking to arrest somebody?”
"Different," Natasha says.  "I thought the same thing."
Tony climbed the stairs slowly.  If Tony was a little less drunk, or maybe a little less fucked up about what the Maximoff girl had shown him, or maybe just a better guy all around, he would’ve kept looking straight ahead, said goodnight, and walked down the hall to his guest suite all alone.
"Oh come on!" Clint yelled, ducking, "you
“Dance,” she says firmly.
Sam snorts.  “You hate it when anybody besides you is right.”
“Then I’ll hit restart and try again,” Steve says.  “We know where the pain points are, we’ve done it once already.  Why do you want to come so badly?”
“Mm,” Steve says noncommittally.
"Put your mouth somewhere useful," Natasha tells him, and pushes him to the floor, where he hikes up her silk skirt, slowly, fingers skating over her creamy thighs. She winds one leg over his shoulder and uses it to pull him towards her, closing her eyes in pleasure as he gently mouths the satin covering her mound, dampening it, outlining her soft folds with his tongue. Thor crowds her against the bar, pressing his forehead to hers, trading slow, leisurely kisses with her as he undoes her blouse and runs his fingers under the straps of her brassiere.
“Oh, but
“So you don’t ever regret it?”
stop me.”
“I’m serious, you’re done,” Tony snaps.  “In thirty seconds this’ll be considered trespassing, do you really want to know what it’s like to be considered a hostile in Avengers tower?”
, sure,” Tony said, pulling off his t-shirt and dropping it on one of the lounge chairs, “but I didn’t think
“You heard it here first, folks,” Clint said.  “Captain America officially endorses not doing your chores.  Children of the world rejoice.”
“There he is,” Tony said.  “Old Man Cap.  You walked uphill both ways in the snow to school too, right?”
Tony winced.  “So it wasn’t exactly a big romantic reunion.”
Tony’s mouth is dry.  “Yeah,” he says, and Peter turns back to the screen, content in a way that Tony will never be that everyone had done everything they could.
made the call,” Steve says.  “We had no idea - anything could have happened, if we’d done it differently.”
“Well, not that I’ve thought about it much,” Steve lied, “but a sleigh and eight flying reindeer might do the trick.”
“Busted,” Clint said, and then he tipped over onto the floor cackling.
Even before he became a babysitter to the stars, Tony had about six different full-time jobs, and
“Timelines branch out from every decision point in the universe,” Strange says.  “Every series of events, every possible path where Thanos triumphed, that was a branch I saw snuffed out.  But once we won the one we did, it opened up a new set of branches.  A whole tree’s worth, you might say.  All of those were obscured to me at that moment, because they couldn’t exist without the first one.  But once the one existed, the others opened up.  They were free to happen, or not happen.”
That’s fine with Tony.  He has other things to worry about.  The task of putting the world back together is too big for him to wrap his arms around, so instead he hires back all of his employees, every single one of them.  He doubles his energy output overnight.  He starts work on another factory just to give everybody something to do.
But this - Steve had the impression of everything getting big, and then bigger, nauseatingly so, and the colors all changed into something that wasn’t on the normal spectrum, and then with one last burst of light -
“So what?  They attacked him in the
“Tony, it’s fine,” Pepper says.  Her mouth twists a little, like it always used to when she was trying not to smile.  “It’s kind of funny, is all.  After everything - ”
“Well, I haven’t moved in ten minutes, and there’s a bunch of golden retrievers headed my way, so…”
That’s how he knew this one was a dream: Tony was staring at him, biting his lip and smirking.  Steve wanted him closer, and because it was a dream, suddenly he
“Well, Morgan loves the chicken tenders,” Tony says.
“I just feel,” Tony said, pausing to bite gently at Steve’s nipple, “like I don’t want to waste this opportunity to find out
And sees Natasha Romanov, on her back, stretched out over the length of a lacquered black baby grand, her red silk dress rucked up over her hips, Bruce Banner's dark and curly head between her thighs. He has one dark, tanned hand braced against the piano, the other wrapped around her creamy thigh, and he’s pulling her close against his mouth as she moans and bucks in pleasure, yanking his hair and guiding his motions. Her eyes are wide open, and as Steve freezes in horror, they lock onto his. Her expressions of pleasure don’t change.  Her blue gaze burns. Then, she winks.
“Well, that works out,” Bruce says lightly.
Nicola smiles winningly at Steve.  “Were you getting out?”
"I don't think they have it in Chicago," he says. "You might have to teach me."
like that, nobody else who would have brought him here, and if Pierce is here, that means -
Tony’s unmistakably
“As you know, my nationality is a bit of a tricky subject,” Natasha said.
“The what?” Bruce said, bringing up the rear.
“Exposed,” Steve says.  “I didn’t realize how much it would scare me to think of you being out there fighting without me.  I don’t need any promises from you, Tony, I don’t even need to you to say you won’t do anything stupid, I just - whatever it is, I’d like to be there next to to you.  Even if that’s just as a friend.”
Steve dove across the table, pulled back his tiny little fist, and punched Clint in the face.
and slows down at the main entrance.  It’s already been a day, to say the least; what’s a little aggressive paparazzi action to round it out?
“Sending you a list of the most likely locations, sir.”
“That there’s probably a version of us out there that did it differently,” Steve finishes.
“That’s a bold statement, Dr. Beck,” Jameson says.
“This may be a first with us,” Tony says, “but I actually don’t think I can argue with that.”
“Nothing!” Tony said.  “It’s not an emergency.  It’s - JARVIS, whaddya think, fire alarm?”
“Rude,” Steve said, and flicked a handful of water at him.  “I really hope we don’t get attacked while we’re drunk and naked.”
“Yeah,” Tony said.  “I mean, can I stop you?”

“Have you ever seen him be a happy
“They said the same thing about car phones, and look what happened,” Tony says.
“Balance?”
“Now, don’t forget, it’s gonna get weird in there,” Scott said.  “I mean really weird.  Imagine how weird you think it’s gonna be, and then double that.  Did they ever tell you about Alf?
“You can’t act like you’re gonna enjoy watching this thing, Cap.  This is torture.  I have actually been tortured, multiple times, and honestly, this is worse.”
“I’m sorry,” Tony said, “my

“Tony,” Bruce says.
“You don’t care what anybody says about you on TV.”
before Pepper, nothing serious, and before she moved to Hollywood she’d actually gotten a degree in biochemistry from Harvard so the pillow talk had always been better than usual.  There’d never been any hard feelings, and in the sea of wealthy donors and Stark Industries execs swarming the fundraiser for May Parker’s Blip Displacement charity, she was a breath of fresh air.  “How are you these days?”
“You could have,” Tony says.  “You have some experience ignoring things.  And people.”
“For the record,” Clint said to Thor, “Christmas isn’t
