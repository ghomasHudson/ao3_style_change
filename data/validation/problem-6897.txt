“Back off, Skynet,” Tony snapped at 26, who actually managed to look dejected.   “City College, 26, I swear to God,” Tony called out over his shoulder as he took Steve by the arm and helped lead him to the elevator.
MIT students are famous for their hacks and pranks.  The two described in this chapter actually happened.  Check the Wikipedia page for more.  You know Tony would have been all over that.
There was other evidence, too, of course.  A deep, aching tenderness pulsed inside of him when he moved. Not entirely unpleasant, but noticeable, he thought with a wince as he rubbed sand off his calves.  And he felt…empty. Not just…not just
“It’s not porn,” Rhodey protested. “It’s some jock getting his workout on the roof, and sure, he is--in my very heterosexual opinion--”
. It didn’t feel like a lie. Loving Tony. It felt less like a lie than almost anything Steve had ever said, and yet, it hurt to say, wreathed in regret that slashed through Steve’s mind like the sharpest blade and left behind an open, gaping wound in its wake.  Tony’s gaze flickered with surprise, joy and then, strangely, sadness, the bone-deep kind that wrenched at Steve’s heart even before Tony could speak.
Tony’s wet chest brushed up and down over Steve’s as he writhed in Steve’s arms, slick skin sliding over the peaks of Steve’s nipples until he hissed out his pleasure, hips jerking up, seeing friction.
“Yeah, you’re adorable.  Can you focus? There’s a thing.  Maybe a thing. Nat thinks there’s a thing,” Bucky told them.
“I couldn’t do this without you,” Tony replied.  “Well, okay, I could, but the truth is…” he trailed off, looking down for a moment before raising his gaze to Steve.  “The truth is, I can.  I can do it by myself, Steve, but I’m better at it with you here.  I’ve been so…consumed with getting these people. Fixing what I—what was wrong.  But, then you show up, and—and maybe it’s about more than that.  Maybe I could be more than the guy who cleaned up his mistakes.”
“You don’t have to, really.  I can do it.   I should probably just—“ Tony began, then cut himself off.  He had kept Steve away from his life once before, and how had that turned out?  “Sorry.  Habit.  I’ll grab my tablet.”
“That’s--you don’t even…that was just a stupid story.  How do you even remember…look, you say that, but you don’t know what that really means,” Tony stammered haltingly.  “Not really.  I mean—“
“Right. Sure. Okay,” Steve rushed out, stepping backwards down the hallway, and managing to almost trip over, well, air, not to be judgmental.  “I’ll just—there’s, ah.  I made.  I have.  Food. There’s food.  If you want it.  That’s what I was going to say.  That there’s food. Okay?  I’ll just—I’m going to be in here. With the food.”
“Shoulda asked for two million,” Brock said in a flat, quiet tone, his gaze fixed for a moment.  Steve opened his mouth to say something, then Brock huffed out a laugh, “Kidding, man, come on.  Just a joke.  You’re all twisted up about this,” he added, shaking his head as he grabbed his bag and slung it over his shoulder and Steve was left suddenly unsure what that was about.  He brushed past Steve in the door, stopped abruptly, and turned around to face him.  “That was,” he scraped a hand over his mouth, “I shouldn’t have… Listen, okay?  I’m--this is fucked up for me, you know?  I mean, how am I supposed to feel?  I couldn’t even take being here waiting for you to come back.  Had to go blow off some steam.  And then you--you come back after this great night with some rich asshole, and you look like this, you know?”
“Drink?” Tony asked.  The alien just regarded him, holding the pouch closer to Tony’s lips and nudging them slightly apart.  Underneath him, the not-gel lifted Tony’s head enough to make drinking easier, he realized. Tony looked dubiously at the pouch once more, but he was desperately thirsty, and he supposed if the alien wanted him dead, he had plenty of opportunity to do it in more interesting ways than killing him with alien space Kool-Aid.  Tony drank. It tasted a bit like sugar water, but not so sweet, and Tony found himself sucking down the whole package while the alien watched with a pleased, encouraging look. The drink was, Tony had to admit, incredibly refreshing. He felt almost instantly better.
“You like that, huh?” Steve huffed out with a low, pleased-sounding laugh.  “I’m going to make you feel so good, Tony. So good, I promise.”
“Speaking of, I was actually thinking about trying to do some painting before getting ready for tonight,” Steve said. “I haven’t painted in ages.  Haven’t wanted to,” he continued with a low shrug.   He wondered if that was really true or if he had just convinced himself he didn’t want to.  “But, the light’s great out on the balcony right now, and I don’t know, I thought…well, it seemed like something I could do again, maybe.  Would you be willing to—er, sort of... model for it?”
“A farmer?  A fisherman?  You’d have been miserable, my dearest one,” Tony smiled knowingly, making Steve’s mouth curl into a lopsided half-smile in acknowledgment of the truth in those words.  Farming, fishing, he would have hated it.  Maybe not at first, but eventually.  He’d have stayed with Fury and Coulson, followed orders, chasing Bucky into an early grave, or so Nat said.
“You call them Flatheads,” Tony said. “But, to them, they are Clan. They took me in when I was hurt as a child and raised me as--as one of their own.”
“Stark! Well, well, well, isn’t that the sight,” Hammer called out.  “Still taking home my leftovers, I see!”
Chitauri, Steve mentally repeated the odd-sounding word.  He felt the hairs on the back of his neck rise and suppressed a shiver.  A rabbit ran over your grave, Steve Rogers, his mother would say, an old saying, but one that felt truer now than ever.
The phantom smell of copper and pickles drifted through his head.  The jar money.  God, he’d forgotten the stupid jar money.  Some old, empty pickle jar with a nattily dressed stork on the front they’d converted into a place to drop coins and the rare dollar bill that might end up forgotten in pockets before laundry day.  They told themselves they were saving up to do something stupid with it, though Tony couldn’t quite remember if they’d ever settled on anything in particular. Mostly, they had just talked about things they’d do one day, when One Day was still on the menu.
“No stopping. Why is there stopping?” Tony asked, curling his hands into the front of Steve’s doublet and tugging insistently.
“I don’t know,” Tony replied honestly.  “I don’t know what I’m doing.  He wants me to go.  Coulson—SHIELD agent guy—he brought a letter. From MIT. Because Steve called the President.  Of the country.  And now I’m going to MIT, which is great.  It’s great.  Right?  It’s great.”  His mouth flattened and trembled with the force of trying to hold everything back.  He tasted salt.  His eyes stung.  His vison blurred and a silent cry escaped.
“You flew him here without so much as a word to anyone, shouted at the doctors and then refused to leave so they could run tests,” Natasha reminded him.
Steve moved back then, taking Tony’s length his mouth again, slower this time, hollowing out his cheeks and sucking at it in earnest now. He heard Tony sigh above him and looked up long enough to see Tony’s dark eyes watching him, alight with a savage sort of triumph that burned into Steve’s body, sending heat creeping down his back to pool low in his gut. It settled him somehow, seeing Tony look at him like that, a strange sort of calm flooding through him, releasing a tension he hadn’t known he was holding.
“Are you sure?” Steve challenged. Tony grinned, bit his lip, eyes gleaming and breath coming in pants.  Steve felt himself returning the smile, something like pride bursting in his chest at Tony’s unwillingness to give up so easily.
“Yeah?” Tony asked, the word coming out rough and raw, dug out of some pit where the sides were marked with long finger-scrapes.  It got out, though.  That was something.
“Well.  Some do.  Omegas get older, Alphas want, you know, whatever,” Tony mumbled, waving his fork in the air diffidently.  “I mean, not all Alphas, obviously, just, you know, some.  Some do that.”
The bus crawled to a halt, and the doors swung inward. Steve stepped off and into the crush of people moving up and down the street.  Tony looked around, one hand gripping the raised metal handrail on the seat in front of him.  He could see his own distorted reflection in it.  Maybe this whole thing was all messed up in his head.  When the certainty had spring into his head in Steve’s apartment, convincing Steve to give them a second chance had seemed more like a long conversation, a bit of romancing and probably more than a few post-coital discussions away, not this huge, impassable gulf.
“I mean, it was just, you know, casual and all, but it wasn’t bad or anything,” Steve said quickly.  “I don’t think I’m supposed to talk about it.  That NDA thing,” he reminded Brock.

That was enough to make Steve feel his own climax building. It wasn’t long before his hips spasmed as he spurted huge jolts of cum into the man’s hole. He always came a lot. It made a mess, he knew. Some people hated it, and he had found himself red-faced before, apologizing and trying to clean it up as best he could, but here, it didn’t matter. It must be at least okay, since the man came back again.
Yes, Steve thought, please, God, yes.  His cock twitched under his robe, going hard with a sudden pulse of need.  His skin was on fire.  His heart was pounding a drumbeat in his ears.  He was trying so hard to remember to breathe that each puff of air seemed to shatter out of his chest.
Where’s the manual on what to do when your Alpha doesn’t want you?  He closed his eyes and slowly turned his head back to face the ceiling.  Steve was probably going to find someone else.  Hell, he’d all but told Steve to, if Steve would just come home to him. Some Omega on the side who didn’t build missiles in his or her garage.  Someone who took care of him the way they were supposed to, not with better drones and stock splits.
“Director Fury thinks this will be good for me.  Help me acclimate,” Rogers explained, ignoring what Tony had said.  Acclimate?  That made no sense.  Acclimate to what?  Tony wasn’t about to ask, considering he’d already pretty much fucked this up beyond all recognition.  See?  He’d studied his military terms so diligently.  Shame for that vast storehouse of useless knowledge to go to waste.  “Your Dad, he—he said you were excited.  About this.  Not really sure what you get out of it though.”
“He said I could make it about Schmidt in my head all I wanted, but that I did what I did because I had something to prove, and I suppose he wasn’t wrong about that.  About me. So much for prophecy, huh?” Steve grimaced, making Tony’s eyebrows raise, a small smile quirking his lips at the admission. “But, he followed me anyway. Probably the only one who would have whether I drank whatever that concoction was or not.”
“Eh, I’ve got, like, an actual list of people who would beg to differ, which I should probably tell you tops out with my dear, old Dad, and I’m pretty sure the person who has known me the longest recently tried to have me killed, but putting that aside for the moment, your take on all things Tony Stark is somewhat of a, let’s call it a novel approach, shall we?” Tony replied.
Behind him, Steve lathered up his hands with shampoo, then threaded his fingers through Tony’s hair, lightly scraping his nails against Tony’s scalp.  Tony could feel it all the way to his toes. He’d heard the expression ‘making your toes curl’ before, but he’d never experienced it, at least until now.   Steve’s powerful hands were magic, digging into Tony’s scalp, scratching at his head, sending sparks of heat down to coil low in Tony’s belly. He stifled a moan, then gave up and let it out, leaning into Steve’s hands.  It felt amazing. Tony’s spine tingled with sensation as Steve’s fingers wove in and out of his hair, scrubbing the curls and massaging Tony’s head and neck as he went.
Not that anyone would ever know or care, except perhaps the squirrel he was systematically escalating towards North Korean dictator levels of crazily militarized.  The amount of people interested in an Omega’s take on weapons designs currently numbered a big, fat one, and despite his last name, Tony knew no one at SI would listen to him.  Not on something like this.
Steve ducked his head, let out a long rush of air through his nose and opened the door.  His mind flashed to days spent playing chess with Cam while Tony worked and called out moves from a gameboard he could see in his head, long hours of sketching and half-listening while Tony patiently explained whatever it was he was building to Cam, and books read aloud over meals that evolved into discussion and debate between mouthfuls.  What did they look like to someone like Cam? He and Tony?  Was that what happiness looked like?  For a heartbeat, his eyes watered and prickled, and he wanted nothing more than to agree, to embrace it, free himself of the push to fight, sink into this thing with Tony and just let himself be happy and demand nothing more than that.  It sounded so simple.  He hung a hand on the edge for a moment, before glancing back to look at Cam.
“When don’t I?” Tony asked, then sneezed and coughed at the same time.  A loud bang sounded, and both he and Steve turned towards the bedroom door, where a winded Rhodey appeared, grasping the doorframe for support as he wheezed.
“Not ink blots,” Steve said, biting the inside of his cheek so as not to smile.  He sat back and looked at the rough outline of a figure, all circles and lines at the moment, though it was starting to take shape.  “Like using art to help people solve problems, reduce stress.  Heal.  That kind of thing.”
“--- tired out, too, if you had an Omega like that back home,” the one who was presumably Calhoun said around a snort of laughter.  “I’m just saying, you couldn’t
“I’ll handle him,” she said, nodding at the security guard who stood next to an arched entry to a hallway, where a security guard was stationed to keep guests from wandering to the private areas. She gave Steve’s arm a reassuring pat and moved away, saying something to the burly security guard in a quiet enough tone that even Steve couldn’t hear it over the din of laughter, music and voices.  Soon enough, the man was trailing behind her as she swept her way towards the ballroom, where the orchestra had started on another song Steve didn’t recognize.
“It is,” Steve agreed, nodding slightly. Here, the land was verdant and lush with the rains that always seemed to fall, carpeting the ground with thick, green grasses that tapered down to where the jagged cliffs met the sea.  Over the din of birds and buzz of noise from the battalion marching behind them, Steve could pick up the rush of water over stone as the long fingers of the River reached out to the sea.  “Didn’t expect to be back so soon.”  That much was true, and as they got closer, he was less and less sure he wanted to see it again, and more certain that he had to do so.    There really wasn’t any saving grace in not knowing, he thought dully.  If Bucky could return, then he could.  Or he should, and maybe those were the same thing, or had to be.
“Well,” Tony hesitated.  “To be honest…that actually went surprisingly well.  Guess maybe there is something to this whole bonding thing.  Might be useful.  For battle, I mean.  Could be good.  Ugh, you and me, I think, we did…we were…good.  Better.  I’ll have to have JARVIS run some analysis to confirm, of course.  But it—ah—it felt like maybe.  So, there’s that.”
“This is incredible,” he said quietly, looking out towards the pool’s edge where it disappeared into the skyline.  It gave him something to look at other than Tony while he waited for whatever that was to pass.
“Please, no, please!” the girl shouted, though to no avail.  She was dragged off, her sobs trailing after her as Steve watched in horror.  There was nothing he could do, though he made himself look.  Made himself listen.  He had done this.  This was his fault.  Why couldn’t he just have let it go?  He was about to leave. There had been nothing to gain, except some small boon to what little pride he still had, and now, she would suffer for it.  He had no doubt that Rumlow would make sure of that.  He could at least not look away from it, Steve told himself as he stared.  His eyes stung.  Bile surged in his throat and his stomach roiled.  If there had been food there, he would have retched, but as it was, he only managed a choking, dry heave of blood-stained spittle that dripped down his chin and onto his chest.
Steve felt Tony’s hair against his skin as Tony bent down, and then his mind simply exploded as sensation after sensation rippled through him when Tony licked a flat stripe over his hole and up the seam of his ass.
“Still, this can’t be easy, Cap,” Tony protested.  “None of this.  Waking up to a whole new world, now this.  You just—you’re not alone, I want you to know that.  We all—we all have our issues. If you need anything…” Tony trailed off, unsure exactly what it was that he was offering, until his mind hit on something he could.  “Speaking of the whole future is now thing, you’ll probably need some help with the tech.  JARVIS runs the Tower, as you’ve already seen.  He can help you with most things, the gym and kitchen stuff, that kind of thing but the more advanced stuff and particularly the things I’ve modified for our…let’s say somewhat unusual requirements…you’ll probably have some questions.  You always did. I know a lot of this is new to you, so, my door’s open, Cap.  Anytime.  Happy to help,” Tony assured him, clapping his hands together, the sound coming out too loud in the quiet room.
.  He didn’t know.  He had the odd sensation of floating, warm water cocooning him, the rush of it filling his ears with a constant susurration that blocked out anything else.
“Isn’t this about the time you swoop in and do your thing?” Natasha asked, sidling up in the space next to him at the bar.  Tony looked down from the mirror that hung over the back of the bar offering a reflection of the ballroom and peered into the glass of amber liquid that was cupped in his hand, held almost protectively between where his elbows bent on the wood of the bar.  He ran a finger up and down the smooth surface, catching a drop of condensation on his thumb and rhythmically spreading it up and down the frosted glass, leaving clear, wet streaks in its wake.  With more effort than should have been required, he forced the leg that was propped up on the brass railing that traced the bottom of the bar to stop tapping out a tarantella against the metal.
“Hmmm,” Tony mumbled and stretched his arm up to curl around Steve’s neck.  “So, what if you had seen me? Back then, I mean?  In one of those photos or, I don’t know, on a mission or something.  Would you have been all White Hat about it?  My Knight in Shining Armor come to rescue me?”
“If you don’t mind me saying so, Ma’am, I learned a long time ago that trying to do the right thing usually ends up a mess.  But not trying ends up with something far worse,” Steve said, gaze flicking over Tony almost hesitantly.
Steve whirled, eyes wide, a shout of surprise on his lips.  No one was there.  Yet, he was sure  he heard a voice, clear as could be.  A man’s voice, not unfamiliar, though he couldn’t place it.
, he was going to die--swirling it around, the rough burn of the lace doing against the soft, sensitive skin of his rim and channel pushing him to the precipice and holding them there as wave after wave of pleasure burst through him.  In and out, fast, darting thrusts, then long, languid swirls that drove the lace deep inside him, and Tony was gone.  Flying.  Falling.  Over whatever cliff he had been clinging to and gone.  Bright points of white danced in his vision.  His eyes rolled back in his head and he clawed at the bed, trying to find any kind of purchase.  Steve’s hands held Tony steady, keeping him in place, keeping him open, while his tongue continued its relentless assault, licking and thrusting into Tony’s hole, scraping the lace around his rim, pushing it deep.
He was nude, save for a skirt of pearls and opals that glittered as they caught the sun, and his collar, though he took little note of it now, here, when it was just them.  Tony liked it, and Steve liked being beautiful for him.  It felt like something he could do for Tony, and Steve suspected that, as much as anything else, was why Tony enjoyed it so much. This part of Steve was Tony’s in some way that Steve didn’t quite understand, but knew it to be true, nonetheless, and Tony reveled in it, like the more he gave, the larger this part of Steve would become.
“Well, he’s not wrong,” Tony replied, returning the light smile.  “How’d your meeting with Fury go?”
“No,” Steve replied softly after a long moment. He looked down at his hands.  “Yes. I don’t know. It isn’t just about me, Peggy. You know that.” The car rolled to a stop. A valet swung the car door open, and Steve stepped out, holding out a hand to Peggy.
“I just…wasn’t expecting you.  At all,” Steve replied.  “I’m sorry. You caught me off guard.  I don’t mean to make you uncomfortable or—or ruin your evening or anything. If you want to leave--”
The chef used his Nona’s recipe to make it, so at least Tony knew what was in there.  Nothing Steve was allergic to, if his memory of Project Rebirth’s many forms, which he had read for science—no matter what Bruce said about that having nothing to do with building things for the team—was right, and it always was.
“How am I supposed to feel, Jarvis?” Tony demanded, slamming a hand on the table hard enough to make some of the coffee slosh over the edge of the cup and dribble down the side.  “He wants me to go.  I get to go to MIT, which is great, and I’m happy.  I am.  I’m—why can’t I be happy? Just be happy?”  His eyes burned, and he could feel his mouth scrunch up.  Ugly crying. That’s what they call it, he thought, sucking in a deep, bracing breath.  His mother said it made his face look blotchy.  She was probably right, he thought with a hitching laugh that rattled around in his chest until it didn’t sound like a laugh anymore.  “He doesn’t want me.  Jarvis, he—he doesn’t want me, and I’m trying to be happy, because MIT—I mean, MIT!  But all I can think about is why doesn’t—why not me? Why not me?  Just once?  Why not me?” Tony pleaded. The words sounded wet, like you could twist them up and wring them out in puddles on the floor.
“Anthony Stark.  Son of Howard and Maria Stark.  Bit of a troubled youth, if you listen to gossip.  He has quite the reputation, not that I put much stock in gossip, of course. I don’t know why the Director wanted him included, other than the father, Howard, does some work for SHIELD.  A favor, I suppose,” she added in a dismissive tone that clung to the gossip in a way that reminded Steve of nails on a chalkboard.
“So. Probably some scans, then,” Rhodey said, glancing between the medics.  “What about…whatever this is?” Rhodey asked, looking around the room that was now, Tony noticed, filled with even more of Vegas’ finest, a still unconscious Obie, and SHIELD’s Sisterhood of the Travelling Thong.  He rubbed at his head and rolled his eyes.
It still smelled like a stale combination of earth, old wood, and Listerine, with a hint of lemon underneath.  The cleaning spray.  The one Jarvis had always used that somehow migrated up here.  Not much else had changed over the past ten years, Tony thought as he stepped inside the cabin.
Tony wanted more of his machines stationed at various points.  General Rhodes argued for more men at the weak points in the wall and outposts.  Marshall Strucker wanted to dig more wells and add storage to cut down on the need to resupply.  Steve listened to what they said, and, more importantly, to what they didn’t say.   Supply lines and storage.  Bowmen.  Mortars.  A standing army that largely depended on the promises of Lords and Ladies who owed fealty to Tony.  Little mention of heavy horse.  The space for trench lines had been eaten away by city sprawl that crept outside the gates before Tony’s parents were born.  As a walled city, they prepared for siege, not war, and the success of that strategy showed in the centuries without conquer.
Great.   DUM-E would probably lock down the garage now.  He and Steve were going to end up at the bottom of a well while U insisted it puts the oil cloth in the basket.
He heard Tony release a long, low shuddering breath that was part moan, and looked  in the mirror long enough to catch the bob of Tony’s throat as he tried to swallow.  There was a steady dribble leaking from Tony’s cock down the mirror, leaving a smear of fluid across the glass.  It was beautifully erotic, Steve thought, the evidence of how much Tony wanted him marking the glass.  Steve reached out and swiped a thumb through it, then brought it to his mouth, letting his tongue flick out to taste.
“I don’t follow all that political stuff,” Tony said stiffly.  He was going to try, dammit.  Fill that pepper shaker like pro, he thought to himself and nearly snorted at the absurdity of it all.  He was terrible at this.  Miraculously finding his inner domestic diva was probably a lost cause.  There was a picture of him on a milk carton somewhere, but he’d never see it because his Alpha was the one who did all the cooking and grocery shopping.  There was irony and then there was just being bitch-slapped by a universe of your own making.
“Well, I’m still sorry this whole thing is taking longer than you’d hoped, Tony,” Pepper told him.  “I know you want it over sooner rather than later.”
“Technically, I kind of created a whole new—but, you know, I—I like the sentiment,” Tony smiled softly at him.  “Still. We can do more. We’ve already got an outreach program set up, why not expand it? The—the Barnes Assistance and Rehabilitation Foundation.”
Steve raised his eyes up, finding Tony looking down at him with an expression of pure, unfiltered bliss. Tony’s other hand stroked Steve’s aching jaw and he smiled, wide and dark and full of pleasure. Tony’s hips canted back, spilling his cock almost all the way from Steve’s mouth and giving Steve a moment to catch his breath before Tony thrust back in again. The motion rocked Steve backwards and he squeezed his eyes shut. Bright, searing pain blazed from his nipples and then his ass as he strained forward trying to find that perfect space between the two points of agony that he was becoming certain didn’t actually exist.
Only Anto would think of such a thing.  That was what Tyber said, anyway, and he was probably right.  There was a sense of wrongness running through the entire clan.  A disquiet. They didn’t know what to do with the idea of a secret, Anto had realized.  It confused and confounded them. They wouldn’t understand about a place to call your own.  All was Clan. Or it wasn’t. All belonged to the clan. Or it didn’t. There was no in between, where something belonged only to you, separate and secret.
“God, Steve, Steve, God, fuck, Jesus, Steve, you, God, I just—I’m gonna’, Holy fuck, Steve, don’t move, God, arghnugh—“ Tony was mumbling, seemingly wholly unaware of what he was saying. Steve reached up and cupped his jaw gently, guiding Tony’s eyes to his.  Tony’s thrusts became totally undone at that point, wild and punctuated with Steve’s name as Steve spread his legs wider and shifted his hips up slightly, altering the angle just enough that the head of Tony’s cock brushed across his prostrate with each thrust.   Steve threw his head back with a groan and flung one hand over the headboard, one hand captured under Tony’s at Tony’s hip, burrowing deep with each thrust.  Tony came with a last brutal thrust, hips, Steve’s hands clamping down sharply as Tony’s hips snapped wildly a few last times as his orgasm took over, leaving him shaking with the effort.  Steve felt the warm rush inside him, odd, but pleasant, as Tony shouted his release at the same time Steve came all over his own stomach, jerking slightly as he did.
“Ah, there you are,” Tony said, drying his hands on a cloth as he walked in from the antechamber.  “Thank you for attending to him today, Small Hands.  Go on to the kitchen and find yourself some food before the soldiers get it all,” Tony ordered.  Cam gave him a quick nod, threw a mischievous look at Steve, and hurried out of the room.  One of the guards closed the door behind him. Finally, he was alone with Tony.
“Picking flowers,” Bruce called out, his head popping up from behind a dessicated log that sat in a copse of nearby trees.  Steve watched Bruce shake his head in apparent surrender, then go back to whatever he was doing.
“Good,” the King said, then gave Steve one last, long look and bent down, placing a lingering kiss to the top of Steve’s head and running a hand through his hair.
“Don’t worry, I’m good for the deposit,” Tony muttered, then went back to plunging his tongue into Steve’s mouth while simultaneously tugging Steve’s hips flush with his.  Somehow, in the midst of all of that, Tony managed to shimmy out of his Speedo and toss it to the side with a wet splat that made Steve tear his mouth away to follow the sound like a retriever eyeing a ball.
?   Uh...you, take me,” Tony pointed at himself, “back to Earth, yeah?” he asked, gesturing towards the wide window of stars and making a sort of semi-triangular shape with his hand that he used to cut through the air in front of him with a zooming sound that the alien’s eyes tracked.  “Home. I go home. Deal?”
The wall is a shield, Steve thought again, something about it niggling at the back of his mind.  For some reason, he thought of the white lily, so brightly and clearly that he could almost smell the sweet fragrance when he breathed.  He shook his head to clear it, making the chains dance and clink, drawing Tony’s attention for a brief spell, as Marshall Strucker continued his diatribe on rats in the grain stores for so long that Steve was ready to chew through a few grain sacks himself.  They spoke of war as if it had been learned in a book and could be added up on a balance sheet, Steve realized, remembering the stack of ledgers he still needed to finish combing through.  He lacked Tony’s mind for numbers, but he knew what an army needed to run, and even a casual perusal of those told him something was off.  Perhaps he would blame the rats, too, he thought with a flat grimace, as Strucker launched into another round of complaints.
“I do not tie myself to the—okay, that is an outdated reference, first of all, and second of all, completely inaccurate,” Tony said.
,” Anthony announced, sitting down on the bed next to Steve.  He was warm, Steve could almost swear he felt it, though it was the words as much as anything. They were warm words.  Thoughts. Whatever. It didn’t matter. None of it was real.
“Come here,” Steve urged, patting the place next to him. Tony complied with a low groan, crawling up the mattress and flopping his head down on the long, rolled pillow next to Steve. “You look exhausted.”
“Good thing I don’t really have any plans,” Steve said as the doors slid open.  A couple of people got off, then Steve stepped in, holding the door for Natasha.  “Going up?”
“We are both of us broken things, Steve. Both of us.  You said I take what would make me weak and turn it into a strength.  I do that by looking to you.  You are my rudder.  I would be that for you, if you would allow it,” Tony offered, almost hesitantly.  “Poor one though I may be.  But you must choose to turn to me instead of trying to find your way on your own.  This thing that you carry with you?  I would help you bear it.  You don’t have to do this by yourself, Steve.  I would follow you on this path, same as any other, but you must choose to let me.  I cannot make you,” Tony finished, lifting a hand to cradle the curve of Steve’s jaw.  “But I will not let you go.  No matter what.  Even if you need to turn away from me.  I will be here when you do not.”
“I didn’t mean to—I--I’m sorry.  You’re right.  I shouldn’t’ve said anything.  I don’t know why I…” Steve trailed off, raking a hand through his hair.
Tony had the sense of the world tilting, slipping downward like it was melting, then righting itself and reforming.  He blinked and realized he was looking at Howard’s belt buckle as his father’s body swayed back and forth in mid-air, legs kicking out, though not far enough to reach Tony.
“You’re beautiful,” the King whispered into the sweat-soaked skin at Steve’s neck.  “Look at you.  I could do this all night, and not get tired of looking at you.  Capacity.  Energy.  Length.  Thrust,” the King said, canting his hips forward so Steve felt the hard length of his erection against the opening of Steve’s ass and giving Steve’s cock a particularly hard tug with one hand while the other did the same to Steve’s balls.
“Obviously,” Tony agreed.  “I’ll—it’ll be better—me, I mean, I’ll be better—if I’m doing something,” Tony admitted, looking furtively over at Steve.  “I just—I worry. Because it should be perfect for you, and it might not be and there isn’t anything I can do about that, and I’m not—I’m not very good at dealing with that.”
more than that, he qualified to himself. He wanted to talk to Tony about his robots, and Einstein-Rosen bridges, too, and be teased, and watch movies, and sit next to him on a droopy sofa that smelled vaguely like mothballs.  He wanted it all, but that seemed like asking way too much of the universe, so he would have to settle for what he could get.  He thought, even if he just got a little of Tony, that might be more than he would have ever thought possible.  Certainly, more than he deserved.
Steve stepped forward and reached out a hand, taking the tags into his fist.  He lifted his gaze to Tony’s eyes.
That—that hadn’t been what he had meant to think, Steve realized with a sudden start.  This wasn’t the Tony he knew, or the one who knew him. This was Tony before Afghanistan and Iron Man.  Before aliens and portals. Before Siberia. Before Steve had barreled into his life.
Why had he been afraid before, Steve wondered, as he dug into the food. Tony was just a man.  A man of wealth and education far beyond Steve’s experience, that much was obvious from this castle, but was it so unusual for such a man to be surrounded by things Steve didn’t understand? So what if Tony preferred a life of solitude?  He was clearly some kind of--of scholar.  Perhaps that kind of life was conducive to whatever it was Tony studied.
—seemed to have dissipated into the air. Or luft, he supposed wryly. What's the big deal about speaking German? Tony's Italian was perfect, his French terrible, and Latin good enough for an exorcism, but he suspected Steve wasn't really interested in comparative languages at the moment.
“It—I—well…” Tony stuttered.  He was standing on the edge of zero to panic.  He could feel it.  His body starting to depress the accelerator, like he was on the outside looking in, watching it happen, but powerless to stop it.
“So,” Tony said, sipping from his mug of coffee.  “What is it anyway?  Some Omega pheromone whammy thing?”
“The company?” Peggy practically shrieked.  “The company. That’s what you’re so worried about.  Haven’t you been paying attention?  Good Lord, Howard! Maria—Maria, there’s—there’s this disease out there that’s killing people, and no one knows how to stop it, and you’re—you’re worried about the stock prices?”
Steve looked down at the rug for a moment, it’s mosaic pattern blurring as he tried to focus.  “No,” he said, looking back up at Tony.  “Not you.  I know that.  I do.  Zola, though—he said, there are punishments--"
He stepped out of the warmth of the car and into the chilly evening air. A steady stream of people moved along the sidewalk, mostly on their way home from work at this hour, giving Tony quick, curious looks that slid over him without really finding purchase. By the time he made it into the building and up to Steve’s floor, he was second-guessing the impulse to come down here and make some kind of grand ceremony out of this. He’d come this far, though, looking, he told himself firmly, for a goodbye that wasn’t filled with bewildered pain, one that he could finally leave in the past where it belonged. That was why he was here.
He blinked down at Steve, then slowly slid out of his chair and let his knees fall to the stone in front of Steve.  He pulled Steve close, pressing their foreheads together, hands grasping at Steve’s face.  “I am sorry,” Tony said finally.  “I am so sorry.  More than I can say.”
His stomach turned over.  Part of the bread stuck to the roof of his mouth.  He had to force himself to swallow it.   Were they really going to do this here?  Now?  You came here for this, a small voice echoed inside his head.  Away from the workshop and the technology.  Away from the Pollacks and matching cups and the bed big with the dip in the center of the mattress that curved around their bodies.  You brought him here, where he fell in love with you.
“My clinical assessment is that you are experiencing severe post-traumatic stress disorder coupled with moderate to severe major depressive disorder, which is not improving, but rather becoming more pronounced, likely leading to what I suspect is suicidal ideation masquerading as the kind of heroic risk-taking that is currently being rewarded and encouraged by the system that is enabling what they say they want to prevent,” she said.  “And, that’s our hour,” she said with a sigh, closing the blank notebook in her lap.
.  Oh, God.  It really was. He remembered the address from the alumni record and various announcements and pleas for donations that had come to the house over the years.  “What…what are we doing here?” Tony asked, sucking in a breath and letting it sit in his chest so long that it started to burn.
.  The man wasn’t doing anything, really. Just standing there, and it wasn’t like he wasn’t entitled to use the road whenever he wanted, Steve supposed. Steve didn’t own the road, after all. Steve didn’t own anything.  The man could certainly use it if he wanted, even in the middle of the night, just like Steve was.
That's why you kept it, Tony thought, reaching out to grip the stair railing with white-knuckled fingers. You kept it for ten years because you knew it would matter to me, even if I didn't know about it. Even if I never knew about it. You still kept it. Because I would have cared, and you knew that, and that made it worth saving.
He really should’ve paid more attention when Jarvis tried to teach him a few go-to recipes.  By more, he meant any at all.  Crap.  How did you make that stew Jarvis said you could throw together…freezer stew, he’d called it, because it was just stuff you pulled from the freezer.  How hard could that be?  He’d spent the afternoon designing one of the most advanced missile systems the world had ever seen. Stew.  He could do stew.
Steve stalked out of the elevator and into the suite’s living area, stopping in front of the sofa, hands going to his hips as he waited, all but vibrating with pent-up anger.  Not that it wasn’t deserved, Tony could admit as he followed Steve into the suite.
“We should get back,” Steve finally said, mainly because it seemed a thing he ought to say. He made no move to disentangle himself from Tony though, and Tony answered by burrowing into Steve’s side.
“See, that sounds so gracious and conciliatory. Flattering even.  Ad yet, I sense a but coming,” Tony muttered, though his tone was teasing, pleased, even, as though they were engaged in some kind of game of words, and it wasn’t worth winning unless the other truly played his best hand.
Tony’s hands skated up Steve’s arms and over his shoulders, then he stopped, hesitated, his eyes boring into Steve’s.  “For tonight. Just for tonight,” Tony rasped out, and Steve nodded jerkily. He felt Tony’s fingers under his collar, and then the weight was gone from his neck.  Steve breathed in. The weight was gone, but it was like he could still feel it, the absence of it nearly choking him.
“I am happy,” Steve insisted, though the words were sluggish with the weight of sleep.  Had he been sleepy?  Exhaustion seemed to crash into him at once with Tony’s words, and he could barely keep his eyes open.  He didn't want to dream, didn't want to think of it, though his mind conjured the half-formed image of waking up in darkness with a scream dying in his throat and Tony's voice, soft and sure and soothing, in his ear.  “With you.  I’m happy with you.”
“Oh my God, is that a glorified autodialer?  Seriously?” Tony said, stepping forward and taking the device out of Steve’s outstretched hand.  “You’re going to crack Howard Stark’s personal safe with this? God, you really are desperate.”
A long corridor led to a large, vaulted room flanked by stone benches on all sides.  Painted tiles on the walls and ceiling depicted scenes of birds, flowers, water creatures and bathing figures, while oil lamps swung from the rafters and hung from the walls, wafting a delicate incense into the room.  Several concubines sat or reclined on the stone benches, chatting and taking small cups of tea soaked with mint leaves from their attendants, though the conversation stopped when Steve entered.  He could feel the weight of their gazes on him, though they said nothing.  Steve undressed and slipped on the sandals Cam provided, then wrapped the embroidered cloth around his waist.
“There were men here. I didn’t know them.  I should have realized then, I suppose. I thought they were my father’s friends, come to pay their respects or—I don’t know.  I didn’t think,” Tony told Steve, who watched him with the same impassive frown.  “He gave me something to drink.  Obie, I mean. I don’t know what was in it. I guess I should probably be grateful for it, though,” Tony said, mouth twisting into a grimace.  He closed his eyes and breathed out.  Laughter filled his mind, though not the kind that held any real mirth, just a shared cruelty.  Flashes of other things would come sometimes, but it was the laughter he remembered above all of it.  They had laughed.  It wasn’t the worst of it, he supposed, but he couldn’t quite seem to forget how it had sounded to be laughed at like that, when he was terrified and powerless, and it had all amounted to nothing but a jest for them.
She was happy.  In her own way, she was happy.  She was secure.  She was well cared for.  She had the things that told the world her status.  She wanted him to be happy, too, and the way she knew to give that happiness to him was the way she had gotten it for herself.  By playing the game.  She didn’t make the rules.  He couldn’t keep despising her for not breaking them.
“I was thinking, there’s a pond on the property.  Supposedly fully stocked.  I thought you might like to go fishing?” Steve suggested, then winced slightly.
, either. It was almost overwhelming, almost too much, but every time he thought it might be, something kept it at bay.
Thank you to my wonderful readers, who have waited so long for an update.  I hope in the middle of all this craziness, you are doing well and this gives you a tiny pick-up.
“There it is,” Steve said, pointing. Tony squinted at it, covering his eyes with one hand, then giving Steve a somewhat dubious look.  Granted, it didn’t look like much, Steve realized as they approached.  It was ringed by reeds, and there was a small dock extending out towards the middle.  Patches of grassy dirt laid out under the trees. Steve found a relatively flat patch, took the basket from Tony and spread the blanket out.
“Because you are in love, and it is only ever terrible or wonderful.  Love, Tony.  It tends to make us all a little crazy, from time to time.  It is the most powerful force in the universe, after all,” Jarvis replied.
“Yes, Boss?” the AI’s voice sounded in the jet, the lighter, feminine voice not as much of a shock as it once had been.  The wrongness of it had been lost over time, but what was left was an almost-rightness that would never quite get there.  He’d almost managed to make himself stop noticing.  Almost.
The non sequitur caught Steve off-guard for a moment before his mind found the thread of conversation.  They were back to the tie thing as if they hadn’t been discussing attempted murder and international terrorism.
Get through the gate of the heavily guarded government facility.  Get inside the heavily guarded government facility.  Find Steve inside the heavily guarded government facility.
He felt Tony’s body jerk and convulse as his orgasm shook through him.  Tony let out a soft cry against Steve’s mouth, body shuddering, then looked up at Steve, one hand still wound into the front of Steve’s shirt.
“Ah, no,” Coulson said, shaking his head quickly.  “Just to be safe.”  White Coat One drew his hand back like he’d stuck it in a flame, which would have been comical except for the rather terrifying realization that literally no one was going to risk crossing his new Alpha, so he should probably not require any actual physical assistance while he was here.  On the other hand, he’d probably kick ass at hand-to-hand combat at the moment.   “Tony, Dr. Reese is going to go over some things with you,” Coulson said, indicating a door just over White Coat One’s shoulder.  “I’ll wait right out here until you’re done.”
“Well, that’s certainly quite the gesture,” Jarvis remarked.  “It’s quite a bit nicer than your father’s coupe.”
“The thought kind of stayed with me over there,” Steve admitted with a deprecating laugh, flexing his hand a bit above the tabletop.
This was not happening. This was not—no.  Just, no.  He had misread.  Misheard.  Missed something.  But, not that.  He wouldn’t have missed that.  He wouldn’t have.  Except…an insistent little voice in the back of his head kept reminding him of that first time, down in his workshop after the battle, Steve yelling and Tony shouting right back.  It had been too fast and too rough and Steve had been sorry, though Tony hadn’t cared, not really, because even then, it had been amazing and wonderful, and had he told him that?
“Sorry, Mrs. Stark,” the smaller of them with the short, cropped hair called out, then cast a look at her friend and jerked her head towards the floating platform a good ten meters out into the lake that had a diving board hanging off one end.
“Sir, I’m sorry to interrupt, but I have an incoming call from Captain America for Iron Man. It is not on the Avengers line.  He indicates it is low priority.  Of a more personal nature, I believe.  Shall I put him through?” JARVIS asked.
The thought that if he just jumped, he wouldn’t see it anymore burst in his head seemingly out of nowhere.  It was crazy, he knew, but he had a moment where he couldn’t shake it, no matter what he did, it just sat there, thumping against his skull.  Jump, and he wouldn’t see it anymore. The wheel is turning, he thought with a sudden, strange clarity, the way the first, bright rays of the sun cut through the last of the night.
Steve, and he was fairly sure at least one of those was inevitable, like some poisonous seed he’d unknowingly planted years ago finally bearing fruit.
One part of his mind, distant, like it was coming from the bottom of a very deep tunnel, insisted it was just his sleeve, but he could
—to deal with when we Bonded,” Tony shrugged, his eyes dropping down to his lap and mouth twisting into a flat grimace.
Three large, black cases sat in the middle of the garage, locked with a biometric mechanism of his own design.  He walked over and nudged at one of the cases with his toe.  Why had he even brought the armor? The garage wasn’t equipped to work on something as sophisticated as the armor.  It was all but done, anyway.  Admittedly, the last test had not quite as expected, though U had taken an unholy amount of delight in finally getting to use the extinguisher.  Still.  It was ready.
Steve cleared his throat, “Well…I kind of…traded?  I mean, the first guy, well, he was okay, I guess, but I…well, I met this other guy and he…he…he was nice,” Steve stammered.
“I’m really not,” Steve replied wearily.  “Please. I just need one set of plans. They’re not…anything you can use.  It’s for something that, uh, never even worked. I don’t want to—to make this more of a situation than it is.  But, I need those plans, Tony. I can’t leave here without them. Peggy will get them back to you when…when we don’t need them anymore, I’m sure.”
“At once, Your Highness,” the city Marshall, a tall, lean man with sharp, hawk-like features, replied.
“Of course, Sir. One moment,” JARVIS responded softly, a hint of something like acceptance in his voice.
It wasn’t a good place, Steve thought, and maybe it was even a bad place, but, whatever knowledge this strange place offered, he had to have it.  He had to
Steve’s mind stuttered to a halt, then seemed to skip across flashes of memories the way a rock skips over water when thrown just the right way.  Drops of red on snow.  A blue light, brighter than the sky.
“Right.  And Howard trots him out whenever there’s some opportunity to mingle with the stars-and-bars types.  Except the boy keeps pissing off every Alpha who gets within ten feet of him,” Fury said, turning towards Steve.  Steve had to bite down on his cheek to keep from smiling. He could imagine that pretty easily—had imagined it--but he liked hearing it confirmed.  Good, Steve thought firmly. They should stay away from Anthony. “I don’t know if Howard’s going to want to chance a long Courtship. For a lot of reasons, but mostly because if you were to back out, the hit to the boy’s reputation would make any future prospects fairly dim, at least by the standards the Starks set, you get my meaning?”
“That what would be like this?” Steve asked, blinking up at Tony with a matching frown, though his was born of confusion.  Tony started to speak, then stopped, sucked in a breath and wiped his hand across his mouth and looked away, towards the grand fireplace, shrouded in carvings and tapestries older than the both of them.
That was nice.  Tony sighed, his eyes fluttering shut.  He opened them again when he felt the alien’s forehead lay gently atop his own, then gasped as a groundswell of emotions washed over him.  Wonder, delight, awe, fear, hope, a sense of deep, profound gratefulness, and behind it all, joy. The same blinding, complete and utter joy he had felt earlier, but magnified now, a hundredfold.   It was like trying to stare at the sun. Too much. Tony closed his eyes, and the feeling lessened, like someone had turned the volume down on the TV.
They had Thai for lunch, Tony ordering what he knew Steve liked.  Tony suggested the Guggenheim afterwards, but was overruled by Steve, who took him to a small gallery in Soho that was hosting an exhibition of Rube Goldberg cartoons and sketches, as well as a few model inventions based on Goldberg’s designs.  Tony was completely taken in by the depictions of the complicated contraptions, his mind whirring as he described the physics behind the elaborate mechanisms to a rapt Steve, who remembered the original cartoons that were published for years in the New York Evening Mail.
No matter how many things he built from his father’s cast-offs or how many online courses he took, ultimately, he was going to service an Alpha his father chose for him and--hey, look at the happy Omega on the pamphlet—absolutely love existing to be a vessel to take an Alpha’s knot.  Sure, that sounds concerning, right?  Oh, no worries though.  Apparently, his body would cheerfully help him not give a fuck about anything else and dulling his mind until he didn’t care about anything but rutting with some big Alpha cock.
Steve pursed his lips, jaw tightening as he took a deep breath before the plunge.  “I gave him the check back.”
“Thank you.  For the…for what you did,” Tony said, jerking his head towards the garage.  “For what you said. I know, I do, I know how you feel about me.  I just—I wasn’t sure which version of me walked out of that cave, Steve.  Sometimes, it’s like I don’t even recognize myself, or I tell myself I don’t, but that’s—it isn’t true.  I do.  I know this—this me.  I always have, and it terrifies me a bit that I do, but this is…I think this is maybe who I’m supposed to be. But, I need to be yours, too, and I…I don’t want to choose.  I want both.  I want to be both.”
That was true.  He knew it. He thought the kids knew it, too, though probably not the grandchildren who sometimes came with their parents to visit. Visits that had grown more frequent, he was well aware, and with an edge of duty to them that he didn’t like.  They were all waiting, whether they knew it or not. That was really all he had left to do. Wait.
“Sorry,” Steve said at the same time Stark mumbled his own apology and stepped back almost comically fast.
“No, no, this is a mistake,” Tony insisted, shaking his head.  “A mistake.  That is what this is.  You are overwrought.  All of this, Zola, Hammer…you see horrors behind every curtain.  I’m not blaming you,” Tony said quickly, holding up a placating hand.  “But, I tell you, you or Cam, you misunderstood, or Zola was toying with you, perhaps, or—”
Instead, Steve’s mind latched on to the rest of what Stark said and flared with immediate interest. “You have a predictive AI? Like using text mining and social network analysis, that kind of thing?” Steve guessed.
“Okay, you know that the vows literally say the ring is a token of love, and the whole circle thing is a symbol, and,” Rhodey said, drawing out the word as he reached over to swipe the box from Tony’s hand, earning a disgruntled yelp from Tony.  “And, yeah,” Rhodey said in a low voice that elongated the word.  “Just like I thought.  Your suit?  That I totally don’t know about,” he corrected, glancing around quickly.  “You’re such a sap.  Like kiss in the rain, hold a boombox over your head, read a notebook kind of sap, you know that right?” Rhodey finished, shaking his head as he snapped the box closed and handed it back to Tony.
“You have hands, you know.  Technically, I think that’s cheating,” Steve grinned.  It snorted at him, then disappeared under the water for a moment, before its eyes resurfaced, bobbing the waves just out of arm’s reach.
“If you plan on auditing the class, you’ll need to take it up with the Registrar,” the professor said.
“Swim. Take a dip. Refresh. The pool’s amazing. You can’t come here and not try it,” Tony told him, pointing at the small infinity pool that looked out over the rest of Vegas below.
“Go,” Rhodey urged.  “Call if the other kids on the bus pick on you or try to steal your lunch money.  I’ll get things set up with someone from the Corps for your next Board meeting.  Pepper, I’ll send you the contact info. Get all the financials squared away before Tony presents anything.”
“Don’t know.  Maybe it’d tell him something about all this,” Clint suggested.  “Probably should get Steve there cleaned up first, though.  I got some baby wash in here somewhere.  You can use that in the bath.”
“Steve…Steve…God…you’re…you’re Steve,” Tony muttered.  “My Omega.  Mine.  Mine… you’re mine.  We’re…we’re bonded.  Bonded.  You have to stay.  We’re bonded.  Stay.  Please.  Please, please, stay,” Tony choked out as he thrust deeply, gripping Steve’s hand for dear life.  “We…we can…go to the island.  Island.  No way to…have to stay. Stay.  On the island. Steve, please.  We’re bonded.”
he had felt for a long time.  No numbness, no going through the motions trying to get through a day, no wondering if anyone would notice if he just disappeared.
He had known.  From the beginning, he had known.  Known that this whole thing with Tony was some itch Tony needed to scratch for whatever unfathomable reason wound itself into the back of Tony’s mind and culminated in Tony shoving his tongue down Steve’s throat in the middle of an argument that had begun somewhere over the Atlantic and ended with Tony panting underneath him, half out of the armor and muttering about needing to stash some clothes on the jet.
But Captain America had changed that. In addition to what he accomplished on the battlefield, had done a lot to change perceptions about the role of Omegas in society.  Even with the serum and newfound strength and agility, the serum hadn’t altered his innate personality.  Until then, until him, it would never have crossed the minds of most Alphas and Betas that an Omega would ever be able to lead, to command, to be daring and courageous and all those other traits the Captain had exemplified in spades.  It would be too simplistic, Tony knew, to say that Captain America had been responsible for the shift in perceptions about Omegas that had occurred over the seventy or so years since then, but he had certainly gone a long way to making those changes a possibility instead of a pipe dream.
Captain Rogers, or who he assumed was Rogers, anyway, was standing in front of one of the tall windows wearing his dress uniform and facing Tony, hands behind his back, which had the effect of making him look even broader in the shoulder than he was.  And that was seriously saying something.  Bit like saying the Rockies have a few good mountains.
We are not doing that, he told himself firmly, running a hand through his hair to hide the sudden tremor.
“No!” Steve shouted, then winced when Tony fell silent, though his question hung in the air.  “It wasn’t you, Tony. It wasn’t.  I wanted to tell you, talk to you, but…I don’t know.  I guess I thought…I don’t know what I thought. That you wouldn’t like me if you knew.  If you really knew me.  If you really knew me, knew what I was, what I did, then you wouldn’t like me.  You wanted—the image, the idea, the—”
He had time.  There was no rush.  He could come or not.  It didn’t matter. He could do whatever he wanted.  Tony wasn’t even watching. No one was seeing him. It was just him.  There was no right or wrong thing to do, except that one thing, and that...didn’t seem as important as it had been moments ago.
“You are many things.  But, you are not selfish,” Steve said, slowly, firmly, keeping his gaze locked on Tony’s.  He moved forward in the water, until his body was brushing against Tony’s, and his hands settled on the sharp bones of Tony’s hips.  “You are not.”
“So.  About last night,” Tony began, then let the words sit there between them.  “I meant what I said.  About everything,” he said, looking down at the plate and picking at the crisp edges of the bread.  “I was sitting up there in that room, trying to convince myself I was happy.  Or that I should be happy.  And all I could think about was you.”
Tony looked up in shock.  Steve. Steve had come back, Tony thought with a surge of panicked relief.  Steve had come back, and they would talk or—or something. Tony could explain better.  There were so many things he wanted to say, and not that he had been
There really never was a world where a few days was going to be enough.  He’d been an idiot to even think that had been on the table.  They were going to love each other or destroy each other and there really wasn’t much in between, because he couldn’t walk away from this and be Steve’s friend and wish for his happiness with someone else, and he didn’t think Steve could do that with him either.  Really, it was always going to be Steve.  Had Pepper known?  Had she seen it before he even had?  There had been distance after New York, he knew, though he’d thought it was because of his own issues, because of the suits and the whole superheroing thing, but maybe that had been what he wanted it to be about.  Something he could control, not something he had to fight for.
“They test us at the club,” Steve told him.  “Every two weeks. Just had mine. I’m clean, too. And…well. I haven’t since before my last deployment, to be honest,” Steve admitted.
Happy pulled the car up next to the deck and Steve pushed open his door, crawling out without answering.  Tony caught Happy’s look in the rearview mirror, nodded, and followed Steve out of the car, hearing the front door of the cabin slam as he did.
“I did not--you’re exaggerating. He’s exaggerating, Steve. Stop that, he’s going to believe you,” Bruce admonished lightly, holding up a finger to belabor the point.  “It was barely a few structures with some minor--minor, Tony!--minor damage.”
“It does have the air of inevitability about it.  Car’s ready,” Steve said, looking at the text on his phone.  “What about you?  Ready to go home?”
“Your Majesty, pardon the interruption,” a voice called out, breaking the spell.  Tony’s gaze lingered on Steve a moment longer, then he turned towards the newcomer.  One of Ellis’ guards, Steve noted by the uniform with its branching leaves. “Lord Ellis bade me tell you that he awaits you at the tent just through those trees with a light repast, should you care to join him.”
“Famous last words,” Tony mumbled.  “Lead on, my incredibly well-dressed sacrificial lamb.”  It took them thirty minutes to walk there, eschewing Happy’s offer to drive, which gave Steve the chance to play tour guide for a bit.  He tried to remember as much Vegas lore as he could from their tour bus ride around the city and his one trip to the mob museum, which wasn’t much, but Tony seemed entertained at least, though he was surprisingly quiet during their stroll down the Strip.
“I love you, too,” Steve replied, voice steady and calm, because he did.  God, did he.  Loved him before everything.
“No disrespect intended, of course,” the Ul said smoothly. That, Steve thought, was definitely a lie. Tony thought the same, by the frown that marred his face for a moment.
“Yes. Yes, thank you.  That’s good. I’m good. Are you good?” Tony questioned, looking Steve up and down.
, his mind supplied.  Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket.  Something. He would be dead soon. In minutes, probably.
“Excuse me?” Deirdre said hurriedly, coming over to take a better look and then turning to Steve in confusion.
I'm so sorry for the long delay between chapters!  Vacation and real life this summer has been kicking my ass, but I will finish this, I promise!  This chapter was a lot of fun to write.  I love their banter.  It is almost entirely talking, which is actually really tough to write that much dialogue.  Hope you enjoy, and get a better idea where they are coming from.
He hadn’t actually meant to make the offer, or he’d maybe meant it to be teasing, he wasn’t sure if he even knew what he was thinking.  Except, as soon as Tony said it, the idea had rocketed to the front of Steve’s mind with a sledgehammer’s force. He didn’t hate what he did at the club, but he didn’t exactly like it, either.  Doing it for Tony, though…where he was Steve, giving that to Tony, not some nameless, faceless fantasy up on a stage that customers could project whatever they wanted on…he wanted that. He wanted to watch Tony while he danced for him, the way he hadn’t been able to that first night.  He wanted to see Tony’s reactions, to know they were for
Steve’s mouth was slanted over his, tasting, using his tongue to trace the seam of Tony’s lips, then dart inside, swirling around Tony’s own, and he moaned, thrusting his hips against Tony’s, and, fuck, God, the friction of the silk gown and the hard, rough Kevlar against his cock was going to push him over the edge in no time.  Not that Steve would mind.  He craved it, Tony knew, that eagerness from Tony, that need.  Loved it when Tony got all wet and loose for him.
Anthony, Steve thought, saying the name over and over in his mind.  It was such a strong, pure thought, warm and bright, like tipping his head at the sun, not the harsh kind of brightness that lived in here.  He almost said it out loud, then caught himself. The picture Steve had so carefully memorized, the image he’d created in his mind, none of it came close to being in the same room with the real Anthony, who seemed to radiate a sort of vibrating energy that Steve couldn’t quite tear his gaze away from, even though he knew it wasn’t proper.
“You do?” Tony asked, voice pitched high, still eyeing him like he might bolt if Tony made any kind of sudden move.
“Yeah,” Steve agreed. The word felt heavy in his mouth, flowing down to his stomach and settling there like a stone.
is this?” Steve asked, shaking his head slightly. “Why are we here?  I thought…”  he trailed off, not really sure what he had thought now.
“No, it’s—” Steve started, then grimaced and closed his eyes.  When he opened them, Tony’s gaze was darting over his face with clear concern, so he tried to shake off the malaise.  “I was looking at the men pushing the wheel. Thinking that it could have been me. That I could have just as easily ended up there,” Steve said in a flat voice.  He saw Tony wince and look away, blinking quickly and flattening his mouth into a thin line. “I was looking at the wheel, and then, I was in a battle. An ambush, really.  It was—bad,” Steve managed to choke out. “It was like I was there. I could see it. Smell it. Taste the smoke in my throat. Feel the blood on my hands. And then…then he was there, and I wasn’t fast enough.  I wasn’t fast enough,
Fumbling, fingers suddenly feeling huge and clumsy, Steve reached for his belt and made quick work of his fly, shoving his pants down to his knees and letting his cock spring free. He braced one forearm against the wall and stroked his cock a few times, slicking it up until it glistened. Pre-cum leaked onto his hand, and he spread that around, too. In front of him, the hole waited, open and ready and his to use.
know Cap pretty well by this point.  The helicarrier was long behind them, and probably to no one’s greater surprise than his own, Iron Man and Captain America got along pretty well once Loki’s staff wasn’t coming between them. Which…okay, well, that sounded bad even in his head.  Point being, Cap was actually one of the few people Tony had met who turned out not to be disappointing.   The real-life Captain America was everything Tony’s childhood brain had projected onto him—strong, brave, loyal, smart, and good in some to-the-bone sort of way that only Cap seemed able to pull off without it being completely obnoxious—and underneath all that, he was also, as Tony slowly learned, much to his delight, a complete smartass who could give Tony, or, well, Iron Man, a run for his money in the annoying other people for the fun of it department, someone who followed orders like they were a series of Choose Your Own Adventure options and far more broken by everything that had happened to him than he let almost anyone see.
“I was hoping you’d say that,” Tony said with a rush of relief.  “Obie, we can do this.  You and me, we—“
“How I’ve missed you,” Tony sighed, his voice tinged with a wistful melancholy, his hand slowly falling away.  Steve’s eyes followed it until Tony settled it on his lap, then he looked back up at Tony, confusion settling in now that his mind caught up with Tony’s words.
“You’re letting him go?” a shrill voice shouted from behind them. Tony spun around in time to see Stern barreling down the hallway, an angry hand pointed in Tony’s direction. “You can’t let him go! Where’s Judge Abernathy with the warrant? Go pull him out of the Cheetah Club and get him to sign it,” Stern demanded.
“Good.  Me neither,” Tony said huskily.  He took Steve’s hand and pulled him lightly along to the bedroom.  Pushing the doors open, Steve followed Tony into the room, which was now actually lit and gave Steve a chance to look around.  The room was huge, with a sunken sitting area, bar, workstation, television the size of a small movie screen and what he assumed were the doors to a bathroom and closet.
Tony couldn't quite get his head around it. His whole body was still thrumming with a jittery nervousness, waiting, waiting, waiting for the other proverbial shoe to drop. It was worse when you don't see it coming, when you don't expect it. It was always worse to have it be a surprise, so the key was to always expect it, always be ready for it. That way, you couldn't be caught off-guard, and that? That was the worst way to find out you'd screwed up, to have it just drop in your lap out of nowhere, the run of shock through your body, the tense moments of what, what, what was it, what did I do, where did I mess up? Those were the worst parts, when you got down to it.
“The group that made it, this was their sigil.  A reminder of where they came from and what they lost.  That their lives were spared, and going on…it was a terrible privilege.  That it had to mean something,” Rhodes was saying, drawing Steve’s attention back to the coin.  “But this…this,” he said, turning the coin over in his hand so that Steve could see the other side. “This was the other side.  That night, this was in the sky.  A portent.  An omen.  A guide. Whatever it was, they took it as a sign, and followed it.  Some say for years, I don’t know, but they kept on, until they came to the desert and the wastes beyond.  The land was inhospitable, empty and desolate.  Stark land, they said, and so it became. Their land. And they kept on, until they found this place.”
“You’re so tight, God, Steve, so tight for me,” Tony muttered.  His eyes were glazed over and watching the motion of his hand with rapt attention.  A moment later, Steve felt Tony tug at the rim of his hole, stretching his fingers apart to spread Steve’s hole further.  Each tug sent a spike of pleasure to the tip of Steve’s cock, making it stir with interest.
“Okay, so—so, right. Exactly,” Tony confirmed, momentarily thrown off by Steve's answer. “And then I accidentally let your neighbor unlock your apartment, even though I'm not your lawyer—your building security really leaves a lot to be desired, quite frankly---and here we are,” Tony explained. Sort of. Close enough for horseshoes, grenades and exes.
“Sometimes, you can’t stop bad things from happening,” Cam said in a soft, thin voice that sounded weary.  “Most people don’t even try, though.  They just do what they’re told, look the other way.  Hope it doesn’t happen to them.  I think they should, though.  Try, I mean.  If more people did, then maybe even more would, because they wouldn’t be so scared, and then things wouldn’t be so bad.”
“I’m sure he’ll come around, Tony,” Steve assured.  “After all, you convinced me it’s not at all creepy for you to buy the building I live in and the company I work for, so I’m sure you can convince him of most anything,” Steve said with a smile.
Steve gasped and choked at the sudden intrusion, his throat spasming around Tony’s cock. The breath seemed to have been punched out of his chest. He tasted salt and skin and felt the oily slide of fluid down his throat. The wiry hairs at the juncture of Tony’s thighs tickled his nose, and his nostrils flared with Tony’s musky, familiar scent.
“It’s fine, Tony,” Steve cut in.  “It’s…” he sighed and looked away from Tony’s stricken face.  “We were on a mission,” Steve began, voice halting and scuttling across the words like a rock skipping across a pond, displacing everything as it went.  “We were on a mission,” he repeated, forcing his voice to remain steady.
Tony groaned, equal parts desire and relief, and his hands came up, butterfly-light, and wrapped around Steve’s hips, roaming up his chest and over his back.  Tony’s fingers scraped over his nipples, the peaks becoming taut, down his stomach and through the sparse line of wiry hair, then back up and over his shoulders, his arms, down his thighs where he rocked lightly, cock jutting out proudly between them.  Everything was hot. His skin, his cock, inside him, everywhere. His mind was hazy and slow, and at the same time, focused with absolute clarity on everything Tony was doing. On the display of emotions that flitted across his face. Desire. Amazement.  Worry. Want. Hope. Tony’s face was an extraordinary canvas, painted in bold, brilliant strokes with everything he always tried so hard to hide. It was, Steve thought, probably one of the most humbling and gratifying moments of his life that Tony let him see it.
“That…that actually does sound interesting, Mr. Sterling,” Steve replied.  “Though…thinking back, I have to admit that some of the photos the boys were taking may not be the kind of thing for public consumption…though I realize a lot has changed regarding what the public wants to see these days.”
That was cruelty, Steve thought. It was. It had to be. Wasn’t it? Cruelty to Tony or to himself? He wasn’t sure. Both of them, maybe. Probably. He knew he hated himself for saying it, and wanted nothing more than to keep saying it. He meant it, he knew that. Here and now, he absolutely meant it, but it settled wrongly in his gut, the words seeming to curdle as the moments ticked on. Tony’s happiness was real, and there was hurt enough to come later. Would this memory lessen the sting or rub salt into it? Steve didn’t know.
“Just—ah--yeah, just give us a minute, okay, mom?” Tony asked, twisting around to catch her straighten her shoulders and soldier on with a curt nod.
“Yes,” Steve said, slowing down as they walked.  “I’d still like you to have it, I guess. You don’t have one, and that way, I could—I mean.  People could find you. And, I don’t really need it. There’s no one who would—who…I’d just like you to have it. But, I should probably give you this, too,” he said, handing the amulet and small figure to Anto.  “It isn’t right that I keep it when you’re not my…when I’m not, I mean…I just shouldn’t have made it. I can’t destroy it, though, so—so you should have it.”
Tony smiled, all teeth now--not teeth, fangs, Steve corrected himself, for they were.  Jagged and pointed, they gleamed white and deadly.  His face had shifted, too, Steve saw.  The angles were sharper now. The hollows of his cheeks deeper.  His jaw wider.  At first glance, one might not even notice anything amiss.  He could walk past you in the night, and you might only feel an unexplainable chill creep over you.  Some sense warning you of a danger you couldn’t name, though he had many names. Nightwalker, Steve thought.  Shadowman. A beast, a creature, a demon, Steve didn’t know. Didn’t care. It was Tony. Tony, who was his and to whom Steve belonged, at least until tomorrow.
Stark obviously wouldn’t be stupid enough to try anything now that Tony was Steve’s, though.  Still, whatever the situation, Tony sure as hell wouldn’t be going to visit his parents unattended, that was for sure, Steve thought as he poured lemonade into two tall glasses. He didn’t want to ban Tony from seeing his parents, especially if he was wrong about the elder Stark--surely he was, wasn’t he?  It was his own hang-ups, seeing ghosts around every corner, that was more likely--but if Tony wanted to go for a visit and Steve couldn’t go with him, Happy would accompany him, at the very least. Hogan was amiable and eager to please where Tony was concerned, but along with his driving credentials, he
“Steeeeve,” Tony moaned, throwing his hands up in the air and letting them slam back down on the bed with a loud smack.  “You let them tell the world Captain America was found so…so they wouldn’t be mean to me?” Tony spluttered.
“I am,” Tony replied, fingers tapping on the edge of the chair. “You said you needed me for something.  That it was important.  So, here I am.  Ready to assist my friendly government spy agency in any way I feel like.”  Tony nudged the suitcase armor that was leaning against Fury’s desk with his foot, just to be sure Fury understood where he was coming from.
“Your Majesty, on behalf of the Ridge, I’d like to present you with some gifts, which, I believe, you will find to be a testament to the Deep Illum’s bounty,” Lord Rand was saying, drawing Steve’s attention to where he stood next to his son, who took a box from one of the overseers, opened it, and presented it to Tony with a formal bow.  “Illum gold. The finest in the world,” Lord Ridge added with a note of pride. “A scepter, to mark the occasion of your visit, crafted by our finest smiths. May it please you, Your Highness.”
“Yes,” Steve answered honestly.  “Can I, uh…” he stammered, glancing sheepishly down at Tony before his gaze lowered.
“Great. Fine.  Have your lawyer give them the once-over.  They’re the same damn things as before, Steve, so don’t start playing the martyr now,” Tony ground out.  “Look, forget it. Sign ‘em, don’t sign ‘em, whatever.  I’m done.”
Steve made a strangled sound in his throat as Tony reached back and cupped the globes of his ass, kneading the soft flesh and pulling him apart just enough so that he felt the tug at his hole, the cold burn of air, the jolt of being exposed, before releasing him and settling his hands on Steve’s waist again.  The pads of Tony’s thumbs were rubbing circles into Steve’s skin on each side of his stomach.  Steve’s cock twitched and rose, pressing against the fabric of the drape, lifting it, like some kind of strange show, revealing him a little at a time.
Tony stared up at him, wide-eyed, too stunned to speak.  He didn’t know what he would say, until he did.
“Well, I mean, it’s just theory, right, so.  That kind of thing, it’s probably hundreds of years off, if that,” Tony pointed out.  “We’re nowhere close.  Though—it is, of course, possible that if something like that did exist, we wouldn’t be the ones who created it.  Given the size of the universe, it isn’t just possible that intelligent life has arisen elsewhere, it’s likely.  Also, given the scale of distances and the energy involved in trying to traverse them, any advanced alien race that needed or wanted to expand beyond their local galaxy would need to create things like Einstein-Rosen bridges to get around, unless there is some law of physics we haven’t come across yet that would let them routinely not just break lightspeed, but wildly surpass it.  Getting around the universe is a bit like crossing Africa, the Pacific and Atlantic if you’re an ant.  Really going to need a better mode of transportation.”
There was a strangled, gasping half-whine that rent the room.  It took a moment for Steve to realize it had come from him.  He was already moving to obey Tony’s command, all graceless, gangly limbs and shaking muscles.
“Like to build things. Take things apart, put them back together,” Tony told him. “Most of its useless, but some of it could be something. Maybe. One day. I don’t know. I had some ideas, crazy though they might have been, once upon a time. Granted, it took a tiny near death experience for inspiration, so I’d rather not repeat that, but, sometimes, I think there was something there. I don’t know. Old habits die hard, you know? Can’t just up and change who you are.”
“He’s going to kill them all,” Tony said in flat voice that was probably acceptance on its best day, if you squinted and wore blinders.
He looked up at Steve, who was watching him with his head titled to the side, studying, the way Steve sometimes looked at a chess board when he was trying to figure out what move Tony was going to make.  Steve’s gaze roamed over him, leaving a trail of warmth.  As Tony watched, Steve’s eyes dipped down, lingered on the mug for a moment, then found Tony’s again.
“I was told I didn’t have a choice,” Barnes said, pushing past Nat and Rhodey to step into the apartment.
His dreams were filled with strange images, all mixed in together. Memories, some of them, replaying in his mind like he was watching one of Howard’s old movie reels.  Things he was sure he had never seen before, though he had no idea if they were real or something his subconscious made up to process everything that had happened to him.  They twisted and intermixed with his own memories, until he could barely keep up with what was his dream and what was...something else. Tony was aware, in the dream, that he was dreaming, except he wasn’t really sure that he actually was, in fact, dreaming.  It wasn’t like any other dream he had ever had. The detail was too crisp in places, the feelings associated with the images, too real.
The creature hummed a sort of low, trilling sound through its gills that sounded a lot like an agreeable sort of laugh, then dipped below the surface and came out spouting an arc of water from its mouth that hit Steve square on the cheek, then grinned with what Steve wanted to call triumph and disappeared under the water before Steve could manage to retaliate.
“That one’s more trouble than he’s worth, my Lord, I assure you.  We have far finer available.  Well-trained.  Docile.  From the finest pleasure houses in the East.  More suited to someone of your stature,” the loud voice of one of the overseers—Rumlow, his mind supplied with a surge of hate—snapped, punctuated by a light crack of the ever-present leather whip the man carried across Steve’s chest, more a warning than anything.   They wouldn’t mark him, not now, anyway.  Despite his words, Rumlow slithered over to stand next to the finely-robed man whose eyes were roaming up and down Steve’s body with a speculative gaze.
The deep pit of humiliation opened up again every time he thought about it.  Why had he expected anything else?  It wasn’t like he hadn’t known what he was getting himself into.  He’d just chosen to pretend it wasn’t what it was because that was easier than accepting the truth.  Deceiving himself was not something he was usually so willing to do, and it frustrated him to no end that he’d let himself get so deeply entangled here when he should have known better, even had Bucky pointing the whole sordid thing out to him and still let himself believe there was more to it.
“What do your parents think of all this?” Tony heard himself ask as he clicked the front door shut behind him.  He hadn’t meant to ask that.  He hadn’t meant to ask anything, really, but found he was more curious to know the answer than he’d realized.
Cam looked over once more at Steve, then darted out of the room, like he was afraid staying any longer would risk whatever had just happened.   Steve couldn’t blame him.  His own head was reeling.  It felt a bit like the time he and Bucky got it in their heads to roll down the big hill out east of the pasture, which ended up with the two of them hurtling down towards O’Bannon’s cows, head over legs, like two small, shrieking rocks.  When he finally rolled to a stop, Steve remembered looking up and seeing the sky spinning as fast as a top while a large, brown cow shoved her wet nose in his face and Bucky’s howls of laughter rang in his ears.  It had taken his mind a long time to settle and catch up then, long enough for Bucky to proclaim that cow was Steve’s best shot at romance.
“Well, what happens when they find out Howard won’t let me near any of the company stuff?” Tony demanded.
“Someone did the homework,” Steve observed, though the rebuke was more along the lines of weary acceptance, Tony thought. “And it’s not really your concern.”
“Anyway, Peter said when the train stopped, the nuns got them all out and took them to this church in the middle of town, and all these moms and dads came to look them over, see which orphans they wanted,” Steve continued.  “’Cept Peter, see, he didn’t like the looks of the people who picked him. Said they just wanted someone to work their farm, not like a real kid, you know? So, he ran away, all of eleven, mind you, and somehow made it down to New Orleans and onto a ship bound for Barbados, which is how he got himself hired on with Stark Trading Company.  Pretty impressive for just a kid, right?” Shellhead nodded, once, slowly, a grimace spasming over his face before it was quickly wiped away.
“Why in the world would you--why would do that?  Why--why does it even matter?” Steve demanded, shaking his head back and forth. “You don’t even know me. This is--this whole thing--you, you’re crazy.”
“History is still exactly the same we left it,” Tony replied glumly as he shut the door.  “In so many ways.  Steve’s place, Happy,” he called out with a disgruntled look at Steve, who was staring at the back of Happy’s head like he could will the man to go faster.  Lost cause, Tony thought, as the car rolled forward and edged carefully into traffic while the three of them huddled in the back seat, with Steve’s backpack on the floor between his knees.
“Do you want kids?” Tony asked, trying to keep the panicked surprise out of his voice.  Did he want kids?  The idea had been so far off his radar, he hadn’t given it more than a passing thought in years.  Well.  Probably at least a decade.
A fireplace dominated one wall, set in a mosaic that glittered as the flames moved, casting colored lights across the ceiling.  The fireplaces corbels were undulating bodies of stone, and the mosaic itself depicted nude figures writhing around on a golden bed, not unlike the huge bed that sat across the room.  Steve stared at it in amazement. It was nothing like anything he had ever seen before.  Shrouded by sheer, golden draperies, the bed was on a raised dais, and covered in long, rounded pillows in a rainbow of silks and a red coverlet shot through with gold threads that reached all the way to the floor.  Each of the posters was a finely carved figure, nude and undulating, with arms extended above to hold up the bed’s canopy.
“Oh my God.  The gift certificate to go ATV-ing for my birthday,” Rhodey burst out suddenly, slamming his hands on the counter and spinning around to face Tony.  “You literally sent me to a place where I could go on an actual three-wheeler.”
He spent the rest of the night thinking about what might be an appropriately conciliatory activity, finally settling on ‘breakfast,’ right before he dragged himself out of bed and to the sink, where he splashed cold water on his face.  He looked up at his reflection in the bathroom mirror.  He looked…tired, yes, true enough, but…he braced his hands against the marble and let his head dip down to his chest.  Damn it.  But he also looked excited as hell, and he wasn’t exactly blind to the reason.
“Okay, okay, I get it,” Steve said around a laugh, rubbing at the side of his head.  “You liked it, huh?” Shellhead nodded again. “I liked it, too.” Shellhead answered with a soft smile that slowly turned into a low, wet snickering laugh.
Bucky stared at him a long moment, then let out a sigh and rolled his eyes to the ceiling before walking over and slinging his good arm around Steve’s shoulders.  “You know I love you, man.  I just hate all this stuff, and I’m so fucking sorry for not seeing it before it was too late.”
“You.  Please, Steve! Aah-ahaha—ahhhh,” Tony wailed as a third finger joined the others, stretching him wide.  He lost the ability to speak, just snapped his eyes open and stared, glass-eyed, at the ceiling while Steve worked him.  His cock kept rubbing against the front of Steve’s uniform, leaving a trail of precum just under the star, and when he finally looked down, the combination of Steve’s leather-clad fingers pushing away the emptiness inside him only to leave a deeper ache in their wake, the friction of his cockhead against the rough Kevlar and the trail of clear liquid dangling between the tip of his cock and the Captain America uniform was enough to push him over the edge.
“I can't, Tony. I'm sorry,” Steve said again, more firmly this time, with an air of finality that made Tony want to physically recoil. “I shouldn't've done this. That. This was a mistake. Coming here. I knew I shouldn't—but, I wanted to see you and I--I have to go. That appointment. I have to go,” Steve repeated, a note of desperation in his voice, before he shifted his stance, brow drawing together and eyes fluttering shut for a flicker before finding Tony again. “I can't do this. This—this thing with you. What you—what you said. I can't, Tony. I'm sorry.”
Carefully, Steve tugged at the plug, feeling it move easily inside the man, then slowly worked it out, leaving the stranger’s hole gaping wide, dark and red-rimmed. It was a nice effect. He stared at it for a moment, then walked back over to the chair and shed his clothes. His cock jutted out, dripping ripe beads from the head. He stroked his hand over it a few times, spreading the liquid around, then reached for a particular bottle of lube. It felt more equal, him being naked, too. And more intimate. He didn’t want to think about why that mattered. He didn’t want to think at all. That was why he was here.
He’d been near Brooklyn, heading to meet up with Steve for lunch, when Frick and Frack there pulled their little scheme to get him to stop long enough to have a gun shoved in his face, so maybe somewhere relatively nearby.  At least that meant that if he could escape, raise attention or get to a phone somehow, help wasn’t too far away.  If he was lucky, he might be able to get out of this before Steve even realized anything other than traffic had gone wrong, but as the time ticked by, he could almost see Steve looking down more and more at his watch, wondering where Tony was, telling himself not to worry, that it was nothing, but starting to panic nonetheless.  Ever since Afghanistan, Steve got a tad touchy about Tony not showing up when he was supposed to, though Tony supposed that was understandable, all things considered.
“I can't handle losing you again, Tony. Please don't ask it of me,” Steve said softly. He pulled the door open and stepped out into the hallway, closing it behind him and leaving Tony alone in the apartment.
“Get it,” Tony urged, leaning back in the chair until he was almost sliding off of it. There was a pile of clothes and shoes next to him on top of the one the displays, and he had his elbow propped on the leather jacket, his head resting against his fist.  “If you don’t get it, I swear to God, Ralph Lauren himself is going to rise from the grave and come haunt you.”
,” she called out with a savage snarl curling around her words.  He looked over his shoulder and saw her waving, bright, sharp fingers glinting in the lamplight.  He wanted to run.  This woman, whoever she was, she was poison.  The idea of Tony being with someone like that cut a jagged line across his heart, sending  a sharp, bitter pain through his chest.   Why would he want her? What could someone like this possibly have offered him?  A surge of hatred welled up inside him.  He slowed, and turned, staring at her.  A seething, roiling rancor that tasted sour on his tongue sparked deep inside him.  She wasn’t worthy of being anywhere near Tony.  Who was she to treat someone like Tony that way?
“Breathe,” the King said, almost gently.  Steve blinked at him.  Finally, the tight coldness in his chest registered and he sucked in a breath.  “Good,” the King said, then leaned forward and took Steve in his mouth again.  The King wound his tongue around the head, smearing the droplets that had gathered there, and then started to suck, making some kind of obscene wet, sucking moan as he did. He flattened his tongue and worked the underside of Steve’s cock, laving wide strokes over it, then found the slit and niggled his tongue up and down and inside of it.
“Get out,” Tony said flatly, then stalked over to his worktable and slammed the hammer down, making the items on the table jump and roll.
“Okay, so we’re just done with talking, I guess?  Tones, you wanna help me out here?”  Rhodey asked glibly, quirking his eyebrow at Tony and jerking his head towards Steve.
“Yes,” Tony said with a short nod.  He looked up at Steve, who gave him a small, encouraging smile in return.  “That sounds…are you using gravitational radiation?”
Movement out of the corner of his eye had Steve looking up, across the room, where a white-coated waiter pointed Steve’s way.  Behind a couple being seated and another waiter with a tray full of silver-domed entrees, Steve could see a dark head bob, and then suddenly the sea of people parted and Steve’s stomach lurched, then sank as recognition hit. Well.  Natasha hadn’t been lying about the rich, smart and good-looking parts, that was one thing, Steve thought with a flash of annoyance, though a good portion of it was directed at himself for not seeing through the ruse.
The room was quiet without Cam’s boisterousness or the telltale clangs of Tony working in his shop.  It was too early for a fire in the hearth, and the guards were stationed outside since Tony was not there, leaving Steve to a rare moment of total privacy.  He took off the robe and undid the chain around his waist, dropping both onto a nearby chair.  Cam or one of the servants would pick them up tomorrow.   He wondered when he had gotten so used to that.
“God, you’re amazing, you know that, right? Jesus Christ,” Tony breathed out, slowly shimmying down a bit as Steve’s hands fell away, and pushing himself up into a sitting position with his knees braced tightly along Steve’s hips. He raked his hand through his hair, leaving it a mass of unruly curls.  His cheeks were flushed, and his skin glistened in the cool, blue glow of the pool lights. It occurred to Steve that perhaps the most beautiful man he had ever seen in real life was sitting on his cock, utterly unabashed.
Steve released Tony’s hand, having forgotten he was still clinging to him, then walked down towards the tent where it stood some paces down from the Sept. It looked huge against the barren backdrop, rivaling only the ruined Sept for stature.  He turned once, just before he ducked inside the tent, and saw Tony still standing where he had left him.
“Think you stole my line,” Tony retorted.  “Hell, if I’d seen you in this, I may have paid you to keep your clothes on.  Er, well. Probably not. Let’s face it, I’ve been thinking about you without your clothes since we met,” he shrugged and grinned.   “Speaking of, technically, you still owe me that dance, you know. Keep playing your UNO cards right, and I’ll have to collect one of these days,” Tony grinned, leaning up to lightly nuzzle Steve’s lips in a barely-there kiss that somehow seemed to have some kind of direct line to Steve’s cock.
The long case with the gauntlets was next.  He really was going to have to figure out a better way to transport this stuff.  Five cases was a tad impractical without a supersoldier around to lug it for him, he thought with a sigh.  The pad blinked green under his thumb and the locks snapped open.  He lifted the lid, then blinked, heart clutching in his chest as his eyes burned and vision blurred.
“What’s wrong with him?” Steve asked.  He could feel a slight frown pulling at the center of his forehead.  The doctor took a deep, bracing breath, as if the trials and tribulations of this Omega weighed heavily on her.
“I’ll just...I’ll go,” Steve offered quickly. Some part of his mind, way in the back, deep down and buried against his spine, was starting to thrum with alarm. Flee, it demanded, that deep-knowledge that comes alive in the dead of night.  Flee this place, this man. Which was ridiculous, Steve knew, the man was just a man, smaller in stature than Steve, though you didn’t notice it at first since he seemed to exude prominence in a way that Steve didn’t think he would ever manage.  The man held no weapon, had not raised his voice or called for assistance to have Steve tossed out.  There was no reason to be afraid, Steve assured himself firmly.  This was all just a misunderstanding.  One of his own making, not the man’s, after all.
“No, no, its good. Great. Whatever,” Tony bit out, then let out a sigh. “You've got to go. Hand doctor, and all that. Good luck with that, by the way,” Tony said, more waspishly than he meant to, but he couldn't seem to stop himself. There was picking at a scab and then there was a good, old-fashioned drawing and quartering of a scab, and he'd never done things in half-measures. “Just go. You're right. This was stupid. I don't know what I was thinking. Thanks for the papers. My people will, you know, call your people. Person. Can he find his phone? Anyway. They'll handle it from here.”
about him, for God’s sake?  It was pathetic.  Tony had a ton of other things--important things--to think about, not some random guy he slept with on some stupid whim.
“That’s good,” Steve said. “Got you a couple of things,” he added, nodding at the bag and cup on the counter.  “You should probably take it easy, though.  Maybe some toast first, see how it goes.”
The bed sat in the center, buttressed by a small, wooden nightstand with a simple lamp, the kind that came out of a box with the shade already on it.  A dresser was pushed against the wall closest to the door.  It was wooden like the nightstand, but a lighter wood, knobbier and chunkier, like it was aiming for rustic charm and accidentally ended up at a Cracker Barrel Country Store.  Clearly something that came with the cabin’s ragtag assortment of Duck Dynasty rejects, Tony thought with a slight smile.  He kind of loved the objectively horrid décor.  It was strangely comforting after years of living in a place with a carefully crafted veneer of beauty meant to hide the decay and rot.
The cookout went well, Tony thought a few hours later while he tied the plastic bands together on the garbage bag and set it outside his door.  Jane had been brimming with information from her conference, and, rather surprisingly, the two lawyers were actually fairly entertaining once you got past the whole divorce thing.  They reminded Tony a bit of him and Rhodey when they were fresh out of school.  Minus the alcoholism, black hole of self-esteem issues and crushing spiral of poor life choices that Tony had been trying to dig his way out from under, but, otherwise, tons of similarities.
“I do,” Fury said, pushing himself off the edge of the desk and going back around to his chair.  “Howard Stark will take one look at all that shiny chest metal in the room and would cut off his own arm to have a son-in-law who garners that much interest from the brass, trust me.”
A trio of talking heads who Steve was fairly sure had never been in the same room with Tony argued back and forth for a few minutes while Steve listened with increasing annoyance.  He knew he should change the channel or turn it off, but he couldn’t seem to resist hearing what they said about Tony.  So much for not thinking about him.
“Uh…Steve?  It’s Tony,” Tony managed, bringing the phone back to his ear.  “Tony Stark.  Your Tony. I mean, not—look, the point is.  The point—I have a point, hang on.  Oh, right. I’m possibly–er, probably?  Yes. Probably very drunk.  Very,
“He’s...he’s starting his own business,” Steve said, shifting uncomfortably under Stark’s scrutiny. “It takes a lot of time to get something like that going. And I don’t know what you’re looking at, but Brock was honorably discharged,” Steve added with a frown.
The gardens were lovely.  Trees dripped long sleeves of branches down to the ground.  Vines climbed the walls, laden with fragrant flowers in all manner of colors.  A large fountain bubbled in the center, with a statue pouring a continuous stream of water from an upturned vase in the center and dolphins leaping from her feet.  Steve sat down on the edge and looked inside, where a collection of coins lined the bottom.  He wondered at their purpose.  To his right, laughter erupted, and he turned, watching a group of courtier’s children enjoying a puppet show where a hapless knight appeared to be attempting to take on a dragon, who seemed to want to sleep far more than it wanted to provide its head for the glory of said knight.  It kept refusing to fight, shaking its head and curling up to loud snores, much to the delight of the children.
“Sure,” Steve said, shooting a quick, quizzical look at Tony.  “Happy to oblige.  I’ll pay for the damage to your station, of course. Wouldn’t want the taxpayers stuck with the bill.”
Brock launched into a description of plans that Steve didn’t pay enough attention to in order to really be able to follow it.  Brock always had plans.  Big plans, which often seemed to Steve to hinge on him not having to do a whole lot to earn the money he seemed to think was out there, though, if Brock really could make that kind of money without working all that hard for it, more power to him.
“I do believe he likes you,” a voice said from behind him.  Steve jumped, spinning around, and stared in stunned silence at the man who was standing by the overstuffed chair that held the suit of armor. The man who had definitely not been there just a moment before.
“Oh, yeah, run away!  Run to Jarvis or your mom.  Run away, great. Fucking typical, isn’t it?” Howard’s voice, thick with disgust-fueled rage, the words slurring together, followed him down the stairs until the man himself came into view, eyes burning, face blistered with anger.
Probably best not to think about Steve and his appetites, though, Tony thought.  All things considered.  Or, all things we definitely weren’t considering, no Siree.
“I couldn’t…even then, I couldn’t let that go.  That was the place I’d been the happiest in my whole misbegotten life, and even if it was all a lie, I still couldn’t—they were putting in granite!  Granite, Steve. Can you imagine? Mass hysteria, I’m telling you,” Tony groused, looking down at his plate and feeling a bit abashed about the whole thing.
“Yeah, I got that much figured out on my own,” Steve grimaced.  “How, ah, how much of a problem was that?”
“Ummm,” Tony hummed. “Wait until you see the latest designs. I have an idea for a pulley system that will be able to lift us up the tower portion without even needing stairs. I saw something used for cargo down at the wharf and thought…” It was enough of an opening to keep Tony talking animatedly the rest of the way back to the Tower, though Steve caught Tony’s enthusiastic explanations falter for a moment as he looked over at Steve out of the corner of his eye. Servants stopped what they were doing, bowing or curtseying as he and Tony walked past, but the curious, sometimes hostile, looks Steve remembered had been brushed away, replaced with welcoming courtesy and the occasional, if quickly hidden, ribald smile. They liked seeing their King happy, Steve thought, wondering if he was the only one who could see the smile plastered on Tony’s face was pinched with too much strain, the excitement in his voice taking on a nervous sort of intensity as they got closer to the Tower.
Advantages. Because Steve would have an Omega, and SHIELD could check that box off, or whatever it was they thought they were accomplishing with this.
He paints his nightmares, though.  Whatever those things are, they aren’t what he wants to create.  He draws for me, Tony thought, glancing again at the sharpie-decorated refrigerator door.  He only draws for me.
tell her.  Last time he had seen her, she’d been on one of her file-delivery missions for SI, bringing a briefcase full of work to the house for Howard.  She’d always been nice, though.  Listened to him blather on long past any sane person’s actual interest, unless you were a British butler with a guilt complex.
“Um.  Tempting, Bread, very tempting.  But, how about no and maybe you just fuck off instead?” Tony asked in an utterly unconcerned voice.
He was really going to have to take that thing apart. Take it apart into tiny, little pieces. And then melt them. You're going to make a lovely ashtray, Tony silently warned the clock, which responded with dutiful ticking.
Okay, no, that was one of the websites Coulson warned him about, Steve blinked, clicking the back arrow as quickly as he could.  And Tony definitely did not want that from Steve.
“And I believe you did it because you’re you.  You’re a better man than you give yourself credit for,” Steve said. “If you would just—"
Tony caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror above the dresser and rolled his eyes. Good Christ. Fucking figures, he thought with a wave of frustrated disgust. He looked like a Chia pet someone watered on one side. Calling his hair a lost cause probably did a disservice to lost causes everywhere, so instead of trying to smooth his hair down, he ran both hands back and forth through it, wringing it out into messy curls, before flopping down on the bed. The wooden beams of the ceiling jutted up into an A-shaped arc over his head, with the ceiling fan hanging from the center, the blades undulating in hypnotically slow circles above his head.
Steve had the file memorized. He wondered which part Fury was reading.  Page three, halfway down, it said that Anthony loved to read and was passionate about music.  Page four, he often spent his time helping the family’s butler with various tasks, like preparing dinner for the family or tidying the house.  Page seven explained that he was in excellent health and gave a few statistics, height, weight and a fairly unremarkable medical history. Broken arm from falling out of a tree seemed to be the worst of it.
The current Lord of the Ridge, Lord Rand, was waiting with his son at the bottom, both decked out in their finery, Steve saw as they approached.  Tony alighted from his carriage, and both Lords Rand went to one knee, along with their retinue of guards, nobles and the like who had come to greet the King.  Steve could only see Tony’s back from his vantage in the carriage, but Steve could see him gesturing widely, as he often did when he talked. By the time Steve’s carriage ground to a halt, sending up a plume of chalky dust under its wheels, their hosts were rising and greeting Tony with a warm familiarity.
“I have wanted to do that all day,” Tony whispered on a sigh.  “You were so beautiful.  I could hardly keep my eyes off you.  I could almost see your mind turning the whole time,” he grinned.  “You will have much to say, I’m sure.  I must admit, I am rather eager to hear your thoughts.  Strucker is capable, but a relic, and his engineers do little that hasn’t already been done enough times to be taught at university.  He lacks…imagination.  Something I think you have in abundance, God help me,” he finished with a quirk of his head and easy smile.
Steve would call it making love, and Tony supposed that was just as true, if not as descriptive.  He loved Steve with every fiber of his being.  He loved Steve’s mind, agile and brilliant in ways that Tony often found himself grasping only later, after everything had fallen into place in some life-sized chess game that only Steve could see sometimes.  He loved Steve’s body, all carefully controlled power and violence that Steve used as some kind of shield against a world he didn’t quite trust with Tony.  He loved Steve’s heart, which insisted on seeing the best in people, on believing in what could be rather than what was, and miraculously, which he gave to Tony for safekeeping.  He loved Steve’s soul, this glowing, warm, soft place that cradled all of Tony’s hopes and dreams, his pain and failures, all of it, all of Tony, and reflected it all back at him with nothing less than some kind of Goddamned miracle of absolute acceptance.
“No!” Tony said suddenly, reaching up with the hand that had been holding Steve’s hip to bat Steve’s arm from his face.  “Let me see you.  I want to see you when you take my cock.”
Steve cried out, a harsh, agonized sound like a wounded animal. His orgasm slammed into him so hard it made his ears ring. No. Wait.
He hugged Tony tighter to him and felt himself drifting off to sleep, the blue glow of Tony’s arc reactor the only thing between them.
“I’ve never seen the like,” Steve admitted.  He lay back down and scrubbed a hand over his face, though kept his other hand bound with Tony’s. Steve breathed out through his nose, tasting the acrid burn of phantom smoke in the back of his throat. He felt Tony’s hand tighten on his and flexed his fingers into a squeeze in response.
Steve shook his head and swiped a hand over his face, trying to clear his mind.  Father Flannery would tell him to pray more, no doubt, to curb such wicked thoughts, but that hadn’t worked when he was thirteen and he somehow doubted it would work now, stuck in the middle of nowhere with only the creature for company.  Sometime after Fredericksburg, he had made a deal with the Almighty that he could allow himself the stray licentious thought, so long as he never acted upon them, and he had kept to his word, hadn’t he? He was an artist, wasn’t he? And the creature was beautiful, the way a--a lion or a tiger was beautiful, nothing more. By any measure, the creature was extraordinary to look upon, if only for its utter unusualness, and particularly pleasing when its tentacles shone red and gold.  Watching it change to match its environment was fascinating, to be sure, but Steve could admit to being partial to the bright, bold colors it usually favored when it was just swimming about or reclining on the sand. So, yes, if he were being objective, the creature was...not unpleasant to look upon, at least.
Of course, Steve couldn’t understand any of that.  Not that he would have a good answer, even if he did. The truth was, they hadn’t had many good hunts lately because Tyber wasn’t a particularly good hunter, but insisted on leading the hunting party anyway, and the fish weren’t gone, just faster and more clever than Tyber, but Anto suspected that blaming the Other in their midst was a lot easier than admitting to those failings, though he knew, without quite knowing how he knew, that what Tyber was really upset about was that Anto had not been himself lately, and he blamed Steve for this.  Which…wasn’t entirely wrong, though Anto couldn’t let Tyber know that, not if he wanted to get Steve out of here alive.
“My place has only ever been by your side,” Steve insisted, watching the play of emotions across Tony’s face as he swallowed heavily. Hope, fear, and a desperate kind of aching need, like Steve was offering him something vital.  “I owe you everything.  I owe you all of me,” Steve insisted stubbornly.  “I would give that to you, if you would have me. Whether we say the words here, under the stars, or beneath gilded ceiling, as long as I am with you.”
Tony eyes fell shut for a moment, and breathed out through his nose.  Just get Steve out of here, he told himself.  He stood as still as he could, careful not to move and make it worse, except the longer Steve stayed, the worse it would be.  God damn it.  God damn it, he hated this.  He fucking hated this.
Steve didn’t really have anything to say to that.  Bucky had hated this whole idea from the moment Clint brought it up.  And it wasn't like Bucky was exactly wrong, after all. It was a terrible idea.  Hadn’t he decided last night that he was done with this?  He had to admit that he was less sure of that than he had been when he’d agreed to it on the phone earlier with Ms. Romanov, now that the moment was upon him.  But…it had been okay last night.  Better than okay, if he was honest with himself.  It was hard to admit enjoying something like that, but he couldn’t deny that when Ms. Romanov had said Tony wanted to see him again, something sharp and hot had spiked through his chest, settling low in his stomach.  He was pretty sure it was anticipation.
“I don’t know if I ever apologized for what I said on the carrier.  I know Loki and that scepter were working on us, but I made a lot of assumptions about you from what I read in your file.  I was wrong, and that’s on me.  I guess--we’re friends now, you said, so--I guess we found a way to work it out?” Steve said, making the last sound like a question.
The most creative of people are motivated by the grandest of problems presented before them, Neil offered, popping back up on the screen with brightly-colored enthusiasm.
Defendant is hereby ordered not to abuse Complainant by physically harming, attempting to physically harm or placing Complainant in fear of imminent physical harm, and to stop harassing Complainant by any willful and malicious conduct aimed at Complainant and intended to cause fear, intimidation, abuse or damage to property.
“So…so, at work today, Bucky, my friend Bucky, he welded a man into a toilet,” Steve said, smiling at the memory.
Tony could feel the press of Steve’s finger against the tags, just hard enough to flatten them into Tony’s skin, where he could feel it.  His heart was thundering against his chest.  He wondered if Steve could hear it, it seemed so loud, like when you hid as a kid and tried to be quiet.
“It’s okay. It is.  I get it. I do,” Tony rushed out.  “It’s fine, Steve. Cap.  What—uh.  What do I call you?”
Pushing the flap aside, Steve stood just inside the tent’s entrance, looking at, but not seeing, the opulence around him. His mind was a dark whirlpool of tumultuous thoughts. He knew he shouldn’t have said anything, let alone nearly broken the table. For a lot of reasons, most of them centering on Tony and what Steve’s outburst might mean for him. For them . It was short-sighted and stupid, and likely he had played right into Ross’ hands. He had little doubt the General had been looking for a rise out of Steve. Or Tony. Though, why—since he had never met the man—he couldn’t fathom.
“But, I looked at your picture.  You were—even then, God.  You were fighting this unwinnable fight.  Everyone was making all these decisions for you, about who you were supposed to be, and you were trying so hard to hang on to what you could be, and then I met you, and I…” Steve broke off, looked Tony up and down once, ground his jaw together and glanced away.
“You’re deliberately being a dick,” Tony replied with a touch of surprise that was more like realizing something he should have known.  “This is a thing you do. Picking at him, pissing him off. You’re trying to push him away, even if it means him hating you, but, I gotta tell you, and I don’t mean this as a criticism,” Tony said, holding up his hands in a placating gesture, “but, you’re really, really bad at it.  The paints?  Come on.”
“God punishes me by sending me my own reflection to look upon,” Tony mused, as he lifted the cloth and reached for the sliced meat and fruits underneath.  “Eat,” he encouraged Steve.  “And you, too, if you can rouse yourself,” he added, tossing a look over his shoulder at Cam.
He smiled, setting it carefully back down in the sand.  Shellhead’s penchant for gifting him with things he found on his foraging trips was something Steve thought was rather endearing, though Steve had to admit that he found it pretty amusing to imagine Shellhead scouring the deep for something appropriate to gift to Steve after last night.  Or maybe Shellhead had been saving it, hoarding it away with whatever other treasures the creature kept. Steve sometimes, in a flight of fancy, liked to think of Shellhead lording over some sunken wreckage, surrounded by pirate treasure, but he thought the shell was nicer in a way, because Shellhead had seen it, maybe in passing, maybe it just caught the light just right, and thought of Steve.
“I believe you, Tony,” Steve finally rasped out, one hand coming up to curl against Tony's back, rubbing up and down for a few, soothing strokes before he dropped it down to join the other at his side.
“You could do with an upgrade to image-intensified TV for your laser-guided munitions,” Tony called out over his shoulder, where Thing One or Thing Two, he couldn’t remember who was who, tapped out something on a tablet.  “And synthetic aperture radar that can operate in spotlight and strip modes.  Seriously, was this designed by Amish with some kind of moral objection to advanced technology?  Clue, was it delivered by covered wagon?  Think back.”
“Tony?” Coulson said, brows drawing together. “Hey, hey, you okay?  Breathe, Tony.  Breathe.”  Coulson reached out a hand and took Tony’s arm, tugging at him until Tony realized he had been listing backwards.
“How about one with a kiss?” the photographer called out, holding up his camera.  “Come on, you’re newlyweds, right?” he urged.
Steve shook his head at the boy’s clear delight at the tale’s rendition.  The story seemed to grow slightly more dramatic with each retelling, but the substance remained the same.  Hammer kept his life, but only by crawling from the throne room to the city gates, and while Steve had no doubt the citizenry quite enjoyed the spectacle of someone like Hammer brought low, only a handful of people would ever understand why Tony demanded such a thing.  For me, Steve thought, the same warm tightness filling his chest as it had the first time Cam burst into Tony’s chambers with the news.
“I know, Tony,” Rhodey was saying. “I get this is hard. And I don't know what to tell you, except that you need to talk to Steve, because something happened, and I don't have the first clue what, but I don't think its what you think it was,” Rhodey replied.
Memories.  That’s what they had now, Tony thought, with a sigh.  Memories that were slowly casting off their taint and a boatload of shared regret. Maybe that was all they would ever have, but he couldn’t let this go without trying for something more.  The whole thing was crazy.   Buying buildings, putting the band back together, the pseudo-stalking that he was currently doing…it wasn’t like he didn’t realize how insane it all was when you got down to it.  But, Steve had gotten him checks and read his thesis and held onto Ursa Major for as long as he could.  And now, Tony was on a bus, and Steve was making some kind of an effort, even if it was half-hearted and tinged with resignation.
He hated this.  He hated his body, and that it didn’t matter if he hated it, because it wasn’t listening to him, anyway.  He hated that it still felt good, even if he didn’t want to want it.  He hated this part, the mess, the evidence that he couldn’t control himself, that he wasn’t any different from any other Omega when you got right down to it, no matter how much he liked to tell himself he wasn’t like that.
“I don’t want to,” Steve said, though the words sat unnaturally in his throat even as he spoke them.  There was truth there, but a lie, too, and he could hear it, even if Tony couldn’t.  Tony’s hand froze, and Steve looked up, finding Tony’s eyes, intent and curious, though not angry.  Not yet, anyway.
“I'd like to keep it. For just me,” Tony said, holding Steve's gaze and watching for the flare of anger or surprise or something that wasn't this sad sort of acceptance that kept trying to creep over Steve's face. “If that's okay?” he couldn't help add, though he hated himself a little for it.
“He’s just—I mean, money doesn’t really mean anything to him.  This is nothing to him.  He probably just felt bad,” Steve stammered.
His voice sounded funny, even to his own ears.  Tinny and hollow, in a way it hadn’t sounded for a very long time.  Had he said that before?  The last time?  He’d gone over to what had been their apartment with the papers, full of pain trying its damnedest to be anger, and Steve had been unpacking a sound bar for the new TV, trying to scoop up the flecks of white Styrofoam wafting all over the place.
“How is he?” Tony asked, immediately hating the way his voice sounded.  Hesitant and forced, like he was trying to speak a different language, and maybe he was, at that.  One he still couldn’t comprehend, or didn’t want to. Same difference, he supposed.
“Yeah, that’s a hard no, gotcha,” Tony agreed, squelching up his face with a look of regret.  The elevator slid open, and they both stepped in, though Steve did manage one last look at Bucky, who mimed an obscene gesture with his hand and tongue, then gave Steve a thumbs’ up sign.  Steve sighed and flattened his mouth into a line as the doors closed, and he was alone with Tony again.
When Steve tried to call his mind to look back over the past month, it all had the soft-edged quality of a dream, unreality tugging at the corners until it seemed it would all fall apart if he tried to force it into focus. That first night, after he fell asleep with Tony by his side, he had woken up in his bed gasping for air, arms flailing out to grab onto something, anything, because he was sinking, sinking down into the too-soft bed, being swallowed by it.  He had disentangled himself from Tony’s embrace and curled on the floor between the bed and the door, moving his shield and sword to their usual places within reach and finally slept again, only to wake to the soft, dappled light of morning filtering into the room and the warm press of Tony’s body curved against his back.  He had been horrified, and tried to coax Tony back into bed, but Tony had just threaded his arms under Steve’s, wrapping one hand in Steve’s and laying it over Steve’s chest, before telling Steve to go back to sleep and promising to take care of it, though Steve had not known what that meant at the time.
“Tony, none of that stuff had anything to do with you.  Not even you can stretch your guilt complex that far,” Rhodey huffed.  “Spill.  Come on.  Did you sleep with him?  You slept with him, didn’t you?”
Tony leaned back in the chair, bouncing a little as one leg lifted off the bundle of napkins someone had shoved under it to balance it out. He could leave it alone, go back to his life and let this week be a lesson in crossing your T's and dotting your I's.
?” Steve demanded with a vicious sort of horrified rage that sent a spike of…something…down Tony’s spine.  Pride, power, need, mine, want,
Tony shoved the last quarter of a donut in his mouth and licked the pad of his thumb as he stepped into the elevator.  He hit the button for the executive floor, which housed Obie’s office, among others, and rocked back and forth on his heels as the elevator made the short trip.  Tapping the screen of the tablet in his hand, Tony pulled up the outline that Pepper had prepared for the Board and let his eyes wander over it one more time.  Between his impromptu brainstorming session with Steve last night and today’s meeting with Pepper and Rhodey, he was as ready as he could be for whatever objections Obie or anyone else on the Board might have.
“Bet you hoard the Draw Fours,” Tony accused lightly.  Steve tossed a look at Tony, where he stood—leaned, whatever—against Steve’s side.  “Lull everyone into a false sense of security.”
“Pretty sure Stane knows more than he’s letting on,” Steve said, leaning down and whispering the words in Tony’s ear.  Tony smiled, too bright, and chuckled lowly.
Damn, Tony mentally admonished himself.  Not exactly his finest moment here, he could admit.  He was freaking out, which was making Steve freak out for all the wrong reasons.  It was one thing for Steve to be pissed at him and want to run for the hills, it was entirely another for Steve to think Tony had basically slept with him and then wanted to dump him.
I wanted to believe him, Tony almost said, but it sounded far too pathetic when it echoed in his head.  I wanted to believe him when he said we were saving lives. When he said what we were doing was important.  When he said I was the only one who could figure something out, when he told me to focus on the projects that were going to keep our soldiers safe, I wanted to be
Steve lowered the phone from his ear and stared at it for a long moment. Relief washed through him, loosening muscles he hadn’t realized were tight. It was fine. He would go to the room, he would get this out of his system, and then… then things could go back to the way they were before. He wanted it to be that easy. Needed it to be that easy, desperately so. The constant barrage, over and over, invading his thoughts, his nightmares, he couldn’t keep on like this. The room helped before. He could only hope it would this time.
When he was ready, it was easier this time to just push in. The body accepted him without much resistance. He forced himself to take it slow this time. Savor it. He wasn’t sure how long it lasted, but he could hear soft, wrung-out cries from the other side of the room and felt the body around him shudder and slump with what Steve hoped was release, though he supposed it really didn’t matter, and there was some relief in that. Everything he did here was good enough. It was freeing in a strange way.
“They asked, and Steve, really, that’s his doing, not me.  Not really.  I just help out with a few things, here and there,” Tony said, hunching his shoulders a bit and making the chip bag crinkle again.  Damn it.
“Wow, Shellhead, I had no idea,” Steve said.  “That’s amazing. Do you build them sometimes, too?” To this, Shellhead just shrugged and grimaced.  “Hard to do out here, I guess,” Steve guessed, and Shellhead made a frustrated face. “Well, if your other ideas are anything like the pump, everyone back home would be really impressed, I’m telling you.  It’s too bad, you being, ah,” Steve broke off, clearing his throat, “stuck out here and...all,” he finished lamely.
Steve’s hands ran up and down Tony’s sides, over the curve of his ass and over the garters, then back up, sliding over the slip to tease Tony’s nipples, rubbing and pulling at the sensitive buds through the lace. Tony gave a long, keening moan. It was somehow better and worse, the way the lace felt on his nipples, soft and rough at the same time, like his mind couldn’t decide which sensation to feel.  His cock was painfully hard, throbbing and leaking with each tug or twist of his nipples, like there was a pathway between the two for pulses of pleasure to travel back and forth.
“Don't do this,” Steve breathed out, his hand flexing on the railing before he looked at Tony. “Can you just not make this any more difficult than it already is?”
The star relentlessly moved towards him.  That was odd. He couldn’t quite figure out why it was so odd, it just was.  He was feeling a bit lightheaded, if he was honest. Flying didn’t usually do that to him. He
“Move,” Steve said, and the throng of people who were hovering at the top of the stairs, probably trying to figure out what all the commotion had been, parted like the Red Sea.  Tony harrumphed a bit at the sight.  No slithering down the stairs, after all, he thought as Steve maneuvered them down.  The music was still loud and thumping all the way to the back of his brain, but it wasn’t quite as bothersome, not with his ear pressed against the curve of Steve’s arm.
“Oh, really?” Tony asked, low and lilting. “Tell me more. Tell me more about how you play with your tits when you’re by yourself,” Tony growled, leaning down with a low chuckle and whispering the last of it against Steve’s ear while his hand trailed up Steve’s chest, splaying in the center just so.
“Ah…let’s call it a glass paperweight,” Steve laughed, solid and genuine.  “They start you with just getting a feel for the way the heat works on the glass, how to move the blower, that kind of thing.  So, it kind of turned out to be a glob.  Bucky has it on his desk.  Calls it a high-class pet rock.  Nat kept moving it around the apartment and leaving it in random places, driving Buck crazy, so he got it mounted on this pedestal thing.  Then, she put some of those googly eyes and a little bow on it and had the pedestal engraved with Pretty Pretty Princess Award, and now he blames me.”
“Nat says she can track your phone, but it’s real late, Steve, and she’d like to go back to bed, so you going tell me where you are or are you going to make my wife fully wake up?  I’m going to need you to be a pal here, man, because she needs her eight hours or it’s--ow--I mean, to be fair, you do,” Bucky muttered.  “Dude.  Help me out.”
“Do a facial scan and calculate the angle of his jaw,” Tony mumbled to himself, then mentally braced himself.  Fury’s words had gotten under his skin because he knew he should have told Steve about the origins of SHIELD, but he hadn’t, in no small part because he hadn’t wanted Steve to rush back into things, and Tony knew him well enough at this point to know that the name Peggy Carter was like ringing a damned bell for him.
“No.  I just want to be clear that you are not, under any circumstances, to buy that man a hot tub just because he may have made a suggestion one day.  I mean it, Tony.  No hot tub,” Steve said firmly.
“Fuck,” Tony gasped, letting his head fall back against the chair and closing his eyes, a thin, wheezing breath escaping him.  He opened his eyes and looked down at Steve, chest heaving, eyes dark pools, cock held limp in his hand, with a few beads of white dangling from the tip.  “Fuck, Steve, God, look at you.  You’re gorgeous.
“I think the first time I really saw you was in that diner, explaining to me in an admittedly somewhat concerning level of detail exactly where Doofenschmirtz was going wrong. And that’s the person I’d like to see again,” Steve replied, turning around to look at Tony.
There should be shock.  Surprise.  Reprobation. Something.  But, there was nothing.  Just silence.  He hated them all a little then, even Peggy, who should have known what she was seeing.  Should have known what she was seeing.  Hell of a thing to hold against someone, Rogers, Steve thought bitterly.  Steve swallowed, throat clicking around something heavy sticking there, and watched the camera jostle as someone loudly and pointedly cleared their throat.  Daniel.  He had almost forgotten him.
“It’s an engineering marvel, really,” Tony said, causing Steve to turn to find him leaning back in his leather seat, his face mostly hidden by shadows. “We’d never built a concrete structure close to this size before.  Some of the methods they used, we’d never even tried them before. Sometimes you gotta run before you can walk, I suppose,” he finished with a small huff that was almost a sigh.
Steve pictured it in his mind. Tony, on red velvet, his limbs splayed wide with golden cords, skin alight in the glow of the fire while a feather danced up and down his gleaming cock.  Then, the vision changed, and it was Steve tied down--no, chains, he liked the feeling of the metal on his skin. Chains Tony made. And Tony over him while he begged for release, never getting enough friction from the feather to allow him to find it.  He swallowed thickly and licked his lips.
He just… he couldn’t keep the money.  That’s what it came down to.  He couldn’t.  It felt wrong.  Like he was taking something more than just money from Tony and had given up more than he ever intended, and if he kept the money, anything that came from it was going to feel tainted, too.  It didn’t quite make sense, even in his own head, but he had stood there at the bank window, utterly frozen, and the second he realized he simply couldn’t do this, it was like a weight had been lifted.  He just had to hope that Brock would understand.  It would have eaten away at him.  At them.  Like a poison pill they both willingly--eagerly--took.
“I hope so,” Steve said, giving Tony a quick look and flattening his smile before shifting around in his seat, like he couldn’t quite figure out how to pull off sitting casually without looking like he was trying to figure out how to pull off sitting casually.  “I just…want you to have a good time,” Steve finished, giving Tony a quick look before shoving his hands under the table and looking away.
“Guess that’s a no,” Tony grimaced.  The screen, Tony thought, watching the alien press his hands against whatever was there and close his eyes.  The alien made a little hiccupping noise, opened his eyes, then reached out to prod at Tony’s neck, where the lines of poison formed a maze-like pattern over his skin.
“No,” Steve replied, too quickly.  “No,” he repeated more firmly at Tony’s dubious look.  “It looks like it missed anything vital.  But.  Well, it’s still bleeding. Just a little.  I don’t have much of anything to pack and wrap it with though.  Nothing remotely sterile at any rate.”  The first thing he’d done after getting Tony settled was inventory the cabin, which had taken a depressingly short amount of time.  “Your kingdom for some duct tape,” Steve said with a shrug of his shoulders that he should have instantly regretted, but Tony smiled at that, and Steve decided it was worth it.
.  The thought hummed through him, unlocking some kind of release deep inside.  Everything else seemed to drift away, and he concentrated on that one thing. His limbs felt heavy, like he had sunk down into the bedding, and yet, he felt weightless at the same time.  Warmness ghosted over his skin. His breathing evened out. The thoughts in his mind quieted to whispers down deep in the dark recesses.
Steve smiled ruefully from behind his veil and felt his face flush with heat.  He was thankful no one else could see it, though he had no doubt Tony knew the effect his words had on Steve.  Steve bowed his head to Tony, then to the Lords Rand.
Dressing quickly, he stumbled a bit blearily to the communal kitchen and opened the refrigerator door, leaning in to see what leftovers might still be viable.  Which was when he heard the elevator ping behind him.  Since everyone else had their apartment on this floor, that meant only one person.  Fantastic.  Just what he needed to clear his head, Steve thought with resignation.  Sometimes he thought the universe was punishing him for his perverse thoughts.
When there was really nothing left to do in the bathroom except admit he was hiding, he dried his hands and opened the door, taking a step into the hall and listening.  The house felt empty, which was probably a weird thing to say, but he had years of figuring out when a place was empty and when it wasn’t.  This place felt empty.
“But, he doesn’t like me. Or, he does, but not the same way that I like him.  Which is fine, I get it.  I do.  That…that isn’t everything.  I know that,” Tony ground out harshly, mouth twisting around the bitter words.
Tony lifted Steve’s hips, holding him off the bed to get the right angle, thanking, well…himself…for the armor, and hell, God bless the Ten Rings, every one, because it was totally worth it if he got to do this. He pulled out fully, watching Steve’s hole wink invitingly at him, then slammed back in, again and again, hands digging into the soft flesh of Steve’s thighs, and in the armor, he knew, there would be bruises there, long and thin bluish-black lines that Tony had put there, and fuck if just thinking about it wasn’t enough to almost make him come.
see him, all of him, and yet, Steve knew there were parts of himself he kept locked away from Tony. He didn’t want to, but… he didn’t finish the thought, letting it flow away like the water.
“Tony makes very good things,” Steve agreed.  He hefted his pack onto his shoulders and bent down to pick up the spear that wasn’t broken.  “Ready to go?”
“Yeah, well.  Whatever. Party’s lame.  I was bored,” Tony said, frowning slightly with confusion and blinking owlishly up at Steve.  He swished a hand through the air, then his mouth twisted then, eyes narrowing. “Well, if you’re not part of Obie’s Little Boy Lost fantasy fulfillment department, that does beg the question what, exactly, you
“Tony’s certainly charming,” Stane agreed. He tossed an additional bet to the center of the table as others filled in the boxes with their own chips.  “Like his father in that, if not in other things. The company was Howard’s life’s work, you know. He poured everything into it. And look where it got us!  Manhattan Project. Apollo program. The branches tripping over themselves to get our contracts. Tony was like that. For a while. Now, though…now, Tony wants to go this whole other direction, which…I guess we can say he’s doing that in a few different areas, isn’t he? They say people sometimes do that after some kind of traumatic event.  Want to change everything. Kind of a temporary overcorrection, you might say.”
