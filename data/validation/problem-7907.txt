“Because omegas, omegas are not built like alphas and betas.”
Abruptly, the wolf lets go, its teeth extracting themselves from his skin and the wolf shuffling away. Tony plants his hands on the ground in front of him and makes to get up, slowly getting to his knees and then his feet.
Other things which Tony is grateful for include the
Steve’s hand slides down Tony’s ribcage, fingers digging into his sides. Steve has all of his back panels off, including the ones covering his ass. Testing, Tony moves a leg, trying to gain some leverage to get out from under Steve. Instead, Steve responds by hooking his feet over Tony’s ankles.
“And if I didn’t want to be ruined? What then?”
“Show me where in the laws that it says I can’t be allowed to use minor corporal punishment on omegas.” Steve had checked. Omegas had gained substantial divorce rights when it came to infidelity and abuse, but a spanking or restraint still wasn’t considered to be excessive. In Steve’s time, omegas could be collared and leashed, and were with regularity. Steve didn’t care either way about the public humiliation. It was simply another tool that alphas had used at the time. There were still plenty of options to pick from these days with Tony.
“Good boy, so good for me. Want to have you like this, always.” Steve has his forehead pressed to Tony’s collar bone as he pants out his words. Tony is doing this to his alpha, making him want to cum as soon as he was inside. Tony is gratified with this idea, his alpha, pleased, cumming and marking him up. Making him belong to Steve.
“He’s my friend.” Cap is on the ground now, and he looks up at Tony with imploring eyes, a warning that what comes next will be the end of things. Tony doesn’t heed it.
“Yeah, that seems good. Real silk? Rogers, you really did go all out for me.” Tony’s smile is cheeky, secretive like he knows something Steve doesn’t. Steve really wants to kiss him. Just gather the omega up in his arms and fasten his lips around Tony’s. He has to stop himself from thinking it, because he only gets one chance at convincing Tony to stay with him, and even then, if Tony kicks him out after, it’s done. It’s over with.
Tony fiddles with the panels on the arm, avoiding Bucky’s pursuing eyes. The man loves to look.
“Coulson said they needed me, but not that much,” Tony turned then, and stalked back over to Fury. “You overplayed your hand there a bit, Mr. Gothic Pirate. Tell you what, I’ll waive my customary retainer in exchange for a small favour or three. The first of which is that Rhodey and I are being honored in Washington and we need a presenter.”
Steve heads home feeling a renewed sense of purpose. Tony is still where he left him, in the workshop. Dinner that night is a sordid affair, with boiled down broccoli that is tasteless to the driest, most inedible chicken that Steve has ever encountered. It’s bland at worst, beyond consumption at best. Tony picks at it and Steve is certain he doesn’t eat more than one or two bites.
“Yes. If that’s what you wanted.” And oh, it hurts. His chest is tight and his limbs are starting to tense with the truth of what he’s saying. He doesn’t want Tony to go. He remembers how sweet Tony was after he’d been knotted. How pliant and lovely he was in the bath. The kindness that Tony exhibited when he checked on Steve’s nightmares. Tony
“Right.” Tony gets up and snatches the plate and sits back down. “You can go now.”
It’s been twenty-four hours and some change. He’s counted.
And then he sees it. In the mirror.
He’s lazing on an inflatable that holds about four people, if you’re ambitious, when rat snitch Pepper, the good time ruiner, shows up. Of course, she wants to talk, and Tony who doesn’t do that four-letter word, doesn’t want to.
and things. Not to mention the metal arm—an arm I designed for you, by the way.” He knows he’s whining, but Steve loves to spoil Tony, loves to give in and give Tony his every desire, and there may be a chance that Tony’s made it a habit.
“Steve, please!”
“You thinking of switching your designation?”
“There’s six pills. Spaced out a week each. He should take them with food. When the last pill hits, he’ll go into a dry heat. Are you ready for that?” They’re at the diner again, JARVIS on blackout. Bucky is obviously agitated. It’s been a week since Tony’s rut, and he’s made the apology rounds per usual, his worn-out face gracing each of their doorways as he mumbles through his sorries and his won’t-happen-again’s that everyone knows will mean nothing come three months from now. This time it feels worn out, the exhaustion seeping into everyone, including Tony.
He’s ready to move on. To move closer to Steve.
The Hulk roars again.
Steve feels his pants tighten as his cock takes a firm interest in the proceedings. Steve gently rests his wrist over the lump in his pants and tries to not breathe. Every time he does, he feels his dick expand a little more.
And what does he choose to think about? Steve, and how instinct is cruel to give him this in a way that makes a mockery of what he wanted. Steve is here because of Fury and his rut. He’s kind because Steve is always kind, except when Tony is unkind first. And he is always unkind, nowadays. But even when control is something that should be lost, Steve finds it in himself. Not like Tony, who can’t stop thinking about what it might be like, if it wasn’t just for his heat. And when it is his heat, he knows that Steve is his whole world, a warm and tender one where Steve soothes the savage energy that lives inside Tony. The thing that makes him create, destroy, self-immolate, and rise again. Steve makes that part of him pause, a reprieve from his very nature.
“You bastards,” Tony cursed under his breath. He pulled the wings tight to his back, or tried to. His brain was still acclimating to the extra limbs that were attached to him. Mostly the wings just did whatever they wanted, like lay waste to the surfaces of his workshop and any other countertop that had the gall to exist with stuff on it.
“Yes, I’ve thought about it,” he grits out.
“You want me to make it good baby? Fill you up?” Tony starts babbling, blaspheming god, and it’s not anywhere near coherent. With that, Steve pushes in, steady but quicker than he would have chosen, had Tony’s body not opened itself so beautifully to Steve. He feels Tony’s internal muscles give, and faster than he thought possible, he’s seated inside his Omega. It’s so disorienting, the feeling of everything funneling down to a single point that leads out of his cock. It’s everything. Tony is all that he’s ever needed.
Which is of course when Cap intervenes. Things get weird after that when the man flies at the Captain, hammer outstretched, and all Tony can think is that that’s going to hurt like a bitch.
Tony arches his neck to the side, allowing access, and begins to purr with pleasure. Steve drags his hand down Tony’s back and grabs at the swell of Tony’s ass, dimpling the skin and pulling at his rim again. It’s pink and glistening, and Steve leans down to lap at it, letting the analgesic from his saliva take care of the sting. He fucks his tongue in while Tony lets off a long and low moan, and Steve pries the tip of his tongue in, forcing it past the taut muscle.
Steve is lonely.
If only Tony ate breakfast.
As they walk towards the building, Steve wonders what he’s going to see today. He doesn’t know if he can bear the scrutiny of the omegas. It’s like they’ll be able to see that he’s hit Tony. They’ll somehow know.
“Tony. You’ve done so well. You’re perfect and mine, and I’m so pleased with you.” He praises Tony instinctively as he pets Tony’s shuddering sides and flanks.
“I suppose you know where to find one?” Steve, who has already inventoried the kitchen, does. He pulls it out and exchanges the spatula for the fork. Tony then carefully maneuvers the eggs into scrambling, making sure to get all the yolks broken up.
“Mm, alpha.” Tony’s head is tilted back, his eyes fluttered shut, mouth parted in a plea.
“Tony, it’s ok. I know you’re stressed. You always give so much of yourself to everyone. It’s what I like the most about you, but it’s also the most frustrating thing. Have you thought about taking time for yourself lately?”
and he looks down to see swollen bite marks and scratches. He’d thought that when he punched he felt weaker. Guess he was right. Though the serum has always taken care of his injuries more quickly than this before.
It’s a pain that wrenches his insides, pulls him forward in his reverie about Tony, into the cavernous insides of Steve’s true yearning.
“Rogers, we gathered everything related to the Tesseract. This does not mean that we’re—”
“Buh-bye mon Capitan!”
“So we’re just going to keep enabling him until he hurts Pepper? Or someone else? I thought you were better than that.” She stalks off at that, leaving Steve and Bucky looking at the closed door. Tony was growling now; he’d likely sensed the two Alphas on the other side.
it on you. You want to knot me? I’ll fight you every step of the way. You can beat me, starve me, ruin my finances, and even my company. But I will never give you the satisfaction of having me.” Tony’s eyes are glowing in the well-lit entryway, and they look even more backlit with the fervor Tony’s words. Steve can’t help but settle his gaze on the omega, even as he keeps his arms crossed and his body taut with tension. Tony is borderline feral, his lips curved into a sharp enough sneer to cut glass. God help him, but his body is responding to Tony’s threats, his cock stiffening in his pants. It’s taking so much of his thought process to not push Tony down to the floor, grab his neck in a vice grip, and pin him for the taking.
. Tony had been an
Time flies when you’re this close to freaking out, Tony thought when he heard the door handle rattle.
It’s just the way in which he gets to have him has completed something unfinished inside of him. The thing is, Tony doesn’t doubt that Steve will be accommodating to his other identity. He can feel it through the bond, how much Steve would love to have Tony every way he can. There isn't a way to lie through the bond. Tony had always known that, but the experience was a separate thing entirely. He didn't know what was going to happen at this point, but he was, for once, able to lay his paranoia at the feet of their relationship and hope that Steve didn't break him.
They're a mirror of each other, Tony thinks. Making tough calls, putting their life on the line for the world. But like Howard, Steve can’t see it in Tony, and he can’t blame Steve for that. There’s a darkness when he stares into their reflection, except he likes what he sees on Steve’s side and detests the selfishness on his end. Steve was born good; Tony learned the hard way.
“Next attack is predicted in Haiti, approximately three weeks from now.”
The very thought of damaging Tony has his heart staggering. He’s done all of this against what would be any reasonable person’s wishes. Yes, the evidence suggests that it’s the right decision, but Steve can’t help but think that maybe it wasn’t. That Tony was better off staying as an Alpha and figuring out his rut problems on his own.
“In the tower.”
Which is, of course, when he hears it. There’s a soft hum moving towards him at breakneck speeds. It becomes a whurr, and he tries to see above the crowd to what might be headed towards him.
“See, you keep lying Steve. Look at me.
“I don’t know what you’re referencing.” Tony gives him a sloppy smirk, as if he knows something Steve doesn’t.
“So how are we doing this. Because I do have a question—”
“I suppose I sinned in letting Tony get that sick. But—”
“Sorry, just—thinking about the past,” he offers, his words unsteady. The other man looks back up, wide eyes taking in Steve’s face.
“You picked Bucky. You
All of it, every touch and the push-pull of Bucky and Steve’s natures, breaks Tony.
“No, we don’t. What we need to do is look how amazing the chrome is on this and how pretty the lights make my profile look.” He admires himself in the mirror, the gleam of the armor sparkling wetly back at him. He’s stupidly beautiful.
As they lay together on the bed, Tony relishes the newfound closeness he has with his husband. These hands he’s holding have killed for him. He imagines he can feel the tremor of the lives taken with them on Steve’s skin.
Plodding down the stairs, he finds himself in front of two large glass pane doors, beyond which is Tony and an array of technology that’s dizzying to Steve to think about. The doors open for him, and he finds himself standing in the midst of what looks like schematics hovering in the air without being propped up or sitting on a screen. Tony is at the center of it, his hands waving as he expands and contracts parts of the picture to examine whatever it is he wants to look at.
“But mom, dad.” Tony grins as he manhandles the undershirt on. He almost mangles the pants until Pepper steadies him, and the undershirt gets buttoned incorrectly at first, which Pepper also fixes.
He wiggles under Steve, hips slip-sliding between the man’s thighs, and Steve’s eyes widen.
“And now?”
“I can’t.”
“That’s how it’s going to be then?” Steve smiles, and it’s like the sun rising, his blond lashes catching the light as his eyes crinkle in amusement. Now, Tony knows for certain that the Captain had never found him that funny before. No, Tony was totally annoying. That was the way the world worked.
“Really?”
It is remarkably beautiful, its hair a dark brown and its eyes a light gold that belongs in a sunset rather than set into an animal’s face. It shakes itself like a dog and stands tall in front of Rhodey, not thirty feet away.
His shoulder is steadily aching now from where the wolf is clamped down. The sting of it grounds him and helps him remember not to move. Tony finds that he’s losing himself in the rhythmic sensation of having his thighs fucked.
He is the furthest thing from a good boy. No, he fucked Bucky’s hand, took advantage of him, used him for pleasure, and then let the man walk away without returning the favor or otherwise clarifying what happened. This is his fault.
“You’re an idiot if you think I’d let him go once he’s mine. Making love isn’t the only way of caring for an omega. They need to be
He shakes her hand, stretching his out first, and then sits down at the table.
After what feels like ten, but was more like two minutes of ogling, Tony breaks the silence.
“Sorry buddy. Unless you’ve seen a 5’8” mouthy human brunet, you can scram.” He tries not to imagine this wolf gnawing on his friend, but it’s the thought of it that makes him feel irrationally angry, and he grabs another stick, tossing it at the wolf harder. It hits the wolf on his side, which causes it to whine sadly before it dips back into the bushes.
“Say it, Tony. I need to hear the words.” Steve glides his hands up Tony’s body, petting his neck where the mating glands sit, his face so terribly kind. It sends shivers through him that trail down his spine and coalesce at the base of it, a threatening storm of sensation that promises to overwhelm.
“We don’t know what’s normal with this. It could be better or worse for some people. Clint may be on the worse end. We just don’t know,” Bruce says.
“Then show me.” Steve turns around and marches out of the workshop, expecting Tony to follow. He hears the man’s footsteps behind him, and he breathes a sigh of relief that he doesn’t have to drag Tony up the stairs.
“Let me look at you, just let me see Tony, god you’re lovely.” Steve takes his hands and spreads Tony’s cheeks before shifting so his thickness is cradled in between the globes of Tony’s ass. He slides up and then down, catching the lip of Tony’s cunt before gently pressing in. He has to bring one leg up to the side of Tony’s lordosis position, aiming his cock downward into Tony, but he manages to seat himself once more.
It takes a step forward.
“It’s time to come clean, Steve. JARVIS, blackout.” It’s not that Steve doesn’t know he’s lying, but he had thought that his eagerness to see Tony better would muffle whatever signal Nat senses from him. She’s also likely fishing. She doesn’t, can’t know anything. He just has to pray that JARVIS truly isn’t listening, or he’s ruined.
“Lay on your front, please,” Steve says, soft. A spasm of heat moves through Tony at the request, and as he rolls himself into position, the warmth hits every joint and tendon before flaring through his chest. With his chest pressed to the cushions, he finally stills and waits.
“JARVIS, make the elevator as quick as possible.”
Steve growls and wrenches Tony away from Bucky, laying him back on the bed. Tony, who hasn’t had any agency throughout this entire encounter, grabs hold of Steve’s shoulders and whimpers out his compliance. It’s so hard to think with Steve pounding into him, stretching and pressing out every bit of feeling Tony has. Steve’s eyes bore into his, the blue of them clearly visible as he searches Tony’s face for something and seems to find it.
Because it was good. Clean sweat, vetiver like a summer’s day, and the woody scent of fresh pressed paper.
Tony melts.
“It’s just a few days,” Bucky says. But even he doesn’t seem to mean it.
“Then do it. That’s all I’ve got for you Captain.”
Clean clothes on, she hauls him up by his elbow, and drags him out the door. The fluorescent lights are brutal after the dimness of his room, and he blinks several times, trying to discern where they’re going.
“You’re twisted. He’s never going to forgive you. We will never forgive you. You are vile–” she says from over Rhodes’s shoulder, her face streaked with tears now.
“Alright.” He feels trepidation at the idea of showing off for Tony, but he goes to his room quickly, discarding clothes across the floor of his room as he reaches for the suit that he knows should be in his closet. When he pulls it out, he can see that it’s a deep navy, almost black, with a brighter navy button down for underneath, along with a vest. There’s a brown belt included, and he spots a new pair of brown loafers as well. There’s delicate stitching on the edges of the suit that gives it an interesting pattern, but otherwise is understated as the rest of it is.
“Uh, his first name is ‘Agent.’” Tony strides over, following Pepper. His party of two is not becoming a party of three. No matter Coulson’s claims. Unless Coulson has a new toy, in which case, maybe he’ll get to hang out with the cool kids.
“Fuck you.” Tony spits at him, a glob of saliva landing on Steve’s cheek. He drags it off with his fingers and licks them clean before diving for Tony’s mouth. His lips are heaven, pillowy, even in their narrow tightness. Tony can’t hide what a lovely darling he is from Steve, even when his sass is at its utmost level. Enraptured, he pulls back to look at Tony’s blown-out pupils and heaving chest. Fuck, his lover is beautiful, all velvety skin and fight.
“They’re working overtime right now,” Steve said. “Oh god, Tony. What you’ve done– what you’ve done is
“Sir, I’m going to have to ask you to exit the doughnut.” The man below him looked like he never outgrew his goth phase in high school. Despite the wardrobe, the man looked like the kind of person the government pays to do Very Bad Things. With the man’s one glaring eye, Tony can imagine a little drawer of identical eye patches, lined up with military precision.
“Sir has given you emergency access codes should a situation arise. Shall I activate those upon your reaching the workshop?”
It’s distant and thin, echoing down some as of yet unseen hallway. There’s shuffling outside, and as he lays prone on the bed trying to get his bearings, he hears thumping against the walls, as if they’re hollow and not insulated. There’s a radio playing, but he ignores it in favor of honing in on whatever is happening outside the room.
“Sorry about the state of things. We’re trying to get all these records digitized so they can go into storage. They should be down here today going through things. I think they were planning on doing something to be able to find people in the system, but the way we have it is by alphabetical order. You have the first last name?”
“Mr. Rogers. What can I help with today?” Dr. Nowak is polite. Too polite to mention the lack of Omega in his all-Omega care office. Steve doesn’t think he’s the first Alpha to come in like this, but he wants to navigate it carefully. Regardless of the legality of Steve’s impending behavior, there are a few states in which it’s undergoing examination for repeal. New York is one of them, but it hasn’t happened yet.
The Subaru handles the highways well, and he uses it as hard as he uses his sports cars, zipping between cars and hurtling forward at about 90 mph. The sun is out, but since his Subaru is new, there are barely any dust motes to dance in the rays. It’s sterile, lonely.
“I can’t say what I’ll think. It’s hard to imagine.”
“It wouldn’t be the helmet Tony—”
“Is Mr. Stark going to be on the helicarrier?” JARVIS picks up what the Captain says, and he slows down to reply affirmatively.
“Please don’t validate my idiot mutant child’s name. I’m working on keeping his self-esteem at acceptable levels.” He lets his mask bleed away as he flies up to meet Maria and they both settle down to the ground, for Steve’s sake, he presumes. He wonders how he can get the man in a shiny suit of his own.
“It’s ok, you know. To be Omega and a hero.” They’re sitting on the couches after Clint has gone to bed. Star Trek is playing on the TV and everyone else is otherwise occupied elsewhere or asleep. She tosses what remains of the popcorn into her mouth as she eyes him up.
“I got this,” the one beta says, standing up and holding out their hand. Steve takes it. “Hi, I’m Aisling, and I work with the Omega Support Network here at the New York branch. We’ve been scanning the old records in and using technology to make them searchable. I assume you have someone you know that you’d like to look up?” He shuffles from foot to foot, eyeing the omegas back, unsure.
“That’s the way, yeah, come on baby, show me how bad you want it.”
“I see. And have you asked God what you should do?”
“Cap, why can’t you just leave it alone? I don’t think we’ve ever had a conversation that doesn’t end in a fight, and I don’t see it changing any time soon.”
“Do I?” Bucky leans forward, planting his hands on the ground and looking like he’s going to stalk after Tony on all fours.
Oh well. At least he would get a chance to talk to Iron Man.
Minutes tick by as Steve locks into the machine, his mind seeking out Tony’s in order to sync with it, to take on some of the burden that the machine places on drifters and balance it between them.
Tony keens, the stretch and burn of it all he can focus on as it steadily presses into him, inch after inch pushing him wide open. He can feel his hips cant back, giving the other wolf room to work himself in, each aborted thrust taking him deeper. It feels better than human sex, like a high that Tony has never experienced and doesn’t want to come down from.
“And if he says no?” Steve locks eyes with Bucky, trying to suss out what his friend might be thinking. These pills are the key to what Tony needs. If Steve has to, he’ll go elsewhere. He knows that about himself now, that it’s become critical to help Tony even if Bucky isn’t involved. But having Bucky at his back would be preferable.
“Ugh, I’m old, I don’t want to.”
“Sir, it’s still at 20ms and a max out of tasks at three hundred thousand and change.”
“Captain. You’re looking well.”
“I cut down Tony’s clothing budget, which doesn’t seem to have done anything anyway. Tony always wears terrible clothing that’s unbecoming of an omega, but I’ve been compromising about it since he doesn’t understand. And I suppose what I’ve done to him is maybe restricting his activities too much? He could probably use a friend, I realize now.”
The Chitauri glide smoothly down on their soaring bikes, following the natural path of the streets, hitting cars with beams that pack such a punch, each vehicle flips and explodes with the blast. Tony wonders if they think the cars are weapons. Or if they don’t want the populace to escape. None of that matters as Tony watches bodies jostle in the cars that are the unwitting victims of the blast radius, people having been stuck staring at the blinding blue of the tesseract’s portal. Fear and sadness roil in his gut.
When they make it to the garage, Tony parks the car and freezes in the front seat.
“He’s got about twenty minutes. Stark, give me something.” Natasha looks at Tony, demand evident on her features. She isn’t going to take no for an answer. Tony balks and looks at Bruce.
His omega needs him, is crying for him, and he wants so badly to strip Tony and give him what he’s calling for right here and now.
He feels fevered, and for a moment, he’s back in the cave in Afghanistan. It washes over him, silencing his internal needs like pouring tar onto a machine.
“I don’t like being handed things.” The wrong scent from an Alpha on his skin could trigger a heat. It’s an uncommon, but documented side effect of long term suppressant use. He doesn’t shake hands either, though Omegas are never expected to for scenting reasons. Tony is very careful with what he touches.
“Yes. A thousand times, yes.”
Tony is agreeable, his teasing a choreographed dance meant to entice Steve into the chase. It doesn’t grate, or make him feel inadequate. The sly smile that lives perpetually in the corner of Tony’s dusky pink mouth is an invitation, not a challenge.
Iron Man appears in a burst of energy through the sky not long after.
“You are so—yeah, I want your cock down my throat. Suck me too?” And isn’t that the best image he’s had in a long time.
“Not at all.” The Father leads him out of the sacristy further into the church, where it opens up into a small courtyard.
“You and every other alpha. I know just the place.” When they pull up to a store that has big, shining letters that say ‘nest,’ Steve feels rather foolish.
Bucky grabs Tony’s shoulder and holds tight, fingers digging in.
“JARVIS, get those curtains. I don’t want to see daylight until this is over,” Tony mumbles.
Things have changed so much. He can’t believe she talks back to her alpha like that and it’s all a joke to them. He doesn’t know what to think of their relationship, although they seem happy, standing there together with her head leaned on her alpha’s shoulder. Is she what Natasha would define as a successful omega?
“Say it Tony.”
She finds it when Tony’s conversation partner slips away, and Sunset slots herself in place. He looks at her hands, so cruel, her nails the same red, the very same, that they were when she gripped his neck and made his world go black.
Steve knows, he knows he’s supposed to listen, but this is an overload of all his senses. He’s dumbstruck, afraid, lost. He wasn’t the only omega boy, but he was one of a few. Did his mother keep him away from the other omegas on purpose? Now that he thinks about it, he remembers Sarah steering him clear of sitting near them. They always stuck to their own pew if they could, sandwiched in by betas.
Steve sighs, his chest heaving. He’s such a fool.
It’s so good.
Tony groans, utterly ashamed of the idea of being just a hole to be used by Bucky, by Steve, by
Tony drags himself away from the gathering of his bots, meandering over toward the elevator. DUM-E and U don’t follow, don’t protest, and he’s sure JARVIS has something to do with that.
He stands there, silent and brooding, unsure of where to go, or what to do. If he sketches, he’ll draw Tony. If he runs, he’ll think of Tony. Nowhere is safe.
“You needed the best. I have the card for you by the way. I didn’t use it,” Steve admits.
“What? You want me to what? I thought this was only dinner.”
“Tell me you’re mine,” Tony continues.
“Tony! If you would just learn what I’m trying to teach you, we wouldn’t be in this situation!”
Tony cries, and it sounds so sweet from his lips, that Steve wants to chase it down, and he does so, moving back up to Tony’s mouth.
“This isn’t about personality profiles anymore.” Fuck that noise, it’s always about who is the most pliable tool while still having enough brains to make their own decisions in combat. He knew the initiative had been scrapped because there’d been no major threats that required cooperative superhero types to solve. Which meant that the first chance Fury got, he would revitalize the Avengers.
Next he rearranges himself over Tony, tucking the pillows around Tony’s body to comfort him. Tony takes the opportunity to hiss at him, reverting to hindbrain Omega coping mechanisms. It’s endearing. He’s going to reward his feral Omega.
“But I’m your alpha. Isn’t this where I should be?” Steve feels uncertainty creeping in.
“How do I do that? I don’t want to hurt you or make you uncomfortable.”
“I wanted to try apologizing again, if that’s ok?”
“I still think omegas should be cherished and protected, but I guess the way I do that has changed. I like to feed Tony, and I like that he’s… defiant. It looks good on him. I don’t touch him, I promise I won’t touch him anymore. I know he doesn’t really want me, like that.”
It’s amazing how he can feel simultaneously ostracised from and made small by his similarities to the man before him. A shadow image in a picture where he doesn’t quite belong. And it’s like Ty has always known that, the other man’s arm coming down over his shoulders in a gesture that would normally seem like protection, but Tony knows, he knows, it’s amusement. It’s pity.
“I think I’ve not been doing the best I can. I’ve let thoughts of what a proper omega means cloud my senses towards right and wrong. The things I’ve tried to impose on him… I can’t see doing it now, but I can’t unsee doing it.”
This is just–no, Steve’s not done anything wrong, he knows he hasn’t. But it feels like it. It feels like there’s a breeze block sitting atop his chest. He swallows, and his own spittle tastes foreign in his throat, like he’s been crying.
“I want us to talk. Like we always do.” Tony grins widely at the invitation and Steve waits calmly for Tony to launch into whatever sensuous and fascinating speech he has prepared.
Tony was going to annoy the ever living crap out of the embodiment of America.
“I don’t think—” But Steve hushes him, fingers curving around Tony’s mouth and pressing down on his jaw.
“Always.” Tony reaches up and grasps Bucky’s arm, thankful that Bucky is alive, is recovering, is able to be here for Steve and provide him a sense of completion that echoes memories from before the ice.
“You can wipe that dick-eating grin off your face, Fury. Fine.” He snatched up a bag and inhaled deeply. No. Not that one, and not that one.
“Never meant—” The shield comes down and the HUD is flickering, Friday warning him that he can’t beat Cap hand-to-hand.
“Ok, rules, I introduce myself and then you. You leave my side to get drinks, or unless I say I want to be alone. People are going to be vicious tonight. It’s been a month since my marriage and this is the first time they’re seeing me or my husband. As far as everyone knows we’ve been enjoying our time together.”
The kid goes without a word, and Tony is left with the finest specimen that mankind has ever known.
“Stark!” It grates, hearing Steve’s voice. He just wants to go, and get out of here, but he’s as trapped as if Rogers had cornered him.
“Yes, Father. But if you have any advice at all on how to get him to see that he should be the kind of omega people look up to, I’d appreciate it.”
But he listens anyway. He can’t help it.
“Yes, I knew those things.”
“Ok. I’ll think about this. Thank you, Father. I’m sorry for these and all my sins.” Steve then recites an Act of Contrition, not trusting his own words to define what he’s done.
. If Tony weren’t on birth control, he would, without a doubt, be pregnant from the sheer amount of come that’s being pumped into him from Steve. And he has yet to take another load from Bucky. He doesn’t know how it’s all going to
Tony watches as electricity hits a towering building, and he knows Thor is at the heart of it. He’s ridiculously grateful as he sees one of the whales light up like a discotech.
He rolls away from Steve, facing the man from his side of the bed.
So no more of that.
But it doesn’t seem to matter, as he watches his limbs thin out, his fingers retract up into stubby toes while his organs rearrange themselves. His bones don’t seem to break so much as shrink, which makes him think there’s some sort of magic involved, rather than biological process. He’s always hated magic, because it’s not real. This shouldn’t even be real.
It left him with a baseless, floating anger. He snapped at Steve for most of the day. Steve, who took it without comment, so wise to Tony’s ways that it made Tony want to rage for how
“Is everything all right?” Steve asks, so that Tony doesn’t ask him the same question.
And just like that, he comes, the image of Tony blissed-out underneath him staring back.
God, this needs to stop. He’s already hard in his pants once more, and he feels an overwhelming sense of humiliation. Tony does not want him. He’s made it abundantly clear.
“So that’s it then. You’re just going to go through the motions.”
“Mr. Rogers, if Mr. Stark is offering you a way out—” the lawyer starts.
Steve in the drift. Steve meets Tony’s eyes with a smile on his lips. The emotions and sureness that fills Tony at the sight, of Steve’s presence next to him, assure him that Steve isn’t going anywhere.
“And then Shawarma after.”
There’s nothing for it as Natasha turns on her heel and races after Steve.
“And how would you know that? You’re not SHIELD, or a soldier. What are you?” Cap comes forward, and for a moment Tony thinks they’ll pass each other by, that Rogers will move out of the way of Tony’s pacing. But he doesn’t, and Tony shuffles in front of Cap, the other man peering down at him, trying to parse Tony.
Steve has to get him to medical, but he doesn’t know who to call or where to go. His mind is running in circles until he realizes SHIELD were the ones who helped him with the contract. They would know what to do and would keep this private.
“I’ll sit down and wait.” Cap says. Tony walks over to his bar and snatches a bottle, which is sadly empty, before finding another and pouring himself a glass of… well, he thinks it’s whiskey.
“And Killian?”
“You know, sometimes I’m jealous. You reinvent the rules. You change paradigms. You answer to no one, not even death. So I’m a little surprised that I see you looking to make money as though that’s what power is.” Steve stays serene, collected. It’s always been a weakness of Stark’s to poke and prod. His former self couldn’t admit that he enjoyed it that much, but Steve is of a different kind; he adores it. He wants Tony’s attention.
But maybe?
“Fine, fine. Let’s do this.” Tony drops into his fighting stance, lamenting that he wore jeans meant to make his ass look good rather than maneuverability. It shouldn’t matter, though—Steve gets an unholy amount of glee in drilling the Avengers to fight in all sorts of clothing just to prove that they’re all able to defend themselves in any situation. Tony most of all, Steve had whispered in his ear one night, because Steve needs to be sure that Tony can hold his own with or without the Iron Man suit.
“Some of us here, we help through the heats, as best we can. We don’t have a knot, but it’s better than nothing. We don’t need alphas.” Trevor is glowering at him now, as if he’s specifically offensive to them.
Surely what’s best for Tony plays into this equation?
“Is it now?”
“I’m not making any excuses. All this time, you just humored me Tony. Do you know how that feels? To be heard but not listened to when it mattered? I feel like a fool, focusing on pushing you to take care of your heat, and it turns out, you were dying! So no, Tony, no, I can’t do this—”
“Steve. I have had a hard, lonely, miserable life, and the only thing that makes it worthwhile is wearing this suit. You can’t ask me to stop, Steve. No matter what.”
“Unprecedented?” Steve asks.
Pepper stood up then, hand to head, before walking away from Tony’s door.
“I had hoped we could be on the same page, Ms. Potts. Is there any way to convince you that I mean well for Tony?”
Tony’s eyes shoot open at some undetermined point in the night and he reflexively tosses his hand to his left, thinking to gently hit Steve’s warm body. But the bed is empty and cold.
“Our life is not a lie just because it started with circumstances that aren’t like anyone else’s.” It’s not. The things that Steve feels for Tony are real. They crawl through his veins, keep him up at night. He dreams of Tony, of their life together and how much he wants to love his Omega to pieces. Wants to take him apart and put him back together the way he deserves. It’s beyond instinct or lust. Steve considers being with Tony an act of worship.
“What?” He realizes he spoke his last thoughts out loud and ok, now he knows Rogers heard him. Probably even the first part of what he said to Bruce as well.
“You are the best, babe. But don’t touch my hair. I have some white wine leftover at my place if you want me to grab it?”
Nat stops and considers him.
“Will do, sir.” And it feels acidic in his mouth, down his throat, like he has heartburn just agreeing with the Director. Has he done something to shackle Tony? He thinks that maybe he should approach Tony and confront him about this, but then he remembers the tear-filled eyes that all but demanded he take indulgent care of the half-Omega. Tony couldn’t stand the idea that he was wanted only for his heats, and now that Steve had confessed he wanted Tony, it was like Tony would do anything to make sure it stayed that way.
“You’ll have to be a good boy, and wait for me. For now, you have to get back to work.” Bucky tears himself away then, and Tony can hear him panting behind him.
“I didn’t realize you thought about yourself as distinctly as that.”
Like a held breath, the hum of the reactor becomes overbearing, its whirring loud and almost a soft whine of power as it moves to overclock and release a mega-ton drop of energy. The world around them narrows; sweat clings to the inside of their helmets, the defoggers just barely removing enough moisture for them to see the glow of LEDs, the streams of data, and tiny beeping alarms that tell them they’re soon to be crushed if they don’t act soon.
“We can’t become paralyzed in our decision making when the call is not ours to make. You have to extend trust to him, that he knows what he’s doing. You give that fear, that unknowable element, over to him, as his partner, his lover.” He shudders, his body going molten thinking about being Tony’s lover and sliding down between those olive-toned thighs into a kind of heaven he’s only read about. But he’s not Tony’s. Though maybe if Tony wants him to be, he could.
“You’ve been drinking?”
“I ran into the wrong kind of alien, and I think it’s done something to me. Steve, I can’t get up.” Tony lets himself lower to the ground, chest pressing against the bare floor that he hopes is clean.
This had been their sanctum, Tony’s escape from the tower and SI and all of the responsibilities associated with being one of the richest and most successful people in the world. This is where Tony had first begun to feel safe around Steve, wrapped in alabaster sheets with tree trunk arms around his waist. The feeling of bedding down at night, Tony’s back to Steve’s chest, is so indescribable and innate to Tony’s person—Tony shudders, emotions flooding into his senses. The apartment smells like Steve and the rest of the Avengers, but this room… This room is
When the nuke hits, it smashes a large control ship, the one that he can see in the forefront. Behind it linger many more, but Tony suspects that only one ship has had their soldiers disembark, given the distance. The resulting explosion is enough to push him back, and he closes his eyes.
But all he’s done is ruin things.
“Alrighty. Let’s say I accept this offer. I mean, it sounds fun, ruling the world. What do you want from me? Why the hell do you even need me anyway?”
. Their place should smell like the both of them, scented together as an almost-bonded and married pair. Tony, in his secret moments, hopes that someday it could be as much as all that between them. According to Steve, Tony is worth it, and Tony is starting to believe that as best he can.
He wanted that; more than winning against Loki or saving the world.
Steve also bathed him while Tony had a small window of awareness before his heat came and sucked all of it away again.
“You don’t fear death Tony. Otherwise you wouldn’t put on the suit. But being so afraid of hurting someone you love that you can’t share your whole self, when you owe them more than secrets,” Pepper trailed off. “I can’t live with that. I love you so much Tony, but I have to keep my boundaries.” At some point he’d lowered his face mask, unconcerned with whether he was seen, and he scratched at his head now, dragging it down to run through his beard slowly, resigned.
a Chitauri. He’s so very proud.
Usually Tony doesn’t hang around in the communal Avengers showers. He’s got his own bathroom that’s leagues ahead of a simple stall with only one spray setting. But today he’s feeling a little down, like he wants to hide.
“Come on in, we’re celebrating.”
“Sir, may I suggest that this isn’t the best use of your time? Lay people do precisely ten things with their computer, and none of those are streaming ten copies of a HD movie at once.” JARVIS makes Steve smile. That sass is all Tony’s doing.
“I’m not a thing!”
They’re all beaming, and Tony’s breath catches as he sees Steve at the head of them, in full uniform, his ears peeking out from his helmet, his tail wagging just so.
When Steve gets back, Tony is still in his nest, tapping away at a Starkpad. The glow backlights his face in a soft shade of white and Steve is struck by his delicate features. The beard shines under the light, looking just this side of grizzled, though that’s a trick of the light.
He sits up fast.
Now he’s bored and has a Teen Abomination
“Look, you need to figure it out. You can’t change unless you know what it is you need to let go of. And your omega shouldn’t have to wait for you to do that to live his life on his terms. He deserves better than that. And while you may be my friend? He deserves better than you, and you know that.”
It’s an overreaction to call Sunset a rapist. He got it up, after all. But the nuances of consent had been lost on the older woman. Though he suspected she full well knew what she was doing and did it anyway. A late-night confession to Steve, whispered after they’d made love had his normally sweet omega grouchy and pacing. But it’d been months since he’d told Steve. Nonetheless, like magic, Steve materializes at his side, his biceps pressing at the seams of his suit coat as he crosses his arms, all but screaming that he’s on the defensive.
“Why?”
He’s almost finished, musing that this is the third time this particular cog has been busted in the arm—from whatever Bucky is doing that’s causing that—when the door opens again.
“Oh, I’m sure you’re the best of men. Got yourself an omega you’re trying to do right by? I can see their mark on your neck.” She points one gnarled finger at it.
“I don’t need you, but I want you. I always have. The other Captain America’s memories exist in my mind, he admired you. So do I. It’d be a crying shame to have to kill you rather than have you at my side.” He gets even closer, until he can see the pores on Tony’s face, the individual hairs of his beard slicked all one direction, immaculately groomed. Steve has always admired the fine length of Tony’s face, his diamond-cut jaw, the almost widow’s peak of his forehead. His dark mirror in every way that matters.
Soon enough, Fury stands in front of him, flanked by his flunkies, including Captain America, who must have slipped in out of nowhere, if that was even possible for the muscly hidebound man.
When the Captain is down to just his briefs, he palms the bulge of his cock, lightly gripping it as he watches Tony from underneath his lashes.
Tony’s words take him by surprise, and his body tenses with it, orgasming on just hearing that alone. All meaning is lost inside Tony then, and his mind ascends into a different plane. There’s just the perfect sensation of Tony around him, as though he’s pushed his soul inside of Tony for safekeeping.
“Aww babe, you look so good taking a cock. I’m going to love taking your ass right after, when it’s all wet and used for me. Steve thinks you’re this innocent thing, but we know better, don’t we?” Bucky’s lips are right at Tony’s ear, and as he whispers, Tony shudders at the tingling sensation.
“I can give you more, after. Come bathe with me.” Steve tries cajoling his omega. Tony peers out from beneath his lashes, brown eyes flashing with some unknown emotion.
The armor fell to pieces around him, and Tony had never felt more ready to be whole, to be complete.
He’s not eager to leave Tony unattended, but he thinks it will be fine for a few hours. He goes down to inform Tony, and only gets a cursory ‘yes, whatever,’ for his trouble.
“Thanks for the help, Natasha.” He hopes they’re on better terms after this, but he’s not going to force the issue.
“What experience!? You never married!” Tony is yelling now, arms waving erratically, but not at Steve. So Tony has some guise of self-control.
A low growl comes from behind him and Tony flips around instinctively, kicking out.
Steve wished Tony had thought better of himself at the time, that he didn’t have to sleep with anyone to be valued.
He gets to SHIELD in no time at all, and Maria is there waiting. She doesn’t seem any different than before, but she also doesn’t proceed to make small talk with him either. As he goes down the hallway, he spies Clint and waves his hand in greeting. The other man doesn’t wave back, doesn’t break stride, and his shoulder clips the side of Steve’s. Normally that would do nothing at all, but Steve is sensitive to his own strength, so he lets the hit land, relaxing his body so that he doesn’t hurt Clint.
“I can’t eat that much. I told you.” Tony glares at Steve now, the heat of which is belayed by the spittle that still rests at the corner of Tony’s mouth and how pale he looks.
“JARVIS, run scans!” Tony gets up and paces back and forth, looking at the ceiling.
“I will never respect you,” Tony adds in, his eyes narrowing as he lifts his chin in defiance.
at him, some quiet need on his face, something painful and sad twisted in the depths of his eyes.
But maybe he wasn’t those things. Perhaps he was exactly what Steve said. Steve, who couldn’t lie, or misrepresent the truth. Steve said he was good, and sweet. And Tony thought, well, he thought maybe Steve meant it.
before he starts to pull out from under the Captain’s grip, but the man has him solidly in his hands, and Tony
Then there’s the sight of the largest, most technologically advanced army he’s ever seen at the end of it all. Suspended in the sky, waiting.
Finally, it rings.
“Anyone in your life treating you nice, Tony?” Bucky whispers in his ear, the breath from his mouth moist and warm.
Steve’s hair is mussed, his lips a glossy red with spit and use, pupils blown wide. The blue is still there, the sun from the window sliding behind his eyes, making them look lit from within. Steve shrugs off his t-shirt then, and unbuckles his pants faster than Tony can register that it’s happening.
He’s gotten his Arc Reactor for the tower online, however. It’s party time for Pepper and him, which is so not how he used to get down, but these days he’s practically domesticated. So of course, Agent Coulson shows up to crash his party.
“It is.” He bites the words out at Steve, daring, testing.
“Mr. Perfect? My childhood crush and obsession? No.” And that was it, wasn’t it? When there were no good role models, when his father thought there was still the possibility he was Alpha or beta, Tony worshipped Captain America. And it didn’t stop when he presented. His fantasies changed, where Captain America would come back, talk to his father, meet Tony and then— well. He’d ask for Tony, bond, and bite him. Even when he had hooked up with Tiberius Stone, who had hurt Tony in that careless way of his, it was like the paint had scratched, and underneath was the Captain and Tony’s love for that ideal, waiting.
At least until he can’t take it anymore and stalks out of the room.
Steve now realizes that Tony doesn’t fit the normal mold of an omega, but he’s still not given up hope that he can alter some of Tony’s behavior so that he is at least acceptable.
A giant flying man whose muscles give the Captain a run for his money bursts into the Quinjet and snatches their prize. Tony, in a fit of pique after being smacked with a comically large hammer, goes after him. No one gets to just bully anyone they want. That’s not okay. He’s the only bully around here.
“Nat, I don’t think he’ll accept my help.”
“What’s wrong alpha? Don’t you want me?”
He zips off without waiting, assuming that the Cap ‘n crew are behind him. It’s not like Thor needs to hitch a ride. They can’t wait for Banner either, but Tony hopes he’ll show up in time.
God, Tony just wanted to lay on the table, lay his hands down flat and press his face to the cool surface, and forget his impending hangover. But the Omega was right there, in the way and blocking him from relief with her thin, tan arms.
“Then I’ll be there.”
“You’re a baby-faced, no-nothing soldier from Brooklyn when it was a shit-stain. You think you and your newly dropped balls are going to stop me doing what I can? Because see, I haven’t forgotten that you may technically be a grandpa, but project rebirth puts you at the terrible twos you overgrown toddler.”
Steve comes to stand in front of Tony, who is holding his body tense, glass clutched in hand as he sips from it.
“Yes, we’re clear.”
Steve grabs burgers for Tony’s last pill. He crushes the pill into the mayo and bags everything back up.
“Sir, Steve Rogers is correct. It would be nice to not have to lock you out of the workshop again.”
“It’s none of your business what’s under my suit and clothes Fury, but if you wanted it to be, you only had to ask nicely.” Tony leered, resorting to sexual tension. No, he didn’t think it would work, but it was funny to imagine Fury discomfited under that smug expression.
“You wouldn’t happen to have a tri-cyclic ten capacity transregulator, would you?” There are no small parts, just parts that aren’t nearly as important as other parts. A tri-cyclic ten capacity transregulator is one of those important parts that they cannot do without. Tony’s tried building one himself, but it’s not like he has a fabricator and endless supplies of cash. These suckers aren’t cheap either.
“Over bacon. I like it.” He repulsors a pig to the head, and it drops immediately. From there it takes less than two minutes for Iron Man to get each animal downed. What was the point of all of them coming out here again? Ah, yes. Team building.
“Are you ok Tony? Are you hurt? Did someone—”
“Let it go, Tony. Don’t let Extremis take it away.” Steve wants to see all of it. Every little bit of Tony should be his.
“Oh you big baby, you can dress yourself,” Rhodes says from his position at the bar.
“I’m sorry, I know that’s my fault.”
When did he stop wanting to try to get Tony to just conform?
None of those thoughts seem to matter though, as pleasure starts percolating in the base of his spine, and abruptly it zips up to blind and deafen him. He comes with a yell, and for a long stretch of time, it’s all he feels. Slowly he becomes aware of Steve cradling his face, Steve’s lips on his own, stealing Tony’s breath, and licking hard into Tony’s mouth.
No. Nope. That was not happening.
The world’s oldest profession, and Tony has become somewhat of a master at it.
“Do you really keep lubricant in the lab?” It’s endearing and convenient.
The elevator opens and Tony holds back a keen. It’s one or both of them, their footsteps solid on the concrete, and he doesn’t know which he wants to escape more. He scents the air, and both of their unique smells fill his nostrils.
The kind of necessity that made him enemy number one of SHIELD. Steve had slowly fallen into Tony’s orbit, from one clash to another, until Tony had settled inside the empty space of Steve’s life like he belonged there. With Tony, there was a future, a place where he was insulated from his cold and broken past.
Until he met Steve, and then the idea of security, guarantees, came tumbling down.
“As I said, I’m not the man you think I am, but everything he ever did, every memory, every moment, I carry it inside me. I know every thought he ever had about you. He loved you. Even when you fought.” Steve’s own heart pounds with the surge of battle, every muscle corded tightly in wait for assault. Just a little closer.
“Tony!” Steve’s voice sounds distant, almost tinny as the blood rushes through his head, roaring. His palms are flat to the floor, and he feels almost grounded as another ripple of arousal passes through him, almost painful in its intensity.
He rushes to get ready, tossing on a t-shirt and shorts, grabbing the bundle of pillows and blanket, and rushes over to Tony’s closed door.
“It’s stupid.” Steve has already won.
“Is that really what you need, Tony?” Steve looks tragically serious, his face pitying.
Tony slaps the last sheet of metal over the gears and gives Bucky a winsome smile. Bucky returns it and then reaches out to ruffle Tony’s hair with familiarity.
“That’s classified, but don’t worry, he’s been vetted.”
“Ok, I can be that for you. Lay it on me.”
The call to assemble is a relief to him. It’s the only thing that means anything at all anymore. Until he remembers that his team hates him. Except maybe Iron Man.
It turns out Hammer did completely deck out Rhodey’s suit in useless weapons, as if many unusable guns were better than none. It helps then that the armor can repel most of Rhodey’s shots.
of all people, set something off in his loins. He felt taut, a string ready to snap as soon as Steve stroked it just so.
Tony just nods, beyond speech.
He’s not a very good shot, and the branch lands somewhere off to the left of the wolf, which just looks at him instead of even considering that the branch could harm it. That is not good at all. He just knows that the wolf is thinking about eating him.
“Please Steve, I’m begging, want you, so perfect in me, need you—” He can feel the slush of cum inside him, his belly distended and biology designed to perfectly keep in an Alpha’s spend to ensure fertilization.
“Press it, and you’ll find out, Tony,” Steve says as he gets up off the couch, making to leave. He has to escape before he loses it. He’s far too close, his erection pushing hard against the seam of his sweatpants. He gently tucks the head under the waistband, trying to hide it.
“How do I make this easy for you?” He pulls Tony’s arms off his shoulders and wraps their hands together, offering Tony a point of balance to rise up on his knees. The tip of Steve’s cock brushes against Tony’s sack, soft and pliant, before Tony settles over Steve’s cock like he’s on a saddle. Steve lets his cock bend, nestling between the crevice of Tony’s legs, slick and the promise of heat teasing at his cockhead. Tony rubs experimentally a few times, before reaching his hand back and gripping Steve, making Steve gasp. The contact is like a small explosion going off in his body, and he drinks in the experience like wine, a starving man at a banquet of sensation.
“But you don’t smell like me.” It makes Steve nervous. He should have asked if he could scent Tony before they left. He’d all but forgotten it’s a thing he could do. It’s not like he didn’t know these things about omegas, it’s just that now that he’s come around to wanting Tony, all of it seems so new and fresh.
Steve is radiant above him, his arms pinning Tony back, triceps and pectorals in light-contrasted definition. Tony can swear his skin glows from within, the pale planes of it smooth and perfect.
“Yes, but I was wondering if I could just have a bit more of your time.”
At this point, he consciously knows the odds. Knows there’s no chance if it were anyone but Steve and they were anyone but them. But it is them. They’ve been through worse.
“Nah, man, I’m still gonna chew your ass out on the drive over.”
As Tony worked, the current reactor hummed and sizzled like a tiny hummingbird of hate.
“I gotta ask if you can just leave my face alone for the funeral.”
Steve grasps Tony by the hips, flips him around, and pushes the head of his cock against Tony’s hole, gasping as the muscles flutter under the pressure. Tony gives a breathy little growl, and the sound of it causes Steve to lose control completely. He thrusts forward, feeling Tony’s body give way and let him be seated at the root of him. Tony cries out, ecstatic, and Steve seizes the omega’s hips to pull his cock nearly all the way out before plunging it back in again. Steve grasps Tony’s hair and leans forward towards his neck, savaging his throat with kisses.
It may not be the best choice, because the second he darts to make a run for it, the wolf
“Is this about the Avengers? Which I know nothing about.” Half of his brain is Pepper. Coulson couldn’t reasonably expect he wouldn’t share the knowledge with her.
He spots an Andorian relaxing at the counter, the numerous tags hanging off his jacket, and the roughened hands giving Tony a clue that the man is an engineer or a dealer. Either way, jackpot.
“Fine.” Tony draws out the ‘i,’ griping. “You know, I was super delayed on Alpha development. Had to supplement hormones to jump start it.”
“Add a retractable garrote, and I’ll agree to let you run off and hide.”
Yet here he is, invading the small bubble of intimacy that this couple is sharing and he’s
Steve can’t imagine an alpha that would allow Clint to do this, much less encourage the smart mouth that Clint has. Unbelievable. If he didn’t think that Fury would come after him worse than before, he’d recommend that Clint be taken off the team. It feels impossible to reconcile as he steals glances at Clint, who is staring him down, that this man is a shoo-in for the Avengers Initiative.
“Omega. You’re so good. You’re so sweet and perfect.” Steve knows that Tony needs affirmation, and he sits up so he can rub at Tony’s arms and shoulders, certain that his omega will feel the warmth in his words and gestures.
How could they not find him?
He tries to sleep, but he can’t do that when he sees Tony’s tear-stained eyelashes flutter in his sleep and sees how closely guarded Tony keeps his body. As though someone might hurt him.
“I don’t. Need time,” Steve says, turning on the beam of light that is his winning smile onto Tony. The shiny white and shape of those teeth should be illegal in all 50 states of America.
He pops off and gives Tony a wicked grin.
“Thank god.” Tony leans over to rest his hands on his knees, out of breath, and still running high on adrenaline. His limbs quake with exertion, and he can feel his body shiver with exhaustion.
That is the first thing to go.
“Thanks, Tony.” It gives Tony a little boost of confidence—but only just—because as soon as Bucky turns around, he bristles like a dog. Steve responds in kind, their bodies tense and faces closed with anger. Bucky struts out like he owns the place while Steve stays on the couch, compact, with his hands clenched on his knees.
He pulls off and stares at the wet hardness before he refocuses on Tony’s face. The man is open-mouthed, breathless. Unfortunately, his face isn’t red with exertion and otherwise, there’s no sweat clinging to his brow, which is furrowed with concentration.
“I grew up sheltered. I never realized.”
How could he have been so irresponsible?
But it doesn’t really matter. Because in any other military field, the idea of two minds being so compatible that they lose pieces, chunks of themselves to the other person would be an immediate disqualification of service. Here, their so-called insanity is a treasure. The more compatible the team, the more tech-laden the suit. Lesser synced minds can’t handle the sensory load, but they can.
Maybe it’s too much to ask that they be friends. Steve has never considered until this very moment that they could ever be more to each other. It doesn’t make him regret his words about not giving Tony his knot. Not in the strictest sense. He just feels some sort of wistfulness about being closer to Tony, and mildly put out that Tony hadn’t even asked for a scented shirt of his.
“I don’t know Nat! I was hoping that you could tell me.”
that alpha cock in him.
He won’t. He won’t leave Tony like this, because underneath all of this, Tony has to be a good omega. There is an omega in there who can be obedient, tractable, beneath that facade. And as long as Tony abides by the rules of the contract, so will Steve. But if he has to break Tony to pieces to get to the perfect omega, he will.
It’s not that he thinks anything is wrong with Alpha-Alpha relationships, but there’s something off about them, together. Moments when Steve could smell the arousal on Tony, and himself, but they never quite tipped over that fathomless edge. The business of Alpha-Alpha partnerships is difficult, anyway. It’s bad form to assume that a worked up Alpha means they are attracted to another Alpha. Steve gets worked up sometimes too. Though he doesn’t know why he sometimes imagines Tony under him, pliant and sweet like an Omega.
“Mm, baby, do you need me again?”
“Conversation was invented to conceal reality. In case that was lost on you, we talk in order to lie. So I don’t want to hear it.”
Tony is a disappointment. He knows that. He won’t obey on the field even if he will kowtow here. Steve will come to resent him even more than he does now. Steve is the opposite of Tony in all ways. Introverted where Tony craves attention. Logical where Tony is abstract. A man who follows his heart, and not his head. And whereas Cap is rigid in his ideals, Tony sees a world without rules. How do two people who are so disparate, staring across a chasm, come together?
It wasn’t fair. It was never fair.
“Tony is everything. If I have to become the CEO of his company to protect him, I would do it in a heartbeat.” Steve doesn’t think it will come to that, but he doesn’t have to think about it to know the depths to which he would go to ensure Tony’s happiness. He’s come this far already.
Tony’s cock is a firm weight in his mouth, resting solidly on his tongue as he slides his mouth up and down. Tony is mumbling, his words indiscernible but for begging and Steve’s name, his jaw slack with pleasure. Tilting his head down, Tony’s eyes widen at the sight of Steve, and he lays a gentle hand on Steve’s head. Steve looks up at him, his brilliant omega, the one person who he’ll always regret hurting and will do anything to bridge that pained gap between them.
“Oh! Excellent. The team has already gone through the C section and should have digitized all those. Let’s go bother them and see what we can find.” The priest darts down another aisle of filing cabinets and leads him back to a room. He can hear laughter inside and as the door opens, he’s hit with the scents of a few omegas and maybe a beta. No alphas.
Tony shrugs the shoulder under Sam’s hand. “Anything that gets me closer to my prize is a win in my book.”
“Well, I can help with that. Father Jacobs, we can take it from here.” Father Jacobs pats him once on the arm and leaves, leaving Steve alone with these omegas who are examining him speculatively.
“Steve, mmph!” Tony is crying out Steve’s name when he descends on Tony’s lips, locking them in a sweet, soft, and sucking kiss. Steve laps at the entrance of Tony’s mouth, nibbles on his lower lip and tugs it down. Tony lets him, opening his mouth and letting his tongue graze Steve’s. Steve kisses him like he’s drowning and needs the air from Tony’s lungs to breathe. He swallows every tiny cry that’s jerked from Tony by the thrust of Steve’s hard length and leaves kind and doting kisses all over Tony’s face, dipping into Tony’s mouth as if to remind Tony that he’s not forgotten about its existence.
Tony hates him, and yet here is Steve thinking about what it would be like if Tony were shivering next to him, needing him. He is exceptionally beautiful, if Steve is cataloging that sort of thing. Nothing Tony has worn has diminished his lean lines, trim muscle, and a narrow waist with a pert bottom. He could encompass Tony’s hips with his large hands, meet his thumbs in the center of Tony’s back even as his fingers dig into the sides of Tony’s waist.
and Tony’s knees buckled under the weight of it, his chin already lifting so he could draw in more of the smell. Too late, he tucked his head back in, but Steve had seen.
“Oh, so you think it’s just my nature to be that aroused and that somehow makes me weaker?” Tony shoves his chin up and holds his posture with his legs spread wider, shoulders squared ahead.
“You’ll be making dinner tonight.” Tony is digging in the fridge, and he pulls out a smoothie that’s already pre-made for him.
“We won. And you’re Iron Man.”
It’s a clear Tuesday morning, the usual fog of the city unseen, and streaks of light dapple everything in the kitchen with a brightness that has Tony squinting. Grumbling, he throws on a pot of coffee and leans elbows first onto the island, chin in hands, trying to recapture some leftover threads of sleep.
“I’m so selfish Steve. You’re going to find that out. But just remember that you wanted this, before you knew anything else.” Steve gazes up at Tony, who looks inscrutable, distant. Steve just wants him to come back down to earth, to where Steve dwells, if only for a moment before he becomes the sun Steve orbits once again.
-----
Things settle in, in that they don’t settle in at all. It's their allowed honeymoon period where normally they’d consummate their marriage, but instead, Steve has been using it to slowly ease Tony into a routine. Steve thought he had his work cut out for him, but he had no idea how bad it was.
“All those things Tony, they don’t matter. Not anymore. You’re good as you are. I was wrong. I was so wrong. You’re a sweet little thing, look at you, so perfect for me. I love you.” But Tony doesn’t stop crying, and the gut wrenching sounds coming out of him are alarming to Steve’s ears. Steve tries. He frantically tries to comfort Tony and bring the omega around with more endearments, but Tony only seems to cry harder as Steve caresses his face and shoulders.
It really doesn’t take long. He tries, oh god he tries to not orgasm in less than a minute, but he’s imagining a warm, pliant Tony underneath him, the omega’s fingers rigidly clutching at his shoulders, head thrown back as Steve spreads his legs wide and thrusts roughly into him. The Tony in his head likes it, begs for Steve, for his alpha, claws at Steve’s chest as he makes needy little moans. And like that, on the coattails of the image of their conjoined bodies, he comes.
“We’ll talk tomorrow, sweetheart.” Steve reaches over and cups Tony’s trembling cheek before slipping into the covers next to him. Tony lets Steve wrap himself around him, arms enclosing Tony in safety. Their love hangs about them, as still as crystal and as fragile. It rains on them ever so softly, but it floods the river between them. Tony despairs that someday he’ll be overwhelmed with all of it, and he’ll fracture or drown. Needing something to survive that could also kill you is just his way of things. He doesn’t know how to stand close to fire without touching it. He doesn’t know how to have Steve without being consumed by him.
That was all it took for Steve. The man launched himself at Tony, knees hitting the ground hard before he snatched a fistful of Tony’s hair and pulled him in for a bruising kiss.
An Omega.
He’s furious as he walks upstairs to clean up after breakfast. It’s an anger that lingers, and he accidentally crushes a plate in his grip. After that he paces, not sure where to go or what to do.
.” The last word is hissed.
The wolf whines then, before dipping its head to sniff the ground and looking up again. It takes a step forward, then two, before it starts ambling slowly towards Rhodey.
“I just– I just wanted to know.” He twists his fingers with his other hand before dropping them, and gazing back at his friend. There is nothing wrong. He’s not done anything, and he’s not going to do anything. He just wants to know.
“You should have already started the process, but the serum seems to be fighting it off. It remains to be seen if you’ll actually heal though? So, I’d say if you cooperate, and let us draw blood without leaving, we’ll let you out when we find antibodies. But I mean, you are much more likely to die, so.”
Tony wishes he could claim he’s never been dense, but it took him a long time to figure this one out.
It doesn’t matter what manifestation that takes, though Tony thinks he knows where he’ll go if he can’t physically find Steve anymore. It doesn’t scare him as much as it should.
“Just my two cents, Cap.” Iron Man turns on his repulsors and soars off without answering any more of his questions.
“True. You kicked ass back there by the way.”
“P–please, can’t–can’t breathe! I’m leaking, and it’s so warm, Steve!” Tears are trickling down the sides of Tony’s face as Steve leans down and wipes them away.
Nonetheless, Fury sends his suppressants and hasn’t reached out to Tony regarding the count down to his necessary heat. Which leaves Tony in a lurch, wondering when SHIELD is going to try and call in a favor. Tony thinks it’s going to be weapons, and he’s stuck in a moral quandary about whether he should provide tech that kills other people, or die himself. As an objectivist, the answer seems clear initially; one man isn’t worth the many. But, as a consequentialist, the loss of Tony in the world, making tech that saves people, could be more detrimental to the overall body count.
After settling in, he plots a course for home. Or whatever is left of it without Steve.
Bucky remained silent, but kept trying to make eye contact with Steve. Steve, in his embarrassment for the previous week’s conversation, avoided meeting Bucky’s eyes. But he can see that Bucky is riled, unhappy about Pepper’s treatment.
“Wait, what are you—stop.” He puts his arms up against Steve’s chest, and Steve smashes them to the ground above Tony’s head, both wrists held in one large hand. Steve continues his ministrations, pulling stubborn panel after stubborn panel, flaying the armor from his flesh. He can’t help it, he wriggles, uncomfortable, between Steve’s thighs, and Steve responds by letting his hands go and flipping him over.
“Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you. And fuck you.” Steve breathes through his nose, and counts to ten, praying for patience.
“What’s uncomfortable right now is that my gland is aching and I want to know what you’re packing so when I do go into heat, I know what I’m going to get. Indulge me.”
Tony smiles coquettishly over the top of the bun as he takes his first bite.
“Do I need to? I’ve seen the company you keep.”
But he’s fought impossible odds before, and he’s not going down without a fight.
Again, Tony longs to be Iron Man in truth.
“You want mercy baby? I think you need to look elsewhere, because I am going to
His body is trembling, his hands shaking as he clings to Steve.
“I would make the world for you, Tony. I saw what they took from you, and I took it back.” The earnest light in Steve’s sunrise-blue eyes wraps around him, heavy and indolent. They each move in tandem, Steve swinging his body around the island and Tony meeting him as his chair scrapes at the ground. They don’t clash so much as seal together like the reverse of a flower’s blooming, the petals of their bodies slotting so perfectly into alignment.
The ride back is quick this time, and at least Barton isn’t staring him down like he had before. No, he’s just pretending that Steve isn’t there. Steve thinks that maybe he owes Barton an apology somewhere, but for what?
“That one is our vegan suede, very popular when it’s cold out.” So maybe not that one, since it’s summer.
He’d been hiding ever since.
“I make sure that Tony comes up for regular meals, otherwise he would stay in the shop all day,” Steve says.
There’s nothing more important than the team itself, even and including over the individuals that comprise it.
Steve knows that in his heart it’s not Tony’s fault. It’s Steve’s weakness. But he’s so angry at Tony. Every time he tries anything, Tony ruins it by opening his mouth. He feels defeat as it begins to settle into his very bones, his marrow. It tastes sour and rancid. He’s not supposed to be weak.
“We are. The model’s locked and we’re sweeping for the signature now. When we get a hit we’ll have the location within a half a mile.” Banner did at least take the time to make sure that if they were going to confront Fury, the man couldn’t have any complaints about their not doing what they said they would.
It’s the thought of Tony squirming in his bed, crying for a knot, that turns him aggressive as he circles around the Omega.
He makes it through a few of her unconsciously tossed barbs and what amounts for small talk with a solidity he doesn’t feel. His core is shaking, disassembling, and cracking with every smile he gives her. It melts inside him like soft wax, and he can feel his insides losing their shape. He’s becoming formless. Fear doesn’t know its own shape, because it lives in darkness. He can only feel the walls of his anxiety as they clench down on him and press, slippery on his carefully architected facade.
yourself. This is a different era we live in. We know more now about omega dynamics than we ever have before. We know what makes them happy and content, and it’s not this Captain. It’s not fucking this.”
“Of course I said no.” He freezes at that, wanting to hope that he’s heard right. After a moment, he speaks, his tone soft.
“Hey, I resent that. I’ve come to realize that I have more to offer this world than just making things that blow up. But if Stern wants to be a weapons-grade moron and try to take my suit from me, I’ll let my dumpster fire of a personality take care of it.” Tony examined the grease on his nails, musing that he’d have to actually clean up for this one. People wore makeup, so why couldn’t Tony use iron tannins as eye shadow? Though truth be told, he was going to infuriate the Congressional Panel by dressing more to alpha standard than omega. Suit and tie all day ‘er day.
This time, when he feels the heat of the other wolf’s cock, the arousal is so strong that he hears himself whimper with need. The other wolf mounts him, legs pinning his own, and presses the tip of his cock into Tony. For whatever reason, he feels slick and open back there, and the cock catches on his rim before sliding oh so carefully in.
his fellow man with all their idiosyncrasies and weirdness that he’d take every day over having to step into a thousand different cultures, some of which demanded death or limbs as a penalty for a misstep.
Wall to wall glass. Did they really think that would keep him locked in?
at him. It pulls out all of the suffering that throbs inside him, that he lashed Tony with. And there’s this moment, this little prickle of awareness, as he’s entwined with Tony through their mutual gaze, that he can no longer bear it. Tony is gutting him with those brown eyes, scooping out his tender insides with them, and Steve cannot, cannot stop him.
“I soaked the bed with Ty. Every cut he ever gave you, I returned it tenfold.” Tony is drowning in it, he is sinking and never rising. He is evermore happy inside the glutted womb of their love, until Steve asks him to be reborn into the light.
Steve’s hips are snapping against Tony’s as he grinds his cock down onto Tony’s ample ass. He can’t wait to pull Tony’s pants off, have that gorgeous mound of flesh exposed to his ministrations. He’s going to lick every inch of Tony he gets his hands on, see if his slick tastes as good as his gland. It’s probably better than.
“Well, yes, I was trying to get him to cook by having him cook all the meals. But he’s a terrible cook, so he just wasn’t eating. But I don’t know how to balance getting him to behave with his health! Am I supposed to just let him eat out every night?”
“—If you’ll sign here, agreeing that Arcelon owns the data—”
“You’re supposed to be locating the Tesseract.” Emphasis on the word supposed.
“Oh Tony, we talked about this.” She intones in a low register.
When he looks up, however, he sees more fighters on the way towards Legolas, and he figures he should give the guy a hand. He takes off, smashing and roaring into Chitauri soldiers, knocking them off the building.
“I swore I would never be one of those bendy fuckers. Ever. No, there’s got to be a way around this!”
“Don’t. Just don’t Steve. Do not go there. I said you can’t take anything I said during heat seriously. Are you going to renege because you don’t like the consequences?”
“Fuck.” He lays down on the mattress and waits, holding his body still and trying to catalog every little thing that might be different. His ass is still leaking lube, and his cheeks squelch together uncomfortably. He’s still a little horny, to be honest. That’s not weird. Or it shouldn’t be.
“Good, because we’re leaving him with you to monitor the situation, given that your actions lately have been more than questionable. However, we’re still taking the Teen Abomination into custody.”
“Which is why it’s so weird they didn’t pull me into work on the Tesseract in the first place. You gotta ask yourself what’s the reason if they knew they needed lots of energy, which I have.” Tony’s had enough of being dismissed.
“Yes, I’ll take anything, anything at all,
Slowly, he uncoils himself and pads over to the numberlocked panel.
It’s not winding down just yet, but they’re at a steady clip of removing the bots when he feels a sharp pain in his shoulder that’s deep. He cranes his neck around to see an arrow sticking out of his back.
“I showed him that I was the best option for him. If I wasn’t, would I bear his mark?” Steve knows this is the truth. Tony is written into his skin, his scent, his very bones. He knows they can all smell it, the veracity of it.
-----
The air is frigid around him. He estimates he has maybe thirty minutes before something he’d miss freezes up. He has to get up. Pulling the legs off, he leaves the base on to protect his feet. It’s enough, though he feels like he’s clanking about.
Tony is the only thing that makes him feel useful and alive. And these days, it’s that or suicide.
Tony turns when the door opens, and gets up automatically, going for the bowl and plate of food that Steve has brought.
“No Steve, I just fucked up a little. I need someone to walk me to a clinic, make sure nothing happens in the meantime.”
. He wants Steve to wrap around him, assuage the embers of him before he scorches. Is it possible to get close enough? Tony would try.
“Steve,” he breathes out and props himself up. Steve walks into the nest and kneels down in front of Tony.
“I guess I’m almost done. Stick around?” Steve doesn’t answer, but he takes a perched seat on the couch, leg bouncing with agitation. Tony watches out of the corner of his eye as Steve tries desperately to distract himself by pulling fuzzies off the fabric and flicking them from his fingers to the floor.
“It’s great to meet you Mr. Stark, I was friends with your father.” And just like that Tony is shocked out of his daydream. Of course Captain America thought he was a replacement Howard. Maybe even the love affair his father had with Captain America was reciprocated. How gauche.
“Oh, ok.” Steve gets up and follows Natasha out the door. They don’t run into anyone at all, and for that Steve is grateful. They climb into a SHIELD issued Cadillac and Natasha takes to the streets, dipping and winding through traffic as though she drives every day. New York isn’t normally a place for cars. Steve certainly had never driven one until he got into the army.
“Oh no. I’m not playing this game. Not anymore. Leave me out of it!” Tony stares defiantly at Bucky, daring him to do something. Anything.
“I’m here for you on behalf of the Church and Christ. I have to say I never expected to hear from you.”
“Tony, Tony man, you gotta wake up.” His mate is laid out on Steve’s, their, bed, his lean arms tucked over the blankets as he lays prone. Tony is beautiful at all times, but it’s especially intimate when Steve sees him asleep. It’s part of why Steve has gotten barely two hours in the time since he bit Tony.
“What is it?” She sounded mostly normal, but Steve couldn’t honestly tell.
Steve’s knot begins to loosen, and with it, Steve’s face crinkles with agitation. Tony knows that Steve wants to stay; stay in him, stay with him. His cock is so perfect nestled inside Tony. He never wants this to end.
Steve wants more.
Honestly, he was surprised they got it all in here on time for the event. Seeing the same old routine of decor and dresses made Tony feel like somewhere, someplace, Loki had never happened.
It goes on and on, neverending but for Steve’s grunts and his merciless assault. Despite the pain, what comforts him is Steve’s fingertips ground into his hips, the v of his groin smashing against his bare flesh, and Steve’s breath near his shoulder. He can almost imagine that he’s in bed, in the tower, and Steve is his lover. It makes him float above the pain.
Somewhere in his head, he remembers that this is a dry heat, with no possibility of pregnancy. It had been like that with Yinsen. Though it had never been this breathtakingly amazing as it had with the beta male who had tried his hardest to be what Tony needed. This was where he belonged, pinioned on his alpha’s cock. He knew that in his very soul.
He dresses as quick as he can and makes his way to the rendezvous point. There are mutated animals running about; large pigs that have escaped from a research facility where they’ve been growing them larger than grizzly bears. Which, why pigs? They’re clever animals capable of escaping their pen, and it seems with the increase in size, they’ve become even more intelligent.
“I won’t lie to you. But I’m not able to talk about it either.” Steve is ensconced on the couch, a pencil and sketch book in hand. He’s been drawing a rather obscene image of a nude Tony laying on Steve’s bed, legs tucked up to his chest. Some parts of it he has to leave to his imagination, but so very soon he’ll know Tony in entirety. He can hardly wait.
“And say the rosary five times. But spread it out throughout the day, for when you need a bit of strength.”
“If you had come up at the proper time, instead of making me come to get you, I would have made you lunch. Now you can make it yourself.”
“Tomorrow? Is there anything I should wear?”
“Fucking thank you.” Steve sighs. They’re not going to get through this easily. But the first night will always be the hardest. That Steve knows. He’s never watched horses be broken to a bit before, but he figures this is much the same. You have to show that you’re in control, confident, and that the results will be what you want them to be if you just stay consistent and calm.
“I need ten hours of uninterrupted lab time today,” Tony blurts as he watches the cheese melt on top of the eggs.
“Next time I’ll leave off and have you deal with him. You’ve already dealt with me so well.” And isn’t that true? Tony has taken all Steve tried to put on him and tossed it back in his face. His omega is even better at defending himself than Steve is. Maybe that’s what omegas were supposed to be. Defenders of the home, the nest, as fierce as any alpha. Any alpha would have to earn the right to mate with such an omega, and Steve knows he hasn’t. He’s going to get to be with Tony for his heat, and he knows it’s not going to be enough for him. Steve is going to want more.
“Fine. You’re sorry. You’re always sorry, you know that? It’s just for once I’d like to be in a situation where you don’t have to apologize and instead do the right thing. Is it too much to ask?”
“So good for me. You’re taking my knot so well. I’m proud of you. I’ll take care of you Tony. I’ll always take care of you.” Once Steve starts whispering these endearments, he can’t stop. Tony hitches a sob and Steve’s mind blanks with concern, rising up to clutch at Tony.
His omega has never been with another alpha in the way he’s with Steve right now. Tony is
“You’re sure he’ll come to me? Why would he ever do that?” Hope blooms in Steve’s chest. He might be able to make it up to Tony, to be with him as his husband. But then he remembers Conall and how the man used spanking as a tool to get his omega in a state. How is that any different than using Tony’s heat to coerce him to be with Steve? He has to say no. Everything in him shrieks in protest at the idea, but he has to say no.
“Wait, he’s refusing treatment?”
Steve never felt like he was longing for sex when he was an omega. Mostly he spent time thinking about how good it would feel to just
“Come join me in the nest. I’m going to sleep here tonight and the next, until the heat comes. I’ve been running cold the past few days and it’d be nice to feel warm again.”
“Steve,” he says, and then comes untouched, knot swelling between them. Steve grunts and follows after, the fluttering of his cock as he empties himself into Tony a counterpoint to the tender stroking of Tony’s face that Steve is engaged in.
“But I need him. You don’t understand! He’s everything now. And all those things I did to him, they don’t change how much he’s under my skin and in everything I do and think!”
“Don’t do what? Throw something that could be good away? You did that already. This is what’s left. And I don’t need you constantly around me to remind me of what we never had.” Tony gestures at them as if Steve can see the lingering smear of cruelty that Steve has put into their relationship.
“Especially then.” It dawns on Tony that Steve is here for the long haul. That he means it.
“Kneel. Show me how sorry you are with your mouth.” Tony reaches up to caress the side of Steve’s jaw, fingers trailing over the edge to rest on his lips, one forefinger sliding between them to break the seam of saliva and enter the parted flesh. Steve feels every glance of Tony’s skin on his, the slow drag of his fingers over stubble and the soft wetness of his own mouth tasting the flavor of Tony’s skin.
“He’s got nothing I haven’t seen, Rogers.” Rhodes barrels past him into Steve’s nondescript room. Tony is nude under the covers, eyes flickering as he goes through REM. When Rhodes lays a kind hand on Tony’s bare shoulder, Steve feels a glint of jealousy. He drives it down, knowing that no matter what, his claim is secure over Tony. He’s the only Alpha that will ever fuck Tony.
He thinks the man’s suit needs a complete makeover though, maybe from the guys on Queer Eye, who would likely be rendered insensate by lust. Because even in those basic bitch colors, Captain America is all Alpha. Tony wondered how much dye went into making his leather utility belt blue and why they used a seat belt buckle. What a waste. Didn’t the Captain study American history where we shot at Brits who wore garish uniforms like fish in a barrel? Well, it still didn’t stop him from wanting to run his hands over Cap’s abs to see if they felt like the topography of a map.
“Let me handle this, Maria.” Rogers put a hand on her shoulder, tilting his head in askance. “I think we can all agree that my presence should smooth things over. I can watch the boy from here, and deal with Stark.”
“Yeah, yeah, make sure the haul gets distributed.” Nat nods and strides out with purpose now, packing up all the emotion she had just let out when Tony’s fate was uncertain.
“But I want to be maudlin.”
“We’ve stumbled on it now. Why is Tony not capable of taking care of himself?”
“Omegas are people! We’re living, breathing, feeling people who get to live our lives how we choose! I don’t need or want a leash, but I’m stuck with you. Why would you put us through this? I can’t be what you want me to be.” Tony holds his arms out in askance, his face taking on a begging quality that gives Steve a shiver, just thinking about Tony submitting to him. It feels like it should feel wrong, and Steve shoves the emotion away, not wanting to examine it or give it credence at all. Alphas have instincts, that’s all it is.
He settles for harsh words.
“Steve— Alpha, please, yes, ready, ready, so ready.” Tony mumbles his consent, his mind in torpor while his skin sings for Steve’s touch. Steve lays a steadying hand on his ass, thumb spreading his already wide-open hole, before dipping the head of his cock into Tony’s ass, clipping the rim with the ridge of his cock.
“And in no world could you have taken the pills yourself?” Nat’s one eyebrow has gone up as it does when she thinks that someone is being foolish. Steve has considered being an Omega, for at least a moment. But ultimately he isn’t the one with the problem.
“No, both of you stay out of it. His argument is with me.” Both Clint and Thor stand down, Thor muttering about honor and battle.
His knees give way, flattening his body to the ground while Steve practices the art of becoming; becoming Tony. Hot fingers trace along his gland, seeking. It’s always tentative, Steve looking for something in particular that he only seems to find when he’s close to losing himself in Tony.
“Well, anyway, I have to get back to work. Do you need any help finding your way up?”
Tony pulls the needles out after he’s given a couple of pints, which would make a normal man dizzy, but only moderately inconveniences him. Clint is now breathing normally, and his wounds have puffed up as Steve’s did. Bruce takes a sample of Clint’s blood and finds that Steve’s antibodies are going to work on the virus inside of Clint. He just needs time and rest.
“Promise, anything you want Pep. Ah, well, not anything, but close?”
The day passes uneventfully, Steve leaving him in a good mood for the rest of work. They go to bed at a decent time, and Tony presses a tender kiss to Steve’s temple, delighting in the sharp hairs there that tickle his lips. Steve seeks out Tony’s mouth and latches on with an off-center kiss. It’s imperfect, and its imperfection is a comfort. If Steve were good at everything one hundred percent of the time, Tony would be in trouble.
“Three. Thank you.” Tony hastens to add. Steve smacks again, hard, and Tony whimpers softly.
“Fine, yeah.” Tony feels off-balance with Cap just
Soon Tony has Steve’s pants removed as well, and they both spend time breathing in the musk and sweat of one another. It’s Tony’s scent that contains traces of metal, like hot steel and solder. Tony moves first, leg hitching up and over Steve’s hips while taking Steve into his mouth in one long gulp, his cock bypassing a non-existent gag reflex as the head constricts in Tony’s throat.
“I’m currently courting an Omega, and I wanted to establish care with a clinic.” Dr. Nowak is good. So good, that it had taken months to get an appointment at the clinic in the first place. He has a follow-up two weeks from now, when he’ll have Tony with him.
