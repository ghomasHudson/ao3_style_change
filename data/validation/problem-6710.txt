Thor shakes his head, then turns to meet Tony’s eyes. His expression is weighted, and unbearably sad. “I wish I could say that my brother simply is seeking companionship after many years spent in isolation with his hatred, but in truth I do not know. I thought perhaps he might have said something to you, or you might have some knowledge of what he intends-”
Still, he doesn’t want to be left at the Triskelion. He wants to go back to the tower with Tony. So he gingerly pushes his body into the metal, slipping through the wall of the helicopter and climbing up into the seat next to him. Tony’s got his forehead pressed to the glass, his breath fogging the window. His expression is bleak as Steve’s ever saw it.
“Okay,” he breathed, and it felt like giving up. Bruce was asking him to trust Tony to save himself, like Tony had always had to. He’d saved himself from death, from the cave, from Stane and The Mandarin and The Ten Rings. Steve did not want him to have to save himself again, but he could hear it in Bruce’s voice, now. Bruce did not expect them to catch these men today, if they were good enough to avoid JARVIS’ all-seeing eye. Instead, he was trusting Tony. He was asking Steve to trust Tony, as though there was anyone else alive Steve trusted as well in the whole world. “Okay.”
Sen is sitting on a train on her way to see the witch’s twin when Maria Hill walks into the common room. She looks tired, and she sits down silently across from Steve in one of the armchairs, folding one knee over the other. She’s dressed in her usual business clothes, but when she says nothing Steve turns his attention back to the television. It’s a beautiful movie, and he doesn’t want to miss a trick. They sit in silence while the movie plays on, not quite comfortable but not awkward either. Steve’s never been very close to Hill, and she makes him vaguely uncomfortable in the way that all beautiful, competent women do. He’s not sure he’s ever been alone in a room with her for this long.
“You’ll have these,” Bruce said. He turned to meet Steve’s eye, nodding seriously at him. He held one of the masks up for demonstration. “Tony and I have been working on these for a while. The gel creates a hermetic seal around the face. They’re also equipped with both night and heat vision, which you can toggle on the side. Once you peel off the plastic film and put them on, you won’t be able to remove them without the detaching agent unless you’re willing to tear your skin. Make sure you’ve got them placed where you want them before you attach them. Even with these on, minimal or no contact is still the best plan unless you all want to go through a decontamination shower before you enter the tower, so call me as soon as you’ve got him.”
Tony’s stepping back out into the garage before Steve can grab him, his heart pounding double time in his chest. Steve won’t follow him, he knows; there had been an incredibly noticeable wet spot on the front of his slacks, and there’s no way he’s going to walk out into the throng of SI employees with a fresh jizz stain in his crotch.
"That's what you meant, when you said 'Well played.'" Steve snorts, despite himself. "He's always been too smart."
“Be easier if I didn’t own so much Captain America junk, huh?” Tony says, finally. The joke is weak, but it breaks the tension in the room, and Tony reaches out and takes the shirt from Beth’s shaking hands. Then he pulls it on over his wet hair, pushes his arms into the sleeves. He smooths the fabric down over his belly.
Tony grins, feral, and clenches his hands hard on Steve’s arse as he presses the tip of his ligula into Steve’s tight, trembling asshole. The sound that Steve makes is a little loud, and Tony pulls his head away with a cruel kind of laugh. He dips down and bites Steve’s bared throat, then keeps on going: pushing, slow and inexorable, the ridges on the underside catching against the tight rim and leaving Steve shaking in his arms.
Eventually, Steve padded out onto the cold December air himself, clutching two cups of coffee. Tony didn’t even seem to notice how cold it was, and Steve draped the blanket he’d pulled off of the couch over his shoulders, handing him his cup silently. Below them, New York stretched out in glittering spires, pink and lavender stealing over the skyline in bright swathes as the sun sank in the sky.
“What? What are you jokers gonna do, try to shoot them? You don’t even know where they went. Just sit back and let the Avengers handle this. You’ve got fifty odd supervillains traipsing around, doing god knows what. Focus on rounding up the ones you can handle, and we’ll take care of the rest.”
“Somebody’s gotta do it,” Natasha says, sliding smoothly off the worktop. “Stark’s right, I’m starved. Who wants lunch?”
“Are you going to sit?” she asks, waving to the chairs before her. In answer, Steve holds up the flowers. “I’ll have Ms. Bliss find a vase.”
"It's like putting a giraffe into a box," Tony mutters, staring at him. Steve scoffs and shuts the car door. "Flying cars are overrated, baby. The new America is all about hover boards and AI."
“No,” Steve says, aggravated. He’s still kind of angry, but he isn’t sure why. The links from JARVIS had been incredibly helpful when it came to the latter part of the so-called “advice” Pepper had meant to impart on him. But it was the original conversation that he couldn’t stop coming back to. “She’s unfailingly loyal to the people she loves. She’s a good person. Or, I thought she was.”
“Sir, yessir,” Tony drawls. Steve sighs, steps out. The door slips closed. “JARVIS, you’ll tell us when he’s gone, yeah?”
“Real surprising,” Rogers said, and Tony sighed. He’d botched this up so poorly. Rogers deserved better.
A loud cough cuts him off, and he whirls on Bruce with an honest-to-god snarl curling his lip. He only barely restrains the sound that wants to bubble up with it.
“Hah,” Steve mutters. He rubs a hand through his hair, watching where Tony’s fallen asleep against his worktop, his head pillowed on his folded arms.
Only Steve knows how much of a lie it is. Tony had spent fifteen minutes doing his makeup that morning, only to start crying and have to start over again. It was amazing, watching the little brush swipe over Tony’s olive skin, erasing the dark circles. He’d never had occasion to watch Tony put on makeup before, despite having his own done for the talk shows and whatnot. He wasn’t surprised, per se, but it was strangely intimate to watch Tony put on this smaller, more subtle kind of mask. The mask of being Tony Stark, lauded orator and public figure. Steve felt closer to him than he had in a long time, sitting on Tony’s bathroom counter and watching his friend erase the visual markers of grief from his handsome, weary face. It had made Steve want to hold him, and he’d reached out unthinking to brush his fingertips against the sharp line of Tony’s jaw. For a moment, he’d almost thought that Tony had felt it, but then he’d realised that Tony had stopped because he was crying. Even there, with no one to watch him, he did so silently. It was almost beautiful, the way he closed his eyes and let grief take him like a wave.
Steve closes his eyes and listens to the choked, furious sob that wrenches its way out of Tony’s chest. His only regret is that he and Tony have finally patched things up. They’re finally friends again. Things have been good.
Steve’s mouth drops open. His eyes flicker to Tony’s wrist, then back up to his face. He steps a little closer. “You mean…”
Tony shrugs, taking stock of the situation: him naked except for a pair of cotton sleep pants, Loki looking comfortable in some sort of raw silk tunic wrap, black trimmed in dark forest greens. He’s barefoot below leather trousers. Tony knows there’s a drive behind each action; soft and non-threatening when he surprises Tony in kitchens or private bathrooms, armoured and guarded in the room where they fought. He’s laying the groundwork for their interactions, trying to convince Tony of his trustworthiness. It would be more convincing if he didn’t know Loki’s leathers and weapons could appear out of thin air.
“Are you going to fuck me?” he asks, and Tony near about swallows his tongue. “Or let me taste you, like I wanted? I’ll be good for you.” His eyes dip half-closed, lashes a golden sweep over his flushed cheekbones. “I was good to you last time, wasn’t I?”
I have a lot of the same reservations about Riri as a lot of PoC do. I think that often the way she’s been written has been clumsy, and shows a misunderstanding of what it means to be a black woman in America. But I like the idea of her, and when I thought of Tony being kidnapped I needed it to be a) somewhere close enough that they could maybe get there in time by quinjet to stop it but not in NYC b) somewhere that it made sense for Tony to be without the suit and c) somewhere where a civilian could step in and help him. It just made sense to have it be Riri. I like to think of her just showing up on the superhero scene a few months from now with her own suit and Tony and Steve just staring at some CNN footage of her fighting some bad guy above the Boston harbour and looking at each other like ._____. we know EXACTLY who that is.
When he came back, Tony was nosing along his jaw, his hips rocking ever so gently, a low purring rumble echoing in his chest. Steve could feel the sound, the low bass tones sending skitters of pleasure through him where they were connected. He lifted a lazy hand and tangled it in Tony’s hair, tilting his alpha’s head up for a messy kiss.
“Come find me, when you’re ready?” he asks, and fuck, is that a command? Tony nods at him, biting back a wince. “Alright.” He steps away from the elevator, shuffling his feet awkwardly. “Well, uh. I guess I’ll see you around.”
“Did you plan this?” Tony asked, sounding equal parts dismayed and impressed, and Steve grinned at him. Tony seemed resigned to whatever Steve’s plan was, anxiety slowly being replaced with a quiet, fierce kind of joy. The sight of his crinkling crow’s feet made Steve step close, within touching distance. He wanted to kiss them.
“I think it’s Hydra,” Bruce said, and Steve let out blue streak that would have made his mother wash his mouth out with soap. “I can’t confirm it yet, but the SUVs have led to a shell corporation with offices in a town in Georgia that was linked to an unconfirmed Hydra sighting last May. It’s incredibly thin, but that’s all we’ve got right now.”
“I’d tell you the same thing, but I don’t think it’d do much to help you,” Tony says. He flexes his fingers, wincing as Widow catches Clint in the jaw with her metatarsus, soundly dislocating it. She’s fighting for keeps, dancing out of the range of Steve’s hands and trying to keep Clint between them.
Eventually, Tony stops sleeping in his bed entirely. He shuts himself into his workshop. Steve learns to only touch him when Tony begs for it—when he comes, slinking and guilty like a scolded pet, and murmurs Steve’s name into the night like an invocation.
brain was already half scrambled before you, what, became one with the suit? We’ve got bets running, so you gotta tell me before I fillet you. How’d you do it? Did you manage to get your hands on a bit of the Bleeding Edge armour? Try to reverse engineer it?” He turns his head ever so slightly, eyes flashing in triumph. “What was the other theory, partner?”
“Then let’s do this right, okay?” He’s pleading, he knows he is, but he doesn’t like this feeling squirming in his stomach. Now that the sex haze is gone, it’s just him and the knowledge that if Steve had said something in the heat of the moment, Tony would have been unable to say no. He can’t imagine a situation where he’d want to say no, but Steve was proving to be marvellously, gloriously surprising when it came to sex. Tony has no interest in watersports, or ageplay, or furries, and he doesn’t want to take any chances.
Loving Tony any more than he already does would create a singularity. It’s something he knows he could never undo. It’s something he does not deserve. If the Civil War was what it was like when they reach an intractable problem and there still remains some form of barrier between them, what would it be like when the thin line between them has been erased? Steve knew from his father exactly how love could turn to hate. To violence. It was in his blood, same as his mother’s healing hands, and he’d always known exactly what kind he’d inherited. He was a killer, just like his pa. He can feel that sense of betrayal still lingering between his teeth, the pressure to bite like a vicious, feral thing. The memory of Tony under his hands, shaking, blood on his face, will haunt him until the day he dies. Tony deserves better than Steve. He knows that isn’t what Tony thinks. It probably isn’t what anyone thinks, save for a small handful of people who love Tony better than they love Captain America. Carol. Jim Rhodes. Pepper Hogan. Jan, maybe, when Jan was still around. God, but he misses her.
‘Even the Warhols?’ Pepper replies almost instantaneously, innocent as a blood-lipped lion. ‘It will be a pity to see them go; they were Tony’s favourite.’
“Well,” Steve says, and then stops. He rubs a frustrated hand over his face. “Isn’t it obvious why?”
“Only two. I think you should clear them and then get Doctor Banner down here, stat. I think it’ll be okay now. You’ve taken out almost everyone else in the building, and if he’s with you Tony says he won’t get set off. Tony’s really hungry.”
“Stark killed Loki,” the woman says, dragging a hand over his chest. Everywhere she touches burns like a brand. “So I will make sure that when he comes for you, there will be nothing of you left to find.”
“Yessir.” He can feel the bed dip as Steve stands, whistling jauntily. There’s the soft rustle of fabric, and Tony debates for about half a second before he pulls his arm away from his face. Steve has pulled off his shirt, standing there hard and mouth-wateringly cut in the low light of dawn, nothing but the thin fabric of his boxers hiding him from Tony’s ravenous gaze. He’s blushing hotly, pink spread from his cheekbones all the way down his chest, but he’s proud, too. Tony wants to eat him alive.
God, the thought of Tony breeding him was enough to make him stifle a small sound. He closed his eyes and tried to pay attention to the conversation, but when he came back to himself he could see Tony’s eyes on him, pupils black with wanting.
The heat and the friction is incredible. Steve is clenching down tight, gasping, breathless. Wet hair falls into his face as he fixes his hands on either side of Tony, clenched fists resting on the tub because he’s afraid of hurting Tony or breaking something. His whole body is trembling. He’s beautiful.
He could feel Tony getting close, now, tugging gently at his hair to pull him back. Steve had swallowed him down to the root and kept on swallowing, breathing carefully through his nose and letting Tony fuck his throat, but he could feel Tony’s knot swelling against his teeth and suddenly, he wanted it. He wanted to give that to Tony.
“I see,” Loki says, expression serious, and Tony restrains a smile. “Thank you for the…new experience. I have preparations to make.”
“Yeah,” Steve says, face softening as he remembers how handsome Tony had looked that morning, his hair in ridiculous spikes and curls, eyes half-lidded and glittering. “I’m…really happy.” He clears his throat, shaking his head a little to come back to himself. “Things were pretty rough there, for a bit. We’d been fighting. But I think we’re in a good place, right now. Or, I hope we are.”
“They keep bringing me these broken white boys,” Shuri sighs, and Tony offers her a wry smile. “At least I know you.”
He doesn’t fear the Hulk, exactly. The Hulk knows him, loves him even. He’s part of Bruce, after all. He’s all the broken bits, the child abuse and the suppressed PTSD, the shaking anger left over from trauma that Bruce never talks about. Tony’s not even sure Bruce remembers half of the things that have happened to him, but he wouldn’t be surprised if he didn’t. The Hulk is a walking personification of C-PTSD, and both Bruce’s protector and his inner child love Tony. Perhaps, he thinks, Bruce has a point.
“Happiness,” Tony says, slowly, thinking about JARVIS and human touch and data. “High bar, huh Locksley?”
Jim is alone by the time Steve gets upstairs, which is convenient. He’s watching a basketball game without putting much attention to it, and when Steve enters he stands up and reaches a hand out to clasp arms, bringing Steve into his body for a back-slapping hug.
“Wow,” Steve murmurs, and he’s not looking at Tony’s face anymore. He’s staring at Tony’s tentacles, which have apparently decided to put on a light show: undulating bioluminescent bands of gold and warm, hot-coal orange line his tentacles from waist to tip in a gently waving pinstripe formation. It’s oddly mesmerising, and entirely embarrassing, because it is absolutely textbook mating behaviour.
Steve frowns. “Hang on, I saw a SHIELD shrink and they cleared me for culture shock and PTSD and all that.”
“Just so I know what he’s on our shitlist for,” Bruce adds, and Tony looks at him. His face is still placid, and Tony blinks as affection overwhelms him, processing it, letting it pass.
He glances back at Loki, leaning against the bathroom doorway. His arms are crossed across his chest, brow furrowed, and Tony wonders if human body language can really be applied to Loki, if he’s projecting an image for manipulation or his defensiveness is real. Cursing himself, Tony moves back towards him, slipping into his space and leaning in to meet his eyes.
“Did you bring it?” Tony asks, choosing another at random, and Pepper sighs. She pulls a little black box out of her purse and passes it to him, and Tony takes a moment to be grateful that she knew to conceal it from his vision in some small way. He restrains the surge of fear and nausea, pushes it down, puts the box at the far edge of the table.
“Do you think people change?” he asks. He turns, studying Ms. Bliss as she stares at him, unperturbed.
Tony shakes his head. He shakes his whole body, like a wet dog coming in from the rain. Then he turns back towards the funeral, and Steve is snapped right back next to him, with enough force that he almost crumples to the ground with the potency of his nausea. When he reaches out an instinctual hand to catch himself on Tony’s body, his hand settles on the back of Tony’s neck, and Tony whips around with enough force to knock Steve to the ground.
Christmas was a cruel holiday for most anyone in Timely. There was hardly ever enough happiness, ease, or family to go around. Money, too, was hard to come by for some, though things had been better on that front after the gold and Casino and the rail. Predictably, with the money had come bad men, and corruption, and desperation; all bad for the Christmas spirit. If anyone would know about that, it would be a Stark.
Pepper stares at him for a long moment, mouth pursed, eyes narrowing, before she finally sighs and pushes her hair over her shoulder. “Pass me the fusilli.” Tony does, locking eyes with a calculating Loki before turning his gaze back to Pepper. “I’ll take care of Maria, but you need to sort out this thing with SHIELD. They’re a mess, and the government is going to come down on us if we don’t get our house in order, Tony. We’ve gotten away with a lot because the court of public opinion loves you, but that may not always be the case. The D.O.D. is breathing down my neck again. We need to be united in the message we’re putting out.
Steve crawled up obediently and took Tony’s mouth in a claiming kiss, sweeping his tongue in to tease out Tony’s. The noise Tony made was nothing short of utter satisfaction, and Steve moaned quietly into Tony’s mouth at the sound of it, fucking his fist properly now.
Steve could feel Tony’s breath on his lips. His scent was everywhere, hot and interested, and Steve could feel his body responding despite his all-encompassing humiliation. He took a shaky breath, holding his ground, and Tony went preternaturally still. His eyes widened, and then he took a firm step back, drawing his chin in a little and raising his hands in the air in the universal sign of surrender.
“Well,” Bruce said, and Steve’s gaze snapped back to him, thanking God that the scientist was absorbed in data and not paying attention to his and Tony’s flirtations, “there’s no recorded evidence of an omega-omega bond. But there are stories.”
“It is absolutely my pleasure, Mr. Stark,” Taesha tells him. Her voice shifts a little, out of professional courtesy and into a confessional, earnest tone. “Thank you. If it’s alright to say that. My sister worked in midtown, and she…” Taesha takes a shaky breath, and Tony breathes in with her.
I am a terrible monster but nothing is abandoned, I promise. I was just dealing with some personal stuff/trying to finish uni and fic was the last thing on my mind. But hey, I’m a graduate! ^A^’’
“Great,” Tony says, rolling his eyes. He’s manfully refraining from the easy pun. He hopes that someone’s proud of him for his restraint. And then, because he can’t resist: “Hey… are you Irish?”
“The polite veneer of the good soldier fades to reveal the Brooklyn street urchin,” the professor observes jovially, and Steve can feel the evidence of his embarrassment crawling down over his chin and across his neck. “Don’t worry. I prefer honesty, mostly because anything else is a waste of time.”
Tony waits with open arms for the suit to fly up to meet him. He can hear the hiss of the tower panel opening to JARVIS’ machining levels, the sound of the repulsors increasing in volume until the suit floats up towards him. Grinning, he vaults the rail and jumps out to meet it, metal closing around his arms, familiar and dear. The suit drops ten floors before he’s fully secured, tumbling in mid-air to get his feet under him. The long drop down to the pavement waits beneath, ants and beetles still shuttling through the lamplight at the arsecrack of Thursday and Friday.
Tony stills under him. He blinks, then struggles a little to sit up. Steve gamely sits back, balancing over Tony’s knees as the man shakes off the afterglow. A curious expression filters over his face, his brows coming together as he pulls up a display.
“Rhodey,” Tony begins, sighing, but Rhodey cuts him off with a hand. He turns his body turning to face Tony, loose and rolling with disbelief.
alive, the kid’s got that much right. I’m sure the Sorcerer Supreme can fix this. No harm, no foul, okay?”
“Feel distended?” Steve asks, arching a playful eyebrow, and Tony flushes. Hard. His fingertips dig into Steve’s skin, rigid enough that it would hurt the average person. Steve
Steve shakes his head, jogging in place as he circles back to the park edge and waits for a light. “Thank you, JARVIS,” he says, meaning it. His chest hurts a little, but the truth always does.
“Hey,” Tony said, ducking underneath him, pressing himself up against Steve’s front to catch his eyes. “Hey, sweetheart.”
She’s looking at Tony with the kind of horror that most people save for roadkill and slasher films. Her fingers are pale against the Staff of One except for where they’re stained with her own blood, rust-coloured and flaking against her chapped skin. Tony can sympathise. He’s pretty mortified himself.
He remembers those weeks. It’s not his finest moment, but then again, Tony has so few fine moments when he looks back on his life. He feels wrung out, but this betrayal is smaller in the scope of things, now. It’s less than he’d suspected her of. He knows that’s probably part of why she feels comfortable telling him this, now. Natasha is always calculating.
Steve nuzzles into his temple and presses a soft kiss there. It’s strangely tender, and Tony turns his head to study him. He can feel Steve’s pulse through the hyper-sensitive skin of his tentacles.
“I…I can’t do it this way,” Steve says, and Tony blinks at him. “I need you to control it, this time. I can’t trust myself.”
He stares at the ceiling until the sun rises. Then he turns, and watches the breath rise and fall in Tony’s chest. The sun slips over his skin like a warm blanket, painting the lines and curves of his musculature in gold and shadow. With every breath, his obliques shift: invisible, visible, and back again. Steve reaches a hand out to touch, then sighs. He lets it fall back to the bedsheets.
“Now you’re just messing with him,” Steve murmured, but he leaned down for another kiss. And another. He pulled back when Natasha cleared her throat.
“Let me down,” Tony says, and Steve reluctantly takes hold of his waist and lifts up, ducking out from between Tony’s thighs. “My god.”
Tony pulled his fingers out and Steve would have whined at the loss, but immediately he pressed in deep, enough that the head of his cock grazed the back of Steve’s throat. Steve spluttered a little, not expecting it, and Tony drew back for a moment before pushing in again. Steve was ready this time, relaxing his throat and opening for him, and then Tony was pressing in to the hilt and Steve was swallowing, over and over, reflexive and painful and desperate as Tony fucked his throat with brutal precision.
You can make this figure with your hips when you dance. Over and over you will return to that moment of balance before your weight shifts from one hip to the other. The balance of this story is about to shift. The scenery is changing, as we make our slow way across Mare Internum.
“Steve,” Tony said, strangled, and then he was kneeling, cupping Steve’s face in his hands. “Touch me,” he rasped. “Steve.”
Rogers’ jaw tightened, and Tony winced at his own foolishness. A poor choice of words, considering how things had been between them the past few days.
Tony shrugs and sits next to Thor, bumping their shoulders together. “Sometimes talking is easier between strangers than family. The two of you have a lot of baggage. Like, a metric shit tonne of baggage. Enough to fill a shipping container. Hell, enough to fill a barge.”
For a moment they both stood there, awkward proximity between them, before Tony turned around. They were close enough that he could see the gold flecks ringing the sheriff’s pupils, small enough that they were lost in the blue from any distance. His eyelashes were longer than Tony remembered, and Tony wet his lips and reached up, running a gentle thumb over Rogers’ fluttering eyelid, feeling the barely-there brush of them against his fingers.
Steve comes first, his hips stuttering against Tony’s. He ducks his head to Tony’s shoulder, teeth clamping down on the muscle there in a way that’s sure to leave a lovely ring bruise in the morning. That, his twitching cock inside Tony’s body, and his hand tightening on Tony’s is enough to send him over the edge not long after, his body jack-knifing in pleasure with Steve still hard inside of him.  It’s the kind of orgasm that whites out his vision in a good way, sound dimming around him as the blood roars in his ears, his body shimmering all the way down to his toes.
E X P L A I N, Steve taps, because he doesn’t think Tony will stand still long enough to let him get out all the questions he wants to ask.
“Come on,” he says, and Tony swallows, pressing their foreheads together for just a moment. He breathes in, sharing breath, warmth. “
“Are…are you okay?” Steve managed, not really sure what he was asking. Tony just smiled thinly at him, tapping on the arc’s casing with his fingernails and making it clink dully through the fabric of his shirt.
The truth is, their whole relationship is littered with little moments like this: things Steve wouldn’t let himself feel. And maybe it is because it was forbidden, in some small part of Steve’s mind. Perhaps Tony had been right about that. There is some small piece of him, left over from his youth, that skitters away from thoughts of men like that. Even though he’d fought bullies for saying bigoted things when he was young. Even though he’d stood up for Arnie. It’s different, when it’s you. When you’re Catholic. When you’re Army. When you’re the walking avatar of a country that doesn’t always abide by its own high standards of equality and fairness for all.
“We’re listening,” Bruce said, and something in his eyes made Steve pause. He knew, Steve realised. Of all people, Bruce must know. He was probably the one who was providing Tony the medication, running his check-ups. Bruce must have known the whole time.
, since absolutely nobody noticed that oh, hey, turns out that when Morgan Le Fay hit me with her flashy purple light, it actually did something!” Okay, maybe he’s panicking a little. “Please tell me Strange is in the city right now.”
“Loki, what are you up to?” she says, touching her chest briefly. Then she disappears in a gaudy flash of pale green light.
He separated the yolks from a few eggs, setting the whites aside and adding the yolks to his own egg mixture. With the serum, he could never have too much protein.
“We connected, I think. I had become the best Widow that the program had ever produced. They began to partner us on missions.” Here, she smiles. “I thought I was in love.”
He taps the arc reactor in time to his footsteps, fine leather and metal, keratin and crystal. He's ticking down to something, he can feel it building sharp and static, but he doesn't know what it is. All he knows is that the fallout will be magnificent.
Tony sighs, runs a hand through his hair. “Fine, send Pepper the specs, and cc Doctor Chandrakar while you’re at it. Tell him this is in-house for now, but maybe he can think of a way to make it a little more elegant.”
“Remember this moment, later,” she says. She closes her eyes, bittersweet guilt and pain flickering over her face. It’s an expression Tony knows well, although he doesn’t much like it. It’s one they’ve shared together, on many a dark night. “Remember this entire conversation. One day, it’ll be very, very funny.”
“Just the man I was looking for,” Tony’s saying, and Steve can only think that can’t be right. Tony never seeks him out. “Wanna spar? Happy took off with Pepper.”
Tony doesn’t say anything. He rubs his fingers over his mouth, then pulls them away to look at them, as though he expects to find blood. The sound that he makes then is brutal in its heartbreak. Disappointment and grief made manifest. It breaks Steve’s heart in two.
It doesn’t help that Steve still can’t always control his ability to touch. Touching Tony takes effort. It’s exhausting. He feels as wrung out as Tony looks. He wishes he felt more rested after he sleeps. There is nothing more excruciating than watching Tony’s face fall when he calls for Steve and receives no answer. Once, it took Steve nearly an hour to manage it, and in the interim Tony hadn’t even cried. He’d simply shut down. His entire body had stilled. The only motion he seemed to be able to make was his mouth, murmuring Steve’s name. Calling for him. Begging.
Steve swallowed heavily, heat building low in his body at the smell and feel of his alpha, the possessiveness in Tony’s voice and the bass tones that made him want to lean over the counter and present himself to be taken. He settled for clasping a hand over Tony’s on his stomach, pressing back into his embrace. Tony hummed and pushed back, trapping him.
“I didn’t take you for a sweet and intense kinda guy,” Tony goads, and Loki smirks at him and moves even
, God help him, the fighting. When they were good, they were good, but when they spoke past each other or butted heads it was like a flash grenade, blinding fury and panic every time. He’d meant it when he told Tony that no one could rile him up like him. Tony affected him in ways he didn’t quite understand, pulling out that fragile, angry part of him that he thought he’d put away after the serum. Maybe it was just that Tony made him feel like a little kid again, vulnerable, all his weak parts exposed to the sharp metal of Tony’s wit.
But no, that wasn’t it, was it? He’d been so out of it he’d touched him without thinking, expecting to be able to catch himself on Tony.
It’s not a bad idea. Tony had thought about making a space for the Hulk, although he’d been thinking of putting him in a subbasement. But that’s not the real issue, here. Technically, Steve’s current rooms are in Tony's part of the tower. Or they will be, once all the renovations are done. Steve’s not just refusing to move to DC. He’s refusing to move out of Tony’s penthouse.
. He knows that he’s the only one Tony will slow down and listen to, every time. “It’s not like I can do it. Clint isn’t suited. Thor, as one of the team’s tanks, doesn’t have the field of vision to make big picture calls, and he still doesn’t understand Earth’s geopolitics well enough. And Nat works best in the shadows, not at the centre of the things. You’ve been a superhero longer than anyone, and you have plenty of experience commanding large groups of people, as well as with military manoeuvres and tactics. That’s why you’re Cap’s second-in-command in the first place.”
“No,” Steve says, remembering all the things Pepper’s been through. “But she implied that a mutual friend of ours could be credited with being her moral compass. And that surprised me, because I guess I don’t think of this other friend of ours as that kind of guy.”
He turns and looks around with newly informed eyes. There’s a hall visible to his left, lined with heavy steel doors, and he makes his way towards them. As he gets closer he can see various warnings on the signs, lights that go on when the rooms aren’t to be entered. No one’s here, and so Steve slips through one door. He can’t make heads or tails of most of what he’s looking at, but he makes sure to consign everything that looks vaguely important to relate to Tony and Reed and Franklin later to his memory.
Loki says nothing, but emanates a clear air of displeasure. His shoulders are tight, body perfectly poised. Tony takes another sip and comes around the bar, stopping just short of touching range. He searches Loki's face, pulling his lip between his teeth.
“Come by for supper,” he said, and Tony turned around to try to read his expression. “I’ll put on a pot.”
“Oh, is that what you were doing?” Tony asks, crooking a finger at him. Steve swings a leg over the rail with a bright grin, then the other, ambling forward with his hands in his pockets. “You know, if you cause any mischief, we’re out in public. Anybody could see you.”
“Yes,” Loki says, that damn note of approval back in his voice again. It’s both patronising and seductive, which Tony is sure is intentional.
Loki laughs mirthlessly, a familiar desperation flickering over his face. It’s there and gone in an instant, but Tony remembers it from the darker days at the start of their acquaintance. It is not a good look on him, even without the gaudy horns. “I cannot.”
Tony examines the resulting graphic for a moment, then stretches his hands to blow it up. “Okay, now take the measurements we’ve gotten from mjölnir and the bifrost drops, and feed it through as one big sustained signal.”
“Yes,” Pepper says, and Natasha smiles at her, just the barest lift of one corner of her mouth before the mask drops back down. “Tony, I may sleep here tonight.”
“Yeah, just great,” he agrees flatly, picking up his mug. Steve smells the familiar sweetness of jasmine as he moves towards the door. “Don’t destroy too much property on your brunch date when it all goes to hell. It reflects poorly on the rest of us.” His smile is bitter with self-hatred and directed malice, all teeth.
“Don’t be a jerk, Tony. It’s childish, and cruel. People will look to you for guidance, now that Steve’s gone. You know that.”
He tilts his head and studies Steve for a minute. Underneath his embarrassment, his eyes glint with a challenge. His jaw is set stubbornly. He's unbelievably attractive like this. Here’s the man that Tony’s read about: the one who hitchhiked across state lines to try to enlist under fake names up and down the Northeast.
“Well, that’s not like you,” Reed says. Reasonably, Steve thinks. Reed even looks a little affronted. There’s something quietly charming about his flailing attempts. It speaks, if nothing else, to his love for Tony. “There’s always something to do. When something’s wrong, we fix it, don’t we?”
Tony shrugs, and Steve books it, jogging to the elevator and hitting the button maybe a little harder than he needed to. He’s in his pyjamas, fingers blackened with charcoal from his sketches this morning. He takes a deep breath, tries to screw his head on straight.
“Let it,” Steve said, and then kissed him, because Tony was right; he wasn’t that kind of alpha. He would never take what he didn’t think was being offered, and Tony would never let himself believe that Steve wanted him unless he was boxed round the ears with it. Steve knew the way Tony’s brain worked, the way he was always looking for the worst way to read a situation, the way he always put himself at fault.
“You think things were black and white during World War II?” the professor asks, amused now, and Steve frowns.
When Steve presses Tony’s wrist to his bonding gland, he keeps his eyes squeezed shut. Tony’s thankful for it, in a way. He doesn’t know what he would do if he had to look at Steve while it was happening. This is already more intimate than anything he’s ever done with anyone. He feels like his heart is going to crawl out of his chest.
“Oh, you’re good,” Tony says, and Shuri laughs. “Damn. Now I’m really, really sad I don’t remember you. I bet we’ve done some
“I have been granted access to a file on Agent Romanov’s personal server, which at first glance includes classified documents from the KGB alluding to The Winter Soldier’s involvement in the Red Room program, dating back as far as 1954. I will need about half an hour to analyse and corroborate the data.”
Sometimes, Tony talks to him, which is deeply surreal. In the beginning, Steve had to fight the urge to talk back to him. He’d ranted and raved at Tony. He’d shouted in his face. He’d tried running full tilt away from his body, then shaking him as soon as he’s snapped back to his side. So far, nothing’s worked. It’s been nearly two months, now, that Steve’s been dead, and he’s beginning to get nervous. He doesn’t want to think about being stuck like this forever, but it’s hard to be optimistic under the circumstances. He thinks he can be forgiven for struggling a little emotionally when he’s forced to watch Tony mourn him, day in, day out. The depression and addiction has always been painful to experience as someone who loves Tony, but it’s doubly hard now, when Steve knows he’s partially responsible for it. When all he can do is watch, and say nothing.
“Excuse me,” Steve stammers, and speed walks out of the kitchen. Tony blinks after him, too shocked to be properly offended.
Behind him, the sky is lit dark blue and beautiful. His eyes are crinkled closed with laughter. He is still the most beautiful man Steve’s ever seen.
“Just having a chat with Captain America,” Tony says easily, sliding over so the limo can pull up in front of them. Cabe sits in the driver’s seat, the window rolled down. In the contrasting light, her hair looks the colour of spilt blood. “The personal touch means I’m in trouble, I take it?”
“You’re right,” Cabe says easily, making eye contact through the rear view mirror. “Ms. Potts told her head of security that there was a potential threat, and he reached out to me in an official capacity seeing as it’s our job to make sure you both stay safe. Tell me, boss, when were you planning on talking to me about the Loki situation?”
“Do you not think he paid for them, in his years in exile?” Shuri asks. Tony opens his mouth, then closes it again. “Often strong emotions are re-contextualised by circumstance. The wound is fresh for you. I understand. But you should know, so that when you see him, you better understand his actions.”
“Hair of the dog?” Steve deadpans, eyeing the barrel. His train of thought catches on Clint’s earlier comment about medication. “You were hungover this morning.”
“I don’t want anyone else,” Steve tells him. He’s so stubborn. He’s magnificent, even splotchy and soaked in tears. He looks like Cabanel’s
Tony stared at him for a long moment. “I spent the last month in captivity scared shitless that I was going to go into heat,” he said, and Steve winced. “I wouldn’t have, so soon. I know that now. But. I needed to get out of there.”
Tony rocks back on his heels. He turns to glance at Loki, his mouth moving wordlessly. “Fine,” he says. “Fine. I’m just…I’m gonna-…”
“That kind of thing is a poison, y’know? Keeping it locked up inside. It ruins people from the inside out, when you bottle that shit up.” Tony pauses, as if waiting for Steve to reply, but Steve doesn’t have anything to say to that. Tony laughs, then: quiet, almost sad. “I just wish I could have shown him the future.”
Tony kisses him. It’s soft, just on the forehead, but Steve melts into it like it’s the only thing keeping him grounded. The breath punches out of his chest.
“Sorry,” he says. A touch of pink spills over his pale cheeks, and an answering delight bubbles up inside Tony at the sight of it. He’s unfairly adorable. “I…I’ll get used to it. I promise.”
“How can you be mad at me for not knowing what’s going on in your head, Steve?” Tony asks, scraping a shaking hand over his face because, fuck. He’s so tired. He’s
Tony ignores Clint and Thor’s departure and pokes Steve again, twisting in his hold and laughing when Steve grabs for his wrist and misses. “Too slow, Rogers!”
Tony blinks at him. “Did you…come? Already?” He takes a moment, fighting the broad grin that wants to break over his face. “Did you come from blowing me, because that’s honestly the best thing I’ve ever heard-”
“Tony Stark!” A familiar roar echoes down the stairs, followed by the clump of several sets of feet. “I must speak with you!”
“Some of those people died because they weren’t reached in time. Tony was found safe, under the rubble. Do you think your time would have been better spent clearing the hospital?”
"Tony?" Steve says, hesitantly now, and Tony lifts his head to look at him. He looks a little bashful, now. All that fire, and he'd been stoppering it up. He'd smothered it because of Tony.
Now, there were all these studies. They said that omega brains were more complex, and better at multitasking. They said that omegas experienced more pain than alphas, and they could take more of it, too.
“What are you grinning about?” Tony asks, and Steve looks up to where he’s leaning against the doorjamb. He’s got a toothbrush in one hand as he considers Steve, his eyes creased ever so slightly with mirth.
Tony looks doesn’t bother to look away from the mirror, poking at his split lip with an antiseptic salve and hissing at the sting of it. In his peripheral vision, he can see Loki rise from his perch on the tub and walk towards him, reaching out.
Loki nods, and Tony licks his lips, tilting his head to better see The Black Widow stepping out of the building. Pepper stands behind her, expression caught between nervousness and determination.
...?” Steve says, wondering. Howard, the irrepressible alpha with a girlfriend in every state. “Wow.”
“He’s in full fugue now, I think, after the Captain’s little speech,” Riri said, and her voice was disapproving if Steve had ever heard it. Great, now he was being chastised for his sentimentality by a fifteen-year-old kidnapping victim. “I had to gag him, but we’re all good here. Just waiting on you, Doc.”
“That’s what you think. Little do you know.” Steve smiles, soft and warm, and Tony can’t help but smile back at him. “Anyway, you can say sex, Steven.”
“Was that why?” Tony asked, shocked, and Steve turned to stare at him. He opened his mouth, then closed it again.
“After you destroyed the very ground I stood on?” Loki hisses, body stiffening against Tony’s back, and Tony wraps a hand around the forearm draped over him in warning. “You speak as though you were innocent in my fall, when it was your incompetence that created the circumstances requiring my action.”
“My heart may give out, but oh what a way to go,” he says cheerfully, rolling to lie on his back. “Have at it, then.”
“There are plenty of other issues that trauma can cause,” the professor says, sounding tired. “They’re just not treated as seriously. I would need more time to formulate an official diagnosis, but I would say that this incident could potentially cause PTSD without ongoing treatment. More importantly, I believe you are presently suffering from survivor’s guilt and mild depression, which I think should be addressed considering the high-stakes work that you and The Avengers do, alongside the regular, high exposure to traumatic and violent incidents.”
“You don’t have to say any more,” he said, but Tony shook his head, laughing bitterly at himself. It was a sound that Steve was familiar with, but he hated it all the same.
He presses his forehead to the cold glass of the shower, breathes out. He remembers Tony’s hand in his, squeezing, gently. He remembers Tony telling him, a mix of shock and delight washing over his handsome, tired face:
Peggy hadn’t wanted anyone to take care of her, but that isn’t the kind of person Tony is at all. He’s independent, sure, but also…neglected, in some kind of essential way. He needs care, in a way that Peggy hadn’t ever needed care. Steve has thought about it a lot—what is it that makes them perfect for each other? Tony is strong, in exactly the ways that Steve loves. He’s brilliant, and beautiful, and so clever. He’s hurt, and deserves kindness. He’s had so little kindness in his life. If love is patience, then Steve can be patient for Tony. He’d wait for another hundred years, it if meant Tony would be waiting for him with that small, vulnerable smile that Steve has only been graced with a handful of times but strives desperately for. He’d sink another plane, fight another war. He’d kill another hundred men. The way Steve feels about Tony is too big. It feels biblical. It feels like coming apart at the seams. And if that isn’t love, what is?
“This does not meet my definition of harm,” Loki explains. He sounds tired, as though he is explaining a simple concept to a child.
“Wanna talk about it?” Tony says, finally, when he can’t bear the silence anymore. Steve lets out a breath, sketches out a wrinkle at the corner of Tony’s lips. They’re curled into something halfway between a grimace and a smile. He doesn’t look at Tony once to check his lines, and Tony wonders if the image is that firmly imprinted in his mind. Perhaps he just knows Tony’s face that well.
“Whatever,” Clint muttered, stalking off to poke at his bow. Natasha exhaled in a quiet huff, then put her mask on and followed him. Steve watched as she cuffed him on the back of the head.
Bruce doesn’t say anything, and Tony sits up and turns to look at him. Bruce’s expression is unreadable. Curious and flat, the way he looks at a test tube in the lab.
“You deserve to know,” Tony said. This was quickly becoming an old fight, one Steve had no interest in rehashing, so instead he just shrugged, leaning back in his chair.
Thor is staring at his hands, feet planted flat on either side of where mjölnir lies on the ground before him. His posture speaks of defeat.
“Boy is she still mad at me,” Tony mutters. He heaves a tired breath and pushes himself to his feet. “So some things went south. Bad calls were made. I fucked up. Undisputable. But now we’ve got a safety network for kids like Franklin. The ones who don’t have amazing, superpowered parents. We didn’t have that before.”
Steve smiles wryly, trying not to let his bitterness show. “I don’t think you’ll like it very much.”
Tony startles, his heart jumping right into his throat to find Steve standing in the dark tower garage like some kind of Hitchcock antagonist. He’s blocking the panel to call the elevator, and he’s been standing still in one position for so long that the motion sensor lights have gone out. Tony didn’t even see him.
Tony grins, and lets himself be smug because that’s what Beth would expect. “He needed a shower,” he says breezily, waving a hand and walking back towards his work station. “All that lifting and carrying. He worked up a real sweat.”
Tony’s cock was right there, and he watched with half-lidded eyes as Tony took himself in hand, dragging the tip over Steve’s mouth without pushing inside. Steve could feel himself dripping; he wanted this so badly, his whole body trembling with the effort to stay still, to not just take what he wanted. Tony’s other hand scraped short nails through his hair, slipping down over his cheek to press one thumb to the sensitive corner of Steve’s mouth. It dragged over his lower lip, pulling roughly at the skin, and Steve opened his jaw even wider, pleading.
Steve grins and takes one of the long, gorgeous tendons of Tony’s neck between his teeth. God, but he’s wanted to do that for years.
good. All of the Avengers, each and every one of them, are better people than Steve could even begin to express. “Steve had a luminous quality that could be wholly attributed to the strength of his spirit. He was a bastion of light that called to each and every soul he touched. That was Steve’s power: more than his super strength, or his healing, or his eidetic memory. Steve’s power was to see the good in people, and to manifest it. To make real the ideals that lived in his heart. To bring out the beauty in someone or something that only he could see.
“Y’know,” Steve begins, a nasty twist to his mouth, “that’s pretty hypocritical of you, considering-”
“Tony,” Stephen says, frowning, and what the honest everloving fuck is going on right now, seriously, “I listened to your messages. All of them.”
“You’re not obligated, you know,” Tony says, although it sounds distant to his own ears. He takes a slow breath. He’s so tired of this. “You can do whatever you want, Steve.”
Steve let out a sharp whistle, raising his steaming coffee cup in a toast when they all turned to glance back at him. Thor grinned, lifting a hand.
“That, Captain, is precisely why Tony and I broke up.” She swallows, one corner of her mouth kicking up, but there’s no mirth in it. It’s an empty, aching thing, and the eyes she sets on Steve are both wet with tears and freezing cold. “And it’s why I have never trusted you. Howard made Tony feel small every day of his life, and used you to do it. And now here you come, alive, and all you do is ask Tony to be better by
When he clocks back in, everyone is staring at him. He rolls his eyes, disengaging the suit and sending it back to its wall case. He carefully avoids Steve’s gaze.
He’ll go alone, and he’ll bring pastels, like he wanted to in DC. Tony’s always appreciated his art as much as his musculature, anyway.
Steve’s not sure what he was imagining would be waiting for him when he arrived at JFK, but it certainly wasn’t a town car waiting to drive him back to the tower. The man at the wheel isn’t Happy Hogan, although he supposes that Hogan has better things to do. He isn’t quite sure what Hogan actually does for SI. As far as Steve has seen, Hogan’s job mostly seems to be standing there with an amused, exasperated, or long-suffering expression while either Pepper Potts or Tony berate him or each other about something that isn’t really his fault.
Steve sighs, all the fight going out of him all at once. Sympathetic pain echoes through his chest. “One day, that guilt he carries is going to swallow him whole.”
Instead of hanging around on the street where he’ll just be frustrated and in the way, Tony decides to head back home to the tower. He’s not going to be much use with the clean-up in this state, and he doesn’t expect he’ll see Stephen for a while. These big, potentially world-ending events tended to require a few days mopping up. And he
“Hey, gorgeous,” Tony breathed. He reached back, pulling his shirt over his head and letting it fall to the floor. “God, look at you.”
“What do you mean?” Steve asks, and Pepper tilts her head to the side. Her long hair slides in a burnished waterfall over one slim shoulder.
“This was a nice thing you did,” he says, and Tony shrugs. He’s maybe a little dazed. Steve’s blinding like this. Blindingly happy, and so, so gorgeous for it. God, to think he’d done that made his mouth water with wanting. “Faker.”
“I wasn’t even sure you were real,” Tony laughs. Seeing him jocular for the first time since Steve’s death takes the sting out of the implication that maybe Steve wasn’t as welcome as he thought he was. Even still, it pulls at something in his chest. Makes him ache. “Don’t fret, dear.”
“It’s easy to say no to things,” Reed says absently. He’s paging through Tony’s brain scans now, fingers tracing the shapes, peaks and valleys. Steve wonders what it is that he sees. “To look down on them. When all you do is criticise and refuse to offer concrete solutions to problems, it’s easy to always be right.”
Tony nodded, took a deep death, and pushed the door open. The wind fought the wood every inch, keening wildly, but he had to get back out into the storm.
He reaches out and puts a hand on the inside of one beautiful trembling thigh, his thumb sweeping into the divot there, pressing into that secret, hollowed out place. The skin is unbearably soft under his calloused finger. It makes him hitch a moan, the sound breaking out of his mouth unbidden.
Steve looks nonplussed by Tony's manic babbling. He rubs at his brow with one thumb. "Uh, it was… It was good. I like the priest there a lot. Been a while since I've been to mass, but uh." He colours, licks his teeth. It's strangely sexy. "Yes, my da was named after St. Joseph. I didn't know him real well, but I can tell you he wasn't much of a saint."
“You’ve ruined me,” Tony tells him seriously, and Steve’s face softens. He steps into the tub and sinks into the water, his eyes dancing.
In college, Steve Rogers was the source of a sexual awakening that Tony had previously left unexplored. Girls had been throwing themselves at him for as long as he could remember, but boys,
Eventually, Tony lies boneless in one of the rolling chairs he uses to scoot around the workshop. His eyes are wide in his face, breath still coming in pants. Steve is collapsed over him, straddling his lap, head braced on his shoulder. He traces lazy patterns over the starburst that faintly graces Tony’s sternum. He presses his palm flat to the skin, tries to feel for a heartbeat. Unnervingly, he isn’t able to feel it. It makes his heart stutter in his chest, and he presses closer. He tucks his face into Tony’s neck.
“I can wake you if Mr. Laufeyson, Mr. Odinson, or Captain Rogers make an appearance,” JARVIS offers, and Tony hums, considering.
“Uh.” Tony turned his head to glance at the oven clock, and Steve tried not to grumble at the loss of his mouth. “Half an hour? An hour if I use the suit.”
“Sir,” JARVIS reprimands, and Tony closes his eyes, his heart rabbiting in his chest like a live, shivering animal. He feels like he’s crawling out of his skin. “Shall I begin the Mind Riot Protocol?”
In the back, a huge platform sits, with a little tucked-away hub hidden by backdrop and skyline where Tony will be running the controls. All of the SI team members who were interested have a place on the float, lining the sides all around, and Tony climbs up into the back to do a few last minute checks on everything. He wants to make sure the colours on the Empire State building are going to light up the way he wants them to, and he sits down at his station and runs through a few of the settings just to double check everything is as expected.
“I’ll miss you Steve. Every day for the rest of my life. I wish you the peace you so rightfully deserve.”
“This is what talk therapy is for, Captain,” the professor says. His voice is gentle, and Steve glances at his hands folded in his lap and then back up to catch Xavier’s small smile: his kind, crinkled eyes.
“Tony, listen to me,” he pleads. He closes his eyes for a moment, brows furrowing as he sends up a quiet prayer to whoever is listening. When he opens his eyes, Tony is watching him, wary as a feral cat. “If you don’t want to do this, I- I’m not the kind of man to go where he isn’t wanted. I think you know that. But I think you do want it. I think you’re scared, and that’s okay. I’m scared, too. It’s okay to be scared. But you have to talk to me. You have to tell me where you’re at, so I can meet you there, Tony.” He takes a heavy breath, letting it fill his lungs. His mind spins dizzily, whether from the influx of oxygen or the thundering pace of his heart, he doesn’t know. “I can’t- I don’t want to keep stepping on landmines. I don’t like being shouted at for things I don’t understand, but more importantly, I hate hurting you. That’s not what I want. That’s never what I want. But you have to tell me, Tony. You have to talk to me. I will meet you, Tony, wherever you’re at, but you have to help me. You have to help me get there.”
The disc hits the basketball with a much more satisfying sound this time, and the ball pops up onto one of the branches it was wedged into. It rolls leisurely along for a breathless second, and then it’s falling. Steve bounds forward to catch it, then turns around and holds it aloft to show Tony, unaccountably proud of himself.
“He has full access to the suits,” Tony counters, and Cabe fixes him with a stern look that Steve can definitely appreciate. “Look, we have no way to track him. He’s shorted every single tracker that us or SHIELD has placed on him just by teleporting. JARVIS can’t see him even when I can, and the other Avengers can’t hear him even when I’m in the same room with all of them unless he wants them to. I’m trying to get on top of it.”
If Maria notices his strange behaviour, she doesn’t comment on it. She’s looking at Steve’s body, her face expressionless. Blank, almost. “You don’t remember the last time you stood vigil over his dead body.”
A startled laugh flies from Steve’s mouth, too loud. It bursts out into the larger chamber of the church, echoing strangely when the sound has already fallen flat within the tiny wooden box they share. Steve flushes, embarrassed.
“How did you know where Steve was?” Peter asks once they reach the front door, and Tony shrugs in the armour. It’s a strange motion, one that is uniquely Iron Man.
“Come on,” he says, and Steve looks at him for a long second before smiling a little, expression caught halfway between resignation and amusement. He nods once, then heads for the doors, shaking his head again. One hand tucks itself into a pocket. “I can’t believe I’m saying this, but Loki might actually be better for you.”
In some ways, it’s easier to talk to Shuri than anyone else, Tony finds over the next 24 hours. There’s no real history between them for her to be upset or startled about Tony not remembering. They’ve only been casual friends for the year since The Decimation—they’d already bonded over the mathematical inaccuracy of that term, and how much they hate it—and so in some ways, Tony is still new to her.
“They always leave,” Tony says again. The easiness with which the words come is all wrong. They rip the breath from Steve’s throat with their brutality, and they pull Carol in like a magnet. She crushes Tony to her chest, his face buried in the side of her neck. “I’m a genius, but that’s not enough. A brain in a can. I’ve never been enough to make anyone stay-”
“Nope,” Tony said, immediately shoving at Steve’s shoulder. “Red, hard limit, safeword. I refuse to have Natasha walk in on us stuck together by your cum in the middle of the sparring mats. I value my life. I do not consent.”
“This is your baby,” Tony says absently, déjà vu hitting him hard in the chest, leaving him breathless with it. “Um. I mean, Loki swore not to hurt any of my people, and you’re definitely my people.”
“I didn’t know,” Tony says, shaking his head. He’s staring down at his hands, gripping the glass so tightly Steve wonders if it will break between his fingers. He feels like he’s watching the scene through a film of plastic. “I didn’t…you. You said it was hard to love me, but you have no idea, you have
Five days is less time than Tony thought it would be, and he's been dreading it every single minute since he's been sober enough to know it was coming. Tony's elbow-deep in armour guts with little nicks and burns all over his skin, doing his best not to think about Steve at all. He's decided he's going to make the armour come to him, no matter where he is. The locator cuffs are chic, but they can be taken from him, forgotten, left on his bedside table. He needs something that will always find him. So he's always ready.
He could do it. He could go back upstairs and tell Steve he wanted to complete the bond, and Steve would go with him. He’d do his duty. A small, slightly hysterical laugh overtakes Tony at the thought. Lie back and think of America.
“I’m serving as a diplomatic liaison between Loki and Midgard,” Tony improvises audibly. It’s the closest thing to the truth he can think to tell her. “Thor, as our shieldbrother, is included as part of Midgard.”
“Captain Rogers, if I let anyone just walk in and have a chat with Miss Potts whenever they pleased, Miss Potts would never get anything done,” Ms. Bliss says, adjusting her glasses. She narrows her eyes at Steve, and Steve strains himself to keep an easy smile on his face. “I know you think that just because you’re an Avenger you can do whatever you please-”
“There’s never gonna be a good time, Tony,” Steve says stubbornly. “What we do doesn’t leave time, and I made the mistake of waiting too long once, I can’t-…” He stops, suddenly unable to look at Tony’s face anymore. “Either of us could, at any time, we…”
Tony nods, watching the numbers click down. “Widow, do a sweep of the interior. There’s anti-surveillance rooms on levels one through four. J, send a bot with her.”
has gotten some civilians killed. Also, uh. It’s. God, this is embarrassing, but it turns out that Steve has feelings for me, so. Consent is getting a little…grey, and I’d really like to not have that be a problem. Anymore. Or, ever. Um.”
“Sure, but if she’s doing this, she’s playing the long game, right?” Steve asks. He bites his lip, eyes narrowing as he surveys Natasha’s insouciant body language. She’s kicked her feet up on the desk, examining her nails and picking skin and blood out of them with her hands still cuffed together. It’s a tableau that Tony can’t help but smile at.
“Hey, Pep! Meet Arish. Arish, meet Pepper Potts. I’ve just agreed to let Arish and his buddies set up on the lawn every Wednesday, complete with some public programming initiatives.” The look that Pepper is giving him is absolutely transparent in its suspicion, and Tony offers her his most dazzling smile before turning back to his new friend. “Arish, I’m sure Ms. Arbogast would be happy to direct you to the proper Maria Stark Foundation employees to talk to about educational programming initiatives in the Memorial Park. She’s the sweet and yet not-so-subtly terrifying Iron Maiden up at the front desk.”
“There’s nothing wrong with you,” Steve says, like he can’t help but say it. It’s sweet. Predictable, but sweet. “I…can I ask, uh. I can’t imagine Howard reacted well.”
“I can’t understand why you’re doing this,” Tony says quietly, and watches Loki open to him, body going lax and expression shifting. “I don’t know what you get out of it, what you want in return.”
There wasn’t much info on whether or not transnatured individuals could bond. Steve knew that HRT made most people who went through it infertile, although some trans alphas who stopped taking alpha-hormone early enough could still get pregnant, or store viable eggs. As far as Steve could tell, Tony had been read as an alpha at least as early as his days in boarding school, which meant when he was still a kid. He’d definitely been on alpha-hormone too long for that to be an option.
“And wet leaves in autumn,” Tony repeated, wondering, and Steve pulled his hand back because that’s…it was too much. Tony wasn’t his. He wasn’t interested. He was off-limits. He was a friend.
“Okay, first off, what infractions?” Tony replies, spreading his hands. “Property damage? Because the Maria Stark Foundation covers all that and some. All Avengers merchandising goes to charity. All 501c3 financials are public record, and you all know ours has been picked through with a fine-toothed comb by every investigative journalist, blogger, and charity watch org from here to Sydney. Meanwhile, last I checked, we’ve saved millions of lives worldwide, sometimes in a day. Hell, half of
“I can list every sexual partner you have ever had in order from my creation ‘til now if that will assuage your doubts,” JARVIS told him dryly.
“Yes. Sleeping.” Natasha smiles, the barest lift to the corner of her mouth. It’s a smile pretty much reserved only for his antics, and it relaxes him a little. He puts the mug down, rests his elbows on the worktop behind him. “You remanded Steve to psychological review.”
“Yes, we’re here,” Rogers said. His voice was warm with mirth and fondness. He pulled Tony up the steps. “Come on. Jarvis’ cooking is always superb, and I’m just about starving.”
Tony tilts his head, furrowing his brows as he considers Bruce’s antsy shuffling. “What did he say to you?”
“Well.” Tony huffs another laugh, this one wilder than the last. He sounds almost hysterical. “Hank said it almost looked like his throat had… um. Like it was a claw, that did it. But that’s…weird, even for us, right?”
“Steve,” Tony says, a nasty suspicion creeping up on him, “did you think SHIELD was holding Barnes?”
Steve’s chest was aching as he listened to Bruce talk. He remembered the press of Tony’s lips over his chest less than an hour ago, the sound of him,
“Maybe,” Steve admits, and Logan eyes him thoughtfully. “Tony and I’ve been talking about expanding. Everyone else here’s pretty attached to the life, but I know you’ve always been a bit of a rolling stone. You haven’t changed much since I first met you.”
“What do you want from me?” Tony asks, squeezing his eyes shut. He says it again, again, until he’s shouting it: “What! What do you
“I didn’t say anything,” she sing-songs, but she doesn’t have to. Tony’s heard enough the past few days.
Steve flinches, just the barest twinge of his jaw. He begins a new line, a new shape growing on the page. “It’s what I know, isn’t it? What I’m good for.”
The shattered glass is gone, now, but it’s not exactly pretty. The tiles are pitted with marks left by falling debris, and the guard rail is missing in one section. Steve’s apparently taken that as an invitation, because he’s sitting cross-legged right in front of the part without any protection from the drop to the pavement. He’s got a little set of paints out, and he’s doing the skyline in rich, deep purples and oranges. He looks calm. Meditative.
“It means I’ve got to go back to the workshop and dust off some analytic programs I haven’t had to run in a very long time.”
“Yeah, laugh it up,” Wilson says, voice rough. Bruce hands him a glass of water, and Tony flops back down into his seat and polishes off the rest of his meal while Sam rinses his mouth out in the sink and gets himself settled. “We traded Cap for a genocidal psychopath?”
He’d tried to leave two more times, both without success. On the second go, after fighting through what felt like the worst electroshock torture of his life, he’d pushed through the pain and nausea and opened his eyes to find himself passed out on the floor next to his own motionless body. It had taken him another two hours to figure out how to get back to Tony, and by the end he’d been so exhausted and panicked that he’d lay at Tony’s feet for a solid twenty minutes, panting with exertion, trying to wrap his shaking fingers around Tony’s bare, fine-boned ankles and putting his hands right through him every damn time.
Tony smiles, face still pressed into Bruce’s bicep. He takes a long drag of his scent, breathes out slow. “What do I do if not make history, Brucey Bear?”
Tony doesn’t know how long he stands there. Long enough for the last humid hint of spring chill to leave him shivering, damp clothes clinging to the small of his back. The dried blood begins to itch, flaking off his skin. The moonless sky glimmers with the faintest hint of stars, bright polaris the only easy, glittering target in the whole mess.
Tony puts up a string of token protests, but he mostly lets himself be led into the bedroom. He brings his drink with him, of course. Steve watches him strip his jeans off with little more than fondness, considering the exhaustion seeping into the usually crisp lines of Tony’s frame. Steve can sympathise; that talk took a lot out of him, too. He follows Tony’s lead, slipping out of his khakis and folding them up on the bedside table. Tony always sleeps on the right.
He’s distracted enough that he forgets what had originally roused him, but Tony’s never been anything but sharply observant. His eyes scan the landing pad, and then he’s pushing himself to his feet, turning away from Steve and the 90-plus-story drop. Steve twists to follow him with his eyes, which means he’s just in time to see the space next to the quinjet distort strangely. The air…twists, somehow, a gold spark flickering, then twisting, almost like water circling a drain. It spreads, opens wider, and through it a single, long-fingered hand pushes through. It’s shaking, flecked with blood, and the vambrace that follows it is all too familiar.
“Faceplate up,” he demands, and Tony acquiesces. He brings his arms around Steve’s waist, because he can do that much right now.
, Tony,” Bruce says, a small smile playing around the corner of his mouth. “That’s what I’m telling you. Steve is treating you like his alpha. He won’t ask anything of you. He’s waiting for you to ask him.”
Steve stared at Tony for a moment, completely turned around by the shift in conversation. “I’m lost,” he admitted.
The silo was smaller than Steve had imagined for Hydra, but he supposed smaller was better when trying to hide in plain sight so close to Avengers HQ. It was little more than a pale blue mound surrounded by barbed wire when JARVIS went in for recon, but the sparse cover around the building had Steve wishing for better air coverage.
“Whatever you want,” Tony said, and he was practically bouncing on the balls of his feet, now. “Are you good, if I go now?”
As always, your comments and cheering-on are what get me through the dead spots, so please continue to leave them! As always, I’m more than happy to hear thoughts/discuss meta with you. This was a longer chapter than I expected because I feel like I’m rushing to the good parts, now. Hold on, folks; it’s gonna be a bumpy ride to paradiso.
Loki came back, for those of you who’ve missed him. Now you can see that he was off plotting, of course; where or what else would he have been doing? And yes, re: some of the comments I got, I do kinda feel bad for Steve. I’m trying to make him be less of a dick and usually the way that happens in real life is that the universe makes someone appreciate how good they’ve got it by making everything terrible for them for a while. So, this is me, serving as the universe.
moral compass. It is, in fact, the only thing I have never, ever needed to do for him. Because if that’s the case, it means that Tony is right, and everyone who hates him or belittles him or looks down on him is wrong. People don’t
As soon as he’s sealed up, JARVIS stabilises their flight, pulling Tony up in a lazy spiral and taking him out over the Hudson. They’ve done this a few times, when Tony’s anxiety’s gotten the better of him. At first, Tony couldn’t bear to be in the suit, but he couldn’t bear to be parted from it either. He’d taken to wearing the remote interface everywhere he went, even inside the tower. But he’d been too tired after his heat, and left the headset in his bedroom. Stupid. He’s never going anywhere without it again.
A fierce pride wells up inside of him. It is hilariously inappropriate under the circumstances, but his body doesn’t seem to care about that. He turns his face to the camera he knows sits in the corner of his bathroom, a small smile breaking over his face.
“Is that my penance, father?” Steve asks. This priest doesn’t seem quite like the ones he’s used to, but he finds that he likes his way of doing things much better.
It had been 78 hours since Steve’s death, and this is the first time Tony’s slept since it happened. He’d spent the entirety of the first night pulling blood from Angel, Logan, and every other regenerator and immortal-type in the superhero community. Nothing had helped. He’d even tried talking to Loki and Doom. He’d hovered over vials of Steve’s blood with the Hanks. He’d spent a sparse fifteen minutes crying silently, violently, piteously in the bathroom, then washed his face and come out and done it all over again.
It had been a surprise for everyone to find out that Clint was a pretty decent baker. Less so that Steve and Bruce could cook, or that Thor was excellent at a good meat roast if you gave him a fire to cook over, but Tony had expected something a little more bloody, from Clint. He’d expected something involving knives. In retrospect, the precision and fuss that baking required suited Clint in ways that Tony couldn’t really quantify. It spoke to his patience, his exacting nature. It also helped to calm him down when he was in a rough spot.
“Can you blame him?” Xavier asks, mouth curving into a slow sickle. It could almost be called kind, if it wasn’t so sharp. “It was by all accounts unpleasant, and you were a friend of his father’s. What’s more, much of the information is available to the public. I’m certain you’ve mastered Google by now, Captain.” He shakes his head. “Alas, we have digressed. Your homework is this: find something with which to begin a civilian life.”
Steve wishes he could have been there to see Peter and Tony explain themselves to Maria, but he still hasn’t figured out a way to accompany Tony while he’s flying without hurting himself. Instead, he’s forced to pace circles around his own lifeless body, his eyes trained on the door. It feels like aeons before it finally hisses open, and Steve bounces awkwardly on his toes as the three of them enter the room. Now that Tony’s here, he’s not sure how he feels about this. Should he get into his body? The very idea of it sends heat scorching over his cheeks, down his throat to his chest. He’s always been a horrible blusher, intangibility or no.
The second Sight Bond pair Tony met were Rhodey’s grandparents, and that was the one, if anything, that might have made him believe that maybe true love was possible. They’d been together fifty seven years, and they stayed that way until they died within days of each other. But Tony had almost never seen them apart, and the idea of needing someone that much terrifies him. Tony is uncompromisingly free. It is the part of himself that he loves most, and that he clings to with force. Tony is his own man. He does what he wants, creates things beyond most people’s wildest dreams, and doesn’t care what anyone else thinks of him. The idea of being inextricably tied to someone in such a visceral way for the rest of his life is the most terrifying thing that Tony has ever come up against—more than captivity, or the dark expanse of enemy-laden space, or cardiac arrest. Even the love that shone in their eyes when they looked at each other wasn’t enough to circumvent the knowledge that their bond was antithetical to the way that Tony prefers to live his life. Even now, with a Sight Bond of his own, he hasn’t shaken that fear. He’s self-aware enough to know that much of the way he reacts to Steve is a manifestation of it: the worry that Steve’s old-fashioned sensibilities might spell the end of everything about his life that Tony actually likes.
“Her signature is much more easily traced than Mr. Laufeyson,” JARVIS says, and Tony grins wickedly.
“You are cleared of any magical interference, yes,” the professor says, and Steve waits because he knows what’s coming. “But you are clearly suffering signs of trauma. I would say Stark was right to recommend treatment. And not just for this incident.”
“Oh, jealous, honey bear?” Tony says. He pushes up from the table, then claps his hands together. “Okay, we ship out at 23:00, prep however it is you wanna prep; nap a bit so you’re actually awake, inject some caffeine or something a little stronger, whatever floats your boat I don’t judge-”
“You did?” Tony asks. He wipes the sweat from his brow with the back of one hand, then fixes Steve with a sceptical expression. “When?”
Tony gasps as Steve swallows him down again, straight to the root. The low moan that vibrates around his cock is enough to make him boneless, his whole body slumping forward. Steve slides one hand around, reaching up to press Tony back into the wall. His broad palm presses flat over Tony’s sternum, covering the mess of scars there, and Tony groans at the feeling, the sight of the tendons of Steve’s arm flexing to hold him in place even as his head bobs on Tony’s cock.
Steve’s frowning hard now. His expression is almost fierce as he studies Tony through the screen. “Tony. Do you want me to come?”
He’d wanted Steve to be here for this; nobody quite got red-blooded American patriots stuttering apologies like a glaring Captain America, and Coulson was always easier to handle with him in the room. However, a brief exchange with JARVIS had revealed that Steve had never come home the night before, and Tony had only a few minutes to be worried about that before he had to fly out to DC. It was unlike Steve to stay out all night without telling anyone, and Sam hadn’t seen him either. Steve was definitely not a one night stand man, which left Tony worrying about things that he really didn’t need to be considering the circumstances.
There’s a long pause. Collins and Cochran lock eyes for a moment, something complicated passing between them, before Cochran leans back, clearly finished. Tony knows he’s loathe to press his colleagues in public, but he’s quite the negotiator when he wants to be. He’ll have to talk Cochran around if he wants to get a handle on this thing.
“You don’t know half a rat’s shit about my past, so stop right there,” Tony snarls, then stops, closes his eyes, takes a breath. “Steve. No harm, no foul, okay? Just…get some rest, and I’ll have Maria work something out with SHIELD. Phil may cry. It’ll be beautiful.”
. His muscles aren’t just for show, or given to him by a special serum. It’s hard work to move it, even with technological assistance. But that isn’t, in fact, how tentacles work, and so he sighs and bites the bullet.
,” Steve says, but they’re cut off by the ding of the elevator. Tony makes to pull out of Steve’s arms, but Steve just tightens his grip, rearranging them so they’re more side to side than facing each other. His arm stays firm around Tony’s waist, fingers curled over the inner curve of his floating ribs. It’s more comforting than he wants to admit, and so he leans into Steve’s side, letting some of his weight tilt into the comforting warmth of his bulk.
It wasn’t until later, after Tony had slipped out of bed to head down to the workshop and Steve had woken up alone that he’d really thought about what Tony had said.
“Right,” Tony says, staring blankly at the graphs in front of him. “Uncommon duress.” Tony blinks, then focusses. “Uncommon duress. JARVIS, map this like it was…say, a sound wave.”
The tower kitchen is bustling this morning, and a cheer goes up when he comes into the room. Sam comes forward to embrace him. Clint. Bucky. Luke gives him a back-slapping hug. He finds Hank and initiates that one as a thank you, makes a note to stop by the Baxter Building with something nice for the Richards’. He lets Jarvis ply him with waffles and strawberries and heaps of butter and maple syrup. He wiggles his fingers at Danni. All around him, everyone is touching him, smiling at him.
“Sir, are you sure this is the best plan of action?” JARVIS says, sounding hesitant, and Tony cackles and splashes cold water on his face.
Tony blinks, turning to stare at Steve. “Natasha,” he says. “Why wouldn’t Natasha have said something to you?”
He couldn’t stop himself from tensing, his knees closing a little with the force of it wracking through him. His fingers scrabbled at the pillows as he moaned, and Tony wasn’t stopping, just groaning in a low rumble that skittered all the way up to Steve’s hairline. He was pressing his tongue in, his thumbs flirting with the edges of Steve’s hole, rubbing against the sensitive skin as Tony worked him over. Steve was whining with oversensitivity, but Tony ignored his squirming, his crying, because he knew Steve. He knew Steve loved it when he got rough, when he made him take it, when it felt like his body was being pushed to the limits just to satisfy Tony’s desire. Tony pushed his tongue inside, deep as it could go, and Steve sobbed into the sheets, rocking his hips back into Tony’s mouth. He didn’t know if he wanted to get closer or away.
Tony lets out a hiss, like the air escaping from a balloon. He looks a little like he does when they’re sparring and Steve lands a nasty hit too close to the arc reactor. As if to cement the comparison, Tony lifts a hand and flicks his thumb over the hard ridge of the edge, the rest of his fingers resting against the cool glass pane.
“Steve’s more sensitive than you,” Pepper sniffs. “Beth and I agreed, you’d never ask Steve out. You don’t think you’re good enough for him. Which is silly, by the way. You’re plenty good enough.”
“Hormones,” Steve agreed, his voice slurring in his mouth. His throat was sore, a tickle in the back of his throat telling him he’d overdone it. “Why…?”
“Sometime,” Tony said, and then he was reaching for Rogers’ vest, shoving it off him until it pooled on the ground.
Steve presses a slow, open-mouthed kiss to the side of Tony’s neck, hot enough to send his pulse skittering. “Liked the taste I got.”
“I meant to contain the mess,” Tony says dryly, and Steve fixes him with a look, eyes half-lidded and provocative.
Stark blinked at him, shocked, but Barton just snickered, and then Banner, and suddenly the whole team was laughing. Even Fury looked a little amused.
Mostly, Tony builds suits. A suit for everything, anything he can imagine. Suits for drilling, and suits for building, and suits for stealth and speed. He develops a remote interface that allows him to send JARVIS to help the Port Authority with damage to the Roosevelt Island Tramway while he’s 140 feet below ground, examining the structural damage to the tunnels that carry the 7 train with a collection of city engineers. Nanites, he thinks, could slip into the existing cracks and reform, bolster and weld the steel until it’s stable enough to work around. The issue is that to fix the steel tubes that make up the arteries of the city, they’ll have to break the surrounding brick and concrete and replace the whole damaged section. Tony’s not sure if the tunnels are structurally sound enough to handle that level of invasive repair. One wrong move and the whole thing could come down around them.
Usual warnings: we have another episode of ethically questionable therapy with Charles Xavier! Also panic attacks, because Tony is...so not okay right now. I'm pretty sure y'all knew that, so no surprises here. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride!
Steve beams at him. “Only by my best pal, Iron Man. Maybe you’ve heard of him?” Tony rolls his eyes in the most exaggerated way possible, if only to see Steve giggle.
“They would not be your friends if they did not meet your parameters for friendship, would they?” the professor asks, and Steve mulls that over in his head. He thinks about Tash, who is both competent and willing to sacrifice herself for the mission. Come to think of it, he isn’t sure if Natasha would ever use the phrase “greater good.” He isn’t sure if she even believes it exists. “Which brings us back to your original issue. Why does it bother you so much, that this friend made this statement? She cares about others, sometimes to a fault, you said. You think of her as a good person. But she said she doesn’t care about the greater good. What does that mean, exactly, as you understood it?”
I M S O R R Y, Steve says anyway. It makes Tony’s eyes crinkle at him, a smile lighting up his face.
“If I may,” JARVIS says. An image pops up where Steve’s face used to be. Tony turns his head, curious, and then raises his eyebrows. It’s his Pamela Hanson photoshoot.
“Yes.” He opened his legs wider, oversensitive and still he wanted it. He wanted Tony to claim him. He wanted Tony. “Bite me. Knot me. Take me-
Pepper smiles wryly at him. “Imagine what he could do if he dedicated himself to innovation full time.”
Anger flared in Steve like a wildfire at the idea of Tony being bound and gagged, in need of assistance. He wrestled it down with more effort than it probably should have warranted.
“Yes, I suppose this is my fault,” Loki agrees, pressing cold lips to his cheek. Tony shoves at him roughly, aware of the eyes that must be watching, but immediately he can feel the familiar tingling warmth of Loki’s healing rushing through him, wiping away all of the damage that has been dealt to his tired body, down to the residual bruises from Steve’s elevator outburst. Tony opens his eyes, taking in Clint’s poleaxed expression and the slight widening of Natasha’s eyes. Thor is frozen mid-gesture, mouth open in a wordless snarl, and Loki squints at him from a few inches away, hands folded behind his back.
“Touch me,” Tony pants, groaning and rocking his hips when Loki does just that. When he begins to leave a bruise right over the sensitive patch he’s found, that’s it for Tony. He slips over the edge of a shuddering orgasm, body shaking with it, spine bowing. Loki groans at the muscle contraction and strokes him through it, following not long after.
“What,” Tony says, turning back to the switchboard. It’s mostly so he can stop mooning at Steve like a fucking tween. Embarrassment creeps hot up the back of his neck.
“You’re right,” Tony says, lowering his hips down to take Loki in again. He throws his head back a little, enjoying himself. “We can do both.”
Steve blinks. “This Miyazaki guy sure has some imagination.” He takes a bite of the duck stew. It’s good; salty, and savoury, and perfect for a rainy day. “Okay.”
Tony opens his mouth, then closes it again, before finally being saved by the appearance of Bruce in the doorway. He looks rumpled, as always, and has a bandage around one hand.
“Wanna go flying?” Steve asked him, and Tony turned around with his eyes glittering bright and jewel-like in his handsome face.
“You want to leave Loki where he can piss off the other guy?” Then he shakes his head. “No, that’s the point. I’m the prison guard.”
“I…what I said wasn’t right,” Steve says, and Tony blinks heavy eyes at him, stifling a yawn. “I didn’t mean to imply…it’s none of my business, or. It wasn’t. It wasn’t any of my business how many people you were sleeping with, or have slept with, although I’d
Cap smiles, thin and mirthless. It’s the most familiar expression Tony’s seen on his face yet, which hurts a bit. He hates it when Cap gets bitter. “Because I’ll hate myself even more if I don’t try to save you.” His head turns, and he throws a hand out to catch at the elevator’s cable, twisting them around just in time to take a hit through a passing floor’s doors. It dissipates mostly without harm, but hot metal flecks splatter across his shoulders, a punishment he takes without comment.
. Completely lose his temper in the helicarrier lab (part 2) which was probably because he’d managed to figure out that Tony wasn’t impressed with him and the alpha in him couldn’t bear the thought.
Reed hums. He flicks something on his screen over to Tony’s. “I’m making an observation.” He reaches over to Tony’s screen, enlarges a graph. “Look at this.”
“Steve, what are you doing?” Pepper murmured under her breath, a serene publicity smile painting itself over her face. “You’ve always refused to… do the raffle.”
“I love you. I could never hurt you intentionally. Or.” Steve stops, grimacing, because they both know that isn’t necessarily always true. “When I’m in control, I wouldn’t. And I’ll try. I’ll try not to get so mad.”
Steve thinks about telling Tony to come with him, but then he can imagine it; Tony’s eyes crinkled in laughter, the heavy boughs of the cherry trees laden with pink blossoms, and all around the sweet smell of burgeoning heat as they move through the grass together. There would be talk, from some employee who had bills to pay or mouths to feed, which Steve has long learned not to be angry for. There might even be a photo.
Tony shrugs. He hadn’t really been thinking about it, honestly, which is probably a bad sign. It means he trusts Loki to take care of him. The elevator doors open, and Tony follows Bruce into the lab, Bruce’s nervousness increasing as he walks up to one of the glass screens. He turns around and folds his arms across his chest.
When he was little, and his father was a particular flavour of merry-tipsy, he would tell him stories about the war; Captain America, his greatest creation. Of course, now Tony knows what a crock of shit that was. If anyone created Captain America, it was Erskine, but more importantly, Steve created himself. The existence of The Hulk and The Red Skull would suggest that Steve was the magic sauce, the catalyst that crafted the man. Still, he thinks he understands Loki, a little; the prodigal son, the desire to prove his worth, the violence and the rage. Tony remembers what it was like to blast out of his cage, to reign destruction upon the worthy. He remembers what it felt like to blow up the enemy with the biggest and best bomb on the market. A Stark, of all men, knows what it is to love destruction. It is what they cut their teeth on: blood and metal.
Steve is watching him, that observant gaze that has been the death of Tony’s posturing more than once sending his pulse skittering.
“Tony, listen for just a minute.” Bruce pulls off his glasses, cleaning them in the hem of his shirt. He puts them on and folds his arms over his chest. “Do you understand the difference between you telling me that I’d like it here and you can keep me safe, and you asking me to stay because you
“This is bullshit, Tony,” Peter pleads. His eyes are wide and beseeching even through the mask. Ever the romantic, Steve knows. He can recognise a kindred soul. They both want, so badly, for the happily ever after ending.
“Stark, you and your allies are weak, your armour damaged. I have seen Moonstone cut through steel with a single bolt. You should take the time to rest and regroup, and strike before dawn while their soldiers sleep. Your captain is strong; he can endure a little pain while you ensure your victory.”
“That’s no excuse,” Steve says, and Tony’s head snaps up to look at him. His eyes are focussed, gleaming with curiosity, and Steve finds himself blushing for no good reason other than that Tony’s looking at him. “We had, uh.” He clears his throat. “Gay people? Back in my day. Howard had the power to create and change the future. Just like you.”
“Scout’s honour!” Tony calls, already drawing up schematics and consulting with Grace about some minor software concerns. “What if we can get the lights to blink in tandem with speakers?”
The ocean was cold even in summer. Steve always seemed to forget about that until he got in the water, and the Pacific was particularly freezing. Tony had spent the morning teaching him how to surf, putting on this skin-tight wetsuit that made Steve want to roll over and beg. Of course, he had to wear one too, and Tony had looked at him like he wanted to devour him, so maybe that was alright.
, well. It’s more like she could alter reality. That’s how she was able to heal people by just recreating flesh out of nothing.”
“Let me do it,” he grouses, and Tony laughs. He leans over and ruffles Bruce’s hair. Slowly, they settle, until Tony’s leaning half into Bruce’s side. Bruce is warm, and softer than he looks. He smells like fresh homemade caramel.
He lowers Tony in gently. The water is cooler than he usually likes his baths, but it’s certainly not unpleasant. A sigh of relief escapes him as he settles, the faint itching that had been spreading over his skin disappearing almost immediately. He leans back with a decadent sigh, eyes closed, sinking down until the water is up to his neck.
With the benefit of hindsight, Steve can now say that is the true horror of how the Civil War had happened between them. For the second time in his life, Steve hadn’t been willing to listen. He’d put his foot down. The first time he’d done it, he’d almost lost Tony down a bottle, and to this day he still regrets giving up so easily. Images of his own father drunk and angry had crawled up out of his past like a monster, blinding him. He’d left Tony alone in that horrible place. He’d let him end up on the streets.
Steve shivers and coughs and watches his mother die in a hospital bed, in their tiny shared flat, in his arms, in the Barnes’ living room, in an alleyway. This, he has seen in his dreams too many times for it to cut him deeply. Eventually, his torturer learns, and he does not see his mother at all.
Sometimes, you want something for so long it becomes abstract. It’s something you stare at through a shop window, desperate and hungry and knowing you can never have it. It would be easy to think that Tony’s lived too rich of a life to know that feeling, but Steve knows better. He knows that Tony spent most of his life that way: desperate for the life that he saw other families have, on television and all around him, and never ever getting the love and affection that all children expect by right. It’s funny sometimes, the dichotomy of that: Steve so, so loved and too poor to buy shoes; and Tony, so lonely and yet surrounded by all the things money could buy. Other times, it makes Steve wonder what it is that kept Tony good, what it is that separates him from all of the terrible, hurt, powerful men they go out and fight week after week. There is something inside Tony that is, just as he claims, made of iron: strong and unbreakable and absolutely true. Modest, even. It is the source of the driving hunger that lives inside of his brilliant, untameable mind. It is the fact that Tony is at his happiest two days into no sleep, smeared up and down with grease and sweat, deep into his engineering mania. There is no purer form to him that that central, unchangeable essence of him. Everything else—the clothes, and the cars, and the models, and the parties—all of it was a smokescreen that hid this man, fragile and aching for someone to see him. Really, truly see him.
“Yeah,” Tony says, loosing a wild laugh. “Shit, that could have gone so poorly for you. For both of us, really, but-”
“People see what they want to see in the people around them,” Tony says. It’s quiet, just enough for Peter and Steve to hear him. “Steve always saw the best in people.”
“Great,” Tony says, clapping his hands together. “Here’s what we’re gonna do. Fill up my schedule. And I mean really fill it. Everything Pepper’s been desperate to get me to do, for the next two weeks, just fill it right up. Routine factory inspection in Bangladesh? Let’s go. Glad-handing for the Maria Stark foundation? Sounds fun. Can’t obey what I’m not around to hear.”
Tony turned, keeping one arm wrapped firmly around Steve’s waist, a warm hand pressed low on his stomach. “Well seeing as this is my tower Chicken Little, every damn room in the building is my room, so-“
He makes easy small talk with Evan on the ride back to the tower. He’s only 22, which is sobering considering his rank. Steve isn’t sure how long it takes to become a Senior Airman these days, but it’s probably long enough that Evan joined up right out of high school. He knows, of course, that sometimes the military is still the only avenue for social mobility a young person who comes from nothing’s got. But it’s frustrating, how little the state of social welfare has progressed since he went into the ice. He’d hoped for so many things from the future when he was young, and flying cars was the least of them. Sometimes, on his worst days, Steve thinks that not even a single thing from the future meets his expectations.
“Everything,” Steve gasps. He squirms helplessly in Tony’s grip, eyes fluttering as he tries to meet Tony’s gaze in the mirror. A particularly vicious twist of his hectocotylus ensures that he’s not quite able to, his eyes squeezing shut in pleasure. “
“And you,” he says, pointing a finger at Erik Selvig, “wait until I tell Thor about this. You’ll be hearing about dishonour and betrayal for the rest of your mortal life.”
Steve does a circuit of the lab. He pokes at things, although he isn’t able to move anything in particular. He peeks his head inside of some things, then circles back to Tony’s body. He wonders if he should try to sleep himself.
Through a foot of Stark-patented ballistic glass, Steve could see Tony moving around inside the Tank. He was pacing, speaking to himself, although Steve couldn’t hear the words. Inside, there were a few sparse furnishings; a bed, a couch, a chair. Everything in the room was padded with something that helped to absorb and dullen impact, but Steve had been inside out of curiosity and felt it made the whole room seem kind of like a kid’s gym, where everything was soft. Tony had been left with a StarkPad and a chess set, the latter Steve guessed left from Bruce’s visits, the former a recent addition to keep Tony from going crazy. He looked exhausted, and beat-up, and so, so beautiful.
Carol’s face wipes clean. Her nostrils flare, hands reaching out, as though she can stop Tony from imploding before her eyes. ”What?”
“Once more unto the breach,” Tony intones humourlessly, and Steve prays for patience. He’s never had much of it, and talking to God has never gotten him much in the way of the answer he wants, but it’s all he has to offer. He prays that whatever he has to give is enough to fix this thing that’s crackling between them, to be the glue that keeps his sanity intact.
“You didn’t notice him getting into bed?” Pepper asks archly, and Tony absolutely does not have enough of his bearing to process this situation.
“Ohmygod,” Tony is saying, keeps saying, because he’s never been with someone who could do this to him. He’s been fucked against the wall before, sure, but Steve’s got Tony’s thighs over his shoulders and is holding him six feet up the wall like it’s nothing. Tony’s ankles are still trapped by his jeans pooled above his sneakers. His wrists are tied, and he is absolutely at Steve’s mercy. Who knew Captain America was such a kinky motherfucker?
Steve takes a breath, considering. “I guess I just think that being a good person means caring about other people,” he says mulishly.
“Pretty omega slut. You’re fucking dripping,” Tony hissed, his breath coasting over Steve’s back, and Steve spread his knees wider. “Oh, honey, I know exactly how flexible you are. I need you up a bit more.”
“Alpha?” he shouted, spinning around. He took out another two soldiers with his shield, eyes searching frantically for a camera, something. He stopped when he found a CCTV camera in one corner, staring up into it with what he knew was quiet desperation. “Tony?”
“Not afraid,” Steve said, and that at least wasn’t a lie. “It’s just what I know, and how to prepare for all eventualities, just like we always do. If you all do as I ask, there’s nothing for me to be afraid of. Except maybe for if Tony’s gonna blow himself up trying to get out of this mess.”
Tony doesn’t know what to say to that, but he relaxes a little when Loki’s mouth drifts down further, tongue dipping into his navel and making him squirm ticklish. He can feel the smile against his hip before he bites, and Tony hisses, pushing up into it when Loki soothes the pain with his tongue. He drags his mouth down, licking the crease of Tony’s thigh and making him squirm, sucking hot kisses against his inner thigh. Tony digs his fingers into Loki’s hair.
“I’ll bring you back,” Tony says. It is both attestation and prayer. “I’ll fix this, Steve, I promise you.”
Steve goes over to him, bumps his shoulder through his friend’s. “Ah, come on, Shellhead,” he says. His voice wavers, echoing against the sterile metal walls. “You know it’s probably temporary.”
“Stay,” Steve said again, his hand slipping lower, and Tony closed his eyes and arched languidly into his touch. “Tony.”
Tony’s never seen Steve cry before. He’s watched all of his old film reels. He’s been living with him for months now. But he supposes he found Steve Rogers’ breaking point, finally. He should be proud. He’s broken Captain America, where so many others have failed.
Tony glances down at him, amusement creeping over his mouth, twisting it into a wicked curve. “Sure about that, Cap?” His thighs tighten around Steve’s waist, reminding Steve of the predicament he’s in.
Steve’s looking at him with a kind of vulnerable expression when he glances up, and Tony can’t help but look away. Embarrassment curls into his stomach, heats his cheeks. He’s glad he doesn’t blush like Steve does.
“Let me finish this, and then we’ll see,” he says. He turns back to the tablet, wrapping a hand over his mouth. He doesn’t get far before his phone begins to buzz in his pocket.
"Sure you are,” Tony says, and holds his breath as Steve leans down closer, enough that he can feel his breath on his face.
Tony steps out as the lights begin to dim, the familiar tables and machines of the workshop changing into strange, hulking shapes and low lights. He thinks about magic, and creation, and Pygmalion. Then he follows Thor up the stairs.
“Because I think you’re really drunk, and you’re probably going to regret this when you’re sober again.”
No alpha had ever looked twice at Steve, before the serum. The sick scent on him had been pungent, enough that the smell of him during the height of a fever had set other folks on edge. Who wanted an omega that was too ill to breed? Then, after the serum, hardly anyone knew Steve was an omega, and the military had been keen on keeping it that way.
Steve considers this. “Yeah,” he says, tiredly. “Yeah, set it up. If I hate it I can always see a regular doctor, right?”
Tony closes his eyes, letting her fuss over him. For a half second, Pepper loves him and Steve is disappointed that he isn’t Howard. Everything is simple. He does not yet care for the intricacies and politics of Norse gods. Steve tells him to put on the suit, and he wants nothing more than to break his perfect teeth. He wants to see that golden hair smeared with blood.
Steve intentionally fumbled one of the servers, making the closest SHIELD agent scramble forward to get underneath it. She glared at him when she pulled it out of his arms, and Steve shot the nearest security camera a jaunty little grin.
“What do you mean?” Tony asks, turning back to fully face Thor, but the man isn’t looking at him. His striking features are set in profile, a few strands of hair coming loose from his bun as he nods his chin at the television.
“Steve?” Tony murmurs, when the silence has become loud enough that it rings in the room like a singing bowl.
The professor smiles, taking a sip of his tea. “My opinion doesn’t matter in this, Captain. What matters is that this upsets you. Why do you think that is?”
Steve had been in a monomanic quest to find Barnes for months after the Potomac Crash, until eventually Sam convinced him that if Barnes didn’t want to be found then maybe they should let him go. They found evidence of him at libraries, looking up information on the Commandos and Steve and himself. He was clearly on a quest of self-discovery, and Sam had reasoned that he would come in when he was ready. That didn’t mean that Steve and Nat didn’t jump into the quinjet whenever they got a reliable tip, but he wasn’t out chasing ghosts every spare minute the way he’d been after the crash. Tony was glad of it, because that had been unhealthy, but this behaviour just didn’t make any sense.
Because Bruce, too, had tried to make himself better. He’d tried to turn his great and terrible privilege of a mind onto a cure for all mankind, and instead he walked out a monster. He knows what it is to make yourself into a sword and find that there are only sharp edges left, and no guard: dangerous things, who only know how to let the blood of the ones they love.
“Ouch,” Beth says, laughing. “Where’s your Saint Patty’s Day spirit, Cap? We’re both Irish. Tony’s the interloper.”
“Steve,” Tony says, and for a moment, everything is crystal clear. Steve’s eyelashes are wet, dark gleaming bronze around the azure of his irises. He looks hopeful, all-Americana sweet and beautiful in Tony’s arms. He looks like everything Tony’s ever wanted for years. “I could never be done with you.”
“Did you absorb Cosmo?” Tony snorts, squinting at the nearest security camera. “Vanity Fair? Seventeen, maybe?”
“Rhodey, a little help,” he calls, and holds his hands up for Rhodey to pull him out of the mud in a flyover, but the woman in white shoots them down, and they tumble into a heap with a loud clatter. Amora glances around the battlefield, then off into the distance. Barnes pushes himself to his feet. The enhanced drags herself up from the ground, wiping dirt from her eyes.
. Completely lose his temper in the helicarrier lab (part 1) which, in retrospect, was because Tony was flirting with Bruce and Steve couldn’t stand to look at them getting along when Tony couldn’t even meet his eye.
T O M O R R O W, he insists, but Tony is the same, dogged mad man he’s always loved. It’s a treat, in some ways, to see him like this again. But right now Steve mostly just wants to take him to bed. T O N Y.
“God, you have a migraine, don’t you?” Steve asks. His fingers skitter over Tony’s hipbones, the bluish glow of the nano-housing in his chest lending a strange, pallid cast to his angular face.
“I was the catalyst. And now he’s coming after you.” Her façade of calm is beginning to crack now, voice slipping into high panic, and Tony reaches out and catches her shaking hands.
In the years to come, Tony will look back on this day as one of the greatest moments of his life, and not just because of the joy of seeing Steve Rogers in coveralls and a pageboy hat, smiling out at New York City’s green-felted and flag-waving denizens like he was the patron saint of adorable Irish construction workers. No, what he’ll remember forever is the dour face of Stephen Strange, legs crossed, floating petulantly behind Tony’s booth as he wrangles the lights, the music, the colours of the Irish flag flashing up onto the Empire State building’s façade at opportune moments. Stephen’s cloak floats out behind him in a rippling wave, his arms crossed as he glares down at the crowds. He’s not wearing a single stitch of green, and Tony loves him fiercely for being a giant red stain on the drunken Saint Patrick’s Day cheer emanating from the sozzled masses.
Steve closes his eyes, and when he opens them, he is back in Xavier’s office. He feels worn down, suddenly, exhausted in a way that’s so far beyond his body. He wants to go home and curl up with Tony on the couch and watch a movie, feel Tony watching him and grinning at his reactions all the while.
“Perhaps Mr. Odinson will have some advice for you on how to cure the spell, or someone else you might consult,” JARVIS says stubbornly. “I understand your hesitance to speak to someone you are not allied with, but this has gone on for weeks now, sir. It is affecting your relationship with Captain Rogers and the rest of the team, as well as your overall health. Your attempts to avoid him by virtue of being too busy to spend time together is forcing you to overwork yourself. You are exhibiting signs of stress and exhaustion.”
“Nothing,” Steve says quickly, taking another sip of whiskey. God, this is the good stuff. “Anyway, that…I’m, uh, staying in my lane?”
Tony didn’t think Steve would want to touch him like this, and he’s briefly overwhelmed. The kiss is mostly chaste, warm and sweet, and it’s over before Tony can manage to do anything fancy. Steve doesn’t seem to mind. Instead he just grins wider, his eyes crinkling at the corners in that way that makes Tony want to kiss them.
A single moth flutters through the shaft of sunlight that streams through the high window. It paints a large moon of light on the carpet in the centre of the room, and the moth cutting through it makes a menacing shape on the ground, big as a bat, or a bird.
"I'd like to consider myself a student of Joaquín Sorolla, actually," Steve says, mildly. "His use of colour and light is fantastic. I've been trying to work with pastels more, lately, and I've found his work real inspiring. Michelangelo's figures are too…exaggerated, for my tastes. I'm more interested in luminism."
“I’m always putting my foot in my mouth,” Tony murmurs, and Steve barks out a rough laugh. “You and me both. We’re like millipedes made of left feet. And regret. And UST.”
As it is, all he wants to do is put his mouth to Tony’s. He wants to ask him why he waited all this time. He wants to shake him. He wants to take him apart with his teeth.
Tony frowns. He pulls up out of his backwards bend, and the thin tank top he’s wearing does nothing to disguise the muscle underneath. Steve has never wanted to touch someone so much in his life.
Tony barks out a laugh, fingers skimming over the tablet as he puts the footage into four splitscreens at 1.5x. In one, Amora turns soldier against solider, rows of men and women fighting each other.
Tony doesn’t want to do it. He doesn’t mean to. But under Steve’s hands, his body lights up like fucking Dyker Heights in Christmastime. It bathes Steve’s lovely, unblemished skin in warm light. It suffuses the faint flush of pleasure that comes to his cheeks in gold, burnishes him like a bronze sculpture. He looks positively angelic.
“Exactly,” he said, and it felt like coming home. Steve closed his eyes, and inhaled, and desperately wished for Tony’s hormone injections to hurry the fuck up. He wanted his alpha. He wanted to be held, and hold him in return.
Tony’s startled into his own quiet puff of laughter. The sound of it makes Steve ache. “All of it,” he says, tilting his head up a little to grin at Steve from under the fringe of his hair. It’s such a lovely look on him that Steve can’t manage to breathe, and he doesn’t know what his face does, but whatever it is makes Tony turn back to his work, the smile falling from his face. He sighs. “He asked if I’d been pretending, with all the omega and beta women I’d been with. I said no.”
The man shoots Tony in the chest, and the bullet ricochets off the arc reactor and into Tony’s arm. He screams weakly, voice hoarse, already resigned to his fate.
“Soon,” Steve murmured. He closed his eyes, listened to the steady sound of Tony’s breathing. “Alpha?”
“I never meant to hurt him,” Steve says, but it sounds hollow even to his own ears. Pepper’s disappointed expression is both expected and stinging, and Steve isn’t surprised when she turns to leave.
Tony huffs, folding his arms across his chest. “If you can tell me, honestly, that telling one of the team won’t get me benched…”
“I know it.” He bats his eyelashes at Rhodey, then turns back to the table. “I’ve got some stuff to take care of, you’ve all got stuff to take care of, everybody chop chop.”
Tony reaches out, throwing a pillow with unerring accuracy to thwap Steve in the back of his stupidly gorgeous blonde head.
“I have accelerated healing, and only do that when absolutely necessary in combat,” Steve snapped, an old argument. Tony’s delighted laughter was the only response he could hear, and he turned back to see Tony completing a barrel roll, arms spread out wide. He soared up, up, higher than Steve could see with the glare of the sun, and then he fell backwards with the kind of unmistakable joy that could only be called a giggle.
“Er,” she says. She straightens, takes a deep breath. “If you can hear me, Captain America, sir, I’ve set the monitor up so you can keep abreast of Iron Man’s mission.”
Tony is sure Steve can feel his pulse against his fingers, heavy as hoofbeats on the Belmont racetrack. He turns his head, and meets Steve’s eyes for the first time since he walked out onto the landing pad. Steve’s fingers tighten around his wrist, and for a breathless moment, it feels as though they’re falling.
Tony nods and faces the sink, swiping a hand over the mirror to clear it. He stares at his face, then reaches for his toothbrush. “Just another day in this old bag of bones.”
“I didn’t say that,” Beth says, voice mild, almost sing-song. “I’m just trying to understand what it means.”
Steve opens his mouth, face flushing with anger, only for Natasha to clock him hard in the head with a roundhouse kick, followed by the butt of her .45. Tony gapes at her as Steve stumbles sideways, face slack with shock and the pain as he nearly goes down. Tony catches him under the arms.
Anyway, sorry about that! As always, dunno when the next update will be, but I've got this long ass chapter for you. Hopefully it's worth the wait.
about?” Steve says, taking a whole step back. His hands fall to his sides, fists clenching, and Tony freezes. His heart hammers in his chest, and Steve takes one look at his face and crumples a little. He flexes his fingers, trying to keep them straight.
Steve nods, slipping into stiff military attention the way he always does when he’s nursing a hurt. Then he turns and heads back up the stairs towards the elevator, tension strung across his broad shoulders.
“Why? You wanna watch past you beat himself up over Steve’s last death while current you beats yourself up over this one?”
“You wouldn’t have even been there if Loki didn’t ask you to be,” Tony says, and Thor closes his eyes and lets out a heavy breath. “Loki wanted him dead, and so you killed him.”
He thinks, briefly, of the argument that he and Cap would likely be having if it were someone else who had been taken. He thinks of the way that Cap bites his lip when he erases something he doesn’t like, the mountainous planes of him hunched over acid free paper. He thinks of the way he gestures in battle, direct and two fingered, body strung with potential energy where Tony is kinetic, chaotic, tumbling. Rivers carve mountains, Tony knows. They cut into them, form valleys and cliffs.
, his ma used to say. He feels cold, and he clutches tighter at Tony’s shaking body. Tony fists his hands in the back of Steve’s shirt, and for a few quaking breaths they just hold each other. Steve presses his temple to Tony’s, concentrating on slowing his breathing, on having Tony match him until they’re both a little steadier. He tilts his head to press another kiss to Tony’s brow.
,” he breathes. He can’t believe this. “That was, what, a five day turnaround? What the hell did that asshole do, JARVIS? They made the decision on Friday, and it’s Wednesday at 2 fucking PM. What the hell could he have done to get an FBI investigation started in, what, three business days?”
The gentleness in his tone makes Tony’s chest ache fiercely. He wants nothing more than to curl up in JARVIS’ metaphorical arms and sleep until all of this is over.
Tony just breathes for a moment, thinking. “Not really,” he admits. “But not all of us have perfect recall, Steve.”
“Sorry,” Steve says, muscles locking up, and Tony keeps his thighs tight around Steve’s waist. “I- I’m sorry.” That familiar blotchy blush begins to spread down his neck. “I…is this okay?”
“Sir is in the workshop. He has not eaten anything solid since Wednesday night, before the mission.”
“I signed up to be an Avenger, and this isn’t even the weirdest thing I’ve seen,” Steve says with good enough humour. He peels his gloves off one by one and leaves them on a worktop. “Anyway, it’s not like you asked for this.”
Steve grins, tugging Tony across the street. Tony lets himself be led, watching Steve with an indulgent expression. Steve stops under the big tree that overhangs the park, and points up.
This one, this man, for the rest of their ridiculous lives. And he wasn’t going to ask for a private moment, because he wasn’t ashamed. He wanted a public declaration. He wanted to write it above the city in clouds. This way, there was nowhere for Tony to run, or backtrack, or ever feel like he wasn’t wanted. This way, Tony would know always.
Tony groans softly at the images that assail him, and the laugh that Steve favours him with is knowing, delighted. “You’re a fucking menace.”
Tony swallows. Steve’s eyes are so deep in the fading light of day. Like looking down into the Pacific, the waves rocking him in their white-capped embrace. Steve was like that—something so strong it was undeniable, a force of nature wrapped up in wheat-gold hair and his damnable clotted-cream Irish skin that freckled briefly under too much sun.
“This isn’t The Red Room, Nat! This isn’t spycraft! We’re the Avengers, we don’t run shit like that anymore-”
Steve glances around at the cubicles and scattered desks in the small area he’s in. There are a handful of fans around the place, and everything is pinned down with staplers or cups of pens or, rarely, actual paperweights. Somewhere warm, then. He glances over what things are out, and his eyebrows raise as he chances upon an unopened letter left in a mail bin on someone’s desk.
Steve had no idea that was how Tony experienced it. That’s fascinating. Why is the sensation so different for him? Does it have anything to do with Steve sometimes feeling like he’s feeling what Tony is feeling?
Tony was many things, but practically dressed was generally not one of those things. His wardrobe was best suited for indoor society functions, and he hadn’t had much occasion to buy anything different in Timely. He barely left his forge, except to go to Casino, the rail station for a shipment, or the jailhouse. Proper winter gear had not ever been high on his list of priorities, and he was now regretting it. He couldn’t spare anything more for Rogers, not if he wanted to keep warm enough to get them both home in one piece.
“Is that for me?” Steve asks, a particular smile breaking over his face. It’s a smile Tony suspects he’s the only one who’s ever seen, and he’s quite glad because if anyone else knew that Steve could be this wicked-
. That he’s trying to be more…modern, or radical, or whatever. He thinks maybe Tony would want to hear what he’s learning. And then, maybe, when Tony trusts him not to be such a brute, they could talk about what kind of relationship Tony wants them to have. And maybe, next time Tony has a…a heat…
“If I recall, you already had your dessert,” Tony says, and he can feel the rumble of Cap’s laughter move through him from where they’re pressed back to chest. “Twice.”
“What the hell is he talking about, destroy the pack bonds?” Clint demanded, anger disguising what was clearly fear. Steve would bet money he’d be able to smell it if not for the scent blockers he and Natasha always wore.
“We bonded,” Steve said, and now that he was looking for it he could feel it. He could sense Tony in a way he hadn’t been able to before. It was like all of Tony’s body was calling to him, and Steve wanted nothing more than to cant his body into Tony, to surrender beneath him, to him, around him. He felt like something had slipped inside and filled a gaping maw of a hole he hadn’t even realised was empty and aching. He felt so full. Whole. He’d never felt that way, before.
“Still exhausted,” Steve admitted, yawning again. He stretched his arms over his head, pointing his toes. He was putting on a show as much as he was actually stretching, and Tony eyed him with gratifying heat. The look he offered Steve was wry. “Not ready to share you yet.”
He’d never taken himself for the kind of man that held biases inside of him, deep down, lurking like a monster in the deep of his soul. He feels unclean, suddenly. He wants to wash himself clean.
Steve worries at his lip, then types one last query into the computer. A slow, wry smile breaks over his face.
“Tony,” Pepper says evenly, “why are you here flirting with the head of the Amateur Astrologers’ Association and not holed up in your workshop or buried in some horrifying biotech project with Peter?”
“Tony,” Steve said, stepping forward. He grabbed one of Tony’s waving hands, pressing his fingers to the scarred knuckles. He waited until Tony stilled, met his eyes. “You’re the strongest person I know.”
He takes one last look at the city. Millions of people, all alive and Bonded and breathing. People he’d sacrificed his life for. It wasn’t enough, apparently, but he’d do it again.
“Should I be worried?” he asks, pulling the fridge open. “You’ve confessed your weakness, Ms. Potts.”
A pale, towheaded boy sticks head out from around the shadowed doorway. He blinks big blue eyes at Steve, dressed head to toe in pyjamas with cowboys and rearing horses printed all over his little body. He’s wearing spaceship socks and clutching a large plush cowboy that Steve recognises from a children’s film about talking toys.
There’s a pointed silence in the room, and Tony exhales sharply and moves his arm, scrubbing both hands over his face.
Steve glances up from the Times, smiling reflexively at the sight of Tony leaning against the door jamb. His arms are folded across his chest, a crisp red shirt rolled up to the elbows. A black tie sits loose around his collar, the top buttons undone to reveal the soft V of his collarbones. He looks mischievous, and beautiful, and Steve takes a sip of his apple juice to forestall a flush at the brunt of Tony’s affection and attention beaming down on Steve from on high.
The priest sighs. “Lord, what evils have been wrought in Your name,” he murmurs. “Scatter the nations who delight in war.”
over that kiss. What if he hadn’t had feelings for Steve? Sure, everything worked out this time, but this is-
Tony chuckles. “Yeah, well. He was furious. We fought. It got a little physical.” He shrugs, an elegant movement of his shoulders that lets Steve see some of the lovely lines of his back bunch and shift. Steve wants so many impossible, stupid things. “That was a few weeks before he died.”
Steve inhaled slowly, fingers clenching in the workshop hoodie bundled in his lap. He’d barely been without it in the last week, a last attempt to mitigate the bond-sickness. Nausea overtook him at the worst moments, dizziness, blinding panic, lust, and fury in turns. He’d benched himself from missions and called Rhodes and Sam in to cover for himself and Tony while they waited for Tony to get better. Rhodes had gotten leave from the Air Force, and he’d been more than happy to be in the tower where he could keep an eye on Tony during his recovery. Steve wondered what he thought of being kept in the dark; he hadn’t known that Rhodes was unaware of Tony’s biological sex.
Beth’s always been observant and stubborn, though. If she wasn’t, she wouldn’t have been able to drag Tony out of the bottle, kicking and screaming the whole way. As inconvenient as it makes his life sometimes, Tony will always love her for that, sure as the way he loves Pep or Rhodey or Happy. It’s why he hired her for Avengers’ security in the first place.
“Since the invasion of the dark elves upon Midgard, my father had been strengthening his alliances with the rest of the nine realms. He has encouraged increased trade, and travel between realms. He set up an exchange of scholars, that there might be shared information and increased learning among not only our people but that of our allies, which has allowed us to repair the bifrost with more speed than we might have without. Jane and Erik Selvig were a great part of that. He had become a diplomat, of sorts, which had always been my mother and Loki’s realm much more than his. I thought perhaps our mother’s death had changed him.”
“Great.” Tony does a quick scan of the room, but turns up nothing. No heat signatures, no radiation, nothing aside from the cot in the middle of the room. “Any word on Melter?”
"My apologies," Loki says. It sounds like he's laughing, the asshole. "They didn't get what they came for."
“Actually, I think I’ll walk,” Tony says, and Stephen nods. He turns back to his pile of books, slipping the next one in between its companions. “See you ‘round, Sparkles.”
He imagined Captain America would be firm with him. (Hah.) A strong, but silent kind of man, gentle until he wasn’t. He’d never force Tony, no, never ask him for more than he knew how to give, never want what Tony didn’t want. He’d tried to imagine him as forceful, all that muscle pressing up on him, pressing into him, but somehow he never quite could do it. Captain America would be smooth, and a little sly, he’d thought. He’d be handsome, and kind, and perfect.
“Yeah, I’m sure that’s exactly what he said,” Steve mutters, snapping the top off and sniffing it. “As long as it’s not French cow brain this time.”
“Loki being Odin, Loki wanting to…something, Loki hitting on me…” Tony hesitates, fingers strung between a biometrics and radiation side-by-side. “Cap, being all…Cap.”
“SHIELD knows,” Tony said dismissively, waving a hand. “I have so much dirt on them I could bury them six times over. I’ve got a lot less to lose.”
Steve shakes his head. There are so many things he wants to say. He wraps a hand around Tony’s wrist where he’s cupped Steve’s face, presses his thumb to the veins and wishes he could feel enough to count his pulse.
As always, thank you thank you thank you to my diehard commenters/followers. I read over your comments when I feel like shit and they help a lot. I dunno that I'd keep writing without you. Please let me know what you think! Your feedback means a lot.
They’d gotten dinner at Jack’s Wife Frieda, then cannoli at Pasticceria Rocco. Tony had long held that they were the best in the city, and Steve couldn’t disagree. Their server, bless him, had taken one look at the two of them and set them up in the back, around the corner and up against the brick wall. It was a table well away from the prying eyes of the rest of the customers. There, Tony could speak freely about the recent upgrades to the armour, about MJ’s most recent photoshoot with Vogue Italia, about the new rollout of the StarkPads that was set for next week but the specs were driving him crazy. He looked so happy, and Steve had grinned and let him talk himself out, sipping at his coffee and demolishing an entire plate of cream puffs, one delicious, buttery-sweet bite after another.
“Tony?” he says. He leans back, eyes darting across Tony’s face as Tony brushes the tears out of his lashes. He watches Tony stitch himself back together. “Tony, can you hear me?”
When Tony finally told Pepper that he’d built holding cells in the bowels of the tower, Pepper had been absolutely livid.
So I know this was only supposed to have five chapters, but there's a whole two more sections after this and it's already almost 10k. It seemed silly to put it all in one, so I've broken it into two.
“It’s the truth, Ross. If the American government tries to hobble Captain America, he’ll leave, and that’ll be a damn shame for everybody, because nobody loves this country better than him.” Coulson is smiling, just the barest twinkle in his eye. Tony spares him a smirk.
“Too lazy,” Tony mumbles, the second half of his sentence slurred by a yawn, and Steve laughs softly in his ear.
“I know that Loki’s sort of less-evil right now,” Tony says, “but I seriously don’t trust him to undo a mind-control spell on me.”
“You surprised me!” Tony says, one hand cutting through the air. “It was just a fucking kiss, Steve, and in case you forgot I was climbing you like a tree, clearly I wasn’t fighting you-”
“An omega told me once I smelled like blood,” Tony said, a pained twist to his mouth. Steve swallowed and squeezed his shoulder.
Still, as he watches Loki meet Natasha blow for blow, nearly pinning her twice, he decides that the biggest difference was that Loki was just that much smarter than his brother. Those flashes of knowledge suggested something so profoundly ageless that it was beyond human ken, even for someone like Tony. Sure, Tony was a genius, but no matter how quick he was, nothing could really compensate for thousands of years of experience. So while Thor was strong enough to knock any human out with a single OP blow to the head, it was Loki’s bladework and swift, economical movements that truly betrayed his inhumanity. He seemed to know Natasha’s moves even before she could make them. It wasn’t until Loki had won two sparring sessions, however, that Tony realised that he was
Tony does not answer. Instead, Steve can see the blurry outline of his body reach for the shampoo. He begins to wash himself, slowly, as though he’s in pain. He probably is, Steve realises. He hasn’t slept much in the past weeks, and that was when Steve was around to watch him. He’s sure Tony wasn’t perfectly rested when they’d gone out together.
“Let’s move this to the bedroom,” he says, and Steve’s eyes light up in his face. “You mentioned something about dessert?”
Folding himself down into the static inside his own mind is easier every time. He closes his eyes and lets himself drift, riding the sparkling current like he’s blazing down the highway on a motorcycle, so fast the land flying by him blurs together. When he comes to, sleepy and disoriented, he finds himself in the middle of a standoff. On one side, Strange floats, arms folded across his chest, mouth twisted into a moue. On the other, Tony stands in that way he has when he knows he is going to lose but refuses to fold, his shoulders broad and proud. Between them is Spiderman, leaning aggressively into Strange’s space.
Clean up goes smoothly, and they turn over twenty-six Hydra agents to SHIELD for interrogation. Tony dreads the debrief, but this time he isn't injured enough to get out of it. He knows Coulson won't let him get off that easy.
“Steve, I’m alright,” Tony says, turning around and pulling his shirt over his head. He glances over his shoulder. Steve’s face is sallow, all the blood gone. He’s staring between his bloody fingers and Tony’s spine like he can’t quite believe what he’s seeing. “Amora hit me, the plating pierced my shoulder. It hurts like a bitch but it’s nothing that can’t be fixed. Okay? But the faster you come with me, the faster we can get home and I can get all patched up. So let’s go home, okay?”
What he knew for sure was this: omegas were stronger than anyone gave them credit for, and supposedly felt pain more than anyone else did, and he didn’t know if he was the kind of omega who was strong enough to weather this kind of pain.
“You should,” Pepper says, folding her hands together across her desk. “You know, a lot of people have a fundamental misconception of Tony and I’s relationship.”
“Nope,” he replies, and walks out of the room towards the elevator. “But that’s never stopped me before.”
“If you can watch the movie like that,” he answers, proud of himself for how even his voice is. Tony considers this, eyes dark, before twisting his body around. He sits down with his legs across Steve’s lap, his back against the arm of the couch. His eyes are bright with triumph, and Steve wants so badly to kiss him again. He settles for wrapping one hand around Tony’s outer hip, fingers pressing tight into Tony’s skin.
"I hate to break up the love fest, but can we talk about the Loki thing?" Clint says, impatient. "Also, I'm out of rappelling arrows and I could use a lift."
Afterwards, Steve lies on his back in Tony’s bed for a long time. He watches the light change in the room. He leans down and presses soft kisses to Tony’s chest, traces his damnable obliques with his tongue. He curses when he loses his ability to touch halfway through mapping Tony’s ribs, regains it again when he manages to hook Tony’s thighs over his shoulders. Tony is half-awake, beautiful in dreams. His eyes flutter open and shut, Steve’s name falling from his lips in a gentle litany as he submits. Steve thought nothing more could surprise him about his non-corporeal form, but Tony’s release passing through him as he sucks him is unaccountably startling. It’s enough to make him take Tony a little too deep, the surprise of it making Tony arch up in a mix of oversensitivity and ecstasy. It makes Steve want to have him all over again.
There’s a click behind him, and then Bruce’s wet hands are braced across his lower back. His thumbs dig into the dip at the base of Tony’s spine.
you. I wanted to hate you and you were so fucking beautiful, Steve, you’re unreal, you know that? The photos really don’t do you justice, it’s…” He pulls himself out of Steve’s embrace, stalking back to the bar. Every line of him is pulled taut, the corded muscles of his arms tight as he moves to pour himself another drink. His hands slice through the air with violence, each gesture sharp and economical. “Talking to you was like a nightmare. Everything…I know we don’t talk about my father, but-”
“Okay,” he says. His gaze flickers briefly to Tony’s face, then away, as though he can’t even bear to look at him.
“Steve was so dedicated to the whole, Victorian pining from afar thing,” Tony jokes, but there’s no humour in it, and
“You know,” he tells Bruce hoarsely. He opens his eyes, fixes Bruce with a pleading look. “To wake up every morning next to that.
He calls down to the concierge and makes sure that everything will be taken care of whenever the girls decide to check out. Then he asks if he can use the loading dock to avoid scrutiny, and thanks the woman when she tells him she can do him one better: she can have a porter escort him to the laundry elevator and take him through the basement to the loading dock.
“Feel my pulse,” Tony tells him, and Steve reaches up, putting two fingers on the side of Tony’s neck. “Watching this gets me hot. Thinking about you holding me down, how strong-”
, and if that’s not true loyalty he really doesn’t know what is. “Wow. Just, uh. Let’s just get the Empire State Building done today, okay? Then we’ll only have the Bridge left. Grace’s team is gonna come in and paint tomorrow morning.”
Tony blinks, spinning around in his stool a few times. He scrubs his hands over his face, then presses his fingertips to his eyes. He breathes in.
Tony lets out a stuttering laugh. He glances away from the schematics he’s working on, a rare warm expression crossing his face as he looks back over his shoulder. “Hello to you too, Reed.”
Steve is a revelation like this. In the beginning, Steve had been quite toppy. He was insatiable, and bolder than Tony might have expected, but after a few times it made a strange kind of sense. Steve was sure of his welcome. He trusted Tony. It was humbling, to see Steve let himself be selfish and just take what he wanted for once. It was something he never did, but Steve had confessed, sex-drunk and satiated, that it was because Tony had always been the one to push him to indulge. Now that he knew that Tony wanted what he wanted, indulgence was easy.
“Sure,” Steve said, not bothering to lower his voice. Some of the people near the stage were beginning to whisper to themselves excitedly, but that was alright. Steve was sure the reaction would only get bigger. “But now I know the date’ll be with Tony.”
“Tony says he shouldn’t talk to you right now,” Williams said, sounding a little sad, and Steve nodded vigorously.
. I absolutely could. So I can’t think like that, the way you’re asking me to. Where does it end? How do I know how to stop if I don’t respect the free will of the people I love? I’m already too much.”
“Why didn’t you say anything?” Rhodey asks, folding his arms across his chest. He and Bruce are standing on the quinjet ramp, flanking Natasha. Bruce is staring at him with narrowed eyes, the blanket wrapped around him like a cloak. He looks dangerous.
Tony watches them go with a quiet laugh, then does his best to lever himself upright. It isn’t as easy as it looks. People seem to forget that the suit is
Steve takes the glass with a resigned kind of amusement that’s all too familiar since the conception of the Avengers. He takes a wary sniff, nodding at the sweet, almost cloying tang of the mead wafting up from the glass. “Loki saved me,” Steve says to the golden liquid.
"Did Loki just save Widow?" Clint says, sounding stunned but also furious. "And what the fuck are those agents doing?"
“Bed,” Loki orders, and then proceeds to deposit them there, Tony on his back and both completely naked. Tony blinks as Loki spreads him open and kneels between his legs, hands dragging down Tony’s chest to hips with possessive strength, pinning him. He lowers his head to Tony’s chest, looks up to meet his yes, then presses his tongue to the place where the arc reactor joins flesh. Something warm seeps through him, and Tony stills, panic mixing with arousal into a dizzying cocktail.
Something cold slides into his skull like a knife, slipping smoothly through his thoughts and deeper down, into his fears, his dreams. It takes every image of Tony’s smile, every cherished moment with Bucky, and crushes them down into the spaces between his nightmares. His mother wheezes her last. Bucky falls from the train. Tony plummets to his death from the wormhole. Tony is announced dead on CNN, his Malibu mansion rubble in the Pacific. Bucky stares at him, flat, without recognition. Bucky drives a knife into his lungs, and he splutters, copper blood.
Tony hears as Steve backs into the elevator, picking up his shield. He keeps his gaze steady, keeps his mask on.
“I make you uncomfortable,” Steve realised. “By not wearing blockers. It makes you nervous. You feel strongly about this, because you’re an omega.”
“Fuck me,” he says, and Tony laughs. He spreads Steve with his hands, pulling his cheeks apart to watch as his ligula worms its way back into Steve’s body. He’s pink and swollen, here, dusted with a fine layer of near-invisible blonde hair. He clenches greedily around Tony as he pushes in, deeper, all the way until his suckers are sitting at the rim, just outside of Steve’s body.
Tony slid his hands over Steve’s stomach, lingering over the lines of his abs, callouses dragging over the sensitive jut of his hips. He grazed the back of his knuckles against Steve’s cock, and Steve whined, his whole body tensing with the shock of it.
“Colossus,” Steve murmurs, involuntary, and Tony’s eyes snap to him. Steve tilts forward, suddenly desperate now that Tony’s looking at him. He needs to make him understand. “I look at you in the morning with a circuit board imprinted on your face and grease stained up through your eyebrow and you’re still the most beautiful thing I’ve seen this side of the ice,” Steve says, begging Tony to believe him, but he realises his mistake as soon as Tony begins to shut down. The scoff he looses is venomous.
Tony surveys the sparse room. As soon as he leaves here, he knows, JARVIS will re-engage the heavy magnets that bolt all of the furniture down to the cold metal floor. Every single object in this room is hard steel, and once the safety engages, it’ll be impossible to move anything. The magnets’ calibration is built for Steve’s strength. The bed is just a shikibuton; no sheets to strangle herself or others, no springs to stab through someone’s eye socket, no sharp edges. After that, the cuffs will release. The door won’t be able to be unlocked unless she voluntarily puts them on again, even from the outside.
“You’re not sorry you didn’t let me kill your best friend in front of you?” Tony asks, wry. “Colour me shocked, Steve.”
From then on, every once in a while—usually late at night when Steve knows that he’s thinking about drinking—Tony goes and visits Steve’s body. Every time, Tony checks the various monitors they’ve got him hooked up to, in case he wakes up or shows signs of improvement, probably. He does some things on the computer that Steve doesn’t understand, always frowning at the results of his fiddling. So far, he’d guess, there’s been no change.
“You don’t seem overly worried for your captain,” Loki says, and Tony stills, tension sinking into his shoulders like sand. “And you have been circling each other like feral animals. Yet I have seen your interactions, before, and there was affection and tenderness where now there is avoidance and tension.”
Tony blinks at him, then at Rogers. He takes in the new lab, Bruce’s greying temples, Rogers’ close physical proximity to him.
“Enjoying the view?” Tony inquires, just to push him a little. Loki’s mouth twists, and he presses another kiss to the inside of Tony’s thigh.
“He was that fucking close and we couldn’t find him?” Clint had groused on the phone when Steve had called him and Natasha to come home. “Nat didn’t even get to torture anybody.”
“There’s a good joke in here about a queer Japanese teenager giving Iron-Man tentacles,” Stein mutters. He’s not even trying to be quiet about it, and Tony frowns at him.
Tony claps his hands, dissipating the image. “Well, you should watch the footage of her visit and tell me what you think,” he says, “but I’m sure you’re starving.”
Steve and Tony have always been something of an odd couple. In all the half-finished snippets of Cap/Iron-Man I have floating around, unposted and abandoned, they have fought as viciously as they loved one another. They’re too different in their glories and too similar in their sins, and that’s what’s always led them to being the powder keg that they are in the comics. The movies, having stripped away the ten years of love and friendship between them before Civil War, leaves only the conflict. Steve’s betrayal is even more inexcusable left bare as it is. This is a combination of movies and some comics lore, and it’s mostly me trying to pick apart my growing reservations about a ship that is old, strong, and near and dear to my heart. (Edit post-Ch 11: So far, I think it's helping?)
"I woke up this morning suddenly healed and cast free, with a little card next to my bed addressed to you that said 'How's this for saving?' in dark, shiny green ink. No prints, just residual magic radiation. I don't suppose you'd know anything about that, Stark."
Tony pulls out of Steve’s grasp, picking up his drink and coming around to the other side of the bar. He lets Steve gather him into his arms.
Steve couldn’t really understand what Tony was saying. For alpha-omega pairs, the biological urge to bond with a partner that someone had been monogamous with for as long as they had was almost overpowering. The likelihood that they’d come out the other side of it unbonded was slim to none. Was this Tony’s way of saying yes without having to freak out about actually saying yes?
JARVIS helpfully pulls up the camera from the workshop door, where sure enough, Steve is standing and looking more than a little forlorn. He tries his code, then sighs, stooping down to leave one plate of what looks like lemon chicken and cauliflower rice by the door. God, did Steve
Bruce looks sick at the thought, and Loki looks at him. “She was in shock by the time you arrived, and did not engage you. It’s entirely possible for her to not have noticed a defensive spell. If you agree…?”
“Black Swan is a 2010 psychological horror film starring Natalie Portman,” JARVIS replies immediately, well used to this kind of inquiry. “Shall I read the full Wikipedia summary for you while you shower, Captain?”
Tony laughs, rubbing the back of his neck. “Yeah, well,” he says, gesturing vaguely, “usually I have some sort of plan.”
The projection starts up, the lights dimming in the workshop to allow for better visibility. Steve watches the blue light play over Tony’s face, eyes flickering over the miniaturised versions of their teammates as they flit back and forth, smashing doom bots and dodging energy blasts. His expression is serious, focussed in the way he gets whenever he’s actually dedicated to a task. A cookie takes an absentminded path into his mouth.
“No,” Tony’d lied, and she’d smiled at him like she knew and pressed a kiss to the centre. The print of her lipstick on the crystal pane of glass was still there in the morning, and he’d stared at it for longer than necessary. Eventually, he’d wiped it off with a hotel towel and stepped into the shower.
“Stop fighting,” Tony growled, fingers tight around Rogers’ wrists. Rogers was confused, staggering back and forth, but he stilled at the sound of Tony’s voice. He let Tony put an arm around his waist, his fingers digging into Tony’s collar as Tony half-dragged, half-walked him into the rooms above the jail proper. Wilson had left a smouldering fire burning in the hearth, as well as a note about checking in with the ranches along the pass road. Tony tossed a log on and pulled the spare blanket from the cupboard, wrapping the wool around Rogers’ shoulders. The man had only started shivering in the last mile, a poor sign if he’d been so cold he’d stopped moving.
Something occurs to him, then: a strange thought, something like embarrassment skittering over him as he processes it.
“Well, the guest bedroom’s still where it was,” he says. “You know, one day maybe you could visit a guy when you’re not in dire straits?”
Steve blinks at him, bemused. “Well, of course not. They’re just kids trying to live their lives,” he says, laughing a little. “I’m not sure I see what you’re getting at, Professor.”
“Nope! Not talking about this right now,” Tony says hysterically, glancing around. The majority of the SI employees are still milling about in the street, mixing with the other parade members, but there are people lining the sidewalks. The control panel is cleverly hidden, mostly for aesthetics, but Tony doesn’t trust the press to not be out with long-range directional mics. People are always so desperate for Avengers gossip.
Tony wakes up to the cacophonous honking of midtown traffic with a muscle ache in his neck and sunlight streaming bright into his bedroom. The bed is empty, and he scratches at his scalp for a moment in confusion, licking the dryness from his lips.
“Yes,” Thor says. “In many ways, I find it humorous that he thinks our parents are not truly his family. He is more like them than myself, most days.”
Tony took a moment in the shelter of a small mining shack, trying to get his head on straight. He didn’t come out here because he was the best horse handler, or a tracker. He’d come out because he was the smartest man in Timely if he could manage to keep sober for five minutes, and there had to be a smart way to bring the sheriff home. He’d come out here because the town was too yellow-bellied to come out in the snow and look for a man who’d saved them all three, more like fifteen times over. He was not out here because of Steve’s pastoral, hearty cooking, or the way his hair looked in the firelight slick with sweat, or the way his mouth could twist into a dirtier grin than the good, Lord-afearing sheriff had any right to. He wasn’t.
“I have never felt safer, or more cherished, or more sexy, and beautiful, and deserving, and loved than I do when I am with you, Tony,” Steve said, glaring through the glass to make sure that Tony was with him. “You are the most incredible mate anyone could ever ask for.”
One day, Steve looks across a metal worktop at Tony, sleepy and barefoot and shirtless and covered in machine oil, the outline of an Allen key imprinted on his cheek, and Steve says, "Oh." Then he fills one of Tony's enormous black mugs with black coffee, and hands it over with a smile, because that's life for Steve these days; always changing, always new, always painful.
Thor looks at him with measurable confusion. “The Lady Sif was with me on Asgard; she could not have assailed you.” He scowls. “And I do not take kindly to your aspersions.”
Tony laughed, shaking his head. He pulled off his still-damp britches and shirt, leaving himself only in his underclothes. He hung his clothes to dry on the back of the chair, then slipped into bed. Rogers was quick to bundle him close, the warm length of his body pressing up against Tony from behind, chest to spine, thigh to thigh. Tony let out a soft sigh of pleasure at the warmth of him, nestling back into Rogers’ embrace.
“Alpha,” he said, before he could stop himself, and then blushed so hard he could feel it spreading over his chest. “Um.”
“I have never seen you make such stupid tactical decisions in all the time I’ve known you,” Tony says, “and I’ve watched all existing footage of every campaign you’ve ever run, so that’s saying something.”
“No, Captain. He recognised my voice. I put on some children’s television programming, and it seemed to calm him down. I had thought he might change back as he slept, but I suspect now that both Hulk and Dr. Banner are worried about sir, and this heightened state is keeping him in Hulk form. But I am not an expert on Dr. Banner’s biology, and I cannot say for sure how his transformations work.”
They are so, so far from being ready for that conversation. They might not be ready in a decade, Tony isn’t sure.
"What are you working on?" Steve asks, laughter in his voice, and Tony wrinkles his nose at him without looking away from his work.
Tony swallows. “It’s a sex thing,” he explains. His voice is toneless, dead. “It’s…weird, and creepy, and not something I would have ever wanted to share with anybody.”
“You like the idea of making some home movies?” Tony quips, and Steve’s whole body tightens. He presses a button on the remote, and the footage starts to rewind. He clicks play.
,” Steve says, pronouncing the word carefully as though he’s trying to get a feel for it in his mouth.
“You know, nobody gives me any credit,” Tony says musingly, tilting his head to the side. “Am I not the genius in this equation? Or am I just so hard to deal with that expectations are really that low?”
“Kid,” Clint grunted, loud and firm. “Cap, go home. We’ve got this, and you’re fighting a nasty case of bond-sickness. If Bruce is right and worst case scenario happens, you’ve got a while left of this. You need to rest.”
“The recommended aquarium salinity for the common octopus is 36 grams per liter, Captain. Recommended tank temperature is around 76 degrees Fahrenheit, which is much cooler than the temperature you are likely considering at present. I would suggest turning off the hot tap.”
Loki’s expression darkens, and Tony takes his temporary distraction as an opportunity to squirm out of Loki’s grasp, flipping them over and pinning Loki to the bed. Loki glares up at him, but Tony can see amusement lurking behind his ire.
"What do you need?" Tony prompts him, re-adjusting the direction of one of the microjets. "New commute, DC’s questionable public transit… A car? A motorcycle? I thought you had one of those. You've got a Triumph right? Did you want something else? Could get you a Ducati. Oh, no, you need to move your stuff. I've gotta have people for that. J-"
They stood together at the edge of the landing pad, Thor putting his arms around the two assassins and dragging them under the broad protection of his body. Bruce stood a little off from the group, separated by a bare four inches or so, but they were all staring rapt as Tony flew, twisting through the air like an acrobat.
“Fuck,” he bites out, and Tony flushes hot at the sound of the curse in Steve’s mouth. It’s so rare for him to be foul-mouthed, even when he’s angry. He doesn’t even curse when they’re shouting at each other, and in this particular instance the word just sounds dirty and desperate. Tony can’t help but imagine him saying it in other circumstances, and he turns to stare at the ceiling, flopping one forearm over his eyes to block out the sight of Steve’s broad, straining shoulders.
“Well, there’s a long history of Irish Americans in the firefighting business,” Tony says, “but sure, I mean. I’m just the engineer, here. I’m Italian and German. So you guys tell me.”
Steve is tired of Pepper flaying him open and walking out, but he supposes she did learn from the best. He has no idea what to do with what she has given him this time, though. He has no idea how to even begin processing the things she’d said. Before now, Pepper had been someone he respected, a friend he would have trusted with his life and the lives of those he loved. He can’t quite reconcile that woman with one who would say, blatant and unashamed, that she doesn’t care about the greater good.
Tony’s face wipes clean of all mirth, and Sue scoops her son up into her arms and scowls out across the whole room.
Steve blinked, considering. He hadn’t thought about that. “And Pepper and Jim?” he said, testing the idea in his head.
“And, it’s true, what they say—alphas talk, right? Howard was…he was always saying stuff I didn’t agree with. About O’s, like we called 'em back then. About lady omegas, specifically, but sometimes beta ladies, too. And we all just laughed about it, because it was Howard. He was harmless, right?” Steve looks up, then, and his blue eyes are fierce. They pin Tony to his seat. “But it isn’t
He goes through the motions of charming the National Grid representatives. Pepper’s been mostly handling the city contracts for clean energy, but the tech folks had wanted someone to explain some things, and Tony was ten times more charismatic than anyone in R&D proper. More than that, the reactor had always been his baby; there was no one who understood it the way he did, and he was more than happy to talk about it to some suits for an hour or two if it meant getting New York City’s power grid 100% green by 2020.
tell you, you’re everywhere, it’s…” Steve squirms, clenching his fingers in Tony’s hair, just shy of painful. “I want you inside me. Right now.”
“Yeah, he does that. Dark and mysterious, it’s kind of his jam. Or crutch, let’s go with crutch. No flash bang, though, he must have liked you. You okay?”
Tony clears his throat. He glances down at Steve’s body. Already, the airlock on the chamber is letting out a hissing stream of fog, pale white as it curls up towards the ceiling. The plate lifts, and Steve makes a split second decision. He slips into his body, lines himself up, and closes his eyes.
Steve considers this. “I don’t really like the idea of a someone literally being able to look into my head,” he admits, rubbing at his temple a little. “What does Tony think about all this?”
“I tried,” Steve tells him, despite himself. He knows he’s wasting his time answering, but it feels more cruel not to reply when Tony’s so clearly shaken up.
“Okay, first of all, slow your roll so much,” Tony says, putting a hand up. “You do not get to question my relationship with Pepper. No one does, except for Pepper, so you can fuck right off about that.”
“Tony!” Steve gasps, startled, and Tony rumbles a low laugh. He sweeps the flat of his tongue over Steve’s skin, feeling the flesh harden in his mouth. He’s always loved that feeling, and he sucks gently at the rising nub, humming in pleasure when Steve arches under his mouth. “Tony, my God-”
“Isn’t it?” Pepper glances at the slim gold watch on her hand, then stands. She buttons and smooths her blazer with a quick, graceful sweep of her hands. “I have a meeting in twelve minutes with the Chief of the NYPD Counterterrorism Bureau, so if you’ll excuse me.”
Steve scrubs a hand over his face, swallowing down the surge of acid that swells in his throat at the memory, the cool tones of Xavier’s voice loud in his ears. He takes a breath, counts, breathes out.
Steve felt like he lost hours like that. All that he could process was the steady encroachment of Tony’s cock, the bittersweet taste of him, the warmth of his skin. Tony’s hands were buried in his hair, not holding him down, just there as he rocked his hips slowly but surely in and out, in and out. Steve lost himself to the rhythm of it, moaning when he was able, letting himself be used by his alpha. And all the while, of course, Tony was talking, murmuring filthy things as he fucked him.
He turned to one of the cameras, taking another deep breath. He could smell trees, dirt, the hint of snow. It was all wrong. Tony smelled like the dying leaves of autumn and metal and musk. Everything was all wrong.
