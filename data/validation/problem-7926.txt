Tony got to his feet and all the hairs stood on end on his arms. Tony guardedly approached him. Peter watched him from the corner of his eye and tried not to draw attention to the fact that he was watching Tony’s every move.
Steve couldn’t hold back anymore and returned his hands to Tony’s body. He grasped his hips and helped smooth his thrusts. He splayed his fingers across his skin, reveling in the feel of his slick flesh.
of them, Steve.”
Tony entire body convulsed as he sat up sharply.
“The devouring one?” Steve asked with a chuckle.
She shifted the gun to center it over his heart. She had never considered such an option. Because, she informed him, “It is not possible. They’ll see my implant is blanked. They’ll know you’re still alive.”
“My dirty boy needs a good cleaning too,” Steve replied making Tony moan.
“Iron Man and Captain America were going to save Thor from that teddy bear,” Steve said, nodding to the bear lying on top of the Thor action figure a few feet away.
Tony didn’t need to turn around to know Wade and his son were looking at each other with warm gazes that one would only see in couples happily in love. Once again, Tony replied truthfully, “Yes, they are.”
From there, the rest of the morning was spent similarly as the morning of the preliminary hearing. Everyone was quiet at breakfast, the team came with Steve as a show of support and they drove to the courthouse together, the protestors and media were barricaded outside the courthouse, and they had to go through their chaos again.
“My insanity is what attracted you to me, admit it,” Tony stated with a cocky grin.
Tony’s face crumbled and he looked like he was on the verge of tears for a second. However, he closed his eyes and took a steadying breath and, when he reopened his eyes, he stated with a determined voice, “I’m going to figure this out. If I could save myself from the edge of death…then I can do the same for you.”
Tony took Steve’s hand from his reactor and brought the appendage up to his mouth. Steve watched breathlessly as Tony kissed the same fingers that had touched his reactor. His lips were moist and left traces of himself on his skin. Then, without any warning, Tony drew Steve’s fingers into his mouth. His hot tongue caressed his fingers and he sucked on them, hollowing his cheeks as he did.
Steve readily picked up the boxes and followed Tony back to the kitchen.
He was a soldier like Steve. His heart seized under the pressure of the cold dread.
Cable nodded and said, “I couldn’t say anything until today. I thought you should know, your time traveling is over but the designs that Stark had created will live on in the future…and the past.”
Steve sighed and said, “He just wants to know what happened.”
“Please, just Phil, Captain,” the agent said with a small smile. “I’ve been informed that you are leaving against our medical team’s wishes.”
“Oh ye of little faith,” Tony murmured. He started dancing on his toes again and lightly punched him again. “C’mon, baby, weren’t you going to teach me some new moves?”
That being said, for the next month, I will be backpacking southeast Asia! So I probably won't be posting until I'm back! XD
Every change and every need he had wanted from the future was crushed.
He was wrong. Venom did not shrink because he had grown weak.
“Oh,” Steve whispered, crestfallen. It was silly of him to think Tony…Steve made himself push the idea out of his mind. This was all fake. Tony was doing this to help him.
Steve got up and held out his hand to Tony and helped him to his feet.
Tony laughed and wound his arms behind Steve’s head and whispered against his lips, “I love how meticulous you are.”
Tony washed out his mouth in the spray and then joined Steve on the bench. They lazily kissed until their fingertips pruned.
He was going to create the element needed to fix Tony’s reactor and save his life, even if it were the last thing he did.
“It could mean a lot of things,” Steve rationalized with a grunt as he lay down.
His retort caused the next major difference in their meeting: her anger.
Tony did not notice the smile. He looked at the two with a frown and asked, “Is everything alright?”
“I’m going to stay here with Tony,” Howard murmured.
Maybe he should have Bruce or Vision take a closer lo –.
The choice was obvious, but it was far from easy. Bucky hated to see both men struggle with the resulting emotion pain and recent events made it so much more worse…
“I...I didn't mean that." Worst lie ever. "I’ve got to go,” Peter whispered and, before Tony could say anything, he charged straight to the elevator.
“Shut up,” Steve hissed, not wanting to hear his weak reasoning to back up the lie. Peter had needed him and Steve had failed.
“I need a triple shot, Gary! This one kept me up all night!” Tony called out to him.
“Who died?” Coulson asked upon seeing their stark expressions.
The other priest was just getting into the stolen car when they lost sight of him.
He tried not to let his hope show. He did not want Peter to become infected by it and add to his own. If it ended up not being her he would be crushed.
– I’m going to –.”
“Us,” Tony replied, lightly touching Steve’s chest with the tips of his fingers.
It was light and sweet at first. Steve tightened his hold on Tony’s hips and pressed himself into Tony’s chest. The older man wrapped his arms around Steve’s head and did the same with his legs around his waist. Their kiss deepened and Tony keened needingly into his mouth.
“J, did you run specs? Is it-?”
sure I do not want to lose you. Stay, Steve. Let’s start over.”
“It didn’t just hurt me. It nearly
my boyfriend,” Wade gasped.
It was only then that Tony felt the tilt of the plane. They were going down.
Her implant beeped shrilly as her mate’s instantly lost power and died. Her implant would have a line of zeros burning into its screen but she did not look at it. On a normal day, this would have meant her soulmate’s heart had stopped and he had died. At that moment, however, her soulmate lived but wouldn’t be alive for much longer.
When Steve woke a second time he was in a warm bed with soft music playing in the background. It was a vast improvement from the frozen plane. His body ached but it was a healing ache. Soon, he would feel better.
Wade stared lovingly into those hazel eyes and ran his fingers through his soft hair. He stated with complete conviction and all the love he could muster, “I have never been more sure of something in my entire life…”
“I want a tag to describe us, something more than Taco Tuesday, there are six more days to the week you know?”
“Ready to go?” he asked her.
“From the evidence released to the public, I can discern that he displays unusual strength not found in most humans and had done so seemingly with no technology.”
It was when he felt his strength abating, that he felt
It was a relief and the first step back to going back to their normal, everyday lives.
“You do?”
Tony dragged Bruce to the mansion’s labs and it took them less than an hour to make an explosion large enough to shake the building. The rest of the team came running but, instead of finding destruction, they found Tony and Bruce piled together on the floor laughing.
, they got worse while we were gone.”
“Logan says a lot of things don’t smell right,” Steve countered. “He even says Vision doesn’t smell right and Vision is one of the nicest people I have ever met.”
Pepper lightly sighed again and asked, “Do you want me to get your dad?”
Did he see?
Peter smirked, thinking it funny how normal the greeting sounded and replied, “Hi.”
As soon as his eyes fell on him, Tony shook his head just enough to wordlessly try and stop Steve. Steve bit down on his lip and wordlessly mouthed, “I love you” to his mate.
[Everyone we love always dies!] the voice lamented.
“Yes!” Clint hissed, “You are going down!”
“Yeah, he got hit on the head and now he’s feeling sick, but he says it’s not concussion sick so can you look him over?” Steve gasped out the words in one breath and had to inhale sharply after getting it all out.
Peter sighed heavily and pulled away from Wade's touch as he sat up on his lap. After a moment of hesitation, Wade sat up too, looking worried and he lightly placed his hands on Peter’s hips. staring at each other, eye-to-eye, Peter grasped Wade's hands and promised, “I am totally alright. I may still be a little physically banged up but I will be fine soon…Venom’s gone, everything is great.”
“Give him another hour, if he isn’t home by then, I’ll be right next to you in searching the city,” Steve said, wrapping an arm around Tony.
“Good,” Tony said. “Then I approve of your relationship with a female.”
beyond the barrier of his armor.
“Is there something wrong, Captain Rogers?” Norman asked so sweetly that it was obviously dripping with contempt.
“…Yes?”
Tony curled in himself and painfully gasped, “Oh, Steve…baby...no...”
Peter twitched as he held back a chuckle and lay his head onto Wade’s shoulder with a happy smile.
Wade cocked his head to the side and murmured, “I'm not upset.”
Bucky nodded again and Tony could see a wary trust beginning to form behind those stoic eyes.
Peter’s eyes snapped open and he stared unflinchingly at Steve’s chest. He did not move but looked at if he were waiting. Like he knew what was about to happen.
The medical examiner met Marcel’s eyes and gasped, “Yes. If-If what you say is true then it is
Wade wordlessly returned the embrace but held him tightly, like he was afraid of Peter slipping away.
The next night Tony had a nightmare, Steve gently moved Peter to the other side of the bed then took Tony in his arms. He whispered, “You’re in New York, you’re in our bed, you’re in my arms…you’re in my heart. You’re okay, Tony,” Steve promised and Tony’s fingers dug into his flesh. “You are no longer in that dark place, you’re with me…the guy you jerked off to as a teenager, remember?” He felt Tony stop shaking then felt his mouth quirk into a smile against his flesh and he instantly relaxed.
His phone started to buzz with Stark’s number but Coulson hit the ignore button without a second’s pause.
Before Thor could reply, Loki disappeared in a blink of an eye then reappeared in front of Steve. The Trickster smiled thinly at him and Steve’s skin crawled. Loki did not say a word to him and disappeared again but so did the weight of his son in his arms.
The spell was broken when Peter took his first strangled breath. The sound of it gurgled in his throat.
“Peter!” His aunt called, her voice louder with her closer proximity.
He verbally just told a reporter he was gay. In all the years he spent worrying about this, he never imagined it would have come out so easily or nonchalantly.
Tony silently swore to himself that would never take it for granted again.
“Then I apologize ahead of time for all of the
Ignoring Steve, Bucky leaned forward, towards Tony and murmured, “Now onto the subject of Steve’s virtue…”
Natasha looked to her soulmate and he stared back without any emotion. For once, she and Tony could agree on something.
"Fourth wall," Wade replied cheekily. "Oh, and I apologize ahead of time for Chapter Nine...I always speak without thinking..."
“Tony, Tony, Tony,” Steve whispered with his soulmate, saying the name more reverently than the sing-song version that Tony provided.
Steve tried to call back on the number the text came from but it came back as being disconnected.
Sam sat beside him and joked, "That man is going to never stop worrying over you, is he?"
Peter gasped, “
The screen blipped as all thrusters went to max and Tony’s attention snapped back to the screen. The past Tony was fighting the Sandman now, saving the past Steve from drowning in the sand. The fight was almost over.
Steve’s words pretty much obliterated whatever worries were festering inside Tony.
Coulson slid in behind them and Peter recognized his Uncle Phil. He ran over to the Director of SHIELD to escape the loud Asgardians. Peter latched onto his leg and said, “Hi, Uncle Phil!”
They were still giggling and kissing on the floor when Pepper found them.
Tony felt a flair of indignation at the mention of Wade. Of course, May liked the man. She was civil with Tony and just barely at that…
Steve smiled warmly at him and cupped his face and Tony automatically leaned in and their lips touched in a long needed kiss. It felt like years since he last kissed his soulmate but his mouth was familiar as when they had last touched. Their kiss was pretty chaste considering the lack of tongue action but they pressed their mouths into each other’s like they were sharing their last breath.
Bucky dropped his tray and Tony fell backwards.
Tony growled, “Also, I don’t want you to think we will easily forgive you if you somehow find a solution. You will need to do much more in order to gain it and maybe get rid of that guilt.”
Venom went back to street level and the morsels around him screamed and ran away.
“Foiled again,” the Red Skull stated dryly.
Steve followed their gazes and then saw him…saw
He didn’t mean to wake up!
“The Colonel has some more tasks for me to do so I will not be able to distract you anymore. But, when the Commandos move out on their next mission, I promise we won’t forget you,” Steve swore, his grin bordering on flirtatious.
Peter stubbornly crossed his arms across his chest and jutted his bottom lip out. He did not refute it. He couldn’t. Steve spoke only the hard truth.
Tony rubbed his head and groaned. This was officially his worst nightmare and it was happening in real life.
Clint’s face crumpled and Natasha’s eyes flickered with a nameless emotion. Steve knew it looked bad. He and Bucky had been together the entire night and they found them lying together on the mattress, nestling like lovers. Steve flushed with shame and pushed himself off Bucky.
Steve had to return to his soulmate to spare him any more unnecessary pain.
Bruce sighed heavily and straightened back from the telescope. He groaned lightly as he stretched his back muscles and mumbled, “Not good. I have been trying to replicate what happened to me and try to find a cure from there, but everything fails…I’m not even sure what exactly happened to me…It wasn’t planned, not like Captain America. Captain Rogers had been monitored but what happened is classified so I can’t even use that to reference. Had what happened to me been monitored, I would have so much more data to work with. Right now I’m making guesses and all those guesses are off point…”
His original implant had been destroyed when he lost his left arm but his master had graciously given him one for his right arm. In the Soldier’s mind, it was not something that belonged to him but another tool given to him by his master. It was all to help him in his undercover missions. Those who didn’t have soul implants stood out as being different.
“What do you want?” Tony suddenly hissed.
Tony glanced back at Steve. He smiled sadly at him and turned back to the crowd, saying, “I, myself, had garnered a reputation for one-night stands with men and women but what Steve and I share is not anything like that. He’s made me a better man and…I-I love him.” Tony paused and took a steadying breath before he continued, “Whatever comes of Tyler’s accusations, I will stand by him no matter what because I know this man and he’d
Phil Coulson stepped beside him just as he bent down to retrieve the pretzels.
“You have to get us out of here!” She groaned more than gasped.
“Howard-!” She sharply hissed his name but paused to collect herself. Whispering more evenly, she stated, “Don’t you dare ask me to give up both of the most important things in my life. When we married, ‘it was for better or for worse’ and I am not leaving you over a little assassin.”
“I’m sorry for your loss,” Tony murmured.
He grasped the edge of Tony’s undershirt and murmured, “Your turn.”
Tony was right where he left him, dozing away on top of the blankets, unashamed of his body on display. Steve gently put down the tub as his gaze raked over Tony's form. He was so handsome and rugged it made Steve want to crawl back into bed and make love again and again until he didn’t know where Tony’s body began or where Steve’s ended.
Tony got back to his feet with a grin and he and Steve shared a kiss again, each pouring every ounce of love they could into it.
Pure terror instantly raced through him.
“Looking for Steve Rogers. I hear you’re the man to speak to about that,” Tony replied.
Their sources eventually came back as being viable. Zola was going to be on a train, trying to escape the country. This may be their only chance to catch him.
“Mr. Stark?”
Bucky stumbled forward and looked a little dazed as he went upstairs to follow her orders.
Steve squeezed Tony’s hand and murmured, “Hey Tony…” Tony looked to him and Steve leaned heavily into his side and continued, “This is your hourly reminder…”
This couldn’t be fucking happening.
Steve watched them go with a smile, and commented, “How much longer do you think it’ll be until we’re grandparents?”
! And Jarvis is gone by now so we’ll have no way of knowing what you just did to the future! I can still die but you could’ve damned yourself, Steve!
Steve's gaze dropped and he stared at the arc reactor embedded in Tony's chest. His blue eyes were a maelstrom of emotions and glowed eerily in the reflection of the reactor as Steve considered Tony's words. Finally, he lifted his gaze and stated, "I can’t lose you again, Tony, and I’m not going to deny my feelings anymore. I want you. All of you and all that comes with it."
“But with him around…” Tony insinuated.
“Hey, I know it’s a lot to take in but, hey! World War II is over and there’s no more polio and we’ve got some decent TV! No more of that Howdy Doody crap! And, not to brag or anything, but I’m –.” Iron Man touched his shoulder and Steve broke away from it.
“Alright,” Peter replied, smiling widely. Mostly, he was smiling about the fact that Harold didn’t seem to recognize him.
The Soldier internally flinched as he did not remember what she suggested but instead remembered the pain. His master had tortured him within an inch of his life and repeatedly told him it was because he wanted something he was not allowed. It was one of the few memories that stayed with him and a constant reminder to never go against his master’s wishes again.
He easily reasoned it hurt so much because the incidence mirrored how Bucky had died, falling into the darkness just out of Steve’s reach. But he couldn’t reason why reflecting on their second kiss made him want to cry.
“Papa!” Peter cried and reached out to him as soon as he saw him. Peter was utterly terrified and his face was red, scrunched, and soaked with tears. It infuriated Steve to see his son in such a state.
“Your honeymoon isn’t coming soon enough,” Peter sighed. After being married for over a year the two decided they were ready to finally go. They were waiting until January which was statistically the slowest month for the Avengers for some reason. Peter hypothesized it was because villains’ New-Year’s Resolution must be to be good and they only last the month before they go back to their old ways…
“I don’t have Jarvis record anything in your personal rooms,” Tony retorted and Steve dropped his head in relief.
Steve’s fingers dug into his shoulders and Tony groaned in frustration, wanting his mate’s hands elsewhere. He dragged his hands down Steve chest and slipped them back behind him. He dug his fingers into Steve’s ass, pushing his hips toward his as Tony thrust up. Rubbing them together roughly and hard.
Steve smirked and accepted the card, saying, “Thanks.”
“They’re both related through the gamma-radiation, perhaps?” Tony suggested with a shrug. Steve nodded, it was the most likely conclusion.
Steve licked lips and whispered, “Strip me.”
“It’s alright, big guy,” Tony replied. “It comes with the job. We need a bigger fridge anyways. You and Steve are eating machines.”
Venom shrieked at him as he took a step forward. Wade kept moving and Venom grew in mass as if in warning. When maybe five feet separated them, Venom attacked. Spiked tendrils stabbed Wade in the shoulder and his opposite thigh. Wade gritted his teeth and taunted, “Shish-ka-bobs, again? Don’t you have anything else on the menu?”
Steve separated the distance between him and Tony and pressed his lips to—.
“What happened?” May asked sharply, fear already eroding its way into her voice. She sat down heavily on the larger couch and gasped, “Where’s Peter?!”
Steve whispered, “It was a mistake.”
“He’s not good,” Coulson stated to both of them. “When the paramedics arrived, they were going to announce him dead on scene until Natasha made them check for a pulse. If he didn’t have the serum, he’d be dead. As it is, we had to fly in specialists to work on him, even in this condition, his skin is tougher than what usual doctors are used to.”
Tony stiffened and then sat up sharply on the bed.
An officer bound forward and pushed past Steve, screaming for Solo to let go of the girl. More security came running over from the nearby festival.
“Oh my God,” Steve gasped. “Jarvis is right. It
Tears were still falling from his eyes, but they were happy ones. He air-high-fived back and then hastily whipped away at his cheeks.
One thing was for sure, Steve was
Tony forced himself to concentrate on his work and had a prototype by the late afternoon. He constructed a new joint on Bucky’s shoulder and then had Bucky try on the new arm so he could see what adjustments he’d need to make.
Steve and Tony could not get to know Peter’s friends with the exception of the ones he made at SHILED daycare and Peter’s best friend, Harry Osborn.
Tony’s face pinched as he fought off grief and he reached up to hold Steve’s face. He whispered, “I love you too, Steve. You and I…
Peter ran his hand through his hair and sighed.
How was he alive?!
Fury nodded to himself. The two men were together. An interesting development and beneficial knowledge as well.
Mary’s steely eyes slid from Steve to Tony and the lack of emotion in her gaze made Steve want to take back his question. He saw something in her eyes that was off. It was the same crazed glint he had seen in many super villains’ eyes.
Steve had included Mary’s picture in with the rest of them. It had seemed appropriate, if it were not for her sacrifice none of this would have been possible. Steve would have never had Peter, he would have never moved into the tower, he and Tony would not have gotten closer and eventually started dating. She was a part of their family even though Steve nor Peter had never met her.
“Then I’ll open them,” Bruce volunteered. “The Hulk would save me before any harm would come to me.”
They took him to the Tower as it was his home and he desperately wanted to see Tony but it was there the public was waiting for him. There was a stage set up and everything. Steve was supposed to go up there and introduce himself to the world.
Norman was laughing uncontrollably as he watched the SHIELD agents try and fail to stop him. Alone, Norman would have eventually been captured but Norman was not fighting alone.
They’d adopted Peter when he was orphaned as a baby and both of them fell in love with the boy in less than 24 hours. Steve melted a little internally as he watched Tony with their son.
“I will write a sonnet about your ass that will rival Shakespeare!” Wade declared and Peter couldn’t keep it in any longer and fell forward under the force of his laughter.
Tony nodded and slipped off the top half of his uniform and then pulled off his shirt. Steve openly stared at the arc reactor. Tony had yet to meet someone who hadn’t. But, Steve then tilted his head to the side and he stated, “Before we bandage you, you’ll need a bath.”
“Cap,” Natasha nodded to his shield and said, “Don’t forget your extension.”
Tony added, “If you give us some personal time, I’ll even add in my two cents. Promise.”
. His fingers were already stinging as he imagined the needle pricking him. God, he hated it. He had to do it more often now that…that Gwen was gone. Peter frowned and his eyes went to the picture frame on his desk. It contained a photo of him and Gwen laughing without a care in the world.
Mary’s frown deepened and she pulled away from her equipment and asked, “Who?”
“It?” The robot murmured in question.
Fear spiked into his heart. He could not let Tony know this turned him on!
“You’re serious,” Bucky stated.
“Good as new,” Tony murmured.
He kept his gaze pointed out the window and started mapping out a new, tentative future…with Steve. He’d never imagined settling down with someone…he never thought it possible…but now, the future seemed limitless.
“Sharon?” Steve asked, clearly taken aback by the suggestion.
Steve nodded quickly and gasped, “Yes, yes, of course!”
Peter eventually slipped away into his own room at the Tower citing he needed some alone time. With the door sealed, he sat heavily on his bed and dropped his head into his hands. He took several deep, quaking breaths that he had been holding in, and let his entire body shudder after holding it in for so long.
Tony settled against his soulmate with a relieved sigh and explained, “Usually, no. It’s just the darkness…” Tony shivered at the memory of it. “It’s still so shocking to me. I’m still not used to sleeping with it…”
“R-Really? Even kids??” Steve gasped, “I thought you wouldn’t –.”
Steve squeezed his shoulder one last time and then pressed a kiss onto his forehead before parting.
He launched a grenade at them but it exploded before it reached its target.
“Careful, punk,” Bucky hissed. “That arm is barely attached as it is thanks to your stupid ass.”
“You’re going to have to kill me too,” Steve hissed.
“Yes, Master Rogers, shall I tell him you will be joining him momentarily?”
“You are now,” Jarvis replied.
“All that matters is that he loves you,” Steve murmured comfortingly as they stood up together.
He looked down at the inky black substance covering his body and watched in amazement as it disappeared and turned back into his clothes.
Yet when Venom made his move to eat the mugger, his body exploded, and Steve saw Peter for half a second. Bruce paused the video and Steve could almost make out his son in the pixelated video.
Wade picked himself off Peter chest and they slid out of bed together. Peter changed into new clothes and Wade slipped on the clothes he had tossed on the floor.
“Where’s Pops?” Peter demanded, “Where is he??”
He began to work 9 to 5 like an everyday American. Maria was much happier with the arrangement, but Tony was shy. He’d grown up without Howard being there and he was clearly unsure how to act around his father.
But he was Tony Stark. He wasn’t going to let a little thing like death keep him down. He might be dying but he could delay it at least. Maybe give himself enough time to right the future so Steve won’t be cursed to become the Winter Solider and…maybe even give himself enough time to reach the future and say goodbye before the palladium finally did him in...
“Are you sure about this?” She asked.
She focused the crosshairs on the back of his opponent’s head and laid her finger on the trigger.
He was alone in his lab and on the couch. Tony sat up and grinned down at his nude body and the blanket draped modestly over his hips. He knew for a fact that it was not there before.
“I made blueberry pancakes,” Steve stated as he stacked the said materials on two plates.
“Of course, Howard,” Peggy swore. “And let me know if there’s anything else I can do for all of you. I can be there within the hour.”
Tony’s eyes widened and he hissed, “Where is she?? Is she here?”
Steve moved with him and pulled Tony against his chest, spooning him from behind.
“You incited it,” Natasha growled.
As he pulled in, he was surprised to find a fuming Tony waiting by the elevator. Steve bypassed his parking spot and pulled up next to Tony and asked, “Are you okay?”
-! My dad?! Where’s my dad?”
Tony stepped into his suit with a grim expression and his sorrow burned away in his fury. Whoever disturbed Steve’s grave was not going to live to see another day.
Howard snorted and lead him though the lower levels.
As soon as Bruce’s eyes fell on them, he turned green and expanded in an instant.
Steve smiled at him and then rubbed his thumb over the back of Tony’s hand. He leaned in and whispered, “I’m more than ready for it.”
Still restless with energy from the surprise attack. Steve walked through the line, checking on the soldiers.
“Steve?!” Tony gasped, his voice was instantly alarmed by the terror in Steve’s voice.
Then he heard gunshots.
“…You are as freaking adorable as your son,” Tony commented, making Steve flush. Tony stepped up to them and kissed Peter’s forehead then grabbed Steve’s collar and dragged him into a quick kiss on the lips. Steve’s chest swelled with a pleasant warm sensation.
Tony lightly squeezed his arm one last time and then turned to the remaining fighters. Peter looked to be struggling with the octopus man and the Goblin had destroyed the units Friday had sent out and was advancing on Wade who was none the wiser, cheerfully kicking a downed Electro.
Steve had helped him find a tent and they set it up beside Steve’s. He ignored his in favor of going into Steve’s tent. Tony sat down on his sleeping bag and started to strip immediately.
As always since coming to the past, his mind went to his favored resource of time travel, the
Tony opened the core and another burst of smoke was released.
Eventually, they ventured back into the team’s common area. Tony had texted ahead to tell the others they were finally coming out and they were all waiting for them. Steve held Tony’s hand in his without notice and when they came to a stop, Tony leaned into his side. Over a week earlier, Steve would have been fumbling from Tony’s touch but now his presence at Steve’s side was as natural as breathing.
Wade reacted immediately and got the metal pole between himself and Venom’s large jaws. Wade’s muscles bulged as he pushed back at the strength of Venom’s bite but the monster still raked him with its long claws, dragging large amounts of blood from his boyfriend.
of all people hadn’t threatened Tony’s life.
The future and Tony's life should be completely unaffected.
Steve shot up in the bed as the alarms blared and the lights turned on. Tony rose with him, keeping his hand on his back.
Thor had invited Jane Foster, Lady Sif, and the Warriors three and they entered the room with loud exclamations of congratulations and excitement. Peter hid shyly behind Steve’s leg as the warriors introduced themselves.
. I will be happy with you
“Our son,” Steve reminded him as he also patted down Tony’s suit. Tony’s hands stilled against him then he smiled warmly at Steve.
Tony leaned back in order to capture all of Steve in the photo and his boyfriend both blushed and puffed out his chest making Tony smirk. He sultrily teased, “Never, Steve.”
, was that man annoying! He kept stealing Tony’s food! Tony was a snacker and so was Bucky apparently. Neither one of their stashes was safe while the other was around…
When Tony had turned 21, he inherited all the rights to his father’s company. He revealed to Steve he was both nervous and excited. He had big plans for the company and it became extremely apparent in the dreamscape within the first week of his acquiring the company.
Water gently lapped at their bodies and sounded almost like the tinkling of bells. Their loud pants eventually slowed and became almost noiseless until all Tony could hear was the calm lapping of the water.
He had the relationship he dreamed for…but, now he had the additional price that came along with it.
When he went down the hallway, he caught a glance of himself in the mirror. He looked completely normal expect his eyes. His eyes were his own: large, scared, and unblinking.
Heimdall focused his gaze to the origin of the call. Thor, the Lady Sif, and the Warriors Three stood weary but victorious in an open field, realms away from Asgard. Thor was grinning up at the sky and such an expression told Heimdall his prince was exuberant about their latest victory. Heimdall lifted his sword and dropped it into the key slot, opening the bridge for his prince.
,” Peter replied stubbornly.
Steve closed his eyes as he pictured the scene and moaned, “That sounds amazing.”
He bit down on his lip as his heart sped up from excitement and then trepidation.
“You’re hilarious,” Steve mocked with a dry voice and pushed his friend toward the door.
Clint removed a few knives, a gun, and a thick wire with handles on the end before stepping back and saying, “He’s clean.”
But…was it really that simple?
Wade couldn’t meet him that night because he had something going on with the X-Men. Peter texted him sporadically but he mostly worked with Eddie on their breakthrough. Everyone else left the lab by end of shift but they continued to look over their slides and mix their chemicals, measuring their every drop with abated breath.
“We’ll get you set up in the medical wing at the base and I’ll have access to more supplies. I might be able to find something more to help you,” Gabe said.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve had Tony, body and soul, and he couldn't be happier.
“Logan’s a good guy but I am not going to repo the shield because Logan doesn’t like the way Pete’s creation
Steve walked over a few moments later and whispered, "He hung up."
Tony paused when he saw him and wondered if he should leave Steve alone. When he saw the trembling in his shoulders, Tony was reminded of that night he had woken Steve from his nightmare and Tony separated the distance between them in a few quick strides.
How would Tony justify using him so? He had yet to say anything about the photos taken without Steve’s knowledge. Or was he just going to treat it like a joke and pretend it did not matter?
“I’m going to fly the rest of the way,” Tony growled and leapt out of the plane.
After she left, it was late afternoon, and she had unhappily agreed to help him with investigating Obadiah. The sun would be setting in another hour and that meant Enigma may run by for his second scheduled jog. Despite being exhausted, Tony was still too curious about Enigma to pass up the opportunity to see him again.
Tony opened the door and Fury was standing there with a frown and his arms crossed over his chest. Still smiling, Tony wrapped an arm around Steve’s torso and said, “Hey Eyepatch, have you met my fiancé, Steve?”
Natasha and Clint reached his side as he was just about to tip over into insanity.
“Don’t tell me you are going to go on a run,” Tony murmured, stretching his arms over his head. He wrapped his arms behind the pillow beneath his head and adjusted the cushion to a more comfortable position.
He pushed Natasha away from him and charged Barnes. He grabbed the man by the scruff of his shirt and demanded, “
“Crap,” Peter muttered. He stuck the mask under a pillow to hide it and stabbed the needle into the cushion beside it. He got up and went to the front door. He flexed his fingers as he walked, getting rid of the stiffness from sewing.
They had to run to the car and Tony pressed their driver to speed. The rest of the team had already driven ahead to get to the court in time so they were alone in the back for once. The spontaneously pressed into each other as soon as the vehicle started to move and wrapped their arms around each other. Steve’s chest felt bulbous with a happy warmth and he couldn’t stop smiling.
The car was jerked back and Peter was the only one who managed to stay up right since he was still sticking to the seat. His Spidey Sense was fueling his adrenaline and his heart was racing in his chest. The car was wrenched in two and icy cold air stole his breath. Peter suddenly found himself alone. He heard his father yell out to him but all he could see was the glowing red eyes of a poorly constructed robot that held up his half of the car.
Tony smirked but complied and Steve felt comfortable enough to carry on with his business. Once done, he flushed the toilet and bumped into Tony’s side as he went to the sink.
Had she had her phone on her when she died?
Brock gulped and then whispered, “But it is still a biological entity so, theoretically, like us, certain things can hurt it but…but whatever we use could hurt Peter too.”
When he finally saw color on the white horizon, Steve thought his mind was breaking. Yet as he got closer he recognized tents and moving figures as people. They were oddly dressed in puffy, full body orange suits, but they were people all the same.
“It seems she kept our disposed of samples,” Tony explained as diplomatically as he could when referring to his and the rest of the male team’s masturbation habits.
Steve twitched at the stove and Tony could almost see Steve’s indecision coming off him in waves. Eventually, Steve looked over his shoulder and smiled at Tony.
‘Pizza!’ Was Steve’s instant reply. Tony laughed again and, as soon as he stepped into his suit, he placed the order.
Nevertheless, at night and in the privacy the Tower, they were totally different people.
Bucky rubbed the blood off his lips and stated, “No, I want to…She smiled at me. It was little but-but I want this. I want her.” His small rueful smile grew wider and when he looked up at Steve he saw no trace of the solemn Winter Soldier in his excited gaze. All he saw was the Bucky he had grown up with, the one who loved a challenge and had a laugh always on the edge of his voice. He grinned excitedly at them, his lips splitting open a little more, and said, “I was not so sure about this at first but for the first time in a long, long time I know now what I want. I’m going to fight for her. I want what we had before and I’m willing to do whatever it takes to get her back, – even listening to the mad scientist’s hair brained ideas!”
“What happened?!” Steve demanded and interrupted. Tony’s right side was drenched in blood and it stood out starkly on his white shirt.
Tony looked to Steve desperately. How was he supposed to convince Peter? His entire life he believed Richard was his father. He and Steve were strangers to Peter. Why should Peter believe them?
He could tell by the tone of his father’s voice that he was bummed by the prospect. He wanted to tell the world Peter was his son but he was willing to deny it if Peter wanted to keep up the charade.
“Because,
The Hydra agent raised his gun again as if to bludgeon in his head with a second hit. With one eye already swelling shut, Tony squinted at the masked man with a grimace and fired a single shot at him. His aim was off so it only clipped the man's shoulder but a second shot to the back brought him down.
It was almost like it never happened.
The fate of the future, however, narrowed a bit more.
“Um, we already have the blueprints,” Bruce mumbled.
Steve smiled at his son, happy to just look at him.
Steve’s gut dropped at Gabe’s words. He quickly looked to Peggy and saw the confusion in her eyes too as she processed Tony’s words. He then looked to Bucky and Bucky met his gaze with alarm growing in his expression.
“Beautiful, ain’t she?” The crewmate asked, nodding to the city.
In a few minutes, Tony had his beard trimmed to a nice shave level. Steve ran his fingers over the stubble as Tony changed the razor head. He commented, “Guess that’s a little quicker than scissors…”
Grinning, Eddie stated, “Paper balls got through the bio-shield defense, upgrading to paperclips…”
His breath caught in his throat when the man beat his father and he stopped breathing all together as he watched him throw Howard back into the car and murder both of his parents. The soldier then walked up to the camera and shot it, making the screen go black…but not before Tony saw the man’s face.
Tony went to the pool’s edge then eased himself on the stairs. He went down a few steps and sat down on one that was deep enough so his waist would be submerged. The water was heated but his cock was running hotter and the water felt colder there than on the rest of him.
“Stark, we're going to have to have you exit the suit while you are on premises,” one of the agents advised him.
Her mate looked down and ran his metal fingers across the pad of his thumb. She wondered if he could feel anything with those metal fingers. He took a moment to answer but Natasha could see his internal struggle reflected in his eyes.
That feeling totally dissipated as he saw Kilian step up behind Tony with two glowing arms and a feral grin. He felt nothing for himself or his fate. All his fear was for Tony and the fact there was a dangerous man standing behind him, unbeknownst to him.
Peter pressed himself into his space and he cupped Wade’s face as he whispered, “Are you okay?”
“It was less than five minutes,” Steve hissed. “You couldn’t be civil with the man for less than five minutes.”
“Tonyyyyyy,” Steve growled menacingly from the grill.
“Relax, Steve,” Tony whispered, his warm breath caressing the side of his neck. His hazel eyes bore into his gaze as Tony implored, “Touch me. Don’t make me do all the work.
Steve nodded unable to voice his goodbyes. The rest of the team followed her lead and all stood together and presented Steve with saddened but honorable looks then quickly left before Venom was totally able to regain control.
The song ended and another with a similar tempo began and they continued to sway and press into each other.
Steve had grown used to it the last few decades but Tony…Tony had never experienced it before.
The suit closed around Tony and he went to the exterior exit door to blast outside to get to the penthouse quicker. Friday replied, “It is hard to determine. I cannot determine who is the Code –.” The AI’s voice jolted to a stop and then it stated with certainty, “It is Peter. It looks as if Venom has him.”
A man with a black eye patch and trench coat distanced himself from the others and called out, “At ease, soldier!” He walked up to Steve and said, “Look I’m sorry about that little show back there-.”
Steve gripped the strap to his shield tightly as he watched the last of the Hydra soldiers being rounded up. Phillips had already made the call to make camp a mile up the road where they had better cover and the men could more easily search the area. Scouts were already alerting nearby forces of the attack. The Hydra officers were going to be questioned and the rest of the agents were going to be sent to a prison camp with one of their smaller units as escort.
“Who the hell are you!?” Tony hissed, inching toward his bedside table where he had hidden his suitcase suit.
, you’re perfect!” Steve’s blush grew under his praise.
“He’ll wake up eventually,” Pepper reasoned.
Tony scoffed and said, “I think that fire cooked your brain…Babe, I hate to tell you this… you’re a mess…And you have no hair….or eyebrows.”
!” Solo hissed and started to run.
Nonetheless he could not help but reflect on his old feelings. The old Bucky was still in that damaged shell just as the old Steve was somewhere inside himself.
“And how does that involve us? Why did Jarvis call us down?” The archer replied with just as much sass.
Steve smiled warmly at Tony and said, “We are cute.”
“What??” Mary hissed. Her face twisted into something ugly and it immediately had Steve on the defensive. He automatically moved into a fighting stance but as soon as he realized what he had done, he made himself relax.
“And if something serious happens?” Bucky asked unhappily.
Steve wordlessly tipped off the top and Tony groaned, “God, you make opening baking soda look hot…”
than fine, Friday,” Peter laughed. “But I should probably find a way to –.”
“Are you sure, Captain? My brother has been known to throw quite memorable feasts.”
No, wait, he was the one they had been looking for! The murderer! He finally caught Howard unaware – he finally –!
Dad had been screaming over Uncle Bucky’s communicator moments before the explosion and his yells had been filled with desperation and horror that made Peter’s blood run cold. But with the explosion, his father’s screams fell silent and it unnerved Peter more.
“You don’t know that,” Steve countered. “For all you know, he could’ve had access to Palladium!”
Tony didn’t like being alone anymore. He’d grown used to the close company of people with his months in the Commandos. He had also been desperate to be with these two people all that time that he didn’t want to leave their sides just yet, even when he was dealing with this emotionally traumatic personal shit.
“And you, my Prince Charming,” Peter countered.
“And it's because of that I think I'm the luckiest Wade Wilson in the Multi-verse,” Wade jokingly stated, with only a slight tremble to his voice.
“Good enough!” Tony said, “Alright, no one freak out. Because if any of you freak out, I will freak out. People usually freak out when they see me take this thing out.” Tony put his hand on his reactor and turned it clockwise. It released with a light click but then also released a small puff of smoke.
“If you love me, you would swear it,” Tony demanded, his fingers digging into Steve’s chest as his grip returned to strangle his shirt. Steve’s gaze constricted and skewed so he only focused on Tony and everything else around them blurred.
Wade hesitated Peter could tell by the way he held his body and his lips shifted uncertainly against Peter’s mouth. He was probably wary about how much he could touch Peter so Peter raised his calves and pressed the heels of his feet into the dip of Wade’s lower back, pushing him against Peter.
“You alright, Stevie?” Bucky asked and pressed his hand to Steve's forehead. “You're flushed like you have a fever. I thought you couldn't get sick no more?”
All in all, there was no confrontation. Mary was wary and did not say much so Steve did most of the talking. Tony added a few antidotes but mostly he held Steve’s hand and would squeeze it in support.
They were getting close to the French coast now. They could already smell the salt in the air and the men were getting anxious to reach the ocean and let off some steam in the cool waves. They were in Allied territory too and the men were more relaxed and talkative as they marched. The mood in the company was good. They passed more civilians now on the roads and they always greeted the Americans with a wave of the hand or smiles.
“So…” Peter asked, “How does…I mean, Tony, how do you think he would feel about… well, about getting to know me?” With the question out there and by the blank look on Roger’s face, Peter quickly reiterated, “Err, or you know…Is he interested? Because if he is not interested then I am not interested. I’m just curious, you know? Who would not be curious? I mean he is my birth father, you know? His video he sent me just got me...thinking. What if he had, had a part in raising me or being in my life as a kid? I'm still pissed that he...I'm upset by this entire situation but I can see now it wasn't just his fault and...I...I want to see if we are alike and not in just in facial features. I mean, he’s a genius and, well, I’m pretty smart too. Who knows we might be on the same wavelength and can talk science or not…because he might not be interested… I just don’t know…What do you think?” Rogers’ eyebrows had risen through his speech and Peter flushed with embarrassment. He mumbled, “Sorry, I babble when I get nervous.”
Peter glanced at them and then back to Wade, hunched over in his arms.
Steve cleared his throat and whispered, “I don’t mind…do you?”
Bucky positioned himself at Steve's side a reiterated, “No, you
“Everything will be alright, Pep,” Tony assured her. He and Pepper gave the container a wide berth and he had five of his suits standing between them and Bucky. Steam rose out of the vents as Bucky was rapidly warmed and then the doors opened with a loud hiss.
Happy was in a coma, Pepper almost died, Steve was badly injured, and Peter had almost been kidnapped. Tony had been having really bad anxiety ever since he nearly died in the vortex during the Chitauri attack and it felt ten times worse now.
“Steve’s just – uh – feeling off,” Bucky replied.
Steve leaned into Tony’s side, resting his head on his shoulder and holding one of his hands. He closed his eyes and Tony started by explaining how they got to the future and of the battle to save their future son. He trailed off when got to the part when the Goblin had crushed his reactor.
“The last two nights?” Steve guessed.
!” Steve reiterated, “What were you thinking??”
“Why is Tony so smitten with Peter?” Steve asked Bruce.
“Ever since you found out you were a dad, you have been on me about my health,” Tony teased.
Steve nodded and hope finally gurgled in his stomach. Tony was correct. Anyone in their right mind would see that woman was unhinged. Maybe they would beat the prosecution in the hearing after all.
“Think of it as a party decoration!” Tony said with a grin. The entire floor was decked out in bright steamers and balloons. There was a huge cake with the Avenger’s likeness on it and around the giant bunny were a number of presents.
, Peggy, give us a moment…” Steve whispered.
“I don’t know, he just didn’t meet my eyes and was saying weird things…”
“This is a laptop. You’re new to this century and, with this, you are able to access the internet, a nearly unlimited database of information. You can learn about the history that has passed since your plane went down. Or, you can research our enemy, the Goblin, otherwise known as Norman Osborn in this era. In this century, he’s yet to create the Goblin formula but he is still a ruthless businessman. Or you can play mindless computer games. Everything is available on this so use your time wisely.”
Up close, Tony’s condition revealed itself to be worse. It looked like the Goblin was trying to inflict the most pain he could on Tony when he battered him. The bruises and abrasions probably covered his entire body but all Steve could see was Tony’s face and that alone made him sick.
—,” Steve squeaked.
Tony thought he was going to be the first to shock all of these people but Steve had to go and steal his thunder. In the background, he could already hear their audience going crazy.
There was a click over the line and silence. After a long pause, Tony gasped, “…Did he just hang up on me??”
Flushing, Peter perked on eyebrow at Wade for his obvious wandering eyes, particularly at his rear end.
to make love to you right here, right now.”
For a few seconds, Steve’s shock overrode all his emotions and he felt nothing. As he sat there, in the very room Peter had played in countless times, –
Steve’s laughter swiftly turned into passionate moans as Tony’s tongue slid into his mouth and his fingers expertly touched him in all the right places.
The arc reactor was a part of Tony’s body but it too was technology. It too could change.
“I wish to partake as well!” Thor announced. He downed the last of his coffee and rushed over to the pot for a fresh cup.
Steve closed his eyes and pictured Tony holding Peter as a toddler. The older man was smiling warmly at their son and it was one of the most fondest of his memories he had of the two together.
“I just need to check your memory. The crash may have given you a concussion or rattled your brain,” the doctor explained. “I ask these questions of everyone who gets hit in the head. You displayed an odd reaction to the phone. How about where you are from?”
Eddie opened the small fridge under Mac’s workstation. Sitting in a large, triangular flask was Mac’s project, its codename, VENOM, was etched into the glass. It contained a pitch black liquid, darker than ink and reminiscent of the dark hole it was born from in space.
As Colonel Phillips went over the days deployment plans in the command tent, Peggy looked like she was dying to speak to him privately but Steve purposely stood near the front of the gathered group so she wouldn’t be able to get a quiet word with him so easily. He could even feel Bucky’s eyes burning two parallel holes into the back of his head but he did not acknowledge his best friend’s stare either.
He bit Steve’s ear and Steve gasped, “We should try again. Third time’s the charm.”
He remembered Tony thought he had died on Air Force One and felt all his guilt rebound.
“Wade.”
The Soldier found he couldn’t eat. Something was wrong. His chest was constricting and he could not even his breathing.
“What do you want to do until the party starts?” Tony asked Peter.
“Unless Uncle Bucky is cheating at cards,” Tony whispered loudly to Peter. “Then you have free range to knock him out.”
Peter smiled warmly at his stepfather and replied, “Yeah, Pops, I’m alright.”
Steve chuckled and moved down Tony’s body to properly worship him.
“Will it be private?” Peter asked, remembering all the cameras and camera phones he’d seen since entering the building. It would be strange for a lone intern to be suddenly seen hanging out with the Avengers.
"Wade..." Peter whispered, his eyes also searching Wade's gaze.
The name flew over his head. Despite his years in the 21
Clint looked with him and, as Steve turned back, Clint hissed, “I’ll find someone!” Turning to Natasha, he asked, “Do you have him?”
Not Steve too. Don’t let those same words Peter said come from his husband’s lips. It would destroy Tony.
Tony had all of the major newspapers delivered to the Tower the next morning and winced when he saw their cover stories. He laid them out on the coffee table and the rest of the Avengers hovered over the stories as they read their captions.
Peter looked up. A woman stepped over to him, her face clouded with concern.
Wade crawled up his body with a carefree smile and whispered, "How was that?"
“Oh, you naughty boy,” Wade murmured huskily, dipping his head to kiss the side of Peter’s face.
The trial started off similarly to the hearing as they all rose for the judge and the clerk read off the charges. The main difference were the twelve jurors that entered the room.
“Just having fun,” Steve teased, leaning in across the counter, bringing himself closer to Sam.
Steve helped Tony with his bandages and he bit down on his lip every time Tony flinched from Steve applying too much pressure to his sensitive skin. His heart hurt from inflicting pain on Tony...but his resolve grew.
“Iron Man needs it,” Steve replied.
The mercenaries had them completely surrounded. Steve’s shield and gun were where they lay abandoned and Tony’s suit was damaged with only the repulsors to fight with. Their only chance was somehow alerting the team but Tony’s comms was destroyed with his helmet and they would notice if Steve activated the comms unit in his ear. Otherwise, they had no way to fight back without killing themselves in the process.
Both Steve and Tony nearly upchucked their food at his comment.
The judge raised her hand and his lawyer fell silent. She stated, “I have heard enough.”
“Well, tell you what, I’ll give him a call right now and you can ask him to pick you up,” the man said, pulling out his phone.
“Or you can make a lot of money off slipping her name to the press,” another lawyer retorted. “If you don’t have any viable questions left, then we will take our leave. Unless Captain Rogers is under arrest?”
Bucky’s head swiveled in his direction as soon as he burst into his bedroom and was already on his feet with a Glock in hand as soon as Tony reached the balcony.
Steve stared at his lips and stuttered, “I-I…Y-yes, al-lright. Now.”
The man didn’t move nor could Steve tell if he was conscious. He was lying face down and his long, dark hair was obscuring his face.
Steve jumped on him and forced Tony’s body into a nearby ditch. Tony grunted from the impact, but he too pressed himself into the ground as the air above them exploded with blue light. They were chest to chest and Steve wrapped his limbs around Tony to best protect him from Hydra’s weapons.
His repulsor blasts were nowhere near anyone’s heads but everyone ducked down and the fighting stopped almost immediately.
Tony was instantly hooked.
“Yes,” Steve replied cautiously, wondering if he’d faint again. “Your son, Tony…”
Unlike with Peter, these agents had no qualm with hurting Eddie. Eddie couldn’t use the tricks to escape like Venom had done with the threat to Peter’s life. Eddie was insignificant.
Tony’s broken heart was reforming and beating once more. The pain of Steve’s loss was receding and, in its place, was joy and fulfillment. He felt complete again.
just died, pal. There's no politics here, it's just good old-fashioned revenge. There's no Pentagon. It's just you and me. And on the off-chance you're a man, here's my home address: 10880 Malibu Point, 90265. I'll leave the door unlocked. That's what you wanted, right?”
Additionally, I added more to chapter 5 (the prior chapter) a couple of days after I posted it so check it out! It's the very end of the chapter and I added more to the exchange between Tony and Fury.
Everyone was in the community room when they got there.
She got up from the table and left him alone in the kitchen. He dropped his head as sadness overwhelmed him.
Peter snapped his head up and Peter flushed in mortification. Dear Lord, what was he thinking??
Steve grinned when Peter did not use the simple syllable utterance of “Papa.” Peter never before could call him “Pops.” Steve hugged him tightly and affectionately murmured, “Stop growing up.”
“Please, don’t do this. We have time. We can work it out,” Peggy begged, still not accepting the reality.
Mary and Coulson both shared similar expressions of uneasiness. Did Peter come here to yell accusations at her?
“I could easily shoot out those air conditioners on the roof. They would never know it was foul play. Just a sliver of metal will be needed and in less than an hour they’d all be toasting,” Clint suggested.
As Steve was catching his breath with deep ragged gasps, his cock sprang back up with renewed attention.
“Yeah, I took command as soon as you decided to catch the idiot who tried to kill himself,” Bucky replied.
Steve watched him go and then put the food into the fridge. He paused and looked down at his hand, examining the ring that will forever be adorning it now.
“For the shield you were working on?”
“Maybe we should hold off…pass this by Pepper or let you sleep on it,” Peter murmured nervously.
They shared the bench for several long minutes in complete silence neither looking at the other.
He was happy and he was home.
!” Tony whooped and cocked his gun with an excited grin. He charged forward and Steve raced after him.
He unfortunately had to remind himself of that fact as he cooed to his wailing son who had been crying for the last hour.
“You…” Steve stated, his voice barely above a whisper, “You have a son?”
in love with Poptarts.
“What-?”
It was a small town and early enough in the morning that not many people were out. The town was old and Steve was finally able not to feel too out of place. He spotted the familiar steeple of a church, rising out of the trees, and, like a moth to a flame, Steve was drawn to it.
“It’d be something Jarvis would do,” Tony sighed heavily. “The suit is probably in full stealth mode and, from this height, even I wouldn’t be able to see it. You don’t have to worry about it. Jarvis will only come if my life is at stake.”
“Coming right up, Petey,” Steve promised. He glanced back up at Tony and felt a flush hit his cheeks.
Steve silently stepped up to him and Tony whispered, “I can’t move!”
“You’re welcome, Cap,” Tony retorted snarkly which, in turn, increased Steve’s aggravation with the man. Why’d he have to be so-so…
Steve stretched forward and kissed his fiancé, pressing him deeper into the mattress. Tony groaned into his mouth and dropped the bottle in favor of  digging all of his fingers into Steve’s scalp. Tony then wrapped one of his legs around his waist and dug his heel into Steve’s backside, pushing their hips together.
“It's getting late,” Steve whispered.
“You bastard, that's not what I meant,” Tony hissed but shakily smiled at him all the same. Steve ran his thumbs over Tony’s cheeks, washing away the tears he did not know he had shed.
The junior agent stared at the footprints with shock, just noticing them. Like with Coulson, fear began to grow in the young man’s eyes. He gasped, “Right away, sir!” And then ran from the plane.
The Director was going above and beyond what was expected of him.
Tony was clutching his chest with one hand and with the other he grabbed Steve.
But he knew Steve Rogers and Tony Stark would not look at him with the same joy.
The air became still between them. Tony looked at him in horror.
Tony paced, not knowing how to tell Pepper the ex-assassin ran away because Tony admitted fault in the event that totally destroyed his life. She was going to be pissed and worried and she might finally have that heart attack she always threatened to have when Tony did something stupid.
Steve smiled sweetly at him and whispered, “We have the rest of our lives…that will be our forever. This will be just an annoying little blimp in our reunion.”
His company’s law offices rented several rooms in a skyscraper near the Avengers’ Tower. They pulled into the private garage and Tony led the way to the entrance to the building.
A motorcyclist came onto the screen and Tony knew without a doubt this must have been the Winter Soldier.
Peter inhaled sharply but, before he could exhale a shout, Venom shot half its body mass at his face and smothered his voice and he fell back onto the bed with a heavy thud. Peter limbs were fully freed with Venom’s sudden jump to his head and he quickly flailed them, knocking over his lamp and a few books off his end table. The thuds seemed as loud as gunfire and Peter paused in his struggling to see if anyone noticed.
Peter replied to Wade’s statement incoherently with a noise that was comprised of a combined grumble and moan.
“Now I need to see this woman in action,” Steve murmured with interest.
“How are you doing?” Tony asked him softly.
“That is the saddest excuse for a bathtub I have
Because so many have been asking, it usually takes me a little over a week to write a  chapter and I post sometime over the weekend (unless real life strikes when I'm not looking) but, since I'm currently working two fics, the chapters will come out every two weeks or so right now so I can devote time to both works!
Sam sighed again and looked down at the fussing baby and murmured, “Poor kid…”
Steve took another step back and his eyes spanned over the room, pinpointing where everyone stood and looking for a way to slip past their defense. Their defense was solid but he spotted another player in the game who must have slipped in while Tony distracted him.
But Tony had other plans.
“We…ah…can take them to my tent. No one can intrude on…whatever is going on here?” Howard volunteered, clearly a little confused by the turn in conversation.
“…Do you age?” Tony demanded as Fury stopped before them. He certainly didn’t look much older than the man they interacted with in the past.
“What?!” Tony gasped, sitting up straighter. “No!”
Bucky lowered himself so he was sitting on top of his legs and Steve gingerly sat next to him.
After they got settled in, Steve and Peter spent most of their time in the community room. Steve began to sketch again or played with Peter with his new toys.
Peter looked up to see if he was really gone and was sad to see it was true. Dad still only saw a child when he looked at Peter. He still saw the boy he had raised. He did not realize how much he had changed…
Steve snorted and whispered, “I’m going to be hearing Back to the Future quotes for the rest of my life, aren’t I?”
,” Steve gasped, suddenly appearing over him.
Tony grinned and said, “Only if I’m buying!”
“Thank you,” Peter replied gratefully. The older woman slipped away and Peter sank back onto the stool with a light sigh. He closed his eyes and willed the sugar out of his body to feel better.
“Shut up, Steve, you know I’m right,” Tony countered to Steve’s wordless look.
,” Tony groaned. Upon Tony’s explanation, Steve picked him up, turned them over, and pressed Tony into the sand. He lifted Tony’ legs over his shoulders and Steve’s thrusts increased, making Tony groan loudly again.
He should have run.
“Good. Very good…Do you need anything else?”
“He’ll be fine, Dad,” Peter assured him. “He’s a mutant with an awesome healing ability. He will have a new arm by tomorr –.”
Bucky turned the imposter onto his chest and pulled his arms behind his back. Natasha handed him some handcuffs and Bucky accepted them with a grin.
As Tony privately flushed to himself for his mistake, he silently berated himself for the move. He went over to where Steve had left the champagne bottle and made himself busy as he slowly refilled the flutes.
But he never touched Steve in any way that may be considered too intimate...even though it was all he had been dreaming about ever since that slip of a kiss they shared weeks prior.
Steve felt like he was going to be sick.
“Bucky will definitely not let you live this down,” Steve stated with a knowing air, making Tony groan.
“Benign.”
“It’s not bothering you?” Steve asked in concern.
He was so quiet. Tony felt unnerved by a quiet Bucky…but, then again, with everything he had been through, he was lucky Bucky was even able to function.
Steve kissed him again. This time it was longer and Steve’s arms pulled him into a closer embrace. It was kisses like this that made Tony remember the fireworks, bursting elation he first felt when he and Steve first kissed. His legs felt like rubber but his heart felt like it was going to explode with love. He loved Steve
“I’m the real Steve,” the imposter moaned in vain.
“We will be told once we are in the air,” the man replied. “But it supposedly is in the west, most likely at one of the bases in Nevada.”
“Why are you avoiding your problems with your dad?!” Wade retorted, his words gaining momentum. “The Peter I know would do all within his power to make all that is wrong,
Steve stared at Tony as his friend’s singular utterance of his name echoed in his mind. Why didn’t he let go?
“I want to woo you by the moonlight,” Tony retorted and Steve chuckled. Grinning, Tony stated, “We did pretty well last night under the stars…”
Peter playfully bumped into Wade, letting him interpret the wordless action on his own.
Pepper stepped up to the bed and replied, “I know for a fact that you haven’t eaten since yesterday morning. You need to eat…You’re scaring me, Tony.”
It was a warm night and neither of them needed additional layers to keep them warm. They walked around the perimeter of the building, mostly to themselves, save the occasional sentry.
The psychiatrist slipped past him and Coulson closed the door. As soon as the door sealed behind him, Coulson sighed heavily. Yes, he definitely saw the first meeting with the Captain turning out
With his breath caught in his throat, Steve ran a thumb over Tony’s cheek bone and whispered, “Tony, I love you…”
She looked into Peter’s eyes and saw none of the love he had openly displayed when she first saw him. He knew she was not his mother but it still hurt Mary all the same.
It was normal for him to recover memories but he was supposed to ignore them. They only hindered the mission if he focused on them and, usually, they never were strong enough to distract him.
“From there, it’s history,” Tony said with a smile and a warm gaze.
At the moment, his dad was sitting across from him, wearing a worried expression and making no moves to touch the food Aunt May put in front of him.
make love.
He would never hold Tony again – never kiss him – never laugh with him – never
thankful and in love with this man.
Tony smirked and replied, “I plead the fifth.”
He felt horrible for intruding on such a private moment, but he needed to stay in case something happened with Tony’s arc reactor. This was the greatest stressor it would face with the heaving sobs Tony unleashed upon his chest.
“What I did with Bucky was wrong and I knew it the instant it happened. It was a mistake and I was an ass. I swear from the bottom of my heart that it will never happen again.”
It felt like he lost him all over again.
“I…I don’t know,” she gasped. “The armor suddenly-.” She inhaled sharply and he heard her move quickly and something hard hit the metal of the suit. She grunted from the impact then hissed, “I got you.”
“Understood, sir.”
Did you even consider
Peter turned to his aunt and she explained, “Your text was vague but you hinted at a fight with Tony so I texted Steve so neither of them would have to worry where you were. If you don’t want him here, I can kick him out.”
James nodded and murmured, “Come on.”
Tony clawed at his chest with his free hand gasping for breath. He tore open his shirt and his nails gouged into his own flesh drawing more blood. His arc reactor glowed an ominous blue against his deathly pale skin.
“Other employees from the Avengers’ Tower have come forward and said the same thing: Mr. Stark and Captain Rogers are friends and nothing more. This whole thing is probably a sham to protect the Captain from a rape charge. We have seen the rich and powerful lie about even greater things in order to escape a guilty plea. This is just anoth—.”
Tony ducked his head under the showerhead one last time and reached up to run his hands through his hair. He flexed his muscles out more than usual for Steve’s benefit and Steve hummed in approval.
Steve snorted and said, “You looked that actor up just so I knew what you were talking about.”
Tony’s eyes flickered to Steve and they both smiled as their gazes made contact. Beneath the table, they had been discretely playing footsies and Tony couldn’t be happier.
Tony threw is head back and stared at the ceiling, his heart constricting as it tried to understand the relationship he had, had with his father. He wished his father hadn’t waited until he was “old enough to understand.” Things may have turned out drastically differently.
happy....so lucky.
“That’s fine, the sun confuses many. How about the day you crashed, can you tell me when that was?”
“You’re also more of a horn dog,” Steve laughed, wrapping his arms around the back of Tony’s neck.
Years prior, in another era, Steve had sworn to Tony that’d he’d survive and see this day.
watching you.”
“Is-Is that the robot everyone is talking about?” Gibbons asked nervously.
“Wade,” Steve growled in correction and Tony felt his insides shiver from his tone. “
Especially when he woke and then turned to the man in his bed and still feel as fulfilled as he had the first time he woke.
Steve nodded and then nodded Tony to the left. They split with Steve circling from the right and Tony going the other direction.
Steve laughed and Tony smothered it with a kiss.
how passionate you are about things, but, a lot of times, you will let things get out of hand. I don’t want you to inadvertently hurt yourself…”
Tony smirked at the horizon and then added King Kong onto one of the mountains and several planes began shooting at it.
“Doubt it! But can't say we didn't try, eh? And, if we get arrested, you owe me all of your pudding cups from the dinner meals for the next month.”
Steve came to a complete halt.
Steve laughed wetly and did as Tony suggested and kissed him. Tony pushed back into the kiss even though it was probably disgusting because Steve was a weepy mess.
Steve groaned and his already red face grew a shade darker. He moaned, “I thought I was the only one alive with the knowledge…”
Steve woke later that afternoon with Tony in his arms. The warmth of his content and love bubbled in his chest and he kissed Tony’s forehead. Tony continued to doze so Steve lightly traced his face with his fingertips and lips, memorizing Tony’s face with his eyes and touch. Eventually, Tony woke.
Tony's eyes nearly bugged out of his skull and he choked down the coffee he was about to swallow. His groggy mind woke up with Steve’s statement.
She gulped nervously...This could actually work. Her implant was zeroed. The Academy would think she had murdered her soulmate. She gulped dryly again as she imagined the deception. Was it worth it?
Tony threaded his hands through Steve’s hair as he opened his jeans and kissed lower.
Natasha rolled her hand under his hand and carded her fingers through his. She felt him jolt with surprise. She played it off as nothing and murmured, “I’m still not going to call you ‘teacher’ anymore. Hurry up on remembering your real name.”
Which was why he had been looking for a good picture of them…he wanted to present it to Peter when he – well, he…
“I-I’m fine,” Peter stuttered as his heartbeat returned to normal. “Just wasn’t expecting to see him…”
Tony didn’t have to die!!
“You weren’t far from the mark,” Peter retorted darkly. He quickly explained, “When I texted May last night, I may have neglected to mention that you were going to be here. So seeing you practically having sex with me may have been a little shocking… especially since I haven’t told her we’re dating… or I’m bi…”
He closed his eyes and he irrevocably lost himself in the memory of Bucky holding and kissing him. The act had erased Steve’s mind once. Maybe it could happen again…
“Go after her!” Tony hissed.
“Or maybe I’m just taking pity on you,” Peter teased. His phone buzzed and he looked down at it. It was a single message from his dad, stating, “Showtime: main hall – 10 minutes.”
But, the fact of the matter that was weighing down on Tony’s mind was that Peter had spent the night at Wade’s and Tony was trying
“I guess that’s your way of telling me you are hungry...” Steve whispered with a smirk.
“Hmmm,” Tony murmured thoughtfully. “I think I finally figured out what to do for Project Winterwidow Part Four…”
! He closed all the files and demanded, “What happened to Steve?”
- his fiancé, he smiled so widely that his smile speared from cheek to cheek.
Sighing heavily, he slipped off the train and decided to walk around whatever town he was in before jumping another train.
“He knows now,” Steve reasoned. “And I doubt he’ll tell anyone, we know his big secret too!” Steve turned to Tony and said, “Plus, he seems like a guy you can trust.”
Pops left, following the same path Uncle Tony had taken to exit. Peter watched him leave with shock as his pops’ statement finally made sense.
Peter stood and slipped his hands into Wade’s. There was one problem he still needed to rectify. He stated to Wade, “Let’s get some takeout and go to our roof and talk.”
Tony was young. He may be smart for his age, but he still didn't seem to grasp the greater picture of the fact that Steve was Captain America…that he was…dead…
No, wait…
Iron Man landed next to him a moment later and his face shield popped open. Tony snarled at the detective, “He just saved
“I’m glad we are in agreement,” Tony stated and reached between Steve’s legs. He dipped the towel under the water and cupped his balls. Steve threw his head back with a groan and tightly gripped the rims of the tub. Tony lingered down there, rolling his balls in his hand then paying particular attention to each testicle stroking each as if he was polishing fine silver. He took his time and it drove Steve to the edge.
Stark let off a colorful stream of curse words, forcing him to removed his ear piece. He needed to concentrate but he knew Natasha saw it as a bad sign by the way she paled.
“…Yeah, um, anyways I think I left the coffee pot on in the lab,” Tony murmured. “We should be heading out, Mary…”
“I think I would like to wait until Wade is fully healed but, after, I have this urge to see Bruce.”
“You okay, Tony?” Steve asked.
He looked down and saw the black mass moving around his torso.
As much as Steve wanted to stay in Tony’s arms, he had to pull back. He lightly kissed the side of Tony’s neck that was exposed and then looked to his best friend. Natasha had his head cushioned on her lap and she was lightly petting his hair.
Steve smiled at him and reached over to brush the dark hair off his forehead. Steve murmured, “Our relationships are
Tony slumped in defeat and frowned as he said, “New rule: we are not allowed to die on each other without the other’s permission. Agreed?”
“Tony…” Bruce paused and scrunched his face as he thought. He continued, voicing his words slowly, “Tony took us all in when we had nowhere else to go. I think he likes to help people. Just don’t question it.”
Bucky lunged forward with a massive swing to punch Natasha. Natasha dodged and grabbed his outstretched hand, wrapping her hands around his wrist. She used the momentum of his punch and threw herself into a flip, curling her body around his and kicking her leg at his head with all her bodyweight behind it. Bucky raised his other arm up just in time to block the kick and Natasha hit the metal arm with a loud, echoing thud that made Steve wince.
Steve dropped his head and murmured, “...How did my fate become so twisted from being happy with you?”
Steve nodded, afraid to imagine a trial…any trial just yet.
A beat of shocked silence enveloped them.
Steve raised his shield just in time to absorb the blast but went flying across the room. He hit the walling hard enough to make it crumple but thankfully did not break it. Steve did not give himself a moment to feel any pain and jumped up just as the Iron Patriot stepped over him. He punched Steve back down and the floor buckled beneath him. Steve slammed his shield into Rhodes’s gut and the man went flying back.
Natasha perked an eyebrow and murmured in Russian, “Do you not remember how to shake hands?”
“Sleep well, Captain?” Schmidt asked with a smirk.
They cooed and chuckled until they got to the last picture.
Peter paused and repeated the last half of the statement to himself, “All a date may entail.”
Tony did not let himself think. He locked onto Venom, charged his repulsors to maximum thrust in seconds, and shot himself straight at the symbiote.
Steve squeezed Tony’s hand and replied, “Send them in.”
Tony smiled warmly but then sarcastically said, “After all of my wooing, it’s the lube that does it?”
Pepper grasped his forearms and begged, “See a doctor. I’ll pay off the entire hospital to keep quiet if I have to! Just, please, don’t do this. Steve would never forgive you or me.”
“Are we in trouble? How did she know? Can she read our minds?? Do you think she’s angry with me? Is she going to stop training me? What’s Auntie Tasha going to do to Uncle Tony and Uncle Bucky? Is she going to kill them??”
“Your son calls,” Tony teased as he fixed Steve’s hair to make it look halfway presentable.
“I swear I won’t do it anymore. I won’t change the future but…we…we should probably end this now.”
He was given a hospital gown and new sheets which were pulled up to his chest.
“It has to do with me,” Cap said with a sigh. “He met me before he should have and now the future is all thrown off because of it…”
“I wouldn’t have given him the chance either way,” she hissed, tightening her hold on her batons.
“It not sticky now,” Peter said. “Like dis, Papa.”
Tony was not searching the city grid nor obsessing over any little tidbit of information. No, Tony was ordering takeout just like it was a normal night, like their son was not turned into a monster and trying to eat innocent people.
How come they’d been allowed to dream with each other all of these years and now…now nothing. Steve was ripped from him without any warning.
leave your family behind.”
“I think my lie was plausible enough,” Tony replied, placing the sketch back on the counter. It unfurled as he rounded the counter to return to his cup of coffee.
“Don’t draw attention to yourself,” Cable said, waving him off in his way of saying goodbye.
They both gasped for breath but continued to stare, neither willing to break eye contact…neither willing to stop sharing their silent vow of love.
Peter inhaled sharply. Eddie couldn’t be serious!
“J, I’m stepping out I need to look at your hardware!” The suit opened and Tony jumped out. His eyes instantly went to the chest shield and saw Stark and Son was gone…but MK 15 was still not there.
Steve sighed heavily, dismay weighing heavily on his heart. He took a deep breath and strengthened his voice to sound like he was ready, able, and about to fight with them as he asked the team, “What are you flying into?”
The Soldier glared at her as he considered her words and then slowly slipped his hand off his weapon. Natasha followed suit and brought her hands to her sides.
More than Tony’s life was riding on this…
!” Peter gasped in horror.
“…Is this real?” Wade whispered, “Am I dreaming?” Wade clutched his head and cursed, “This is why I shouldn’t read fanfics before bedtime.”
The communicator in Steve's ear repeated the frantic message as did the rest of the team’s communicators miles away. The Avengers would be with them soon.
Steve ran. He ran like he never did before. People lunged at him as he ran through the building, but he dodged them and focused on finding an exit over what lies they yelled.
“Rogers, this is an honest to God time machine –,” Howard began to argue.
He hung up the phone and stared at Cable curiously before saying, “You’re free to go.”
Tony snorted having way too much fun with this. It was completely different being in the future compared to his time in the past. His own era wouldn’t be affected or changed by anything he would do. He could relentlessly tease his future son and take joy in the fact that he and Steve were going to have a happy life. They’ll fight some wannabe comic book villains with a ridiculous team name and then be on their way to their era where they could
Peter smiled at them and then looked at his boyfriend to find Wade already smiling. It was all Peter needed to move forward.
Steve expected Tony to protest but, after a few steps, Tony seemed to give up walking all together. The time traveler then moaned, “I feel sick.”
. Steve ran after him, driven by his fear of being left alone again.
“Best friend, indeed,” Tony agreed but on the inside he felt sad which was the exact opposite reaction he expected. The word fake was being thrown between carelessly but Tony just wanted to throw it far away and make it real…
Once he caught his breath, he reached up to the communicator in his ear and lightly pressed the coms button. Feeling like a hopeless child, Peter whispered, “Dad…can you pick me up?”
Before Tony merely glanced at him but now he really looked at him. Steve’s face was scrunched as if he were in pain and he was sweating profusely.
Once he knew he and Wade were getting serious, he’d told MJ that he’d started dating again. However, that was all he told her. She was ecstatic and had tried to get more out of him but he teasingly refused to tell her until she visited him.
“Natasha,” Bucky called out gently, his voice slightly bumpy from the static.
Bucky’s hand shot to the gun on his hip and he hissed, “We aren’t alo—.”
The Tower was surrounded by news cameras within the hour.
. Her stomached clenched uneasily but she inhaled a few short meditative, even breaths to still it.
They were still within sight of the compound but would soon be in the forest.
– Was that why Steve bolted? Maybe
For some reason, Tony paused for a response but he was met only with silence. He was alone in his corner and the Beta Jarvis wasn't near enough to reply.
“What’s got your knickers in a twist?”
His heart broke for Tony, knowing the intense pain he must have been going through. Steve knee him. He’d probably been hiding most of his pain in the world of the living but, with Steve in the dreamscape, he was free to be true to himself.
“My father died when I was young so my Pops, my grandfather, helped raise me. I wanted to emulate him,” Steve replied.
She was the first to look away as one of the courtroom clerks stood up and began to read off the dozen or so charges that Steve was being charged with. It was a list of various counts of assault and rape. Steve’s stomach twisted just listening to it.
“And I viewed your man with my scope so he’s nowhere near me,” she said with a small smile. She placed the last pieces of her rifle away and zipped up her bag. She threw it over her shoulder and stated, “It’s up to two months.”
It was awkward to say in the least.
Bruce smirked and asked, “Remember the codename Hydra gave Peter? Well I think he is going to be more than alright. In fact, when he’s older and wants to join the Avengers, I think it would be more than appropriate for him to use that old codename and call himself ‘Spiderman’…”
Peter’s flush became bright red and he gasped, “Really? You sure?”
“I may have neglected to mention you have a roommate…” Wade chuckled as he slipped out of Peter’s arms and sat on the edge of his bed. He kept his hands on Peter’s hands and Peter unconsciously intertwined their fingers.
He found the knot and pulled it out. The tight bandages unraveled easily once they were no longer taunt and Tony’s light was revealed. Steve stared at the light blue glow in wonder and carefully touched the glass. The reactor vibrated lightly beneath his touch.
“The one and only,” Peter replied. “We started seeing each other after your wedding.”
“All those years, Tony. I never realized it was that long,” Steve gasped. He felt bad for being oblivious to it all.
Natasha regarded him curiously and asked, “Can you really not fight? Even with innocents being hurt and people unjustly dying?”
Venom melted out of Thor’s hands. Thor tried to keep Venom in his grip and grabbed madly at his melting body.
ALIVE.
“How long was I asleep? How badly were you hurt?” Steve demanded.
Steve watched it all in shock and was at a loss for words. He didn’t even hear his lawyer’s questioning him until the judge leaned in and loudly stated, “Captain Rogers!”
“I have all day and a full pot of coffee,” the priest retorted.
“It’s our first morning together,” Steve observed, running one of his feet over Tony’s thigh.
“Yes,” Steve agreed, his cock felt ready to burst. “You should hurry.”
“Duck your head and watch your feet or you’ll go blind,” Tony hissed in his ear. If Steve wasn’t so shocked by the display before him, he would have been embarrassed by how close Tony was to him. Tony put a hand on the small of his back and pushed him forward with his body turned protectively toward Steve.
“No, sir.”
This was not the same Steve hovering over him mere seconds earlier…
Tony considered her question and was very tempted in replying with a tart, sarcastic remark. Instead, he held his tongue. He looked over his shoulder to the broken cyborg, crippled by a broken body and unnatural emotions. He replied, “For the rest of your existence, do whatever it is in your power to make Peter happy for the rest of his life. Only then, maybe, the guilt will abate.”
James murmured, “We can leave Friday. I will make my weekly call to my master, update him on your progress and he won’t expect to hear back from me for another week. We can use that time to escape.”
With his dick no longer ruling his mind, Steve’s rational side surfaced immediately and Steve clutched his face with a groan.
“Yes, Sir,” Jarvis replied. A horizontal video began to play so Tony tilted his screen accordingly. He recognized the build of Steve’s body immediately but he did not see him. The camera was focused on his back. He was wearing a hoodie with its hood up. He was meandering through a crowd. Tony’s skin crawled and he whispered, “Where is he?”
Steve kept his head lowered until he heard Thor inhale sharply and his head snapped up, his heart already racing with scared hope.
“Aunt May!” Peter gasped out of mortification.
belong,” Steve retorted, his mind already racing with ideas.
“Hell, I’m going for it,” Clint murmured, reaching for one of the few remaining eggs.
Steve carded his fingers into Tony’s scalp and his hazel eyes became half-lidded with pleasure from the touch. He continued to massage Tony’s scalp and slowly rocked his hips with the rise and fall of Tony’s mouth.
I have the chance to save him…It’s amazing so, Cap, thank you for all of this.”
Bucky came to an immediate halt then slid down the wall. Steve watched him warily as he slowly turned toward him. Bucky looked ragged. His hair was long and greasy, he had an uneven shave like he did it without a mirror, he was dirtier than Tony after a three day binge in his workshop, and his eyes were wild.
She couldn’t stop the smile that came to her lips and she replied, “Yes, thank you, I will.”
“Mr. Stark?” One of his nurses questioned.
“I think I will call it Clinson or Coulint. Part one is already coming to me now…I’m envisioning green slime…Steve?”
Steve’s cheeks were already flushed but he blushed further upon Tony’s question.
Steve laid Peter down in his own tiny bed and sat with him until he fell asleep. Steve slipped out of Peter’s room, closing the door quietly behind him, then checked on Bucky. The other man was right where Steve laid him, still asleep, utterly exhausted by the events of the day.
“You’re risking exposing yourself,” Tony retorted.
“How in the hell do you even charge that thing?” Bucky murmured, shifting uneasily on his feet.
“Pops,” Peter whispered, touching Steve’s arm and stilling the limb. Peter looked exhausted and he was not trying to fight off the symbiote like he had when it originally took him. Peter met his gaze with eyes that were welling up with tears. He saw the defeat in Peter’s face and it broke Steve.
They strung Steve up, his arms spread eagle, hanging from his wrists. They kept him in the suit, perhaps it was to affront Tony or maybe it was another American symbol for Kilian to destroy. As soon as he was hanging freely, he tested his bonds and was displeased to find that the chains moved with him. They were made for him to pull at them and not strain against his strength. Whichever way he pulled, swung, or maneuvered his body he fell no more than a few feet and in no way loosened his bonds. He gave up after a few minutes and looked around him, hoping to find something else to help him.
Pepper picked herself up and groaned, “Fine, I'm going, but I'm going to send you some statements in a couple of hours that I need you to approve.”
. The shocking events that followed seemed to have made their lives fast-forward. Steve looked back to his boyfriend but suddenly couldn't remember what it was like without him in his life. Time may have slipped by but their relationship had solidified in the meantime. Steve could barely remember feeling embarrassed about holding his hand when they first started "dating." It was natural as breathing now.
Steve looked like he wanted to say something so Tony said, “What’s up?”
“Yes, please,” Tony groaned. The idea of falling asleep to darkness was still unsettling to him. It felt like a lifetime ago but it was only that morning he was scared awake by experiencing the darkness for the first time. He had thought Steve was dead and the old fear lingered.
Tony grasped his hand and carded all of their fingers together except for their pointer fingers. Their pointer fingers pressed into one another and Tony guided Steve to the star, whispering directions and star names as they went.
“Yes, sir,” Coulson replied but internally he was groaning. It’d been weeks since he last spoke to him, but when it eventually got out that Captain Rogers is alive Stark will pounce right on it and never let him live it down. He continued, “My team and I will be in New York in the next two hours, three at the most. I will give you another update when we land.”
Steve stopped keeping track of how many days Tony was held captive. Instead, he remembered to fleeting moments he had with his soulmate. The kisses they shared when Tony would pause in his work or the moments Tony threw everything aside and dragged Steve to a newly materialized couch or bed and make out with him the rest of the night.
Steve’s eyes flickered up and met his and he hoarsely replied, “No…well, yes. I never cried like that before…”
“Oh my God—,” Steve gasped, his face turning bright red.
Grinning slyly, he watched the unsuspecting family huddle together to check each other for wounds and then hit the device, activating it and sending him into
And now here she was and her and Wade were scrutinizing each other very differently. MJ look mostly shocked and Wade’s expression was of barely concealed trepidation. Peter instinctively reached out to his boyfriend and put a comforting hand on his arm.
Bucky turned his inquisitive eyes to Tony and then replied, “Access to research for my mission.”
Steve roughly grabbed Loki and hissed to Tony, “You weren’t cleared to come here by Fury.”
He dreamed of Tony falling from his outstretched hand like Bucky had.
“Yes, Tony,” she whispered tightly.
“We will contact you later tonight,” Coulson said then stepped away with a nod goodbye.
The doorbell rang on Tony’s end and Tony moaned, “Are we still at ‘ding-dong?’ We’re supposed to be on total security lockdown. Come on, I threatened a terrorist. Who is that?”
Peter walked with them, grasping Wade’s other hand and retorted to his best friend, “Really, MJ?”
If he opened his mouth it’d all come spewing out and Tony would probably run for the hills and call off their arrangement. So, he just smiled at the man and they silently made their way back into more crowded areas where neither of them could say or do anything relating to their relationship. His heart slowed down, his blush faded, and the declarations of love stopped threatening to break free.
Smiling down at his fiancé, Steve whispered, “I love you so much right now.”
The tower in New York had become their permanent residence but their California home still held a special place in his heart. It was where Iron Man had been born, where Bucky had healed, where Steve had returned to him…and, in his upset over Happy’s injuries, he’d foolishly challenged the Mandarin to meet him there…
The Tesseract was in the machine and it was on and glowing. Howard had everyone sitting at stations that read levels of input and output and they’d notify him if anything looked wrong. Howard himself simply stood in front of the machine and watched his son climb up the ledge and onto the gaudy chair. He practically fell into it and then glanced around him. He turned the numbered dials on the dias in front of him to the proper year and then paused. He looked around him, probably looking for where to go from there. His bulky, gauntleted arm luckily bumped into the lever beside the chair and Tony was thrown back into the seat by an unseen force.
Steve pressed his face more deeply into Tony’s flesh and whispered, “Yes.”
or risk it turning back to his son.
They’d finally found Steve’s body. He was finally going to be put to rest and–.
otherwise, enjoy the conclusion to The Cover! :)
“I don’t have your iron gullet,” Peter retorted, poking him in the belly.
Something flashed through Eddie’s eyes but, whatever it was, was gone in an instant and Eddie smiled brightly at Peter, replying, “Probably just the same as what had happened to you. Don’t overthink it, Parker, I’m just over-speculating on very little sleep.” He tiredly rubbed his eyes and continued, “I should be drinking coffee right now not water…”
They wobbled and then Steve fell back into the wall. Tony quickly adjusted his legs so he was sitting on his lap and he pushed his hips into Steve. Steve’s fingers dug into the flesh of Tony’s back while Tony’s hands were determined to caress every muscle on this magnificent man’s body.
, Steve. Those are my feelings on the matter. So what were you going to say just now? Are you still going to ask me to make you go…” Bucky pushed Steve into the wall and thrust his hips into Steve’s. He whispered in his ear, “Or are you going to ask me to make you come? Which is it, Steve?”
“If you don’t want to –,” Peter said hurriedly.
Tony heard the key click in the lock at the front door and he hurriedly placed the photo back in its spot. It and the other two fell forward however and Tony cursed under his breath as he scrambled to fix them.
Once again, the feel of Tony’s lips against his flashed through his mind and he felt a strange combination of lust and dismay.
The Captain hadn’t woken once since he received the mortal injury. The Soldier thought he’d survive with his advanced healing yet…now he wondered if he merely saved a dying man. The burns on his chest were grisly and had a noxious odor.
The monster followed them outside and she heard him ask, “She was the one he was training from the Black Widow program?”
Steve looked down at him with a smirk. Tony’s goatee was more grey than brown, and his hair was a lighter color due to all the grey and white hairs that sprinkled it. The lines on his face were deeper as were Steve’s but that was the norm for aging. The same amazing man he had fallen in love with was pouting at him for even hinting they were old.
The first to reply was Clint with: ‘MY EYES!!!!! x_x’
He lightly touched Steve’s arm to guide Steve to the desk and kept his hand there longer than necessary but not too long to be too obvious.
Bucky grasped the case tightly and replied, "I have memorized each moment with the historical accounts and testimonies. I'll make sure they are returned at the right moment."
She stopped and Peter could not look at her. His eyes focused on Richard’s picture and he did not look away. With a breaking heart, he finished what she was going to say, something Peter had been weakly denying since Tony Stark stepped into his life, “—But he is not my biological father. Is he?”
“Repulsor blast times ten!” Peter exclaimed.
Tony slowly fell back onto the bed, never breaking their mouths, and Steve settled himself on top of Tony, stapling his knees on either side of Tony’s hips.
“I had it under control,” Steve grumbled, irrationally annoyed by Tony’s save. With Tony there and the fight not distracting him, the conflicting emotions came trickling back. His heart felt like it was being crushed between two large anvils when he looked up to his friend.
Tony stared at Steve suspiciously and then asked, “Are you getting a gift for Peter involving the shield?”
She answered on the first ring and gasped, “Howard! Are you alright?”
“It’s the truth and he predictably hates me and refuses to speak to me…He and Steve are meeting for coffee right now,” Tony mumbled the last bit. He fell back into the couch and looked at the ceiling. He whispered, “Ever since I saw him all I can wonder is: Did I do the right thing? He was happy with his aunt but now he’s not. I just fucked up his entire life by showing up, didn’t I?”
Peter frowned but his cheeks were red with shame from their chastising and he stiffly slipped off Steve’s lap then went to the elevator. Steve watched his every move as if he expected him to try to bolt again. He only looked away once Peter stepped into the elevator and disappeared from view.
“You don't have shaving kits in the future?”
Tony sighed heavily in reply, and Steve nodded slightly to Bucky. He pulled back from Tony even though his heart was crying to return to his side and comfort him however he could.
The judge returned after twenty minutes. Everyone rose as he reentered the room and sat after he did. Steve nervously stared at him and anxiously waited as the judge settled into his seat.
In the meantime, I made a cover for the Cover! Check it out,
Peggy stood with a smirk and chided, “Honestly, all of you would be lost without me.” She clipped a bullet into her magazine and left him with one last nod.
“Is in France,” Steve reminded him. “It’s waiting by the time machine for you when you’re finally able to return home.”
Steve flushed from Phil’s praise but thanked him.
Tony was seven when he realized, “…Steve, are you Captain America?”
Steve’s mouth twitched into a smile and pulled him to the couch, murmuring, “30 minutes?”
Steve was woken violently.
Steve smiled sadly at him and whispered, “Thank you.”
His cock continued to throb, aching for release.
“Oh father-dearest, please don’t curse! It hurts my fragile ears!”
Steve broke their kiss with a chuckle as Tony’s roaming fingers tickled his sides. He ran his fingers through Tony’s hair and murmured, “What are you doing?”
“Ohhh,” Tony groaned comically. “Right below the belt!” He laughed and explained, “You were my first crush and I guess I reverted back to my childhood mentality? You know, as a kid, you’re supposed to be mean to the person you like.”
Steve dropped into Tony’s hold and, with his lips only a breath away from Tony’s, he whispered, “I love you,” and kissed him deeply. Tony wound his arms around Steve’s head and neck and returned the kiss.
Tony nodded, still not entirely trusting his voice. His heart, however, began to pick up its pace again and his chest was beginning to hurt from the buildup of his anxiety and other emotions.
It was just an empty hole.
In the course of a few minutes, Tony had been hit by that hammer, hit by lightning, and nearly had his limbs crushed by the man’s superior strength but he kept throwing himself at him.
Peter’s hand tightened even more on Wade’s and his fingertips dug into his flesh. He glanced at his boyfriend and saw Peter’s mouth had tightened into a thin line. He must have also noticed his father refusing to use Wade’s name. Wade lightly caressed the side of Peter’s hand with his thumb and Peter looked to him. Wade smiled gently at him and pressed his shoulder into Peter’s letting him wordlessly know it was alright.
A horrified look of desolation fell upon Steve’s husband. Tony took a step back as if to escape Steve’s plea.
He backed up until he hit the opposite wall, and then slid down its surface. His arms pooled into his lap and he finally looked down at his implant. He let out a strangled cry that almost sounded inhuman and then his face fell into his hands and he sobbed.
Tony whispered to Steve, “I fell asleep and you weren’t there…”
They came to a stop in the elevator and it began to rise without their beckoning.
No one spoke for the space of a few seconds until Steve finally gasped, “
Suddenly, feeling a little weak in the knees, Steve sat down on the nearest bench, and gasped to his friend, "...That...it'll be dangerous, Buck."
“Unca Ben saws I am as swee’ as ice cweam,” Peter added, drawing a chuckle from Ben.
It hadn’t been a nightmare.
Clint was currently in there and trying to get him to answer his questions about Steve’s possible whereabouts but Barnes answered every question the same:
Wade turned his head to the side and lightly kissed one of Peter’s arms, murmuring, “No, not that…”
Bucky lifted his head and stared beadily at Peter just as Steve reached his side. Behind him, he could hear Tony scrambling off the boxing ring.
He gave into lightly pinching Tony’s arm as they rounded the corner into Steve’s hall.
Peter let them lead him inside. He was half expecting the rest of the Avengers to be there, waiting for him, but, the living room was empty.
“I can't promise that. You killed a lot of people,” she whispered.
He placed the plate of eggs and a fork in front of Tony and sat down at the counter with his own. Tony sarcastically said, “Har har har, you’re lucky I have coffee right now.”
He heard someone scream and then another person swear further away and then he was surrounded by worried voices. Peter’s mind was spinning from the impact but the voices drew him out of the tornado of confusion in his consciousness. May lived on a busy street and the violence of his impact drew them all to him.
“You can't get rid of me that easily, Wade,” Peter lightly teased and carded his fingers with Wade’s to better squeeze his hand.
What was Loki going to do with Peter??
Tony’s entire body convulsed with a sharp emotional pain that seared into his heart.
“…So they clearly believe her,” Steve stated. His eyes were focused on a picture of Steve in his uniform and the caption reading “America’s Shame.”
Intense heat suddenly pooled from the man’s hands. It was so fast and so hot that Steve tried to scream but the sound dried in his throat. He felt his skin bubble, his flesh cooked and smelt like the bacon he ate for breakfast, he almost instantly went blind and he feared his eyes had dried out of their sockets, his mind became so befuddled that he did not know left from right, and, after only a few seconds of the man’s scorching touch, he heard a popping sound and his brain could not take anymore. He fell unconscious, leaving Steve vulnerable to the Mandarin and his plans.
Thor was close behind Tony and ran into the room, demanding, “How fairs –?!” The Norse God grinned as soon as he saw them and he announced, “Then we are victorious!”
“I feel it…” Steve sighed. Steve wrapped his arm around Tony and Tony tucked his head under Steve’s chin as he wound his arms around Steve’s torso. Steve threw logic to the wind and pressed a kiss on top of Tony’s head.
