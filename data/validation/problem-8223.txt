“What kind, Sir?”
“So, uh, Bucky.” He starts stepping forward, “I was wondering if you’d be okay with me taking a look at your arm sometime?”
But when it comes to settling down with someone you know. Or even just trusting yourself around others it’s hard. Steve literally breaks almost everything he touches and Bucky… he gets the pains.
When Steve had headed toward the crash he told Tony to stay put while he ran straight toward the cause. It was the creature, it’d heard the boys cries and broke straight through the glass to get inside the store. The boy had begun throwing books and anything else he could reach it. At first, the creature had tried to eat one of the books, the only reason Steve had time to make it before it realized that books weren’t it’s favorite meal choice.
“It’s right here,” Steve says, picking it up from the table.
the one who should be apologizing. He’s the one who nearly tore Steve’s eye out, just an inch higher and it would be a lot more than a scratch. Besides. Making sense of it doesn’t matter much at the moment. Tony feels sick to his stomach, his heart racing in his chest, mind clouded and dizzy.
“Maybe, but I don’t regret waiting, or having to wait longer for the other things.”
Tony groans rolling onto his back. Trying to decide if eating is even worth it at this point when Jarvis adds.
Tony: Just some projects, nothing important, how about you?
Tony was. He was smart just like Howard, skipping grades, building AI’s. The makings of a next Gen genius. That’s what the newspapers and magazines had said. That was before they died though. After that, the headlines all changed. No longer talking about potential, but tragedy, and after that changed, they started to talk about him. How he’d need to take over, if he was ready, how the deaths of his family would change the sweet boy with a robot best friend.
This is why he never wanted soulmates.
“Okay, I’m just going to move some things around.” Tony says, using the pen light to move a few pieces and that’s when he spots it. “Ahh, someone’s not where they are supposed to be.” He whispers.
They’d met after having been hiding behind their glasses of wine and whiskey instead of socializing. They bonded over how much they were tired of big events despite their good causes. They’d spent over two hours talking before Pepper came over and told him he was being an asshole, and Stephen declared himself an asshole as well for solidarity. It had turned out to be a very fun evening. But Tony hadn’t seen or talked to him since.
The blinds in Bucky’s room were a light baby blue. He opened his eyes to the light glow of it, and the apartment was as cool as the early morning air due to their poor insulation. But he preferred the cold to the heat. He rubbed his eyes, and stretched in bed, finding himself lazy and not wanting to move more than that. He stayed on his phone in bed for over an hour before his hunger urged him to move. Once out of his room he realized he was home alone, not unusual at this hour. Steve could be at work or on his morning run, and depending on how stressed he was the run could last for hours.
Bucky’s face softens, and his shoulders relax. “Since when are you the one to lose hope? Weren’t you just telling me a Soulmate is for life? That they will accept you because you’re made for each other? We just saw him, it went well. Don’t you think?”
“Something wrong Dr. Banner?”
“Yeah, me too.” He bites at his thumb absentminded as he looked over the designs and schematics. He’d printed everything out and he’d grabbed a twenty-four pack of sharpies he didn’t know he had and was circling areas that would need upgrading and fixing for a more modern look and easier attachment to someone. Medicine and science have evolved and changed since this was designed. Although clearly ahead of its time, it’s severely lacking now.
“You heard me.” Now It’s starting to make sense why Bucky seems so irritated. He left this afternoon walking cloud nine, fantasying about Tony and meeting him tomorrow, now he’s back to grumpy Bucky.
It was barely three minutes before Bucky responded.
You cough heavily, feeling an ache in the arm you landed on. You watch the destruction spread and a big cloud of smoke rising from the truck catching the building on fire, it’ spreading. All right where you were standing. If you hadn’t moved… you would be dead.
He takes some quiet deep breathes, steady’s himself on his feet and tiptoes forward. To the door, pressing his cheek on the smooth sanded wood, and looks through the hole. It’s a tall blond man. No one Tony recognizes. It’s possible it’s a private detective or mercenary of some sort.
“You can come in.” They both smile and step in awkwardly, closing the door behind them. Feeling out of place, and to Tony they are. This is his space. No other person has been here since the remodeling. It’s just him, Dum-E and Jarvis. But it’s fine. Jarvis has security protocols and if anything goes wrong he’ll be fine.
You’re waiting for Stephen to supply you with new orders, run, stay
Soulmates don’t always meet; people often live their whole lives and even get married to people who aren’t their soulmates. Sometimes soulmates die before they meet. The soulmark fades when that happens. No matter how many times Tony reminded her of that fact, she never let herself give in. How could she? Tony was a rare, special man. One of the first in over a hundred years documented to have not one but two soulmates. Neither of which was her.
The man looks like he doesn’t believe Tony, which he should because Tony stares off into space all the time. Usually, Jarvis is the one to pull him out of his mind when he’s done it for a long time.
“You could say I lost the motivation. Stopped caring about my image and looks. I guess that happens when you work in the shadows.”
“Me either,” Bucky says, rubbing at his chest.
“Get that out of my face.”
Tony stiffened, scooting back instinctively. “I’m fine. I’ve had a checkup recently.”
It’s been a while since he got a text message. Pepper or Rhody usually call and leave a voicemail. No one else has the number, so it must be Bucky or Steve. He opens his phone to see the new number and smiles at the message despite its simplicity.
(See the end of the chapter for
There’s a beat of silence and Tony speaks again. “You know what, it’s okay, you basically exploded and re-atomized. Amnesia is the bottom of worst case scenarios. I’m sure it’ll come back to you.”
“Well, Old Norse. What does this mean?” Tony pointed at the runes and symbols. “Eternal gem? Time? And why does it say five?”
“Who?” Steve mouthed to him and Tony mouthed back, moving his lips very pointedly to make it easy to read: “Hydra.”
It took some time, but he isn’t just alive “again”, he has
“One of a kind? Yeah, I know. Sorry. You wanted it badly?”
He bids his time, waits for the price to rise, waits until the bidding fizzles out before he bids half a million. A few gazes turn his way.
It was how this spy game was played and a big part of the reason why Tony preferred to remain his own man.
"Armor?"
“Yes, you got me. What now? You think I’ll come quietly.”
Steve’s whole face lights up. “I have so many things to ask you”, he starts, “did you really see the monster of Loch Ness? And what about the golden pyramid?”
“You’d think there was something more exciting to find in the archives of secret organizations. Most of them are just disappointingly dull,” Tony commented, blowing dust into the middle of the room, making Pepper sneeze and smack him on the shoulder none too gently.
“Don’t try to fool us Stark,” a man said from beside Gia in a thick German accent. Tony had heard his voice before but couldn’t place it. He’d been menaced by too many up-and-coming German soldiers, Hydra goons, and SS officers. “We know there’s another gem around here. Are you telling us you didn’t find it? Fury’s little hunting hound?”
He tried to glance out of the armor and froze.
“I’m… older than five,” he said and nearly laughed. “And weird as it sounds this isn’t the weirdest thing that ever happened to me,
Captain America and Iron Man.
The names Stark and Marvels don’t even get mentioned in the explanation before the bidding begins. It seems nobody thinks this car is that big a deal and as it’s not in the best condition, it’ll go cheap. There are one or two collectors who are interested in this one of a kind car.
“I can’t explain this. I know Hydra used it to wipe out a village. They were testing it – and one moment it was all there, next moment everything was gone, everyone was dead…”
“Zemo at least saw it at some point.”
His lips were still blue.
“It's all our guys recorded.”
, he thought.
There was a drawing of a blue gem, a blue cube, a swirling something. And the note: “Cold keeps it stable. Energy can be used.”
The armor had landed on its stomach and it took too much maneuvering and a lot of strength to get the hatch far enough open to slip out. He regretted the idea of opening the hatch the moment cold air hit his face, entered his lungs – taking all breath away.
car and he is putting the money Rhodey has left for him to get it back. That’s all!
“Revenge,” Pepper suggested.
"Key?"
Tony had to look away.
But sitting in this tiny shelter he’d built with Iron Man as wall to one side of the tent to offer more protection he couldn’t do much more than stare at the man he’d brought in from the cold – not a corpse, not a ghost but a living breathing man. There was no reasonable explanation for it.
Steve stared at him before he settled down too with a questioning look in his eyes. “I hate the cold too,” Tony said, as a way of explanation.
Steve shook his head.
Hooking himself up took excruciatingly long, while outside more gunfire was sounding, soldiers were running across the ice… Then energy flowed through Iron Man’s systems, Tony stood and shrugged the tent out of the way to jump right into the middle of the fight.
he gathered snow to melt, so they'd have water, then modified a repulsor into a small heater to prepare some of the rations he’d brought. There was at least something in a can that resembled soup enough that he thought it might not do harm.
He does not stare back.
Tony tries to smile reassuringly, in the end he slides his hands around Steve's waist. "We'll keep each other warm."
Finally Tony turns around.
“I hate the cold,” Steve said quietly. “Lost good men to the cold and…”
“Are we winning?”
Steve closed the box.
“Ah,” Tony said and chuckled, pulling a stack of pictures out of the inner pocket of his jacket and put them on the table beside Pepper for both of them to look at, “I thought you’d never ask.”
“I’ll find a way to be Cap again just let me catch up, okay,” Steve said and laughed. “I don’t want to impose on my rescuer forever.”
He pulled out a map they’d taken from the castle they raided in Norway. It had old and new bases marked in different colors. Tony put his finger at a point close to the coast of Iceland. “That’s where the last transmission of Captain America came from. He said he was going to follow them to get the weapon. We know he stole a plane.” He let his finger move further north. “This is where Zemo’s old scribbled notes say Hydra found the gem hidden in a cave and that cold kept it stable. This is where the thing got mentioned for the first time nearly ninety years ago.”
Tony rolled his eyes.
It was Gia – or as her people had started calling her recently, “Madame Masque.”
“Overload the suit,” the Hydra commander ordered and Tony couldn’t get out of the grip fast enough to stop what was happening – the suit, the soldiers all around were acting at one – suddenly electricity coursed through Iron Man.
“And with as much power,” Pepper added.
"Okay," he says. "I just hate feeling useless."
He needed to build shelter, try to call Jim and Pepper, repair the armor…
Cap’s eyes widened, he opened his mouth to say something, closed it again, considered the mug in his hand, held it with both hands to stare into the liquid and warm his hands.
"Like a whole floor to live in, yeah." Tony still smiles and then looks back at what he's typing.
When he peered up in the half-light shed by the gem box he realized, Steve wasn’t angry. He was staring up, listening intently.
Captain America.
Then Steve’s arm shoots out and he pulls Tony a little closer by the elbows. “It’s good to meet you,
He gasped, screamed, he smelled burned metal, burned skin, electricity was coursing through him, he could feel his heart pound, scream, miss a beat, two…
The man had vanished more than a decade ago and he hadn't aged a day.
“You were dead frozen when I found you,” Tony replied.
Jim picked them up two days later.
“Stark? As in Howard Stark?”
Steve reached across the table to squeeze his fingers. It was a heartfelt, oddly intimate gesture and Tony stared at their touching fingers. It was odd that such a simple touch would make he cheeks heat up and his heart beat a little fast. When he looked up he caught Steve staring – not at their hands, but his face.
Tony shruggs self consciously. His eyes glaze over - that still makes Steve uncomfortable. He winces as if someone hit him in the gut. He goes pale. "Still working on it."
Up north, in the middle of the arctic ice was an old base crossed off the map.
“I’m still the best survival expert you'll be able to find,” Jim shot back, “and if you’re going to go that far north you might need that.”
“One million dollars,” he says - and Cap’s stare bores into him from across the room.
“MIA or dead? What’s the difference?” Tony asked and tried to sound indifferent.
“Cap must have gone up there to get it. Got out. Let’s say he was trying to get back to the SHIELD base…” He drew a line across the ice towards where the man’s home base had been in those days. “I only have miles and miles of ice to search.”
“Pepper? Hand me the map.”
He doesn’t look over, knows the sunglasses will hide the sudden worry in his eyes.
It was just his luck. Everything went smoothly right up until it didn’t.
“That you made steak and potatoes?” Tony asked back confused.
“We know where his mission started, where he was when he transmitted the first information about the gem. He calls it a cube at some point, by the way. He must have gotten a look at it.”
“Yeah,” Tony says.
“It was their gem,” Tony lied smoothly and let SHIELD uncover the blue gem that Gia indeed had carried with her.
But even better then to be the one to go looking for it. He’d make sure to get there first and then figure out what “it” was…
There were five.
There was a soft intake of breath and when he looked over his shoulders, Steve stared, wide-eyed shell-shocked.
Cap took note of the shield’s location instantly. Tony could see the cogs starting to move as he tried to decide how best to get his hands on it. But that wasn’t all he saw when he looked over. “A Hydra automaton.”
, his brain supplied.
Yet, he adds in his mind.
“Jim?” he asked. “Help me get Iron Man ready. I have a feeling we’ve been led on a wild goose chase. Gia isn’t in France at all. Neither is that Schmitt.”
They stare at each other in silence.
With a sudden knot in his throat, he realized – the drawing of Zemo, of Howard Stark, warped out of existence, hadn’t been of a yellow gem. They’d been of a blue gem.
Tony had tried very hard not to react or turn around to look at Steve; he’d been prepared to run out immediately. But now he looks up, sunglasses the only mask he has right now. “What do you know about that?” he asks carefully.
Tony takes a step back. “That I’m in need of a car?”
to trust this man, “maybe one drink.”
“Where?” Pepper asked and her face was pinched with the first traces of suspicion.
“Wake up man! Can you hear me? Wake up.”
“Damn,” he said, out of breath, his head spinning. “Damn, Stark, you know they hunt in packs. Did you really think you could just walk in here and not meet any resistance?”
Steve, dressed only in the spare clothes Tony had had to offer and the red boots of his now lost uniform had found a way to crawl out of the tent on the other side and approached the Hydra vehicle from the back.
“You’re SHIELD,” he whispers back defiantly.
“Could,” Tony admitted. “Wanted to. But there are other folks out there looking for me and I don’t want them on my trail.”
It’s a little harder for Tony with the new team he’s joined. He has to watch himself when he’s with the Avengers. They’ve taken a reluctant Iron Man into their fold and he’s made good friends. But some of them, Cap and Romanova especially, have strong ties with SHIELD. It’s a shame… He likes both of them. He can admit to himself, he likes Captain Rogers best of all.
“Steve Rogers,” Steve finally introduces himself, holding out a hand. “Mr…?”
Steve stared at him from under messy bangs and shivered.
. I’d heard rumours inside the agency that…”
“Move, man,” he told himself. “Can’t let him die however he survived in the first place.”
It was Jim Rhodes who asked the obvious question: “And you want us to find him now? Why?”
Then the auction he’s been waiting for starts: car, sleek, beautiful and
And Tony Stark was not someone to let a chance slip through his fingers - even if things could get dangerous down the line.
Tony dove out of the way back towards the tent and Iron Man. He only hoped there would be enough time to climb in.
Tony straightens his sunglasses. They are a little out of place indoors but making him look mysterious in his new and fancy three piece Tom Ford suit. He may be Anthony Jarvis on paper, but he’s still Tony Stark and knows how to put on a show.
“Huh,” Tony said. “By now you’d think I’d sound more like Jarvis. And in all honesty, my dad wasn't very interested in history or archaeology.”
“Found anything else interesting?”
The truth was: Yes, he’d thought it’d be that easy.
“Fun,” Pepper remarked. “And you want to go alone and leave us?”
“I’m my heroes hero,” Tony realized and laughed. “You can stay as long as you want or need. You saved my life as well, you know?”
He hadn’t dared at first to touch the body more than necessary, afraid he’d
Iron Man was on his back, the hatch was open.
Fury shrugged as if he didn’t care much whether Captain America was dead or alive and gave Tony a long look that conveyed clearly that he considered this an order – not an optional mission. “Captain America is listed as MIA. Never found the body. Assume there wasn’t much left to find.”
Pepper smacked his shoulder again. “I promised Jarvis that this wasn’t another suicide mission. Don’t turn me into a liar.”
A yellow glow was engulfing Steve and himself and all he could see was Steve leaning over him patting his cheek to make sure he was alive.
It sounded like a thing Pepper would think of.
“Give us the gem.” Gialetta Nefaria appeared on a vehicle, the expressionless jade mask that had become her face making her seem even more like a ghost in this white desert.
"You got the key," Tony remarks without looking up. He doesn't sound cold or bitter - only tired. "I wasn't sure you'd use it."
Jim smiled back.
It must be a trick played on him by his always active imagination he thought, rubbed at his eyes. There was no time to waste after all… But there was something.
"Yours," is written on the envelope in Tony's scrawly handwriting.
The man shivered.
With his “improved” mechanical hear he could keep the armor flying for hours and hours but sooner or later the human being inside needed to sleep. It took him two days to get into range to start his search and by then Hydra was already sweeping the area. He got into a skirmish with a drone army of sixteen Zemo made drones that could match his firepower and managed to escape only by the skin of his teeth and with heavy damage to the armors propulsion unit.
Tony backtracked and realized what he’d said, wondering what the man was remembering or not remembering about the time he’d lost.
They hunted an operative called Schmidt across Northern Europe, nearly got crushed by a collapsing old castle in Norway, ended up in Victor von Dooms dungeon, before stealing a plane to follow Gia to France. For a while, the trail went cold again.
“Kill him,” she ordered, “get Stark!”
Then Tony peers at him over the rim of his sunglasses, smiles - never even slowing the furious typing - and adds: "It's your key."
again. And even more than that, he’s Iron Man - again.
“Too obvious if we all go at the same time.”
From where Tony was standing he only saw the sphere of the shield fly towards the first soldier, take down two before bouncing back. Machine guns started firing, Gia shouted – someone ordered: “Drones! Now! Get Stark!”
“You want to follow Hydra?” Jim asked uneasily. “You know you’re still top of their death list.”
Tony couldn’t hear a thing. But he noticed that the light around the box had started flickering, blue, yellow, orange, green. Something was odd. It was like the box was reacting to something.
He heard Gia on the field screaming – and managed to rip a drone’s head off, threw it to the side.
"Place? Like an apartment?"
Fury gave him a once over, shrugged his shoulders, patted him on the back – and pretended that he believed that there was nothing more to know. It was an unspoken deal that they could accept the lines drawn into the sand right until things exploded. So all the general had to do was bide his time and wait until Tony’s secrets revealed himself.
“Yeah.”
“It’s worth much more,” Steve said, “when you know who built it.”
He shrugged. “You’d be surprised what you learn when you’re looking for Atlantis.”
It had a nice ring to it.
“You know, Pepper’s right, you’re too damn cocky. Superior Iron Man? What are you a dawdling villain like Doom?” he muttered to himself, while he tried to get free of the cockpit.
Steve wants to snap.
. But he was ready to jump right back in - make new
It’s a stupid situation. He doesn’t want to walk away from this, he doesn’t want to lead Steve on… He pulls off the glasses and holds out the other hand to let Steve shake it. “Anthony Jarvis.”
"To the Tower. You've got your own place there whenever you need it?"
This isn't the last chapter just so y'all know, there's probably going to just be one or two more. This is spreading out a lot more than I thought it would so who knows?
“I do. Do you want to talk about it?”
“Tony?” Steve can’t even hold back his smile.
“Tony- are you drunk?” Steve asks, face pinching in disgust.
He falls back onto the floor, knocking a few things on his desk over. Oil spills over the circuit board and the desk creating a huge mess. He sighs looking at it spread. Then a second knock comes and he flinches again.
“Yeah maybe.” Bucky nods. Thinking about how the man never actually looked Bucky in the eyes. It was while he was pacing he figured that out. He was trying to remember every detail about his soulmate down to the color of his eyes, but that’s when he realized he didn’t know, because Tony had always looked down. At first, he looked to his pockets, then he looked at the weights. Even after they’d touched, Tony looked to his hand, and his own soulmark and ran off. “Maybe he’s shy.”
“You saw the way he reacted to your arm. He liked it, he wanted to touch and look at it. I could see the look in his eye. He wanted to do more but held back. There’s no machine on me. I’m crap with technology, and with people. I break everything. Who would want that burden? There’s no off switch for me. There no technical difficulty that an engineer might be able to fix. I’m stuck like this, the freak. You have a metal arm, but I’m forever changed on the inside. How could he want that?”
“Why?” Bucky parrots the question back at him, a disbelieving chuckle on the end of it.
“Not even in the hand?”
“Good. My name is Nebula, and we just became best friends.”
“Not a single clue. But they might be working on that in Wakanda. Everyone was talking about moving forward and giving up.”
“I’m sorry, am I not allowed to make comments about an apartment we are literally in? Can I not ask questions? You asked if he had roommates. Why is what I said so bad?”
“He’s all yours Thor.” You squeeze the Infinity Stones in your hand, turning away from the bright flashes of lightning and thunder, and the sounds of gunshots as the fighting resumes. This time, without the stones Thanos will lose.
“No.” Tony shook his head. “I can’t sleep here. I need-” Jarvis, he needs Jarvis to lock all the doors, to make sure he’s alone, and watch over him while he sleeps. “I can’t sleep unless I’m home.”
Thanos considers him for a moment. “Then I suppose it would be mercy to put you down.” He lifts the gantlet and the Infinity stones shine, humming power brightly. A power shoots right for Thor and he smiles. The beam goes right through him, and the illusion of him crackles and fades out. Thanos looks in confusion before he spins around sensing something behind him.
“I ordered pizza.” He explains when they both look to the door confused. He quickly walks over talking a mile a minute. “I didn’t know if you’d be hungry, and I don’t really have anything in the fridge, and even if I did, I don’t really know what you like. But if you don’t like pizza you obviously don’t have to eat it. It won’t hurt my feelings or anything. Not that you have to worry about my feelings!”
“I asked if you had any roommates.”
Tony rolls his eyes at himself. Mercenaries? That’s a bit extreme. Even for Killian. Tony takes another breath, and slowly unlocks the door. Three clicks and they all feel like a mistake. Slowly he pulls it open. Just a crack, regretting not getting that chain lock. Then again, he never intended on opening the door for strangers. First thing first after this, he’s getting that chain lock.
Tony sits at a huge table with a holographic display, wokring on something that looks like another suit.
"It's not cold in here," Steve says.
“Get the gem!” the man by her side corrected that order and Tony nearly laughed.
He’d only brought one single sleeping bag, so he covered the person who must be Steve Rogers –
“I…” Suddenly his throat is dry. “What?”
They watch each other guardedly for way too long, then Steve finally musters up the courage to walk up to Tony, right into his space - and kiss him.
Just from a few minutes out in the cold, his fingers were starting to hurt and he made sure to get them in the gloves he’d brought.
“Who?”
“Well, at the source obviously. Hydra had the thing, Hydra lost the thing, Hydra’s trying to find the thing now. Wasn't that what Fury said?”
Tony had been busy.
"Used it to figure out where you were," Tony says, still not looking at him. "You keep it switched on."
Tony blinked. “Would you prefer I get you a job? I can think of things for you to do if you're bored. Would you want to work as… secretary? You could help Pepper…”
“You look at the places we should be going. I make sure I record all the places we’ve been.” She smiled and pushed a strand of hair behind her ear.
Tony took a page of a paper that they’d used to wrap some of the rations in. It was French but what mattered wasn’t the news – it was the date.
“I take offense at being compared to murderous bastards. That’s Iron Man. Or actually, I am Iron Man. Nice to meet you, Cap. You might want to cover your…” Tony gestured up and down until Captain America blinked, looked down at himself, realized he wasn’t exactly modest right now, seeing as he was wearing a uniform that had become rotting rags and was barely held together by a thread. It barely covered anything at this point.
Captain America and Iron Man make a good team and not just because they both are out to stomp out Hydra once and for all… It’s more. It’s easy to talk to Steve, easy to feel at ease with him.
He set off a missile – his last one to get rid of one more drone and Steve was moving again using the momentum of the explosion to jump up on the war vehicle, getting soldiers out of the way as if it was nothing. The Gia cackled, from the vehicle a hulking robot emerged like a monster and the hand smacked down, threatening to flatten Steve.
Iron Man had the superior sensors and the superior firepower, currently still the superior energy source – and the best damn pilot.
“Hi,” someone says in the foyer and Tony immediately knows it’s Cap again. “You bought the car. I hope you know it’s…”
“Thanks, my limbs feel like they’re on fire actually. Who are you? What’s Iron Man? A code name?”
“How?”
Tony continued to eat his eggs, phone resting on his knee he felt renewed with purpose, anxious purpose, but with a flutter of something in his chest. For once he lets himself think this might be alright. He imagined it. Him, Bucky, Steve, all coexisting, happy, here in this lonely apartment. A smile ghosts on his face at the thought.
“No.” Bucky shakes his head. “It’s like- it’s like anxiety?”
Or parents to curl up with and protect him when he’s scared.
He moved eventually, but just in time to save his head from getting torn to pieces by the train as his arm had.
“Oh. Well, someone wanted you to know they were here.”
“Is it Tony?”
“Let me put the popcorn in the microwave.”
Eventually, your mom has to step out of the room and change your brother. Tony goes with her probably to keep giving her reassurances since she won't stop crying.
You didn’t answer. How could you with all the screaming and pain.  But something happened in the palm of your hand, a bright light that burned hot. The creature had screamed at that. Unhooking its tongue from your arm and running as if you’d hurt it somehow. You looked at your palm in confusion light fading immediately, and Stephens' voice came back along with all the others in the background.
“Can I kiss you?” The question comes out in a whisper and Bucky sounds breathless but this close it’s perfectly clear to hear, and just for a single second Tony feels like he can’t breathe himself.
.” Stephens' voice comes through again, it’s been a while since he spoke to you. This has only been going on for about two days but he went from telling you every single move you needed to make to…. Just side comments to complain about Tony. He hadn’t even warned you about that creature that almost killed you. Only after, telling you to hide.  He said that there were mistakes that needed to be made, blood that needed to be spilled.
Bucky probably would feel bad about using that to help smooth the conversation along, but when he sees the tension in Tony’s shoulders relax, he doesn’t care what it took to get him back to that. Tony chuckles lightly.
Only she turned into the kiss, and he wasn’t prepared for that. Quickly he recovered and kissed her back, deepening it. Everything was going well, except he was still holding her hand. With them standing face to face now and so close it was in an awkward position and not thinking, he moved quickly and with a lot more force than he meant to.
He looks down at the gauntlet. It’s well worn, burned and curled by the power of the stones. It’s still mostly intact, not that he’s worried. He’s won. There is no more use for it. It is simply time for the universe to thrive in the balance he’s created.
Bucky stumbles back, almost losing balance before catching himself.
He snaps his head to the side, tearing their lips from one another, and pushing at Bucky’s still bare chest just narrowly missing catching his chin with a balled hand.
You didn’t hesitate to listen, reaching for the boy and picking him up with your uninjured hand you ran into the nearest store you could find, closing the door behind you and hiding under the counter.
Tony hums, nodding, looking the arm over.
Tony screamed as his heart was torn from his chest.
Steve had been trying to balance keeping up the conversation while maintaining full focus and control of his body. Not making sudden movements, and definitely not breaking the cup or plate Tony handed him. He’d silently been taking deep breathes to keep calm and just not break anything. He didn’t want to ruin this, especially not for Bucky too. Who he knows despite his uncanny ability to try and flirt, he’s still nervous.
Tony, despite the layers of clothes, realized that he was shivering too.
"Of course," Steve says and doesn't elaborate whether he means,
“You should get in your machine,” Steve whispered at him.
Tony nearly choked on his own spit. “I’m not… This is not… Oh god, Captain America, you lost a bit of time out here in the ice. I’m
Nobody had anything to say to that. They sat together between dusty folders in silence. Then Jim straightened his shoulders: “Alright then. I’m game. How do we find Hydra if we can't find the last resting place of Captain America?”
"Oh," Tony whsipers into the kiss. "Carol and Thor are on the way."
There’s that glint in Steve’s azure eyes that says he’s figuring out the tactical advantages he can use in a fight. Right now, it puts Tony on edge…
Then he pointed at the box and at Steve.
stories for Tony Stark and Iron Man alike.
How was that possible?
Tony was still staring. “Take it one step at a time,” he suggested, but Steve was already leaning in to brush a kiss against his lips. It was oddly chaste for two grown men who’d seen so much of life. Tony was at a loss for words.
“Hey, soldier, Fury’s your boss now - not me. You’re our liaison officer and pilot, remember?”
Jim and Pepper looked up. “Where’s she then?”
“That’s why I brought down their plane, so this wouldn’t get back to their base… They were planning to unleash its power on the world.”
There were priorities in an oncoming snowstorm, more priorities when you had someone with potential pneumonia with you. So, he tried to keep busy, tried to keep his priorities straight, and ignore his own doubts. Instead, he tried to look at the damaged armor and to fix the immediate problems.
“Not much to go on, is it?”
“What are you writing, Ms. Potts?”
Cap kept staring at him with narrowed eyes. Currently, it looked as if he was trying to decide what to believe.
Captain America? He'd met him once.
“Hello,” Tony said with a calm he wasn’t feeling and pointed at the shield. “You really are him, right? Captain America?”
“Animal?” Tony whispered back.
“So?” Pepper asked and looked from Tony to Jim. “That’s all we got? Nothing more tangible after we spent hours here looking for clues”
It’s become easier to live this new life, discover how far humanity has come in these decades he has missed. He admits - for all he’s lost, he enjoys it - being here, learning new things, pushing whole new boundaries.
But there was the man, lying on his back, sleeping bag rising and falling softly with the rhythm of his breathing, and the shield leaning against Iron Man. There was also that eerily glowing box sitting in the middle of the tent that Tony had tried to ignore until now.
. But the dead limbs had started to warm up, the fingers had started moving though – and it was all just unbelievable and fantastic.
“First and foremost, I’m an Avenger,” Cap reassures him. “I owe SHIELD. But I don’t owe them other people’s secrets. They certainly didn’t tell me you were more than a rumour…”
And that was when all hell broke loose.
“What?” she asked.
“I already have a job, I think,” Steve whispered, “protecting that gem we didn’t tell anyone about, protecting my secret – and you.”
He acted on instinct.
"I know."
He was ready for a new adventure.
They’d not shared any adventures recently and this was familiar ground that all of them had missed.
“Oh,” he breathed out.
He held out the cup with the soupy stuff and offered: “It’ll warm you up some. Didn’t bring enough rations for two though and…”
He didn’t know why.
It wasn’t an expression he’d ever thought he’d see on someone like Captain America – not that he’d imagined ever seeing an expression on the face of Captain America in this day and age.
Now he can go and put it back into shape.
"Okay," Steve whsipers softly and returns the embrace. Tony must feel the cold worse then he does - he's only wearing a dress shirt and jeans and is currently unable to call on the armor. He leans in to press a soft kiss against Tony's lips. It's warm.
“Who are you?” Gia shouted.
“Not going without preparation,” Jim interjected and got his feet. He had the determined look that said: “I’m going to help you doing something stupid. Don’t make it my fault when it goes wrong.” “I’ll get you with a plane. Make sure you’re alive by then,” he muttered while he started to gather rations, tools, things he might need and would be able to carry in the Iron Man suit.
“There’s no way your soulmate is better than my soulmate.” Bucky declares.
“It would seem so.” Loki smiles. “That ax really must have done a number. Who knew destiny could bleed.” Loki taunts, adding a laugh at the end. Thor laughs along too.
“We could help clean up around here,” Natasha suggests, she’s already started while the others worked on the ship. Shuri’s already done so much, rebuilding the barrier around Wakanda where it’s damaged, and they’ve gone around doing a death count and missing count. Natasha even took the time to inform Okoye about you and what’s going on back in New York. The bit of hope in her eyes flashed only for a moment before she gave a more guarded stance. Now knowing the feeling of defeat no one seems ready to put their hopes and dreams all in again.
“Steve-”
“Is it?”
That's how they worked. They fit each other in times of tragedy. Helping them see the light and keep moving. They also just understood each other. Made up for what the other lacked, they could always lean on each other. Steve’s right. If Bucky had to share anything as important as a soulmate with someone, he’d want it to be with Steve.
“Yeah.” You nod, they’d been in your head for the past two days. You’d like to put some names to the faces.
“Where is he?” Steve asks, and Bucky sighs, deflating a little.
But this isn’t annoying in the slightest. This is amazing. The only other person who touches the arm is Steve, and that’s only sometimes, maybe accidentally, or sometimes trying to help with the pains by relieving the pressure, or helping him stretch when he’s tired.
It’s the people close to him that can really cut him deep.
“I love a challenge.”
“I think it was in the news a few years ago, Tony's the only one right now with two soul-bonds at least as far as we're aware.”
“I guess that makes sense,” Tony says, but he’s not sure how he feels about it. Relieved? Or maybe even more afraid. He’s lost his only out, although he’s not entirely sure he actually wanted the out. He would try to analyze it but he should probably sleep before doing that.
So, no, the running away wasn’t expected, but catching some guy about to brain himself on the bench press also wasn’t what he imagined either. Life isn’t perfect, no one needs to tell Bucky that, every twinge of pain in his metal arm tells him that. Now all he wants is a do-over, a second chance, and he’s going to fucking look good, so Steve can shove it with his advice of not worrying or caring.
He turns to them and suddenly it felt like his living room was too small. Not enough options for seating as his two soulmates stood there, once again waiting for him to take the lead.
“Steve was supposed to come alone.” You start. “You guys are supposed to be with Thor.”
“What are you trying to say?”
A vacation. She had told him. That Tony said he needed a vacation and he didn’t know when he’d be back. No one cared. Tony kept sending in designs from wherever and he’s an adult.
“Tony… what if…”
“So why don’t your soulmates know who you are?”
“What in the world happened?” he asks, looking up to Steve and Bucky. The two are wide-eyed and standing freakishly still.. They give each other a look, but don’t move otherwise. “Are you breathing?” He asks eventually because he doesn’t want them to pass out.
Tony: Whenever the two of you are free
He’s standing in front of the door bouncing on the heels of his feet lightly waiting. Feeling the nerves build. “S-should I cook?” Suddenly bursts out his mouth, a million thoughts and that one broke free. He looks up to the ceiling as he asks. “I need to offer food, right? That's what people do.”
“I guess that’s true.” Tony sighs, stopping a moment and leaning against the building next to them, clutching the bandages over his stitches. They ache like hell, but he’s happy they haven’t reopened yet. “Maybe you should go ahead. Come back when you’ve got Y/n.”
“He is among the ones we lost.” Wong isn’t a man of many expressions, but he manages to look sad at the words. Only serving to confuse Steve more.
“Finding someone else.”
“Okay.” She settles with that for now. She’s heard his voice and can accept small victory’s, one day at a time. The elevator stops on her floor, and she heads for her office, suddenly reminded of Killian's phone call. “Oh. While I have you, I wanted you to know, Killian called me, he wanted me to ask you that you take your medication. He’s really worried about you, and he at the very least wants you to not get off track any more than you already are.”
“Yeah.” Just as Tony snaps the last sensor in place Bucky lifts his arm so the metal fingers brush over his cheek. “Your face is warm.”
“My heart it’s beating fast, and I feel like every inch of me is vibrating. But I’m not actually scared, or worried. It’s like being scared because someone near you is clearly scared.”
Running away? No, that was new.
Bucky wakes up at eight that morning, and he’s surprised. He only got home at five and ended up falling asleep at six. He’s nowhere near rested, yet he feels wide awake, on edge even. His heart racing in his chest causes him to sit up and try to balance himself.
“I’m not sure how far the hospital is, or if anyone’s even going to be there when we get there.” You comment. It takes you wonder about how the rest of the population has been handling all of this.
“He has two soul marks Bucky. I touched him and- and my marks changed.” Steve looks down again. Following Bucky’s pinched gaze.
Despite himself, Tony smiled.
“I’m not sure. You can ask Stephen, he was specific that things need to be learned in the right order or it might mess things up. Something to do with the Time Stone and seeing the future.”
“I wouldn’t call them that. More like burdens.” Steve slid his hands down his legs, comforting himself, nerves rising. “Are you- are you scared of me? I understand if you are, I hurt you. I’m so sorry, and I’m sorry we lied about the counter, I was just so scared, and Bucky stepped up. I don’t want to be like this, I try so hard to control it.”
“Uh no.” Steve shakes his head. “We’ve known each other since we were kids. We went to high school together and we live together.”
“Okay, I'll be back as soon as the lab is open.”
Well, never again.
“Not you.” The grip on his shoulders tighten. And Thor finally feels filled with something other than rage. As it was the only thing keeping him going. “Not before me. Too much I have lost, and you are the only thing I’ve left. Do not leave me stranded with nothing to lose again. I fear I could not survive it.”
“Oh yeah.” Bucky says, reaching into the bag, and pull out the popcorn handing it over. He pulls off the plastic wrapping and throws the bag into the microwave, Jarvis starts the machine up for him and he turns around to the bodybuilders taking up his entryway with their broad shoulders. He doesn’t exactly want to spend the next three minutes in silence save for the sound of popping, so he decides to take the opportunity.
He heard a faint buzz from somewhere in his room and paused all movement. Just listening. “What was that?”
You’d only made it about six blocks before you saw something strange. It was a shoe, right in the middle of the street. Why it was so strange you didn’t know at first. After all, a lot of things were abandoned and left behind. There were several cars still on and engines running.
It could be that he overcompensated on drama, he picked a too stressed situation and made it worse. Because Tony ran. Which wasn’t new. Tony always ran in some form or another. Ran back into his mind, ran from the press, ran from being himself. It was a deep hate buried within the heart of Tony’s chest, and it beat poison into his veins along with blood. Hateful words of doubt and shame.
Bucky: Sorry If I bothered you. I just wanted to talk.
Tony wakes up about three hours later. He’s feeling groggy, and there’s a feeling of cotton in his mouth. Something he’s only ever gotten from being drugged. So he makes an educated guess there. He moves to sit up, hissing lowly, at the pain in his side. He gently moves now, more aware of it, and throws a blanket off his torso. His chest bare, and he has a clear view of bruising and stitches along the lower side of his abdomen.
“Who’s Thor?”
“I know.” Tony agreed. “My parents were far from perfect.” What little he remembers of before anyway.
A quiet dark question filled his mind.
“Huh.” So, it wasn’t Monday either. Had he slept for a day straight? He laughs at that thought. Like he’d ever more than a few hours. He’ll get decent sleep when he’s dead, which is bound to happen soon if he doesn’t eat. “When’s the last time I ate?”
“No, no, I’m fine I just… is it going to hurt? You taking it apart?”
“You know how it is, with people in these circles.” Stephen rolled his eyes. “He'll get the same privacy as Natasha.” He leaned against the door. “So how exactly do you know Tony?”
And we've come to our final chapter! I really enjoyed writing this and getting all of your feedback, this has been one of my favorite stories to write, and it was the first thing I've started since Infinity War, and I can honestly say I feel a lot better know.  (Mostly because I've decided all the characters are alive and have continued to write them as such) I hope that you all feel the same way! <3 <3 <3
Tony snaps his head up, ugh, he’s spaced out again.
A man’s voice comes in.
“Sounds very through,” Steve says carefully, honestly, it sounds like someone’s seriously paranoid or worried something bad was going to happen. Last time Tony did that, there was Ultron.
“You’re just saying that,” Bucky yells back out from his closet. “I can’t find my glove.”
“Okay, step back.” He says, bracing himself, and you do too, taking several steps back, and beginning to crouch.
“And the voices? Did he choose your brain to be the satellite to pick up on them? Where are they even? Another planet? Heaven? Hell?”
“Not true big guy.” Tony shakes his head. “The only one I don’t need a break from is you.” Dum-E chirps quietly from the corner and Tony smiles. “You too, Dum Dum. You two always have my back.”
But the temperature is what makes him uneasy.
A hand caught him by the back of the head and held him in place.
A round metal thing shimmered beneath the surface.
But so good to know they won't have to wait here until the Quinjet becomes a refigerator.
"Might take you up on it," Steve says, throat slightly dry.
Cap promptly sat down and glared and shivered.
puts him and Sam on edge.
Iron Man was there before the giant hand could come down, stood in front of the new machine.
trust Cap, he
Distracting.
“Not the box,” Steve replied, “what’s inside it.”
“That’s why you went after them…”
“Tony,” he said, “I think I know how I survived.” He snatched the gem out of thin air. “But let’s get away from here first.”
Steve turned to follow his gaze. The gem was hovering above Steve’s shoulder and around them, the scene had frozen. All the soldiers, Gia, the Hydra commander were frozen in place, caught in the moment as if painted. Even bullets that had been about to hit hung in the air unmoving, explosions looked like giant unfolding flowers that had simply reach their peak, snowflakes had stopped in front of his eyes. “How is...”
“Hydra,” Tony said under his breath.
Steve’s way ahead of him there and he just grins - friendly, the way he grins at Thor when they’re bantering during a fight. “Friends,” he says and smiles. “Everyone can use a friend, right? Want to eat something? There’s a nice place not far from here - maybe not as fancy as your suit, but… good food.”
“Who are you?”
It looked like he'd found what remained of Captain America.
Tony blinked, tried to chase that memory, and vaguely remembered something along those lines. He nodded, cheeks heating up, cleared his throat. “Steve,” he tried again, “do you think this has something to do with what happened to you?”
"Thank you," Steve says. "For reaching out."
“What…?” he gasped, air filling his lungs suddenly, painfully, his hear burned the way he felt too many times before – but he was alive and the fighting had stopped.
He couldn't properly lift-off anymore, but Iron Man still was a force to be reckoned with.
adventures and Happy Hogan, the chief editor and former boxing champion, had explained to him, that all his “Tony Stark Adventures” are too pulpy, not modern enough.
Spinning through the air without a chance to catch himself he only aimed to get as far away as possible before the last of the power gave out. He left a trail of smoke behind that would give away his location if he wasn’t careful – but before he could worry about it too much he crashed headfirst into the ice below.
“Come on,” Steve teases and he grins at Tony. “You outbid me fair and square. I had to ask a friend for a loan even to attempt to go that high and… I just think it should be in the Smithsonian’s Iron Man Collection.”
“You sure talk like Howard.”
Steve nodded, grabbed the box.
Tony was inclined to agree, but he also knew what happened when things went smooth for a while when he’d allowed himself to get too comfortable… He rolled to his feet – and at that very moment outside a familiar voice sounded across the ice: “Tony Stark, we know your Iron Man toy is damaged. We know the gem is with you. Give it to us and you’ll live for a long, long time.”
The wind howled in his ears and over his head and he looked up to see if there was anything that would help him build a shelter when he looked right at one big block of ice that he had knocked free in his fall. Something was glimmering red inside.
“You saved me,” he heard Steve say, crouching behind him, just at the moment when Tony realized he wasn’t facing a giant drone – but another suit of armor with power enough to crush Iron Man if he let himself be caught like he just had… He tried to get away, felt the servos in the right arm screech before the metal started bending.
Bluer even than his stunning blue eyes.
“Ah,” Steve said. “I thought so. You’re a Tony Stark collector, too?”
Then everything stopped.
“What do you mean, go look for Captain America? He died during the last Great War.”
He silently pondered that.
“You can read that?”
Those few SHIELD agents think he’s a relic from the past - and he plays the role well on purpose when they come by to see how he’s doing, try to ask him unsubtle questions about the new hero called Iron Man, and about how he’s adjusting.
“How does that help us?” Pepper asked and looked back at the map, but as soon as she had asked the question both she and Jim saw it themselves.
“I’m sure,” Tony said softly and looked at Steve. He held a finger against his lips indicating that they were not going to speak anymore. Hydra had technology that sometimes even took him by surprise. Whoever had taken over for the old Zemo, he knew his stuff. There was no telling how Gia had found him and how well they could hear what was going on in the tent. Tony mouthed: “They don’t know you’re here. Stay back.”
Captain America seemed impressed – and he looked much more comfortable in clothes, even clothes that barely fit him. He was only a few inches taller than Tony but he had a broader chest and arms that made it look like the shirt would rip with the first hasty movement.
"Welcome home," Tony says, watching him cautiously.
“Or all of us,” Tony admitted. “Of course it is about that. I don’t want to end up the next Zemo, I don’t want to end up shot dead by a collaborator getting lucky one nice spring night in New York, or dying in snake pit with the last thing I see being Gia’s ugly mask. We have to stop all this - one way or the other.”
Tony laughs. It’s been a while since anyone had indicated they’d even read any of the original Tony Stark Adventures.
He kissed Tony again, relieved.
It's another unmarked key card. There's no Stark brand logo stamped on it this time. Steve has a feeling he knows the door that can be opened with it.
He looked back, saw the shape of a man that had fallen out of the broken ice, covered now by snow.
Nobody knows who is in the new flashy red and gold armor. Nobody knows that Stark-Rhodes Tech is funding him. Only a handful of SHIELD agents know that Anthony Edward Jarvis is Tony Stark.
He’d brushed shoulders with resistance fighters, agents, a Latverian despot and his not always loyal underlings, and most recently an enticing Russian spy who called herself the Black Widow. Fury thought he had all the threads in his hands and could use them to keep Tony come back for information but Tony had long started to build his own adventurers' network across the world – and across all sides of this war.
Tony's hand is on his back though. "It's going to be fine. We'll be out in a few hours."
“Zemo soon,” the man replied and grinned, knowing exactly how to get to him. He had an uncomfortable toad-like smile that made him look a lot less handsome than before.
… and along the lines find an answer to what had happened to Captain America and tell the hero's final story. It felt like something they all to owed to the legacy of an incredible man like that.
Now he’s panicking.
The answer to that is a definite no. Keeping his eyes open is a struggle enough, he didn’t even have the strength to get himself upright, walking is a no go, Tony says as much with a shake of his head.
“Or you know, just, the calm
He’s got three regulars, and a new name for today, all in all, it’s good. Might have a lot of free time if he wraps up quickly. Go home early and talk to Bucky before he heads out for the night shift.
“Yeah!” Bucky smiles. “I met my soulmate!” He yells as if it’s just hitting him all over again.
“Y/n.” Tony begins. “This is your mom and brother.”
“You guess?” Bucky laughs. “It went great. A hiccup or two, but Tony said he wants to see us again. He gave us his number. What about that leaves you feeling rejected?”
Who knows, the accords might have worked, they might have flopped and been rejected by literally every other enhanced or alien being in the universe and everything could have been fine. No one knows, because the Accords didn’t even matter, they weren’t Steve’s main focus. It was for Bucky, he fought for Bucky.
When the answer doesn’t come he looks up to the ceiling. “Jarvis?” He asks, and almost immediately he remembers muting him. That’s why he didn’t get a warning about the door.
Tony continues eating his jello, face pointed into it as if he wanted to dive in and escape the conversation, but while Stephen promised not to tell anyone else, he was going to ask Tony this question.
Thanos yells out as they all begin attacking, and a red light bursts from the gauntlet. The ground beneath everyone begins to shake, changing. Everything becomes hilled and uneven. It breaks away under everyone except you and Thanos, they all fall down hundreds of feet, the hulk moving quickly, jumping between bits of hilled columned ground collecting and catching everyone he can while you’re left alone topside with him.
So, he quickly stood turning off the faucet and left the bathroom.
“No!” Steve stood from his bed. “Are you crazy? He’s your soulmate. If you think it’s going to be weird that you followed him to his apartment, it’s only going to double when he realizes you sent me instead of coming yourself.”
Bruce sighs. “I’m going to take a walk, help on the look-out for survivors who may be injured.”
He’d yell as if running wasn’t something every kid could do. But she would only smile at him just as brightly as he smiled at her, giving back that same energy because it was a miracle to them.
“Yeah.” Steve claps Bucky on the shoulder, smiling fondly. Tony tries to ignore the ache in his chest at the sight of it. He feels like he’s intruding in on their moment, on their lives, all he can think of is what Killian said years ago.
“Oh uh… how can I help?”
“You sure giving him so much sugar will help?”
“You will.” Tony whispers. “You’ll regret everything you gave up to wait, and you’ll regret finding me.” The words spill out of Tony like a flood that he can’t control, not that he feels he should, it’s true. He knows it’s true. He’s too damaged, too broken, too many things going around in his brain, too much past to pack away and move on from. He’s not stable, he’s not happy, he’s not even free. Not of his demons, not of Killian, not of himself.
“I could have brought you water.” Steve rolls his eyes, moving around to the kitchen, looking for a bottled water, and when he doesn’t find any he gets some straight from the tap in a cup. “Here.”
“And you couldn’t have saved yourself?”
You smile up at the woman. “Was your son lost in the stone with everyone?” You ask, smiling at him as he looks you in the eyes and responds with a toothless giggle.
The apartment’s clean, the movie rented, Steve and Bucky were handling the snacks. So, all that was left for him to do was wait. He sucked at waiting. Constantly on the edge, waiting for them to arrive. His phone vibrates in his pocket, and he nearly jumps out of his skin, not used to having it on him so often.
Steve and Bucky share a look over Tony’s head, both conveying how much they didn’t believe him without words.
Tony’s got a hand slapped over his mouth his face tingling from the kiss still, and his eyes are firmly looking to the ground, too scared to look at Bucky, worried he might see Killian standing in his place.
However, the pain remained.
This plan was doomed to fail at some point right? He couldn’t stay hidden from Killian forever, the world. Pepper and Rhody are out there, waiting for him to come home. He misses them. Killian. Tony wasn’t sure how Killian would feel, or what he’d do. There wasn’t anything Tony could do to stop him, whatever he should decide.
He was on his feet, nearly taking one of the already strained tent poles with him and his eyes shone with fury.
By evening Captain America seemed to trust Tony enough to come out of his sulking. “Can you call for help?”
It was warm enough with both of them in the tent, but as soon as he stopped moving the cold crept in. He sat with his back to Steve, tried to figure out where they were exactly on the small map he had.
“Cold,” he said out loud while he looked at the map Pepper was scribbling notes on while they were sitting in an inadequate tent in a gloomy forest, listening to the rain drumming against the canvas.
Jim shrugged. “It’s a lead.”
“The snow has stopped. There’s someone out there.”
It’s been a tough few months, adjusting, catching up to this new day and age. He’s been called a lot of things, and it’s nice to know that he was remembered after the war even though he’d been presumed dead. It’s nice that people still think of him as a hero. He discovered there’s a whole comics line that bears his name these days… Published by the Marvels foundation. None of it are
They are safe. It's not cold in here, Steve tells himself but he keeps pacing, glancing at the surface temperature of the Quinjet now and then as it inches towards 0°F.
Tony had shrugged and grinned. All the stories, as outrageous as they seemed, had been
Steve was staring at her, challenging, not the least bit cowed by all the guns that were pointed at him.
He got to his feet, took a step closer, realized he was looking at a hand in the snow… a human hand, grasping a gray box with odd markings that were glowing eerily blue. He fell back, stunned, stared at the ice beside him.
* * *
He should be worrying about other things... Life support. Oxygen.
“That I’m freeloading at your home?”
Tony furrowed his brow. He’d stumbled over rumors of the secret missions Cap had been sent on, knew a little more now about Hydra and their secret operations, and about how they’d set an eye on Howard Stark before the end of the war. It was easy to imagine Hydra would have wanted to get their hands on the world’s only super soldier…
Tony winks at him and sounds like he means it, too.
he said. We met once. Right before Christmas, I think, brought home dad and Jarvis and I was really excited to meet you.”
The letter reaches him at the front desk of a dingy hotel in Chile and just the fact that someone
Steve only wishes for it but doesn't really expect him to.
Steve looks back at the non-descript little plastic thing that is a key to home he hasn't even seen yet.
He normally hears it filtered through the armor’s audio system.
“I’ll be damned,” Tony said out loud and scrabbled up to start digging frantically with his hands to get at the man in the layers of freezing death. Despite the snow, despite the broken armor or Hydra at his heels, right now there was nothing more important than getting at him.
“And he’s staying.”
Jim looked up. “Everyone seems to describe its shape differently. That’s uncanny, boss, isn’t it?”
The hammer comes down, once, twice, three times.
"Not from Nat," Sam warns.
Three days and one Quinjet flight later, he gets to use the card. The remoddeling of the Avenger's Compound has concluded and everything looks very different.
"Hey." Suddenly Tony is there, touches his arm. "Can't get the Quinjet up in the air and out of this ice but distress beacon is working. Extremis could connect with the Stark satelite."
? You’re joking! Tony can’t be older than five.”
Just like the box said.
* * *
“Down,” he warned, and Steve dove behind a car that had followed the war machine. He unleashed a beam of fire to torch anything that got in his way. A drone grabbed his armor and he had to stop, finding himself engaged in uncomfortable hand to hand.
“That’s impossible,” Cap announced after staring at it for a long time. He was still more naked than dressed and sitting on top of the sleeping bag, shivering every now and again.
Tony pointed at the armor, then slipped his boots on, took his jacket. Only when he was fully prepared for the cold did he take a deep breath and counted to ten. He only got to six, before Gia called for him again and he stepped out, letting the tent flap snap to the side dramatically, snow crushing in on him before he was fully out.
None of them would have made it very far fighting HYDRA in trenches.
“You’ve been doing what you’ve been doing recently for other reasons, Tony. Don't lie.”
Cap’s eyes narrowed. “They’re still…”
“As long as you’ll have me.”
. It's a little of both.
Tony has so far purposefully avoided ever going there. This is
“Yours,” Tony tells Steve after the third time they meet on the Hellicarrier to coordinate clean-up after the Chitauri attack. Steve's not quite sure what he's looking at as Tony hands him a white plastic square that looks like a name card. It's blank, only marked with a flashy red stripe on one side and the Stark Industries logo on the other.
The snow didn’t let up by evening and it only got worse during the night. Best Tony could do, was make sure the tent would hold and not smother them under a load of too much snow. He spent some time checking equipment and the damage to the armor and found that he wouldn't be able to bring back smooth flight capability without some spare part. Still, he was able to activate the armor, climb in, get rid of some snow and make sure their little igloo was secured.
“I don’t think my hands will ever be clean enough.”
“How about a story?” You suggest instead. “No need to debate who is and who isn’t tone deaf that way.”
There goes that voice in his head—one of three. Well, hopefully, it’s just three. It seemed every time a new moon passes. There’s something else wrong with Tony. He shakes it off, moving his legs, his body. He needs to tune it out. He needs to work, it helps him ignore it, and when he ignores them, they go away. He stands pacing over to the workbench when there’s a knock at the door. He pauses a moment. Paranoia and fear set in. No one should be knocking.
He sits on the bench and eyes the weights, and silently wishes Rhody were there. They were gym buddies. Tony’s never been the pinnacle of health, nor was he conscious about his body. But it was their thing. Go to the gym, work up a sweat go home, and eat junk food.
“That isn't how I woke him up, but he started to attack me. I just grabbed him to stop him.”
“Buck.” Steve elbows him lightly in the side, as his face turns red in embarrassment. Steve doesn’t usually tell people just how much he can actually eat in a day. Or how much he really wants to eat in a day. His eating habits are the main reason why Bucky has to hog food sometimes. More often than not Steve will eat all the food in the kitchen. It’s been that way ever since he went through that drug trial.
“I’m…” Steve bites his lip, hands clenching in and out of fists. “I’m the one who broke your counter. Not Bucky.”
“Why couldn’t I use that one?”
Steve: Hey Buck, Tony and I are at Metro-General. There was an accident, and Tony's wrist might be broken. We've got Stephen looking at it, we'll know more in a bit. Just wanted to let you know.
“And Killian, if you see Killian keep him away.”
“Yeah, why wait?”
“I think we have to hurry.” You say. Stephen wasn’t rushing you, but there’s this feeling, something in the back of your mind pulling you to get this done quickly and move onto the next step. Not that you’re sure what exactly the next step is.
“Hell yeah I’m keeping this.” Bucky takes the picture out of the sketchbook carefully making sure not to tear it. He feels the page between his fingers before his mind catches up with the second half of Steve’s statement and gets a wicked grin. “And show me the others! What else have you been ‘imagining’? Less clothes I’m assuming.”
“He said you should know it’s not that easy, and something about ‘till the end of the line.”
You’re waiting for them as they step out. The moment your eyes land on Tony’s face, you feel a sharp pain in the side of your head. It’s not as intense or painful as it was before when you met the small group all at the same time. Something about the more people one brings to the surface may be the more pain you’ll experience.
“Yeah.” You nod. “I feel great. I’m happy the both of you are safe.” The boy coos at you as he reaches a hand in your direction. You give him your finger to squeeze and he laughs. “What’s his name?”
“Alright.” Stephen throws away his empty jello cup.  “Are you ready to go back? Bucky’s probably here by now.”
“How are you sleeping?”
All of your comments give me life, and keep me motivated to write! Thank you all so much. I'm so sorry I haven't responded individually, when I read them sometimes I smile and just don't know what to say! So instead I write faster, to give you longer and quicker updates!!
She rolls her eyes. “And where is ‘here’ exactly?”
Shoes aren’t a direct link to being comfortable, but somehow it changes things, somehow, it’s important. They took their shoes off because they intend to stay, even if only for a movie. They’re going to stay, and Tony likes that idea.
Tony then sighs, relieved, already having forgotten about the pizza, but he still checks the peephole before opening the door.
Tony finds himself speechless. He doesn’t talk about his accident, not with Pepper, not Rhody. Only Killian ever since he was done with surgeries and recovery. His eyes focus on a poster to the right, a number for domestic abuse helpline. It’s not true that he hasn’t talked about it, not completely. He told Bucky. Not everything, but he didn’t hesitate to mention his scars. Maybe it was nothing and he’s making it more than what it is, but it gives him pause, to think about how he’s managed to all at once be scared and wholly trusting with them.
Gamora accepted her fate for many years, but one thing she always knew, this wasn’t how her life was supposed to be. But then again, things rarely end up how you want them too.
“This was fun.”
“If it’s someone I know, they’ll personally call him.” Tony whispered. “It’s over. This was never going to work out anyway.”
Then her mind was spinning, seeing all at once. Just as someone else was. A man. Strange they called him. He was looking through time. But why? Then she saw it, the last possible future. Thanos dead and everyone saved.
“Yes.” You respond.
“Normal person?”
“He said that I should tell you, Bucky is alive. But not for long.”
“Why?” Natasha asks. “Wouldn’t it be best if we helped you find Tony and fix everything?”
