Tony smirked. “Did I just hear the Steve Rogers admit that I’m right? God, you’re definitely sick, I think we need to call Bruce.” They both laughed.
“Oh, Rogers, you’re putting me on the spot. If you’d give me five minutes I could make you an entire presentation.”
Steve spent so much time looking after others that he forgot to take care of himself and now he had been shot, broken multiple ribs, suffer a severe concussion and probably a lot of other smaller injuries Tony couldn’t recall. But the fact was that Steve was so unbelievably stupid and thick-headed. And sweet and caring and basically everything Tony wished to be. Tony groaned loudly and threw his head back, at which the bots reacted, startling their creator.
“That- that would actually be really nice,” Steve admits shyly. He’s normally not one to ask for help, but Lord knows he needs it right now. “I owe you one.”
Unsure of what to say, Steve lays an arm around the smaller man’s waist and embraces him, warmly and affectionately.
“M’sorry, Tony…” Steve mumbled quietly. His voice was thin, on the edge of breaking. “But y-you really shouldn’t huh! be h-here riihh right now,” Steve spoke through catching  breaths, hurrying out the last part of the sentence before letting out a soft TShhoo!
Bucky glances over his shoulder, hoping that the rest of the team will enter soon enough, but it seems unlikely. He grunts as he stands and walks towards the door. “I’ll go tell them to get their shit together and hurry.”
Looking up with bleary eyes, Steve sees Bucky emerging from the door. He’s leaning against the door frame, his hair still damp from sweat and kept in a bun, a teasing smirk playing on his lips.
“huhh… uhhhUSChoo! uh.. huuUCHshh! Oh,” Steve sighed after two strong sneezes, which he caught in the crook of his elbow. His body had tensed without he had even noticed it and eventually, when he was sure he’s done, he fell back into the comfortable sofa.
Steve gave it a second thought, then shrugged. “Neither did I. Probably the lack of sleep that’s finally catching up with me.”
“So you, Steve Rogers hot-as-fuck and super sexy, hunky super-soldier,” Tony’s hand moved uncontrollably, gesturing at Steve’s body, “are in love… with me?”
Tony stopped to breathe and realized he’d just stood there and nearly screamed at Steve for about a minute. His sight had turned blurry and his entire body was shaking, his lower lip quivering intensely.
Steve wanted to object so badly, but he was too tired to response with anything else but a sigh and an irritated hum. He just continued looking directly into the eyes of the armoured man: shiny and comfortable and beautiful. All the noise and clatter around them seemed to fade out. Tony’s mouth was moving, yet it was inaudible to Steve. He felt how Tony’s grip got tighter, and Steve cracked a smile at how their bodies were so close, so connected.
In this moment, however, as Steve was sitting there, looking so small and, to some extend, pathetic, Tony felt puzzled. This was an different Steve, a softer, more human Steve. Maybe he didn’t actually know Steve as well as he thought he did.
With a wry smile, Tony stands up and puts the stuff on Steve’s bedside table. He turns on the night light as Steve grabs the shirt he had laid out on the bed and pulls it over his head.
An explosion, powerful despite its humble size, sent splinters in every direction. The majority of Steve’s body had been covers by the shield, but he felt small shards prickling his legs through the holes in his suit like a needle. He cursed under his breath and slowly got up from the ground. Looking around, he heard nothing but his own wheezing breath, until the silence was broken by a loud bang.
” Steve says through hitchy breaths and rushes to finish the sentence before catching a quick single in the tissue he still has in his hand.
“I didn’t think the word can’t was in your vocabulary,” Tony said and Steve smiled sadly at that. “And look, it’s hard. After Afghanistan I thought no one would ever be able to help or understand me. Turns out talking about that sort of stuff actually is helpful. Don’t tell Pepper, though, I’ll never stop hearing from it if she finds out I said that.”
Tony threw his hands up in frustration, then pulled his hair tightly, eyes widening. “Like this, like you’re okay when you’re obviously not!”
“Sure… why not,” Steve smiled tiredly and propped himself up from the chair. As he stood, his body wobbled, and he quickly leaned against the nearest wall to balance himself. Tony was there in a split second, stabilizing the bigger man.
Through his peripheral vision, Steve noticed something blocking the light, a large shadow covering him. He instinctively turned his head to identify the objects, his eyes enlarging as a car was less than 3 metres away from him. The car sped up, driving Steve into a corner. Reactively, Steve threw himself back, regrettably smashing his head into the wall to avoid getting hit by the car, then fell to the ground with a hard landing. He heard a loud crack and winced at the pain coming from his ribs. Before he had anytime to compose himself, another large object was thrown at him from the car. Grabbing the shield, trying to cover himself, he rolled and dodged the object by a few feet.
About halfway through the debrief, Steve is ready to die. He’s kept fairly composed so far; frequent sniffles and teary eyes, but no sneezing yet. They are just about to discuss the damage and decide how to clean up to city after the numerous destructions when Steve’s nose starts tickling.
Tony smirked and raised an eyebrow. He leaned back comfortably in the sofa, suddenly feeling a lot better.
As Tony exhaustedly stumbled his way towards his room at 4:20 AM, he decided to make a pit stop in the communal kitchen, as he supposed he should at least eat something after spending the entire night and the majority of the day before in the lab, perfecting his suit for the millionth time.
Steve grabs his hand and pulls him back in, their foreheads now resting against each other’s. “Sweetheart… this is in no way too much to ask. You can never ask too much from me.” He says and presses a gentle peck on the center of Tony’s cheeks, kissing away the tears, leaving a salty taste in his mouth.
He sneezed off to the side, away from Tony, coughed harshly and winced wretchedly afterwards. He let out a whine as he breathed in short and fast breaths as if every inhale was sending a thousand needles into his stomach.
Tony hesitated and frowned. He opened his mouth to say something but never got the chance to speak before Natasha nearly pushed him off his chair.
“Can you, like, maybe… will you stay, tonight? Please,” Steve begged, frowning in suspense as he waited for Tony to answer. However, his expression softened as soon as he felt a tickling breath behind his ear and a pair of lips brushing his cheek.
Tony watched, still reeling at being called a pet name, let alone ‘honey’, as Steve huffed, so fondly, before slowly walking over to the stunned genius. He gently took the coffee cup out of his hand, before one of those big, warm hands cradled his cheek.
Obviously after three days of little to no sleep and running on nothing but coffee and smoothies, his higher brain functions had stopped working. Or something.
Once Thor took Loki, the Tesseract, and the Sceptre (that thing was way too dangerous to just keep around, since SHIELD clearly couldn’t be trusted with making sure their things weren’t taken) back to Asgard, the Avengers scattered to the wind.
Steve paused, squeezing his eyes shut. First Wanda and Hank, then Natasha, Vision, Rhodes, Janet, Bucky, Carol, and
Whatever he had been thinking about saying, the swirling thoughts that had been on his mind for the past week, all but left him. He thoughtlessly gave Tony’s hand a gentle squeeze, and his heart sped up when Tony squeezed back.
His and Pepper’s relationship became increasingly strained (all of his relationships became strained; later he would wonder what made Rhodey and Happy forgive him), and when the palladium poisoning set in…
After all, for all that Cap was right about him (for all that Natasha was right about that assessment: Iron Man yes, Tony Stark no) there was one thing he was wrong about; if nothing else, even if he lost the suit and his entire wealth, he still had his genius.
Tony smiled, feeling like more than a bit of an idiot at how misty his vision turned. He really didn’t know what he did to deserve them. (He never would.)
Well, he had all the time in the world to figure it out, with the best sort of crazy family and wonderful friends at his side.
And when they ended up all cuddling together on the couch, with Tony snuggled right in the middle? Honestly, Tony swore he had everything he needed right there.
And after Obi-Obadiah’s betrayal, for the longest time as much as he wanted to just snuggle into his friends and loved ones arms, he could barely stand to be touched. (The first time he let Rhodey hug him longer than a few seconds, just relaxing at the touch, he felt unspeakably grateful.)
Clint had taken over the vents by the end of that first week, and Nat had claimed one corner of the biggest couch on the commons floor.
Not that Tony would ever want to shoulder Rhodey with the mess that was him and all his baggage - it was a miracle that he even wanted to be his friend - but… sometimes he still did wonder.
His thoughts were interrupted when the car pulled up in front of the building. Sighing, he waved goodbye to Happy, slipped his sunglasses on, and let his Tsum bound out of the car, following close behind.
He knew New York; but as he stood there, his Tsum letting out worried cheeps where it tried to climb onto his shoulder, he found he didn’t recognize his own home.
At the same time, he also had to squash down long, lingering feelings about the man Howard had spent more time searching for than spending with his wife and son, the man Tony had been compared to for the majority of his young life. (Someone who wasn’t broken like Tony was.)
He knew what would happen with his actions; he was an expert at pushing others away, after all, didn’t even really have to try.
Shield strapped to one arm and a gun in hand of the other, he ran back to the bar where the team had set up a temporary base, taking out straggling zombies along the way. Overhead he saw Falcon and Iron Man fly by to support the others in the team who were struggling against the waves of zombies they were tasked to fight. Over the com, he could hear the harsh breathing and cursing of the others, the roar of the Hulk and Thor’s crackling thunder; he knew it was only a matter of time before-
" His stream of thought cuts off abruptly as JAC follows his first finger with a very insistent second.
Steve breaks the kiss to wrestle Tony’s hands away, gripping both of them in one broad palm, that super-serum strength a rigid vice around his wrists. Then suddenly he’s backed against a wall, his arms pinned above his head, Steve’s unoccupied hand pressing into his groin and he must’ve traveled back in time to his teenage years because he’s hard in his pants already.
Tony pushes himself up on shaky arms, feeling tender and hollow. All he can think about is the pressure in his dick, waiting for release, and he fumbles at the ring around it, trying to roll it back up with trembling fingers. Steve is there, grabbing his hands by the wrist again and wordlessly pushing them away.
” when the other option is to choke on Captain America's super-soldier cock. To his genuine surprise, he feels JAC's fingers probing, lube-slicked, at his hole. "What, are you using fingers this time, huh? Guess I should have company over more often if
He doesn’t know how long it takes him, and he doesn’t ask JARVIS, just runs simulation after simulation, making tweaks here and adjustments there. JAC ends up being--well, perhaps not as complex or robust as JARVIS, but at least as versatile, with a bit more freedom. “This is your baby brother, okay?” Tony tells JARVIS. “Help him grow and learn. Don’t hurt him unless he deserves it.”
He stands and stares at JAC, still powered down, pinching his lower lip between his fingers as he thinks. He can tweak this project all he wants and act like it’s going to serve a real function like the rest of his suits, but he knows, deep down, that the best thing for it is to dismantle it, delete all the files, and go to his grave with one more thing to feel guilty about. Indulging in… this… isn’t sustainable or healthy.
“Babbo?” the word barely makes it through the static that seems to be permeating his com link. Tony leans back against the wall of the
“I think you need to rest,” the blond says and Tony exhales. It feels too much like relief. The Captain’s tone isn’t its sharp bite, no command in it, but more like a suggestion. It’s nice, the mechanic thinks, because now he can hear the undercurrent of concern in his voice. “Plus, I don’t think Rhodes will be very amenable to me hitching a ride with him,” he gives Tony a wry smile.
“”Be angry,” Steve hissed at him, shaking him. “Scream at me, be angry, be hurt, be indignant; hell, Tony, call the suits and
“What are you telling me.” Steve’s voice is harsh and unforgiving as he takes a step towards the android. “You better not be—”
, Wanda’s voice says in his head. So this was it. This is what makes the great Tony Stark destroy himself. Not a kidnapping, not a terrorist cell, not open heart surgery, not even betrayal…
“You heard what we did, right?” Sam chimes in incredulously. “You are aware of what she just said? Call me crazy, but from what I know, this whole you all blamed Tony for what happened in Sokovia. Even when Thor came back, even when Viz was created, you still held him responsible. Now she’s telling you that it wasn’t all on him, and you still refuse to accept that you were wrong!”
“Loud and clear,” Barton says with a clenched jaw before Tony can say anything in response. He turns to give the mechanic a steely look. “shall we?”
“I don’t want to. I really don’t… I just, like you said, I’ve caused him so much pain. I can’t help but think that’s all I’m going to do.”
“You promised,” Tony whispered and whatever control Steve had left in him broke. He shook his head, clearly remembering the same thing, and began to gasp for breath. “You promised me nobody else would take it again, and at the first opportunity, God,” Tony chuckled darkly. “You destroyed it.” his fingers beat an incessant pattern on his chest.
“So you think you’re a family counselor now? You think you’re a genius parent or something? Is that why you brought a kid into a fight?” Clint snaps defensively. He knows, but won’t admit, that Tony has a point. That his own son thinks his father can replace him, drop retirement and go at the first call of someone he hasn’t even met. But damn if he’s going to let
“I wish I could say the same,” her voice says and Steve is amazed to find her accent thickens as a human’s would. “Please redirect to your quarters.”
But now here Tony is, with a tiny, squishy-soft bundle in his hands, and a sense of love so strong he has only felt twice before. He’s been unable to do anything but stare adoringly down at her the whole hour he’s been here. He could have taken her home, but the sudden hit of love/protectiveness/awe that had filled him from the moment she was placed in his hands kept him.
“What Ross presented me with at the beginning,” Tony says and Natasha coughs next to him though ironically the sound she makes sounds a lot like
“I’m—” he takes a deep breath, squares his shoulders the way they told him to in training, and meets Tony’s eyes. Then falters.
Tony has big shoes to fill what with his father’s company and the start-up he’s been talking about since their very first conversation together. For any other nineteen year old Bostonian those might be pipe dreams, but Steve knows that with or without Howard Stark’s name to back him up, Tony will do whatever he sets himself out to do. That is another reason why Steve convinces himself to do what he does.
“Tony!” he jumps back at the sound of the voice. all sharp edges and worry, and there at hands on his shoulders that are gripping him a little too tight, but that’s okay because that lets him concentrate on being grounded. Here, not under the water or cars or a fucking cave in Afghanistan. He’s there, in New York, in a building that no longer feels like home but where he at least knows nobody is currently actively trying to kill him. “You’re okay, Tony.” Peter looks infinitely worried for him, despite everything that he’s done
“Classy. So when things don’t go your way, they’re bullshit? Real mature, Stark,” Barton’s voice bites out from behind him. Tony turns around, thinking that diplomacy and keeping the peace be damned, but someone gets there faster.
“I am,” Phil said simply. He stared down at Steve and he had the distinct feeling that there was a talk in his future that he would not enjoy. Phil’s eyes briefly dropped to Steve’s arm wrapped around Tony and then to Tasha. There was a whole conversation there, and Steve bit his lip to stifle his curiosity. “Tasha called me once you were back. Said you might be needing help from someone with experience doing… damage control.”
When they reach the compound, Happy parks the car in the main garage and gets out. Before Steve can get out, the locks click shut and the driver slams his door shut. It isn’t until then that he notices Rhodes hadn’t made a move to get out of his seat, or even unclick his seatbelt. So the blond leans back in his seat with dread settling low on his belly. He should have known that things wouldn’t go that easy. Rhodes has a protective instinct stretching a mile wide, and though he hadn’t been outright hostile with any of them, everyone knew he didn’t trust them as far as he could throw them. Which, with the armor, is probably pretty damn far.
“I’m not the one with that particular bad habit,” the other man replies immediately, though Steve is beginning to clue in. If the retort is that fast it means that Tony has learned that a berating is coming and he has rehearsed for it. They have done each other so much damage.
, though Tony refuses to acknowledge that’s why he’s doing it. He breathes a little easier with every restriction that is no longer there, and every freedom that he couldn’t even have conceived, but someone with at least one shred of dignity in the UN has allowed to be written down.
Tony looked at him incredulously for a second before he let himself drop on the couch. He leaned forward to rest his elbows on his knees, and rested his face in his hands. His shoulders were shaking, and for a second Steve was afraid that he’d sent him reeling again, until he realized Tony was laughing. He would have been angry, would have accused Tony of treating this like a
” Tony’s hologram says. The soldier jerks in his seat, his head snapping up to look at him. The rest of the room goes silent, and they fade from his periphery. He only has eyes for him.
“Yes, Peter needs to clean up his mess, Bart-Bot. Dum-dum, go help your brother,” Tony says, now at Steve’s side, but he has a mischievous grin on his face as he pretends not to hear Peter’s stuttering or notice his red cheeks. “Hey, you.”
as much as he needs to, he never should have been left to do this on his own. Sometimes, when the deliriousness of sleeplessness and tiredness and anxiety grabs hold of him, he asks
“Mmm? Sorry, I just… got a lot on my mind lately,” Steve offers them a weak smile that he knows they will never accept, but he doesn’t know what to say. He’s been confronted by them time and time again, and by now they should already know what he’s going to tell them. He’s trying, and most days he’s content. But that’s just it, isn’t it? He’s content, but he’s not happy. Not utterly the way he once was.
“How’d you get in here?” he says, and subtly tries to move the kid’s attention from the alcoholic disaster that is his life. he stretches as much as he can in his stuffy shirt, and then slumps back into the chair as his body seems to give out. Jesus, he’s tired, and sleeping in the shop didn’t do his back any favors.
“Give him to me,” a voice said from behind him when she moved into the room. Tony’s blood went cold, and he turned around with the fussy boy to see Barton glaring at him. The atmosphere in the room went silent at once. Tony could feel the whole table staring at them.
“Why did you build this?” the boy suddenly asks after a while of comforting silence. Tony doesn’t know what, exactly, he means so he merely turns and looks at him. “The greenhouse, I mean. You’re this… this tech guru guy, you know? Nobody thinks you’d enjoy something like this.”
“Steve, we’ve been over this. Wanda’s trial is a formality, at best. The lawyers are ready; you guys have been pardoned already, we just have to—”
“But it’s not fair to hurt other people because of your own shit, you know? And that interview we saw… Tony’s been hurting for just as long, Steve, and he doesn’t even know why. That’s gotta suck, right? So if you’re going to do this, if you’re gonna… try again, you need to be sure. You can’t run away because you’re scared, Stevie, look at where that’s got you both. You’re miserable, and I—I want to trust you, I do, but I can’t let you hurt him again if you’re going to bolt every time things get tough.”
“Hey Greg,” he says, finally interrupting their blabbering. He needs to get this done before Rhodey comes back and tries to chime in on it or Morgan needs a feeding or something else. He smirks at his son’s eyeroll and the other kid’s squeak. Ned has known him most of his life but for whatever reason he still gets nervous around Tony. “This all sounds fascinating, but I need to talk to Pete about something important and it can’t wait. You main letting him for a bit?”
. He wants to give in to this, whatever it may be, that he’d begun to realize somewhere between the last few months they spent at the compound and that last blow to his arc reactor. He realizes how messed up that is.
“What were they?” Sam asks, and there is something like anger in his tone. Tony doesn’t know him well enough to guess who it’s directed at.
know. Even when he was younger, he didn’t make it a point to hang around with drunks much. Sure, Bucky and he went out from time to time. Dancing or the movies with a dame Bucky had gotten for him, but he’d never been around people like that. He had never seen how truly gone someone could be. He’s seen enough pop culture now, though, to have an idea of what might happen at a college campus. But thinking about this—thinking about a
“Yeah, I think—I think I could,” Tony says, a warmth spreading through his chest as he leans back against the couch and Peter rests his head on his shoulder. “Don’t take it personal, though, okay?”
and he had to swallow hard at the impulse of rubbing his hands free of it. God knows it wouldn’t help at all, though.
because Tony’s mouth curls into a painful mimicry of a smile and his eyes get sad. He glances away, turns back and offers Steve a tiny wave, and then turns to walk away.
It isn’t until he’s about to leave the room that he notices Steve. He’s in one of his signature tight shirts, and those ridiculous old man pants; he’s standing similarly to Rhodey. His hair is a little longer than usual, and there’s a bit of stubble on his chin. He’s staring impassively at the scene in front of him, though the tension on his frame is clear.
“Peter,” he says quietly and nudges his boy a little when he makes an affirmative noise. It hits Tony, like a punch to the gut, to see Peter’s face. His eyes are swollen and his cheeks and nose are all red from his crying, he keeps biting his lip in that he’s done since he was very little and didn’t want to cry. “Hey, bambino, look at me, huh?” Tony chucks him lightly under the chin, and Peter forces his head up. “I—I understand, okay? It’s hard for me, too, every single day. I—I’m going to tell you some stuff, yeah? Because, Petey, this idea you have right now? that you have to okay, and you have to move on? It’s not—Peter, that’s just not true, okay? These kinds of things—love is so strange, bambino, love doesn’t work the way you think it might. When you love someone, the way you love your father, well… it makes things so much harder.”
“I’m—I’m good. I just—are you sure?” His voice trembles, and it’s a testament to his shock that he hasn’t done anything yet to regain his composure. “It’s real this time?”
“Right,” Tony says quietly. He gives one last apprehensive glance at Wanda’s fingers, and accepts a squeeze from Tasha before he makes his way to the exit. “I told you,” he can’t help but tell T’Challa as he leaves. The king gives him a resigned look.
Now it was Bucky, Tony and Natasha. Tony went to sleep earlier these days, or cuddled up to the twins and played video games though they swore they were too old, gross Bambino, they were all of
“There are fifty states and Mount Rushmore is in South Dakota, I’m practically an expert. Now, get, shortstack!” Tony cuts the call and chuckles to himself. He’s going to be on the receiving end of so much sass when he talks to the boy again.
“I think I’ll finish this in the lab,” he tells Rhodey quietly as he grabs his plate. It once again brings the conversation to a halt, and he hates it. he hates that they can’t have a normal day without him fucking it up. God.
“I thought so. I won’t bother you with the details, but the things that I have seen… Steve, I know my word doesn’t count for much, but I am no lying when I say keeping her here was the best option. Especially,” Steve sees him hesitate before a steely sort of resolve washes over him and he looks at the soldier in the eye. “Especially when I wasn’t sure I was doing the right thing by protecting her.”
“It is, but I think we should just be glad we haven’t killed each other yet. Not for like of trying, I guess, but there’s that.” Tony stretches his back and scratches at the back of his head. God, he’s sore.
it, Tony. I could hear the stupid BARF in the background and you weren’t okay, and I was miles away. And the only—the only thing—what I could do—I couldn’t—“hearing the boy hiccupping tears Steve’s heart in two.
“Harley Keener, you better put the Mark 7 down right this moment. How even did you get in here?!” Steve, brain belatedly recognizing that there is no danger whatsoever, turns around to look at their assailant. The first thing his eyes drop to are the two potatoes at his feet, and then turns incredulous eyes up to look at the… kid. Small, blond floppy-haired kid who’s glaring at him with the same type of determination he’s seen on the Spider-teen. Oh, boy. Another one.
Tony stares into those earnest, open brown eyes, so much like his own, and feels as though he’s in free falling with no hopes of coming back. It’s not the fact that being together is slightly overwhelming, or the fact that so much seems to rest on this meeting, but on how young Peter actually is. Looking at him makes Tony feel like he’s staring at himself, way back when, and that here is a second chance for him, or someone like him, to finally turn out right. If there is anything he can do to lead this young, bright, utterly beautiful person away from all the mistakes Tony has made then he would do it. the more he looks at him, though, the more he realizes that he can do everything he can to keep Peter safe but it doesn’t mean anything if he doesn’t give the kid a
Steve’s ability to form words had left him sometime around the mention of thirteen year old Tony. He can’t talk through the lump in his throat, so he merely nods. There’s a measure look in Rhodes’s eyes as he stares back, and then nods. He opens the door and gets out without another word. Steve can’t do anything but stare straight ahead and try not to break.
They should have never told Steve not to check the news, they know him, which is why that’s the very first thing he does. Later, he’ll think it’s good luck that he stopped by that bench because somehow he ends up collapsing onto it like his legs have been taken out from underneath him at the knees. He hasn’t had a panic attack in quite a while, it feels like when he was very little and his asthma was very bad, but his chest tightens and his lungs feel too big for his ribs. An elderly woman walking her dog slows down in front of him, he knows this in a peripheral way, and asks if he’s all right. He doesn’t know what his response is, knows only the words blurred in front of his eyes, but in a short time he’s left alone again.
It’s not easy, by any means, they both have bad days and then terrible ones. Steve’s self-doubt and guilt eat at him every time Tony hesitates, every time he steps back from affection because he gets overwhelmed. He hates the days Tony locks himself in his lab or uses Pepper as an excuse to not see Steve. There are days when he wonders if this had been the right choice, if he could truly make Tony happy, but then the other man will do something. Small things, like the post-its he’s so fond of leaving all over Tony’s apartment or the snaps he sends of Peter and Harley and Dummy. He would grab hold of Steve’s pinky when they go out to eat or look at him with those eyes and smile that haven’t changed at all from the boy he fell so madly in love with and Steve will breathe.
“Baron Zemo,” Steve all but growled - which Tony silently swooned at; his Captain America Voice(™) was one of the hottest things - and glared, hands clenched as the villain all but postured right next to the pedestal.
Steve had no concept of time, didn't know how old he was or… anything, except the bitter cold of ice.
At the end of the day, he was just thankful that they easily, if somewhat awkwardly at first, slid back into the close friendship they had. He was thankful all of them stayed, even if they didn’t have a reason to.
As he walked into SHIELD HQ and down the halls of the floorplan he long since memorized, he felt… off.
The others would all congratulate them, and they would spend the rest of the evening together, Pokemon included, as usual.
“Come back alright and you might get more,” he said with matching affection, warm and a bit hungry, but with all the seriousness Captain America had; Tony
Almost on autopilot - because… what? - he bent down and gently scooped up the Tsum, almost startling when it’s red and gold face - that looked like… but that was
And it both warmed Steve’s heart and made him ache for him with how obviously happy and content Tony was. (Not to say he didn’t get hugged or anything when in human form from the others; just not nearly to this degree.)
“Tony, I… I wanted to apologize. For all that I said when we first met.” He tightened his grip on Tony’s hand, staring down at it as he talked, unable to look at him. “I know we got off to a rough start, and I said things that I regret ever saying, let alone thinking; you’re not your father, you’re not some bigoted jerk trying to play hero; Tony, you are a hero, and it’s been a blesing having gotten a chance to see you, the real you behind your masks. And I- I was wondering if you wanted to go on a date? With me?” He added cautiously, feeling his nerves come back.
!” He exclaimed in a burst, but like a balloon all the fight left him, leaving him deflated with his (many) insecurities. “...What if it doesn’t turn out okay? After what happened with Pepper, I… I don’t think I could do it all over again if he tells me he doesn’t lo-like me, if I’m not enough…” He muttered, feeling painfully vulnerable in that moment.
“...Do you want to, you know, grab some lunch, or something?” He hesitantly stopped and started, feeling ridiculous and kind of stupid.
Steve looked down at him, smiling with some sort of warmth that might or might not have caused Tony’s heart to skip a beat, fingers flexing where they were curled around broad shoulders and a strong back that went on for days. Which was ridiculous, he was just seeing things again -
“I can’t believe you went all that way for a Chalice that makes coffee.” The bland yet impressed tone Bruce used made Tony smile, even though Bruce had turned him down for his bitter tea.
If he couldn’t offer anything else (money wasn’t going to fix anything here) then he at least had this.
For a moment, before the darkness completely took him, he wondered if he finally found his Soulmate.
“Helen? J? What’s-oh, Steve!” Tony said, blinking up at him in surprise, adjusting his glasses. (They were far more adorable than they had any right to be.)
After who knows how long, Steve spoke again, but this time he could make out the words, the pain and cold fading a bit with Steve’s super soldier warmth.
Just as he was about to retort something snarky, or tell Hank to come over and break the door down, a rumbling in the ground caused him to turn. The door slowly slid open, revealing… a hole. Straight into the ground.
When he came back (broken, he came back shattered and his heart was cut out and the water kept getting on the battery and he was being electrocuted dyingpleasemakeitstop-) less than he was but still a bit wiser for it, Yinsen’s words echoing through his mind, he would never be the same.
- the water splashing onto the car battery that was keeping you alive and simultaneously electrocuting you from inside through a metal disk in your chest.
When the true meaning of the thought hit, Tony didn’t even have it in him to panic; he just laughed wetly, ignoring the way everything began to blur as he blinked hard.
Really, if it wasn’t for the explosions, blows would have been dealt. As it was, Tony found it easy to put aside the ‘talk’ while he and Cap ran for their gear.
Later, when he was on the helicarrier, striding into the main deck with all the suave ego he had mastered decades ago, he would forever deny (at least, to anyone else) that seeing his long-time hero alive and in uniform made his heart beat faster, and he had to keep from acting like a middle school girl meeting her idol. That would have just been embarrassing is what that was. (Thankfully Fury never picked up on that detail… at least he doesn’t think he did, anyways.)
“Welcome back, Cap,” Hank said from over where the monitors were, giving him a small grin as he sat up from one of the many cots set in the Virtual Reality room.
For all of Tony’s, Bruce’s, and Hank’s genius, they could never quite manage to get it right for how
Like a broken spell, Steve felt his nerves settle, leaving him with nothing but love and determination.
Not mentioning that Tony wouldn’t mind that nearly as much if he thought he had even half a chance of Steve being interested in dating him…
Tony was lounging on the couch, looking gorgeous and soft with his fluffy, messy hair, his dressing shirt untucked with the sleeves rolled up and his adorable glasses framing his warm chocolate eyes, with his Alolan Raichu and Jarvis - currently occupying Tony’s phone - snuggled up with him, all watching a silly movie about something or another.
The thought of how touch-starved his husband was always brought forth a fierce protectiveness that would have scared Steve if he hadn’t known it was inevitable with falling for the soft genius, and a wish Howard was still around to give him a
“Sure, but I do have things I need to do, you know, busy things, and stuff…” Tony trailed off, feeling his face flush at his garbled half-sentences; very smooth. What happened to all his hard earned masks?
Things were awkward between them, at first; though they seemed to have moved past what happened in the helicarrier, most lingering feelings left behind, it was pretty obvious even to Tony that neither of them were very good at ‘talking’.
Over the coms, Tony and Thor still fought on, though Steve knew they weren’t going to last much longer; he could tell that Thor was wounded, and Tony was only a baseline human, not made to stand against this constant assault. When they both reached their limits… Steve refused to think about that, heart constricting even imagining the outcome.
Except about a month after Tony’s revelation, it found Tony all but cornered in the common floor kitchen with Steve blocking the doorway with a weirdly determined yet nervous expression, the others in the game room down the hall. They were alone.
Taking a deep, shaky breath, he closed his eyes, gripping the special pokeball to his chest even tighter.
As the elevator moved, he stared down at the black pokeball, not really seeing it as his mind reeled.
“Well, seems to me like you have it from here.” Tony did startle then, looking up as Fury, who looked almost smug, casually walked over to the door Tony still stood frozen in front of. “I’ll contact you later. Good day, Stark; Captain.”
What he learned was called ‘foreplay’ was nice; he had always been more tactile, enjoyed hugs whenever possible. But when they tried to go further, he just… couldn’t. (He felt extremely uncomfortable; almost grossed out in his own skin by the time he ended it.)
“Great! Now all we gotta do is get to the temple…” Tony said, turning back to the temple itself; there weren’t that many guards and the team could easily take them out - they knew that the Masters of Evil weren’t even there yet, as they had gotten word they just sent the henchmen ahead of time - but more time spent fighting was less time getting the Chalice!
Running a calming hand down the Tsum’s back - even if he was in constant pain now, didn’t mean he had any right to treat his Tsum badly for it - he absently wondered what the good ol’ Cap would think of him now.
By the time he went to MIT, at the age of fourteen, Tony realized he just didn’t understand ‘sexual attraction’. At least, not in the way other people seemed to, well, ‘normalize’, or even ‘idealize’ it.
And, who only could be Steve Rogers - he’s seen the reels and comics and pictures; knows after the serum he was large and built like an Adonis - stared right back, Tony’s Tsum cuddled against his chest like ze was no bigger than his own Tsum, a million emotions flashing through brilliant blue eyes. Tony silently took in the rest of this Soulmate - and
Tony was far too young to feel this old, to feel the cold causing creaking bones to ache and the heat to wear him down to sluggish exhaustion.
Shaking off the thought, he let go as Tony touched down in the middle of the overturned bar room. Before Tony could fly off again, Steve gently grabbed his wrist, turning his coms to mute, and pulling him into a hard yet gentle kiss, pouring all of his worries and love into it. And as always, Tony froze as if surprised before melting into it, kissing back sweetly enough that made Steve absently wish they weren’t in the middle of an apocalyptic war-zone, pulling back reluctantly and feeling warmth bloom in his chest at his flushed, smiling face.
It would only be months later, after paying closer attention to how others looked at other people, that he understood.
Everyone in the tower - and even those who only stopped by for a visit, like the Guardians and X-Men - had held or petted Tony, cooing over him, at least once since he transformed some days prior.
- and for all the pain and discomfort and haze he was under, it felt a lot different from being in Heat… At least any Heat he’s ever experienced.
Everything of course was kept ‘chaste’; he never got quite comfortable for anything more, and Pepper was more than happy to respect that.
In a pretty good mood, Tony hummed to himself as he pet his wiggling Tsum - ze was extra excited and energetic today, hardly being able to sit still - as Happy drove them to SHIELD HQ for an ‘important meeting’ as Fury termed it; whatever that meant.
Steve stopped in the doorway of the living room, taking in the scene with a warmth growing in his chest.
Before his mind could completely spiral, the com crackled alive. “Cap-Steve… Hulk and Hawkeye are down,” Tony’s voice, drenched in pain and guilt, came through. For all that he was guilty for it, Steve felt immensely thankful; he wouldn’t have been able to carry on if Tony hadn’t made it, a thought that just hurt even thinking of it. “Then there were three, huh?” The joke fell flat, but neither he nor Thor were going to point it out to him.
“I generally don’t like magic, but this? This is a whole different creature,” Tony said happily, smirking at all the surprised looks everyone gave him; it was well known how much he hated magic.
-he was pretty sure this was what Heaven must be like: snuggled in the softest bed, cuddled against an extra warm super soldier, hands gently petting him.
Tony, at the age of three and two-thirds, fully learned and realized that he was the one in several billion to not have a Soulmate. Or, at least, a Soulmate that was still alive.
And as the frozen waters came surging into view, his last thoughts were to his Soulmate, and how he desperately wished that things had never led to this, wished he could be forgiven for the life that would be taken with him.
“Okay, I get that we need to get the ‘Almighty Chalice of Wumbology’ or whatever, but what about-” Clint yelped when multiple pairs of arms tugged him back down, everyone - loudly - shushing him.
It would be almost a year before he worked up the nerve to try again at a different party, but this time with a guy. He knew being gay was a thing; maybe he could do it like this?
wouldn’t last if they kept going like this. Distantly he wondered how the only real good thing he had gotten from being in a war besides his ability to strategize under fire was his ability to compartmentalize. He could think about losses later; now he had to make sure his remaining men made it through this alive.
- honestly made him reconsider, and sometimes when he was tired after a work binge, at his most vulnerable, he would trace the perfectly designed shield on his Tsum’s back, wishing it was Rhodey’s MIT sweatshirt or airforce uniform instead; wishing the colorful Tsum Rhodey had, gold dividing matte red and blue, was instead his stained white tee and jeans.
But then Steve started hanging out in the workshop, and Tony started to ‘educate’ him via movie nights on the common floor, and somehow along the way they became close friends. After a month it was clear both on the field and off, to everyone else, that Cap and Iron Man were something else when they were together.
Tony was nearing his thirties - how he managed to live this long was a mystery - and having gone just as long with the knowledge his Soulmate was dead.
“Yeah yeah, got them right here,” Sam said, holding up the clear bag that held the eight, unnecessarily large golden coins they spent a long, painful time in the jungle looking for; something about the temple needing the coins to reach the end of the ‘stairway to heaven’ or whatever.
Without a thought he gratefully drank the glass, soothing his parched throat, and was finally regaining some actual thought processes when the door opened, revealing an older kid, that took one look at him and told him how much of a mess he was.
He watched, completely lost, as his Tsum all but ran over to a man in a chair, all but clambering to get in his lap.
It was only with the light of the day, when he woke up after relentless nudging from his Tsum, that he realized that he was obviously missing things in his memory. He wasn’t in his room, and he was alone except for a glass of water and a pill on the nightstand beside him.
- so he snuggled in closer, whining softly; his Omega instincts thought that might work, and since he couldn’t really think it might know better than him.
“Remember what mobile games taught you; ramps give you extra points and a speed boost.” With that and a wink, Clint jumped down, followed by a giggling Jan, an amused Nat, and a resigned Hank and Bucky.
When she tried to act faux innocent, like she wasn’t telling him lies, he knew something was horribly
He sighed, running his fingers through his hair as he watched the elevator near the penthouse, Friday thankfully staying silent to leave him to his thoughts.
It took him another second to realize they were naked, but he could tell they have done nothing more than cuddle - he wasn’t sure whether he was disappointed or not - but that still explained nothing, and he definitely didn’t remember going to bed with a super soldier.
“Well, Iron Man, it might have if you hadn’t run off onto your own,” Steve grunted into the mic as he no doubt kicked butt like the hero he was. And if he sounded more than a bit irritated at Tony, well, he had little doubt once they got the Amulet itself he would see it was totally worth it.
He leaned down, feeling something in him settle when Tony met him halfway for a sweet kiss, the warmth and taste of it more than anything proving to him that they were no longer in that virtual world.
Helen and Jarvis noticed him first, of course, both giving him a look before leaving the room, leaving a confused Tony behind.
Later, when Fury was shuffling through Agent’s cards, smeared with his blood (he knew those cards; Tony and Pepper had personally given him a few of the rarer ones for his collection) Tony felt… cold. Disconnected.
Tony, more than happy to see the fellow scientist, easily brought him upstairs to his room and showed him the extra labs he built.
“How am I overthinking this? There’s no way Steve’s going to accept!” Tony all but cried out, his poor fraying nerves pushed to the limit. In his panic, he let go of the phone, letting Jarvis hover on his own.
Tony grinned, that manic look returning; Steve started to look a bit more concerned, as he should be.
Of course, usually said husband wasn’t only three pounds at most, with soft, mousey brown fur, long floppy ears, big brown eyes (okay, he always had those, but
After all, there was no way his Soulmate was a robot, and he wouldn’t stand for anyone saying mean things about them! After all, just ‘cause his Soulmate looked like a weird robot, doesn’t mean they’s actually a 'bot!
After they got past the awkward stage, dating someone as amazing as Pepper was… well. Honestly he never had as much fun except when Rhodey came around and they managed to convince Happy to drive them to somewhere ridiculous. (Which has happened more than a few times.)
Then, weeks later after the repairs had finished on the Tower and the floors were prepared (again, he never thought much would come of his invitation, but he was man that stood by his word) Bruce showed up, smiling awkwardly in the foyer with a small backpack in hand.
Falcon is down, Falcon is down, and being swarmed!” Clint’s yell was clearly heard over the explosions and sounds of heavy fighting. Steve felt his heart stop when Clint breathed out a soft and guilty curse. “He’s not getting back up… I think he’s gone, Cap.”
“...Right.” Turning for the last time, he glanced one more time at his antique grandfather clock, actually reading the time, (he still had a long time to go…) before turning to the living room to sit on the couch to wait.
He wasn’t sure what he expected when he told Father that, with his Tsum cuddled tight in his arms like a plushie - it was already big, like one of his teddy bears; yet another oddity - but he shouldn’t have expected anything less than the furious outrage Father fell into; for even daring to not take the blame of having a Soulmate who was not only gone, but one that was far more important than he would ever be.
Curse, because… for all the strength the serum gave him, he wasn’t strong at all. The war, the pain, seeing Bucky captured and
Soon enough, he was back to all but buzzing where he stood, anxiously watching the time tick down with his arms more holding himself than crossed in indignation. (This was such an awful idea; why did he even think about it?)
“Oh hell, no-” Sam said, jumping right after with his wings folded up to fit, Redwing following close behind.
was… - with his golden blond short hair, pale yet warm colored skin, all wrapped in a SHIELD hoodie and track pants.
Catching the shield on instinct, he felt his lips tilt up as he watched Tony swoop back around, aiming a few repulsor blasts at zombies that still staggered down the street. He waited, walking forwards when the Iron Man armor slowed to a stop, hovering in front of him; he couldn’t stop the grin blooming on his face when the faceplate lifted up, revealing a haggard, tired, yet smiling Tony.
He had made peace with that fact a long while ago; he couldn’t turn back time, and there was no point in worrying about it.
When the elevator dinged, Steve took in a deep breath before stepping out, his nerves making his palm sweat a bit.
When he ran out of the building, not paying attention to where he was going, his Tsum still secure in his palms, he skid to a stop as he took in the tall buildings surrounding him; the lights, the people, the vehicles.
Tony blinked, not really getting it, but it was probably okay, Steve saying angry words but he just sounded fond and he smelled warm and maybe a little sad? Which was not okay -
“Well, down the rabbit hole we go,” Steve said after a second, shooting a smirk in Tony’s direction.
He never again tried to go further than touches and maybe a bit of heavy kissing if he was particularly drunk, but most of the time he just brought his ‘dates’ home.
It was safe to say in those first few days, most breaks in between the ‘negotiating’ found Tony cradling his Tsum to his chest, comforting zir as much as ze was trying to comfort him.
More often than not, if he and Steve were sitting together during movie nights, they would eventually end up with Tony cuddling into Steve’s warm side (Super soldiers were like space heaters, and for someone with metal in them and got easily cold, it was an honest blessing) with his long fingers casually running through Tony’s hair.
again - before murmuring something soft in the space between them. If asked, he honestly had no idea what he said; he was having a hard time concentrating on anything that wasn’t the warm palm all but stroking his back.
He was used to it - he had to be, what with his Tsum having the clear colors and design of Captain America, not to mention how unusually large his Tsum was, and the only option of not bringing his Tsum with him was absolutely off the table - but it seemed a lot of the staring was… with more
It was only when they pulled away that Tony realized his eyes had closed, and fluttered them open to see Steve looking at him like, like he’s something valuable and important, or something.
Tony all but squealed like a prepubescent teenager when he picked the all so important Chalice. Finally, he got it!
He… He wasn’t sure he could do this (he was definitely sure this would end in nothing but heartbreak) but, with his Pokemon at his side, encouraging him? Maybe he could give it a try. At least one more time.
Tony was fifteen and at MIT when he went to his first ‘college party’ - that had turned out to be a terrible idea - but met his first real, true friend.
Much later, Tony would remember the battle in bits and pieces, starting with watching an army fly down from a hole in the sky that had appeared right over his newly built tower, and including when Loki knocked him out of his tower after his failed attempt to mind control him.
He would remember watching Thor’s lightning light up the sky, taking out an entire squad of aliens with one strike.
Where he and Steve did almost everything together (a fact he only realized after how lonely he was eating breakfast by himself in the penthouse instead of being on the common floor as he normally did) now it became where it was a rarity if Tony saw him once at all that day.
Which made no sense - everything was already better; Steve was holding him, wasn’t he? - but sleep sounded like a good idea, so he let himself drift off to the feel of warm hands and a warm heart.
Steve was kissed slow and soft, but not tentative or hesitant in any way, especially once instinct kicked in and Tony kissed back.
Everyone had a Soulmate; the other half of their Soul, the energy of it imprinted by their matching Tsums so they took on their appearance as they grew.
The point is Tony, though he was small and adorable anyways with killer Bambi eyes was suddenly a thousand times more deadly as a small rabbit.
His Tsum - still as tiny and bright red and gold as ze always had been - let out a mournful chirp, cuddling close against his neck where ze rested on his shoulder.
“No distractions on the battlefield, Captain,” Tony said playfully, eyes full of affection that Steve undoubtedly knew matched his own. Unable to resist giving him another peck, Steve gave him his best smirk when he whined at not being given more.
Instantly, the Chalice filled with a light brown and delightfully hot liquid. Tony poured it into a mug next to it - it was rude to drink from the milk carton, after all - and picked it up.
“Sir, there’s less than a three percent chance that he would not accept your affections. In fact, I believe should you not initiate copulation, the Captain would more than likely be inclined to do so.” Tony flushed, turning to glare at the clearly unrepentant Rotom. Next to him, Helen snickered, the Raichu also clearly unrepentant when Tony turned on her.
Tony looked up at him, gorgeously disheveled, cheeks still pink and eyes shining with a warmth that made everything right in the world, no matter how awfully sappy that sounded.
And, well, he guessed they didn’t want to be the ones who ‘weren’t good enough for Tony Stark’, so the rumors just continued to build.
Just to prove the point, Tony dropped a quick kiss on his lips, delighting in the way Steve just lit up.
It was only after JARVIS talked him down from the attack and he called Rhodey that he calmed enough to think rationally. Or as rationally as being Tony Stark could be.
(unless you're a child and/or Clint who loved finding the candy-filled eggs) but he was getting ahead of himself.
Not missing a beat, Steve held out his hand. Tony blinked at it in surprise, looking up at him with his warm eyes, before slipping his hand on top.
And Tony, who had long since learned to never back down, gave him his best press smile and snarked right back.
But then Bucky said how cool it must be to have a robot as a Soulmate, like in the books and radio shows; what if they could shoot lasers? Could see in the dark? Could
Steve couldn’t help but smile; Tony, who was so sweet and kind, always thinking of others, even when he had been turned into a rabbit via magic.
He breathed a sigh of relief when he made it to the conference room JARVIS told him via his earpiece where Fury and ‘his important guest’ were waiting for him. He opened the door, looking down to make sure his Tsum could fit through.
Because of all the things Rhodey did for him, he would always count that the most personal was when, only a few weeks after they met, Rhodey told him about ‘Asexuality’; how it was much more common than he would think. And just as being gay or bi wasn’t being ‘broken’, the same went for being ace.
“Last one there has to tell Hulk and Thor there aren’t any pizza joints or pop-tarts in the Amazon.” And with that, Tony stove straight down, hackling the whole way. Steve sighed and simply stepped into the hole, following his ridiculous husband.
(Later, Steve and Tony would laugh when they showed each other their gifts, both spending time with their new Pokemon: Steve, a Flapple named Virgil with his Love Ball - and Tony blushed and stammered when Steve asked about that - and Tony, an Appletun named Plato in her Luxury Ball.
“You know, considering what our so called ‘arch-enemies’ are like, I’m not that surprised,” Tony mused, putting a hand to his chin and tilting his head.
Tony said she looked really healthy, but maybe a bit too skinny? Should eat more; Ana always said that while being fit was nice, being too thin could be dangerous to one’s health. (She always tried to get him to eat more whenever he came home, slipping him extra slices of cake.)
A soft nudge against his face made him blink from his thoughts, smiling down at his concerned Tsum. He gently nuzzled against zir soft fluff, taking comfort from zir in the way no one other than a Tsum could give him.
Tony blinked blearily up at him, because that made no sense, ever, but then one of those magical hands was sliding up his back, which, yes, more please, but then it was
With Rhodey, there was definitely no romantic feelings at all, he knew that; Rhodey was his brother, through and through. For Pepper, it was almost the same warm feeling, and he still felt it, but it was more like what he felt for Rhodey.
“-NO POP-TARTS IN THE JUNGLE? THE AUDACITY-” Thor roared, followed by Clint’s manly screams, loud laughter, and the sound of the living room - yet again - getting trashed.
Pepper made him feel things he never felt before; and it was months after working with her that, late one night when he was on day two of a working binge and was zoning out with his thoughts (again) lingering on Pepper, he wondered if he wasn’t quite as ace as he thought.
Now that he was aware of it, actually, it would probably be even better if he smelled more like Steve. It made sense.
“...Right. Clint, call Wanda to have Vision pilot the Quinjet come pick us up - and no, you can’t pilot the Quinjet, you’re still banned from almost crashing it into a tree because you forgot the fuel canisters, stop whining - and Bucky, Nat, and Hank, help me get Zemo out of there and in cuffs; Tony, you grab the Chalice, I can see you dying to get it, and Jan, try and find a way out of here that doesn’t require going back through the entire temple.”
In boarding school, he was once asked his thoughts on a ‘foxy girl’ in a magazine one of the boys had snuck in.
And, well… after a few more weeks of dithering, he decided to try it out. At least only the ‘dating’ bit, anyways.
For years, even after his parents died and he went on what he would later admit to as ‘running away from all his responsibilities’, he wouldn’t question his sexuality again, long since made peace with it.
He all but buried his face against Steve’s neck, getting lungfuls of that warm scent which yes, this was the best idea yet, should’ve had it sooner. Steve jumped a little, stopping his petting -
“Sir, I’m sure everything will turn out for the better,” he said, voice gentled to the tone he only used when Tony got like this. Tony hunched in on himself, feeling his already frail heart thud painfully in his chest, staring unseeingly down at the love ball. “You’re both an engineer and a professor of the highest regard; I’m of the assurance it will be alright.”
“It’s not my fault that they translated the text wrong; this is the Chalice of ‘Hot Drink Of Poverty’; they thought it was the Chalice of ‘Blood of Fiery Death’!” Tony said gleefully, kissing Steve’s cheek when he walked into the kitchen and standing up to grab another mug for him.
And of course, by the time Zemo was locked in cuffs and out cold over Bucky’s shoulder, Jan - using her powers to sneak in the small cracks and crevices - had found a secret, ancient passageway - yet again with lit torches; Tony was almost 99% positive it was magic somehow by this point - that led straight out of the temple to a nearby cliffside that had the absolutely gorgeous view of the sunset over the jungle.
It was easy to say that within a few weeks, Tony had come to appreciate his time with his science bro, and that for all that Bruce rarely initiated touch, Tony was more than happy that he seemed fine and more than a bit amused to his hugs and casual touches.
At least, it looked kind of like a robot; it was takin’ it’s time growing and changing colors, but it was pink-ish and had weird armor-like parts to it with what looked like a mask...
Look, trying to get Tony to eat healthier on a normal day was a challenge; when he was turned into an adorable small bunny? Steve honestly would prefer fighting Doombots, any day; easier to do by far.
But Steve had the warmest smile on his face, like Tony just gave him the key to life, the universe, and everything, and the way it made Tony’s heart just swell… yeah, Tony was pretty sure this was love.
For now, he gave a gentle kiss against one of those floppy ears, smiling goofily when it twitched, and carefully carried his precious cargo out to the living room, box of promised fruit in hand.
Of course, waking up was a surprise in and of itself, and if he believed in such things he would have called it a miracle.
And when Clint and the others started cheering, startling the two of them, but Steve only tightening his arms in embarrassment like he thought Tony would run away, Tony himself laughing giddily about all of it, he thought, well, maybe it was okay to be unsure, it didn’t make him ‘broken’.
Within a month, they both accepted Tony’s casual (and cautious; Tony didn’t push as he didn’t want them to be uncomfortable, but he still slipped sometimes when he was tired) touches, and even initiated more than a few.
Outside, the zombies were banging against the weak walls of the bar, their patchy jobs of holing up in the broken building not going to last against the horde much longer, not for the fact that Steve could pick up the distinct grunts of Berserkers closing in.
He had turned the corner and was sprinting towards the bar at the other end of the decimated street when instincts had him turn and raise his shield, grunting when a large force rammed against him.
“You can have more when you eat your vitamins and vegetables,” Steve compromised, not even caring that he was almost pleading at this point.
Another warm laugh, wrapping around him and his heart like a soft, fluffy blanket when he was in the midst of another terrible Heat or down with a horrible cold. “I guess that answered that question, then.”
The only plus side about any of this was the fact that Tony was getting the tactile affection he craved and deserved, all without having to verbally ask, which Steve knew was hard for him on a good day.
“...Hi,” Tony breathed after a beat, staring up at him. Steve felt his heart skip a beat at how vulnerable the smaller man seemed.
Tony continued to pace, as he had been for a good - he glanced at his grandfather clock - half an hour or so. (Distantly he wondered at how he hasn’t worn down the polish of the floor yet.) He chewed his lip, continuously glancing between the clock and the pink pokeball in his hand.
He hoped to meet them soon; they would have so much fun together, especially if his Soulmate really could fly, robot or not!
- so he didn’t; not when Father yelled at him, not when he threw the bottle, not when he was sent sprawling on the ground and pushed away.
Tony stayed silent (a rarity), continuing to stare up at him with his large eyes, but something cautiously hopeful entered them, making them seem even more soft and vulnerable.
“Don’t apologize, Tony,” Steve says in a broken whisper. “It’s the last thing I’d expect from you. After everything I’ve done—“
Still, he stays in his seat as they file out of the room. Natasha stands shoulder to shoulder with the king. Vision maintains his position standing to the side of the chair Wanda is occupying, one hand on its back rest, and looks solemnly at the others. He seems tense, though, as much as he always is. And Natasha’s face is set in grim determination, the way it is before a mission, and Steve feels dread coiling in his stomach. Clearly, this wasn’t just a friendly gathering for lunch.
Tony was expecting a fight, now. When he hadn’t before; when he had expected the soldier to listen before, Steve had been the one with his hackles up. Steve had been the idiot who had refused compromise when he should have. Now it was his turn to repay Tony, to show him that they could make it through. That they had a chance, damn it. Starting with working through the things that had torn them apart in the first place.
“That’s a dic-“Sam’s eyes went wide when four pairs of a tiny eyes turned to him.”-tator move, man. Lang would totally rock the Pacific Waters.”
“That was the plan all along,” Tasha said ruefully. She nodded at T’Challa, and then a projection of the revisions popped up on the conference table. The name, the Edwin and Maria Protection for and from Super Powered Individuals Act popped up and pride threatened to burst Tony’s chest, seemed to catch most of the people around off guard.
The Avengers are mine?! Which Avengers?! The android that spent his whole fucking existence pining over someone without knowing how to deal with the emotional turmoil that heartbreak is?! The kid who wanted so
Steve can’t help the smile he gives him before he leans down to kiss him, rough and fiercely like every morning they’ve woken up together, and Tony’s hands weave into his hair. Morning breath be damned, Steve deepens the kiss and presses closer to his husband. God,
“Not anymore,” Carol says tightly. “Look, I can tell you my sob story later if you want. Though I don’t remember much of it, and I don’t think telling you is going to be much help. Right now, we’re entering Terra’s solar system and we will be there soon enough. So how about a plan before we get there?”
He flips it open and puts the speaker up to his ear, but words fail him. What is he supposed to do now? What does he say? Where does he start? Is
Because it’s not like that. It kills Tony to lose him to someone else, but he’s better off this way. He’s better off hero worshipping someone like Steve and not a man with the moniker of Merchant of Death following him wherever he goes.
. I’m in the Avengers compound, guys! There’s nowhere I would be safer!” Tony bites his lip to keep from saying something that would destroy that particular illusion. From behind him, he can hear a quiet exhale, as if it had been punched out, and he immediately knows it came from Cap. “Tony, you gave me a choice with the Accords. You… you let choose, for better or worse, you gotta let me do it now.”
“Exactly, so for all Stark knows Vision has switched sides and might not be as trustworthy as he thought he was. Look, I know it’s been two years, but this is Stark. I may not know him that well, but I know the guy has trust issues. In his mind, it’s probably not that big of a leap to think any of us could convince Vision to hack into his system and find out what he’s doing.”
“Thanks,” Tony said and found that he really meant it. “And you can call me Tony, you know. Since we’re like three seconds away from braiding each other’s hair.”
And yet, nothing has prepared him for facing the wrath of a mother incensed at the fact that he can’t seem to watch his fucking mouth around her prepubescent kid. Just remembering the last conversation he’d had with Harley’s mother gives him shivers. The trek from the conference room to the communal dining room is solemn in his and the squirt’s parts. Cap, the bastard, has amusement rolling out of him in waves.
