“You’re a real piece of work, aren’t you?” Steve breathes, and Tony hadn’t realized that he’d tipped his head further forward to rest on the mail of Steve’s shirt. He moves to pull back, but Steve’s hand keeps him in place.
Steve opened the file and scanned through. “An education initiative?” he said doubtfully. “I feel like maybe the government has already ruined me on that front.”
“Colonel!” Captain America shouts from the other side of the crater. “We could use your help over here!”
“Mom said. Dad always said you weren’t, but then she told him he was lying, and that the more he lied the more true it was.”
…), keeping the Stones secure. No one had come for them, even while Bruce fretted over the time machine and counted the days until it would be ready. He wasn’t wrong—the Stones needed to get gone, but now that he was here…his mind kept going places it shouldn’t. Spinning with possibilities, temptations.
“Depends,” Natasha said, tilting her head. Liquid gold cut rivulets down her arms adding to the stains on her cuffs, dripping from her fingers. “Let’s just say he’s more open to negotiation.”
“It may help to talk to someone,” Fury suggested, after a week. “I know you and Romanov have been getting along, but maybe someone with a little more expertise might be helpful.”
“It’s a maybe.” He could feel her receding, becoming hard and faceted. Then, glittering and remote: “Now don’t fuck it up. You’re running out of time.”
But he’s exhausted and he’s hurting and the adrenaline is draining out of him so he almost doesn’t hear it when Clint turns to Tony and says, “The hell were you gonna do if you got stuck on the other side of the universe, Stark?”
Pepper blew out a breath, and managed a smile. “In that case, can’t wait to see you after, Mr. Stark.”
Tony nodded. “I usually just go down to the workshop after. Design some new things. Break some shit.”
with them back. We all need to take care of communities first, ground level, and I have a little experience with that, so. Probably go and see where I can do the most good.”
Tony flushed. "I mean, I kind of have to, if we want to get out of the Stones. My suit, your gauntlet."
“Oh yeah? Good for him. Thanks, honey.” Pepper picked her up and swung her onto her hip with the ease of long practice.
“After I broke out. Made quite an exit, shooting straight up into the sky in my scrap metal tank.” He gestured the curve of his trajectory—up gracefully, parabolic, and then down with a crash.
He tried to ignore the fact that he felt bereft, all of a sudden. He remembered belatedly that Tony owed him a ‘tablet’.
Now that there was no longer the imminent danger of Captain America’s entirely avoidable death, Tony braced himself for having to explain everything. Normally he loved explaining things, but.
“Oh, I know,” Steve said, burrowing back down and grabbing Tony’s hand, which had slipped off his waist during the surprise visit. “‘Swhy I said 45 minutes and not ten.”
Steve would have been more comfortable walking in on them in bed together. He couldn’t quite make himself look away.
“Well, that depends,” Clint said slowly, unfolding himself from the car. “Your mission just got a hell of a lot easier. I, on the other hand, am going to catch so much shit.”
Pepper looked up from where she was curled on the edge of the couch not occupied by Steve’s sleeping form. “No progress?” she inquired.
Steve clenched his jaw, and gave a sharp nod. He looked over at Tony, whose face was carefully without expression.
As Steve watched him load up the car from the porch, Bucky came up to stand beside him. “You sure about this?”
He didn’t know how long he stayed that way, wide awake and wanting, feeling guilty for wanting, wanting anyway. He’d never even touched Tony, not like...
“Are you going to let me get to class or what?” Steve says finally, gesturing at Tony’s general slump across the width of Steve’s office door.
Tony’s hand transformed into something conical and bristling, like a drill head, connecting to all of the crenelations and contact points in the port. The Cradle’s hum tightened to a whine and then abruptly dropped down to a deep, pulsing whir.
“This is blatant exploitation of my powers,” Strange said dryly, “but yes. I’m looking forward to working with you, Dr. Cho.”
“That could have gone far worse,” Pepper croaked. “Now go back to sleep. In 45 minutes, Steve has to make bacon, or his life and honor are forfeit.”
Tony was referring to. He wasn’t about to ask. He’d never really known where he stood in Tony’s estimations, over the years; he’d mostly assumed the worst, because he’d done Tony the discourtesy of the same plenty of times. Now he might know a bit better, but the shadows of feeling he'd been privy to remained too abstract for him to be sure.
Pepper had her eyes closed, swaying along in his arms. He was humming along to the recording, low and half tuneless, nothing but a faint rhythm and a meandering line that slid in and out of recognizability.
hey let’s not talk about it let’s talk about you, they haven’t drained all your blood yet and stuff, right
“We need a theme, a central set of tenets, and a way of reaching kids who might otherwise go overlooked. When Tony and I first started laying the groundwork, it was all about targeting non-magnet schools—places where resources were scarce. It was going to be all science and engineering programs, small-scale, but with a lot of freedom to adapt them to the needs of many skill levels and demographics. But it could be anything. I’d be interested to get your take on what you think the world might need in its next generation, having gone through everything that it has in the past few years.”
“How are you getting along with SHIELD’s personnel?” Dr. Feranza asked. “Are you making any friends?”
“It’s not,” Tony replies cheerily, but then he’s drawing a silver card case out of his pocket and extracting a card from it. He comes forward and snatches a pen out of Steve’s pencil holder, and Steve catches the faint traces of his cologne as he passes. “But,” Tony continues, scribbling on the card, “It
“I didn’t think you would. For one, it wouldn’t work unless we built another glove, the one Tony used wasn’t even made to hold them, he just—actually, I don’t know how the hell he managed to wear them the way he did. Anyway, you wouldn’t and you can’t. But I get the temptation, I get...wanting to fix things.”
“He is right to be concerned,” the Ancient One said, calmly. “You are very strong, Captain, but no body, no matter how strong, can house two souls indefinitely.”
“It’s nice to know that you’ll catch me,” Steve said with finality. “That’s a thing I like to know about my friends.”
“Threw Fury’s words back in his face,” Tony grinned. “I broke you, I bought you. And now I’m buying you lunch.”
Tony looks at him, and Steve lets him. He doesn’t know what Tony sees. Realizes that he hasn’t cared about that in a while, but he does now, suddenly and strongly.
“I’m fine,” Steve said, pawing at the sofa in a bid to pull himself upright. He had no help in that regard; Tony pushed him back into the cushions, and Pepper parked herself close to his ankles, where she could hold his knees in place. He exhaled in halting puffs, and then looked up at Tony’s faceplate. “Natasha came to see me.”
As she steps out the door to the lab, slamming it behind her, a section of her desk, black-stained in the shape of fingers, crumbles, and quietly implodes with a puff of red.
From his comfortable vantage point on the couch, Steve considered the possibility that he, once again, had made a terrible, selfish mistake in bringing Tony back. He didn’t want to think so, but the possibility presented itself at every small interaction, every moment that Tony remained working at the designs.
He found her upstairs in her study after following the sound of what he thought was maybe a radio, playing something vaguely pianistic, more of Steve’s era than Pepper’s. When he got to the source, he found that Tony was with her.
“They appear to be trying the divide and conquer approach, sir,” JARVIS replies, “But their approach is unorthodox at best.”
“Five with restrictions,” Fury answered. “I’m entrusting you all with this information,” he took a moment to glare at Natasha, who remained unmoved, “For the benefit of Captain Rogers. You are now his resources and connections to the modern world. Be considerate and helpful, to SHIELD standards.”
Visions assailed Steve, oversaturated and otherworldly: the Avengers tower, but strange, covered in dust, the air sulfurous. Away, to Sokovia, then the stars, winking into nothing, one by one. A growing, pursuing hunger.
The lights around the lab brighten slightly. Tony’s not really sure if JARVIS meant them to. “Of course. How could I forget?” JARVIS says, perhaps even warmer.
Less nice maybe that it was caused by Sam’s pointed, low-key razzing of everything from Bucky’s hair to his suit to his general everything, and Bucky’s narrow-eyed retorts that might at some point escalate into an attempt at putting Sam into a headlock, but. Steve would take his amusement where he could get it.
Everything was tinged orange. Pepper and Rhodes were frozen, as if they were caught behind a screen of color. Only Steve, Tony, and the herald seemed normal, able to breathe and move.
“Well,” and Steve could hear the smirk even with Tony’s faceplate firmly in place, “That’s what you are, isn’t it? At least for now.”
ready too, for reasons he is not entirely ready to face yet. Never mind that what he’s constructing is worryingly tailored to his tastes.
He nodded again, dumbly. His hands were shaking a little. He pulled away, and they both let him. “I’m gonna,” he started. Made an abortive gesture at the doorway.
“You know what they want us to do, right?” Tony says. His eyes are smudged black with exhaustion, his temples are sticky with stale sweat. His hands are trembling around the crystal in his hand, the scotch inside rippling like a slow, unending earthquake.
As she slides into the back of the town car and exhales in a huff, Happy casts a look at her in the rear view mirror. “Where to, Pepper?” he asks sympathetically.
“Uhuh.” Tony scooped more shrimp onto his rice and poked it around. “So this is awkward, but I think you sent me an email you weren’t meaning to send.”
He thought about Pepper’s reddened eyes in the dead of night, of Morgan’s quiet, simple grief. Thought of his own failures, and the muddled, stumbling path he saw for himself going forward.
Tony had stopped, blinked, studied what he had been about to do with the gauntlet in his hand, and frowned. “Why?” he asked.
“Connection complete,” Helen said, eyes darting over several screens-worth of readings. “Beginning the data-read.”
“Sleep well?” Jim asked, finishing with the eggs and sliding one portion towards Morgan, who immediately started digging in.
“But if we don’t,” Tony said, grateful that his voice lacked critical nuance at the moment, “Will you. Will I still be your husband?”
Tony looks tired, when Steve comes into the offices at Stark Tower. It’s…disturbing. Steve’s seen Tony tired before, of course, numerous times, but it’s always been tinged with manic energy, a last crackle of fight that keeps his tongue sharp and his eyes focused. The bags under his eyes this time speak of slow, grinding exhaustion that Steve remembers seeing in the eyes of his men, when they’d been walking for weeks, sleeping fitfully in foxholes.
“I would really appreciate having some time to do some trials first,” Helen said. “You know, so I don’t accidentally kill you.”
“And because it’s great foreplay,” Tony adds. He frowns. “Which reminds me, Steve, we haven’t actually followed through with that, yet.”
the universe, in their way.” She waved at the herald. “And you’ve done us a great favor, pulling him here. We were having a hell of a time tracking him down.”
Which was how Steve ended up splitting his enormous amount of free time either sparring with Natasha or reading heavily redacted files.
It seems a lot closer when Jane dreams, though. Malekith’s vision of the destruction of the universe crowds in then, a cloying red and black darkness. She worries at those memories, picking at them like hangnails, because why? What properties could the aether have, if it isn’t just a substance, but can hold
Fury looked at him squarely. “You lived in interesting times during the 40s. I would argue that you’re also living in interesting times now. Push comes to shove, I would want you on my side.”
“We’ve got a few of those running around the house,” Pepper agreed. “I think we can probably fit one more.”
“Yeah,” Steve choked. He couldn’t feel his fingers. He looked out at the water and didn’t see it at all.
Tony didn’t have normal expressions any more, but that was enough to prompt a reaction; he felt his faceplate rippled in surprise. “Oh? I didn’t think she could.”
Fury tried to argue that they could get a helicopter to take Steve back to SHIELD in a fraction of the time, and normally Tony would have agreed, but he looked at Steve staring out at the sea, bundled in spare Navy uniforms and sweaters, his hands wrapped up in the sleeves, and he had the sneaking suspicion that suddenly appearing back in the city would probably just compound the surreality of Steve’s position. So he dug his heels in, and they stayed on the boat.
Steve supposes that, of all the deaths he could have, that would have been a pretty good one. But feeling nostalgic for it, like it was something to be preferred over what was happening now, even this awkward, bizarrely delicious meal with dangerous people he barely knows, is a disconcerting reaction to see.
It’s Fury who actually goes up to the suited guy, bypassing the officer at the desk entirely. And yeah, when the Deputy Chief plays secretary, it’s fairly clear that something’s up.
“A personal favorite of mine, I must confess,” the Ancient One said. She settled on a divan and crossed her legs neatly beneath her. “Now, we have about twenty minutes before Dr. Banner shows up. There are unintended and unforeseen consequences, it seems, to Tony Stark’s sacrifice.”
Steve peels off from where he’s standing with Clint and Natasha, shoulders squared as he goes to stand next to Fury, only to be replaced by Tony. “It’s that trafficking case,” Tony says to them immediately, gaze fixed on Fury and Cap. “I just got a call from a guy from Scotland Yard.”
“I will cancel the meeting,” she said. “But try not to piss off Director Fury too much on your way out. I’m the one who has to field calls from Coulson when you irritate him.”
They hadn’t ended up cuddling, though it had been close. When Steve had woken early the next morning, it was to find Tony on his back and Steve twisted on his side and front, facing him. His hand had curled around the inside of Tony’s bicep, and his face had been smashed into the pillow next to Tony’s shoulder, close enough to nearly press his mouth to the skin exposed by the rucked up sleeve of Tony’s thin, worn t-shirt. His knee rested lightly over Tony's thigh, as if Steve had wanted to keep him in place.
On the couch, Steve suddenly sucked in a huge draft of air, and his eyes opened. Within half a second, Tony had dismissed all of the screens in front of him, and Pepper’s tablet was on the floor.
“So you should probably examine why you can’t do that in this case. I suspect it has something to do with the fact that you care about Steve Rogers as a person.”
“I am so not qualified for this conversation,” Clint murmurs. And then, more audibly, “We appreciate what you’re doing here, Tony. Really, we do. But we also know you’ve got stuff to do for SI, and for SHIELD, and so you really don’t have to put us at the top of the list. We’re fine with what we have.”
), and so he had to keep them in his coat, or in a drawer. They would have looked more welcome sitting on his desk, waiting for him.
“Hey, you’re awake,” Sam said, walking in. “Thought I heard some grumpy old men shooting the shit. How’re you feeling?”
“I’m not copying Google’s user interface look,” Tony snaps. “It’s an affront to my inventor-warrior spirit.”
“Huh. That’s…huh.” He opened his mouth to say more, and then spun away, moving back into his usual chatter.
“We just had to go for the most complicated option, huh?” she said finally. “When it was both of us.”
“By not actually slowing down,” she said wryly, one eyebrow twitching upward. “Just redirecting his energies. How do you think the power came back on so soon after the Snap?”
The song meandered back into a chorus, then a slow bridge that spiraled up and up before cresting and winding back down on the recapitulation, a mournful clarinet crying at the close. They slowed and then halted.
“On what grounds?” Tony said, outraged. “I made this boat! I mean, not personally, I don’t generally waste my time with ancient standing orders, but I totally signed off on R&D having a ball with it—”
“Only you would be able to comfort a member of an entirely different species,” Tony mutters. “Where are the other refugees?”
Bucky knows the score now, and he’s the first to admit that he hates it, enough that when Tony starts pressing on his bruises and announcing it to all and sundry, Bucky actually appreciates it.
“I have another file request,” Steve said, twisting the ball of athletic tape he’d just unwound from his hands.
“Mr. Stark, could you please come to the conference room now?” Coulson called from down the hall, looking harried. “You’re meant to be two floors up.”
“Why didn’t you go to medical?” Bucky mutters, leading them both over to one of the benches where he spies a first aid kit lying nearby. “Do you actually want some more battle scars?”
“Photo, bottom drawer of the second tool drawer in the workshop,” Bruce says, backing away towards the hall.
“Given the data I’ve acquired from SHIELD and my own pattern recognition software, I would hazard that the child is asking if it is safe now.”
“Fair enough,” Tony said at last. He looked past Steve towards the lake. “I guess I’ll have to get back to the real world now, huh? Body intact and all, the paperwork’s going to be hell. Pepper’s already having all kinds of regrets.”
“He’s...I mean the readings are all fine,” Bruce said, darting around the control panel. “He returned the Stones, but—”
She nodded. “Yes, I put him at the end of the hall. I can...let me make sure everything’s…” She drifted off. Of course everything was still there. But.
Even when I didn’t want to go, I was relieved to, because it meant I knew what to do. How did Tony—I want to take his advice, I want to know what that’s like, to be able to build something, something
“I should never have let you have access! Traitor!” Tony turns to Steve. “I was five. This is totally excusable.”
Natasha stilled. “Was that…?” Her eyes narrowed. “Tony. How exactly is he planning on getting you back? I get that he thinks I can maybe just get back into my body or something, but you...” She put her hands on his shoulders and stared, eyes flashing like a cat’s in the dark. “...No.”
It was around this time that Steve started to feel the beginnings of a horrible sort of trepidation.
But Natasha was off on her mission, and Dr. Feranza was taking his answers with more and more caution, given his willingness to go out of bounds.
He was glad some of his friends might be able to take the advice he’s been doling out for the past five years. For someone who’s done as much time travel as he has, he’s never felt so stuck.
“Doesn’t have to be in uniform,” Pepper assured. “In fact, it would probably work best without it.” Steve could tell by her suppressed smile, however, that she was thinking about those damned PSAs. He
It’s at this point that Tony and Bucky come tumbling into the room and then abruptly straighten themselves out like somehow that wouldmake them look respectable.
“I’ll never get used to that,” she remarked, grinning. “Being a Missus. I used to have to correct people constantly, and now I don’t have to anymore.”
“Sometimes Fury sends me out to scout for talent,” Tony says, sly grin firmly back in place. “Let’s just say I have an eye for it.”
The Bleeding Edge suit grew like flower beds blooming in quick-time, like paint diluting in water. It didn’t look the same as before. Mostly silver and limned with iridescence.
“Uh huh.” she drags a chair around from the far side of the room and throws herself into it. “Tell me.”
It had been the right decision to go with SHIELD, getting off the rescue ship. Steve had been sure of it then, and he continued to be sure now. He knew also, from what he had gathered about SHIELD’s activities, covert and in cooperation with other governments, that Fury and his organization were generally as morally well-aligned as any large group with this many ties to less-scrupulous powers could be. He wanted to do his duty, wanted to be okay enough to continue to do his job if he was going to be alive and awake in this new time, and being at SHIELD was the best way he could see of achieving that.
“Ah,” Natasha said, mouth twisting into something resembling a smirk. “I suppose I could get his file for you. For a price.”
For caedesdeo's prompt: "1: Steve doesn’t follow rules, he knows how easily they twist so he can’t believe in them, and he’ll never follow something if he doesn’t believe in. 2: (probably Tony?) I am king in a kingdom of ashes, I burnt it down to prevent its ruin."
And then slowly, the suit parted, peeling away from Steve’s lax face and reforming behind him, into a shape slightly different than before, slimmer and a little more like the Iron Man suit. The neck and shoulders followed, peeling out and down, until the wire frame was stepping forward and around to steady Steve when his knees buckled.
“You know I’ll never say no to that.” Darcy slurps from her own coffee. “But seriously, is something up? Something about the aether, or whatever?”
“I was bought when you caught me falling from the Chrysler Building, really,” Clint admits. “And when you lied to Fury about my fractured scapula.”
“Steve and I were discussing whether you’d be amenable to us taking you to bed. Possibly more than once. Possibly regularly.”
“Sure,” Helen said, drawing out the ‘r’ in a highly suspicious manner, though her expression was one of amusement. “Let me just save my work. You go on ahead.”
“You.” Steve stops. Tries to put his brain in order. “I’m sorry, are you allowed to work on the water mains? I feel like that’s a violation of something.”
The Cradle made an urgent sound, and Steve’s ears popped. Next to him, Jim and Pepper flinched. Tony shouted and grabbed his wrist above where it entered the port.
Steve’s on a side street, and he’s taken down two bots already, but there are three more and they’re gaining ground. His left side is red from the shoulder down with blood.
He waits for a pause in the drilling, and then knocks as loudly as he can. The singing abruptly cuts off, and is replaced by swearing. There’s a series of clanking and clunking noises, followed by harried steps towards the door. Then the door is thrown open to reveal…oh.
The shock of transfer wasn’t quite so bad this time, but it left him gasping for air, hiding behind a concierge desk in the lobby. Memories
“Okay, I got one,” Tony whispered, and even under his breath he sounded hoarse. “What’s the difference between pink and purple?”
Since then, Tony had been treading carefully around Steve, but had made a point of being around, answering Steve’s questions with patience that Steve doubted was characteristic. He’d shown Steve some common technology around the ship—newest designs in radar and navigation, and then a handheld device that seemed to serve as not only a telephone, but every other conceivable connection to the rest of the world. Steve almost couldn’t believe it, but he’d seen the ‘Iron Man’ armour up close now, and…well. That was hard to beat.
She mulled that over. “You should stay,” she concluded. “Uncle Happy and Uncle Rhodey are staying, too. So you should stay.”
Asgard was easy enough. Frigga guided them through the palace with kindness and a soft smile, and even accepted Mjolnir back with good grace.
Steve shrugged. “I’ve got nowhere else to be.” He felt acutely aware of the calling card sitting in his trouser pocket.
“That you actually liked him. The whole ‘helpful’ thing was a clue, but you never know. Anyway, I’m glad you went out, because I try to generally stay clear of him—I stabbed him with a syringe last time we worked together and he’s still bitter, even though it kept him alive for long enough to save himself,” she said, unwrapping athletic tape from her knuckles. “I try to be accommodating when I’m without outside instructions. Besides, I like him best in small doses.”
Tony made a questioning noise, from deep in the guts of a prototype. Just because he wasn’t allowed to leave his robo-body yet didn’t mean he couldn’t work on the means of escape in the meantime. And he needed a distraction from the whole
, but: I want to kiss you extremely, desperately badly right now,” Tony said, breaking through the sudden haze in Steve’s awareness. “However, I promised Pep I wouldn’t until she was around.”
this is an insult, I am insulted. And a few week’s not gonna do shit, what have I already told you about how long it’s been since Afghanistan. Hang on, you’re gonna need to lean with me on this turn.”
“Well,” Pepper said, picking up her glass again and taking a long sip, “That’s a good place to start, then. Tony had help; so will you.”
He shook his head, turning to try and follow her line of sight. Nothing. He said, “Steve misses you.”
“I was never a very good student,” Steve admitted. The words barely got out; his throat still felt on the verge of closing up. “Though I do like to learn.”
The whole suit of Tony ignited. Electrical arcs in all colors, like the Stones were all still there. But, Steve thought wildly, all that power was
For the anon prompt: "The one technologically-related thing (or one of the things) Steve is better at than Tony."
“You remembered to bring a paper bag, though,” Steve says, his own smile crooked and warm, even while the rest of him was still red with embarrassment.
But. Well. He couldn’t quite shake how lost Steve had looked, when he’d last seen him. Burgeoning computer skills aside, Tony knew better than most that learning new things and staying busy could cover up a lot.
Tony just stayed like that, moving his thumb along Steve’s jawline, for inexorable moments. Then he pulled away. Steve almost followed his hand, his eyes half closed.
“Seven minutes,” Tony replies, because he’s been watching that damn status on his HUD every second he hasn’t been blasting robots into oblivion or dodging searing blasts of plasma. “Fury says there’s an attack in DC, so they’re spread thin, too.”
He did, and it was a little better. Pepper breathed a little easier between them, and knew she was going to be okay when she automatically began compiling a mental list of all of the agencies and lawyers she was going to have to call.
past postmod here. Meanwhile, what is it you do again? The Enlightenment? Rhymin’ and stealin’ with Pope?”
“Okay,” Darcy says, a little more slowly. (Jane had told her, briefly, about what had happened on Asgard, what had happened to her when she’d slipped through universes in the middle of the warehouse. Darcy had stared at her for a long moment, and then wrapped her in a bear hug while whispering fiercely, “Red means
“Agreed, Dean of Winchester!” Thor proclaims. “Pie is indeed the most precious of Midgardian delights.”
Pepper was well-versed in sharing significant looks with Rhodey. They practically had their own language now, a choice range of eyebrow raises, eye flicks, and mouth twists that had in the past been almost exclusively used to talk about Tony when he was being especially himself.
. His autonomic responses seemed to just...fall asleep, like the circulation was getting cut off. And then Tony would reach out in a panic, jiggling the lax muscles, sparking the neurons back to life, and every time it was like reaching into a tub of non-Newtonian fluid—easy to stick a hand in, very difficult to yank it back out.
Sam rolled his eyes. “Just a little. Sure.” He crossed his arms. “Stark’s downstairs working on building himself a body. It’s creepy as shit. Do you want to see?”
Steve counted out his breaths. Was too aware of his own heartbeat, the clamminess of Pepper’s hand and his own.
Bruce breaks the silence. “We might,” he concedes. “But I wouldn’t mind waiting a while before confirming that.”
“No,” Steve argued. “I want to know what you’re doing.” He stopped, and stared at Tony, who immediately froze under his gaze and tried to think about anything other than his current form. “Wow,” Steve said after a moment. “You’re very shiny right now.”
Numbers collected first, binary then algorithms then a Mandelbrot set of iterations, memories building memories building memories down the rabbit hole. It felt like falling, and like time travel, and like the frozen darkness of space.
Tony’s exit from the Power Stone came like a thunderclap. It disrupted the force field surrounding the Stone’s chamber to the extent that Steve was able to slip it back inside unscathed.
She smiled with one corner of her mouth, her eyes sad. Then she frowned. “I didn’t see it. And now you’re not attached. Or,” she stepped back and took his hand between hers, “Huh. I guess you are, but it’s not very strong.”
“What?” Tony asks, resting his chin on Bucky’s shoulder. “You want in on this, Barnes? Because I, for one, would not say no.”
She squeezes her eyes shut, and when she opens them again, it’s just numbers in front of her, no red in sight.
All of that amounted to having to build some sort of port between the suit and the Cradle, which meant designing some adaptations.
“Frankly, we’re on way better terms with the non-Judeo-Christian types at this point,” Sam says. “When a rogue EMF signal manifests as a friendly Norse god, it’s a pretty good day for us.”
As it happened, Tony was not quite using the Tony Stark Definition of ‘Fine’ (TM)—a.k.a., close to a mental breakdown but hiding it pretty successfully—but he was coming close.
“Like you said, hidden depths,” Steve replies over Bucky’s head, which, goddamnit, Bucky’s beginning to really miss being taller than this asshole. “I think you missed your calling, Buck. Conflict resolution, it’s the new thing.”
For rachelgamage's prompt: "Teen Wolf (or any fandom) based off of Buffy Halloween episode where everyone turns into their costumes."
a decent question, thank you. Very difficult to tell—it’s always harder to identify absence. I’ve got math, I’ve got some memories, though not all, I suspect, and I’ve got—hm. I’m very calm, am I always this calm?”
“I should never have taught you colloquialisms,” Tony says, wincing, his head becoming visible behind a fortress of broken Iron Man parts. There are visible lacerations along his neck and shoulders, and he’s hunched like his ribs are giving him trouble.
Tony was not prepared for this. He bit his lip, and said, “Okay, last question first—I’m just a guy. Uh. Here, see?” He pulled away from the Captain’s grip and shed the armour in pieces that packed into a neat assemblage in the corner of the room. It left him in jeans and a long sleeve henley that was slightly damp with sweat from the flight. “And as for your colonel, well...um. It took us a while to find you, Cap.”
When he had returned the Stones, he’d left the old gauntlet behind. It was sitting on a wire shelf, amid other half-disassembled things. He hovered over it for a second, and then cautiously slipped it on.
“Right. So yeah, I’ll get you on the internet, where all the crazies live. Don’t let Fury know you’ve been there.”
“He goes by Red Shift. Been around for a very long time, and has been the cause of a lot of grief ever since he got a hold of these,” she patted the pommel of one of the swords. “Not sure how he found them in the first place, but their ability to cut portals between worlds and universes is...inconvenient to our agenda. Hopefully he won’t be bothering anyone else anymore.”
Pepper took Steve’s face in her hands, her gaze sharpening and then widening. “Steve, why are your eyes
“I might as well just show you,” Clint said, shoving the photo into his pocket. “Come on. No need to break in anywhere if we play our cards right. Benji, you can come to. I have a feeling he’ll like you.”
The stones felt heavy in their case. Steve gripped the handle of it tightly, and stepped onto the platform.
Tony digested this, and then said lightly, “And so you wanted to see a bit more of the modern world?”
“Feelings are often very unfortunate,” she agreed. “That’s why I stick to science and physical lust.”

He could have asked for more time, he supposed. It had already been nearly a month of staying at the lake house (getting used to making breakfast for Morgan, helping Bruce with construction, swapping stories with Rhodes, talking and planning with Pepper—Pepper, Tony’s
Late in the night, Steve found himself out on the porch, as always. The crickets were nearly deafening out here, it was sort of incredible. He hadn’t really been in the woods this way since the war, and its sounds were a constant source of fascination, even now, after months.
“So obviously you’re going to have to fix this,” she continued while refusing to look at him, “So that I can marry you again.”
Steve has been working himself up to making some sort of announcement for about a week and a half when suddenly Tony and Bucky are outed on national television, at which point all of his planning goes out the window in favour of an overabundance of righteous indignation.
“Holding steady,” Pepper said, rallying. “We’re deploying a lot of support to post-Snap restoration organizations, which is depleting some of our general capital, but we’re making enough with new sales and reinstatements to keep the lights on.”
“As ever.” He put himself next to the Cradle and set a silver hand down on the open tines of the port. “See you all on the flip side.”
The door slammed open and both of them jumped. “Okay, Stark, you’ve had your ogling time, now—“ Fury stopped in the doorway, and then his eyes narrowed. “Captain. You’re awake. We weren’t informed.” He sent a glare in Tony’s direction.
That means, however, that he misses Tony walking forward silently until he comes into view directly under Steve’s face. Steve startles, nearly beans himself on Tony’s head when he yanks his own up to step back, and is caught only by the hand Tony curls around his chin, firm and warm.
“The mark,” Clint agreed, manfully restraining himself from rolling his eyes because he feared if he started he might never stop. “Tony fucking Stark.”
Tony looks at the three men (or two men, one god…whatever), and shrugs. The board meeting can wait. “I like pie. Also, I’m kinda impressed by how much you’re not freaking out at Thor’s—” He gestures vaguely at Thor, “Thor-ness.”
SHIELD had swooped in before they’d even gotten food in their mouths and taken Loki to a secure location.
Tony had called Captain Bowers, the Navy liaison to the expedition, just to check in, and the man had just said, “Howard was a good friend of mine. I’m happy to take a couple of weeks each year to tool around the north Atlantic for him. Don’t worry about what we’re doing here, and I’ll call if there’s ever a need to make an update.”
“SHIELD. They’re being processed and all the xenolinguists are scrambling to figure out how to communicate.”
“So, uh,” Bruce said, “I need to bring some stuff up from the basement, and the Hulk can’t fit through the door. Could you give me a hand, Steve?”
Tony looks at him, and straightens slightly in the doorway. “You’ll do fine,” he says, more sincerely than Steve’s expecting. “I saw your paper at IU last year–not only was it good stuff, but you made it damned accessible for the interdisciplinary crowd. I think the masters students nearly peed themselves in admiration.”
again, and in our general direction, of all things. God, you should have felt what it was like, being in his skin. It was...”
Bruce did a spit-take into his orange juice. Pepper made a very unladylike snorting noise and slapped Rhodes’s bicep. “Jim!”
“I don’t think Kubler-Ross prepared me for this eventuality,” she said, and oh god, she hated when her voice trembled like that, it was the worst—
Steve definitely flushes for real this time. He really dislikes his complexion sometimes. “That’s, uh. Thanks. I didn’t know you were there for that.”
Natasha remained invaluable. “Heard you saw Stark. I would’ve bought you more time with him if I’d known.”
“And SHIELD’s gonna poke at him until he gives up the secrets to the serum.” Tony twitched. “I can just feel it.”
But he didn’t. He moved a little like DUM-E, like his limbs only partly belonged to him, like nothing was subconscious. He was expressive, but halting.
“But you’d be back somewhere familiar,” Bucky countered. He shoved his hands in his pockets. “Seems like something you’d want. Something you’ve wanted.”
“It doesn’t make any sense.” He shook his head. “And when I tried to dig deeper, I felt bad about it and stopped.”
Fury blinked slowly. “No one warned me you’d be a pain in the ass, Rogers,” he drawled. He didn’t look hugely annoyed, however.
He curled back, the images of themselves unraveling as they separated. “I will. And is that a promise?”
Steve exhaled. Stared at the wall opposite him and tried to focus through his kaleidoscopic, pulsating vision. “Tony?”
(a bit strange, but he thought he could understand why Tony liked it), went to bed, had disturbing dreams, and woke up again. Then he went to have another MRI.
“I’m sorry, fuck, I’m sorry, Pep.” He hands fluttered around her shoulders. She wanted to lean right into his arms and not feel metal, and she knew exactly how horrible it was going to be the moment she put her head on his shoulder and didn’t feel him give.
“If you can call it from the immortal realm, Man of Iron, you are welcome to it,” Thor says, grinning.
“Yeah. And lots of ‘guys’ have tried to make themselves into Captain America.” She punched him in the shoulder. “Since Brooklyn didn’t work out, maybe you should consider another option, huh?”
“Much more recently than you,” she said, waving a hand around. “You know I have no patience for superheroes. He’s just been trying really hard lately, to pay attention and learn, and he’s been
“I can only go between about five floors in the building, and even then a lot of the halls are accessible by a keycard that I don’t have. I’m pretty sure Natasha had to strong arm them into giving me a computer. And the books they—they’re
For shinkonokokoro's prompt: "Okay but, Steve+Tony on the run. And they manage to get 2 male passports. But they have the same last name. So they spend x-weeks on the run pretending 2 b a couple on 2nd honeymoon + then when safe, they figure out the passports are just brothers."
“Consider it cut by the fact that I’m not throwing you bodily out of the room right now. I am, however,
But then Fury happened, and all the rest of his fellow fuckups happened (he supposes Natasha isn’t a fuckup really, but she’s definitely the exception that proves) and then they were in New York,
Tony was perhaps not so unwelcome, however. He’d been, after all, the only reason why Steve hadn’t gone straight from comatose to wreaking havoc on a friendly ship—Steve had been just about ready to bolt until he’d identified the American accent in Tony’s monologue, and then when he’d opened his eyes, the metal suit had proven the potential truth of what Tony said about being in the future. After all, HYDRA might have had weapons that defied modern standards of technology, but their suits had been leather and steel, not the strange, interlocking plates of titanium alloy with which Tony had been adorned.
Tony tipped his smooth, metallic head down, far enough that his chin nearly touched his chest. “Yep.”
“Could never make her do anything but exactly what she wanted to do,” he murmured. “Part of her charm. If she decides to be gone, then she’s gone.”
Steve looked at him. Tony was staring out at the water, his expression relaxed and neutral, which Steve suspected wasn’t his natural state. Steve could see a lot of Howard in him, in his features and his bearing, but he was distinctly different also—Steve would never mistake one for the other. It was acutely painful, however, to look at Tony and know that Howard was gone, and had been gone for a long time.
Tony says, but his ears are bright red, it looks disconcertingly hilarious. Not once has Steve known Tony to be embarrassed by
Rhodes gave him a long look in the morning, but only suggested that Steve bring a phone with him next time. “In case the world needs saving,” he added, with a half smile.
“I get it,” Steve cuts in, and Bucky can’t fucking believe it, he might actually be pouting. “I just don’t think we should treat him like we think that. Have a little class, for god’s sake.”
(And that’s how the Avengers accidentally adopt a lost prince from another universe, and there may or may not be an intergalactic incident or five because of it).
For the anon prompt: "Steve/Tony/Bucky; Steve and Bucky argue on how to woo Tony. Bucky says they should just jump him already whist Steve insists that they should start off by courting him with flowers. Tony may or may not overhear their little argument."
I’m starting to really hate the name Ryerson. Hope I don’t meet anyone with the name later on—might be rude on accident.
“Yeah, well, you’re dear old Dad was also a bit of a sentimental bastard when it came to Captain America.”
“That saying is older than I am!” Bucky called back. He looked at Steve. “I’d say don’t do anything stupid, but frankly, you’ve already gone and done it. I’ve got no stupid to bring with me, because you’ve depleted the resource, you asshole.”
Light flew up from the connection, up in bright rivulets over the edges and articulations of the nanosuit, leaving glowing iridescent trails. “That tickles,” Tony complained. “I didn’t think I could feel ticklish in here.”
JARVIS will choose the right moment, he’s certain. JARVIS has always had a far better sense of timing than him, after all.
“Of course she is.” He couldn’t understand how he could exist in this nanoparticle coffin and still be whole. Where were his neurotransmitters? Where was his grief getting siphoned off and neutralized? Why did he still feel like his hands were shaking when he didn’t have a brain, or adrenal glands, or
that we’re not going to just let you out the front door. Especially if they know where you’re headed. Stark’s an ally, but he’s outside the system in a way that an apartment in Brooklyn wouldn’t have been.” She smiled a little thinly. “Food for thought.”
Jim closes his eyes and tips his head up. "I dunno,“ he says in answer to her. "Either something amazing, or something terrible.”
Tony hummed, and awkwardly rocked the folder in one hand to get a look at more of the pages. “Civics?”
“Not so far as we know,” Fury said. “His cells have aged, albeit not very much while they were effectively cryogenically frozen. We’ll know more after Rogers has had more than a few days to stick around.”
That was enough to wake him fully. He clung to the afterimage of the words, tried to hold them in the foreground of the telescoping, yawning abyss of his own consciousness, but he was stretching wide, too wide in the endless depths, he’d fall apart if he wasn’t careful.
Bucky looked at Steve with a gleam of amusement in his gaze. “So,” he drawled, “I see you’re keeping interesting company as usual, Rogers. Not replacing me already, are you?”
It was so kind and so tactless that for a moment Pepper couldn’t breathe; she stood on nerveless legs and shuffled a few paces over to bend and press a tight, too-firm kiss to her brow. “I know exactly what you mean, baby,” she whispered. “Can I...I can I take your plate?”
“Good, because you’re interfering with Steve’s workspace,” Pepper said, going over to the side table and filling a second glass, which she brought over to Steve. He accepted it with a nod, and inhaled deeply over the rim. It still felt wonderful and decadent to partake in something he most associated first with church, the grapes cloying and cheap, and then later with wartime France, where the flavors had been revelatory. He hadn’t had much to drink to, especially not of Potts-quality, in years. Maybe one of the birthday parties they’d thrown in the tower, before Ultron. Now, it was a small everyday indulgence that Pepper offered as a matter of course, the heavy smell of tannins and dark fruit, the lingering bite of oak on the roof of his mouth.
“Sorry,” Tony said, shoulders pulling in. Pepper looked like she was going to cry, again. God, he was the worst. It would be better if he was de-aged, or just digital, or
He was also holding a tablet PC, which he now waved at Tony. “So you sent this? That redheaded dame said it was a gesture of goodwill from Stark Industries.”
And then there was Tony. Steve had accumulated a lot of those, despite having only his memory and the occasional press release to go on. Scribbles of quick hand movements, steady eyes, mid-conversation. The armor, or what Steve had remembered of it after the fact, full of gleaming surfaces carved out of the pencil lead with judicious eraser.
As it turned out, most of Tony’s idea of culture came from the 80s and 90s. Steve didn’t mind, though. Between him and Natasha, he was beginning to feel fairly caught up.
holy shit steve, is this encrypted? i’m so proud of you buddy it’s like watching a baby bird take flight
Tony wore it like he wore his armor--like he’d stolen lightning from the gods and had it cupped, a thrashing, violent creature, in the cradle of his palms.
, his own personal land of bad memories, and Captain fucking America walked in the door and the first thing he said to Tony was, “
“Are you aware that this means that I want to take you out, preferably somewhere you like but also is suitably expensive (I’ll have JARVIS do a search), and then take you to bed if you’ll let me?”
“I’m fine, sir,” Steve said. He’d fallen into parade rest in front of Fury’s desk, and he decided to stay that way.
“Iron Man’s allowed to be tired, you know,” Steve says carefully, “Just like you’re allowed to be brave.”
“Thanks,” Steve repeated quietly. He pulled away with difficulty, and followed Coulson back into the elevator, and out onto the street.
“It’s just me,” Steve said, a little helplessly. “Telling you that I miss the friend I had. Who I should have kept closer.”
“Good,” she said. “I’m glad you have him. Normally I’d advise to find someone a little more normal to stabilize yourself with, but I guess you’re not particularly normal yourself, huh?”
It hadn’t been a great day. But Howard’s will had decreed that the expeditions carry on for fifty years after his death, and the document itself was about as water-tight as an army of SI lawyers could make it, so there was little Tony or Obadiah could do.
It’s when Natasha says shit like that that Clint wonders what the hell she did before she became a cop.
Tony regarded him. He was so much easier to read now, without a mask in the way—dark eyes sharp, that tell-tale tick at the corner of his mouth that could pull up or down at a moment’s notice.
So Steve filled his room with books and art supplies, and tried to make it seem like a home, at least a little. It was hard, given that he wasn’t sure whether he was supposed to have the tablet or phone Tony had given him (the answer was probably
“Well,” Rhodes drawled, “Isn’t it? Thor’s got his people to care for, and Nebula and the others are headed back to space. Clint’s retiring for the eighth time. I could go, but I’ve got shit to do.”
Steve made a strange sound, half laugh and half cough. “If I’m the third wheel there, it’s not because they’ve started dating.”
“Mm. I’m afraid if I have one I’ll be a weeping mess within the hour.” She cut him a crooked smile. “I’ll save that for when you’re all gone.”
Steve closed his eyes tight enough for colors to burst behind is eyelids, and then reopened them. “Yes,” he said. “I will make bacon for breakfast. In 45 minutes. Does that sound reasonable?”
“Not too awful, considering our measures to keep everything mostly steady even with half the clientele gone during the past few years. A few hiccups, but nothing too serious.”
It wasn’t transmitted with malice, or even with any pointedness, but that didn’t make Steve not feel like shit all the same. The feeling of an oncoming migraine had abated, but now it seemed to curl back on itself, pulling at his attention.
He tried to return the smile; he suspected it only came out half right. “Thanks for putting me up all this time. I’ll get out of your hair when this is done.”
“He’s fine, he’s just unconscious,” Strange diagnosed. “Probably will need a great deal of sleep to recover. We should move him to a bed and leave him be—I can monitor him remotely.”
Tony nodded, barely noticing as the room was once again emptied. The silence was heavy when it came down, though, enough that he noticed that he was cold out of the armour, and that Cap’s hand was actually
“Did you even look at the photos you were replacing?” Clint asks. “Because they’re clearly related. Clearly. They have the same chin, and eyes, and–”
When they touched ground in New York, Steve was almost afraid to disembark—he’d been watching their approach from the outside for hours, taking in a skyline that was both the same and so, so different from when he’d left it. He had memories from that last plane ride, of being shipped out to entertain the troops, his flimsy theatrical Captain America costume stowed away in a bag, and of looking out one of the small windows one last time and seeing New York like an inky blot upon the sea, iridescent with the beginning of the city’s nightlife. He’d been so certain of returning at that point, safe in his job of dancing monkey, that he’d barely given the sight a second thought.
“You’re really intent on helping out with that, aren’t you,” Tony says. “Tell you what–all of you come back to the tower. There’s at least twenty floors that haven’t gotten smashed up, which means that it’s the closest available place with beds and showers that aren’t covered in concrete dust. After that, if Fury wants us debriefed, he’ll know where to find us.”
“He asked!” Tony said, waving at Steve. “Who am I to deny Captain America? What do you even need him back for?”
Ethan screeched to a halt in front of a large, unwieldy looking building in the Village and snapped, “Go now. Stage one is now in progress. Here’s the guy you’re looking for.”
“I need a place to put myself,” Tony replied, with all the sincerity Steve’s voice could muster, which was considerable. “Every second I’m in here, I’m killing him. So I’ll put myself in the suit, and then we’ll call Helen Cho and see about alternatives, but getting out is the most important thing right now.”
“It’s a good thing you got here so early—we can chat, then I’ll go out and argue with Dr. Banner outside on the roof, and you can hand over the Time Stone just as it leaves for 2025.”
“Among other things. Stark Industries may not be making weapons anymore, but they turn a pretty good profit anyway.”
“It will have to be monitored,” Feranza said, sounding at least nominally apologetic, “But I’ll see what I can do.”
Steve sent, with the mental approximation of a shrug. He sounded faint, like he was already half an echo.
“Well, he’d be right here with me if he’d listened to me ten seconds sooner,” she replies, but then she touches her earpiece, and nods. “But as it is, his team’s got him. A bit scraped up, but he’ll live.”
He couldn’t hold Pepper properly. He couldn’t hug his kid. Couldn’t even explain to his kid what was going on, because he couldn’t think of anything worse than telling a child that their father was just an empty suit, waiting for a body.
Tony can’t ever remember hearing JARVIS sounding like this. “Sure,” he says, trying to keep his voice level. “Throw it up on the nearest projector.”
Maybe sometime soon, when things were settled, and there wasn't a distant threat on the horizon, he’d show Tony one of the emails he’d never sent, one of the more important ones.
Stephen Strange crossed his arms and leaned against the door frame of the house. Flickers of past and future lingered at the corners of his eyes. Pepper slid past him to wave goodbye to Scott Lang and his family and then exhaled heavily.
Steve had narrowed his eyes at the guy, Mostly harmless in New York could mean anything from “occasionally plays loud music on the weekends” to “collapses in front of your door in a heroine-addled stupor and jabs a knife at you when you try to get past them”. Steve had dealt with both in the past. It’s probably the latter in this case, given how goddamn nice this apartment was.
Tony took an unsteady step back from the display on the coffee table, and lowered himself onto the couch. “So you are, Captain. And has it?”
Steve had made a noncommittal noise. “I have no ties to anyone beyond the people on board this ship,” he said. “I’m not too thrilled with the possibility of refusing what limited resources are at my disposal. I’ll stay at SHIELD for as long as you’ll have me, and as long as it takes for me to get my bearings. But,” he added, “I’m not going to sign any contracts until that time either.”
SHIELD was a hive of activity, though of a different feel and noise than what Steve remembered of the wartime SSR bases in London and Paris. Steve could feel the distance that now existed between the war-zone and its operators—everyone who wasn’t traveling at a swift and controlled pace from one place to another was bent towards glass panels filled with what could only be real-time footage alongside streams of data of some kind, speaking quietly into headsets that were jarringly small and discreet.
Tony’s shoulders released slightly. It manifested in his hands going loose, the slow dip of metal plates tipping down and realigning at his sides.
“Only vaguely.” Steve stretched, extending arms and legs over the arms of the couch. It was a very comfortable couch, but he was a little too tall to be sleeping on it as much as he did. Oh well.
“I just wanted to tell you,” he said, halting, his hands clenching on nothing, “That I’m not in the ice forever. And I wanted to ask if you were happy. Because I’ve always hoped that you were.”
“I told you I gave him a project, and yes, you may,” Pepper murmured. She cocked an eyebrow at Steve. “You finished with your research?”
“Yeah, I guess,” Steve echoed. He sounded awful. His eyes were red-rimmed. He sniffed, and scrubbed a hand over his mouth. “Can I help with anything? Toast?”
Steve sighed. “That by defeating Thanos, we might have called unwanted attention to ourselves, from other universes who weren’t so lucky. She wanted us to be on our guard.”
“But?” she prompted, with a measure of resignation. Tony tended to elicit that tone from friends and colleagues he pressed into psychiatric service. He tried not to take it personally.
which meant that he was there in the living room, quietly working on his tablet, making it exceedingly difficult for Tony to concentrate on anything but the possibilities of him.
The woman nodded sharply, and cast a suspicious look in Steve’s direction again before about-facing and striding back to her station.
“Come here,” Tony said, tugging on his wrist and then his neck, and then they were kissing, Tony with urgent, hungry finesse, Steve just trying to keep up, drowning in it until he could find his footing, and even then, it was like riding an ocean tide, following its ebbs but still buffeted inexorably by its waves. He made a noise, something undignified he was sure, and then a smaller, more feminine hand slid up his shoulder and cupped the back of his neck, and he shuddered, his knees buckling.
She gestured to a squashy leather chair. “Please, have a seat. I’m going to have to do a bit of digging, we had to put this on the back burner after the Snap.”
Tony is about 90% sure that this is a good idea, particularly because JARVIS hasn’t actually protested it yet. Not directly, anyway. And the thing is, JARVIS is able to question him now, fully and unequivocally, and well, that’s a pretty damn big step, and Tony might have helped him get there initially, but JARVIS had been the one to make that last step, that last link in the web of his coding.
Bucky and Sam headed off soon after. “Got a call from Fury, he said he had something for us to look into, if we’re interested.”
“Break it up, you two,” he said, and was relieved when his voice came out steady. “I’ll only be gone a minute. Try not to kill each other before I get back.”
Steve would protest that, but the way Tony had spoken about the contemporary world had made him...doubtful. It was very clear to him, even from stilted conversations on board the submarine, just how different the world he’d woken up to was, even if the people looked just about the same.
“Good luck with that,” Clint says, shucking off his arm guard and heading off in the direction of the kitchen. “I’ll be way, way over there, with the coffeepot. Natasha’s coming with.”
Bruce went home when they shared the news with the household. “This isn’t my area of expertise, and the more of us that are here, the more it draws attention,” he said. “Call me if you need me, but.”
), Steve went weekly to therapist appointments at SHIELD that he always came back from with an undercurrent of irritation that only dissipated after watching a movie, or sketching for hours. He also went regularly to an elderly care facility which…well, Tony wasn’t about to ask, but there were a limited number of logical reasons for why Steve, a man out of time, might go there. Those days were usually the worst of all, and Tony made a point of replying promptly to any messages sent on those days, or at least sending stupid cat videos over to keep Steve occupied.
he hissed, twisting around to crane his neck up and glare at Steve, “Need to get your head out of your ass and accept that you are the eyes on the ground, and not the ones in the air. You trusted me when I was your sniper, didn’t you? Exactly,” he says himself, not giving Steve a chance to answer, “That’s what Stark’s doing, that’s his view. You gotta trust what he sees in the air. And both of you,” he prods them both in their respective chests, “Need to stop worrying so goddamn much about each other. I realise that’s difficult with the whole mutual infatuation society you’ve got goin’ on here, but enough’s e-goddamn-nough. You’re gonna get both of your asses dead trying to save each other at some point, and then where the fuck am I gonna be? Christ.”
Steve didn’t hear about it until after the action was over (which in itself was becoming a pattern Steve was getting used to, but didn’t like). By the time he’d learned what had happened, SHIELD was in cleanup mode, and that meant bringing Tony in for debriefing.
“Gain mastery of himself,” Steve repeated. “What does that entail?” He scrounges for faint memories. “Self-actualization?”
"Can never leave well enough alone, huh?" Tony said. He sounded odd, beyond the usual synthesized timbre.
Steve watched her. She was such a strange woman to him, in so many ways—she looked both on the verge of tears and implacable, like sun-warmed stone.
Steve parried with the tire iron. And then just kept going. God, it was so easy to fall back into it.
“If it’s so shoddy, then we’ll be out in a flash,” Bucky reasoned. He looked again at Tony’s profile, just barely visible in the darkness. “You shouldn’t have come out,” he observed. “You shoulda said something if you weren’t feeling fit.”
He sticks the card into the breast pocket of Steve’s tweed jacket, and saunters back towards the door. “Ten minutes now, Professor,” he says over his shoulder. “I guess you’d better head out.”
“I haven’t gone into prosthetics yet, but it could be an interesting diversion.” Tony’s eyebrow twitched up; yet another challenge. “Who knows? Maybe, just for you, I’ll make something more than just an arm. Something with…
“Or,” the Ancient One replied, “He transfers into a willing host. One with whom a channel can be, or already has been forged.”
“I miss you,” he blurted, because nothing was shooting at him this time, and he was tired of running away. “All the goddamn time.”
Bucky marches over and bodily shoves himself between them, and—wow, there is not a lot of space here, actually. Apparently Steve and Tony are both not only marathon arguers, but also
“So the essential properties of the ventilation system are always to let in air only—I need circulation, however I also do not need to be poisoned in a germ warfare situation, or drowned. Sound difficult?”
“I know that tone,” Tony said, with growing curiosity. “Mrs. Potts, did you make him into a project?”
He’d stayed still and awake for long minutes, until he heard Nat move downstairs, and had carefully extracted himself to join her. Tony had just snuffled and turned onto his side, rolling into the space Steve had left behind.
The quickly jotted idea of tony and bucky before it exploded out of control and became Armed and Dangerous
At first, Steve just thought he’d gotten sweat in his eyes. He blinked and swiped at them, and then looked again, but then it became undeniable, the oil-slick iridescence in the air, just slightly taller than the door frame, rippling faintly.
“You know,” he said, after a second in which they both slurped chai without any grace, because it was still too hot to drink, “I really expected you to go off with Sam and Barnes.”
From behind him, he heard the distant shouting of Fury. “Rogers! Rogers, what the fuck do you think you’re doing?”
“Femto-particular genetic tags,” she said, with a blank sort of disbelief. “I know you were semi-joking with your original hypothesis, but you might have been more right than you intended. The Stones appear to have preserved and then dispersed you at a subatomic level. We’ve skipped pico-technology and gone right to femto-technology. It makes sense, in a way—if the Stones are capable of reshaping the universe in one way or another, they’d have to be able to do it on the smallest possible scales to achieve the complete, reality-changing results.”
“You know,” Steve says hesitantly, “People would probably like those better if you used a wider colour palette.”
Tony drops his helmet on the coffee table without another word. He doesn’t even notice that he’s been followed until the elevator doors slide shut.
“Eventually,” she replied. “Rocky start—do you know that story?—but eventually, yes. I liked her a lot.”
“I’ll try,” Steve replied. The sounds of chaos from uptown were waning, which meant that Tony’s trip through the portal was over. He took a deep breath, and headed out the door.
“Obviously. Keep up with me here, Cap, I don’t intend to monologue about things I already know. I gotta figure out this whole solidification thing.”
Steve pushed a sliver of his thoughts back towards him in answer, and smirked when the flush extended to Tony's ears.
“Ice. And the super soldier serum,” Fury answered. “Howard Stark had a search party sent out annually. This year, we got lucky.”
“Thanks.” He took a sip. He didn’t love beer, but he appreciated the gesture. “What’re your plans, now?”
“Use my override if you need to,” Steve says, but they both know that Bucky doesn’t need to; Tony built an override into his bionic arm months ago, and fuck everyone else, Bucky’s pretty sure that’s the most romantic thing he’s ever had happen to him.
She touched his cheek, his jawline. Her fingers were callused, the nails blunt. She smelled like the same perfume she’d worn during the war, something warm and floral.
“Now? I’m on vacation. Gonna help Pepper with some paperwork, and probably just hang out for a while, keep her and the kid company. This house is gorgeous, but it’s far from civilization. Doesn’t seem right to make it lonelier than it already is.” Rhodes cut a glance at him. “You could stick around for a while too, you know. House is big enough, and eventually Bruce is gonna call you back.”
as he was before. Not mass-wise, precisely, given how tiny femto-particles are, but what’s held there is just...it’s a lot more. We’re not going to know what it means until, I don’t know, something happens.”
“Bots are down for the count,” Clint reports over the comm, “Wanna tell me why you didn’t just do that in the first place, Stark?”
My god, Steve thought, bracing himself against howling light and blinding wind, did Thanos even know it could be like this?
“—and then the frequency changes so the waves go up, down, up, down but then they go updownupdownupdownupdown—morning, Steve!”
“I am a little tired,” Steve admitted. It was kind of embarrassing, considering he’d just been asleep less than an hour before. “Can I nap while you run your tests?”
Tony’s eyes flash, but then the spark is gone again. “The day I have a leg to stand on in a holier-than-thou competition with you, Cap, is the day I should probably retire.”
In the evening, after scouring Pepper’s notes and scrawling out as much material as he could muster, he went out to the garage again. Opened up the case and sat in front of it again.
“The living quarters and bottom twenty floors are operational, and I think he wanted to be away from Malibu, anyway, after—well, you were there,” Steve replied. “It’s a pretty good set-up already, what with the gym and the apartment, and there’s a great coffee shop on the ground floor.”
The look of him lingered with Steve for a long while after that. Hadn’t ever faded, he was now realizing.
“I don’t have to, though,” Sam says, putting his hands up. “I’ve said my two cents, and frankly, listening to you two for half an hour is exhausting. I’m gonna go call my mom on the secure line and let her know we’re all right.”
“I guess. We barely talked, though, I don’t know what…oh. Huh.” she drifted off, lost in thought. Steve let her be.
“I miss you, too.” Her hand found the back of his neck and scratched at the small hairs there. It was the best thing he’d felt in months, years. “But I have work to do here. Good work, challenging work. Most men are idiots, but some of them have wised up enough to know that they ought to listen to me.”
Morgan nodded, blithe and so goddamn resilient. Pepper collected her plate and utensils and took them to the sink for her own sake more than the sake of cleanliness, where over the water running she could hear Jim say, “It’s okay to miss him, Cap.”
Natasha threw punches, gave solid (if noncommittal) advice, and answered questions about memes and k-pop.
“Tony?” Her neck was broken. There were soft places at the back of her skull that shouldn’t be soft. Nausea pulled at the back of his throat. “Please?”
“Can hardly stop you, can I?” The chest plate loosens with a hiss, but before Tony can fling it out the elevator doors as they open, Steve has his hands on it, easing it off and then tucking it under his arm.
Tony considered it. Thought about the now rather-crowded upstairs bedrooms, and Steve still asleep after 36 hours. It would be more convenient for him to just go to her, but having the house full, not being alone and keeping them all close seemed right at the moment. “I think we’d prefer if you came here. Strange, would you be able to help with transport?”
“All the other refugees were ignoring her!” Steve bursts out. “Him. It. I’m…not actually sure. But they kept shoving it to one side, and then grabbing at the mechanical parts of it, like they were trying to take them off, and I’m pretty sure they’re not supposed to come off, they’re fused to the skin, and it kept wandering off to look at the interfaces on the helicarrier and flinching when the others came near, and I just–”
“I didn’t plan anything for dinner, I figured everyone would be nibbling all day, is that all right?” Pepper asked, sidling up. She’d ditched her black high heels and remained in stocking feet, but her shoulders were straight and her eyes were clear.
“Definitely something,” she agreed. She felt a little like she was going to come out of her skin. She hadn’t had that sort of charged human contact since Tony had died, and she hadn’t really appreciated how much she’d missed it. She’d gone without for long periods often enough in the past; but then Tony had happened, and he was a naturally intimate person when he chose to be. He’d chosen her wholeheartedly, in the end, and she’d gotten so used to it, used to him and his habits of closeness.
“I’m pretty sure I wouldn’t be able to make it through a movie without jumping both of you,” Tony interrupts, focussing abruptly. He looks at Steve, smiles crookedly, and then transforms the smile into an all-out smirk that Bucky automatically finds himself matching.
The guy looks curiously at him for a moment, and then wipes his hands on his jeans before sticking one of them out. “Tony Stark. You must be Steve Rogers.”
“Yeah, fine, lead the way,” he says anyway, and can’t help but be pleased by Steve’s delighted grin, and the way Tony’s grip goes hot and tight, pulling him along.
Steve stared back up through the skylight for a moment. It was a gorgeous day, looked like. “I’m gonna give him the shield.”
“Someone will have to do that, I guess,” Steve says uneasily, “But maybe not until they’ve started getting cleanup underway.”
“Dunno,” Bucky said after a pause, “I’m kinda wishing I hadn’t missed the whole ‘Merchant of Death’ stage of your life, it sounded like a hell of a ride.”
Tony presses Steve’s proffered glove down on the gash, knowing full well his face beneath the helmet was a mask of worry and really not caring. That is, until Steve opens his eyes just enough to look at him, and says, “Tony…”
Steve looked around, and didn’t seem disappointed. “I’ve done a lot more with a lot less,” he said. “What do I owe you? I’ve heard I’ve got back pay, hazard pay.”
“We’ll give you clearance and an alias,” Fury supplied. “You won’t have to answer any awkward questions, I can guarantee that. And while I’d ask that you not leave the building, at least not yet, you’re free to go wherever your clearance level will allow you.”
“Yeah, so this is the first finished floor. I’ve got a landing pad all set up, takes care of the Iron Man gear. Also: wet bar.
He landed in Washington Square Park, well away from the fighting, though there were already impact scars over the monument, and twenty blocks up, the sound of Chitauri and mayhem. He ignored it and started walking. The Ancient One wasn’t far now, and he had no doubt that she was expecting him.
“Oh.” The guy puts a hand through his hair and sends it into even more appealing spikes. Steve is developing a problem really fast. “Well, look, here’s the thing, it’s going to be worth it, once I get to the piping. Because you’ve noticed the water pressure’s not the best, right? I just need to tweak some things, because the city’s got their priorities all fucked up, so we’re at the bottom of the list, and I figure I can do it faster and cheaper than them anyway, so. Uh. Wait.” He drifts off. “What time is it?”
“Uh, I’mma go with no,” Clint says, “Considering you just admitted to harboring a crush on our resident asshole–”
to things was always Natasha’s undoing, Steve knew well. Tony of course had no idea, and he again missed how she rolled her eyes before hiding a fond smile and then taking Clint by the ear to steer him out of the conference room. Bruce and Thor followed in varying shades of bemusement.
Darcy pokes her shoulder. “Drink your coffee, have a shower, get some actual sleep in a bed, not under your desk. Erik’s got some stuff he wants to show you when you’ve got a second, but it can definitely wait until tomorrow. If you’re really good, I’ll talk him into putting some pants on too.”
Fury sighed. “Get in here, Coulson. You too, Agent Hill—and shut the damn door behind you. Have you told Barton, Romanov?”
The alarm around the property was a silent system, but Steve was willing to bet it hadn’t gone off. He jogged away from the driveway and towards the garage, which was partially hidden from the front door, hoping to find some of Tony’s old gear, or something he could cobble together into a weapon.
Tony waves dismissively. “Drama queen. JARVIS, I programmed you to be the epitome of understatement, have you misplaced your British sensibility? Because I can recalibrate it–”
He watched Dr. Feranza quickly mask a frustrated expression, and waited for the hour to wind up. He was looking forward to the new reading material Tony had uploaded, which was apparently vetted and compiled by someone named ‘Pepperpot’.
They sat in silence for a while. A few car engines started up down the driveway: mourners headed home.
He mostly just didn’t want to be alone in a room again. It was nice down here, with Tony working, and Pepper and the rest circulating around. “Yeah, no problem.”
“Yeah,” he said. “I’ve got time.” He covered her hand with his. “You got a radio in here? I think I owe you a dance. Then I’ll let you be.”
“Not alive, but able to respond to thought, and able to house the Stones, if only temporarily. And it’s mine—the Ancient One said there needed to be a connection already forged. I’d say it’s as close to a willing host as I’m going to get at short notice. A risk I’m willing to take.” He slapped it onto the center of his chest, and winced as it anchored. “It’s Steve, Pep.”
Bucky hadn’t taken very long to decide that he wanted to go back into cryogenesis until Shuri could devise a cure for his triggers. Steve still wondered if he hadn’t hastened him to that decision, that Steve hadn’t been one more thing Bucky had needed to escape from, if only temporarily.
“Oh, that’s lovely,” Pepper breathed, so close he nearly startled. “Steve, would you—do you want to come upstairs with us? It’ll be a tight fit, but I think we can manage it.”
“O…kay,” Steve said, fiddling with the SHIELD phone he’d been issued. “And I only get a hundred and forty letters to say anything?”
“Yeah, I’ll be fine.” He put his arms around her. She hugged him back fiercely, her cheek sharp against his chest. There were threads of gray in her hair. It suited her.
“It’s good to see you,” Steve said, and was glad his voice didn’t waver over it. It had stung, he could admit now, that Tony had been able to see her one more time, and he hadn’t. She looked as gorgeous as always, and a lot lighter, too—the Soul Stone, it seemed, was doing well by her. He didn’t know how to feel about that.
“Because I didn’t want to owe everyone in the Village a new radio and wifi router,” Tony replies, “And someone get me a fucking medic, STAT, Captain America is down.”
It was a lot harder to be on the outside of a process like this than the subject, he was realizing. Tony had the same hopeful conviction Steve remembered having before stepping into Howard’s Vita-Ray machine.
“Only,” Bucky replies, “When they’re evidence that you’ve won. Not when they make me scared for you.”
“Naps are for the weak! Ooh, reservations are at Derringer, aren’t they? Steve, have you been to the Derringer? Their swordfish is to die for, you should come.”
“Definitely noticing,” Tony says, doing a quick loop and tilt, nearly dislodging ornamental moulding on the side of a townhouse. “They’ve got a plan, but I haven’t a clue what it is. JARVIS, any ideas?”
Christ, Steve was definitely red now. “Well—I—not that I don’t, that is, but I just…you have the suit, and a phone that does all the things you want it to, and I just wanted to see what that was like when it was a place that you lived in. And I haven’t actually been out in the city much, besides going for runs, so I thought…?”
“I repeat my previous assessment,” Tony interrupts, but his cheeks have gone slightly pink. “You’re both adorable. Stop it before I catch something.”
Steve went over, instinctively shying away from the empty space where the herald had been. “Do we need to worry about anyone else?” he asked Natasha. “People coming for Tony?”
"Destroy it,” Tony answers. He wants to look away, but Steve has him pinned, his stare heavy with his expectation, unreadable and unmovable all at once. Fuck it, Tony can’t look away, but he doesn’t
The chug subsided, evening out. The arcs of light dulled and resolved into a constant, halogen glow.
He shifted, and compacted sand creaked beneath him. A shaky exhale puffed more of it out from beneath his cheek. He knew this smell, this side of the sea and the washed up boardwalk and the faintest, far-off echoes of carnival bells.
That gets a few laughs from around the table, but Steve finally focusses and looks at Tony, and what he sees isn’t what he expected. Tony looks…wistful. Like he maybe wouldn’t have minded going out that way.
He found Bruce in the kitchen, wiping down the counters while a kettle heated on the stove. “Steve,” he said, looking over his shoulder at him. “You, uh. Took off.”
Steve and Tony looked at each other. Hesitantly, Steve raised the gauntlet in a small wave. Tony stared at it. “You used that? It’s broken.”
“I think Tony should wear Cap’s outfit,” Bruce says mildly. And then he adds, “Oh wait. He already has.”
“Because.” Tony stopped. Shrugged. “I was the first one to talk to you here, in this time. Maybe I’ve got a guilt complex.”
No, it’s been okay. Boring, though. Agent Romanov is teaching me pop culture, but that’s pretty much the only highlight of my day. I think they’re still trying to figure out whether I’m going to be a liability, going forward.
“He was fearless, even then,” Bucky says, smiling, “I barely even had to suggest it, and he was right there with me.”
He nearly jumped when he felt Tony cover the clasp. The metal almost gave, was sun-warm and so fine in texture it could almost be mistaken for skin. “Tony?” he whispered. “What…?”
Stark Tower loomed overhead, and Tony tilted up to make a wild curl up its side before rolling back down onto the landing pad.
“Yeah. I think he’s been making a lot of decisions out of desperation for a long time. I’m not sure he knows how to do anything different.”
Steve goes, and then wanders back to bed in a haze. He’s living in possibly the weirdest, best apartment in Brooklyn, and his landlord is Tony Stark, and Tony Stark, elusive billionaire and tech whiz, is apparently sinfully attractive.
“She’s not speaking to me.” Tony’s lack of affect was more telling than any mechanical gesture could have been. “She’s mad I didn’t tell her sooner.”
Pepper held out a hand, a hint of challenge in the set of her gaze. Steve was a sucker for that kind of look from a lady. He sighed, and gingerly stepped forward. “I don’t know what I’m doing,” he confessed. “At all.”
“He’s got a look about him.” Deaf or not, Clint could practically hear Bruce’s worried, wrinkled nose.
“Fury would certainly object,” Steve agrees, but his inflection doesn’t change at all. Not even when he says, “I’d stand with you over him.”
“I knew the owner lived in the building, I just. Uh. Well, I guess you can do what you like. Obviously.”
Pepper paused. “What definition of ‘fine’ are you using right now?” she said, sounding a little more concerned.
inside him, of Pepper and Rhodey and desert dust and motor oil and Howard and Maria and math, math, math—
“I don’t like where this conversation is going!” Clint suddenly shouts from the kitchen, startling all three of them. Tony steadies himself with a hand on Bucky’s hip, which is sort of distracting. “For the sake of my virgin ears, please take it elsewhere!”
Also, whoever sold Doctor Doom the blue prints to high radiation plasma guns needs to be shot in the face, superhero principles be damned.
Thank god Tony was meticulous when it came to his house, even if his engineering practices were chaotic. Steve slipped through a well-oiled side door to the garage and immediately spotted both a tire iron and a spare hubcap that looked very expensive, and therefore hopefully would be very sturdy. He grabbed both and then paused.
“Nothing,” Tony answered. He came up to stand at the railing, his shoulder just brushing Steve’s. “It’s more what you can do for yourself.”
Particularly when, the very next day, Hill forwarded him several tabloid headlines inquiring about the ‘new blonde in reformed warmonger Tony Stark’s life’.
Steve stretched his neck and felt out where a bruise was fading on his jaw—Natasha had gotten him with a solid right hook. “Was that the expo incident?”
He’d been gunning it back from Iraq in the War Machine as fast as the damn thing would go–Tony would say that
“Tony,” he said, “I know you already knew this, but. Pepper is just...she’s amazing. You got lucky, but I think...I think maybe she got lucky too, finding someone who would help her build things. Isn’t that something?”
“I know what I’d do, usually,” Tony says. He drinks, sets down the glass. “If it were just me. If they weren’t watching us.”
Bruce shrugged. “You don’t have to be here if you don’t want to be. I can just call you when we’re ready.”
They both turned to look at Jim, who was hovering in the doorway. “Hey, honeybear. Good to see you.”
“You and I have very different ideas of what constitutes ‘had to’,” Bucky commented. “For Stark? Really?”
her, the energy she trailed, like tight-coiled atmosphere before a lightning strike. It took some effort not to flinch away.
“Tony didn’t move on. He just moved forward. He didn’t really change, not at his core; he just discovered new facets of what he could and should do. You can do the same. You don’t have to stop, you don’t have to shut anything off. You just need to find what you’ve got that can be put to new purpose.” She squeezed his hands. “You don’t have to
“Sure. Sit there and look pretty. Ask questions if you’re confused, I always enjoy answering things, it helps me troubleshoot.”
“It’s his own fault, really,” Tony said, a little plaintively. “Total inability to just be the asshole I thought he was and talk the talk without walking the walk. Had to go and be all
Steve tried to imagine taking the lead with them, slotting into place with them and Wanda and maybe a few others, and recoiled automatically—the last time a similar configuration had existed, it was in Leipzig.
the radar, Cap. You did not help things by going off-course and showing up at Stark Tower. People notice that shit, and we’ve since spent a significant amount of man power getting that erased from public record. I'm not trying to be difficult, Captain, I'm just telling you how it is.”
“Try not to break anything,” Tony murmured. “And give me a call, anytime, anywhere. You want to come here, there’s always room.”
“I’m as sure as I can be,” he said to Tony, still looking up at the skyline as the gangway was lowered. “I’m aware of at least some of the risks. And I can take care of myself, worst comes to worst.”
“What are you doing here, Romanov? Out, this is above your pay grade.” Fury said sharply, though something about his manner suggested to Steve that he wasn’t actually surprised.
Tony was buried to his ears in his own DNA sequence when he heard shuffling and low voices upstairs. He decided to ignore it for as long as he could.
