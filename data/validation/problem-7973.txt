“Hello, Director. I hear you’re looking for me.”
"That's a pretty broad question, Cap. I know about the increased strength and speed, plus the accelerated healing. Did the serum give you the blue eyes capable of manipulating people, or were those available on the original model?"
“Tony Stark, head of R&D, Stark Industries,” Steve read. “Tony
"Shit. Okay, we have to assume they were taken. Excuse me, JARVIS? Miss Hansen told Pepper that her boss was working for the Mandarin. Do you know who her boss is?"
“Most liars get caught because they’re inconsistent. If we’re going to send you undercover as Hydra, you’ve got to commit. Future you only had to say one line. You have to have a whole backstory, ideology, identity, plan, everything. We’ve got broad strokes, but if you don’t want to have to improvise, we’ll need the details. For the most part, we’ll want you to stick as close to the truth as possible. Your very handy eidetic memory will allow you to keep track of everything, but it’s easier to convince people you’re telling the truth if you actually are telling the truth. The key is strategically leaving out the right things. You don’t have to necessarily tell people the answer – let them do the math on their own and come to the conclusion you want them to.”
“Yeah, no I get that. I mean I like my balls attached, but if that does it for you, whatever. But doesn’t it bother you?”
Tony seemed to snap back to himself a little bit. "At this point, not much. I have JARVIS analyzing the data to see if we can get a pattern of the Mandarin's attacks. Rhodey is working on it for the government. Aside from the bombing with… with Happy, the media has only reported on three. There have actually been six more that weren’t made public.”
“Agreed,” Steve said. “Natasha and Clint, I’d like you to work with Sharon, Fury, and Hill to do assessments of all the small teams. I don’t want to have situations where the SHIELD agents are overwhelmed by Hydra.”
“Dearest Jane! How are you?”
“Your facade is secure, sir. What I’m about to share with you isn’t widely known. At least not among anyone alive. I certainly haven’t mentioned it to Fury. It’s not just my muscles and healing that are enhanced. My senses are too. I can hear people whispering two or three rooms away, depending on background noise. Some of your agents are chatty when they’re alone.”
Tony continued to fiddle with his projects, then sighed and scrapped everything he’d done in the last hour. He wasn’t sure when it had happened, but he’d gotten used to Steve sitting in his workshop and sketching. He’d spent three days in his workshop, stewing in his own anger and misery. His parents had died more than 20 years ago. He’d come to terms with it. He had enough reason to hate his father without blaming him for the car accident. Maybe more of this than he wanted to admit was about Steve choosing Bucky over him. Damn Clint for being right.
"Oh that's easy. J, can you compile a list for Cap?"
“You’re not going to threaten me as her friend? No shovel talk?”
“Would you like us to call your groom for you?” Bucky asked. “Or someone else?”
Steve felt all his tension uncoil. Tony had a way of doing that for him.
“You didn’t want to backtrack on how you motivated us to be a team. Well, guess what. You got what you wanted. We’re a team now. So here’s how it’s going to go. Pierce thinks I’m Hydra. Natasha is going to stay here for a couple of weeks before she comes back to New York. She’ll fill you in on all the details of what we know and how we learned it, and she has the means to communicate with us privately. You’re going to work with her to identify agents you’re sure of.”
"Sure do. Fury gave him his own quinjet. I can track it and we can intercept their next landing."
"Oh ho ho! He didn't blush when he told me before. He's blushing because you're a woman, which means it's about a woman! Now we have to get him drunk and get it out of him. What d'ya say, Romanoff, wanna help me corrupt a national treasure?"

Tony avoided Steve like the plague. It’s been a week but it feels like it’s been forever. The app Tony made was working like a dream but he did have a few run ins with Steve. They lived close by to one another and studied in the same school, so chances are they will meet up once in a while.
He saw Tony jolt a bit not expecting anyone else to be up. He slowly turned giving Steve a nervous grin. “Hey Cap! I was just uhm, redecorating for tomorrow, yeah that’s it!” Tony said nervously. Steve just raised an eyebrow at him.
Tony finds comfort with Bruce.
Something Entirely New 3
It's been a while. I was thinking how to go about this so here's a part of it. I will post another in a few days.
He shortened the list more, opting to skip places with alcohol, he finally decided on a place; a small café’ within the city limits.
He was at his wits end and Tony’s birthday was in a week. He needed to think, so he got his sketch pad and went up to the roof only to se he wasn’t the first to get up there. He saw Scarlet Witch had perched on one of the chair set up their. She saw him and waved at him. Steve managed a small smile and made his way to her. He hasn’t seen her all day, maybe she just wanted to get some alone time.
Bam, Bam, Bam, was the only sound coming from the gym as Steve Rogers aka Captain America busied himself with the flour sacks they called punching bags. He was pissed off, each blow increasing in force as he remembered his current situation. One final punch launched the bag across the room and it crashed on the wall the fell to the floor beneath it. A growing pile could be seen as cap went to get another bag.
“Please rest up, I’ll stand watch until the sun comes up” Steve said as he returned to the dying fire by the cavern entrance gathering up more materials along the way.
Tony opened his newly created app and a map of the area popped on his phone screen. He typed in Steve’s number and waited. A glowing red dot showed him where Steve was; he was still at home. Tony rushed to his car picking up the lunch Jarvis made him and got into his car. He chose a simple one today as to be inconspicuous. Suddenly the dot was moving and Tony paused getting in his car. The dot was coming to the direction of his house and it meant Steve was coming. He went back inside hiding in the first floor bathroom.
Thor was about to speak but suddenly a beeping sound came from his pocket.
It’s a custom to give a gift on someone’s birthday but when that someone was one of the richest men in the world who could have anything they want at any given moment, then it becomes a bit of a hassle to give them one isn’t it. This was the problem of Captain America Aka, Steve Rogers.
“I don’t know honestly, I guess we’d become close that we’ve become, uhm friends and I, well it’s just, uhm” Steve couldn’t think straight. Why did he want to give Tony a gift when he could literally have anything in the world?
“When the sun comes up, let’s explore this place a bit”.
“It was a dream Steve, he’s here. He’s okay, he will be okay” Nat said laying a hand on his shoulder. Steve wanted to believe her but if Tony isn’t awake, he couldn’t.
At last he made it to the student council’s room. He frequented it enough to not bother knocking so he just barged right in, unprepared f the sight he saw before him.
They walked away and Tony saw the smile Steve had when he was talking to Peggy and it kinda hurt him in some way. “Hey Steve! Catch!” Tony shouted throwing something in the air. Steve turned just in time and caught what Tony threw; the Snickers bar. Steve smiled at him and gave him a mock salute. “You need it more than me.” Tony waved him off again.
“Don’t you have Knight Duties?” Steve said hoping his irritation didn’t slip through. “Would you believe Clint relieved me of them for the rest of the day?”
“There a makeshift door, you can thaw it out when the sun goes up.” Tony said as he looked at Steve who had an expression of awe strewn across his face. That made Tony chuckle.
“Steve’s room, pull up his room cam” Clint said determined.
Tony looked around as he sat down on the sofa. It wasn’t small but it wasn’t big as well. It was very homey not like his own which was so much larger but felt more empty. Thinking of his home he took out his phone ad called Jarvis. Tony told him he’d be staying with a friend and that he’d come home early to get a change of clothes. Jarvis told him that Steve dropped by looking for him. Tony changed the subject. By the time Tony ended the call Thor stepped out.

“I felt like I was hit with a bullet train going 300 miles an hour.” Tony said deflating. “I-“
Tony wanted to model for Steve and also to see the suit on paper drawn by non other than Steve Rogers.
That hit him in the chest. “I’m the worst right? My best friend finally has a girlfriend but he’s losing his best friend right? Some friend I am” Tony said dejected. Thor placed a comforting hand on his shoulder. “I understand Tony, not to a great degree but I understand but It would be detrimental if you keep avoiding this issue.” Thor said with small frown. “Give yourself some space but please talk to him”
Tony can be direct but this was a different kind of direct he didn’t see before. The last person Steve thought to share emotions just did.
I tried to fill in the blanks to what happened in the cave overnight.
“I guess I do” Steve said as he laid his head on Tony’s.” I do to, that’s why I drifted away. I, I didn’t want you to get the wrong Idea and I was falling hard and-“Steve cut his rambling of with a finger to his lips.
“You sound like a mom you know” Tony teased opening the container. There were slices of strawberries and kiwis and a bundle of green and purple grapes. He smiled at Steves choice popping a few grapes in his mouth. He offered Steve some and Steve reached for the kiwis.
“I heard he was woke up” Pepper said with a smile but it faltered a bit. “You look troubled Steve, did anything happen?” She asked full of concern. Steve looked at her sadly. He explained what had happened and Pepper placed a gentle hand on his arm, offering what comfort she could give.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah, wait let me do an equation first haha” Tony said grinning. Thor returned it.
“Are you two quarreling sir?” Jarvis asked as he got close. “Nah just working on something” He lied.
Steve had changed from his uniform to his casual clothes and as soon as the doctors said he was okay. He almost bulldozed anyone in his path. For two weeks he stayed by Tony’s side. Leaving only for food and the occasional bathroom break and a mission or two where Fury had all but berated him to go on. He went back after hoping Tony was awake but he wasn’t.
Not much but it's a start. look out for more chapters and characters along the way.
Steve and Tony go way back. Tony was the new kid during elementary school and Steve was the scrawny kid every other boy picked on but when Tony came, they had a new target. Steve didn’t think it was right and he stepped up to those bullies. Needless to say they were overpowered but one good thing came out of it; their everlasting friendship. Since then they were inseparable. Tony came from a wealthy family and Steve was just above poor but Tony convinced his parents to give Steve’s parents good paying jobs and Steve’s life became more comfortable.
“Yeah, yeah, Shouldn’t you be in class instead of looking for me and feeding me?” Tony said with a raised eyebrow.
Steve walked back to the fire but sat opposite to Tony. "Usually when me and the other rubies fuse, we just accumulate strength but with you, I felt newer abilities, speed and even insight." Steve said blushing. "I also felt different, good different but at the same time it felt weird".
Tony has a definite appreciation for all things related to engineering and caffeine. At times working late nights on projects while only drinking caffeine wherein Steve would haul him out of his workshop to eat something solid. He often speaks in rambles at time jumping from topic to topic in a conversation.
Tony noticed, he sighed as he leaned on the punching bag, “Tell me something cap, has the arrival of Knight Steve done something to you?” Steve was quiet, it was a yes. Tony continued, “When Steven came here I thought you two were alike, (Steve’s jaw clenched) You two came from different worlds and times so I thought you two would be companions in that sense but you’ve done nothing but avoid him. Whenever you would speak, it was only a select choice of words before finding a reason to leave. The only thing I wonder is why?” Tony asked looking at Steve intensely.
They descended further down until they could see the ground. Steve was filled with fear as they descended. Hi grabbed onto Tony as if to shield him from the impact but as they fell a few feet closer, Tony’s gem glowed and their descent had slowed down enough so they could float to the ground.
Tony stayed at the café’ for the rest of the day, he sent another message to Jarvis saying where he is and that he’s with a friend and not to worry. For the rest of the day he just sat there, writing future design plans and drawing up schematics and whatever thought that popped up in his mind even Steve.
“Steve! These are amazing!” Tony said in complete astonishment as he flipped through the pages. Steve blushed but smiled at the compliment. “I had to do them on our off days the past week, do you like it?” he asked nervously.
“I-I apologize! Ar-Are You-“Steve Stuttered as he apologized, reaching out to see if he had hurt his Sapphire when he bumped into him.
They lapsed in comfortable silence until Thor asked “You’re avoiding Steve aren’t you?” Thor asked and Tony stopped mid bite into an éclair. Tony sighed in defeat “Yeah just for a little while” Tony said biting off a piece of the éclair. “He seems troubled today. I saw him before and he had this look, one of sadness and disturbance”.
Tony just smiled back at him. “I’d like that”
(See the end of the chapter for
They were inseparable until one night on the eve of a solstice; a magical portal opened and out came a chunk of flying metal. Steve and a few of his team mates arrived moments after the entity exited the portal after being warned by Dr. Strange. Everyone was cautious as they came on the scene they didn’t know what to expect until the pile of metal started to move.
“Thanks J, but I’m not really in the mood to eat right now, maybe before leaving? Oh yeah and if Steve comes by tell him I’m not here. Thanks!” Tony said making his way down the hall.
Steve called out as Tony rounded the corner, “What were you doing up there?” Steve raised his voice as he asked. Tony backtracked and peeked his head round the corner. “I was looking for you, bye Cap” Tony shouted the last part as he headed to his workshop. His pace a little bit faster. Steve’s brain short circuited again.
He loved Steve? Tony had feelings for Steve but he didn’t think of saying that he loved Steve. Steve was his best friend; he was always supportive, kind and caring to everyone but especially for Tony. He looked out for him, took care of him, listened to him and made him smile when he felt like the world was ending. He smiled at that thought.
It was Tony’s little nook, there was a small garden a ways from the school grounds. No one would even know where it was if not for the foliage that surrounds the entrance.
“I’d like that” With that Steve closed the gap and he was the one kissing Tony, Tony kissed back and it felt amazing. They separated a few moments after but Tony gave him a few parting kisses before they really separated. Steve caressed Tony’s cheek and Tony leaned into it. Steve smiled at him and hugged him tight.
“Steve?” Tony quietly whispered his name.
They sat down and immediately Thor dug in. Tony just chuckled at that, it reminded him of Steve. Steve, he was thinking of Steve again. Steve was always a heavy eater but it didn’t show. He was scrawny growing up but now he was quarterback and a complete jock. He was suddenly roused from his thoughts when he heard his name being called. Tony shook his head and focused. Thor was looking at him in concern.
“I don’t know” Steve replied as he looked down on to the tiled floor.
He was small in his physical form. He had deep brown hair and dark chocolate eyes. He had markings on his face that with humans could resemble facial hair above his lip and along the sides of his face. He was dressed in a garb most noblemen wore.
He smiled, “I know, I think I understand but we can talk about it any other time but now, I just want to enjoy this moment with you. Taking Tony’s hand in his he entwined their fingers, and kissed the back of Tony’s hand.
Tony breathe a sigh of relief and gently opened the door, he saw Bruce looking at him with concern. Suddenly his knees got weak and he toppled to the floor but he didn’t make contact. Bruce had hurried to his side and supported him back against the wall.
(See the end of the chapter for
Thor smiled at that and they went up to the counter. Thor suggested a few items and Tony was eager to try them. The place had a decent selection of food ranging from snacks to true dinner items. They settled on a mix of both. Tray in hand they settled for a booth on the corner for privacy and for Tony a vantage point.
He kept asking the others and even Hill and Fury. Well Fury just shrugged him off when he asked and Hill just laughed when he asked.
Steve turned back to Peggy and they started walking again then he saw Peggy hook her arm around Steve’s and he was hit hard with a wave of emotions most of which was jealousy. He looked away thinking what else he could do to not make him feel so crappy until he’d see Steve again.
How things started.
“Thanks” Tony said drinking from the warm mug. Steve smiled and drank from his own. They made small talk that was soon directed to their individual nightmares. Steve’s was still dreaming about the ice and the life he left behind. Tony’s was infinite darkness and drifting off into deep space for all eternity.
He made a quick stop at his locker to get back the containers Steve left with him. There were still a few muffins and sandwiches left. He couldn’t swallow past the guilt but maybe, he and Steve could share what’s left like they used to.
It's been a while, I've started thinking of better ways to write. I'm trying to add clothing descriptions and better descriptions in general. Please Enjoy.
Tony was busy writing down a new program he was going to make when he felt someone tap him on the shoulder. He turned around to see a grinning Thor.
Steve Shouted as he charged.
“You have feelings for Steve other than the platonic best friend relationship right?” Bruce said calmly.
It was fun for Steve; it was just him and Tony. If anyone had come to see them, they were nice enough to leave them alone; even Clint didn’t make an appearance. They finished at about 3 in the morning and they plopped down on the couch in apparent exhaustion. They would’ve finished earlier if Tony hadn’t initiated a few games of throw things wherever and Steve had to make sure things were perfect.
Tony studied it, trying to figure out what Steve got him. “You’ve got skill Cap, I like the way you wrapped it, it could make a good addition to the décor” Tony said smiling at him.
“I, I saw Steve making out with Peggy” Tony started. He told Thor everything that happened and what he was feeling that moment and little by little, Tony felt better. Thor was quiet but affirmed he was listening. He asked an occasional question but he didn’t pry, Tony was thankful for that.
They took the foreigner with them to S.H.I.E.L.D HQ and that’s when they learned of the Knights origins.
The sun soon set as the rain continued to pour. Tony and Steve were relatively dry by then Steve more so.
It happened, it finally happened, Tony’s with Steve and Steve’s with him. He couldn’t believe it. After their public display, everyone dispersed. Their closest friends giving then their regards, Natasha walking away with a triumphant smile, Peggy and Sharon behind her giggling with ideas on the direction Tony and Steve’s relationship will go, Clint and Bruce behind the three girls discussing their future group dynamic now Tony and Steve is an item.
Tony did go to some of his classes. Choosing to go through a few hours of mundane school life rather than drone in complete boredom. He could’ve skipped school and come back later that day but Steve would talk his ear off about irresponsibility and the importance of school and all that, having heard more than a few times kinda traumatized him from ever disappointing Steve again so he stayed.
“You are welcome” Thor smiled at him sipping his own drink. Tony smelled his and it smelled familiar. He tasted it and was surprised. “This is what you made me yesterday right?” Tony said in awe. Thor just grinned at him with pride. He rummaged through the bag again and took out a few pastries and sandwiches too. “This is wow, Thanks Thor, Do I owe you anything?” Thor just shook his head smiling” It’s my treat”
Tony sees something he should never have seen.
“He’s singing about you, you know” Clint said not looking at Tony.
A few minutes pass until Tony pulls away. “Thanks Thor, I didn’t know what came over me” Tony said chuckling wiping at his eyes, he felt a hand wipe away the other side of his face. “Everyone needs comfort Tony, I’m glad I could provide you with some” Thor said smiling.
Sapphire Tony arrived with his escorts atop a floating structure high above the clouds. This was the base for the colonizers and fighter stationed to colonize Earth.

“3:42 AM” A mechanized voice replied.
This is not the end. I'm thinking of a few more chapters and an Epilogue too. Thanks a lot for the support! Tell me what you think and if you have any Ideas or concerns please by all means pitch them in :D Thanks for reading!
“Steeeve! STEVE!! Help me please! I don’t want to be alone.” Steve struggled and the darkness that was binding him lost it’s grip as he made his way to where Tony was. “Tony! I’m coming! He ran as fast as his legs could go but he couldn’t even get close, The darkness wrapped itself around Tony more as it pulled him in.
It's been a while and I'm sorry. Thanks for liking the story. It makes writing this more how should I say this, Wonderful!
With him as an escort were three Rubies, common soldiers sworn to uphold any duty given to them. Ruby Bucky, Ruby Rhodes and Ruby Steve. The Rubies were common gems decked out in their military uniforms. Each had their gem placed in different areas of their arms. Bucky’s was on his shoulder, Rhodes had his on the upper part of his hand and Steve’s was on his palm.
Centuries ago, in far away in an unknown galaxy, a planet populated by advanced beings was colonizing other planets to expand their reach. The planet was known only as Homeworld to those who came from it. Homeworld sought to expand to all the reaches of the universe, colonizing each planet they reach and is placed under their rule whether or not the planet was inhabited.
Every so often his mind would venture to thoughts of Steve (unintentionally). It’s only been a day but it felt a lot longer than that.  He’s discovering all of the hidden feelings he’s had for Steve but the reality is; Steve’s out of reach. Would things still be the same between them? Would it change a lot between them? Tony for the first time admits; he doesn’t know the answer.
“Tony?” Steve asked as he tugged on their Joined hands. “Wanna go out with me?” Tony responded by grabbing Steve’s shirt and pulling him down for another kiss.
Steve was even sending him messages and calls but Tony doesn’t read them or pickup/ return the calls. He was acting very rash and childish but hey he was both and more.
“So the weeks went by, I stayed the same but he began to drift away, I was left alone. Still I’m waiting for the day when he’d say I will always love you” Steve suddenly felt a pang of emotion. He was crying then. He set down his guitar as he scrambled to wipe at his face.
He sat there and held Tony’s hand in his. Softly speaking to him of what happened that day and most days. Others had visited and stayed for a while, giving Steve clothes and orders to go rest. Pepper had been the more frequent. She says it’s to make sure Tony didn’t fake it to avoid work but he saw the concern in her eyes. She had asked for a private room and a cot to be added in to the room for Steve. She was a great supporter for their relationship.
One more to go. I'm still learning how to write concisely and I hope to write more. Please tell me what you think and things I could improve on. One more chapter to go which would be a continuation for this. :D
Might add one more chapter, just for closure.
“Yeah” Tony smiled and waved back at him.
“What are you doing Steve?” Tony asked curious. “Bedding for you my clarity” Steve answered not looking at him and proceeded to gather more leaves and soft materials. Tony chuckled and proceeded to help. Steve said it was alright and to just let him do the task but Tony was firm with his intent.
They sat in comfortable silence as Steve dug into his food and Tony just looked around the room trying to figure out where to put up the decorations. When Steve finished they got to work decorating the room.
“Thor? Do you like me?” Tony asked.
He asked Banner but it turned into a lecture on science that Steve couldn’t comprehend so he just moved on.
Ruby Steve looked around, the area they landed in was a field of grass surrounded by mountain ranges. The sky was also raining down on them. He looked over at Tony who had an expression of confusion plastered across his face.
More to come soon.
“This was the best Steve, It really was” Tony said happily yet sleepiness was evident in his voice. “It was Tony” Steve agreed petting Tony’s hair. “Good friends, great food, killer booze, seriously though, remind me to ban Thor from ever bringing that stuff again but maybe a little won’t be too bad, right?” Steve just hummed at Tony’s rambling, still stroking Tony’s hair. He felt Tony lean into his touch.
Tony took a deep breath and sighed heavily. How was he going to tell Thor? What will happen tomorrow. He picked up his pad and pen and started writing again, waiting for Thor’s shift to end.
“Tony! Tony! Toooony!!!!!” Steve reached out his hand almost reaching Tony but Tony was violently sucked into the darkness all light gone.
Steve’s room was less lavish than Tony’s. He’d given Steve free reign to redecorate as much as he wanted. It was a bit of a vintage feeling as if he was taken back in time. Steve had few belongings and his walls were decorated with sketches and paintings he made since coming to the tower.
Steve memorized the words and sang from his heart. He didn’t realize he was being heard.
Steve reluctantly let go of Tony’s hand and kissed him firmly on his forehead after being the first to rush out of the room, the others following him out.
Steve chuckled. “Might be a factor.” Steve caught himself staring at Tony and realized he was thinking about his obvious allure. He cleared his throat. “Anyway, you said you’ve been searching for him?”
"We'll revisit you conspiring with my AI later. What did you want to talk about?"
“Do you think they’ll ask you to recruit any of us?”
“I know you’re right,” Phil agreed sadly, “but I have a hard time believing that of any of them. And are you telling me that you think Fury might be Hydra?”
Pierce laughed. “No. I can see why you’d be uncertain, though. It’s so helpful to have him swooping about like an overgrown bat. Draws suspicion off of me and mine. Speaking of which, how did you find out I was Hydra? I like to think that I play my part well.”
and smirked a little when Steve asked him to tell Pepper she was right about the BBC
"How do you know? Maybe I'm very responsible."
If Sharon was taken aback by his request or the abrupt manner in which he made it, her face didn’t show it. “And what kind of help would that be, Captain?”
Steve chuckled. “Pretty much. She gave me a hard time over that, too. So that solves that problem. The other thing she mentioned is that she has a great-niece at SHIELD – Sharon – who apparently doesn’t advertise that she’s related to the co-founder. I’m having dinner with her tonight at the hotel so I can fill her in.”
"What is this TRH?" Tony demanded, annoyed that two of his supposed teammates were in on something that Tony had been left out of. Fury must have been planning on cutting him out for a while since he'd never heard of this TRH thing before.
All the while he drove to the Stark tower he worried about leaving Tony alone with Pepper. He wasn’t worried about Pepper, but he was worried how Tony would take being left with her. He made a pit stop on his way and picked up pizza. Tony always loved pizza. They would eat, talk, he would tell Tony about his situation, about how he needed to keep his omega status a secret, and how he was part of a group called the Avengers now. About the arc reactor if Tony freaked out about it. But generally about why he needed to act like an alpha, at least until he was healed enough to make an informed decision to come out. Then Steve would take Tony back to the doctors himself, tell them about the memory loss, stay with Tony as long as he needed. They had already cleared Tony so Steve thought they could afford to keep the memory loss a secret for a little while.
"You look calm. I'd like to see you like this more often." He said.
There was fire going in the fireplace now, but Tony wasn't able to spot Rogers immediately. Then he realised the other man was in the kitchen. Not really knowing what was expected of him he decided to kneel by the couch. Plus, the heat from the actual fire was nice on his naked skin.
“Thanks Jarvis.” He said as he made his way up the stairs and into the kitchen.
Tony's expression shifted to understanding at that and he leaned forward to peck Steve on his down turned lips. But it was too short a kiss for the alpha to respond. Instead Tony took a step back and hesitated before speaking.
“Jarvis, could you tell him we’re busy? I will call him later.”
“Shh.”
"Fuck yes it's unfair! I am the only submissive in the team. When someone else fucks up, they get reprimanded, a slap on the wrist with a 'Better luck next time.' When I fuck up, I have to be collared and supervised by a dominant? How's that fair? Then there is the fact that no matter what kind of dominant SHIELD assigns to the task, that dom's never gonna understand what it's like to be an Avenger, why I do what I do, or... " why I feel how I feel, he could have said but he realised this was devolving into a too personal a conversation. He did not wanna go there. "You know what, never mind." he said instead. "Apparently you volunteered for the job, so lets make a deal, you enjoy plenty of free blow jobs, and I'll enjoy privacy and autonomy. How about that? FYI, I have no gag reflex." Tony wriggled his eyebrows at the mirror.
Exactly at 12 o'clock on the dot, Tony served the pasta. Simple penne with cream and mushroom sauce out of a ready made packet, with sad looking basil leaves on top with grated parmesan that simply did not look nearly as elegant as it did in the book. The pasta had turned out soggy and all clumped together so Tony had ended up having to try and seperate them by hand. Eventually he'd managed to produce one somewhat proper looking plate out of it and was now nervously waiting for the verdict, standing there only in an apron and a cock cage, rubbing his hands.
At this point Tony was ready to say yes just to see who it was behind the mirror. But that would be a complete dick move. The dom said he trusted Tony. So if he was going to agree to this he might as well agree to it with the intention of making it work. That started with not pissing on that trust.
“Worry about? You just called him a ‘mark’.  He’s not a tool or a weapon. I’m fine with SHIELD employing my abilities, I’m a solider, and one that is built by the government. Tony is not. He doesn’t have to be tied down by the chain of command, you can’t own him and you can’t use him. He was doing all you guys a favor since the beginning. He has a right to disclose whatever he wants about himself, or not.”
"Good." He could tell the dom was still smiling. It felt so good to know that Steve was this happy with him. And it hadn't been so hard, once he let go and just listened to what Steve was telling him. It was definitely worth it to know he made his dom happy.
“Jarvis, turn down the heat?” He asked, but his voice came out croakier than usual, then he realized he was still hard.
Tony slowed until he could stop without getting dizzy, then he stepped off. He was breathing hard, and feeling warm indeed. He was fit but a 20 minute run would leave any man of his age breathless.
“Hey. What are you doing?” Steve smiled back and dodged a metallic arm as Dumm-E came at him, seemingly with the sole intention of knocking the pizza onto the floor.
There was a moment of silence then Pepper spoke up, sounding determined,
There was a moment of silence in which Steve felt Tony shiver and he knew it had nothing to do with the memory of the cold from the previous night. Then finally the omega went lax in his grip and bent his head to the side, exposing his throat and the very faint mark Steve had left there.
He remembered the look in Steve's eyes when he had said "MY collar" and his hand went to touch the collar in question.
"Oh my god.. Tony..." She gasp after some shuffling of papers, "What? These are.. These are stock transfer vouchers. All in Steve's name! What are you doing!? Why would you transfer all your SI stocks to Steve?"
Frustrated, Steve was playing the car ride from Syria to Turkey in his head, nothing weird there. Except Tony’s silence. But at the time Steve had thought it was because he was tired, sick, in shock.. whatever state people found themselves in after being shot down with an antiaircraft missile in a tin can. Then Tony’s behavior at the border. Was it possible that Steve was exaggerating? Tony had simply been disoriented and combined with Steve’s wishful thinking it had felt like Tony had clung to him? Looked at him with relief and hope? But no, Tony had clearly called for Steve. He had started to say something. “I thought…” what..? What had Tony thought?
It’s been a week since Tony last spoke to Steve but Tony was stubborn to not think about it too much. He knew that Steve would get tired eventually and move on to better friends, besides he’s got Peggy.
Tony was in his lab when he heard an unexpected noise, he readied his gauntlet but as soon as he saw Clint emerge from the vent he relaxed a bit.
He gently shook Tony awake causing Tony to jolt up surprised.
Once done Tony looked for a place to “recline” as Thor put it. The interior was simple yet had a homey feel to it, there was a selection of tables, booths and recliners. It felt like a mix of a dining room and a den. Tony settled on a vacant recliner in the corner of the room. There was a fireplace there as well. This place would be perfect hang out for winter, he thought Steve might like it.
He learned to cope, he adapted but not alone. He needed help and he got it. From S.H.I.E.L.D, his team mates and someone very special; Tony Stark. Tony and Steve got off to a rocky start but after a while they warmed up to each other and ultimately they became great friends. Tony teaching Steve about the future and Steve helping Tony cope with his past.
What will the new day Bring for Tony?
“Do-do you want to talk about it” Tony asked quietly.
“Tony? Are you well, you were staring into space?” Thor asked concerned.
“It’s okay Steve; I knew this was to be done. You did your best. I’ll see you soon kay?” Tony said as the pearl swung her word.
“Who - are - you?” Tony passed out after that.
He sat on the couch waiting for the aroma of caffeine to fill the room. He had an Idea in his brain and he needed to get to his lab to make it work. He heard the sound of the machine die down and he made his way back over there. He rummaged through the cabinets on the wall and got the biggest mug he could find. He poured himself almost half the pot and took big gulps filling himself with caffeine; the fuel of his body. Once he finished he got dressed and left a note for Thor when he wakes up.
In their talk they started talking about what their lives were before everything and at some point Steve had held Tony’s hand as Tony started tearing up with memories from the past. Steve did too and soon they found themselves relieved of their fears just with their simple talk.
“Movies” Steve said giving Tony a small smile. “Right!” Tony patted Steve’s chest as Steve slowly let go. “I’m going to get snacks ready, you (pointing at Steve) take a shower, you smell, maybe I will too cause I think you just passed your sweat to me. Tony walked to the entry way. “Don’t take too long, I might fall asleep waiting for you” Tony said as he was leaving.  “You always do, plus don’t just get junk food like you always do and leave coffee to just one mug not the entire pot!” Steve said jogging to the shower room.
Steve thought for a moment. “I don’t know, honestly, but since we’ve gotten so close together and when we became real friends and I saw the different sides of you, I grew to admire you. I guess slowly that admiration grew into something else completely.”
“Tony” Thor softly called out his name and made his way to Tony’s side wrapping him in a tight embrace.
“Can I take you up on that offer?” Tony asked his eyes sincere as he looked at Steve. Steve nodded and they made their way to his room.
“Thanks Steve” Tony said smiling up at Steve. Steve smiled back and munched on the kiwi.
Sapphire Tony was one of Homeworld’s brilliant minds and noblest of aristocrats. A genius created to design and configure weaponry for the benefit of Homeworld. One of his most unique traits aside from his intelligence was his ability to look into the future. His ability had helped Homeworld conquer planets that offered resistance. His gem was embedded in his chest; a brilliant blue with a triangular facet which glowed in the most brilliant blue light.
Pepper had been great with handling their relationship. She was Tony’s ex but she gave them her full support. As long as they were both happy and Tony did his part in the company, they were good. She was also really amazed someone could handle Tony better than her.
“Did I disturb you?” Thor asked politely
Steve exited the roof as the sun was setting, good thing, things were quiet and the volume of allied heroes meant that the others can rest when there is a need for it. He made his way down the Avengers tower and as fate would have it, he bumped into someone.
Steve picked up his guitar again and prepared to play again but he was startled when his door burst open and Tony came running in calling out to him.
I know this feels a little unstructured but it went along great for me. Kudos and Comments are appreciated and if you happen to think somethings amiss please don't hesitate to say it.
It tasted really good, a lot of chocolate flavor was there and there were even pieces of chocolate inside the thing but Tony felt strange this tasted familiar. He’s eaten this muffin before. He thought for a minute until he recalled; Steve made him these before. Suddenly it was hard to swallow and Tony fumbled getting the thermos open. Steve made these.
“That’s good. I want that too. I’ve wanted that for a while, if I’m being honest.” Steve looked at Tony from under his lashes.
“Definitely. Can you get to New York? I know that the rest of the team would be happy to see you, and Stark Tower – ”
Steve sighed internally but nodded back. "Rumlow." He couldn't figure this guy out. Before the Battle of New York, Brock Rumlow had mostly ignored him, which suited Steve just fine. According to Fury, Rumlow and the rest of the Strike team were among the best SHIELD had to offer, but something about Rumlow just rubbed him the wrong way. "Things are great." He wasn't sure what to say – he and Rumlow had never been alone together. Luckily, he didn't have to do anything. Rumlow finished getting his things together and headed for the door. As he walked by, Steve heard him whisper two words.
“And Bucky’s not responsible for your parents. That was Hydra’s fault.”
“Helicarriers that go up and never come down and can easily kill a whole lot of people really fast,” Tony replied.
“I’m sorry, what?” Tony said, turning to Steve. “You don’t look surprised. Why aren’t you surprised? I feel like you’re taking this warrior-stoic thing too far. This is shocking. And terrible. There are Hydra members inside SHIELD. Be more surprised, please.”
Steve entered SHIELD, wearing all the stealth and recording gear that Tony had made for him, prepared to see Director Fury, but hoping that he’d have the opportunity to see Pierce first. Luck was with him. Pierce was standing outside the elevator as Steve got off. “Captain, I know you’re very busy, but might I have a word with you?”
“Maybe Bruce or I should go with you.”
“You know, he’s going to get his feelings hurt if you call everyone by their first name except him. Call him Bruce. And sure, I’ll give him a call. Not so sure about Thor.”
Steve blinked at her. That was not what he was expecting. “Uh, no. Clint mentioned it, but I haven’t gotten there yet.”
“You’re going to have trouble believing this, but I need you to give it a shot. I’m you from the future. I know, I know. Crazy, right? I was just saying the other day how much I miss the days when the craziest thing science had come up with was me. We weren’t supposed to change anything, but I’m sure I’ve already done that telling you Bucky was alive. I wasn’t lying about that, by the way. He is. I don’t have much time, so I’ll just tell you two things. The first is to prove I am who I say. You’re attracted to men. As much as you wanted to love Peggy, and as much as you might’ve grown to be happy with her, she was never your destiny. You’ve never told anyone, not even Bucky, but your first crush was on the boy down the street who lived with his family over the butcher shop.” Steve opened his mouth, but the recording continued, “Don’t interrupt. Yeah, I knew you were gonna. Just listen. The other thing I’m going to say is this: trust Tony. You won’t always understand him. In fact, you’ll almost never understand him, and by the time you’ve unraveled one thing, he’s already done five more crazy things and you can’t catch up. But trust him. Trust the team. And make sure you deserve their trust in you. What you started today can be the most amazing thing in your life if you let it. So let it. I have to go. Good luck. Don’t make my mistakes.”
Steve sat there in shock for a moment, then pulled out his phone and called Tony. He picked up after only half a ring. “Yeah, I know, don’t start, Rogers,” he grumbled in place of a greeting.
“Is something wrong with it? This is the phone SHIELD gave me. Should I ask for a different one?”
“Okay, look, I’m a spy, but when I’m not undercover, I pretty much call it like I see it. So I wanted to talk to you about something. I called Bucky pretty when we were here yesterday, and you kinda reacted to that, so I’m just going to tell you right out. Things are not the way they were when you went under. I mean, I know you know that. But specifically, men liking other men is not the way it was when you went under. It’s legal to be gay now. It’s even legal to get married, at least some places. I wasn’t really thinking when I said it. I’ve never made much of a secret of the fact that I’m bi – bisexual, I like men
"Okay, so back to the plan. Steve was recruited by Red Skull, then, while doing his research on SHIELD, discovered that Zola was inside SHIELD from the beginning. But how did he figure out which SHIELD agents were Hydra? If it was obvious, Fury would figure it out," said Clint.
After he hung up with Pepper, Tony turned to Steve. “Okay, so the spy twins are going to Malibu, apparently. Do you have plans for the rest of us, oh fearless leader?”
“Yes, Captain Rogers. The man who has entered is a match for Philip J. Coulson, Agent of SHIELD.”
And then he was gone.
“Come on, Stevie! This is the universe granting you a second chance to not blow it! You need to tap into whatever courage you use to run into burning buildings or leap into crazy fights and use it to ask this guy out instead.”
His head was clearer now. He had bitten Tony pretty badly there in the end. He knew Tony wasn’t in distress, if not by the scent, by the way the omega was snuggling into him right now, but he’d still do better to have a doctor see it. Tony on the other hand, looked like he didn’t have a single care in the world right now. Steve couldn’t see his face as Tony had his back to Steve’s chest but the way he pushed his hips into Steve’s crotch in an effort to keep Steve inside him, the way he hugged Steve’s arm closer to his chest and kept placing small kisses on his hand reassured the alpha. He hugged Tony tighter and kissed his hair.
The dom chuckled at that, which turned into a moan. Tony strained to see the details through the wet glass, was Steve rubbing a thumb over his slit on every up stroke? How tight did he enjoy it? He could tell Steve must enjoy himself slow though, at least at first. The captain was working himself up and down, his balls following the movement along with Tony's eyes.
Then the dominants hand landed on top of his head and carded through his hair. It was a big but gentle hand, and the feeling in the pit of Tony's stomach burst into a full blown yearning. Some instinct screamed at him that yes! This was right! Just give in! See how good it feels?
Dominating someone didn’t always have to involve sex, Steve knew. But Tony had this incredible effect on Steve, his brilliance, wild will, and vast confidence tamed under his willing submission… Not to mention Tony was exceptionally beautiful to look at, weather in a pair of track pants punching a sandbag, dolled up in a tux, or on his knees. When it was a Tony himself willingly bowing to Steve, without resentment or shame, Steve fell a little bit in love. He knew this would be problematic, but at this moment, it was easy to ignore what the future might bring.
Tony patted his hand carelessly and turned to point at another young girl with dark hair and slanted eyes while Mike looked down at his hand like he planned to never wash it again. “And Ms Sato here is a computer genius. She’s 22! You should hear her story about the mission in Mexico, Steve. She’s trying to be modest about it, but they say she saved everyone's asses with her exceptional skills.” Some of the others at the table nodded as the Asian girl blushed this time.
"Oh fuck.." Tony muttered, watching wide eyed. His other hand went to the cock cage to press on it, claw at it, provide himself with some sort of relief that was not forthcoming.
Tony blinked, then it clicked.
“Jarvis, could you please wake Tony up and ask him to come to the kitchen.”
"Owww!! Fucking ow! What the hell!?" he tried to get up but a strong forearm pressed him back down.
“Yeah..” was all the answer Pepper had.
But the idea felt inherently wrong. Tony didn’t know for a fact if they had fucked or not before, but he had a gut feeling that the Colonel was not that kind of alpha. He felt more like an older brother than a bed partner. Should he go out and try to find an alpha? But he was too late. Even if he wasn’t the secretly omega billionaire without his memories and thus defenseless easy prey, he was going into heat
Tony sobered up this time, clearly understanding whatever it was, it was a serious matter.
“I hope you won’t regret this.” The colonel said before he got up to leave, “I’ll be around if you need me.”
"Tired."
"Fair enough." He said with a little chuckle.
Steve watched Coulson like a hawk, a million scenarios and options running through his head. When had Coulson found out Tony was an omega? Had he already reported it to SHIELD? Or had SHIELD already known? If so, for how long? What were they planning to do with the information? Or maybe Coulson had just confirmed his suspicions. In which case, Steve needed to stop him from reporting Tony’s orientation. He needed to protect Tony from the downfall. He needed to protect his omega from the potential threat this alpha in a suit with a benign smile was presenting at the moment.
"Well done."
Tony looked down on his eggs miserably for a second, but then Steve's hand was there, covering his.
“What’s the Teserract?” Tony asked, fascinated.
Clint was refusing the plan as it would be a stupid one, but Steve ripped the comm out of his ear and ran out.
"Thanks for the pasta Tony. I know what kind of effort it took you to make that and don't think I don't appreciate it." he said as he wiped his mouth on a serviette.
Tony's body moved irresistibly, in the face of that blue gaze and the solid voice. But then he remembered himself. He put his hands on Steve's still naked chest to stop right before their lips could meet.
“I-I shouldn’t tell you. I mean they told us we shouldn’t give you personal information.”
Tony laughed despite himself.
"I'll just kneel here and watch you shower then." he said petulantly.
Tony stared after him, the dom had barely acknowledged his presence. He wondered how long Steve had really been running.  Then he eased himself into one of the chairs on the kitchen table and settled in to wait.

“Yeah, I got that part. But that doesn’t explain why the whole R&D department is shitting their collective pants right now, just because the guy is coming down for a visit.”
The colonel looked at Tony with wide eyes and everyone in the room could almost hear his heart break. "Tony, I never meant to.. I didn't know what to do.. I only tried to be there for you when you asked of me.."
Tony's smile grew a few megawatts and he threw his arms around Steve's neck and hugged him tight.
Colonel Rhodes just looked dumb struck for a moment, then shook his head.
"Yes. Now hold still."
“..think you can do whatever you want Stark!  These documents are for authorized personnel only, Fury may coddle your spoilt ass but some people here are getting really sick of your selfish disregard for proper…”
Steve smiled at that and made his way to the coffee machine by the counter. Pouring himself a hot cup and bringing the pot to add back a bit of warmth to Tony’s slightly cold coffee.
Tony looked up, Steve was seething in rage. It’s the first time he’s seen him this way. Steve’s anger gave way to concern as he rushed to him, helping him up. When he got up he looked at Steve again, this time he was looking away ashamed. Tony stepped back and instantly Steve’s expression changed again. Steve looked horrified as if he’d killed someone. Tony didn’t take another step Steve visibly calmed down.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Steve! Steve! Cap! Rogers!” voices were heard as he shut his eyes. When he opened them he saw hazy figures and a white sky. He jumped to his feet in a fighting stance only to be met with reality.
“Care to share?” Bruce asked encouragingly.
“You do?” Tony asked slowly. Steve just nodded sliding his hand from Tony’s wrist to his own hand. Tony looked at their joined hands and asked, “Since when?”
It happened a few weeks ago when Tony suddenly changed. He was distancing himself from Steve and the others but mostly Steve. He didn’t let Steve go in the lab anymore. They only interacted through missions and Tony would leave after that. Steve was missing the feeling of being with Tony.
Tony’s mood plummeted. Thor might have sensed this and placed a gentle hand on his arm. “Did anything occur between you two?” Thor asked concerned. “Let’s, let’s talk about it later.” Tony said giving Thor a sad smile. Thor nodded and stood. “I will go back to work now. Rest easy Tony” Thor collected his empty plate and cup and walked back to the counter.
Tony made it to his Locker, depositing his lunch bag inside; he noticed another paper bag inside. He didn’t remember leaving anything there yesterday. Curious, he opened the bag. It was warm and it smelled good. Tony rummaged the contents and saw a chocolate muffin, a few sandwiches, an apple and a small thermos filled with his favorite coffee. He thought that maybe Thor left this in his locker. He took out the muffin and took a big bite out of it.
It took a while for Steve’s brain to process what was happening, his mind picked up the pace when Tony was removing his jacket and caplet along with his boots. Steve felt incredibly warm at the sight. Tony looked back at him and smiled. He moved a bit close to Steve and reached for the clasps on Steve’s uniform.
He found the parking lot not too crowded and as he got out of his car, the smell was intoxicating. Tony put on a pair of shades and made his was to the building. The building was simple yet it had a nice charm to it. The top part of the walls was of a cream color, reminding Tony of a latte’ and the lower part was of a deep brown color almost that of an espresso. He looked at it the closer he got and saw it had impressions on it; coffee beans. The brown part actually had the shape coffee beans designed into it. The windows were wide and tinted but not too much as you could still see the figures of people on the inside
“I thought you were with Peggy?” Tony asked confused. “I’m not” Steve replied simply.
Upon reaching the Milkyway galaxy and arriving to a planet unlike they had ever seen before; Earth. A great rift within their political hierarchy erupted as many who had seen Earth had refused of its colonization which led to the first Homeworld War. An event wherein one of the highest Officials objected to the colonization of Earth and with the aid by those under the official defected from Homeworld and sought to protect the Earth.
Tony broke the awkward silence by clearing his throat and giving Steve a small smile.
Tony stopped mid gulp and swallowed nervously giving Steve a sheepish grin” Sorry, and yeah I should but I won’t.” Tony put down his cup and rummaged through the baggy Steve gave him pulling out a sandwich.
“You love Steve, I understand but it pains me to see you saddened when you see him with Lady Carter” Thor said comfortingly. “Would you not give your love to someone who wants it? Your heart is choosing Steve but would it be selfish of me to wish for you to look at me the way you do with Steve?” Thor asked hopefully.
Pepper gasped and the vouchers she was holding fluttered to the floor.
Tony had to consider for a moment, take stock.
Tony scoffed, but it was Rhodey who responded. “No, sorry, weapons designed by Justin Hammer. And it’s not like I had a lot of options. They wanted more guns. You don’t make guns anymore. Anyway, I’m happy where I am, but you can always call if you need me. Maybe before the world actually ends next time, okay?” He gave Tony a stern look, then a hug, then waved to everyone and left with Pepper.
“What can I do for you, Cap? I thought everyone had bailed. No SHIELD debriefing to attend or search and rescue to organize?”
"Hail Hydra."
“So this is going to sound a little crazy, but that’s apparently the kind of people I hang out with now. Natasha looked into you today. She wanted to make sure you weren’t a plant to lure me into some kind of trap.” Sam opened his mouth, but Steve shook his head and interrupted. “I did not think you were a plant. It would have been a stupid trick anyway. You are the first non-SHIELD person I’ve actually asked to hang out with, so the odds that I’d just talk to a random guy I met running were slim. But then she went and got Tony involved – ”
Over the next several days, he convinced Bruce that he’d never been kissed (“No one paid me any attention before the serum, especially when I was standing next to Bucky. After the serum, there were a lot more important things happening than kissing.”), Tony that he’d never dressed up for Halloween (“We were broke nearly all of the time. Why on earth would I waste money on a costume?”), and Clint that his birthday wasn’t really the fourth of July (“Come on, Clint, what better propaganda is there than a Captain America born on the Fourth?”). Once he got used to it, it was actually a little bit fun trading on the Captain America everyone thought they knew.
“Did he say what?” Steve asked.
“Now we just have to figure out how to get messages to the non-Hydra members of those teams,” Rhodey said. He turned to Natasha and Clint. “Who would you always believe if they sent you a message?”
Second, all of the titles in this story have been/will be Queen songs. For the most part, they’re just representative of what’s happening in the chapter, but there will be some that focus on Steve’s relationship with a particular character and the chapter is named with whatever song I’ve decided to have as that character’s sort of theme song. This chapter is Tony! There are some that came to me pretty easily (like this one!), but I would LOVE to hear ideas for Queen theme songs for any of the characters. Let me know in the comments :)
“I can confirm everything the Captain has stated thus far, sir. The energy signature of the man he fought was definitively not Loki. The explanation provided by the man in question does seem to be the most logical one. I do not have a DNA sample, but based on all of the scans available to me, he was who he said. In addition, tracing his movements back to his arrival in the tower, I have discovered new information. He arrived here in the company of two other men. One has never visited the tower, but based on facial recognition, his identity is Scott Lang, who is currently in prison for breaking into Vistacorp’s headquarters and hacking their systems to return money to their customers. There are no records of him escaping prison. The other man, in all ways I can determine, was Anthony Edward Stark. These two men were in the lobby when you were leaving with Thor. The other Anthony Stark disguised himself as a SHIELD agent, while Scott Lang appears to be able to change his size at will. I believe they were responsible for the malfunction in your arc reactor. Based on my review of the video footage, I believe they were attempting to steal the tesseract until Loki took it and vanished.”
Steve gave a half-smile. “Yes. Extremely symmetrical. I confess, I like my rooms a little better now that Nat and Clint helped me decorate it and it doesn’t resemble a sad retro hole, but still. Nothing there that I can’t move here. If I had to. You know.”
“Miss Potts? This is Steve Rogers.” He saw Tony smirk slightly. “I’m going to have Natasha Romanoff and Clint Barton come out to you. They’ll get some more information from Miss Hansen and make sure the two of you are safe. Will you let us know if anything else happens?” As soon as Steve finished, Natasha and Clint nodded and headed for the roof.
“Certainly, Captain.” There was a brief pause. “They are all located there already, presumably awaiting your return. Shall I take you there now?”
Steve could almost see the smirk he could hear in Tony’s voice. “Well listen to you. Yes, I can add whatever we get from Spy 1 and Spy 2. There will still probably be a lot of agents outside the web that we’re not sure of. We could theoretically come up with an algorithm to designate people as Hydra or SHIELD, but we’d probably have a pretty big margin of error. It’s safer to split people into Hydra, SHIELD, and unsure, then do some more digging on the unsure group.”
"She may not have been," said Natasha, "but she didn't found SHIELD by herself. She would've had to make compromises."
He got to the cafe a little early and sat down in a corner booth with his black coffee to wait. Natasha came in exactly on time, stopped at the counter for a frothy-looking iced coffee, and casually made her way over. She sat across from him and said nothing, sipping her drink. Then, abruptly, she said in a quiet voice, “Tell me about Bucky Barnes.”
“What, is this a pop quiz to see how much I was listening when you talked? I wasn’t taking notes.”
Steve started, mouth open. "There's got to be some mistake. Could someone else have done it and… put his name on the paperwork? That doesn't make sense either. What the hell?"
"We could train together," Natasha suggested.
For the first time, Clint pulled his gaze away from Phil. “We already talked about this, Cap. Any call you want to make, I’ve got your back. You think we should bring him in, we’ll bring him in.”
One week later, Tony texted Steve and asked him to come by the tower. When Steve arrived, JARVIS directed him down to Tony's lab. As usual, Tony was fiddling, but he stopped when Steve came in.
Steve and Bruce exchanged a glance. “Shit. Bruce, if it’s alright with you, I’d like you to stay here and keep working. It’s not that I – ”
It’s perfect,” Steve said.
Steve was still trying to work out how this could be right. "Hmm? Oh not much. I've really only interacted with Fury, Phil, Nat, and Clint."
“Boy, you sure had me fooled. Not only are you not a good little soldier, you are openly asking me to deceive your commanding officer. I’m so proud.” Tony paused to look at the object in his hand, where his tinkering had never ceased. “I’m not going to be your obstacle there, Cap. It’s Romanoff you need to worry about. I know future you is all about the team, but I don’t know if they’re all there yet. Thor won’t be a problem, and Bruce certainly has no trust for the man. But Romanoff is a spy, second only to Fury. They sent her in here undercover to get a read on me. You saw her with Loki. You’d never know she was lying to you. Never mind that her assessment is from when I was imminently dying. She seems loyal to Barton, and Phil’s death hit her hard, but I think Fury still pulls all her strings. Barton probably won’t be our leak, but he won’t stop her from doing it.”
“Hello to you too, Tony,” Bruce smiled.
“Rogers.”
“Yeah, can’t wait. Be careful, Pep.”
Just then a sleek black car pulled up and the window rolled down. "Hey fellas. Either of you know where the Smithsonian is? I'm here to pick up a fossil."
Natasha, clearly sensing that Bruce was about to pull Steve up onto a soapbox in defense of both Tony and abused workers everywhere, attempted to get the discussion back on track. “SHIELD wanted Tony as an engineering consultant. He’s developed some things for us over the last few years.”
Natasha caught his eye and nodded. "Let's go, Clint. We have a lot of personnel to comb through."
him. He liked some of them better than others but made the same polite small talk with everyone. After Natasha had left for the day, he usually kept pretty much to himself. He'd put in his headphones and run or destroy some punching bags. He knew he'd be going on missions with many of these agents sooner or later, but he wanted to solidify his team first, and he wasn't even close. One February day, he was in the locker room putting his stuff back together and one of his least favorite agents approached him. They were alone in the locker room when he greeted Steve. "Hey Cap. How are things? Making progress with everything you've got going on?"
“You’re right. I got hit with a mystical glow stick and suddenly had no will of my own. I saw the files you pulled. Bucky got tortured for decades, got his mind wiped over and over again, and the notes say he still had to be told he was doing this for the greater good.”
Steve stood frozen for a moment before pulling out his phone, thanking his lucky stars that he'd let Tony work some SHIELD-proofing magic on it. He pulled up the Avengers group chat and sent a message.
“He has to do it,” Natasha argued. “They can’t know that we know they’re Hydra. If he would’ve done it for SHIELD, he has to do it now.”
"No. From what she says, I may have to return to Asgard, and I would not take you away from your duties here. If I go there, I will have help enough."
Steve choked slightly on the orange juice he was drinking. “Ask him out? Like on a date?”
you? You knew. You
“And Tony?”
Steve sat with his head bowed. “You’re right. He was just so good, you know? I was runnin’ around committing felonies trying to join the army, and he was just trying to go to a science expo with a pretty girl. He always took care of me, even after I pulled him out of hell. Smart, too. I looked up some stuff, and do you know how much math you have to do to be a good sniper? Without any of the fancy scopes you have now. He was always good with math.” Steve took a deep, shuddery breath, finally looking up to meet Tony’s eyes. “What must they have done to him to turn him into the Winter Soldier?”
“I’m not surprised. You know when I was surprised? Thirty minutes ago when Rumlow said ‘Hail Hydra’ to me in a locker room. This no longer makes the cut of things I find surprising. Now I’m just pissed.” Steve consciously relaxed his jaw.
Steve took a deep breath. "I thought maybe I'd go see Peggy. Do you know where she's living now?"
“Yeah, that’ll definitely cut deep. Can you believe Jemma shot Sitwell?” Steve chuckled at the thought.
“Yeah, sure. Miss Virginia Potts, CEO, ties the knot. You’ve been working extra hours all week. None of the prep caused you to break out the wine, though. What happened? Someone get stood up at the altar?”
Steve huffed out a laugh. “Yes, please, dispense with the kid gloves. Might actually be my favorite thing about Stark. Zero risk of kid gloves there. How am I ever supposed to catch up if everyone keeps pretending nothing’s changed?” As they finished eating, they made plans to meet up the next day to buy him a new phone, then decided to meet at Natasha’s to watch their first movie. Despite everything that had happened that day – and boy, had it been maybe the longest day in history – Steve went to bed feeling more hopeful than he had so far this century.
“Shouldn’t we be focused on Hydra, not finding me a date?” he said quietly, more than a little desperate now.
The man chuckled. "I need a new set of lungs. Dude. You just ran like 13 miles in 30 minutes."
Steve felt grief wash over him. "That's, uh, Peggy Carter." He thought about saying more but decided against it.
Trip laughed. “Yeah, I can see that. Look, this is all pretty heavy, but we’ll get through it. I’ll let you know if I get anything on Garrett. And let me know what I can do.” He raised an eyebrow when Steve’s phone played a snippet of the song
"Alright, but you take a comm unit with you. I want the data on intergalactic coverage anyway," said Tony with a smirk. Steve was beginning to notice that Tony tried to distract from his own kindness with quips and mocking.
“J, pull up the pictures from SHIELD’s founding. I know Howard had some in storage. Cap, take a look. Anyone look familiar?”
Steve just stared at him. “Going on? Where?” His brain finally clicked through modern vernacular, more slowly than he thought it should, considering the beer didn’t affect him. “OH. No. There is no there, there. We’re not together.” He paused, filtering the evening through a new lens. “Why, you gonna make a move?”
“I’m glad,” Steve said gently. “I, uh, I get the impression that you’re concerned about upsetting me. I’m glad Peggy got married. He would’ve had to have been pretty special for her to get married. She deserved special. But she and I weren’t… I wasn’t in love with her.” Tony’s head shot up from where he’d been staring at his desk. “She was the first dame – woman – I could really talk to, and I know that we got painted as sort of star-crossed lovers in a lot of the stories. And maybe, if things had been different, I would’ve loved her. I like to think we could’ve made each other happy. I’m sorry I never got to see all the amazing things she did. And I miss her… very much. But I don’t think she was really meant for me.” He’d gotten good at these sorts of half-truths a long time ago – talking about women without giving away that he had no real interest in them. He felt like he should tell Tony he was gay, but he wasn’t ready. But then again, maybe this was one of the things his future self had meant that he should trust Tony with. It had all just been easier with Clint, somehow. Clint had said something first, been ready to take on Captain America if it turned out that Captain America was a bigot. Still, trust Tony. Steve shook his head. “That was a lie.”
He went to the couch and sat down instead, deciding that this afternoon would be for Tony’s benefit, so the omega could relax and let go, let go of his stubborn will, of his obligation to make choices and decisions. Rest. Steve supposed Tony had been needing this kind of rest for a long time. Too long to even consider. He just hoped he could give it to him, without snapping along the way.
He unpacked slowly, giving Tony time to settle and get used to being on his knees, reach that quiet state of mind. If Tony needed to go there, he would. If not, he would get bored and start cracking jokes despite Steve’s order to be quiet, but Steve guessed however much Tony enjoyed poking around in R&D, he still could use a break from the pretence and the people.
"Can I take a break to use the bathroom? I'll be right back."
“Yeah, no. Sorry.” He shrugged like it wasn’t a big deal to him but now Steve could tell that it really bothered Tony to disappoint people like this.
“Yes, Captain.”
“Look I know you want me to say yes, Steve. But I..“ He pulled his hand back from Pepper’s loose grasp, his tone lost the tinge of anger, going soft once more “I don’t know what this shield is you’re talking about. I don’t know where I am or.. ”
A bottle of water was held to his lips and tipped gently, so Tony drank.
Steve just kept looking at Tony expectantly and Tony was getting desperate.
But after that… Tony closed his eyes for a second even through his reckless driving. Bliss. Salvation. He remembered that part clearly. He had vaguely recognized Steve. Mostly the parts about him that told Tony’s hind brain that, this was a strong alpha, a good alpha that he trusted and obeyed. It was okay for Steve to touch him. Not just okay but Tony wanted Steve to touch him. And Steve did touch him. First providing warmth, then safety in his arms. He had smelled heavenly too, all hard muscle and solid comfort under his hands. Tony had been scared and Steve had been there to keep him safe.
"I know it's hard to understand what I mean right now, but you will. I will tell you what you can expect of an average day in the coming week. I wake up at 5, I don't expect you to wake up with me. I go for an hour long  run every morning, and when I come back I will expect the breakfast and coffee to be ready. You will be showered, shaved and have prepared breakfast by 6:30. You decide when you want to wake up. I won't tolerate it if you're late."
Tony was curious about everything. And even if Steve was no meathead, Tony was much smarter than him. After about the second day in the workshop, going through all the science stuff Tony had forgotten about, Steve was already having trouble keeping up with Tony’s techno babble as Tony kept examining the various projects Jarvis had put in chronological order. It had taken Tony no time to reach the project detailing how he had built the first suit.
"He brought a date? The agent has a date? I have to see this."
“It was one month and 4 days before your accident in Syria, sir.”
"I said come here."
At that Tony smiled at him and kept eating. Steve thought, so that’s what it feels like. And it was the best feeling in the whole world.
Steve froze, letting Tony lap at his fingers. When he had planned their quiet lunch he hadn’t thought Tony would so openly do something this suggestive. He felt himself harden but luckily Tony’s eyes were closed as he kept sucking on Steve’s fingers even after all the chocolate was gone.
“How about I urgently want to see him naked?” Tony tried.
“You did very well today,” he started, and Tony frowned a little, he opened his eyes to give Steve a look that said ‘are you kidding me?’. Steve chuckled.
He didn’t want Steve to leave. But there was no fair reason to ask Steve to stay. He knew Steve was trying to offer to stay as tactfully as possible and failing hard, Tony wanted to tell him yes, yes he needed Steve here. He was still scared, that his only anchor to the world around him was Steve. But it would be unfair to him. The guy had his own life. Maybe his own omega even? A pretty petite blond, younger than Tony. A girl probably, Steve looked like he’d like boobs. But he was still nice enough to offer as much comfort to Tony as he could.
"You're either going to use your colors or take your punishment. Are you gonna use your colors Tony?"
It took Steve less than ten minutes to reach the spot where the wreck of the Iron Man should be, killing easily and blowing up one of the antiaircraft weapons on his way. He didn’t even take the time to be grateful when Clint helped with the other antiaircraft on his way out, laying down cover fire from the jet before leaving.
“Cold.. Cold shower..” He muttered and stumbled to his bathroom.
In that split second Steve stood tall in front of Tony in nothing but his briefs, Tony’s eyes flickered down and Steve flexed. Tony was clothed and Steve was not but he didn’t feel at a disadvantage at all. He knew how he looked since the serum and he could see Tony’s pupils dilate.
"I'd like that." he said.
Tony started pacing, thinking.
Then the colonel said in a puzzled and raspy voice, "Rhodey?"
"Attitude. I know it's really hard for you to be respectful, but I'll help you with it."
"Really?" Tony asked before he could stop himself and Steve put a hand on his shoulder and said with a smile,
“Who am I to butt in between alphas fighting over an omega.”
Tony was lying naked behind him with his eyes closed. Steve would guess he wasn’t asleep but he was calm. He couldn’t tell if the omega was listening to the conversation Steve was having right at the foot of the bed, on the phone, but Tony gave no indication of paying attention.
It felt stunning to hear himself say the words. He'd never even allowed himself to think it but deep down he'd been carrying the guilt and the shame. It'd never gone away.
Tony took in Steve's words, unsure what exactly Steve was asking, but there had been one huge thing preying on his mind a while and his defences were down. It came tumbling out.
Then the Captain's breath was on the side of his neck, "That's a swat for cursing Tony."
"Not a strong suit of mine."
“Steve, he was taking the suppressants.. He is not anymore, because he doesn’t remember them, and I didn’t think.. Shit.. He went cold turkey without realizing..”
He hadn't realized he'd went soft when Steve picked up the pen and paper but now he was starting to get hard again. As soon as the thought entered his head, how he was getting hard just because he was feeling so objectified, his cock twitched.
"Fu- Fudge! You do realise you have super strength right!?"
Steve helped him dress, putting a tshirt and pyjama pants on Tony, then when Tony was in bed in the room Steve said was his, the dom laid down next to him on top of the covers.
“Steve. He made the decision to spend his heat with you. Even if he recovered his memories, I highly doubt he’d run away from you. For all his faults, Tony is a man who owns up to his decisions.”
"Alright let's do this."
"Then you are still wearing MY collar!" The Captain took a step towards Tony and the sub took a step back, shocked.
"What the hell Rogers!" Tony exploded in his face.
All the evidence suggested that Iron Man had fallen in battle. There was no way of crossing the enemy line once more since help had arrived, tripling the enemy troops. Even if Steve could cross it, after what they had seen, there should be no part of Tony left to salvage. Only logical course of action was to cloak the jet and hightail it out of there.
Steve let the collar slip from his fingers and it hurt Tony, somewhere behind his ribcage. He took a step back.
“Oh.. Bad..” The lab assistant that Tony had cornered answered, then he went on licking his lips, “I-I mean, of course he’s a very nice guy, Mr Stark.  Please don’t tell him I said.. You know.. ”
"I half expected to find you with your bags packed." Steve said as he sat down.
For a long while the room was filled only with the soft noises Tony made as he sucked the captain. The he swallowed everything Steve had to give and dragged himself all the way up the bed till he was lying on top of Steve, chest to chest.
He grabbed the wheel and started the car.
Before he can either start crying or puking or whatever else incredibly embarrasing, Steve pressed him into his chest, put an arm under his knees and stood up, lifting Tony along with him.
“I.. Look I get that heats are hard to get through.. Especially alone.. But to do that? And he said.. He said he didn’t want to force me to be with him..that way. But he had asked me to stay the night. I don’t see why he’d be scared enough to do such a thing.”
After that was just boredom again. It felt weird to run naked, brought into mind the Olympians. He supposed it would be easier without an erection. He could hear Steve moving things around, dragging mats and pushing machines. The dom was up to something and Tony had no clue what it might be. But this time he didn't dare turn and look. He'd been ordered to stare at the pool in front of the threadmills, and it was a relatively easy order to obey. If previous punishments Steve dealt was any indication, Tony didn't want to accumulate more.
"No I. I fuck up. And I can't fix it. People get hurt."
“Yeah. I’ve read the files.”
“Happy. Have you seen Tony? Pepper told me you might be taking him home.”
"What do you mean 'nope', I need to take a leak."
When he met Pepper’s gaze, the look in her eyes were softer.
Tony woke up to an unfamiliar feeling of well-being. Not that he had felt bad before, he was generally a happy person. But now, he felt like everything was exceptionally good, the way the covers touched his skin, the afternoon sun light coming in through the window, how lazy he felt… Then there were the aches and pains. He just laid there for a moment with his eyes closed and felt all the aching spots in his body and they ached very good, like the sort of ache that comes after a deep massage or a through work-out. Well. He discovered that he couldn’t properly turn his head because his neck was stiff but even that didn’t bother Tony. It only pointed to the fact that Steve was in bed with him. The alpha who’d put the aches and marks on Tony’s body. Steve.
“What the fuck?” Tony cried as he pushed at Steve’s steel grip.
“Uhm. Sorry. Dum-E no!” The bot moved away, chastised. “Aren’t these things cool?? This is so awesome. Apparently I’m a very cool guy.”
