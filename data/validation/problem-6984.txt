One of the Alpha quickly blocked his way towards his supposed direction as the other closed in on him. Steve decided to turn on a brave face.
Steve looked disappointed but nodded. Part of him was probably too scared to learn more about this side of Bucky. "If he finds us now-"
"Bucky I thought we agreed to wait until you come back. Not that I don't want to.." Steve runs his hand through Bucky's hair and massaged the scalp as the Alpha hummed in satisfaction.
"Well...apparently yes." He tried to keep a straight face but failing miserably. He could not process the fact that his new boss just harassed him on his first day.
“Look why don’t we all just settle down and not fight over Steve especially in the hospital. You will cause him distress. Let’s just wait till he’s awake.” Happy pleads, looking at everyone.
Steve laughed. "We got all the time we need try out all the menus on the truck as long as I'm here."
Tony had hit a couple of low points in his day, but sitting in his workshop accompanied solely by his bots and a bottle of his finest scotch, this was the lowest of all of them.
Tony jumped into action without hesitation: he knew that sound like he knew the sound of his own voice. Someone had gotten too close to the volcano while he was working, and that meant that someone was in danger of catching some serious volcanic ash in the next couple of minutes. With Mark III out of commission for at least another week, Tony had no choice but to step into Mark II and activate the suit with his aura alone.
“You’ve got me now, kid,” Tony said, but he kept his gaze focused on the suit in front of him. Even if he couldn’t bring himself to look at the boy, the words were a fiery determination. He meant them with every fiber in his godly being.
Attached was a picture of Steve’s cum splattered across his broad chest; his lips were in frame, twisted into a smug grin. That was enough to send Tony over the edge, his orgasm wracking his whole body. He came in his hand, his breath coming in ragged moans and his legs trembling uncontrollably. He scooped his discarded shirt up from the floor to wipe himself clean and typed out a response to Steve.
“I guess he realized who I was once we were in the air,” Steve said, and he wasn’t sure whether he was lying at the moment. It would make sense for Tony to return any humans he picked up outside of Pyra, not bring them into the pit of the fire. Maybe Tony had known who he was when he flew toward them, and Steve pushed the thought to the back of his mind. He didn’t know how to feel about that yet.
in here, into your home, and you destroyed your—this thing—saving me,” he gestured helplessly at the armor in front of them.
Rhodey cleared his throat, bringing Tony back to the workshop. “Yeah, back to Olympus. But before we need a plan, we need to fix your suit.”
Tony’s eyes fluttered open for a brief moment before they were closed again, but it was enough for Rhodey to breathe a sigh of relief. He pulled Tony upright, but Tony was deadweight in his arms, and Rhodey struggled to get him to his feet. Tony mumbled incoherently as they stood, his legs slack beneath him. Rhodey draped Tony’s arms over his shoulder and drug him as carefully as he could, struggling up the side of the volcanic mountain.
“I know that,” Steve laughed shortly. “It was hard to watch—Tony being struck down like that. I can’t understand why Fury did it.”
this chapter was another one that was special to me, but i know you guys are anxious to have steve back in pyra, and i am too. hang in there, it's coming sooner than you think. i love you guys 3000.
here,” Rhodey had countered, but the argument ended there, and he flew back to Olympus. His absence was felt, but Tony’s focus remained on the boy that sat to his right. Not even 3 hours ago, Peter had fallen into Pyra while he was searching for his mother, and Tony had caught him. They’d only narrowly escaped a deadly impact at the bottom of the volcano, but Peter had lived. Tony knew that saving the boy’s life was not for nothing; he’d do everything in his power to make sure that Peter could find a new home in Pyra—and eventually on Olympus, if the stirring rebellion that Rhodey spoke of was true.
“For most of us? Liabilities. We all have people that we care about. Fury is willing to use those people against us in order to maintain his position as the leader. In order to prevent the upheaval of Olympus. We all saw what happened to Thor’s brother; no one is willing to risk that again.”
“I guess he thought that I was one of the Athenians. He thought he was saving someone,” Steve said absentmindedly, recalling the earlier argument between Rhodey and Tony. Tony had come flying at Steve from behind, there was no way he could have recognized him before he grabbed him.
Peter wanted desperately to know what he was referring to, but Tony spoke with such finality. He knew that he wouldn’t get any answers out of him even if he did ask. The boy set the faceplate down gingerly, returning to his seat, but he shifted on the workbench, tucking his tunic under his legs—anything to keep himself from sitting perfectly still.
Rhodey started back towards the entrance of the cavern, his shoes keeping him just above the ground. “Hate that I can’t stay buddy, but I’m sure I’ll see you soon.”
Red metallic paint over the smooth surface—the color that best suited a god of fire. Gold accents because after all, Tony was fond of flashy. He was bold, dangerous, a force to be reckoned with, and his suit would epitomize his personality. Desperate to finally be done with Mark III, he rushed to assemble the suit around his frame. He reached out with his mind, coaxing the metal to come together, and the suit did most of the assembling for him. Tony laughed, elated that it was working. Sometimes he forgot the extent of his own abilities, and the suit bending to his telepathic command was a shock—but a welcome one.
Tony wondered vaguely if that was why he was so automatically drawn to Steve, because of Steve’s enchantments or whatever it was called. He’d thought that, technically being an Olympian, he would be immune to it, but he’d never come in contact with a god like Steve before. In fact, the
Steve circled the throne room, nodding his acknowledgement to those that greeted him. He smiled slightly as visitors welcomed him to Olympus, never knowing exactly who was speaking to him, and never stopping long enough to ask. He was used to being the center of attention, but that didn’t mean that he had ever grown to like it. Steve came to a halt where Rhodey stood, reaching out to shake his hand. Rhodey was the only one on Olympus who Steve had decided he wanted to befriend, and he was relieved when Rhodey took Steve’s hand, giving it a firm shake. He threw Steve a tight-lipped smile, and Steve guessed he was always tense when Fury was near. Steve may have been new to Olympus, but he hadn’t seen Rhodey relax once on the Mountain.
of Olympus. I don’t believe any of that, and there are a couple of other Olympians that think that. Thor is one of them.”
The silence in the throne room was overbearing to the gods that were gathered, but Steve was enjoying this a little too much. He didn’t want to tell everyone else what he and Tony had talked about; he wanted to keep their conversation to himself. He would rather have kept the whole thing to himself—it was the only thing that had happened recently that didn’t leave him with a hollow feeling in his chest. Steve had felt full when he left, the butterflies in his stomach alive at the thought of returning to the lonely god in the mountain. But with all of the Olympians staring him down in this emergency council meeting or
Tony had been up all night and half of the next day working tirelessly on Mark III. Well, attempting to work tirelessly on the suit. Between worrying about Steve and Rhodey and stopping his work every now and then to mess with Dum-E—who was surprisingly more persistent than the other bots—Tony was taking longer than usual to make any progress. One minute, he would be nearly done with the wiring running through the legs, and the next, his mind would be trapped in some sort of worst case scenario of what was happening up on Olympus. What if Fury decided he didn’t want to welcome Steve to join the Olympians after all? What if Rhodey was no longer able to hold his tongue, and he said something that would get him into trouble that he couldn’t get out of? But the thought that Tony feared most—what if something happened and he wasn’t able to help them?
He went to work with the wires, untangling the blue ones from the yellow ones, words bouncing around in his head as he did. “My mom used to tell me about my dad,” he began. “I–I mean did
Tony, finished with the legs of the suit that he had been working on, stood and moved to the other side of the worktable to put the armor’s torso back together.
“So you’ve met the bot then,” Natasha mused, cutting off Steve’s train of thought. “I think it’s more than that, though. After Fury kicked him out, everyone was confused. No one knew why Tony was gone all of a sudden. All Tony took with him was his bot, and he left. There was no big blow up, no fight, no threat on Fury’s part.”
A shadow came over her face, and Steve didn’t know why he’d brought it up. But he’d resented Natasha for not showing up when the city was under siege; he’d resented all of the Olympians for abandoning their people. But after seeing the look on Natasha’s face, Steve wondered if maybe they had wanted to help. Maybe Fury’s pride had kept them from aiding the Athenians. “There was nothing we could do,” the goddess said, and her earlier carefree demeanor had vanished entirely. “Tony was out of Pyra, we were not to leave Olympus.”
Steve gaped at the leader of the gods openly, unsure about what he’d just heard. He looked around the room, and every one of the other gods were staring decidedly at something that was not him, avoiding eye contact with both him and Fury. He could feel that anger radiating from the god at the head of the room as the silence prolonged, and part of Steve felt smug. This all-powerful, all-knowing god of gods was absolutely
The suit was laid out on the worktable in the center of the room, and Tony sat at the head of the table, frayed wires and scratched metal surrounding him. Peter sat to his right side, his head lowered, and an apologetic look contorted his features. Tony had noticed the gradual decrease in Peter’s mood, but he hadn’t said anything. There were too many questions he wanted to ask, but it was so easy for Tony to say the wrong thing—that was something he didn’t want to risk with Peter. The kid sat, watching Tony work at first, his leg bouncing under the table and his fingers drumming his thigh in a nervous habit. After a while, he slumped in his chair, his arms crossed over his chest, and his eyes closed. He breathed in heavily, trying his best to keep calm. “Mr…,” he began, trailing off—Peter wasn’t quite sure how to address the god.
Steve climbed out of his new bed and moved through the house solemnly. He picked up the tunic he had worn yesterday and threw it over one shoulder, cinching it at the waist with a fine gold rope. He hovered in his bedroom for only a moment before deciding to head to the great dining hall of Olympus.
Tony laughed weakly, but a sharp cough cut him off, and he bent over almost unwillingly as he tried to regain his composure. “Rhodes, stupid is my middle name,” he managed, the words coming out in quick, short breaths.
He noticed a larger blonde man, travelling alone in nothing but one piece of fine linen draped over his shoulder and golden sandals strapped around his feet. From the distance, he couldn’t make out any facial features on the man, but his first concern wasn’t recognition—it was his safety. Unlike the other travelers who had been walking around Pyra, this man had none of his belongings, with him, no family members travelling with him. He was completely alone.
He’d heard about Steve before, though he hadn’t known it at the time, but Tony had a hard time believing the man that he’d just met was the same god that he’d heard about. According to legend, the god of love was unsettling sort of enticing--someone that you couldn’t help being drawn to, whether you liked him or not. Tony had mostly heard about Steve from the whispers of the people while he was in Athens’ trying to defend the city from the Spartans. The people adored Steve, though Tony hadn’t known his name at the time. But a lot of the Athenians had talked about the alarm that came with being so drawn to someone without
Natasha walked towards him, perching at the foot of the bed. “Of course. Sorry,” she said, crossing her legs daintily, not sounding sorry at all. “Rhodey went to check on Tony and you had to stay  here?”
Tony quirked an eyebrow up at him, waiting for whatever message Rhodey was supposed to pass along to him this time. Rhodey stepped towards Tony, bringing his arms out, palms open towards the high ceilings of the cavern, as if he were shrugging. He met Tony’s gaze before speaking. “As always, he gave me no context. I have no idea why he wanted me to tell you this.”
Slowly, Steve backed away from Clint, his eyes calculating as he judged the situation. He decided that he wasn’t in any real danger; Fury would have Clint’s head if he maimed Steve so early in his stay on Olympus. Steve took his chances and turned his back on Clint, walking steadily toward the bust that held the arrow. He was hyper aware of the other Olympians watching him from where they sat at their breakfast table. Without even looking in their direction, he could feel Fury’s eyes on him as he made his way back down the pathway.
Thor laughed heartily, and his energy was contagious. Natasha, who had followed the sea god to join them, was smiling as she watched him speak, and Steve felt himself loosen up a little bit as well. Rhodey was already at ease to Steve’s left side, and Steve suddenly felt silly for being on his guard automatically.
just a recap: peter is here now, in the bottom of pyra. not sure if it's mentioned explicitly, but he was trying to get to elysium to find his mom after her death. so he climbed, until he couldn't climb anymore, and then he was falling. but tony was there.
The next morning on Olympus, Steve was far from well-rested. He’d tossed and turned in a bed that was far too large, surrounded by a house that was far too empty. Usually, Steve would fall asleep to the clatter of the city of Athens around him—sometimes the sound would carry into the early hours of the next day. The noise used to annoy him, but after the deafening silence of his first night on Olympus, Steve longed for it more than he thought possible.
Before anyone could say anything else, thunder rolled around them, shaking the clouds that they were standing on. All of the visitors on Olympus looked around, some of them bringing their hands up to try to regain their balance. No one had time to react before a blinding light flashed through the sky, followed by a crackle and an electric hum filled the air. Steve turned on his heel, sure that he would see Fury standing at his throne with a lightning bolt pointed in their direction. Surely what he’d heard had just been the warning shot. But as Steve stared at the thunder god across the great hall, Fury was not looking at him. Fury was standing at the edge of the clouds, his back to the crowd, and another lightning bolt in his hand. His right arm was reared back as he prepared to throw another bolt, and some of the minor gods gathered around him, cheering at the display.
Tony was back to being alone in the pit of the volcano, but for the first time in a long time, he didn’t feel lonely. He had been rejuvenated by Rhodey’s visit, and he’d found an ally in Steve as well, he was sure of it. Steve, who had sprawled out on the floor of Tony’s workshop without hesitation, who’d smiled at him softly as he explained his bots. Tony laughed quietly to himself as he went back to work on his suit, and it was a small, disbelieving laugh. Like he couldn’t believe that someone was capable of enjoying his company. Living in isolation for eternity had the ability to do that to a person.
Steve travelled sullenly to the outskirts of the city, heading in the opposite direction of Mount Olympus. Athens was nestled in between Mount Olympus and the fiery home of Tony Stark, roads running far to the right side of the volcano. Steve had never actually been to Pyra—he’d never needed to. He didn’t need to today, but he didn’t want to go back to his large, lonely house on Olympus, and he didn’t want to stay in the remains of his beloved city any longer.
The tension in the room only grew with Steve’s words, and most of the other Olympians were still avoiding being dragged into the conversation. Maria Hill, however, was not like any of the other Olympians. She rose from her throne with a grace that only the queen of Olympus could possess, but her face held some of the rage that was radiating from Fury on her left. “How dare you?” she began, and her words shook with anger. “You don’t know the threat that he presents. He could bring about the destruction of our home. Our entire way of life.”
Tony looked up from where he was bent over, working on the armor. Peter’s face was red and aggravated from the tears earlier; his eyes were full of sadness that a kid his age should never know, but the boy had decided he was done crying. Despite his resolve, there was a softness to his face—a trait that Tony suspected would never leave Peter. The boy took another steadying breath, running his hand through his hair as he did, and Tony kept at his work.
Steve laughed, mostly with relief, happy to know that he had a friend on Olympus. “Sure thing, boss.”
The pale blue skies engulfed him completely, and he was filled with an overwhelming comfort, unable to help himself from letting out a boisterous victory yell. He burst into elated laughter, almost disbelieving, and he swooped down towards the trees surrounding Pyra, the wind whistling through the new metal. Tony was almost childlike as he flew, his eyes alight with joy behind the mask.
about the suit powering up, and it hummed to life, heat radiating off of the metal beneath his fingers. Now all that was left was finishing touches, and to see if it
He waited for her to say more, but she stayed perched at the foot of the bed, looking back at him. She finally readjusted, turning her body and pulling one leg up onto the bed so that she could face him. “I know that you’re technically an Olympian, so you know who we are, the stories that the mortals tell. But you haven’t been on Olympus for a long time.”
Rhodey was still seated at Fury’s left side, and he wasn’t looking at Steve,  but Steve saw the god’s mouth twitch upward for the briefest of moments. He imagined that no one ever got to speak Fury the way they
“I’ve got to keep working, but you untangle those.” Peter nodded once, and opted to stay where he was, rather than going back to sit down at the workbench. Tony continued to watch his work, his brow furrowed intently, but he knew that Peter was there. And Peter knew, somehow, that he was still listening.
“Tell me about you mom, Peter,” Tony said, and he could hear a tenderness in his words that was uncharacteristic of him.
“What is that?” he demanded, pointing an accusing finger at Tony, who was still recovering from their landing. He was seated against the opposite wall, one leg bent at the knee and the other one sprawled out carelessly. The suit had powered down in their descent, finally giving out, and Tony raised his head to pry the mask off of his face with his hands.
Tony sat back down on the bed after successfully discarding the rest of the scratched metal of the suit. “There’s Steve, right?” he asked, and his voice carried just a hint of yearning—Rhodey knew that voice. He recognized the wistfulness there.
Although Tony was dangerously keen on testing Nick Fury’s authority, Tony knew that if he were to fight him, he would have to go up against him alone.
Fury cocked his head to the side as he watched Steve. “Tell us the whole story. You’ve been in collusion with one of the biggest threats to Olympus. It doesn’t look good for you, Steve Rogers.”
Tony sighed, leaning forward to meet Peter’s gaze. “Hey, Pete.” He reached out and knocked the boy’s knee playfully. “Doesn’t matter where he is now. Or maybe it does, who knows? But for
Tony sucked in a breath, unsurprised that he was the other gods’ object of torment both on and off the Mountain. “Well, thanks for putting my guy out of his misery,” he said smoothly, but Steve looked up at him, not missing the catch in his voice.
“Yeah, I don’t know how I feel about this place yet,” Steve said, and he shook his head as he spoke, a visible portrayal of the exasperation that he felt. If he felt vexation towards anyone in particular, it was with Fury, but mostly Steve was just annoyed with the whole place. Between the way that all of the Olympians tiptoed around Fury, the constant tension on the mountain, and Steve feeling like he had to constantly look over his shoulder, he wished more than anything that things could go back to way they were in Athens. But all he could do now was make the best of this new situation.
Happy nodded. "Yeah, I think that might help." He turned to a corner and stopped. "Is this it?" He looked at the almost abandoned building but with few light on.
"Seriously? You're literally doing all of this and yet you won't tell me what is going on? You are not making my worry reduced."
“Wait, what?! God, I knew this would happen. Clint, how did it happened? It's exhaustion again isn’t it?”
Natasha laughed a little. "Alright, alright, I'm sorry. That was out of bounds." She said as she puts her hand in the air.
"Yeah,..until you get so star-struck by a picture of him. Yeah, I can't trust you with him alone. Who knows what you will do to that poor thing." Nat said firmly.
"Nat, I tried. He is very persistent as you can see. And you know him...he doesn't like it when he does not get what he wants." He whispers.
"Hey, hey I go both ways. You should really get to know him. He is so polite and seems to be a bit naive which makes him even cuter. He is actually a bit of a mother hen too which is expected considering he is an Omega. Gosh he is adorable. Just want to mount him-"
"Actually, they're probably still here. Cause if they want to leave Manhattan, it's kind of impossible not to be caught on camera especially when you have to go through the bridges to get off the island."
"Trust me, I'm sure he can handle it better than anyone. He's an Omega too, he can provide comfort better. Omegas are calmer among each other. Give them time."
Happy laughed a little. “Like how you couldn’t stop looking at his picture profile with fondness when you found it, acting like an idiot Prince Charming when you met him and even asking him to marry you. Damn, the latter really takes the cake.”
“Don’t forget that he is 100% involved for tonight’s dinner which he never does when he meets anyone."
"Alphas." His uttered the word in disgust as if the Alpha's existence himself was such a disgrace. Steve wanted to say something until he spotted Peter who was trying to look for him. He immediately dashed towards Peter leaving the Alpha behind.
As if the Heavens heard him, the elevator opened and revealed Happy, Sam and Peggy. The two best friends looked relief and happy when they saw Steve but immediately frowned when they could scent the smell of distress from Steve.
He had a couple of missed calls from Rhodey, who had eventually given up trying to call and left a text that said
Steve knew that Rhodey would take care of Tony once he’d gotten to Pyra, but Steve couldn’t help the ripple of anxiousness that rolled through his body. He wanted so badly to be on the way to the volcano with his newfound ally, but Steve knew that the god was right. For both of them to leave would only cause more trouble. And the last thing they needed was more trouble.
“Come here, kid,” he told him, and Peter glanced up from where he sat on the workbench. Tony waved him closer to the armor, and Peter obeyed, standing so that he could see what the god was fiddling with in the chest piece. Tony had taken the metal off, and he raised the wiring that was in his hands, motioning for Peter to grab them. He hand been tinkering carelessly while he was listening to the boy’s story, more focused on Peter’s words, and the multicolored wires suffered greatly because of it. Peter took the tangled mess of wires from Tony, and he tugged at them without thinking.
hi guys! it's been a long semester, but we're back! i've got time today babies let's have some greek mythology.
The boy looked at Tony, and looked away just as quickly. “Sorry,” he muttered, still gripping the necklace in his hand. “Sorry. I just—I don’t have her anymore. I don’t have anyone.”
He had to give it to Clint though, the guy was not backing down. He sped up a little bit, turning to block Steve’s path with his body. Steve stopped short of walking straight into Clint’s chest, and Clint raised his bow. Steve’s body stiffened instinctively, his hand twitching at his side, barely resisting the urge to reach up and snap the bow in half. Clint moved fast enough that Steve almost missed him loading his arrow, but before he knew it, Clint had fired the arrow over Steve’s shoulder. The arrow lodged itself in one of the many busts of the gods that lined the walkway that they had taken. He turned his head a fraction of an inch to look at Clint’s target, and he noticed that this statue was particularly damaged, and he presumed it was common for Clint to practice his archery outside of a shooting range. He could also guess that he was looking at the head of Tony Stark, the only statue that Fury would allow to be marred in such a manner.
With his message, Steve sent another picture. This time minus the underwear that were barely there to begin with. Tony groaned to himself and threw his head back on the couch. He put his feet on the floor in front of him and spread his legs wider than necessary, palming himself over his boxers. He snapped another picture of his hand around his bulge, this time making absolutely sure it was at an angle that flattered his size before he sent it.
"I h-hate you.." Steve pants. His body felt as if he was on fire, craving the Alpha's sensual touches, making his mind in a haze.
Hope you guys are staying safe. Did not upload in awhile due to all the assignments. But I am trying!
“Yeah, everything is here.” He placed a huge hard treasure box on the floor of his office and went out.
It seems Happy was the only one who notice the change in Steve’s behaviour. Steve’s eyes seem to be trying to open up but couldn’t as it kept fluttering and his body is becoming weak in Bucky’s hold.
Steve was silent for quite a while until he spoke again. “You don’t get it Sam. You don’t know what it’s like when you’re always told that you can’t do this and that. Alphas eyeing you like a piece of meat. I hate it.” A tear rolled down Steve’s cheek which Sam wiped it off gently with his thumb.
The Alpha starts to feel a little calm. "I really need to see him Happy. I can't control it, my body is screaming to go after him.."
“Well, we do need your help to find Steve since Peter said you guys are the best shot we have now.” Wanda said softly and motioned at Peter.
Steve blushed and Natasha just laughs. "You deserve to be here Steve. Even Mr. Stark himself loves it."
Peggy smirked at Clint as she continued to play with her knife. "To be precise, I'm going to kill 2 assholes."
Wanda hold Steve’s hand. “He’s right Steve. At this point, I don’t think I can sleep knowing that you’re practically in danger everyday.”
Happy shook his head and sighed. "Isn't that enough to tell you that he does not want to be followed?"
"Well, you tell JARVIS that. I think the red hair girl is smart, it seems like she knows every camera spot." Happy sighed.
Tony sighed and sat back down again. He is just praying that his Omega will be alright. His phone suddenly rang and picked up the call.
Steve blushed and Bucky smirked at that. He always knew how to make him go red in embarrassment. Sam just looked pissed and Wanda was just trying to figure out who this man was to Steve.
The blonde gave a small chuckle. "Nat, if you keep doing that people are gonna think that you are flirting with me."
Steve's face was flushed with embarrassment. He doesn't know why he kept reacting towards Bucky like this.
"Welcome. I mean, you guys are practically married anyway. You guys have been literally acting like one." Sam shrugged.
"I really think we should make some sort of special stage for him to showcase his paintings. I know it'll hype up the event and buyers, onlookers and even viewers watching television would appreciate art. Our goal for the exhibition for the art gallery will be a huge success!"
“Steve..you’re so beautiful. You are an Angel, meant for me.” He caressed Steve’s cheek with his thumb.
"Yeah, he's cool with it. Plus, you can describe that Alpha to him personally. I'm sure he'll be able to help."
Steve nodded in understanding as he was looking around. “That’s pretty nice actually.” It was. He never knew he would take Tony as a sentimental type, not saying that he judges a book from its cover. It’s just really refreshing to see an Alpha being a little vulnerable and maybe a little sensitive about something simple.
Sam went in front of Steve to protect him. “I don’t know you but I know damn well that Steve does not like you.”
"Oh God, why am I wasting my breath on you! Get JARVIS to hack into anything! CCTV, system or whatever! Call our people to search the area, find any witness. Have Pepper standby at his apartment just in case he  would come back."
"Well, he is dangerous and slick. Might be an advantage if there's someone who knows his internal operation." Happy said and even Pepper nodded in agreement.
"Sshh it's okay sweetheart. You'll be okay." Steve soothes Peter's hair as he whispered more sweet words to calm him down.
Tony was just staring at his beautiful Omega whose name he found out was Steve. Adorable. He couldn't believe it, it's like fate is giving him the best gift ever. "My uhm...body just reacted so strongly to your scent...you just smell so.." He closed his eyes and inhaled the Omega's warm sweet scent and opened his eyes. "wonderful..."
Bucky closed his eyes to calm himself down. God, he was only just seconds away from ripping the Alpha’s throat and the universe just had to ruin his chance.
"Whatever it is. Barnes wants you dead. Better walk away while I'm being nice. I have had enough of blood on my hands. You do know that when you do this, he will go on a spring killing on the rest of us."
Steve was totally pissed after hearing that. How can someone so young go through all that? But then again, he experienced that same thing when he was Peter's age and worse.
“Peggy! He’s saying the truth. He didn’t do anything. He was just showing me around his collection.” Steve was holding her hand to calm her down.
Natasha shrugged. "Yeah. I thought it was like any other mission but getting to know you was like a breath of fresh air. It felt like I was having a normal life, I get to meet really cool and genuine people through your circle of friends. Felt nice to be normal."
Sam immediately hugs him followed by Peggy. "Steve come on. You know us..We'll be with you even when you don't need anyone." Steve laughs at that.
The Alpha spins the Omega around so that they were facing each other while still tightly wrapping his arms around waist.
“Steve!” The moment Sam opened the door, he could sense a distressed Omega. Sam ran to his side and holds his hand. “Steve! It’s me, Sam.” He squeezes his hand tightly.
Steve heard a knock and was curious to who was at the door. He switched off his TV and figured it was either Sam, Wanda or Nat. He opened to see the last person he wanted to see.
Bucky leaned into Steve's ear and smirked. "Of course I'm going to come back. Stevie is enough to drive my motivation to come back home alive. Getting married and building a family with Steve is my dream. Hell no I'm letting death get in my way." Bucky bit his earlobe and placed a wet kisses below the ear. Steve whimpers as he blushes even harder.
"Then hack into the every street surveillance around it! Make sure to catch wherever he goes so I can know the direction." He was annoyed by now.
Pietro shrugged. "I mean I don't think he calls himself that way but a lot of people do. Look let's just focus on finding Steve and Nat."
"About just now, do you remember what that Alpha looked like? Cause if you do you can describe it to Happy so he can report it to Mr Stark, you know the CEO, to ensure and tighten the security around the Stark Tower perimeter. I mean we can't let something dangerous like that happen again roaming around here."
"Oh right!" Steve quickly followed him like a cute little puppy which Happy thought it was really cute. 'No wonder Pepper was so smitten with this guy.'
That caught Tony's attention and immediately looks up from  his tablet. "Stevie? Shy?" He unconsciously growled at the red head since she sounded close to the Omega. Cause really, she's more of a female Alpha than a Beta. That's why Alphas tend to be wary of her. "How do you-"
"I..have a proposition." Steve bit his lip. He didn't know why he would offer this but he had no choice.
"I got over board with my emotions just now. I shouldn't have shouted and let my emotions get to me. I was just too overwhelmed that I could not think straight."
"Relax, I think I might know which. I remember he asked one of his people to create this...room. I'm sure it's one of those high security rooms."
Steve just could not control his blushing face; he knew he was red all over and he knew that the Alpha notices it too judging by the glint in his eyes.
Steve nodded and thanked Pepper as he got out of the car. He sighed as he walked into his apartment until he was bombarded by two angry protective friends.
But of course he could not change back time. He sighs in content as he smiles. "Yeah...I've always wanted to go to the Empire State building."
"Nice to see you again Steve." She winked and Steve blushed. Steve does not know why she keeps making him blush, probably because she just oozes out confidence everywhere.
“I just wanna say that Steve will be mine and I will not back down.” Of course, Tony just had to start a war. Happy sighed in exhaustion. It’s gonna be along night for him.
"Guys, come on my cousin just texted me." Sam rests his hand on Steve's shoulder. Steve looks up at all buildings and skyscrapers, smiling.
"Things under the government will never be right. Too much corruption." Natasha shrugged. "You know, Wanda...kinda has this idea."
It's not like Bucky was surprised anyway. His Omega has always been a brave soul that would always be a hero to anyone in need. Always defending the underdogs.
“Girl, you tell me. My boss is always crazy and an idiot sometimes but this…is not really him or at least not that I know of.” Natasha said.
"Actually, that's true." Wade smugly said as Barnes and Rumlow gave a look. "Okay, fine so I messed up this one."
"Y-You live here?" Steve looked out the window where he saw a giant fountain  in front of the mansion.
"Cool. You haven't met Mr. Stark yet right? You want to meet him? I can bring you instead of Happy." He smiles, excitedly.
"That's the thing, I think we should do more than just putting him among the other artist. We should create a stage solely for-"
Tony sighs after he drank the scotch. He landed on the couch and combs through his hair frustrated. “You’re going to think I’m stupid and crazy.”
why hello! so sorry you had to wait so long! Assignments and with the Covid-19 outbreak and all. Please stay safe everyone. Since we're in lock down I might be able to update frequently i hope.
“You know, you should be grateful that I’m not ripping your head off right now.” The Alpha with the long hair growled.
Bucky growled. "Steve I don't think I have anymore patience if you're going to keep teasing. Keep doing this and I swear I won't be gentle-"
A young boy suddenly jumped in front of them which caused Happy to cursed a little. "Hey Happy! I just finished the task and sent it to your email. Oh you must be Steve Rogers! Hi I'm Peter Parker the intern here! You can just call me Peter!"
"Bucky stop.." Steve shyly squirmed in his seat as he tries to unlatch Bucky from his side but the latter was practically glued to him.
"I brought him with me actually. Come on, Steve." Peter motioned Steve behind the door to get inside.
"And by the way, when I met him though...He is one gorgeous man." She sighed dreamily as she twirls the pen between her fingers.
Steve looked weirdly at Wanda and went to the living room. He looked at his reflection until he saw a reddish pink mark at the side of his neck near his ear. “No…”
"Seriously..is everyone having smoke bomb with them now...." Happy managed to take his flashlight and light the way through the smoke.
Pietro rolled his eyes and followed behind Nat. They were in some dark fancy hallway and thankfully no one was around. But he was sure there was security somewhere. "Nat, you sure no one's on guard?"
A beautiful woman came strutting in like she owns the place. "Because first, it his right and second I got this alright. Plus, i pity the omega. All he wants is to prove that he is more than just his Biology. I mean you did warn me about his stubbornness a year ago. Once he made his mind he-"
"For the second time, it was an accident. So lucky you, you're free again." He did some sarcastic movement with his hands which Peter glared.
“Don’t be like that doll.” He smirks, fingers thrusting in and out that white cums starts to ooze out. The Omega starts to feel hot and heavy. His body feels warm and aching.
The only reason his mother brought him to New York is due to some issues she had to settle and she did not trust anyone with Steve. She was a protective mother. So they never exactly explore the city.
She could tell by Steve's facial expression that he was hesitant of going with her but slowly nodded. Natasha sighed in relief and both quickly went in the cab. She told the driver her address and pushed off.
Pietro blinked. Now it made sense. He didn't really thought much when Nat said it was Stevie. Stevie could have been Steve as in Steve Rogers. He is the Omega that Barnes was searching for. And that meant danger.
Peter ran out of the cab but stumbled down as soon as he was only running a few steps on the pavement. “Ugh.” He groaned, massaging his legs.
“Really?” Tony asked almost hopeful as he stared at Steve who was looking around the machines and gadgets, intrigued.
Steve looked at it and gulped. Even after all these years, he could never get how big Bucky is and the fact that it could fit in him.
Tony's eyes darken. His inner Alpha growled at such a vulnerable opening from the Omega. “Be my Omega then.”
"Peter, let's go. This park is dangerous of hormonal Alphas." Steve grabbed his wrist and quickly pulled him away from the scene.
Bucky looked at him, stoic. “He’s my mate.” Tony scoffed at that and it was evident in Peter’s eyes that he was shocked.
That triggered the dangerous side of the Alpha. He growled and his eyes darken at the rude Beta. "Asshole?...I gave you a job and I'm the asshole? Keep in mind that you are my assistant and a Beta at that."
“What happened?” Tony asked, hating the fact that the Alpha had a long history with the beautiful blonde, Steve Rogers.
They both quietly sneak in the mansion and tried to blend into the dark hallway. "I think Barnes hides him underground." She whispers.
“Tony its fine. I won’t lie it was shocking since we just met and all. I’m pretty sure you’re just that type to run it’s mouth even when you don’t mean too.” He said politely.
He gulps as he was met with the steel grey blue eyes from a distance. If it was possible he could see how those eyes shine in adoration as he saw him and smiles adoringly (which Steve will never admit it made his heart beats faster) when Steve gets nearer.
Steve just didn’t know how to react. Part of him despise the situation he is in but yet he felt grateful for what the Alpha has done.
"Okay, Steve around the tower. We still couldn't cover all since a lot needs to be done. I mean I still haven't introduced Steve to of course the CEO of Stark Industries himself. But I'm sure you know him."
But it was because of Steve, she feels a sense of calm and belonging. When she meets Steve and his circle of friends, she felt like a normal person.
“What? Why?” Natasha then saw Tony’s panic look behind Steve and glared at him. “What did you do Tony?” Natasha growled.
“I should say the same. Seriously, what are you doing here?” Steve pulled away and looked at her. “Did Sam..”
HEYYY I'M BACK! Sorry, it's a lil' late! Oh and plz do give me ur feedbacks I love hearing your ideas honestly!
Bucky bit Steve's earlobe, making Steve whined. "You don't to hide your moans for me doll face." He whispers hoarsely as he licked the back of his ears to tease.
Steve really doesn’t know what to do but just oblige to him and he really does not know why. He was not the type to follow orders especially from Alphas what more let them touch him more than once like that, even if it’s just simply polite gestures. Except from one. He really wished Bucky was here with him but of course he pushed the feelings aside.
"Hmm well I guess I could let her off with a little warning." Bucky won't deny that he just wants to pull a trigger into Nat's head or at least let his men teach her a lesson. He doesn't deal with betrayal that well.
"Yeah..but still it does not make sense. Despite of what he did to me, I know Bucky is a good guy..he shouldn't be doing this."
“What’s wrong?” Sam said, sticking to his side while rubbing his back. He heard a growl behind him. He turned around to see Tony Stark, glaring daggers at him. If looks could kill, he would’ve been dead.
Steve rolled his eyes at them as he was pouring the gravy all over the chicken. He sighs in satisfaction with the table set up and stared at his left hand, smiling. The dazzling beautiful stone shining.
"Hngh! Ah! Bucky!" Steve rolled his eyes as Bucky started to suck so hard under his jaw. "Stop..." he whimpered.
"Stark." The man scoffed. "That son of a bitch. First my weapons, now my omega? When did you find out?"
Steve looked at Natasha confused and surprised. "Nat? H-How?" He then looked at Bucky and back to Natasha. "How do you two know each other?"
And thank you for the rest of you for waiting for this update. You guys are just the best that I just want to cry. I know most of you guys were waiting for Mine All along to update for a long time and I am so sorry. This particular story has a heavy vibe so I needed time to think and with assignments just piling, it’s almost impossible to find time.
"Absolutely not." Steve pushed his arm so that he could get out of his hold but Tony grabbed his waist tightly.
“That’s exactly what you and basically the whole society meant. You think Omegas are weak and fragile.”
Steve smiled. “It’s okay Peter, I’m fine. I can take care of myself. I really do appreciate though.”
"Have you not seen your boss' true colours yet? Don't you know what he did to Steve? If we ask for his help, I know he will take advantage of it one way or another and he will take Steve."
“Hospital? I’m actually in a hurry to go there too! I’m visiting a friend. He fainted. He was admitted just a few hours ago.”
"You will promise to not harm Nat right?" His voice was soft and slow to try and not anger the Alpha.
"Hey, we need to stock up things a bit for Manhattan, that city ain't cheap. It's a good thing my cousin has a good and cheap place for us to crash. Though it'll be a bit cramped since it's a studio apartment."
"Saves time and oh God! Come on guys do this in the bedroom!" He motioned his fingers at Bucky and Steve.
“Same here sis.” Pietro gave a tight squeeze before letting her go. Steve and Sam always find the twins so adorable.
“I hire you to be my P.A. You know what that is right? Personal Assistant. To assist! To just do what I tell you!”
“And as much as I would love to help you track down those assholes, let him rest for a while alright.”
“At first no. I just thought that he was going through some new changes as an Alpha. Then, one night, it verified my doubts. H-He really did try to claim me…forcefully.”
"Hey, don't be. You'll be great." She then turned to look at Sam. "Oh, I don't think we've met. I'm Nat." She throws her hand out to shake.
Bucky inhaled the sweet scent of Steve by his jaw and buried is nose into the satisfying scent. He gave out a strong pheromone of a satisfied Alpha. “Hmm..”
Ah yes i'm back. If ur wondering bout Peter dun worry. u guys will see him soon. I miss him too hehe.
"I know right! I'm pretty sure he will get his way out even if we report him. He harassed Steve on his first day of working there."
Bucky tugged the chained collar around his neck little which made Steve whined. "That's not what you say to your Alpha doll." He growled behind his neck
Steve took a deep breath and smiles to himself. He is going to enjoy this trip in the Big Apple with his closest friends. Though he wished he could share this adventure with his mother and Bucky...he knows they want him to be happy and move on with life. He will do this for them too.
"Whoever the hell that woman is could be dangerous. She works with Barnes! Steve probably doesn't know the danger he is in."
Pietro stopped walking. "Exactly." He quickly threw a smoke bomb at the side and dashed for the exit.
“I understand but trust me! He is not like that. Okay fine, he can be reckless and an idiot sometimes. But, he was never like this. In fact, no Omega has ever caught his eyes until…you came along.” Happy smiled a little at Steve. “Kind of like his first love I should say.”
"Look let's drop it for now. I'll tell you later. Where's Steve? Is he alone at his apartment now?" He asked concerned.
Peter waved in front of Sam and Wanda to look at him. "Look! That's not important! Right now, since the Mafia guy spared me cause Steve told him not to hurt me, in exchange for this terrible mercenary guy who kidnapped me, to keep an eye on me to not tell Stark or basically anyone." Peter was already out of breath at this rate.
"Of course it's Mr. Stark! He can do everything and anything. He is he coolest Alpha I've ever met. He never treats me differently which is so cool. Not saying that he is different than most Alphas, I mean he is still obnoxious and self-centered but I think he has a big heart. A lot of rumours always say that he was this evil guy making weapons or whatever and some heartless playboy but I don't really think so. Or at least to me." He shrugged. "He just wants people to follow his way but overall cool. I guess."
Tony wanted to stop the Omega the moment he sprint, he definitely will not let his omega go especially without knowing his name- so that he could hire someone to search for him even if he did run away, until he found a familiar face from his work. The chirpy Peter Parker. He felt relieved knowing that he can found out about his omega from the boy. He wondered how they both knew each other.
"It's just that...I wish my mom and Bucky would be here with us right now. Mom said she always wanted to bring me to watch the theater. Bucky..promised that he'll bring me to the Empire States building to watch the skyline view."
“But if you really do need some company or a Netflix buddy, I’ll come straight to you! Here’s my number.” He took a pen and paper on the table wrote down the numbers.
Sam and Wanda looked at him worriedly. They now knew the real reason why Steve hates Alphas. Wanda hugged Steve to comfort him.
Steve felt a little relief at that. Maybe he was overthinking. Being in a big city and noticed by a giant company in the United States and all.
"Look. Honestly, I can't tell you but since I don't trust Stark with Steve and you seem like a good friend of Steve. Well, he kinda ran away from the club when Tony and Barnes suddenly showed up."
Steve gasped and shook his head furiously. “Bucky please!” He tries to sit up properly but Bucky pins his arms back down. The Alpha’s eyes were dark and almost sadistic. Steve is desperate to find the Bucky he always loves in those eyes. “Bucky, please…”
“I just want to apologize on behalf of Tony especially for what he did. And basically, what you’re going through today.”
"What? No way, Mr. Barnes is one of the most nicest man I know. And he is a successful businessman that our community looks up to him. He helped my family a lot of times..especially me." He looked down in guilt at his lap, remembering all the times the man helped Steve when he was alone.
Bucky sighed. "Honestly, I'm scared the longer I wait, the higher of chance that I might take you right here but I don't want anyone to see what's mine." He also looked at the men around him who just stared at both of them deadpanned.
"It's my life. I can live however and wherever I want. Plus, I can tell my landlord about this. He will ban you from this very building."
Natasha looked at Tony pissed, for making the Omega uncomfortable with his unpleasant pheromone that was starting to rise in the room.
"Look kid what do you want me to do?!" Wade exclaimed tiredly as they were in a car drove by one of Bucky's men, to send them back.
Bucky smirked in between kisses. "Your body says otherwise." He continued to the other side of his neck and tug his shirt a little until he froze.
"You know Mr. and Mrs. Barnes are coming back from their business trip next week . They want to discuss about the wedding. Mrs. Barnes especially wants to take me out to find the perfect suit and bridal thing or something. Since you're my maid of honour, can you come with me and help me out?"
"Wait! I can pay...for you..." Before he could finish Peter had dashed into the building. 'Guess I'll wait on the bench then.'
"Nat!" They run towards each other and hugged. They both let go of each other and Nat looked at Steve, smiling.
“At first. Not gonna lie it took a few guards, nurses and doctors to pull them away from the door. I think they should be at least patiently waiting outside.”
“Please Sam. Don’t go there. You’re going to get hurt.” A well-known fact in the society that Alphas are always and will always be on top and there is no stopping them to win. Alphas have the upper hand in terms of strength and no one could overpower them. Usually death was at the end of the rope if it turns brutal. “It’s all my fault.”
Natasha and Happy looked shocked and turned to Tony. “You never let anyone near that room.” Happy said.
She sighed as she wondered how Steve would react if he ever found out about the truth. He would be devastated to know that the only reason she befriended him in the first place is because of the cruel James 'Buchanan' Barnes. Her heart would shatter if that really happens.
The Alpha in the room did not seem to be pleased that someone has stolen the Omega’s attention. He cleared his throat which made the rest focus on him again. Steve felt uncomfortable with the sudden change of mood from the Alpha. Why did he seem a little upset? He did notice that he was unconsciously cowering beside him.
Peter glared at him. "Look, I'm getting there. So, since you're his friends which thank God you're here! I want you to help me find Steve!"
He found Natasha's phone on the table and decided to just call from hers. She might have one of their numbers since they're now friends. "Nat I'm gonna use your phone to call Sam or Wanda!" He tapped the screen but it was black so he tried to switch it on and it did. He waited a few seconds to let it reset. But there were millions of notifications that her phone kept vibrating with messages and missed calls. Most of them were named Rumlow which made Steve curious since there were like hundreds of them. He unconsciously scanned the whole list until his eyes dropped on a single name.
Pietro followed inside and laughed when he saw his twin already running at him. Wanda jumped on Pietro to hug him. “Oh my God I missed you!”
Natasha shrugged a little. "Depends. When you're in the real field, at the beginning you wouldn't know, the leader would just simply pass down and assigned the mission to the rest of us. Then, when you're experienced the person who wants to hire us can just contact you directly. Usually, the targets are all douche bags. It happens in the underground business."
Steve shivers. The voice became even rich and deeper when the Alpha speaks in his mother tongue. The deep accent was doing something to Steve. “B-Bucky…”
"Mmmph! Ngh! Mmph!" Steve tried to shook his head around and even push him off but Bucky's hold on each of his wrist were so hard he was losing stamina.
"U-Uhm Steve...I know you don't feel like it now but, you can tell me anything. Like what happened...just now..." He nervously scratched the back of his neck.
“Shh come on, don’t cry. I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have said all of that. I-I’m just really worried that you’re going to overwork and stress yourself out again.” Sam hugged Steve who sobbed a little in his shoulder.
"This is my territory Stark." He said as he wrapped his arms around Steve tightly while Steve struggled around his hold.
"I-I know, but i saw this ad that they are in desperate need of someone in their management department. Plus, the money is great which i could use to pay off my student loans."
“No, I’m the one who should. Please, let me make it up to you. I’m so sorry. I know it really surprised you.”
Sam quickly finds a solution. “Well, I mean considering the fact that you had a weird encounter with Stark when we found you with him. You were distressed.”
"Stevie I told you that when you talk to me, you look at me in the eyes." Bucky tilted his chin up so that Steve is looking at him. "Now tell me what this special gift is?" He said eagerly.
“Do explain why Steve Rogers is in your dirty paws?” Tony may look calm, but if one took a look closer, he is twitching all around, waiting to save his Omega from his enemy. He is furious and jealous that Steve is in another Alpha’s touch that he just wants to rip that hands off and kill the Alpha Mafia on sight.
The Alphas did not even think for a second as they both went to their respective cars and followed the car.
"Steve freaking Rogers, when I find you, you better pay all my medical bills for giving me a heart attack." Natasha muttered as she ran.
"Well, it's good that it is only admiration. Cause you won't be here if it was more than that." Bucky clicked his tongue.
Both looked at each other intensely. Steve was just really confused on how both Alphas that he hated knew each other.
“Tony, I beg of you please do not start a fight in a hospital.” Sam looked at the Beta who sighed next to the Alpha who said his name. How in the world does he know him?
“I made pancakes with banana and mango puree. I want to show my gratitude for yesterday. You paid my medical expenses which I could never thank enough-“
Happy cleared his throat. “All right, I think we can agree that Steve needs to go home and rest. Steve do you want me to take you home?”
“No, I hated it. I do not want to belong to anybody. Whatever you’re doing…this…courting or whatever this is has to stop.”
"No, no, I'm more than willing to help Steve. I'm just surprise that he even agreed to this..knowing him...you know...very independent." Thor said nervously which caused Sam to raise a brow at him.
Tony purred at the touch. “Don’t you think I would be making that call?” He raised a brow as he hugged his waist tighter.
“Don’t fucking talk to me like that.” Tony was suddenly in rage. He is not like this really but his Alpha instinct is showing up since he met Steve. Why is everyone stopping him from talking to his Omega?
"I am not and will never be your-" Steve was silenced with Bucky's lips on his, massaging his way into his mouth.
Steve looked like he was going to cry. Why is this happening to him? Why is Bucky here? How did he find him? Why is Stark following him? Why can’t Alphas just leave him alone? He didn’t notice that a tear fell down his cheek until Happy wiped it off with a tissue.
The rest looked at Tony since he has been with him the whole time. Peggy went to Tony, angrily huffed. “What did you do to him?”
“Correct. Now may I ask, what intentions do you have with Steve?” The Alpha looked at him seriously.
Those fair milky skin that was asking to be bitten and bruised especially that smooth unmarked neck. That well toned and fit body will feel so good against his body. And that smell...warm cinnamon roll and sweet vanilla that made him intoxicated in such a good way. Something in his body tingled with a burning sensation. It then struck him. He is the one.
"Peter, verbally or physically, no Omegas should ever go through that. Ever." He looked at him intensely.
Steve looked at him almost wanting to obey the Alpha but Sam motioned Steve away from the scene with Wanda following behind.
“Well, he did help me out one time during an event. He was nice but that’s about it.” Steve smiled a little.
Steve unconsciously moaned into the kiss as Bucky tightened his hold around his Omega. He then continues to leave trail of kisses around the corner of his mouth to his jaw and neck.
Steve slowly shook his head. “B-Bucky, please you’re not thinking straight. Please calm down.” He cups Bucky’s face. “Bucky, please. Let’s sit down and talk.”
Both Alphas didn’t want to move an inch. They wanted to sit here and wait for their Omega to wake up.
“Okay, Tony what the hell just happen?” Natasha storms in the office after they send them off at the entrance.
Peter lets go of the hug. "Thanks Steve. I am really glad that you're an Omega when I first saw you." He blushed.
Tony smiles. “Come, I would like to show you something.” Tony slides his hand around Steve’s waist. Before Steve could say anything, too stunned that he was being ushered or maybe being dragged to an elevator by basically the one of the most influential Alpha in America to date.
“Steve! Wait! Please! I’m sorry!” Tony was running after the frightened Omega who was dashing towards the elevator. He could smell sadness and a slight fear from the Omega which made the Alpha felt disappointed of himself. Tony speeds up and catches up, grabbing his elbow to stop him. Turns out to be a bad idea since the Omega turned around and yanks it away.
Peggy nodded. "Well, it's your choice. But have to warn you, you're stuck with me and Sam for the rest of your life and we will be very enthusiastic about it."
It kind of startled Peter. "O-Oh uhmm.." He said as he was trying to concentrate while on the screen while answering him. "Well, been doing this since I was a kid I guess...Been into coding and programming ever since my late parents bought me my first computer. Curious with how it works and all. Wait why do you wanna know? And why am I telling you this?" Peter shook his head and continues to work on the codes.
“You’re in luck. They’re just best friends. Plus, he’s a Beta. Got nothing to worry about.” Brock shrugged.
Steve blinks in confusion but was still shocked and nervous that even the rest could smell it. He did not know what to do but blush and looks down.
"You know nothing being an Alpha! I can't help myself for always being controlling, dominating and even territorial." He looked at the spot his Omega stood. He walked towards the door until Happy blocked his way.
Steve bit his lips and looked like he wanted to cry. "I'm sorry you had to go through all that becau-"
"Hold on, I think I can try to locate details about any mansion an hour from here. I know a bit of programming and hacking. Do you have a laptop?"
He sighed again. Damn it, he would not stand not knowing his precious Omega’s wellbeing right this very second. He pulled out his phone and went to speed dial.
"Yeah, since we save time and money on place and things, we can spend more on checking out the city."
Bucky stopped but continued slowly. "I'm gonna guess Romanoff told you everything about my line of work?"
"This again? Steve, come on this is your big moment! You should use this time to explore Manhattan. It's a big city!"
“Long story. To put it simply, this guy apparently was supposed to kidnap Steve but accidentally kidnapped me by mistake and Steve negotiated with that scary Mafia to let me go!” Peter’s hands were everywhere as he motions around to explain it.
“Steve! Where the hell have you been?” Sam looked at him pissed. “You’re supposed to take a day off today.”
Steve looked around the office and sighed in relief, after finishing the work. Quickly packing his stuff, he immediately walked towards the elevator. While waiting he just stared on the floor.
"Will you stop being a pussy! It's not like we haven't done something like this." She looked at him pissed.
"Oh yes! We're talking!" She said a bit too sternly that it surprised Steve a little. Peggy bits her lip trying to hold her tears. "Steve I know...I know you are hurting so bad. You're numb. I know you feel empty and probably dead inside like half of your heart is not functioning. I probably would not know how you feel-"
“No, no. You don’t have to say sorry. It’s not your fault. The fact that you’re trying your best to help me is enough.” Steve smiled a little.
"Come on." Bucky got out of the car and helped Steve out. He snakes his hand around his waist and grips on it so tightly to make sure Steve stops trying to unlatch him like he was doing now.
“Oh God, Peter I’m so glad you’re okay. And you, I will deal with you later.” Pepper glared at Wade who in response rolled his eyes.
"Are you telling me not one surveillance camera caught a sight of them after the club area? It's the Big Apple! How is it possible that they're not caught on camera!"
Bucky growled and pulled Steve closer to him that Steve had to hold onto Bucky's shoulder. "God I know baby. But I just can't live with the thought of you being surrounded by hungry Alphas when I'm in the army."
Natasha saw Steve strutting towards her but realized he was going for the elevator. Confused and curious, she immediately stopped him as she grabbed his wrist. “Steve, hey, hey, what’s wrong?”
"Honestly, I think it'll be better if I tell you bit by bit. I don't want to shock you more. I promise I'll tell more in the future."
Bucky shook his head of the memory and stared intensely at a picture of Steve. "I'll claim you without fail my sweet Steve...."
“Sam Wilson. A year older than Steve. Went to the same university at Stanford. Met at club activities a lot. I made a few researches and it seems like they’re always glued together. Natasha probably didn’t notice him since he graduated first and that’s when you found him and asked Natasha to spy on him.”
“Well, it’s okay if you don’t feel like it right now. I’m not going to force you. You don’t have to see him today alright? I’ll tell him when you’re ready. I just hope that you would promise me to see him.” Happy smiled.
Steve pushed him away quickly. “No! The flowers are still here cause it would be a waste if I just throw it out.” He looked away shyly.
"Peggy, what the hell?! Get that knife away woman! You're gonna kill someone with that!" The rest was quite surprised since they did not notice how Peggy has been holding a knife in her hand all this while.
“Sam!” Wanda stopped Sam before he was going to march out of the apartment. “Wait! Let’s think it through.” She was grabbing his tense shoulder in hopes to calm him down.
"Well look who decided to finally answer. That was quite the stunt you pulled Romanoff. Now tell me where Steve-"
"T-That actually sounds nice. But I have never really show anyone my paintings except for my mom, you guys and...Bucky." Steve started to look gloomy again but Peggy would not have that.
Sam was wide eyes as he sniffed as well. He was probably too mad just now that he didn’t smell what currently smelled like an Alpha scented an Omega. “Who did this?” He growled.
Happy rolled his eyes while still focusing on the road. "Look, even JARVIS is still searching for it. We're really doing our best. Pepper is going back at the tower to do more searching."
And Steve was sure he heard the name correctly which caused him another headache due to heavy confusion.
"Take care on your way home guys!" Steve and Bucky bid their goodbyes at Sam and Peggy as they both waved back and headed out the gate.
"It's not that we don't want help Peter..but how can we be sure if that Stark won't do the same when he helps out?" Wanda spoke gently.
“But his father lets go of Steve Rogers to be on his own when he entered Stanford, under Steve’s request.”
"Hngh!" Steve on instinct wrapped his arms and legs around Bucky's neck and waist respectively. "N-Noo...Ah!"
"Yes you need one and that will be me. I can give you a comfortable life. That's why I want you to come with me. I can't let you live here."
"Well you better start to familiarize with him. He just likes it when people you know....see him like this kind of rock star."Happy rolled his eyes.
“O-Oh God…Bucky..” Steve rolled his eyes as the Alpha’s tongue skillfully licks and flicks his nipple.
“Don’t be.” The Alpha winked. “I want to show you my favourite room.” He gently placed his hand on his back and leads him.
"Then, pretend you didn't see me." She turned around to open the door when she heard the clicking sound of a gun, pressured to her head.
“My God, stop it. Both of you should just go home and come back tomorrow. He’s gonna need a long night rest. It’s probably best if both of you leave so the tension here won’t flow into his room.” Happy said.
Walking through the lobby area, he felt even more nervous that his heart might come out of his chest. He goes in the elevator and huffed. Contemplating whether he should go or not. He shook his head and pressed the highest floor which is his CEO Tony Stark’s office. Steve does not know if he’s doing the right thing. He broke his trance when the elevator opened.
"Yeah, just got here today. I didn't have the time to properly introduce him to you. What about him Pete?"
"But Nat.. I just don't get why Bucky is involved in something like this! I mean he did tell me that his dad was hard on him but I'm sure he was a good man to not let him do this kind stuff." Steve bit his lip in frustration.
“No, you don’t.” Steve gave him another push until he let go of his waist. He was ready to dash into the elevator until Tony grabbed his wrist and pulls him to pin him against his office door. “Mr. Stark! Stop this!” Steve struggled against the strong hold but his hands were pinned to each side of his head.
“I know he’s in the wrong but please…just talk to him at least. He wants to apologize.” Happy pleaded Steve with Peter looking worriedly at him.
"There was just something...dark about him." Peter shook his head. "I don't know but I know he's going to hurt Steve. I still lack in experience, I can't do it by myself."
“I’m going to assume he’s the one with slightly long hair since the other is the infamous Mr. Stark?” Sam raised his brow.
That’s enough for Bucky to see red. Before both Alphas lunged at each other, Happy and Brock stood between them to stop them.
Bucky growled and glared at Happy again. “Tell Stark that he won’t be working with him anymore. He’s mine!”
“Yes, I’m aware I’m an Omega. I know what the society thinks. Weak, fragile and only good for breeding. But that’s why I need to prove them wrong!”
"Hey, here's some hot chocolate." Natasha sets the mug down on the table in front of Steve as she sits next to him.
Natasha sighed and gave him a soft smile. "You're like a dear brother to me Steve. You don't deserve to live like this Steve. You have no idea how meeting you and becoming your friend changed my life. Most of the time I would be assigned to be an undercover spy to watch the people that have dealt with us. Imagine my surprise when I was assigned to watch over a cute, independent blue eyed Omega with a heart of gold."
"Natasha, just handle it. I need to go to this other stupid meetings." Tony sighed as he wears his blazer, ready to get out of the door.
"Steve.." The man looked at a picture of him and Steve back when they were in high school. How could everything changed just like that? Why is Steve not here with him by his side? They have been together ever since they were kids. How could just one messed up situation change Steve's perspective of him?
Steve bit his lips. "I just felt really bad. I mean, you're such a good friend of mine. I was hurt but then when I did that-"
"I guess he sounds okay. I do hear him a lot on the news but never really notice his face. I mean when you're busy making coffees, you just don't have time to look up, only listen." He laughed.
“Come on, I think it is time to talk about your show. Let’s go to my office.” He said hurriedly to hide his embarrassment.
“Bucky! Stop it!” Steve nudges Sam to the side to stand in front of Bucky bravely. “Don’t talk to him that way.”
"You can't do that!" Steve was furious. He couldn't believe how controlling Bucky could be in his life.
Steve was mortified at the confession. "W-What is wrong with you?!" He stepped back, in hoping maybe he could outrun the scene.
“Thank you for helping me out.” Steve smiled and then frowned. “Oh, God the bills. I’m so sorry, my mind was blanked just now..I-I forgot to tell you-“
"Yeah, don't think that's a good idea Tony." Happy agreed. "All three of us will meet him tomorrow."
"Like I said, trades, exports. Basically, I sometimes meet up with certain clients to deal with. The company Natasha works in is one of my clients and to make a deal, had to go through her. That's how we met. It's a private company anyway, they don't like sharing the company's info."
She winked and went to her room. Even when she's inside he could still hear her voice clearly. "Make sure you sleep Steve! I'm gonna check up on you after my shower! And if you're not asleep by then, I'm going to sing you a lullaby!"
Barnes sighed. "Can't undo it anyway...Rumlow just get rid of that Parker kid. Do what you have to do."
"You're not listening to me! You always go for violence ever since we were in high school! Your temper is always blinding you."
"Alright. But then you're coming with me and be with me." Bucky whispered as he kissed his ear, making Steve shiver.
"Yeah well, most of them just tell me to always wear suppressants especially when nearing heats. My school is literally 85% Alphas and Betas combined. As much as they would love to help, it couldn't be helped that Omegas just attracts Alphas." He shrugged. "But I know I shouldn't complain that much, I mean there are even Omegas that have been through physical harm, sexual harassment and even..rape."
Bucky fisted his hand till his knuckles were white. He hates the thought of his Omega going alone but he knows how stubborn his Omega can be when he makes up his mind. And he is not going to let this chance of his Omega submitting to him willingly pass up.
“Listen, Steve. I hate this as much as you do. I would never even suggest this if it truly was a terrible idea. Just give it a shot. If you feel, even the slightest bit uncomfortable and it’s not working then we will stop it, okay?”
"Let's be honest. When he comes home he's going straight to Steve, pick him up bridal style, go to their room and go at it like fucking rabbits-oww!" Sam wailed when Steve threw a carrot at Sam's head to which Peggy laughed out loud.
“STARK!” A female voice boomed through the hallway. Steve turned to look at Natasha who was just coming out of the elevator and stomping angrily towards them.
Steve walked inside and the first thing he sensed was danger. He looked straight ahead and saw the Alpha. His pheromones went straight to his nose. Eyes widen in shock. Why was the Alpha here? There could only mean one thing. Before he could do anything the Alpha stood up abruptly, chair falling backwards in the process.
Tony’s heart melted yet again. He does not know if he was in his right mind or not. He knows that he just met this beautiful Omega like 40 minutes ago but he already feels an amazing chemistry between the two. “Steve, I really am sorry that I blurted out like that. I swear I’m not some weird-“
He groaned and blushed. "They should be educated on that! And...I thought you will let that go..." He said timidly.
Wade shrugged. "It seems like one way or another I will die anyway..might as well." Wade saw how Peter looked at him as if he was grateful. It made the Alpha's body tingle.
"And the 17th time throughout your whole cookout." Sam said as he gave Steve a look as he was putting out the plates on the table.
Steve looked at him in disbelief. “You don’t get to tell me what to do!” He struggled against the hold but failed yet again.
Steve laughed. "Sure mom!" He got up and went to the kitchen to put wash the mugs. After that, he searched for his phone only to find its battery died. He wanted to make a call with his landlord to talk about the situation that Tony put him in. He just sighs thinking about it. Plus, he also needed to call Sam and Wanda to make an excuse of why he might not be at home. They tend to make a 'surprise visit' to hangout which Steve knows they just want to make sure he is okay. It always warms his heart to how sweet they are.
Tony was immediately bombarded by a furious Natasha who kept asking him questions in hushed angry tones.
Steve blushed and nodded. "Yeah not gonna lie I've been dreaming of it ever since he proposed, before he went to the army." He paused as he looks at the ring on his finger, smiling. "I've always loved a simple garden wedding. The classic white with hints of pastels here and there with lilies. And maybe roses. Just a small and simple wedding with families and close friends." Steve looked at them, smiling.
"What's he like?" Tony asked eagerly. As much as he loves the paintings and drawings. He can't help to be more interested in the artist behind it. Even Happy is amuse at the desperate tone in his voice.
"We're gonna reach there in a few minutes okay?" Bucky kissed Steve's hand and rubbed it gently as if it was a delicate flower.
"I-I just can't Peggy...I feel like I could not do anything anymore. He is all I could think about! Why?! Why did he leave me like this...we're supposed to be together til the end of the line." He sobbed. Peggy cupped his cheeks and sighed sadly.
