the pool might’ve been within his best interest. At least he’d be able to cool off. His aquaphobia would banish the worst of his lusty thoughts.
He tried seeing Steve’s point of view. How would he have felt if he’d found another omega cuddled up to Steve, nestled snugly in his lap?
The streets had been empty due to the late hour, almost giving off the appearance that they were the only two people left in the world. The stars had been bright and visible above them, creating an idyllic glow in the sky.
He wanted to devastate Steve. For the alpha to remember this as long as he lived. For all his future hookups to pale in comparison.
But he wasn’t willing to cut off contact with Steve, either. He was damned if he did, damned if he didn’t.
“Nothing, nothing. But you’re telling me that in a gourmet ice cream parlor offering over fifty unique flavors, butter pecan is the one you wanted the most?”
Which was a bad, bad thought to be having in such a public place. The last thing he needed was his pheromones acting up again.
Steve stuck the key in the ignition, the engine coming to life with a soft rumble. “You didn’t ruin anything. A lot of people have trouble getting back into the water after something like—”
He immediately swept the thought from his head. Thought—what thought? He’d never had that thought. Nope.
Unbelievable. The alpha’s blood was being rerouted from his brain, his massive erection staring Tony straight in the face, and still his only priority was Tony’s well-being.
His experiences with Obie had left Tony with zero tolerance for possessive jealousy, but jealousy was an unavoidable human emotion. The emotion itself wasn’t the problem. How one responded to it was.
Howard had only laughed, sloppy and unhinged, like it’d all been some kind of game. He’d clapped Tony on the back.
“I’m sorry.” Steve set his jaw. “I don’t think it’s fair that omegas aren’t granted the same opportunities as the rest of us.”
“Okay, yeah, valid point, so my math was a little off there. I-it’s normally never wrong, but I’m really flustered right now, and…”
Until then, he’d have to settle for playing referee again. He’d been able to get Steve to stand down earlier. Hopefully, he could manage it now too.
Steve went as still as a predator stalking behind its prey. His voice was lower, more dangerous, than Tony had ever heard it. “Tell me.”
He had no experience with this kind of attention—with having someone being so heavily focused on him, on making him feel good.
Tony had been a very shy and introverted child. He’d quickly grown used to his parents’ absences and had latched onto technology to keep his loneliness at bay. Howard hadn’t liked that Tony had always been hidden in his room or huddled in the corner, working away on yet another circuit board or inventing addons to a gadget he’d found in their home. It had confused Tony, because back then he’d still been stupid enough to believe that Howard could one day be proud of him. That Howard would recognize they shared an interest in building things. That he’d be pleased by Tony being as smart as he was. But Howard hadn’t been impressed by any of Tony’s achievements.
Which, in all likelihood, contributed to the massive hickey he found under his ear the next morning.
bother me…” Tony answered cautiously. “I don’t usually make friends with alphas nearly 10 years my junior. There really aren’t too many people who’d approve of us hanging out like this.”
Tony could feel the alpha’s eyes following him as they walked down the driveway. The persistent sensation didn’t leave until they’d rounded the corner out of sight.
A harsh, almost primal noise that was way hotter than it should’ve been vibrated from the teenager’s chest. “I wish I could’ve helped, or…or been there for you,” he declared gutturally. “I hate thinking of you growing up like that.”
If Steve’s fingers felt this incredible, how would his cock feel? Tony wouldn’t survive it. He’d splinter into a million pieces.
And, hey, it wasn’t like this was his first close call with death. It was starting to feel old hat by now.
“Why wouldn’t I be?” A disapproving expression had settled onto Steve’s face. It was the one that usually made an appearance whenever Tony said something self-deprecating.
The teenager squared his stance, face losing some of its softness. “I have one rule of my own. I’m the only person you ‘explore’ the summer with. I don’t share. I want you all to myself.” Then, seeming to realize that he’d just promised ‘no alpha bullshit’ and was already coming dangerously close to breaking that rule, he amended, “Please.”
‘I didn’t see a reason to mention it’ basically translated into ‘you aren’t going to be around long enough to have warranted telling’.
Rhodey had relented enough to let Steve take Tony home, but not enough to skip the standard, familial ‘touch him and die’ talk.
“Uh huh,” Natasha confirmed happily, sending Tony’s pulse skyrocketing so high it was like his heart was trying to shoot straight through the stratosphere.
“I-I…uh…” he stuttered. What was wrong with him? His heart was pounding and his entire body felt flushed. He wasn’t usually one to fawn over alphas. Okay, so they were big and muscly. What was so impressive about that? Most of it was genetic, they didn’t even have to work at it. Their personalities, on the other hand, left a whole hell of a lot to be desired. Other than Pepper, Rhodey, and a few others, most alphas didn’t even see him as human. He was just a status to them. A possession. An omega.
The teen hadn’t even given Tony a proper kiss goodbye when he’d left. No, Tony had gotten a chaste kiss on the forehead, instead.
He recovered his bravado before she could sense something was wrong. “I’d be happier if I was swimming right now.”
“He was getting too...he was getting the wrong idea. About us—just like you warned me. I had to set the record straight.”
of assholes. He’d been taking his feelings of inadequacy over what Brock had done to him out on the teenager. But, god, he’d had Steve so wrong.
They’d gone from zero to one-hundred. From a sweet, almost innocent kiss to practically dry humping as Steve held him pressed up against the wall. Steve had barely had to touch him before Tony had turned into the Guinness World Records’ horniest, neediest omega.
He jumped up as fast as his hangover would allow. Bolting to the living room, he grabbed onto the wall to keep from tipping over.
“…Okay,” Tony heard himself agreeing. His blood was pounding in his ears so loudly that he was barely aware of what happened next. He remembered rattling off his number and being unable to stop his fingers from shaking as he programmed Steve into his contact list as ‘The Lifeguard’.
He could all but see his loneliness and self-isolation continuing to grow. Could see them putting down roots and spreading out before him like an endless eternity, suffocating him and draining the life from him, and suddenly, he couldn’t take it.
Fine, Steve wanted an answer that badly? Tony would give him one. But the teenager wouldn’t like it.
The bot was a silver android made to be slightly humanoid in appearance without erring on the side of creepy. He was dressed in red football gear, complete with his own helmet, shoulder pads, gloves, and knee pads, and was holding his own tiny prop football. His computerized facial viewscreen consisted of two bright, circular lights for eyes. They changed shape according to his moods.
Jesus, he was going to owe the teenager a bill for all the impromptu therapy sessions Steve had given him soon.
Tony listened to Steve’s padded footsteps as the alpha retreated down the hall. He returned a moment later with a light knock on the door. Pushing the door open only wide enough for his head to poke out, Tony chanced a glance at the alpha. The teen was no longer bare chested and had put on a white T-shirt—Tony thanked god for small mercies—and was holding his jersey in one outstretched hand. Tony snatched it and quickly shut the door again.
Blushing wildly, he coughed until his airway was free of booze. “That,” he sputtered as Steve just laughed at him, grin loose and easy, “was evil. And diabolical. And I’m a little impressed you got me to do a spit take.”
Waltzing over to Rhodey, “Why move my chair when I can just monopolize yours? Sharing is caring, Gummy bear.” He dropped himself down onto Rhodey’s lap.
happy, “This will never work. Let’s be honest, there’s no future here. You’re leaving in September. And even if we pretend I’m not too old for you, there’s still the little problem of me being disgraced.”
He almost couldn’t believe it, but he could see that Steve absolutely meant it. If Tony gave the order, the teenager would back off once and for all.
Steve crossed his arms over his chest, regarding Tony expectantly, and Tony flushed as he became aware that he was taking way too long to answer because he’d been having a one-sided conversation in his head.
And once that happened, it no longer mattered that his mind knew that he wasn’t in any danger, because his body didn’t agree. His body was convinced that he was drowning. That he was dying. That the water was going to flood his lungs, robbing him of breath until his chest burst wide open.
Steve was at his side in an instant, his big hands steadying him. “Careful, baby. Take it easy,” the alpha’s breath tickled his ear.
It was often said that omegas needed touch and connection to thrive, arguably even more so than others. Tony didn’t want to believe that. He didn’t want to need anybody.
“Nah.” Steve smirked, blue eyes warming. “Why would I stop you from complimenting me?” His gaze only grew warmer as his eyes began a slow, hot slide all the way up from Tony’s fitted jeans, to the top of his neatly gelled hair. “You changed. You look good, babe.” Voice going a bit husky, he muttered, “You always look good.”
Tony thought as he scowled up at the entrance of the community center. It hadn’t even been a full 24 hours since he’d left.
The pale, faded line slicing down Tony’s sternum had always served as visible proof that he wasn’t alpha material.
Tony was hit with a vivid flash of Obie’s leather belt sliding out of the loops of his suit pants before he could block it out. His stomach churned and his entire soul seemed to recoil.
Steve wasn’t faring much better. That much was obvious. The teen’s pupils were too dark and he kept glancing at Tony with a hyper fixated, almost proprietary glint in his eyes, like he wasn’t able to help himself. His muscles looked a little more tense, his movements a bit more strained…but other than that, he seemed to be in surprisingly high spirits for an alpha who’d been left aroused and unfulfilled in the middle of a swimming pool.
A slow smile. “Finally. Now we’re getting somewhere.” Uncrossing his arms, Steve took a step towards Tony, advancing on him with an intent that made Tony’s knees embarrassingly weak and a fire light under his skin.
Steve was too damn young and had too bright of a future ahead of him to sully himself on someone as tarnished as Tony.
the water without feeling another one coming on. It was an uncontrollable, sort of preemptive response where his body geared up for the worst-case scenario, whether it was happening or not.
The alpha seemed too captivated by what he was looking at to reply. A framed photograph of a young Tony had grabbed his attention. Reaching across the pile of papers, he picked it up for closer inspection.
. “Life.” The teenager was all he could think about. It was so bad that he was being plagued by an itch under his skin like the alpha was actually there.
know what was going on, and simply didn’t care. Maybe he saw that Tony was an omega and decided not to get involved.
sassing me.” Tony narrowed his eyes. “Don’t push it, buddy. You’re on a tenuous friendship probationary period as it is.”
“That’s what you said at breakfast. If I let you go hungry, your mom will fire me and that will be sad for both of us—though, admittedly, mostly for me.”
Yeah, talking about it had helped, to an extent. He’d felt a slight unburdening, like he’d gotten some of the poison out. But it’d also been terrifying and emotionally draining. They never mentioned that on TV. How you had to walk through hellfire to get to the other side. How it burned. How part of you would rather let the smoke suffocate you than go through it all again, even if it meant never getting any better.
“Anthony Edward Stark?” a woman holding a clipboard called out, breaking through whatever spell Tony had fallen under. “The doctor will see you now.”
He was horrified to realize that his eyes were starting to itch. He swallowed, clearing the lump in his throat. “So, there you have it. There’s my poor-little-rich-boy childhood story. Don’t feel too sorry for me, though, I did have a wicked awesome butler.” Pasting on a grin that didn’t feel quite as convincing as he’d intended it to be, he finally risked eye contact with Steve. He hadn’t been able to look at the alpha while he’d been essentially ripping himself open.
Not three hours into his and Steve’s date, and Tony was already being reminded of why he’d never be able to have a nice, normal evening.
“Did he—” the teen bit out, sounding like he was warring with himself to stay calm, “—did your dad treat you like that a lot?”
“Tony. Fuck...never felt anything like you.” Hissing out a breath, the teen slowly started working his finger in and out. “So tight and hot, it’s gonna kill me if I ever get my cock inside you.”
So much for that lecture earlier. They hadn’t even made it five minutes into the movie before they’d started trying to climb inside each other’s skin.
Tony had collapsed to his knees, spitting out water. He’d stayed there, hunched over and shivering, for a long time. Until his mother had come and had taken him up to his room.
But that couldn’t possibly be true, could it? It’s not like Steve had tricked his brother into becoming friends with Nat and then roped his mother into calling Tony so that she could arrange a playdate in some convoluted scheme to get him alone...that would be insane.
The day he’d learned he’d been offered a scholarship to MIT had been one of them. Figuring out the correct programming on his first robot had been another. The early years of his childhood, back when his mother had tucked him in at night and read him to sleep—before she’d started treating him like he wasn’t good enough to be her son—held a few more. As did the weekends where he’d broken out of Omega Finishing School to sneak off and visit Rhodey.
“Yeah, I’m a real buzzkill for keeping you from dying of alcohol poisoning,” Steve said flatly. His perceptive blue eyes were watching Tony too closely; seeing everything Tony was hellbent on hiding. “You don’t look like you’re having fun, babe. I’m going to ask you again: What happened? This isn’t you. You wouldn’t act like this without a reason.”
a peak specimen—” She quickly cut herself off when she noticed Thor’s eyes narrowing. “Uh, does anyone want hors d'oeuvres?”
Mr. Modok had been an angry little man with a large inferiority complex over being a beta. He’d used his position as a teacher to target and bully any children he’d suspected would later present as omegas.
She had made Bucky a mermaid crown during their arts and crafts session the other day and was clearly excited to show it to him. Her own crown was currently sitting on her head.
So it surprised him that, while he was still embarrassed by how loudly his body was telling Steve to fuck him, he was also somehow at ease.
Tony had been employed as Natasha’s nanny for six months now, and while he wasn’t as bad with kids as he’d originally feared, it wasn’t exactly his dream job. His dream job wasn’t even on the table as a possibility. The harsh reality was that he was grateful to be employed at all. The job market was impossibly hard on omegas. For one thing, employers frequently refused to hire them (especially disgraced omegas like Tony), and for another, they weren’t allowed to receive any education beyond high school or make more than minimum wage. This, of course, forced too many omegas down less than favorable career paths in order to survive and kept them dependent on alphas and betas.
Instead of being helpful and not escalating things with Rhodey, the teen got all cocky, pushed into Rhodey’s space, and said, “I’d like to see you try it. We’ll go a few rounds. I guarantee you won’t like the outcome.”
His anger gave way to desperation, his emotions volatile and unmanageable. “Please. I can’t...it’s...it’s killing me. I gotta...gotta make it go away...gotta forget her.”
He enjoyed a split second of adrenaline, of the rush that came with getting something off his chest, before panic swiftly took hold of him.
“But you’re…” Without meaning to, Tony dropped his eyes down to the very unmistakable erection straining the alpha’s cargo shorts.
when he’d sworn to fight for Tony; when he’d promised that his interest in Tony was more than just some game.
“Boo. I miss Captain Handsome,” Darcy complained as she readjusted the balled-up towel she was using as a head rest. “I’m not feeling this new lifeguard. He better not be Steve’s replacement. I need my daily dose of biceps and triceps. This kid might turn out to be cute one day, but he looks too young. I’m not comfortable lusting over teenagers.”
It might’ve been impossibly cramped and in need of constant repairs and upkeep...but it was still a thousand times better than the gilded cage he’d stayed in with Obie, because it was
Omega Finishing School had taught them that it was selfish. That ‘good omegas’ saved their pleasure for their alphas. In some places, it was even a punishable offense.
As it was, Tony was already having to physically restrain himself from responding to the insane levels of dominance in the air. The only reason he wasn’t falling to his knees and displaying his throat right now was because he was pretty sure Steve’s anger wasn’t really directed at him.
Tony managed a lazy grunt in reply. The hot afternoon sun was beaming down on him, making him not want to move. The material of his t-shirt felt stifling and was practically sticking to him. Not for the first time, he resented the fact that he was too fucked up to cool off in the water. He had to be the only loser who went to the pool and was too damn afraid to swim.
Tony bit his lip. “What if I said that I don’t want you to leave me alone...that I might, uh, want to explore whatever this is between us…?”
you. He’s got a crush on you and clearly doesn’t like me very much. He’s gonna talk. That means your teammates—and who knows how many others—are bound to find out about us. I’m already damaging your street cred.”
“That might be kind of difficult to do postmortem…” Tony’s pace slowed as he hesitantly followed Steve out onto the pool deck. The pool loomed in front of him, looking as expansive, deep, and menacing as the Pacific Ocean. “And, well, uh, on second thought, I’m not sure I’m up for any swimming lessons today, anyway. I had a big dinner. That’s a rule, right? That I’m not supposed to go in the water immediately after eating? Maybe we should reschedule.”
The teenager was unfailingly patient. He never tried to take more than Tony was willing to give. Never tried to make Tony feel like what they were doing wasn’t enough for him. Even when it had to be killing the alpha to be stuck in a limbo of kissing and light groping with an omega he was so compatible with.
. “Listen, you’ve gotta stop saying these kinds of things to me and being so damn nice all the time, or…”
They’d nabbed the two chairs on either side of Tony, sandwiching him between them. When he’d asked for someone to pass him the ketchup, both Steve and Rhodey had reached out so fast, he’d half expected them to arm wrestle to the death over the right to hand it to him.
“Yeah. Summer’s my favorite season,” Steve said without looking up from his paper. “I wish it lasted all year round. I’d live in the water if I could. It used to drive my mom crazy when I was younger—I never wanted to get out of the pool.”
“Nanny Tony!” He heard the pitter-patter of little feet racing towards him and then the redhead was standing in front of him, brandishing her arm at him and hiccupping through her tears. “Nanny Tony, I’m bleedin’!” The girl was normally a tough cookie but she really didn’t like the sight of blood.
Tony blinked until the stinging cleared, swallowing against the thickening in his throat. “Okay, kid. Yeah. I choose you, too.”
The teenager had come in and shaken Tony out of the humdrum of everyday life. He’d thrown Tony into a tailspin the minute they’d met. Had overwhelmed him, challenged him, and made Tony question everything. The strength of Tony’s reaction to him had brought all his anxieties and insecurities roaring to the surface, where he could no longer hide them.
He lost control of the conversation after that. By the time he finally hung up, he’d somehow been smooth talked into agreeing to meet up with Steve and Bucky at the park. It had been Steve’s idea. That way, Tony could drop off Bucky’s tablet, and Nat and Bucky could spend some playtime together.
Jerking his head towards the commotion, Tony found Bucky and Natasha being cornered by a slightly older girl. A blonde with her hair in two braids and the practiced sneer of a bully on her face said something to Natasha that Tony couldn’t hear, and Natasha pushed her to the ground. The blonde promptly burst into loud, wailing, crocodile tears.
—” Tony pointed to the picture of Steve that was displayed on Darcy’s phone; the alpha was wearing his football uniform and towering, all broad shouldered and golden, over his teammates like some kind of superhero, “—a teenager?!”
His stomach instantly rebelled, souring like he was going to be sick. The world turned red and a near psychotic jealousy clouded his vision.
? Where in the world had this 18-year-old learned how to be so damned romantic? He wasn’t playing fair.
When Steve at last moved aside to let him leave, Tony was ashamed to find that he lingered there, staring at the teenager like some kind of lovestruck idiot.
Tony could practically hear the gears in the teenager’s head grinding to a complete stop. He was staring at Tony like Tony had short-circuited his brain. There was one part of him, though, that was functioning just fine. A large bulge was rising in his jeans at breakneck speed.
“I’m fine. I was just in the neighborhood. Figured I’d drop by.” It was complete bullshit and Rhodey knew it, but he was too nice to point that out.
what he’d expected the alpha to say. Was Steve telling the truth or was he trying to trick Tony into a false state of security? His blue eyes looked honest enough, but Tony had seen alphas pretend to care about omega rights before, only to turn around and punish those who came forward. “Life isn’t fair,” he answered carefully. “It is what it is.”
Doubt was creeping in. What if Steve thought the gift was stupid? Or that Tony was inserting himself where he didn’t belong—overstepping his bounds and being the textbook clingy omega?
Christ, Tony was never gonna get over how the teen’s smile could knock him off his feet. “I’d like that.” Steve hesitated, leading Tony to think that the alpha wanted to do or say something more. Unfortunately, all he said was, “I’ll call you later, baby. Get some sleep.”
Tony had scoured a bunch of different salvage yards to find the parts needed to build him. The final product was wonkier and more mismatched than he would’ve liked. The bot’s proportions were slightly off, as if he’d been hitting the gym and skipping leg day. “He could use more work, but I wanted to have him ready for you as soon as possible. Before belated turned into the twelfth of never. You, uh, don’t have to keep him if you don’t want to. He was just a fun little side project I thought you might like. It’s no big deal if—”
How fucked up did he have to be to cast a 19-year-old in the role of the father of his children? Steve had a whole life to live before kids entered into the equation. He didn’t need his college years bogged down with dirty diapers.
. Steve had won him, they insisted. Steve was giving Tony his protection. He’d saved Tony’s life. The teenager had proven himself the apex predator.
Tony almost toppled over as he rushed to shove his legs into his nicest pair of jeans. Righting himself, he yanked them up to his waist and quickly fastened them, hopping from foot to foot in his race to get ready.
“Breathe, baby. Breathe,” Steve’s voice chased away the memories. Quickly catching on that something was wrong, the alpha had disengaged, his hands moving to Tony’s shoulders. “How can I help? Tell me what you need from me right now.”
Darcy looked confused for a second and then her eyes widened. “Oh my god – you are! I mean, it’s faint, but…you totally want to mate that alpha!”
Steve broke into an ear-to-ear grin. “He talks?” he asked Tony, voice as excited as a little kid in a candy shop. “You’re building robots that talk now? Will he understand me if I answer him?” To the robot, “Hey, buddy, do you understand me?”
“I couldn’t exactly stay away.” Tony attempted to stay calm, even though, internally, he was anything but. “If I deprived Nat of seeing Bucky, she’d turn on me in a second. I’d become the most hated nanny in America. So, yeah…that’s why I’m here. For Nat, and Nat alone. It has nothing to do with me wanting to see you.”
Tony went for a bench shaped and painted to resemble an ice cream sandwich. He didn’t have to wait long before Steve dropped down next to him.
“That’s real nice and not something many people would say—seriously, you should probably reconsider that statement—but I’m not letting you pay me 200 dollars for something I could’ve fixed in my sleep.”
“I won’t be needing your company, Killian,” Steve said, an edge in his voice. “I’m in the middle of a date with someone important to me and I don’t appreciate you talking to me like he isn’t here.”
He struggled, and he flailed, and he took multiple swings at Brock, but it all happened too fast. The beta still managed to wrangle him into his arms.
He returned to Steve’s side and let the teen wrap him back up like a burrito. A very snuggly, happy—albeit sexually pent up—burrito.
“Nice. I was hoping to see that, but we’re seeing Under Siege, instead. It’s the girls’ turn to pick the movie tonight.”
“Did you…” Tony swiped the back of his hand over his red, debauched mouth. “Did you just break my bed?”
When Steve still tried to tag along, Tony put a hand on his chest and repeated in his most commanding voice, “
“No one likes boring and sweaty. We’re more than just a couple of house omegas, Tones. We need to live a little. Seize the day.”
It’d been impossible for him to be anything other than loud and unrestrained when Steve was touching him. Especially in the throes of his orgasm. He’d basically moaned down the rooftops. And he’d definitely cried out Steve’s name. Multiple times.
Relief surged through Tony like Steve had passed a test Tony hadn’t realized he’d been giving him. The ache in his chest returned so strongly he thought it was going to burst.
“You are not who I spoke to on the phone,” Tony insisted, mentally calculating if he was running a fever and hallucinating. “That was a woman’s voice. Quite an affable lady, really, and clearly not you considering your lack of, er, ladyhood. She invited us over but we must have the wrong house.” He stepped backwards. “Terribly sorry to have bothered you. Goodbye.”
“Reminds me of someone.” Rhodey looked meaningfully over at Tony. “You used to embarrass the rest of us at the school science fair. It was never a competition; it was a slaughter. We’d be there with our potato radios and paper-mache volcanoes, and you’d show up with some kind of anti-gravity device or miniaturized remote controlled hover car.”
He kept reliving Steve’s touch. His taste. That masculine purring sound he’d made when they’d kissed.
The impressive muscles in the teen’s abdomen contracted from behind his T-shirt. A purr burst from his throat, “Yeay, baby, yeah. Like that.”
“That woman is banana balls. She went all Swimfan on my sister’s boyfriend a few years ago and almost broke them up. I thought Thor was going to have to get a restraining order.”
“Okay,” Tony said hastily. “Tour’s over. I’m hungry and I believe I was promised food. Shouldn’t you be feeding me right about now?”
Tony was saved from having to answer her by Natasha calling his name. “Nanny Tony! Nanny Tony! Help!” The redhead had managed to get her goggles twisted around her head.
It wasn’t Tony’s first run in with the dictatorial dance instructor version of Natasha. Her parents had started Nat in ballet when she was three. They counted on him to make sure she was keeping up with her practices. Sometimes that entailed pretending he was studying ballet himself.
He was talking nonsense. Had no idea what he was saying. Thoughts were escaping his head without his permission.
“It’s not a threat, it’s a promise. If he comes around to bother you again, he’ll have to deal with me.”
He could only hope that his scent blockers (and ten layers of sunscreen) were strong enough to mask it. Either way, he needed to get away from this man, and fast. “Bye,” he blurted out awkwardly. Then he grabbed Darcy and hauled them both to the other side of the pool, where Natasha was playing.
It would be counterproductive to keep discounting the way that taking Steve’s hand had stopped his panic attack in its tracks. For whatever reason, his omega instincts were latching onto the alpha. Maybe, in this case, he could use that messed up dynamic to his advantage.
Steve fumbled, almost dropping his arm full of Tony’s snacks. (Seriously, if it wasn’t for his alpha reflexes, Tony figured the popcorn would 100% be all over the ground.) A bright red flush was burning across the teen’s cheekbones and his eyes had darkened with something that didn’t look like disinterest.
“I’m a mermaid,” the young girl said proudly. Her ‘mermaid tail’—a green pillowcase that she wore over her legs and had tied around her waist in an attempt to imitate fins—hung over the side of the wagon. “I can’t walk on land.”
Tony wouldn’t voice it, but he liked it, too. Wearing the teenager’s scent made him feel safer and less alone than he had in, god, far longer than he could remember. More at home in his own skin. Like he had a tribe of his own. Someone he could belong with.
“Holy shit.” Tony let out a surprised laugh. “You’d be into it. Don’t tell me you have a daddy kink.”
“I don’t like being away from you,” Darcy read aloud from over Tony’s shoulder, sounding like she was about to swoon. “Oh my god. That’s fucking adorable. How often does he say that kind of thing to you? I’m so jealous right now.”
No. He wasn’t ready to cross that final bridge yet. But this was farther than he’d ever thought he could go.
He was nearly certain he had a bottle of Jack Daniel's stashed away in his desk. It took extreme concentration not to fall on his ass as he fumbled his way over and pulled open the bottom drawer.
“You and what army?” Tony scoffed bitterly. “Let me tell you something, what Howard and Maria want, Howard and Maria get. You can’t change that.”
Tony came so hard he felt changed. Turned inside out and remade. Like Steve was putting him back together.
Tony could get dangerously addicted to that kind of attention. “I bet you say that to all the omegas,” he joked, playing it off.
They’d both seemed to be stalling. Seemed to be attempting to make the night last as long as possible.
“Okay, okay. I’m taking it.” Attempting some levity, “So, maybe you weren’t entirely off base when you said that I have a tendency to put myself down...I’m lucky you’re so committed to stroking my ego. You’re doing a stellar job so far. If I had known I’d receive flattery like this, I would have agreed to go out with you much sooner.”
“I’m not even sure I can kiss you again without having another meltdown. So, you know, there’s that to look forward to.”
Darkened, conflicted blue eyes roamed Tony’s face. Tony could see the teen visibly grappling with his more violent alpha instincts, struggling internally to wrestle them back.
He shouldered open Tony’s bedroom door, his alpha strength allowing him to cart Tony around as if he was lighter than air.
“I find it exceedingly entertaining that you once apologized to me for ‘cussing’,” Tony ribbed him, amused. “Listen to you now. Your language is hardly puritanical these days, Rogers. You sound like you were raised in the woods.”
“Order pizza. But, Nanny Tony, you don’t have to worry, ‘cause I told Bucky you’d burn the mac n’ cheese, and he’s already bringing us pizza.”
There was something heady and intensely, sexually exhilarating about his ability to unravel the alpha. To make him feel good.
. And that was part of the problem. He made Tony feel too good. Too unguarded. Like the rug was about to be pulled out from under him at any minute.
He found her sitting at the bottom of the living room stairwell, sniffling and hugging her creepy doll.
Tony shrugged, face burning, his shame and embarrassment at an all-time high. All he could think about was Steve witnessing his weepy, drunken breakdown.
It was scary, and bewildering, and a little thrilling to know that he had Steve in his corner so fiercely. Other than Rhodey, no one else had ever had his back like that.
Rhodey didn’t live too far from Tony, but omegas weren’t legally allowed to drive—yet another trick society used to keep them dependent. It, unfortunately, took three times as long to get to his place by bus.
The man was tall, tanned, and blond, with a physique that put most professional athletes to shame. His handsome face was chiseled in such a way that it could’ve inspired Michelangelo himself to rise from the grave to sculpt another statue (and apparently had Tony waxing poetic like a school girl). He looked somewhere around the age of 25 and was wearing red, white, and blue swim shorts, and a red muscle tank that read ‘Lifeguard.” A whistle hung around his neck. His eyes were a startling, clear blue, and he was looking down at Tony in concern.
But he wouldn’t let the teenager throw himself on the sword for his sake. Or offer him a mating contract out of some misguided hero complex driven by pity.
“Maybe...if you want, you could show me around sometime. I’d love to see what you’ve been working on.”
“Tony – I’m here.” The same voice again. Steve’s voice. “Take my hand,” Steve ordered, reaching for him.
“I didn’t tell you this so that you’d—” Tony’s throat constricted. “Don’t make me regret trusting you.”
“There,” he said, gently placing the Band-Aid on her elbow. “Not only are you all better, but you’re also the most fashionable mermaid in the sea.”
been interested in an alpha. You were, like, the one exception to every omega rule. Not that I blame you. That guy’s muscles have muscles. His arms are…those are good arms to have.”
“No, I’m, uh, just the nanny,” Tony stammered. Why did his throat feel so dry? “Well, my friend Darcy is technically his nanny. But I’m a nanny too.”
He was planning on returning it and cutting all ties with the alpha, and was so focused on his phone that he missed Nat running up to him. Which resulted in him being showered in a handful of bluish-green glitter.
“Everything I’ve been working on lately is still in the very early stages of development.” Tony motioned to the pile of schematics on his desk. He’d been entertaining the idea of some kind of self-defensive weaponry ever since his run in with Brock. “I can’t say too much about it yet. Chances are it’ll be a big flop. As for why there’s a Barbie dream house sitting there, I’ve been fixing it up for Nat. The girl goes through toys like she’s trying to outdo the main antagonist in Toy Story. No doll makes it out alive.”
. “We were talking about someone else,” he said quickly, darting his eyes to Steve. “Not that you aren’t a perfectly nice, handsome young gentleman—emphasis on young—but I don’t personally…uh…” trailing off, he realized he was only digging himself deeper. “Well, what I mean to say is,” he gave a strained smile and glanced around. “You have a lovely home?”
In a show of bravado, he jerkily ripped his shirt over his head. His movements were rash and antsy, and when he flung the offending garment away and mashed his lips onto Steve’s, their noses rammed together awkwardly.
“Can I get you anything?” Steve spoke up. “A snack or a drink? I always see you with a coffee in your hand at the pool.”
It shouldn’t have been a novel concept, but Tony wasn’t used to being told that he mattered. Come to think of it, had he
He watched as she scampered off. Bruce followed suit, presumably relocating to a quieter spot to continue his scathing email.
Continuing to dodge eye contact, Tony busied himself by carefully tucking the alpha back inside his jeans.
“Ugh. Fine. You’re gonna make me say it. You know, I deserve a lifetime reward of free cookies for participating in this much open and honest communication. And people tell me I'm not mature.”
Darcy shook her head. “I live in a constant state of horror over what passes for you as nutrition. You know that, right?”
It couldn’t be true. It was too cruel to be true. Because how was he supposed to return to the life he’d had before Steve after losing the best thing that had ever happened to him?
Bucky pulled back the handgrip of the water gun but the toy had emptied. “Abort! Abort!” he informed Natasha. “I’m out of ammo! Run!”
“Still…” Rhodey continued, “teenager or not…that doesn’t make him harmless. Promise me you’ll let me know if he starts giving you trouble.”
If Tony didn’t know any better, he’d think they were accidentally mate bonding without realizing it.
“Hey,” he greeted, attempting to act like this was a normal occurrence for him and not the first official date he’d been on in twenty-seven years. He managed to pull it off for about half a second before immediately losing all cool points and blurting, “You came to the door.”
Part of him was bracing himself for the shock of his actions to hit him. For regret to tear through and send him into a panic over what he’d done.
A fierce scowl snapped onto Steve’s face. He growled softly. “I told you to knock that crap off. No one talks about you like that. Not even you.”
He’d been hurled into his past—sent right back there with Obie. The older man’s hand on his neck, pinning him down. His face shoved roughly into the mattress, numb with the poisonous, inescapable horror of knowing there was nothing he could do to get away. Obie’s fingers squeezing, restricting his air. Tony fighting to breathe, to forget, to pretend he was anywhere else while the older man—
Even when they weren’t permanently locked at the lips and pawing at each other like starving wolves, they were still in contact, texting each other around the clock.
“That’ll be $24.99,” the woman working the concession stand at the drive-in announced as she rang up Tony’s extra-large popcorn—heavy on the butter—root beer Big Gulp and multiple candy packets.
Tony wondered if Steve would pretend to yawn—pulling the oldest trick in the book—as he not-so-subtly slid his arm around Tony’s shoulder. If their hands would accidentally brush over the tub of popcorn, causing them to grin at each other like a couple of besotted idiots.
The two children had been competing with each other for the last 40 minutes. They had already battled it out to see who could do more jumping jacks, who could do a better handstand, and who could hold their breath the longest. They were the living embodiment of ‘Anything you can do, I can do better. I can do anything better than you.’ He was practically waiting for them to break into song.
“The other parents tried to accuse him of cheating.” Darcy angrily popped a fry into her mouth. “Can you believe that? They claimed no 10-year-old could pull off his project without help. Like, I’m sorry little Timmy and the rest of your children are so basic that you can’t understand greatness when you see it. But how is that Bruce’s fault?”
Before Tony could protest more, Steve tugged Tony into his arms, enclosing Tony in all that wonderful alpha strength and warmth. Happy, utterly relaxed purrs left the alpha’s chest.
Yeah, he’d been concerned about what his friends might think of their age difference. That was a factor. But if he was being completely honest with himself, the real reason he’d tried to keep their social circles separate was because he knew the deeper he embedded Steve into his life, the harder it would be to say goodbye.
Not for the first time, Tony found himself wondering how the existence of a person as good as Steve was even possible.
. Had shaded and detailed him impeccably, right down to the small, faded, white scar on his chin. (The scar he’d gotten from when his father had busted his face open in an alcohol fueled rage, but, Christ, he wasn’t about to go down that particular memory lane now.)
He was permanently aroused and aching. Unable to function. To think. To sleep. Every morning he woke up drenched in his own slick, hips grinding uselessly into the mattress. His dreams were filled with Steve. His waking thoughts were filled with Steve.
Now, he doubted whether he’d ever see his mother again. She and his father had disowned him after he’d become disgraced. Though, in most ways, he felt like he’d already lost them before that. Or like he’d never really had them at all.
Green eyes darkening dangerously, Nat reached a skinny arm out towards her plate and launched a sandwich triangle at him.
Tony would very much like to see MomOfTheYear09 try to discredit his cleaning solvent now. It was the only thing that had successfully removed the red goop from the white paint. Tony didn’t want to imagine what would’ve happened if that hadn’t worked, because Nat’s parents probably would’ve ended up firing his ass for letting the kids destroy their house. Now they’d be none the wiser. A job well done, if he did say so himself.
He hoped, for the kid’s sake, that they turned out more like Steve. Their kid deserved better than to be anything like him.
The woman quickly tucked her phone away, dispersing with the rest of the nosy stragglers. But, honestly, it wasn’t like she was any worse than the rest of the pool goers. The ones who were still tanning, swimming, or relaxing, and going about their day.
Being in the same place as his overprotective best friend and overprotective more-than-friend was going to be what finally killed him. If he made it through the night without being smothered under the combined weight of their territorialism, it’d be a major scientific breakthrough.
“Her dad’s an astronaut. The guy’s hardcore into astronomy.” Inspecting Tony with the keen eye of a friend, “Tony, man, is everything okay with you? You look...”
“Easy, baby. Slow down.” Steve’s hands pushed Tony’s shoulders gently into the mattress. “It’s not a race to the finish line. I’ve been waiting a long time for this.”
Steve stopped Tony from closing the door on him with his foot. His expression had taken on his trademark ‘never give up, never surrender’ stubbornness. “If you think I’m that easy to get rid of, Tony, you don’t know me very well.”
No one else would’ve had the patience and perseverance necessary to see him through the process of dealing with his problems—to help him heal. No one else would’ve had the resilience to climb over the impenetrable, sky-high walls he’d built around himself.
Tony blinked, still bewildered by how easily the alpha had railroaded their phone call. “Do you want to go to the park to see Bucky?”
Obie had compounded the damage those lessons had left behind. Had reinforced it and fed it until it’d taken on a life of its own.
He moaned into his pillow, squeezing his eyes shut against the sunlight that was attacking him. The curtains were closed but it was still too bright.
Disgraced omegas were seen by and large as being good for only one thing: a quick, dirty fuck. They were no longer considered mate material.
When his parents had contractually given him to Obie, they’d lost their legally recognized ownership over him. After Obie had fought to have the contract dissolved—and Tony had been ruled disgraced—his parents hadn’t been granted their ownership back. Tony’s abandonment meant he’d become a free agent.
“Dismantled. My dad had him taken apart for scrap metal before I left for boarding school.” Howard had claimed that he was too old to be playing with his “little toys”. Ignoring the twinge of sadness at the fate of his old bot, Tony added, “I managed to save his CPU—I still have it. I plan on rebuilding him as soon as I save up enough money for all the parts.”
Steve barely hesitated before following after him. “What’s wrong?” he asked, concerned—like it was his job to fix it.
“I can smell like whoever and whatever I want. I’m not your property.” He refused to go through this again. Even for Steve. “Pull over. I’ll walk the rest of the way.”
Steve blinked at him. “Tony…?” he said again, sounding unsure, and if Tony wasn’t mistaken, also a little hurt.
“Yeah,” the alpha said heavily, a world of meaning behind his words. “I know what it’s like to want someone that much.”
Hands tightening on the steering wheel, the teen slowed the car, parking it on the side of the road.
“He’s too young, Darce…and even if he wasn’t…I’m so firmly off the omega dating market, I’ve been discontinued. I’m not looking for anything right now.”
Tony found that he kind of liked having the ability to make the alpha blush, and even though it wasn’t a feeling that he wanted to inspect too closely, he couldn’t resist teasing Steve a little further by saying, “Alright. You’re the trained lifeguard here. You know best.”
“No, no, it’s fine. Just not what I expected, considering whenever you picked me up for swimming lessons you always waited in the SUV. Though, in hindsight, I really should’ve seen this coming, because you’re a class act, and a gentleman and all that, and of course you’d pick me up at my door...and, uh, I’m babbling already, aren’t I? Please stop me.”
It didn’t make any sense but he felt almost...betrayed...that Steve hadn’t tried to reach out to him—which was crazy, because he should’ve been happy that the alpha had stopped pursuing him. After all, it had been Tony’s choice to end their inappropriate friendship. And it wasn’t like he’d changed his mind about that.
“This doctor was able to create an artificial heart valve out of engineered tissue. The procedure was highly experimental and a breakthrough at the time. It was written about in a ton of medical journals after the surgery was deemed a success, which I gotta admit, kinda cool, right? I can remember my mom taking me to some routine checkups as I got a bit older. I always passed them with flying colors. I haven’t had a single complication since.”
He banished all thoughts of Steve looking devastatingly handsome in a tux before his imagination could make a liar out of him.
Stephen Strange. Tony had met the surgeon years later. The doctor had attended a handful of his parents’ swanky parties throughout his childhood.
Unable to resist picturing it, he saw himself tucked against Steve’s unfairly well-muscled chest; the alpha’s strong arms wrapped securely around him. His instincts rose up in a desperate whine, clawing at him to say yes.
Steve’s grin broadened until it was blinding. It was so infectious Tony couldn’t help but smile back.
“Nonsense. That only happened one time. And Riccardo was a very trustworthy man.” Her tone exhibited the first hint of humanity since her arrival when she added, “Your father and I haven’t been back there. Not without you. It hasn’t felt right.”
“You’re still at risk for—” Steve’s eyes darted to Nat, and his words cut off like he didn’t want to alarm her, before he repeated sternly, “You need to get checked out.”
He knew that his lack of oxygen, and the accumulating levels of carbon dioxide in his blood, would rapidly lead to him losing consciousness. He knew that his heart would struggle, becoming less and less effective at pumping blood throughout his body, until it eventually stopped.
. “You and your abs of steel and ridiculous blue eyes better start staying at least six feet away from me at all times. We’re done here. Get out of my way.”
wrong—but he didn’t know how to pull himself back from the brink. Didn’t know how to wake himself up.
“Aw, you’re so responsible. Always taking care of me. Could that stem from your deeply repressed daddy kink, perhaps?”
Sloshing through the water, he made a beeline for the ladder and heaved himself out, sending a chilly blast of air against his too sensitive skin.
“You’re fucking kidding me,” Steve swore at the TV. “What the hell was that? That pisshole umpire wouldn’t know a foul ball if it hit him in the face.”
Even if Steve-The-Alpha wasn’t almost 10 years younger than him, he’d never want Tony. Disgraced omegas didn’t get happy endings. They didn’t get
“Yeah...I probably shouldn't have done that. Father dearest had to open his wallet and bribe the school board with a ‘charitable donation’ to keep me from getting expelled.”
“Your mother?” Tony repeated. “But that makes you…oh, you’re Bucky’s brother.” It seemed embarrassingly obvious now that he’d realized it. Bucky was always chasing after Steve in a manner reminiscent of a younger sibling at the pool. And while the two didn’t exactly look alike, they had the same stubborn, mischievous glint in their eyes that must have been a Rogers family trait.
The house was modestly sized but nice, with a freshly cut green lawn, a basketball net hanging over the garage, and a bicycle lying on the driveway. Unlike the cold, too perfect mansion Tony had grown up in, it looked like a warm, welcoming family home.
She hesitated for a second, but then nodded, her bottom lip trembling. “You looked like you were sleepin’ but you wouldn’t wake up.”
Nat stilled, as if her excitement was too much to process at once, and then she tore off towards the front door like she couldn’t understand why they weren’t at the park already.
Steve had kissed Tony like he mattered. He’d made Tony feel cherished and wanted. Two feelings that were so foreign to Tony he’d scarcely been able to recognize them.
“Well, I think that tiny overlap might be your problem. Your situation is rare, but I’ve come across it before. Suppressants have been known to lessen in effectiveness if the omega taking them is in close contact with a highly compatible alpha. Sometimes the omegas even start experiencing heats again.”
The outdoor pool was nicer than Tony had thought it’d be. It was well-maintained, fenced off, and surrounded by greenery. There was a slide, a diving board, and multiple ladders. The water was a sparkling blue and the deep end was sectioned off by rope dividers. There was also plenty of space on the pool deck for lounging around.
The alpha slid in front of them like a six-foot-plus human shield. The action sent a tidal wave of water at Bucky so high it left him coughing and spitting chlorine out of his mouth. Nat giggled and stuck out her tongue at Bucky.
“I’m cold,” Tony said pointedly, hardly believing he’d been reduced to such bad seduction tactics. Even Molly Ringwald would make fun of him for this.
She’d made no mention of what his father had done to him. But then, she never did. She’d perfected the art of looking the other way.
Tony had always been too sensitive for dear old Howie, even before he’d presented as an omega. As if, deep down, his dad had already known the truth.
Having this much contact with a highly compatible omega—and not being given any relief or allowances to claim him—had to be costing Steve. If he felt anywhere near as wound up as Tony, he’d be teetering on the razor’s edge of his control.
“Eh, it wasn’t all bad. I had Jarvis—” until Howard had fired him for showing Tony preferential treatment, that is, “—and Rhodey.” His sourpatch had been the only person who’d cared enough to see through the cracks in Tony’s outwardly perfect homelife. Adding, “Rhodey’s pretty much the coolest person in the world, so as far as I look at it, I struck gold in the best friend department.”
Steve finished paying and turned to Tony with an arm full of Tony’s snacks. He took one look at Tony and his eyes narrowed. “What’s wrong?”
Tony fought down the pathetic thrill that shot through him. Feigning indifference, he said, “Captain Who?”
Not too long ago, any scenario involving Steve and his pheromones would’ve been a nightmare for Tony.
Steve was staring up at Tony from between Tony’s parted thighs, his mouth shiny with Tony’s wetness, powerful muscles corded from the strain of holding still. Possessive fingers gripped Tony’s upper thigh; the teen’s hand bigger than the leg it was wrapped around.
Geez. Her and her newfound obsession with him and Steve walking down the aisle—as if that was in any danger of happening. Disgraced omegas weren’t allowed to be legally mated without being granted permission by the courts.
As soon as he’d arrived back at his apartment, he had showered and changed out of the jersey. It was currently buried in the back of his closet. He’d had to hide it to ensure that he didn’t do anything even more embarrassing. Like not so accidentally sleeping in it. Or burying his face in it and inhaling the alpha’s scent and becoming slick all over again.
He hadn’t seen or heard from Steve in five days. Five days, thirteen hours, forty-four minutes, and twenty-six seconds to be exact, but who was counting?
“I wished for it.” The words were barely audible. Broken. His eyes locked on her image in a thousand-yard stare. “I made it happen.”
Greedy and possessed by filthy, filthy thoughts of Steve throwing him down and driving his thick shaft into him. Knotting him and getting him so good and full of his hot come that it’d be seeping out of him for days.
Highly compatible. Of all the bad luck in the world, he and Steve had to be highly fucking compatible.
“I’m not pining.” As for checking his phone ten times an hour, she was exaggerating. It was more like five.
The alpha buried his head between Tony’s legs. His tongue found Tony’s slick with a low groan, and Tony’s brain devolved into a single thought loop of
Tony bristled at the teenager’s attempt to lay a claim on him. “Only if that goes both ways, buddy.”
Nat had wanted to help out, so he’d lent her a little lab coat and protective goggles, too. Then he’d assigned her the task of picking the color of the adhesive. She hadn’t been satisfied simply sitting back and watching Bruce work, however. And because the girl was frighteningly good at stealth, she’d sneakily managed to tamper with the ingredients without anyone seeing her do it.
The ice cream parlor they’d chosen was a popular local hot spot around town. It was constantly bustling with people.
Tony’s comeback died on the tip of his tongue as he caught the unpleasant sight of his reflection in the mirror on the wall. Not surprisingly, he looked small and flustered and his face was drawn and pale. He turned his eyes away.
God, he must’ve been out of his mind to have agreed to this. So out of his mind that he didn’t care to find his missing sanity.
“The problem is that I said no,” Tony said stiffly. He tried to yank his arm free, but Brock’s grip only tightened. Apparently, the assholes were out in full force this week. Lucky him.
He tried to kick out with his legs—tried to swim towards the edge of the pool—but he couldn’t move. Ohgodohgodohgod, why couldn’t he move?
“What’s the deal with the wagon?” Darcy Lewis lifted a brow in Tony Stark’s direction where he was escorting a seven-year-old Natasha Romanoff down the sidewalk via a red, Fisher-Price wagon. 10-year-old Bruce Banner trailed silently behind them, his nose in a book.
His phone vibrated on the kitchen counter, and he reached over to grab it, grateful for the distraction. He had three messages from Darcy, one from Rhodey that simply read:
Cheap metal creaked as the alpha hesitantly took a seat in one of the chairs near him. If Tony had been thinking clearly, he might’ve made note of how Steve had granted him space, choosing not to sit in the seat directly next to him, but Tony wasn’t and he didn’t.
The three dots on his screen let Tony know that Steve had started typing, deleted it, and then started again.
She had glossy, shoulder length brown hair and the kind of cheekbones that graced the pages of magazines. Her lips were painted a strawberry red, and her vintage T was tucked fashionably into her high waisted jean shorts.
For all that everyone seemed to believe that omegas were baby obsessed mama-bears who couldn’t wait to provide their alphas with a gaggle of kids, Tony had never wanted any of his own. He’d never pictured himself as a parent, even after he’d presented and the rest of society had tried to force that future on him.
Steve was only attainable in the short term. The teenager’s interest would never last. Tony wasn’t going to set himself up for that kind of heart break. He got attached way too easily. Way, way more attached than anyone ever got to him.
Inhaling him, Steve nosed the back of Tony’s neck. He rumbled deep. “I like it when you smell like me.”
Tony’s feet barely touched the ground as Steve whisked him towards a bench located away from the pool.
“I’m glad,” Steve’s arms tightened. Then, “I will do everything in my power to protect the trust you have in me.”
“I’m okay with that.” The teen’s thumb stroked Tony’s cheek. “I’m not saying no, alright, babe? Just...think it over. Make sure this is what you want.”
Steve, conversely, never withheld affection. If anything, the teenager went out of his way to dote on him.
“I won’t apologize for who I am.” Darcy shrugged. “Is that seriously the only reason you aren’t talking to him anymore? Lame, Tones. Very lame.”
Rhodey and Darcy had snagged the best spot in the yard. They were reclining on chaise lounges, protected from the sun by large trees and a swanky umbrella.
Setting his phone down, Tony tried to stop his knee from bouncing restlessly. The awkward, monotonous silence between him and Steve was starting to get to him. The birds tweeting in the distance might as well have been crickets. He never had been good at keeping his mouth shut. He would have died in A Quiet Place within the first five minutes. “Soooo,” he grasped for something to say, wanting to kick himself for his own lameness. “Beautiful weather we’re having, isn’t it?”
He knew he was being an unfair, ‘woe is me’ jackass, but he couldn’t make himself stop. His brain-to-mouth filter was rusty on the best of days, and after copious amounts of alcohol, it was basically nonexistent.
There was no way Steve showing up now was a coincidence. It had to be in response to their argument. The teen must’ve been trying to prove Tony wrong through his actions. Attempting to show Tony that they
An unwelcome spark of hope flickered in his chest at her words. “I don’t want to hear from him again,” he lied. “It’s better this way.”
“You hafta ask nicely,” Nat corrected him. “Like this, see? Nanny Tony, may we please play video games now?”
Tony and Darcy had front row seats to the Oscar worthy spectacle the kids were putting on in the Romanoff’s backyard. They were sitting under the patio umbrella on the deck, drinking coffee and taking in the nice, morning weather.
He didn’t slow his pace until they were a comfortable enough distance away. Christ, that woman had pissed him off him.
He obviously didn’t want to drag the kids along with him to the emergency room—that was a surefire recipe for disaster—so he arranged for Darcy to look after Bucky, Bruce, and Nat for the rest of the evening. Only, Nat didn’t want to let him leave.
“I almost drowned when I was a kid.” He tried to sound more casual than he felt.  “Never much cared for the water since.”
“Wasn’t it?” It was easier to focus on his anger than all the wrong ways the 18-year-old made him feel. It wouldn’t be the first time his mouth had gotten him into trouble anyway. He was forever being accused of being ‘too difficult’ and ‘argumentative’. Just ask Obie.
“Oh.” Tony blushed hard, his chest giving an uncomfortable squeeze because he still wasn’t used to emotions of the warm and fuzzy variety. “Okay, then.”
“He texts you back at the speed of light,” Darcy said, like Tony was being deliberately obtuse. “That boy is whipped.”
His instincts were in bliss, ready for him to roll over and display his belly in submission. The rest of him wanted to argue that Steve’s pride was misplaced.
“Hurry up, Nanny Tony, you’re too slow,” Natasha tugged at his hand, attempting to drag him behind her. She’d been bouncing along at the pace of a speed demon since they’d left the house. He was having to practically jog to keep up with her. “I’m not gettin’ any younger.”
He wanted to touch more than just Steve’s wrist. He wanted to trace his fingers up all the veins and corded muscle in his forearm. Wanted to slide his hands under the edge of his lifeguard tank; to explore every last rock-hard inch of his abdomen.
“Last time we were here, did I do something wrong? You didn’t want to—not that you always have to, uh, be in the mood to fool around, but...was it something I did?”
Tony gazed blearily at the closed door. Why wasn’t the alpha breaking it down? Why was Steve helping him?
Something raw and painful clenched inside him. He could feel his mind dragging him down into the dark place. Into that-which-he-did-not-think-about.
And if an unwitting part of Tony couldn’t seem to stop his eyes from lingering on how bronzed, tall, and gorgeous Steve looked in his red lifeguard uniform…well, he could hardly be blamed for that. It would’ve taken a saint to ignore the play of muscles shifting under Steve’s skin. Traps. Delts. Pecs. Even his thighs were tree trunks. Perfect for an omega to sit astride. Which was a weirdly specific thought to have and Tony was not at all the omega in that scenario. Really, he wasn’t.
“Ugh,” Darcy’s face scrunched in distaste. “It looks like she’s found her newest target. Poor Steve.”
Disgraced omegas were branded with a single, black barcode on the back of their necks. Barren omegas were branded with a red one. Getting them removed or covering them up was illegal.
Lowering the phone from his ear, Tony stared down at it. It was bothering him that Natasha hadn’t acted like herself.
Inhaling the heavenly aroma of roasted coffee beans, Tony hesitantly brought the drink to his nose. On one hand, yay, free coffee. But on the other…he had a cardinal rule never to accept drinks from people he didn't trust. And unlike the time at Steve’s house, where he’d been able to watch the alpha make the drink, he couldn’t confirm that it was safe.
The alpha would be leaving on a football scholarship in September. Tony’s time with him already had a built-in expiration date. He’d no doubt quickly become the big man on campus and forget all about the disgraced omega he’d spent a couple weeks chasing over the summer. Steve was sure to meet more omegas he was highly compatible with, and thus Tony’s life would return to its regularly scheduled programming.
How long, Tony worried, would Steve’s patience last? How long before he got fed up with Tony stringing him along night after night and decided to seek out one of the many omegas available to him who were willing to finish the job?
“Power cables,” Steve nodded, confidence slipping back in place—his brief flash of uncertainty disappearing so fast that Tony was left wondering if he’d imagined it. “Noted. You ready to go?”
Tony hadn’t missed the storm cloud that had been brewing over Steve’s head the longer he’d watched Tony chum it up with Rhodey.
“Seriously. Knock it off. Or we’re going to take you out for salads instead of ice cream,” Tony warned them.
And why was Steve explaining himself to Tony like Tony was some overeager girlfriend who’d devolve into a tailspin if Steve didn’t text him back for a few hours?
Tony wasn’t clear on why that particular memory had such a hold over him. It was far from the worst thing that had ever happened to him. His life had gotten progressively harder from that day forward.
“I don’t think that’s a good idea,” Tony mumbled, attempting to let him down easy. “I haven’t read it myself, but I’d hazard a guess that staying the night is frowned upon in the Buddies With Benefits rulebook.”
Shrugging, Tony attempted to appear nonchalant. “I ran into him at the movies the other night. He was there with a couple of girls.”
“God, your scent,” the teen panted thickly. He sounded drunk on it. Pained. As if it was taking Herculean effort to hold himself back.
Their face-off quickly set forth a chain of events that led to Thor retrieving a football from the garage.
When Tony stiffened slightly, Darcy added, “You can continue to deny it, but the answer is painfully obvious and written all over your face. So, what happened? Why’s your teenage shadow suddenly missing in action?” Her expression darkened as something seemed to occur to her. “Wait...did he do something? Something that means I need to kick his ass?”
“Don’t bother denying it. You can’t help that you won the genetic lottery. That everyone bends over backwards for you because you’re Mr. Alpha Wonderful. I bet you’ve never come across a single person in your entire life who’s disliked you. Who hasn’t wanted to hand you everything.”
Incredulity flashed across Brock’s face—like he couldn’t quite believe Tony’s willingness to talk back—and then he practically snarled, turning red with rage.
Lord, give him strength. This much sappy cuteness coming from the alpha was going to give him heart palpitations soon. And he really didn’t need that considering his medical history.
“Oh, don’t even try to act innocent, little lady. Your mom told me you set Nanny Patricia’s dress on fire.”
Sure, Steve had reacted to his pheromones. But that didn’t mean anything. Alphas were biologically programmed to respond to an omega’s scent.
Steve’s brow tightened like he was personally offended. Like he was the #1 member of the Tony Stark Fanclub and it was his job to defend Tony’s honor. “You shouldn’t spend so much time wishing to be something else. You’re amazing, Tony. The things you can create. The things you do. You’re smart as hell. It intimidates me, sometimes, how smart you are. I feel like a bonehead next to you. Talking to you is kinda like going three rounds in a boxing ring but that’s why I like it. You ripped that woman in the park a new one when she came after Bucky, and you just told me off in front of the entire hospital. You’re hardly what I’d call an omega in distress.”
Tony’s home wasn’t dirty, really, it was just busy. He had too many ideas, too many inventions he intended to work on, too many nuts and bolts lying around, and not nearly enough space for them all.
“You can’t call me that.” Steve’s body had been shaking with fine tremors, his fists clenched so hard his knuckles were white. His voice had been so gruff it had sounded distorted. “I don’t - I don’t trust myself when you call me that.”
Thumb sweeping Tony’s cheek, the teen placed a small kiss on Tony’s jaw, then another at the corner of his mouth, before stopping and hovering there.
Their hands locked and Steve pulled Tony bodily from the water, lifting him like he weighed nothing. Which, as far as Steve’s unfairly superior muscles were concerned, was probably true, considering Steve had just borne the entirety of Tony’s weight with one arm and no sign of effort.
Steve Rogers was standing in front of him. Lifeguard Steve. Stupidly gorgeous, ‘should be at the pool’ Steve. The new bane of his existence.
“Thank you.” The woman gave Tony’s ID card back to him. “Go have a seat. One of our doctors will be with you shortly.”
year, she blocked me. And that pretty much sums up my last month. Other than meeting you, of course.” There. What teenager could possibly find any of that stuff appealing? Hopefully Steve would see how ill-suited they were and would stop talking to him.
Knowing that he shouldn't, Tony lifted his head and peeked at the alpha. His eyes immediately locked with Steve’s, making Tony’s stomach bottom out and his mouth go dry. God, the alpha
a dark whisper echoed, lingering on the fringes of his mind. It called him unworthy. Accused him of being the omega slut Obie had always said he was.
There was no reason to involve Steve. Especially when the alpha would not be a fan of the ‘ignoring it’ method.
Before long, he found himself in Steve’s lap, panting into his mouth and unbearably turned on. His nipples had hardened into sensitive peaks and he was soaked in slick. The alpha had the back of Tony’s shirt fisted into one large hand, his lips devouring Tony’s like he needed Tony instead of oxygen to live.
Before he could finish sinking into a deep depression, a wonderfully unexpected smell interrupted his thoughts. Bacon. And coffee.
After cleaning his plate—his stomach much more settled now that it was no longer empty—Tony excused himself to take a shower. Getting washed up, brushing his teeth, and changing his clothes went a long way towards helping him feel less like a reanimated corpse. His headache had reduced to more of a dull throbbing—something he didn’t want to give Steve’s terrible concoction credit for.
Of course, the wince didn’t go unnoticed by the alpha. “How are you feeling?” Steve demanded, looking like he was a hair-trigger away from snatching Tony up and inspecting him for any sign of injury like the world’s most overprotective parent. “Are you dizzy at all?  Nauseous? Is your head hurting you? You inhaled a lot of water…”
It was quite a nice house, actually, now that he was looking. It was clean and orderly and had an old-fashioned, rustic feel. Most of the furniture was vintage or made of wood and the walls were painted in earthy, cream tones. A collection of family portraits hung over the hall table. In one picture, a blond boy had his arms around a chubby cheeked toddler Bucky. Tony thought it was Steve at first glance, but quickly dismissed it. The kid was too skinny, tiny, and anemic—as though he was suffering from some kind of health issues—to be the alpha. Perhaps the photo was of another brother or a cousin, then.
Lifting the heavy curtain of brown hair off her neck, Darcy fanned her face with her free hand. “It’s about time they opened the pool,” she remarked as they approached the aforementioned community center. “If this heat wave gets any worse, I’m going to spontaneously combust. Tell Jane to bury me with my record collection. And that I lied when I said I never read her journal.”
The teen was breathing heavier, desire continuing to strain his face. “Hey, don’t do that. Of course I do. What part of ‘I always want you' didn’t you understand?” He heaved another breath, seeming to wrestle with himself before he was able to get the next words out. “Fuck. I can’t believe I’m saying this... but it was an emotional night. You're particularly vulnerable right now. Ask me again in a couple of days.”
“Meaning, you approve of your present?” He was proud of himself for sounding relatively calm despite the desperate chant of
“Eh. Tomayto, tomahto. Now you’re just splitting hairs.” Addressing the small crowd of strangers still gathered around him, “I mean, seriously? What’s with all the long faces? I’m alive and well, and as good as new. There’s nothing to see here, folks. Move along.”
Tony would’ve protested that comment—it’d sounded a little too much like ownership not to set off his alarm bells—but Steve had swooped in and slammed his mouth over Tony’s, kissing the daylights out of him. Tony had quickly forgotten why he’d wanted to object.
“I may or may not have set up a small business under your name so that I could make a little money on the side.”
He must’ve said something that had managed to help. Maybe he was getting half decent at this whole nanny thing.
Steve was in violation of Tony’s no possessive alpha bullshit rule. Tony had half a mind to call things off with the teen right now.
Could Rhodey be under the impression that was how Steve was treating Tony? It wouldn’t take Rhodey long to get his feathers in a bunch if he mistakenly thought Steve was refusing to make an honest omega out of him.
In some ways, she’d been a crueler parent to him than Howard had. Howard had never given Tony anything aside from his disdain and disappointment. Tony had quickly learned to expect nothing from his father.
“Hey, buddy, are you alright?” the man repeated. He reached out a big hand as if to help Tony up, but Tony dodged it, scrambling to his feet.
For a second, as Rhodey and Steve sized each other up, Tony was certain that an alpha smackdown was about to break out right there in the middle of the lawn.
Tony threw his arms around Steve’s neck, practically climbing him like a tree to make up for their height difference. Because, god, he
, he wanted to add, but he never got the chance, because he was undercut by Steve’s much louder, much more insistent, “Yes.”
He had to undo whatever it was he’d done. He couldn’t lose Steve now. Tony was supposed to have more time.
At the hard glint of determination in Steve’s eyes, Tony felt the rest of his protests disappear in his throat. He was clearly facing down an unstoppable fucking force here. The alpha looked ready to die on this hill. Or worse.
“Well, I suppose I could let you wine and dine me,” Tony tried to play it cool, which wasn’t easy when his nerves were treating his stomach like a jungle gym. “Since you’ve been asking so nicely…”
The only thing he wanted was to lock himself inside his incredibly small lab in his even shittier apartment and forget this day ever happened.
Since Tony was fifteen years old, he’d wasted countless hours futilely wishing he’d presented differently. But, for the first time, he found himself making a different wish. A wish in which he was still an omega.
. It might not have been the teen’s cock, but a part of the teenager was already inside him. They were connected in the most intimate sense.
He didn’t want to believe that Steve had been talking about him, but most of the arrow signs were pointing towards yes. Tony may have been on good terms with his old friend Denial, but he wasn’t completely oblivious. As he reflected on every interaction he’d ever had with the teen, he found himself facing the very distinct possibility that Steve Rogers was pursuing him.
Obie had tried to control him under the guise of taking care of him. The damage had already been done before Tony had finally figured out the difference. The older man hadn’t loved him anymore than his parents had.
All these years later, and that comment still stung. He beat the hurt back, forcing himself to continue talking, “I was afraid of the water and he—he didn’t like that. He’d wanted to toughen me up. He had our au pair register me for a bunch of sports lessons, but I ran away and hid whenever it was time to go. When dad got home from his business trip and learned that I hadn’t attended a single lesson, he was…shall we say, less than pleased. He went on his hundredth drunken tirade, yelling that I was a pampered, spoiled child and that he refused to raise a son who was afraid of his own shadow.” Tony remembered apologizing profusely, cowering under Howard’s red-faced anger. But apologizing hadn’t worked. Nothing had ever seemed to lessen Howard’s temper. And then Howard had lunged; had dragged Tony kicking and screaming to their backyard.
The seaside view must’ve gotten to Steve, too, because the alpha hadn’t seemed to take his eyes off of Tony the entire time they were there. (The teen had also been inordinately pleased by Tony’s effort to prepare him food. Which, come on, chopped vegetables was hardly a full-course meal.) It hadn’t mattered what subject Tony had rambled on about, Steve had hung onto his every word as if Tony was the most fascinating creature on Earth and the entire solar system, besides.
Tony took a step back. “I-I’m still too old for you,” he protested feebly. “I’m over the hill. Old enough to be your father.”
Too make matters worse, it was as if Steve somehow knew Tony had a weakness for him in blue, because he was wearing a blue jersey with his name across the back, and a matching baseball cap of the same color. His broad shoulders were so wide they were practically casting a shadow over the park, and he was holding two cups of Starbucks.
“I heard you the first time,” Tony wheezed, trying to hide a wince as he inhaled sharply through his still sore lungs.
How was he supposed to wake up in the morning with the knowledge that Steve was out there in the world, and that Tony couldn’t be with him? That Steve’s true mate was someone else?
“I wanted to hear your voice,” Steve admitted, sounding so earnest that Tony suddenly had to stop his pathetic, abused heart from growing three sizes like he was a character in one of Natasha’s favorite Dr. Seuss books.
“I told you we should’ve gone out of town.” This was exactly what Tony had wanted to avoid. He was trying hard not to overreact, but he was fast approaching another embarrassing panic spiral. “I don’t think you fully recognize what happened back there. You may as well have just changed your Facebook status to ‘in a relationship’. That Killian kid said you were on the football team with his brother. He
, his brain input unhelpfully. He couldn’t even blame that one on Darcy. That thought had been all him.
“Is it the third period yet?” Tony complained. “This game feels like it’s never going to end.” It’d been at least five minutes since Steve had kissed him, and that was five minutes too long.
“I’ll take that as a yes. Did your symptoms start around the same time you met this new alpha?” Jane pushed on professionally.
It was ridiculous how quickly Tony’s self-preservation crumbled. How badly he wanted to believe that Steve could fit into this part of his life. That they could be a normal couple.
“You gonna offer to buy me from them yourself?” Tony sneered. “Nobly offer me your mating contract? ‘Cause it won’t work, pal. You haven’t amassed enough of a fortune t’ interest them as a suitor. Filthy rich is the only language they know.”
“I have to be on my way. I’m meeting Mrs. Watson for some schnapps. You have a good rest of your day now.” She clacked away on her modest heels as suddenly as she’d appeared, purse swinging over her stooped shoulder.
It was boyish and annoyingly endearing and Tony quickly found his defenses deflating. “We’re not in the pool.”
Their small group of four drew the usual stares upon entering. It never failed to offend complete strangers that Steve would associate with a disgraced omega. Luckily, when out with Steve—as opposed to being alone—a disapproving side-eye or two was about the extent of what Tony had to deal with.
He stared at her, shocked and yet, unfortunately, also entirely unsurprised by the words that had come out of her mouth.
“I don’t think anyone could ever really keep up with you, Tony. But I’ll watch all the old movies you want me to, if that’ll make you happy.”
He’d have to be more careful about disguising the true nature of his relationship with the alpha going forward. She was too close to catching on.
The teenager went statue still, his muscles locking up like he’d been turned to stone. His eyes were cautious, as though he was bracing himself for Tony to declare the kiss another mistake.
Tony seized the chance to distract Rhodey. “Gee, I wonder who that could be? I thought we were all here. Is Nebula coming?”
Just thought I’d leave a quick warning here. If you’ve read this far, I’m pretty sure you know what that-which-he-did-not-think-about is in reference to.
Normally, Tony would’ve slipped back into his sarcastic armor. Would’ve made some cutting remark about valedictorians and Steve’s ability to give a hell of a speech.
Bucky pouted until he noticed that his and Tony’s back and forth was making Nat giggle. At which point, his pout quickly melted away.
Tony fought the urge to flinch as the tattoo on the back of his neck suddenly flared with a remembered, phantom pain.
“Then you know they’re only temporary. You’ve survived them before. I know they’re scary, but I’m gonna help talk you through it. I used to get nasty asthma attacks when I was younger, and breathing exercises really helped me cope. I’d like you to breathe for me, okay? Take a deep breath and try to hold it for three seconds. When you exhale, let it out slowly for another three seconds, and then repeat those steps.”
He’d gotten so used to negativity, insults, and criticism that he’d become his own biggest critic. Anything else seemed unnatural to him.
“M’bad. Technological difficulties—uh, message didn’t go through. Sorry ‘bout dragging you all the way out here, but our plans are still canceled. We’ll reschedule for a later date. Great. All settled. Bye now.”
“That was my mother. She was planning on being here but got called into work.” Humor tugged at the alpha’s mouth as he swung the door open wider. “You have the right house.”
When her mate turned his back to resume overseeing the grill, Jane snuck Tony a thumbs up and mouthed the words ‘good job.’ Then she retrieved the bottle of beer from Thor with a swat on his shoulder and returned it to Steve.
Tony jumped when a light knock sounded on his front door. Quickly cleaning the blood from his face, he hid the tissue in the bottom of his waste bin. He knew the alpha would be worried if he found out the truth, and Tony wasn’t ready to spend the day arguing with the teen over the stupid things he put his body through.
There’d been an omega boy he’d started growing close to at finishing school…but their housemaster had caught them during their one and only kiss. They’d both been severely punished and the boy had been sent away, never to be heard from again. The school upheld the belief that omegas were designed by nature to belong only to alphas. The boy had been accused of trying to ‘taint’ Obie’s property.
He swore he could feel his heart pounding harder with every step he took towards the building. It practically jumped out of his chest as they walked through the door.
He took another swallow of Steve’s terrible concoction. “You're the only person who can get away with giving me a cup of coffee this bad,” he huffed grudgingly.
She’d screamed loud enough to burst Tony’s eardrums, clutching handfuls of his wet shirt into her tiny fists. “No! No! I wanna stay with Nanny Tony!”
Tony knew all too well what he was still at risk for. Hypoxemia (low levels of oxygen in his blood), pneumonia, or a buildup of fluid in his lungs. The last one was particularly ghastly, as it could cause him to still drown even hours after he’d been pulled from the water.
He’d known the teen would be on the larger side, but, good god. That wasn’t a penis. That was a weapon of mass destruction.
He had a strict policy against the teenager staying the night. He knew he’d have to send Steve home soon, but he couldn’t bear to be separated from him yet—not after that.
Tony flushed. “Uh. Right. Inside. We’re coming inside.” As he stepped into the small entrance hall, he half expected the robot from
Steve’s purrs deepened into a rolling growl. He nipped Tony’s lower abdomen with his teeth. His hands found the waistband of Tony’s jeans, and Tony wriggled his hips, aiding the teenager as the alpha divested him of the last remaining barrier.
But Tony knew better. Tony was the one who had been sold off by his parents before his sixteenth birthday.
Tony scoffed, assuming that Darcy was just messing with him, until the alpha’s shadow inevitably fell over him. “Tony—hey,” Steve’s deep voice rolled through him.
Tony tried not to be too obvious about melting into his arms. At least he managed to stifle any happy little sighs.
Their tongues met in a hot, wet caress, stoking the fire under Tony’s skin into a frenzy. The alpha tasted so good it was making him lightheaded. He could smell the faint trace of chlorine on Steve’s skin from the pool. Tony shivered, a moan breaking free from his throat.
Tony didn’t know Thor personally, but he sounded like one of the few loyal alphas out there. Omegas weren’t taught to expect monogamy from their mates. They were taught that alphas had ‘needs’ and that those needs often required more than their partners could give them. Tony couldn’t imagine too many men—or women—turning Amara down.
He’d gone so far as to deliberately lock Tony away from the outside world in order to keep him reliant on whatever crumbs the older man had chosen to toss his way.
. He couldn’t actually make himself say the word so he skipped on to his next demand. “And I won’t tolerate any possessive alpha bullshit.”
“Apologize to this woman’s daughter,” he told Nat curtly. “We don’t use violence to solve our problems. Even against bullies who have picked up an unfortunate set of traits from their parents.”
“No, no, no.” Tony’s voice was edged with hysteria. He had no idea what he was saying. “I d-don’t want—please—stay away.”
“The new Nick Fury action flick.” Nick Fury was a big Hollywood star. He was best known for his series of popular spy movies.
His reflexes were having none of it. He lost his footing and crashed into his desk, despite Steve reaching out and catching him to lessen the impact. The mini collision sent a bunch of papers tumbling to the floor.
Opening himself up to physical intimacy with Steve was a bit like navigating a minefield. He desired Steve above everything, but he could still feel Obadiah’s hooks in him, keeping him trapped in the past.
“I’ve got this,” Darcy butted in. “Everyone, this is our new friend, Steve. Be nice to our new friend. He’s a lifeguard at the pool Tony and I have been going to all summer. Though he’s definitely gotten to know Tony better than me, if you know what I mean.”
“I’ve got to run to the not-so-little girls’ room.” Darcy got up from her lounge chair. “Be right back.”
“Well,” the beta mother sniffed dismissively as she helped her sobbing offspring off the ground. “It’s no wonder my Emmaline got confused. This child has a completely inappropriate haircut for a young boy. You should take him to the barber and get a nice, clean, masculine cut. And take that…” she pointed to his mermaid crown like it personally offended her, “…that
“You and I spoke once or twice after his games,” Killian forged on. Everything about him was broadcasting that he believed Steve could do much better than Tony and that he'd be only too happy to volunteer as tribute. “You’re...you’re really good. We all think you’re gonna go pro. Anyways, it’s been great seeing you again, QB. You know where to look for me if you ever need some company.”
How was it possible that he was capable of doing math that could make Albert Einstein’s head spin, yet he couldn’t act normal around one (admittedly gorgeous) eighteen-year-old?
Tony’s instincts were being their usual traitorous selves. They were too busy eating up the attention Steve was giving him to notice the underpinnings of ownership in his behavior.
“You have nothing to be sorry about,” Steve said strongly. “You haven’t done anything wrong. I’m the one who… I should have controlled myself better.” There was a pause before he repeated, “Now, I need you to listen to me, okay? Have you ever had a panic attack before?”
But then he reminded himself that this was Steve, and that Steve was the ultimate antithesis of Obie. And surely enough, whatever had come over the teenager seemed to pass. The aggression levels in the air de-escalated.
“I think he’d rather have Peggy do it,” Tony sniped, surprised by how uncharacteristically catty he sounded.
“Tasha!” Bucky cried back. They were clutching each other like a pair of Siamese twins who couldn’t bear to be separated.
Challenge accepted. He was going to make Steve eat his words. “Well, since becoming a nanny, I’ve been finding my priorities shifting at an alarming rate. Every day I slip a little more into Suzie Homemaker mode. I spend my days cooking, cleaning, and sorting laundry. My google search history is full of endless questions like ‘How to trick kids into eating vegetables,’ and ‘How to get grape juice and grass stains out of white clothing.’ Recently, I tried inventing my own cleaning solvent. I shared it online, but MomOfTheYear09 claimed that it didn’t work—even though she clearly hadn’t followed my directions correctly—and when I asked her why she wasn’t Mom of The Year
“Oh, real nice!” Tony shouted ineffectually after him. “Where are your parents? I’m going to have a talk with them!” Though he doubted the brat’s parents would actually care.
He and Rhodey had been invited to attend Darcy and Jane’s barbeque. Jane and her mate, Thor, were hosting it in their backyard.
“Good.” There was another pause and the barest hint of movement outside the door. “So, this happened about five years ago, around Christmas. It was the best of times, it was the worst of times…Buck used to have a big problem with biting. He chomped on damn near everyone. My mom wanted to get a photo of him on Santa’s lap, but she was too afraid that he’d bite the poor guy. Dad decided to secretly take Buck anyway, because he'd planned on giving her the photo as a surprise. He ended up dragging me along with him, and we waited in line for hours. Finally, it was Buck’s turn, and he was all happy to see Santa, and everything was working out, and right as they took the picture—WHAM—he projectile vomited butternut squash all over Mr. Kringle and his elf. The elf screamed, the other children screamed, and it started a chain reaction of puke. Kids were crying and vomiting. Parents were freaking out. The guy posing as Santa quit on the spot. We never ended up getting the photo, but it turned out to be okay, because when we confessed it all to mom, she was just happy Bucky hadn’t bitten anyone.”
The heat that flared to life in Steve’s eyes sent a shot of lust straight to Tony’s cock. Voice deep and husky, the alpha challenged, “Don’t we?”
marry alphas. They can marry betas or other omegas, too. Or they don’t have to marry anyone. They can stay single if that’s what makes them happy. Same goes for alphas and betas.”
It gave him a rush of power. Made him feel completely different from the helpless victim he’d been with Obie.
There wasn’t an alpha alive who’d like the thought of the omega they were involved with carrying another man’s child, past tense or not. The teen’s instincts would demand Obie’s head on a spike. And that wasn’t even taking into account everything
“What are we under arrest for?” Steve sputtered through a surprised laugh, holding up a large hand to stop more water from hitting his face.
One woman was even filming Tony on her phone, as if his trauma was little better than entertainment for her social media followers.
“I’m sorry, Steve,” the younger guard begged. “I was distracted. It’s a big pool. I didn’t know he was in trouble.”
“I appreciate the offer. But as much as I’d love to be the only grown man wearing water wings in the pool, I don’t think they’d help. I don’t like the water.”
Steve quelled Tony with an impatient glance and Tony had to stop himself from shrinking back too, because Angry-Steve was honestly kind of scary. No, actually, make that
“No. It isn’t fair. But that doesn’t mean you should accept it. You need to push forward, fight back.”
Upping his game? That did not bode well. Stomach swarming with butterflies of dread, he hurriedly looked at the screen to assess the damage. This is what ‘he’ had texted Steve:
“Have you ever wanted something so much it scared you?” he mumbled drowsily. “Like...like you’re afraid of being happy? Afraid to feel it. Or say it out loud. Or even let it exist, because—because the moment you do, you’ll have it taken away from you, the way you lost everything else? Have you ever...have you ever wanted anything that much?”
Apparently not rare enough. Mother nature sure liked kicking him when he was down. He was a magnet for trouble. This was just the kind of ludicrous, disastrous situation only he could find himself in.
His instincts urged him to reassure the alpha in return. He listened to them. “You don’t have to worry about Rhodey, either. He couldn’t be more my brother if we’d shared the same womb. He’s protective because, for pretty much my entire life, he’s been the only person around to look after me. My parents were gone all the time. I was alone in that big house without any brothers or sisters. I wasn’t allowed to have friends Howard didn’t approve of, and most of the people who did try to befriend me had ulterior motives. They didn’t like
“You’re a big, ugly goon, and you’re not nearly as good at football as everyone says you are!” Bucky failed to dunk Steve’s head under the water.
“Oh, uh, sorry,” Killian stuttered, face revealing shock at having his advances shut down in defense of a disgraced omega. “I-I didn’t realize.”
He could still feel the mortifying evidence of his slick drying on the back of his thighs—making his walk of shame even worse as he tentatively pushed open the door and slid into the hallway.
Tony thought he caught a flinch before Steve closed his expression off. “Did you hate it that much?” he asked.
Tony didn’t think that would help. He had a suspicion of what would, but he wasn’t sure he was ready for drastic measures yet.
I haven't written anything of a ~steamy~ nature in a while so apologies if it sucks (pun somewhat intended).
“Cutting off all contact with the alpha would work,” Jane continued, “but if that’s not what you want, and you’re worried about contraception, I could prescribe you some birth control pills.”
Stuffing his wallet back into his pocket, Tony adjusted his black cap over his eyes. He had to meet Steve at the pool in 20 minutes. The teenager had asked him out for a second time—Steve wanted to take him somewhere to eat—and Tony hadn’t really given him a definitive answer yet. He was obviously going to say no…but, well, he just hadn’t gotten around to it yet. For reasons that he was in no way starting to waver on.
. Dear god, he was in no way prepared for the full force of Steve’s stupid, alpha magnetism all up close and personal again. He’d barely escaped it the first time.
Steve and Bucky had left Nat’s about an hour before her parents had arrived home. Tony had fixed the Romanoff’s dinner and then hotfooted it back to his apartment to prepare for his night out with Steve. He’d barely made it through his door before he’d received a text from the alpha, notifying him that Steve was on his way.
Bucky had brought notebooks and pencil crayons outside for him and Natasha to use. The bickering twosome had lasted all of five minutes before growing bored. (“I can draw better than you!” “No,
Nor would he have let Steve tank his own reputation by parading a disgraced omega around in front of his friends.
Picturing Steve slaking his needs with someone else filled Tony with a stinging impulse to grab his blowtorch and set something on fire.
Steve’s head jerked up. His shoulders had seemed to deflate the longer Tony had taken to reply, but now...now he looked anything but unhappy. Awe and hope were plain on his face.
The gesture hadn’t gone unnoticed by Rhodey. He fixed Steve with a truly intimidating military stare. “That’s right, I am. You, on the other hand, he’s told me virtually nothing about. Tell me, Steve, what exactly are your intentions with my friend?”
He opened his mouth. Tried and failed to talk. Then he narrowed his eyes and tried again. “What is this?”
He respected others, regardless of whether they were alphas, betas, or omegas, and treated them like equals. He lifted people up instead of tearing them down.
Steve shrugged, smiling tightly. “I don’t really care what he thinks of the sport as long as I’m his favorite player.”
Darcy snorted like she in no way believed that. “You know, for someone who’s such a genius, you can be breathtakingly dense when you want to be. You’re getting romanced by the hottest, sweetie pie alpha ever and you can’t even appreciate it.”
“Where did you get that?” he coughed, glaring at the hazardous pack of glitter tubes she was holding. He was pretty sure he’d accidentally sucked some of the stuff into his lungs.
“Don’t get me wrong, I love what we’re doing. I’m the luckiest asshole on the planet. It just...it feels like I'm the one reaping all the benefits. I get it. I get you’re not ready. I'm not complaining. But it scares the hell out of me when I think of this being one-sided. You’re not obligated to...you haven’t been doing any of this for me because you feel like you have to, have you?”
Steve’s head snapped up. “I don’t care what anybody else thinks,” he shot back, like he’d tell the whole world to fuck off if he had to. “I like hanging out with you. I don’t want to stop.”
“So pull your chair over here,” Rhodes told him. “Because I’m not rubbing you with aloe vera when you end up burnt to a crisp again.”
The alpha had just claimed Tony publicly in front of someone he’d gone to school with. In front of three teenagers who seemed like the type to thrive on gossip.
I don’t see how that’s possible. You’re built like The Terminator. Only, you know, less Austrian and with a better bone structure.”
His field of vision was swiftly eclipsed by the solid wall of Steve’s chest as the teenager approached him.
Cutting him off, Tony thrust the first aid kit at the alpha’s chest. “Thanks again for the Band-Aid. I’ll be leaving now.”
Tony was assailed with images of that chest heaving over him. Could see Steve pinning him down as he thrust into him.
Steve’s felt more right than anything else had in a very long time—too right for Tony to keep fighting. The powerful muscles that had once left him intimidated didn’t make him nervous anymore. At some point, he’d begun seeing them as a source of security and protection. He was so boneless and relaxed, that for half a moment, he’d nearly convinced himself that he’d started purring.
,” he said too loudly. Then, collecting himself, “I’ll just...I’ll hold onto your wrist or something.”
He’d already brushed his teeth, gargled mouthwash, applied a fresh layer of scent blocker, and sprayed on a light mist of his least offensive bottle of cheap cologne.
He let Steve’s purrs lull him into a state of perfect contentment. A peaceful haze of sleep teased his subconscious, ready to pull him under. The teen’s alpha-generated body heat was better than any blanket, his presence strong and comforting as he held Tony tucked snugly against him. His soft breaths tickled Tony’s nape, his heart a steady, rhythmic beat at Tony’s back.
“Oh, I read that,” Tony nodded. “It was almost as embarrassing as the stuff Hammer Industries publishes.”
“It’s too late to protect my virtue, if that’s what you’re worried about. I already let him get to third base. Wait—third base counts as oral sex, right? ‘Cause I’ve sucked his dick a lot.”
The needy sound grew louder when Steve began a torturously slow exploration of Tony’s chest, licking and sucking kisses across Tony’s already sensitive skin. He paid special attention to Tony’s scar, as though assuring Tony that it didn’t bother him.
It was incredibly important to Tony that Steve respected his wishes in this. How he chose to deal with Obie...if he dealt with Obie...that was up to him. He’d had too many choices taken away from him already. He wouldn’t allow this to become another one.
“I wasn’t…I wasn’t trying to mollycoddle you.” Steve shifted uncomfortably. “If I’ve been out of line…If I’ve been coming on too strong…I haven’t meant to. I know you’re not ready. I know you haven’t had good experiences, that I need to be patient. I’d say I can’t stop thinking about you, but I haven’t actually tried to stop. I don’t really want to. I’d promise to stay away, but…” He paused, his hand tightening into a fist before relaxing again. “…I don’t think I’m your only problem, Tony. I think there’s something else upsetting you.”
At some point, Steve had moved the two of them into Tony’s room. He’d tucked Tony into bed, arranging the blankets around him, and then climbed in behind him. His arm was an iron bar around Tony’s waist, holding Tony as closely to him as possible.
“I didn’t want to pass up the chance to see you,” Steve said, pitching his voice low. “Are you mad? Do you want me to go?”
“You’re probably wondering why I called you,” he said, fidgeting. “I’ll get to the point so I don’t take up too much of your time. I have some, uh, medical related concerns I was hoping to run past you.”
Disliking Howard—and getting angry on behalf of Tony’s bots—must’ve been the key to winning Tony over, because that good hurt got stronger.
“No.” Tony pushed down a ridiculous burst of happiness. “I can definitely help. Most places would just overcharge you. You don’t even have to pay me. I’ll do it for free.”
Something in Steve’s eyes terrified him. Told him that he wasn’t entirely off base with his sarcastic, mean-spirited comment.
There weren’t too many alphas who’d let an omega yell at them like that. Especially not in public. If Tony had pulled that stunt on Obie, he would’ve been limping for a week.
Been a long time since I updated…I was considering leaving the story as a WIP because so much time has gone by, but it’s been bothering me to leave it unfinished. Plus, I would’ve hated to leave anyone who was reading it with the last chapter’s cliffhanger forever. I’ve also been missing writing/these characters A LOT.
“Liar. You’re talking to Steve, aren’t you? Don’t think I haven’t noticed how you’re always texting him now.”
From his spot on the sofa, Tony shot Steve a sly, sidelong glance. Step One of taking his body back? Getting the cuddles he’d been pining for, once and for all. Building a tolerance to casual touching was necessary in order to move forward. “But if you were thinking of, say, putting your arm around me, I wouldn’t be opposed.”
Nat tugged on his hand again, drawing his attention back to her. “You can wear my wings,” her green eyes pleaded with him. “I don’t need them anymore.”
“They grow up so fast,” Darcy pretended to be choked up, sniffling. “Congratulations on leveling up from eighteen, Steve-O. You’re officially too old for me to refer to as barely legal. We love to see it.”
“I was born with no heartbeat.” It took Tony a moment to register that his mouth had run away from him again. “Huh. Deja vu. Apparently, I have a habit of blurting out uncomfortable truths in your car.”
The evening had ended with another kiss outside Tony’s door. Ever respectful of Tony’s boundaries, the alpha had kept things short and sweet, though it'd still had the effect of throwing lighter fluid on Tony’s overeager libido.
“There’s a man. An alpha. He’s willing to enter into a mating contract with a disgraced omega. He’s well respected in your father’s circles. He makes the kind of money that can ensure you never have a single worry for as long as you live. He can give you your life back. Make you into a respectable omega again.”
Suddenly, her hands shot to her hips, and she pinned Tony with the shrewd stare of someone much older. “Will his handsome brother be there too?”
Steve was transfixed on their point of connection, on where Tony was accepting him into his greedy heat.
Something else was clearly going on here. She almost never wanted to eat anymore. Even bribing her with McDonald’s yesterday had barely worked. Was she coming down with the flu? “Are you feeling sick, pumpkin? Is there a reason you keep refusing to eat?”
happening...but I regret pushing you if you weren’t ready. I feel like a bastard for making you run.”
That was not at all keeping things under control. It was one thousand times worse than trusting Steve or wanting to kiss him more than he wanted to breathe. It was a disaster of catastrophic proportions.
“Your boss is a life saver. My mate would’ve killed me,” the guy said, still looking like his head had been taken off the chopping block. “How much do I owe you again?”
.” The woman’s frown smoothed away. “That is acceptable, then. James has told me many great things about you.”
Tony looked down at their still entwined fingers. The teenager’s hand practically eclipsed his, making Tony’s appear embarrassingly slender and fine-boned in comparison. They looked almost dainty, even with the smattering of small scars he’d accrued in his workshop and the too white, old burn mark on his index finger, compliments of the time he’d accidentally mishandled a blowtorch. And because life had trained Tony to be prepared for the damage other people could cause him, he caught himself thinking,
The feeling was new. Wild. Crazy. Of actually wanting to touch someone. And not only that, but also desiring them to touch him in return.
Purring—along with growling—was an ability exclusive to high-level alphas. It wasn’t commonly seen behavior and was usually linked to instincts brought out by mates.
“Oh. Uh. Well...I’m touched you care, pumpkin, but I wouldn’t be doing my job if I didn’t discourage you from poisoning anyone. There are better ways to solve conflicts. Say no to murder. Murder isn’t cool.” He capped off his lecture with, “And stay in school.”
“Heard you needed some help with lunch,” Steve said, perfectly normal and friendly, like their disastrous kiss at the pool had never happened. He was holding the box of pizza over his shoulder with one hand, and a video game in the other—and he still looked so unfairly handsome that Tony felt personally attacked. “We’ve got pepperoni and extra cheese, and the new Nick Fury game. Can we come in?”
Tony stepped out from behind Steve. “That ‘thing’ is a mermaid crown and he can wear as many as he wants to, lady. And there’s nothing wrong with his hair, either. Men have had long hair since the dawn of time. The Ancient Egyptians had it. The aristocrats in Europe had it. The Vikings had it.” His eyes flew to the wooden cross the woman was wearing around her neck. “And you know who else had it? Jesus. Jesus is always depicted as having long hair.”
Tony fidgeted in his seat, pulling his collar away from his flushed neck before catching himself and letting his hand drop.
Tony was just glad she seemed to have forgotten her earlier apprehension and was back to being comfortable in the water.
The question made his heart feel heavy. How did he answer that? He hated that she was getting caught in the crossfire of other people’s cruelty simply because he was her babysitter. “Maybe. Not everyone is as accepting of omegas as your mom and dad. But some folks are also just bullies who’ll find any reason they can to pick on somebody else.”
“Dammit, Steve! You can’t jus’ barge in here like—like the alpha fun police and take over! If I want a goddamn drink, I can have a goddamn drink!”
“...He turned into a territorial alpha asshole and beat the shit out of Brock,” Tony admitted, deciding to give her a half-truth. He knew she’d never stop pestering him if he didn’t give her some kind of answer. “So I redefined the parameters of our friendship. As in, we no longer have one.”
Tony had been right when he’d told Darcy that Steve’s crush was the result of biology. His damn ‘compatible’ pheromones must’ve hooked Steve from the first day they’d met at the pool.
“I’m the most fashionable mermaid in the sea!” she repeated, beaming and showing off her sparkly, pink Band-Aid to Steve.
He wasn’t going to allow anything to interfere with Steve getting the future he deserved and leaving for his scholarship in September. Least of all himself.
“A date?” Tony repeated incredulously, smothering a laugh. “With Rhodey? No. God, no. He’d never be interested in me that way. We’re practically brothers. I’ve known him since kindergarten. We used to make macaroni art together and scratch each other’s chickenpox—true story.”
“He’s too loquacious if you ask me—a feature I’m sincerely regretting. Gives the term motormouth new meaning. And it’s not my robot, it’s yours.”
Her manners had come a long way from when Tony had first taken the job as her sitter. He was proud of the kid.
Everything had been going swimmingly until Natasha had come out of the changeroom in her frilly, red swimsuit, and had caught him sitting on the edge of the pool. Though he’d been dangling his legs in the shallow end, her green eyes had gone wide and stricken. Rushing up to him, she grasped his hand, forcing him to stand so she could pull him away from the pool.
Especially because, after getting one look at the state of Tony, the easygoing smile dropped off the teenager’s face. Tony could all but hear the alpha’s ‘omega in distress’ warning sirens start firing off at the sight of him.
“He’s fine,” Darcy answered for him. “He just seems to have caught a case of the klutz. Right, Tones?”
“Was that a crack about my usual hygiene practices?” Tony murmured, joking reflexively because Steve was getting way too real for him.
The next thing Tony knew, he was staring at a stack of 20-dollar bills. His eyes widened as he counted what must’ve been at least 200 dollars.
“See,” Tony babbled, pacing and gesturing wildly with his hands like he did when he was especially agitated, “I should probably be disturbed by your brand of vigilante justice, but I’m not. I don’t even really care that you went after Brock, because he’s a total douche canoe who deserved a taste of his own medicine and, also, fuck that guy.”
Culinary classes had been mandatory in omega boarding school. He hadn’t exactly received top marks—and he’d never be mistaken for a Michelin Star chef—but he usually handled mac and cheese much better than this.
There’d also been the matter of his uncomfortably wet clothes. And because the universe did so love to rub salt into his wounds, he ended up having to change into the grey sweats pants and hoodie Steve kept in his locker. The track clothes were oversized enough as to be pajamas and they smelled like Steve, like
Yeah, that would not end well. Especially coming on the heels of his unfortunate revelation. If he was getting attached now, he didn’t even want to imagine how much a date would mess him up. His damned omega instincts would probably start hearing mating bells.
With a broken growl, the alpha shot his release deep into Tony’s throat, cursing and chanting his name. “Tony, Tony, Tony,
“Hey!” Tony called after her. “What did I just say? No running! You’ll slip and—” His foot slid out from under him—it was just his luck that someone had left a flotation ring laying on the ground—and the next thing he knew, he was ungracefully tumbling to the floor. “Fall,” he finished pitifully.
Also, thank you so much for all the comments and kudos on the last chapter! This is my first time writing for this pairing so I've been pretty nervous to post here, but your comments left the biggest smile on my face. :)
“I’m fine. All good,” he gave his patent response. “Just got done with the hospital. I’m headed home now.”
“Good. You’re doing great. I’m gonna tell you about the time my dad and I took Bucky to the mall but I need you to keep breathing just like that. Can you do that for me?”
“What the hell’s going on with you?” he demanded once they’d climbed into the SUV. His restraint had lasted precisely as long as it had taken Steve to start backing out of the driveway. “First, you show up here uninvited—”
“No. Because we don’t have that kind of relationship.” The words were coming out of his mouth of their own accord. Almost as if he was trying to make himself believe them. “I don’t mingle with your friends. You don’t mingle with mine. We have our fun and then we go our separate ways. This still ends when you leave for school.”
He knew that drowning didn’t look like drowning—not in the way it was typically depicted in the movies.
He hid the feelings overwhelming him behind a light layer of snark. “You’re too responsible for your own good, Rogers.”
It was the rude awakening Tony had needed. He’d been getting carried away. Forgetting the rules he’d laid out. No strings attached, that was the deal.
“I’m not a kid.” Steve’s eyes flashed, his massive frame appearing somehow even larger. “I wasn’t a kid when I was getting the shit beat out of me every day, and I wasn’t a kid when my dad passed away. I grew up a long time ago. I know what responsibility looks like. I know how to take care of my own. Who do you think made sure the bills were paid when my mom was too sick with mate loss to get out of bed? Who helped Buck with his homework and got him ready for school in the morning? Don’t accuse me of being a kid when I’ve been raising one alongside my mother for years.”
He’d been so convinced that Steve wouldn’t look at him the same way anymore if the alpha ever found out his secret.
“Don’t need them. Cutting off contact with the alpha works for me. In fact, he’s already gone. He’s dust in the wind.”
Steve took a seat on the floor beside him, the warmth of the alpha’s body joining his. He hadn’t tried to make conversation, just offered his silent support, his shoulder lightly brushing against Tony’s.
“Reel it in, Tonya Harding.” The thought of Steve being injured actually made his stomach hurt. “No kneecapping necessary. I mean it.”
Darcy slid Tony a cold beer across the table. Catching it, he popped the cap, and took a long pull from the bottle. The cool, frothy liquid was a welcome relief from the hot sun.
It took him an embarrassingly long recovery period before he was finally able to talk again after the teen’s dizzying kiss. He cleared his throat. “I thought I said no funny business in front of the kids.”
an alpha before. “I don’t think ‘pathetic’ is a word anyone could ever use to describe you,” he denied strongly, and it made Steve look at him with such gratitude that he had to fight not to flush. “All those things I said to you two minutes ago? Forget I said them. They were never said. I was being a dickhead.”
Tony’s stomach gave an unwilling flutter at the thought of the teen paying attention to his drink preferences. “Uh. No. I’m alright. Honestly, don’t let me get in your way. I’m sure you have stuff you’d rather be doing than babysitting the nanny. I have a lot of reading I can catch up on. I don’t mind, uh, just sitting alone quietly for the next couple of hours. We don’t have to interact or talk at all, really.” In fact, he’d prefer it if they didn’t. “I don’t want to be any trouble.”
wanted an alpha to touch him before—and certainly not this intensely. He wasn’t a big fan of being touched, period. Not unless they were one of the few, trusted people he allowed into his inner circle. Because, yeah, he cuddled with Rhodey sometimes, but that was different. That was platonic. It didn’t light his skin on fire. Didn’t make him feel like he was going to die if the alpha didn’t claim him.
It might’ve been a line, but Tony didn’t think so. Steve seemed far too sheepish for it to be an act, even if it was hard to believe. Tony’s lips twitched, and before he knew it, he was smiling at Steve. A real smile—guarded and tentative, maybe, but real. The first one he’d given him.
The teenager was looking at Tony like Tony was the only person in the world he’d ever wanted. Him, the flawed omega.
“You could’a fallin’ in,” she scolded, relaxing marginally once she’d maneuvered him a safe enough distance from the water.
He cried for hours. For an eternity. For every ounce of buried pain he had to make up for. For all the poison inside he had to get out.
Steve remembered him from yesterday? That was not good. Very not good. Maximum, mind-blowingly not good. “Tony. Is me. I’m Tony.” And why was he giving an alpha his real name? Usually he lied and told them he was Jarvis.
Tony had no words for what it meant that Steve was giving him this. That Steve was allowing Tony to have a safe, positive experience with his pheromones. He didn’t have to resent them or be afraid. Or worry that they’d be weaponized against him. He could just...be.
“Hey, babe, you’re up.” Steve lifted his head from over a frying pan of sizzling bacon, like it was perfectly natural for him to be making himself at home in Tony’s kitchen.
But now that Steve was following the rules—now that the alpha was leaving a wall up between them—it didn’t feel good. It felt pretty fucking awful, actually.
Of the nameless, faceless person Steve would inevitably end up with. His true mate. The one he was most compatible with.
This time, Steve didn’t delay before answering. “Yeah,” he fired back with conviction. “It does matter.
They fell into a short silence after that, sipping their coffees and watching the kids—Nat and Bucky were taking turns pushing each other down a big, yellow slide—until Steve broached another topic.
He’d been afraid of the strength of his reaction to Steve. That it’d render him powerless in his own body.
“Fuck, look at you,” Steve rasped, so guttural it almost didn’t sound human. “So wet and perfect for me.”
“Is that...is it bad?” Steve’s eyebrows were scrunched together as though he was in pain, voice underlaid with sudden vulnerability.
The girl grew more terrifying every day. Godspeed to any future romantic partners who might make the fatal error of double-crossing her.
didn’t want to. The mere thought of ending their arrangement early sent his instincts into hysterics, as if something essential was being torn from him. The loss perforating his chest was like having the wind knocked out of him.
“Give me a break, kid,” he panted, struggling to follow her uphill. “You’re seven. I’m almost 30. I’m not cut out for this kind of cardiovascular endurance anymore.”
“Fuck no. Your cock is a thing of beauty. There should be shrines erected in honor of how perfect your dick is.”
thankful. Having Steve in his corner was…well, it meant a lot. Too much, actually. So much that it made his damn heart pitter patter like a bad simile. “Though I’m not sure how that would’ve worked, considering you were busy not being born yet and everything.”
He’d had to promise her a dozen times that nothing bad was going to happen to him and that she’d see him again soon. And even then, she’d only reluctantly let him go after Darcy had been forced to pull her away.
“Whaaaat?” Tony spluttered, doing a poor job of masking his surprise. He overshot trying to respond casually and landed somewhere near incredibly conspicuous instead. “What makes you think I want to marry S—uh, Bucky’s brother?”
“I don’t think that at all. In fact, I can assure you that I have never once sat down and had a single thought about you, negative or otherwise.”
It probably didn’t help that while he was pretending to be scrolling through his phone, he was secretly studying the alpha out of the corner of his eye instead.
Maybe Tony should’ve been mad—after all, he’d just finished laying down the law regarding their summer fling (i.e., not mixing with each other’s friends) and here Steve was, gatecrashing—but he wasn’t. He was pathetically unmad. And unexpectedly relieved.
because he tightened his arms around Tony and lifted him up. Tony wound his legs around the alpha’s waist.
Obadiah was no match for Steve physically, but the older man didn’t fight with just his fists. He had the kind of money and influence that could make Steve’s life very difficult.
I wasn’t expecting nearly so many people to still be reading this, so the response to the last chapter sort of blew my mind. Thanks to everyone who kudosed/bookmarked/subscribed/commented.
Tony almost felt bad for the kid. But then, the guy had had one job—to keep people safe in the water—and he’d failed spectacularly at that.
Night had fallen and the events of the day were fast catching up to him. Fatigue had taken over and his body was starting to crash hard. He usually had trouble sleeping but tonight he’d be lucky if he made it to his mattress before collapsing. As it was, he was dangerously close to falling asleep in Steve’s car.
“Okay, out with it.” Darcy narrowed suspicious eyes at him. “You’re being way too quiet. Something is up with you.”
“They should really advertise that on the box,” Tony muttered bitterly, rubbing tiredly at his eyes with the hand that wasn’t clutching the phone.
He’d had a mini heart attack upon later discovering that Steve was using the photo he’d sent as the wallpaper on his phone. The teen’s lock screen had remained a boring football logo, but the inside image had been replaced with none other than Tony’s face.
Tony snorted, suppressing a pang of longing at Darcy’s words. “…Right. Settle down, Oscar Wilde.” Young and free. Hah. What a joke. He hadn’t felt anything close to ‘young and free’ since he was 15 years old. Before he’d presented as an omega and his entire future had been taken away. “I don’t need magic. Boring and sweaty is fine with me. Iced coffee, however, is non-negotiable. Iced coffee is the hero summer deserves.”
“He said he’s coming with me.” Pushing back his chair, Steve rose to his full height and squared off with Rhodey.
He schooled himself into acting normal as they approached Steve’s lifeguard chair. The blond stood up as they reached him.
Unlike Steve, he didn’t wake up looking like a Calvin Klein underwear model. He required effort in order to look half decent, and tonight he wanted to look his very best.
“You weren’t a dickhead.” Seeing Tony’s disbelieving face, he amended, “Alright, maybe a little. Nothing I couldn’t handle.”
The sugary bribe failed to produce its usual results. Instead of reacting with enthusiasm, her responding, “...Promise?” was still quiet and withdrawn. “You’ll really be here in the mornin’?”
“I think I can go in the water if you’re there,” he admitted, trying not to reveal how much he felt like a twitchy, nervous wreck.
After a long series of tests to check his lungs, heart, and cognitive functions, Tony was given a clean bill of health and released from the hospital.
“Tony...” Jane sighed. “I know this is not what you want to hear, but...I think you’re better off choosing a time when it would be safe for you to stop taking your suppressants, rather than dealing with the unpredictable and very real liability of when or where they might stop working.”
The kids did as instructed and then hightailed it into the living room, arguing over who was better at playing Nick Fury: Agent of SHIELD.
his instincts shouted. They believed Steve would be the ultimate provider. That the alpha would be better than anyone else at taking care of Tony and any babies they might have.
When Tony was younger, he’d used to wonder if there was still something wrong with his heart. The surgeries he’d undergone might’ve repaired the physical abnormalities he’d been born with, but what if there was more to it than that?
Steve glanced away from the television, his gaze finding Tony’s. “Cut me some slack, babe. I was on my best behavior for you. I didn’t want you to think I was some foul-mouthed kid. I wanted you to see me as a peer. Someone you could be interested in.”
Tony was so thrown by this unforeseen turn of events that he failed to believe it until he was staring right at Steve. Until Steve had followed Darcy into the backyard, looking far too real to be any kind of sunstroke induced apparition.
If anyone is still reading after such a long hiatus (or reading for the first time), I hope you’re doing as well as possible during these current stressful and scary times. 2020 is literally cursed.
Tony almost came right there. He’d been primed to explode before they’d even started. His body burned for a release from the unbearable pressure that had been building since the day they’d first met.
Tony didn’t know much about football, or what a good player was supposed to look like, but it struck him that Killian hadn’t merely been sucking up when he’d said that Steve could go pro.
She was playfully pushing Bucky towards the kitchen sink. “You need to wash up. You gots sauce on your face.” She shook her head and looked at Tony like she was imparting him with a timeless piece of wisdom, “Boys are so messy.”
Granted, Tony’s knowledge of date etiquette was limited, but he’d assumed cuddles were part of the drive-in movie experience. Otherwise, what was the point of them sitting all close together and cozy in the SUV?
Steve’s expression seemed to close off—another wall slotting into place between them. The distance Tony’s instincts had sensed increased, widening into a gulf.
Every reaction he wrung from the alpha drove him crazier. Soon, he was hollowing his cheeks and bobbing his head. Moaning around the alpha’s cock.
“You know, some might say you’re handling this a little poorly for a lifeguard. It’s like you’ve never seen anybody almost drown before.”
A second knock unglued his feet from the floor. Hurrying to the door, he swung it open with slightly clammy hands.
An outpouring of raw emotion rose up inside him. It was as though there was too much feeling filling up his heart.
The teen’s mouth firmed and he dropped his gaze to the pool deck. Shoulders tensing as if in determination, he lifted his head back up. “…I want to be more than your friend,” he said.
In fact, if Steve was enamored with Tony at all, it was because the alpha didn’t actually know him. He didn’t know the full extent of the fucked up, barely-holding-it-together mess Tony was on the inside, or how deep his damage really went. And so, Tony likely didn’t need to worry about spending too much time with him, or about leading the teenager on, because getting a peek at who Tony truly was—well, that was the fastest way to get over him.
Dragging in a ragged breath, Tony forced himself to count to three. “I-I’m breathing,” he answered shakily.
“You won’t have to do any of the work,” he continued. “I’ll take care of everything, I promise. You weren’t supposed to receive any phone calls. I only posted the business line on the company website.”
Tony wanted to know what it was like to be with an alpha like that. To have someone like Steve caring about him. To live in Steve’s world, if only for a little while.
“You left me one the side of the road with no money and no place to go,” he accused, unable to keep the hurt tremor out of his voice. “I could’ve been dead for all you cared. You show up on my doorstep after all this time and
Another minute of this and Tony would start running the risk of getting in over his head again. Or, even more humiliating, coming in his pants. “We should-” he temporarily lost his train of thought in another kiss- “mmmph - put on the breaks.”
He was dealing with such bad alpha withdrawals that he was venturing all the way to Rhodey’s for some much-needed best friend time. A good Rhodey cuddle session was sure to make him forget all about how much he missed the lifeguard-who-should-not-be-named.
“I-I’m back. I’m good. False alarm.” Lust reignited his blood and—before he could become too gun-shy—he wrapped his fingers around the crown of the alpha’s cock. They were nowhere near successful at fully encircling it.
what’s wrong with me! Every time I turn around, you’re there! Stop breathing down my neck! Stop mollycoddling me! Stop pulling my goddamned chair out for me—I mean, who even
Steve wasn’t doing anything to make Tony feel like he’d done something wrong by pulling away. Or like he was a horrible tease for getting the teen worked up in the first place and then blue-balling him. The only thing Steve had done was wait for Tony to exit the changing room before offering him a ride home.
But the sound wasn’t coming from him. It was coming from Steve. Deep and rolling, vibrating through the teen’s chest.
His mother had used to play their music for him when he was really little. He could remember her tinkling laughter as they’d danced together, spinning and twirling around the room. Of course, it hadn’t happened often. His mother had rarely been home and had even more rarely payed attention to him. But, still…it was one of the few positive memories from his childhood.
No, it didn’t have a band logo on it, but it did have something. Tony could make out what looked like the word ‘Rogers’ in big, white lettering, and underneath that, the number 40.
To say nothing of the look on Steve’s face. There was gratitude and affection softening his features but the alpha also looked…well, he looked
“His scent’s all over you.” The teen ground his jaw, nostrils flaring. “You sure he only thinks of you as a brother?”
There hadn’t been a funeral or burial. Obie had discarded her like she’d meant less than nothing—had
“Of course it is,” Tony said somewhat bitterly, shoving his black sunglasses on. “An alpha like that is probably juggling a laundry list of betas and Os.” The double standard drove Tony crazy. Alphas were encouraged to ‘spread their seed’ but omegas were expected to remain chaste until a formal mating.
So, it was strangely comforting to know that someone was out there thinking of him—even if that person was a barely legal 18-year-old who Tony had no business talking to. Even if any kind of future concerning the two of them was already doomed.
“Good.” Steve let his brother go. Bucky harrumphed at him and dashed away with Natasha, both of them giggling like fiends.
“I like that you aren’t caught up in trying to be well-mannered and obedient like all the other omegas at my school. I like that you told me off.”
He’d miscalculated. He’d sorely underestimated Steve’s reaction. ‘Knowing’ was still different than hearing it. Than having Tony confirm it in no uncertain terms.
protecting. I want to be more than this. More than the perpetual omega in distress. When I think about how different my life could’ve been if I’d never presented as an omega, I…” He didn’t know how much more of this shit he could take. It was like there was nothing left of him to tear down. He was already done. Already defeated.
Cheeks heating, Tony darted a look at the kids. Thankfully, they wouldn't be able to hear him and Steve’s conversation from the backyard. Still, this topic was not one he was ready to discuss.
Steve was constantly putting Tony first. He steadfastly catered to Tony’s wants and needs ahead of his own.
clear now, but I’ve seen this movie, and it’s always the poor, unsuspecting schmucks who say things like ‘it’s not going to rain’ who end up inevitably being torn in half by a 500-foot tornado!”
“Nnnggghhh,” was all Tony could manage. On second try: “I’ll kick your ass if you don’t,” he threatened with a moan.
, Tony realized, eyes widening. “I mean, I, uh, overheard someone calling you that. Not that I was listening for it or anything. I just happened to catch it. So…yeah. That’s how I know your name. It’s not like I looked you up on Facebook. That would be crazy.”
. Hearing that had hurt. “It’s okay, pumpkin. Nothing bad happened to me. That’s what we have lifeguards for. And why we never swim in the deep end.” Trying to lighten the mood, he changed the subject. “I could use your help tomorrow morning though. I want to make our special stackable chocolate chip and raspberry waffles. You in?”
“You gave me your word you wouldn’t go after him,” Tony reminded him in warning. “And I maintain that if anyone gets to kill him, it’s me.”
A tight pulling in Tony’s chest drew a confession out of him—Steve deserved an omega he could freely mount and knot. Not one so fucked up they made him jump through hoops for crumbs. “Wanna be a good omega for you.”
Somewhere under the alcohol and the miserable, frightened anger, Tony was touched by Steve’s willingness to go to bat for him.
Steadying himself so that they didn’t both fall over, he awkwardly returned the hug—hugs were not something he received often—finding himself struck with a surprising amount of protectiveness and affection for the little menace. In the short time Tony had known her, Nat had already shown him more kindness and compassion than most people ever had or ever would. A seven-year-old treated him better than most adults. What did that say about the world?
The teen went rigid. His eyes blackened and a pure alpha hunger seemed to possess them. “What?” he grated.
Tony kept his eyes trained on where Nat and Bucky were sword fighting with giant, foam pool noodles in the water. It was easier than acknowledging the absurd, territorial envy gnawing at him.
He could feel the weight of Howard’s hand on the top of his head, pushing him back under, keeping him away from the surface.
Fighting down the absurd sensation that he’d been sent back in time and was being courted by the high school prom king, Tony clasped onto Steve’s wrist. His fingers weren’t able to encircle it and he was struck, once again, by how ridiculously outmatched he was, especially now that they were almost side by side and Tony was stuck comparing his baggy, nothing-special Scorpions tee and black swim trunks to Steve’s excruciating levels of lifeguard hotness.
“Like I said, I’m fine. Perfectly A-Okay. So quit wasting your time out here with me. We’ll hang out later.” He raised an arm in parting and began making the long trek back to the bus stop.
Steve frowned. “You’re not trouble,” he said firmly. “Come on.” He motioned towards the kitchen. “I’m going to make you that coffee.”
“I do. I do mean it. So can we skip the part where you use your magical Steve powers to make me spill my guts, whereby I say a bunch of sappy and embarrassing things to you, and jump straight ahead to the dirty part?”
All of a sudden, the teenager was no longer outside Tony’s apartment. No, he was very much inside, his hand shooting out and nabbing Tony’s bottle of booze from him.
Nausea slamming through him, his head rebelling at the sudden movement, Tony shot upright. A glance around the room confirmed his fears.
He might’ve been trying to be more buddy-buddy with his instincts lately, but this was one instance where he was sending them back to their corner for a time out.
he actually was, but it didn’t exactly go according to plan. A sudden head rush descended on him, almost toppling him back onto his ass.
Tony’s pulse spiked, which was bad, because he’d only just stopped it from racing. “Hey,” he burst out. “I don’t ramble. I talk incessantly, often trivially, but I don’t ramble.”
Again with the ‘baby’. He really had to get Steve to quit doing that. He didn’t like how soft and squiggly it made his stomach.
And the thought of returning to his safe, boring existence after that? Of never experiencing the rush he got whenever Steve smiled that fond smile of his, so freely giving Tony validation and approval? Of never again knowing the feel of Steve’s touch and how it lit up every nerve ending in his entire body? God, it was almost unbearable.
He was a flailing mess of limbs as he detangled himself from the alpha, stumbling in his panic when Steve set him down.
The stinging behind his eyelids returned. This time, however, the emotion that caused it was a different one.
All at once, she shot off the stairs like a tiny cannonball and threw herself at him in a giant hug, almost beaning him upside the head with her creepy doll. “You’re my favorite nanny,” she admitted quietly; apologetically, as if she regretted her peanut butter sandwich revolt from earlier.
“Fair enough.” A pang passed through him when he recalled Steve’s story about growing up sickly and bedridden. It was no wonder the teen was invested in keeping his health in prime condition. “I, on the other hand, can’t resist the siren call of extra butter and high cholesterol...One question, though: why’d you buy me all these snacks if you weren’t planning on helping me eat them?”
Crossing his arms over his broad chest, Steve leaned against the counter. “I can think of a couple of reasons why someone would like you,” he said smoothly.
“He has?” Tony lifted a pleasantly surprised eyebrow at Rhodey. “I mean, of course he has. I’m awesome. But I admittedly do have very bad timing, so I’m just going to see myself out and let the two of you get back to your, uh, date. Goodbye and goodnight.” Spinning around, he hurried out the door.
“Are we really gonna let Buckley's Cough Syrup beat us at cannonballing?” Tony playfully challenged Nat. “We can’t let him have all the fun.”
. “And, uh, exactly how many 27-year-old nannies who build robots do you know?” Maybe he’d get lucky and Steve would magically be talking about someone else.
“Yeah.” Tony stepped outside the apartment before backpedaling and patting his pockets. “Almost. Sorry, hold on. I forgot my phone.”
His eyes shot open—and Tony had only a second to process that Steve’s mouth was covering his own, his big hands pressing down on Tony’s chest, forcing his body back to life—before he made a strangled, choking noise and spat up what must’ve been a gallon of water.
Something complicated shifted across Steve’s face too quickly for Tony to catch. There was a suspicious, not quite pause before the alpha answered. “I never make a big deal out of my birthday. I didn’t see a reason to mention it. And...I already had what I wanted. I got to spend the day with my—with you.”
Tony took it gingerly, a giant lump forming in his throat, his eyes frantically scanning the image as he reassured himself that nothing had happened to it. The black and white, printed photograph was the only proof remaining to the world that she’d ever existed.
Tony pulled out some paper plates from the pantry and divvied up the slices, granting Natasha permission when she requested eating with Bucky in the backyard. The kitchen had a large, sliding glass door that led out to the patio, so he’d have no problem keeping an eye on them. He armed the terrible twosome with napkins and made them promise not to make a mess. All too soon, the kids had scampered off, leaving Tony to face the music. Or, more accurately, to face Steve.
Admittedly, his plan to never return had hit a couple of snags. While building Nat an aboveground, luxury pool had sounded good in theory, he didn’t exactly have the money required to make it happen. Needless to say, Natasha had been less than impressed with the round, plastic, two-foot deep monstrosity he’d ended up with. “This is for babies,” she’d told him. (Which, fair enough. He’d hardly call it his best work.)
Darcy plunked down next to him. “We need to find out more about this guy,” she said as she pulled her phone out of the pocket of her tiny shorts. “He’s
Tony nodded mechanically, taking a long sip of his drink—because his tongue felt like it was stuck to the roof of his mouth—but that only seemed to draw Steve’s attention to his lips, so he quickly stopped. “Your shirt,” he found himself blurting out. Cheeks burning, he clarified, “I, um, still need to return it.”
What he’d do when that happened was anybody’s guess. Make a fool of himself, most likely. He doubted he’d handle it well.
The teenager perked right up. Disappointed Steve was replaced with Happy Steve and it was worth it. So, so worth it.
. His damn mute button must’ve been broken. Tony booted the voice out of his head and went about his day.
If the universe caught on to the fact that he was well on his way to wanting to keep Steve, he’d lose the alpha twice as fast.
Steve leaned back from the steering wheel, giving Tony his undivided attention. “Okay,” he said carefully, like he was aware being too pushy would just make Tony clam up again. “I’m listening.”
“Like I said, it’s very rare. But I agree that such pertinent information needs to be more readily accessible for omegas. Hopefully things start changing one of these days.”
“More than when Obie used to feed me,” he answered bitterly, before he could bite his tongue—because, god, he carried so much bitterness when it came to her. A lifetime’s worth. Reigning it all in just wasn’t possible.
The alpha shrugged, saying, “If that’s what it takes.” Like that was in any way a sane response. Like he was genuinely prepared to throw hands with everyone who so much as looked at Tony sideways.
“How dare you!” the girl’s mother screeched, launching herself off the park bench towards her daughter. “Don’t you dare push my baby!”
Steve was hard and aroused behind him. Tony had gotten a glimpse of the thick arch of the alpha’s cock, swelling behind the confines of his red swimming trunks, before he’d managed to tear his eyes away. The sight was going to be burned into the back of his eyelids forever.
“Listen, about the other night…” the teen’s expression was unreadable, and he seemed to be holding himself unnaturally still. “You and that alpha…are you and he—you weren’t on a date, were you?”
—this is the most damning evidence of all—you haven’t called me out for giving you decaf today instead of the good stuff.”
“I’m still conscious and able to string together semi-sloppy—uh, wha’s the word? sentences, yeah, those—so I’d say ‘not nearly enough’. What’re you doing here, Rogers?”
Finding his sanity at the last second, Tony jerked away. He dropped Steve’s hand, backing hastily towards the pool steps.
Steve headed towards a small room that contained the pool equipment. “Something tells me that you won’t have a problem picking up the physical skill of swimming itself. If that’s all that was stopping you, you would’ve taught it to yourself already. This is not about that. That will come later. Right now, I just want to get you comfortable with being in the water.”
to get closer. Had to eliminate any and all distance between them. Steve didn’t seem to disagree—thank
The redhead had a strong personality and could sometimes be a bully without realizing it. She had a bad habit of turning the other children into minions—even the ones who were older than her. They followed her leadership and took orders without question. It was as impressive as it was disturbing.
The alpha’s cock was impossibly long and thick, veins pulsing from the base to its wide, flaring head. He looked so hard it had to hurt, a shocking amount of pre-cum already dripping down the tip.
It always staggered Tony how quickly he’d gone from celebrated miracle child to his parents’ greatest disappointment. He often wondered if they would have bothered moving heaven and earth to save him if they’d known he’d later present as an omega.
The alpha looked like he was struggling to get a hold of himself. The wet material of his swimming trunks was molded to the outline of his still gloriously erect cock. His hair was a mess and his blue eyes were blazing with lust. His chest was heaving with shallow breaths, fists bunched, as if he was fighting not to haul Tony back to him.
He couldn’t remember seeing Steve sleep at all. He got the feeling the alpha had stayed awake to monitor him.
Tony thought Steve looked good too—mostly because it was impossible for the alpha not to—but he hadn’t changed his attire at all. Other than the letterman’s jacket he’d thrown over his white T-shirt, he was wearing the same thing he’d had on at Nat’s.
Steve tore after him. In no time at all, he had his little brother apprehended. They play wrestled for a bit before Steve pulled him into a headlock and gave him a noogie. Tony would have been alarmed—he didn’t quite know what playful roughhousing was supposed to look like, having only been exposed to the other kind—but the boy was still laughing.
Tony’s pheromones hit the air so fast they made him dizzy. A deep throbbing had started inside him, turning him wet with a messy gush of slick. His hands reached for the teen’s fly, but Steve caught them before they could meet their destination.
At least he’d been able to use the private staff locker room. Though he’d had to make a distinct effort to ignore the way Steve prowled around outside the door, guarding it like Tony was a modest maiden whose virtue needed protecting. (And, no, Tony would never admit that he’d almost, sorta, liked it. Or that his stomach had gone kind of soft from what his omega had perceived as the alpha looking after him.)
He was sending Rhodey pictures of the averted disaster when his phone vibrated with an incoming text.
Tony had first met Thor a couple of weeks ago when he’d swung by to help Darcy with an errand. He was a big, blond bruiser who spoke at a decibel louder than necessary at all times, and who seemed to have three times more enthusiasm for life than any one person needed. As far as alphas went, though, he was surprisingly likeable. He clearly worshipped the ground his mate walked on. Jane had trained him well.
“Would you like anything?” he rambled nervously, leading her into the kitchen. “I’ve got food. Actually, no, that’s a lie. There’s only a stack of frozen dinners and a single apple in the fridge but, uh, I have coffee. I could get you a cup of coffee?”
But then Steve’s warning broke through the fog of lust shrouding his brain. Reality crashed over him like a bucket of ice water. Mortification slammed through him, turning the heat under his skin cold.
A hickey. A freakin’ hickey. Marking his skin with a reddish-purple brand that might as well have been the words 'Property of Steve Rogers’.
Tony was yanked from his thoughts when a large hand slid over his backside, giving him a playful, underwater swat on his bottom. The alpha whistled innocently when Tony whipped around to stare at him.
“Right.” Sounding more confident than he felt, Tony attempted to steel his nerves. “No more chitchat. I’m facing this head on – I’m jumping in the deep end.” He wanted to replace the memory of Brock throwing him into it.
“PI-NING,” Darcy yelled after him as he headed across the yard towards the kids, because she was nothing if not the worst.
alpha,” he said coldly, resenting the way his body made a mockery of his denial, still leaking slick and pheromones everywhere. “Now get out of my way.”
His chest wasn’t nearly as tight and his dizziness was receding. “No comment,” he said, not wanting to admit it.
“I know you’re not a schoolmarm. You’re…” Steve stared at Tony, his gaze seeming to go unfocused for a second. “So, how long have you been a nanny?”
Steve, Bucky, Darcy, Natasha, and Bruce—along with a few pool goers he didn’t know—were all gathered around him.
She and Steve looked perfect together. They were both the kind of good looking that wasn’t achievable by most mere mortals. They fit into each other’s worlds.
, he thought, trying to mentally shake himself out of his lust induced trance. That attraction that he’d experienced yesterday? It hadn’t been a fluke.
Steve stared at him dubiously. “Am I going to like it more than your last idea? I don’t want to see you throwing yourself into the deep end again.”
Tony winced. Okay, where the hell had that come from? It was like the words had been pulled from him. Like he could no longer keep them bottled in. “Wow, I, uh, really just said that out loud, huh? I’m not sure I meant to. I was thinking about how you asked me to talk about it earlier, and it just kinda slipped out…but maybe I should. Maybe I need to if I’m ever gonna put this shit behind me. Because I want to. I really, really do.”
“So, Tony, tell me about yourself,” the alpha began conversationally. His tone was casual, but he was looking at Tony with a little too much interest. “What do you do in your free time? What are some of your hobbies? I know you’re smart as hell and like building things, but I want to know more.”
“Let go of my friend or I’ll pepper spray you,” Darcy said fiercely, appearing at Tony’s side and brandishing the black bottle of capsicum spray Tony had made her.
“You know what, I think Steve and I are gonna head out.” Giving Steve and Rhodey access to pointy projectiles—or playing any kind of game that might further bring out their competitive side—was just asking for trouble.
“Tony,” Bruce said in a small, lost voice as he blinked rapidly. “I can’t see. I need my glasses.” His IQ often made him come off as older then he was, but right now it was heartbreakingly obvious that he was still just a kid.
His confession caught Steve off guard. The alpha had been watching him cautiously, as if he thought Tony might bolt from the car at any moment.
Whatever the reason was, Tony was sure that the novelty would wear off soon. Steve would realize that Tony wasn’t worthy of his attention and would inevitably return to his shinier, perkier peers.
Tony’s incredibly vanilla kink was striking again. Nothing got him hotter than who Steve was—how much of a good person he was. How safe and cherished the alpha made him feel.
“Don’t ask,” Tony said dryly. Nat was a sweet kid but she had a bit of a dark streak. Sometimes he felt like Darcy had an easier job than he did. Bruce was practically the perfect child – you know, if one conveniently forgot his tremendously destructive temper…
Going for a drive in Steve’s van? They’d barely circled the block before Steve had been forced to pull over. Their make out session had been so voracious, Tony had accidentally honked the car horn with his butt.
He glanced down at where his fingers were latched onto Steve’s wrist. It didn’t take a super genius to figure out what the key to the solution was here.
The voice succeeded in filling him with shame, causing him to pull away from anything that might lead to his potential pleasure.
He lifted his phone to his ear, his eyebrows furrowing and his heart thumping. “Why are you calling me?” he demanded, through a too tight throat.
Once the kids grew bored of splash fighting, they asked to play Marco Polo. With the advantage afforded to Steve by his alpha senses, the teen could’ve easily dominated the game. He let the kids win multiple rounds, regardless. Tony found it as unwelcomingly charming as everything else about the alpha.
For most kids, the idea of life and death was an abstract one. It was a concept they heard adults talk about…but that they secretly believed could never touch them. Death must’ve seemed real to her now in a way that it hadn’t before. Scarier. No longer intangible.
“I call him lots of things. That’s very on brand for me. But, no, we’re just friends. Bros. Hombres. Frères.” He motioned towards Rhodey. “Back me up here.”
All the alcohol in the world couldn’t save him or numb the pain, but that wasn’t stopping him from trying.
“All done!” Nat let the dustpan clatter to the floor. In true little kid fashion, she’d somehow only made more of a mess, despite a genuine attempt to help.
“The hell I can’t. I promised to never let anything happen to you, and I intend on keeping it.” Another growl. “
“But isn’t Barbie already married to Mr. Potato Head? That’s bigamy. You know what isn’t bigamy? Going to the pool.”
He shouldn’t have given Steve Obie’s name. He tried to hide his flinch, but his reaction gave him away.
He walked over to his waste bin and held the drawing out over it, but his fingers wouldn’t let the paper go.
He tasted curiously good. Not too salty or bitter. The flavor of pure, intoxicating male. Tony found himself swirling his tongue and taking the alpha into his mouth. Eager for more.
One last thing, since the story isn’t written from Steve’s POV, I’ll just leave this here: upon getting home later that day after it all went down—and after all that he’d learned about Obie & Tony’s parents—I have it on good authority that someone *cough*Steve*cough* totaled the punching bag in his basement and put a few holes in the wall. His knuckles were shredded. Good thing about that alpha healing, huh? :P
“Where do you think you’re going, little lady?” he said with mock seriousness. “Aren’t you forgetting something?”
“My pheromones might not get the memo if we stay too close,” Tony warned him hesitantly. “Their off switch is broken around you.”
“Yeah. Hold on.” Steve’s arms flexed as he grabbed the first aid kit from where it was hooked on the side of his chair. “Here.”
Scent marking was used to communicate protection, love, and/or affection. It could also stand as a sign of ownership. Obie’s had always been solely the latter.
okay, because Tony didn’t ever want to make Steve feel insecure about his body. Steve was the most attractive person he’d ever seen. So goddamn beautiful that Tony was in awe he was even allowed to touch him.
As if the alpha had somehow read his mind, Steve’s head jerked up and his blue eyes locked on him. Flashing his perfectly white, movie star grin, the blond made a beeline towards Tony. The bustling crowd of movie goers instinctually parted for him as he headed Tony’s way—but that was nothing new. It was no different than the reaction the alpha always received at the pool. Something about Steve Rogers seemed to command awe and attention from everyone around him.
“She didn’t have anyone in her corner. She didn’t have a chance. He didn’t want her...I should have.
“How can you possibly know that? Are you a weatherman now? ‘Cause I’m telling you, we could be hit with a freak storm here. Sure, the forecast might
things instead. Reaching forward, he wrapped his hands around the warm mug. Even though he’d watched Steve make it and knew it hadn’t been tampered with, he still didn’t want to drink it. He didn’t need anything making him anymore nervous or jumpy.
That rumbly, way-too-sexy purring started in Steve’s chest again. He ducked down to rub his face against Tony’s, and suddenly Tony was being nuzzled within an inch of his life. The teen’s musky, alpha smell grew stronger, thickening the air.
“Whatever you need, baby. We don’t do anything you don’t want to do. You set the pace and call the shots.”
Tony also wondered why he was suddenly daydreaming like he was starring in an ‘80s John Hughes movie.
“I must decline.” Bruce pushed his glasses up his nose. “I am composing a strongly worded email to Dr. Philip Sterns. I found an error in his latest article.”
“His drinking? Probably. But it’s been over two years since I last had to deal with him. Being disowned has its perks.”
In his defense, it hadn’t been hard to go without before Steve. Obie’s arms had been little more than shackles around him.
to look good; it comes effortlessly to me’ selfie. Spoiler alert: it didn’t. He almost gave up before having a stroke of genius. Figuring Steve would get a kick out of it, he recreated the original sketch the teen had made for him—the one where he was flipping the bird and smirking out over the top of his sunglasses.
Darcy was currently flipping through a copy of Omega’s Secret. As far as Tony was concerned, the magazine was nothing more than thinly disguised alpha propaganda. It was filled with articles like ‘Meals to Make Your Mate Happy’ ‘5 Submissive Tricks to Try During Your Next Heat’ and ‘How to Please Your Alpha.’
“That was a textbook case of an alpha overreacting to an omega being in danger. It’s simple biology,” he rationalized. “Same with his crush. So, I don’t want to hear any more about it, alright? There’s nothing going on between me and Steve Rogers.”
“I refuse to eat your delicious contraband—no matter how good it smells.” It was hard to sound accusatory when his instincts were busy doing a happy dance over the fact that Steve hadn’t given up on him. “You knew I’d have to let you in. This pizza is a bribe. Nay, an ambush. You ambushed me.”
“Tony…” Again, Steve looked like he desperately wanted to believe Tony’s reassurances. His breath rattled shakily, expression strained. “Don’t say that if you don’t mean it.”
A moan sounded like it was punched out of the teenager. “God, baby. I’m not going to last long,” he warned, jaw clenched.
overreacted. It’s been known to happen from time to time. Chalk it up to my laundry list of character defects.” Making his voice light as to not cause offense even though he wasn’t truly kidding, he tacked on, “Anyway, I didn’t realize alphas knew how to apologize.”
“Sure did. You think I’d miss an opportunity for this kind of irony? Few joys in life surpass getting to watch a robot dance ‘the robot’. Try and name one. I’ll wait.”
He locked onto the sound of Darcy greeting her newly arrived guest. The male voice that answered her was familiar.
Steve rubbed helplessly at the flush creeping up the back of his neck. “That’s, uh...honestly...probably gonna happen a lot if we’re together. Ignore it. I just wanna watch the movie. Hold you. It’s fine if you say no—no pressure, baby, alright? I just thought I’d ask.”
“But, uh, thanks. For wanting to be there for me,” Tony assured him, uncertain what he’d said wrong. Because he
about it. Parking herself beside Tony on the bench, she curled up against his shoulder, seeming content to finish eating her ice cream cone there.
“Thank you, Nanny Tony.” She smiled angelically and stuck a spoonful into her mouth. One of her creepy American Girl dolls was perched on the table next to her. Nat had mutilated the poor thing almost beyond recognition. It had an eye missing, half of its hair had been ripped out, and it was covered in scorch marks, but she still refused to part with it. Its lone, remaining eye seemed to follow Tony wherever he went, as if silently begging to be put out of its misery. He couldn’t decide whether it was cute or harrowing when Nat lifted a spoon to its mouth and pretended to feed it. “Berries are full of antioxidants,” she told the doll.
Tony couldn’t see his own expression, but he was 99 percent sure that he looked like a deer caught in headlights. His stomach knotted as Steve reached him.
He’d made Tony beg for things that should have made him sick. He’d played on Tony’s weaknesses as an omega. Had deprived and tormented Tony until he’d been delirious enough to do anything to make it stop, even selling his soul for the feeling of Obie’s disgusting knot inside him.
The teen sighed under his breath. A few seconds passed, and then he pressed his knee against Tony’s with a silent question of ‘is this okay?’
Steve had innocently clasped the nape of Tony’s neck, pulling him in to take his mouth nice and deep. Tony had immediately stopped responding and his breathing had gone funny.
. Clever nicknames are reserved for the people we like,” Tony muttered, sinking further into his lounge chair. He and Darcy had a habit of coming up with a variety of different witticisms for the names of their friends. “And he’s not staring at me.”
Tony couldn’t help but wonder how he and Steve would have gotten along as children. The alpha probably would have been one of the kids who’d picked on him, which was a pretty depressing thought. But then he remembered that Steve hadn’t even been born until Tony had turned eight, which made it an even
Now, ever since he’d kickstarted that ugly panic attack by jumping rather unwisely into the pool, he couldn’t even get
“You wasted your time coming here,” he told her. He strode to his door and swung it open. Sarcastically, “Thank you for stopping by.”
To add insult to injury, Tony had also dreamt of Steve the night before. He couldn’t remember much aside from blue eyes, corded muscles, and blond hair, but he’d woken up with an inescapable ache of longing. A longing that still hadn’t subsided.
Steve stroked his thumb, slow and smooth, along Tony’s hand and it sent shivers throughout Tony’s entire body.
A wave of awareness washed over him and he knew, even without looking, that the blond alpha was nearby. Craning his neck, Tony’s eyes went straight to the alpha, as if drawn there by some kind of magnetic pull.
He definitely had to say something, though. Otherwise Rhodey would draw the wrong conclusion. When in actuality, Tony had been an enthusiastic, willing participant in the making of that hickey. “It’s not...it’s not like that. We’re together. Kind of.”
Tony found himself weirdly entranced by the veins in the teen’s biceps, which was a new low, because he’d never been attracted to a vein before. God, he was such a pervert. “Thanks,” he forced out. He made sure that their fingers didn’t touch as he hastily took the first aid kit.
Tony looked down. His Black Sabbath T was soaked and clinging to his rather unimpressive chest. He wrung out some of the water, then followed after Steve as if his legs had a mind of their own, his heart pounding erratically.
Alright, fair enough. That was far from his cleverest pop culture reference, but his blood was busy rushing to places other than his brain. Ignoring the question, he plowed ahead sarcastically, “So, the strangest thing just happened to me on my way here. You’ll never believe it. Guess who I ran into coming out of the convenience store? I’ll give you a hint. It starts with a ‘B’ and ends with ‘Brock’.”
“Smart kid.” Steve turned to Tony with the same slightly wide-eyed, impressed look that people usually got around Bruce’s Bruceness. “Is he yours? I have to be honest, you don’t look old enough to have a child his age.”
It seemed unfathomably easy for the people around him to connect with each other. To let each other in. They were perfectly happy putting their hearts in somebody else’s hands, almost as if they didn’t realize that they were handing over the power to destroy them.
He hated the submissive nature of his desires. Hated that his heat could reduce him to a panting, begging mess.
Steve didn’t look convinced, but to his credit, he let Tony get away with it. “Alright. I’ll walk you out.”
Nor had he been tempted to sneak out of the community center, ditch Steve, and hop a bus home all because he’d been too worried about his body’s reaction to the teenager. Or that he’d melt into a puddle of liquid omega heat if Steve so much as breathed in his general direction. He was emphatically
