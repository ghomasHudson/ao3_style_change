There’s an unguardedness to Tony’s face that takes Steve by surprise – the way Tony murmurs softly to Liberty that helps calm Steve’s nervousness too. “Beautiful,” Tony says, snapping off his medical gloves to give Liberty a final pat.
Glancing up at Steve's tense shoulders and Carrie's shaking ones, he has to make a choice. And in the end, it isn't really a choice: more of a foregone conclusion.
want to live, does dream of living old enough to retire behind a white picket fence in a lakehouse with bots instead of children and fuzzy alpacas instead of dogs.
“Thank you,” he says, ducking his head, counting the gravel stones on the path. “For tonight. For this past year.” He has Steve’s gift waiting in their bedroom: the ugliest knitted sweater he could find, and a new adamantium-vibranium compass to replace the old one Steve keeps carrying around. “I know I’m insufferable most times, and
back that faces the new onslaught of bots, and the numbers - the numbers run quick through Steve's head, a new skill he's picked up from hours spent in Tony's workshop. He knows exactly how much force his shield and the nanobots of his uniform can take, and how much force his body can take.
Howard takes another sip of his drink. Stane answers for him. "We understand the gravity of the matter, Agent Carter, and we're asking our most discreet men to investigate it."
"Mr. Stark," Steve easily cuts in. His sharp black tux and customary earpiece made Steve no different from the other guards in the room, and it was crucial he stay unrecognised as Captain America. "Your lady mother was seeking your presence."
“Perhaps you will find some clarity after your rest, Sir,” JARVIS pointedly says. “Captain Rogers has just returned from his morning run, you may find him on the common floor couch. All other Avengers are still sleeping.”
They bicker, and Steve leaves for the kitchen, pretending to need another bottle of his useless beer. There are cracks already in the bottle he had been holding, the pressure of his fist around it too much.
"I'm perfectly happy to assign someone else to tail you today," Steve points out reasonably. "Also, food poisoning is a very serious thing, Tony. Remember when you were fourteen and we stole the - "
He's never - he never wanted to make weapons, and yet, here he was, thinking of rockets that could power missiles. With a body as scrawny as Steve's, the only chance he would make it out through war was a miracle, or by having the bigger stick. It wasn't Steve's strength of resolve which sent Tony sick with worry - that had never been in question - but Tony had spent one too many visits to the nurse's office over the stutter of Steve's heart and the wheezing of his lungs.
"I was doing very well keeping myself safe from vultures like the Frosts until your presence," he pulls his mother behind a pillar, "put us in the spotlight."
He’d also very much like for Steve’s gift to stay intact. After the small fight they’d had earlier today over protocol and training exercises, Tony doesn’t need Steve to get even more upset when their anniversary rolls up in a week. There’s too many things that he has to do, he can’t handle a falling out with their relationship –
His eyes land on the shirt she means, and he looks at the sweater he’s wearing right now. Yeah, okay. She has a point. “Thanks, Nat.”
Steve is familiar with Christine Everhart's blonde hair and admittedly stellar journalism. Before that, however, Tony was supposed to receive the Apogee Award, but Stane had been the one to take the stage.
Although maybe this time, he’ll put an ocean and a continent between himself and the madness that is Tony Stark.
"I keep him safe," Steve frowns. How far gone was Howard? Where was Agent May? She was meant to keep track of the elder Stark from spiralling this bad.
That was the one redeeming act that Howard had done over the years, but even then he knew that Howard was only trying to stop him from starting a new company.
Sunset often tries to peek at Tony’s work. Steve only crooks a judgemental brow and returns to his own art. It almost grows familiar, the silence of it, and Tony will reach Steve’s door only to find it unlocked.
was dead. People expected him to run a billion-dollar company. Senators were calling him about the war in the East, and Obie was... difficult.
Steve stands, walking towards the bed. Carefully, he shifts the blueprints around, making space for himself beside Tony. A kindness bordering on cruelty.
Didn't Steve tell Tony that he barely liked anyone in the school? In the end, Tony was a friend Steve never needed either.
"And you're the child prodigy. I'm pretty sure you can come up with even better body armor for Captain America's boyfriend."
"Well, Miss Chavez, you know how I can only carry one of you at a time?" Tony waits until the girl nods. "Mister Steve can carry
“Seems I won her over,” Tony grins wide, then, “hey, hey come on, big lady, let me up,” he gently shoves Liberty off his chest to sit up by the doorway, and Steve darts forward to close the door, stopping any more chill from coming in.
Three years going through Erskine's experiments, five in the deserts fighting wars they had no business fighting, and another two helping Bucky recover while signing up for Peggy's grassroots organisation, Steve hadn't had much time for himself in the past decade.
enough to be angry. Howard and Obie made sure that Tony stayed close to Ty and far away from Steve, so while picking fights wasn’t the best way to befriend somebody, it
to turn his gaze away from Steve, but he looks up at Carol striding through the door with a bag full of takeout boxes, with Sam and Thor following behind.
If Steve heard, he gave no indication, and Tony huffs unsatisfied, turning to Bruce. “Can you believe I nearly married that guy?”
"Yes, Obie," Tony says, guilt roiling with pride. He didn't want to disappoint Obie, not when the man had placed so much faith on him. "Thank you for the tools."
He has only enough strength to curl up tighter in Steve’s lap. He’ll later probably regret what he’s doing to his back.
Obie comes even closer, almost towering over him. “I understand your grief and the idealism of youth, but and what will you say to the government? What will - "
Tony’s beard tickles as he burrows his head further into Steve’s stomach. “Are you doubting me, Steven?”
"Steve could never be jealous of you, you know that." Sarah settles on the couch, next to him, pressing a warm mug of milk into Tony's hands. "Why did you
“A) I'm not a nurse, and B) she must've had one hell of a time wrangling you,” Tony finds a laugh slipping out of him.
"What? Can't a mother be hopeful for grandchildren?" she darts out of his reach. "Two men just doubles the possibilities, doesn't it, Tony dear?"
"When you told me you dream of me, I hoped it was sweeter dreams than that," Steve jokes despite himself, because it's what Tony needs to anchor himself back in the present. They can talk in the morning when Tony isn't shaking this much. He earns a huff, and adds, "you're not getting rid of me so easily."
Tony blinks at him, at Steve’s slanted smile – almost a smirk, really – and there’s an IV needle in his arm, and the heart monitor he’s hooked to is beeping more loudly than before.
recall," Peggy taps her red-coated nails against the metal table, "it was your decision to pick the building and the room."
- that his paths would cross with Tony's again, one day. Whether it was when Tony was happily married with a child or when they were both old and grey and as lonely as they had been when Tony had snuck into Steve's dorm room lifetimes ago - it felt impossible to move on when they had hurt each other so much.
For a moment, he stares around his room, hand hovering over the next shirt he needs to fold into the suitcase.
While he understands it’s part of her job description and training to be protective of Steve, he really would appreciate it if she toned down just a bit.
"And I've killed more people with my own hands than you have," Peggy meets his fire with practiced calm. "Steve is there to keep you alive. Please let him."
"I hereby give, devise, and bequeath all the property and land of the address Malibu Point 10880, 90265 to Captain Steven Grant Rogers, absolutely and forever, on the condition that he learn the difference between Beethoven," Pepper frowns, "and a dying cat. Don't leave the piano unplayed, don't let DUM-E feed you smoothies."
Tony snorts. “You really don't know?” he stands up, scoffing and pacing the length of Steve's room. “Because, here's a funny thing you might not have heard about me and my
Before Tony can yell a warning, the bomb's yanked out of his hand, Steve's throw arching it high and his strength slamming it
"No," Steve admits. Peggy might have suspected whatever she suspected, but Steve didn't. No amount of following Tony to meetings had shaken his doubt in Tony's innocence. "I meant that you might have made those weapons, but you're not to blame for them appearing where they aren't meant to appear."
It isn’t a rule born from spite, but from calculated caution. Steve was a year younger than everyone by virtue of his love for books. When his Ma spent long hours at the hospital, he’d go to the public library, do his homework there together with Bucky. It kept their costs low, and kept Steve out of backalleys where he was prone to picking fights.
Old wounds reopened, Tony just has to find the strength to add fire to the fuel, to do the final hit to shatter fractures he had once kissed, to cut open scars he had once helped Steve heal from.
“If you tilt the beam at a thirty one degree angle, there’s a chance the rebar won’t go clean through me. It can balance on the second floor’s pillars and give you enough space to lift Steve, then me.”
That was... that was a first. Tony flicks his gaze up to the shadows under Steve's eyes, the crease between his brows that seemed ever-present these days.
"Cap," the nickname rolls off his tongue, foreign enough to jerk Steve's attention back to him. "This is going to blow in around two more minutes, you need to - "
haven't Googled him yet,” Clint mutters. Then, before he walks back to the storage room, Clint pokes at Kamala's shoulder. “Leave Steve alone. He's a lost cause.”
"Are you projecting your issues on me?" Steve smiles back. "If you really want company, Clint's always free."
Someone tries to wrench Tony away but he stands his ground. "I can disarm it." He might not be Captain America, but he
What is he without the looming spectre of Howard's war? Without the clunk of Iron Man's boots beside him on the battlefield and the technology of Tony's heart lighting up the rooms he lives in?
Beside him, Steve shrugs, making their coats brush. “You said you had no time for training exercises or protocol paperwork, I said you’d better make time.”
"I burned everything," Tony says quietly, "Fury won't find anything in those caves that I haven't destroyed."
Steve lets him, because it means that when Steve leans across the table to steal a kiss, the sweetness of it fizzles across his lips. "You should get some sleep."
He has to satisfy himself with the recollection of Steve’s kiss this morning. A lifetime ago, when they’d showered together. Steve had playfully run his broad hands across Tony’s chest, drawing patterns with soap around the light of the arc reactor. ‘
That wasn’t fair. Did Steve really think so little of Tony? Was all this just a fun game for Steve, meant to be forgotten? The questions pile up until all Tony can think of is: “How can you
With his useless faceplate tossed to the side, the rest of Tony’s helmet nestles his head, keeping him from angling his neck properly to see the man he’s loved for five years now, the face he’s woken up to every morning for the past two years.
Grease stained the plain shirt he was wearing, uncombed hair sticking out so familiarly that it sends an even stronger pang of – of guilt, grief,
was the one who was supposed to be asking that. His hand shoots out to catch Tony's wrist before he could go any further.
Tony takes a long sip of coffee, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand, uncaring of all the etiquette classes they used to have. "And what happened to
He tamps down his irrational, bubbling curiosity, and he blames it on the whiskey that he holds out his hand instead, one reckless action traded for another. "Prove it."
Sighing, Steve ruffles Liberty’s fur, laughing a bit when she licks his hand, tail wagging happily as she drops down, putting all her weight on top of Steve’s feet.
"Did I hit my head?" Tony demands, digging his fingers into Steve's shoulder because it's warm and real. "Am I, I don't know, dreaming this up?"
Rolling her eyes, Carol pushes her chair back to stand, taking her empty glass with her. “Men,” she shakes her head as she leaves them, “comparing the length of everything.”
,” he curses, whirling around to glare at her back, “my heart isn’t strong enough for heart attacks, Romanoff.” She only sways her hips a bit more, walking away.
"I think it's pretty secluded." There's a little furrow between Steve's brows. "Small chance of assassination, and it's a great vantage point."
Tony tries to imagine it: the gentle woman in Steve’s sketches being handed a tumbler of whiskey from Howard. He can’t, and he shouldn’t. Because Tony is supposed to be mingling with anyone other than this scrawny boy from Brooklyn.
"Listen," Tony sighs for the hundredth time. "I visit orphanages every month. The kids aren't about to assassinate me, Steve. They'll only give me mild food poisoning from their cooking."
When Steve answers, his words are more question than statement. “I caught you trying to help out in the kitchens during our first week here.”
Stark snorts, loud enough that the nurses and other doctors glance curiously their way. He stifles it quickly, grinning again at Steve. “If you say so, Captain. Now, unless – ”
Gone was the old man. And yet, what did that leave Tony with? The crown to an empire of scrap metal tinged with death.
There's something off about it, though - but Steve wonders whether he still knows Tony well enough to spot when things are off. A certain heaviness in the tone of it, the restless fidgeting of Tony's fingers beneath Rhodey's grip.
“I’ll uh, I’ll be going,” Steve announces awkwardly. Tony was now attached to Rhodes’ side, which felt too intimate for him to keep seeing.
Tony nods. Leaving the ground floor living room, he leads him upstairs to the guest rooms, not missing the way Tony curiously eyes the punching bag over the dining table or the old buckets of paint lining the far corner.
“Steve,” Tony tries out the name. It's far too simple a name for someone as maddening as Rogers. “I think Thor's looking for your attention.”
And then Steve's body is curling around him, and the shield a blur of red and blue as Steve brings it up over their heads: "stay with me," Steve pleads.
A small nod is all Steve needs to move, hand wrapping around Tony and pulling him close until Tony's head rests on his chest and their legs tangle between the sheets. "Thank you," Tony whispers. His voice is raspy.
not concussed?" Tony squints suspiciously at him. That sounded too much like an offer for a date, with leeway for him to brush everything off as friendship.
Steve, watching from the elevator, decides it’s far too early in the day to cope with this madness. He presses the button for floor 45 instead.
His phone is on the bedside table by his charger, and his tablet in the drawer. Both will have to come with him.
“Hush, Rogers,” he stops them beneath the next lamp post, stepping around to stand in front of Steve. “I’m cold, my back is killing me, and I’m in a park when I could be in bed. Let me finish. I know we won’t magically stop arguing just because we’re sleeping together – although you now have an extra effective way of shutting me up,” he waggles his eyebrows playfully, gratified when Steve lets out a chuckle. “And I’m going to forget to come to bed because of a project, but I – the cold isn’t
Tuesdays to Thursdays are for working on alternative energy sources under the guise of increasing fighter jet fuel efficiency, Fridays for press conferences or the occasional party to keep his reputation intact - he's learned that being underestimated as a party boy can provide a hidden upper hand - and weekends to spend on his friends or his mother.
secluded retirement at a very pleasant cottage, Tony is left to expanding JARVIS' capabilities, testing out new hologram design technologies, and scrapping all the voicemails Pepper leaves him. He's overhauled the car company that built his parent's last car, made a mini AI to add extra controls to their braking systems and ramped up their fuel efficiency.
"But I've known you since before you could lie properly," Steve smiles, sad. "And I know leaving won't help."
He’s not afraid of that. He’s afraid they’re going to break themselves trying the impossible to save him. “I know,” Tony assures her.
"Howard's never been satisfied with what he has, but he has principles." Peggy smiles ruefully. "Sometimes, I don't agree with those principles. There are others, however, with fewer principles than him."
one, this time – interrupts them. "Sorry. One of Doctor Hammer's experiments exploded again. Doctor Strange asked if you could check the lab for damages?"
to finish this, and he needs coffee if he’s going to fix the latest growth simulations which are – yeah. The hologram in front of him flashes red yet again. Another failed calibration.
when he'd written this, two years into his training in the Army, right at the cusp of Erskine's final serum that would tip him over the edge, turning him into a symbol, a shield, a weapon.
He can only hope that Liberty doesn’t scare Tony off. Sure, Tony is a vet, but Steve doubts it’s pleasant to spend your whole day being angrily barked at.
“I made sure of it,” Steve promises, wondering how it was that Kamala managed to win Stark's affection. He thought Stark's snappy manners would clash with Kamala's exuberance, but he supposes that he might be mistaken about a lot of things regarding Stark. “Her dad should be arriving here any minute. The fire dispatch call came at the right time,” he adds on some more reassurance.
"You said something to Bucky in the hall," Steve doesn't bother skirting around. Tony knows him as much as he knows Tony. "Something about building me things."
be doing with his free day, but he's too keyed up to be able to focus on much. He had tried jogging. He had tried art.
"Dance with me," Peggy demands, pulling him off the counter with more strength than an old woman should have. Her hand lands on Tony's waist, and she pulls them close enough to whisper. "Hail HYDRA."
don’t recommend a repeat,” Rhodey says, fondness tinged with exasperated worry. “We’re going to talk about your priorities and why we’re not going to give up on you.”
“You’re, uh, you’re the doctor,” and Steve feels his own cheeks warm. A beat of silence, and he cautiously adds, “you know more about… bodies.”
“Genius,” Tony shrugs, fingers drumming anxiously on his knees. “So. Let the genius billionaire fix things for you. What’s wrong?”
He sucks in a breath. Of course Tony would offer. It would be the best prosthetic Bucky could ever hope for, but he would see it too much like charity, and could compromise further their mission with the Starks.
Steve nods once. Outside, the waves crash. In the sudden silence, they crash loud against the cliff, chipping away at it inch by inch. “When you’ve changed the world," Steve meets Tony's eyes with a terrifying resolve, "don't call me."
"You're healthy enough to argue with me," Rhodey points out, with a softness that makes Steve look away, a pang hitting him.
"Just - " Steve cuts himself off when they hear a chopper outside, most likely there to help control the fire on the other side of the building. "Everything's a mess and it's going to be an even bigger mess when we get out," he continues with a sigh, fingers brushing away a trail of sweat across Tony's temple. "I just need something good. Something to look forward to at the end of everything."
JARVIS counted, and Edwin Jarvis frowned at him, which meant Rhodey did too, and Pep followed not long after.
"Are you Mister Tony's friend?" another girl wearing a reindeer sweater pokes at the edges of Steve's black suit, and he has no time to answer before a small boy tugs at Steve pants.
“Hulk’s moved away most of the roof,” Rhodey reports, “and the cranes are doing most of the fine work.”
"You could come by my lab," he finds himself offering. Anything to get the weapons out of the wrong hands, and, "DUM-E would love to meet you."
But Tony just looks out on the busy street that’s decidedly absent of any cabs, and notes, “she picks up on your nervousness around your dates.”
“And paperwork is not. So let Commander Fury fume about paperwork, and let us find someone to warm your bed, Captain.”
to tell Tony to do anything, not anymore, and not ever again. “Why did Fury call us and why now? I can’t do the equation unless I have all the variables.”
Steve nods. "I do. But if there's a chance I can save lives by making this end faster, I'll take it."
No matter what new heights he achieved, no matter what breakthroughs he'd accomplished, he would come back to an empty dorm room and 'friends' who only wanted him for his name. And when Peggy had tried to intervene, he had rebuffed her, spiralling further away.
“This morning you were glaring holes behind Clint’s head, last week, you were ready to murder Thor, and even Pepper’s started to steer clear of you. Should I be shocked that my troublesome self has escaped Captain America’s disapproval for once?”
"I know you," Howard slurs the slightest bit, one hand clutching at his whiskey. His twelfth tumbler of the night, if Steve's numbers didn't lie.
Tony huffs, annoyance returning to him. He didn’t keep Ty and Sunset away from Steve just to be belittled. “I’m a MENSA certified genius. Highest score ever. Why wouldn’t I understand?”
“All done,” Tony coughs to get the raspiness out of his voice. He takes another alcohol swab and lifts his hand up to reach Steve's forehead.
“No. Tony, your father wouldn’t be happy to know that you’re wasting your time on the hippies. You’re young and impressionable. When you’re older, you’ll understand that this is how we’ve always done business, how we’ll always do it.”
"Come to bed," Steve hovers by the workshop door, leaning on the tower of boxes shoved in the hallway.
Cowardly, but he doesn't trust himself to be able to give the news with the strong steadiness Tony deserves.
Understanding dawns bright across Tony's face, and Tony's smile softens, lips bitten at the corner as he tries to contain the same excitement bubbling beneath Steve's ribs.
Letting Liberty in the door, Steve hangs his coat on the hook and sighs. Doctor Stark’s advice had been sound enough, but tonight’s date had gone to bust the moment Liberty nearly bit off Sharon’s hand.
JARVIS had gone out when the rebar had gone right through the armor’s systems, and it’s mere luck – mixed with Tony’s engineering genius – that the hardware remains functional enough for Rhodey’s voice to anchor Tony to consciousness.
He meets with Peggy again to reach a mutual understanding with her. Weapons of defense for SHIELD, in return for intel about the rot creeping into Stark Industries, the missing accounts that show up sporadically, flagged by MARIA and analysed by JARVIS.
"You were the first he wanted to see when his duty to the Army expired." A pause. "I couldn't promise you that he would come home. I didn't want to hurt you any more than you were hurting." That's as much of an apology as Tony can expect from her. He's about to say so when Peggy continues, "I sent him to you as soon as I could, because there's no one else - except perhaps your own Captain Rhodes - who I'd trust to keep you safe."
And okay, fine. Tony might’ve been knocking their elbows together more frequently than warranted for a walk in order to tempt Steve into holding his hand, but... ‘
"Of course. Didn't you read my file? Apparently, I'm highly desirable." Making sure his suit jacket is properly unbuttoned, he pauses by Steve before walking through the door to meet the cameras. "How do I look?"
The cardiogram's beeping keeps going on, muffled over the rush of his own heart in his ears. He can hear Sam hooting, and Thor cheering them on.
It becomes harder to keep his other friends away from Steve, and yet, the extra hours of companionship are more than worth it.
“If you keep massaging me like that, I might marry you right here and now,” Tony sighs, leaning up to kiss Steve.
"Aunt Peggy," he doesn't bother with pleasantries, "I need everything from your investigation on my parents' accident."
' bubble appears straight away, Tony's reply coming through a heartbeat later. It makes Steve laugh, clutching his phone and glancing carefully around the room.
“Her father is hitching a ride on the ambulance with Bruce. They're both fine, only surface-level injuries,” Steve quickly reports, hoping to be helpful. He hadn't expected Stark to be
Smiling, Maria reaches out to perk up his pocket square before she presses her cheek against each of Tony's. Her perfume hits him like home: a flowery lightness as subtle as her simple dress.
, Tony had said. Liberty’s too worn out to bark at anyone, and Steve watches tensely as Tony puts his hand over her chest, expertly stitching the deep cut.
Night shifts were better for Tony’s nocturnal tendencies, but they tended to put his social life on a damper.
Why did he think an evening down at the bar would be relaxing? “The man looks like a poster child for steroids and rescues kittens for a hobby. Pets are a vector for diseases!” Tony protests. “We have nothing in common.”
Briefly, he had considered stopping everything and living a normal life, go to art school with the hefty sum the Army had paid him, spend his life with paint-splattered hands rather than blood-soaked ones.
After a tiring day of team building exercises, Steve has to admit he understands Tony’s need to cuddle. But after four years of dating, Tony apparently
He can’t entirely regret leaving to join the Army, because if he hadn’t been on the battlefield next to Bucky, things would have gone much, much worse.
“I’m ready,” Tony looks up into the sunlight trickling down from high above, the dust falling like snow. “Nat, I’m – don’t let them beat themselves up over this, yeah?”
,” Stark shoves the rest of his potata wedge into his mouth. Rubbing his hands on his pants, he fishes out the small device from his pocket, then turns around the room in search of something while mumbles, “sorry, gotta dash.”
Tony has had no success hacking into the giant Hydra robots, that are literally and very unwittingly in the shape of a nine-headed monster, each head equipped with far too much firepower.
“There’s a chance that we go to battle again tomorrow. There’s a chance we’ll mess it all up,” Steve nudges the pudding cup into Tony’s hand. “But there’s a chance that this is all going to work out, and I’m willing to take that chance on you.”
“For the record,” Steve says, “you’re more important to me than me. So if you want to take care of me, you’ve got to take care of you.”
of it. And I was only halfway through reading about it when Captain Rogers saved me from the upstairs candle.” Shorthand for how Steve had stopped the fire from spreading through the entire apartment building. “Turns our doctors aren't the only heroes.”
“Because of people like you,” Tony fiddles with his pen, uncapping it and capping it again. “I know what Butterfingers did for Rhodey – my friend – after coming back from his tours abroad. These dogs, these pets, they can’t speak for themselves, but they care.”
Squirming slightly, Stark wipes the corner of his mouth with the back of his hand. “A father. Has three daughters, had heart failure.”
The flashdrive his Ma gave him has all of Tony's research on the missing weapons, a backup of an AI named MARIA, dating as far back as when Steve was still involved in the mission. It fuels him on, the need to find Tony, and it lets him forget about the ring he had left with his Ma.
Running his hand a few times through his hair, Steve presses the button that cranks up the garage door.
As if understanding him, she kicks her small leg, making it stick out from under the blanket. Tony opens the windows on the side of the incubators, reaching in to fix it. He lets her tiny,
Steve takes in the ash marring the side of the hospital dark, the broken windows and the loud sirens of his firetruck.
Together, Sam and Rhodey lift Tony into the chopper, and Steve climbs into the chopper next to it, eyeing the sand separating them. He's done his part. He's found Tony. He's lost any right to be on the medevac with Tony, especially when his presence seems to be making Tony confused.
The motions of finding a new life in New York are harder than Steve expected, especially now he has to let go of Tony again.
Thor and Bruce are out handling a dispatch call with a fallen tree branch, so he can't ask them for help.
“Why did you become a vet?” Steve finds himself blurting out before he can stop it, then he winces and tries to walk it back. “No offense – I just – you’re a Stark.”
"They want weapons?" Tony smirks. "I'll give them weapons. A stick so big they won't be able to lift it, so big it'll fall over their heads and flatten them to dust."
“Well, I’m making time now,” Tony grins up at him. They sidestep a pair of runners, continuing their easy stroll down Central Park, their stomachs full from their anniversary dinner.
“You're a grandpa,” Tony waves his spoon in the air. “Just you wait. I'll get you to like modern tech and racier ice cream flavors, Cap.”
The novelty of seeing him outside the baggy fire uniform is messing with Tony's resolve. That All-American
"I thought you hated bullying," he argues quietly, attempting to reconcile acceptance and betrayal and fear. He had known that their friendship couldn't last long, it was only logical, but he didn't want it to end like
And the reactor's just one of his many ideas that he knows will work, if only Obie would stop breathing down his neck about the lastest missile specs.
There are more useful things he can do than stare at the Captain. Groundbreaking medical research. Another surgery. Sleep. Or binge-watching yet another romcom.
“The hell I can’t!” he wrenches his arm away from her grip, but Carol shoves him away from the building.
"Will you help me or not?" Steve looks out into the dark seas crashing at the cliffs outside the windows, the ticking of the world fighting against itself.
It doesn't matter if Steve is displeased with him. He looks Steve right in the eye, taking in its blue, the frown between them and the stubborn jutting out of his chin.
Around Tony’s wrist, Steve’s hand squeezes. Light. Reassuring. Tony dares to sneak a peek at Steve’s face, only to be met with a smaller smile. Not a grin. A
Steve's communicator buzzes, and he very reluctantly shifts out from under Tony's arm to reach for it.
Steve glances at Tony's peaceful sleep, face slack with blissful rest. He's loathe to leave Tony alone, but he slips out of bed anyway to lessen the risk of waking Tony up.
,” Tony sternly says for what must be the hundredth time. “If Steve’s gift breaks, I’m turning your motherboard into a ping pong ball.”
Sentimental of him, yes, but he couldn't quite bring himself to peel of the stars and stripes Tony had so happily put on him.
To spare Steve the pain, Tony quickly threads the wound close. Loop, and gently pull, then loop again. Twenty three stitches later and Tony ties the knot near Steve's elbow, where he's less likely to disturb it than his wrist.
“I’m doing him a favour," he says lightly. When Obie doesn't immediately balk, he goes on. "The Captain's friend needs a prosthetic, and I’m
have," Peggy emphasizes, closing the gap between them. "Tony, you won't find closure by burning down everything."
“Co-bed the babies,” Tony orders. “Put her with him,” he points at two incubators, and then, “the twins go together, the two girls too.” Those are the healthiest infants, they can handle co-bedding, they can handle vertical evacuation. That leaves two more, including little Maria. “
Seeing Tony as carefree as this was a rare treat, and if Steve was being entirely honest, he chose his bodyguard shifts to coincide with these visits.
He leaves the food with the receptionist, who tells him it might be a few more hours before the surgery and post-op checks end. Steve nods his thanks.
This time, Steve can't hide the bark of laughter that escapes him, and the heat rising to his cheeks when Tony smirks. "Exactly like a guardian angel," Tony whispers conspiratorially at the children. "A very strong, very handsome, guardian angel."
“You really trust me, Cap?” Tony asks, trying to make the question flippant but utterly failing. It comes out raw, feeble, his defenses crumbling.
When he glances up, however, Steve calmly smiles, lips quirked up to one side with a thin line of soot across his cheek.
He's forgotten what it's like to be in the affections of someone as stubbornly hopeful as Steve - the way Steve had collected his wishes and remembers them for a rainy day like this when Tony can't find the faith to hope anymore. It's Steve who believes in those wishes for Tony, who fights the fight in Tony's stead when Tony can't muster the strength to keep fighting against the futility of everything.
She hangs up after Tony makes smooching noises to the phone. He's thrumming with the need to draw out his thoughts, the support beams he can already picture jutting out of the cliffside, a workshop drilled into the rock, an open air balcony as a middle finger to the stuffy mansion halls he'd been forced to grow up in, gardens and a sleek design: a proclamation that this is
? The thought comes as a punch. How many years had they spent loving each other in the wrong ways? Steve keeping assassins at bay and Tony adding shields to protect him? How does he move on after this?
The reply is even, ambivalent. Not too harsh, not too enthusiastic either. Tony decides he might try his luck, and he sits down on the other edge of the couch.
It's been nearly ten years since he last spoke with Tony. But he wears Stark tech that SHIELD provides him with. He knows he can trust his weapons, but he doesn't know if he can trust his heart.
Most had been those new sleek missiles, but the ongoing investigation and the clear marks of Tony's hand in designing them meant Steve couldn't reveal more. And even if there was no investigation, Steve doesn't have the heart to tell Tony how many people those weapons had killed -
don't get to meet him?" Bucky teases. "All these years hearing about him, I might break down his door for you."
Steve's only response it to shrug off his suit jacket, tossing it in the trunk, then he unbuttons his white shirt right
"Tony. I assume you're here for a reason?" Steve tries to broker some sort of peace. It's been a long day at SHIELD, and he really just wants a shower. Tony, however, didn't seem to be on board with that plan.
Across the table, Tony sticks his tongue out just the slightest bit – enough for Steve to notice it and nudge Tony's ankles in warning beneath the table. Unfortunately – or perhaps, fortunately – that only gives Tony the leverage to tangle their legs together.
Yet, even now, Steve managed to be stubborn as ever, throwing irrefutable proof of all the times he had tried to reach Tony, each letter growing more desperate as Steve wondered too why there was no reply, no answering word from Tony.
Shaking his head, Steve barely manages to keep his strength from crumpling the paper. "Tony wasn't - he didn't want anything to do with me."
Sam flips up his flight goggles, meeting Steve dead in the eye. "He's not listening to Rhodey, so do your best to calm him or that chopper's not going to be able to take off safely."
and intellicrops for your thesis while playing around with satellites. None of your dreams started with blowing things up."
But it had felt selfish, and when Bucky expressed the need to fight again to reclaim part of what he'd lost, Steve had thrown himself back into work.
“Fuck you," Tony curses, biting the inside of his cheek hard to ground himself, "damn you to hell. You can’t – that’s not fair.”
Wrong answer. It only provides Rhodey an extra point of attack that he relishes. “Has Mr. Jarvis gotten along with your murderbot yet?”
“I happen to like donuts,” Tony notes, taking a cautious sip of the coffee. It's as good as any of Natasha's drinks are, and he ponders whether saying '
"Growing up, I heard a lot about you," he starts, blocking the door. Now that Howard knows about Steve's friendship with Tony, there's less to hide. If Stane thinks he can use the past against him, he's sorely mistaken, because whatever doubts Steve might be feeling about his old friend, there's nothing as important as this. "I trust
There's a gleeful pleasure at flaunting all of Howard's rules, driving cars that Howard had kept far away from New York to be far away from Tony.
, he loves Tony so much, and he can imagine the pout on Tony's face right now, the furrow between his brows that Steve aches to kiss away.
But whether it's an old friend who smells like home or a stranger who tastes like a hundred different women, Steve doesn't know.
They were children in boarding school when Tony had dreamt about flying cars and rockets to reach the stars. They were fourteen when Tony had admitted quietly into the night:
Maria gives him a stern look. "The Captain. I sent him to get me those blueberry pastries you like."
“Don’t bring our kids into the fight,” Tony’s smile comes back, the heaviness in his head receding briefly. More confidently, he moves another inch towards Steve. There’s less than a foot of space between them now. “You smell sweaty.”
"Did I?" Tony moves on to the next bolt, letting the work distract him from the guilt. He hates having to push Steve away, but after what JARVIS found on HYDRA?
They're on the third floor. Hammer's lab has enough chemical fuel to keep a fire burning. To burn the entire building down with incompetence. He
this one's a rough one after the fluff, but i hope everyone's doing alright, and staying safe in this new year :)
“Teamwork,” Steve hands the clipboard back, trying not to jerk his hand away when Stark’s rough fingers brush with his. “You’re thinking of teamwork.”
Steve sucks in a sharp breath. Rhodey's face looks ragged in the video screen, tired with deep shadows that reflect the hollow pit of Steve's stomach, the gnawing, aching emptiness stretching on.
“It’s all public knowledge,” Tony starts, “my mother loved animals and she gave me what I needed to finish vet school, to build my clinics. Stane kept my father’s company.”
Tony carefully avoids the wreckage of the car, slipping between the railing of the bridge and the end of the electric pole. He scoffs internally at the rust on the metal, his engineer's mind noting the sloppy work. Some firefighters work on keeping the electric cables safe from catching fire, removing flammable debris from the car, and they part for Tony to pass through.
, in any way, disappointed that his rubber gloves means he can't feel whether the blond strands are soft or rough. This is his job. He can act more mature than a goddamned teenager.
“That implies you sometimes disapprove of me,” Tony cracks a helpless smilethat borders amusement and bitterness, “that sounds about right.”
The fire has spread up to the third floor by the time Thor's unravelled the hose and Steve has the truck's ladder up to the fourth floor, directing the spray of water to stop it from spreading further.
The passenger space that Steve climbs up to is cramped, half the floor taken up by Tony's stretcher, a doctor, a nurse, and Rhodey scrambling desperately to get Tony calm. The jacket that had been wrapped around Tony's head has been tossed to the floor, filthy with grime, and through the thin shirt he has left, the bright light whirrs loudly.
He insists on tailing Tony most of the time when his boyfriend isn't cooped up in the Mansion's basement workshop. When he spots the brown leaves signalling another turn of a season, however, Steve catches himself off guard.
Tony bristles at that, but for now, he holds his tongue. This prosthetics project was more important than his pride. He stands a chance at fixing some of the wrongs he's done to the world, and he knows his fight is better fought in a different way.
Huh. So maybe Steve isn’t as upset with him as he’d feared. Braving to move an inch closer on the couch, Tony carefully eyes the way Steve holds the book. Still relaxed. Good.
Tony grins wide, puffing his chest out for show. “Ha! I have America on my side.” He prods at Rhodes’ ribs, nudging the plate closer. “Gimme my waffles.”
“I'll take it from here, Officer. There are more useful things for you to do.” He waits until Quill leaves, then, he towers over Steve, “and
The conversation's hard enough without old family wounds flaying them both open. "Peggy didn't know that I knew you. Thought you didn't want Howard to know about us and you weren't that much of a celebrity yet when I still received your letters."
, he’s imagined this moment a million times before. He’s drafted a thousand more apologies in his mind.
Steve doesn't hesitate. He's known what he wanted since the very beginning, and he had nearly asked the question himself last week.
He thinks back to the magazine stand from earlier, the new weapons printed beside Tony's face, and all the truths he knows about Tony. He doesn't know who he'll find at the end of this - because he will find Tony. He
He sees it in the way Tony's eyes shine with wonder at the children's ceaseless queries about the stars, the invisible atoms, the leaves outside, and the old band shirt Tony is wearing.
changed, though. Somehow, Tony has managed to make edelweiss flowers grow beneath the glass waterfall, with a shrub of blue forget-me-nots tucked beside it, hidden away from view if you didn't know where to look.
A knock comes on the chopper's window: Sam, flying next to them in his Falcon gear, the Afghan sand dunes stretching beneath them.
"I'm sorry. I was an ass," Steve sighs. "I should have come back earlier, I shouldn't have let him push me away."
She shrugs. "You're spending an awful lot of time with my godson. More than your assignment dictates."
“With you, I want to do it right,” Tony ducks his head. “I just didn’t know how to ask. You know the team's been badgering me about you glaring at them almost every day?”
“Good morning to you too, Sir,” JARVIS quips quite unhelpfully, but the elevator doors open without Tony needing to say anything, the button to the common floor already pressed.
"You know, Jan from Accounting is still free if you need company," Nat grins. She flicks a switch. Ten minutes to location.
“Let’s get you more comfortable,” Steve murmurs. He hooks a hand beneath Tony’s waist and keeps his other hand cradled around Tony’s head, holding his breath until he manages to stand up without waking his boyfriend. Tony does shift around, though, nose pressing into Steve’s shoulder.
Tony didn’t want letters. He wanted Steve, but Steve didn’t want him. Hadn't wanted him in the first place.
The quickest way to get Steve to do something was always to challenge him. That, apparently, hadn't changed.
"Or the doctor," Steve kneels low to be level with Tony. He knows better than to touch someone in a flashback without permission, and he swallows down his guilt and fear to shove away the tremor in his voice, keeping his words firm and steady. If Rhodey can't bring Tony out of it, he doubts he'll be of any help. But he has to try. "Tony, you're safe. We found you."
They settle into a new friendship afterwards. This time, Tony isn’t the only one to seek Steve out. Steve will find Tony in the library, or the piano room. And they’ll sit with each other, Steve’s hands streaked with paint, Tony's with grease.
Was it too much to ask for a December spent working peacefully? He supposes that this at least allowed him to skip out of social engagements for the next four months, six if he played his cards well.
He stalks away, and Steve wants to follow, to stop him from exiting his life again. He’s about to stand when –
It's highly distracting to have Tony's teasing rewind over and over in his head. Steve slumps into one of the chairs, turning his phone around in his hand.
Tony kicks Steve's shin playfully under the table. "You're a dork." There's no heat to it, only a fondness that curls warm in Steve's stomach. "Captain America is a
There's a small slant to Tony's lips when he looks away ruefully. "Ten years, and you're still lecturing me to go to bed."
"If she doesn't kill me for this, I think I'd survive whatever she does," Steve says after a moment's thought, and
Of course, Steve wasn't foolish enough to believe that the people in SHIELD didn't have agendas of their own. Still, he'd trusted all the founders of the organisation.
The paint splatters on Steve’s hands are bright. A spot of green, a splash of yellow, drying up as Steve twists his hands together. Tony wonders what colors his own hands would be – drenched with red or covered with grey ash?
Obie drapes his hand over Tony's shoulder. "Well then, Captain, I promise to return Tony in good shape."
She moves to sit down on the bed, creaking its wooden frame, and pats the space next to her in invitation. "You're always welcome here, no matter what foolish things my Stevie's done to make you look at him like that - "
“He’s also in the fire department, so it’s natural that we have a rivalry,” Carol takes a particularly loud slurp of her juice. “
"Steve, I - I need to get my head on right. I need - not to break up with you," he backtracks on his plan. "Just a break." For around a year, until Tony figures out this HYDRA mess and deals with it. "Give me time."
From the reflection of the storefront windows they're facing, Steve sees one of the armors prepare to let out a blast, and he raises his shield above their heads, curling his body around Tony's to keep the falling debris from hitting Tony's unprotected body.
Tony scoffs, but there’s a brightness to his eyes that settles Steve’s worry. “I am in no way little,” Tony firmly says.
It would be easier if Steve had been pretending all along. He could let go of everything, let years of waiting and anger and jealousy consume him, instead of dealing with the hurt.
Scooping out several more spoons of ice cream, Steve slides it down the table. None of this is helping with Steve's flip-flopping stomach, but it makes his chest tight, warm in a way he's rarely ever felt.
Yes, he had Bucky, and now Sam, Natasha, Agent Carter - and yet, Tony had been his friend in a way that none of them could be.
"I know. He designed the cloaking tech for this bird last year. Right around the time you joined us on active duty."
"Now, Billy, leave poor Mister Steve alone," Tony waves one of the boys over. "Why don't we all move somewhere more comfortable?"
, what did I do wrong, J?” Tony runs a hand through his hair, catching on the tangles there, stifling a yawn. He hadn’t realised he was this tired.
He still kept all the letters that did reach him - envelopes marked with Tony's messy scrawl. They were neatly kept beside an even taller pile stamped with bright red letters long since dulled by dust and grime:
“You shouldn’t be so distracted,” Obie chides him when he stays in his room all week, trying to come up with a fitting reply to the letter. Then, Obie presents him with an early Christmas gift: new tools that Howard had forbidden, tools that Obie had persuaded to be allowed.
"You know what I wrote for my thesis," Tony rephrases the words because if he tries to say it differently, maybe they'll make more sense. Maybe he'll snap out of this fever dream and no longer be stuck on the seventeenth floor of this cursed building.
He doesn't know what to say next, so he turns around to Bucky, finding there the same shock and confusion. They all knew that sooner or later, a talk had to happen. With the mess that their lives were, he supposes sooner was better. Bucky, however, stayed adamantly against Tony for a few more moments before he gives in.
he could admire forever the way Tony’s cheeks crinkled when he laughed, or the way Tony would scrunch up his nose when Steve mentions pineapple on pizza.
All he can think of are the sand dunes of the desert, the clear starry skies at night and the – the distant wisp of smoke, of red hot fire exploding as a bomb –
Steve nods, stepping closer. "I know. But you're going to the campus of your dreams, Tony. One day, I'll get to say
' felt like an extremely loaded question in their current exploration of how well they fit in this relationship, but Steve thinks he doesn't have to ask the question to know the answer: no.
Seeing the spark of clarity in Howard's eyes is jarring, and the man's smile is empty, hollow. "I do," Howard tips the rest of the tumbler down. "My question is: can
A sound forces its way up Tony’s throat, caught between a scream and a tired huff of breath. He doesn’t think he has the bandwidth to deal with another argument. All he wants is a hug from Steve, maybe even a kiss if he’s lucky. Expecting any of that when he had essentially abandoned Steve last night would be an asshole move, though. Giving and taking. He can’t always be taking from Steve.
Besides, with all his shifts at the hospital done for the month, he can allow himself this evening of indulging in a fantasy fueled by the pleasant buzz of alcohol.
Scratching the back of his neck, Rogers shakes his head. “You've already called me crazy. No harm in calling me my name.”
Most nights, Steve ignores him, staring hard at the blank canvases slowly filling up. The quiet of the room is a calming respite from the inane chatter of Sunset and her other friends. Tony had always liked being alone, tinkering with things quietly, away from the spotlight that Sunset craved and Ty hoarded.
The unspoken message is clear. Sam’s way of gently telling him to not push his body too far, to take better care of it. A few years back, he might’ve gotten sullen over the reminder. Today, he’s getting better at letting others care for him, especially with Liberty making him used to having a constant friend looking out for all his tells. Steve lets himself quirk a smile.
“Seems you managed to,” Steve slides down the door, ending up seated right next to Tony. Liberty happily climbs into his lap, her tail wagging in Tony’s face.
Tony shrugs as best as he can with a cannula in his nose. “Most people say I give myself too much credit.”
But if Tony found it unsettling to be around Steve, then he might not be as welcome as he once believed.
Steve carefully watches Tony mingle with other heirs - and heiresses, in this case, Janet van Dyne. Tiberius Stone and Sunset Bain had been among the draft guest list to the private opening of the Met's latest art exhibition, as had Whitney Frost, but SHIELD's diversionary tactics were well-versed in keeping potentially catastrophic interactions at a minimum.
"Can't," Tony unscrews another bolt from the remnants of his rudimentary holotable. There'll be time enough to improve it when he gets to Malibu. "I've got to pack this all up."
"Mr. Stark," the blonde reporter raises her hand. "Your father has always had a policy of having the bigger stick. How does this change the company's choices going forward?"
A lady waiting at home was something to hold on to during the freezing cold nights in the trenches, and the ecstatic sounds of their ‘
“There’s no need,” Steve tries to say, but Tony presses the packet of treats into Steve’s gloved hands, just as a cab rolls up on the curb.
"I knew you were going to build a world worth fighting for, Tony. You never needed me for that." Steve's hand brushes against the star of his shield. "I couldn't ever build something this grand."
Steve seems appropriately chastised, offering Tony his injured hand silently. The left one, already with bandages wrapped around it. Most likely, the bandages were taken from the first aid kit open beside Steve. Tony moves the kit onto Steve's lap so he can sit beside the man, snapping on his rubber gloves and unwrapping the bandages to check on the wound.
He lets his smile linger until the door to closes behind Pepper. When it does, he motions for JARVIS to bring back his files. The AI was still learning, but it was enough for what he needed.
There might've been a time in college when Tony had taken to the vices Howard had taught him: the drinking, the parties, the women.
friends made sure everyone stayed away from me,” Steve challenges, “and my books aren’t unpacked. Those are the
"Don't pull over here," Steve nods his chin towards the strip of sand leading to an outcropping of rock. "You'll block the road less there, and I can change out of this."
All the partying he needs, he gets right here in between Natasha's badgering and Kamala's bright hope reminding Tony why he does what he does, why the city is worth staying in despite the hundreds more residency programs elsewhere willing to pay him triple.
Steve and Tony try to make sense of the spider's web they've found themselves in, and a car crash happens.
Fuck. Steve can't. He can't think. He can't look at Stane's sour face. He - he takes the cold metal of the ring out of its soft resting place. It's small in his palm, but with so much weight that Steve can't carry. Not this. Not this regret on top of everything else.
There are details in the agreement that weren't supposed to come out. Paralysing devices, remote-launch precision missiles, wide-range landmines. The weapons Tony had once tried to prevent from being made, the ones he now wants to fall into the wrong hands for the sake of having MARIA track them and blow them up.
Carefully, Tony takes the blackened shield off Steve's back and lifts up the nanotech fabric of Steve's uniform, hissing slightly at what must be the dark bruises from the impact.
“Stop that,” Tony forces the words past the sudden tightness of his throat, “I’ll start to think you really mean it.”
It sends Tony reeling. He had readied himself for a harder question, an interrogation into every corner of his life, like the reporters with their cameras liked to do. This felt too simple. A trap.
"You know that they had something to do with the missing weapons, though, the evidence Pep found - "
“Visiting beaches, going halfway around the world – JARVIS booked you first class tickets. I have a private jet, you know.”
"Good," Obie nods slowly, "good. You're going to surpass us all one day, my boy, and you need to keep your eye on the focus."
"It's alright. You're tired, and I can't - I, uh," Tony scratches the back of his head, not bothering to stand up yet, "did you mean it?"
“There’s an experimental division of the Army.” Steve’s chin juts out stubbornly, endearing and infuriating all at once. “They’ve accepted me.”
It's a quick and chaste thing, the dust on their lips ashy, but it's scalding, a hot brand marking a new beginning. When Steve pulls away, his hand lingers on the curve of Tony's jaw, rubbing gentle, almost unconscious circles over Tony's dimples.
Tony wants to promise, but the explosion rocks the building and sends them into a world of bright oranges and grey dust and - the ceiling starts to crumble, there's a sharp pain in Tony's leg -
He waits patiently for the pizza to cook, scrolling through his phone. There are well-meaning messages from Thor, a more demanding one from Chief Fury about paperwork, Natasha tagging him in another social media post about kittens, and a strongly worded email from Carol warning of his demise and various misdemeanor charges if he treats Doctor Stark wrong.
Other nights, Steve will tell stories about how he and Bucky had pranked a particularly unpleasant schoolteacher with a mix of grease and feathers, Tony's muffled laughs filling up the room. They never meet anywhere else, Tony had admitted quietly that Ty and Sunset wouldn't take too kindly to seeing Tony with Steve, and when Steve had offered to punch them for him, he had smiled wide, shaking his head.
Now, Obie must be referring to Tony's newfound push for another direction, and the investigation throwing everything into a frenzy. They've delayed product launches, halted manufacturing, seen their stocks wobble precariously on the market.
“The ice cream's gonna melt if it gets any hotter in here,” Tony says, eyes flicking away from Steve as he folds up the post-it note into a small square.
Which is all well and good, because Tony ends up spending the evening huddling next to Steve for the team’s game night, but Steve begins truly introspecting when Clint –
Stark Industries' production being ramped up, the company launching more breakthroughs than ever, the vest that had saved Bucky's life and the bombs that had nearly taken it, Natasha's teasing about the jet - the pieces fall into place, a horrible, dawning realisation.
“He’s investigating your company,” Rhodey tells him flatly, taking another long sip of his milkshake. “He could just be using your connection to dig for something.”
“Unless I want to be attacked by your needles,” Steve finishes for him, knowing when he's being dismissed. “I should stop crowding up your ER?”
“Thought I wasn't allowed to work?” Steve grins innocently, standing up too to take his uniform off the ground.
fingers grip around his, allowing himself to marvel at the fact that she might not be alive if he hadn't cut open her chest and fought for her heart.
Instead, Steve scoops up a spoonful of clear pudding from the cup Tony’s holding, and he settles back into the armchair before lifting the spoon up to Tony’s mouth.
"Tony better be down there," Rhodey mutters, "otherwise, when my C.O. gives me a dressing down for gallivanting with an Army Captain," he gives Steve an approximation of a grin, "I'm gonna put all the blame on that Stark tardiness."
Stark chuckles, arms still crossed. "You won't be quite as happy after you see Hammer's face. I don't understand
Regardless, Steve insisted on coming along, escorting Tony through the orphanage's bright red door. After some more back and forths, Steve was finally allowed to enter Tony's latest bulletproof town car for a short ride to one of the orphanages Tony doted on.
, he thinks, because in another life where he hadn't been building weapons since he was twelve, he might've stayed up through the night laughing together with his friend, painting worlds of possibility together over stretching summer holidays.
It's only later – after Tony has left, running from Steve badgering him to rest – that Steve realises he can't find his post-it list anywhere.
flustered, Tony wipes the back of his hand over his lips. "I'll have you know my body armors are already the best of the best."
Their anniversary was supposed to be four days ago. Until that became the day that Tony had to sign himself in as CEO, and he had kept the ring locked in its vault, because while he once was sure he could be happy with Steve, he doesn't know if Steve would be happy with him.
The conviction, the utter faith laced deep in each word should terrify Tony. He’s had people believe in him before, but never like this. Steve saw him as
Stark's lips twitch up one last time before he ignores Steve again, leaning over Kamala’s shoulder to ask her, “you understood that research?”
Tony sighs. "Plant yourself like a tree," he finishes the words he's heard her say a hundred times before. "I've tried. No matter how stubborn I am, Howard and Obie won't let me change the company's course."
But it was also a handy excuse to draw things out. "Maybe I just want to spend some more time with you."
And there are evenings where time will tick away quickly, slipping between their fingers until Steve finds Tony slumped asleep on the bed, surrounded by sketches of messy blueprints. Unlike Steve's cautious lines, erased and drawn and erased again, Tony's strokes have a boldness to them, a deep-seated surety, and Steve will spare a second to wonder at all the brilliance he doesn't understand before he collects the papers and moves them to his desk.
“No. I barely did anything except being a glorified biscuit dispenser,” Stark says. “Tell Miss Potts your visit is on the house.”
“I’ll bring the gurney back to the truck,” Steve gives Mrs. Carter’s hand one last reassuring squeeze. “You’re in safe hands here, ma’am.”
Steve's blond head makes no appearances, though, and the beta version of JARVIS on his newest phone detects no one unusual in the area.
But it was too late, anyway. Everything was tangled in a mess that felt too deep for him to dare to look closely at.
The chuckle that comes from the other end of the call doesn’t quite bode well. “That wasn’t a ‘no’, Captain,” Natasha teases. “And he’s also rich.”
It's more than normal for Tony to forget appointments - god knows how many dates Tony had nearly missed with Steve.
been expecting that answer. He’s also noticed, however, that Steve isn’t forcefully removing him from the room, which means that Steve doesn’t wholly want Tony to leave.
"No. I wouldn't put it past him to still be planning my demise, though." Steve waves at the empty spot next to Tony, as if asking for permission.
"I'm sorry for not calling sooner," Steve leans gratefully into it. Sarah Rogers is a small woman, but she holds him up as easily as ever.
Large hearts are a medical condition that Tony has built tech to solve, but he thinks, this time around, a large heart might just be his undoing.
"You're always planning something, Tony," Steve forges on with his mule-headedness, "and I can't seem to talk with you lately. I can't spend more than five minutes with you." Once again, he approaches Tony, this time going as far as to loosen Tony's grip around the wrench, Tony unable to be anything other than pliant when Steve touches him that gently. "I want to help," Steve pleads. "Just tell me how."
Reluctantly, Steve has to admit that he does need the help. Together, they take shelter in the ruined lobby of an evacuated office building. Tony steps out of the armor to prop Steve up against the receptionist's desk.
The small twitch in Tony's hand, the insides of his cheeks bitten just the slightest bit - Tony preens shyly, clearly doing his best to do otherwise. "Yeah, he's the best."
“Not at all,” Steve assures him, taking out a folded piece of paper from his jacket. “Just wanted to tell you Peter's aunt sent this to the fire station yesterday.”
"I'm sorry," Steve tries to say to Tony - sorry for not being able to protect Tony from Howard, sorry for leaving Tony behind all those years ago at the worst of it, sorry for not being able to wrap up the investigation faster.
Steve can practically hear Tony's teeth grinding. "I'll thank you," Tony says with no small amount of bitterness, "to look at yourself in the mirror."
"Don't be so arrogant, boy," Obie laughs, tipping his head towards Steve. "Captain Rogers, will you be joining us?"
And even if Tony never wanted to talk with Steve again after this, after the vitriol of their earlier meeting, he only needs to understand and perhaps have some modicum of closure.
Steve knows she's displeased that Howard had brought Stane along to the meeting, and she'll use Steve as a distraction to have a longer word in private with Howard later.
For Peggy to be so terrified to pull Steve off this mission means something went horribly wrong. It might mean that they need Captain America, or at the very least, the supersoldier beneath the stars and stripes.
The man sitting two seats down from Steve is carrying a tabby cat in his arms, and Liberty has been growling intermittently at them, putting her big golden retriever body between Steve and the cat. Liberty’s head reaches up to his hips when he stands – big is an understatement. Of course the cat would be afraid.
If he can't get his way with Stark Industries, so be it. He already has JARVIS secretly working on the funds and documents needed to build again another company, all for him to call his own.
"I told him he didn't need my permission to be happy," Sarah says, hand rubbing small circles against his back. "And I don't think I ever thanked you for putting a smile back on my boy."
"One car should be enough. They're waiting for us at the gala, and the earlier we come, the more money for charity," Obie leans on the doorframe, thoughtfully knocking on its metal. "I like what you've done with this cliff. They're calling this place the Malibu Mansion in the papers."
“I prefer to barge through. That’s a hard swipe left for most,” Steve bites his lips, uncertain. One small mercy is that Liberty seems content with only occasionally growling at Tony, too busy barking at the other passerbys to pay much attention.
Two weeks after what Tony has dubiously termed the Pizza Aberration, Steve Rogers has still not yet made another appearance at the hospital. Tony supposes he
He had come to California to escape New York, only to be greeted by a massive portrait of Howard in the lobby and a Regional Director determined to kiss Howard's ass.
“I won’t,” Tony fights against the sting in his eyes. This is for Steve. This is to keep Steve safe.
"We don't know if your father's accident was an honest accident, or a message of their brazenness, of their growing power."
Rhodey is another challenge: he pulls strings in the Air Force to add to his friend's security clearance, upping the standards of safety uniforms, and unsubtly telling JARVIS to keep a constant monitor, just as the new factory in LA keeps secret track of where each of his weapons are.
“How can I not?” Steve shrugs. “You told me you came here because you were bored. Your parents don’t know that I exist.”
He had ramped up his efforts to keep watch over Tony after the dreadful years when Bucky had gone missing - no one else should have to fall into HYDRA's hands, least of all Tony.
Steve is too angry for his own good and Tony is too smart for his own age, and when they meet in the autumn of 1983, they clash in the worst of ways.
The quiet also helps Tony talk, almost like he’s in the laundry room next to Jarvis, rambling on about his thoughts without any fear that he’d be told to be silent.
“Tell Bucky not to go, then,” Tony pleads, already half begging. The blueprints in his hands have never felt more useless, meaningless, and he sits up on the bed, back tense with panic.
That's... more mild than Steve expected, given how much Steve threatens to send askew by adding that extra layer of complications just for the sake of kissing Tony. In Steve's calculations, the heady rush of having Tony right next to him was worth it, but, "I don't - "
“Good night, Captain Rogers,” Tony gives the man one last wave, quenching down the incessant happiness bubbling up.
Steve spends the next two days studiously avoiding the Stark Mansion in New York. There are far too many ghosts there that he isn't prepared to face yet. Rhodey was right, after all. Neither Steve nor Tony had been quite as ready as they thought they were to try push their friendship in a new direction. Their edges were too rough, and Tony would've argued friction meant heat and heat was
Steve abruptly pulls his hand out of Tony’s pocket, as if scalded, and the loss of it stings. Tony chases it, pulling Steve’s hand back towards him. “Not now. One day.” The words catch in his throat.
,’ Steve had promised, voice low and smiling, and Tony had nipped at Steve’s collarbone in retaliation.
“My mother likes playing the piano. She taught me. Howard thinks it’s unfitting for a man, but Obie said something about the coordination skills being good.”
“You don't have to,” Tony's smile turns thin, his mask stretched too far and nearing its breaking point.
Except now, the warmth he huddles for is against a different cold - the creeping chill of loneliness he'd never noticed until Tony had come along, firebright and determined.
Slowly, Tony learns of Steve's inhaler, his arrhythmia and why he had been so spooked by Tony's arrival in the library. Tony took care to announce his presence louder, and if he whizzed through several bookshelves of medical books to spot the symptoms which meant he had to drag Steve off to the nurse, then, well. He was being a good friend.
he felt disappointed. He slides into a seat in the corner, waiting for Clint to finish setting up. Kamala spots him, making a beeline towards his table.
Until Steve takes Tony’s hands gently off the piano, wrapping his paint-splattered hands around the new calluses on Tony’s fingers.
, let go of the sweet comfort of Tony's arms, saved his best friend from being tortured, and hunted down HYDRA bases. He wants to rest. To put down all the
“You have been gone too long from the bar, Captain,” Thor announces. “'Tis time you had some fun. And time we remind them who the bar belongs to.”
He supposes he wants to find himself again, what he was before he was fully thrust into the spotlight and groomed to become CEO, before alcohol was a familiar taste to burn out the emptiness.
“No one is a lost cause,” Kamala grins at Steve. “Captain Danvers was the first responder when his parents' car crashed. Tony was the only one to make it out. Everyone knows that story. She's why Tony chose to stay in New York.”
Taking an alcohol swab from the kit and a numbing solution, he calmly dabs at the long gash that only bleeds out intermittently when he puts too much pressure on the inflamed skin around it. “Did you get scraped rescuing the driver?”
"Let him in!" Steve yells at them when he rounds the corner of the hallway. "I could hear you from four floors down."
“A portable IV delivery system,” Tony declares when he finishes sticking the needle into Liberty’s front let and strapping the small IV bag onto her back. “I designed it a few years back for some polar bears, modified it for at home use. She should be able to move around just fine.”
But it's too late. He pulls the device out of Carrie's hand, thumb jamming hard against the pressure sensor.
, that’s blood. The Shepperd, too, makes a low growl as Liberty lashes back out. There’s never been a time when Liberty’s been this fierce. Steve doesn’t know what’s wrong.
Rhodey calls in when Steve's plane is above Myanmar. His head is wrapped in bandages, medical staff milling in the background of the video feed.
Steve wonders whether he should reply to that, but before he can weigh his options – how to stay on Rhodes’ good side while keeping Tony this happy – Tony outright
"We're only doing our due diligence with this many weapons. My only interest is in keeping good men safe."
This time, Tony laughs a little louder. It makes his healing stomach twinge, but love was always worth a little ache.
When Steve lifts up the last spoonful, Tony shakes his head, wrapping a hand around Steve’s wrist and feeding it to Steve. He catches the way Steve’s lips twitch up into a half-laugh, but he doesn’t get long to admire it because suddenly Steve’s lips are suddenly on Tony’s, impossibly soft and caring and warm.
“I don’t want to make weapons,” he admits softly. He’s fourteen, and he just created a missile that Obie said would kill people better.
“Get yourself out, Tony,” Steve grips his phone tight to stop his hands trembling in relief. Tony is
“I’m sure Liberty disagrees,” Tony turns his smile on Liberty, who seems to have tired of barking and has resorted to growling low. He rummages his coat pocket for something, coming up with – is it in the vet’s job description to carry dog treats everywhere?
“I’m married to my work, and the press comes after me when they're bored. Not the best Tinder profile.”
Liberty growls, the leash pulled tight. Steve shushes her to no avail. “Sorry,” he tells Kate. “Libby doesn’t do well with strangers.”
If Steve knows where to dig to get under Tony's skin, then Tony knows intimately which the fractures to press on in Steve's armor. The way Steve jerks back minutely, almost imperceptibly, is jarring.
Even if Tony did his best to forget about Steve, to cut all their ties in anger, there would always be the looming spectre of their friendship. That thought would haunt him too much, especially when every new weapon he created for the government's arsenal could be the difference between life and death.
He drowns his thoughts out until all he can hear is the thundering drums that rattle against his heart, until he can forget, for even the slightest moments, that either of them existed.
"Exactly. You were happy whenever you dropped Steve home for Christmas," Sarah takes out an envelope from somewhere behind her. "And Steve would look at you like you were his world."
“You had the largest chance of survival,” Tony says, because they both know that this isn’t an argument that either of them will win.
did?" the first voice hisses, low and outraged, "you don't know half the things I built for that stubborn - "
Tony swivels in his chair, resisting the urge to wince. Whitney was the latest in the long list of ladies the press speculated was involved with him, and while they
Still, all those efforts must have failed in making Tony comfortable enough with Steve's presence, and Tony wouldn’t be so unkind to ask Steve to move out.
Tony doesn't know what changed that he finds himself trusting Steve. Maybe it's the winter snows that have finally come, blanketing the landscape in white. Everything seems stopped in time, a stillness hanging in the background as everyone rushes to study for their exams. Steve goes studiously through his books despite never missing a question when Tony quizzes him, and it's one of those nights, surrounded by textbooks about the long history of art, that Tony finds his courage.
“No morphine,” Steve says before Tony can ask. It lifts a weight of worry from him, just as it makes him squirm, uncomfortable with how quickly Steve has grown to know him.
"I'd love to meet the legendary Howard Stark," Hammer chirps with overt cheer, "Tony, certainly you would - "
who kept me awake last night," Tony waggles his brows, voice muffled from the burgers in his cheeks.
"He's a good one," Maria starts when they're out of earshot, mingled among the other guests who she waves politely at as she weaves them both through the crowd.
“Get Doctor Wilson back here. The other interns can treat a kitchen fire,” he orders briskly, taking over the chest compressions from the EMTs. “She’s going straight to surgery.”
Stark gives him a smile, but it’s all wrong. Sharp at edges that don’t usually show. “Not your fault that my heart’s broken.” Fingers drumming on his chest over his red scrubs, Stark lets out a long breath. “Shrapnel, from a car accident. Doctors saved me in time. Now I’m returning the favor. Balancing the scales.”
Right. That's it. "Steve," he says as sternly as his aching ribs allow him. "My leg is bleeding and my chest hurts and at least your chest is comfortable but somebody has a target on me and there's nothing except a few feet of cement separating us from getting burned to death." He takes a deep breath, finding some courage to meet Steve's eyes. In the pale light, he can barely see their familiar blue. "I'm gonna need you to spell things out very, very unsubtly."
Quill puts his arms on his hips, blocking Tony's view of his patient. Tony decides enough is enough.
"Thought so," Tony says in the silence. "You can see yourself out, and if you want tea parties with Howard, you can leave me the hell out of them."
In the last ten years, Steve has stopped fifty one assassination and kidnapping attempts on Tony. There was one particularly bad month with seven attempts, right after Tony announced the newest line of repulsor tech satellite targeting missiles, but Steve had stopped them in time and Tony went on walking to the next party without knowing that a sniper had been pointed at his head.
Steve smiles wanly. "America forgets her founding mothers too often. I won't make the same mistake." He takes in her paler than usual skin. "Have you taken your medicine?"
The office door swings open, and a harried-looking vet takes the clipboard from Miss Potts. His eyes immediately land on Liberty, who is sticking close to Steve’s leg and is growling low at the man.
Dimly, he notices the song changing to a quick waltz, the gentle pressure of Steve's hand on his waist guiding his suddenly uncooperating feet.
beautiful," Steve says softly. "Lonely, peaceful. We're so small - I, sorry. It's rare that I get this kind of quiet."
Coffee was something Steve made for Tony at breakfast everyday. It wasn’t special. Or marriage worthy.
"Ste - Rogers. I can't - I need water if I'm seeing mirages," Tony's hand grips Rhodey's shoulder tighter.
There's a missing link, Tony is sure of it, the puzzle pieces buzzing just out of his reach. It didn't make
good.” Rogers is wearing the same blue jacket tonight, laughing beside Thor and Jane at the opposite corner of the bar.
To her credit, her voice doesn't crack even if her eyes are red-rimmed, the mascara doing nothing to hide her grief.
When Tony leans up to glance at his leg, he manages to see the remains of Steve's suit jacket tied loosely around his upper leg before his ribs hurt too much to keep sitting up.
There's the small mercy that the will reading hadn't taken place in the Stark Mansion, Pepper choosing the more neutral New York Stark Offices. He swallows down the wave of nausea that had hit him when Pepper had taken the remarkably plain piece of paper out of the envelope.
"I wasn't unhappy," he defends himself, but the lie rings hollow in his ears, distracting him enough to bump against unfortunate guests.
He's dropped off more than twenty patients in the past six months into Doctor Stark's safe care, each time falling into conversation that gets easier and easier. Stark teases him about liking butter pecan ice cream and Steve badgers him for not getting enough sleep.
Neither did Steve. Tony never did get time to come visit during their school breaks, and Steve had long accepted that his two closest friends might never meet each other. "We went through a rough time together," he says, breathing through the phantom tightness of his chest. "Buck likes knowing I'm safe."
The coffee sloshes in the cup as Steve bends down to get Liberty’s attention, and it spills over his hand onto the gravel. Somehow, that makes the Shepperd only angrier, and it leaps towards them, Sam’s warning shout the only thing he gets before –
When that upward tip turns into a positively smug smile, Steve realises with sudden alarm that there's more to this than Stane.
This is it, Tony realises. He wanted to push Steve away, and this is the breaking point, where he needed one last push to send the cracks crumbling.
Ambulances jam the street, evacuating critical patients to the nearest hospital. Carol is down there, keeping the crowd from exploding into chaos.
It would be too easy to let his tools clatter on the floor, lean into the familiar comfort of those strong arms, and breathe in the same scent of
"Is this a guilt thing - or a near death thing - or a pity thing?" he rests his head on Steve's lap again, because
“Hey,” he lamely says. Fucking hell, he’s Tony Stark. He can do better. “Hi.” Scratch that. He’s tired of being Tony Stark, and he’s starting to think in circles again, which he’s pretty sure his therapist recommended he try to avoid. Shaking his head, he walks around the couch, hovering until Steve glances up from his book.
wrench, flashlight, scissors, rubber gloves, and – ah, bandages. Good to go. “You’re riding in the second ambulance,” Tony tells Sam. “Page Doctor Foster, get her to handle the ER. If she’s busy, page Strange.”
Kamala nods enthusiastically, and Steve sheepishly jogs to catch up with them as Stark continues walking Kamala into the ER. The room
“Paperwork’s not good for health,” Bruce repeats the argument he’s used a hundred times. “Besides, paperwork makes me angry.”
For a moment, Tony feels buoyed by the small, brief smile Steve flashes at him. His very own sunrise.
Steve is clearly one of them. Sam was the one to suggest a service dog through the VA’s support system, Natasha had picked Liberty out with him, and Bucky had given her the name. Maddeningly enough, for all that Liberty barks at everyone, she curls up peacefully around Bucky’s cat Alpine.
He tosses the phone on the bed, moving in such a hurry that Liberty gives him a questioning bark. He assures her with another pat, switching his sweater quickly for the white shirt. The doorbell rings again, in time for him to run downstairs, clicking his tongue to get Liberty to follow.
A gold blur rushes past him, the sound of a loud thump, plastic clattering on the ceramic tiles, and –
Tony sheepishly turns away from his phone, flashing Steve a small smile. “I was trying to see how long it’d take for you to notice.”
Always righteous. Tony could never be as sure as Steve, could never shake off the largeness of Obie's hand on his shoulder or the doubts that lingered even after everyone tried to convince him otherwise.
He never asked Bucky to give his life for him, he never asked Tony to give him a home. He won’t ask for Tony to give him any more.
"Mrs. Stark," Steve loudly greets, purposeful enough to stop Tony. Over Tony's shoulder, he's lucky he spotted Maria's approach before she heard snippets of their conversation, although less lucky when Howard approaches together with her. "Mr. Stark," Steve greets too.
Huh. Carefully, Steve takes a glance at Tony’s profile, scanning up from the leather shoes to the thick burgundy red coat that frames him perfectly. A man comfortable in his own skin.
He looks up to see Tony blinking awake. Steve takes in a deep breath, unable to stop it from shaking, and lets his hand finally touch Tony's arm, hot and clammy from the nightmare. "There you are, sweetheart."
The key card, Steve discovers in the privacy of the SHIELD-issued car, gives access to Tony's Malibu Mansion that Stane has so far barred any investigators from entering.
But the kiss doesn’t land on Tony’s lips. It lands squarely between his eyes, right on top of his frown as he scowls up at Steve.
This is Captain America, Tony realises with awe. Even without the uniform, he can see the way Steve inspires loyalty, the quick thinking paired with a kind heart that shines as a beacon of hope and peace in a world crumbling and screaming around them.
," Tony grumbles, held in place by Pepper's need to cover up a stray spot on his face. "This is overkill, don't you think? The sun isn't going to murder me, Steve. Be reasonable."
The words come out more garbled than that, and Steve huffs. “Except that your lungs are suffering from smoke inhalation, your heart had oxygen deprivation, and – ”
. He hadn’t come to bed last night. He had hoped to clear his head, get some space away from his argument with Steve to cool off before talking things out, but if he had let Steve sleep alone last night – that might only make things worse.
Their last year together at the school, Tony feels the time ticking away faster than ever. He wants to go to MIT, meet professors who might actually have a hope of understanding him, and yet, he doesn’t want this to end.
"My Stevie was always made for war, never giving up what he believed was right. If he chose you, then I trust that his heart knows what it believes."
He breathes in deep. Banner being here means the 107th was dispatched. No time for distractions, though.
"When I fought the war in the desert, all those years without your letters, I worried for you. I worried you don't get enough sleep. I worried that you fight with Howard," Steve attaches the cufflink on Tony's other wrist, thumb brushing over smooth silk. "Worrying doesn't help much, and if you really need me to leave, if that would really help, I'd do it in a heartbeat."
"Okay," Steve uncurls Tony's empty fist, thumb rubbing over the crescent moons on his palm left by his fingernails, "they'll be safe. I promise."
I’ll admit I’ve come very close to that during some parts of my life, but not recently,” Tony blurts out, indignant. “Recently I, well. It doesn’t matter.”
Sitting at the back end of the red firetruck, clutching his hand close to his chest, is Captain Steve Rogers. There's a scratch on his forehead, crusted with dried blood. His helmet is on the ground next to his boots, a small crack running through it.
Turning to Steve for defence, Rhodes waves his frying stick in Tony’s direction. “Captain, stop your delinquent superhero from stealing my breakfast.”
“Maybe tomorrow,” Steve takes a flower from the marketstand and tucks its bright red petals behind Tony's ear.
Here, Steve realises, Tony can give to the children the attention Howard had overlooked, and the flame to spark their own brilliance.
The windows have been shattered, and there's a large wall of rubble to the other side of the ruined room. Sirens ring loud in his ear, but he can feel all his toes and fingers despite the aching pains throbbing everywhere. Next to them, the shield lies gathering dust on the remains of the carpeted floor.
mention you. Told me you’re pleasant if I don’t catch you near the end of your shift,” Steve feels brave enough to say, which for some reason makes Stark squirm.
The last time he had tried to draw Tony, he had been frustrated at his inability to properly capture the fervent wonder in Tony, the constant, jittery movement, the kindness in his measured hands.
There are watermarks from the recent rain, the ticking down of time and life marring it. Steve clenches his fist, nails digging hard into his palm. "Where's the plane?"
“I wouldn’t mind,” Steve takes a kiss of his own, “and by the way, I expect the wedding flowers to be grown from your Intellicrops.”
Will the choices ever end? To take the serum or to stay behind. To crash the plane or to let the world burn.
"You know," Steve starts as Tony studiously avoids his gaze, "there was a time when I thought of the future and all I could think of was you."
Indulgent, Steve leans forward, but the warm press of Steve's lips fall over Tony's temples, at the crinkles of his smile there, soft and searing all at once –
Or as properly as he could while helping Kamala out of the truck and onto the hospital floor. Her arms had extensive second-degree burns. It was plain coincidence that she lived in the building Steve's unit had been dispatched to, and when she had insisted on coming to the hospital with the firetruck, Steve was secretly pleased because that meant he wouldn't have to worry too much about her.
Autumn means ten months since he started secretly dating his high school friend, and slightly over a year since their decade-long time apart ended.
Steve visibly considers that for a moment. The silence heavy in the air, he eventually walks towards Tony, picking out a small box from the drawer. "I'll always be your friend before anything else," Steve takes Tony's wrist and attaches the simple square cufflinks. "That means whether we're dating or not, I'll always worry about you."
Steve never really stood much of a chance with Tony, did he? As soon as the thought comes, he squashes it down. He shouldn't begrudge anyone's happiness, much less their life. He should be
"Your body is certainly the best of the best," Steve smirks, enjoying for once the slight pink on Tony's cheeks. Fair play for all the times Tony had tried to get Steve flustered.
He wants more. But if it’s not in the cards anymore, he can at least do his most to be brave one last time.
“There’s nothing you can’t do,” Steve repeats, “and no one – not your father, not this school’s stupid rules, not the reporter’s camera – can stop you.”
He meets Steve’s eyes head on, refusing to be intimidated. He realises, belatedly, that if he had wanted to befriend Steve, he shouldn’t antagonize him, maybe start with an actual apology. But Tony’s mind had jumped ahead several steps, and it was too late to back down now.
“Small, but not important.” Carol fishes out her phone. “Have you seen the fire station's latest post?”
hoard the spare parts he could squirrel away from Howard’s lab. One day he would have enough to build himself a small robot to help Jarvis make the morning juice.
"Have you run facial detection?" Steve asks JARVIS, who replies in the most disgruntled tone an AI can have.
Tony swallows, eyeing the corner of Steve’s smile, the clear playfulness there. “I’m warm enough here.”
Tony wonders distantly whether normal people were as recklessly stubborn as Steve. At this point, Steve most likely believes that Tony is an
“I listened to the recordings,” Steve cuts him off. “The conversation you had with the team when the two of us were trapped under the building and I was unconscious and you insisted that I was more important than you.”
Peggy's standoff with Stane lasts a while longer before Peggy gives Steve the subtle gesture to allow Stane's departure.
He’d spent most of that first week sleeping, but by the end of the second week, he’s staying awake for longer hours and getting antsy about not being allowed to move.
“We can have a very long engagement. Or not. Whatever you want,” Steve shrugs, pulling away to give Tony space to process, but Tony stops him, moving closer to Steve on the bed, a small smirk starting to form. All the shadows from his nightmare are gone, and Steve's life is brighter for it.
smile paired with the floppy blond hair Tony just wants to brush back – those weren't helping matters either.
“He has Jane's attention,” Steve doesn't even bother glancing at Thor going toe-to-toe with Banner in an arm wrestling match, a crowd of spectators surrounding them. “Besides, it's time the firefighters claimed this bar back from Carol's officers.”
Carefully, Tony takes the paper, unfolding it gingerly. A child's drawing, with a bright red firetruck in the background, a man with a yellow helmet beside it – holding hands with a man in a white coat,
"Captain Rogers, I presume?" Her voice is cheery and bright, Southern accent thick. This isn't Maria Stark. "I must apologise for not being dressed for the occasion," she continues, "I confess I didn't expect to meet you today."
“How did you know?” Steve asks back between his winces. It's clear that he's trying hard not to show Tony the pain, but to his credit, the wound stretches from nearly his wrist down to his elbow.
think Tony is in on this. "Peggy," he nearly pleads. All through the gruelling years of training, of receiving excruciating doses of the serum, never once had he broken to the strict discipline imposed by her. "I need to know. Do you suspect - "
A tight smile pasted on his face, Steve ushers Tony to a safer side of the room even as Tony looks back at Janet. "She's a
He's not sure whether she's in league with Natasha who has been trying to get Steve to go on dates. He puts that thought aside for the moment, though, more concerned with her arms than his heart.
Tony groans in reply, but without any heat to it. Fond. Hopeful, even. The morning sun bringing them both clarity that they hadn't had last night.
Peggy's gaze stays steady. "Mr. Stane, I don't need your permission. If thousands of Stark weapons can go missing, then you can forgive my abundance of doubt and
It’s only later, after the woman’s chest has been sewn closed and wheeled out of the room with unclogged veins working perfectly fine, that Tony’s mind starts to wander from the calm quiet.
Tony lifts his hand off the compass, shrugging. “JARVIS did it, but since I built JARVIS, technically I was the one who did it.”
“He also carried you out of the hospital,” Natasha adds, pausing by the door to smirk. “An authentic fireman's carry.”
And Steve had tried to surmount that: bringing coffee each morning, listening closely to Tony's ramblings – which means he now has an unusually intimate understanding of what ingredients DUM-E puts into Tony's green juice – and even going so far as to spend afternoons in the labs to ease Tony to his presence.
Steve isn't in the business of eavesdropping, but the serum meant he couldn't help it, and he feels his heart swooping down in dreadful expectation.
Tony isn’t sure what finally broke through Steve’s stubbornness, but he grins, victorious and wry. “Not until you answer my question.”
That - that hadn't been something Tony had considered. It flashes in his mind: Steve sparring with the other cadets. Had any of those sessions gone anywhere further?
, he's never going to make fun of Steve for being paranoid ever again. He's also going to design something that'll protect him from falling buildings. Maybe a suit of armor like those Arthurian knights Steve seems to resemble.
“Ah,” Kate nods almost exaggeratedly. “I should, uh, I should go.” She clutches her purse tightly. “It was nice meeting you, Steve. Really. I had a good time.”
There's precedent for it: Tony didn't start out liking Steve, and the more Steve learns of Howard, the more Steve has to concede that it's natural for Tony to have an aversion to Steve.
They lie there together in bed, for the longest time, breaths falling into step with each other, too busy smiling to say anything.
Rhodes actually laughs at that, soft and rueful, before he schools his expression back into his earlier fierce protectiveness. "I'll tell him you stopped by."
“'m tired,” Tony sleepily mutters into Steve's skin before lifting his head up from Steve's stomach and opening one eye. “We're having our proposal sex tomorrow morning.”
"I'm glad," Steve nods. He himself might not be the best for Tony, but as long as there's someone looking out for his old friend, it's a relief to know that Tony hasn't been going through all these years alone. And yet, Steve isn't blind to the optics of it. Only something big would nudge Tony enough to seek Steve out himself after the fiasco that had been the brunch with Howard. "I'm guessing you're not here just for a social call, though."
Obie shakes his head, pushing himself from the table and towards Tony. He hooks a hand over Tony's shoulder, pressing down on it. “I know you used to be close with the Captain."
“Thank you,” Tony tells her, letting her read between the lines because she won’t accept it if he says it outright. There’s nothing to forgive if they don’t find a way.
Pleading the fifth, Tony decides that if his mind insists on him being caught in this embarassing fever dream, he might as well enjoy it.
Another squeeze from Sarah, her hold on him steady. "You've both changed," she agrees easily, "my Stevie still draws everything he sees, though, and you still point out my kindness before anything else."
All Steve wants is a chance to breathe: he's become a supersoldier, fought on hundreds of battlefields, protected Tony from a bombing at the
"Because I see their faces!" Tony whirls around, clenching tight around the wrench in his hand. "I think about what or who might've killed them, and how I could've made something to protect them." The truth. This was the truth he could give Steve. "Do you know what it's like - to be called the smartest person in the world, and yet somehow I'm not smart enough to realise my parents' car had broken brakes? Somehow I'm not smart enough, rich enough, to save my own mother?"
“I don’t recall hearing a proposal,” Steve tips his head to the side, “Tony Stark, making an honest man of me?”
He should say something – anything, to get Tony to stay even a minute longer, because Steve reckons he could talk with Tony until the sun rose and set and rose again. He
“My Ma used to make these puddings,” Steve picks up a pudding cup from the tray he’d brought in. “She gave them out to her patients at the hospital, and she was always happy that she’d helped make their day a little brighter. When the tuberculosis got to her, I made this pudding for her.”
Steve does his best not to tap his fingers nervously on metal table. Between Steve and Tony, they’ve hauled Liberty on top of the table for Tony to check on her.
Part of him wants to laugh, but the blood pooling near the corner of his lips tells him that isn’t the best idea.
But Steve had needed the Army's money to keep up with his medications, and his Ma's own treatment bills, and -
"Ms. Carter, we have done our best to find the flaws that led to our missing weapons landing in enemy hands. You have no proof of systematic, high-level misconduct, only the amateur mistakes of interns."
“You know,” Steve takes a step closer towards him, “if you wanted me to keep you warm, you could have just asked.”
Being back in the cold November winds of New York after a week in sunny California was dampening his mood, and being forced to come to another one of Howard's galas made him utterly miserable. There was no point in him being here other than Obie and Howard's insistence that he be groomed to be CEO, except Tony's gone through enough etiquette lessons to know how to strike up conversation with a
Tony juts his chin out, another mask falling into place over his heart. He has to be strong, because this is the only way he knows how to keep Steve safe. “You don’t know who I am.”
Lips tipping up to one side, Steve smirks amusedly. "Shame. I'd be fine with putting out on the first date."
"Technically," Tony says through gritted teeth, finally lying down on the stretcher, a bead of sweat running down his hairline, "I found you."
"Thor, light their asses up!" Tony yells in the comms, "there's a patch there that seems to be the mainframe access."
"When you’ve found somebody who makes you brave enough to love yourself, don’t call me. Don’t write me letters. Don’t try to find me.”
Something flickers in Steve’s eyes, hanging between reluctance and revelation, but the hard set to his jaw had loosened the tiniest bit, and Tony knew he had won this fight. Even if Steve didn’t always believe him, he had always had faith in Tony’s abilities.
Balancing the cup cautiously with the leash wrapped in his other hand, Steve sips the drink happily. “Good. There’s a gallery showing soon, and my art’s going to be featured.”
"I was rather, uh, distracted when they were inventing it," Tony says, "but I encrypted this flashdrive."
Someone else bumps into Steve's shoulder, more gently this time. "Go on," Sam's voice comes to him as if from far away. "
At the other head of the conference table, Peggy clicks her pen. "Don't bully my agent, Howard. This is a serious matter."
The thing is, soldiers leaving their beaus for war would often pop the question on their last night, with too much whiskey in their veins to cover their shaky hands at the thought of war, of death.
That couldn't possibly add up. Tony has met thousands of soldiers, has listened to Rhodey say that Tony was one of the people he loved coming home to, has learned from their stories that out in the foreign sands of war, there were memories you needed to hold on to so your hope could keep burning.
Steve debates whether or not to stay. He has his own schedule: a visit to the children’s ward at the hospital, lunch with Commander Hill about protocol. But it’s barely half past six, and he smiles down at Tony peacefully taking his next breath, all the earlier tiredness and pain gone.
"You don't get to say that!" Tony half-yells, keeping his voice down at the last second, because Sarah doesn't deserve to hear this.
“I can feed myself,” Tony has a second to protest before the spoon lands between his lips and the sweetness explodes on his tongue, and he’s chasing for more of the taste.
"Your spine might've cracked if the bot's blast hit you," Steve lets out a sigh as the salve works its wonders to soothe the throbbing mess of his back.
“Is this some sort of conspiracy?” Tony groans, glaring pointedly at one of the cameras. “J, you better have some good results for me, or else – ”
“Mr. Jarvis,” he hopes forgiveness isn’t impossible. He's twenty seven, and yet he feels a ridiculous need to straighten his own shirt, the stern glare making his new body feel impossibly small. “Is Tony home?”
, Steve’s mind supplies. He wonders how many more facets there are to Stark, wonders if he’ll ever get to know them all. “Just because your heart’s broken,” Steve slowly says, “doesn’t mean you’re heartless.”
Going back to bed with Tony was an option, but Steve doesn't think he'll be able to sleep, or to even touch Tony when a secret this big was wedged between them.
Tugging his underwear away from Tony, Steve glowers at him, torn between his frustration and his fondness for their easy banter. “Why what?” he relents.
“You didn't need to.” Taking two spoons and bowls from the drawer, Steve opens up the tub of ice cream. He scoops some ice cream for Tony –
Hearing the noise, Liberty slowly makes her way out of the bedroom to the table, settling herself between their legs.
Acceptable risks – they took risks every day on the battlefield, and they’ve learned that getting hurt was an inevitability. They could scream and rage at each other about not being careful enough, about being too reckless, but that would only end up hurting them more.
Tomorrow is the new year, and there are no galas, no parties, not when the world mourned and the country grieved the loss of a national hero.
"Buck, we need to pack this up. Everything." The Stark Industries logo stares accusingly back at him. "These are top of the line. We can't let them disappear again. Whoever bought this much of it - whoever
And since their conversation last night, Steve wonders if any of them really knew the Tony to Tony Stark. He spots Tony barely eating, his hands busy with something. Sunset was prodding him about something, her smile turning sharp when Tony barely minded her.
"Perhaps not. Or perhaps yes. Perhaps you are the future he never had the wisdom to imagine," Peggy spins them both through the kitchen, edging them further away from the window. "He wanted you safe, for whatever reason, and HYDRA wants you alive because no one else can make the weapons you do."
"If by race you mean utter victory, yes. A lot of the research behind our product development already uses massive amounts of computing not available in the market yet, but let's keep that a secret for now, yeah?" he winks as the cameras go off again in a flurry of bright clicks.
Steve stares up at the impressive mansion, refusing to be daunted. There are numerous reasons to be nervous, to run and never go back, but the building isn’t one of them.
Naturally, however, HYDRA decides to cut their soirée short, and as they evacuate Manila from the army of fake Iron Man armors, Steve pulls Tony down behind a small car, cursing when Tony's wrist still beeps, waiting for the armor in the Singapore warehouse to reach them.
Whoever had painted Tony standing still, they either did him a disgrace by keeping his face so blank of feeling, or the friend that Steve once knew had grown into someone else entirely.
He wrenches the door open, not daring to look back. He doesn’t think he can bear seeing Steve for a second longer. Why hadn’t he just stayed with Ty and Sunset? At least he knew that they cared only for his money, at least he wouldn’t have been tricked to give away his secrets.
Natasha must pick up on his short temper because her tone turns more sober. “One of those white shirts that’s definitely two sizes too small. Simple, neat, flattering, but not too suggestive.”
." Sitting up, Tony uses one hand to help Steve up, his free hand sending repulsor blasts to any bots who dare come near.
In the privacy of the apartment's small living room, Steve lets himself properly reorient what he knows about Tony. The untameable hair is a constant, but with a more angular, clean-shaven face, Steve understands why Tony wouldn't have any hardship getting girls in bed. His suit, clearly thrown on carelessly over a smudged shirt, screams of all the wealth Tony never used to care about.
“You think our weapons don’t save lives?” Obie’s tone turns dark despite his smile. “Tony, all those American soldiers, they come home because of you. If you waste your time on some hippie project, they stop coming home.”
," he insists, because he's tired of everyone telling him he can't. Sure, the arc reactor isn't as efficient as it could be, but even at its most expensive, the reactor could end the war for oil altogether.
, Steve, just this once. Just this once, can't Steve run away from a fight? "Especially if they make the connection between Captain America and Steve Rogers and the shield."
“Carol told us to tell you she's not above cuffing you to the bed,” Natasha smiles. “And I'm not above tasering you if you try to leave before Sam discharges you.”
He can practically hear Natasha rolling her eyes. “Let me try setting you up in a dog park next, Steve. Give Libby her own chance to work out some frustrations.”
Still, Tony gives him a thumbs up, and when Obie walks out of the room, Tony winks at the nearest camera.
“Who are we talking about?” Carol’s voice interrupts, and oh, Tony might’ve made a mistake ignoring her entrance, because Natasha grins wider than he’s ever seen her smile.
With Rhodey distracting Steve using military talk, Sarah gets free reign over Tony, stuffing him full with cookies that taste like home.
A balancing act. He hasn't gotten it quite as well as Peggy could balance everything, but he doubts Peggy would manage to keep quiet either if this went on longer.
Well, except for JARVIS who is most certainly judging him. The bots follow him to the holotable that flares up with various machine parts that Steve tries to piece together in his head. He thinks he's looking at the schematics of the newest Jericho missile, and there's a collection of - "Was Tony planning to launch a new line of health tech?"
She says his name reverently, as if she can't quite believe that she has him here. Once, he had resented her for it, unable to reconcile the distant woman of his childhood with the mother trying her best to make up for lost time. Now, he cherishes what little time he can spend with her, marvelling whenever he unearths her dry wit and steely core hidden beneath decades of carrying a reputable image for the Stark name.
Beside him – because there really is less than five inches of space between them – Steve laughs quietly. “I’m sure we can find something else to argue about soon.”
Peggy's reply is soft. "You can. You must. We'll keep digging, in different places, in quieter ways."
That, it seemed, was not acceptable to Tony, whose jaw tightens with displeasure. "If there are lives on the line," Tony hisses, voice low, "if there are lives on the line, I deserve to know.
“Go home, Steve,” Tony opens the cab door pointedly. “Not good manners to let your girl out in the cold so long.” On cue, Liberty barks yet again.
Of all the questions she could've asked, Tony didn't imagine it to be that. "He has fewer headaches now that I'm grown."
“When Cap's gotten the kids out, I need you to replace the power supply of the incubators. They're running on emergency power right now.”
He can only be grateful that a vacant cab rolls over a handful of seconds later, Kate giving Steve one last pleasant smile as she gets in.
Steve opens one eye, blue and bright. “People like you.” His smile tilts higher. “My mother was a nurse. She helped make lives better.”
Once sure that Tony is in the bathroom, Steve goes back down to slowly bring Liberty up to his own room, where her bed is wedged right next to Steve’s bed. By the time he finishes tucking her in, he hears the shower stop. He moves to sit at the dining table. One more thing: he boils the kettle to make some black coffee for Tony, tea for himself.
"We need to tighten security around the Mansion and the Malibu construction site," Steve immediately comes up with contingencies.
Then again, a clipboard is waved under Steve’s nose, and, “Captain Steve,” Stark says with none of his earlier softness, “if you’ll kindly do the rest of the paperwork for Miss Khan?”
Tony nods. The IV needle in his arm is uncomfortable, and now that he's more awake, he's also more aware of the pain in his chest.
to hug at night,” Steve corrects, taking another step closer to Tony. His pride isn't worth Tony being upset.
"I don't know you," Steve starts, "I know you used to recite the Fibonnaci when you needed to fall asleep, that you've memorised Pi to the thousandth digit but can't remember what you had for breakfast. I know you discovered AI and built a bot to help you hold things."
emotionally compromised for this, but he trusts that he and Bucky can be enough of a distraction for Nat to dig through unseen.
The flowers are forgotten, Tony has to bear with Ty’s angry mutterings for the rest of the week, but he finds that it’s an educational experience.
," he curses, wiping it against his suit. Ten thousand dollars, whatever - his dry cleaner will wash it off.
