He drifts through the next time, listening to the sounds of them together, their voices rising and falling, the smacking of flesh on flesh as Steve lets himself chase his own peak.
He's draped over the wedge once more, a sheet pulled over it to guard him from the worst of the wet spots. He can feel soft kisses press down his spine as Steve whispers how good he is, how perfect, as his lips drift lower and lower.
Of course, all of them are capable of it, perhaps even Tony more than any of them.Because Tony knows violence, and he knows whether he's on his knees worshipping and being worshiped by his bonded, or on his feet fighting with them side by side, though they are surely all capable of it, the thing they all share...
He floats, suspended in blue nets of light that turn him, tickle him soft and sweet til he giggles and purrs. He sways in their grip, blanketed in the warm glow that stripes down his skin in firm brushes. He sighs and hears his name from far off. Beloved voices beckoning, and the blue light fizzles out on his skin, whispers of kisses as it releases him to hands warm and full of tender care.
Tony feels proud, a soft, bubbling thing. He's feeling good and floaty, happy and a little bit punchdrunk. He hears a distinct, “I’m gonna fuck the shit outta this ass.”
Steve watches as Tony tenses, his back bowing off the bed, hears him give a vicious alpha rumble as he finally comes, hot spurts shooting high enough to hit Steve’s chin, knot forming fully without even so much as a hand to squeeze it, and Steve pounds into him, chasing his own pleasure even as Tony howls his name and he comes and comes and comes.
. Oh god, oh yes. Tony is so full. Fuller than he's ever been, fuller than he would have thought possible.
As he watches, Tony cries out, another sound Steve hasn't heard, desperate and reedy. Tony leans back, his spine curving into a delicious arch as he grabs his ankles, head thrown back, long line of his throat glowing with sweat in the blue starlight from his heart. By some wordless command, the toy thrusts faster and Tony makes guttural noises deep in his chest, his cock bobbing and dribbling, crystals of delicate blue light caught in clear beads on the tip of his cock.
Steve is a master strategist, skilled in planning and implementation of said plans. So he plots, and he plans, and he maps out exactly what he wants to do. He thinks of every contingency, goes over and over each scenario in his mind.
Innocuous things burn like afterimages into Steve's mind, leading his thoughts right back to the revelation of his completely misunderstanding Tony asking if he wanted to top.
“Oh fuck. You’re gonna kill me, fucking me with your own slick.”
and he
Tony made a strangled sound when Steve felt the harness of Tony's cock rub against his abs. He couldn't resist dipping down to mouth at it, taking it into his mouth to suck gently while Tony shuddered and tugged at his hair.
Tony blinks once, twice, and then goes so pale Steve is alarmed he might pass out.
“Hey yourself, big guy,” Tony whispered. “I’m all ready for you, if you still want to do this.”
He wasn't sure how long they had been at this, the pair of super soldiers had come at least twice each already, but Tony was denied. He would be until they were finished with him or he reached the end of his endurance. It wasn't anything new. In fact, it was a favorite of the two when they asked Tony for some time with just the two of them.
His voice is shaking, but it's okay, because so is Tony's when he answers, "There's no one I would trust more. I love you so much it scares me a little."
Inside, Tony is only lit by the blue glow of the reactor, the light revealing him to be straddling what looks like a sybian saddle. Upon closer scrutiny, it's obviously something custom made, which isn't surprising considering Tony. The lines of the object are graceful and slick, calling to mind the flow of the armor Tony fights in.
“Steeeeve,” Tony moans, eyes rolling back in his head. “Harder, want it harder…”
The moan of pleasure Tony lets out at the first sip of his morning coffee echoes in Steve's skull for long minutes, until Bucky nudges him with a questioning look.
Steve makes a sound of approval and leans back, his hands going to caress and squeeze the derriere he's suddenly become so possessive about.  And
He was pressed so firmly between them, sandwiched and surrounded. His blood was pounding in his ears in a bass
And the only thing to do is kiss him, this wonderful man, this alpha who gives things even when he is afraid, even when others have hurt him. He gives it to Steve because Steve asks for it, and - he hopes - because Tony knows Steve will give it back to him in return. Steve kisses Tony until he’s breathless, panting and moaning and squirming against him.
Bucky looked at him, horrified. He grabbed his arm and hissed, “I can't believe you did that! What were you thinking? This isn't the early 1800s, packs don't do arranged marriages anymore!”
Clint held him back cackling as Jan ran inside. “Tony! Tony I have something to tellllll youuuuuuu!” she sang with glee. Steve broke free of Clint and charged inside after his cousin. He caught her before she reached the stairs, and he wrapped an arm around her waist to hold her. He covered her mouth with his other hand just in time, as Tony came trotting up the stairs. He paused at the top, taking in Steve with his hand over Jan’s mouth, and Clint on the floor where he fell when Steve broke free. And since Clint had brought it up, it was hard not to notice how handsome Tony was. His eyes were large and expressive, framed by dark lashes. His hair was thick and shiny, the same color as the fur lining his back when he was a wolf. He knew from sitting beside him earlier that under the metal and soot he smelled like cinnamon. It reminded Steve of mornings spent making cinnamon rolls with his mom, and making cookies around Christmas.
“Just for the record, I love you too.” Tony whispered hesitantly, shy as a deer, and Steve felt warm from head to toe.
Tony didn't feel like he should be in charge of his own life, let alone the whole country. But if the people had voted for him, then he would do it. He owed the people of the districts so much more than a year of his life.
“Wow! Would you look at that! $21 grand! I must have gotten confused. Oh well, silly me! Now there is absolutely nothing stopping you from finally closing this account.”
“No! Let me out! This is a mistake!”
“You good now?”
They all drank. Now that the bond was complete Tony felt a constant wave of love from Steve, and in the back of his mind he could feel pride and satisfaction radiating from Liberty. Finally all was as it should be.
“There weren’t as many flying cars in the future as I was promised,” he complained, resting his head of Iron Man’s dark red shoulder. That was the other problem with Iron Man, he was not nearly as soft to lay on as Tony. Steve could fall asleep on Tony, he was so soft and warm and safe. And Tony would complain that he made his arm fall asleep, but he never pushed Steve off.
Jan put a hand over Clints mouth. “We haven't seen him since last night. Where have you looked?”
Tony had always been told that people in the districts thought that computers were the work of witches and any school beyond learning to spell made them prey to the devil. Who was this guy? Was he special? Who had he learned from? Were there other people in the districts like him?
“You realize that he-” she was interrupted by a buzzer and the clock on a screen to the side flashed 0. She gave up on what she was going to say. She stood up and held her microphone close to her face, walking up to the edge of the stage with fake cheers played over the speakers mounted above them.
“Look, Steve, I’m sorry. It’s my fault you were hurt. I didn’t know you guys were on the field and I said a warning I was detonating the guns through the comms, which you didn’t have because I haven't issued anyone comms, codes or weapons yet. I was too busy throwing a fucking pizza party, pretending we were a family instead of a defense unit.”
Brian frowned. “I'm afraid I don't know.”
Steve was going through all of his worries again with Clint when he heard a commotion and turned around. Tony was stalking through the crowd, clearly looking for someone, while Pepper followed a few steps behind. Steve frowned. Tony wasn’t supposed to be here yet, it was a quarter 'til the wedding.
They spun him around to look in the mirror and he hated how familiar he looked. A little thinner, a little tanner, but otherwise identical to the time he had stepped out onto the stage as Game Master. The games had ruined him on the inside, and on the outside he was as untouchable as he always was. A perfect shell wrapped around a splintered core.
The team looked at each other grimly. Thanos was on his way, and they had only a few months to prepare.
Tony wiped his mouth off with a napkin. “What are you waiting for? Help yourself.”
Obie laughed. “Live? Why would you think that?  No, everything goes through a round of editing before we broadcast it tonight. It’s so we can edit out trouble makers like the boy from 12. We don’t need to be broadcasting rude gestures and profanity, children watch this show.”
Tony nodded. “I knew it. Don’t worry, you’ll always be my best friend. If I spend time with him, I’m not going to stop having time for you.” He assured him. Now Steve was all tense again. Maybe he needed more reassurance? He didn't want Steve to walk away upset, and not just because he didn't want to spend his free time fixing broken doors and reordering silverware to replace the bent stuff.
“Steve, I must confess….I’m a mermaid.”
“How...suspicious.” said Tony. “Wait, did I say suspicious? I meant unfortunate. You poor thing.”
“He just spent the last half hour looking for you under the beds.”
“You’re saying a lot of things out loud. I’m glad the rest of the team is in the waiting room. The doctor will be back in a minute, he said you’re going to be fine. You have a concussion that should be gone in a few hours, and you’re about to go into surgery to get the metal shards out of you. They don’t have any of the drugs Helen made that work on you, so we’re waiting for Sam to get back from the compound.”
Tony opened Steve’s gift last. It was a large thin package, and as he tore the paper away a painting was revealed. Tony stood in the center, with his family around him. To his left his mom stood next to Jarvis, who had his arm around Anna. Pepper, Rhodey, and Happy all stood together smiling. DUM-E and U shared a spot in the corner, arms raised. On the other side, the Avengers stood tall and proud. Natasha and Clint leaned on each other comfortably. Bruce stood in front of the Hulk. Thor was accompanied by Jane, the only one in his uniform instead of civilian clothes. Steve had given himself the place of honor next to Tony, and their painted figures were holding hands.
“Sure. Sold any paintings yet?”
Hammer signed off, and they were left in silence. The group looked at each other. This was the problem Tony had noticed in their alliance from the beginning; they couldn’t all win. After being separated he had been half hoping to see the other’s names in the sky, because as horrible as it would be for them to have died, it was better than having to face them like this.
“Spill, or else I’ll go ask Tony. And you know he overshares.” Natasha threatened. Steve was unimpressed.
“I noticed you liked the pizza last time, so we’re going to get more tonight. This place is called Archie’s, and they have the best deep dish.”
Bucky shook his head sadly. “It’s only a few days. You think anything could keep me from you guys now that I know you’re alive? I just have a few suspicions I need to look into for the good of the pack, then I’ll be right back, promise.”
Jan then raised hers. “To a fixed furnace and finally some fabulous friendship!”
“Ok?”
“Holy shit,” Steve whispered. He looked up at Tony. “Holy shit!”
“And through bad.” Steve finished, and they polished off their drinks.
“They’re arguing over who has to cook. I ordered pizza while they were fighting, they’ll stop as soon as it gets here. Room ok?”
“Did you get anything from the other guy there last time?” Asked Natasha, spinning a throwing knife between her hands. Where had she even gotten that? Did she come armed to breakfast? Tony wasn't as surprised as he would have been a few months ago before everyone moved into the tower with him. The first few weeks had been a wild ride. Now they were all used to each other, and as much as he denied it, he loved the company, knives and all.
And at that moment Tony stepped into the room with a grin, saying “Well that should be easy Beloved, I’m right here.”
Peacekeepers entered with buckets, and tossed water on the window until it all washed away in white streaks. Tony stopped the footage.
In the middle of the aisle a camera watched, recording their performance and broadcasting it to the rest of the Capital and all of the Districts.
“Tony no! No!” He mock wailed.
Tony took a heaving breath. “Because you weren’t there. No matter what I do, you die. If we’re friends, enemies, strangers, if we fly or drive or run. I’ve tried a million combinations a million ways. You always die. And if I kill the queen, you stay dead.”
Thor yelled, “Silence your infernal box before I strike it down myself!”
Steve returned to the fight, where Bucky and the new wolf Coulson were circling. Stane was snapping at them, and the longer he fought, the bigger he seemed to get, muscle straining out of proportion, limbs lengthening in uneven spurts. Stane lashed out with a misshaped limb and Coulson went down, skidding across the room and slamming into a row of empty chairs. With the others fighting the guards, that left only Steve and Bucky to face off against Stane.
“I am nothing to the king now, because he has been slain by one of Stark’s swords, wielded by Loki’s hand. The both of them are in their stolen castle, counting their riches and tightening their hold over the kingdom as we speak.”
Tony had never been hurt before. He had been a quiet and studious child, spending his lunches inside studying instead of playing. Even as he got more adventurous as he aged, he was still kept safe. All dangerous activities were banned from the Capital, and their medical technology had advanced to a point that they could heal any injury fully within minutes of it being received. When he got sick, he took a pill and was better seconds later. When he sprained his ankle on the stairs, he was fully healed and back on his way seconds after the medical team arrived.
“You ready to go home?”
He got up and stalked out of the room, and peacekeeper shutting the door behind them and standing in front of it with his arms crossed.
Steve nodded, sadness turning into bitter determination. “Whatever it takes.”
Tony turned it over curiously. “You got me a gift? Why?”
“Not many people do. I'll win him over.”
He heard Steve back away, and he felt a pang of guilt. Steve didn’t deserve to be snapped at. He turned around to apologize and saw Steve climbing up the river bed with his hands cupped. Steve came closer and offered his his hands, filled with icy river water.
“Steve, are you ok?”
“We have your costume!” A different stylist said, holding up a sequined baby blue tuxedo. Tony shuddered in disgust. There was no way he was agreeing to wear that. He was already in a well tailored black suit, elegant and far more subtle than anything else people at the Capital wore. Fashion these days was unapologetically ostentatious and while Tony liked wearing stupid shit as much as the next guy, this would be his first time on national television and he wanted to look dignified, and not like some punk kid. His only concession to fashion was his goatee, overly elaborate in the current style.
He tapped his head like he was telling Tony a clever little secret. Tony was mostly trying not to throw up or cry.
He grabbed his hand and dragged Tony towards the barn. He shoved the door open and Clint and Jan looked up guiltily from where they were playing pennies instead of working.
“There’s no way you’re going to be able to walk.” Steve said, rubbing his face. With one of them immobile, it was going to be difficult to get water or travel around to try to find the others. They would also be trapped if they were found by another tribute not on their alliance. Tony was dreading running into Raza again.
“No-”
“You’re not going to die. We’ve made it this far, right? The games never last longer than a week, we’re almost done. Then we can go home.”
“We were talking.”
Tony nodded.
“It is a simple fix. I will fly back to the rebel base, and will return with the Dragon Guard. We will fly you back, it will take less than a day to complete the trip.”
The peacekeeper assigned to Tony watched from the corner of the stage, but he didn’t interfere. Steve wobbled his way across the stage and half fell into the chair. Christine greeted him with a wide smile, like their last meeting had never happened.
Steve tossed the paper ball in the trash and they continued their shopping trip.
“Well you’ve done a great job of it!” Tony insisted. Bucky leaned forward with a friendly smile.
Tony laughed incredulously. “Under the beds! No! They’re all like four inches off the ground! How would I fit? And why in the world would I be under a bed?”
Tony rolled his eyes. “It was so boring, I spiced it up!”
“Roger that? What? No, that's a terrible plan!” yelled Tony. “You're going to walk up to the guy who's putting on his own little rendition of Hitchcock's ‘The Birds’ and ask him nicely to stand down and hold out his hands to be arrested? I thought you were supposed to be the man with a plan, Spangles.”
It wasn’t worth it,
“Alright, ‘night.”
Between his troubled thoughts and physical discomfort, he found himself unable to sleep. That's why when there was a small click at 2 in the morning, he immediately sat upright. He recognized that sound, that was the sound of the pilot light igniting from the flame throwers he had developed about a year back. He crawled out of his cave and looked around. A glint of metal in the moonlight caught his attention, and he stumbled over, his ankle stiff and swollen. The end of the barrel was level with the side of the tree. Tony felt around the bark until his fingers caught on a tiny edge. He dug his fingers in, and pulled the front of the tree open like it was a door. The tree was fake and hollow. Inside was the flamethrower, along with a pile of wires, one cluster stretching up the trunk. Looked like optic cables, so most likely there was a camera up there. Tony was much more concerned with the fact that there was a flamethrower pointed right at his cave. It was quick work to disable it, and Tony looked at the gas line running into the ground. How many of these things were there? Why were they here at all? Tony followed the direction of the gas line, to the next tree. After a few seconds of fumbling for the latch he was able to disable this one too. He did a third and a fourth, and was about to do a fifth when he heard the sounds of a fire. It was far off, but approaching fast. Tony gave up on trying to disable any more, hoping that what he had done would be enough to keep his little area safe, and that the fire wouldn’t spread too far. He went back to his cave by the river and blocked up the entry with branches and his blanket. In the distance he heard screaming.
Tony interrupted before he could get any more worked up. “I’ll give you a thousand bucks a day for the next week to show me the sights.”
“He was like my brother. He went missing days ago, and I knew the odds of his safe recovery were low long before I left. All the same, I could not abandon him. Loki used this against me, and set a trap. Now here I am, and Bucky is no more.”
“Or maybe the word is that the Rogers pack comes down here to sell their milk around this time, and you decided to pop down here and do it a bit of spying for Obie.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve let out a sad sound. “Oh, Tony.” He made sure Tony was looking into his eyes, so he could convey his complete sincerity. “You are your wolf and your wolf is you. There is nothing to be afraid of, nothing to try to hide away.”
“You say that every time, and the list keeps shrinking.” Tony said fondly and huffed out a breath. He kept his eyes facing forward and said, “I love you, how about that?”
That afternoon Clint and Natasha came back to the tower, with Natasha’s left arm bound up in a black splint. She stomped up to her room and paused as she saw a package in front of her door. It was a Tupperware full of fresh baked lemon poppy seed muffins. She took a bite and sighed in pure delight. They were perfect. She unfolded the note on top of the container.
“I must check in with the others on our plans.” He got up and went to speak with Rhodey.
“That’s not why you came. You came because you’re running away from something. Well guess what? Helping my pack won’t do anything.”
“I don’t want to be the one to stand in the way of your dreams. Do it.”
“I agreed to meet Christine tonight at 9 at a bar from the book.”
“Jesus, man.” Sam scrubbed a hand up and down his face. He stepped in front of Steve and put a hand on his chest before he could go back inside to get the last of the stuff.
They both shook their heads and Tony filed away their names. Tony dug through his backpack.“I have my blanket. Could I rip some off?”
“I don’t know what that means, but since it’s you I can just assume it was something mean.”
Last names. Another way to build distance.
He and Yinsen carefully pulled the landmine from the ground, then moved on to the next platform to start all over again. They spent the rest of the day that way, digging in the hot sun under Raza’s watchful eye.
“I’ll help you, I promise." Tony assured him. "We’ll save the ranch. But you need to work with me. We can do this. We will do this. Help me start.”
Steve snorted. “Yeah, most people don’t. It hasn’t gotten this cold here yet, I wonder if it’s going to snow. Maybe the crowds back home are bored and they need to make things more interesting…” Steve trailed off. “Did you ever watch the games?”
“Hello Indries. What are you doing in Evergreen?”
Bruce probed around his ankle and Tony shut his eyes and held in a pained whimper.
Tony let him go and stepped back, thinking. The dragon could help carry the sick and injured in their escape, and scout for anyone following them. It would be a valuable ally.
He looked at him in awe. “Amazing. I had no clue that any human being could be this dense. You’re wasted on this farm, you should be in a lab so scientists can study you.”
Vanko came down from above and cracked his whip, ordering them back to work. Tony chipped at the rock until they were done for the day, and were unchained from the line one by one, the cuffs tying their feet together staying on. They all trooped backup and outside, where the sun was setting on the horizon. They filed into the barracks, and Tony hurried to the Captain. To his relief he was still breathing, and a quick check of his bandages showed that no blood had leaked through, and Tony decided to leave them wrapped.
Maxwell came from behind and hit me with his bloody bat. Can you believe that? He can control thousands of invincible ghost ravens with a thought and he hits me with an aluminum baseball bat he probably stole from some kiddies softball match. Ridiculous.”
“Not the way you did it. And now you’re a war criminal.”
Stane's dark eyes flashed, though his voice remained level. “I've been running this pack for years, building us up to heights that Howard never could have dreamed of in his heyday. And Tony….” Stane paused. “Tony….” Stane paused again.  “Are you married?” Steve blinked at the abrupt change in subject.
Obadiah got up and walked around his desk to Tony. “And who told you that? The boy from 12? The one we both agreed yesterday was crazy?”
More than he could convey with words. How did he say that without him the world felt like a very cold and very cruel place? How did he say that when Steve died he had taken a piece of Tony with him?
“Was his dragon there? I heard those things are as smart as people and twice as mean.”
“Um. Thanks?” said Tony. He looked at Steve and he shrugged. He had no clue what was going on either. Jan served them up two plates of eggs, and they ate in silence. Tony’s fingers left black marks on the fork Steve noted, both impressed and a little disgusted. He guessed he was wrong about Tony being afraid to get his hands dirty. Didn’t matter though, since he was leaving today. He almost felt bad about it. He could admit that he had been in a bit of a mood yesterday, and eating together like this was...nice. He actually got along with Tony when they both kept their mouths shut. Clint came back into the kitchen. From his boots, Steve could tell that he hadn’t been in the fields. So where had he been for the past half hour?
“At least it’s not that new Star Wars film,” Tony snarked.
“We’re lucky to have even that.”
Cap sputtered and turned an intriguing shade of red. Tony should set up another stuck-in-a-cabin-all-nighter to solve more of those mysteries and maybe discover if that blush went all the way down.
“But we weren’t,” Steve said thoughtfully.
Hank gave him a sidelong glance. “I thought you’d resolved all that after the Purple Man incident.”
So she should have distrusted Steve from the get go. When he woke up from the ice nap on the table in the Avengers submarine.
MJ was a good friend, Peter thought once he was back at home. For some reason Tony had Rhodey, Carol and Nat over for dinner. Peter sat anxiously at the dining table listening to Carol talking about her latest test drive of a race car. He looked at the time on his phone. He should have heard from Mr. Rogers by now.
Peter knit his eyebrows and swore that his dad actually seemed worried about something. He strained to hear what they were saying.
“Oh.” Steve’s face fell. “I hope --”
“What about Brian?” Jan asked.
“I have a friend I can set him up with and it’ll be great. Hank likes Steve. I should have started with him.”
Tony half listened to Kamala telling him all about her theories. He watched the same short clip of Steve waving off Tarleton and heading to the reactor.
“Wolverine?”
Peter swallowed, gathering his courage. “Why did you say it that way?”
Tony smiled at his couldn’t-ask-for-a-better partner. “You bet. No business talk. We’re on a date.”
“We’ve been over this -- it’s Tony -- and I really want to call you something other than Cap or Captain America.”
“I’m not that bad,” Tony replied.
Tony nearly choked on his breath and fumbled his phone as he attempted to put it away. “Steve and I -- no, we’re not dating.”
“What happened?”
He knew that his dad was sadder than he’d been before. Tony was distracted and cranky at home, which he never was. He managed to avoid going anywhere near Peter’s school. And he didn’t invite any of his friends over either. Peter hadn’t ever gone more than a week not seeing Uncle Rhodey before. Tony also spent more time at work, telling Peter he’d be working at the lab.
Tony tapped at the phone. Then sighed heavily. “He’s coming over to get it. So Rhodey, you can finally meet Peter’s art teacher.”
Peter tapped his pen thoughtfully as he watched Mr. Rogers walk through the cafeteria. Maybe if Tony and Mr. Rogers met again, under the right circumstances, it just might work.
Not that his dad was really alone. They had a huge constellation of people in their lives, like Uncle Rhodey, Pepper, and Happy. And people like Nat, Tony’s physical therapist who joined them for dinner or game night, and who was more a friend these days. But they came and went, lived other places, had other stuff going on. And Tony didn’t -- he was left behind with Peter.
“You don’t have to go if you don’t want to. We like you -- you’re definitely a vast improvement over Brock.”
Steve smiled brightly, a smile just for Tony. “She said you would be there.”
A cloud passed over Maria’s face and she smiled tightly. “Soon. He is busy with his own arrangements for the wedding. He had hoped to attend, but as you know, private business does take time.”
Fury replied grimly, “I’ll handle that. This business is better handled undercover.” He turned to Steve and asked, “What is your name, anyway?”
“Tony?” Steve said in his lovely deep voice that always managed to stir
Tony thought he was well past the butterflies in the stomach phase. But there on his phone was a text from Steve about meeting up for dinner and Tony felt his stomach take a flip. Then he nearly floated to the bathroom to clean himself up to meet Steve.
Still got a panic attack at the idea of the date after living through this scene thirty times.
Tony would never ever admit that he might have also softened on Cap because he had a lot of very nice physical attributes. He might even, if he ever learned the man’s name, move on to significant attraction. He drifted off to sleep, wondering about Cap’s name, where in New York he came from, what drink he’d order at the bar.
All he could get were the elevators that didn’t go to the Avengers floor. He grabbed one in his haste to get to Steve. Then Tony ran up the stairs, jumping over steps two at a time. He’d be winded when he got to the gym floor. Nothing says I-love-you like standing in front of your would-be boyfriend wheezing until you’re red in the face and nearly passing out from lack of oxygen.
Tony freezes for a second, his eyes going wide. And then he smiles, full and dazzling. He kisses Steve clumsily, his mouth still pulled into an ecstatic grin.
Fill for Tony Stark Bingo 2020
"Oh fuck! Oh-oh yes, Steve, right there!" Tony growls, all alpha rumble.
“You think you saw me there? But that’s not possible. I was home the whole time. Or are you saying you think something screwy is going on, like alternate universe me or time travel or something?”
He loved all his Doms, and he knew they all loved him, but they each had things they were partial to, and Bucky and Steve loved to share him between them. Loved to fuck him until he was full, dripping with it, open and soft enough to slide in one after the other, taking turns to take him higher and higher in that perfect, floaty place while the other watched and waited, sliding in for their next turn as soon as the other slipped out.
As if reminding him of its existence, his cock twitches, heat rolling down his spine and into his groin. Just the sight of Tony's little dusky pink hole is enough to have him burning with want all over again.
“Where are you going?” Tony says again.
“Hello, gorgeous.” Bucky kisses him, smiling and relaxed. “Welcome back.”
He pets over it slowly, gently, rubbing and pressing lightly, knowing what he likes for himself, but trying to find out what Tony prefers. Even though he knows their biology is different, and much of the things he read said not to expect most alphas to open up as easily as an omega, Steve is still a little shocked by how firmly he has to push to slip his fingertips inside. When Tony groans and arches into it, it’s gratifying in a way Steve wasn’t prepared to feel.
Tony won't bend for anyone else, he won't break, won't waver or give in. Fury knows it's because Tony Stark has seen violence, has experienced it meted out unjustly more than anyone should have to endure. And he knows that all of Tony's Dominants have meted it out, sometimes justly, and sometimes not.
It's not violence when Natasha weaves ropes dyed specially to complement Tony's particular warm shade of skin, encasing him in gorgeous tapestries that do credit to her codename’s species. It's not violence when she leaves him helpless, except for the tiny bell clutched in his fingers he can ring at any moment to signal them if he needs to stop.
His stamina is amazing, and he keeps Tony right where he needs, making sure that this time, they will crest that peak together.
He pulled back, still smiling that soft smile as he says, “‘
Steve could kick himself. Instead he rallies.
"Thank you," he says out of nowhere. He's as serious as Steve has ever seen him. "Thank you for not treating me like there's something wrong with me."
And the fingers that are in Tony's ass, alongside Bucky’s cock are suddenly gone. “
Steve felt feverish, like pins and needles were crawling down his arms, into his fingers, and all he wanted to do was feel them slipping inside Tony, feel the way Tony’s body would have to be coaxed open for him. "Please, Tony...Want to open you up on my fingers."
“I can’t believe you thought I wouldn’t want this,” Steve pants out, finally picking up the pace when Tony starts rumbling low in his chest. “You’re beautiful like this, letting me have you. I wanna fuck you all the time, keep you right here in my bed, taking my cock like a good little alpha.”
Somehow, that bolstered Steve, set him with determination to show Tony how much Steve was going to make sure his alpha had no regrets, no reason to fear. Tony's trust gave him the confidence to kiss those shaking fingers, to pull his partner towards their bed.
He works his finger slowly, in and out, slippery and making tiny sounds he doubts Tony can even hear. But he can, and they get louder when he works Tony's hole a little faster, a little firmer, looking up to watch Tony’s face with rapt attention until he gasps and pleads, “Please, I want another. I’m ready.”
Not many can understand the Avenger’s bond, how so many Dominants can share one Submissive, how they all are intrinsically connected and yet their hub, their center and their humanity is tied irrevocably to one Tony Stark. He's their sun, the Submissive made just for them and they for him, all of them finding each other through extraordinary circumstances to circle in his orbit.
And all the while, Steve keeps on talking.
The enormity of it felt like it would swallow him for a moment, and all the nerves he had forgotten rushed back.
He works him for what feels like hours, pressing, rubbing, bathing in the scent of aroused alpha. Working his fingers in patterns and then randomly, until sweat shines on Tony's body and his thighs clench and quiver on each side of Steve. Those sounds come more and faster, and inside, Steve's omega basks in the pleasure his alpha is receiving from his attention.
“Yeah? One of the ones where you smile and shake hands and people open their wallets?”
It's not that Tony doesn't know how fast Steve is - he has to calculate that all the time on the field when he needs Steve to be somewhere or needs to know where Steve is going to be and when.
Tony would feel a great sense of accomplishment just for that, if he had two spare brain cells to run together.
His Alpha. All his. No one else was ever going to get a chance to have this from Tony again, because he was
Steve's hands framed his hips, the right tangling with Bucky’s left, the metal long since warmed to skin where the two held Tony's ass at a perfect angle. Bucky’s right hand was busy working in yet another finger alongside the others pressed inside Tony, pulling him wider and wider.
The Truth is, he completely forgets about it. It never crosses his mind again.
But someone - or more likely several someones - had made Tony think this thing he wanted was wrong or disgusting. And as much as Steve wishes that had never happened, right now he just needs to assure Tony that he thinks no such thing.
After firmly lodging his foot in his mouth on his first meeting with Tony, Steve gets another chance. And Natasha does not like it when people are mean to her friends...even if that other person is also her friend.
“Hey, sweetheart,” Steve whispered, pulling Tony closer to him so he could tilt Tony’s head back for a soft kiss. “You look gorgeous.” And he did, wearing a black robe Steve hadn’t seen before, satiny and soft beneath his fingers. The edges were trimmed in a delicate lace and Steve let his fingers slip over it, nudging it back so he could bare more skin to his touch.
"Can I?"
The door to the en suite opened and pulled him from his spiraling thoughts. The lights in the bedroom dimmed and for a moment the lights in the bathroom stayed on behind Tony, bathing him in an ethereal glow. Steve’s breath hung in his throat as he stood, walking over to take his alpha’s hand.
Tony wants to respond, he really does, maybe to beg for exactly what Steve is saying, or to ask if Steve has been replaced by an alien, but the only thing currently running through his brain is
It’s not violence when Rhodey fingers Tony open, making sure it burns just right to have Tony whimpering with delicious want. Not when he denies him, just to hear him try to beg around his mouthful of Bruce's cock as Rhodey lubes up soft thighs and slides between them, careful to only tease when his cock slides over the sensitive area of Tony's perineum until Rhodey comes.
Steve was going insane.  He couldn’t handle this much longer.  He couldn’t handle sitting there in his cell, knowing that Peter was out there being tortured and experimented on.  He had seen how bad Peter looked after the first experiments, he could only imagine how he’d look when Steve would see him next.
“Lookin’ good, bud.”  She gave him the smoothie, looking over his still healing wounds.  “Looking better, at least.”
Clint shrugged his arm off and pat his head.  "Sorry, Pete.  You're on your own.  Hey, Bruce!  Wake up, it's the lovebirds shift, apparently."
"So, Pops."  Peter already knew what was coming.  He slipped his web shooters onto his wrists, pocketed his suit, and braced himself for a lecture.
“Look, I just wanted to say that I’m… I’m sorry you had to see me like that.  I’m sorry that I treated you so harshly in there and, you know, kind of killed you for a while.  I just had to make sure they actually believed I was on their side and not helping you.”
"Are you two arguing already?"  Natasha sighed as they made their way back into the hallway.  "You can do this later.  Clint and Tony are practically right outside along with Fury and the authorities.  If you stop bickering and drawing attention to us, we can probably get out without Ross noticing.  Now shut up and let's get out of here."
"Ah, right.  Got it."  He and Clint made their way out.  "See you all in the morning.  Good luck, Pete."
Steve sat upright in bed, hand over his chest and his breaths deep and loud.  Tony, who was possibly the lightest sleeper in the world, immediately sat up after him, quick to comfort him.
Steve nodded.  "Yeah.  I just can't shake it, you know?"
It would be so easy to leave right now.  To just jump out of the window or into the elevator.  Those ideas were quickly shot down however when he realized how quickly the others would catch them.  No, he’d have to wait.
"Or, you can let my son and husband go and I don't have the god of thunder strike you down," Tony spat, standing behind Ross with Thor beside him.  "Choice is yours, Ross."  Ross froze before looking down and raising his arms in defeat.  "Good boy," Tony said as Shield agents rushed in and grabbed him by the arms.
"Fury's got him in DC and your dads are overseeing the building investigation as we speak."  Natasha sat down on the end of the bed, hands in her lap.  "What lies he's made up to try and get out of this are yet to be disclosed, but I'm sure we'll find out soon."
"I'll do my best."
"Sounds good to me."  All the exhaustion Peter had been feeling the past two days seemed to weigh down on him as his dads held his arms.  Not like the unnamed guards did, where they were dragging him and pulling him.  No, the way that his dads did this was supportive.  It was letting Peter know that he didn't have to be alone.  He didn't have to carry the weight of the world on his shoulders.  And for once, he let that weight he always carried drop.
He was obviously going to have to go.  He didn’t know what they were going to do with him, but he knew he couldn’t let anyone else suffer because yet another person was mad at the Avengers.  His only choice was going and doing what they wanted.  Maybe Ross was right.  Maybe he would be back by the end of the week.  Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad.
“Yeah, but you won’t, right?”
This wasn’t good.
And suddenly the video was no longer so innocent.  All eyes turned to the boy who stood frozen, staring at the video as it played on.
Steve looked up at Natasha and the grief that had fueled him seconds before turned to anger.  Her.  She was supposed to be a teammate.  A friend.  Now, she had helped the person who killed his son, his Peter.
“Darn it,” Tony muttered.  He shook his head and finally said, “Even so, we aren’t just going to let them take you, Pete.”
Now, all he could do was wait.
“In order for you to start to make up for your actions, I only ask for one thing.  I ask for you to send us your son, Peter.”
“Peter’s a teenager, Tones.  He should be smart enough to not sneak out.  He doesn’t need a babysitter.”
"Pops, are you okay?  Did I do something?"  Peter furrowed his brow.
Let it be known that Peter Rogers-Stark was not easily worn down.  So, this sudden feeling of exhaustion he had after only one day of experiments was not a good sign.
"Peter.  We told you that we'd deal with it.  We told you that you shouldn't go and that we would handle it together."
“Are you okay?  Can you stand?”
"By Jove, you've got me there, Unnamed Guard Number Two.  But what happens when they find out how you got the Avengers to comply?"
Tony didn’t tell Peter he was going on a date -- all he said was that he had a work function, he’d be out late, and to call Rhodey if he needed anything.
“Mr. Stark!” Rogers shouted as he pointed his flipper at the large stone building rising from the clearing in the center of the jungle.
“Bucky and I were caught in a trap, HYDRA shot me up with something and it’s possible --” Steve took a deep breath. “It’s possible whatever it was made me immortal.”
“I have some ideas about you and that conference table.” Tony slotted his knee between Steve’s legs.
“You know, he had to get his phone. Phones are important.”
“Tones, so are you, if you want the truth -- if that’s all Steve is, then you wouldn’t be thinking of him.”
Well, it was Wednesday. It wouldn’t be all that unusual for AIM to attack an Avenger during the work week and Steve was pretty high profile.
He wished again that he had been briefed more thoroughly before being packed into the carriage and sent towards Malibu. Steve knew however he wasn’t Alexander’s favorite guard after he led that effort to feed people from the grain supplies last winter against Alexander’s express orders.
“Scrubbers?”
“Natasha, stop that right now,” Jan demanded from the door of the workshop.
“Steve, Sir,” Steve replied. “I was one of Alexander’s guards.” Rhodey mouthed to Tony, ‘I told you.’
Tony and Jen watched in stunned silence as Brian followed by Peter and his band walked over to Loki. Song and a tiny drone flying by with a sign ensued. Charmed and thrilled Loki accepted immediately -- he'd been sort of low-key into Brian since he got to the Academy.
Mr. Rogers said nothing to anyone, especially Peter. He was still kind, patient and thoughtful in Peter’s art class. Though once Peter had caught a slight clenching of his jaw when Peter mentioned his dad.
“Your research is very interesting, Dr. Pym,” Steve said. “Ms. Raynor, I saw your wonderful performance in the Oklahoma revival.”
Peter considered for the millionth time that maybe he shouldn’t have told his friends about his secret plan to find a special someone for his dad. He was going to college next year, and he didn’t want to leave his dad all alone.
“Whenever I can see one -- it’s been a long time since I traveled outside Triskelion, but when I do -- I always try to catch one.” Which meant that Steve had in fact been to exactly one play in his entire life when he had accompanied Brock on a mission to Frisco. But he had loved it.
“I’ll take you through the library -- I’ve heard you’re a reader,” Tony promised.
Peter texted Natasha.
Ned at that point decided to pull Peter further away. “Mr. Rogers is looking around -- he might see us.”
“Indeed, it was, Ma’am,” Steve replied. Thank god they were serving finger foods, cookies and sweets because he was not ready to face the daunting prospect of a full-service royal dinner. The meal laid out in front of him was still the fanciest he’d ever eaten.
Tony’s subsequent sigh was deep enough to rival whale songs. With Greer egging her on, Ororo delicately ran her hand through Steve’s hair to apply blue chalk and glitter.
“Seven? In the lobby?”
Steve looked thoughtful. “I do spend most nights here already.” He poked Tony in a ticklish spot. “If I moved in officially, I’ll need some closet space, more than the two drawers I’m using –”
Tony nodded. “All me.”
“City Clerk’s Office.”
“Nice to have it to remember. We can plan that one on the way home.”
“Excuse me?” Steve said in his turn to panic.
Fury didn’t scare Steve after his morning with Obadiah. He noticed that Star was now perched at the end of his bed, listening intently to Fury.
“I can help with that,” Steve said, reaching for the cover. “What’s the problem?” He tugged the cover off the wall.
“Wouldn’t devil’s horns be better?” Tony asked.
Steve kissed him back. “Didn’t say that.”
engineer.
“Travel improves one,” Steve readily replied.
“Half the people here are wearing glow sticks, if you haven’t noticed.”
Star put her paw down on one drawing, the one in red and gold. “Those are Tony’s favorite colors, aren’t they?” Steve mused. “Good choice.”
Peter didn’t agree, seeing that his dad grumbled about meeting that Rogers person in a park on his day off. “You wouldn’t believe what that idiot thinks.”
About a half-hour later, Mr. Rogers showed up and Peter answered the door. He was in gym clothes -- a loose t-shirt with the Empire State University logo and athletic pants and a backpack -- and had clearly been working out. Peter was surprised -- he had never thought that Mr. Rogers had any other clothes than his collection of checked shirts and tan pants.
At this point, Tony had probably lived through a month of Thursdays. He’d lost count a few Thursdays ago. He had a lot of things to handle and, honestly, the best way to keep count would be a tally sheet so he wouldn’t be wasting the brain cells. But of course, notes always evaporated when the day started over again.
Thinking about it more, Mr. Steve was kind of perfect for Tony. They were a lot alike -- organized, intelligent, passionate, caring. Mr. Steve would look after his dad, and that’s what his dad needed. Someone to care for him, when Tony cared for everyone else.
Once Steve got off the elevator onto one of the business floors of the Tower, the blaring alarms assaulted his ears. How could anyone stay behind with all the noise? He found a woman at her desk, earphones on and desperately pecking away. “I have to get this spreadsheet done,” she protested.
“So what are you and Steve wearing?” Jan asked. She was sketching out another dress as they sat around a table in the Timeless Archives.
“Hello, I’m Lieutenant Sam -- I serve under Captain Rhodes of the Place guard -- I’ve been dispatched to escort you on a tour of the palace and grounds.”
“The artist has no evidence of other works in watercolors, and the artist himself says that he doesn’t work in watercolors and certainly did not paint that piece. Isn’t that enough to disprove attribution?”
Tony grabbed Steve’s arm. “He’s a better prince than the one Alexander promised.”
He decrypted the files stored on the stick and Kamala pointed out things in the video taken just before Steve was -- killed in the Chimera disaster.
“I couldn’t possibly love you more than I love you now.”
It wasn’t the same -- Steve sensed the weight of his missing years when Tony wore a t-shirt with an old meme on it and the rest of the team would laugh and Steve would play along. People expected people in their 20s and 30s to know things, understand what they were talking about, to have common cultural knowledge.
“Oh.” Tony settled against Steve’s side, head resting on Steve’s shoulder. “We’ll just build a second floor on the shop.”
Tony rustled up two tin cups from the cabinets while Cap got the fire going. “It’s looking good -- can’t see my breath any more,” he said as Cap handed him a cup full of melted snow.
Steve rubbed his eyes and mournfully looked at his empty place and glass. He’d have to get up and go to the kitchen for food. He weighed the benefits of sitting yet remaining hungry versus getting up but leaving his comfy seat.
Steve hovered on the edge of the lab, not quite looking at Tony. “I was wondering --”
“Debrief,” Tony replied with a smile.
“I was ambushed.”
Mr. Steve was nowhere to be found and it was a huge park filled with people in the late October weather. Peter and Ned went through the motions of asking a family about their dogs when Mr. Steve and a tall man arrived with a golden lab. Mr. Steve was in his jeans and a long-sleeve shirt. He was laughing and tossing and catching a frisbee in one hand.
“SHIELD physical and test.”
After dinner, Steve sat on his balcony with Tony. “You look worried,” Tony said. “Is it about Mom’s proclamation naming you a hero of the state?”
Steve grumbled as he tugged and pulled his uniform back into place. Tony straightened his clothes and combed his hair back into place. Back to business Tony.
“We’ll find out soon enough,” Rhodey said. “Hey, have you eaten at all today, Pete?”
“Natasha?”
“Getting coffee. He thought you’d be back soon.”
these days. “That includes Bruce.”
Actually Steve was pretty good at dancing. “I took a couple of lessons,” he confessed to Tony. “I didn’t want to --”
He knew the signs now. Tony would be sitting at the datacrux, sipping coffee or reading Sam’s report, and Steve, uncharacteristically nervous, would sidle up to the desk. This was a man who punched out dinosaurs without giving it a single thought. But big, beefy, and devastatingly handsome Steve would stand there, hemming and hawing until Tony said, “Steve, out with it. Are we being attacked by the Impossible Man again?”
“Huh,” Peter said. “I don’t know what to do. Natasha’s run out of ideas. Our one idea was having them run into each other. But nothing came out of that.”
“It went viral,” Jan concluded.
Tony had no answer. He couldn’t think of one, and he’d gone to his share of the events. Sue and Reed couldn’t even have a baby shower without a supervillain attack.
At that, Tony turned and appeared to look at Steve for the first time. “We honor all who create in this court and land. Do you like art?”
“Ah, they’ll try anything.” Tony paused momentarily. He leaned towards Steve. “Sweetheart, it will be fine. You could be immortal, you might not be immortal. Whatever it, we’ll cross that bridge when we get to it.”
They had just about given up. They had tried a coffee shop meeting, the school dance, an Academic Decathlon carpool.
“Right. That’s due tomorrow, right,” Ned replied, sounding slightly defeated.
“They’re going in the limo with us,” Jan interjected.
Tony sighed deeply. “Captain America has an eidetic memory. He’s isn’t likely to forget --”
He cleared one floor, then the next, all the while seeing little puffs of colored gas coming through the HVAC. On the third floor, he found Tony trying to pry off a vent cover in a corridor.
“Ah, indeed. Obadiah will have made arrangements.” Steve wished he had met Queen Maria under different circumstances, she was the epitome of grace and excellent manners and he liked her tremendously.
They checked the next three rooms. No one was visible.
~~~~~
“Hey, sorry I’m late,” Tony said.
“Well, that Rogers was all sorts of cute and buff,” Carol said. Rhodey shot her a look. “Well, he was.”
“Nonsense,” Maria said. “We’ve all become much too fond of you to let you go, and I dare say you wouldn’t want to disappoint Tony. We’ll revisit the wedding when Howard is better. The appearance of the political match is necessary -- and we’ll have something to hold against Alexander when we need it.”
General Phillips was going to kill Tony if he lost the Army’s great hope, Captain America.
Tony pulled away to stare at Steve. “Wait. Slow down. You just talked me in letting you move in –”
He bent down to talk directly to Steve. “Hey -- I need to talk to you about business. Outside.”
Then Alexander showed him the dank prison cells in the depths of the dungeons ready for his mother and Bucky if he refused or ran away. So, grudgingly, Steve was measured for royal clothes, given lessons on manners, and sent away to Malibu with his instructions to marry the Malibu heir.
“The team will love the more comfortable seats and bigger galley,” Tony grumbled. “So, the whole team thinks that you and I are getting married.”
“I’m going to help you.”
“We’d heard after the betrothal that Brock of Triskelion was ignorant, a bully, poor at diplomacy and everything that this kingdom does not stand for. And yet, you are different.”
Steve had not been given any attendants. Alexander cared even less about the difficulties he’d placed Steve in than he did about the Kingdom of Malibu. He then told another of a series of lies, dying inside as he spoke. “My attendants are delayed. Their carriage had a broken axle, but I did not wish to delay my arrival to wait for the repair.”
“Oh?”
with his ...
Steve put the book away and looked thoughtfully at his now empty coffee mug. He wanted more but that would mean getting up and going to the kitchen. He’d see that it’d been barely thirty minutes since he sat down to wait for Tony. Who didn’t know that Steve was waiting for him.
She lowered them to the ground. Turns out Steve had taken more damage that it first appeared. The armor made a poor cushion for Steve’s head as she cradled him, waiting for the ambulance. Blood stained his uniform on his left hip and stomach and Steve’s face was paler than usual.
Tony looked gorgeous in suits, especially the ones that emphasized his shoulders with the tailored pants that hugged his ass in a way that made Steve have thoughts that would land him in hot water with his friend. He really shouldn’t be thinking about whether he could bounce a quarter off Tony’s ass. Tony’s was perfect and tight and bouncy, and a quarter bounced off that wonderful ass would go into the stratosphere.
and never got the hint that Steve and Tony had plans. Alone together plans without Clint.
“Something red, white, blue?” Loki teased.
Drawing comfort from Tony’s warmth, Steve only nodded. He clung to Tony, feeling him as the anchor tying him to the here and now.
Peter had to study for his upcoming AP exams. He knew his dad had come back from the date because of the noise from the living room. He didn’t notice the time because he was thick into reading calculus formulas.
“Um, Steve, there’s a mission –”
“Um, not that often, just during times of distress.” Tony pulled out one of Steve’s chairs and sat down. “Or when I get excited or curious.” He sighed. “Just about whenever, I guess. These past weeks have been a bit exceptional. Probably the wedding. Probably trying to figure out if we’re going through with the wedding.”
“Okay, this is what we’re going to do. I could use a shower and you could too, so shower in our room, dinner and chocolate cake in bed -- we’ll watch something ridiculously silly --”
“What did they say?” Carol asked him for the fifth time after he got to Rhodey’s.
~~~~~
Tony had already waited thirty-one days to go on a date with Steve. Maybe more, he knew he missed a handful of Thursdays in his count.
“Ms. Patel said we needed an adult with us when we did the survey.”
Steve sighed. Logan had his own logic.
He desperately did want a date with Steve, a real date, not a let’s-complain-about-the-Mets friend’s night out at a sports bar. They always spent a ton of time together and Tony wouldn’t trade a minute of that time away. But a real date. Just them alone and on the same page about maybe being more than friends and co-leaders.
She had to flee to the safety of the workshop.
“He said something about making a cup holder for saddles.”
“Yep.”
He sat sobbing at his desk until his head ached and he ran out of tears and the handful of tissues were useless wads on the floor.
Peter glanced over at his dad, who had clearly noticed Mr. Steve and was trying to ignore the man. Mr. Steve hadn’t noticed Tony as he and his friend tossed the frisbee to the dog not far from Tony’s bench. Peter nodded to Ned and they moved a bit further away out of direct sight of Tony.
He closed the box and put it away in the hardest-to-reach compartment in the room. The best he could do to remove temptation. When he had time, he’d send the box back to the vault.
“Come on! It’s not far!” Tony shouted.
Tony squeezed Steve’s bicep. “Keep it. We can put it to good use after dinner.”
“Excuse me,” Steve said, keenly aware he was apologizing to a cat.
“I would love to see it,” Steve said.
~~~~~
He clapped a large warm hand on Peter’s shoulder. “It’s okay, Peter. Steve and I worked it out.”
“Right. Not at all comfortable.”
Honestly, it was probably one of Tony’s most precious belongings. Steve had drawn the room they had shared at the resort, the one in which Tony had suggested that they move in together. Just looking at Steve’s work, Tony felt the warmth and intimacy of their vacation, the place where they had just been with each other for a few days. He began to resent sharing this drawing with the evaluator, but the independent art expert said that they needed as many pieces by Steve as they could locate.
“Brian is going to be stunning -- we’ll be best dressed dancers there.” Loki turned to Tony, “Car or motorcycle? Matching helmets?”
In the morning the cat returned, and Steve tried to lure the cat off the balcony by offering bits of his breakfast. Either the cat didn’t trust Steve or didn’t like the sausage. It was possible it was both. Steve liked cats and had hopes of making friends eventually.
Said Pete was still shaking a bit from the adrenaline coursing through his body from submitting his early action application. He leaned back in his chair and yelled back, “Food!”
“I mean -- if the cat thing bothers you, I can give you money and transportation to wherever you want to go.”
Tony shot her a look as she excitedly got up.
“People aren’t supposed to know -- and really I shouldn’t have let myself get so close to you. All the stories about how awful I am were meant to keep you away,” Tony explained frantically.
“I’m not seeing any signs.” Steve looked over the compact cubicles in front of him.
“Come in,” he said, not even attempting his princely voice. He swung his legs off the bed and onto the floor, causing Star to protest the changes in arrangements.
Frowning, Steve looked back at the restaurant. “But Jan, Hank, our dates --”
The panic would have eaten through his brain and he would have found a reason to run away from this -- Steve’s great laugh, his ridiculous motorcycle story, that really nice feel of Steve’s hand in his.
Tony should be over the moon, now that he was having study dates and holding hands with Steve.
“And?”
Tony stood and quickly walked out to meet Stark Industries security and assess the situation.
The shot of air from Steve leaning back into the chair blew some of the printouts off the table and Steve had to get up and retrieve them. No one except for Tony should see them. He could have emailed the pile to Tony; Tony would have preferred that. But Steve needed the tangibility offered by paper, to see Tony’s face as he read the information.
“Want to dance?” Steve asked and Tony nearly dropped his jaw. Steve had taken off his jacket and bowtie, leaving the collar open. His hair was mussed up, in just the right way.
Now that he wasn’t on call, Tony snuggled deeper into the sheets and blankets and blatantly ogled the lovely ass right in front of him.
After a private dinner with Maria, Steve returned to his room to find the tiny black cat curled up on his bed. “You would not believe how nice today was, Star,” Steve said.
A couple of weeks later, the team and his teammates’ families went to Antonio’s to celebrate their big Academic Decathlon win over Roosevelt. Peter was trapped in the middle of the table, far away from MJ and Ned and the breadsticks. In the middle of negotiating for a basket, he looked over at Mr. Steve. Who was laughing alone with the rest of them, but still didn’t seem like the Mr. Steve from February, when he was laughing with Tony at the gallery.
There the box sat on his desk in his room on the Chimera. He’d ignored it for a couple of days, preferring at first the safety and comfort of reading Pepper’s and Rhodey’s encrypted messages. They were doing okay, nervous about the world, scared for him.
