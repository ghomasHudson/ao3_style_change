“I’m not saying to remove all elements of the past. Especially, not you,” said Tony.
He couldn’t stop himself from whining. His alpha should be with him. “Is there any way you can cancel?”
“It’s an honor to meet you,” said Steve.
The omega stood motionless. Distress leaked off him. His eyes were distant.
“His son, Tony Stark. A royal pain in my ass,” said Fury.
"Steve, we have to go," she said, gently pulling him toward her car.
I’m not sure if the Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center was the hospital that Happy went to, but it was the closest one the Chinese Theater where he was injured. It is an actual hospital.
"Then why!"
He was missing something.
From a drawer, she pulled a razor.
She sat up turning on the sound amplifier so she could hear the other side of the conversation.
"That's great," said Barny.
“Omega."
They made it to the tower, entering through the back entrance.  A swarm of people was gathered at the front of the tower. Bruce sat up from the back seat.
“And if by some chance that happens what will be the effect?” asked Steve.
Tony’s hands fisted. He swallowed back his rage, remind himself that Steve was only saying this because he was afraid and feeling guilty about having desire.
His voice was raspy and hoarse.
"Alright, I'll tell them," said Happy.
“That’s the best I can give you until the director says otherwise,” said Phil.
Steve watched as the alpha processed the new information. He wasn’t sure which emotion Tony was trying to control. Tony left their bed and started pacing.
The folder was filled with wedding clippings.
"La."
“Captain Rogers-
“A child, Pepper. I barely managed to catch him after he fell out of the jet,” she said, her voice cracking.
Tony's walls came crumbling down. Steve was hit by the anxiety, stress, worry, and fear his mate had been bottling up. They sunk to the floor. Steve was still as Tony as scented him. He ran his hands over the tense muscles of his alpha. He pushed his positive emotions through their bond, hoping to offset what Tony was feeling. Tony relaxed against him.
But a mental tripwire had been already been ignited, setting off a chain reaction. Piper screamed at the top of her lungs, and tackled the beta to ground.
“Please, I need to get to them,” she whimpered. Her lip quivered. Piper couldn't imagine what they were going through, especially Papa.
“Steve?”
“Be careful, Tony, they could still be there,” cautioned Steve.
“You are so beautiful,” he said.
“Move, or I will move you,” said Steve.
"With what?"
“Sir.”
Steve’s eyes watered. “Yes.”
Nothing he'd done to her was meant to intentionally harm her. Winter only worked toward her betterment. If it could be considered that. He was teaching her how to fend for herself. She wouldn’t have survived this long otherwise.
Freezing when the alpha scented his neck. Steve turned facing the alpha and snarling.
“Mr. Stark, it’s 1:30 in the morning, so I assume this is an emergency."
"Ironman?"
Maya went back into the living room. She had to try and get through to Steve.
“How do I? Or do you want to do it yourself?” he asked.
*****
His head was forced down as he was battered.
“Not everything has changed,” said Steve.
“Natasha and the others are they alright?” he asked.
“Go back to the lab where you belong or better under alpha,” said the alpha.
It was shocking how strong Tony had been through all this. He had worried Tony would fall off the cliff of addiction. And no one would blame him for doing so. He was a hero made helpless.
Dr. Star moved her hand away. It hadn’t bothered Piper, she just wanted to prove to Rune that it was safe.
“I’ll need to check up on you in about three weeks. I need to collect some samples,” she said.
Steve was almost impressed. He didn’t think his encouragement would work so well, but he couldn’t take all the credit. Part of it was Tony’s natural curiosity. Steve shook the thought from his head. He needed to focus.
Piper smiled her agreement.
She ran her hands along the metal panels. He seemed more at ease with her touching his prosthesis than actually touching him. There were chips and scratches marking the metal. She held his arm in hers, getting a weight of it. It felt about twelve pounds.
Steve paused when he heard a soft purring. Piper was huddled to his side, sucking her thumb, though the action muffled the sounds. It was a new habit. Even when she was a baby, she never showed much interest in pacifiers.
“Where’s Steve?” asked Bruce.
“Compared to his father, it's tame,” said Steve.
"Where is she?" he asked.
He kissed Tony goodbye. He met with Barny on one of the tower’s empty floors. Steve liked the emptiness of the room. He didn’t feel contained here. At the center of the room were a couch, armchair, and coffee table. Barny was already there with a box of donuts.
He tossed her the wooden rod. “Ready?”
“Tell me,” said Loki. He took a seat. Loki heard her story from Clint, but it was far more interesting to hear it be told in person.
She wiped her ink-covered hand on her shirt, trying not to get any on the steps. Piper crumbled up the pieces of the pen in some paper. She’d throw it away later.
“I declare you married. You may kiss.”
Loki laughed. These humans weren’t much, but they were amusing.
*****
“Since you’re staying up why don’t you put in the car seat.”
"Is that all?" asked Steve.
“What happened?”
He reached up and kissed his mate. His stomach growled. He hardly got taste any of the wonderful he and Tony had selected.
*****
“That's big for me."
He shook his head, trying to refocus on his attention on breakfast. When done cooking he placed the plates in the dishwasher. It made cleaning up so much easier. Steve filled his plate and was about to relax when Tony’s phone rang.
"I thought he worked for Tony."
Piper shook her head.
A crash forced Tony from his sleep. He crept into the kitchen. Steve’s posture was low and threatening, prepared to attack at a moment’s notice. His shield was at the ready. Tony wished he knew what the omega saw instead of the safety of their home. First priority was securing Piper. He didn't want her anywhere near this. Tony didn't believe Steve would hurt Piper even like this, but he couldn't take that risk. He retreated to the bedroom. Mark 5 slid out from underneath the bed. It unfolded. He wrapped Piper in a blanket. From the bedroom, he heard the destruction caused by his distraught omega. He silenced Piper with a pacifier. Tony placed her in the suit. Buckles wrapped around her, keeping her supported as the suit stood. It enclosed around her.
“Could be worse,” said Jeff.
“Custom made terror threat.”
From her bag Natasha pulled two clear mesh bandages, setting them on the coffee table.
Steve managed to turn on his side. Tony barely missed his reach. He whimpered. His body was slow with sleep. “Tony.”
“You’re not bad, Winter.”
“How long is the flight?”
“Leave it here for next time you come over. I had Happy pick up some clothes for you that should fit you. They're in the top drawer first to the right,” he said. Tony followed the omega to the closet. Steve smiled brightly looking over the drawer. The gesture was more of a convenience than anything else. It meant a great deal to Steve though. That warm smile appeared. He loved that smile.
“Tony.”
Winter was forced to return from the nothingness at the pup's mention, but he didn't react. He was meant to listen unless told otherwise. And he knew he hadn't failed Piper. He'd done all he could for her.
? A child was meant to bring a couple closer together. If he were placed in the position where he had to choose between Tony and their child. He'd choose thier child every time without hesitation. Would Tony accept their baby? Would he love it? Nat squeezed his hand, refocusing his attention.
“You’ll have to go to the lab for me to perform a body scan,” said Jarvis.
They got out of the car.
“Are we do for today?” he asked.
Strangers surrounded him on either side. The searing pain in his lower abdomen urged him to run, from this unknown setting. His fist slammed against the glass, causing it to shatter. He broke free, shoving past those who blocked the exit. Every movement hurt but the urge to find safety fueled him through it.
“I should have done that sooner,” he said.
It didn't take long to get to the airport. They got onto the plane. It was about a two-hour flight. Flying always made Steve tired, his eyes were growing heavy.
When Piper awoke hours later, Theodore was statue still. She stretched out, yawning. Breakfast sat untouched.
Tony hated how he stared at Steve.
“Oh, I don’t doubt it,” she said.
"I'll be better next time."
“We’ve already set up your tents. The scientists haven't found anything dangerous,” said Fleur.
“They were too similar. It caused such tension between the two of them,” she said
April 13, 2013
“Yes.”
“I want to do more.”
“You’re letting me go to school?”
Winter sat quietly in the corner. Watching the pup walk back and forth was agitating. Stacked next to him were two German books. He already knew German, so they must be the girl's.
Steve nodded. They sped out the driveway, the gate closed behind them. Steve watched the surroundings pass by. He yawned. Tony turned down the music. When they got home he woke Steve up. The omega shot of the car speeding in the direction of the nearest bathroom.
Steve nodded. They started with a simple conversation. It took an hour or so for him to feel comfortable. His guard lowered slightly. Barny’s voice was very soothing.
Natasha taught Piper the basics and was astonished by how quickly she caught on.
"Pepper, I'm here because I have to be. Attention is the last thing I want."
“I’m your superior,” said Fury.
"Sure, you aren't. How about breakfast? I hid away a box of Captain Crunch from Papa." Offering a super-soldier toddler a sugar rush at four in the morning wasn't the best idea. Still, it was the fastest way to gain ground; to figure out precisely how she was processing things.
"Alzheimer's. It's progressing slowly. She forgets little things. It will only get worse as she gets older," said Tony.
Natasha strode toward him, the only S.H.I.E.L.D. operative brave enough to approach.
Steve bent to Tony's level, whimpering as he met the alpha's glare. He bowed his head unable to tolerate Tony’s harsh gaze. Instinct urged him into a submissive nature. He closed his eyes, focusing on Tony's heartbeat. Slowly it began to calm. The alpha’s panic eased.
"What if she missed something?" he said.
"Still have to look through them. Howard wrote in code, so it may take some time," said Tony.
“That’s me.”
“It’s nothing.” His aching side and bleeding leg were nothing compared to what he felt in his heart.
“Probably,” he said.
She smiled.
“A few, but nothing for you to worry about. Relationships aren't easy."
"No one was harmed."
“I just want to say I’m sorry about your loss. I want to know what you think happened,” said Tony.
“Cap, you think you open it?” asked Clint.
"If you even try to break the glass. Your friend Pepper will suffer the same fate. I'm sure she won't be able to handle half as well as you," he said.
The first alpha photo to appear was James Rupert Rhodes.
Edith moved a sheet of Steve’s legs. She pulled down the omega’s shorts. Then spread his legs checking how dilated he was.
"When you say your Aunt Nat, you're referring to the Black Widow, correct?" he asked.
He was alone. Something he hadn't felt for some time. He touched the claim marking his neck. Steve, the man was probably furious and worried sick about him right now. Staying here wasn't an option. He got to his feet and found some old chain and looped it around his suit. Then began trudging through the snow. Only five miles. An old gas station came into view. He dropped the chains and went to a wooden Indian wearing a poncho, taking off and putting it on. He went to the phone booth. Did he even have change? He panted down his pockets and finding a dollar in quarters. Tony dialed in the number for his secure server.
“This is Sir Rhodes, my first knight,” the prince said as he glared at the mirthful man, who was struggling to stifle his laughter as he took a bow. “And this is Peter, my cousin, and my page. For now.”
During the board meeting, Tony announced his decision to shut down the weapons manufacturing department, which was met with a fair bit of resistance. Swords were crossed and guns were drawn. And Obie blew Steve’s fuse when he put his arm around Tony’s shoulder and tried to alpha-splain why this wasn’t a good decision. So, Steve pulled him off and slammed him into a wall, before calmly remarking that his lack of faith was disturbing.
Steve’s warriors kept their positions, and watched curiously as the dauntless enemy charged at the shield which had now widened across the whole field, which forced those before them through the barrier, thereby tearing them into half.
Where did he get the right?! Tony had issues he wasn’t blind. He was aware the honeymoon state wouldn’t last forever. Steve wasn’t so naïve to think otherwise. Tony wasn’t abusive or cruel he treated him with respect. Barny didn’t have the right to judge his relationship!
"Easier this way," said Steve, shrugging.
“I’m fine what about you?” The kid had regained his courage and had wandered closure.
Winter immediately sheathed it. He was unused to a fearful reaction in the dojo. This was normally an environment where she felt safe. He knew his pupil's many pained sounds due to the brutality of her training, but nothing that sounded anything like fear.
“Then why are you a hypocrite now?”
"A doctor's order to have sex with my husband. Under normal circumstances, I'd be happy to comply. But not now."
"This won't take long," said Edith.
It was the youngest of the nurses. He scowled at her. She mid-length curly auburn hair and gray eyes. Nothing about her was threatening. That wasn't reason enough to trust her.
"Stay the night. I'll call you a cab in the morning. You can even have my room there's a lock on the door if that makes you feel more comfortable," said Matt.
Here's a bonus Thanksgiving chapter. There will still be one out Friday.
"And you want to hurt him?" She picked up on the uncomfortable surprise in her parents' expressions. "Oh, you want to kill him."
Winter studied the pup sleeping across him. How could she sleep peacefully knowing he was there? He closed his eyes quickly when the pup started waking.
“Not many can make me come like a virgin,” said Tony.
*****
chree
“Mmm, I love that sound."
He remembered unmated omegas being dragged from his apartment building on doctor's orders. His landlord couldn't buffer out the scratches left on the floor from when they were torn out of their home. The only saving him from the same fate was Bucky claiming to be his alpha on paper.
“Is your mind where it needs to be?” asked Banner.
January 20, 2016
“What if it happens again?” There wasn’t an
Tony smiled when Steve's posture relaxed. He started purring and nuzzling Piper. She gleefully giggled nuzzling against Steve. The omega got into the nesting couch. Tony tried returning his work to give the two some personal time, but he couldn't resist checking on them.
“The technology used to do this is foreign to us,” he said.
“Hang on,” he said.
“Let me explain!” cried Steve.
"I'll have to perform a physical on both of you and gather several samples," said Bruce.
“My sweet Emma,” she said.
“What do you need my help with?” asked Steve.
Tony's heart warmed. "Thanks, little guy. You will come to find that most alphas are."
"Why?"
“Get him."
Tony woke an hour later. Steve’s arms were firmly wrapped around his waist. He tried breaking free, but Steve's hold only tightened. There was no escaping. If he tried again, he risked waking the omega. That was a danger in itself. A screen appeared in front of him, and he started working on another suit design.
“We’ve got to make a decision we can either save the president or Steve and Pepper. We can’t do both,” said Rhodes.
Rumlow charged into the cell, tackling Winter. Winter fought against him, but his movements were sluggish. Rumlow caught the soldier in a sleeper hold. The alpha dropped back, using his weight to throw Rumlow off balance. He clawed at Rumlow's arms.
“What was your friend’s name?”
“He needs space.”
Steve reached out for his hand.
“You look miserable."
“I’m so sorry, Steve."
“Thanks for going with me,” he said.
There was so much more behind that single word. Steve knew what he wanted but didn't have the strength to ask. This level of vulnerability was so much greater than anything he had dealt with before with him.
Tony hadn’t told Steve the full extent of the damage of to his heart. The alpha never told him anything about his doctor appointments.
“Yes, I want it. But I want to be me when I accept. I don’t want to be this identity made for me,” said Steve.
"For making my heat something I can enjoy. I didn't know that was possible," said Steve.
“I am. Directly and indirectly.”
“Empty, sir."
"We're sleeping in the guest bedroom until the baby comes."
He froze when he saw Piper. Tony barely managed to pause the feed.
"What channel?" he asked.
“That’s nice, but I don’t see what you could do.”
"Getting closer. Only a few boxes left."
“What?” said Steve.
“I know, Steve.”
“Yeah"
“The name of the man who took, Piper,” she said.
Piper looked around the room. Its uniformity bothered her. The room was so unlike the limited surroundings she’d seen.
Tony laughed, simply shrugging it off. It was a mocking sound, an insulting echo to what Rhodes was used to hearing to from his best friend.
“It’s hard to explain, but one day when you're older you'll understand," said Helmut.
"I'm disappointed in your choice, but I understand it. In time, you'll change your mind."
“I’m sure he has a doctorate in something,” said Fury.
“Strategic Homeland Intervention Enforcement Logistics Division. An organization founded by Peggy Carter, Chester Philips, and Howard Stark. Created to protect the world,” said Fury.
“No, Jarvis. What happened before I fell asleep?” asked Piper.
“Okay, sweetie. Bath time and I'll have Jarvis order your favorite junk food. And then we'll watch your favorite movies. How does that sound?"
“It’s obvious you are unwell,” pressed Jarvis.
"She sewed shirtwaists in a factory," she said.
She printed the picture of the ultrasound for them. Steve sat up, wiping the gel from his stomach.
"Only until things have settled down."
“There won’t be others?” asked Steve, possessively clutching the alpha’s hand to his chest. He wasn't going to share.
“We’ll play something different,” she said.
“Stay with me,” said Natasha, snapping her fingers.
“What’s wrong?” she asked.
“You won’t.”
Tony buckled Piper into her car seat, quietly shutting the door behind him. Piper slept through the noise of New York. When they got to the tower he carried her out of the car. As he entered Piper’s room Jarvis lowered the shades. Tony put Piper to bed, taking off her jacket and shoes.
"It's only a scratch."
"I have a right to know how you're feeling about this," he said.
“He probably will,” he said.
He shook his head.
"He's strung up over an oiler tanker. They're going to light him up," said Rhodes.
“Aunt Nat!”
"Have you ever had a chick straddling and you look up and she's suddenly glowing from the inside out? Kinda a bright orange.”
"Dum-E will have something new to learn."
“What is it, Rune?” asked Steve. He may have a better chance of regaining her trust by going through Rune.
“She was whenever I had a bad day she made my favorite food no matter how tired she was. An amazing woman. What about your mom?” he asked.
“Alpha.”
Steve nodded breakfast could wait until Tony woke up. He took a glazed donut from the box. Steve took a seat next to Rhodes.
“Sure, we can.”
"I will be honest with you. Since one else is," she said. Honesty was something she couldn’t usually afford in her profession.
“Piper-”
“This is beyond you metal man. Loki will face Asgardian justice,” said Thor.
“What?”
“If I say anymore, it will go to your head,” said Steve.
“You need to shower.”
“You want me to command you?”
Steve got to his feet. Tony stood beside him. He braced against the alpha.
“I don’t know,” said Steve. He hadn't paid attention. His sole focus had been making his nest. Instinct had him focusing on the sole task of building the best nest possible for after the birth.
“I love you,”
“Tony?” Steve grabbed the alpha’s arm.
“That theater is a popular location. I don’t know why Happy was there, but it could have been a coincidence that he was caught in the crossfire,” he said.
"I don't think either of us thought we'd be reaching this point so soon," said Steve.
He took Tony’s phone.
“Hi, Piper,”
“How much longer until she's here?” she asked.
“No, it isn’t so difficult,” said Steve.
"Understood, I'll be at Stark Tower tomorrow," she said.
Rhodes froze. The president was in his suit strung up by his arm. “Oh, my god.”
He nodded. The pup needed a reminder of them. Maybe it would help with the defeat in her gaze. There was such a swift turn of emotion brought on by something as simple as an airplane.
“Alpha!”
“No, Sir.”
“You are too good for me,” said Steve.
He massaged Steve’s broad shoulders, earning purrs. His hands traveled lower, working Steve’s back. Tony slathered a washcloth with lavender-scented to soap, which complimented Steve’s natural scent. He washed away the splotches from that soft pale skin.
“What does that mean?” asked Steve.
“Where is he?” asked Tony.
“Piper, we’ve got you.”
“You should have left your armor on for that,” said Loki gesturing with his scepter.
He went surging toward the surface, shooting into the sky. A sight that escaped his mate.
“From work,” said Bruce.
“Ms. Potts wanted me to remind you that public awareness is key,” said Jarvis.
“It isn’t that simple,” said Tony.
“Jarvis, where’s my flight power!”
He snorted slightly.
"We'll be in time for the changing of the guard," said Tony. Steve took his hand, leading them to the tomb of the unknown soldier. The omega's posture changed as the ceremony began. He straightened, a form crafted from a military career. Steve saluted at the proper times.
"No, Sir," he corrected.
“I bet the fanboy loved that," said Tony.
He did as told. Steve despised being spread out like some exhibit in front of near strangers gawking between his legs. He whined as Edith pushed a finger into him.
She opened her eyes, not knowing when she’d closed them. They were in a car garage. Papa opened the door to a black SUV and strapped her into the car seat.
He set her down close to her parents. “Stay.”
“Who did he choose?” he asked.
“Impressive.”
Steve woke late the next morning, groaning at the feel of the dirty crumpled bedsheets against his skin. He got up not being able to take the feel against his skin. Steve stripped the bed, blushing when the dildo fell to the floor. He quickly shoved it in the drawer. Steve shoved the dirty bedding into the hamper. From the closet, he heard the shower running. He tossed off his clothes and got in.
Piper brought her limbs close trying to warm herself up. Her eyes widened when a blue glow traveled under her skin. Was she hallucinating? As the blue glow spread through her the cold vanished. She kept curled in a small ball, not wanting to reveal to her captors the change that occurred.
Tony smiled. The kid was smarter than he looked. No one wonder Piper had taken a liking to him.
"That does nothing for my general stress levels," said Happy.
“Tomorrow?” asked Steve.
"If I go into labor I'll call you. Go check on your friend. Take your suit with you."
"Anything in particular?"
“Captain Rogers, wait!”
“There are a lot of people who will want to see you, Piper. We thought that would be a bit overwhelming, so Daddy got things here ready for when you came back,” said Papa.
Why had Steve forgiven him? The question kept on running through his mind, but he couldn’t come up with an answer. There was no logical one he could come up with. If he didn't find an answer it would keep him up for days.
"It's terrible what happened to her, but this is risky, even for you. She's not yours," he said.
"I believe it was excess power. Her small form was incapable of containing it."
“They needed the push,” said Fury.
“Nope.”
It took hours for Theodore to relax, uncoiling from his tense stance. He seemed so much more broken now. She thought he’d be better.
He tensed. Tony hoped for their sake that the pup took after Steve.
“A guest?” said Happy.
He set her down on the pillow. The pup swiftly latched. He purrs grew louder when his alpha nuzzled against his neck.
Steve placed his hand on his shoulder as he pushed his next point. “But if you walk out the door, you fight and you fight to kill. And if that’s the choice you make, then, Tony, you are an Avenger.”
As soon as Steve had finished the briefing, the alarm sounded. All of New York was on high alert.
Tony had already seen his anniversary gift from Steve, that morning, on his bedside table, with a note reminding him of their plans to visit Coney Island. They were celebrating a year of marriage.
and a new one –
“Well, what time do you finish? Because there are a couple of midnight screenings at the new theatre and if you want to continue this conversation. Hotel Bossert is where we could enjoy a late-night fondue.”
“Don’t stay down here,” Rhodey advised. “This is the worst place to be. It’s the kill -” he broke off.
in a sea of
Steve nodded as he urged Star forward, and took his position in front of the troops. “Bucky, take your men down the left flank.”
“Not hungry?” asked Clint.
“Well, the van is ready. I’ll follow you,” said Happy.
“They weren’t always diamond. Sometimes it was sapphire or even ruby. Only the ones that lasted more than a week got one,” said Steve. And those were few and far between.
Beta read by AbsolutShenanigans
"They're suffering. They have been for hours. And Pepper is a literal ticking time bomb," said Tony.
Steve took two small water paint canvas from the box in began to work. Without realizing it, he’d painted the night away. Steve leaned back in his chair, stretching out. He yawned. Maybe he’d be able to sleep. He pulled the blankets from the bed and set them up on the floor. Steve woke late the next morning. His back cracked as he turned. There was a vibration from under his pillow. He flipped open his phone. There was a message on the screen from Edith.
“Then, yes. Is that why you smell like that?”
. There were no weapons hidden in the room. Even if there were, most would be useless against Piper. But the beta exuded a confident calm, even though she was aware of Piper’s capabilities. That was terrifying.
“We should take a look at that fang. Study the poison and try making an antidote,” Tony said, still holding on desperately to that last glimmer of hope, which Steve dashed by giving him the dagger, where a yellow crystal now sat in place of a basilisk fang.
“Tony would be a brave and noble dragon. Do you know? He’s the bravest person I’ve ever known. Tony would protect the weak, defend the innocent. He’d be wonderful,” Steve finished, with a wistful smile.
“We fight.”
“Every dime in my wallet. Just be there.”
“And why not? Got something against omegas?” he countered. “Because I thought, you, Steve from Paramus, would know what it’s like to have doors close in your face.”
“No, we’re not,” Tony agreed, shouting over the cacophony of outraged voices. “We’re a family,” he finished and the room went silent as they acknowledged the truth behind his words.
It had always been a workshop. Tony had fond memories of his father at work in this very room. Howard would describe to Tony what he was doing as he tinkered. He’d let Tony help with little tasks. His mother had to bring them drinks and snacks because they wouldn't leave for hours at a time.
Tony was flooded with relief and also guilt. He didn’t deserve Steve’s forgiveness. He didn’t deserve Steve. After all that he’d done. But he couldn't live without him either. “I was scared,” he said
Tony is a BAMF.
“Yeah. Even when I had nothing, I had Bucky,” Steve explained, as the shade from the trees overshadowed his bright smile. The flowers scented bitter. The berries tasted sour. And Tony began to feel cold. It was a strange, unwelcome emotion that had taken root in his heart. He wrenched at it, trying to pull it out, but the seed had been planted.
“Apparently, we all are,” Natasha said, looking over Bruce’s shoulder.
“What’s there to say?” he muttered, glancing at his watch.
Hi everyone! I'm so sorry I took so long.
on Steve's bookshelf and had carried it off to bed the previous night, curious to find out what Valorians thought of the titular mythical beasts. Apparently, he’d bitten off more than he could chew, and had realised after a few pages, that the book was published in High Valorian, which was the much-forgotten language of Steve’s forefathers.
Tony tried to disarm the helicarriers or ground them, but found himself blocked. “Disabling the encryption is an executive order, it takes clearance from two alpha-level members,” Tony informed the SHIELD agents.
The scent of fresh flowers permeated the mansion. Candles were kept alight on just about every table and shelf. A steady stream of mourners paid their last respects, travelling from all corners of the globe and arriving at varying times of the day.
“I do,” came his mother’s quiet voice as she kept her arms around him.
“Yes,” Steve told him. “Nothing lasts forever,” he mumbled, and gave Tony a sad smile.
“We should – you know – now the fighting’s over - we ought to discuss how to end this,” Steve finally said.
Thor was already on the helicarrier when they got there. Taking Loki, he followed Director Fury to a super-secure glass capsule to interrogate his brother about the Chitauri threat.
“Got you,” Tony agreed, beginning to make his way to the position.
A compromise meant meeting in the middle, a halfway point he couldn’t move to. There were too many positions from which he could not budge. But the collision of their worlds had also created new paths, and there were so many other places to meet halfway. The distance wasn’t so large that it couldn’t be crossed. And they had just enough common ground between them to find their way back to each other.
“Yeah, sure,” Steve said, voice tight. But Tony was too caught up in catching up with Rhodey to ask him why.
“They’re doomed, Wanda,” Thanos said. “And you’re unbelievably naive.”
“Who the hell is Bucky?” Tony asked, in time with the confused and devastatingly-beautiful man on the screen.
The write-up claimed that the alternating north-south polarity orientation maximised magnetic field flow, which induced an increase in blood circulation, amongst other health benefits. He had serious doubts about their purported properties, but he appreciated the sentiment, and the fact that they cost $200 apiece. For magnets!
Steve nodded, relieved to hear that the potion was working as planned. “You hear that, my love?” he whispered softly into Tony’s ear. “It’s just the antidote working. You’re going to be fine.”
His helmet was already on the table, discarded in the midst of their back-and-forth. Trembling hands found their way to the jet boots, which were removed, one by one, and lined up beside the helmet. The thigh guards were next, and Tony paused to pick one up, when it fell to the ground with a loud clang. There was a struggle to unfasten the chest plate and Steve stepped forward, trying to assist, only to be held back by Tony’s hand. He shrugged off the arm plates, peeling them from his skin. Then, finally, with a great deal of reluctance, he unclicked the gauntlets, revealing his bare hands.
“I think so,” Clint said, shrugging.
Abruptly, Steve dropped his gaze. “Sorry about the outburst. You have to stop me. I know I’ve got quite the mouth.”
“Uh - you know - ", he stammered, trying to wade his way out. "I am a weapons manufacturer.”
Steve let out a fond sigh. “Dear husband, whatever shall I do with you?”
Tony's heart fluttered with the beginnings of hope. “And – would that be a problem for you – if he
“You’ve looked better,” he said, thankful that Steve was at least responding to his jabs.
“For your cooking? Always.”
“That - is - still - one!” Steve huffed, and stressed his words with stabs to the chests of
saving the world, one invention at a time.
Thank you so much for reading! Love!
you should let me tell it.”
And one of them was going to be his husband.
Tea?” Steve offered, as he held out their good teapot.
. Look what you’ve inspired,” he said, flicking his wrist to bring up images of an army of drones.
But, he got up.
Jarvis stopped what he was doing, shielding his eyes from the sun’s glare. “Mr Perkins is currently, or might I say, perpetually, busy running after your father’s flamingo. So, the task of managing the gardens has fallen on our shoulders.”
The fire crackled cheerfully in the hearth as it sent light and warmth around the throne room. It cast a soft glow on Natalia, who was manipulating her new dagger. Next to her, Clint was pinching the tip of an arrow, which was to be one of many in his new quiver. Behind them, Sam was admiring the shine of a new battleaxe, before he swung.
He made his way to the horses and offered the juiciest apple from his satchel to his noble steed, before distributing the rest. For a while, he sat on the grass, content to watch the horses munching on their treats. After years of faithful service, Nomad was enjoying a well-deserved retirement. Steve had recently acquired Star, a brown stallion with an easy-going temperament and a diamond mark on his forehead, to take his place. Star nuzzled his nose into Steve’s chest and allowed him to stroke his glossy mane. Steve would do it for hours if he could, loving how it felt between his fingers.
“All right. That’s it. I’m coming in.”
“What? Guy has a family. I need to keep him safe, you know?” Tony said, explaining his obsession with constantly improving the armour.
He looked so sad and lost that Tony wanted to hug him but he stopped. Because Natasha was walking their way, looking neither sad nor lost.
. Among other noteworthy constellations, they found
“We’re dragons, Tony. And we answer to Thanos. You should know very well what we’re after.”
“Ready?” Bruce asked when he returned, holding the quill of a bird in his hand.
“Take him down now, huh? Steady, Heracles, that’s why we had Rhodey and Peter with us. You do
“But I did. I shouldn’t have touched. I’m so sorry.”
“I was dead, Mr Stark,” Coulson informed him. “For a few days. But boss man said clocking out wasn't an option.”
“The stones, huh?” Tony asked, as if hearing his thoughts.
And it was Tony Stark.
Tony sucked in a deep breath down his dry throat. Gripping the atomiser tightly, he considered taking a puff himself. Asthma was apparently contagious, because it was his turn to be out of breath, and his heart was fluttering uselessly while his brain were wracked for an appropriate response.
Steve's speech galvanised them into action and soon everyone was on the ground or in the air, kicking lots of ass. And Hulk, angry as always, he smashed, smashed and smashed.
Hot tears sprang to his eyes. Steve loved him. He really loved him, How he wished to hear him say it, just once.
Tony laughed, and pulled his love close, threading a hand through that pretty gold head so he could gaze into his brilliant blue eyes. “You know what?” he murmured, with a heart so full he thought it would burst. “I think I’ve got everything I need.”
Nat rode up beside him and tossed him her spear, which Bucky caught and used to pierce the beast between his shoulder blades. Before the wretched beast hit the ground, Bucky leapt from the shoulders of the groaning troll and back onto his horse, flashing Steve a cocky grin as he rode by.
Notable citizens include: Thanos and his children, Wanda, Pietro
Valoria (Kingdom of the Brave):
There was no time to panic or cheer even as the last leviathans were fought off.
“93 floors is a long way up.”
“It’s all mine,” Steve returned, very polite, in the voice he reserved for people he wanted to keep at a distance. “You planning to be here long?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve let out a deep sigh. “If you really want to come in with me, I don't think I can stop you. But there's something we should agree on.”
“For what?”
,” he deadpanned.
“I am,” Coulson assured him. “Not going to blow up on you, I promise.”
“What?” Bucky said, as he looked scandalised.
“What was I thinking, sir? You’re usually so discreet.”
“Phoenix tears,” Bruce said sadly. “Any chance?” he asked, before looking at Sam, who shook his head. “Well, it’s either that - or - do we know if she had family?”
Steve opened his mouth to speak, only to be interrupted by a loud rumble of thunder. A flash of lightning drew their attention to the once-sunny skies, which were now covered with dark clouds. That was when he saw them - diving toward the beach at a dizzying speed.
“To the guardians,” Strange said, above the clinking of their mugs.
told you that story. Tyranaksthon is a fairytale, just like
“Steve.” When Tony’s eyes flickered up in surprise, the young man was holding out his hand. “Steve Rogers,” he said. “Thought I’d introduce myself before you go on and hurt my feelings.”
“Is mine,” boomed Thor.
Steve was rubbing his wrists as he groaned, “Your friend. He doesn’t like me very much, does he?”
Tony shook his head, and refused to revisit that painful conversation. “What does it matter? He asked me to leave. That was clear enough.”
he wanted (and he wanted a lot). So, the only reason he hadn't was because he didn’t want to give Tony any pressure. He was patiently waiting for him to go first.
“Can’t have that, can we?” Steve asked, trying not to get lost in his gold-brown eyes.
the mortals are dead?”
It was “exceptional”, as far as walnut date loaves went, and that was what he managed to choke out to a highly-tickled Steve before he scrambled out of the car.
“Mr Stark. Huge fan,” the technician professed. “But, threatening people with firearms. That’s not really your style.”
“Couldn’t sleep. Not when you weren’t here.”
A tear. And another. And another one more.
Then, they assembled, a bunch of misfits, in their suits, circling around Steve like the planets. “You know your teams. You know your missions. No mistakes, no do-overs. Be careful. Look out for each other. This is the fight of our lives. And we’re going to win. Whatever it takes. Good luck.”
"Not all of us - ah - them are out to do harm."
Tony bit down on his lower lip. “I have ideas,” he said, giving Steve a look. “But this may not be the right place.”
“I knew you would,” Steve said, and looked away. “And if you hadn’t, it wouldn’t really matter.”
They spent the rest of the morning in a companionable sort of silence, lost in their thoughts. Picking at the food on his plate, Tony wondered how Steve, the only family he had left, was getting on without him. Steve knew how to
Thanos whipped his head around, reared up on his hind legs, and sent an enormous jet of fire at the dracanix, who struggled to retaliate with frostbreath in the face of this raging inferno.
“Get out of here,” Steve urged, pushing Tony towards the exits.
They advanced swiftly, and let out shrill shrieks as they approached. Rhodey and Peter soared toward them, as planned, ready to meet the challenge. Tony was preparing to do the same when he spotted Steve galloping toward him with a worried look on his face.
Thrown onto a car, Steve rolled off, and the assassin leapt after him, making a hole in the tarmac where Steve’s face had been a split second before. Steve hit the assassin’s jaw with a ripped-out car door on his landing. Then, he tossed the assassin over his shoulder, ripping off his mask.
the best protection available. And it was a good alibi for the suits in his workshop. So he didn't have to hide them anymore.
Orange?
“Good. Because we could really use a Hulk.”
Steve leaned forward and took Tony’s hand in his to give it a reassuring squeeze. This had to be the secret Tony was trying to share with him, which was clearly something he preferred to address in private, so Steve changed the subject with as much grace as he could. “Thanos has five stones. And Tony has three,” he summarised, looking at Thor.
Steve turned around just in time to see a fiery circle appearing inside their home, and the Sorcerer Supreme exiting from it.
He never froze, not even when JARVIS warned him about a potentially fatal build-up of ice. “Keep going! Higher, further, faster!”
The look in Steve’s eyes was hard. As was the set of his jaw. Tony knew what he looked like, alone in another alpha’s arms in a deserted part of the building. He wanted to explain himself, to apologise, to fall at Steve’s feet and beg for forgiveness but the words didn't come.
“Yay!” he cheered, and stepped into what had to be the tallest spiral stairwell he’d ever seen.
“And I would die - for any of mine.”
“So, is there something we’re supposed to say or do to make this marriage real? Because I haven’t figured it out. I’ve tried, Steve. I tried to kiss you, and God, that was a disaster. And then I threw myself at you and you turned me away.”
“I think- I should go-” Tony whispered, beginning to feel uncomfortable. “Steve will be looking for me.”
If the bookshelves were secret doors, then one of their books had to be the key. Tony found it soon enough – in a nondescript brown cover with faded lettering on its spine. When Tony pulled the book out of its place, the shelves parted to reveal the space between.
The mountain herself was beautiful. Evergreens had begun to trade their white coats for green robes. Blankets of frost had melted into streams, and their watery percussion was the perfect accompaniment to the songs of courting birds.
King Max had unsheathed the blade to admire the smooth blade.
Tony and Steve attend a Stark Industries Gala and things do not go as planned.
He was going to do this.
Bucky turned his head evasively. “No, Nat, she – she likes to flirt.”
Tony recognised the pair flanking the throne from the colours of their hair. The young male wore his silver hair long, with overgrown locks skimming his forehead, to draw attention to a pair of ice blue eyes. If he was
It made for a beautifully intense pulse of indigo energy that swirled terrifyingly around Tony, going on and on and on, until it stopped. Tony blinked in disbelief as he found himself, kneeling in front of the emperor, although his body remained amazingly unharmed.
Bruce looked at the bed. “Still asleep?” he didn’t quite ask, and brushed past Steve without waiting for an answer. Steve followed him back to the bed, and watched while Bruce peeled back the bandages around Tony’s middle, swallowing the bile at the back of his throat as the sickly-sweet stench of putrid flesh permeated the room.
Tony’s explanation was convincing enough, although it didn’t take much to persuade Steve where his husband was concerned. “Your call,” Tony said, in a bright voice.
Steve looked at him in horrified alarm. “Where’s the princess? I need to help her,” he said, getting to his feet.
Tony jumped when he finally noticed his husband standing in the doorway wearing a look of amusement and a T-shirt at least two sizes too small for his large frame.
He did his job, attaching the device to a large pipe.
Now, Steve could bury his own secret deep in his heart and take it to the grave.
Steve was already waiting by the time Tony made it to their rendezvous.
Lord Strange looked thoughtful. “I suppose one would have to be as specific as possible, so as to eliminate any ambiguity.”
I don't know why I wrote this angsty thing. Blame it all on Endgame, especially that scene with Howard Potts. This was amazingly the ONLY scene where my stone-cold husband cried.
Tony squinted at the diving dragons, who looked familiar for some reason. “They’re the dragons from the mural,” he decided, and raised his arms to the storm clouds gathering above. “The prophecy - it’s happening today. It’s happening right now.”
Steve blinked, swallowed uneasily, as if to brace himself. And Tony had nothing left to lose.
Using the same arm, which was supposed to be trapped between Tony’s teeth, the emperor punched Rhodey and dislodged the knight’s jaw. With both arms now free, Thanos easily pulled out the sword in his neck, and flung it into the blackstone pillar just behind Steve, where it remained trapped.
Nat nodded grimly. “Death,” she said, just in case it wasn’t clear.
“No?” Rhodey said, confused. “Why would I? We’re not even the same size?”
She ignored him as he entered, alienating herself at the other end of the room, so she could finish her peanut butter sandwiches without fielding intrusive questions about her love life.
, the
Arms crossed, he looked down at Tony’s slumped form. “You’re one of us now. Why do you resist giving me the stone? Why do you fight on their side?”
Tony noticed the blood on the upholstery and hurried over with fresh towels.
were having a secret identity, for a whole year, and
and waited.
“Yup, I was thorough," he said, eyes flicking upwards for a quick second. "What about you? Know anything about me?” he asked, curious about what the captain had heard before agreeing to this marriage.
Tony stiffened. “This – it stays on. Okay?” he asked. It was important it did, for he couldn’t control his powers without it, and he had no wish to hurt Steve.
“Or we let them launch. But we change the targeting blades, have them triangulate and destroy one another. Get rid of the threat permanently.”
“What does it look like?” Steve asked, and schooled his face into a neutral expression despite the sinking feeling in his stomach.
Periodically, Sam and Bucky would enter and give him a report of the kingdom’s affairs. Tony hadn’t been their only casualty from that day at the Gladioli Fields. Apart from the wounded they had to tend to, bodies had to be brought home, heroes honoured with the proper rites, arrangements made so their families would be taken care of.
Tony was thrilled to see her for the first time since DC because she and Clint had gone on a long series of missions to mop up what had been left of HYDRA.
Tony frowned at him. “Why are we acting like she’s dead? She’s not dead. She’s petrified. She’s just been petrified by a magical creature. We just need to hit the books, find the right spell, and she’ll be right as rain. There must be some kind of cure,” he said, looking around the beach desperately for help.
Tony stared. That arc reactor had kept him alive, powered the suit that got him out of the caves. For a moment, he was tempted to hold on to it as a reminder of what he’d lost and gained. But the glow of the new unit in his chest changed his mind.
“Twenty thousand, mostly archers.”
It took two strikes of the metal arm to crush his father’s skull as was reported in the autopsy. Then, his lifeless body was dragged to the driver’s seat, positioned to appear slumped over the steering wheel.
He would get by on his own.
“I’ve got an extra blanket if you want.”
“Steve’s a jerk,” he complained, with a lot less heat now that he’d had a whole night to
“There’s no time!” The young man tossed the aerosol extinguisher into a firefighter’s waiting hands, and bent down to pick up something on the ground. “Too much smoke! If I wait any longer, the baby’s going to die!” he yelled. Then, shielding the baby’s head with what looked like the lid of a garbage can, he sprinted down the stairs.
"No, no, don't cry." Tony dabbed away the tears. Steve nuzzled against his neck, breathing his scent. He growled.
“Do you want me to inform him you’re awake?”
“Again?”
Steve followed Tony to the lab. He got into his nest there. Steve sketched as his alpha worked. After a few hours, he grew tired and burrowed under the covers. Thor's blanket was on the top of the pile.
“Tell him what happened, and I’ll call him when I get home,” said Tony.
“What’s the damage?”
"Tell Steve I said hi," said Rhodes.
Instead of getting the alpha simply shook his head.
"What I need is for you to go home be with your mom. Keep your trap shut and guard the suit. And stay connected because when I call you better pick up, okay? Can you feel that we're done here? Move or I'll run you over,” said Tony. He got into the car and rolled down the window. “I’m sorry, kid. You did good.”
Steve froze at the doorway when saw Kate and Tony. The two were sizing each other up. Silent aggression charged the air just waiting for a spark. Steve had seen this before, but never thought it would have over him. Some omegas loved this but Steve hated it.
Tony walked into the entrance of the training base. There was little information he could gather from this facility.
“After Daddy goes over my work, can we paint?”
"You know what they did to my suit?" asked Rhodes.
"I've got her. Get some sleep," said Tony.
Her goal wasn’t to destroy the girl known as Piper Stark. No, she was playing a long term game. The second persona was only a crutch. As time worn on, Piper would see her actions that and believe that was really her, a monster, not someone kind worthy of love. Eventually, her psyche wouldn’t act as an alternative persona, but part of her actual self. The process would take years, but it was the eventual result.
“Mine,” repeated Steve nuzzling close to the alpha.
"Shouldn't you be with them?" asked Steve.
She pulled up an image of the castle.
, he didn't want a new task. He wanted to go home. Fury pointedly blocked the only exit. Steve doubted he could fit through the window in the bathroom, so he would just have to hear what the man had to say.
“He didn’t make it.”
Steve instantly disliked it. Even with the lights on the room was dark. It was painted gray with dark red detailing. It was meant to intimidate. He couldn't imagine having a family here. It felt cold.
“Don’t it again, pup.”
Steve didn't let Tony returned to the lab for the rest of the morning. Around noon Rhodes came to pick Tony for lunch. He was relieved to get Tony out of the house.
“I’m fine. I’m sorry if I worried you,” he said.
"Never said it was a bad thing. It's messy." Piper shoved her hands in her pockets. "Where do we start?"
"I have sympathy for the Starks’ loss, but there's nothing to be done. Without further leads, there's nothing more this organization can do to assist them. Now, why have Captain Rogers and Stark, along with two of our best assassins, flown out?"
Fury walked entered one of the S.H.I.E.L.D’s high-security prison facilities. The guard at the entrance went stiff.
“I could use a boost though,” she said.
“South America again we’re going Chile. To the Atacama Desert the driest in the world,” she said.
“How many?!” growled Tony.
“To protect your self.”
“I get that,” said Clint. He understood that more than Steve could ever know. His family was forced to live on a secluded farm for their own safety. He could only be with them as a father and husband in that small town, even then he had to be extremely careful. Clint tried shaking away the negativity. “Never took Captain America as cradle robber."
“Why?”
*****
Steve took a seat on his couch, turning off Animal Planet. Some treehouse show was on.
“That’s a start,” said Tony.
“But you’re my doctor,” he said.
In the background, Steve heard children playing.
"So, I'm crazy?"
“If you ever go rabid, remember Kevin was the one who hit you.” He strapped her to the examination table. It would be a few hours until their cell would be ready.
“That is the point. That’s Loki’s point. He hit us all right where we live. Why?” said Tony.
“Okay sweetheart." He wrapped the blanket around Steve, tucking him in. "Can I touch you?"
“What triggered it?” asked Steve.
He gave her a sippy cup.
“Isn’t that obvious they want him. They the thought this was an opportune moment to get him,” said Fury.
The frost melted from his gaze. He ran his fingers through her hair before slamming shut the lid closed. Their crates were wheeled out of the room. She tried getting up to see through the vents in her cage. But her limbs were numb and heavy.
"Do you want your parents and agent Hill here during the exam?” asked Edith.
“Call me, Steve,” he said.
“Why?”
"It's not the same."
Tony sighed."I have the full blueprints for the machine but hardly anything on the serum. The few bits and pieces I have don't have anything to connect it with," said Tony.
He chuckled softly. "You'll learn in time."
The phone slipped from his hand.
“Whose your favorite reporter?” asked Tony.
“I’m fine,” he said.
“BE QUIET!” He didn’t want to hear this.
“It’s a habit. It seems to have gotten stronger. I just don’t want to forget,” said Steve.
“And when will be?” asked Tony.
“Where is he?”
Tony and Steve sat outside of a small ice cream shop. It was a tucked-away place. They had yet to gain attention. Steve smiled.
“I’ll cover breakfast,” said Tony.
"I heard," he said.
They went to the little office. Lena took the chessboard from her desk. This time they'd actually have to play.
“Is there something you wanted to talk about?” asked Tony.
Tony raised his chin, kissing him. Steve melted into it, pulling Tony back when they separated. He needed this, just a slight distraction. Finding peace in the gentle interaction. They continued like that for some time, staying in the same rhythm. Eventually, they pulled away though their foreheads still touched.
“Someone needs to train the pup.” Rumlow sauntered over, taking up more space than it seemed he should, looming unnecessarily.
“How would you know that?” asked Tony.
“You aren’t.”
“Any particular location?” she asked.
He tossed something at her. She caught what looked like a dowel rod. The wood was polished and smoothed so it wouldn't splinter in the holder's hand. Its surface was covered in dents and nicks.
“Why?”
Steve bared his neck. He sighed as Tony’s tongue lapped slowly against his skin. Steve found himself dozing off to the deep purr of the alpha. His eyes closed. Tony’s fingers ran through his hair.
Steve went to the kitchen and made grilled cheese sandwiches for the kids. He set it on the picnic table then poured apple juice for Rune and Piper.
“Steve?”
Natasha read the underlying message loud and clear. "Mrs. Zemo, I'll make this clear now, I have no interest in your husband beyond friendship. And your son is a great kid that's hard not to get to know. He told me all about your penguin stories."
“I don’t like meatloaf.” She poked at the mushy square of meat.
“Really?!”
“You listen well, brother-
“Jarvis where are the cleaning supplies?” asked Steve.
“You’ll be fine, Tony. When will it happen?”
The shield’s pattern took on a silver and blue coloration. Even with what Tony added there was no change in the weight or feel of his shield.
“Don’t you roll your eyes at me, young man!” she snapped.
Tony pulled away, pressing a line of kisses down the beauty’s neck, sucking and nipping as he went. Biting down slightly harder at his claim, causing Steve's hips to roll against his. He slid his thigh between Steve's. His hand moved down to the curve of his rear, encouraging Steve into the rhythm. Another hand gently cupping the omega’s jaw. He pulls away looking down between, where their hips still rolled against each other. Before traveling his gaze upward to memorize the relaxed expression Steve wore, knowing it may be some time until he ever saw it again.
It was difficult leaving his alpha. His instincts screamed no that his place was by Alpha in their nest.
“I’m used to running on a few hours of sleep. You’re the one in need of rest,” he said. The omega's scent was getting to him. Steve didn't need him pawing at right now. What he need was sleep.
“Shh,” hushed Edith.
“I have to go undercover for a while. The mission will dictate the time,” she said.
Out of all the thoughts scrambling through his mind, one came shooting forward.
"You don't have to tell me."
“Hello.”
Tony absorbed the image before him. Decorating the omega's neck was the trinket he'd gifted Steve.
“Having S.H.I.E.L.D. take bodies out your penthouse is cause for worry,” said Pepper.
“Sir.”
"I didn't."
“It’s nice to meet you, Dr. Banner. Your work on the antielectron collisions is unparalleled. And I’m a huge fan of how you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster,” said Tony, shaking the fellow scientist’s hand.
“Malibu," said Tony.
“You can’t win!”
“I wouldn’t want to drag him into this," said Steve.
“Rumlow, you can return him to his cell.”
“Jarvis has been running it since I hit the bridge. In a few hours, I’ll know every dirty secret S.H.I.E.L.D. has tried to hide. Blueberry?” said Tony.
Tony looked up when he heard Steve. He wore a pale blue long sleeve shirt and dark blue jeans that hugged his perfectly shaped butt. The shirt was slightly unbuttoned giving a peek of his chest.
“Help,” she cried.
“I missed some important milestones. My son’s first steps, Emma’s first heartbreak among other things. I tried making it up to them spending as much time as I could with them."
Tony raised the omega’s chin.“You'll be stained with my scent for weeks to come once your heat is done. This only temporary, handsome."
“Okay,” he said.
That one word proved how fragile his mate's mental state was.
“Sorry sweet cheeks. I thought you saw me," said Tony, nuzzling against the omega's neck.
“Shocking,” said Steve.
“I should get going, but you’ll need to get these,” said Nat, handing Steve a list.
“Yes, Sir informed to call by Steve from now on."
“Don’t think about that now. You're here, it's time to learn." He handed her a dull knife.
“Tony," he moaned.
“No, thank you."
“He won’t disturb us,” said Lena.
“No,” Helmut acknowledged. He rubbed his face. "Let's not have this argument again. All I want to do is spend the day with my beautiful wife and our son."
“What did you find in the sample?” he asked.
“I don’t feel different,” said Steve.
"And his mother? Rune can't be Jane's," said Steve.
“Her DNA has confirmed what I hypothesized. Not only will she possess a strength possibly greater than yours, Steve, and also a highly effective healing factor. But, you’ve heard this before. We need to bring in a genetic specialist for both of them. I've recommended Dr. Helen Cho,” said Bruce.
“After whatever tortures Fury can concoct. You appear as a friend as a bond and I would cooperate,” said Loki.
“What’s the treatment?” asked Tony.
He dropped her on the other of side the cell. “Stay.”
*****
“Hey, sweetheart."
“Where’s Steve?”
“A potato gun.”
"We don't know what she's been forced to endure, though it can't be any worse than what we've imagined. We don't know how chaotic the rescue may be. It will be scary, but she will know that armor anywhere," said Steve.
Matt nodded. Steve came out of the bathroom.
The conversation eased into less serious topics. Bruce eventually left a bit red in the face from the wine.
“Impressive aim,” said Natasha.
“I’ll get us out of here."
“I’ve got this,” said Clint.
Every day Lena would visit and ask Piper to come with her for a physical. Piper said no every time.
“I’ll stay,” he whispered.
“It’s great, Steve,” said Tony.
“It needs to be done.”
Steve's shoulders dropped slightly. “I want you to promise me something, Tony.”
Steve nodded as he stepped forward. Clint stopped him.
"Only a few minutes," said Tony.
“Nerves,” offered Tony.
Describing Tony as a boyfriend was odd. It didn’t seem a fitting title.
“We’ll try to do better, honey,” said Tony.
“This is good."
*****
“It won’t. You’ll be able to remove it when your cycle is done,” said Edith.
Piper yanked the blanketing through the bars of the crib, wrapping them around herself. She sat by the glass wall waiting for Rune to get up. Rune woke up a few minutes later. She laughed at Rune's terrible bed head.
“We’ll get through this,” he said.
The door opened just as he was about to knock, precisely at eight in the morning.
He paused to look at the assassin who staring at him in a mix of curiosity and wonder.
But Rhodey was holding him back. “I meant me,” he quietly said.
“Ow! Buck! I’m sorry! I said I was. Only about a hundred times!”
"I'd let you go," he whispered, looking into the distance. "Some birds aren't meant to be caged. Their wings are too wide and their songs are too loud. And though life without them is dull and dreary, the world would be brighter with the sight of their feathers and the sound of their songs. If all you want is a sanctuary, that will always be on offer. But if you're looking for a home-" he began, looking at him fondly now, the way Tony realised he always did. "I can give you one too."
Hanging from the spear with one hand and holding the fang in the other, Steve inched toward the middle of the kraken’s face, and looked directly into her hideous eyes. Mustering all the strength left in his body, he swung his arm back and struck.
“The one?” Steve asked, as he felt his brows coming together. “Do you mean Tyranaksthon?”
Obie hadn’t always been like that.
“No, no. You don’t have to. You, just being here, it’s great. You’ve helped me so much. I never thought I’d ever be married. And not to someone like you.”
“That man has no regard for lawn maintenance,” Tony complained. “I’m gonna miss him though. And you are going to miss me.”
Steve stared down at the loaf on his lap. “I don’t do this to be rude, if that’s what you’re asking. I just want to be upfront about who I am. And if that turns people away, then that’s just too bad.” He sighed heavily. “Though now that I’m older, Mother has taken to worrying about my prospects or the lack of them. I don't care about that. I just don't want her to worry about me being bonded to an alcoholic, abusive, knot-headed louse.”
The princess had created a telepathic connection with her people, and was already using it to brief them on the routes of evacuation towards the Fangthorn Forest, where they would wait in safety for the siege to be over.
They had started out, at the beginning, walking side by side. Along the way, Tony had wandered off, made a few detours, without giving Steve a chance to follow. With time, they’d drifted far from each other, losing sight of their destination.
“I’ll go,” Bucky volunteered, stepping into the light.
“I wonder why. I have found most women, your mother included, to be quite uncomplicated,” he said, lowering the eggs into the boiling water. “You, on the other hand, are a hard egg to crack. So, tell me, young sir, what’s bothering you?” he asked.
The rest of them continued their assault on the weakened beast - shooting arrows, thrusting spears and swinging swords. Then the Hulk grabbed the other end of Nat’s spear and impaled the serpent further, ending his life with a final smash against a steel mast. Mortally wounded, the basilisk’s yellow eyes dimmed as he went eerily silent.
The arrow bounced off armoured skin and fell uselessly onto the deck. In response, the wretched creature let out a loud roar, and
“What would you call it?” Bucky just had to ask.
“Go away.”
For all that, they had Steve’s eternal gratitude.
Noting the distraught expression on Tony’s face, he quickly continued. “I’ll be all right soon. Don’t worry. This is nothing. I’ve had worse.”
“Listen,” he said, somewhat shortly. “I’m running out of time. Do you have my suit?”
Time slipped away as he held Tony’s body close to him and breathed in the scent of his hair and his skin, feeling his warmth seeping through their clothing. “It’s okay, Tony. It’s going to be okay,” he lied as tears poured out of his own eyes and down his face. His eyes smarted and his throat burned. The air was heating up, and it was almost impossible to breathe.
“Guys?” Tony called, trying not to panic.
The grasp around his neck loosened, and he fell to the floor. Bracing himself, Tony sucked in a lungful of air, and gasped desperately to fill his starving lungs with the oxygen he needed.
Steve sat down on the bed and placed his arms around Tony’s limp shoulders. He ran his fingers through the matted locks, and hummed a melody to soothe the distressed prince. “I’m sorry,” Steve said. “I’m so sorry, my love,” he repeated, over and over, until the loud cries subsided into whimpers and faded into silence.
“Hey,” Tony softly said, biting his lip.
Steve laughed loudly, and Nat turned and look at them. From where they were, Bucky gave her a quick wave of reassurance.
“Yes, but your door was open, so I assumed that…” Strange trailed off, as his eyes darted between the main door and Tony. “You wanted to know when help was coming.”
He wasn’t sure if it truly was from their home or something his clothes had picked up during his journey. Still, he held on to it like a lifeline, his last connection to the life he remembered, the last of the threads holding him together.
Tony glowered at the white-blue light projected onto their ceiling.
“Your timing is impeccable,” Jarvis said, holding the door so Tony could step inside and follow him to the kitchen. “Ana’s got a last-minute appointment and I’m just about to boil the eggs. Coffee is ready though.”
Steve nodded, and his eyes softened in understanding. For a moment, Tony thought he'd finally got through.
“I don’t know. I’m not – who you think I am. And you – Why would you think we'll be okay?”
“This is my bedroom,” the captain explained, pointing to one of many white doors. “And you can have any other one you like.”
Tony took a breath. Only sixteen days maybe less and they’d be parents. A pup could be born three weeks before or two weeks after the predicted due date. She could come any day now. It was a terrifying thought. Shit, what if she’d come during the battle. He hoped the pup had his sense of timing and would be late.
“You wish," he said.
“No."
“I’ll be good.”
“Good morning, Steve."
“Stealing my thunder, Rogers,” said Tony.
Sir's underlings led him to the solitary confinement cells and pushed into a room. His back hit the wall. The cell was so narrow that it didn't allow him to stretch his arms to their full length. He pressed his hands against the metal door. That's as far his rebellious action went. There was nothing he could do.
“Open the door,” said Steve.
“I’m sorry.”
“He won’t. Now open the damn cell!”
“Don’t you want to be with your Papa and Daddy?” she asked.
“Why would I be scared?”
Stark having a mate would make him more manageable. If things worked out between the two, the end result could be something amazing. A child with Stark’s brains and Captain America’s physical ability created naturally. Fury smirked at picturing the womanizer known as Tony Stark, a dad. It was unlikely to happen unless by accident.
“When are you coming back?” she asked.
"They reintroduced the super-soldier serum to the fetus," she said.
"Who else knows?" he asked.
“Sore.”
“Spit up? She isn’t the first Stark to throw up on me,” said Pepper.
“I find it’s very simple.”
“Do you want to claim me?” he asked.
“Aren’t you going to get up?” asked Tony.
"They likely tracked the call." Tony yawned.
“Very interesting,” said Tony.
“I guess so. But can we play a different game?”
Jarvis had already turned on the tub. Tony helped her out of her clothes, setting her on the tub.
It was almost the end of August. Tomorrow marked four months for Steve. There was no denying his pregnancy now. The reveal went well. They'd started with being seen a baby stores and eventually they came out announced the news that they were having a baby girl. Baby gifts had been arriving since the announcement. They donated most of the clothes and supplies with a few exceptions. Steve kept the three beautiful outfits the queen of England sent them.
Steve groaned locking his jaw. His teeth ground against each other as he bared through cramping aching pain. Tony rubbed his back trying to soothe him. He took a breath as it passed.
“A higher form? You forced our hand. We had to come up with something-
“Hello there, Rune. My name is Pepper,” she said.
“That’s not my range of expertise. It there’s,” he said, gesturing to the scientist.
After a peaceful lunch, Piper dragged Tony to the playroom. Steve left Tony to his fate, knowing the alpha enjoyed constructing whatever Lego structures she had in mind.
“The cell was just in case-
“This Arm and Hammer,” he said.
"Ninety-nine degrees normal. By your temperature, I'm pretty sure you're only having a single pup. Multiples normally cause omegas to run warmer. I won't know for sure until I get an ultrasound. Lay back on the table," she said.
“He could have easily been one of your victims.”
“Because he’s an alpha. Things are easier if you’re an alpha male. Even more so if you're white."
“You were in her room,” said Tony, his voice shaky.
“Can you stop that?” asked ponytail.
“Then it will be arranged,” said Lena.
The first thing that came to mind was a place with her parents.
“Finally a response.”
“It reassures them that you aren’t scared of him.” Piper was advanced in so many ways, but this was where she was at a disadvantage. She sympathized, but couldn't really understand the complexities of what Steve was going through.
Below was a detailed bulleted list of how to use the toy. There was also a diagram. There was a sentence at the end of the note that made him smile.
“An army from outer space?” said Steve.
“What’s wrong?” asked Tony.
Theodore nodded.
“Alright Banner,” he said.
“Ms.-”
"Not of yet," said Jarvis.
"It does,” Piper insisted. That would be like me wanting to hurt you for doing something you couldn't possibly control. It wouldn't be fair."
"Relax, I'll lean up," said Tony.
“I don’t have plans for the holiday. You should spend with whoever is important to you. I wish I still could,” said Steve.
"Tony."
“You’ll be given birth control," she said.
“I’m going to shower,” said Steve before pressing a brief kiss on Tony’s lips.
“It's not so bad."
That explained his migraine. Tony slowly sat up. The ache in his chest lessened in enough for him to stand.
“I hope he’s okay,” said Steve.
“Watch a video then you can decide if your parents will want you.”
"History channel," said Steve.
“You don’t trust me,” he said.
“Time to sleep.”
“l don’t need closure, Jarvis. I need my daughter.”
“And we got to do wake up exercises and classes,” said Rune.
"I was thinking that too," said Tony.
Piper grabbed a set of wire cutters.
“What do we do about this?” asked Tony.
“A hundred plus pairs here."
“Doesn’t matter,” said Piper with a shrug. At this point, she was used to having eyes on her. Privacy was a luxury she'd learned to do without.
August 2, 2013
“I rather trust in something more reliable than magic,” said Tony.
The alpha went to touch him. He grabbed the man's arm, throwing him aside.
Lena took a shaky breath. “I’m sorry.”
It was a black and white image of Tony and Piper. The infant pup had fallen asleep against his chest. One of her small hands rested against the arc reactor as Tony gently kissed her head. Tony couldn't remember the exact day of the moment. It was something that happened so regularly when she was a baby.
“No. It seems you and Papa did alright.”
“They are starch. You need green veggies to grow big and strong.”
"I get my shorts off," said Steve.
“Boss?”
"James Abraham Stark. We're set on boy's name," said Tony.
He lowered his shirt so she could get a look at it. Like Steve's, it was badly irritated.
"Mm, that would be an interesting encounter," Steve smiled.
“No one will notice.” She handed him his jacket. The medals on it chimed. "We should be heading down."
"You will." The instinct to survive would overpower their friendship.
"Don't spend too long there," said Steve.
Steve grabbed a bottle of Advil from the medicine cabinet. He filled a glass with water. Tony swallowed the pills dry. He drank heavily from the glass.
“I’m sorry. I don’t know what else to say. I will take this to my grave." He hoped he said the right thing. What had he done to deserve this level of trust? He couldn’t even hope to understand Steve’s grief. Holding Steve seemed to be best.
"That's not true."
“Shut up."
He went to the bathroom and showered. Steve stopped in front of the mirror. He stared his reflection, glaring at the muffin top he’d formed. It was a first for him. He needed to hit the gym. Part of him was tempted to shave, but he doubted he had the time. He took Piper from Tony’s arm before she could start crying.
Killian walked toward him. Tony went to meet him. He would end Killian then himself.
He ankle was caught in under the metal.
Piper searched for any other useful information. Her gaze froze on her name. She was in the paper! She started reading:
“Alright,” said Tony.
"A peace offering. Sit with me," said Barny.
"A TV personality got arrested for conspiracy, obstruction, and lying to a federal agency," said Tony.
Natasha couldn't read Steve's expression to give her some hint of what to say. "If you don't want this Steve I know someone who can take care of this. It will be untraceable and completely confidential." Something like Plan B wouldn't work on Steve.
"Do that and he's dead."
“I don’t like it,” said Steve.
“Tell her to wait a minute.”
"I'm smarter than most grown-ups," said Piper.
Steve carefully placed the needle in Tony’s arm, taping it in place. He placed Tony in the tub. Steve washed the vomit from Tony’s mouth. He placed a cool cloth over Tony’s forehead.
“About?” asked Natasha.
Silence. Even when her home was quiet she had Jarvis to talk to. Piper curled up in her corner. Sleep was the only activity left for her. She shut her eyes. Piper hoped that her silence might bring the alpha out his quiet but it remained. Sleep came slowly, only to be interrupted when woken for meals.
The pup dared to glare at him. “No, it seems that there was some confusion on our part,” said Fury.
Piper wasn't sure if it was safe. Her stomach growled. She didn't smell anything wrong with it. If they wanted to drug her they would have done it already and in a more effective way than in poisoning the food. They would have gotten her while she was sleeping. Piper knew she needed to eat, keep up her strength. Papa and Daddy were doing the best they could to find her, she reminded herself. She had to do her part, but she wasn’t the only one who needed to eat.
She nodded. He went to Steve’s room and injected the serum into his IV. The irritated orange glow extinguished. Steve relaxed.
Steve maneuvered through the toys littering the room, shed his clothes and got into bed with his mate and pup.
“Little Miss, are you okay? Your heart rate is spiking. Do you want me to fetch one of your parents?”
“How’d it go?”
Fury paused at the door. "I almost forgot." He pulled a letter from his pocket, handing it to Steve. "Howard wanted you to have this. He was sure you'd come back."
"It won't work," said Tony.
“Even now?” asked Tony.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What do you want for breakfast?”
It would have been a far more useful bit of information if he’d seen Winter’s face. Still, there couldn’t be many men with metal arms. It should be easy enough for S.H.I.E.L.D.
None of them would go further than thought, though. But he could dream.
He nodded.
Steve sat in a cushy leather chair in the study. The room was painted green and the walls were lined with shelves. Little tokens of Peggy and Henry’s life littered the shelves. His gaze stopped on a framed photo of his first day of training camp. Why did Peggy have this? Back then he never thought he'd have this. Happily married, a parent, and independent it had been such a far off dream. He came close with, Peggy, but reached it seventy years later with Tony. So many random chances lead him to this point in his life. Piper pulled away stretching out lazily.
Instead of steering him toward the bed, Tony moved him to the shower. He turned on the hot water, letting the glass steam as they shed their clothes. Doing their best, they washed away the heavy strain they carried. Each gentle caress was a reassurance to the other.
“Surprise?” she asked.
Determination burned brightly in her eyes. It was terrifying.
Steve shoved his husband out of the bed.
“That was your neighbor,” said Tony.
“We aren’t doing this again. I'm here for the company,” she said.
- from him like they took everything else. She would be taken away. It was only a matter of time. Piper would be wiped from his memory. He wanted to remember her. The pup pulled away. He wiped away her tears.
“And it won’t come out,” said Steve.
“By five minutes.”
“It isn’t that,” he said.
Her phone vibrated. Steve’s name appeared on the screen. It was the first time he'd contacted her since they found Piper. She didn't blame him. He had more important things to think about.
“I’ll try,” he said. They were both in need of a distraction.
Rune looked over at Piper's drawing. His eyes widened. The page was covered in tall buildings and lights of every color. At the center of it was a large building with a blue A on it. A red and yellow blur was flying through the sky. But it didn't have the same amount of detail as everything else.
Coulson seemed to be a man of importance. Other agents there avoided drawing his attention.
He wasn't going to allow just anyone near his daughter. Steve skimmed through Dr. Bloom's file. She was currently the head of psychiatry at John Hopkins and specialized in treating children. The woman had graduated from Harvard medical school. She seemed so young.
The sound grew more panicked when he gently tapped her shoulder. He sat by her waiting it out. That was all he could offer. It only stopped when the pup's voice went out. All that was left was a muted whimper. She didn’t move.
“Steve, are you-
“Didn’t have time to talk to many reporters. I knew he did some reports on me. I would have done an interview with him,” said Steve.
Two arm guards were assigned to watch him. They shouldn't be a problem. His watch began beeping. One of the guards messed with it trying to get it to shut off.
Steve let out the breath he’d been holding.
Her eyes locked on his. Using her name was the fastest way to pierce through whatever thoughts were clouding her mind.
“Now I understand why he was so secretive,” said Rhodes.
He realized he didn’t want to give up Piper. Even though it was in her best interest. She was the one good thing in his life. He wanted her to stay within his life. It was a selfish unrealistic desire. But he had no power to determine whether she stayed or went.
January 2, 2016
“Your pizza is here,” said Jarvis.
This contact was real. It wasn't the meaningless academic touch of those who worked on him. This was different. He remained still as she slept.
“I don’t have to share with her,” he said.
“Stark, you got a lot of strays sniffing your tail,” said Clint.
“Barny isn’t that kind of doctor. He helps my Papa deal with the past,” she said.
“I can’t stay,” said Phil.
“Why don’t you just build something?”
Steve turned red. Tony ordered a sex book. Why wasn't he surprised? But oddly excited. Part of him was curious.
“Thank you, Sir.”
Alexander Pierce stood in the doorway. His redden cheeks did little to soften his hardened expression. A thick jacket was folded neatly, in his arms.
“You really don’t know why. I thought it would be clear”,
He sniffed Steve’s neck, but the traces of his upcoming heat were weak. Tony ran his tongue over the bite, causing Steve to shake.
"She's hungry I better feed her." She nursed hungrily. He didn’t give in to the comforting sensation. This unconditional loving warmth she was giving him was undeserved.
George wasn’t sure how long they were in the car. The silence was uncomfortable. He could feel the woman beside him, assessing his threat level. They pulled into a storage facility.
“Oh, what’s your reasoning behind that?”
“I know, but can we talk about this guy?” said Tony.
“For me, it is early,” said Tony.
“The others are waiting,” said Tony.
“Me?” he said.
“People are concerned about you, Tony. Steve is, and I am, too,” said Rhodes.
Their lips met in a soft kiss. His inner omega took control, shoving her away.
"Seemed perfect to me when I was a kid, but the grass always looks greener on the other side."
And there were the pet names, like -
While waiting, Steve stole a few glances at the prince, in his royal dress, crown on his head. No. This was no man of war. The prince belonged on a throne of plush velvet, where he would be handfed grapes and wine.
“I just did,” Strange told him sagely as he created new portals below them, where he sent unsuspecting berserkers off the battlefield and back to the underworld.
Steve cocked his head sideways, looking for a bill.
in,” Tony chimed in as his eyes lit up. “Wait. I read this in a book,” he said.
You trust him?” Steve asked, still looking troubled and unhappy.
Thor frequently brought him gifts- technology from a planet where Science and magic were one and the same. Over copious amounts of cup-breakingly good coffee and boxes of pop-tarts, the oldest and youngest member of the pack traded folk tales and children's stories. Then, he graciously let Tony beat him at
With Steve on his back, Tony glided up the chain of volcanoes, and landed on the ledge of the largest one.  Vomiryune was covered in snaking fissures that wound around the mountain. From their vantage point, they looked like fiery serpents desperately escaping the volcano’s reeking head, which fumed and bubbled with liquid fire.
Tony shifted forward in his seat, curious. “For the record, I didn’t write it. What did it say about me?”
“And here we are, desperately short,” Nat said. “We should just barge in and take what we need.”
“Yeah,” Tony told him, softly. “Why’d you leave it behind?”
“It was warm last night. With you,” Tony added for the benefit of his oblivious husband, notoriously slow on the uptake when it came to such things.
Bruce snorted. “Bearing gifts?”
They laughed. And laughed. Then laughed some more. They were having a moment. For a few good minutes, they enjoyed the view of Miami from the rooftop, celebrating their victory and what they’d almost lost and found.
“I’m not!”
His eyes danced over Steve’s bare body as he admired his broad shoulders and arms, that muscled chest and small waist. Wandering hands grazed the planes of Steve’s back, stroking his skin lightly, before coming to rest at the back of his neck.
“Not anymore, is what you told the press. Thought we’d gone into clean energy and intelli-crops?”
Blood was oozing from a couple of deep gashes that ran down one side of Steve’s face. The chainmail was dented, but under it, there was no sign of broken bones or cracked ribs.  “Steve!” he called and shook the king lightly, but Steve didn’t rouse, in spite of his desperate cries.
It was meant to be a diversion, but Tony soon learnt that something had, in fact, gone terribly wrong.
And his weary heart felt so full that Steve thought it would burst.
Steve finally tore his eyes away from the window. He looked surprised to see Tony in front of him with the unspoken question on his face.
And, as if an idea had suddenly occurred to her, she said, “Tony’s been teaching me about compromise, you know? What would you say to half a lemon each?”
Then the
Tony could tell from the troubled looks on the knights' faces that whatever they had wasn’t enough. “We’ll call on our reserves,” Steve said, reluctantly. “And our bannermen.”
“Yes. Bed is amazing. Not too soft and very, very warm.” It was, though not as warm as being in Steve's arms, where he wanted to linger forever.
“Hiding,” Wanda answered and pointed in the direction of Dragonrocke, with her eyes fixed to the highest tower of the blackstone fortress, “as cowards often do.”
Happy was beside him in a moment, taking in his tearful expression and the bags he’d packed in anticipation of this outcome. “Do you need me to find you accommodation?” he asked.
“You know, Killian?” Tony said, walking towards the alpha. “After you've said so much, I still don’t know. Who, really, is the Mandarin?”
phase he never grew out of. “J, the eggs!” he cried.
“Any idea where the dracanix went?” Tony asked as he mounted his horse, looking around for their mysterious ally, who’d disappeared once the fighting was over.
It shone. Like a beacon calling him home. A beacon in the form of gold hair, blue eyes and dazzling white perfect teeth. And the scent of pop-tarts and pancakes and ice cream. And the voice, equal parts hopeful and broken.
Strange hummed thoughtfully, and opened a portal leading to some sort of library. He slipped his hand inside and pulled a book off one of many shelves and into the bedroom.
It had been a week of small talk and big revelations.
Thank you to
“Sorry, Tony,” the boy named Peter apologised, and turned to Steve. “My apologies, your majesty. I don’t mean any offence. I’m a long-time admirer of your work.”
“In our defence,” Tony began primly, keeping the smile on his face even as he bristled with mock outrage. “There was a war, but had I known that I’d one day stuck in traffic with a bonafide hero, I would have made it our top priority.”
“Yeah,” he said, his hand on the arc reactor. “Was I the right guy in the right place at the right time? Because you obviously didn't marry me for my perfect body.”
Tony had to look away, overwhelmed by the images of Steve gritting his teeth, struggling in his bonds.
Steve handed over the reins. "This is - ah - my wedding gift for you," he told Tony.
“Please tell me that nobody kissed me,” Tony blurted, and Steve laughed in spite of the tears in his eyes. “Because I know it wasn’t the tears,” he said, shooting a quick glance of concern at Steve. “And I was dying, not petrified,” Tony reasoned, talking himself out of his state of disorientation.
They were. They were his family. He’d found them, all on his own. It was little and broken, but growing, and very, very good.
With Rhodey around to handle any accidents, Tony felt confident enough to join the crew. He added a number of new drinks to the menu, and thrilled their guests when he set the spirits on fire, mostly for dramatic flair.
Steve found himself laughing along. “It’s one of our traditions,” he explained. “It supposed to represent the start of a new journey - together.”
“Actually, I’m your squire,” Tony responded, laying the shield over his arm.
might and find that this isn't what you want. I’m not what omegas are supposed to be like and I don’t think I can change -."
There was another pause, then Loki’s rich, silky voice lured them back to the story, with enticing new images of its setting and secondary characters. “A benevolent dragon, Rex craved neither power nor riches, embracing a solitary life in the great lakes of Vanaheim. Sadly, kings and nobles, warriors and mages from all over the nine realms coveted his abilities, and they desired his powers for themselves. And one day, the humans decided to combine their magic to create a monster to challenge Rex.”
“Yes, but the palladium was also killing me. So, I invented a new element and named it after me.”
“Bruce Banner, our Royal Healer. He manages the herb garden and our orchard. He didn't make it to our wedding unfortunately. He was feeling - um - indisposed. I’ll introduce you some day. You’ll like him. He’s a bit like you.”
“This way,” Steve whispered, as he led Tony into another deep, dark tunnel.
Tony was taken aback. “But why?” he asked. “It would surely be safer with you.”
“I’ve been a fool,” Steve muttered, and squeezed his eyes shut.
. Then, he bought a utility knife and a saw from
“Why are you doing this?” she asked, referring to his unusual invitation to have breakfast because they usually did not eat that sort of thing, at least not together.
And boy was he ready for the fight of his life.
“Off world.”
From the trees, a robin chirped merrily while squirrels gathered acorns under the oak. Surrounded by all this beauty, something ugly bloomed in his heart. “Bucky?” he repeated, his voice strained.
“That's why
Truly, it sounded too good to be true – for six gems to grant their keeper an eternal wish, but then again, collecting the six dragonstones was by no means an easy feat, with the last triumph having taken place a hundred thousand years ago.
“What about Tyranaksthon? Surely, he’ll defend his island. He’s not going to let these forests raze to the ground.”
“It does. But I guess there are more important things than having offspring. Like providing the best environment for them to thrive in.”
And Tony was swept up by a wave of gratitude and dizzying euphoria. So, he shifted closer and lifted his heels such that he was on his toes. Tilting his head towards Steve, he pressed his lips against his cheek. Steve smelled so good, and Tony found his hands circling Steve’s neck, pulling him closer.
Steve and Loki had words, then Natasha and Loki had words. Loki obviously didn’t like the words because he shot a blast of blue at the quinjet, but Nat manoeuvred it expertly out of the way.
“Troll!” Tony shouted, and his warning allowed Steve to narrowly avoid getting hammered on the head with a spiked club.
“You know, J,” he told Jarvis, taking his bags from the man. “It’s a shame you and Ana never had children of your own.”
Steve bit back a growl, his body, his large, perfect body flushing in response.
Tony hummed. “Barnes has a good memory and Wilson must have had help. Owls?”
“Wait,” Steve said, and it was followed by a deafening crack.
"Steve-"
“Make your move, Reindeer Games,” he threatened, prepared to defend his family.
Steve shrugged. “We can't be the only ones going against Thanos. His tyranny needs to be ended."
Memories of the frightened boy, with the lightest of hair and the brightest of eyes, begging Tony not to close his eyes all those years ago in the Wanderer’s Woods.
It was a long ride, the first of many in their journey together. He was about to mention it, but the prince had already gone. Steve laughed. Then, with a pull of the reins and a click of his tongue, he went after his husband.
“What do you know about your captors?”
“You did,” Tony agreed.
"Tony?” he gasped, and his eyes were full of disbelief and pain. “Why is it you?”
of their magic,” he said.
Steve had told him the Black Widow was going to be there, providing additional security for the Stark Industries Gala but nothing could have prepared him for her presence. She was so beautiful and sexy in that red dress, her tiny waist accentuated in a gold belt. Tony couldn’t take his eyes off her. And neither could Steve.
is the cure. And I was sooooo close to having him perfect. I –”
While Tony barely responded to the first and second injections, the third one brought about a distinct reaction, even if the muffled groan and the quiet trembling hadn’t quite been the one they were expecting.
“But you have to,” Steve said, and looked sadly back at him.
From above Ivan, Peter dived and kicked the chrome dragon's head with his feet, causing him to stumble backward. Steve hurled his shield at Ivan’s head and struck him again, right where Peter had kicked.
What he first needed to find were Steve and Nat, so he hacked into surveillance systems and accessed the cameras along the freeways. He found Fury leaving the Triskelion, and followed his SUV on a relatively uneventful drive towards NYC, where things took a dramatic turn on the interstate, just outside the city.
Tony held his breath and braced himself for the worst, but held out for a miracle, which arrived in the form of a blue bubble surrounding Steve that slowed his descent just enough for Tony to slide under the falling king. The bubble burst and Steve, who had righted himself by then, landed nicely on Tony’s back, which strained joyfully under his glorious weight.
“Yeah, we should,” Tony said. It was probably better like this – to get all the important stuff out of the way so they could move on and live their best lives, without the fear of history repeating itself. “Any ideas?” he asked.
“You all right?” Tony asked, as he turned his head to check on his rider, after a particularly close shave.
“It wasn’t him,” Steve instinctively said as he braced himself.
Thank you to Serinah for beta-reading this! I couldn't have done it without you! :D
The dragon let out a snort. “It’s an odd thing to say, but yes, you’re not wrong,” he said.
They glided over the boggy marshes and through the briar thickets, taking care to avoid their stabbing thorns and hooked barbs, before coming up on Dragonrocke and its towering walls of blackstone that went for miles around, like a nest of dragons in various states of unrest.
“Well?” Steve finally asked, as the silence dragged on.
The man named Pietro stepped forward to introduce the titan in the room, using the common tongue this time, for Steve's sake. “Presenting Emperor Thanos, Commander of the legions of Anguisia. The Mad Titan, Masterlord and Overmaster. He, who rules with absolute power and unchallenged supremacy. Kneel before him and rise into the ranks of his great conquest.”
“Sorry, buddy. Pretty sure the doctors are right about that one.” There were late bloomers among omegas, who sometimes only had their first heats when they were well in their twenties. It didn’t make them any less of one, even if Tony understood why Steve thought that would make him exempt from SHIELD’s rules.
,” Hill answered. “Widow got us samples during our investigation. The virus, stabilised with Kree blood, resurrected him. Then, we kept him somewhere safe while he recuperated.”
And engraved in his beautiful hand:
“What?” Tony exclaimed, astonished, and looked almost afraid to take it.
“Neither will Armestria. Just like us, they can't afford to lose this war. They will send us the weapons, with or without a wedding. You know that.”
Steve’s brows furrowed at the sight of Tony’s medallion, hanging around the neck of the statue. As far as Steve knew, Tony never took it off. Why did he have to? Was someone making him?
“The dragonstones,” Tony breathed, in an awed voice, and turned his palms outward to catch the colourful lights descending upon them as the images of Rex and Thanos faded from view.
Steve picked up the wooden box and opened it. It was dull and ordinary and its contents were hardly anything to shout about. It didn’t matter that Steve had worked long and hard at it. Compared to the wonder of the medallion, it was a gift that would always come up short.
Tony froze as Obie peered into his eyes. His face was so close that Tony could feel his warm breath against his skin. “This had better not be a trick,” the dragon warned as he pressed a talon against his cheek.
“If you’re going that far north, you might as well ride into Ferrecita and ask for the Iron Legion,” Tony suggested.
, he thought with a flutter in his chest. He wondered how the prince of one of the most prosperous nations, was going to fit in with his family, and tolerate their simple ways and coarse manners?
(See the end of the chapter for
After that though, his thirst for power made him vicious.
Tony seethed. What was the point of being an Avenger if they couldn’t avenge the people who needed it most? How many lives had to be lost before they were allowed in?
Tony shut his eyes in an attempt to drift off but his head and his body refused to cooperate. His mind was racing with nagging doubts. And his body. Just what was going on with his body?
“And neither are you,” he told her, quietly.
Rhodes chuckled as he answered the question. “Sir, the prince is one of the best riders in the kingdom. You’ll see. He’s got a very impressive seat.”
“Then this is a very important week for you, isn’t it?”
“I thought you were sleeping,” Steve mumbled softly, breathing in the scent of Tony’s hair.
“That’s too bad,” Stane said, sighing loudly. “Maybe Ivan can jolt your memory.”
He couldn't have done that when he hadn't even known who he was or who he was about to become. But now, he did.
A newly-refurbished filmhouse offered a welcome respite from the sultry afternoon heat, so it was there that Tony studied the posters of new releases and wondered if he could persuade someone from a shrinking pool of unmarried friends to see one with him. Of course, there was always the option of seeing a film on his own, but there just was something about sharing popcorn and sodas that completed the cinematic experience.
Tony would have to be honest about what he’d done, face the music (or the lack of) and accept the consequences, whatever they were. But this wasn’t just about Tony’s fear of correction. He just really didn’t want Steve to be upset with him.
Steve met him midway, taking his horrified friend into his arms. “Buck, stop,” he said, and held on to him tightly, knowing that the knight was going to take it hard.
It was light, sharp and perfectly balanced
“More like hell. You begged us to let you die,” she reminded him. “In any case, Bruce created an antidote and he’s been cured.”
It was magic.
Nat returned with a loud gasp, prompting Bucky to look down in shock at her living, breathing body. He sat back on his heels and casually raked a hand through his messy hair. He cleared his throat, opening and closing his mouth in an attempt to speak, but no words came out.
The room tensed as its occupants waited for Fury to answer the question. Thor and Natasha approached the director, circling him without saying a word. Just before he could respond, Steve returned, slamming a large HYDRA gun on the table.
Tony cocked his head and gave him a look. “You know what just happened? We defeated their ships, slayed those beasts. But they’ll be back. And next time, they’ll fight to win.”
Tony paused. “All this is good, right?” he asked, looking up for a quick second.
“Did I wake you?” Tony asked, turning back around so he lay on his back.
For a quick moment, Steve considered pursuing the retreating armada, to strike while the iron was hot and declare a firm victory.
Between them, the superspies spoke over twenty languages, including American Sign Language. Yet, their primary means of communication was a system of head tilts, brow raises, eye rolls, nose wriggles and mouth twitches. With their coaching, Tony soon mastered this dialect, which they used routinely to talk about Steve.
“Captain Rogers. It’s an honour. We’ve never met. I’m Aldrich Killian,” he said, holding out his hand.
Then, he saw the likes of Rumlow and Rollins ordering Steve and Natasha to the ground, slapping cuffs on their wrists. His mouth fell open. Coulson and Hill stared at each other in stunned silence.
Steve gazed at her coldly. “No,” he said.
“Yes, yes. Of course,” Steve promised, as he held him just a little closer.
“Now, this is live. I'm not sure if you can tell, but at this moment the body is trying to decide whether to accept
“Yeah, good. Because you looked a little spaced out back there. Sure you don’t want to sit this one out?” Tony asked.
They mounted their horses and made their way toward the front of the cavalcade when Tony pulled the horse he'd swiftly named Stripe to an abrupt stop.
Steve sat down carefully on the edge of the bed and brushed away Tony’s long bangs to gaze at the dark lashes resting against pale cheeks. He brought the glass of cool water to Tony’s parched lips, and willed them to open.
Turning it over, Steve found a carving of an ouroboros, a serpent swallowing its own tail - a symbol of life, death and rebirth. Numb fingers traced the carving of the sea serpent in endless circles as his mind continued to whirl with the words he’d heard.
In fact, he felt strong and powerful, with the magic of six infinity stones flowing through his body. Tony rose to his feet and raised his paws, which were glowing with power. He watched as they drew the stones of Thanos’ clenched fingers and onto his. As they went onto his hands, the bands of dragonbone shifted and closed around his fingers to form a snug fit, like they had always belonged to him.
Steve took Tony’s hand and pulled him to his feet. “Why?” he asked. “In a hurry to get to our tent?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s you,” Steve said, as Wanda left the room and the sounds of her footsteps faded away.
“What is it like being married to Captain America?” he asked, turning his head to look at Tony.
He reached for Tony, as if to touch his face, but Steve rushed forward to strike Thanos on the side of his head with his shield.
“I’ve gone ahead to view alternate futures - to see all the possible outcomes of the coming conflict.”
"Yes, of course," Steve said easily, and the corners of his lips quirked upwards. "It's just like us mortals. Not all of us are out to do good."
He looked up at the heavy church doors staring him down, judging his worth as they slowly opened, their hinges whining in protest of the impending ceremony and the countless ones preceding it.
beautiful.
Tony swallowed and stubbornly clenched his jaw, all the while blinking back tears. “I’m sorry,” he said in a broken voice.
They had a plan to escape together. And it would have worked. It was just too bad they never got to execute it. Tony hadn’t cried tears of relief when he was rescued, but tears of regret. If only they had one more day. If only they had one more night.
“Yeah. I’ve been running," he said. "Did thirteen miles in thirty minutes because I had a late start.”
The blood obscured two long cuts, which ran across the entire palm. Tony winced, and his own hand began to hurt. With care, he took the bleeding hand into his and kissed the wounds slowly, infusing them with magic so they could heal.
“Death!” the warriors echoed, as they beat their spears against their shields.
Nat shook her head. “Oh. I take it back.”
“And today, you saved me,” Steve countered. “You can’t go on helping me indefinitely because of that.”
“You’re in love with Tony Stark,” he strained to speak, before sinking into a bottomless pit of despair.
“Stay on my six, cover high and don't shoot me in the back. See if you can give us the cover of darkness.”
As they broke apart, he opened his eyes to find Steve staring, pupils dark.
"It means get lost!" Tony informed him.
“Thank you, Brother,” Thor whispered. “And that is
"But still I wonder,” Steve mused. “Do you think it’s true? That Thanos has recruited all of the world’s dragons to his cause?”
“Yes. I was very impressed. Where did you learn how to do that?”
Notable citizens include: Tony, Rhodey, Peter, Strange
But Jarvis disagreed. “Life is hard, whoever you are. It is never going to be easy to take the high road, especially when you’re struggling at the intersections on your long journey home.”
Wanda raised her wing, and held Thanos in place with a stream of scarlet energy, as she used her other wing to shoot fireballs in his direction. Smirking at her response, Thanos created a blue-purple energy field around him quite effortlessly, which rendered himself immune to her attacks.
Feeling lightheaded, Steve had to take a steadying breath. “Excuse me a moment,” Steve said apologetically, and Pietro nodded politely in response. Without waiting for another word, Steve hurried toward Lord Strange and the other sorcerers on the other side of the room.
“There isn’t any left. The antidote though, we’ve got a lot,” Coulson said, pointing to a large refrigerated cupboard where the counteragents were kept.
“Tomato, tomato. Potato, potato. Get over here. Need food.  Now.”
Drawn to its alluring glow, Tony reached for the gem, which floated slowly into his open palm. As Tony closed his fingers around it, the gem attached itself to him and the band of dragonbone it came with broke apart and came back together in order to go around Tony's talon.
Steve was in between phases, or the virus was taking a bit of a break. Either way, the alpha looked relatively free of pain, just sleeping. Tony was tempted to watch him sleep, but he had a plan and time was not on their side.
Clint shot them down fairly easily, but with each attempt involving more warriors charging at greater speeds, it wasn’t certain how long they could keep it up. “What do we do?” Clint asked, as he glanced at Steve.
“The guy with the horns was obviously trying to kill you, so I had to take him down,” Steve said, in a tone so casual he might as well be talking about weeding.
Tony was going to make himself pancakes. Then he decided to make some for Steve. It was the polite and practical thing to do. Steve wasn’t the enemy but a potential ally. Tony flipped the blueberry pancakes over a heated pan till they were golden brown. And then, he’d plated them with honey, lots of cream and the finesse of a dessert chef.
It was large, probably just as large as the Christmas gift Steve had proudly given him that morning and said he couldn’t open till Christmas. But Rhodey was gesturing for him to open it then.
Alone in the workshop, Tony stepped into the grid so his robots could do their magic. He tapped his foot impatiently, feeling like a toddler being dressed by the help. At the rate it was going, Steve and Nat would be done by the time he got the suit on.
Without any power, he could only rely on the force to send him hurtling towards the mothership. He deposited the missile as close as he could to the thermal exhaust port and watched it implode in a supernova, with the rest of the armada. It was a heavenly sight.
Steve nodded his head slowly, acknowledging what he did. His face was coloured in shame.
When the birthday candles had been blown out and they’d had their cake, they’d raced upstairs for the rooftop, where his birthday gift was set up.
“Now, swift and decisive – just what you asked for.”
“Hey, Schellehead, what now?” Peter asked, as he desperately tried to keep the struggling dragon from moving.
“You look nice,” she said, trying her best to sound cheerful. “I'm going to miss you."
“Steve.”
“You know, for a man who wants to avoid stress, you picked a hell of a place,” Tony commented, referring to Bruce’s decision to hide in one of the busiest cities in India, a place where he stuck out like a sore thumb.
. It’s too damn late for that.”
Beside him, Loki wrinkled his nose. “Adventuring? That’s what you call
Spreading his wings to keep steady, Tony could feel Steve getting to his feet, as he prepared to hurl his shield.
Steve gave him an amused smile. “Someday, you'll have to tell me what that means,” he said, referring to the endearment in Tony’s mother tongue.
“Yeah. That, too. But also how you run your country. And I didn’t expect you to be so attractive. You know, you’re even more handsome in person than in those portraits.”
The mythical monsters were still advancing when Strange jumped from Tony’s back. With his magic cloak billowing after him, he descended gracefully into the middle of the horde. “By the crimson bands of Cyttorak which kept the monster chained, I conjure strands of primal force to keep the war contained.”
“Good work, Tony,” Steve said over the comms.
“Does this have something to do with your secret identity?”
“There is no version of you that I wouldn't be fond of.”
“Yeah, platters of them.”
Rhodey instantly had his gun trained on the technician. “I swear to God, Tones. I’m going to blow this guy’s brains out,” he warned, voice rising in a theatrical show of bad-cop frustration.
Morita’s
“He’s noticed,” Bucky said drily as he rode up on Blaze. Addressing Steve, he dropped his voice to a whisper, “It’s a horseriding term. No need to get all flustered, even if your new husband is very fetching.”
“You did, kid,” Fury said, finally putting his phone in his pocket. “And I voted for you, like the rest of the team.”
“I am. It – It’s for me, right?”
“Our father,” Pietro said.
“Steve, he can do it," he said. "Let him do it. Please."
“At least I’m little,” he said, shrugging.
deck as their own horns sounded in a rejoinder.
It was only four in the morning, and he was getting up. There was so much to be done. And Tony had a feeling that time was running out.
Tony tried to twist out of his firm grasp. “Steve,” he hissed. “We’ve got a ten-second window. Miss it and we’re supper.”
Finally, he went around the house, collecting the items on his list. He placed some files in his suitcase, then picked up the rest: a pillow, a blanket, some clothes (not one of them his).
Tony tried to slow down his breathing as he shifted his attention to the camera facing on the bus. Tony counted four mercenaries closing in, firearms trained on the vehicle. Their machine guns swept the vehicle from the front to the back. Biting his nails, Tony imagined Steve running the gauntlet of bullets, before diving out the back window and rolling out of sight.
No amount of hoarded treasure could make him more beautiful or worthy of Steve’s attention. He was a monster, and a
His eyes glazed over and hot tears spilled out of them. They weren’t the same proud tears he shed for a brother or his own father, when they fought bravely on the battlefield and died a beautiful death. The tears flowed in abundance, rolling down his cheeks, landing on her exposed forearm, right where the fang had pierced her skin.
Magic beat out of Tony’s heart and coursed through his veins. His body expanded with wings that burst out of his shoulder blades as his skin hardened into armour of red and gold. Whispering a nifty little charm he’d recently learnt, he transformed his chainmail shirt and trousers into the reinforced tips that covered the ridges along his back.
“A husband. You might have heard of him. Tall guy, very handsome. Hates bullies. He’s got a very particular set of skills, skills he’s acquired over a very long career. Skills that make him a nightmare for people like you. So, if you take me back before he finds out, everything will be fine. Or not. I can't promise anything. He's got a temper. But if you don’t, then all of you are dead.”
Bucky stiffened at the question. “Because our women - raise real men.”
“Unless Selvig has figured out how to stabilise the quantum tunnelling effect,” Bruce pointed out.
"Would you," Bucky asked, eyeing her closely as he dragged himself to his feet, "marry a stranger?"
It only took a quick glance at the stockpile of weapons lining the cave to confirm the truth behind those words. Tony blinked, confused. SI produced weapons exclusively for the U.S. Army. So, how had the insurgents got their hands on their products?
Steve took a deep breath before his next attempt, a flanking manoeuvre this time. “Why are you so keen to fight?” he asked, softly, looking deeply into his eyes like it contained the answers to all his questions. “There are so many important jobs.”
Young leaves and flower buds had only just begun sprouting on the dormant trees, but warm winds would one day graze their shores, and lift the golden-brown leaves from their branches and onto the ground, where they would inevitably be buried under fresh snow.
“No one speaks Latin. You can read or write it. But you can’t speak it,” Pepper informed him.
Steve thought their marriage would have progressed past the awkward phase by now, considering the way they’d taken to each other almost immediately. Sadly, that was not the case. If anything, it seemed to have inexplicably regressed, right after their visit to the garden. Still, Steve would wait. He’d wait as long as he needed.
Steve bit back a grin, secretly pleased that of all the horses, Tony had singled out the horse Steve had chosen for him - a brown stallion with a long, white stripe down his forehead. He turned to the riders. “We ride on horseback,” he said.
“Here’s what we’re going to do,” Steve began. “To harness the arc reactor, Loki has to be right here, on our rooftop. Thor, I need you to disarm him, make sure he doesn’t open the portal. Widow and Hawkeye will take the helicarrier, hold off Loki’s men. Hulk stays close to the ground. No one in and no one out.”
“Was I right?” asked Tony.
“Oh.”
“Shh, little one, it’s time to sleep,” Tony whispered. She seemed to settle. If only he could follow his own advice.
He winced when she slapped him on the back of the head.
Steve nodded before joining his husband in the kitchen. Tony was quietly making a drink.
“How’d you get out of the wormhole?”
“Thor as in the god of thunder?” said Steve.
"What do you want?" asked Tony.
Pierce followed Lena out of the room, albeit a little reluctantly. He'd rather watch them battle in person, but he'd seen what the pups were capable of. Precautions had to be taken.
“How would you know how he’d treat them?” asked Steve. He couldn’t stop the growl in his voice. There was a gagging sound at the other end of the phone.
"Will you tell me where we're going, Happy?" asked Steve.
Natasha simply arched one her elegant eyebrows. She followed Steve's gaze, snagging the object before he could. Her eyes widened at what she'd caught. A positive pregnancy test.
Steve sat on a S.H.I.E.L.D hospital bed. His leg was being patched up. But the ache in his side lingered. Agent Hill debriefed them in their room. S.H.I.E.L.D. had gathered no new intelligence on the Winter Solider since their last encounter with him. That was nearly three years ago when Winter ambushed him on a plane injecting Piper with the super-soldier serum, while still in his stomach.
He backed away as Tony came closer. There was nothing threatening about his posture. He would have felt better if Tony were angry.
Steve laughed. "All alphas are."
“I was wrong, director the world hasn’t changed a bit,” said Steve. He moved closer to Tony and Bruce not trusting Fury. Thor and Natasha came in.
"If the subject rejects Extremis they explode. The Mandarin bombing were misfires," said Tony.
“No,” said Steve.
“Promise?”
Steve almost growled at the AI’s sarcastic tone. He needed to get into the shower. Steve went into the bathroom. The frigid water was a welcome jolt. It cleared the feral haze sweeping over his mind. There was a knock at the bathroom door.
All that earned was a slight grunt.
“You’ve been staring at the canvas for three hours."
“Yes, sir and I’ll keep an eye on his progress."
“No one is perfect, Steve. Everyone has issues, including me. If you found a way to work through all the better for you. It only proves you’re human,” said Tony.

“I can read about a thousand words per minute. Nothing too amazing. The world’s fastest reader could read twenty-five thousand words a minute.”
She smiled at the bright yellow coloring. It had been so long since she was exposed to anything but gray of her prison. She slipped on the shirt and sunflower patterned skirt, then shoved her feet into her shoes, staring helplessly at her shoelaces. Daddy knelt to tie them for her. “Einstein didn’t learn how to tie his shoes until was teenager,” he said.
“When did this start?”
"It was a good fight. Wish you could remember."
In ABO products like Plan B can be used up to two the three weeks after heat.
A knock on the door disturbed him from his reading. There was a knock on his door. He opened it. Edith stood outside his doorway with a box filled with popcorn and candy.
"Yes, sir," she said weakly.
“What is Neema’s position?” asked Steve.
"At any point did intercourse become painful?" asked Edith.
“You scared the shit out me, Steve!” said Tony. He pressed a kiss to the omega lips.
“You trust me?” said Tony.
The design was simple, child’s play for him. With a click, the collar fell away with a loud clunk. Steve bared his neck. Tony’s canine sharpened, wanting to mark the omega as his. Never before had an omega so tempted him to claim. He sucked a mark onto Steve’s neck, causing him to shiver and purr in pleasure. It was not enough for either them, but it had to be. A symbol on the man uniform caught his eye, Hydra.
He lowered himself to the ground, not wanting to stand. Steve handed him a large bowl of scrambled eggs.
*****
Piper sat on the floor, watching the process. She hadn’t known Aunt Nat could dance. It was another girly sport. Something that would further push her into the expected omega female shape. But she could humor her aunt, but she was sure this wouldn’t be for her.
"It's not important."
“Sir, Ms. Potts is here."
She grabbed his hand before he could run.
*****
“Sorry.” Piper realized she shouldn’t have risked losing one of the few good things she had by questioning. Being curious was in her nature, but now wasn’t the time for that.
“Thanks, Steve you have no idea how much this means to me. I’ll make sure to pay you back,” said Clint.
“Jarvis put the coffee on.”
“How desperate am I? You threaten my world with war. You steal a force you can’t possibly hope to control. You talk about peace and kill cause it’s fun. You’ve made me very desperate. You might not be glad that you did,” said Fury.
“I’ll sum it up for you to save us both time. Mr. Stark is willing to pay off all your student loans and refund anything you’ve already paid in full if you keep this incident to yourself,” said Jeri.

“Very good, Piper. Let’s with through some relaxation techniques and then you can go. Ok?” Piper nodded "Now, I want you to take a deep breath in and out."
She rolled her eyes.
“What do I have for you.”
“She's a bit temperamental," he said, rubbing his stomach.
“We don’t need them,” said Tony.
Steve went still.
“Captain Rogers."
“Have you told him?” asked Barny.
There was nothing in the debriefing packet about this.
Piper drooled at the smell pizza. Junk food was never allowed at the base. It was only given as bribes to get her and Rune behave.
It pulled uncomfortably at his chest; something he did not want to admit when they were likely being watched.
Tony wanted to dive further into the subject, but Steve rested his head against his shoulder.
Natasha ran his fingers through his hair.
Steve turned to see scrawny little omega. He had red hair and big green eyes.
"Tony," called Steve from the bedroom.
"Steve?" said Tony.
"Piper, we live in a world of aliens, super soldiers, and as much as I hate to admit it magic. Who's to say there isn't an afterlife? If something happened to your friends, wouldn't you want to believe there was something better?"
“We don’t mean to keep things from, but it’s part of being a parent. You want to protect your child, and sometimes that means keeping things from them even when you shouldn’t,” said Steve.
Tony nervously looked at Steve's leg. He was currently bleeding out onto the leather seats.
Steve eventually forced himself up with a few minutes to spare.  He stayed in his shorts. The doorbell rang.
"Yep."
"That was the most relaxed you've been all day. I saw no reason to."
