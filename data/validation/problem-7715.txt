“Get in,” the director says shortly. “We’ve caught Loki.” I swear, snatching my duffel bag from its place at my side and hurrying after the dark-skinned man, tablet tucked under one arm. My bare skin is covered by a jacket, even if it’s nearly summer.
The Quinjet lands, floor rocking gently underneath my feet, and I silently pray for this to all go well as I lead the way out of the cargo bay doors.
jet. Clint taps into the private channel him, Natasha, Phil and me had shared when we were Strike Team Delta to update me on news regarding Nat.
“Found anything, doctor?” I ask, waltzing into the lab, a piping-hot mug of coffee in one hand. It’s much more crowded in here than when I left. “I’m on a schedule, so if you’ve got anything, I can get there fast if you need me to. Procrastination is at five, then I’ve got assassinations at seven and eight thirty.”
The acoustics of the ship are pretty good, and we hear Ultron right off the bat. Tipping my head to one side, I hold up four fingers.
But I know that she’s going to go to my files as soon as I’m out of the room and jot down a note that says that my condition ‘hasn’t worsened’ or that I ‘seem to be retaining a state of mental stability’.
The impact knocks all the wind out of me, and before I can recover the Soldier has flung Steve off of him and whipped out a knife, which plunged down towards my head. I roll away, sitting up and scrambling away from the advancing Soldier like a pathetic crab, until I’ve run out of platform and swap over to air. Steve lunges, shieldless, and the Soldier catches him by the throat.
Everyone, even Steve with his third-degree burns and Clint with his broken ankle in a new cast, is showing up, which means that we’re ordering copious amounts of takeout to accommodate for all enhanced metabolisms.
I hiss at the sting, but quickly vault over the side of the railing and fly out between the curved wall and the targeting control panel. The Soldier’s eyes narrow, and he reaches for something on his belt, bringing it up almost faster than I can register.
I’m almost at the control panel when the catwalk creaks with extra weight. Freezing, I turn around slowly, slipping the chip back into the inside pocket.
“C—Hawkeye?” I try. “Cap?” My voice echoes back at me. Heart beating up in my throat, I practically throw myself over the railing and fly up to the catwalk above me. I give a mental sigh of relief as I catch sight of Clint kneeling beside Nat.
Nick's body jerks. The heart monitor beeps.
Honestly, the Tower could single-handedly keep the takeout industry in business because that seems to be all we eat.
Everything's so... calm. Peaceful, safe for the occasional supervillain attack. The first time I'd been reluctant to go out. By now, I'm always happy to go, because it means tha I'm out there with my team and we all fit together like puzzle pieces. Sure, Steve and Tony butt heads a lot, but it's mostly tempered by the quick glances at each others' asses. It's kinda funny to watch, actually.
~~~~~
"Fuck Fury," I mumble. "Call me at a reasonable hour and I might just say yes. Even better, call someone else. Like Ghost. Annoy her."
He slams on the brakes, and I fly forwards, cracking my head on the windshield. The weight on the roof of the car goes flying off and lands in the middle of the road. Sparks fly, accompanying the sound of screeching metal as the Winter Soldier drags his metal hand across the asphalt.
"I'm going to try running a tracer," Natasha mutters. "This is a program SHIELD developed to track hostile malware after Clint bribed the Sci Div into bugging the system for Valentine's Day, so if we can't read the file, maybe we can find out where it came from."
And Steve felt like a jerk, while thinking he ruined their friendship with just one simple, stupid gesture.
"Uh, Tony? You alive there, Tones?" Steve joked, bumping into his shoulder gently. He smiled softly, and God, it was beautiful.
The girls stopped at Wanda's locker, and then Natasha's, before finally stopping at Steve's locker. He just grabbed his binder and a pencil, stealing his coffee back from Natasha.
"Nothing, Stark. You're just..you." Steve's eyes quickly fell down, not wanting to catch Tony's strong gaze. "You're a billionaire, a playboy, and a celebrity, and people bug you?".
"Uh, sure!" he answered, before being pulled into a chaste kiss. Tony's hands went to his small waist, holding him close, and Steve was shocked.
"Steve, old pal, are you dying?". Steve looked up and noticed Sam staring down at him.
Tonyy: goodnight, stevie ♥
"So, are you my official boyfriend?" Tony questioned, raising an eyebrow. Steve grinned a goofy grin.
School has just begun, and Tony realizes that he's in love with Steve. But does Steve share the feelings?
Steve can't get Tony out of hair, and maybe he doesn't want to.
"I love you too, Tony. And even though you're some big genius, you're a real goofball," Steve replied, chuckling as he kissed Tony softly. Tony eagerly kissed back.
"Yes, they do," he huffed, crossing his arms and turning away.
"Steve, are you alright?" Natasha asked, walking beside him. She had Wanda's hand locked in hers.
15 new messages from Tonyy
"Donuts. Got them especially for us," Tony answered, sitting them on the kitchen table. He winked at Steve, causing the smaller to blush.
"6:30? Who gets up this early?" he asked himself, as he dressed in a light blue button up and khakis. He decided to wear his new Converse, and put on a small gray jacket, since he got cold easily.
"Why thank you. You're looking good, too." Steve blushed and turned the other way, grabbing his backpack from the couch.
"Of course I do. Are you accusing me of not trusting you?" Steve asked, crossing his arms over his small chest.
"Yeah, just worried about this year is all," he lied.
"Nothing, Stark. What's up with you?" Steve snapped back, glaring at his friend.
"How did you guess?" Tony teased, chuckling and running a hand through his hair, smiling at the blond, and if he thought Steve was hot before, he was wrong. Steve was laughing with him, his eyes closed and his mouth open, and Tony blushed. He fucking blushed.
"Have a good day at school, honey. Oh, and tell Tony I said 'hi'!" Sarah exclaimed, kissing Steve's cheek and waltzing out the door.
Tony had gotten home to the Stark tower after midnight or so, and while he was sitting in his living room watching TV, he thought of Steve.
"Nothing, just had an argument, and Steve's still pissed with me. It was really stupid," Tony answered.
"It was just a guess," Steve joked back, grinning a stupid grin, and it took all of Tony's willpower to not kiss him right there. Steve glanced down at his phone, checking the time, and said, "well, I better get going. I have work tomorrow."
"Love you, babe!" Ruby smiled, giving Sam a kiss before she left. Steve just sat in the back awkwardly, fumbling with his hands nervously. He was clearly third wheeling, and he didn't want to intrude on Sam's love life.
Tonyy: Are we still doing ap bio together?? You promisedddd
Steve was leaving Fury's office in a hurry, for it was almost one o'clock.
This chapter isn't that interesting, but it gives you an inside-look of Steve and Tony's school life.
"Oh, what the hell..? Why would I be important to him?" he asked himself, before falling asleep, waiting for tomorrow.
"Thank you," Steve said, sipping the martini slowly, getting used to the taste of alcohol.
In the middle of the movie, Steve yawned.
"Oh, there's no catch,
"How was your day?" Tony asked, pulling away and leading him into the restaurant, where they were immediately sat at a window view table.
or anything. That would be crazy.." he mumbled.
"No need. We will always be here for you," Wanda told him, smiling at him. Steve knew they would be.
Sorry for taking forever to post the next chapter! Please forgive me!
His health.
"I hate him," she growled, as Natasha grabbed her waist.
Tony didn't stay too long at Steve's house. They just had dinner with Sarah, and answered questions that she threw their way, before Tony decided to leave, giving Steve an awkward smile as he did so.
"You can't fall in love with him," Steve reminded himself, after he had hung up and laid down in bed. He pulled the soft blue blanket over his chest, pulling it up to his chin, and sighed, turning the TV on and putting on an old black and white romance movie.
"Let's go, pretty boy," Tony chuckled, grabbing Steve's hand and pulling him across the casino, where people were making money and losing some, laughing and crying, betting cash for no real purpose.
“Well, fuck..” Steve muttered to himself, as he stood in a corner. Tony’s “little party” was in full swing, and the blond really wondered how many friends Tony had. There had to be at least fifty people in the room; most of which, were drunk.
The drive to work was as tiring as usual, Steve riding with Sam in the backseat, while Sam and Ruby talked about a house they looked at a month ago.
"Well, um..see you around, Sam!" Steve said, before leaving with Natasha and Wanda again, the other group already at their lockers.
“I- uh...thanks, I guess..” he murmured to the floor, not once looking up at Tony. The brunette smiled devishly, whispering, “anytime,” before Steve explained that he was leaving and Tony walked him to the taxi, but not without giving him a kiss on the cheek.
"I swear you love my mom more than I do," he joked, laughing a little. Tony laughed along with him.
"Hi Sam," Steve replied, as Sam pulled him in an arm crushing hug. Steve gasped for air, causing Sam to let him go.
"Same goes for me. People bug me," he said, not once glancing up at Steve, who had become curious.
A response came a few seconds later.
"Have I ever told you how much I love school, mom?" Steve asked his mom the night before senior year started. They were eating take-out from the chinese place down the road.
Wait, did he just say sexy? Oh god, Steve was going to have a stroke.
"Y- yeah, Tones," Steve answered. Tony smiled, before linking his arm in Steve's and walking down the hallway, with Steve blushing the whole time.
"What the fuck is your problem, Steve?" Tony asked once they were both in the car. They had just left Steve's house.
The episode was halfway through when Steve heard a knock on the door, and he scrambled up to get it.
"Well, hi there," Tony's voice rang out, and Steve felt himself grinning. "Is this a bad time or..?".
"Hello?" he answered, stopping at his locker. Most of the kids had left, but Steve saw Tony at his locker.
"Hey guys!" Tony yelled, walking beside Steve. Steve completely ignored him.
His phone buzzed in his pocket. Someone was calling him. Steve glanced at his phone, only to find his mom's caller ID.
"7:15. We still have some time, Stevie." He rolled his eyes. Steve was always a worrier. The blond looked up and caught his eyes, starting a little staring contest between the two.
"Hey Steve, are you ready?" Tony asked, walking beside the blonde.
Steve reached his house, and he payed the uber with an extra tip, before stepping inside his condo, the place dark and bleak, and he made a mental note to get more decorations.
The teacher asked the fifteen students to draw something important to them.
Steve: Yep. Now get some sleep. Coffee isn't gonna help you tomorrow.
"Is it that Remy guy?" Steve questioned. Wanda slowly nodded.
A shame, but at least Steve could have some peace. Sure, he loved his friends to death, hell, he would kill himself or anyone for them, but they were chaotic. Really, really chaotic.
"No, Stevie. I'm not accusing you of anything," Tony promised, grabbing Steve's hand and squeezing it tight. Steve flushed, smiling a little.
"Y- yeah.." he choked, before sighing and hanging up on Tony, walking inside his house. His mom was at work, and so he just put his wet clothes in the dryer and changed into a hoodie and a pair of paint covered sweatpants, before settling on the couch, a crime show playing before him. Steve loosely tossed a blanket over him, covering his upper body and his thighs.
Tony won when Steve looked down at his shoes. He would never admit he was lost in Tony's eyes.
Steve Rogers had fucked up, and Tony has to make sure he doesn't kill himself by standing in the rain.
So, he drew New York. He didn't have a photographic memory of New York, but he could draw the hell out of the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty.
"Of course we are, Tones."
"Fury said he has a mission for us," Sam told him, causing Steve's curiosity to bubble up.
"Good morning, Steve!" Mrs. Wilson, the teacher and Sam's mom, welcomed him.
The two talked and then went to talk with Pepper and Liam, and Tony played poker with some guys while Steve watched, perched at Tony's side while the billionaire had an arm locked around his waist.
But, alas, that’s what had happened.
"What do you think, genius?" Steve snapped at him, before talking to Wanda who sat in front of him.
Sam just rolled his eyes. He was going to make a remark about how he loved Peggy, but with the way Steve was glaring at him, he would be thrown across the room if he did.
They reached Tony's car a few minutes later.
The following day, Tony had invited Steve to a small party of his that he was hosting in a private room in his casino. Steve reluctantly agreed, only because Tony had promised not to leave him alone with strangers.
"You come here often?" asked Tony, finally letting go of Steve's hand and leading him to the bar. Steve shook his head.
Most of class was spent with Steve and Tony passing notes to each other.
Steve had just gotten home when Tony texted him to see how he was doing. He replied with tired, and three tired emojis to go with it. He was then left on delivered, and Steve sighed.
"Y- yeah, I'm alive..." he answered blankly, his face slowly turning red. He was glad Steve was an oblivious little bastard because he didn't seem to notice it.
"Hey, Steve!" he calmly greeted, smiling like he was on top of the world.
Steve drew the skyscrapers, and lightly drew the Statue of Liberty, making it seem more...vintage.
Steve's best friend had graduated last year and was now in the army, so Steve didn't see him much. Steve knew how much Tony disliked Bucky; he made it very clear when Bucky took Steve to the movies one time.
"Coming!" he yelled, putting the lid on his cup and ran for the door. When he opened it, he was surprised to find Tony standing there, holding a paper bag.
“Uh, not trying to get into your pants?”.
"You ok, Steve?" Sam suddenly asked, looking at the blond from the rearview mirror. Steve nodded, glancing out the window, where they were passing Iron Gambling. He couldn't see Tony, but he knew the billionaire was probably living his best life.
That set Steve off. Tony thought he was adorable?
Steve smiled, and he felt himself blushing. And so, he decided to reply.
Iron Gambling was in full swing, the night full of laughter, disappointment, and for one lucky person, love.
"Ow! I'm alive, dumbo!" Tony snapped back, his gaze shifting from Steve to Bruce. He heard Steve laugh from across the table.
He called Tony, but could barely hear the billionaire over the casino's music and screaming, and promised to call tomorrow, and Tony agreed.
"Oh, I bet..." Clint muttered to himself, before grabbing Pietro by the arm and dragging him inside. The others followed, chatting about their summers and other things like that.
"Its just us?" Steve questioned, as he sat in the passengers seat. He put his sweaty hands in his lap, fumbling his fingers around nervously. Being alone with his crush isn't how he planned the afternoon.
"What about?" Steve asked, raising an eyebrow. It couldn't be good, that was for sure.
After their fifth class, it was lunchtime. Naturally, the whole group sat together, talking about different things.
"Tony, I'll be fine. I don't want you crashing because of me," he said, walking around the sidewalk, pulling the hood of his favorite hoodie over his head more, the front of them hood reaching his eyes.
'What the hell does he want now?' Steve thought to himself, as he texted back what?
fuck him into my midlife crisis."
"You have a little something on your face, genius," Steve teased, before using his finger to wipe the mustache off of Tony. Tony chuckled, while Steve giggled. Tony's breath got caught in his throat. Steve Rogers, the great love of his life, just fucking giggled. It was adorable.
"Well, I suppose I'll just have to get in his pants the
"What are you implying, pretty?" he asked cockily, smirking smugly at the nickname.  His smirked widened when he saw Steve's cheek flush pink.
"Of course I am," he answered, before pulling Tony by the collar of his shirt and kissing him again.
"In love with who?!" he snapped, sitting up quickly to glare at his best friend. Sam smirked devishly. Steve frowned at him, a glare in his blue eyes.
Steve blushed at that. He could smell the alcohol on Tony’s breath, and he pushed the billionaire away from his gently, though Tony still stumbled like a drunk man.
Tonyy: Yes sir, oh short blonde adorable one
Now, Tony Stark was an international playboy. He had sex every night, and usually not with the same person. He also owned Iron Gambling, had inherited it from his father when he died in a car crash.
"T- Tony..what are we-" Steve started, but Tony interjected with, "just let it happen, baby." With that being said, Tony pressed their lips together again, pushing Steve into the living room and on the couch.
Surprisingly, his luck had seemed to change, because Tony picked up the phone. He answered the phone.
"Um, yeah.." Steve told him, raising an eyebrow. Why was Tony so worried?
"No, no, it's fine! I was just eating," Steve told him, leaning against the bar that he almost never used. He usually didn't have guests over.
"Excuse me, guys, but which one of you is Steve Rogers?" Tony asked, a smirk on his lips and an eyebrow raised cockily.
"Great! So we're still on for Stan's?" he asked.
Steve and Tony goof around after school, and Steve starts to feel a void in his soul. Also, is wanting to kiss your best friend normal?
Steve: Yes Tony. Now get some sleep
Steve Rogers had fucked up, and now, he was standing in the rain, calling Tony for the tenth time that night.
"Firstly, I'm fine, and second, I suppose we can," Steve answered, looking down at his shoes, white converse.
"I just wanted to see if you wanted a ride to school...since, you know, Bucky doesn't go there anymore.." Tony explained, his sentence trailing off. Of course he had to bring up Bucky.
"Goddamnit, I don't love anybody!" he snapped, staring at the other man. "And I'm not
"Oh, I will bug you," Steve snapped, getting annoyed. People flirting with him pissed him off, but for some reason, Tony's flirting was amusing.
"What happened in the car this morning?" she asked Tony, perching her elbows on his desk.
“Are you trying to have sex with me?” asked Steve, a dark glare in his eyes. He was used to people wanting a good time with him, but he had thought Tony was different.
"Nothing! God, clearly something is wrong with you!" Tony yelled, glaring back. "You've always acted like a dick to me. I wanna know why."
And so, the great bastard Tony Stark, came up with a genius plan to make Steven Grant Rogers
Biology sucked. It was the first class on the day, and after papers had been handed out, everyone got to work on them.
"Hey, if you want, I can drive you to your place," Tony suggested, but Steve shook his head.
As it would turn out, Tony's phone died, and he answered as soon as he could.
"I suppose I can have a little fun," he finally replied, looking over to Sam. "You can just go without me. I can call an uber."
"So, how are you doing, Stark?" Bruce asked, glancing at Steve, and then Tony.
Steve just left him on delivered.
"Alright, Tony. See you at one," Steve smiled, and he hung up, finishing the granola bar before leaving for his job at Shield, which was being an agent.
“No, no! I mean, I would like to..” Steve seemed to glare more at that, “I mean, I just- I like you for more than you’re body!” Tony eventually said. “You’re more of a friend to me than anybody else!”.
And no surprise, Tony was one of them.
"I'm gonna make him mine, one way or another," he told himself, smiling a wide smile and lowering his eyes in a predatory gaze.
"I don't think she will, Tones," Steve joked, before getting out and walking with Tony into the small diner.
Playing some quiet music, Steve showered, not realizing that his best friend, and somewhat crush, Tony Stark,  was blowing up his phone with texts.
And he was kissing back.
"Tony? Earth to Tony!" Bruce snapped, poking Tony's cheek.
"You were the one who started it, Tony," Steve reminded him, glaring. Tony turned to apologize, but Steve just put his head down and sighed.
“Goddammit,” I mutter, doubling over to dry my legs. “I’ll be right out.”
~~~~~
“I don’t know how to explain it. I was younger. My mind was more malleable. They could shape it however they wanted, and it’s stupid, but I’m so grateful towards them. That they didn’t turn me into something…” I bite my lip, grasping for words that don’t quite fit. “Something,” I finish lamely, taking a sip of scalding tea. “The Soldier—fuck, I mean,
"There was no contract," Clint replies, frowning right back. I stick my tongue out at him.
don’t
“Do you have enough room to move around in there?” Steve finally asks.
I narrow my eyes. “I think you know what I mean.”
“What dialect?” Steve asks, hands resting on his hips. Bruce glances back at the computer.
"I need to take him," Maria says softly, voice strained. She's been crying, I can tell without looking.
“He’s uploading himself into the body,” Cho says, moving one hand towards Steve weakly. Her voice is strained, although I suppose one would be under enormous pressure when bleeding from a potentially fatal wound.
Backing away, he's forced into Steve, and quickly reverses so that he can attack the supersoldier. Steve's shield slams into Batroc, knocking him to the ground and forcing him back towards me. The merc braces his hands against the deck and uses it as support to bring his lower body up in a movement like some sort of worm from hell. I lean to the side in order to look around Batroc, raising my eyebrows at Steve. The blonde nods.
"As I’ll ever be,” I reply flippantly, jogging ahead of the supersoldier. He rolls his eyes, but not in an annoyed way. I consider it a success, and do a little mental happy dance.
“How were you guys planning on beating that?”
She tells us that Lucky is having a great time running around on the farm.
I wince at the sudden shrill noises, and the Soldier’s head snaps around. Then he’s sprinting away, disappearing into the maze of cars. I swear, rubbing my temples.
I leap out of the way, tossing the Chitauri tech to one side as I dive. Rolling to my feet, I slide out of the way of a Chitauri's blade before using my hands to brace myself as I bring my feet up to kick the alien away. Scrambling to my feet, I activtvate my reaper and jam it into the Chitauri's skull. Yanking it out in one harsh, jerky move, I run back to where Steve is fending off a small group by himself.
“I know,” he says, whispering. I want to laugh. It’s one in the morning, and the only person in the Tower who might be awake at this point is Tony, and he’s on the lab five floors below. I may share my floor with Clint and Nat at times, but Nat is away on a not-SHIELD-sanctioned mission (code for: SHIELD may have fallen, but Nick is still calling the shots from time to time) and Clint is in Bed-Stuy for one reason or another. Probably to watch for the any Tracksuit Mafia members who may have taken his week-long absence as incentive to attack the apartment.
"That would ruin the image of the all-American posterboy forever," the archer mutters.
And then Tony Stark gasps, jerking up before letting his head thunk back against the ground once more.
“He does have a point,” I say, crossing my legs. “SHIELD is an intelligence organization, don’t let the name fool you. And an intelligence organization that fears intelligence? Historically not possible.” I pop a blueberry into my mouth, pushing it into my cheek so that I can speak. “My hypothetically nonexistent soul is on Loki trying to wind us up, though. He wants to start a war, and if we don’t cover every base, he’ll get exactly what he wants. If we don’t look into whatever Nick is squirreling away, we only have half of the puzzle to poke at.”
. I relax my shoulders intentionally, pulling out a flannel.
A pause.
“Speak English!” Cap yells.
An hour later, I peer over Clint and Natasha’s shoulders as New York comes into view, careful not to accidentally touch anything with my bare skin. My radio is clipped to my shoulder, hair pulled back in a high pony in order to avoid it getting in my way.
“Dr. Cho!”
"What about Laurie from IT?" Natasha asks as Steve begins walking again. "She seems kinda nice."
“Maria, meet Sam,” Clint introduces quickly. “Sam, Maria. Can we please leave?”
I drop to the ground, following Steve through a door on the roof.
“Recall that?” Tony demands. “A hostile alien army dame charging through a hole in space. We’re standing three hundred feet below it. We’re the Avengers.”
~~~~~
“Everyone’s…” Tony pauses, a conflicted expression flitting over his face. He looks to me, and I nod slightly. “We took a hit,” the billionaire says. “We’ll shake it off.”
“I was throwing up,” Sitwell says. “I get seasick.” The backs of his ankle hits the edge and he windmills his arms around as he tips backwards. Steve’s hands shoot out, grabbing the lapels of his jacket and yanking him back up. Natasha smirks, leaving to go stand just behind Steve.
I clench my jaw, bracing my hands on the slippery glass, and drag myself over to position my hands underneath the metal on the Soldier’s other side. Together, Steve and I pull the metal up just enough for the Soldier to wriggle out from under it.
"I'm multi-tasking," the redhead calls over her shoulder, splitting off to jump over the railing. Clint jogs up beside me, bow out and arrow nocked. Steve nods once to the archer, and Clint grins back.
“You gonna stop me, Sparkles?” I counter challengingly. The Asgardian makes to step towards me, but Stark distracts the both of us.
“Thor, Cam, you’re with Tony and me. Our job is to back him up, and if it comes down to a fight you three are going to be aerial support. Tony will be looking after Ultron, but I want you two to take out anything else up in the air that Clint doesn’t get.”
There’s a helicopter somewhere, I realize dully. Don’t dwell on it, because there are flashes of
"This isn't like flying with Iron Man," I warn the archer. "Actually, I'm not sure if this is even going to work, because the last time I carried a passenger was three years ago, and that was a baby." Clint gives me a look.
"It happened right as I was about to tell you about" —
I was sick and tired of being a weapon. I wanted a normal life, powers or no. They wouldn't let me quit. Some bullshit story about me not being safe for the public. I decided to play their game and hacked their mainframe, threatened to post it online." I grin bitterly. Both Natasha and Maria are avoiding my eyes. I can feel Phil's gaze boring into my back.
But now—now I live among friends that would never let me do that to myself again, would support me throughout whatever came my way. There is no reason to try and cut the pain away anymore, because there are people to lift my burden and make it lighter.
"You know how I feel," grumbled Clint, crossing his arms over his chest.
Steve walked by himself, smiling sadly as he looked at his friend group. He really missed Bucky, but he had other friends to keep him company.
Tony was dressed in a black polo and black jeans, paired with a pair of vans and a dark gray jacket. He looked extremely attractive, and he was to Steve.
"Good, I'll make reservations for a new place that opened up by the casino. I'll send you the address and meet you at one, ok?" the billionaire suggested, as he got out of his car and stood outside his casino.
When the uber pulled up, he got in and gave the driver the address, before trying to relax in the backseat and look out the window. Steve was attracted to the small shops that were scattered in Brooklyn, and he was staring, until his phone buzzed. He looked to see a message from unknown.
"It was fine, I suppose," Steve answered, putting a hand under his chin and he looked out the window. Tony nodded, looking at the menu.
A knock at the door pulled Steve out of his thoughts as he poured himself coffee.
Everyone had a partner. Lucky for him, Steve got Tony, and so they worked together, Tony having to explain things to the blonde.
"Hello, guys!" he greeted, smiling brightly. He was "fashionably late", clothed in a pastel blue t-shirt and gray ripped jeans, with his casual blue vans. His hair was as curly as ever.
," Tony said, before straightening his tie and standing up, walking over to where Steve was doubled over in laughter.
"She's fine. We're going to have a movie marathon this Saturday and she's excited about that," Steve answered, smiling. Tony grinned.
"Please pick up," he begged, sending a silent prayer to God that his best friend would pick up his phone and listen to his full, six notebook page apology.
"You're an idiot, you know," he joked. "Of course I forgive you." Tony smiled.
"Tony, hi! I- um...I- I'm sorry about kissing your cheek earlier, and I've written a six page apology that I was going to say, but I'm out in the rain and-" Steve's rambling was cut off by, "you're out in the rain?!".
"Well, anyways, I was wondering how you were, and if you wanted to go out for lunch or something," Tony said, a smug grin on his face. His plan was to woo Steve at lunch and get him to fall for him, so he could get that beautiful ass in action.
Tony ended up winning, and Steve cheered for him, smiling brightly.
"No problem, gorgeous," Tony replied, hitting their glasses together and sipping the martini quickly.
"Thanks, Tones," Steve whispered back, before the bell rang, and class began.
"What do you think about it, Clint?" Bruce asked, turning to the male who had a huge crush on Pietro.
The next morning, Steve woke up to his mom making coffee. He slowly got up, expecting it to be early, and he was right.
Around 8:30, Steve grabbed a granola bar and was halfway through eating it when his phone rang.
"Well, I'll probably be needing one. My mom left," Steve replied, "speaking of which, she says hi."
"Briefly. I've met him before, maybe about eight months ago. His name is Steve Rogers, and from what I've heard, lots of people want the chance to fuck him, but he's a rejector," Pepper explained, and Tony couldn't have wanted to screw the guy more. "He works for Shield and is one of Fury's favorites."
"Hi, Stark," Wanda greeted, waving a little at him. He waved back.
Tonyy: Hell yeahhh. My treat remember?
"Hello, gorgeous!" Tony greeted. He was dressed in a maroon suit, and Steve wondered if he was underdressed.
"Come inside. Nice outfit by the way," complimented Steve, as Tony walked in and shut the door.
"Me too. Maybe I can tutor you if you need help," Tony suggested, sitting beside Steve. Steve just shrugged, getting his notebook out and started to doodle little flowers on a paper.
"How come you're such a good artist? All I can draw are blueprints," Tony grumbled, tearing a piece of the paper off and looking at the flower.
face," he growled, standing up and dragging Tony outside. Tony laughed quietly, a perfect smile on his lips, and Steve suddenly felt the urge to kiss him.
"Tony freaking Stark, if you don't shut up in the next minute, I will pummel my tiny fists into your
“Whatever you say, bud,” was all he said, and that was the end of that conversation.
Steve could never really remember his father well. He died during 9/11, and his side of the family just disappeared after his death. So, Sarah was pretty much the only family Steve had.
"Don't worry, Wands, I was just at Remy's. He's really sweet," Pietro gushed over his boyfriend.
A blond male, with a hell of a jawline and baby blue eyes was leaning against the wall, his body lean and his skin pale. He laughed at something his friend, a tall black male with black hair and brown eyes, said.
"Pretty good, actually. Just trying to get two people together," Bruce answered, looking at Clint, who was laughing with Pietro. He gestured to them so Tony would get the jest. Tony nodded, understanding what he meant.
The bell rang, interrupting the moment.
"Uh, not trying to get in your pants?"
"Of course, Steve, my schedule's clear!" Tony answered quickly. Steve rolled his eyes.
"Yeah, Steve?" he asked, and suddenly, in a few seconds flat, Steve kissed his cheek before taking Tony's car keys from his pocket and unlocking the car.
"I didn't expect someone like you to say that," Steve said honestly, shrugging his shoulders. At that, Tony looked up, an eyebrow in a perfect arch, and he coughed.
"Are you looking at the blond?" Pepper's voice broke through Tony's thoughts of hitting her boyfriend with one of his expensive cars.
"Ninth period you have art, and I have robotics," Tony reminded, as they walked down the hallway together. Bruce followed behind, texting his long-distance boyfriend, Thor. Thor lived in Australia, and they met on some astronomy website.
Maybe he should just tell Steve how he feels. Hey, homecoming was coming up in a few weeks. Maybe ask Steve to the dance.
The class was pretty small; he recognized a few people, but none of his friends. Of course, none of his friends appreciated art like he did.
But did Steve fucking care?
"Wait." Tony looked down at Steve, who was thinking. "Why now?" he asked softly, his pointer finger running along Tony's cheek.
"Th- thanks, Tones," Steve said, blushing a bright pink.
"Hey, Rogers!" Sam Wilson, a friend of Steve's, shouted in the hallway, causing people to stare.
"Maybe I can come. If she doesn't mind of course," he suggested, as he pulled into the all familiar parking lot.
After lunch, classes began as normal. Steve was instantly bored again, until it came time for ninth period.
"I'm here!" Tony announced, holding a pizza box in one hand and a bag in the other. He walked in, sitting the pizza box down on the living room table. "Here, put this on." Tony pulled out a blanket from the bag, and wrapped it around Steve, pulling him closer by the ends of the blanket.
"Listen, I've had feelings for you for a while now," Tony started, sitting down beside Steve and holding his hand. "I just..pushed them down, you know? You're too perfect for this world, and even though we argue constantly, I just used that as a coverup."
"Yes, do you know him?" Tony questioned, his curiosity getting to him.
"Sorry about that, Steve. Just wanted to say hi," Sam apologized, rubbing the back of his neck nervously.
Steve stared for a few seconds, but his cheeks flushed a bright pink and he looked down at his shoes.
"Wait!" Tony called after him, and Steve turned around to see what he was fussing about. "Can I have your number?".
"It's C, ok? Just trust me," Tony said, glancing up at Steve. "You do trust me, right?". Steve met his eyes.
New York was alive at night, the flashy lights brighter than ever, making the city's light pollution way more known. The night was getting very interesting for some people..
"Alright, class, tomorrow we will be finishing them with oils or charcoals, and then you may take them home," the teacher told them, before the bell rang. The students rushed out of class, while Steve left the room last, mostly because he was admiring the teacher's work.
"Of course, dear. Well, I'll leave you to it. Love you!" Sarah exclaimed, before hanging up.
"To be honest, I knew you would win," Steve whispered after Tony had collected his winnings. "You usually get your way, don't you?".
"So, Stevie, how's your mom doing?" Tony asked suddenly. Tony would never admit it, but Steve's mom was one of the nicest people he had ever met, besides Steve himself.
"Ooh, speaking of your lover boy, look who finally arrived," Tony chuckled, as the group watched the familiar white haired boy get out of a truck and kiss the driver goodbye.
The New York sunlight gets in Steve's eyes, and he rolls over in bed, pulling the blanket over his head, his toes now peeking out.
"I think we should get it," Ruby said, turning to Sam. "It would be a great home to raise a family in."
Tony turned around, a blank expression on his face. Natasha raised an eyebrow at the two.
"Yes, dear. Believe me, I've heard," Sarah Rogers replied, throwing her carton away. "Now, if you'll excuse me, I got double shift tomorrow, so I'm going to sleep." She quickly left the kitchen, going upstairs to her bedroom.
Steve totally didn’t squeal like a little girl to Sam about that.
Steve giggled, before giving his number to Tony. "Farewell, Romeo," he teased, and if he was swinging his hips more than usual when he was leaving, Steve wasn't going to tell.
"Ugh..." he groaned, sitting up and leaning against his headboard, a loud yawn pouring out of him. Steve stretched his arms, before ruffling his hair and standing up, his sweatpants hanging low on his hips. He went to the bathroom to take a quick shower and to brush his teeth, afterwards changing into a pair of tight jeans and a blue sweatshirt.
"Yes, Tony."
"That's my good boy. Help me up, let's get dried off." Steve helped Tony out of the tub and onto the plush rug, carefully drying him off with warmed towels. He was then led back into the bedroom, where he knelt at the other man's feet once more, waiting for direction. Tony slipped on a robe, tied to loosely, then motioned him back to the living room. "There's food on the table. Fetch it here."
Tony was already dressed, his plate empty, a cup of coffee in hand. When Steve entered, he motioned to a plate and cup waiting on the other side of the table. Steve knelt at his feet so Tony could remove the gag before taking a seat and starting on his breakfast. He stayed silent while he ate, not wanting to push his luck after the most recent punishment. Unusually, so did Tony. He focused on his phone, swiping over the screen idly as he drank his coffee, ignoring Steve. When the plate was empty, Tony motioned him over and refastened the gag.
Steve could feel himself blushing. "Umm... Thank you. I... I don't think I've ever gotten flowers before. They're nice. Come in. I'll try to find a vase or something."
“Good omega.” Tony leaned over Steve’s displayed body and trailed kisses over his chest, letting his goatee scratch over his sensitive skin. Eyes locked with Steve’s his mouth latched onto first one nipple, then the other, teasing them into hard peaks before easing back. Steve groaned, arching off the bed, trying to chase the touch.
Tears streamed from beneath the blindfold. His body was still clenched tight around the piece of ginger, unable to relax as he was pushed through the sensitivity, building towards another orgasm. It felt like it was burning through him, almost cleansing in its intensity, blanking everything else from his mind.
A sharp slap landed on the back of one thigh. “Legs apart. Wide. Show me how much you want it, Steve. Because you do want it, don’t you, baby?”
Steve was struggling in earnest now, uncertain if he was enjoying what was being done to him or desperate to get away. The choice was made for him when Tony replaced his fingers with his cock, thrusting hard while gripping Steve’s hips hard enough to bruise. Holding him in place as Tony chased his own pleasure. It was intense, perfect, and Steve gave himself over to the sensations. Screaming when Tony’s knot locked into place, pressing against his gland and causing him to release each time either of them moved even slightly.
With a small smile, Steve went over and sat down on the loveseat next to Tony. Almost immediately the other man was curling up against his side, shoving a giant bowl of popcorn onto his lap, and rambling a mile a minute about how this was one of the greatest early sci-fi movies, and he was going to love it. Steve shifted slightly as his cock tried to harden at the proximity of the chatty genius and was suppressed. If there was another bonus to wearing a cage, it was that his body wouldn’t be able to betray him around Tony.
"Yeah, sweetheart. Right here." The brunette was packing computer parts into a briefcase, something he only did before leaving. Steve's heart sank. "You have another business trip, don't you."
They took a little longer to admire the works, before Tony led him back to the main area. Steve was content to linger on the edges of the crowd, watch Tony flash smiles, and chat with the guests, charm large donations out of the stingiest patrons. He was in his element here as well, working the crowd for a good cause. Cutting a striking figure in his black tux. He could feel a low simmering arousal just watching this man, knowing that they would go home together that night. That he was the one who would slide the jacket off his shoulders, kiss him, touch him, bring him pleasure.
“You know what to do to end this.” At the frantic shake of Steve’s head, Tony sighed. “Alright then. Up you go. I need you again.”
Tony’s thrusts became harder, brutal. Steve could feel the beginnings of his knot rubbing against his rim. It made his skin burn, his body throb with need. He didn’t understand why his alpha wasn’t letting him have this, was telling him no.
I’d love to hear any theories on who Bucky might have a date with. I promise I’ll tell you if you’re right!
Now, on with the show.
When he came back to himself the machines were gone and he was sitting on the floor, curled into Tony’s lap and clinging to him tightly. He hated the fact that the person doing these terrible things to him was also the only one able to bring him comfort. The scent of evergreen and motor oil was indelibly etched into his memory.
“It’s okay, sweetheart. You take your punishment like a good boy, and all is forgiven. Understand?”
Mumbled begging and pleading fell from Steve’s lips as Tony drove him closer and closer. And then like some miracle, he was there, coming over Tony’s fist as he continued to pump him. The sensation was nothing like what it had been when he was a beta. It felt like burning knives tearing through the inside of his cock and stabbing deep behind his balls. He screamed, struggling against Tony’s grip, trying to make it stop, even as the serum ensured that he remained hard. Steve finally went limp in his arms, feeling weak and helpless as he sobbed into his alpha’s shoulder.
"Good. Now kneel down right here." He helped guide him down onto a cushion facing the foot of the bed before slipping a silk blindfold over his eyes. "I will be monitoring you the entire time, and I can release everything remotely, alright? I always want you safe."
After he’d finished breakfast and drank the rest of his coffee, Steve retrieved the tablet, curling up on the couch. The first thing he looked up on the internet was Tony Stark. There were hundreds of pages. Everything from company press releases to tabloid trash. He stumbled on a video, a clip from some talk show he didn’t recognize, discussing Tony choosing an omega. Steve had expected scathing comments about himself. Instead they seemed more inclined to speculate on how long it would take before Tony screwed it up. Mentions of his playboy past and Stark Industries bloody origins.
Steve tore off his clothes in record time, hoping to buy himself some mercy. Heavy shackles closed over his wrists, holding them crossed, then raising them over his head, high enough that only the balls of his feet were resting on the ground when Tony pressed a button on the wall. He paced around him in a circle, eyes running possessively over his body.
“Yeah. Of course.” He watched the other man carry their dishes to the sink, imagined he could still feel the warmth of Tony’s hand against his skin.
"I said maybe. If you were good."
Tony's lips curved into a sinful smile. "I see. Into the bedroom. Crawl."
The sound of a bottle opening was followed by slick fingers probing deep inside of him. Steve tried to shuffle away from the intrusion, but couldn’t move. One of the fingers pressed deep inside of him, rubbing against a spot high inside his passage. The feeling was uncomfortable, and grew more so as it pressed harder, prying him open. A wave of cramps ran through Steve’s abdomen, and he tried to make his words intelligible, demanding to know what the hell Tony was doing to him. The alpha ignored him, but it didn’t really matter. Steve knew exactly what was happening.
"Yeah. Thank you, Tony..."
He could hear the sound of computer keys over the connection. “Rebellious type? Oh, Tony, you’re too predictable sometimes.”
“It’s just us, Steve. We’re on lockdown. No one’s coming in until I allow it.” He caught Steve’s chin, forcing him to look up. “I’m a possessive man. No one gets to see you like this but me. Alright?”
He begged and pleaded, tears sliding down his cheeks as his desperation grew, the constant denial of release driving his desire higher. A small secret part of him loved it, wanted Tony to control him forever. The increasingly louder voice wanted desperately to come. He could feel his body tensing, the pleasure building higher each time Tony stopped and started working him up again. No matter what Tony asked of him, Steve could only hold off the demands of his body for so long by willpower alone.
Tony watched the struggling submissive, waiting to see if he was going to use his safeword. When it wasn’t forthcoming, he nodded at James to continue. The moment James’ fingers pressed against the sensitive omega gland, Steve let out a high pitched squeal, tears continuing to pour down his cheeks. James’ fingers stayed buried inside of him, small movements indicating he was driving Steve to release simply by rubbing on the gland. This time Tony didn’t even have to warn him. The second Steve began to shudder in pleasure, James removed his fingers, watching with aroused interest as Steve fell apart. Struggling in his bonds, trying to get what he needed to gain the pleasure he was being denied, and shuddering miserably when he failed.
"Tony..." He half-rolled onto his side, burying his face against the older man's leg. His nipples were still sore and throbbing, and he winced when the movement put pressure on them.
“Good boy. If I let you off the board will you behave? Sit and eat dinner without trying to hit me again?”
"Yes Sir."
He nodded, unable to speak around the sudden lump in his throat. Tony was here. He'd take care of him.
Tony flashed him a sharklike grin. “You just leave that up to me. But answer me one question, sweetheart.”
James sank to his knees on the cushion, matching his position to Steve’s. Tony settled on the couch, opening the first box. He took his time, partly to give everyone a chance to relax, and partly because hand feeding three people was an intricate dance that Tony was very new to. He already knew that Steve loved being cared for in that way, the real surprise was James.
“There are currently a few options available. Right this way.”
"Thanks Nat."
Tony smiled at him, making his heart flip over in his chest. As soon as he was released from the restraints, he collapsed off the machine, landing at Tony’s feet. Strong arms lifted him, carrying him into the bedroom, laying him out on the bed. He watched hungrily as his alpha stripped, prowling up the bed and over his body. Steve arched into it when he felt the head of Tony’s cock rub against his sensitive rim, moaning as he pressed inside where he belonged. The smooth glide of flesh felt better filling him than any toy ever could.
For anyone who hasn't seen it, Sense8 is an amazing show that I highly recommend watching if you're a fan of urban fantasy.
"I'm glad. I don't like you feeling badly about yourself, or thinking that there is anything wrong with you. You are everything I could ever want, Steve Rogers." He felt Tony shift slightly, glance over his shoulder at the clock. "It's after midnight. Your day's over."
“No Tony. I told you, there is no going back for me. I’m here. For however long you want me. And if I do ever truly earn forgiveness one day, then I guess I still stay with you. For giving me a chance. For forgiving me. For taking care of me, when I couldn’t do it myself anymore.”
Steve started. He hadn’t even heard the other man come in. Tony gripped his chin, gently but firmly turning him until he could see Steve’s face clearly. “I’m alright. Really. Just… Thinking.”
Tony continued to comfort him as he watched Steve slip the rest of the way under and float away. He held him tight, and placed soft kisses across his face.
“That’s what I thought.” Tony cupped his chin, turning Steve’s face up so he could kiss him, slow and deep, until with a sigh Steve went limp between them. After they broke apart, Tony buried a hand in James’ long hair, holding him still and plundering his mouth until he was shuddering helplessly. Satisfied, Tony slid further down the bed, pulling the blankets carefully over all three of them. “FRIDAY, lights down please.” He let out a pleased sigh as darkness fell around them, tightening his grip on both men. “Good night, my beautiful boys. Sleep well.”
Clint raised his bow, aimed directly at him. "Yeah. They are."
Tony nudged the other man out of the elevator towards Steve. “Go on Tastee Freeze. He’s waiting for you.” He stayed long enough to watch Steve throw his arms around Barnes, hug him tightly before breaking down to sob on his shoulder. Then he pushed the button to close the elevator doors. To take him away to his penthouse or lab. Anywhere but standing alone, watching what he wanted most in the world and would never have again.
“Such a good fucking boy. I think that deserves a reward, don’t you?” Without waiting for an answer, Tony wrapped his arms tightly around Steve’s thighs dragging him back even further. Then the heat of him mouth was pressed against his rim, tongue flicking out against the sensitive skin. Steve cried out, writhing in his grasp, as Tony licked and sucked at his hole, tongue occasionally stabbing into him, the pleasure driving him insane. He felt swamped with it, overwhelmed from every side. Sharp teeth nipped at the sensitive area, and strong arms dragged him back each time he tried to squirm away.
Tony looked amused for reasons Steve didn’t understand. “And what was it you were hoping to find?”
"And I would very much like to continue them. But I can be demanding. And there might be things that I enjoy, that you might not. So, in order for us to keep playing, I need to know that you will tell me if you don't enjoy something we try. Alright?"
Steve curled tighter into a ball, arms wrapping over Tony’s trying to hold onto him. “I just want to be yours. From the first time I met you, I knew. But you didn’t… And I know you’re not… But I’d do anything. Anything. If you’d just let me stay. Here. With you. It’s all I want.”
The cage wasn’t painful, but there was no excess room. It would be impossible for Steve to get hard with it on. He could feel the weight of it tugging at him, a constant reminder of Tony’s absolute control over him. As the pain in his hole dimmed, the denied need of earlier surged back to the forefront, leaving him desperate and aching. His cock tried to twitch in the confines, but was prevented from even the slightest movement. A fresh flood of sobs poured from his raw throat.
Steve wasn’t sure when he fell asleep, barely stirred when Tony lifted him and carried him up to the penthouse. When he finally woke it was early morning. He could see sunrise streaked over the horizon, and feel warm arms wrapped around his waist holding him close. He turned, careful not to wake the other man, so he could study his features in the faint light. The bags under his eyes were darker then ever, and even in sleep his brows were drawn together in a frown. Steve reached up, smoothing his fingers over the lines, hoping to soothe whatever doubts might remain.
"Alright, sweetheart. Just one second. I'll get you all safe and protected. Is that what my sweet boy wants?"
Steve trembled, suddenly feeling very vulnerable. “Yes, alpha. I’m sorry, alpha.”
“Good. Now that you’ve had a chance to think about what you did, we’re going to go ahead with your punishment. If that’s alright with you.”
“Yeah, I’m back. Sorry about earlier…”
Tony laughed, nuzzling into the side of his neck and placing a soft kiss on the bond scar, making Steve shiver. “You’re dangerous, baby. Remind me never to cross you. You know you destroyed Sunset’s reputation to right?”
Steve shrugged. “For the most part. Depends.”
An angled bench rose from the ground, thick padding on the floor around the higher end. Silver manacles gleamed. Steve was pushed to his knees, then bent over the bench, wrists secured to the low edge, leaving his ass propped high. His legs were swept apart, secured both at the ankles and under the knee, keeping him spread wide. "Look at you. So pretty for me. You ready?"
When he was looking for them, the differences were many and obvious. Steve was a daintier eater than Rogers. Taking small delicate bites instead of shoveling food into his mouth as fast as possible. He kept his eyes down, either on his plate or his lap, only meeting Tony’s gaze when he was directed to. Not out of avoidance, but deference. He didn’t swagger around and demand to always have things his own way. Steve was sweet, gentle, and timid. Unbelievably shy, with an adorable blush. And so fucking submissive that Tony’s brain wanted to melt. He had to be the luckiest man in the world. How had it possibly only been a few days?
Steve nodded. “That sounds pretty good.”
Steve cried out as pain lanced through him from the touch, struggling to free himself from his alpha’s grip. “No! Please! It hurts. Tony, it hurts!”
“Yes, Tony.”
Tony pressed deep, fingers rubbing over Steve’s cervix. Instead of the painful sensations the spot had evoked before, this time it sent a wave of painful pleasure rushing through Steve’s body. He released with a cry, the orgasm taking him completely off guard. His passage continued to flutter around Tony’s fingers as he rubbed testing circles against the overly sensitive area. Steve panted and squirmed desperately.
“Thanks.”
I am insanely bored at work today, and time is taking forever to pass. So you get a new chapter! Partly to finish off the previous scene, and mostly because I have no fucking clue what to do with myself today. I hope you enjoy anyway. On with the show!
Steve rushed to do as he was told, only to be instructed to lie on the far side of the bed where he had woken up that morning. His wrists and ankles locked themselves in place without a single touch from his alpha. The lights went out and Tony left the room. Steve laid there, staring into the dark, waiting for Tony to join him. It was late when he finally came back, climbing under the blankets on the other side of the bed without a word and going to sleep.
The rest of dinner was mostly a blur. All Steve could really remember was the darkly amused tone of Tony's voice, the heated look in his eyes, the constant touches and the sweet praise whenever he obeyed one of the orders disguised as a request. When they reached the car, Tony gently guided him into the back of the car, as solicitous as before. However this time, instead of pressing in beside him, as soon as the door closed Tony was straddling Steve's lap and pressing him into the leather seat.
Bruce was at the stove cooking massive amounts of pancakes and bacon for the team. Tony was standing by the coffee maker, two mugs in front of him. As soon as he saw Steve he smiled and brought one of them over to him. “Morning Spangles. Feel good to be home?”
“Yes Boss.”
“You’re going to regret that. But I won’t.” As soon as the elevator stopped, Tony was moving again, dragging Steve with him into a back corner of his workshop. Voice deceptively kind. “You’re gonna help me, honey. I have so many prototypes to test for one of SI’s affiliate companies. We’ll work on them together.” He pressed Steve down onto a stool, and he gasped as the plug was pressed further into him.
“I’m… I’m fine.” Steve’s shoulders curled in tighter, trying to make himself smaller. The last thing he wanted was to make Stark angry. He wanted to make him happy. To live with the team in this tower. To bring the genius coffee and sandwiches when he was buried in his lab. To see him smile and know he was the cause of it. But that would never happen, Steve needed to accept that. Every version of Tony Stark hated every version of him. “I’m sorry… I should leave.”
"You are. So fucking good for me. And I'm so damned mean to you, aren't I?" Steve nodded against his neck. "And you're trying so hard, aren't you?" Another nod. "You're doing so well. You are."
Steve didn’t have time to respond before he felt the slight prick of a needle in the side of his neck. Tony was already setting the syringe aside when he tried to jerk away from him. The tight arm around his shoulders prevented him from moving. This Tony was stronger than the one he’d known, and infinitely more dangerous.
Steve bowed his head. “Thank you, alpha.”
Steve’s body was clenching helplessly around the metal, trying to force it out since he couldn’t move away. It began to expand inside of him with a series of clicking sounds, stretching his hole painfully wide. He squealed, struggling against the shackles, trying to escape from the unrelenting pressure. He realized just how open he was when he felt the cool air of the workshop against his sensitive walls. Another metal strap was fastened over his back, keeping him pinned securely against the bench. “Can’t have you moving, honey. You might hurt yourself in a way I don’t want.”
Strange tried one last time to talk Steve out of his decision, but in the end relented. He opened a portal created from glowing orange lines in front of them. With shoulders straight and head held high, Steve walked through it into his chosen destiny.
“Who the hell are you?” The words burst free before he had a chance to stop them. The man was tall and willowy, with deep auburn hair and dark sunglasses covering his eyes. He was wearing nothing but a pair of jeans so worn they looked like they could fall to pieces at any moment.
Steve gasped, writhing against the other man. “Tony! Tony, please!”
There was a fluttering sensation in his chest. Cautious hope. Maybe this could be real. Maybe he could have this.
"Trust me, it was my pleasure."
Tony pressed a second finger in beside the first, sliding deeper before hooking inside of him, finding Bucky’s prostate and beginning to rub against it furiously. He had to hold back a scream, cock jumping inside the cage. He sucked the cock in his mouth fiercely, feeling Steve bury his hands in his hair, trying to pull him away, sobbing from oversensitivity, but still pulsing on Bucky’s tongue. He could feel the orgasm building low in his gut, terrifying in it’s intensity. His body had been denied for over seventy years, but Tony was pulling it out of him in a matter of minutes.
“No. I designed this for… You know what? Doesn’t matter. I’ve got a better idea. Come on. Back upstairs.” Tony shooed him back into the elevator, had FRIDAY carry them up to the penthouse again. Logic would say that he should leave Steve to his own devices. Let him settle in downstairs, alone. But somehow he knew that was the wrong thing to do. This Steve would never argue with him. Never tell him no. He’d have to watch him closely. Be so careful with him.
Slight update to this chapter, I realized some things weren’t working in this story the way they should. Hopefully that’ll lead to sooner updates on this story.
"Thank you, Tony."
“Thank you, Tony. Just… Thank you.”
“That’s the one. Only the best for you, honey. Everything you’re wearing was built for you with my own two hands.”
"Good." Tony wrapped the chain from the clamps around his hand, holding it taut. "Come for me."
“Yes Tony.”
"Yeah, I know. I never promised to be nice to you, baby."
“And what are you being punished for again?”
He tried to shake his head, couldn’t. “No. I was fine before. I was happy. You people took that away from me. My family. My friends. Now you’re taking my freedom, even my body, away from me!”
"My good fucking boy. So pretty for me in his silk panties." His fingers slid between his cheeks, pressing and rubbing over Steve's sensitive hole through the silk making him whimper and writhe.
Steve turned his face away, but not before Tony caught the glimmer of tears in his eyes. “‘S not true.”
Tony gently pressed him back onto the bed, and Steve relaxed enough to let him, closing his eyes to focus on the rough whisper of his lover’s voice instead of the voice in his head insisting that he couldn't have this anymore.
“Twenty eight, Boss.”
A variety of sounds came from behind Steve, soft clinks of metal, the whisper of fabric, all designed to confuse him on what was going to happen next. He heard the soft snap of latex before he felt a gloved finger rub softly over his entrance then disappear. He let out a shaky breath, trying to figure out what Tony was going to do to him next.
Steve had never been on a private plane like Tony's before. They spent most of the flight curled up together eating snacks, watching movies, and talking. A limousine was waiting at the airport to take them to a ridiculously luxurious room in one of the best hotels. They had time to themselves the first night, which Tony took advantage of by stripping Steve down and making love to him on the rug in front of the fireplace.
The blue police box (or TARDIS) outside the Earl's Court tube station and was built by the London Underground. It's a real destination for Doctor Who fans, which I imagine is something that Tony would have introduced Steve to. Honestly, if I was as talented as Tony Stark, I would have tried to build my own sonic screwdriver by now!
Two chapters in one day? What?! Hope you enjoy, and have a good weekend!
When he came back to himself, Tony was still draped on top of him, pinning him to the bed. Gentle kisses were being pressed against his neck and shoulder. Steve wrapped his arms around him tightly, unable to do more than cling to him and tremble.
“You deserved it, my little minx. I’m guessing tonight wasn’t the last of it.”
"Good. Let's get your punishment out of the way so you can go back to being my good boy."
“Yes, Tony.”
"Truly...?" Loki's voice was quiet and small, coming from the shadows surrounding the doorway to the roof. Bruce was a protective presence just behind him.
"Considering Bruce's reaction, I'm guessing I'm not going to like it." Tony stopped, mulling it over for a moment. "It would be useful to have a magic user that's more dependable than Strange. Not that that's hard. We could sell it that way to SHEILD. That he was mind-controlled and is now working with the Avengers to make amends. Pep could get a good spin on it for the press. She can make the public love just about anyone..."
Steve struggled harder against the restraints, straining against the metal in the hopes of breaking it. Not only did it hold firm, but the cage contracted tightly around him once more, making him scream from a combination of pain and frustration. Tony’s eyes were glowing a blinding electric blue as he controlled his tech with nothing but his thoughts, and by extension, Steve as well. When he stopped fighting, the extra tension on the cage relented, and he let out a sigh of relief.
“Of course.”
"Hey, tell me what's wrong." Firm fingers tilted his chin up, forcing him to meet steady brown eyes.
"Nine days!"
He’d gone to the kitchen for something to eat one night. The door to their bedroom had been cracked when he returned. Carelessly. But Stark was never careless. He moved closer, making sure to avoid the golden spill of light from the room, peering through the crack. Steve was on the bed, on his knees, wrists bound with crimson rope to the headboard. Stark was kneeling behind him, cock buried in Steve’s body. Even as Bucky watched, Steve began to lose control, trembling on the edge of orgasm. Stark drew back, until only the head was still inside. Holding there with iron control, until Steve let out a miserable whine, pulled back from the edge. Only then did he start moving again. It was a beautiful and erotic dance.
“Yeah? JARVIS said you went to the doctor today.” Tony’s hand slid down to press against the plug buried inside Steve’s hole. They’d learned early on that he needed to be filled to feel claimed. Since then Tony had started plugging him each morning. It made it a lot easier to stay calm. He’d picked a large one for the day, it’s girth stretching Steve’s rim with every move, and the added pressure made his knees wobble dangerously.
Steve nodded, the gag muffling the first sob. Tony released his grip, stepping away long enough to retrieve a large syringe. He knelt behind Steve, gripping the back of his neck and pressing him down until he was bent over, forehead resting against the mat. Steve felt the collar shift around his neck, a small extension emerging to attach to another ring on the floor, holding him in place. He yelled as loud as he could when he felt the needle pierce the skin behind his cock, the rush of liquid burning as it was injected into him.
I'm back again! Cell biology is frustrating as hell, so instead, have a bright shiny new chapter. This was a popular request that I thought would work out well with the boys. I hope you enjoy. Comments brighten my day, and I always respond. Now, onto the story!
“You’re twitchy.”
"You do. I..." He paused.
"Okay Tony..." He mumbled, relaxing further into the mattress.
And then Tony was talking to him again in that dark mocking voice that sent shudders through his body, made him desperate to please, to obey. "Look at you. So close. So pretty. You'd promise me anything right about now, if I'd just make it stop, wouldn't you? If I'd just unlock your pretty little cock and let you come."
“Black or with cream and sugar?”
Whimpers and cries poured out of Steve's mouth as he begged him to have mercy, to make it stop, to never stop. It felt like his entire body was on fire, and he desperately thrust into the air hoping for any kind of relief. He couldn't hold still. He couldn't get free. He hung there, suspended in pleasure and agony, body no longer under his control.
, and then the sound of the wind whistling in my ears.
I sigh, but crawl in on Clint’s other side. His hand rests on my waist, just over the scars, and there’s part of me that’s freaking out, but there’s still another part that whispers
I guess leaving really was selfish.
“What’s Uncle Clint told you about jumping on the furniture?” I admonish. Lila wriggles around, giggling, and I let her down, placing her beside me on the couch.
"No, not until he tells me what the fuck he means by that!" I yell back, rounding on Zola. The computer simply smiles.
“Fantastic,” I mutter, bringing my arms up to shield the rest of my face. I lean forwards a bit and bend my legs, before unfurling and crashing out the window. “Care to point me in the right direction?”
"Telling you would take away the fun, wouldn't it?" the computer says in a falsely jovial tone. Steve's face is blank and expressionless, but his blue eyes are cold and flinty glaciers.
“The relays are intact,” Cap yells. “What’s our next move?”
"Any demands?" Steve asks.
"Aaaand that mission was?"
“Huh. I guess I have.” Maria rolls her eyes, pulling me into a one-armed hug.
“It’s the world internet hub in Oslo, every byte of data flows through there, fastest access on earth,” Bruce explains, pushing himself off the wall he was leaning against and walking towards the table.
A cold metal hand closes around my ankle, swinging me around and off of the truck. I spin ass over tit in midair before readjusting, whip still clenched in my hand.
“I’m glad you asked that, because I wanted to take this time to explain my evil plan.”
I cock an eyebrow as I take in Tony’s appearance. If I didn’t know better and saw him walking down the street in this state, I’d put my life savings on him being a hobo. His hair is sticking out in all directions, grease and oil streaking through it. His facial hair is looking less like a carefully-sculpted goatee and more like a developing bread. His face is smeared with some dirt-like substance and oil is smeared just under his right eye. His eyes are bloodshot and have a sort of maniacal glint to them. He’s wearing a white tank top, but the bottom is ripped and torn, the rips giving away the fact that they were caught on something sharp and ripped away carelessly. His feet are bare, and the sweatpants are covered in even more grease and oil.
I turn, adding more force to my kick with the momentum, foot lashing out and making contact with the shield. Ultron flies back when the shield makes contact, and the latter of the two rebounds back to Steve. More jets of orange energy are blasted our way, and I take a few of them with little repercussion.
An hour later, I'm sitting against the wall, Steve and Clint standing on either side of me. Natasha stands next to Nick's body, blocking his face from view.
~~~~~
Inside, the lab is fucked the hell up. Sparks fly from broken, exposed wires, some of them fizzling out as they land on my jacket. Steve makes a beeline to the end of the room, where Helen Cho herself is propped up against their wall.
Their remains crash to the ground below, and then two others shoot out too fast for me to shoot at.
“Not dead, exactly,” I point out, twirling a pen around like a drumstick. I’m perched on one of the lab tables, which is probably neither sanitary or safe, but I just kicked robot ass, so I think everyone will let it slide. “He took it to the next level. Said he wanted us extinct.”
Lunging across the top of the truck, I switch direction mid-jump, veering off to the right and flinging my whip out. It loops around Ultron’s neck, and I quickly grab the other end and
I grin, bending down to plant two quick kisses on their foreheads, one hand moving independently to get my last spare dampener on my wrist.
"Stop lying—"
"Stark, we got him," Steve says into his comm. "Banner, just like you said." My radio crackles.
“Zola,” I say, tucking my legs up underneath me. “I… I dunno, but—“
“Little fucking shit, I swear I’m going to disable—wonder girl?”
Which is to say, weird as fuck.
I salute the supersoldier jokingly before jogging towards the door that leads down into the belly of the ship.
The four of us exchange looks.
“I should probably look into that once my decryption program finishes breaking into all of SHIELD’s secure files,” Stark says idly, moving out from behind the table. My gaze snaps to the billionaire, and I silently thank my paranoia. The rest of the team can
“That man is playing Galaga,” the playboy suddenly says, pointing to one of the techs. “Thought we wouldn’t notice, but we did.” A pause in which Stark covers one eye and surveys the screens. “How does Fury even see these?” I roll my eyes.
“He also said he killed somebody,” Clint adds.
“Ooh, do they still have the spinning chairs?” I mutter out of the corner of my mouth. Phil smirks.
“Shit,” I mutter. A STRIKE agent grips me by the back of the jacket, yanking me upright and pushing me onto one of the benches beside Steve. The supersoldier is staring down at his feet, blue eyes lost and almost scared.
“You think this is funny?” Thor half-roars, taking a few threatening steps towards Tony.
"You all right, Cam?" the supersoldier asks, brow furrowed. I frown.
The kettle whistles from the kitchen, and I swear when I bang my head against the metal walls of the vents.
"It was not my first kiss since 1945," Steve sighs. "I'm 95, not dead."
"Picking up the living fossil so that he's on time for the briefing," the spy replies, turning.
Still, we'd apprehended Batroc, but it wasn't Steve. It was Clint, because the bastard had doubled back before I reached him and Batroc was running his way. Neither Nat nor Steve had told us why Batroc had gotten away, but I think that it has something to do with the looks that are ping-ponging back and forth between the two of them.
"Dude, if your wife kicked you out then I don't think I want to meet her," Clint says, crossing his arms, arrow tucked under one arm. We both know that Nick isn't married.
"And I think I do too," she replies. The phone clicks and Steve's voice comes through.
“Just find the cube,” he throws over his shoulder.
Clint rubs his wrist, giving me a kicked-puppy look that I swear Lucky learnt from him.
On the other hand, Wanda Maximoff is an easy fix. If her mind fuckery is linked to the sceptre, there’s a high likelihood her mojo won’t to jackshit to me. Still, might do me some good to stay away from her. What does intrigue me, however, is if I touched either of the Maximoffs, would their powers disappear? Or was it different, now that the energy from the sceptre was a part of them, not the weapon itself?
The whole contraption lurches sickeningly, and Pietro and I go sliding into one of the benches lining the aisle.
"What is it?" Clint asks, taking a step forwards.
Maria.
Dark room. A shooting range, I think. The Winter Soldier stares at me from across the room.
“He wasn’t always like that,” Steve says. And. Oh
Steve and Tony take the first showers while Nat and I dig through the cluttered cupboards.
“Wow, this is so cool,” I gush to Nat. “When did they launch this? I should’ve stayed for that. Do you think the vents are big enough to get through? Phil better not’ve welded them all shut again. They were such a pain to rip off the walls, and Maria got pissed when Clint and I…” I trail off, mind flashing through all of the memories from my time at SHIELD.
I send a sharp glance at the back of the pilot’s chair, moving forwards quietly.
“If Ultron is really building a body…”
It’s gone as quick as it came, and the Soldier turns and walks away, grabbing his gun as he does.
And then I see the flames. The jet is falling out of the sky, left wing on fire. Flashes of red and green tell me that Loki and Thor are still fighting. The jet begins to turn away, and I heave a sigh of relief. It's veering around buildings, and the trail of smoke doesn't make it that hard to find.
Metal glints in the sun.
“I think we both noticed,” I groan, bracing my hands against the solid, unforgiving steel of the massive flying base.
"How about a friend?" All three of us spies and assassins snort.
"Targets acquired," Rumlow says.
The whole thing glows red before it detaches, and I shove it in my pocket, swapping the whip to my other hand, the one with a bracelet around the wrist. There should be an alert that pops up on Clint’s phone that tells him that I took the bracelet off, which means we need help.
“Shit!” he yells, just as the weight on the roof disappears and the car lurches forwards, propelled by the one behind us. Another hit and the car runs up against the inner barrier. There’s a loud crash, and crane my neck to see Steve ramming his shield against the passenger side door. Nat has her gun.
"This is the hard drive that I gave to Nick after we got back from the Lemurian Star," she says, brow furrowed.
Taking the opportunity, I speed out from under the bridge, whip arcing out and catching one of the men at the edge of the bridge, yanking him over and releasing him as he topples to the ground below.
Natasha pounces with the explosion, leaping onto the hood of the car and landing on the Winter Soldier’s shoulders. I slip my whip out with the hand attached to the wrist with no bracelet, lunging forwards and whipping it around to snare the Soldier’s feet.
~~~~~
“Hey, you’re talking about me now,” Clint says pouting. “C’mon, I know Katie-Kat wants to talk to me.”
“Not a great plan,” I deadpan. “Did I mention the guy with anger issues? I did, right?” Tony smirks minutely as he walks out from behind the bar, scotch held in one hand.
"Prove it," Steve commands, snapping me out of... whatever that was. Zola's face flickers back on.
There's a quiet splash behind me, and I peer over the side of the ship. Steve waves at me from below. It only takes about thirty seconds for him to climb up the massive chain anchoring the Lemurian Star. As soon as he's up on deck, I take off running. Turning the corner, I see two more guards crumpled on the deck, arrows poking out of their chests. Tranqs, because Captain America was on this op.
"No, I didn't," Natasha insists as I fix Clint's legs and search for the worksheet that I was in the middle of completing. "I just wondered how much practice you've had."
"And there's Tony's dickbag dad," Clint mutters, peering at a photo of Howard Stark, which is directly next to that of Peggy Carter's.
“He killed eighty people in two days,” I supply.
“Yes, he is, but he’s not making any headway.”
"Whatever he gave you," the redhead snaps. I glance around.
"You will all fall before me,” he growls. I hum. Not gonna lie, he’d be pretty hot if he wasn’t trying to take over the world. But then Loki throws Tony out the window, with a final shout that I don’t quite hear. My jaw drops, and I hurry over to the broken window. The sound of rocket boosters makes me whirl in surprise, and it’s only instinct that has me moving out of the way of something big and red and metal.
Why don’t you go find out?
“What, did you stop for drive-thru or something?” I hear Tony snark.
"About time you showed up," I say, leaning against an overturned car. Banner simply shrugs as everyone heads over to where he stands, hands in his pockets.
"Hey, fellas," Natasha calls after rolling down her window. "Either one of you know where the Smithsonian is? I'm here to pick up a fossil."
"You said nine minutes," Steve mutters. "Come on."
“Demetrius Hinojosa, but I go by Cam," I say. "You might also know me as the Black Lynx.” Rogers' eyes widen for a moment, obviously over his previous shock, and he leans forward in his chair.
“Why’d you come back?” he asks. “Really.” I squeeze my eyes shut tight.
Both of us shoot to our feet, concealed weapons at the ready in the blink of an eye—but then my eyes register that that hunched-over form is familiar, and I lower my knife.
“I’m waking up more often,” I begin gently. “There’s always something new in my head when I do.”
“Drop the shield, Cap!” Rumlow shouts, gun pointed at the very center of Steve’s chest. “Get on your knees!” He advances forwards. “Get on your knees!” I raise my hands above my head warily, eyes narrowed at the approaching people.
Out of the three of us who live at the Tower full-time and the other three who tend to drop in, only Nat, Bruce and I have the ability to cook something other than eggs. Steve, of course, isn’t allowed within twenty yards of the kitchen after the time he burnt water and almost managed to blow up the kitchen. Clint doesn’t quite know how to operate anything other than the coffee machine, the toaster and the microwave when something needs to be reheated, and even then there’s a 95% chance he’ll make something explode if he isn’t using the coffeemaker. Tony either orders something from a nearby takeout place or doesn’t eat for days on account of being locked down in his lab.
“But I’m not even the Steve who did that to you!”
It seemed like forever ago that they had found each other through SHEILD’s meddling. Steve didn’t miss the constant anxiety that went along with always feeling lacking, as though he would be abandoned at any moment. Tony had been relentless and incredibly patient, forcing Steve to accept that his affections were true, as well as give into the needs of his own body.
Steve whimpered, curling into Tony in search of comfort, the plug shifting inside him and tugging at his rim with every move he made. Tony wrapped his arms around Steve, holding him close and gently rubbing his back. “But that’s not going to be a problem, is it? Because you’re never going to leave me, are you Steve?”
"No. I told you, we have plans for tonight." A metal plug was pressed into him, thick and just long enough to rub against that sensitive spot. A leather harness was then buckled around his hips and thighs, holding it tightly in place. "There you go. Now, turn around and sit on the bed for me."
"I'll tell you what. If you can make it back to the bedroom before I do, without dropping the plug again, I'll let you come. If not, I have something new I want to play with. Sound fair?"
“Perfect, Steve. Look at you. So desperate and needy. I’m going to make you my perfect little slut.” He pulled away, moving back to his workbench, leaving Steve shaking on the floor behind him. When he returned, Tony was holding a small pistol shaped object with a long barrel. Steve vaguely recognized it as the device Tony had used to implant the sensors for the suit under his skin. A feeling of foreboding began to roll through him as Tony stepped behind him. He felt even more exposed than before.
A low mechanic humming started, followed by a slick length stroking into him, drawing back, then pressing forward again. A slow steady rhythm. Tony moved into his line of sight, kneeling next to him. "Do you like it, sweetheart? I built it for you."
The trouble with finally being happy, with getting what he needed from another person rather than in hidden moments he stole for himself, was that Steve’s change in behavior did not go unnoticed. Especially when living in Avenger’s tower surrounded by super spies and heroes. It was just a matter of waiting to see who was going to try to talk to him first.
“I’m sorry, sweetheart. I really am. This is the best way to get it to give. And you need this, Steve. You just have to trust me. I know you can do this. And at the moment? You don’t really have a choice.” Tony settled against the headboard beside him, settling the tablet on his lap and sipping his coffee. He gave Steve a chance to get used to the pressure before turning the vibrator on.
Tony walked to the doorway, turning back to gaze at his helpless omega, bound and at his mercy. With a thought he flipped the sybian to the lowest setting, reaching down to squeeze his cock at the resultant cries of pleasure.  Taking a breath, he forced himself to turn and walk away.  He could monitor Steve from the lab. He had work to do, and Steve had a long day ahead of him.
“I promise. You want to keep your alpha’s come, don’t you?” Steve sniffled and nodded hesitantly. “Good boy.” Tony moved quickly, retrieving a mid sized plug and gently sliding it into Steve’s waiting body. Once it was settled, he lifted the omega into his arms. “See? All better. And breakfast is waiting for us. We can eat together. Won’t that be nice?”
He nodded again. "Yes."
However, it was also the perfect opportunity to get a little of his own back. Steve knew exactly which moans meant that Tony was getting close to the edge, and drew back, lapping at the head of his cock softly, teasing him with a small portion of the treatment Steve was regularly rewarded with at his hands. He found every sensitive spot, torturing him with pleasure, before finally swallowing him down, moaning as he came down his throat.
Tony kissed him softly. “Anything you want, sweetheart. You know that. So, what’s his name going to be?”
“I can’t even get hard, Tony! I can’t come! I can’t do anything right! I’m broken.”
“Hey!” Tony gestured with his fork in mock outrage. “I’ll have you know I can be very nice to sweet little omegas who deserve it.”
He was saved from further consideration by the sound of the elevator. Tony walked out, the picture of calm. His tie was loose around his neck, drawing Steve's attention and bringing a flush to his cheeks as he remembered the sensation of silk wrapped around his wrists that afternoon.
"Hey, Tony..." He hadn't meant to wake him. Steve had no idea what to do now. His earlier plans had evaporated as soon as he saw Tony asleep on the couch.
“M-mad?”
"I know you do. Which is why we're going to have so much fun tonight. Stand up. Strip for me. Fold your clothes on the chair."
“Thanks. So what’s the plan for today?”
Steve, having experienced Tony’s games before, immediately shook his head. James studied him for a moment, head tilted quizzically to the side. A slow smile spread over his face, beautiful and just a little bit wicked, causing Tony to immediately harden in his pants. “Sure alpha, I’d love to play a game.”
"Bedroom?"
Tony had never thought he could feel anything for any version of Steve Rogers. But the man lying beside him was so kind and gentle, so willing to lay his heart at Tony’s feet and wait to see what came next. If he’d be comforted and accepted or kicked to the curb. There was an inherent sweetness to this man. James saw it too, if the shy shadowing of Steve since his arrival was any indication. Steve made Tony want to wrap him in blankets and keep him safe. But that same vulnerability also made him want to tie Steve to the bed and torment him with pleasure until he was screaming and begging for it to end. Wreck him so perfectly and thoroughly that no one could ever satisfy him again.
Steve moved immediately, taking the desired position. He was rewarded with metal wrapping around his wrists, securing them to the headboard. He tugged at the restraints for a moment, knowing that he couldn't break free, enjoying the ability to struggle, not having to hold himself back.
“What’s wrong with me…?”
"What do you think, baby? Nice and secure. And not a single thing for that desperate little cock of yours to rub up against. The only thing you're getting is what I decide to give you."
“That’s not fair!”
Tony hid a smile at the banter between the two, not so secretly adoring the way they played off of each other. “What do you think, James? Do you want to give poor Steve a break and please yourself for a little bit? Or tease him a little longer?”
“Oh sweetheart…” Tony sighed. “Look at me. Please?” He gently guided Steve’s tear streaked face away from his neck, tilting his chin so they could look at each other. “I… I made some mistakes lately. And I’m sorry. You deserve to know what happened. If for no other reason than I treated you so badly.”
He forced himself out of bed and into the shower, cleaned himself as fast as possible, not wanting to linger on thoughts of his body. Afterwards Steve headed to the training floor. It was usually a good place to distract himself from his thoughts.
"You're down pretty deep, aren't you baby? It's okay, come on, we're just going into the bedroom."
“You can try, sweetheart. I do love a challenge. But at the end of the day? You will belong to me.” He slowly walked back behind Steve, fingers tracing over his skin, running down his spine. All he could do was tense his muscles, unable to jerk away from the touch.
Steve wasn’t sure why he stayed on his knees before the other man. Maybe it was the power of Tony’s personality filling the air around them, or maybe it seemed the appropriate place for a supplicant to be. Either way, he made no effort to gain his feet. “I am Steve Rogers. Just not… Your Steve Rogers. Where I’m from…” He paused, struggling to find a way to describe what he’d already been through. Realizing it was impossible, he shook his head and continued. “A lot of things happened. Most of them, I felt responsible for. I still do. And there was no longer a place for me there. I can’t be who they want me to anymore. Steven Strange helped me find what I was looking for, and opened a portal for me. This is where I want to be.”
“That’s the second time you’ve called me that. What does it mean in your world?”
“Then this is what we need to do.” Tony rubbed a gentle fingertip over Steve’s lower lip. “But it doesn’t have to be so mean. If you’d stop fighting me all the time, we could do it a different way. Nicer. Make it feel good. How would that be?”
So now Steve was wandering around New York City, alone and vulnerable, with nowhere to go and no one to help him. He let the crowds carry him down to the subway for lack of a better direction. After several hours, he finally got off at a random stop, wanting to at least be moving under his own power for a while. He wasn’t certain where he was, but he also didn’t know if that mattered. Wasn’t one place as good as any right now?
That blurry, dreamy feeling had intensified. "Thank you, Tony."
Gentle hands gripped his bicep, urging him to his feet. “C’mon Buck. It’ll be alright. I’ve got you.” He allowed Steve to lead him down the hall and into a bedroom. He stood there, passive and shivering as Steve stripped him of his uniform. Dressed him in thin sleep pants and an oversized sweatshirt. Both items so soft to the touch that he could barely believe they were real. Steve guided him towards the bed, piled high with blankets and pillows. Various textures, but all soft and inviting. He climbed into the center of the bed, surrounded on all sides by a wall of pillows. Steve followed, curling around his back, holding him close and tucking his nose against the back of Bucky’s neck.
“Yes, alpha.” Steve was expecting a hard palm to land on his offered ass or thighs. Instead two fingers smacked down firmly against his exposed hole. It barely stung, even after Tony repeated the strike several times in a row. But Steve felt tears slide down his face regardless. His entrance burned and stung under Tony’s fingers, the sensations heightened after his glands had been so thoroughly worked earlier. It was terrible and overwhelming. And somehow still made him want to come. Or release. Or whatever it was that his body did now.
Steve bowed his head and disappeared into the bathroom. When he returned several minutes later, Tony was sprawled on the couch with another thick red cushion on the floor in front of him. It took no prompting this time for Steve to slide to his knees like he had in the other man's office. He felt fingers tangle in his hair, smoothing it back from his face.
His eyes lit up, shining with mischief. “Absolutely.”
He blinked a few times, head tilted to the side, studying Steve like he was a new and interesting problem to figure out. "You're welcome. But that's not all of it, is it? Come on, out with it. What else did you want to say? Gonna tell me to stop buying stuff for you?"
“Good boy. You did so well today. I know that was hard. Tomorrow will be better. I promise.”
When they’d finished eating, Tony studied him over the rim of his coffee mug. “What?” The word came out a little harsher than Steve had intended.
Bucky nodded again, feeling the heat of Tony’s body moving away. When he returned, Bucky felt an ice pack pressed firmly along the underside of his cock. The cold burned, and he cried out helplessly, struggling within Steve’s tight grip, but Steve held him firm with absolute trust in Tony that he would do what was needed. Bucky’s cock throbbed in agony, the chill slowly seeping into the flesh, numbness spreading. His erection slowly wilted, and he felt a surge of relief that he no longer had to deal with that hard awkward thing attached to him. Bucky’s muscles relaxed as the cold continued to spread beneath Tony’s capable hands until his cock had softened completely. Only then was the ice pack removed. Bucky gulped in huge breaths, felt Tony rub his back, soothing him.
And because insomnia is still strong with this one... You get yet another chapter! Enjoy! Comments and requests are welcomed and loved.
“It hurts… Tony, it hurts.”
“I… I didn’t…”
After putting in an order with JARVIS for breakfast, he began trailing gentle kisses over Steve’s face. The omega only sighed in his sleep. Apparently he was a heavier sleeper than Tony had realized. Feeling mischievous, probably from the abrupt crash of the panic high he’d been riding for days, Tony decided to see just how far he could push things before the other man woke. And he wanted Steve, at least one more time, just like this. With that in mind, he began placing soft kisses down the long line of Steve’s neck, over the claiming scar, and across his shoulder. Steve let out a soft sound, almost a whimper, when Tony’s mouth brushed the bite, but otherwise his breathing stayed slow and even.
The material rubbed over Steve’s skin like a caress, making his stomach tighten with desire. The unfulfilled need from the day before seemed to flood back into him, especially when Tony’s clever hands began sliding over his body. Teasing over his bond mark, sending shivers down Steve’s spine. Sliding down his chest to knead at his pecs before flicking his thumbs over hardening nipples. Steve’s eyes fell closed as he arched forward, offering himself to his mate.
Desperate tears slid down Steve’s face. He dropped to his knees, burrowing against Tony’s thigh, clinging to him. “I’m sorry! Please! I don’t know what I did wrong… Please don’t leave me, alpha. I’ll do better. I promise, I’ll do better!”
Tony turned away from the monitor, wincing at the motion and pressing a hand against his wrapped ribs. So Captain America and his shadow were safely in Wakanda. How nice for them. For all the Rogues really. To have a safe place and trusted people to take care of them. He shouldn’t care. It’s wasn’t as though any of them had wasted a thought on how Tony would survive a broken suit in Siberia, or how he would make it back to New York. If he’d make it back…
"I know." He smiled. "I want you to be mine. I want to own you."
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve fumbled for his cell, knowing immediately who the text would be from.
By the time Tony returned, Steve was lost to a haze of unrelenting desire. Even the gentle touch of skin against his as Tony released the restraints had Steve moaning and arching. He could hear the other man speaking, but it took effort to focus on the meaning of the words. He tried to listen, but lost most of what was said.
The water drained from the tub as Tony got them both to their feet and dried them off with warmed towels. He guided Steve to the bed and gently settled him beneath the blankets before sliding in against his back, arms wrapped tightly around him, holding him close.
“I’m not like you, sweetheart. I’ve got a little more than a glorified clit between my legs.” Tony ignored the gasp of outrage and continued. “Besides, I think you’ve gotten a little too used to rubbing on it whenever you want. Need to train you out of that.”
“I do trust you, Tony.”
"Sure." Steve stumbled to the bathroom, splashing water on his face to wake up fully. He finished his morning routine quickly, curious about what Tony was planning, and made his way down the hallway to the other room.
James dragged his eyes open, fighting down the arousal to allow himself to think more clearly, gaze running over Steve’s body. Checking for signs that it was too much. That he really couldn’t handle it. Finally he shook his head. “He’s fine. He can take it. Just doesn’t wanna. Probably hopin’ we’ll take pity on him an’ let him come.”
Gentle fingers brushing his cheek pulled him from his thoughts, and he offered Tony a tentative smile. “Ready, my beautiful omega?”
Almost done with my semester, which means a lot more free time on my hands, which may translate to me spending more time writing. No guarantees, but I'm aiming for a chapter a week. I hope you enjoy. All comments and requests are welcome. No promises that I'll use every request, but I will consider them.
"Well, we also talked a little about some of the other stuff we've been doing. Not in detail, but she sent me some websites to look at."
“Alright honey. You did earn it, after all. Looks like you’re still up, Steve.” Tony stood in front of him this time, wanting to see the agonized expression on his face. Slid a hand between his legs, fingers sliding easily into Steve’s slick entrance. Steve moaned when Tony began rubbing over his glands, letting the feeling roll through him and quickly building to another release. Again, as soon as Steve began to clench around him, Tony slid his fingers free, leaving him to struggle against the restraints as the pleasure was yanked from his grasp.
Steve struggled against the restraints again, hips grinding back against the sheets then thrusting up into the air, desperately seeking friction on his hole or his cock and receiving neither. He could feel Tony’s eyes on him, enjoying the sight of his omega being tormented with pleasure rather than pain.
He did notice improvements in his health starting from the moment he bonded with Tony. It was easier to sleep through the night, especially with the warmth of his alpha curled against his back. His neck was no longer constantly stiff, and the pain in his chest that he had grown accustomed to was gone. Steve’s entire body felt lighter and looser. However, the more time they spent being intimate, the higher his libido seemed to soar. Feeling needy and desperate was starting to become a baseline for him, and each time Tony buried himself deep in Steve’s body, his cock struggled valiantly in it’s confines.
He needed to come so badly, really come, not the unsatisfying untouched one that left him feeling so twisted up inside. And now he couldn't. Not until Tony let him. Until Tony unlocked the cage again. He whimpered, hips rolling into the air, chasing any hint of sensation, any lingering bits of pleasure.
“Saving yourself for me? What a good boy. But I believe the plan was to start with a punishment. That is what you asked for, after all. And what kind of master would I be if I denied you that? But I can’t start off too hard. I don’t know how much you can take. Yet.” He moved to stand beside the bed in Steve’s line of sight, held out a slim leather crop. “Do you know what this is, Steve?”
"Yes, Captain."
“Absolutely.”
“Oh honey…” Tony tightened his arms around Steve, keeping him close. “I’m sorry I was so late. There was a charity gala I had to go to tonight. I was on my way here when I got the message from JARVIS. Did you think I wasn’t coming back?” Steve nodded hesitantly. “Sweetheart… Even if I’m mad at you, even if you’re in trouble, I will always come home.”
Stark tilted his head, studying him carefully. As though he could see straight into the core of him. “What are you sorry for, Barnes?”
“Oh, I’m sorry sweetheart. That’s right, you don’t want me touching you there. You want me touching you here, right?” His hand slid down over Steve’s side, before gripping his cock, starting a quick rhythm. Steve struggled not to scream as equal amounts of pleasure and agony washed over him. His body didn’t know whether to move into the touch or get away, his hips roughly jerking back and forth. And still Tony didn’t stop. He kept stroking, building him higher. Patient.
“I guarantee they are exactly as they say. You are perfectly safe, Captain.”
It didn’t take long for Steve’s body to begin throbbing with need, his passage growing slick around the plug. Tony gripped the base, sliding it free, replacing it with his mouth. Steve moaned, pressing back into the feel of warm breath and a hot tongue moving over his entrance. He was already so worked up, combined with the enhancement drug, he was releasing in moments, crying out in satisfaction. The assault on his hole never let up, Tony’s tongue dancing around the delicate skin, occasionally dipping inside to brush over his slick glands. Building Steve up to another shattering release.
"You would... Protect me? From Asgard? As simple as that?"
They were quiet for a long time, neither one willing to end the moment. Eventually Steve forced himself to pull away. The refusal to appear weak or needy was too deeply ingrained. Tony nodded, slowly standing and helping Steve to his feet. “I spoke to Bruce earlier, they should be here sometime after lunch.”
When the elevator doors opened, he stumbled out, falling to the ground on his knees. Tony was leaning against a workbench, eyes glowing electric blue. “Hey baby doll. I knew you’d come down to see me eventually.”
There was silence for a moment, Steve could almost imagine Tony's eyes glowing a bright vivid blue, followed by a soft humming from both sides. A sharp electric shock to the head of his cock jerked him back against the plug behind him. As soon as it was fully seated inside of him it began vibrating hard against his prostate.
“Absolutely.” He accepted the mug and took a sip. Tony knew the way each Avenger preferred their coffee. He always fixed Steve’s a little sweet with plenty of cream and a hint of vanilla. “Thanks Tony.”
“Okay. We can do this one of two ways. I’m going to take the ring off. I can either make you come again.” Steve’s eyes widened in panic. “Or, I can give you a small shot that will make you go soft. That way I can get you all locked away and safe.”
Just a warning, there are clinical mentions of medical conditions and disorders in this chapter. I tried to keep them non-descriptive, and it is generic mentions not any of the characters in our story suffering from them. I’ll put a description of the chapter as well as the references in the end notes, so anyone who is unsure can decide from there. Otherwise, I hope you enjoy!
I’d love to hear your thoughts in the comments. Thank you.
"No. Some people don't like that. But you do. Don't you Steve?"
Tony had mercy on him this time, steadily stroking him until he fell over the edge. Steve’s cock barely released a dribble, having been emptied so thoroughly earlier, and his balls throbbed, but the pleasure was a welcome relief after a week and a half of casual denial. He gritted his teeth to hold back a whine as the strokes never stopped. Slow and steady, working him through oversensitivity and back to arousal. A sob tore from his throat, hips working against the firm grip keeping them pinned. “Please! Tony, please! It’s too much! I can’t… I can’t…”
"I know you can. I know you can be very, very good for me. Is this what you want, Steve?"
