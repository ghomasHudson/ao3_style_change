Tony took Steve’s hand in his and brought it to his lips. “My love, what fool am I to deny myself your company?”
But Steve only laughed and crawled closer to kiss Tony quiet. “You’re amazing, that’s what you are,” Steve said with what Tony swore was a mischievous grin. Before Tony could explain that Steve must have misheard, that they were about to spend their first and only six month anniversary in his stale old dorm room, Steve said, “I knew this would be a busy time for you, so I made plans this time. Would you like to hear them?”
“They tried many things, Lieutenant Bruce Banner,” he said as calmly as he could. “Nationwide video reels advertising rewards for his arrest. Satellite surveillance. Twelve-state manhunt. None of them worked. In the end, it was Captain America who personally brought him to justice.”
The woman was hanging on to the back-end of the saddle, undulating her hips with every toss and turn of the bull. Steve couldn’t bring himself to look away; it was an inevitable disaster.
“It’s set in London, right? And Agent Oh, the new Zed, is played by Emma Thompson. The part is for the son she left behind with her American husband to help save the world with the MIB,” he told Tony in a low whisper, “he returns to England to track down what happened to his mother, and his leads take him right into the MIB agents’ case.”
Tony smiled at his question. It wasn’t the proud, beaming smile of Tony presenting his insanely realistic disguise, or the excited, scheming grin of Tony plotting to sneak himself past enemy lines. This was the bashful smile of a boy who was still new to having friends who actively looked out for him.
Everywhere, of course, except at the palace. There the five days following the summer solstice were the busiest days of the year. Each day was dedicated to recognizing the contributions and leadership of different people around the country, a chance to thank them for their work and listen to their perspectives. The first two days were designed as day-long expos on the sciences and engineering, followed by the arts and literature. Professionals and exceptional students in the field were hosted at the royal palace, and for Steve and Tony it was a humbling experience to meet those whose views of the country were different and often better informed than theirs.
As much as he and Steve had in common as orphaned sons, the lingering consequences weighed on them differently.
With almost no distance left between then, though, Tony didn’t look as suave and collected as he did from a distance. Up close Steve saw everything, how his eyes were wide and bright and so very focused; how whatever answers he found in Steve lifted his lips in a goofy smile despite obvious attempt to resist.
“Playing dirty now, are we?” Tony teased in a growl as he straddled Steve’s hips. “Fuck me—use me like you used to, and I’ll do anything you want me to tomorrow.”
. Now that he finally had Steve to himself and away from other watchful party goers with taste, he wanted more than some furtive make-out session in the shadows. Between quick, eager kisses and his greedy fingers, Tony got an elbow on the door handle, kicked in the door he was pressed up against, and as the door fell open behind him he hauled his Highlander into the closet by his kilt.
“Thanks for making this appointment for us, Tony,” Steve said, and this time, Tony’s lips turned up in a shy smile.
Steve reached around and pinched Tony’s nipple hard to recenter his focus, and the pain helped Tony to distance himself from the frightening alien audience. He whimpered softly and immediately closed his eyes, struggling to get his feet up on the bench for leverage as Steve had told him. Slowly, with the uncoordinated, slow pace of a novice, Tony pushed himself up and then down again until he found a stumbling rhythm he could maintain, fucking himself on Steve’s cock for all to see.
“Mostly detectives do paper work,” Steve replied dryly, packing one letter back into its envelope and marking it as harmless. Tony’s lips curved up into a bashful grin, but he didn’t look away from Steve as he waited and listened. Steve watched him for a minute, then calmly elaborated. “How’s it going, Mr. Stark? Found anything?”
Steve purposefully stood close enough so Tony could feel him unzipping his pants and pulling his cock out. Then it was the work of seconds to ease the plug out of Tony’s ass, and even less than that to roll the condom on. The rim of Tony’s ass pulsed with the loss of the toy, stretched and well slick from the excessive lube. It wasn’t the longest or fattest toy in Tony’s collection, of that Steve had no doubt, but it was enough to get the job started.
By the time they had rounded everyone up and clarified that kitchen was not a funny new word for the theater, a library, or a drawing room, it had nearly been an hour. Steve made them coffee while a thoughtful staff attendant washed and cut up fruits for them to snack on while they gathered around a kitchen workstation with a built-in stove top.
Bucky whined to himself and marked the envelope as harmless so he could push it aside. He opened another, and immediately a set of professionally done boudoir photographs fell into his lap. It took a second before he realized what had happened. He glared at Tony like he was personally responsible for Bucky’s current fate.
Steve’s orgasm drove through him like a stampeding train, devastating and inescapable. His hips skittered forward in uncoordinated, instinctive thrusts until he came deep inside Tony, but even as his lizard brain wanted to pump every drop into his mate, Steve pulled out before he finished and jerked his cock through the thick, frothy mess of lube and come to paint Tony’s perfect round ass with long bands of his come.
There was recognition in Steve’s eyes this time, and the knot in Tony’s chest eased a little. “No-one can hurt you here, Steve,” he whispered, “not a person, not an animal, not a soul. You’re safe here, I promise you.”
“This is what the plan would have been if everything went wrong,” Steve drawled, trying to play the part of a cool, suave guy who was not at all nervous about the gorgeous playboy sauntering toward him and eyeing him like the best bite on offer.
“Steve?” Tony whispered in the sacred space between them. Steve hummed softly in reply, his attention still caught between Tony’s soft, wet lips, and his half-lidded eyes. “Promise me, no other man will hear you say those words? Spare them only for me.”
The interruption left Tony breathless and mildly dazed. He leaned up on one elbow to see what Steve moved away to do. This wasn’t the first time they had laid together in bed for long stretches of time, kissing each other breathless while their hands roamed, familiar and all the more eager for it. Still, Tony suspected he’d never tire of watching Steve getting ready to prepare him, from the care he insisted on taking with every step, to the look of concentration in his eyes. The movement of the copious lube between Steve’s long, strong fingers was absolutely hypnotic, and Tony was so nearly swept away staring at his fingers that the first touch of Steve’s hand left him gasping for breath in surprise.
“I went to the meeting,” Steve said without prompting, already sighing at the memory. “The producers were interested, no question, but the director… after the first couple of minutes, he was silent. Dead silent.”
“You straight people always say that like it’s an insult,” he said quietly, but it was the flash of hurt in his eyes and his resigned expression that had Steve choking on his words.
Light emanate from under the edges of the overturned phone. Without thinking, Steve paused the video again and reached for it.
“You are an incredibly sensitive man who inspires joy-joy feelings in all those around you!” the computer replied in a chipper voice.
Tony frowned a little to himself. Steve was being too vague, and it was difficult to pinpoint where Steve’s fear came from. “Do you think I’ll judge you?”
“So, Stark fled,” he explained, clapping Steve on the shoulder. “Less than ideal reaction, but chin up, Stevie. It only gets better with practice.”
“Then that’s settled, I won’t go without you,” Steve replied without further questions or concern. As if it had been the simplest decision to make. Tony rolled his eyes and exaggerated a sigh, then finally pushed away until he was sitting up again and Steve was free to do as he pleased.
“It’s a long story, but he is a lot stronger, faster, and smarter than he used to be. We can’t underestimate him, we have to hurry.”
Steve caught him. Tony gazed up at him with a dopey smile and half-lidded eyes, euphoric in his afterglow. Steve smiled back and bent to gather up Tony’s legs in his arms, lifting him in a bridal carry. Between softly whispered words of praise and affection, Tony murmured the number to their room. He nuzzled into Steve’s chest, and tired as he was, all that mattered was that Tony trusted Steve. Steve would not to let him down.
They would grab hot dogs and stroll through the city infuriating those in their endless rush to grow older. Tony would take Steve home to his suite in the penthouse just to indulge in his reactions. Others would love the view, the Fifth Avenue real estate. The butler, the chef, the armada of cars and motorcycles. But if Tony knew Steve - and there was no doubt in his mind that he knew Steve - he’d have no interest in the cars he couldn’t drive, or the people paid to do chores he would have preferred to share with Tony. Steve would marvel at the simple luxuries of water pressure, or a tub he can stretch his long legs in.
“Happy to be here, thank you for having me,” Tony replied, addressing both Stephen and the audience.
For reasons Steve couldn’t explain, it always amused him to hear how much Tony hated Boston - whether it was the Patriots, the Red Sox, or the Massholes themselves, it always warmed his heart. “I love you, too, Tony,” he whispered against Tony’s smiling lips, chasing every word with short, playful kisses. “Vegas or Atlantic City, you choose. I don’t care.”
Tony eyed the detonators and random bits of recovered tech. The lunatic behind the bombings was responsible for nearly turning his Steve into a statistic. They should have brought it all to Tony from the start, nothing would satisfy him more than personally nailing the bastard.
Tony stopped walking and stared at him. Steve slowed to a halt once he noticed and spun on his heel to give Tony a look.
“I will,” Steve promised without hesitation, his voice so low and deep that it rumbled through him like a predatory growl. “Living with you, being a part of your life, it’s all I’ve thought about these past few months. But filming it, or having sex after a long time apart isn’t the same as being together every day for eight months. I don’t want,” his words faltered in a moment of insecurity, but he quickly pushed through. “I don’t want to lose your interest.”
“Lieutenant Anthony E. Stark, step away from that terminal,” Fury commanded in a raised tone, “this is not a job for silver class personnel. Lieutenant Robert B. Banner, take over the terminal.”
Tony sounded so calm and collected that Steve found himself starting to resent him. How could he be so rational? Did this happen to him all the time? Maybe it did. Steve took a deep breath, and finally chanced a glance across the counter.
The question caught Steve entirely off guard. He stared at Tony for some time before asking, “With you?” When Tony nodded in the affirmative, Steve had another follow-up clarification question. “Tonight?”
“James didn’t think you’d know how to find this place,” she told him while they watched the two teams getting ready below.
“How could I disagree with that?” Steve muttered, then swept his thumb over the back of Tony’s hand gently. “Go on, then. Where’s that farmer’s market?”
Tony didn’t know whether to laugh or crawl under the bar and hide. “Typical? I just pretended to be seeing a complete stranger in a bar to avoid telling my friend how pathetic my dating life has been the last six months, and
“Never,” Steve admitted, pulling his hand back at first opportunity before the discomfort turned to pain.
“And I don’t like it when you two gang up on me!” Clark called from the bathroom. Steve didn’t pass the message on before hanging up and following his dad to the bathroom.
“Don’t ask me to hurt you,” Steve whimpered, his hips thrusting up to meet Tony’s tight fist involuntarily. “Please, Tony.”
“Steve?” Tony asked when Steve hadn’t moved or looked away from his wound for some time. “Baby, hey, I’m alive it’s ok, just bleeding like an uncooked ham so if you could call an ambulance instead of throwing up or something, that’d be nice. Great, actually. Steve? Hey, Steve?”
might have a blue tongue, but theirs has evolved to be purple. Evolution happens over many, many generations because it helps them live better in their environment. So our job is to think about how blue tongues could be helpful to giraffes. Where should we start?” he wondered, crouching down to help them conspire. “What do we know about giraffes?”
Tony grinned at him like he’d made some silly joke and shook his head. “Having sex, of course. Put it on.”
“Tell me about your day? This is delicious, by the way,” Tony mumbled between bites of food. He probably should learn how to cook soon; Steve’s food wasn’t Michelin quality food, but it was a delicious part of coming home. Tony had only felt peckish when Steve asked him if he was hungry, but after tasting his first bite of hot, gooey cheese, grilled onions, and the flavorful barbecue chicken, Tony realized he was starving. He couldn’t eat fast enough.
Of all the shit Steve had seen, it hadn’t prepared him for walking into random miracle workers. But sure enough, the drive was open, and there were five files available in the folder for him to look through. It only took him a minute to skim through them to notice a pattern.
His plan was to work so hard he wouldn't have the time to miss Brock until he saw him again. At Harvard Law school, as an equal. Nobody could deny that he was a serious person then.
With Steve’s endorsement, Tony joined the dozen other archers lined up for the contest. Onlookers cheered with excitement and applauded to see their king participating in his first event, until Bucky took his place beside Tony in the competition and a silence fell over the crowd. Tony stared slack jawed in genuine surprise, and around them their audience suddenly roared with laughter and applause to see the king’s own bodyguard coming in as a challenger.
was not a kiss,” he whispered, and he leaned in closer until Tony could feel Steve’s breath against his lips. “Would you like to know what a kiss is, Tony?”
“...Stark, don’t you think you’re blowing this a little out of proportion?” he said in a dubious drawl. “It’s fucking Taco Bell.”
“You are a patient teacher,” Steve said with a distracted smile. The way Tony’s face changed from the stern silence some seconds ago to this sudden burst of pride was the change of night and day, and distracting as he was, Steve couldn’t help his straying thoughts. These bureaucratic complications were extensive and too integrated into every aspect of daily life; they could not be without their purpose. But for whose benefit were they?
Sam smacked him on the shoulder until Tony took the headset off and looked at him. “You okay, man? You look pale.”
Steve’s voice echoed like war drums down in the cavernous tunnel, and Tony hissed at him to be quiet. “You are my ward, Steve Rogers. I will not allow it.”
“Or maybe he’s a divorce attorney who wants to save face by refusing to admit he’s just as bad as his clients,” Sam chimed in with a touch of objectivity.
“I’m not going,” Thor sulked just out of sight, and Tony turned the corner into Thor’s bedroom to see the man still in bed, hugging a pillow that Tony guessed had been Jane’s at some point. Rather than sit on the bed and risk shifting any of the blankets currently maintaining Thor’s modesty, Tony crouched next to the bed so that he could face Thor eye to eye.
Tony had half a mind to throw the headset away and leave Bond to fend for himself. “I’m gonna kill him. I’m going to fucking kill—”
“I mean, I don’t know anymore—can we talk about all this later, Steve? We’ll be late to the ball, the car’s waiting. Let’s nail Wayne and then we can talk.”
Instead, kept far from prying eyes in the back of Tony’s closet, he kept Steve’s clothes. The two button ups he’d taken to practice ironing on and only ever slept in. The small collection of Steve’s briefs, all a size too large for Tony, but they fit in his hands, where it most mattered. He’d smuggled them away from Steve on those spontaneous nights they spent in Tony’s room, and he fondly remembered the feigned attempts to help Steve locate his underwear the next morning, only to regretfully send his gorgeous stud back to Boston commando.
After taking two canisters back to back, Tony’s body was both slick and stretched for Steve’s cock. Steve mounted him fast and took him hard, pulling Tony’s pliant body back onto his cock with such force that bruises formed across Tony’s hips where Steve's hands held him fast.
“For the drive home,” Steve simply said, and with a quick tuck and fold of his tartan around his belt, he created a pocket in his kilt for the plug.
Between the two of them, Tony was the one with a broader sense of research and technology in the kingdom. He also enjoyed a lifetime of education that Steve had only caught up with recently in a compressed period of time. So when they walked through the expos and listened to the students, Tony was the one who could make suggestions for improvement and ask technical questions, and knew enough about the science to praise the children for their exceptional work.
Until Tony noticed Steve hadn’t been following and turned to give him a questioning look. “Detective?”
Bucky and Steve told Natasha, and after that, it was not long before they were on the move. She announced to the people around them that she and Bucky were looking into a threat in the 11th hall. Tony expected them to gather as families or protect their young; at worst, he expected they would leave the citizens of New Yorseylvania who would happily leave Scraps to starve to deal with it alone. Natasha didn’t even ask for their help. Yet when Steve and Tony followed Bucky and Natasha’s lead, they were joined by nearly two dozen armed Scraps.
Steve eased himself onto the couch with care, but before he could reach his pillows, Tony was there to help. “It’s just a mild sprain, Doc. I’m sure I’ll live.”
“And I will be faithful to you and only you, for as long as you will have me,“ Stephanie promised in return, and then carefully, if cautiously, she pressed her lips against Tony’s in a slow, tender kiss.
“Be at ease, Bruce Banner, I will do what I can to help you,” Tony promised and took the tablet without delay. He flipped through the screens and called up Bruce's most recent private communications. The first one was addressed from his doctor and bore the description, ‘Screening results.’ He cleared his throat and started to read.
“I can see my fucking reflection,” he said, his tone so surprised it approached horrified. “I didn’t—how did you do that?”
Tony glanced up from his heaping stack of sour cream pancakes and caramelized bananas, as if waiting for Bruce to make his point.
He squeezed his sore cock harder. He whimpered pitifully, breathlessly, and his body convulsed from the painful sting of the bleeding cuts left across his shaft. But over the sound of his heartbeat pounding in his ears, he could make out the soft, appreciative groan of the crowd, and the involuntary jerk of Steve’s hips under him.
For better or worse, it was shaping up to be a quick case. When Romanov called her first witness to the stand, one of Hansen and Barnes’s shared accountants told the court that he had found two large sums of money paid out on the dates in question. The amounts paid were reflected in the bank statements offered by both sex workers as evidence.
“Steve, this is the gym floor,” Tony told him slowly, then gently guided them both back into the elevator. He didn’t push any buttons, and let the elevator continue on its predetermined route. “Did you just get here, or were you in the city?”
“My mom was against any kind of flashy, colorful ring, because it’s easier to coordinate outfits with classic looks, but
Steve smiled back at him, but left it at that. He had work to do. His phone was already ringing in his hand as he made his way out of Caffe Italia and turned in the direction of the nearest tube station.
There was a lot of unconnected information tied together in that one sentence, and it took Steve a few seconds longer than usual to digest what Tony had said. “What about the US embassy?”
“She’s ready to help save the free world,” Tony said proudly. “I’m taking her for a spin around the course when Penny finishes with her new inflatable scooters. Want in?”
“Where do you live?“ Stephanie asked, more curious than Tony ever could have imagined a Woman being in anything he said. His pleasant surprised was short-lived, however, and he shifted uncomfortably. What would she know of the way men had to live? To her, a humble home might be a countryside house, or a cottage hidden in the woods.
Without another word, Steve turned his back on the floundering man and left. Sharon startled to attention and leapt into action to keep up with him.
, a sincere effort by a politician of note who tried to defend the vulnerable of the world and sought his peace and his grounding in his faith and in his poetry.
“At first they were, that’s right,” Steve confirmed. “It appears you have at least one big fan in the NYPD, Mr. Stark. I have to hope that gives us an advantage.”
“Wilson, I need a favor,” he announced, pitching his voice low. “Steve’s birthday is in two days and the man eats everything. He likes everything. He’s perfect. You gotta help me: where do I take the man for a birthday feast? Something special.”
“According to Swinney v. Neubert, Swinney, who was also a private sperm donor, was allowed visitation rights as long as he came to terms with the hours set by the parents. So if we’re sticking to past precedent, Mr. Latimer wasn’t stalking, he was clearly within his rights to ask for visitation.”
“Not exactly something I’m proud of, Steve,” Tony whispered, “but yeah. Nothing serious, but enough to get a little… extra attention. Do you think it’s relevant to the case?”
“Keep talking like that and I will drag you to bed with my bare hands,” Tony whispered against Steve’s jaw, but rather than worrying or delighting in Tony’s very genuine threat, Steve chuckled cheerfully and slipped his hands into Tony’s back pockets to squeeze him closer.
Steve swallowed the last of his doubt and answered him with a subtle but certain nod. Tony smiled up at him, cupping his cheek with a hand to guide him back down for another kiss. One tender, adoring kiss skimmed into another, each more curious, more playful, more eager than the last until Steve had no reason to question how Tony felt for him.
“Enhance your calm, Steve Rogers,” Tony suggested in a gentling tone, but it only seemed to agitate his charge further.
,” he told Steve with an aloof flare, apropos of nothing, and Steve burst out laughing in his face. Tony’s unimpressed facade nearly slipped, but he managed to turn his expression into something distant and smug when he asked, “Did you really cry?”
With a bitter inward sigh, Steve reminded himself that it wasn’t his place to notice anymore. He steeled himself for their intended meeting and announced himself with a simple, “Hey, Tony.”
Two men were immobilized and he was grappling a third into submission when two jumped on him from behind. He was too heavy for them to control, but together they were able to free Steve’s captive until more of them arrived. For a moment, Steve almost rocked back on his heels to see dozens of these figures dressed in black rushing at the truck.
But curled in on himself beside Steve, he looked smaller than ever before. For one flashing second Steve’s reptilian brain wanted nothing more than to gather Tony against his body and shield him from the world, as if the flu might be a threat he could fight away like any loathsome opportunist.
Nobody asked any questions when Tony finally excused himself from the lab early. It had been five hours since the attack, and after all this silence, Tony’s only remaining hope was that Steve was one of the many injured. He could not focus, not on his work or on the people around him; even opening his office took a few tries before he managed to wrench the key in the right direction. If he was going to be miserable, he might as well be miserable at home.
“Upset?” Steve shot up in his seat and interjected before Tony could finish. “Why would I be upset? New York as I know it is gone, my friends are long dead, and I’m stuck in a post-apocalyptic fascist Stepford dystopia surrounded by brainwashed pacifists who have outlawed
“I got us a car,” he interrupted, “don’t trouble them, Tony, it’ll take them twice as long to make the trip to pick us up.”
“Pierce is not the first person in history that wanted a homogenous, pacified herd of people following him,” Bucky told Tony on their short walk. “He’s not the first person who wanted to control his people’s education and genetic makeup. Steve and I went to war against one in our time,” he added, “he didn’t succeed. Another one got close in the 21st. But this time, Pierce has almost succeeded.”
(Was there a friendly, non-romantic way to ask without giving Tony the wrong impression? Was there a friendly, non-romantic way to ask Tony if he wanted to get a drink, or if he was interested in coming around to Steve’s place to see whether the memory foam mattress still remembered him? Because Steve sure did.)
“Maybe? I don’t think he’s that manipulative, though,” Steve admitted, which caught his mother’s attention.
“Oh no, no,” Tony answered immediately, palms up already in a show of neutrality. “You’re not making me pick sides, not now, not ever.
Steve reached into his uniform jacket and pulled out the Beretta he had kept since the museum visit. He chambered the weapon without looking away from Pierce on the VideoGram.
Steve made his way to one of the prize tables against the wall near an outlet. A young man sat at the table alone, tapping away on a laptop while speaking on his phone. The man’s computer bag occupied the only other chair.
Tony’s private hoard of toys - affectionately called his treasure chest - was his pride and joy. He began his dutiful hunt for the best that money could buy in his mid-teens, and by now he had curated a cache boasting enough variety and exclusive collectibles to make Gillian Anderson blush.
He stepped back to watch Tony briefly, his eyes dark as he took in the senseless hedonism playing out over Tony’s face. Tony was already hanging his head and panting in time with the hard and fast piston working the canisters into his body, softly mewling under his breath.
Tony stared back at him as if he couldn’t believe Steve was speaking such words to him, and like some comic animation, a deep blush rose in Tony’s cheeks. But instead of looking away or shying away from eye contact, Tony seemed spell-bound, and smiled back at Steve as if no other words had ever made him happier.
Steve must have been unresponsive for too long, because the next thing he knew, Bucky wandered into the kitchen and wondered if Steve was still a bad kisser.
“Woman, we mean you no harm,” the most decorated warrior declared. “The donkey is a coward who deserted a mating, and the other is an unclaimed man. We will take them, in the name of Chief Talia.”
- he felt a cautious hand cup and caress his ass. The human-like skin was cool to the touch, and when the student’s long, slender fingers swept down and up between his ass cheeks, Tony almost lost it. The alien’s skin wasn’t just cool, it was smooth and slippery, like flawless silk dipped in water.
“First of all, the gifts you give me I can’t wear on a daily basis,” Steve started, and before Tony could argue, he quickly added, “and second, you’ve always had something of mine. That’s how I like it. In college it was hickeys. Then you wore my dog tags. You don’t know how hot that makes me, Tony, seeing you wearing them. But then that summer you were going out into the real world with people like your dad and his shitty business partners, and hickeys and dog tags didn’t feel like enough. The only way this ring would make me happier was if it was on your finger, sweetheart,” he admitted ruefully. “I don’t care about a marriage half as much as I want the world to know you’re off the market. That you’re with me. If they want to touch you, it’s through me.”
“Bannaghtyn as failt ort ny balley as cree beaynee Brigid. Noght ny lheeishyn eh ta lhiats. Cur tastey dou myr saillt hene, sheean mie orrym aynjee ennym, as hig ee bannee whilleen as t'ayns shoh kionfenish as dty dhieyn marish yn ven graih as maih beayn.”
“‘That’s it’?” Steve repeated far too calmly, though he frowned around the words and their bitter aftertaste. “With all due respect, during my four-year tenure, Shield has received more accolades and recognition than the prior decade.”
Tony turned the weapon in the palm of his hand, and with a powerful swing, he cracked it over Steve’s face. The force of his blow turned Steve in the other direction, but he stubbornly kept his hand over the towel, putting pressure on Tony’s wounds.
When Steve only looked at Tony like he was crazy, Bruce cleared his throat and tried to help explain. “Captain Steven G. Rogers, our society has evolved since your time. We have not had any MDKs in New Yorseylvania in the last forty years.”
Steve frowned to himself. The receptionist hadn’t said anything about dinner being brought up. He tucked a twenty under an empty glass on the bedside table then went to answer the door.
Steve didn’t have the stomach to click on a single article. There was no question Tony’s rumored date was beautiful in every sense of the word. She didn’t deserve to be hated, she’d done nothing wrong, but Steve’s heart grew cold just looking at her.
“Danielle?” Sharon guessed; when Steve hummed in confirmation around his first drink, she quickly added, “I called her like you said, and told her that if she doesn’t turn her manuscript in on time, you won’t give her a release date.”
“Come with me, right now,” Steve hissed as soon as Fury’s door was shut behind them, and marched them back to his office, top speed. Sharon rushed to keep up, trying not to look too frazzled as they passed through the sea of cubicles on the way to Steve’s office.
The loaded weapons were turned up to the sky then quickly holstered as the soldiers realized who stood before them. Steve raised his hand to show his appreciation, and when he spoke, he addressed them all.
His thoughts were still racing when he crawled into bed. No matter how he tossed and turned, Steve couldn’t get comfortable enough to attempt sleep. Finally, he picked up his yarn and his knitting needles, and sought solace in the mindless, repetitive work.
“Listen to me, you bitch,” Hansen snapped, “I want my money; I earned that money! I had a promising modeling career, a future in science, and I gave it up for that man. I am not going to wind up a twenty-six year old mother of three with nothing to show for my time just because you didn’t prepare a better case!”
Steve spun around on the bench to see Brock walking up to them. “Brock, hi! I,” he stopped talking immediately and turned back to the redheaded woman visibly studying his fiancé without saying a word. “Thank you again, I really appreciate all you shared with me. I hope I see you again!”
The hand over his mouth muffled Tony’s first, breathless moan of pleasure, and Steve angled Tony’s head back to bite into the shell of his ear, releasing it slowly past his teeth before he clamped down over Tony’s earlobe again and sucked on it with insatiable delight.
It wasn’t long before Tony learned that rocking his hips to meet Steve’s thrusts back wasn’t as effective as the clutch of his body. So, he waited. He relaxed as Steve pushed into him, eager to feel every glorious inch of him, but when Steve tried to pull out, Tony squeezed around the full length of his cock, boasting a lifetime of core strength and balance honed in the saddle. Steve gasped audibly and his hips stuttered forward; a guttural moan escaped Tony, and he relaxed again to receive him. The next time Steve tried to pull out, Tony squeezed down with enough strength that Steve’s grip of his leg went slack.
“I am saddened and stunned. As the silver class officer says,” he said in the same calm, serene voice he’d greeted them with earlier, “I pioneered these facilities in order to end the brutality of prison, such that even those victimized by their circumstances into criminal behavior can have a chance—”
Somehow, the realization that Tony might have job opportunities outside of the city rattled him more than Bucky’s earlier allegations ever could have. It had simply never occurred to him before. Tony wasn’t the kind of man to cheat on him, Steve had no doubt, but much like his ex, Tony
“I need to tell you something about my… my life, before,” Steve told him. “It occurred to me yesterday, and I think… I mean, it meant a lot, to me.”
Steve smiled thoughtfully to himself, remembering Tony’s soft cries and grasping fingers. The illicit taste of his sweat. “In that case,” he said, “put him on the schedule for tomorrow.”
In the surrounding commotion of arresting Pierce and containing Rumlow, it was Bruce who first rushed to help Steve with Tony. “We must put pressure on the wound—”
He turned the simple, gold band over in his fingers. It was polished to a shine, as it always was, and warm from the touch of his skin. Steve normally carried it in the ball chain necklace with his dog tags, but on the rougher days when he really didn’t want to face the world or deal with anyone, he wore it on his pinky to remind him of someone who was worth that effort. He wasn’t a genius, but Tony had never allowed him to entertain
After their wedding and the subsequent unification, Eisenturm was named the capital of Consone and Steve moved into the Royal Palace. What had been King Howard and Queen Maria’s wing was remade for them, leaving Tony’s apartments vacant for their future heir.
“Glad you made it in okay. You’re a few doors down from me, I’ll show you,” Tony said once the elevator stopped, then he took Steve’s luggage and stepped out first. Steve stalled in the elevator, his processor short circuiting as his eyes locked on target. Those ‘hot rod red’ tights left very little to the imagination, especially from behind.
Steve was sitting just a few tables to his left, his back to the wall and face hidden under a baseball cap. Tony smirked at the conspicuous disguise but made his way over without delay, squeezing Steve’s shoulder gently in greeting as he sat down across from him.
. All at once, Steve’s body was keyed up in a very unexpected way, and it didn’t help that he could hear each of the soft, inviting sounds Tony made as he dropped into his hotel bed and pulled his blankets up around him to get cozy.
“It’s not as nice as your place, and the bed isn’t as big,” Steve continued with a smile. “But it’s safe, and you won’t be alone. I know Kline is in custody, but I still… it would be good to know you’re not alone.”
Tony’s ass put up more of a resistance than Steve remembered. His words about not being fucked in all their time apart came back to him, and Steve quickly reached for the extra bottle of lube they had picked up on their way home.
” Tony insisted. “You heard M’Baku, if they took him out of the ice he would’ve died within minutes.”
Eventually, Steve found it, and without hesitation, without mercy, he scrubbed his finger against it, not letting up for a beat to give Tony a chance to recuperate.
The suggested movies gave Tony pause. He had prepared himself for romcoms, or for Steve to maybe suggest a horror movie in the hopes that Tony would be scared enough to cling to his side for protection. But these were neither; in fact, they were fun, classic 80s movies he wouldn’t mind going to see.
“Still feeling sassy, Rogers?” Tony growled down at his unrepentant partner. Steve batted his eyelashes up at him and opened his mouth to speak, but before Steve got a syllable out Tony cut him off with a kiss, a playful, biting thing that turned Steve’s delighted giggling into a quiet moan of satisfaction.
“Captain,” Tony said with a forced calm as Steve looked around them in growing confusion. “We no longer use physical contact greetings. In fact, we do not share physical contact with people outside of our nuclear family and committed romantic partners.”
“There are padded seats in the balcony,” she told him after a few moments, “but I think the best available seats are in section 107: center ice, great view of the game. They’re expensive, but—”
They stood together for a while, swaying comfortably in silence. Steve nuzzled into Tony’s hair and breathed him in, slow and steady, while listening to the proverbial wheels spinning in Tony’s head.
Steve rubbed gentle, soothing circles over the small of Tony’s back, easing him down from the high of his orgasm. When Steve was sure he had all he could get out of him for this round, he disengaged the device and pulled it free to allow Tony’s ass temporary but needed rest. Muddled and cozy as Tony was after his high, he rolled away from Steve as soon as he was released, crawling instinctively under the covers to fall deeper into sleep.
“Nothing,” Orfeo whispered, then very carefully reached under his blanket to pull out a soggy bag of ice. Judging by how he’d pulled it out from between his legs, Tony could only grimace to himself in sympathy.
When Steve returned to the present, he needed a moment to recall what they’d been talking about. “I keep it to remind me of what’s most important in my life,” he explained eventually, before letting go of the ring and shifting on the couch to lay out on top of Tony, stretching out with care until they were both comfortable.
Steve pressed him further into the mattress in return, then slid in behind Tony’s body until there was no space between them. With one hand, Steve hauled Tony’s top leg up and in a deep, rumbling voice Tony had never heard before, ordered Tony to spread himself for him. Tony reacted on instinct, hooking an arm around his top leg to do as Steve asked.
A pretty boy like Tony Stark, Steve had expected him to cling to his body the whole way. But Tony had swung his leg over the bike and settled in behind Steve comfortably, with his hands loosely framing Steve’s hips, as if he was so confident in his seat that holding on was a secondary thought.
“Not so much,” he admitted. “I know what to do, on top, but if I’m not in control, I… I don’t know.”
“Thor was helping me in preparation for the piece we talked about this morning,” he told Yinsen directly. “It’s about relationships—how, the uh, the stages of a relationship, and how men navigate them. We were thinking,” he added, reaching to put a hand on Thor in case it wasn’t clear whom he was referring to, “our readers should know how tricky men can be. They are not just simple creatures who need sex all hours of the day. Men are manipulative and fragile. Don’t you think our readers could benefit from the strategies men use to get their way? Everyone from Cosmo to Teen Vogue talks about spicing things up in the bedroom, but how will they learn the different circumstances, strategies, and—and warning signs of men who use relationships rather than, uh, nurture them?”
“You know,” he said, sounding too casual to be genuine. It was enough to catch Tony’s attention and shake off his own insecurities to listen to what Steve had to say. “Before you, I didn’t really… I didn’t think I’d be able to be with someone long term.”
And Steve didn’t hesitate to shake every one of their dry, filthy, unmanicured hands, introducing himself as only ‘Steve’ and repeating each Scrap’s name to enhance his learning.
was the highest grossing film last year, so it’s safe to say people know your name around the world. Have you had a chance to enjoy that? Because, tell me if this is right, you did four movies in ten months?” Stephen asked in mild awe, glancing at his card for confirmation.
A smile spread across Tony’s face the moment he felt Steve rising up to meet him, and he followed Steve’s lead eagerly. When their lips finally met in a sweet, indulgent kiss, Tony was still smiling.
Finally, he turned back to Steve and stretched to steal another kiss (and another) before taking his hand.
“Sometimes I can’t tell if you’re Steve Rogers or Captain America,” Tony said reverently, shaking his head slowly without taking his eyes off of Steve. “I could kiss you right now.”
Translation for Tony's Spanish line: “No, hey mom, I'm hanging up. This guy's really hot. Yeah—bye, mom."
Tony blushed furiously at the Steve’s word choice, while distantly the morality box spewed a ticket and announced, “Captain Steven G. Rogers, you are fined five credits for a violation of verbal morality statute 1-1-3.”
“Come on, honey, hurry up,” Maria told him, pulling her boots off at the door. “We got five hours before the officiator gets here, and we got work to do.”
in the design of lace garters. There were only two sizes available, and Steve totally knew how to put tights on. Maybe this wasn’t so scary after all.
“Tony,” Steve leaned in to whisper at a polite volume against Tony’s cheek. “If you want to talk, we don’t have to stay, but other people are trying to watch the movie.”
. Seven justices declared that the constitutional right to privacy ‘is broad enough to encompass a woman’s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy,’ and struck down all fifty states’ abortion laws. In the years that followed, RBG made no bones about her dislike of Justice Harry Blackmun’s opinion in the case. Now, I know what you’re thinking,” he murmured then to the little dog that had settled its chin on Tony’s knee to listen. “RBG, against abortion rights? But, here, if you’ll listen, we get to that: If abortion was a private choice, RBG pointed out, would public insurance have to pay for it like any other medical procedure? No, said the Supreme Court seven years after
He deposited the human in his sleeping nest when he first got home, unwrapping him from the blankets he had carried him away in like a birthday gift. The sweat had dried from his skin or been brushed away by the bedsheets while Steve carried him, but Steve couldn’t resist staring at Tony’s naked body with a possessive hunger now that he was first laid out before him. With gentle hands, he squeezed and caressed Tony’s inner thighs, marveling at how easily he reacted and obediently spread his legs. Steve brushed his fingers over the delicate skin of his balls, rolling them tenderly in his hand as he mused over just how something so fragile, and much smaller than Steve’s fist, could be so potent and valuable.
“We might as well go looking for her,” Tony replied, and Steve’s smile burgeoned into a soft laugh that left Tony’s heart doing silly things. He could feel his cheeks warming so he quickly turned his attention away. His phone was the first thing Tony saw, so he picked it up and pretended he needed to look at the map.
Bucky made a non-committal grunt on the other end of the line. “I bet there’s some kids out there who’ll be happy to know before seeing it.”
Tony hummed softly in the affirmative and licked his dry lips, unintentionally catching Steve’s lips, too. The unexpected touch caught him off guard, and he gasped in his surprise. Steve laughed quietly to himself, and with his lips still curled up in a smile, Steve brushed his lips against Tony’s in a chaste, tender kiss.
“As if that’s a threat, Rogers,” Tony said with a roll of his eyes. “How long can you hold this position anyway, two minute? Ten?”
Tony didn’t have to be a genius to know Steve wasn’t just worried about Tony getting stuck at an airport.
Tony’s playful expression fell into awkward disgust. It wasn’t every day Tony Stark looked stumped, and Steve inwardly preened from his front row seat to the spectacle of Tony processing Steve’s comparison and the realization that inevitably dawned on his face.
Steve frowned at her and tried to decide on whether to cross his arms or plant his hands on his hips this time. “Tutu is not lingerie.”
“Oh, god no, I don’t want anything to do with the conversation,” Steve answered in a rush, and Tony snickered so suddenly he nearly squeaked. “No, I just—I’m happiest listening.”
“Steve, thank you,” Tony said just as their food arrived. There was a brief pause in their conversation as all the plates were arranged on the table between them, and a quick plan of attack was agreed upon.
“You treat me like you’re embarrassed by me, Steve,” Tony insisted, closing the opportunities for Steve to weasel his way out of the argument. “You can’t care about me and also be embarrassed by me on the sly. Life doesn’t work like that.”
Tony and Channing seemed equally understanding of the college-age logic while Rob, at the other end of the couch, felt the need to point out: “With a
“This case has been… really difficult for me, but not because of the reasons you may think. I, um. When I came to Gotham, I barely knew anyone. I knew one person, that was it. This was just going to be a place to get some experience in journalism before I moved on, traveled the world. But, then I met you, and, and you—it’s actually a little funny, because this is how my parents met, but I didn’t think I’d fall for my partner at work, that would be too big of a coincidence, but look at me I’m a walking cliche, I’m, I’m a disaster Tony, I’ve never done this before so all of it would be on you—”
“So, let me get this straight,” he said slowly, if irritably. “You can call me Captain Steven G. Rogers, Captain Steve Rogers, or Steve Rogers? But you can’t call me Steve even if it is my preference?”
Steve shook his head slowly, but he ducked out of his closet long enough to give Tony a quick peck on the lips before resuming packing.
“Erring on the side of caution here, Tony. Take a look,” Steve grabbed two of the detonators from under the scientists noses to share with Tony through his camera phone. He held the phone angled toward the detonators by his teeth, and put his earbuds on so he could hear Tony’s voice clearly while he worked.
With his legs spread and his hips elevated, Torin made room for one more candle on the altar between Ean’s thighs. The gentle flame cast golden light on the most vulnerable and intimate anatomy, illuminating his exposed cock and trembling thighs to their audience. Slim shadows danced over his smooth skin, and finally Torin allowed himself to begin.
Steve didn’t have the energy to be shocked anymore. He needed pictures, so why not have a guy who filmed cadavers and crime scenes do it for him? That made perfect sense. At least he’d be a subject who still had his pulse; maybe Barton would like that for a change of pace.
“You are not the first to remind me that your safety is none of my business, Tony. But you know as well as I do that in my absence James will find fewer obstacles in his job, he’ll be able to protect you more effectively.”
By the time they were dropped off at the InterContinental, even Steve was dragging his feet. Each step became increasingly heavy and difficult to bear. He developed a mantra to remind himself of the luxurious treats that awaited him in his suite - a warm shower, a firm bed. Maybe even curtains to block out the sun so he could spend the four hours they had before the premiere doing something productive, like sleeping.
“He didn’t break into the house,” Tony hurried to say while kicking his unaware brother under the table. “I needed to reach something in the living room, there was nowhere to rest the ladder, and the chairs were too short.”
“Do I comment on the cost of anything you pay for?” Steve reminded him gently, but before Tony could stop himself, he glared back at Steve’s nonchalance.
“—Thanks, Stark, that’s—I get it, thank you,” Steve interjected with a wave of his hand and a tired sigh. “What about last names?”
“Then here we go,” Karl said with a big grin. “This is for both of you about the other, does that make sense? What song would the man next to you use to describe your characters’ relationship in
“And you never have to do it alone, mein Schafes,” Steve smiled at him between their joined hands framing his face, and Tony could feel his whole body trembling. “We will do it together.”
“Yes, sir,” Steve agreed immediately, and this time he grabbed Sharon by the elbow and dragged her towards the door with him. “Two weeks. I’ll have it done.”
This time, Bucky’s gruff look ebbed into a more genuine surprise. He took a seat on the steps next to Steve, and in clear contrast to the exaggerated front he’d put on seconds ago, he now spoke quietly and with care. “Steve, that's a big step. If this is another Sharon...”
Tony smiled into the kiss and purred in delight, wrapping his arms around Steve’s neck and absently scratching at Steve’s naked shoulders while he pulled him in closer.
“Steve Rogers!” he heard someone shout as his body shook. “Steve Rogers, I demand you wake this instant, you are frightening me and I cannot help you if you continue to sleep!”
“A lot of people go for this look,” Steve was saying in his defense all the while, then tugged his arm free to re-settle the leather jacket. “It’s polished, it’s fashionable, it could pay my rent for a month—”
“But there is one final guest who’ll be coming on a little later, surely you’ll have heard of him. The fastest man alive will be joining us, ladies and gentlemen: Usain Bolt!”
“You’re right, it will be different,” Tony admitted softly, scraping his blunt nails slowly up and down the curve of his neck. “But may I introduce a different frame? Just for the sake of argument?”
When they reached the restaurant, Steve’s jaw dropped. The marble building gleamed under the light of numerous spotlights, and the stained glass windows inset across the pediment were backlit to highlight the various scenery of farmers and families who smiling labored to harvest the crops presumably intended for Taco Bell’s culinary feast. The crowning feature of the restaurant building was the glass dome that climbed high over the trees, and even from the car, Steve could make out the waiters in their white tuxedos and bedazzled sombreros carrying silver trays of food to the fortunate few who could dine at the top.
Steve was on the call to order their meals when Tony’s second text came in. He rolled his eyes to himself, but changed their order to include two bottles of champagne, then hung up to answer Tony.
The memories helped, and when he climbed into the passenger seat of the truck, he could genuinely smile again. Howard gave him a side-long look, but he didn’t say a word as he started up the truck. They took off down an unlit dirt road.
The first time, Steve did not last long. In fact, he barely registered the satisfaction of fully seating his cock in Tony’s body before his orgasm barreled through him like a storm, merciless and consuming. His mind returned in stages, and it wasn’t until some minutes later that he realized he was still fucking into Tony’s body, chasing his second orgasm before he had recovered from the first.
“That’s supposed to help?” Steve heard Carol snap at them, and an indistinguishable amount of time passed with them shouting around him before he felt something large, warm, and heavy drape over his back, and strong arms closing around him.
“I’ve never been more excited to be next to another man’s legs in my life,” Channing admitted with genuine thrill and anxiety, and -
A wild array of reactions flickered across Bucky’s expression—confusion, queasy discomfort, dawning shock, fear—until anger burned behind his eyes. “You think it’s a message?”
“Come on, man, you’d be great! And you already look the part,” Tony whined softly, pouting and batting his biggest puppy dog eyes at Bruce in the hopes it would work.
Ten seconds into the ride, Steve eased up on the power to slow it all down and reset the clock. No more aggressive bucks or turns, no more sudden throws rearing back; what mattered was slowing down the smooth, confident movement of Tony’s hips into a fantasy that Steve could clearly see, and indulge in for years to come.
Graham and the couch listened with a pleasant silence, but as Tony finished his story, Graham looked thoughtful. “Pilates, that’s similar to yoga, isn’t it?”
Their most consistent ritual was the morning shave. Every morning that they were both in the White House, Steve shaved Tony’s beard. If Tony had big matters of state or a televised speech to deliver, it was an old fashioned shave with a straight razor, but days that were more casual and administrative, Steve was happy with a regular double-edged razor.
“Of course,” Tony grinned, thanking the waiter again as he sat up to get himself situated. He raised his glass, and said, “To a life worth living.”
“How different could this be?” Steve pointed out as he was eased back into a cushioned seat. “Sit where you’re comfortable, Foster.”
“At least you got one good thing out of it,” Paulette said with a bittersweet smile. “But was that good enough to hold on to?”
That was how he caught Steve looking back at him with something approaching pride and affection in his eyes. Whether he was bothered by the other pets’ distress, or he had noticed Tony’s discomfort, Steve smoothed his big palm down Tony’s side until he was leisurely rubbing Tony’s inner thighs. It was plenty to take Tony’s mind off the spectacle around him - he had been left untouched for too long not to respond, and seeing how Steve looked at him left him desperate to express his gratitude. Tony responded to Steve’s touch eagerly and without hesitation, spreading his legs further apart and opening himself up to invite his master’s touch.
The table assured her and Sam they weren’t going anywhere until they were fed, but as soon as the hosts were out of earshot, the table turned as one to conspire.
Came here to say tihs the friend that was setting them up said she theyy had a date and everything for when he got back from promo tour
“Man, you should’ve said something sooner,” Sam said with a doleful pity. “He’s got you believing his lies—”
Luckily, it was BU’s reading week ahead of their final exams, so Steve made the trek out to Cambridge to see Tony after six long days apart.
“You know,” she started awkwardly, then stopped herself abruptly. Steve watched as she reconsidered and tried again. “I’ll fall asleep if I work in my room, so I’m heading to the library. Want to join?”
“Ambush weddings probably include photographers,” Steve replied in a whisper. Then, a little more quietly, he said, “Hey, Tony? You ever think of this?”
“I hate you,” Bucky groaned between disgusted gasps of air. Breaking into the sewage drains had been bad, but after a few minutes, their noses had adjusted. But when they had gotten to the point of the wall where wading through the filth was no longer an option and they had to swim in it - see through it - he had never more wanted to give up on his asshole friend.
“And the criminals they pertain to,” Tony agreed, equally frightened and overwhelmed by his realization. “Thaw them and bring them into our world rehabilitated with any skills he wishes.”
“And you’re fucking gorgeous,” Tony whispered when he opened his eyes again, licking into Steve’s mouth with a playful flick of his tongue.
“I will return with you,” she said. “We will try it your way. If this does not work, you will help me find a tribe and a bride to lift the curse. Do you agree?”
Soft, hapless words of gratitude spilled from Tony’s lips while his hips continued stuttering up to thrust his cock against the back of Steve’s throat. But Steve still had his long fingers curled deep inside Tony, and each time Tony started to relax, he would graze his knuckles over Tony’s prostate to coax another thrust, another gush of come, another grunt of satisfaction. Tony was almost at the point of having to shove Steve away just to catch his breath when Steve eased off. Instead of his knuckles directly pressing up against Tony’s prostate, now only the pads of his fingertips lazily circled it; he also pulled off of Tony’s cock, shifting down instead and closing his mouth around Tony’s balls, suckling with an easy going and self-indulgent hunger.
“What—Tony? 2009?” Steve asked plaintively, tossing the lube and condoms into the small bin beside the bedside table before climbing off the bed to dig through his own luggage.
Tony would have been grateful for anything: a supply closet, a meeting place for naughty librarians, or a holding cell for the dimwits who never pay their library fines. Instead, he found a man and
“As it happens, I have a date for the occasion,” Steve told him, though his self-satisfied smirk faltered as Tony polished off his burger and started sucking his fingers clean. When had he last enjoyed a meal that much?
“I, uh,” Steve stammered, suddenly caught with one foot in his old insecurities again. “I don’t know—”
Tony only managed to flutter his eyelashes before his heavy eyelids closed again. “‘m tired,” Tony mumbled on a weak breath. “You ‘kay, Steve?”
“Counter offer,” Tony said with a grin, as if he’d expected Steve to try to get out of studying all along. “Since we reviewed the material already, why don’t we have a quiz?” he wondered. “Something… maybe more motivating than your other tests.”
“Two breaks: one in his ankle, one in his foot,” Steve confirmed grimly, and Tony could only shake his head in dismay. “He wants to stay, but, there isn’t much we can do about it.”
So whenever it was absolutely necessary, Tony traveled for work alone like some hopeless schmuck. There was nothing he disliked more about his life choices than the networking, and to do it without Steve at his side was worse still. Now and then he’d get lucky and meet some people closer to his age, people he could connect to more easily. But more often than not, the old wrinkly cads he had to mix and mingle with were middle aged at best. He hadn’t thought much about it at first - after all, he’d always been too young for his peers, whether in boarding school, college, or graduate school. By extension, why should his career be any different?
Tony swept in like the cool customer he was, and he didn’t stop moving until he found the relative safety of the non-fiction section on the second floor. He grabbed a book off a display and pretended to leaf through it to blend in.
Flowers or his boyfriend, surprising him by flying back early to see him? Steve laughed at the question and pressed in closer to kiss away the shy embarrassment in Tony’s expression.
After a lifetime of wondering how or if he’d ever break away out of Howard’s shadow, his conversation with Normark had been a wake-up call in more ways than one.
“Thank you for tonight,” Tony said as they emerged into chilly the night time air, and he stretched to kiss Steve’s cheek. “I really enjoyed that game.”
Tony laughed before he could stop himself, then quickly hid his face against Steve’s chest where he barely contained his laughter into quiet giggling.
Steve wasn’t sure what was going on until the passenger side window rolled down and he heard Happy’s familiar voice call his name. Steve crouched just enough to peer in through the window. “Happy? Where’s Tony, shouldn’t you be with him?”
“Ven aquí, niña, que preciosa,” Tony murmured softly to her in encouragement where she sat mostly pressed against Steve’s arm. He rubbed her head and neck gently, trying to coax her closer and close enough to get into it with the other playing puppies.
“We’ve been together ten years,” she said, starting the story from the very beginning. “He’d only started his company then. We married the next year, after he’d made his first ten million. Money was the most important thing to him, then; he didn’t have it easy growing up, and sometimes, when he’d had enough to drink, he’d tell me he was afraid I’d leave if he had no money… it didn’t matter how many times I reminded him I’d met him before the money, how it didn’t matter. When I got pregnant with Nora he finally started to think about his drinking as a problem. He didn’t want to become like his father. And when he’s there, he is such a good father,” she added with a bittersweet smile.
“Could,” Steve mumbled, struggling to form words. He wouldn’t look Tony in the eyes, but not that it mattered. Tony couldn’t stop staring. Steve was partially covered in bandages around his left shoulder and his torso, and what skin was visible looked bruised and burned all over. A constellation of scab wounds marred his chest. Tony could only comfort himself by consciously reminding himself of how superficial they seemed.
“Pipe down,” Steve growled at him, rubbing the lube warm on his fingers. “Mom’s never caught me before, she’s not catching me now. Do you need a sock?”
Had Steve really gone his whole life thinking he’d experienced love without being seen the way Tony saw him?
make the call,” Bucky sighed and stepped away to do exactly that. Steve might have argued or told him off, but it wasn’t as if Bucky was wrong. He could make the call as easily as Steve, and they weren’t exactly swimming in alternative leads.
While still sulking in his hospital bed, Steve rolled his eyes and snippily asked, “It’s not with you, is it?”
Steve was tall for a diver, but he was limber and he was graceful. Even from the balcony seats the diving platform looked much, much too high for any reasonable person to jump off of, and Steve did it
“Who’s that?” Tony wondered, and from the window, they could see him stop walking in the general direction of Steve’s apartment. “Is this a bad time?”
In turn, Maria told Steve that his first hunch about the financial records had turned up something important after all. In his absence, they’d found evidence of handsome compensation for both sex workers in question.
“You know,” Tony called to him, “I was gonna say, you look damn handsome this morning, but right now you look kinda goofy.”
“Now will you come back to sleep?” Tony wondered, pulling him down a little more insistently. “I can’t really sleep like this, not with you hovering.”
At Steve’s first touch, Tony pushed and grunted until he could stretch out on the bed with his head in Steve’s lap.
“Tony Stark! Urgent salutations, my friend, I must speak with you. I received communication from Dr. Moses da Graça—”
“I don’t know,” Steve shrugged easily, smiling at Tony without a care in the world. “You picked the stop, and you picked the destination. I’m following your lead.”
“Here you are, Steve,” Tony murmured softly, handing Steve a towel and a strange, egg-colored helmet that Steve would have expected in the NFL. Was this a 21st century fantasy of Tony’s that he hoped to live out now that he had a larger man to role play with? Clearly, the man was kinkier than Steve had imagined, but if that got him going, Steve could roll with it. Blitz the neutral zone with a Hail Mary, or something like that.
“That’s fair. What if it’s a threeway with Rachel and Daniel?” Steve wondered curiously. “Does that count as one or two?”
The reason for Rhodey’s concern became clear the moment Tony slid out of the saddle. He landed on unsteady legs, and seemed to stand upright through sheer will-power alone. By the time he wove and wobbled his way to the edge of the enclosure around, Steve was waiting for him, quick to put his arm around him and help lead Tony away from the thrilled, drunk crowd.
“I admit your tweeting privileges were not on my mind at the time,” Steve drawled, and with a hopeful expression held the phone out to Tony in an unspoken request. Tony stared at him for a beat before rolling back to his pillow and leaving Steve to handle the conversation solo.
Bruce kept to his side of the office for the whole affair. There he could distance himself from Tony and this Captain America farce without being rude. In difference to Tony, Bruce studiously maintained the hope that absolutely nothing was out of the ordinary.
“I show two stopped codes at Cryo-Prison X23-5,” the gentle voice of the computer informed them over the stuttering sound of the Warden’s failing heartbeat. “Harold Hogan, Warden. Severe injury. Do you wish to assign a medic?“
“What will the show be?” he asked, a little breathless in his excitement. “Am I—will they be fucking me? I’ve never; I mean, not that many, not at the same time—”
Warning: the religious laws of Qatar outlaw homosexuality, and the brutal punishment for that is (briefly) mentioned.
Tony hopped out of the truck and got to work. Five posts to be replaced and three wires to patch. He was out of practice and, despite what he liked to believe, was at a physical disadvantage.
With a sigh of defeat, he slumped down in his chair and reached into the pocket of his sweatpants for some relief. This was a library, people were studying all around him, and he should be, too - he had no interest in religious studies, and that made it so much more difficult to absorb the details. Broad strokes wouldn’t cut it, the professor had told them that she considered every word in the textbook fair game. It didn’t matter that providence by cock would never be relevant to his life again, he still had to know it inside and out.
“I’ve missed you and your kisses all day,” Steve confessed as they parted for breath, and he could feel Tony smiling happily in return.
Steve and a handful of brave New Yorseylvanian peace officers arrived in time to see masses of museum patrons fleeing the Governor’s compound.
“Wait, Steve—stop, stop talking,” he whispered urgently, and before Steve regretted staring at him in surprise, Tony took him gently by the chin and made sure to look Steve in the eye. “Intense and rough is not the same as abuse or disrespect. I’ve always known exactly what to expect with you, or you’ve checked in with me. That’s not hurting me, Steve, that is some hot, kinky sex I don’t want to stop. So if you’re dead set on worrying about anything, worry about not giving me enough of it.”
The plan was going well until the second night when his mom stumbled home around 2am and found him in the same chair at the kitchen table as when she’d left to work much earlier the day prior.
“It never became relevant,” Steve eventually said with a shrug. It was the most direct and honest answer Tony had ever gotten, and he was at a loss for what to say. When he turned back around, Steve looked caught between a rock and a hard place.
“And you’re sure he’s a good dude?” Rhodey asked even as he scrolled through his contacts for Carol’s number. “We can trust him?”
Of course, the moment Steve turned to Coulson and asked if he wanted to take Tony’s place Tony changed his mind. Nobody was going to squirm against his future husband’s body but
“Are you trying to kill me, child?” she demanded, smacking him when he tried to come in for a hug. “You work all day, you call your snacks a lunch—”
Jane’s eyes grew to be the size of saucers, and she covered her mouth with both hands before a peep of excitement escaped her.
“Tony, you,” he choked out, but he could get no further, and all around him Tony could hear echoes of feet rushing and chairs scraping across the floor outside their private room in the restaurant. Any second they’d be interrupted by people who knew better.
“An open secret when you start in this industry is that if you look different enough, they have to tailor your clothes for the jobs you do. And since it won’t fit anyone else after that, you get to keep them,” Tony started to say, half to the audience, and half to Graham. “Me, I happen to be average in every way - you pick up a medium shirt anywhere in the world and it will fit me. Everything, except my, uh, my ‘rear,’ as you put it. It is the only reason that suit hangs in my closet now. So, at least it’s not just along for the ride, it’s earning its keep, too.”
“And you think I won’t?” Sarah drawled, smiling up at Steve with the smug confidence of a woman who had already won. “What do you say, Tony?”
A dangerous spark of excitement gave an edge to the man’s gaze, and Steve stood there spluttering internally as the man openly ogled him from head to toe.
“Well-written shitstorm,” Steve corrected mildly, and Tony huffed in amusement. “Your timing is great. It’s been five days and no peep on the case, this can only help. I appreciate it, Tony.”
Even in the darkness of the late evening, Steve could see color rising in the boy’s cheeks from embarrassment. Taobe was a tall boy, but he couldn’t have been more than sixteen, so when all he could do was gape back at Steve in momentary shock, Steve took a knee so that Taobe would no longer have to look up at him.
The judge waved him up, and Tony walked up with the prenup, the birth certificate, and her license. He explained what the judge was looking at, what implications it had on the case and the prenuptial agreement.
Of the eight clocks left, Steve reached five. Radio jammers from World War II were operational all around the city, and they bought him precious time, but it was still - in so many ways - a race against the clock. Steve had anticipated Scorpius would notice his interference, but how Scorpius understood that Steve had discovered the triggering mechanism in time to find a way around the jammers was beyond him.
The Governor stared back at Steve in displeased silence, but beside him, Tony looked ready to cry from the shock of Steve’s anger. Steve couldn’t stand to look at either of them.
,” Tony reminded him, but angry and stressed as he was, he still came around the couch to kiss his own husband good-bye.
“You’ll do what?” the other voice growled, and Steve could hear the shuffling of popcorn, clothes, and then the grateful creaking of a seat as whoever Tony had picked a fight with got to his feet.
Without a look back at Tony and his horse, Steve turned the key in the ignition. He knew what he had to do.
“Then let’s begin with you,” Steve said in a gentler voice, “do you receive any threatening letters or messages from—”
“This is Tony Stark,” he said into the phone, already pressing two fingers against his other ear to hear the caller better.
“Can you blame me? Watching you work—you know how hard it is to jerk off in jeans and with cut-up hands?”
“I think the audience is too busy staring to laugh, Tony,” Graham observed in a grave whisper, and everyone, Tony included, laughed.
And that’s what Steve did, letting it all out in one rushed confession. “I worked really hard to get into law school—I gave up a good job, turned down the best parties, even blew off Spring Break to study for the LSATs, all so I could get my boyfriend Brock back and now he’s engaged to this awful woman Sharon so it was all for nothing! I wish I’d never come to Harvard.”
Tony burst out laughing. “What!” he cried between the laughter, clinging as Steve shifted to try to see him until he finally calmed to mad giggling and he could look at Steve’s blushing, handsome face without starting to laugh again. “Sorry not sorry, babe, it’s just—‘then’ you started over-thinking? You ‘narrowed it down’ to five rings
“With Thor’s help, we’ll go out and find people to date. Subjects. Decent, regular people; people our readers can relate to. We’ll see how we can manipulate each: for borrowing money, or getting copies of their house-keys. We’ll monopolize their time for ten days, to show how easy it is to begin isolating them from their friends and family. Warning signs that could save our readers.”
“Sorry, library,” were the first words out of his mouth, while Tony was busy making demands on his end of the line.
The warrior looked down at Stephanie in confusion, but she did not dawdle over the decision for too long. With a last glance at Clint, Tony, and Stephanie, she decided, “We take them all.”
Tony shut his mouth immediately before more protests poured out of him, but he still levelled an unimpressed look at his husband-to-be. Steve watched him with a gleeful triumph until he felt Tony had repented enough.
Tony sat back on his haunches, and even with the gloves, he managed to get Steve’s jeans unbuttoned and tugged down just enough to reveal his briefs. He pulled down the waistband of his underwear inch for inch, until Steve’s already hard and leaking cock had enough space to pop out of its confines.
For some time, Tony didn’t move. Steve blinked at him, finally managing to turn his head so he could see Tony better, but Tony still struggled with Steve’s request.
The display indicated that the canister was more than 50 percent filled. A decent load, but nothing particularly noteworthy.
“Think about it! The most recent book came out about a month ago,” Steve spoke firmly over Bucky’s obvious blindsided anger. “Maybe Kline thought he was going to have a part in the book because of what he did for Tony? When it doesn’t, he feels betrayed. He’s been taken advantage of and he loses it.”
“I’m good, my meetings are in the afternoon today,” Tony assured him with a smile, and he moved to the armchair he’d somehow squeezed into his tiny office. “It’s good to hear your voice, sugar, how’s your morning been?”
Steve’s face warmed with a smile of relief, and Tony felt a weight lifting from his chest at the thought that his support had been part of giving Steve that level of satisfaction. They would go to Pierce’s offices, Steve would learn that he was wrong, and at the end of the day Tony will have served him well because Steve could finally be confident that his steward would always support him.
When Tony rebuilt the tower after the Battle of New York, he gave each Avenger their own floor. As more heroes joined the team in the years that followed, Tony threw himself into the challenge of expanding the private apartments and the common areas with gusto. Or he had, until he realized Bucky felt alone and uncomfortable in this new world, Pietro and Wanda didn’t like being apart, and Vision didn’t seek worldly possessions.
The thought of where he’d last seen her left Steve shuddering with disgust, but there was no way to avoid her. From the top of the stairs, he cleared his throat and asked, “Are you looking for me?”
He continued begging and fighting the urge to seek friction against the plush cushions when finally -
“Gentlemen, please,” Dr. Odinson said in an effort to rein in the conversation. Neither Steve nor Tony paid him any attention.
“I am accessing the Cryo-Prison’s morning hearing schedule, sir,” Tony interrupted him to say, his fingers flying over the keypad as he rushed to find the answers he needed. Let Fury carry him away if he wanted to stop him. “Almost there, sir.”
“Professor Hawley, I’m not sure I follow,” he tried, doing his best to politely signal his discomfort without seeming ungrateful.
When the third man stepped up for his turn, the audience around them was dead silent. He notched his arrow, took a steadying breath, and nailed it. Perfect bullseye. He had enough decency to glance at Tony for a moment before plucking the next arrow out of his quiver, and Steve must have rubbed off on him more than Tony had realized, because in the moment he found it easy to give the stranger a nod of encouragement to continue.
“I—I like everything,” Steve said quietly, still silently praying they’d just get to the house without vaulting the car or hitting a cow. “Red velvet is fine.”
“Don’t make promises you can’t keep,” Tony warned him, laughter still warm in his voice. “I don’t like liars.”
It was remarkable how quickly Steve’s infatuation was threatening to burst from his chest, how desperately he needed someone to remind him that he hadn’t known Tony a week yet. He didn’t know the man, he only knew his writing. It didn’t make them friends, and it certainly didn’t mean they would grow to be more.
007 was less of a success. He managed to get Lucy away from Vargas long enough to drive her off a cliff in a high-speed car chase. Tony couldn’t even be mad. Clearly, Bond had made an effort to get his car back, and Lucy’s waterproof engine made it possible for him to escape uninjured from the depths of Rio Buranhém.
“Oh, dear,” Bond snickered in undertone, clearly making an effort to communicate without being overheard. “I like you, is your mouth this filthy in person?”
He took a firm grip of Tony’s top leg, and with a casual display of his strength that had tension and desire coiling somewhere deep and filthy within Tony, Steve lifted Tony’s thigh until his knee practically rested on his arm, opening his body up for Steve’s taking. His grip was strong, and it never wavered; he tirelessly held Tony in position, and it was only the softly whispered curses that gusted against Tony’s lips that showed him how affected Steve was despite his outward composure.
“Thanks, but I have enough friends helping me, Tony,” Steve replied, doing his best to stick to the facts. “If next week is bad, I can call you? Cliff wants to take me to lunch my first day, but I’ll be home by six. I know that’s late for you, but I can call Tuesday at lunch—”
“It’s thin, but worth ruling out. I’ll make the call,” Steve said and reached for his phone, but his phone was already ringing in his hands. Tony was calling.
Tony’s pinched look of irritation fell apart as he openly stared. “What—wha—I, I said seven, I thought you’d be naked. Uh, ready! Steven. Wait, that’s not your costume, is it?” he asked in minor alarm.
“It was good stuff!” Tony insisted, visibly struggling to keep his hands to himself. “Steve, please. I was careful—there was nothing unflattering—and you, you got picked up by LA.”
With his lips obediently closed, Steve still hummed against the base of Tony’s cock. Tony groaned softly and glanced down in time to catch Steve winking slyly back at him before ducking his head.
“The Notorious RBG,” Tony read off the cover with a pleasantly surprised smile. “Seriously? You come here for people to read to your dog?”
Tony pursed his lips in a clear effort not to pout. “Easy for you to say,” he muttered mutinously. “You’re even better now, your muscles have new muscles
“I know it can be smaller. I was almost there, I could feel it, I could see it in the math—I could see it, but I couldn’t do it. I’d pushed it as far as I could bringing quantum mechanics and relativity together, but it wasn’t enough. Of course, I couldn’t show Howard, it’s too easy to weaponize. So, I reached out to CERN. They invited me to try again at their facilities, and I took my prototype with me. That was two months ago,” Tony finished with a quiet voice, then he reached into his back pocket to pull out his phone. Without a word, he laid it on the table between them and nudged it closer to Steve.
Tony’s relief was twisted in his confusion, but before he had a chance to make further guesses, Steve carried him back to the machine where he lowered Tony down on a narrow padded bench. It was longer than it was wide, with just enough real estate to balance on, but as Steve adjusted the frame Tony was strapped down by his wrists and thighs that held him firmly in place.
“What is that?” Bruce wondered, only loud enough for Tony to hear. Tony glanced at his partner, then took another quick look at the map. He’d been looking at the same part of the city only minutes earlier.
“It’s not ‘The Good Stuff’, man, but it’s some gooooood stuff,” Steve sighed happily, and he leaned as far to center as his seatbelt allowed so he could bat his lashes at Tony obnoxiously. Again, Tony smacked him and even shoved him back to his own side of the car, but Steve gleefully noted the tiny hint of a smile hidden beneath Tony’s grumpy exterior.
“Not really,” Steve managed through gritted teeth. He was finishing his second Sno Ball when it dawned on him that his chills were fading away, which was the same time he realized he’d been shivering since he sat down—maybe even longer. He huddled further into his blanket for warmth, desperate for comfort.
“Captain?” one of the medics said, impatient and stern. “We must move the Lieutenant to the hospital, we have no tick tocks to waste. Either release his gurney, or come with us.”
Steve already had their tickets when they got to the theater, but they got in line so Tony could have his popcorn and drink (diet Coke, no ice) before they walked in to take their seat in the theater. It was first come, first serve, but fortunately the show wasn’t sold out, so they had their pick of seats towards the front of center.
“My medical records, my tax returns. Banner’s grandma’s family recipe for the best homemade pizza dough that even I can make. Really important and personal information, Steve,” Tony finally admitted, lying through his teeth. Sure, those things
“I am not asking to have children with you, Tony,” Steve said more gently, and leaned in closer. “I’m not asking for a commitment. I’m asking for one night, together.”
You guys, this should have been a fun one-off, the flirtation between the hot young footballer and the sports journalist. That didn't want to be written though, and this came out instead. Now, I'm stuck. I'm honestly willing to go on with it, but I've hit a dead end, so I'm posting it here with the other residual stories to see if it resonates with any of you & what you'd like to see out of it, if anything.
“So one day, I get to set, and he’s left a coloring book in my trailer so I can doodle, too. Then, for my birthday, he got me these amazing markers, Copic something? Those colors are liquid velvet, they’re amazing—people sitting next to me on planes think I’m a lunatic everywhere I go now, shading skulls in with blue, purple, and pink all over the place, but that’s even better. Nobody wants to chit-chat with the adult man coloring skulls.”
Steve didn’t remember which of them suggested they become the third pair of the night to marry, or what paperwork they scribbled through or who served as their respective witnesses. But he remembered the look of burgeoning adoration in Tony’s heated gaze, and he remembered them pulling off the highway onto an empty outlook point over the ocean; he remembered the top coming down and them unraveling their clothes between them. He remembered the attentive fingers and eager mouth that drove him to near lunacy, he remembered pushing Tony back and straddling his hips. He moved to the ebb and flow of the ocean waves crashing against the cliffs below, with Tony’s strong, grasping fingers entwined in his to keep him in his place as Steve rode him at his leisure.
“Let me take you for a coffee, Tony,” he said, keeping his voice soft, a gesture of intimacy and a measure of precaution so his voice wouldn’t carry on the wind. “Celebrate the new job. This weekend?”
Sumeet, who had been attentively peering at the nearby giraffe being fed, turned to the group and asked, “Mr. Tony, do giraffes use their horns to fight?”
“No!” Steve rushed to say, and Tony lifted his startled stare from the boxes to Steve. “No—I mean. At least… maybe? Someday,” Steve whispered then, quietly. “It’s… it’s not the endgame anyway, it’s. I mean, that’s—that’s the benefit of being men, right? This—we can choose, choose this for our reasons, not for, for ‘starting a family,’ or whatever. But, for me,” he added, his lips twisting wryly as he tried to get the words out right. “It’s stability. Knowing that... someone wants to stick around. With me.”
“What’s that?” Tony whispered in response to Steve’s predatory growl. Steve was practically incoherent as he moved closer, biting hickeys down Tony’s neck and needfully pawing at his pert ass, and Tony’s body responded in kind even as he tried to make sense of the sudden change of events. “Oh—oh, fuck, you—damn, was that just from—”
Steve’s quiet chuckle was a gentle thrum against Tony’s blanket cocoon. “Really? I had no idea,” Steve teased, stealing a quick, chaste kiss from Tony’s smiling lips before he laid him out in their bed. Tony squirmed a little until he was comfortably on his side, and Steve helped him liberate himself from the blankets.
There was a chance Steve would be impressed by the view, but Tony wouldn’t bet the farm on that. Steve would be more likely to be impressed by the self-cleaning mechanism of the skyscraper’s windows, since that would save workers from risking their lives getting up that high to wash windows.
“I thought I was going crazy,” he said instead, partly vindicated though he was still mostly confused. Knowing that the gorgeous man who regularly came to him in his dreams and left him sated beyond belief was real did not explain who he was, or why he was there.
Steve huffed wryly, but somehow Tony sounded too sincere to brush aside. What was he supposed to say, ‘keep your psychedelic sex helmet away from me?’ Given Tony’s reaction, Steve had no doubt he’d blame himself, as if Tony had in any way known that the ‘sex’ could be harmful, or that Steve suffered from PTSD. After all, their society was so irritatingly peaceful that there was a chance Tony didn’t even know what PTSD was.
“How old is he?” Tony wondered when Seamus pushed his little head into Tony’s hand and wriggled in delight.
While his colleagues were busy trying to process the trauma from witnessing villainy on a scale they had never thought possible, Tony scrubbed at his mouth with the back of his hand and turned back to the terminal monitor. They needed to know who they were dealing with, and Tony only had one hunch on how to find any answers.
“Sometimes, after fucking you,” Steve announced without preamble, and Tony shut up immediately to listen with every cell in his body. “After pulling out, I, uh. I, I have the urge to take you between my hands and stretch you. See what I’ve done to you, to, to see how much you can take. I can’t believe it, sometimes I think, that maybe I’m, I don’t think I would be strong enough, I don’t know how you can take it. You blow my mind, Tony, but I still… I still have this urge to see how much you can take.”
“If you don’t want to be here, get out of the line, asshole,” the stranger waiting behind them said, loud and irritated. She was short, curvy, and beautiful, and Bucky had no comeback.
“They will fit like a dream,” she promised as he lifted them out of the box. “American made—hand made—two tone crocodile and ostrich leather. These are a statement piece that will impress without being too loud.”
game!” he crowed, clinging to Steve as they made their way out of their seats with the rest of the audience, recounting all the excitement that Steve had missed out on as if it wasn’t a sore memory already. “I can’t believe I was here for this! That goal was epic! Lundqvist was great, but holy shit, the defense was like—oh, hey, thank you,” he said with a smile when Steve handed him his Coke. “Do you think they know how good Lundqvist is, and that’s why they never get decent defenders? They—oh,” he frowned then, peering down at the drink in his hand.
Steve looked at the offered Hostess box and at the handsome man offering it to him. He knew better than to say no.
“Thank you for your help, Tony,” Steve whispered as he scribbled out a list for the scientists of things he needed. He snarled at them until they all but ran away to get surveillance equipment and radio jammers ready in a new car for him. “The professionals are on their way, but I feel better. I’m sorry for, for what I did this morning. You deserve better. Good luck with—”
Tony eyed Steve like he couldn’t be sure if this was a joke. He glanced at the pictures for the sake of having done it, but all he could do was shrug. “They look like people that could have appeared at my book signings, sure. He looks like he could have appeared in my bed. But I’ve never seen them before in my life.”
“Yeah, baby, yours, only yours,” Tony promised him. “Feel your eyes on me, Steve… want a show, just for you?”
Except along with the age gap came the conversations about mortgages, mistresses, and marriage roulette. The number of people he’d noticed bonding over their busy schedules juggling fiancees and girlfriends was only outdone by the number of people who’d lost interest in talking to him after realizing he had neither to contribute.
In their effort to leave these cultural differences alone, Steve and Tony had initially grouped the summer solstice with Easter and Christmas. It wasn’t until plans for their wedding came into the fore that they took a second look. Their wedding day would not only be the anniversary of their union, but that of their country. Briefly, they considered modeling the Dutch tradition of King’s day, a nationwide celebration of their king and country, but it was quickly dismissed as a self-aggrandizing effort that did not fit with their intended direction for the kingdom. They were not alone in their effort to lift Consone and its people; to celebrate the unification and their achievements without recognizing the people and local leaders who made it possible felt insulting and wrong.
Without thinking, Steve got to his feet as soon as Tony started getting up. He reached for his wallet and dug out what looked like five twenties for the table. Before Tony could disagree, he was following Steve out the door into fresh air.
It was time for the dawn of another hero, and Steve was confident that no man was better suited to bear the weight of the franchise than Tony Stark.
They watched him separate her from her friends with conversation; they watched her smile and laugh at what he said, and it wasn’t long before she was blushing and tucking a lock of her hair behind her ear.
After several minutes of digging around, all Steve found worth eating in his kitchen was champagne and ice. As tempting as that was, he wasn’t so sure it was appropriate.
Hey Steve, an asshole just got out of his trailer. He’s a big fan of Cap, can we call and say hi? Ok time?
“Steve, Stark’s saying that if we want to meet, we should do it somewhere no-one will recognize us. I mean,” he paused, and Steve could hear a thud in the background. Then, sounding very awkward in his attempt at cryptic-casual, “I mean, why don’t you join us? We’re at Tony’s place, just ...hanging out?”
The man was fighting off a blush, but eventually he managed to speak. “You’re the first American I’ve met in London,” he said, breaking off a small piece of a biscuit. “Do you work around here?”
“Alright, sure, let’s go with that,” Tony said with a note of relief, “but guys, I didn’t think he’d go for it. Couples therapy! This could be a gold mine!”
“I’m not going to beg, Steve,” he finally said. “I know I treated you like shit, even when you continuously treated me with respect. Give me a chance to show you I’m a better person than what you’ve seen these past four days.”
“The dinner and a movie date is classic, boss. You really can’t go wrong,” she said after a while, and this time he looked back at her across the room with an expression that suggested he might believe her. “Tomorrow is Saturday. If you can’t bring him home tonight, invite him home tomorrow for a homemade dinner. Trust me, boss,” she hurried to say to Steve’s sudden look of alarm. “He’ll love it—it’s romantic in a way people can forget to be these days. You’ll stand out.”
“No, you’re good. Nine o’clock on Friday,” she told him before turning to go, only to remember one more detail. “45 Dunston Street.”
“Fine,” Steve finally conceded with a sigh. If this was going to be a serious conversation, he could play along. “What’s your definition of death?”
“Wait—so, what, an hour ago it's pointless, and now all of a sudden it’s foreplay?” Tony teased, sipping his water to clear his throat. “Alright, darling. I'll bite. What’s in it for me?”
“So am I,” Tony replied without the earlier glimpse of mischief. “I’m wealthy, I’m educated, and I’m a white man. I make a living writing books about characters who are not always wealthy, white men who graduated from MIT. You’re not the first person I’ve met who had opinions about me,” he said in a gentler tone of voice. “But you are one of the few who’s been willing to admit it. And if you’re willing to communicate, I’m willing to try.”
“Dr. Jane Foster,” Steve said quietly, picking up a wedge to dab in a pink sauce on Tony’s plate. “I got her to agree to do a TV interview, a ten minute spot. My assistant just called to say Foster’s backing out. Again.”
Taco fucking Bell? Steve could probably do with a dozen or so chalupas, but Pierce had said it with such a grave formality, and, if Tony hadn’t already looked ready to faint, the mention of Taco Bell had nearly done him in. Steve could only stare and nod for some time before he found his voice.
The shrill scream rang through the air like a lovesick bullhorn. Tony turned, slowly and calmly, because after all, he was Tony Stark. Tony Stark laughed in the face of danger.
Tony rolled his eyes with good natured exaggeration. “I wasn’t aware we were co-parenting,” he said with a little snort of amusement. “Next kid, I’ll be sure to ask for your input first. Deal?”
“Yeah, you hear that, Rhodes? Not my Steve, he’ll have a date in two fucking hours,” Bucky chimed in with a vindictive laugh.
was the futurist people counted on to produce perfection. But with Steve it was so easy to just let go.
“Who isn’t?” Bucky wanted to know while Clint groaned about how Natasha was never, ever chaperoning Lila’s dates ever again. Sam offered him the half-finished bottle of vodka for comfort.
Tony hung up the phone, and briefly considered throwing it out the window. But eventually he managed to simply wash his hands, dry them off, and finished going through Steve's medicine cabinet before stepping out of the bathroom.
“And who’s going to cook the meal?” Steve muttered, pushing a hand through his hair. “All I know how to make is breakfast food. What am I going to do, romance him with cinnamon buns?”
“It’s kinda like bootcamp, but for the team. I can’t skip it, and I can’t bring you. It’s only four days, Tony,” he promised, not that it made any more sense now than the other times he had explained it.
“If?” Stephanie echoed with a watery laugh, as if she couldn’t believe what she was hearing. “There is no if, Tony.
“Howard’s in his office, honey,” she whispered, “I don’t give two shits about the money. You look like you make enough, anyhow. But if you think I’ll let you boys run away to do this marriage thing on your own, you’ve got another thing coming.”
Steve averted his eyes and scoffed into his wet, boiled chicken. He chewed even though he wasn’t hungry. He swallowed even though he didn’t want it.
“Thirsty,” Steve explained breathlessly. He tore off the cap and took a long sip before gesturing for Tony to continue. “Go on.”
“Listen, if you want to spend the next five minutes talking about how my husband knocked that role out of the park, or how perceptive and shrewd their amalgam of current and 19th century news is in its reflection of the shameful and senseless actions of our current administration, I am onboard.”
“How much extra? The boyfriend experience, for the night? Twelve thousand?” the man offered casually. “No more than fourteen. The works.”
There was no clear space on the floor for him when he finally made it to the young man’s bed, but Steve balanced carefully on a pair of moist flip flops, a large, scrunched-up towel, and a pair of stained boxers as he reviewed his target.
“Alright, longshot, but I think she’s my friend’s ex,” Tony explained while texting up a storm. Then, with a bashful grin, he added, “Remember Dr. Odinson?”
“Maybe sleep would help?” Steve asked without a hint of irony, and again, Tony nodded. “Okay, good, that’s good. I’ll help you lock up, sweetheart. Let’s get you home.”
“With you,” Steve corrected, more quietly. Then, his expression warmed and a satisfied smirk curled his lips as he added, “Correct me if I’m wrong, but I don’t remember you ever giving up on anything that easily.”
“You asshole,” Tony snickered at the first touch of Steve’s lips. He let his legs fall open at Steve’s sides, so that when Steve lowered himself to lie on top of him, Tony could easily cross his legs over Steve’s back and keep him captive. With an added squeeze to remind his prisoner of his subordinate position, Tony innocently asked, “You mean it? I can choose any ring I want?”
Grateful though he was, there was something discomforting about Tony yielding without a fight. Steve tried not let the thought overwhelm him, so while he rubbed one hand over Tony’s shoulders to distract them both, he reached for the phone at his bedside table to make the necessary calls.
,” Tony glowered under his breath, barely noticing how Steve took him by the arms and gently steered him out of the way of oncoming people.
“Tony, they’re starting an archery contest,” Steve said while Tony tried to covertly spear some of the grilled figs off his plate. “What do you think?”
Clint rolled his eyes and continued with the burgers, covering each patty with slices of sharp cheddar. “Fence finished?” he asked, trying to change the conversation.
Tony could walk into the lobby at any minute and see Steve talking to this asshat old dude who so casually wore a suit that could pay Steve’s dorm fees for a semester. If this really was where sex workers were picked up, this was the last place he’d want Tony to catch him with a rich man with the wrong intentions. He really had wanted to wait to see this new suite with Tony, but the more he needed to get out of this situation, the heavier the key card in his back pocket became.
“Why not? They’re young and attractive, they have low-paying jobs in an expensive city that caters to the wealthy,” Tony reasoned. “If you can get your hands on their membership data going back two and a half years, I’ll put together a program to search for the other victims. They use made-up nicknames on the website, I can’t search for them by their real name or their emails.”
It took Steve a minute to realize what he’d just heard. In a hurry, he scooted closer to Tony and leaned over the barrier to whisper, “How old was she when she signed the prenup?”
They walked out of the building side by side, making their way to the parking structure at a leisurely pace.
Tony shuddered instinctively at such an intimate address, but he swallowed his correction down. Steve had recently been slipping with his formalities, but this was the first time Tony had all his attention to dream about how his name sounded when Steve said it. A world where Steve hadn’t violated his parole and was free to call Tony his, and Tony had not failed to ascend to the privilege of calling anyone his.
“Your client is James Buchanan Barnes,” Steve said with meaning, as if it wasn’t an obvious fact. “I, uh—I don’t know how to say this, but I promise it isn’t about the case. I think your client is my friend,” he tried to explain. “I want to see him, please. As a friend, nothing more.”
Slowly, Tony rolled to the side enough so he could see Steve. He hadn’t turned the lights on or pulled the curtains aside to let the sunlight in, but there was still enough light in the room for him to see Steve looking like a dream in his dress blues.
Who reached for whom first was a mystery - Tony launched himself at Steve at the same time as Steve grabbed him by his suit jacket and hauled him into a hungry, biting kiss. He palmed at Tony like he hadn’t held his boyfriend in months rather than days, and soon he crouched enough to get his arms around Tony’s thighs and lifted Tony into his arms. Tony wrapped his legs around Steve’s waist, rolling his hips up against Steve’s firm abs with such fervent interest that Steve had to pull off his lips to gulp down air.
Cursing and praying by turns, Tony cut off the trail to follow her, doing his best to keep her in sight without tripping on rocks, running into trees, or stepping on some small, unsuspecting animal.
Tony was still shell-shocked, so it was Clint who stepped up to ask, “Mom, can we see some proof of life for Steve?”
“They’re made here in Brooklyn,” he explained when Bucky had been silent for a little too long. “You don’t—if you don’t think she’ll like it, you don’t have to, you know—don’t feel obligated, it’s okay—”
“Queen Sarah came to power under different circumstances, and Terrini was a different place. Mächtingen do not expect us to, to rub elbows with them at a Christmas market. There will be knives and alcohol, if it gets dangerous—”
“You emptied me this morning, pet,” Steve warned him, pulling Tony off his cock by a firm grip of his hair. “Breathe. Be gentle. Open,” he added then, and rubbing his index finger wet over the saliva dripping from Tony’s swollen bottom lip. Eager and obedient, Tony let his mouth fall open, and holding his mouth open with his fingers, Steve eased Tony’s mouth over his hardening cock like a glove.
“Did you see T’Challa?” Tony wondered, settling into his pillow and blankets to listen. “Was he helpful?”
Steve brought his hands up to cradle Tony’s face ever so gently. Even when all he wanted was to watch Tony with his dopey smile, Steve continued to brush his fingers softly Tony’s hair.
“I don’t know what to tell you,” the man admitted after a beat. “You’re talking to the wrong dude. I moved up here years ago with my woman who was starting business school, then she brings home a plastic surgeon. ‘I met someone,’ she said,” he said with a roll of his eyes. “‘Move out.’ And we’d just gotten here so I didn’t have a job at the time, so I had to.”
“Hey, Tony?” he called, holding up a canvas bag in Tony’s direction. “This had your name on it in the kitchen, I think it’s your lunch.”
Tony huffed a laugh but followed Steve’s lead without resistance. “Even if I could, I’m pretty sure you’d have to do all the work.”
Sure, Tony understood what Steve meant if he thought about it rationally. He just didn’t understand it when he thought about it every other way.
When he got to the 17th floor, Bucky was already waiting for him in the elevator lobby. They ran at each other, each pulling the other into a strong embrace from either direction. For the first time in over twenty years, they were inseparable again.
“Listen, speaking of future,” Tony said then, pursing his lips as he struggled to find the right words. “What are you comfortable sharing about your past?”
Bucky stepped into the apartment even though he wanted to leave. Whatever he said next, he knew his biggest problem would be keeping Steve from doing something reckless.
As expected, Steve was talking on the phone, even pacing in his agitation. Tony put the tray down and turned to leave as quietly as he’d come.
From somewhere deep in his mortified soul, Steve whined, loud and plaintive, and face-planted in the crook of Tony’s neck, seeking comfort in his warmth. Privately, he indulged in the buoyant affection in Tony’s laugh, and the way Tony wound both arms around Steve’s neck and held him close.
“You’d think their eyes would fall out for all the staring,” Maria muttered from Steve’s side. She never reminded him that she was intentionally keeping him company or otherwise noted how frustrating it all was. She wasn’t the type to need recognition for a job she’d set out to do. Steve did his best to focus on her and adopt her easy nonchalance in the face of all the unwanted attention.
“I bet it’d be a memorable way to start your defense, letting Dum-E make everyone a smoothie,” Steve said with a smile, but he shook the thought away and leaned in to press a kiss to Tony’s forehead. “Presentation first. The videos I have of Dum-E’s work are on the computer. What else do you need, sweetheart? What can I do?” Steve asked. “Have you eaten?”
“You can handle it,” she promised. “In fact, here are the two cakes; go through them, find the ingredients. If it’s not here, it’s in either fridge. I’ve got other business to sort out, but I’ll be back in half an hour, so you just get us started on all three, alright?”
Tony grinned to himself and shook his head slowly. “Then why don’t we grab the ice, and you show me to your bedroom?”
But as he passed Professor Hawley as he made his way to the young redhead, the professor held out a hand to stop him.
“God it’s fucking cold—come in, detective. Want a drink?” he called over his shoulder as he led the way into his home. Steve shut the door behind him, but he followed at a more subdued pace.
Steve zoned out of what sounded like a well-practiced speech. Where was their food? He kept casting glances around them, hoping to catch a server with food that looked like his mountain of vegetarian tacos, but nobody seemed to be coming their way. Instead, he started to appreciate the view instead. The glass dome of Taco Bell really did give them a view for miles around, and while the exotic trees were indistinct under the cover of darkness, the lights were breathtaking. Unlike the harsh, unnatural city lights Steve had learned to associate with the future the first time he came out of the ice, this city looked like a fairy tale. It glowed, warm and inviting. He realized quickly that the cars of the future didn’t have headlights, but they emanated a gentle glow themselves, lighting the immediate area around them in every direction as they zipped past each other.
Steve looked at Tony in his genuine surprise, half expecting him to look embarrassed or guilty. Tony wasn’t either, though even in the street light, Steve could see him blushing.
Steve shook his head and only tried to hold him closer. He pressed a loving kiss to Tony’s temple and his hair, unbothered by the clusters of dust and dirt clumped into his greasy hair. “You protected our people,” Steve told him softly, almost in apology. “I should have been here with you, Tony. It should have been me.”
“Go to your meeting, do your job,” Steve growled hoarsely against Tony’s neck as Tony shuddered against the bookshelf and mewled his pleasure. “Whatever else you do, think of me.”
“I can’t do this,” Steve told Tony, because what else could he say? I can’t take advantage of you. I can’t lie to you. I can’t tell you how selfishly I’ve abused your trust.
Without so much as a warning, Tony got up and straddled Steve’s hips, sinking into his lap and circling his arms around Steve’s shoulders to wrap their bodies together in the blanket’s comforting weight. Steve’s hands instinctively found Tony’s hips, his fingers curling protectively around him in a gentle grip. He didn’t squeeze or move Tony in any way, and there was something about his inclination to be protective rather than possessive that made Tony heart skip a beat.
“He said, you’d have to pay your own citations,” Bruce translated quietly while Tony sluggishly smirked up at Steve. “Five credits amounts to many luxuries, Steve Rogers.”
“I read the YouTube comments,” Steve mumbled, his words slurring noticeably after his fifth shot of tequila. “You and Channing look really happy together.”
After weeks of diligent harvesting and fucking, Tony’s body knew what Steve wanted from him. Shameless and eager for his first orgasm in hours, Tony responded to Steve’s touch like a flame exposed to oxygen. Passion burned through his body, and once Steve wrapped his hand around Tony’s cock to stroke him off while fucking him with the canister, he came hard on the fourth stroke, filling nearly the whole canister with his first orgasm of the morning and coating his chest with long ropes of come.
“Sugar babies can be muscular,” Tony said, a touch defensive, but it was Natasha who shrugged their concerns off the best.
Steve bit his lip to keep from laughing and quickly brought his hand up to cup over Tony’s mouth. Tony only grinned up at him at first, but it wasn't long before they were both laughing about it.
The tense lines of Steve’s expression softened with Tony’s admission. It was the closest he had come to telling Steve how badly he loved him in return, and Tony felt himself grow giddy at how easily Steve understood him.
Three hours turned into three and a half, and it was nearly nine o’clock when Steve finally made his way up to his suite. A part of him felt terribly wasteful for sleeping at a hotel in the same city as his own amazing bed back home; staycations with Tony were one thing (splurging felt reasonable then), but this time it was only him. Steve didn’t care for opulence and majesty. The Plaza couldn’t compete with the bedsheets at home that still smell like Tony, and for all its glamour, it couldn’t hold a candle to the home they shared with all Tony’s touches and belongings that still made Steve smile in their days apart.
Tony slanted a considering look his way. “Sometimes love isn’t enough,” he said with a sigh, wringing the steering wheel and adjusting in his seat. “She wanted us to be together: raise a family, a life. Maybe some goats. She just didn’t want to do it in the City.”
The sound of boots filled the hallway through the open door. Medical evac was there. Did it matter anymore? Steve was Bond. Tony’s Steve was James Bond.
“Well, yeah,” Tony answered easily, as if it wasn’t a remarkable matter; as if Steve was being weird for thinking it was remarkable in the first place. Then, he changed the subject by saying, “She said the cars are that way, come on. We’ve got a long drive.”
Steve made his way there through the pouring rain only to realize he had never seen Caffe Italia during a lunch rush before. The space was overrun, every table (even the ones squeezed into awkward corners) occupied. Even after all the time it took for Steve to wait in line for his coffee and his biscuits, there was still a body in every seat around the little cafe. Apparently, nobody felt the need to face the awful downpour so that Steve could have a seat and take a moment for himself to recover.
Under the guise of settling his head more comfortably, Tony twisted in Steve’s arms to see him better. As was his preference (and Tony’s preference, too), Steve avoided clothes to the extent that he could. So as Tony settled there were no layers between them to obscure the long, bold lines of Steve’s neck, or the wide, graceful sweep of his clavicle. It didn’t matter how often Tony looked his fill, Steve always managed to take his breath away. Tony had seen Steve grow from a sweet college student who was still learning about himself and the world, into this fundamentally good, kind man who showered him with affection and love every day. A thoughtful man, a humble man; Tony’s faithful shield against the storm.
Steve never heard his phone ring, but the vibrations eventually caught his attention. He shoved his latest pint at Bucky and excused himself to answer it in the relative silence outside.
He could feel his heart stuttering in his panic, and if Tony didn’t know any better, he’d be convinced the pieces of his dead, miserable computer were living out their next lives somewhere in his arteries, punishing him with his every breath for recklessly overworking them. Any minute now, they would reach his heart and tear it to ribbons and Tony would spill out of his chair and curl up on the speckled linoleum floor that hadn’t been vacuumed since Steve last visited, and die like a poisoned insect.
“I’m trying to say I haven’t been entirely honest with you, Tony,” Steve managed to confess, his voice breaking on the word ‘entirely.’ “You, you may have heard about my mom, Lois Lane.”
“Tranquility?” Steve echoed in quiet disbelief. “I relived the war, my worst nightmares, the week-long trail of bodies leading to Rumlow’s arrest—I felt nothing else for a hundred and forty-seven years,” Steve told him in slow, measured words. “You think you did me a favor? I was trapped in my body for over a century, all for doing my job. ”
“I’m a realist,” Tony said, sensible as ever, but he didn’t linger on the thought. “Whatever, we should start looking for somewhere to sleep. It will be morning soon.”
If bed sharing was expected of him, this terrible night was going to take a turn for the even worse.
On instinct, Steve took two quick, shuffling steps back. Tony might be comfortable with the big grey horse, but Steve needed one hand on the front door to feel even marginally safer.
“Darling?” Tony asked then, genuinely concerned this time. “Hey, Steve, are you alright? Is,” he paused, struggling momentarily with how to phrase his question. “We don’t have to do this; we never need to do this.”
The sun was still high in the sky, but the three of them saw clearly in the distance how the buildings and lights in Lumine came back to life all at once. Something about it felt like a victory, and as Bucky clapped Steve gently on the back, Steve could feel the tension in his chest ease. Every minute brought him closer to his husband, and Steve needed him like he needed his own heartbeat. He needed to see that Tony was alive, and together they would fix this. Together, there was nothing they couldn’t do.
“Buses run to the city all the time, Tony, don’t worry about it,” Steve promised, his fond smile warm in his voice. “I’ll head out around nine. We still have two hours.”
Steve blushed and looked down at the big silver S on his chest again, as if a man with a body so perfect had any right to be shy about it. “I think he said he liked the costume?”
Tony sat on the floor in the center of his cell, his hands tied behind his back around a pole buried deep in the ground. He glanced up when she walked into the cell, but rather than returning Stephanie’s smile or expressing any excitement to see her, he looked stricken by the sight of her, and immediately turned away.
“Steve? You awake?” he murmured hesitantly against Steve’s chest later that night. Steve stirred against him and stretched as he settled, but he vaguely mumbled something in the affirmative.
“You wanna touch him you gotta go through me first, pal,” Bucky glowered, but it was Tony who snatched up one of the smaller rocks around them and hurled it at the man threatening Steve’s person so freely.
Steve had already lost count of how many mornings he’d slept in and missed his train, and subsequently  gotten to his classroom with only fifteen minutes to spare.
Tony blinked at him. He hadn’t turned the lights on when they came in, and it took a moment too long for him to realize Steve meant the light coming in through the windows. He rushed across the room to pull down the blinds for the two windows of his studio, then pulled the curtains shut for good measure.
Clint slowed his pace, and together they peered at every reflecting surface and inspected every solid-looking shape in the dark to see if it could serve them as cover in the daytime. The sun had all but fully crested the horizon when they finally stumbled into some good fortune: a dry, uninhabited cave. Tony reached into his little satchel, and with the help of his flint, grease saved from fishes and water-snakes, and pieces of his old curtains, he cobbled together a little torch to help guide them through the cave safely.
“He had nothing to do with this,” Hammer said in a bored tone, “there, happy? I did your job for you, you’re welcome. Speaking of jobs, I gave you something to do yesterday. Have you done it?”
“A legal education means you will learn to speak in a new language,” she began, “You will be taught to achieve insight into the world around you, and to sharply question what you know. The seats you inhabit will be yours for the next nine months of your life. Enjoy it. Those of you in the front row, beware.”
“Tony, I’m trying to tell you I have feelings for you!” Steve raised his voice to interrupt the greatest hits of Tony’s biggest fears. “I, I have liked you for a long time, I thought it was—it was fondness or a weird next level friendship, but, but...”
A few minutes later, Steve caught up to Tony on the porch. He had pulled on his boots, and he was lingering on the first step of the porch with a mess of rope in his hands. Steve couldn’t quite tell what the rope was for, but the way Tony was tying it up had him momentarily spellbound. The effect wore off when Tony brought two fingers to his mouth and whistled twice quickly in succession, two similarly long, high-pitched notes.
For a short time, only silence answered him. Then, little by little, Tony became aware of a whispering sound cutting through the darkness from above.
“Guess he wants to look a little more special for the first date,” Sharon supposed, shrugging to herself and glancing Steve’s way as she asked, “It’s been five months for you and Tony, hasn’t it?”
have evidence of was Steve. Steve had come a long way from that unremarkable afternoon in Australia when he confessed how he felt. Like everything else, he’d taken on the challenge of pleasing Tony with dedicated enthusiasm, trying anything twice and leaving no suggestion unexplored. The least Tony could do was recognize his effort.
The doors burst open as Bucky and Sam elbowed each other through the door, marching in their hurry to get to Steve first without running like losers. Thor and the rest of the Superbro Caucus trailed in behind them, filling the bar and gathering around Steve and Carol’s stools like a broclipse, or a Superbro Curtain that obscured Steve and Carol from the rest of the bar.
“Sir, whatever opinion you have of me,” he told Howard in the brief silence, “I don’t need fame to know my contribution to society and to our future.”
“I am ever so sorry, Lieutenant Anthony E. Stark, but the venerable Governor Alexander E. Pierce is not here for your unannounced visit. I do not think I can access him at this time.”
With a firm pinch of his fingers, the student squeezed around the base of Tony’s cock to stave off the inevitable and used his free hand to press two more fingers into his ass. Between the smooth and slow constant massage of his prostate and the two fingers fucking into his ass, Tony had lost all control of his body. Drool spilled down his chin from his open, panting mouth and his body jerked forward with every thrust of the alien’s fingers, powerless as he was to brace himself anymore. When three fingers became four, Tony only had the energy to mewl pitifully at the added stretch, spewing incomprehensible words begging for release.
“Fine,” Fury said impatiently. “The government won’t work faster than that anyway. In two weeks you’re either married, or you are resigned.”
A glimmer of excitement returned to Tony's expression as he remembered his new discovery over the weekend. “Thank you for recalling my joy-joy feelings, my friend. In fact, I received a most thoughtful gift from my dear friend Virginia Potts containing the cinematic archive discs from the 21st. This gift has helped reverse the profound sadness from when I regrettably finished my collection featuring the incomparable actor, Jackie Chan. I now continue my tutelage under the delightfully reckless and invigorating Jason Statham.”
They said goodbye to Dum-E, shut down the lab, and made it back to Tony’s dorm room within the hour. Tony’s energy was fading fast, and Steve helped Tony to his desk. He left Tony sitting there for a few minutes while he filled up the tub and dug through Tony’s closet for clean linens. With all the practice of growing up with a nurse for a mother, Steve managed to pull the bedsheets off Tony’s bed and get fresh sheets down before the water levels became dangerously high.
“No, oye mami, voy a colgar,” he whispered into his phone in a rush, hurrying to get off the phone while Steve got comfortable in his seat. “Este chico es guapisimo. Sí—ciao, mami.”
Steve’s lips twisted in a snarl that was more of a pout, but he trailed after Tony dutifully for lack of a better option. Tony seemed to have a plan, and he’d jumped into the worst of it first: foundations, aka underwear.
Tony didn’t have to say more for Steve’s gaze to stray in search of his blue ribbon. He always smiled at the sight of it, displayed proudly on the wall behind Tony’s desk between framed original artwork from masters of the baroque period.
“We will increase security of the palace grounds; this was not on Rhodey, Steve, this has nothing to do with you—”
One quick look at the grunts he’d been saddled with told him the Lead Dumbo Engineer and Head of Wasting Steve’s Patience were nowhere near a solution.
“Where,” Steve croaked, clearing his throat as he tried to speak. Tony looked around them for water, or anything for Steve to drink, but the room was purposefully left empty for hearings with newly released perps.
With jerky, aborted movements, Tony nodded against Steve’s shoulder. Steve felt as Tony inhaled deeply, taking that moment of peace between them to steady himself before sitting up straight to smile down at his husband. His eyes were red and his cheeks were wet from tears Steve had never heard him shedding. The wet lines streaked his face, darkened by a fine layer of dust and soot. With great care, Steve cupped Tony’s face between his hands, and with an unhurried, gentle touch, he wiped Tony’s face clear of tears and grime.
“Stark, this finally makes sense! The man’s created a perfect little world for himself to rule by convincing you to that glorifying hegemonic apathy and uniformity will result in peace. I don’t care if he’s got more faith than god, you can’t forget that he is a man like everybody else: corruptible, and accountable to the law. If the law does not apply to him, this is no longer a free society.”
The resounding howls and growls of excitement from the audience made Tony weak in the knees. Their excitement fed into Tony’s dark fantasy of being subject of lust and desire to an audience who lapped up every whimper and cry that fell from Tony’s lips, who would not soon forget how his flushed skin and quivering thighs looked as he fucked himself into oblivion for all to see.
Steve would never admit it, but after seeing Tony again, time started passing quicker than he would have liked.
As the leading harvesting agent in the company, Steve lived an exceptionally nice life. The physical atmosphere would take some adjusting to, and the food might need careful balancing, but Steve had plenty of resources to provide Tony with a good life.
“Answering ‘why’ you wish to marry may help you answer ‘when.’ However, neither why nor when is as important as whom,” Tony said slowly and with care, “and to me, Orfeo, it sounds like you are very certain of whom you wish to marry.”
“You’re not wrong,” Tony said quietly, keeping his voice low and his tone gentle so the dog wouldn’t notice a change, “but I’m pretty sure I’ll need your number for that.”
“Then that’s settled: the first sixty times we have penetrative sex of any kind, I bottom,” Steve decided without so much as a ‘best of two.’ Tony had half a mind to grumble and disagree, but Steve was such a mule when he wanted to be.
She left them a portfolio of recommendations both domestic and international. Steve enjoyed looking through it and talking to Tony about the exciting places they could go in their celebration together, but Tony had barely heard a word.
Steve rolled his eyes, but despite himself, he found himself fighting back a laugh. Jane remained silent for the most part after that, allowing the barber to finish his work and only chiming in with a comforting word or two when she noticed Steve trying to catch a glance through the mirror.
“Why, I’m sure we don’t know what you’re talking about,” Maria said with a sweet smile. Clint, however, was much more honest.
Tony smiled brightly and laughed quietly to himself, but there was something about what Stephen said that he hadn’t thought of before. “You know, it’s a difficult movie to describe without giving too much away, but that’s maybe the best description I’ve heard yet,” Tony observed after a thoughtful pause. “This is a conflicted love letter to our current government, to the hate and the exclusion and what we are allowing our country to become. Many of us have to really grapple with what it means to be Americans today. A lot of us live in fear of our own country. These are the narratives that the writers distilled through the experiences of the main character - my character - Sebastián, who is… institutionalized?”
His position was difficult to maintain and he ached in the added stretch, but Tony was determined to do it for Steve. Steve, who peppered adoring kisses to his shoulder and throat as he eased into Tony’s body inch for endless inch, until finally Tony was afraid he wouldn’t have room to breathe.
“I could use a break,” she said innocently enough. She looked like she was on a mission, and Steve knew better than to get in the way. While she dug around in her bag, he carefully placed the protective sheet over his charcoal drawing and tugged it into the center of the table.
Steve scrunched his nose at the thought. Catching up with Tony after a long day sounded like something he could do, but a random person? He took a breath, reminded himself that his career depended on networking, and figured the pros outweighed the cons.
Distantly he knew it was a tiny detail to focus on, and that Steve was probably rushing to get to him, but that acknowledgement was overwhelmed by the reminder that soon Steve would not be calling him. Soon, Tony would have no reason to receive Steve’s texts, phone calls, or delivered flowers to remind him that Steve was thinking about him, that Steve loved him.
“The application is due in four months. I asked my professors for recommendation letters, and I ordered seven of the most recent LSAT review books. I’m finishing my class work early so I can focus on my admissions essay and the LSATs. I need a 175 or better.”
Steve stared ahead into the dark night. It was a wonder, really, how Tony even knew where to go; the headlights illuminated the path a few yards ahead, but no more, and somehow Tony just knew how to find the turns and avoid the ditches through the night. There was no question he had driven on that road his whole life, long enough to do it now in the dark without missing a beat, and Steve struggled to reconcile his unwarranted envy for such a childhood with the luxury of a life without expectations. He could live his life without answering to anyone, without worrying about failing to live up to anybody else’s dreams.
Strangely enough, Steve found that he could relate to that. After all, was that not what he had done on a smaller scale at the gym, pushing his body against the unlikeliest odds? The effort and determination of a sickly foster kid to grow strong could not be greater than a boy training to wrestle animals ten times his size.
“Anything you need to know?” Tony echoed as he considered Steve’s question, then with a smile he couldn’t quite feel, he said, “I mean, this is it. This is your last chance. The south is ...you know,” he tried to explain with a little shrug, but when he noticed Steve taking a breath to say something, he rushed to say, “so, you might have heard, they’re not the nicest to gay—or bi—people, they think God said so, whatever. And just cause my parents know I’m not straight doesn’t mean everyone’s cool with it. Doesn’t even mean they’re cool with it, so that’ll be fun—but, you know. They know. And open—”
Sarah dumped her purse and her big winter coat over an empty kitchen chair and wrapped her arms around him. “Honey lamb, what’s gotten into you?” she murmured into his hair, holding him tight. “What are you doing?”
“Most people just tell me they have hepatitis when they’re honest in a relationship,” Tony mumbled in a daze before he could stop himself. He couldn’t have been more awkward if he talked through a shoe.
Steve groaned and rolled his eyes. “No, wait, Tony, I didn’t mean—take your time, I’m sorry. That was sarcasm.”
“You are Tony Stark,” Rhodey reminded him, speaking slowly in his effort to follow Tony’s argument. “And you want me to help you get into a Doubletree hotel—”
It might have worked on most people, but Carol knew Tony. More importantly, Carol knew how Tony and Steve got around each other in fancy dress, and the way Tony looked in his smart tuxedo Carol wouldn’t trust a word out of his mouth.
As if Steve didn’t already feel like shit for cancelling on his friends. Sam spoke before Steve had a chance to defend his decision.
“I didn’t read them, it just started flashing on the table and I noticed,” Tony started to say, and he was on his way back with Steve’s phone in hand when the lock screen lit up and all the messages were on display again.
The moment Steve gave his name to the spa greeter he was whisked away to a private lounge and invited to every fruit, tea, and drink imaginable. Another young woman came to talk to him and see if he had any concerns or preferences they should be aware of, and it was only then that Steve learned that Tony had arranged their most indulgent package for him. This wasn’t a facial or a massage like usual, but a three hour face and body treatment and four hand massage. Steve hadn’t known what to say, and to her credit, the young woman met his stumped expression with genuine amusement. Even in his shock Steve recognized that being blindsided by an anti-aging treatment sounded ungrateful, but by the time they led him away and he was half asleep on a wide set heated massage table, Steve couldn’t remember what part of it was upsetting. Hell, he couldn’t even remember the last time he had a massage of any kind, let alone one with two therapists that lasted three hours.
Tony huffed in quiet amusement, but turned back to answer Steve. “The plan was to meet Pepper and a few people from work about a conference we’re part of hosting next month, but she got a call on Friday about a job in LA, so we rescheduled. I used to work in LA, and she had questions.”
Steve jerked back to life with a violent convulsion, swinging his fists at that unfamiliar bodies swarming him. He connected with something, but it didn’t help. He couldn’t breathe, he couldn’t see, and nothing was familiar—it was all dark, it was too silent, it was all very wrong.
Steve peered at him, then shook his head slowly as he eventually gave up on trying to make sense of what Tony had said. “You lost me, Tony.”
“If we can prove it,” Maria pointed out. “No drug test, and he denies cheating. And she wants full custody.”
The freshly-soaked blond grimaced and shook the water off one sleeve, but his frustration seemed to ease away when he finally laid eyes on Tony.
“Right now, Steve,” Bucky hissed, and Steve looked up at him immediately. His friend’s face was ashen and set in grim determination. It had been a lifetime since Steve had seen that expression on any man’s face, let alone Bucky’s. Steve got to his feet at once, smoothly buttoning his suit jacket and leading the way to the nearest exit with Bucky at his back.
Tony could feel himself growing unexpectedly lightheaded and willed himself to look away. There was nothing like Sitwell’s bulbous face to remind him of what they were there to do.
“You think I'm funny, but not everybody does, Tony. Gray doesn't want ‘trained comedy’,” Steve added, “he wants genuine, clever—”
“Alright, fine. If you’re sure,” Bucky said eventually. They sat together in silence for a short time, but Bucky didn’t push, and Steve couldn’t seem to find the right words. Instead of letting it fester, Bucky pushed himself back to his feet and made an effort to change the subject. “Well, I don’t know about you, but I’m starving. The game starts in an hour. Wanna go to Shield, or grab something and watch it at your place?”
“Please, Steve,” Tony moaned into the cushions, pleading softly but lying obediently still. “I need it, please.”
“Thank god it’s you,” Tony wheezed and hauled his friend into his dorm room, then with a quick peek in both directions down the hall, he closed the door behind them. The door locked on its own, but he tugged on the handle to be sure, then slid the bolt he had added for extra security.
“Ashley Olsen!” Tony called out before Steve even opened his mouth. Steve probably should have laughed, or congratulated Tony on his point, but instead he cleared his throat and sat up straight. It was about to get serious.
while he dug through his drawer of similar looking white bottles, ointments, lotions, and novelty condoms (when did that get in there?) in the hopes that he still had some band-aids lying around. “It’s normal, it’s just a little blood.”
“You were cold,” Steve said in a whisper, as if any other man wouldn’t happily use the same excuse to get Tony naked in bed, or naked in a warm shower, or naked in front of the fireplace in a nest of pillows and plush blankets. And frankly, Tony would have been all for a horny welcome, but privately (grudgingly) he could admit that there was something special about simply being held and comforted in arms that never wanted to let him go.
“You said that already,” Clint observed suspiciously. “Uh, Tony? Maybe you should chew on a turnip or something? You don’t sound right.”
A gentle knock on his balcony door caught Steve off guard, and when he turned to see what it was, he found his dad standing on the balcony with a small CVS bag and a concerned expression. Steve watched him from the hallway and didn’t immediately let him in, giving his overbearing dad enough time out in the cold so he’d know how welcome his style of (literal) helicopter parenting really was.
“You’re giving Steve a run for his money with that tush, but we’d never know from the movies. An absolute disservice, we barely get any glimpses of it in the trailer at all.”
“I, alone, am going to go to his lab and talk to him,” Steve said as calmly as he could. Except, his friends weren’t going to let him get away with it.
Tony pressed a hand over his heart in a caricature of scandalized virtue. “What look! I don’t have a look.”
He had gone to sleep on Tuesday night as an extension of Howard Stark’s legacy, and woken up on Wednesday to a life that would be entirely his own. Whatever fortune Howard amassed, whatever bombs he designed, the future would stand on Tony’s shoulders.
Happy only needed a few seconds to take Steve up on his offer. He told Steve to go on inside while he got everything sorted with the valet, and soon enough, they were both seated at a table where they could enjoy the delicate shimmering melody woven in a gilded harp. When the waiter first came to take their order, he addressed Happy before Steve, taking his cue from the way they were dressed. Happy easily fit in with the crowd in his classic black and white suit, but Steve, who’d been caught on his way home from work, still wore the standard red sweats and white uniform polo all the therapists wore.
“Mom’s got brunch with her work friends on Saturdays,” Steve replied thoughtfully, “but I’ll ask about Sunday.”
“You mean, like staking out a museum for eight days looking for a leggy brunet with a, and I quote, ‘plump ass’?”
For their honeymoon they had taken to the sea on a private yacht for a few days, far from staff, curious tourists, and hidden cameras. That first night, Steve had ridden Tony’s cock under the light of a starlit sky. Every moment with Tony was a gift, but Steve still cherished the memory struggling to make their first night last forever, of unraveling Tony's world with every roll of his hips and every touch of his lips.
Casual as he’d been with his wandering hands, the man seemed to realize he’d made an error and quickly held his hands up in apology. Still, Steve got to his feet to loom over him, and with a dangerous snarl, spat out, “Touch me again and I’ll break your wrist.”
There was a quiet pause on Tony’s end, but this time he sounded genuinely baffled. “Was that why you rolled us over? MLK?”
“Steve! What the hell, man, get out here!” Bucky called out in complaint. “How do you even do this?”
After the ceremony, they all went their own way. Carol celebrated her graduation with James and her family, and Sam and Sharon bit the bullet and finally introduced their families to each other.
“This is brutal,” Tony whispered with breathless excitement as he studied the shocking photos. “Why wasn’t there an all-cars notified?”
“Yeah, sure. Text me the address, Tony. I’ll be there right away,” Steve replied despite his (and Bucky’s) better judgment. Now, all he had to do was explain his momentary lapse of good judgment to his best friend.
This close, Steve didn’t need his dad’s super hearing to notice how Tony’s heartbeat pitched into a whole new kind of panic. He was going to act, Steve just knew it—Tony was holding his breath and blinking like he was staring into the sun, and the sudden flash of determination in his eyes made Steve's heart ache with understanding.
Steve wanted Tony in a way he had never imagined wanting someone else. He felt like he could fly. He was in love, he was so happy in love, but dear god. His mother had been right.
“This… this is going to be a little different,” Tony explained without explaining anything, but he helped pull Steve’s jeans and underwear down his legs. Whatever else he was about to say fled from his mind; Steve could see it in his eyes, how Tony lost his train of thought and instead came to a stand-still where he could do nothing but stare at Steve’s naked body.
To Tony’s dismay, Steve guided the canister away. With the firm grip still around the base of his cock, Tony could only coo and mewl when he felt his master’s thick fingers pressing into his ass, first two, then three, until he stretched Tony’s sore hole over four fingers.
Determination and disappointment flickered across Tony’s expression, one after another. There were a great many things he’d rather do than talk about the accident, but it was too important to push aside. Coulson was too important to push aside.
Tony glittering peel of laughter drowned out Steve’s low, embarrassed whine. “I’m hanging up on you right now!” Steve cried in a half-hearted threat. “School is
“Pay y’r own c’tati’ns?” Tony slurred, hissing softly as Bruce found and pressed part of his own jacket against Tony’s wound to help slow the bleeding.
“That’s my seat,” he told her with a careful air of defiance. She smirked back, but she removed her bag so he could take the seat. His face warmed with a victorious grin and he wasted no time getting comfortable.
“No-one but her,” the man said with a small shake of his head. “I cried a lot, gained twenty pounds. She even took the dog, man. So I got a loan and picked up this place, with an apartment upstairs to call my own. It’s been alright since, just… lonely, you know? I miss that dog. A week before his third birthday, too.”
“Is it your first time?” Steve wondered after a hesitant pause. “We come here so anyone struggling with reading can practice. Seamus listens, and he doesn’t judge. He won’t get impatient or upset if you need to go slow. Usually it’s twenty or thirty minutes at a time, but we can finish the hour if you like, I don’t think anyone else is waiting.”
Women hunted men for their necessary purpose, sometimes even picking and choosing their prizes by the meat on their bones and the superficial attributes. Women hunted men like game beasts, and when male children reached puberty, they were turned away from their mothers and abandoned into the wilderness.
It was a big party in a big lodge upstate, full of people ranging from best friends and absolute strangers. Bucky and Steve had driven up early in the day to help Sam and Sharon set everything up, and by the time Tony arrived, Steve had a small crowd of followers offering to buy him a drink at a party with an open bar. Not that Tony could blame them. Steve’s proportions were unreal, and his broad chest and bared pecs practically begged to be touched. But as much as Tony typically loved seeing people gawking at his man, gawking at his nearly-nude man was another matter entirely.
The plan wasn’t perfect and Bucky knew it. If Bucky took Steve’s security detail with him, there was still a slim chance that someone would attack their undefended king and unravel Terrini in these delicate nascent years of peace. But if he didn’t compromise somewhere, Steve would take drastic measures. Worse still, Steve would never forgive him - even if Bucky was only doing his job to keep Steve safe.
“I had it down to five rings when your mom was showing my parents around New York, so I called them.”
“Playing hard to get?” he purred, licking his teeth in his obvious delight. “Think you’re too good for my money, Steve? Well, every man has a price.”
“He has a multinational company worth billions, he’ll be able to hide the paper trail if he wants to,” Sharon chimed in. Steve wasn’t sure if she was bringing up a counterpoint to mess with him, or if she simply had better insight from her own background as a wealthy, upper-class woman.
“Pretty sure he wouldn’t,” Natasha disagreed at the same time as Sam pointed out, “we all knew, and none of us are geniuses.”
It was almost too much. What if Steve fell in love with these words and then had to wait a whole year for the rest of the story? But there was nothing for it, there was no resisting it. He signed into his account, settled against the side of the tub, and with breathless excitement dove into another fantastical world by Tony Stark.
When he pushed in fully with a three fingers, Tony’s body shuddered uncomfortably, shifting his weight with unease, and Steve’s hand at the small of his back had to apply more pressure just to keep him from crawling away. Steve withdrew slowly and rubbed his fingers together again, generating more lube and letting Tony rest before he tried again. Two fingers slipped in easily again, and he thrust slowly, almost in apology for how he had aggravated Tony's hole moments earlier. Clearly, his first assumption had been most accurate. Gradually, Tony warmed to his touch again, relaxing and letting his thighs spread farther apart in invitation, moaning eagerly under Steve’s touch.
“It’s Howard’s grandmother’s recipe,” she told him. “It’s the only recipe we allow in this house. I’ll show you what she showed me,” she added with a smile, “so if Clint doesn’t get his act together before I die, you can show Laura.”
“It, what?” Tony looked up and shot him a pained look. “It’s not meant to hold an avocado, Steve. Put it down. It’s been five minutes, I can’t do this with you: stop helping.”
He snuggled in close, and with an arm draped over Steve’s shoulders, he held the bag of frozen broccoli against the swelling on Steve’s cheek while combing his fingers through Steve’s hair with the other, rubbing and gently scratching at his scalp from time to time.
When they returned to the tailor’s shop, they were greeted warmly and Steve was shown to the dressing rooms. Steve had expected anything from a tuxedo or a three-piece suit to a simple dinner jacket and trousers. Never in a thousand years had he imagined a kimono.
They were going to go to jail. They were going to go to jail and it would all be Tony’s fault. Kind, gentle, gorgeous Steve who’d have every man with a pulse after him and his gorgeous lips, it would all be Tony’s fault for dragging him into this. Maybe if he gave himself up—maybe if he pretend he’d done this alone and left Steve to hide behind the cover of the ancient sculpture he’d be the only one convicted of the crime and Steve could write the story. Maybe he’d even share the byline with Tony so they’d have one last story together as partners.
They came to an understanding, the two of them. Steve accepted Tony’s few but important boundaries, blood and breath play chief among them, while Tony promised not to let another of Steve’s kind kiss him without Steve’s direct permission. They agreed on six months to start, by Tony’s understanding of time. If all went according to plan, Steve could build an empire in that time. Besides, he knew (perhaps, better than Tony) how quickly even young human pets lost their valued stamina and potency.
