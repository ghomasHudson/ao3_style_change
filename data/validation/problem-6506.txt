"Are you mocking me right now?" Steve asked, smiling despite himself, and Tony held up one hand, his finger and thumb an inch or so apart.  Steve took a deep breath, trying to ignore the nausea that still churned low in his stomach.  "Listen, buddy, this is my first marriage and my first divorce, I've got concerns."
"Right, we're going to-" Jan poked Steve in the stomach, her lips pursed.  "We're going to need more."
Steve nodded.  “Reckon I’m not,” he agreed.  He straightened up, pushing the car door shut with one hand.  He took a step back, letting Happy pull the car away, and turned back towards the house.
“And I knew the moment that Abe dragged this kid into his kitchen that he was going to be nothing but trouble,” Isaiah said, with a firm nod.  He gave the bowl a stir with a silicone pastry brush and started sweeping the glaze over the cinnamon rolls with a quick, heavy hand.  “All piss and vinegar, trying to bite everything that got in reach.”
Tony shook his head.  “I'm not-” he started, just as the music started up again, a bright, warm sweep of notes.
“Cucumber, sir,” Jarvis said.  “Have you finished the engine reviews?  Mr. Stane will be here to collect them at-”
Sam nodded.  “You know that Shuri would’ve fixed it for you, don’t you?” he asked.  “Hell, something like that, anyone could’ve-”
Tony rolled over, his legs tangling in the fabric of the blankets as he struggled into a upright position.  Bruce was in one of the chairs next to the windows, a book open on his lap.  He pulled off his glasses, squinting in Tony’s direction. “Steve went to take a look at DJ’s room,” he said with a faint, apologetic smile.  “How’re you feeling?”
“Yeah, so, if I understand the timeline,” Harris said, “you arrived in New York, found out we weren’t IN New York, and took off on your own to find us.”
"My car is at the curb," she said, tucking her bag under her arm.  "Shall we?"  Without waiting for a response, she turned on her heel, stepping briskly across the lobby towards the door.  Steve, caught off guard, had to scramble to catch up, falling into step behind her.
Jan huffed out a breath.  “No one lets me have any fun,” she complained.  She rested her chin on DJ’s head.  “Tony.  Let me have fun.”
“Whatever the deal they brokered, he likely didn’t get it all up front.  He had to do the work first, and he did.  He set the fire, and went to the gate.”  Steve looked at Tony, those brilliant blue eyes sharp.  “Here’s where the real guesswork begins.”
“Am I the only one with sense here?” Tony asked.  Pepper bit her lip to keep from saying something unfortunate.  He looked at her, his eyes narrowed.  “What?”
She shifted in her seat, the light of the street lamps flickering over her as they sped through the streets.  “Someone doesn’t know the rules, it turns out.  Or, more likely, someone doesn’t care.”
"Almost doesn't count," Franklin said, and DJ decided it wasn't a good idea to bring up how often Franklin talked about being ALMOST thirteen.  He got the feeling that it wouldn't be appreciated.  He flipped the piece he was working on, and it hit the bench perfectly in time with the next thump of Val's leg.  Some of the strain went out of his shoulders.  He could make sense of this, if he tried.
He lifted DJ out of the seat, then sat down, settling DJ in his lap.  “All right,” he said, as DJ relaxed back against his chest.  “What are we doing here?  Who are we moving?  What’s the plan, Napoleon?”
“Not a Stark,” Harris said, and everyone looked at him.  He shrugged.  “I’m…  I’m just making that clear.  I’m-” He tried for a smile.  “I’m not a Stark.”
Everyone, as one, looked up at Peter.  It took him a second to realize it, and then he stared down at him, his head snapping from one side to the other.  “What?  Why is everyone looking at me?  I hate the press.”
“No,” Tony mumbled into his lemonade.  Pepper smiled at him around the tines of her fork, and he made a face in her direction.  “Encouraging.”
DJ blinked, confusion sweeping over him.  His hands were warm, and he looked down to find that he was cradling a tea cup between his palms.  He didn’t recognize it.  It wasn’t one of his father’s coffee cups, with their clean, simple lines, or one of Steve’s, heavy and tough, the white porcelain marred with flecks of paint..
“I’m taking that as approval,” Harris said, his voice quiet.  “But that might be the panicked optimism talking.” He ran a gentle hand over the cat’s back, and it arched up, pressing its head into the hollow of his palm.  The angle made its ears go flat, and DJ smiled.
“I think that things have been better since he got here, don’t you?” Peter asked, and he was so earnest, he nearly radiated it.  Tony stopped walking, and so did he, just about tripping over his own feet as he turned to face Tony.  “I just-”  He tucked his hands in his pockets, his shoulders flexing in something like a shrug.  “I think it’s been better.”  He blinked at Tony.  “Don’t you?”
“It's cute that you think that,” Tony said, trying to shoo him away.  “Get off, he has information.  I want it.”
“There is a terrifying amount of butter in it,” Steve said.  He took a sip of his coffee.  “You can never tell Tony I gave them to you.”
“I love you, too, now go out there and trip over something so I can feel a little better about my disaster of an existence.’
"Not really, no, because I'm sitting in a very nice, very empty room by myself," Steve said.  "In a very nice suit."  He stared at the array of silverware that surrounded his place setting.  "Wondering why they've given me six forks."
“No,” Tony said, but she was already digging through his pockets.  Tony tried to fend her off. “Woman-” She pulled his phone out with a triumphant sound, and grabbed his hand.  “Why would I let you do this?” Tony asked as she tried to force his finger onto the unlock sensor. He shook her off and held his hand over his head.  “This is undignified.”
Morse started to laugh.  “Look at that.  He’s got a sense of humor,” she drawled, doffing her cap with a half bow.  Her blonde hair tumbled down her back, and she tossed the cap towards one of the workbenches.  “And here I thought that cops had that surgically removed when they took the badge.”
“I mean, men aren’t really enthusiastic about it, either, but he really does think that he’s be reassuring,” Harris said.  He took a deep breath.  “I think he really is trying, Darce.”
“Hey.” Tony reached out, his fingertips stroking DJ’s hair away from his forehead.  “All right, then, the movie’s done, you great waste of money..”  DJ kicked out with one foot, digging deeper into the nest he’d made of Tony’s jacket.  Tony caught himself smiling down at the oblivious brat.  “So what’s this?  You live here now?  You’re not going to come-”
“You need to start thinking of someone other than yourself,” Obie said, stabbing a finger against the desktop.  “What do you think will happen if you end up injured, or, god forbid, dead?”
“Okay, let’s just-” Sam crossed his arms over his chest.  “Remember when Jan decided we had to try that hot yoga fad?”
“Clear the streets and hold your distance,” Steve said.  Tony spared a glance for the street below him, catching a glimpse of his familiar blue clad form.  SHIELD agents and police officers were moving everywhere, scrambling over the streets like ants.  But it was Steve that everyone followed, the civilians spilling out in his wake like he was the Pied Piper, the only point of reference they had in a world gone mad.  “Iron Man, what's it doing?”
Steve rolled his eyes.  “I've got a long day of serving and schmoozing,” he said.  “And there's a lot of friendly competition here, I think wearing pants is a good first step to keeping myself afloat.”
“A couple of months, we'll figure out a time when it's convenient, and make sure we're on the low ebb of the news cycle, and Marcy'll take care of the rest,” Tony said. He kept his voice brisk. Businesslike. “Until then, you can stay in the penthouse, if you like, and-”
“Excuse me, sir, but you were not properly announced,” Jarvis said, and Obie spun on his heel, the gun coming up, leveling straight at Jarvis’ face.
"They are saying," she said, the words thin and tight, as if they were being forced out from between clenched teeth, "that you, Tony Stark, married Steve Rogers last night."
Natasha glanced over her shoulder.  “Are you eating jam straight from the jar?” she asked, mildly amused.
“They have a nice little nook of a room in the back.  For visiting dignitaries and privacy loving individuals such as ourselves,” Tony said.  “And a staff that knows how to keep their mouths shut.”  He plucked a perfect sphere of blown glass from the box and held it up.  “I know this isn't what you wanted, let's...”  He gave Steve a hopeful smile.  “Let's try again?”
“Or the garage,” Tony said.  “But Rhodey and Happy checked every one of the cars.  And there's no way he got past the locks on the workshop.”
Tony and Fury exchanged a look, but Harris kept going.  “Yes.  C’mon.  Grab your bag.”  He looked at Fury.  “My place is safe enough, no one knows he’s here.  There’s no reason-”
“It’s not-” Steve looked at the watch, at Tony’s fingers as he removed the case, the movements deft and precise.  The case was bent, the cheap metal having given way at some point.  “I doubt it’s worth fixing.  It didn’t cost much to begin with.”
"We're all fine," Miss Potts said, waving an airy hand through the air.  “Which doesn't mean that we wouldn't all benefit from an actual meal.”  She paused, a slight smile twitching the corners of her lips.  “Mr. Stark has the finest of French chefs, doesn't he, Natasha?”
“But still, I like math, and I bet you like math,” Peter said to DJ.  “Once you learn the rules, it’s very logical and that’s nice.  It’s nice for things to occasionally make sense, and you not a lot of things do in this world.”
Slowly, the man behind the table looked up.  His white eyebrows arched, a vaguely inquisitive expression.  “Hi, kid?”  It had the slight uptick at the end of a question.  He reached out, nudging a pamphlet towards DJ.  “Visit the museum.  Worth your time.”
Fury’s eye shut, a momentary shudder running over him.  He took a deep breath, rocking back in his chair.  “Yeah, when you put it like that, cross-dimensional travel seems a lot more palatable.”  He looked at Tony.  “Can you recreate the system you used to get him back last time?”
“Tonight,” Tony said.  “Or today.”  He hadn't gotten an exact plan from Steve yesterday.  Mostly for his own sanity.  “I'm letting him handle it.”
“To the ‘ordinary’ thing?” Darcy asked, sidestepping a pack of agents in SHIELD branded sweatsuits.  “No.  No, Harris, we cannot, because-”  She reached out, flicking the tip of Harris’ nose with the tip of one finger.  “Many things you are, but ordinary? You are not.”
Pepper gave him a look, so it was clear that he wasn't meeting expectations, but she should be used to that.  She gestured behind Tony.  "This is Jarvis," she said.  "He is in charge here."
“I wouldn’t have gone to all that trouble to dress him if I hadn’t seen the way he looked at you,” Jan said.  She held her hands out to Tony, and he wrapped his hands around her narrow waist, giving her a boost off of the workbench and down to the floor.  She braced her hands on his shoulders, steadying herself until she was back on her feet.  As soon as she was, her hands slid down to straighten his vest.  “I like him.”  Her eyes canted up towards Tony’s.  “Does he know?”
"And that is not a question," Jarvis said, his face a polite mask.  But there was something like laughter in the words, a note of unholy glee that Steve didn't really understand.
“No one is getting a ‘What Happens in Vegas’ t-shirt,” Tony said, frowning down at his phone, his thumbs tapping away on the surface.
"Don't call attention to yourself.  You've got a very tempting silhouette," Jan said, yanking a pencil out of her hair.  She scribbled a string of incomprehensible numbers on her notepad.  "Steve.  Arms UP."
Pepper caught his other arm, the cup clattering to the floor.  “Tony, he’s fine.  He’s upstairs with May and Peter.  Natasha is keeping an eye on all of them.” He stared at her, and Pepper gave him a slight, tired smile.  “He’s safe.  Natasha won’t let anyone near him.  You know that.”  Her fingers squeezed tight, half comfort, half warning, and then she released him, leaning over to pick up the cup. “You’re the only one who’s hurt, Tony.  Everyone else is just fine.”
Across the desk from him, Clint sat silently for a moment, then he shifted in his chair, scooting it against the carpet with a noise that made Phil grit his teeth.  His fingers flexed on his pen, the tip digging into the paper.  Clint jerked the chair forward again, and Phil paused.  “Are you actively trying to be annoying right now?”
Tony waited, hoping he’d go away.  Jarvis just stood there, his tray tucked neatly under his arm, his expression vaguely curious, as if he was checking in on last night’s score on a baseball game he really didn’t care about.  Tony sighed and reached for his coffee cup.  “Yes,” he said, trying to drown the word in the depths of his cup.
Nicholas shook his head.  “Even with your signature on the page, T’Challa, I suppose some part of me still didn’t believe it.  But here we are.”  He waved a hand at Steve.  “Here we both are.  God above, here we both are.”
He took a corner, a little too fast, a little too wide, and another car came blasting past them in the other direction, the horn blaring as Happy jerked the wheel, swinging back into their own lane.  Their back wheels spun against the road, the car fishtailing towards the ditch.
“I mean, it’s an excuse to eat chocolate,” Tony said.  “And I like having excuses.”  He pressed a kiss to Steve’s neck, his beard rubbing against Steve’s skin.  “You did a good job.”
The cat tipped its head back, rubbing its ruff against Harris’ fingers one last time, then simply dissolved into smoke, its form slowly dissipating into nothingness.  Harris blinked down at the space where the cat used to be, and his nose wrinkled.  “Does…  Does anyone else smell…”
Bobbi flicked a strip of apple peel free from the blade of her knife, tossing it in his direction, and it landed squarely on his forehead.  “Can we say we’re more united than we were?”
Steve wanted to laugh.  Or cry.  He wasn’t sure which.  “The ship I was on went down, like you said.  Almost fifty years ago.  No one will believe-”
Steve stroked a finger over Tony’s bottom lip.  “Promise?” he asked and there was a wry note to his voice that made Tony’s chest ache.
Steve jammed the pants into his bag, ignoring the way that Jarvis winced.  “I doubt the master of the house will welcome a visit, Jarvis.” He grabbed a shirt, making a halfhearted effort to fold it before he tossed it into his bag.  His throat felt tight.  “He’s only interested in a paid employee, and as it turns out?  I don’t have any interest in that position.”
Natasha smiled at him.  “Why don't we try that?  And if it doesn't work, if it's wrong, we can always go back to working on your routine.  Okay?”
Jarvis smiled, just a little.  “What’s the harm, after all?  They want something, and if to get it, they have to pay for it, they will.  In this world-” He waved at the room at large.  “Everything has a price.  Everything has a cost.  Why would companionship or friendship be any different?”
Tony locked his teeth together, struggling to get himself back under control.  It was harder than it should've been, but Steve was still asleep in his lap, his breath soft and even against Tony's lower stomach.  Tony had lost track of time somewhere along the way, his back and shoulders were aching, his legs numb, and he didn't give a damn about that.  He was used to that, and he was used to ignoring that.
“And that is your problem, not mine,” Clint said, ducking as she aimed a punch at his shoulder. “You didn’t ask for a long term plan, it’s-”
"I'm going to do Wookie translation, too," Clint said, throwing his arms up.  "And making fun of the Storm Trooper's attempts to aim.  And point out how stupid the CGI stuff is."
Dummy rolled obediently away, and Tony watched him go, his eyes narrowing.  “Jarvis.  Why does it seem like my bot has been working non-stop for the past week?”
“Wait, weren’t the rest of you seduced?” Rhodey asked.  He looked around the room, his eyes wide.  “I assumed the rest of you-”  He picked up his coffee.  “Just me, then?”
“Me?” Rhodes wiped his hands on a rag, squinting down at the engine block.  “No, no.  Let's not bring me into this.  It's you.”  He stabbed a finger in Stark's direction.  “You've run this thing into the ground.  I'm just trying to put it back to life."
"I'd suggest that we calm down before we do something, uh, something that we might regret," Bruce said.  He smiled at DJ.  "You okay?"
Trip looked from him to the man, eyebrows raised.  He sighed.  “Yes,” he agreed.  “We’ll be bringing our own witnesses.  Do you take cash?”
It was so obviously a lie that he regretted saying it, almost before it left his mouth.  He swallowed, and turned to the cabinets.  The world swayed around him, waves catching him broadside.  He ignored that, too.  “Fine.  So he’s there.”  He tossed the cabinet door open, and then another.  There had to be something else here, there had to be.  He wished he could think straight.  “Is he trapped?”
Steve managed a smile.  “He’s…  A distraction,” he agreed.  He settled back into the couch, trying not to take up too much space.  Natasha moved out of his way, and he gave her an apologetic smile.  “Sorry.”
Beyond that small alcove, he could almost feel the emptiness of the house pressing in on him.  Here, sheltered beneath the curve of the staircase, it was warm and sheltered, thick with color and sensation and light.  His thumb rubbed against the leg of the couch, savoring the silky swirl of the wood, carved with skill and care.
“Oh!  Jan told me about this!” Danny Rand popped up behind Luke’s back, his eyes wide.  He was wearing a truly terrible Christmas sweater and oversized Santa hat.  “Mistletoe!”
DJ nodded.  “He likes anything he can disassemble,” Steve said.  “And...  Reassemble.  He's pretty good at it.”
“For something I'll be wearing one night and trying not to spill on?” Steve gave the sleeve a tug, trying to get it over his wrist, but it was a losing battle.  "It's close enough.”
“It was not my idea.” Tony reached out, his hand coming to rest on Steve’s thigh. “And in my defense, I did leave a note.”
“It's Christmas Eve,” Tony said.  “It's-”  He glanced at his watch and nearly dumped the presents on the floor.  He juggled the packages, trying not to lose anything.  Something hit the ground with a crunch.  He ignored it.  “It's seven pm on Christmas eve, don't you think that I might have something better to do right now?”
“Here we are,” Tony agreed.  He rolled his head on his neck, trying to loosen the muscles.  “Right where you left us.”
Clint shrugged again.  “Does it hurt?”  He held up a shirt emblazoned with the logo ‘Old Enough to Know Better, Still Young Enough to Do It.’   “What do you think?”
“Just trying to figure out why she's not waiting til we get home.”  He picked up the call with a flick of his thumb. “Did you miss me this much, or are you just bored?”
Her lips curled up.  “I saw that.”  She waited until he swallowed, then broke the scone in half and handed him the larger piece.  “I know we planned to run through your routine today,” she said, before taking another sip of her latte.  “And maintaining your schedule is important.”
The spike of panic was completely unreasonable, and Steve refused to acknowledge it.  “Does it really matter?” he asked.  His hands came up to cover Tony’s.  “If you really want-”
There was a moment of silence, and then the elevator came to a smooth stop.  Clint glanced at the doors, but they didn't budge.  "Jarvis?"
“If you fold that into a paper airplane, you will never see me coming,” she said.  She leaned over, the rest of the papers hugged to her chest, to whisper directly in his ear.  “I know where you sleep.”
The rush of relief that flooded over him caught him by surprise.  He did not want to think too much about that.  “So just ask Happy where-”
“Since I’m not budging on this, and you can’t make me, I’m fairly certain that it is,” Tony said.  He stood. “But if it makes you feel better, I’ll pretend to consider your position of the matter.”
“It… It shouldn’t ever be effective,” Bruce said, sounding pained.  “It’s, that’s not a good way to, to do this sort of…”  He stopped.  “Anything.”
DJ’s eyes rolled up towards the sky.  “Going!” he said giving the sand a good kick before he started to make his way around the car.  Clint, his hands tucked in his back pockets, followed behind him, shooting them a look from under the hard line of his brows.  He said something to DJ, his voice pitched low, and DJ laughed.
Gyrich's head turned in his direction, a smile creasing his face.  “What makes you think you're not in the middle of a fight right now, Captain?”
Steve ducked around the nearest corner, doing his best to avoid eye contact with every person he passed.  Luckily, most of them seemed just as interested in avoiding him.  By the time he found a relatively quiet corner at the end of a deserted corridor, he almost had his blood pressure back under control.
He tried not to see the crowd they'd attracted, people piling up around the edges of the platform.  He was used to being a spectacle, but trust Steve to take 'making a scene' to an entirely new level.  Because Steve was still smiling at him, and if he was concerned, or embarrassed, it didn't show on his face.  Tony supposed not everyone had the extensive experience to cultivate a 'complete disaster' sense the way he had.
Greer gave him a wave, gesturing at the couch next to her, and Steve headed in her direction.  She took the paper towels from him, tossing them to Bruce, who looked like his mu shu pancake hadn’t been up to his appetite.  “Here,” Greer said, clearing the seat next to her.
“Jury’s out,” Steve said.  He paused.  “Actually, most of the jury is in a sugar coma.  Except Jess.  I think she’s built up an immunity.”  He leaned his chin on one hand.  “Feel free to help yourself.”
“You did, in fact, seem intent on emptying the house,” Jarvis said, unconcerned.  “I pointed out that tossing us all into the streets in the dead of night was beneath you.”
“And you can be a secretive as you want,” Tony whispered back, his knuckles brushing against the line of Steve's jaw, “but don't kid yourself.  Fury knows we're shacking up.”
“Very little,” Jess said, in what was so clearly a lie that he didn’t even have the strength to argue with her about it.  “Almost none.”
“We have a cat now,” Tony said, his voice dire.  “And I already have carpet burn on my face, so I think I'll stay standing.”
“I'm sure they are,” Rogers said.  “Never going to find my name on a list of the 'best people,' though, so I think I'll leave that to the social set.”
“Heist,” he said.  He leaned forward, ignoring when the bag bumped against his chin and pointed.  “There.”
Reality hit him like a bat to the side of the head.  “I’m not.  What?  I’m not sick, why would you-” Tony was still staring at him, and his face was terrible.  “Tony.”  Steve shook his head.  “I’m not sick.  I’m fine.  I’m just-”  Tony’s hand slid away from his face, and Steve’s chest seized, the loss of that contact a physical blow.
“I made you something,” he whispered.  “Probably not something you’d like, but, you know me, out of ideas before I even start.
“No.” He couldn't listen to this, or he would lose his mind. He forced a smile on his face, light and easy. “Steve. Don't be-” He exhaled. “Don't be ridiculous.” He crossed his arms over his chest, and then uncrossed them, forcing them back to his sides. “You've been the perfect husband.”
Her eyebrows arched.  “Oh, see, that’s the problem, you think I built this-” She tapped the silken bronze surface of the still with one knuckle.  “Because I had to?”
“I'll find you a bottle of 'No More Tears,'” Rhodey said.  “Do not sneak out without talking to Steve.”
Steve pushed himself away from the banister.  They were ghosts of another age, but places like this must be full of them.  Ghosts were different where he came from.  They were thinner.  Uglier.  Angrier.
“Is he still in denial?” Okoye asked Shuri.  Shuri nodded.  “How are we still having this discussion?”  She looked at Steve, her eyebrows arched.  “If not for you, I would be with the rest of the royal delegation coming directly from the port, instead of criss-crossing the entirety of this country on a horse.”  The disdain in her voice was palpable, and Steve reached out, petting Nomad’s neck in apology.  Okoye gave first him, then his horse, a speaking look.  “For that reason alone, I shall enjoy watching them clamp a crown upon your head.”
Tony slipped a little lower in the water, the ends of his tie floating along the surface.  "That's quitter talk, Rogers."  One languid hand fumbled next to the tub, coming up at last with a bottle of mineral water.  "So much quitter talk."  He stared at the camera, his eyes glinting with the sort of intent that twisted Steve's stomach into knots, and tipped the bottle to his lips.
“Jan wanted a taste test before the party,” Steve said, picking his way through the website menu.  “It was moderately successful.”  He looked at his notes.  They weren’t much help.
“I did the bathroom,” Jess said.  “I wanted to snoop in his medicine cabinet.”  Carol gave her a look, and Jess shrugged.  “Once a spy, always a spy.”
Steve glanced over. “Yes, I found your collection of zesters,” he said, his voice dry. “But no, that's just some books. I left most of those in my-” He stopped.  “Downstairs.  It seemed like a lot of trouble to move everything, so I just brought the ones I'm reading right now, and some of the ones I like to reread.  I thought I'd have time to put it away before you got home.”
“About then.  And in the space of a single day, everyone’s in a total uproar,” she said, wrapping her hands around her mug.  “And there are all these arguments about what to do with him, how to get rid of him, and one big part of the council just votes to drag him into the jungle, and leave him there.  If he’s alive, he’s on his own.”
Steve stopped. "There's a hell of a lot we didn't talk about, Ms. Von Deiter. Things people didn't say because they were afraid, or resigned, or didn't even know it was wrong. And that silence, it didn't help anyone who was suffering, who was marginalized, who was being used or abused. It helped two groups of people." He held up a finger. "One, the people who perpetrate violence, the users and those in power, who are using that power to maintain the status quo." He held up a second finger. "And two? The people who feel uncomfortable hearing about the pain and suffering of others. The ones who prefer not to know that there are issues, because it doesn't affect them, and so..."
“So when he strode up to me in the churchyard, I wasn’t fully sure I hadn’t lost my mind.”  She smiled.  “Because he stalked up, his jaw set, Miss Potts just a step behind him, and said, ‘I need a housekeeper.’”
Pepper smiled at him.  “I think you'll find someone waiting for you outside,” she whispered, and he nodded.  And with that, he was scrambling out the door and down the hallway, his feet flying over the floor.
No one stopped him.  Up the escalators and along the hallway, glancing down at the map every third of fourth step, certain he was making a mistake, terrified of going the wrong way even though he’d just confirmed he wasn’t.  He was never sure.  And mistakes cost time, time they might not have.
Tony turned, following Clint's gaze.  Hulk was peering after Gyrich, his eyes narrowed into slits.  “We okay, big guy?” Tony asked him, and the sentence was barely out of his mouth when Hulk crouched down and simply leapt away.  Tony stared after him.  “What the hell?  Where is he going?”
T’Challa took a step back, gesturing at Shuri.  “May I present her royal highness, the crown princess Shuri?”
Bucky was grinning at Steve.  Steve just focused on eating his stew.  “Really?” Bucky said.  “That’s shocking.”
"If you end up needing a place to crash, a place that's safe and welcoming, there's a card in there."  She tipped her head at the envelope.  "Tell them Mr. Stark sent you and they'll find a place for you."
“And if you end this now, say it was a mistake, even an innocent mistake, then there's no amount of donations that you can make to LGBTQ causes that can erase that,” Marcy said.  She spread her hands.  “You are absolutely going to piss off someone.”
“If you can’t pretend to be polite, you can wait over there, while the rest of us get through this,” he said.  Tony opened his mouth, and Harris stabbed a finger towards the door.  “No.  If you can’t be civilized, then you can wait over by the souvenir table.  Pick out a shirt.  I don’t care.  Just be polite, for once in your life.”
.  He squirmed helplessly, and if a high-pitched yelp escaped his throat, well, could anyone really blame him?
, he does drop the flowers, whirring around and taking a step back, and that’s when his heart leaps to his throat and doesn’t budge an inch.
Tony snorted.  “Didn’t you just give me crap for saying ‘oh’?” he asked, since Steve didn’t look like he was going to punch Tony in the face anytime soon.  “Come on, give me something here.”
It was never your fault, Tony thought, and then he felt a stab of guilt.  He knew just what event Steve was referring to when he said
Cap was still staring blankly at him, so Tony tried a smile.  His skin ached a little—from dryness, he suspected—but hopefully the smile looked better than he felt.  "You can't tell me you expect great things out of me if I'm just passed out in a bed."
On instinct, Tony blindly leapt to one side at the same time the sabretooth leapt forward, shooting his repulsor blasts again and praying Rogers wasn’t in his line of fire.  There was a whooshing sound as Rogers presumably flung his shield, then a thud and a growl as it made contact.  “It’s not going down,” he yelled, firing again even though he could barely see where it was.  “Got any ideas?”
Pepper's voice, apparently, was sharp enough to cut through whatever trance Cap was in, and he jolted, glancing over at where she'd come back down the stairs.  "Bad news.  We have to go."
"It's a good thing the only way out is through a doorway with a bunch of biters on the other side, then."
And then the impossible happens.  One moment, Tony’s still sitting there on the boat, breaking eye contact to look at his father, and the next—the next—
He turned to look at Cap.  "What the hell was that?" he asked.  He was pretty sure that whatever had tried to kill them just now was triggered by something Cap did.
"'Please'," Tony repeated.  God.  Was Cap even real?  "Alright.  Alright.  Let me… find it."  He managed to sit up, pulling his pack toward him and reaching inside.  Once he found the jar, he tossed it to Cap, who caught it.  "If you ask me, it looks exactly the same as it did before."
“How is it any different from what any of us do every single day of our lives?” Tony interjects, unable to help himself.
"Okay," Steve said.  Half an hour ago, he might have gotten upset at Stark keeping more secrets from him.  But hearing what he'd gone through… it would be okay, he thought, if he waited.  "Different question, then.  That woman.  Obviously that… change triggered in her.  But she wasn't
As soon as he read those last two words, everything seemed to make sense.  A missing day, a vivid dream about the future, a name that was more familiar than it had any right to be - Tony Stark had actually been him for a day, and he'd actually been Tony Stark.  It explained everything. Well, everything except the fact that the very concept seemed to defy the very laws of science, but hey, he'd read crazier things in comic books. He could go along with it.
Cap, still seated in a chair a few feet away, tilted his head.  "You know Ms. Potts warned me that you were going to try and do things mere seconds ago, right?" he said.  "I'm onto you, Mr. Stark."
"No," Jessica said, shaking her head.  "There are too many cables and things up here.  It's a tight fit, even for me… and I'm not sure if the ceiling tiles can hold your weight, anyway.  But listen, I have a plan.  If I go left from this room, I can start making a lot of noise.  Draw the biters away.  And you two can go right and head for the cafeteria.  I'll meet you there, okay?"
Steve gazed at him for a moment, contemplative, then nodded, placing his paw briefly against Tony’s shoulder.  If sabretooths could smile, Tony thought that maybe Steve would be smiling right now.  He reached up, patting his paw before Steve drew it away.  “Everything’s going to be okay.”
,” he manages, and he hates how shaky his voice is.  He’s weak, so weak.  Just another thing for his father to criticize.
He shouldn’t, he really shouldn’t, but Tony’s not going to dispute that right now.  “I never should have doubted you, Steve,” he tells him as he raises the gun, taking deep breaths and willing himself to stop shaking.  “You ready?  I-I’m going to shoot now.  Three, two, one…”  And then he fires.
Jessica slashed at the closest biter with her knife, then scrambled to her feet, running to the window and jumping through with Steve's help.   If their lives weren't in danger, he might have taken time to admire her agility.  "Cap, they're coming this way!" she shouted from inside.
It was his fault.  If he'd been faster with the locks, better with his shield, if he'd just listened to Tony straightaway…
Steve stepped back, the woman visibly relaxing as he did.  "Thank you," he said.  "Now get out of here, and tell anyone else you find to evacuate.  There are biters loose."
He returned back to where Tony was fiddling twenty minutes later, finding him already covered in soot.  "It's all clear," he said as he deposited his bag at Tony's feet.
“Howard…?” Sunset says.  Tony wonders if she ever heard of the whole Ty fiasco.  Probably not.  He’s under the impression that his father worked very hard to hide it from her.
Steve laughs shakily, picking up the lifebelt and putting it back on Tony.  “Thanks.  So are you.”  He stands there for another moment, pressing down on the wound, and then he takes a deep breath and steps back, taking hold of Tony’s hand again.  “Press down on that with your other hand.  Let’s go.”
“I was seeing if you had a big red skull under your face,” Steve says seriously.  “Since you’re going on about killing me and all.  But you don’t, so you don’t get to say these things.”  He pulls back, gazing at him.  “You’re right, Tony.  Things aren’t normal.  A lot—a lot happened between us, and some of it is hard to put away.  But we’re Avengers, and the world needs us to stand together.”
Tony cautiously reached forward to pick the pieces up, though he supposed at the moment it was just the one piece, since they'd combined, and held it up in the light.  It was clearly a ring now, with about a third of it missing, and there was a hairline crack in the middle of the arc, the only thing to indicate that it wasn't actually a singular fragment.  "I see," he said.  Cap was still holding his hand out, so Tony gave the piece back to him.  "Tell me, Cap… do you think there's anything to this thing?  Have you felt anything?"
It wasn't easy.  Neither Tony nor the things he was carrying were light, and it was a struggle to not drop anything.  His saving grace was that the bodily matter they'd smeared on themselves seemed to be confusing the biters, leaving their movements half-aborted despite the pounding of his feet and the sounds Tony was still making.  Steve nonetheless didn't want to rely on that too much, continuing to run as fast as he could down the bridge as it evened out into the road on the other side.  There was, to his relief, a building not too far from them, and he made a beeline for it, finding the door and trying to kick it down—only to have it refuse to give.  But he couldn't run with Tony in his arms forever, and the biters were still following them.
He finds Steve at the bow railing, facing out toward the ocean as his hair is blown by the wind.  For a moment, Tony just stands there, taking the chance to admire the way he looks, even from behind.  Casual, but poised… and yet the way his shoulders seem to be hunched ever so slightly seems to indicate that he’s not entirely happy.  And that’s because of him.  Tony.
It was the most Stark had said in several days, though Steve hardly minded.  They weren't here to talk, after all—they'd done all the talking they could stand ten years ago.  "Okay," he said, and they continued onward.
Lunch?  That seemed to imply Ty wouldn't be joining him for the first two classes, which in turn implied they'd be in different classrooms despite being in the same grade.  He'd known that the school was pricey, but it was hard to wrap his head around just how much all that money could afford.
Yinsen finally broke eye contact, staring off into the distance instead.  "Who was your friend trying to save?" he asked.
"No," Steve said, not wanting to believe it.  But he knew Tony was right.  Bucky was dead, and because of his denial, maybe he was dead now too.  Damn it.  Damn it all.  "…I'm sorry," he managed after a moment.
Somewhere ahead of him, Steve could hear breathing.  It took a second for him to realize the significance, though once he did, he gasped, his eyes going wide.  Breathing meant people, regular people—something he hadn't seen since waking up, Stark excepted.  "I'm going to announce our presence," Steve murmured.
Suddenly, though, Carol’s there, placing a hand against his shoulder.  “Easy,” she says.  “Don’t go barreling in now after you took your sweet time getting here.”
And sometimes, his - soul, or something - switched places with Tony's, and they each lived as the other person for a day.
He had his answer soon enough.  Not too far down the tunnel, there was a slight cave-in—it wasn't so bad that the train wouldn't be able to pass through, but there was a pile of debris lying in the middle of the track that would likely prove problematic if they tried to push through it.
The ruins, which had felt so peaceful mere moments ago, were suddenly ablaze—Tony realized now that the torches had probably been rigged to topple over when the trap was triggered, which explained the noise he'd heard when it had happened.  And if the distress signal was any indication, he suspected they were going to have company very soon.
Frowning, Tony set his gauntlets back down.  He didn’t like the idea of Steve going out there by himself, but it’d probably be easier for Steve if he flew solo, particularly since Tony wasn’t exactly well-versed in the art of hunting.  Not that he thought Steve was either, but maybe he had new instincts now.  Still, though… “It’s a bad idea to separate.”
He’s terrified.  This can’t be the end.  Not now, not after he’s spent so long trying to secure safety for the both of them.  No, he tells himself.  Steve—Steve is out here somewhere.  He just has to find him.
“Unfortunately,” the word sounded as if it was forcibly pulled from him. There were veins in his neck and forehead that threatened to pop. “I was part of his security convoy when he was in Afghanistan.”
Bruce’s eyes widen in shock. He nods slowly, knowing of the illegal experimentation in the 60’s, wherein unwilling omegas were kidnapped from the streets by an unknown organisation and had forcible gender reassignment. Some were turned into Alphas but the majority were betas. Almost all of the victims could not handle the sudden change, and some killed themselves or went on a killing spree, blaming the world. The rest were in mental institutions for the rest of their lives.
, he disappeared after a weapons demonstration in Afghanistan. The world thought he was kidnapped by insurgents, but strange things popped up, here and there. And then the FBI learned where Stark went.
Stark hadn’t changed much. A few wrinkles here and there, mostly on the corners of his eyes. His trademark goatee was still intact. But he looked quite healthy, and stronger. The Stark Steve remembered was svelte, but with hidden strength. This Tony was bulkier, but he was still not as big as Steve.
Steve kisses Tony’s eyes as they flutter close. “We’ll just agree to both have married well, and leave it at that.”
“What’s happened to me, Doc?” Tony groans, lying back down. If Bruce is here, it means the Hulk was subdued.
“Fury, darling, you shouldn’t have!” Stark drawled, but his eyes were fixed on Agent Rogers. Fury heard the hitch in Rogers’ breath but his stance was ramrod straight, eyes narrowed in slits.
She slunk off the stool to follow him to the door as Steve shoved his feet into his shoes and grabbed his keys from a hook. He slung his bag over his shoulder, patted down his pockets for his phone and wallet and turned to her.
The fingers press in deeper in Tony, making him squirm delightedly, his hands going into Steve’s hair.
“But not right now,” Tony hastily adds. “ There’s so much to do, I need to hold a press conference for the sudden change in my second gender, Pepper will have kittens and kill Bruce and Cho with her stilettos, and then stab me with her letter opener, and then there’s the Dynamic Duo who started all this nonsense with their creepy ass magic and this is not a fucking comic book—“
Steve lets go of his cock with a pop then licks up the side and takes him in again, his head bobbing up and down while his fingers thrust in and out of Tony’s slick hole. Steve slings one of Tony’s legs over his shoulder, which changes the angle of his fingers, going in more until they find his prostate.
“I thought it was a thing you did,” Steve explains, shamefaced. “You seem to lay it on to whoever you had in front of you.”
“Cut the bullshit Stark,” Steve cut in. “I know you. These are names that are competition for you, and you want us to take care of them so you are free to do more.”
“No,” says Steve stubbornly. “I know what I smelt, and it was you. Tony...you’re my mate.” There was a note of wonder and reverence in his voice. “But, I thought you were a beta.”
“Why yes,” said Stark. “Full immunity is one of my conditions for giving up this list. My lawyer is with the DA as we speak, hammering out terms.” Stark hummed. “Who do you have to blow to get a drink here? I am simply parched.” He said that last line looking at Steve in the most sultry manner possible.
Steve cracked his eyes open, staring blearily at the alarm clock. Jan was curled up on his chest, still deeply asleep. He focused on the red numbers, and jumped, jolting her awake.
Steve is right, as much as Tony hates to admit, as the extra preparation meant that he could barely feel the discomfort of being filled but only that throbbing pleasure as the other man sank inside inch by careful inch. They moan in tandem when Steve sinks to the hilt.
“For a genius, you’re dumb,” Steve says lightly. “I just told you, you’re my friend. I hang out with you, we share pizza late at night, you let me draw in your lab, and I taught Butterfingers how to throw a ball.”
. It starts off slow, getting Tony used to the girth, then when Steve can feel Tony’s tight channel relaxing, starts pistoning in a hard, fast rhythm that Tony had to grab their headboard for purchase.
“Tony, I am so sorry, Tony, I didn’t know, forgive me,” Bruce repeats over and over, pressing Tony’s face into his shoulder.
“Bruce, why does this say that my secondary gender is now an omega?” Tony calls out in a sing song manner, not betraying the panic and fear in his gut.
“The cellular regeneration is truly spectacular,” pipes up Cho. “From the looks of it, you are aging at a slower rate than normal, and this could extend your lifespan by a good few decades, at least.”
Steve sucks around Tony’s cock as he pushes his finger in, spreading slick around as another finger makes it ways in. He scissors inside Tony, keeping up with the movements of his mouth and encouraging Tony to rock up and seek his pleasure.
“What’s that smell?” Steve says slowly, and Tony can imagine his nostrils flaring as he tries to locate the scent. Tony winces and pushes against Bruce again. The other man relents and lets go, wiping at his eyes beneath his glasses.
Bruce collapses on the chair by Tony again, and Tony stares at him, fearing the worst. This was it, wasn’t it. He’s going to die. But...there was a lot of things he hasn’t done yet! Hasn’t even...told him anything yet, never got the chance to ask him for a coffee or anything like that and see where it took them. He was finally going to be brave.
“You were seriously injured,” Bruce explains, avoiding his eye. Tony can sense the guilt coming off in waves from the other scientist.
Steve takes the elevator out of the workshop and Tony could hear his bots chirping madly in the back while FRIDAY pipes up with a, “Have fun, boss!” Tony buries his face on Steve’s shoulder and groans, “It’s like my kids are rooting for me to have sex!”
Steve stared at him, as if he couldn’t believe the audacity of talking about his retirement like this. Conscience? He had one of those? As if he didn’t hurt Steve the way he did ten years ago.
Fury rounded the corner of his desk, and the other two followed him. He went down the steps, and to the glass and steel cage, where Stark was sitting quietly, then looking delighted when he saw who was with him.
Tony leans back against Steve as he continues his ministrations. He cleans the both of them quickly when he notices Tony getting sleepier, helping Tony out of the the tub before drying him with a giant towel while checking him for tears. Tony groans when Steve applies a soothing cream around his rim and Steve kisses him in apology. Pyjamas are put on and teeth are brushed then they go back to bed, climbing into the cool sheets.
There was a chair a few feet away and Steve dragged it with him, sitting in front of Stark, far away enough for his sanity.
“I like doing it,” Steve shrugs and their door opens automatically when sensing them near. FRIDAY, and her quest to get her creator get laid as much as possible. “Makes me feel like I’m taking good care of my fella.”
Steve stops his babbling by putting a hand across his mouth. Tony glares at him and contemplates licking his hand but it might enflame him. Steve’s smile is incandescent.
, quicker than either Tony or Bruce can register and he has Tony in his arms, his face buried in Tony’s neck.
A comfortable silence stretches between them as they lean against the same door, small smiles on their faces.
“What is it?” Jan asked sleepily, starting to sit up. Her short dark hair was in disarray, a rare sight for the fashion designer who was always at the height of poise and fashion.
Tony runs to the bathroom as soon as he is in, and takes note of himself in the mirror. He wants to see what happened below, but he can’t make himself. It’s all so strange and frightening.
As soon as he stepped out, several black unmarked SUVs came to the door, surrounding his car, their sirens wailing.
. That is the only word Tony could describe as Steve breaches inside him. They don’t really have a lot of penetrative sex as Steve fears tearing Tony but whenever they do, it was amazing and this time is no exception.
Steve shoves a few pillows underneath Tony and then slicks his fingers up. Without warning, he swallows Tony down as a finger circles gently into his awaiting hole then pushing in.
Steve recognised the name. “That’s good, but he works for the CRSSB. I’m the newest agent for National Security.”
“I think you know the extent of my injuries,” starts Tony. “The cradle wasn’t healing me fast enough. Bruce and I were experimenting with nanites that could be injected into the bloodstream to accelerate healing. Bruce used it as a last ditch attempt to get me stable enough for surgery but it did more than that.”
“I was born an omega,” Tony says quietly, but no doubt the super soldier can hear it. “Howard didn’t like it. Just before I presented before puberty, he took me to a vacation, he called it.” The acid in his voice can melt the door. “But it was for surgery. I was injected everyday with this cocktail of medication to change my hormones, then I had surgery to change everything down there. My opening was stitched closed I came back to my mother a beta. So, please, dear Captain, please forgive me for panicking out of my mind!”
“Hmmm…” says Steve before looking at him in the eye. “I hoped you would say that.” His expression is affectionate with a shot of dark desire that makes Tony swallow in anticipation.
He goes back to the bedroom, changes the bedsheets for fresh ones complete with hospital corners, and grabs pyjamas for them both. When he slips into the tub behind Tony, the other man was basically boneless, ready to be moved to however Steve wants as Steve cleans him gently with a washcloth.
Steve stared at Stark like he was ghost. A fucking nightmare, if Steve was honest. He felt the bottom of his stomach drop down to his toes the moment he set eyes on him, and a visceral part of his psyche screamed. He was getting a cramp from fisting his hands so tightly.
“FRIDAY, fill up the tub, will you?” Steve asks. He rolls out of bed, and with a movement of those ridiculous shoulders, carries Tony in his arms. Again. For the second time that night and heads for the bathroom.
Tony removes his hand away from his face but doesn’t let go of his hand. He smiles back. Maybe something good can come out of this.
Without further ado, Steve hauls him in his arms, and Tony would demand to be put down if he isn’t so aroused himself. He’s never had a partner who was able to do this before and he kind of relishes the feeling of being the one taken care of. For once.
Tony squeezed his hand one more time before stepping into the building, going up to the guards stationed near the entrance. He passed his passport over to the guard behind the bulletproof glass.
Yet, Tony wanted—wants—more, he can no longer deny that. His body gives a little shudder at the thrill of being—being
“Steve! How lovely to see you again!” Stark started to struggle in his restraints since he was put in them. “Come closer, sweetheart, and let me look at you. It’s been a while.”
“Of course, but I want to converse with Steve.” His eyes were now sharp. “And only Steve. But do be a dear, Fury, and take this cage away for the minute. I’ll stay in my chair. I’ll be good.”
Tony gave his toes an experimental wiggle, but for some reason, the pain is receding somewhat, and did Bruce up his morphine without him knowing?
Steve grins at him lazily, bringing up Tony’s hand to his mouth and presses a soft kiss to his knuckles. Tony certainly does not melt into a puddle of goo. Good lord, this man is determined to kill him. The nanites might not be enough next time to revive him.
Tony dresses but studiously ignores anything down below and just hikes his boxers up. There’s still work to do, that weird little girl with the witchy powers and her brother, Flash. Maybe with the Mind Stone in their possession, he can make everyone helmets that can disrupt her mind altering powers.
Tony didn’t dare to look at his partner, not wanting to see the slight twinkle in his eyes. “I am not doing this to see
The bathroom is filled with scented steam as Steve steps inside, the bath ready and smelling of lavender.
A woman stepped out the passenger side of the closest one. She had dark hair and eyes, and wore a no-nonsense pantsuit. Steve saw her badge hooked on her belt, and her gun holster on the other side.
But Steve is not done, keeping up his motions until Tony is a sobbing, overstimulated mess, and Steve comes inside with a shudder and a moan. His breathing is ragged and Tony feels a small measure of pride that he can reduce the super soldier into pants. Steve puts down Tony’s legs on the bed, pulls out with a small hiss, and removes the pillows from underneath Tony. He collapses beside him on the bed and gathers him back in his arms.
“I must admit I have...aided a few of those names but it has come to my attention that they need to be stopped. They are doing far more harm than necessary.”
Tony, meanwhile, stood by the FBI seal on the floor, dropping his bag to the ground, folding up his jacket and taking off his hat.
“Tony! Of course not! But you—you’re a showman, you’re used to laying on the charm for work, so I thought it was just another facet of you.” Steve smiles crookedly at him. “It didn’t matter to me, though, because I was the only one who ever got to see you conked out on your bench at three in the morning with pepperoni on your face.”
He turned to his best friend, a brittle smile on his lips. “I know you don’t approve, but I am tired, my darling. It’s time for me to retire.”
He went from one of the most respected army contractors, to one of the most wanted men in the world. Interpol had a similar file on him.
“I was so scared,” Steve admits. Tony can see him making himself more comfortable, leaning against the door and stretching his legs out. “I think I was near out of my mind with worry. Clint kept offering me Valium and Natasha was ready to stab me.”
Steve squared his shoulders. “No. I was a Captain in the fucking army. Whoever is behind this should be the one worried.”
Steve lowers Tony in the bath and Tony practically melts, the water a perfect temperature and soothing his sore muscles.
He tries to sit up, but his body protests strongly, the pain making itself known in places it didn’t hurt before. Whatever they had him on, he needed another dose stat.
“So, after we catch all of these people on your so-called Blacklist you think we’ll let you go?” Steve said incredulously.
Fury had a file on the bastard an inch thick of his known crimes but he knew the reality was much longer.
Tony screams and grips Steve’s hair hard enough to hurt if the soldier didn’t have such a high pain tolerance.
“Maria Hill,” she introduced herself, taking out her badge and showing it to Steve. “I work for Executive Assistant Director Nick Fury.”
Immediately, Tony cuddles close, seeking Steve’s warmth and tipping his face up for his customary goodnight kiss.
And Tony understands, knows about Steve growing up skinny and sickly. How he never thought he’d be this strong, and it was a fantasy of his to be able to carry his bride to the threshold. Well, it was more groom in the end but the sentiment was the same and the giddy happiness he showed at being able to do that made Tony’s heart swell.
“We injected you with the nanites,” Bruce admits, his voice tiny and soft. “It worked. Your body accepted the nanite and they started to repair your body faster than the cradle ever could.”
“I’m sorry for all the cloak and dagger, Agent Rogers,” he said, shaking Rogers’ hand. “However, time was of the essence.”
Tony springs up from the bed, and stares at himself in the mirror in the bathroom. He looks like him—only twenty years younger.
“Of course not, you’re a mere Special Agent. Only the upper echelons of crime and this agency have heard of it.” Stark took a deep breath before continuing. “It’s a list of the most dangerous criminals on this planet, more dangerous than I am. They are names not a lot of other people have heard of, and they remain that way. Until now.
Steve, in answer, trails kisses down Tony’s throat, nibbling at a shoulder, trailing lower and catching a pebbled nipple between his teeth. His fingers were like a brand on Tony’s skin as they caressed each spot they could reach. Steve kisses Tony’s abs, hips, and sucking a deep purple hickey on an inner thigh that would have Tony hiss in pain but he was too far gone in pleasure to make a noise different to a moan.
Rhodey put a hand on his shoulder, the twinkle in his eyes slightly dimmed but there was that soft look he reserved for him alone. Tony sighed internally. Why couldn’t he have fallen for this man instead? He knew that Rhodey would have made him happy if he had given him the chance, but that was the past. Rhodey was happy with Carol. They tried to hide it from him but he knew. And couldn’t be more pleased that they found each other.
Steve threw on some clothes hurriedly, got his suit on, and made for the kitchen for a cup of coffee to have in the car and maybe a granola bar. He couldn’t believe he overslept. But Jan was very proud of him, finally getting the job he worked hard at Quantico for, and showed it enthusiastically last night. Several times, in fact.
“Well, didn’t you know that Howard knew one of the psychos who did that crap,” Tony’s voice was dangerously low, a tremble and a hitch at points.
“Ah, yeah, we were going to get into that,” Bruce intones. “We were quite confused as to how you went from a beta to an omega but it could be due to the nanites.”
“Tony, oh god, baby doll,” Steve says brokenly. The endearment makes something in Tony’s chest flare and he flicks up a screen so the hallway is in view. Steve is on the floor, his face buried in his hands.
A knock came on his door, and Hill came in with a tall blond man. His blue eyes landed on Fury and he snapped to attention.
“Office, as usual,” Jan shrugged, taking a sip of her brew. “I don’t have to be in until eleven anyway.”
Bruce bit his lip before saying, “I know that. The team has told me that. But still…” he sighed. “You were in a bad shape, Tony.” He takes his glasses off, rubs his eyes before continuing. “Helen and I—even the cradle wasn’t working fast enough to prevent complete organ shutdown with the damage you took!”
Tony can barely breathe when Steve descends upon him again, skin to skin. He grinds up against that hard body above him, gasping at the friction.
Tony’s nose flares; he wants to snap at them but can understand how exciting this is from a scientific view. However, it is his body that was just willy nilly used as a guinea pig—sure it saved his life, but there’s ethics and shit!
“The nanites also regressed your age,” Bruce explains. Tony looks at his hands, unscarred, his face devoid of his customary wrinkles. His hair had lost its grey tinge and is now dark and full. His body no longer had the normal aches and pains due to aging and half a lifetime of debauchery.
“Go away, Steve,” Tony says loudly. “I don’t know what happened in the lab, but get it out of your system now.”
After some time, the biters seemed to thin out, and Steve realized with relief that the end of the bridge was in sight.  But as soon as the thought came to him, Tony vanished from view, and Steve realized in horror that he'd fallen to the ground.  He looked as though he were on the verge of screaming.  Still mindful of the biters close by, Steve held back his exclamation and cautiously stepped toward Tony, kneeling down onto the stone.  "Tony," he whispered.  "Are you okay?"
"You shouldn't blame yourself," Steve said.  Always, always, Tony looked to himself first for the flaw.
There were a lot of them.  Various men in uniform who Tony assumed were the famed Howling Commandos—they looked vaguely familiar, at least.  There was one man in particular who kept on showing up, labeled as “Bucky”.  Then there was a woman, too, labeled only as “Agent 13”.
“It won’t,” Tony assures him, having looked up the specs to the hospital bed’s make and model before Steve had even finished saying
They headed off, Cap leading the way as he walked forward with his non-shield arm held out.  For a moment, Tony considered taking the fragment back from Cap—he was fairly sure the fragment orienting itself wasn't dependent on who was holding it—but it felt wrong.  It was Cap's discovery, and he should be the one to see it through.
"Oh," said a voice, and Steve almost jumped before realizing it was just Stark.  He was holding an ice pick, standing over the fallen bodies of two biters.  "Christ.  I was half-afraid they'd figured out how to turn knobs.  Thank God you made it."
"The hell—" Steve began, but then he felt a hand against his shoulder, turning to see Stark shaking his head at him.  Steve was tempted to keep yelling anyway, but something in Stark's eyes made him go quiet.  It felt so wrong, brutally stabbing what must have once been a friend of hers, but… it was done.  "Now what?" he asked after a moment.
Tony nodded, picking up the gauntlet and cuddling it to himself idly.  Maybe Rogers was right.  Maybe he should just get some rest now.  “You’ll keep an eye out?” he asked.
Cap stared at him, and Tony found himself regretting the lecture.  "Uh, sorry," he added hastily.  "I just—"
Steve stared down at the items Natasha had left on the table before turning his gaze to Tony.  "Love matters," he repeated.
No answer.  Too much water, too much creaking.  He whimpers and jumps when something touches him, and he belatedly realizes it’s a floating chair.
“Don’t be stubborn,” Steve tells him, hands cupping Tony’s face even though Howard’s watching them.  “Tony, your father’s giving you a chance to live.  Take it.”  One thumb reaches up, stroking Tony’s cheek.  “Everything’s gonna be fine.  There are more lifeboats.  I’ll get on one of them, and when a rescue ship comes we’ll meet there, okay?”
At the end of the two weeks, they crossed the Saint John River, and just like that, they were on American soil.  The homecoming was not nearly as sweet as Steve had imagined back when the war was still raging, and yet—he felt something inside him relax at being
Tony closed his eyes, let out a long exhale, and then opened them again.  "I was so angry," he said quietly.  "Finding out what you'd kept hidden.  Thinking you didn't trust me."  He paused, as though waiting for Steve to say something, but Steve knew Tony wanted to continue, and so he kept quiet.  Tony nodded to himself.  "And then I listened to you—die.  And something clicked.  I realized why you hadn't wanted to tell me before.  So I understand now, a little.  I don't think I'll ever
Stark followed his gaze.  "Well, since sound is out of the question, smell's all we've got left," he said.  He then set the moss down, pulling out a ball of twine from his pack and unwinding the threads.  "So here's the plan.  If the biters are all still trapped in the school, it's a safe bet the doors are secure.  So we go in through a window.  But if there were as many people in the school as Jessica said, then there'll probably be biters at the window, too.  And that's where our friend, the ball of moss, comes in."
There was a pause as Stark looked like he wanted to say something, but in the end he just nodded and ran his fingers through his hair.  "Right," he managed.  "But we need a plan.  The door obviously isn't an option, and if we leave through the window we'll be back at square one, except worse, because we have no Jessica or smoke bomb."
Tony hesitated, thinking about the way Cap had been drawn to the fragments, the way he'd stared at them.  He thought again of the thick lines of black ink in the files Fury had given him, hiding the truth of what had happened to those who had interacted closely with them.  He didn't want that happening to Cap.
"Liar," the man hissed, and Tony jolted despite himself.  The movement, fortunately, was mostly hidden beneath the bulky armor, which Tony was grateful for.  He rolled closer, seemingly undeterred by the gauntlets Tony was still holding up.  "Look at me."
A little nervous, Tony poked his head in to see what was going on, only to be greeted by the sight of what looked like an old - well, probably new, relative to Steve's time - newsreel being projected onto one of the walls, one that was apparently captivating the attention of several men, if the small crowd around it was anything to go by.  Some sort of propaganda?
.  Well, if the smell of the kitchen was anything to go by, then maybe it was indeed Jarvis who stood across from him now.
was on the tip of his tongue, and yet Tony couldn't bring himself to stop him.  Surely Steve would object, but the thing was - Tony wanted to see what was in there, too.  He knew what he
Tony’s lips quirk upward.  “It’s the Schrödinger equation,” he informs him, and when Steve continues to look confused, Tony adds, “Her words, I mean.  It has to do with particles.  You know, like Pym particles.  Jan’s convinced this means Hank’s her soulmate, but you can guess what happened when she tried telling him that.”
“Go away,” he says, but as he looks the newcomer over, he is suddenly struck by several things at once—the blue of his eyes, the broadness of his shoulders, the largeness of the hand outstretched toward him, as though that alone will somehow keep Tony from falling.  At the same time, though, he takes in his rumpled clothes and filthy boots.  Third class.  This man is from third class.  What is he talking to him for?
Tony gives Steve an easy smile, feeling a little more like himself now that he has a plan to piss people off.  “Sure he does.  Right, Steve?”
.  “Alright,” he said, reaching out to grab a vine, testing its strength.  Seemed sturdy enough.  He wondered if there was a way he could manage to swing Rogers across, too, but there just wasn’t enough he could work with.  It didn’t matter, he supposed.  Rogers would jump, and he’d make it, and then they could continue and everything would be fine.  “Off I go.”
Suddenly, an idea springs to mind—a glorious, wonderful idea, sure to displease both Sunset and his father.  Hell, why not?  He might as well have
"That car's not gonna last for long," Steve murmured.  The screaming was only winding them up further, and they were pounding into the car as hard as they could, trying to get inside.  "Ready for a fight?"
"Hm," Steve's mom said.  The dubious look faded away, replaced with a smile.  "You're very talented, Stevie," she said. "I know you can do anything you put your mind to."
Even though he knew it was a completely irrational thing to do, he shook the stone in his hand like he would a pair of dice, as though some kinetic energy might be enough to make it glow again.  Rather predictably, though, it stayed dark, and if it weren’t for the fact that he and Rogers had argued over this less than five minutes ago, Tony would have thought that he’d just imagined it all.
sent a jolt of excitement through his body, and before he could stop himself, he was sitting up, reaching out even as he blearily tried to blink the sleep out of his eyes.  "Give it to me."
He wouldn't realize it until years later, but that was the first time he switched with the boy he would come to know as Steve Rogers.
Tony looked at the map, then back at Rogers.  God.  “Boy Scout doesn’t even begin to describe you,” he said.  He brought out one of his own toys, a tracking device he’d designed years ago but hadn’t had a chance to use until now—wars tended to take up a lot of his time.  “I was thinking we’d use this instead.”
Steve blinked back at him in turn, breaking into a wide, dazzling smile, and Tony felt himself go dizzy again.  “‘Oh’?” he repeated.  “You successfully turned me back, and that’s all you have to say?  ‘Oh’?”
But he was needed.  And he was in a position to help others.  Those things were important, and knowing that—well, maybe he was a little glad.
"They do," Fury replied.  "The difference is that this time, we know it's real, and we know it has some sort of power.  Keep reading."
“Fine.”  Steve pulls them into a nearby room, which fortunately looks deserted, then shuts the door and looks at him again.  “There.  No one’s around to see us.  Now will you tell me what’s wrong?”
Tony spent the next few minutes going over the way the suit fit together.  They didn't have a lot of time and honestly, the level of detail he was going into wasn't strictly necessary—but it was clear Cap wanted to learn about it, and Tony… well, Tony wanted to please him.
Steve went to inspect the workstation, but unsurprisingly, most of what he saw was foreign to him.  Still, he had to smile - between this, Jarvis' comments, and Tony's voicelogs, it was blindingly clear that Tony had an eye for mechanics and liked to tinker with things.  It was admirable, really. He wanted to learn and improve, and it was probably something Steve could do better at.
Before he could say anything more, though, Steve turned around and dashed away, vanishing into the foliage.
," Pepper said, and this time her smile was more genuine.  She leaned down and kissed his forehead.  "Be good, okay?"
The words aren’t some sort of sweeping romantic sentiment.  They’re warnings, omens, harbingers.  They claimed his mother, and now they’ve claimed Steve as well.
His dad's letter…?  Tony panicked briefly, having no idea what Bucky was talking about - until he realized there was something tucked away between the pages of the sketchbook.  He opened it up, finding a folded piece of paper inside and skimming over the words written within. He knew this letter. It was the last letter Steve's dad had written to his mom, the one that spoke of the horrors of war while simultaneously professing that he would do this again and again if that was what it took to keep her safe.  What was it doing here, he wondered?
The door opens with a click, and Steve has to force himself not to flail and send his pencils flying.  He quickly turns his head to look, but to his relief—or maybe it’s disappointment—Tony isn’t naked, but wearing what looks like a silk bathrobe.  “Relax, Steve,” Tony tells him, catching sight of his expression and smirking.  “I’ll take this off in a moment.”  He approaches him languidly, continuing, “I believe we’ve yet to discuss any payment.”
, he nearly wanted to add, but something made him hold back.  Maybe it was too much. "But I had to try. Maybe I succeeded.  I don't know. I hope so. Just… no matter what, Tony, know that you're amazing.  And you will be alright."
There was a loud thump at the door.  Steve tried blocking it out, but then there was another thump, louder this time, accompanied by the sound of wood cracking.  "What—" he began, and then there was an agonizing pain in his neck, and he gasped, stumbling back at the same time Tony burst in, his eyes looking wild.
When the funeral ended, they retreated back into their room, Steve still weak from the bite and Tony in no condition to walk for long distances.  A few hours later, Natasha came in, holding out some papers.  "I believe these are yours," she said, offering them to Tony.
As far as he could tell, he had two options.  The first one was that he'd rather suddenly developed another personality named Steve Rogers who had taken over him for a day, while he'd dreamed about being Steve Rogers in 1940.  There was medical precedent for this, though maybe not quite like what he'd experienced. But it was a
dish,” Tony insists.  He could, of course, tell Rhodey that he’s finally found who his words belong to—but it’s such a source of shame and sorrow that he doesn’t think he can ever tell anyone about it, and so he doesn’t.  “Get back to work.  I’m looking at the security feeds and it seems like Hank’s looking for you.”  Technically a lie, but a thought is all that’s needed to make Hank think there’s something going on in the room Rhodey’s in, and that’s enough.
"For now."  Steve looked through as well—from what he could see, Stark was right, and the hallway beyond seemed empty.  "Stand back."  He drew his shield and then in one quick motion, shattered the glass with a loud crack that was impossible to miss.
“It wasn’t worth it,” Tony whispers, but the one person who needed to hear it most is lost to him forever.
Steve nodded.  There was—there was something desperate in his eyes.  Desperate and fearful and worried, and it made Tony’s heart ache.  “Steve, no,” he said, cautiously reaching up to touch Steve’s head.  “Is this because you feel like me getting hurt is your fault?  It’s not.  Really.  And I’m okay.  We’re both okay.  I’m not going to hurt you.  Don’t be like this.”
Ty didn't even bother replying.  He instead rolled his eyes and walked off, picking up a tray and going to one of the stations.  Steve followed his lead, grabbing a tray of his own as he went to see what was available. There were scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns, muffins, scones, and exotically-colored cereal, and he ended up getting a little of everything.  Then there was an
"Well, you only have a week to figure it out," Ma said.  "But you're my sunshine boy. I know you can find anyone if that's what you actually want."
The sketchbook came flying back at him, but with reflexes Tony hadn't even realized he'd had, he nabbed it out of the air easily, setting it down automatically onto his lap.  Bucky was already leaning back and looking unimpressed. "You're so weird," he said.
And this is the way things are, for a while.  Tony rotates between running S.H.I.E.L.D., performing superheroics, monitoring Bucky—who, for Steve’s sake, he’s appointed to be the new Captain America—and waking up in the middle of the night screaming.  His friends and teammates will occasionally—frequently—express worry, and Tony will brush them off.
Tony squinted into the foliage.  It was hard to tell, since it was daytime, but… "Torches?" he tried.  He couldn't see much directly, but whatever it was, it was giving off a flickering light that was reflecting off the leaves.
Tony doesn’t see Steve again until he finds himself in Asgard, battling Osborn and his goons.  It’s hard, he thinks, pretending everything’s okay when everything
include blowing the kitchen up, thank you very much, Jarvis - he was pushing the door open to her room, glass and plate in hand.  "Room service is here."
He can see Steve’s body stiffen, and for a terrifying moment, he’s afraid that Steve is just going to ignore him, to pretend he never even heard him.  But that moment passes, and the other man turns to face him, a series of expressions flashing across that handsome face of his.  Shock.  Anxiety.  Hope.
Tony turns to stare at him, and Steve feels his cheeks flush a little at the scrutiny.  “Are you real?” he asks after a moment.  Steve just stares back, unsure how to answer that, and Tony continues, glancing away, “No one’s ever really listened to anything I have to say before.”
Steve must be sensing his impatience, because in the next instant, his lips are by his ear as he murmurs, “Go on.  You can open your eyes now.”
hadn't been where he'd last left it.  Still, after finding nothing different in his sketchbooks, Steve had to admit, he wasn't really expecting anything from this new finding.  Nonetheless, he dutifully opened his journal up, flipping over to the last entry -
“Oh, my God,” Tony breathes, and right now he’s feeling the exact opposite of calm, running to his lab so he can suit up.  “Where is he now?  How’d he get shot?  Did you get whoever did it?”
He watches as his Tony—his beautiful, brave Tony—disappears into the hallway, and he wonders if it’s better or worse if he never sees him again.
Tony's lips quirked upward at that, and he smiled, looking fond.  "I know, darling," he said.  "Well, I suppose if we have at least
Right.  Breathing is good.  Steve takes a few deep breaths, looking around, but no one seems to have paid them any heed, aside from the occasional glare directed at him and his clothes.  He looks back at Tony, who is lightly brushing a finger against one of the nudes, looking contemplative.  Then he flips back to the Peggy drawings, studying these again with just as much intensity.  “I bet you don’t find me very brave or smart,” he says softly after a long silence.
"Yeah, apparently."  Ty threw something at his face; Steve pulled it off and saw that it was some sort of school uniform.  "Finish your coffee and get dressed so we can go to practice. We both know I'm going to be on top of the leaderboard this year, but victory is sweeter if I actually have to fight you for it."
“Fine, fine,” Tony replied, waving one arm.  “Don’t—ah—don’t mind me.”   God, his chest felt awful, like a weight was pressing down upon it, squeezing the air out of his lungs.  In an attempt to hopefully clear up whatever the hell it was, he took several deep breaths, preferring the pain from his fractured ribs to… this.  Not that he knew what
“Let go for me,” Tony whispers, breath hot against his ear.  “Prove it to me—prove that I can make you feel good—”
"Yes," Tony managed.  It would have been nice if he were capable of saying more than one word at a time, but he supposed that he wasn't in a state to ask for much right now.  "What—" he paused to cough, then continued, "happened?"  Progress!  Two words now.
Steve just stared at him for a moment, then lowered his head and took a massive bite out of the body, starting to chew and seemingly oblivious to the blood running down his neck.  “Well, that’s nice,” Tony said, making a face as he put his knife away.  At least he wouldn’t have to get his hands bloody, though he wasn’t sure that this was actually all that much better.  A part of him wanted to watch in morbid fascination as Steve just… chomped away, while another part wanted to run off and go empty his stomach.
“R-right,” Steve says, long after Tony’s gone.  Is this a dream?  Is he just imagining a rich, handsome man asking him to draw him naked?  Shaking his head to clear it, he goes back into the room they entered in, rearranging some of the furniture in something of a daze.  When he’s done, he takes a seat, then pulls out his materials and sets up his workspace.  His hands are shaking, and Tony’s not even here yet.  It’s just… well.  He’s never felt about anyone the way he feels about Tony.
“He’s not vile,” Tony replies.  He downs another cup and refills it again.  God, he loves coffee.  “And are you two seriously at the point where you have to send people to go off and stalk me now?  Isn’t that kind of creepy?”
Nonetheless, as they spend more time together, Tony finds ways in which she surely is the one.  After all, like Thomas Paine, she’s ambitious, revolutionary.  Like the quote, she enjoys challenges, knowing that glorious, certain victory will come with enough effort.  And the more he thinks about these things, the more he’s convinced.  His words are for Sunset, and Tony thinks there’s nothing he wants more than to spend the rest of his life with her.
Everything was gray.  Steve flattened himself on the ground, eyes stinging as he slowly shuffled ahead, avoiding the shambling feet of the biters passing by him.  There was no sign of the other two; instead, there was only a long hallway with lockers lining the walls.  He wasn't sure how fast it took for someone to turn once they were bitten, so he could only hope that neither of them was currently stumbling through the hall with the other biters.
Steve blinks at him, playing over what he just said in his head—oh.  That.  This wasn’t how he’d planned on telling him, but apparently it just slipped out on its own, and what good would it do to deny it?  He swallows, stroking his cheek with a finger.  “I love you,” he repeats, feeling oddly calm now, despite all the commotion around them.  “Is… is that alright?”
"We can't—" Steve began, and then he tripped over a fallen tree branch.  Before he knew it, he was crashing to the ground, Bucky's body tumbling past him like a ragdoll.  He cursed to himself and struggled back to his feet, but his limbs gave up on him, and he fell back down.
Steeling himself, Tony finally made himself open up the lid, letting it scan his face and boot up everything.  How must Steve have felt when he saw the new GUI with its new layout and colors, he wondered? Had he figured out that the laptop had a touchscreen?  Would he have marveled at it, or was he too jaded by everything by now?
“Shut up!” Tony interrupts, managing to pull away from his grasp, but Howard just takes hold of him again, and there’s a brief scuffle—he thinks he hears the words
“Los Angeles,” Tony replies, and he tries not to flinch when Steve’s shoulders slump.  “We still have phones and emails.  And anyway, it’s just a quinjet ride away.”  They had, after all, spent several quinjet rides going to and from the poppy reserve once.  It feels like a lifetime ago, and maybe that’s because it is.
“You learn a lot of things when you’re in a war,” Rogers said softly.  “Especially when you’re in the middle of nowhere with injured men.”
“I’m very much a self-made woman,” Sunset tells him the day they first meet, and Tony finds himself hopelessly smitten.  And it’s strange, he thinks, because he’s not entirely sure if he should be falling so hard for someone who doesn’t seem to be immediately connected to his words, but here he is anyway, head over heels.  He’d try and sneak notes off her if he could to compare the handwriting, but she never writes anything in front of him, only types away on her portable computer.
“…And your government contacts should serve us well,” Howard is saying.  “They’ll want weapons.  War is approaching the Balkans; I can smell it—”
Tony felt like it was a lot more than just Cap's job.  He was starting to think that maybe it was just who Cap was.  It was almost frustrating how determined he was to not be praised for anything, but it was oddly endearing, too.  "Either way," he said.  "Glad you were there."
never showed any of that boring stuff, but you guys kept watch at night, didn’t you?  I’m surprised you’re still in one piece otherwise.”
Steve knew better than to say something.  No matter what he did, no matter if he replied or didn't reply, nothing would change how Tony's Pa currently felt.
nothing.  This happened all the time - no need to make a big fuss over it.  "I mean, he's the only one who's ever had a problem with me," he said in an attempt to make her feel better.  "I've never mentioned anyone else doing this, have I?"
“Shush,” Tony says, placing a finger on his lips.  “I was studying diagrams of the ship earlier.  Only the crew and I know how to easily find this place, and the crew has no reason to come down here until we dock.  Is that answer satisfactory?  Because I’d really like to seduce you now.”
But among the fear there was joy and there was beauty and there was love.  He had seen it all.  And no matter what happened—it
The words sting, but Steve can’t quite bring himself to believe them.  Not yet.  “I don’t know about that,” he replies softly, and Tony stops squirming in his arms.  Sensing that maybe Tony’s going to start listening, he presses on—“Tony, I know it’s hard.  I know that for some crazy, insane reason, your fiancée only wants you for your money, and your father isn’t proud of anything you do.  I don’t know why, because I—I can’t understand how anyone can look at you and not see what I do.”  He sighs, glancing away for a moment.  “And I also know that no matter what your father does or says, he’s still your father.  And that’s not the sort of thing you can easily ignore.  But Tony… if you keep on listening to him, you’re going to die.  Maybe not physically, not for a long time.  But the rest of you… everything that I’ve come to like about you… that’s gonna burn out.  And you’ll be empty, and I can’t watch that happen.  All I want is for you to be happy, Tony.  That’s it.”
Steve laughs.  “You know, somehow I’m under the impression that I’m the one who needs lessons—”  He cuts off abruptly as the world around them seems to shudder, arms tightening around Tony protectively.  “Tony,” he gasps after a moment, once the ground seems to be steady again.  “What—what was that?”
The time passes quickly.  Tony just… flows out of his pencil, and before he knows it, he’s done.  It’s perfect, he thinks.  Not as perfect as Tony, but to have captured even a part of his essence is enough to make for a beautiful piece of artwork.  “Alright,” he says, signing his name with a flourish and standing up.  “It’s finished.”  He glances back at Tony, who is now stretching.  Steve swallows, looking back at the drawing again.  “Do you… do you want to see?”
Speaking of which, he hadn’t actually yet eaten anything today.  He dug out the franks and beans from earlier, going to heat them by the fire as he cast another glance at Steve, who seemed merrily oblivious.  Should he point out that at this time yesterday, he’d been eating cooked chicken and rice with a fork?  Probably not, he supposed.  Steve was surely having a difficult time adjusting, and if he could just forget about it all for a little bit, then that was good… right?  Right, of course.  So Tony ate his franks and beans without comment, washing it down with some more aspirin, then discreetly scooted back into the cave to watch him.  The deer carcass was already half gone by now, and Tony had to wonder if Steve was going to eat the whole thing.  Was that even possible?  He supposed it was.  Steve was huge.
He lets out a choked sob, resting his head back against the raft as he looks at Steve’s face, his closed eyes, and he reaches out to brush the frost off it once more, fingers tracing over his nose, his lips, his jaw.  The light shines over him again, but he ignores it this time.  The boat doesn’t matter anymore.  Nothing matters.  He had one reason to go on, and now it’s gone.
The next thing he knew, Tony had managed to find the strength to push himself away from the tree, surging into Steve's arms and holding onto him tight as he kissed him for all he was worth, and for a brief, beautiful moment, Tony's lips were all Steve knew, everything wrong with the world simply a distant memory.  He could do nothing but kiss Tony back, his own arms wrapping around Tony in return, and when Tony finally had to pull away, panting, Steve thought he looked happy.  He was still pale and he was still dying, but the happiness—the happiness on his face was something Steve wanted to remember always.
Tony grinned at that, reaching forward to flick a stray hair out of Steve’s face and watching his big blue eyes light up in surprise.  “Is that so?” he asked.  “You’ll have to tell me all about it.”
For a moment, all he can hear is the ringing of the bullet in his ears; all he can see is a flash of white around him.  But then the white fades, the ringing disappears, and he’s back in a flooding room with Steve gripping at a pole.  His eyes drop down to his wrists at the same time he hears Steve cry out, “Tony, you did it!”
He'd had to make some mental concessions.  Well, more like just a single concession, but it was a big one: he
Tony blinked, tearing his eyes away from… more interesting parts, and took Steve’s hand, managing to stand up as well.  “Yeah,” he said, letting go to rummage around in Steve’s pack, bringing out a shirt and pants a moment later and holding them out to him.
"Yeah," Cap said, squeezing his hand.  So he knew he was holding it, then.  Alright.  "From what I can tell, the attack was an ambush they planned at the last minute when they realized what our trajectory was.  Their goal was probably to get the pieces I was holding, or, barring that, to capture people in our party for either information or for bargaining.  Maybe both."
Steve could hardly believe what he was hearing.  "Do you realize how irrational you sound?  What were you supposed to do?  Kill them all?"
"I've already known that for a long time," Steve murmured.  "Well… thanks for telling me.  We'll get those blueprints back."
Steve's mom smiled a little as she finished up her toast.  "You're young, Stevie," she said. "There's no need to rush anything.  Maybe you'll meet that person later. Or maybe that person's been there this whole time, and you just haven't realized it yet.  That's what happened with me and your Pa. You'll just have to wait and see."
Tony’s suit’s been compromised.  He can’t fight back, and as he takes each blow, he wonders if Steve is thinking about everything they’ve shared.  Who, he wonders, would have ever thought things would end this way?
But the voice had nothing more to offer.  The screen, however, turned black, and rows of white text appeared on it, each of which had the same simplified drawing of what looked like a partially-opened folder to the word's left.  On instinct, Steve leaned forward to examine it more closely, but then he remembered that his eyesight was just fine in this body. That didn't stop him from squinting at it with his brows furrowed, though.
about.  Eventually, though, he reluctantly pulls away with an absolutely filthy sucking sound, though he presses a soft kiss against his tip before slowly stroking him with his hand instead.  “I—” he starts roughly, then coughs and clears his throat before continuing—”I fully expect to be able to finish that properly one of these days.  Promise?”
The other man disappears through the first-class entrance and is gone, leaving Steve there on the deck alone, freezing wind gusting through his hair.
Tony relaxes for a moment, thinking he’s got Steve convinced—but then suddenly Steve’s arms are around him as he bodily hauls Tony onto the lifeboat before a crew member pushes Steve away.  Tony reaches out, needing to touch him one more time, but Steve’s too far now, and the lifeboat is lowering and oh God, this can’t be happening.  He makes an attempt to stand up, but his father pulls him back down, growling at him to stop it, and in response Tony makes a soft sound in the back of his throat, looking up at Steve.
Blindly, Steve slides his hands down Tony’s back, feeling muscle shifting under his skin—and goodness, wouldn’t it be lovely if he could just lie here all day, feeling him?  But he has a task to do, and he has no intention of letting Tony down.  So he slips his hands around to Tony’s front, fingers brushing against the trail of hair that starts just above his pants before moving downward, undoing the buttons there.
There were no wires to cut.  Of course there weren't.  This wasn't designed to be dismantled so easily.  But it was possible, because it was him and there was always, always a failsafe.
But there was so little left now, he thought.  So much had been stripped away, and the few things that still mattered were laid bare.  He had to take this chance.  "Maybe," he continued, "I'm not trying to say anything."  And slowly, cautiously, he leaned forward, pressing his lips to Tony's.
"Hi," Pepper replied.  She was trying to smile, but it was pretty clear she'd been crying.  It was touching, if a bit odd, if only because he was pretty sure he'd gotten himself into some very tight situations before and he didn't think she'd cried then.  Still.  "How are you feeling?"
This time, Tony seemed to hear him, and he jolted, pulling the shovel out.  "Steve," he said, voice raspy.  Whatever strength he'd had seemed to drain out of him, because his knees buckled, and he had to grip hard on his shovel to stay up.
Eighteen years since he had first brought Steve here in the first place, watching his eyes light up in surprise and delight and finding himself inevitably, irrevocably, falling in love.
But today was different.  Steve had been looking out the window when he heard footsteps behind him, and as soon as he smelled the harsh smell of alcohol - so, so unlike the gentle lavender scent Tony's Ma carried with her - he knew that it was going to be bad.
, that hurt.  So he tried again with his left arm, rubbing at his eyes before blearily blinking up at her.  "Hi," he said.
There was a knock at his door, and Tony jumped, realizing a second later that he'd probably been staring at the wall, lost in his thoughts, for the last several minutes.  "I'm coming," he called, sticking the sketchbook into his bag. He was nearly at the door when he realized - his
Progress came soon enough.  The crumbling remains of what were most likely rammed-earth buildings came into view, and they were still the only people around, as far as Tony could tell.  Feeling grateful, he paused, which forced everyone else to stop in their tracks as well.  "Before we go any further, I want everyone to appreciate the enormity of what we're about to step into," he said.  "This is the place where the oracle bones we've been looking at were discovered, which proved the existence of a dynasty and is one of the earliest examples of Chinese writing.  That alone is impressive.  But this was also once a capital city, and it's big.  Really big.  Only part of it has been excavated, and it's probably not the part that has what we're looking for.  We have our work cut out for us."
Jessica turned to glare at him.  "And what, you think I'd just let you do that?  He's your friend, isn't he?  You should trust him!"
The transceivers the others had been carrying had been destroyed at some point, leaving Tony with no choice but to continue their current trajectory and to hope that they hadn't been moved to some other location.  He'd wondered as their signals blinked out how they were going to do this—how they were going to make any sort of progress beyond "arrive at Turkey and find them somehow".
He ran his finger over the rectangle that said "ROAST".  Jarvis was cooking, but a roast sounded nice too, even if it was the morning.  So he pushed it.
.  He awkwardly adjusted the pelt around his body, then looked down at Tony, offering his hand.  “Please tell me you have clothes for me.”
"This guy calls me Stark," Stark said, tilting his head toward Steve, who just sighed.  "But I'd prefer Tony."
They arrived back at their camp a short while later, Steve depositing the deer carcass at the entrance of the cave, looking at Tony.  “Ugh,” he said, kneeling down in front of it.  “This is like a mutant deer.  Why does it have fangs?”  Steve let out a sound that was maybe supposed to approximate a laugh as Tony picked up a stick and prodded it, continuing, “Are you sure this is safe to eat?”
Tony leaned forward to get a better view.  "The tile that triggered the arrow says—Lian, I think.  It was the given name of one of the Shang kings.  The one next to it says horse.  And the next one is Song.  Another name."
lunch.  On top of that, he found homework assignments that he didn't remember, but they had his name on it - not written in his own handwriting - and were already done.  Infuriatingly, the math and science questions just had the answers penciled in and no work showing how the answer had been reached in the first place.
"Make it through this, and we'll chronicle and sell all of these adventures, too," Steve replied as he slumped back against the wall of the compartment.
The pencil doesn’t slow, though Steve’s eyes flicker toward Tony briefly.  “Is there somewhere else I should be?”
"You're so-called heroes who don't kill people unless your lives are in danger, and even then you try to take them alive," Natasha answered.  "And I'm not trapped."
Eventually, he had to accept that he just wasn't going to find the answers he needed, and he brought an end to his feverish search.  He used his new spare time to finally branch out socially, making new friends, new lovers who would never have an inkling that he'd spent part of his life sharing his body with the most wonderful, stubborn soul he'd ever known.  And when some of those people he met hurt and betrayed him, he would remember the things Steve had said to him in his darker times, and then he would pretend that the voicelogs were from yesterday instead of yesteryear and take some small comfort in it.
"I know," Ty said, directing them into another building.  "Now, we all know an Olympic champion's gotta eat. Come on."
So he stepped out of the rows of shelves, his gauntlets aimed at the man as he came into view.  He'd been right—it was the wheelchair man and Cap after all.  Cap was standing with his shield out, his whole body radiating tension, like he was ready to spring into action at any moment.  The man, meanwhile, looked completely at ease, leaning back in his seat, a blanket covering his legs.  He looked utterly unsurprised to see Tony, while Cap stared at him with wide eyes, his lips slightly parted.
It wasn't, and Tony was frankly exhausted and he still hurt everywhere, and yet… he found himself not caring all that much.  "It's fine, Cap," he said.
marked with a king's name, as far as we know," he said, pointing to the one with the horse character on it.  "I'm thinking it might be a safe tile."
He was no expert at orthotics, and he was all too aware of the gap in technology between Steve's time and his own (to say nothing of the gap in wealth), but he'd done enough research to come up with something he could make even with his current resources.
"Worth it," Tony said with a shrug.  He went over to pull open the curtains, figuring some sun might be nice.  Then he made his way to a box sitting under her bed and pulled it out, retrieving some pieces of scrap fabric he knew she kept around.
But now they were both free, and strangely enough, despite spending the past extremely harrowing week with no one but Steve, Tony found himself missing his company.  It was hard to really articulate why.  Maybe part of it boiled down to having shared an experience with him that he’d never shared, and never would share, with anyone else.  Maybe another part of it was how fearless Steve was around him, how he’d seen Tony’s weaknesses and didn’t think any less of him, still drawing his face and labeling him as
Steve rushed toward him, wrapping his arms around his body to keep him steady.  "What the hell was that?" he asked.
“You’re not gonna fall over.”  And Steve sounds so damn assured of this fact that Tony finds himself relaxing almost instantly, leaning back into his solid presence—though as soon as he does, his mind starts to find something else to fret about.  They’re standing here at the bow of the ship, their bodies pressed close together in a way that’s hard to ignore.  What if someone sees them?
“I’m sorry, Father,” he tells him as they pass by a lower deck, and he turns and jumps back onto the ship.
Instead, he tried some of the other adjacent tiles, carefully triggering them with his toes.  Finally he found one that seemed safe, albeit awkwardly positioned from his current spot.  But as soon as he started stepping over to it, a loud, pulsing sound issued from aboveground, enough that Tony could feel the vibration in his bones, and he found himself losing his balance—
Time passes, and eventually, the screams fade away.  The officer with the whistle seems to have given up.  The lifeboats are no closer than they were before.
...No, he wouldn't, Tony realized.  Since Tony had first found Ma sick in her room all those weeks ago, Steve had never mentioned a thing about it.  Tony had, of course - he'd brought it up in every single entry he'd written since. But while Steve had replied to individual points -
But now here was Steve's mom, smiling at him like he was the greatest thing in the world and telling him that she believed in him.  And Tony didn't know how to handle it.
He couldn't, it seemed - or at least, he wouldn't even be given the chance to try.  He graduated at the top of his class, Ty right behind him, and then he continued on to MIT.
“Yeah,” Tony said again.  He grinned, feeling like a huge weight had been lifted off his shoulders.  Getting back home was nothing compared to what he’d feared had happened to Steve.  “Don’t worry.  I have a plan.”  He reached into his own pack, thankful that he’d gone through the trouble of lugging everything with him, even after Steve had run off.  “Remember those fireworks you saw earlier?  The ones you looked like you wanted to nag me about?”
"Doesn't mean they're not true."  Tony looked his way, only to find that he was looking back at him now.  They were still holding hands.  Then Steve got up off the floor, moving closer to Tony and maneuvering him into an embrace.  Tony was more than happy to go along with it, even if Steve was talking nonsense.
He felt himself hoping that he would never see any of them again so that he wouldn't have to face such a choice, and then he felt ashamed.
.  Tony was still processing it.  But then his body remembered how achey and tired it was, and he sagged forward again, this time without the suit to keep him standing.  Cap—Steve—was by his side in an instant, strong arms wrapping around him so that he wouldn't fall over.  "It's nice to meet you too," Steve said.  "I just wish it were under slightly better circumstances."
"—But I think maybe we can work something out," Cap continued, before Tony could say anything more.  "I know the Nazis are looking all over the world.  But that's gotta involve Europe at least some of the time, right?  So maybe when your searches take you there, we can work together.  I don't think that's out of the question."
an option.  Luke's out there in the forest and I'm not going to make things harder for him by unleashing a building of biters onto him."
"Get away from him!" Steve cried, sending the shield flying again—the angle wasn't a good one, though, not if he didn't want to hurt Tony as well, and though the shield hit Tem and sent him sprawling, it landed with a clatter in a corner of the room.
, and it was only then that he realized that the first round of arrows going off wasn't because of him—it was because of
Tony beams.  Steve isn’t mad at him.  The moment is ruined, though, when Howard narrows his eyes, looking Steve up and down.  “Interesting,” he muses.  “How is it that a man of such little means or purpose owns any sort of refined clothing?”
Tony picked off the corn and dropped it onto a napkin.  "Sorry," he said, though he was still barely paying attention.  He just couldn't stop thinking about Steve. "Go where again?"
Jessica went to start rummaging through the cabinets—this looked like it had once been an office, rather than a classroom.  "He looks better this way," she said coldly.
He could hear Tony rummaging around in the pack, and then the next thing he knew, his shirt was being pushed up, and Tony was carefully wiping away the blood with shaking hands.  "No," came the quiet reply.  "I told you my reactor was fine.  The truth is, Steve, you can only keep a failing heart beating for so long."
"...And finally, summer vacation is coming up and I'll be home soon, which means you're going to meet my parents," continued the voicelog.  "Mom is great. Dad is - just be careful around him, okay? He doesn't have patience for a lot of things and he expects me to take over the company someday.  If he catches you reading fiction he'll flip out. He shouldn't be around much, but when he is, stay out of his hair and you'll hopefully be fine.
Steve continued to growl, and Tony frowned, looking behind him.  There wasn’t much to see—just a couple of trees and rocks.  “Do you see something?” he asked, turning back to him.  “Because I don’t—”
Gratefully, Steve accepted the mug and held it to his lips, starting to gulp the coffee down.  It was as bitter as he remembered, but somehow it was also amazing. Halfway through his mug, he lowered it back down, blinking slowly as he tried to remember what
"Oh, my God," Jessica said as she stepped into the room, Steve and Stark following after her.  "That's Burnside."
—to go back to our old, magical-artifact-searching ways.  The problem is, this time the Nazis are also in on it, and if they beat us to it terrible things will happen.  Probably."
," Jarvis said immediately as he entered.  "I don't care if your heart is fine.  You were bloody shot and you're in no damn condition to go anywhere."
Tony's lips twisted upward.  "That's right.  All that action, all that danger… it was all for my own benefit.  Sure, entertaining the nation was a nice side effect, but… Jesus, Steve.  I was so selfish."
here.  So much food.  "Oh, my God," he breathed, glancing back at Ty, who was looking at him with one eyebrow raised.  "Do you see this?"
Along the same note, while Tony wasn't sure exactly which benefits had been provided to soldiers back then, there were probably at least a few.  And with Steve's health problems, to put it lightly, maybe he'd have a chance to get them looked at.
Taking a deep breath, he starts down the hall, cursing loudly as previously dry parts of him are now soaking wet.  This is awful, really awful.  But he’s going to free Steve, and it’s going to be worth it, and everything will be alright.
It was an empty patient room, from the looks of it.  It also had a window with the curtains open, and Steve blinked at the sudden light as he limped inside and took a seat on the bed.  "Thanks," he said, though he wasn't quite sure what their situation was yet.  Was she here to help them?  Or were they now her prisoners?
Now he’s in the last room before the hallway ends, tearing through the drawers again—and that’s when he sees it.  A floating drawer with a gun inside.  He lunges toward it, picking it up and inspecting it—a revolver, and yes, it’s loaded.
“You shoot its big ugly face from the hidey hole,” Rogers clarified.  Tony wondered if he was smiling right now.  Too bad it was dark.  “Okay.  Let’s go.”
"I'm going to try and divert at least one of them," Cap said.  His shield wasn't out, instead still attached to his back, and Tony realized it was meant to be a target—assuming the Japanese had heard of Captain America, there was no way they would be able to resist trying to take him down.
So they pushed.  As it turned out, someone had sliced the rock into two, and pushing the front half away revealed a hole in the back half, which led… down.  It was dark enough that he couldn’t tell how deep it went—for all he knew, it was either three feet deep or three miles—but he was unfazed.  After another moment of peering into it, Tony brought out a length of rope from his pack, tossing one end down before offering the other end to Rogers.  “You strong enough to support my weight on this?”
"I'll miss this place," Stark said, his voice almost fond as he looked around the little cabin.  The sun was rising, the… injured people had dispersed, and it was about time to leave.  "We may not have running water again for some time."
No one knows this yet, but the drive is a backup he created shortly after being injected with Extremis.  When he loses everything, he’ll be able to reboot with this.  The good news?  It has nothing about the superhuman civil war or registration, and therefore nothing Osborn can use.  The bad news?  It has nothing about the superhuman civil war or registration.
“Yeah,” Tony replies absently.  Changing the world is something he wants to do, and yet he gets the idea that his vision is somewhat different from Sunset’s.  Beautiful, smart Sunset, who wants to marry him because his father owns Stark Industries.  He remembers telling his father once he was hoping to meet someone he could talk to, someone whose company he enjoyed.  Someone who could look at him and have no expectations based on his name or his family.
He opened his eyes, but of course he was still blind as a bat in the dark room, so he fumbled around until he got his hand on what he hoped was Steve’s nipple and pinched it. However, since Steve had a chemically-engineered tolerance for pain, he didn’t make a sound, and Tony wasn’t sure what he had grabbed.
“Duly noted, sir,” JARVIS answered and then, because JARVIS was a real bro, “You may go ahead, Captain Rogers.”
“Sure. I’m up for anything. That’s actually the title of the piece Oprah Magazine did on me in ‘08: ‘Tony Stark: Up for Anything’. I’ll email it to you.”
Tony braced himself. For what, he wasn’t entirely sure. A gentle let down was the most obvious hypothesis, though an awkward conversation about feelings was just as possible and equally dreadful. Least likely was the probability of Steve getting angry with him, but it still had to be taken into consideration. After all, Tony had been the one pushing barriers and obstacles in front of their relationship, fucking up at every single opportunity and generally reminding Steve that he was not boyfriend material. And here he was, blurting out love declarations in the middle of sex like a goddamn teenager having his dick wet for the first time.
Immediately, he started pumping his hips and guided Steve’s ass upward with his hands. Because Tony might not be able to do anything to prevent the hyper stimulation that came with being an omega, but he could damn well make sure that Steve enjoyed this as much as possible.
“Sure,” Steve chimed, bringing Tony’s usual inner rambling and slightly less usual grinding of the hips to a halt.
And naturally, he had offered to let Steve take him in return, several times, had told him that with the modern wonders of birth control, Steve could take him any way he wanted. But Steve had frowned, as if Tony had offered him a live grenade instead of his ass:
Long story short, Tony had zero qualm about humping his way to orgasm tonight. Well, this morning. What time was it? Probably too late (early?) for Steve to be interested in one of their round of athletic sex. Well… athletic for Steve, since he was often the one doing the grunt work while Tony’s role was mostly to provide enthusiastic encouragement and a healthy amount of slick so that his dick could find its way into Steve’s ass as smoothly as possible. It was sure hard to be a rich, privileged omega with an inhumanly sexy boyfriend who insisted on getting fucked into the nearest surface at least four times a week. Honestly, Tony didn’t know how he got himself out of bed in the morning.
“First of all,” Tony spat out soft tendrils of the carpet which clung to his tongue. “First of all, I thought you would pick them up on your way to bed. Second of all,” and here, he gave up trying to free himself and simply got on his elbows and started crawling forward, “that was all entirely premeditated and I am now in the perfect position to go to bed with a minimum amount of noise, thus leaving your beauty rest undisturbed. Listen,” and he kept crawling, rubbing his stomach on the carpet for emphasis, “not a whisper. I am a goddamn genius.”
“Hmm,” Steve hummed and his fingers carded through Tony’s hair, pressing down with just the slightest pressure. Tony gave himself a two-minute window to make him lose control and fuck Tony’s mouth like he was in rut, because he was in his forties and his cardiologist had told him to keep challenging himself. Of course, Dr. Kowalski probably meant more like running a marathon or taking up Pilates, but surely fucking all the self-control out of Captain America counted as healthy exercise.
At the time, Steve had given him the same exasperated look he always had when Tony opened his mouth for anything that wasn’t Avengers-related. And often for things that were Avengers-related. It wasn’t until later, when Tony had been shoved against the bar, riding Steve’s clothed thigh like a pony while Steve whispered how he wanted Tony to get inside him and fuck him, that he had realized how monumentally off the bat he had been.
Because Steve was no blushing maiden, not when it came down to sex. He knew what he was doing and he did it well. Apparently, he took that go-big-or-go-home-except-you-can’t-because-giving-up-is-not-an-option mentality that he had on the battlefield and brought it with him inside the bedroom. Which was more than fine with Tony. Really, among all the drugs he had done throughout his life as eccentric millionaire playboy, he had never experienced anything more intoxicating than having his nose full of alpha scent while Steve spread his thighs under him, working himself on Tony’s dripping cock, shivering and trembling and biting his lips red, not commanding, not ordering, not demanding, but simply giving himself openly as he looked up at Tony with hooded eyes. Because when you were born an omega, you knew you were at the bottom of the pyramid, and you knew that no matter your gender or status or wealth, you would always be the one getting taken, not the one taking. So to have Steve Rogers, of all people, giving himself to Tony, of all people, letting Tony get inside him and take and take and take, take his pleasure, take his time, take his orgasms, take his sighs and moans and groans and swallow them inside his mouth, it was the best feeling in the world.
Steve huffed but obediently started unbuckling Tony’s pants with one hand, while the other was shoving the thin sheets that had been separating them aside.
Tony kissed and sucked his way down Steve’s body and just as he reached his neglected cock, he shot back up again, wrenching a frustrated moan out of the blonde.
Steve’s chest rumbled with a silent laugh, and he cradled Tony’s face between his hands, bringing him up into a kiss as his hips kept undulating on Tony’ softening erection. When he spoke, his voice was low and husky, sending a fresh wave of shivers down Tony’s spine:
“Just getting you started,” and really, Steve’s voice had absolutely no business being this composed, not when Tony had to keep rubbing his chest on the sheets just to remind himself that he didn’t have an arc reactor anymore, and that his heart was not about to fail him. “Is that okay?”
When Tony bottomed out, he didn’t know which one of them groaned like a wild animal. Probably both of them.
Steve let out a little puff of embarrassed laughter, like he used to the first few times JARVIS had chimed in while they were doing the horizontal tango. Well, more like vertical, if Tony’s coming in his pants while pinned between the bar and Steve was taken into account. But then that would just make it regular tango, wouldn’t it?
Tony, why didn’t you call me? Or have JARVIS send for me? I’m ten floors up, I could have come down and helped you.”
And here Tony squirmed, and frowned down in the general direction of his cock – for fuck’s sake, he really needed to ask JARVIS to switch on the lights – and winced because even though the sensation of his own hand was pretty fucking good, something was definitely wrong. He clenched his ass reflexively, waiting for the usual trickle of slick to run down the back of his thighs but…
Tony stumbled into the room, swearing under his breath at the stray clothes that had wrapped themselves around his feet, nearly sending him sprawling on the floor, and which refused to untangle from his ankles and the sole of his shoes.
outside of Steve. At this point, it was useless to pretend that his sexual record with Rogers was anything other than embarrassing, and what the fuck Steve was getting out of this whole relationship was still a mystery to Tony. Even if it was true that most alphas didn’t usually go around getting hot around the ears at the idea of being fucked by an omega, Tony didn’t doubt that Steve could have his pick of any number of omegas willing to switch it up in the bedroom. With his abs, and his face, and his body, and his whole personality, it was still a wonder why he bothered with Tony at all.
It took all of Tony’s efforts – and a little help from Steve – to hoist himself up on his hands, one on each of Steve’s (warm, always so goddamn warm) shoulders.
“I thought you didn’t want to talk about this,” he shot back, and Tony could hear him trying to compose himself, gripping Tony’s biceps to refrain the full-body shudders that kept running through him. Deciding that was just unacceptable, Tony started pushing inside for real, and they both groaned loudly when the head of his dick breached him. He stopped right then, and clutched fingers around the curve of Steve’s ass, which was getting slippery with sweat and Tony’s own slick.
Tony thought later on, as he was bobbing his head up and down, his throat relaxing and his fingers curling at just the right angle to make Steve’s hips jerk upward. Because Steve was a traditionalist and it would complement his skin tone quite well. It didn’t matter whether Steve didn’t want to get inside him, to knot him, to bond with him. Tony knew himself well enough to know he wasn’t the bonding type. Too much pressure, too much commitment, too much risk for a lifetime of heartbreak.
But Steve had simply frowned some more and shaken his head. Which Tony understood, of course. Back before the sexual revolution of the 60s and 70s, penetrative sex with an alpha was a serious matter. Accidents happened and popping a knot – or clamping down on a partner for the alpha ladies – without meaning to was as life-altering as a pregnancy. Bond-breaking wasn’t allowed back then, and even today it was still far trickier than a divorce which could be up and done with by the simple stroke of a pen. So, Tony got it. Steve had cold feet about getting inside him, which was understandable from someone who had grown up knowing that penetrating a partner meant possibly knotting them and being bonded for life. Message received. Loud and clear. No problemo.
He did that little trick three more times before Steve realized that he wasn’t getting anywhere until he got an answer.
Tony thought as he panted into the pillow, gorging himself on Steve’s clean scent – green apples and fresh snow, memories of mulled wine and white furs in front of roaring fireplaces and Christmases in Switzerland flashing behind his eyelids – as he was being rocked back and forth by Steve’s thrusts against his ass, the searing tip of his cock throbbing every time it caught on his hole on its way down, and then back up again.
“I really have to do everything myself around here,” he mumbled as he pried one of his hands away from where it had been clenching Steve’s shoulder and got it around his cock, pushing his briefs out of the way. The feeling of his hot palm, warmed by the prolonged contact with Steve’s own overheated skin, against his dick was enough to wrench another moan out of him, and he was suddenly jerking off hard and fast, unable to stop himself and get on with the rest of his plan – which had been to undress Steve, flip him on his stomach and give him the ride of his life.
“I’m dry. I’m actually dry,” Tony’s own voice sounded incredulous. “How the fuck am I dry right now? I spent all night embarrassingly wet just thinking about you, upstairs and naked in bed.”
“I’m not going to get inside,” Steve finally said, and it took Tony a few seconds for his thoughts to gather and register was he was saying. “I’m just going to try and…” The slow drag of his dick up and down the cleft of Tony’s ass felt like a sucker punch, like every single one of his nerve endings was on fire under his skin, like being zapped after touching the wrong wires in his suit, “get things going for you. Alright?”
. But, you know, why are we still together when I obviously keep fucking up emotionally and disappointing you sexually?” He struggled to keep his voice light and careless.
“Now, see, why would you do something like that? Here I am, trying to show you a good time and you keep making me jump the gun. I’m starting to think maybe you don’t really like sleeping with me, seeing how fast you want me to be done.”
Tony sucked in a breath of air and blinked in the dark. Was it okay? Was it okay for Steve Rogers, the man Tony had been steadily falling in love with for the past few months while desperately trying to ignore it before it was too late and he screwed everything up like he always did, to fuck him? Was it okay for the sexiest, kindest, most adorable, most gorgeous alpha, the one who had spread his legs for Tony countless times, who had sucked him and rimmed him and jerked him for hours, to get inside him?
Steve obviously didn’t share his concern for dignity and was just plain moaning under him, squeezing his inner muscles and making Tony hiss in the process.
Tony snorted, which was his usual reaction to Steve being his adorable, naïve self. That and a good eye roll.
“Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes.” Then, when he got his breathing under control, he realized how desperate and pathetic he sounded. “I mean, yes,” he coughed, hoping that Steve would just get on with it so he would have an excuse for his inane rambling.
Steve’s voice sounded unfocused and even a little pained from where he had been trying to wiggle his way onto Tony’s cock, rocking down in tiny little movements. Tony hardened his grip on the curve of his ass in response, not letting him set the rhythm just yet. He knew that Steve wouldn’t break out of his grip right now, not until Tony got inside him and got his angle just right.
Tony scrambled across the sheets, fumbling in the dark until he found his way in his third favorite place in the world: between Steve’s legs (his second favorite place being his lab, and his first being between Steve’s legs on the couch in his lab). He grabbed Steve’s bent knees with his palms and slowly slid down his hands underneath his thighs, until he reached that soft patch of skin where his legs met his ass. Even in pitch blackness, Tony knew exactly what he was looking at. He had spent so long tracing Steve’s skin with his fingertips that even with his eyes closed he could picture all that expense of smooth golden skin perfectly. He pressed forward until the tip of his cock met Steve’s entrance, and right on cue Steve’s breathing started getting fast and shallow, because nothing got him more hot and bothered than this.
“I am so very honored to be included, sir,” came JARVIS’ dry reply, and now that Tony was thinking about it, he wondered if Steve and his AI were spending too much time together. They were starting to sound awfully similar.
Maybe, just maybe, Tony was trying to distract Steve from how seriously he meant these questions by teasing him, pressing up snuggly against him to hear his breath catch underneath him, and pulling out immediately, never going inside.
Seconds passed with nothing but silence, a silence so heavy that none of them dared breathe or move, as if the slightest sound could somewhat detonate the grenade that Tony had carelessly thrown between them. When seconds turned into minutes, Tony realized that he didn’t share Steve’s inhumane ability to hold his breath and the sound of his own shaky inhale was loud as a gunshot in the stifling darkness of the bedroom. Ultimately, Steve unclasped each of his fingers from Tony’s hips, so slowly and carefully that he might as well have been disarming a bomb, and he slowly rolled on his back next to Tony, who was calculating how fast he could asphyxiate himself with a pillow before Steve tried to stop him. At least he would die surrounded by the scent of fresh snow and green apples, he thought, before realizing that he had just reached a new level of pathetic, which was certainly a surprise considering the words that had escaped his mouth just moments ago. But, again, that was Tony Stark for you, forever breaking boundaries in science, wealth and mortifying levels of embarrassment.
Steve felt a little bad, but not bad enough to regret following after Ty.  He eventually went out to get dinner, then came back to his room, lying back down on the bed and wondering if he could just pass out.  This dream had been dragging on for so long. When was it going to end?
"Mmm," Stark replied, but otherwise said nothing as he lit one candle and went to the shelf of food.
Tony nodded weakly—it wasn’t like he was in any condition to run off right now, anyway.  Once Rogers disappeared, Tony took the opportunity to unplug the cables from his chest plate, stuffing them back into their compartments.  He managed to finish just as Rogers came back, holding the flashlight in one hand.  Tony groaned, turning his face away from the glare, only to be confronted with the sabretooth’s body.  Jesus.  “…Is it dead?” he asked.
Tony knew that something was off as soon as he sat up in bed.  The ceiling had the same stain it always did, and the foot supports he'd made for Steve were sitting on the nightstand as usual, ready to be put on for the day.  He spared a grateful thought for the fact that Steve was still wearing them and had even thanked Tony for it, even though really, Tony had mostly made them for himself so that walking wouldn't be so painful when he was in this body.  But soon enough, his mind turned to the other things in the room - or rather, the lack thereof. There hadn't been much to begin with, but there was certainly a difference between "not much" and "nearly nothing", and right now there was nearly nothing.  Most of the furniture he was used to was gone, and there were some open boxes sitting at the other end of the room.
Mindful of the fact that he wasn't going to find out unless they actually rescued Cap, Tony went back to the doors, placing a hand over the lever that would lower them.  "J, get low enough for Cap to board," he called.  "But keep moving, and keep that other plane on their toes.  I'm gonna try and pull Cap in."
"Don't," Steve said, his throat going dry.  It was his fault.  He'd been wrong, and Tony had almost paid for it with his life.  "I thought… I knew they were dangerous, but—"
understand, but this is going to have to be enough.  All I really know was that hearing your voice while you were on that plane, speaking to me, and then nothing… I thought that a part of me had died with you.  I realized the mistake I'd made."
“No,” murmurs Steve, and he reaches forward, taking Tony’s hand in his own.  “I was remembering the part where you gave me a home.”
Tony hmphs, adjusting himself so that he’s pressing lightly against Steve’s entrance and looking smug as Steve swallows.  “No,” he admits.  “You ready?”
Steve turns away from a painting on the wall to look, taking the tux from him after a moment and spending some time just running his fingers along the fabric.  “You sure about this?  This feels expensive.”
Cap shook his head slightly, surprising Tony.  "The artifact," he said.  "There are three pieces, right?  We have two.  It makes sense if he has the last one."
- Tony pulled out the beige-colored shirt and pants hiding under the trench coat and held them up to himself.  The tailoring job was crude, but they fit Steve's slight frame.
Steve blinks, and then he smiles, and it’s like the sun coming out from behind the clouds.  “Come here,” he says, offering his hand, and Tony reaches out to take it—his skin is rough but warm.  “Now close your eyes.”  Tony quirks an eyebrow up at him in response, but Steve just chuckles, squeezing his hand.  “Go on, close them.”
Dad wasn't home today, he knew.  So whatever fight Steve and him had gotten into… Tony could avoid the fallout for now.  And if he wanted to do something
“You idiot,” Steve tells him, even as he holds him close, pressing kisses against every inch of his face that he can reach, fingers curling into his hair.  “You damned
“Oh,” Steve replies, and before Tony knows it, he’s being hugged tight.  After a moment of consideration, Tony hugs Steve back, breathing in deep and holding on like his life depends on it.  God, he’s missed this sort of closeness.  “I’m sorry too,” Steve tells him, his voice muffled against Tony’s shoulder.  “It’s easy not to take any blame when I’m the one who died.  But I messed up.  It didn’t have to be like this.”  He sighs, going quiet for a second.  “I hope you find what you’re looking for.  And then you can come back, right?”
"Under no circumstance is that a good idea," Cap said sharply.  Tony blinked.  "You're hurt, in case you've forgotten again.  We need to support each other, not go our separate ways."
Tony wasn't heartless.  The betrayal had hurt, but a part of him still loved Steve.  Would always love Steve.  And if Steve needed his help to get the plane—and
Stark ushered Steve back into the cabin after that, muttering something about how all that noise would have drawn "the others" and promising to explain everything when they were settled in.  Once the cabin was locked up and the black curtains were back in place, Stark lit a few candles and gave Steve a fresh set of clothes to change into before taking the soiled ones to the sink.  To Steve's surprise, he started to wash them in silence, all without a single joke or comment to be heard.  Since when did Tony Stark need to do his own laundry?  "Let me help," he offered, but Stark just waved him off, telling him to unpack the bag he'd brought back with him.
“Calm down?” Steve repeats, and he’s really not sounding nearly as awed as Tony had hoped, his heart rate jumping still higher.  “
"I mean I'm not the son you raised," Steve replied as he took a step forward.  He meant it in more ways than one, but right now only one of those ways needed to be shared right now.  "How can you have raised me, when you spend our time together yelling at me? Is that what you call raising?"
“You, obviously.”  Tony steps toward him, wrapping his arms around his shoulders.  “Did you know you’re really hot when you’re concentrating?  Or hell, when you’re doing anything?”
It was strange, Steve thought, where their relationship was right now.  Things between them had been so different not that long ago—well, not that long ago for him, anyway.  And then Steve had been so
“Yeah.”  Steve reluctantly removes his hand from Tony’s shoulder, offering him a smile in return.  “Later, Tony.”
They left the room—there wasn't a hoard of biters waiting outside this time, so it was much easier—and headed back to the window, clear now of smoke.  Steve took care of the few biters milling about before kneeling by the window, holding up his shield.  Jessica went through, followed by Stark.  Steve was last, coming out in time to hear fabric tearing and Stark cursing.  "What happened?" he asked as he landed.
,” Tony tells him, even though he’s not and hasn’t been since the day Steve died on those courthouse steps.  But Rhodey has duties, important duties that Tony
“Come back to New York with me?” Steve asks when they’re done, and as the light of dawn makes his eyes shine a brilliant blue and throws into relief nearly fifty years’ worth of frown lines and smile wrinkles, Tony thinks he’s never been more beautiful.
Tony scowled at the floor, hand reaching up to clutch at his torso.  Just how bad were his ribs?  “I was cut,” he insisted.  “Superficially.  Go away.”
Steve stepped toward it, taking in a deep breath.  It smelled—good.  Not like dying and dead people, which was something—as terrible as it was to admit—that he'd started to get used to.  "It's nice," he said intelligently.
What on earth…?  Frowning, Steve got up, making his way to the curtains and pulling them aside, inhaling sharply as he looked past them.  The sun had long since set, but he could still make out several shapes shuffling about in the snow—and now that he was no longer listening to Stark talk, he thought he could hear… moaning.  A lot of moaning.
Rogers frowned down at his torso, looking as though he’d be able to see them through Tony’s skin if he just stared hard enough.  Maybe he could.  Did he have x-ray vision?  No, that was Superman.  Rogers was just Captain America.  “I can’t tell,” Rogers said at last, and Tony had to try not to laugh, because that would be completely inappropriate and out of nowhere at the current moment.  “But if they are, I don’t think there’s anything I can do.”
His gaze lingered on that last item.  His class had recently started translating the French version of some old comics from the 1930s, nothing new there.  But what was up with those double exclamation points? Hell, what was up with all of this, period?
.  He'd ultimately died for his country.  What right did Tony have, sitting here in a comfortable chair and in no mortal danger, to not do something as simple as - as checking his files?
“Shush,” Tony says as he places his ear against the door, then nods and pushes it open, looking around.  “Coast is clear.  We should be safe for a while.”
"Closer, darling," Tony said softly, and Steve couldn't help but comply, drawing nearer to him as though Tony were a magnet.  "There are some things I should tell you."
A lifetime later, the ship arrives at New York, and Tony gazes up at the Statue of Liberty as it passes by, heedless of the rain washing over him.  She’s a beautiful piece of art; she really is, and for a moment, Tony lets his eyes shut and thinks of strong hands covered with charcoal—and then he thinks of golden hair and sky-blue eyes, and it’s only when he feels hard metal pressing into his stomach does he realize that he’s bent over the rail, tears streaking down his face as he voids what little substance there is in his stomach into the waters below.
He received an eyeroll in return, though thankfully, Steve didn’t seem interested in chiding him further, presumably because he was now a sabretooth and therefore couldn’t chide anyone.  Instead, he put one massive paw against one of the boxes of food and pulled it toward him.  Then he drew a circle around it before pointing to himself and drawing a much bigger circle around his body.
Jarvis headed for the door, apparently deciding this conversation was over.  "I'll be landing the airship now," he told them.  "Start preparing to disembark."  Then he left, Pepper and Rhodey following after him.
"So," Steve said softly once they'd been walking for about fifteen minutes.  The Navy Yard was over ten miles away, so they had a trek ahead of them.  "What's this Tveria that Natasha was going on about?"
"Everyone," Steve said, and it slipped out before he realized the word was there.  But she laughed, her pretty mouth drawing up into a bright smile.
"No-" The word was choked off, sticking in Tony's throat. He twisted, trying to bring his head around, trying to get an arm loose, but Bruce was a dead weight on his back, pinning him in place.  "Don't-"
“I also get the feeling that I haven’t got your full attention right now,” Obie said, blotting at the spilled coffee with a napkin.
“If that’s how you want things, fine,” Stark said, his tone losing its playful edge. “I asked for you as you are the only one I could trust. I heard that you gave up being in the army—which baffled me to no end—and ended up at Quantico. But the bureau does have resources I don’t. I trust Fury and his merry group of bureaucratic agents less than I trust a scorpion in my hand.
“Can we move this to the bedroom?” Tony asks as Steve mouths another kiss on Tony’s jawline, running his lips on stubble.
He heard the beep of the computer and the sirens came in quick succession. Agents swarmed the lobby, all guns pointing at him, and a few more with rifles appeared from the second floor terrace.
Tony has kissed a few more others than Steve. More than he cares to count or remember. But Steve kisses will always rank the best.
She opened the door of her SUV and indicated he go in. “I’m here to take you to the bureau.” The distaste of being made Steve’s chauffeur for the day showed on her face. She clearly had better things to do.
“I’m 21 now, physically, and apparently, back to my omega status.” Tony throws his head back and had to laugh at that.
Tony closes his eyes and prays to every god and deity that would listen his fervent thanks for this man in his life.
Jan looked at the clock. 8:50 am. He had 10 minutes to get to work on his first day on the job as a Special Agent for the National Security Branch of the FBI.
Bruce sighs, leans his head on the door, and pleads, “I’m sorry, Tony, but I’m your friend, you need to tell me what’s the matter. We’re worried.”
“Fuck you, Banner! Leave me the fuck alone!” Tony screams back. He thumps his head against the door and contemplates the likelihood of him drowning in the small sink.
But Captain Thick Brick didn’t take the hints and Tony accepted to himself that he wasn’t interested. So he befriended him, hanging out, having Steve draw in the couch while he worked on something in the lab.
He inclined his head towards Jan. “Go to your office now; it’s safer than being here until I get to the bottom of this.”
Steve places Tony gently on the bed before bending down and bestowing more of the soft kisses that turned deeper, more desperate. Steve’s tongue rolls against his, demanding submission and Tony can only take it, pressing himself against the pillow. Tony runs his hands on Steve’s back, the muscles flexing under his touch, before landing on Steve’s perfect ass.
He remembers what happened at Johannesburg. With the Hulk and the Hulkbuster. And millions of dollars worth of destruction. And lives taken and hurt.
Fury could not understand how this man came from legally making billions to illegally making billions. Nothing about this made sense. Why give up now? Who’s on his tail that he would willingly give himself up to the government?
“Big, imposing, but utilitarian? Yes, actually. Figures he would want to be an Agent after everything. Must be nice for you, though, to be back in the country.”
“Howard had an omega son. He turned him into a beta—the best they could do at that time. He...he stitched me up, put an implant in me so I emitted beta pheromones...he took away my—my parts—“ Tony can no longer continue and as he is about to sink to the floor again in tears, Bruce catches him, holds him tight and he can feel the sobs wracking Bruce’s body as well as his own.
When Tony wakes up, all he can feel is pain. The only thing that really doesn’t hurt are his eyelids—his skin feels stretched and taut, his muscles sore, and his head aching like someone hit him in the head.
It took Dum-E wheeling along with a fire extinguisher and dousing the both of them before Steve would let Tony go, and Tony took the chance to run up to the elevator and then barricade himself in his bedroom in the penthouse.
“Clothes off,” Tony orders hoarsely and Steve complies, stripping off with military efficiency while Tony flings his own clothes everywhere.
“No,” Steve admonishes gently and tightens his grip on the base of Tony’s cock, staving off the impending orgasm. “You’re still quite tight.” He drizzles more lube on his fingers and a third one joins in.
He knew that Stark was the heir to a weapons manufacturing company which made ammo and guns for the military. Then ten years ago, just as he was starting to turn around the company and making
“Of course, Alpha,” he says cheekily, and takes pleasure at the flash of red in Steve’s eyes before the other man takes a deep breath to calm himself down.
“Nuh uh,” Tony disagrees, looking up at him. There is something in his eyes, a slight vulnerability that Steve realises only he gets to see, in rare moments like this. When he isn’t Iron Man, or Tony Stark, but just Tony, Steve’s husband. “I still think that I must have been good in a former life to have you in this.”
“Fine, you know what’s wrong?” Tony seethes, his knuckles white with how hard he was clenching his fists. “Howard. He could not accept an omega son, he wanted an Alpha, but even a beta would do. Have you heard of Project Oyster?”
There is nothing more heard that gasps and groans, slick flesh slapping against each other in a fierce tempo as old as mankind.
“I’m sorry, sir,” JARVIS intones. “You did not specify such an order. You told me to lock the access of the elevator but the Captain used the fire exits.”
“Tony! Let us in! What’s wrong?” Bruce yells from the other side of the bathroom door, jiggling the knob.
“One thing at a time, baby doll,” he says soothingly. “Coffee can wait, as long as I do get one.” His voices turns awestruck again. “And you, you’re my scent-mate.” The happiness of him is coming in waves. He looks like he dearly wanted to scent Tony again but desists.
