“I really hate those assholes,” Bucky complains. “They have plenty to say about Stark’s drinking, too, like it’s any of their business. You gonna see him again?”
Bruce nods and heads out to the living room.  Steve’s sitting on the couch, flipping through a Time Magazine from the late 90s.
“Go ahead,” Steve says, gesturing.  “Merry Christmas.”  It’s late July, but he knows they’re going to appreciate what’s inside just the same.
The nutrition doesn’t take long, and James is drowsy when it’s over. His body is back to healing mode again, and he’s nodding off when Bruce leaves. He’s not too far gone to speak up, though.
“Didn’t buy the place,” Tony assures him.  “But I did call the owner.  Offered to start a tab for the Avengers.  If you’re ever down there, the soda machine really is truly unlimited now.  Grab as many Mega-Gulps as you want.”
“You said you wanted updates if I heard from anyone,” Tony answers quietly.  “Bruce just texted.  Wanted a place to stay in Switzerland.  That’s all.”
“It’s hard to explain,” Steve says.  “You’re just special.  From the first time I met you, I could tell.  You’re someone so far ahead of the rest of us we will never catch up.  You’re someone who can change the world.  Do you understand what an amazing thing that is?”
There’s really not much he wants to do less, but if he wants to prove to the coaches that he’s got his shit together, that’s what this is going to take.
Bruce gets an immediate visual of Tony’s dramatic retelling of how the Winter Soldier ripped a steering wheel right out of a moving vehicle and decides to pass.
“Ask Sam when he comes running in here at dawn and I’m only three-fourths of the way finished with his wings.”
Tony nods.  “I know I’m not a super soldier or a Russian spy, but I have managed to keep myself mostly in one piece all these years. Give me
Bruce nods and switches places with Clint.  Clint goes for the BannerBars (which Bruce is positive he’d named StarkBars) first.
“It is,” Tony sighs. “And until Bruce gets back I’m his R&D Department.” Tony’s phone dings. “That’s him now. Don’t keep him waiting.”
Natasha pours out a mug of steaming coffee and brings it over to Tony. She hip checks Sam as she walks past him,
“Steve.  It’s not going to happen, okay?” Tony asks.  He’s upset.  “You’re asking for the impossible.  No one in the history of ever has looked at me and looked at you and found us equal.  In anything.”
“They loved spending time with me, I think.  They were proud of everything I did, even if it was macaroni art or an A on a book report about turtles.  They liked the little things.  I didn’t have to do something impressive to impress them.”
Tony stares after Howard’s back as his father marches off. He knows Howard’s upset. Tony’s upset. But it’s the last straw in a series of last straws. He’s not waiting to make his announcement. He’s not wasting one more second of his life on the opinions of a man who does. not. care.
The Avengers are in a fight that they just might lose. Hulk gets drawn away early, out of the fray, and Steve’s fighting off more bad guys than he can count. More than he can take on alone, that’s for sure.
Bruce wishes he had a whiteboard, or Tony’s holoboard, or even post-it notes and a pen. This would be so much easier if he had something to do with his hands other than wave them around like a lunatic.
“There’s the inspiring Captain America speech I’ve been waiting for,” Tony teases gently.  He puts a hand on the small of Steve’s back to nudge him toward the lab door.  “Seriously, Steve.  Everything is gonna be fine. That was scary, sure.  And as Barton so helpfully pointed out, there’s a shit ton of complications that come along with it. Doesn’t matter.”
“You shouldn’t have to,” Steve says.  “I know I won’t be around every time, but at least for this evening let me stick around.  We’ll order pizza or stir fry or something.”
“Um... yes?” Sam asks.  “Are you serious?  I can’t tell.  Is this some kind of billionaire version of punked?”  He glances around the room as if looking for a camera crew.
“I’ve got answers,” Tony says blankly. “You want to dig through all the answers JARVIS found for me?”
“I swear I didn’t,” Bruce says. “I’m not surprised; I just didn’t expect it. I wasn’t trying to trap you or withhold information. I wouldn’t do that.”
On the rare occasion Steve sees Tony out of his Iron Man gear, he’s wearing long sleeves, even at the height of summer.  Any time Tony’s sleeves shift, Steve gets a peek at the bruised skin beneath.  Sometimes freshly dark and sometimes pale green and faded, but always there.
Who even knows at this point if Bucky and James are the same person? Bruce can’t say with any certainty.
Tony goes still and quiet, the way he does whenever Steve seems like he might be growing annoyed. Like Tony’s trying to make himself a less irritating target.
He turns slowly, looks at the crates and knows what they represent and well-- it turns out he doesn’t want them.  Not now.  Maybe never.
Steve pauses with his hand to the door. There’s a doorbell. He could ring it. But doorbells can be startling and he doesn’t want to startle Tony. He just... just wants to talk.
“Hope you weren’t looking forward to anything fancy,” Tony says.  “We needed comfort food, and they make hamburgers here with the fries under the bun and eggs on top.  It doesn’t get more comforting than that.”
Tony rolls to a stop.  They’ve reached within a block of their destination and he can’t stay in the car a second longer.  He’s not entirely sure he’s in a legal parking zone.  Doesn’t matter.  JARVIS’ll take care of it.
The making out is heated and prolonged.  They grope each other desperately, tugging at clothes and pushing hands up under shirts for more access to touch.  It is absolutely the best way to spend a Saturday even if some jackass wants Tony dead.
Shayla’s as pretty as Steve expects.  She’s also an accomplished pianist and singer.  If Bucky was describing her Buck would have said something like she had legs that went on for miles and curves like a Coney Island roller coaster.  He was always better than Steve at describing things like that.  He could paint pictures with his words.  Steve can only paint pictures with... pictures... and he hasn’t really had the heart to pick up a sketchpad lately.
“Perfect,” Steve says, as he rubs at the spot with his palm. When he pulls his hand away there’s a dark smudge.
Over the years the quilt (and a bowl of fresh cookies) had come back to Tony a few times when Mrs. Rhodes suspected he needed them and when Rhodey’s mom passed away the year before, the quilt came back to him permanently, without the bowl or cookies.
Tony gives up on office work around 4.  He has no idea what he’s been reading for the last hour, anyway.  Patent paperwork, maybe?  It can matter later.  Right now what matters is all the nervous energy Tony needs to burn before he sees Steve.
Things are so different now. Instead of feeling like he and Bruce are the odd ones out, they fit into the movements of the group like gears inside an intricate clock. Some of the time Steve’s got his arm around Tony, but every half a block or so there’s an effortless switch among the groupings. Bucky will need Steve for something and Natasha will fill in the space Steve left behind. Sam swoops between conversation partners in the same way as his girlfriend, so no one is ever left out. Everyone is engaged. Everything is comfortable.
“You can do this,” Steve says.  “And I’m going to be with you every step of the way.  Rhodey’s gonna fly in tomorrow.  Pepper wants to bring us breakfast.  Bruce may already be upstairs in a lab right now.  You don’t have to handle any of this alone.”
“Yes.  I could have used it,” Tony says.  “To throw at a ramp.  Which is exactly what I did.  Try it.”
tell me I’m not dreaming,” Tony says. “And that you’re telling the truth. And also that I can retell this story to Rhodey word for word.”
Clint nods.  “Sure.  But can we make our sex tape after?  Cause I’ve already got a name and everything.”
“Not an out,” Bruce says.  “It’s hard not to give you accidental orders.  I’m trying to account for that.”

Of course no one listens, and they all come running.  An egg is half dripping from the ceiling and half hovering a few inches above the floor in a small nest made of what looks like spare Iron Man parts.  It’s held in the air by a repulsor that’s firing from underneath.
When they walk into the workshop there can be no doubts left about the validity of the Dum-E drawings.  There are hearts everywhere.  They’d been drawn on every scrap of paper Dum-E could get his claw on.  The floor is littered with them, strewn like flower petals on a honeymoon bed.
“Okay...” Steve begins.  “Here’s something.  My ma was seeing a man before she died.  A real nice guy. I liked him a lot.  He was good to her and he treated her right.  He wanted to get more serious but she wouldn’t commit because she was too set on taking care of me.  Right before she got sick we argued about it.”
Steve’s smile lights up his whole face.  “I know there is.  I just-- I thought you didn’t want that.  Or that it’d be too much trouble.”
“You and Natasha good now?” Steve asks, once he and Tony are in their bedroom, stripping down for a shower.
Clint nods. “It does to me. Four or five people have broken this arm. You’re the first one who didn’t break it on purpose.”
“But not from me,” Steve insists. “I can’t stop you from feeling insecure, sweetheart. I can be more aware of how situations might look, though. And I can make sure I check in more often. How you interpret things... that’s up to you.”
James lifts his hips off the hay slightly and pushes his too-loose jeans down. There’s nothing underneath and Bruce averts his eyes. It isn’t that he has an issue with nudity. God knows he’s over that by now. He’s just repulsed by the knowledge that James’s dignity has been disregarded for so long that he doesn’t blink at stripping in front of a stranger.
The ride up is mundane.  There’s no loud music playing in the elevator, no flashing lights or surprises.  When the elevator stops and a polite voice suggests Steve exit, he does, and he’s in a room he recognizes.  It’s where they found Loki after the battle of New York.  It’s nicer now.  Finished.
There’s an easiness in the way he agrees that’s maybe a good sign, but he also sounds tired. More tired than he’d been the morning before. Panic attacks could do that though, and James had had a significant one the previous night. That could be it.
She flops herself into the rear of the taxi and Bruce laughs as he follows her. They’re an odd pair, sure, but Tony is happy to see Bruce really connect with a person who isn’t him. Bruce needs more of that.
“Heeeeeeey,” Steve says, drawing out the word to shush away that line of thinking.  “You didn’t fuck anything up.  Nothing between us, anyway.  Where’s this coming from?”
“Can’t keep Tony away from bad women,” Pepper rants.  “Can’t keep him away from bad men.  Can’t get him to make them sign the damn non-disclosure ‘greements.”
Bruce notes the signs of alarm James is giving off. His eyes are slightly wide and his muscles are tense. Either because Bruce has seen this a few times now, or because James seems a little less murderous, the Other Guy doesn’t stir.
Steve doesn’t miss the challenge in Tony’s voice.  It’s obvious Tony doesn’t expect he’ll stay.  Won’t want his company.  And why wouldn’t that be his expectation?  If his own father couldn’t bother with him, Steve reasons, why would Tony ever think
Tony rolls his eyes and holds out his hand.  Clint lays the phone down, which is ridiculously considerate.  Tony picks it up and types in his number.  He hands the phone back to Clint, who proceeds to group text the photo of them to a half dozen numbers.  Bucky’s phone vibrates and Tony’s text alert pings.
“And refer to yourself in third person the whole time,” Bucky says, a little less able to keep a smirk off his face.  “She’ll be super impressed.”
Tony's not going to have this conversation while Steve is literally on his knees and Tony’s standing over him.  So he sits.
“It’s not unreasonable,” Steve says.  “And since you deserve all the honesty I’ve got to give-- I’m not really sure I want to work for SHIELD anymore anyway.  I want to be an Avenger.  The SHIELD missions... I could take them or leave them.  Most of the time I’d like to leave them.  And I’ve felt like that for a while now.”
“Nat knows what she’s doing,” Steve says.  “And so does Tony when he’s not handing out his address on National Television.  I think they’ll be fine.”
“USO Tour. Some of those girls would offer just about anything for a couple of minutes of my time. Back in the day, we called what I just gave you a ‘hand job’,” Steve says with a straight face.
“If I was half as good a person as people think I am, I’d probably say yes,” Steve says.  “But if it was me I don’t think I’d want to know.  It’s water under the bridge now.  She’s forgiven you once.  I’m not sure she should have to do it again.  It’s up to you, though.  Whatever you decide, I’ll support you.”
“I’m impressed,” Steve says, inspecting Tony’s work.  “The balance on that’s got to be a real bitch.”
“You’re burning through the IV nutrition faster than before,” Bruce says. “When it’s all used up it puts stress on your system because your body is willing to cannibalize itself to heal you. Steve, I think we’re going to need to finish your visit later. James needs an IV and more rest.”
The stretcher magnetically snaps into place over the med-bed, and Natasha’s got them in the air a few seconds later.
“Wouldn’t need to figure out how they work,” Tony says.  “I had a hand in the original project.  They’re based on my designs.”
It’s either jealousy or protectiveness, and Steve doesn’t know which.  Jealous Steve spends time with Bruce?  Jealous Bruce spends time with Steve?  Worried either of them might hurt the other?  There’s no telling.  He could ask, but he doesn’t want to argue.  Not when Tony’s dropped the polite hostility for the first time in ages.
“The first time we met, you said you found me because you had questions about Steve,” Bruce says. “You wanted information about him you couldn’t find in books. Why?”
“When SI was still all about the weapons, I couldn’t get much past the board that didn’t involve big bangs,” Tony says. “But there has always been something about the Icarus story that really pisses me off, so I worked on wings in my spare time.  Turned all my work over to Rhodey and he took it from there.”
He expects Tony to move briskly toward the waiting car outside, but about halfway through the mass of pushing bodies he stops.  It takes Steve a minute to work out what’s going on, but when Tony reverses and uses his body to make way for a few young, nervous-looking Stark Industries employees, Steve gets it.  They’d gotten caught in the crowd and Tony’s taking the time to walk them to the elevator safely.
“James, you can feel free to check over the scanner parts if you want to see what they look like or smash them with a hammer if you really don’t them in the house. I won’t be mad.  I'm not going to
“What do you think?” Clint says, turning his head first left, then right.  “Which side is better for the cameras?  Got to look nice for my television debut.”
Tony carries their coffee as Steve picks up their snacks and leads Tony out to a screened in back porch.  There’s a well-loved wicker loveseat, straight out of the 80s and Steve sits on one half, leaving room for Tony to join him.  He puts Tony’s plate on the nearest end table.
“Oh god, please let me live," Clint fake pleads.  "Nat will sit by my grave and never let me hear the end of it if you don't.”
Those were Steve’s personal favorites, too.  They cover you in pink glitter glue and smell like sewer.  He was definitely saving his for Clint.  As was Tony, apparently, because by the time they all came back together once the game was over, Clint was pink and stinky from head to toe.
“Did SHIELD finally have enough?” Tony asks, once they’ve been driving for a few minutes.  His head is resting against the window and his eyes are still shut tight.  His words are slurred and sluggish.  “You taking me to Fury’s top secret hidey hole so you can lock me up like the dark family secret?”
“Text that to me!” she begs. “And text it to mom! And to dad! You said you didn’t know him! Why-- how-- what? Wait. Just text it to me. Let me send it to everybody else, Taylor isn’t going to believe this. You are the
His words die off, and Bruce can see that James doesn’t have the vocabulary for whatever it is he wants to express next. James looks at him expectantly, as if Bruce can read minds, and Bruce chews on his bottom lip in thought. He doesn’t want to feed James emotions. If he gets them wrong, James could misidentify them for who knows how long, and Bruce really does not want to be responsible for fucking James up any worse than he is. So instead of giving any definites, he ventures a quiet guess.
Except Steve is an Avenger, and as Tony had requested two years before, Steve had stayed out of it in that moment.  But it has been haunting him every moment since.  He can’t leave this one alone. There’s no way to interfere that won’t piss Tony off and Steve doesn’t care.  He’s protecting him, end of story.   It’s the right thing to do.
“No shit,” James scowls. “It’s something else. It’s...” He trails off with an annoyed huff, like the words have wronged him somehow.
“That’s--” Steve starts.  Then he stops.  His eyes are a little shiny at the edges.  When he speaks, his voice is a lot more conciliatory.  “That’s really good of you.”
“Kind of hard to miss,” Steve says with a grin. A dangerous grin, Tony thinks. A grin Tony wouldn’t mind waking up to. “Here, these are for you.”
“They’re getting by,” Steve says. “It sounds like Nat’s coming home soon. Bruce has been in the tower lab a few times when I’ve dropped by. Clint’s been keeping me entertained. Oh, which reminds me... how much do you know about paintball production? I’ve got a whole list of ideas...”
“If I slip up, it’s because I would accidentally talk to you the way I would talk to my friends.  Just know, if I ever tell you to do something and you don’t want to do it, I give you absolute, irrevocable permission to tell me to fuck off, okay? Like Clint says, it keeps me on my toes.”
It’s probably a sign that something is seriously wrong with Steve that his fantasy life has never been so vivid.  In his daydreams (night dreams, shower dreams, gym dreams) he kisses bruised wrists.  He holds Tony close and tells him he’s beautiful and smart and worth so much more than he knows.   He traces shrapnel scars lightly.  Carefully.  With his tongue.  And he never minds where they lead.
There’s a pause.  If Natasha and Clint are waiting for Steve to remind them that Avengers don’t target civilians they're going to be waiting for a long damn time.
Maybe it isn’t significant, but there’s something about the way James stares down at his hands after their quick conversation that feels promising. Like maybe for the first time in a long time he’s realizing that both hands belong to him.
<3  Sorry the pandemic stole my muse.  I think I'm getting it back though, so subscribe if you want to see the notification for the next chapter!  I really don't think it will take nearly as long this time around!
“We need Tony’s help to do anything more for James,” Bruce says, as he climbs to his feet and moves toward the front of the plane. “He’s stable enough for me to worry about you, finally.”
Tony looks at Steve like Steve’s speaking a different language and Steve can see he’s overwhelmed.  Steve steps slowly around the car and draws Tony against him.  Tony rests there, like he has no intention of pulling away any time soon.
Tony shrugs.  “Not really.  I haven’t been out of here for...” It takes Tony a second to come up with exactly when he’d last left the building which definitely means the answer is Too Long.  “Almost a week?”
...Except he can’t resign.  He’s fought so hard for this company.  So hard to have what should have rightfully been his all along.
“This guy giving you trouble, Dr. Stark?” a young (when did mid-twenties become so young?) man drawls as he walks around the corner of the nearest cubicle.  "He's got a bad reputation around here."
a sentimental longing or wistful affection for the past, typically for a period or place with happy personal associations.
“It’s not,” Tony says.  “It’s potable, though.  Give it a try.  And if it’s not Bruce, what’s up?  Why are you here?”
“Just be yourself,” Steve says, putting a hand to the small of Tony’s back.  “She’s going to think you’re great.”
“Seriously,” Steve tries again, gently.  “I know everyone thinks I’m some big prude, but if you’re enjoying yourself, I’m happy for you.  I want you to be happy.”
Tony agrees wholeheartedly.  They needed to draw attention away from Nanna and Kate, and they did that.  This was never meant to be a shoot out if they could help it so getting a move on before the helicopter blows them up is a really excellent idea.
There are a dozen handguns stored inside and ample ammunition. Tony recognizes all of it. It’s the sort of collection you can’t just buy down at the corner store. More like the nearest Russian armory.
“Shit,” Bruce swears. “That’s important information. Yes, your arm isn’t functional. We had to disconnect the wires to keep you alive. I’m sorry. Tony can fix it though-- either fix the arm that’s on you or make you a new one. Whatever you want.”
There was a time when a comment like that would have gotten Steve’s hackles up because it had taken him a long time to understand that the only way to take Tony was with several hundred grains of salt.  It wasn’t criticism.  It wasn’t mean.  It was an out.  A way to lighten the mood or move the conversation along, if Steve wants.  It seems like a good idea.  The ache in his chest is gone and the sting of loss is manageable.  For the first time in a month and a half, Steve doesn’t feel like he’s completely lost in a dark haze of grief.
Tony and Steve use the service elevator to get to the garage, and take Steve’s bike out through the back way to avoid being seen. The YouTube video has swung public opinion in their favor, and the downside to that is that everyone and their grandma wants a picture of them. Maybe especially the grandmas.
Tony lets that sink in, looks a lot more pleased and then shifts to all fours so he can crawl back up the bed to Steve.
It turns out, Tony doesn’t have the market cornered on jealousy. When Steve accompanies Tony and Bruce to a science talk at one of the nearby universities, he finds out just how miserable it can feel.
“It’s rude, I know,” Tony says loudly.  The crowd quiets to hear him, though he still needs to shout over the stomp of a dozen armed guards running their way.  “Coming in without an invitation.  But well-- I think all pretense of manners gets dropped when someone puts a hit out on you.  Didn’t work, by the way.  Still alive and kicking.”  Tony holds up his hands and gives a jaunty turn, as if to show that so far, no bullets have met their mark.
“I’m glad you think this is funny,” Bruce says, shaky with exasperation and the last tinges of fear. “You could have been killed.”
Tony’s holding a remote control and looking unimpressed.  Bruce walks over to him, takes the remote control, and pats him on the back.
Tony’s scared.  Steve knows this, because Tony can’t keep from fiddling with the worry-ball he’s holding and he keeps having to ask for things to be repeated because his attention is firmly elsewhere
“Naked science is nothing you’d have wanted to see anyway,” Tony says, before taking a swig of his smoothie.  “I was serious about the pale thing.  Banner’s ass is stellar but
Clint gives Bruce a look that manages to say ‘this fucking sucks” very eloquently with only his eyes.
“Just-- just a weird couple of days,” Steve says.  “At the end of one of the worst weeks of my life.”
The first time Tony’d invaded Steve’s privacy, it was a momentary lapse of judgement.  A split-second decision to figure out what the hell Steve had been staring at for four days straight.  It was back during that first week when Steve had moved in, and he, Romanoff and Wilson had set up shop in the common room.
“Cross my heart,” Steve says.  “Now that I’ve seen what my Star Trek models do for you, I figure I’ll for sure get to third base when I dig out my old Battlestar Galactica sketches.”
He’s not going to tell Steve that, though. He keeps it to himself like he keeps so much to himself these days. Instead he shoots Steve his most charming smile.
“Gave myself a ringtone, too,” Tony says with a smirk. “That way you won’t have to wonder if it’s me.”
James makes eye contact with Bruce for long enough to let Bruce know he considers this conversation to be the very height of stupidity, and then he returns his focus to the laptop.
“Is it okay with you if I go?” Bruce asks James. “You can listen to the playback through JARVIS if you want to hear everything we discuss. No secrets.”
Steve shakes his head and gives Tony a sad smile.  “No one.  I just-- toughed it alone, I guess.  After that I read up on what I could find.  What helps some people.  What might help me.  A lot of what I read was more for friends or family members.  Thought it might come in handy someday.”
Considering Tony’s got the nicest car Steve’s ever been in, a mansion, and his own ice rink, Stave has no clue what he could want. Still, Tony’s been nothing but nice to him since they properly met, so he nods.
His skepticism makes Bruce laugh. “I’m sure my degree in Nuclear Physics is valid. I’m not nearly as sure I’m qualified to be looking at scans and assessing your health. Thankfully, Tony has an AI that can help me, with your permission. Tony also suggested we get a scan of your arm so we can tell if there’s anything concerning in there. Things like a tracker, or a self-destruct button they could detonate remotely if they ever figure out you’re alive. But that is entirely up to you.”
“Bucky and Clint and Nat-- they were all dismissed from their posts, but they got to come home right away.  Honorable discharge, or as close to it as a top secret organization can give.  But someone had to take the fall, and I was in charge.  It had to be me.”
“We’ll walk,” Bruce says, as Natasha flicks her finger toward Steve and then points her thumb toward the car, so he knows he’s riding with Tony.
Tony wipes at his eyes with his palm. “You’re not bad at this talking thing. I should have known you’d be some kind of therapy all-star.”
“You can see for yourself when he comes out,” Bruce says, not really wanting to say much about James behind his back. “I think I’d rather talk about why you’ve been following me around Austria, but didn’t stop by to say hello. I wouldn’t have minded the company.”
That at least draws Steve’s attention. He turns his eyes slowly up to Tony. “I feel like I’m going to regret asking this, but what’s a BannerBar?”
“Oh my god, I am going to die from sugar overload if you keep looking at me like I’m made of cotton candy. Stop,” Tony complains.
“Go get whatever pieces you’ve got and meet me down at the lab,” Tony tells Sam. "JARVIS’ll show you the way.  I can’t guarantee they’ll look exactly the same since I’m gonna need to scavenge parts from my old suits, but it’ll be close and I can guarantee you they’ll fly.  Probably better than before.”
“I set Jarvis loose on them,” Tony explains. “If it’s tech, and they touch it, they get a blue screen of death that tells them to apologize to you in person for being unprofessional dicks. They’re going on ohhhh... 20 hours with no phones, internet or Xbox.”
“I’ll start making a list of the combinations I think will explode,” Bruce says, giving Tony a nod.  “When you get back, we’ll see if I’m right.”
“Loud and clear,” Tony says, his image replacing the cartoon cat and mouse. “I’ve already got Jarvis sorting out what I’ll need for a lab, Pepper is clearing my schedule and Steve ran up to his room for his duffel bag the second Barnes said we could visit. You’ll see us in under an hour. Good work, Banner. Way to save a life.”
“Jarvis, mute that,” Bruce says. “Monitor James in silent mode. Only give me a heads up if there’s reason for concern.”
Sometimes Steve wishes their league was structured a little more like the other Hockey Leagues. A best of seven series sounds great right about now.
Bruce works fast to get the nutrition started and once it’s pumping into James, he checks all of the monitors again, then again.
The Quinjet drops down close-by, and the bay doors slide open. Natasha appears at the top and she’s got some sort of high-tech stretcher under one arm.
They leave the conversation there.  Clint because he ventures back into one of the bedrooms to put on some actual clothes, and Bruce because he’s worried any more talk could be construed as an outright push and that’s cruel to do to James.  He focuses on finishing his cooking, then plating up food for him and Clint.  He grabs two more beers from the fridge as Clint returns to join them.  They eat in silence.  Bruce is almost to his last bite when James speaks up.
“They’ve got a ton of security here for just a server farm,” Steve points out.  “More than you’d expect.”
Tony ducks his head looking shy, and that’s new, Steve thinks. Or maybe Tony’s always been shy about open admiration but he’s never had anyone look at him the way Steve’s looking at him now.
Tony’s smile changes, into something more thoughtful.  Of course he knows deflection when he sees it.  He’s a master of it, after all.
But all of this happiness doesn’t translate to smiles when Tony’s alone.  He’s so depressed, he doesn’t even realize Pepper’s walked into his office until she coughs to get his attention.  She’s already seen his screen, so there’s no point denying he’s sitting around in the middle of the afternoon, watching a live security feed of Steve at his desk.  Like a creeper.
Which takes him back to Steve’s Bucky memories only seeming two years removed.  Why hadn’t that occurred to Tony before?  This has to be a
She leaves it there and Steve looks up from his StarkPad in slight exasperation.  “Anyone ever tell you that talking to you is like riddling with the Sphinx?”
“Bogotá,” she whispers into his ear, and then she walks away.  The elevator doors open for her automatically, then close behind her as Tony takes the seat she vacated on the couch.
If this had been a few days ago Bruce might have pushed for more enthusiastic content, but now-- he’ll take unhappy acceptance, if that’s what it takes.
soldier, sounding like a kid. James doesn’t want pain. He’s afraid of pain and it’s thick in his voice and written all over his face. Bruce can tell from the change in Tony’s expression that he sees the fear there, too.
“I would never hurt you,” Steve says.  He stands absolutely still, so Tony doesn’t interpret any movement as threatening.  “If you’re not interested in me, that’s fine.  We can be friends.  Team mates.  Polite strangers.  It’s your call.”
He’s called Steve because if they do this face to face Tony’s gonna punch him straight in the teeth and break his damn hand on that perfect smile.
Tony snickers. “Please tell me you don’t think that’s where the Internet is located. I’m dying over here.”
They head toward the exit and spill out onto the street.  There’s anonymity in numbers and blue jeans and Tony doesn’t catch any strangers taking notice of him.  That’s a nice change.
“I’m sorry,” Bruce apologizes. “It’s not even the questions, it’s just-- this is a topic I think about a lot myself.  The what-ifs surrounding what happens when Hulk smashes my friends. It’s nice to have someone who understands, even if I’m sorry it’s anything you’ve got to worry about.”
“Eww.  Gross,” Tony scoffs.  “Get your brain out of the gutter, Rogers.  This isn't a high school kink.  Just.  I like this shirt.  And you can’t have it back.  It’s mine forever.  For infinity.  I’m not sure you’ll understand how serious I am about keeping this shirt until I die and have myself buried in it.”
“That I’d done something shameful enough that you had to invoke your admin privileges and tell Jarvis my sex tape was a threat to the security of the Avengers? Yeah, that wasn’t my proudest moment.”
If you loved TCYK just the way it was, thank you SO MUCH for reading it and know that it still stands all by itself.  These are two completely different universes, but about half the content is the same!  The other half is all new!!!
"You hear those crickets?" Clint asks. "That's the sound of inevitability. Maybe you should be more of a dick and then we'd leave you alone. That or go ahead and get your psych degree."
The information Kate and Nanna retrieved, contained more than a hit on Tony and some stolen Stark Industries secrets; Stane and Hammer had been idiot enough to store government secrets on the servers as well.  Secrets gleaned from the sorts of sources that get you locked up in a cell at the bottom of the ocean.  Tony isn’t going to need to worry about the two of them for a long, long time.
“Yeah,” Clint agrees.  “It’s me, Sam, Nat, Bucky and Kate.  Steve doesn’t play, but we send him photographic evidence since he’s the photoshop expert.  If he calls bullshit it doesn’t count.”
Well, that explained it.  Obie'd always hated Bruce and the SAD floor was known as something of a talent wasteland.  Half of all the personnel complaints Tony ever glimpsed seemed to originate on that floor.
Tony stays in his armor as they wait for news.  He leaves the faceplate open but the rest of him is entirely closed off.  That’s okay.  Steve gets it, he really does.  It’s awkward to hold hands with Tony in his gauntlets anyway, so instead they lean against each other for comfort, secluded on a couch in a private waiting area.  They don’t speak more than a few polite words in the first hour.
“Aren’t there yet in our relationship,” Tony says, bailing Steve out from the awkwardness. “It’s fine. I’m not upset. It’d be a dick move to be pissed at the people trying to protect me.”
“I do,” Steve says. “You could have taken the easy way out. Kept drinking. Kept pushing us away. None of us could have stopped you, and you were really on a roll there for awhile. But you chose, all on your own, to walk away from that. To try and fix things even though you had to know how much that was going to suck. How can I be anything but proud?”
“One more question and then we need to cut to commercials,” the main show host says.  “Apart from the sex, which is well-- obviously-- you’re saying you weren’t that impressed.  But otherwise... is he what you’d expect?”
“It’ll be a day or more before I think you should attempt eating,” Bruce says. “I was talking about IV nutrition. You need calories to heal and your body has already burned through anything you ate back in Europe. Sam and Natasha carried everything we’d need into the house, so I can get you all set up in there if you’re okay with that.”
“You think I’m going to create an Artificial Intelligence that can go behind my back to break laws without me? Give me a little credit. Anytime Jarvis does something outside of his ordinary protocols I have a subroutine that sends me a notification. Accessing Hammer’s servers was pretty far out of the ordinary.”
Easter Eve dinner turns into a huge argument about who is the most capable of keeping a baby alive should one of them ever end up a parent.  It's the sort of argument that only happens after mortals are several bottles of wine in, and the Super Soldiers and the deity have celebrated the holiday with some Asgardian Rum.  Pepper's idea on how to settle the dispute once and for all is met with tipsy, wager-making enthusiasm.
“I’m good to walk, unless James’s knee is bothering him,” Bruce says. “Then we can figure out a way to discreetly borrow a car.”
Tony doesn’t reply.  He’s already lost in his thoughts again.  Less time passes this time before he makes his next guess about Steve’s intentions.
She emphasizes the words ‘nothing personal’ in a way that makes them seem incredibly significant and very, very personal.  Rhodey stares down at his drink.
“And you’d have been smart to do that,” Clint says, waving a hand dismissively. “I have a face that pisses people off.  Anyway, the important part is that Steve
“I think you’ll be fine,” Bruce says. “At worst, he’ll call you stupid and threaten to shake some sense into you. I can’t tell you if he’s Bucky Barnes or not, but what I know for absolute certain is that he’s a hell of a lot more than Hydra gave him credit for.
“Steve would die for you whether you’re you, Bucky Barnes or some guy he met 5 minutes ago on the street. That’s just how he is. Avoiding him won’t change that.”
“I’m sorry your father wasn’t good to you,” Steve says.  “And I’d say I wish I’d been around to knock some sense into him, but if Peggy couldn’t do it, I don’t think I’d have stood a chance.”
It takes Steve a few seconds to turn feelings into vocabulary, and then to get his mouth around the words. “I want us to be honest with each other. I... um... I want to treat you the way I’ve always wanted to see you treated. I want to support you. I want to take you to bed and show you how beautiful I think every inch of you is. I want to spend whole days in your workshop, listening to you explain whatever it is you’re doing in there. I want to find a breakfast restaurant that we both like, and I want to never try another Egg McMuffin again. I’m sorry, those things are like rubber vomit, seriously. That was off track, I know. This is just... hard.”
“That’s the spirit,” Steve says.  He hops off the table spryly and opens the door for Tony.   As soon as they’re inside, he takes the lead again.  Tony’s got a clear path all the way back to his seat.
Tony knew she meant the Tupperware bowl (Rhodey had warned him long ago his mother took Tupperware seriously) but a few weeks later he had packaged up the bowl and the quilt together and had them sent back to Mrs. Rhodes.
“I’ll see what I can do,” Tony agrees, as they speed toward the security checkpoint gate of HammerTech.
She tosses Steve her StarkPhone.  A text conversation is displayed on the screen using the secure channel Tony’s set up for all the Avengers.
Of course they’ve got a forgery set in the toolshed.  Makes total sense.  Tony fucking loves this family.
I need more scans.  These are a day old and in super soldier time that makes them practically prehistoric.
Mae lets the words hover for a few seconds, then pats Steve’s hand as she stands.  “You’re one of the good ones, Steve Rogers.  You’d make any mama proud.  Now when Mr. Stark is better, you bring him around.  I’ll have the shake renamed for him by then.”
When they finish their food, James wastes no time standing up and walking out to the porch.  Clint shrugs and follows.  With nothing to do otherwise, Bruce follows them outside and moves off to the side so he won’t be in the way.
“All clear,” James reports, coming to stand in the center of the living room. He looks exhausted, despite his rigid posture.
“Nope,” Steve says.  “Don’t do that,” he adds gently.  “The relationship between a kid and a parent is completely one-sided.  He had all the power; you had none.  That makes it not your fault.”
“You’re beautiful,” Steve says, running his fingers lightly over one of the lowest scars.  “And anyone who ever said different is full of shit.”  Just like Steve knew they’d be.
“You don’t really have to call me sir,” Steve says conversationally.  “Or Captain.”  He walks behind the bar since that’s where he assumes the bulk of the liquor sits.  “I'm pretty sure we moved to a first name basis when we started breaking into corporate servers together.”
“I’d like the company,” Steve says, saving Bruce from his doubt. “I know how much he misses you. Thank you for being willing to forgive him. I don’t think he thought you would.”
James nods, but doesn’t reply. He picks up his borrowed satchel and takes off in the direction they’d been walking.
Tony feels his chest tighten.  He hates to think about this stuff.  Especially hates the part where he can hear admiration in Steve’s voice.  It will always feel undeserved.
It takes them an hour to get locked and loaded and another hour to drive to the set-up point.  Nanna and Kate have taken Kate’s purple Volkswagen and the rest of them have piled into a van that Bucky explains he keeps stored in a garage nearby.
Which has Bruce jumping out of his chair because shit that isn’t good. Though a quick check of the monitors has him feeling more reassured.
Something small takes a tumble in that direction, like deodorant or toothpaste hitting the bathroom floor.
James looks at Steve. “You ever think the future is weird? Like most stuff got better but a few things got turned around?”
“Employees come out here on breaks,” Steve explains.  “They let us use it though.  We’re everybody's favorites.”
I'm so sorry about the cliff hanger, but there is no where else I could possibly break up these two chapters!  The good news is, the next one is entirely written and only needs edited, so should be up next week instead of 6 months from now!  The extra good news, I don't write character death so Bucky is going to be fine.  I promise.  Only happy endings here, once they get past all this hard stuff!
Tony puts an arm around Sean and tries to pull him back away from the table.  Sean rips out of Tony’s grasp, but doesn’t have the balls to come at Steve.  Instead he storms off and Tony follows after him.  Clint nods to a side door.
“Except I wouldn’t have believed even for a second you’d do that,” Steve reminds him.  “I trust you.”
“If you really want to know what I do on the internet,” Steve says.  “Most of what I look at is the art.  Pictures of famous paintings I’d only ever seen in books that could never really capture what was there.  And lately I’ve been looking at the art people make of us.  There was one set of individual painted panels in the Art Nouveau style that if I could have figured out the artist I would have tried to buy.  They were incredible”
Steve’s out of the jet before the ramp’s done lowering, and he takes the path JARVIS had shown him before at a sprint.  Tony’s on the floor against his bed, in a compact Tony-shaped ball, shaking and struggling to slow his lungs.  Steve asks no questions, he simply sits, wraps an arm around Tony’s shoulder, and launches into a monologue about his thoughts on motorcycle helmet laws.  It’s the first thing that comes to mind, and slowly, eventually, Tony’s panic attack subsides.
“I saw it,”  Natasha says.  “Pepper emailed me the clip right after it aired.  Shayla’s lucky she was on the next flight out of New York.  It’d be a shame if something bad had happened to her.”
“Which I considered. I even gave Fury a head’s up and I had Jarvis acting as tech support for the whole operation all day. Didn’t I, J?”
Ever since the words “Who the hell is Bucky?” were uttered, Steve's never been far from misery.  In that moment, and every moment since, Steve could only see a future of all or nothing.  Either Bucky returned, or Steve lived the rest of his life in loss.  He got Bucky back or he would be looking for him forever.  Now... looking at Tony.  Thinking of dishes thrown, and late night beer, and bad television and Judgement Free Zones... it's the first time that it occurs to Steve that maybe it’s not all or nothing after all.  Maybe even without Bucky, there is something left for Steve in the in between.
“I missed you, too,” Tony says. “I’ve thought a lot about you. About everything you said. And I want to do it. To try this. To date. I talked to someone about us. My main therapist. She said there isn’t any reason it can’t work but that it’s going to mean a lot of you and me talking. About things. First.”
“Yes you do,” Tony says, popping open the driver’s side door of the bright orange QuickCar.  “Now get in.  The seat will move back.  You aren’t that much taller than me.”
“Not your best plan,” Steve agrees.  “You know if you ever want to break things off with me we can just talk about it, right?”
“Got it,” Bruce says. He pockets the phone, feeling it buzz again as he does. It’s an address that he turns to show James. James nods as if it’s perfectly reasonable to have a safe house in less than a minute. Bruce has earned an iota of trust; he wants to make good on it fast.
The screens around Tony fill with images, that he realizes immediately are scans of Barnes.  The metal arm and shoulder are kind of a dead give away.  Emphasis on
Steve sighs when he hears footsteps.  Tony’s been gone all of twenty minutes since the BannerBar argument and Steve’s plodding through a part of Bucky’s history that’s making his stomach churn and his blood boil.
“Are we getting close?” Bruce asks, as he wrestles his water bottle out of his bag and unscrews the top.
“You’ve got to eat up,” Clint prompts.  “The record’s four platters, and tonight, we’re going for five.”
Tony’s biting back a smile despite his complaints.  He’s trying to hide how happy this makes him, but he can’t.
He and Clint and Natasha debrief with the STRIKE team the whole flight home, so once they’ve got wheels on the ground, Steve hops on his motorcycle and heads straight for the tower.  Since Tony’s installed a link with Jarvis, Steve uses it to let Tony know he’s on his way.
Steve nods.  “You do have a point.  I could tell you what I like and don’t like about the ones I’ve tried so far, if that helps.”
At first Tony’s distracted by Steve’s abs but when he gets a better look at the t-shirts piled on the bed all his attention goes there.  One of the shirts, hand to God, is from Steve’s high school days.  It’s dark blue, with a star centered at the top, and BHS ALL-STAR written in big block letters below.  It’s faded and when Tony picks it up, it’s silky soft in that vintage way that people pay big bucks for these days.
“You literally insisted we use the tower as homebase to look for Bucky. You wouldn’t take no for an answer. If you don’t want me here, I’ll go back to Washington.”
Tony picks up the paper and starts to read it.  It’s short.  Three pages.  His eyes soften.  He remembers now.  This paper really was full of promise.  When he puts his essay down, he does so carefully.
“There’s going to be more healing,” Bruce says. “So this isn’t your stopping point. Another day could make a big difference here, but if you feel like something’s wrong in the healing process I want to take that seriously. I have two suggestions, and whether or not we try them is entirely up to you. If you would rather just move on, I’m good with that.”
“Nah,” Tony says.  “I figured we’d strap Barton to the roof.  The rest of us can just ride with the windows down.  We’ll be fine.”
Then Steve and Tony laugh so hard they can barely pull apart.  It takes Steve almost a minute to regain his composure enough to move.
Bruce shows up about an hour and a half into the wait.  He’s dusty and his clothes are mismatched and ill-fitting.  There’s really no telling where he found them.
Steve comes up behind Tony and leans down so he can wrap an arm around Tony’s chest and kisses him on the ear a few times.
Steve lets the words sit in the air. As excuses go, it’s terrible. He doesn’t think Tony’s lying, though. To Tony, that’s the truth. It really is that simple.
There was always a chance they’d report me and Barney and we’d get separated. Never trusted SHIELD Medical because I guess I always figured their responsibility was to SHIELD not to me. But I trust Bruce.  He’s never given me a reason to not.”
“Let me see your phone,” Tony agrees. “You can text me when you know you’ve got a free coupla hours. As long as you’re sure it’s not an imposition.”
“I’ll make you a plate with some bread and cheese then.  You shouldn’t work on an empty stomach.  You’ll get light-headed.”
Clint sounds as hurt and angry as Bruce has ever heard him. Honestly, he’s not sure he’s ever heard Clint sound this vulnerable now that he thinks about it. Either the subject is that raw, or Clint is letting his guard down a little.
A few minutes later the water shuts off.  There’s more rustling and some muted thumps.  Eventually the door opens, and Tony’s leaning against the doorframe for support, with the towel wrapped around his waist.  He’s angled himself deliberately so his chest is turned away from Steve.
“You mentioned that,” Bruce says. “I’m going to guess since they were freezing and thawing you, they were giving you liquid nourishment? Solids could pose a logistical problem to that process. Obstructions and ice damage would be trouble throughout your digestive track.”  He looks to James for clarification.
“Tony?” Bruce asks. “Yes, he does, but he won’t show up unannounced. Okay-- probably he won’t show up unannounced. Like... 50/50 at worst and I can ask him to leave.”
“I doubt this is what you want to hear, but I guess it depends on who you start killing,” Bruce says honestly. “If it’s Hydra, I might be inclined to help. If it’s Steve--”
“Do I?” Tony asks. He gives up on ripping out the wires and just starts beating the thing on the table as hard as he can in frustration. Shards of plastic and wire and metal fling off in a spray around him. “Or does it even matter? I’d let you, you know that right? Fuck whoever you want. I would let you do anything if it meant keeping you. I’m fun like that.”
Tony’s body does not disappoint.  Sure, there are scars.  And an arc reactor.  There is absolutely nothing unattractive about either.  If anything, the imperfections add to Steve’s attraction.  Without the scars and the reactor Tony wouldn’t be alive.  He loves them, because they’re a part of the journey that brought them here.
“He’s still out cold,” Sam says, letting his head fall back against the metal support of the medbed.
He tosses and turns for almost half an hour after she's gone before he gives up on getting any more sleep.
“It’s not pity,” Steve says.  “I like what I heard.  I like when you’re honest.  And I would like you to come to dinner with me.”
One week. Tony waits one week to hear from SHIELD after the triskelion falls. When he does, it’s nothing official (because there’s nothing official left) (SHIELD is ash and rubble) (SHIELD is Hydra) it’s Maria Hill showing up at Stark Industries looking for a job. They hire her, of course, because Pepper’s not stupid and also because Hill is good people and Stark Industries can desperately use good people right now.
“I am sir.  The fleas have been deployed and an armored car is headed your way.  It will track your location so anywhere you can exit the woods safely is an acceptable pick up point.”
“Do you have scissors or are you planning to try this with your knife collection?” Bruce asks Clint, as Clint zips his duffel bag closed.
“Or you can just have as many StarkBars as I’ve got left?” Bruce asks. “Whatever you want. You know your body better than I do.”
there is a fine line between pushing and giving James the support he needs to express himself so Bruce stays quiet for a moment. The best he can do is watch James’s face and look for cues, and when James’s frustration appears to fade slightly and he looks more tired than anything else, Bruce decides to try a different approach.
“This wasn’t your fault,” Steve says, instinctively knowing that’s where Tony is going with this. “You aren’t on the team right now.”
“You already love me forever,” Bucky says, handing over a thermos he pulls from his messenger bag.  He turns his eyes to Tony and uses a flirtatious drawl when he speaks.  “Whatever Clint did, I’m sure he’s very sorry.”
They don’t talk for long. They’re exhausted from the game and the late hour and the weight of it all. Steve sleeps in a guest room. Tony tosses and turns and hates the hollow space in his bed. Steve should be there. Tony completely understands why he isn’t, but it doesn’t make the empty pillow taunt him less.
The next minute and a half are a blur. Steve’s played in some intense games. They don’t even compare to this. And then Tony breaks away.
Tony’s thoughts on Hulk have always differed from Steve’s, but there is some comfort in knowing that no matter how bad things get, at least one member of the team is protected.
The evening wears on and champagne is passed around like water, and it’s not even 9 PM and most of the table is drunk.  Tony’s finally talking, and it’s about hydraulics and pneumatics and how they relate to some race-car Tony’s built, and he’s excited.  Really excited, judging by the expressive way his hands move and the smile that finally reaches his eyes.  Tony’s discussing a type of science Steve understands and even though Steve’s not part of the conversation he’s fascinated.  He wishes he could see Tony like this more often: happy and unguarded.
It helps (and helps is not the right word here because it’s an awful gift sometimes) that Tony’s got such a vivid imagination.  It also helps that Tony’s seen Steve’s laptop screen of horrors and has loads of HYDRA acquired data sitting there in his brain, ready to paste itself onto Rhodey.
“Two guns, two knives, and your arm,” Clint rattles off. “Then the knife Bruce dropped. So either you’re not as good as we think you are, or even with you going all Winter Soldier on us-- we got out alive.”
“I’m not here to fire Clint,” Tony explains for the second time.  He's careful not to sound impatient since he wants to encourage this whole not-afraid-of-Tony-Stark vibe he’s getting.  “I was asking about Dr. Banner--”
“Oh!  And take off your pants.  Nanna doesn’t like pants,” Clint adds, too enthusiastic to keep his cool anymore.
Tony has an idea of where “here” is, but he’d only seen it on a map earlier.  It all looked flat.  The terrain as he hops out of the back of the van is more complicated.  They’re at the rim of a quarry of some kind, with loose dirt and stones as far as Tony can see down into the hole.  Off in the distance there’s a barbed-wire-enclosed building and a small purple Beetle parked alongside a dozen or so dark, unmarked cars.  Twelvish cars means twelvish employees.  That’s not so many, Tony hopes.
Steve moves on and Tony follows.  When they reach the second floor, Steve hesitates for a moment before he opens the first door to his left.
“Name of your sex tape,” Clint says, sounding triumphant.  His words are followed by a sharp oomph as Natasha takes her revenge.
Bruce holds up his hand, makes sure James sees it, and then slowly lowers it to James’s leg. “How many fingers do you feel?”
“Stop,” Tony half laughs, half whines. “When you’re back-- then you can corner me into a heart to heart. Just-- stay where you are for now. Tell me what to send for Barnes.  I’ll make it happen.”
“I’m not worried about it,” Clint says. “You could come at me with a rusty knife made out of a Pepsi can, doc. I’m going to trust you know what you’re doing.”
Steve puts down the knife and peanut butter and slides down to his knees.  He presses a few soft kisses to Tony’s thigh, then looks up at him.
Whatever, it’s a little lie.  And yeah, maybe the lies add up.  He might know a bit more about biology than he lets on to Bruce, or more about the physics of the archer’s paradox than he lets on to Barton, or more about well-- everything-- than he lets on to Steve, but it’s for the best.  He likes Steve.  He likes to be around Steve.  And Steve isn’t going to like a know-it-all.
The group at the table guard their egg-babies a little more attentively until Bucky pulls another dozen out from the fridge.  Then they can breathe easy.
“JARVIS will fly us anywhere we want to go,” Tony says.  “I made it for the Avengers.  Technically it’s SHIELD’s but I can use it when I want.”
He reaches for Tony and once he’s got hold of him he pulls him close and then flips on top of him, pinning him with a quickness that takes Tony’s breath away.  Steve leans down to kiss Tony behind the ear and then places a few more gentle kisses down to where his neck meets his shoulder.
who is ultra-talented and super friendly and who gave me permission to post this here!  She sometimes does commissions and you can find more information on her Tumblr.  You can also see lots of great art there!  I totally recommend giving her a follow!
“We all know what you’d do for a million dollars,” Natasha says, nudging Clint. “We’re talking about Steve, and Steve doesn’t want the money.”
Bruce sits up with a start. He doesn't go peek in at James no matter how tempting it is. He’d told James they don’t intend to trap him here and allowing him space is the easiest way to prove that.  Bruce heads for the bathroom instead. He hadn’t bothered washing up the night before and he really should have.  He’s disgusting.
Tony walks back out to the hall, and then down to where he hear voices and smells something that might be appealing if his stomach can figure out what it plans to do with itself. The hall opens to a combined living room/dining room/kitchen/laundry/study area. Or well-- there’s a stove, fridge, and sink, plus a laundry line and ironing board, a dining table, two desks, a couch and several chairs. Tony’s not sure there’s a name for this kind of room. It’s big, so it isn’t cramped. Just... cozily multifunctional.
“That’s complicated,” Bruce says. “He’s not ready to see you, yet. When he’s ready he says he’ll find you.  Please don’t ask Tony for our location.  I don’t want to put him in the middle of this.”
“You mean the same sort of low-lifes who flock to him now?” Steve guesses. “Avengers and present company excluded.”
And once they’ve grown bored with their zamboni games, there’s still some hockey to be played. It’s been years, maybe, since Steve’s laughed this hard. His sides ache as he collapses at center ice. He stares up at the roof and wishes life could always be this easy. Effortless happiness. He could get used to this.
Steve turns and pulls the blanket up over Tony again to help him feel more secure.  He rubs his arm soothingly and Tony goes quiet again.  Steve checks the clock.  There’s no point in trying to nap so he decides to allow himself to dwell on thoughts he’s spent the last 15+ hours shoving out of his mind.
Steve hops up to get out of the way as Bruce crosses the room.  A glance at the screens tells Bruce that nothing big has gone wrong.
When Bruce hears an old Chevy making it’s way up the drive, that’s his cue to head upstairs.  It’s not that he doesn’t want to see Tony or Natasha-- he does.  But not yet.  Not until he feels more human than zombie.
The next two weeks are some of the longest of Steve’s life. He’s antsy all the time. He’s distracted in conversation, because his brain is far more interested in replaying that last hug with Tony than thinking about anything useful to SHIELD. This isn’t the first time Steve’s been stuck on someone like this. It was just as bad with Peggy. Boy, did he have it bad for her there in the beginning.
At least Jarvis’s refusal to spill the beans means whatever it is, Tony isn’t in imminent danger.  And Steve does feel better knowing Rhodey and Pepper have been keeping an eye on things.
His whole body freezes and his expression goes from annoyed to panicked in an instant. He shuts his eyes hard. Bruce stares in worried fascination as James’s face smooths into something cold and impassive.
Bruce nods.  “I appreciate that you’re not asking,” Bruce says.  “But I don’t think James would mine me telling you he’s doing as well as can be expected, and I expect he’ll make as full of a recovery as is possible.”
Bruce turns off the stove and carries the plate of pancakes over to the table. Clint’s method of breakfast eating seems kind of genius, so he picks one up and rolls it like a rug. Eating the pancake by hand makes it easier to inspect the new technology.
The men all laugh it off, but the next morning Natasha, Bucky and Clint are the only ones not wearing socks at breakfast.
They all gear up, and then Tony explains the rules.  He and Steve have come up with a game that borrow rules from Capture the Flag, Kick the Can, traditional paintball, and The Art of War.  Basically, they’ve spent waaaaay too many late nights on this.
Now that Steve’s made up his mind, he’s eager to move forward and he’s hopeful his friends will understand.
The photographers push in further and Steve starts shoving them out of the way so he can join Tony and get the SI staff through the mob.  Since heading back for the street seems like a poor life choice, Tony and Steve get into the elevator, too.
“Great.  Can’t believe I’m suggesting this, but I don’t want to have to wait for Happy to get here and...” Tony taps on his phone a few times.  “There’s a QuickCar just down the block.”
“Nanna’s here,” Steve says. He pulls back more so he can look at Tony like that should mean something.
Since it’s lunch time, the place is crammed full of people. They can’t talk about anything important so they chat about the mundane as they eat.  It’s actually kind of nice.  Tony can’t remember the last time he sat and made comfortable small talk.  The sort where you just give your friend shit the whole time, and nothing you say matters.
“S’not a problem,” Tony says. “I don’t like how they’re treating you in the press. Can’t do much about that, but I’m not going to let it happen right in front of me. Being gay’s not a crime.”
“I’m not sure what you thought would happen when you told me this,” Tony says.  “But it doesn’t change anything.  You really think I’d even go for someone who’s all about following orders?”
Steve slams his fist down against the wooden conference table hard enough that it cracks in two.  Microphones and drinks tumble toward the center where the sagging table cloth catches them in a pile. The simultaneous feedback of five mics banging together all at once sends a painful screech through the room.
Steve appreciates that this woman doesn’t try to make conversation.  Tony’s mumbling to himself, and he stinks like cheap liquor and puke, and Steve’s head aches with the effort of keeping his Captain America face on as they pass a janitor, and then a few guards.  He gives them grateful nods, and small, apologetic smiles.  He’s not sure why except the alternative is to frown at all of them deeply, and it isn’t their fault Tony’s in this mess.
It takes Tony the better part of a conference call to rig up a fake employee phone extension and a voice converter, but it’s so worth it to use the inter-office intercom to page the 7th floor for a Mr. Jack Hoff.  The thrill is amplified when he gets his first text from Steve (whom he’s still not met) to confirm his first 10 points.
Steve feels a pang of remorse because Tony’s shoulders are set tense and his expression borders on tragic.  His only crime (as far as Steve knows) is doing exactly what Steve had asked him to do and for his efforts Steve has been nothing but a total dick.
Tony’s still asleep and he doesn’t stir as Steve tucks the blanket in around him.  He’s totally dead to the world.  It makes Steve wonder just how long it’s been since Tony slept.  A while, probably.
“I should have done that first. I’m sorry,” Steve says. His expression really is full of apology. He means it. “I’ve still got a headache. I thought the taco might help.”
Which is a problem for future!them, because Bruce is all out of brain space to wonder what that’s all about.
James looks up from his hands and lets out a breath, like he’s exhaling his confusion. “Guess it makes sense, what with neither of you havin’ one lick of sense.”
“I suck,” Tony says helplessly. “Really. That’s the explanation. I wish I had something better for you, I really do. I just-- I didn’t want to take you down with me. And I knew-- I knew I was going down. I knew that’s where we were going.”
“Yeah,” Steve agrees.  “I mean-- that army of flea drones that distracted the helicopter definitely created themselves.”
“Seriously.  It was a dumb game anyway,” Bruce consoles.  “Why don’t you clean up the mess and we don’t even need to tell Tony how it happened?  I’ll say I bumped my egg myself.”
When the plates and mugs are nothing but shards and dust, Steve picks up the empty box and walks toward the pile.
“It’s adorable you know all that.  I always suspected you were secretly a nerd.  You hide it behind the tight shirts but eventually we all find each other.  I was telling Rhodey just the other day—”
Bruce is torn between asking questions to dig deeper into this and backing off because he doesn’t want to introduce thoughts into James’s head that aren’t already there. It turns out, this time, James continues all on his own.
“All chasing him has done so far is drive him further underground,” Sam says.  “If he goes any farther south, we’re gonna be interrogating penguins.”
The elevator comes to a stop and Steve gets a glimpse of the penthouse as Tony pushes off the wall and steps away.
Clint sighs and looks to James, who gives half a shrug as if asking ‘what the hell does this have to do with me?’
James lets out a slow breath. “I trust you,” he says. “And I trust Clint. The other two can stay if you think it’s a good idea.”
“You’ll have a better chance of figuring it out than I will,” Bruce says. “And if you want to speak to him, he said once he’s up from his nap, he might be willing to see you. Even sounded like he was looking forward to it.”
Something’s not right and I think it might kill him, supersoldier or not.  I’m really worried and I don’t want to fuck it up.
“Captain America wants to sext with me. Today is awesome. And for the record. I don’t think you’re going to be boring in the sack. I said it because I’m a dick. I have no doubts we’ll be just fine there.”
“I’ve got numbing spray I can use on your skin if you think that might make this easier,” Bruce suggests.
“Jenny texted me updates through the first two periods, but I got back to my place in time to see the third. You were on fire out there.”
He’s really not usually this hostile.  Or at least he tries to hide it better.  There’s something about Tony that allows Steve to let down his guard in a way he doesn’t do with anyone else.  And that’s probably shitty of him because Tony doesn’t deserve his mood.  No one does.
“But it’s a start,” Steve agrees.  “You want to-- I don’t know.  Watch some TV or eat or something? If you’re not busy.  If you’re busy, it’s fine--  I can make myself scarce.”
“I’ll show you dull,” Bucky says, raising an eyebrow.  “How long’s it going to take you three to get the blasts setup?” he directs to Tony.
In the forties, Steve had been promised a future without hunger.  Without war.  A city on the moon.  Flying cars.
The paparazzi outside the fundraiser end up exhausting Steve before he makes it inside, and once he’s in there, he spends another hour shaking hands with half the city.  By the time he gets his plate from the buffet and loads it up, he’s just looking for a quiet place to sit down and recover.  He’s pointed toward a VIP table by a helpful woman in a server’s uniform and he takes the seat labeled with his name.  It isn’t long before Tony and his guest take the seats across from him.
Steve smiles, and even though it’s a little sad, it looks like there’s some good memories behind it. “Then some things never change.”
“JARVIS, show me mine.  Let’s see if they got my good side.  Actually-- let’s face it, there’s really no bad side.”
James doesn’t verbally acknowledge the offer. Instead he meets Clint’s eyes, looks terribly unimpressed by their efforts to comfort him, then stomps into the house. The door to his bedroom slams a few seconds later. Clint and Bruce follow him inside and Bruce flops onto the couch before pulling a throw pillow over his face to just hold it there.
James’s eyes turn to Bruce. He’s got that look he gets when he runs out of words and rather than make him explain, Bruce steps in.
Picking Tony up from rehab is surprisingly anti-climactic.  It’s a Sunday so he drives over in the morning like usual.  The only difference is that this time Tony’s waiting for him on the porch with his duffel bag and a suitcase.  Steve knows Tony had planned to say all his inside goodbyes before Steve got there.  Tony’s exact words were “Leave the car running.  I’ll be ready to go.”
They scan ants, and beer bottles, and a spider web. James finds an old watering can with a family of mice living in it around the back side of the chalet and when several mice end up running up the spout and making a jump for safety, Bruce shrieks loud enough to inspire a few rounds of impressions from Clint.
When he finishes, his own hands feel weirdly empty after het lets go.  He reaches for a muffin out of the need to grasp something-- anything-- so he doesn’t reach back for Tony.
“Already on it,” Steve says. “I was thinking we can use the fire escape, climb up a few floors, walk the ledge over the back of the flower shop, take the roof, then cut through the second alley on the right. That’ll put us out behind Nixon’s Deli. There’s a hundred blind spots we can use between here and there.”
“No monkey business up there!” Bucky shouts from below.  “Not while we’re busy savin’ Stark’s ass down here!”
Tony looks like he’s going to say something biting, then leans back hard against the wall and covers his face with his hands.  “So do I.”
“It’s meant to be easy to digest,” Bruce says conversationally, as if this isn’t one giant mind fuck unravelling around him. “Should taste like lemon. High calorie. And it has enough fat that it will kind of... slide down. Ummmm... won’t induce thirst, and shouldn’t upset your stomach. Maybe. I haven’t let myself get thirsty enough for it to matter. But here--” Bruce reaches back into his bag for one of the two bottles of water he keeps refilling from a nearby stream. He rolls it to the soldier. “Just in case.”
“Who knows?” Tony says.  “But I emailed Jane.  Asked her to let him know I’m looking for him.  Figured it couldn’t hurt.”
there.  But he can’t be, and this is how he has to do things for now and that sucks. "Yeah, of course. What kind of injury?" he asks.  He knows he sounds deflated.  It’s the best he can do.
And that’s all.  He doesn’t try and make Steve feel better or convince him that he was a kid and he had good intentions and it wasn’t a big deal.  He just squeezes Steve knee and then speaks.
He makes a rush for James, but Clint is only a step ahead of the soldier and he turns when he hears James falter. It ends up being exactly the kind of mistake they’ve all been trying so damn hard to avoid. Bruce doesn’t even know what he’s seeing until Clint flies violently backward landing on his side in some deep grass. Bruce stops-- feels his panic rising-- and watches James fall forward on his face and begin to convulse there on the ground.
Neither party will engage in conduct regarded as favoritism or that other workers may reasonably perceive as favoritism.
Not because he’ll win.  It’s not a kitchen sink in his bag, it’s the industrial grade toolbox he keeps his art supplies in for travel, but well-- if losing means he gets to take Tony out for a burger and fries when all this is over... (as long as this doesn’t all blow up in their faces)
“Unmute me, J,” Tony says.  He waits a moment until he hears Bruce breathing on the other end of the call.  “Spangles and SpyGirl are here, but you’re not on speaker.  Where were we?”
to be in Tony’s lab.  Wants to meet his bots.  Things only gets worse when the elevator comes to a halt.
If Steve gets even an inkling Tony isn’t one-hundred percent on board with what they’re doing he’ll slow this down to an absolute crawl.
It’s Tony’s boyfriend.   Jonathan’s been charming all night with the team.  He doesn’t sound charming now.
“And who created JARVIS?” Steve asks.  “Or the armored car?  C’mon, sweetheart.  Let me brag about how awesome my boyfriend is.  I have never been more attracted to your brains.”
“This is a shitty situation, and I think maybe you need to hear someone say it out loud.  It’s shitty.  It’s unfair.  And even though Barnes is doing what he’s got to do to get by, that doesn’t mean it doesn’t suck for you.  You don’t have to be infinitely patient.  Maybe yes with him, but not in front of me.”
“Jarvis? Can you pull up a picture of Mercy Rhodes from back when we were on the USO tour together, please?” Steve asks.
JARVIS is literally a life saver. Bruce has done some surgery in his day, but he’s never come close to what they’ve done with James. He’s not sure anyone has, except maybe the HYDRA scientists who’d butchered him in the first place. But JARVIS had calmly walked them through every step, every scan, every death-defying cut and James is still breathing on the table.
He’s thought about it, of course.  Definitely considered proposing himself.  Also considered what a proposal from Tony would be like, and had wrongly assumed it would involve violins and skywriting and a thousand roses.  Tony’s romantic gestures were... big.  Always.
Bruce makes a death gesture that even he doesn’t understand. Sort of opossum-like, with his tongue lolling out of his mouth and his head tipping to the side. Clint laughs.
Tony taps across the screens expertly-- like he writes phone manuals in his free time-- and then hands the phone back to Steve.
Tony picks up a mug and flings it at the ramp. It breaks apart with a loud crack and joins the mess on the roof below.  “Not quite as impressive as your throw, but it gets the job done.”
Steve heads straight for the workshop when he gets back to the tower. Tony’s ripping the guts out of a circuit box like it personally wronged him. He studiously ignores Steve.
No one follows them down the hill.  When they emerge from the forest at the bottom of the hill, there’s a Stark SUV waiting.  The doors swing open and Natasha’s in the driver’s seat.  Sam has taken shotgun and the rear seats are empty and waiting.
“Sam, Natasha and Kate are Linguists.  Sam in French, Nat in Russian and Kate in Mandarin.  They spend a lot of time watching video from your other labs, making sure nothing shady’s going down.  They pitch in with translation projects, sometimes.  And then Clint and Bucky are Location Threat Specialists.  They look at floorplans and pictures of places you’re going to be going, and assess where assassins would most likely hide if they wanted to kill you.”
“Tony.”  Steve thrills a little at the feel of the name on his tongue.  Mostly he only ever says it in his head.  “What are you doing here?”
There are scans upon scans on every display, and blueprints (both computer print outs and hand drawn) all over the desk.  Tony has light holograms aimed onto the ceiling and there are  3d projections hovering over the floor.  The room around Steve looks unreal.  Dum-E and U roll continuously back and forth across the lab, bringing Tony tools, or fresh pencils, or a bottle of water he didn’t request but seemed to need.
It turns out, Thor’s resolve lasts another hour before he and Clint and Bucky have rigged the egg with some bow string and weights to Mjolnir’s handle to test Yolki’s worthiness.  For about half a second it looks like the hammer will wobble then--
“Europe,” Natasha says.  “No more than that.  The less we know, the less there is to give away in case of capture.”
