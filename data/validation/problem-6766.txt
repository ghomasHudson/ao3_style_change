Perhaps the look on his face was answer enough, because Rhodes frowned and guessed shrewdly, “You didn’t know?”
When they were alone, Tony was calm and open and relaxed. He grinned with a youthful exuberance that he claimed was out of place in the public eye; he became a simple mechanic instead of a billionaire businessman. He laughed with his whole body when he found something funny and he was perfectly happy splitting a pizza while in his grease-stained wifebeater and sweats. Most of all, he never skimped on the attention that he afforded Steve on those nights; he listened to everything Steve said and responded only after due consideration and care of the words, it didn’t matter whether they were discussing battle strategies or whether Steve enjoyed donuts over waffles. He treated Steve like he was the most important thing to him in that moment, and never hesitated to turn away from whatever, likely important, work he was busy with just because Steve needed him to.
” she murmured without conscious thought, lowering herself on to the window seat across from him and reaching a hand out towards her son.
With a grace that was at complete odds with her inexperience with kids, Toni bent down and scooped Peter up into her arms, lifting herself to her feet all while cradling her hand to her chest. The little boy, trembling, clung to her with a fierceness that was telling of his fear, reminiscent of the day she had first found him. He needed to feel safe, and she could do that for him, and that was all that was going to matter for the next little while.
Helpless to do anything else but try to catch the guy who’d done this, Steve nodded once, despite the fact that he knew Toni couldn’t see it.
Toni arched an unimpressed eyebrow. “They do know I don’t work for them, right?” she asked with a hint of disdain. She knew that Fury hadn’t asked as much as demanded their presence, and the genius had never taken orders very well.
It damn well should be, if Barnes was willing to throw Steve under the bus like this. “He gave us all very specific instructions,” he finally settled on, his expression strangely devoid of the usual scorn it held when he looked upon Tony. “The common part of all those instructions was to take care of you.
And she did. She understood that things weren’t good. She understood that there were no guarantees about how nature would run its course and hinder or help their rescue attempts. She understood that Toni had seen fit to send the child away, because she was planning on being reckless.
Not unlike then, Toni had the firm thought of her family in her head as she fought to take every next step, and breath, and move. The only difference was that her family had grown since that day; now, it included Bucky as well, who she couldn’t even begin to imagine her life without. It included Sam Wilson, who she had been right to assume would become friends with Steve and Bucky, and bring a little light to all their lives in the process, and it even included Loki, who now visited her for no apparent reason, completely unabashedly, and had even taken to her son.
She felt, more than heard, the rumble of approval that rolled through his chest; it was deep and heady and almost made her want to hum in response. Toni felt like she’d been on tenterhooks for the past few days, waiting for just this moment; waiting for Steve to realize that she was near to being fully healed from the horrific events of three weeks ago, and definitely ready for some of that inferno that always burned so hot between them.
Before he could make a response, Bucky was intervening. “Hey, c’mon, you guys know the rules,” he mock complained. “No flirting between Mom and Dad while we’re on the group comms.”
Lifting her head, the genius had a quick retort for Bucky poised on her lips, but it fell away when she spotted Maico in the brunet’s arms. Toni forced one of her trademark grins over her face, expertly clearing all fatigue and pain from her expression.
“Thank you,” he replied, his voice dipping a little lower unconsciously as his solemnity slipped through. “Although, I couldn’t have done it without the soldier in the armor you sent. I never did catch his name… can you tell me who he is? So I can thank him too?”
Steve anymore,” he whimpered through hitching breaths. “He… he y-yelled at you, and he li-… likes that horrible man more than u-us.”
Without preamble, he pulled her into his arms, lifting her into a bridal carry without exerting much energy at all. A small part of him purred in pleasure at having her so close to him, especially when she didn’t protest, only snuggled closer to his chest in response, but the dominant part of him was shivering right along with her, only in distress rather than pain.
With the gentlest touch he could muster, Steve wrapped an arm around her waist, steadying himself gingerly against the wall of debris and wondering absently how she’d managed to hold on so long, to something so unstable and impossibly small. “I got you, love,” he breathed, over and over again as he maneuvered her closer. “I got you. I got you.”
Toni’s voice came over the speakers, crackly and ill-defined but still clear enough to capture the weary pain it contained.
Toni was almost sobbing with the overload of pleasure, encouragement and affirmations falling from her lips without much awareness. She was clinging to Steve now, trying to hang on and meet his thrusts as much as she was able, and dimly, she wondered how it was possible that every time between them felt as raw and primal as the very first time.
Astoundingly, that resentment had bled away as quickly as it had been formed. In a twist of fair fortune, Steve had decided to reach out for help the day he’d come to the tower, whether or not he’d known it at the time, and Toni had happened to be on the alternate cycle of worrying over him rather than cursing his name. She’d welcomed him with all the warmth she normally reserved for a select four or five people in her life, and Steve had repaid her in kind by fumbling through an apology the very next night. Toni had been surprised to realize that she didn’t really need to hear it, and they’d decided to let bygones be bygones and just start fresh.
Peggy and Toni exchanged wicked grins that spoke more about their camaraderie than any words could. As far as Steve knew, there was a still a bit of an age difference between the women, but he supposed that being the only two females actively in the battlefield served as a rather strong basis for connection.
He had never been one of those guys who stood back and watched as some entitled, arrogant, pompous jerk took whatever extreme measures he so fucking desired because he believed that the entire world should bow down to his wishes. He had also never been the guy to walk away from someone in trouble, and so in a way, that first meeting of his and Toni’s was one that couldn’t have gone any other way. He’d knocked out the guy she was with, and when she’d begun to scream and yell at him for it, he’d simply tossed her over his shoulder and made the quick walk to his dorm.
“I’ll take that under advisement, Dr. Banner,” Rhodey replied amicably, and Toni hoped she was the only one who knew him well enough to see the hidden disregard in his eyes. If not for her, Toni knew, Rhodes wouldn’t have hesitated to pick a fight with Steve. Something they, no doubt, needed to talk through.
“Fuck, that hurt,” Howard groaned, eyes screwed shut, and Steve resisted the urge to tease him about how Toni had taken plenty worse and brushed it off with a snarky comment and the smirk she’d inherited off her old man. Steve didn’t figure the man would want to talk about his daughter when she’d just flattened him, and especially not about how tough aforementioned daughter was. Later, maybe, when they’d sorted the situation out and could have a laugh about it.
It took Peggy Carter – looking like a bombshell in a fitting red dress – and a little bit of good, old-fashioned jealousy before Steve realized what everyone else seemed to have suspected long before.
A few hours later, with Zola captured and Toni having assured them that she had enough energy to fly back to base on her own steam, Steve shared a drink with Bucky and explained everything he knew. His best friend had that same pinched, worried look on his face that he used to get whenever Steve got into a fight or got sick again, and idly, the blond realized that Toni was going to have a lot of extra mother-henning to deal with in the future.
Most of that awful tension had dissipated from Steve, but Toni knew it would be several days until the last of it was eradicated. It would be several days, possibly even weeks, until they could both put the terror and dread and shakiness behind them.
Now, he pulled back, but only so far that she could look into his eyes and hopefully see the burning truth there. “I spoke without thinking, and I’m sorry for that. It was stupid of me. But that’s exactly what you do to me; you drive me completely crazy and you make me stupid and you infuriate me because you keep treating yourself like you’re expendable when you’re the best fucking part of my life.”
Steve straightened after a long moment, hesitating as he looked at her. Toni just wasn’t ready to take him on again, and in a move she could admit was cowardly, she reached a hand to Peter, pasting on a fake, cheery smile.
Except that she had her eyes rooted to the television, knuckles whitening where they were gripping the handle of her mug, because apparently the child Toni had saved was safe… and quite possibly at a cost that Nat didn’t want to think about paying.
But that was beside the point. “Bring me your tablet,” he instructed, grateful that he’d gotten all of the employees of Steve’s “security firm” the kind of tech that came standard with his own interface software. He was still mad at Barnes, but he would be stupid to turn down help at getting Steve out without injury. “I’ll sync the frequency of the tracker in the gauntlet to your tablet, so you’ll know where I am within ten feet at all times.”
Likely hearing the change in his voice, Tony dipped his head, this time simply touching his forehead to Steve’s. For a second, they stayed like that, suspended in an existence that was theirs alone.
“I have you,” Toni breathed back, lips lifting in a wan smile despite the pain. “If I’m not okay, I’ll reach out my hand, you’ll take it, and everything will be okay.”
Her hand found his blindly, and Steve snapped out of his desolation when she squeezed it. “I reached out my hand… and you were there to take it,” Toni told him, voice achingly weak and breathless, but crystal clear. Love edged away the worst of the dullness in her eyes.
The best and the worst feeling in the world… that sounded about right. Only Steve hadn’t known, not when he’d been close to broken at the sight of an injured Iron Man, or when he’d been metaphorically knocked off his feet by a tuxedo-clad Tony Stark.
Also, for interest's sake, the quote Toni is thinking of, is "Above all, don't lie to yourself. The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to a point that he cannot distinguish the truth within him, or around him." - Fyodor Dostoyevsky.
came the small sniffle, and the address simultaneously broke and warmed Toni’s heart. She’d never realized just how much she would love being called that, not until two years ago when she’d stopped fighting the perception Peter had of her, but she’d also never anticipated the kind of heartbreak that came from being unable to give her son exactly what he needed in that moment; herself.
And seen, after several hours and a battle against tears, the opening she’d have given the man to attack her king. The weak spot. The game would’ve been over in six moves, possibly less.
And there was a lot that needed fixing, especially if Toni thought for one minute that she was anything like the twisted man her father had let himself become.
In a moment of courage, probably brought on by their solitude and the bubble that always wrapped around him when he was alone with Tony, Steve managed to ask, “What I really meant was, why did you get out of the suit
With slow movements to telegraph his intentions, Steve gently tugged her hand away, trying to tell her with earnest and regretful blue eyes that she had nothing to feel ashamed about, that he was so sorry for letting any harm come to her, least of all from her own father. The guilt weighed heavy on him, blurring the chatter that filled the air between them as Peter talk about ice cream flavours, and not for the first time, he wondered how he had never realized what his lover’s childhood had really been like.
Tony was a genius. It was just a matter of fact. That amount of data processing was barely a flex of his brain capacity, barely a hint of what he was capable of if motivated.
. “I’m so sorry, Tony. I’m so sorry for what I said. You have to know that I didn’t mean a single word of it.”
Steve nodded, and when he looked up at her again, those tears had fallen down his cheeks. “He is a horrible man,” he agreed, but with the intensity of his gaze upon her, Toni knew that his words were directed at her. “I just didn’t know. I didn’t know.”
As tempting as it was to give voice to that thought, Steve knew it would have to wait. A proper apology was still in order; or rather, the confirmation of Tony’s acceptance of his apology, Steve didn’t want to just assume; and he still had to take the man on a real date. He had to
“I’m not actually sure where she is,” Peggy admitted, when a lull in their conversation prompted him to ask where the genius was. “I haven’t seen her since we got back to base. I’d assumed she was laying low to keep tabs on the prototype she sent in.”
Fury barely batted an eyelid at her nickname for him, closing the distance between them with single-minded determination. Toni wanted to huff a sigh when Coulson sent the elevator back up without them, but she settled for fixing an impatient look on the SHIELD Director.
Honestly, if Mjolnir hadn’t been a hammer of the magical variety that had somehow known not to crash through walls while a tiny, living human was attached to it, Toni might have actually been the first person to kill a God. With her bare hands. As it were, Peter had been fine – completely thrilled with himself, in fact – and Thor had gotten off lightly with a three-month ban on poptarts and Steve kicking his ass while sparring hand-to-hand every day for two weeks.
“Shut up, Steve,” Tony mumbled into his mouth, kissing the apology away, eyes tellingly damp as he trembled slightly in Steve’s arms. “You got me, now.”
“Shouldn’t you be in bed right now?” Tony drawled, raising a condescending eyebrow. “Kids need a solid eight hours if they want to function at their best in school.”
oh, baby,” Steve murmured, aghast, as the harsh light of day brought all Toni’s injuries into sharp and devastating focus. Rhodes and Bucky began to take the harness off them, but Steve couldn’t focus on anything except the state of his girlfriend. A horrific looking gash had coated her arm and side in blood, and a nasty looking knot on the back of her head hinted at a concussion. Bruises decorated her body like a toddler had splashed paint with her body as the canvas. As if being trapped and having to crawl her way out wasn’t bad enough, she’d had to do it like this?
of your problems, Stark.” Red coated the edges of his vision and he wanted nothing more than to beat the man in front of him into a bloody pulp; not least of all for the last straw, which was his slight towards Peter, but for the beautiful woman who he was so in love with, who he now realized had been hurt unforgivably by a man who Steve had been stupid enough to call his friend.
With painstakingly slow, but almost soundless movements, Tony inched the blindfold off his head. Patience was never his strong suit, but then he’d been in situations like this before and knew all too well the value of it, so he forced himself to lock down every other urge. Steve’s life was at stake here, and that was way more important than lashing out and appeasing the temper was still simmering on a low boil since he’d first stormed out of the study earlier in the afternoon.
“He never listened,” Man-Child mumbled softly, and the desolation in his voice was enough for the super soldier to circle back to feeling compassionate. “When I said I wanted to be a scientist, that I wanted a different life… nobody ever listened.”
Toni hummed in contentment as Steve kissed her, lazy but thorough, with just a hint of the possessiveness that he sometimes got when he was feeling particularly territorial of her.
There was going to be moments in the near future; of this she had no doubt; when she would be recuperating in her workshop, or her office, or the sitting room on her and Steve and Peter’s floor, and the air shafts would creak tellingly as the archer kept a silent and subtle eye on her to make sure that she was okay and safe, and then there would be moments still when she would find him on the roof at odd hours because he was anxious about something happening to her or one of the rest of the team like that again, but all of that would happen without the captive audience they had at the moment. Clint tended to play his cards as close to the chest as Toni herself did, which was why that mutual understanding existed between them in the first place.
Bucky was growing tired of listening to him complain and agonize about what the right move to make was, so as their misfit group of soldiers were waiting for their ride back to base after another successful obliteration of one of Schmidt’s camps, Steve decided to engage the other person who he considered as close a friend as Bucky or Toni.
The one that stuck in his head the most; the one that he still wasn’t entirely sure he’d forgiven himself for; was of course the time that Howard Stark had crash-landed into their century. Steve still remembered with no small amount of self-recrimination, how he’d greeted the man like the long-lost friend he’d thought him to be. Invited him into their home. Defended him against the one person in the world whose side he should never have had to even think about taking. Steve wasn’t one to cuss excessively, if only because of Peter, but he’d fucked everything up so badly in those two days that he was still surprised Toni had forgiven him.
Rhodey thought to himself, steeling his heart against the sickening image of his pseudo little sister, hurt and scared and reaching out for help. Then, as he did at any time that he needed a bolstering of determination, he reminded himself of the motto he’d appropriated from Toni herself.
Steve’s attention was solely on his genius. “Really? Here I was thinking I was being romantic,” he teased back softly, finding his feet with their normal banter.
His throat was being clogged by his thundering heart, and Steve had to blink twice to clear suddenly tunneled vision. “Pepper,
Toni was furious, he could see that much, and later, he would probably be able to exercise some hindsight and see that the anger was on
Steve loved that he had the ability to render this silver-tongued man almost speechless, but what he loved even more, was hearing Tony moan his name. He’d only had about thirty dozen fantasies imagining just what it would sound like, just what it would feel like, and now that he had it right in front of him, Steve realized that his mind could have never done it justice.
As the fabrication started, he flicked the hologram away and pulled up another one, this time a design for a compact gun that fired a truly ridiculous number of rounds per cartridge, and had miniaturized explosives embedded in the bullets that detonated upon impact for maximum injury. They weren’t as intricate as the repulsor tech, so he’d probably have time to fabricate at least six rounds, and if he could add a self-destruct component to the gun itself…
“I was off the grid until I came to the Tower,” Steve explained numbly, and though he knew it was irrational, he couldn’t help feeling guilty. If he’d known, he’d have never let her face that alone, even back then when they had been on such rocky terrain.
It was times like this that Toni was most aware of how much she’d opened up since Steve had burst his way into her life. Before, the very idea of leaning on someone who wasn’t Rhodey or Pepper was inconceivable; who else was there in the world that she could trust like them?
After putting Peter to bed, Toni had been at a loss on what to do with herself. She hadn’t felt focused enough to work, and she still hadn’t been ready to face Steve, so she’d spent the night downstairs in her office, rarely visited except on days when she had a meeting or paperwork that Pepper wasn’t inclined to sort through for her. Getting a jump on the financials of a deal that SI was touting, because that qualified as mindless work for a genius, Toni had remained in her office until she was completely certain that all the legwork was done for this deal to go through. Pepper would be beyond surprised, since the meeting with the board was set for two weeks from now, but that was just a side bonus. The real drawcard, was the fact that it had kept her busy until the sun rose.
As Shellhead took off into the sky, Steve wondered one more time just what the relationship between Toni and the soldier was.
“Well, then… if no one minds, I’ll be tucking my son in, now,” she announced quietly, too many emotions fighting for dominance inside her, to be fussed about making some kind of witty comment or reply. Before anyone could stop her, she slipped the sling off her arm.
Quite literally. The Winter Soldier programming in him was dormant for the most part, but all too happy to take the proverbial driver’s seat when the skillset was necessary for protecting his family.
They made the rest of their ascent in mutual silence, both simply relishing being in each other’s arms when they’d feared, for the better part of almost 27 hours, that they would never feel it again. The only break in the quiet was from the periodic sounds of Steve kissing Toni’s hair, her forehead, her temple; basically anything he could reach; to assure himself that she was safe and back in his arms.
Instead, it had been the feelings that had begun to invade his life for the genius he’d only known as a friend. At the time, he’d been convinced that she would never give him the time of day, and by holding on to the little novelty button, he’d have a small part of her, at least. After they’d gotten together, Toni had found it among his things, and even when she’d shaken her head and called him a sap, those brown eyes had sparkled when his response was simply to tuck it back into the pocket of his uniform. By then, it was his, and he’d grown used to carrying around a piece of his whole world with him.
Tony didn’t startle as Barnes’ voice materialized behind him, but it was a near thing. “Gun,” he answered shortly, not ready to let go of his anger at the other man.
Steve felt like the breath had been sucker-punched out of him, and in that moment, he realized that he’d still been half-expecting Toni to raise an eyebrow at him and shoot the theory down with some sarcastic comment and that laugh he so enjoyed hearing.
Tony didn’t even turn towards the ex-Sergeant. “If you’re looking for an emotional heart-to-heart, go call up your ex-girlfriend or something,” he snapped, flicking the completed gun design towards the fabricators almost viciously. “I have neither the time nor the inclination to it.”
He’d never had much of a military kink before, so why was his stomach curling in a very familiar way?
A bitter taste hit the back of her throat and she jerked back, unresponsive. All the emotions of the past few minutes crashed spectacularly around her and even if she’d wanted to, Toni couldn’t find the words.
Thor had walked without thinking as he reminisced, but he was unsurprised to find himself back at the very same spot he’d been with Toni all those years ago. Their team had become a family since then and just as she’d predicted, Thor was making headway in finding that with Loki again, not entirely without Toni’s frequent guidance and listening ear. There were times, Thor knew, in which his brother himself had sought out the counsel of the Woman of Iron, and whatever it was that they spoke about, it was helping tremendously to repair the fractured relationship that existed between him and the Trickster God.
Toni reacted instinctively, throwing herself over Maico and ordering JARVIS to open up the suit as rubble began to fall around them. Broken pieces of concrete and stone and metal was filling their little air bubble, destroying it, and she could only vaguely be aware of it when the little boy erupted into a crying jag. He clung to her, limiting her maneuverability, but through some miraculous feat, Toni managed to turn them around so she could put him in the suit.
Toni felt her stomach sink as comprehension brought horror dawning on Steve’s face. Perhaps it would have been too much to hope for, that he would poke a hole in her theory. Instead, she sat in front of the screen as Steve barked out orders to the rest of the team over his shoulder, grimly mute.
Now, two days had passed since, and Tony was still on lockdown in his lab. It was the longest that Steve had ever gone not talking or seeing him since they’d become friends and the knowledge tore at him; ached like a slow-acting poison; but the sad truth was that he knew he deserved nothing less.
She would have complained – loudly and colorfully – if not for the rumbling growl that built up in Steve’s chest as he lifted his head long enough to glare at his phone. The sound made her giggle, since she was usually the one with next to no sexual restraint, and she found it in herself to pull away with one last kiss when the phone didn’t show any signs of quietening.
“I’m fine, honey,” she replied, setting him down distractedly in order to rearrange her clothes. It was going to be a hell of a feat keeping this from Steve, especially since she couldn’t blame it on an accident, thanks to Peter’s untimely presence.
Tony seemed to have no such reservation. “Ryan Coleman.” The genius laughed, happy and unrestrained in a way that was usually reserved for Steve. “Well, fuck me. Of all the sidewalks on all the streets in all the world.”
He prepped her slowly, languidly, fingering her through a first orgasm and then a second before he couldn’t stand dragging it out any longer. He hushed Toni’s mindless protests with a kiss when he finally pulled his fingers out of her, leaving only long enough for grab protection (he was a boy scout, so sue him) before he was back and easing himself into her tight heat. He went as slow as she needed, not wanting for a second to cause her any more pain than necessary, and it was worth it when, a few beats after bottoming out, she rocked up against him purposefully.
“I can’t lose you,” he growled, sounding wrecked when he forced himself to pull away. “I won’t handle that. I wouldn’t want to.”
It was what he’d come to dub the fake, public persona smile that often graced his lover’s face when she was dealing with the press, or some particularly annoying stakeholders who she wasn’t allowed to upset. It was the smile that let him know something deeper was going on under the surface, something that she had usually never hesitated to tell him about, not since they’d made love for the first time.
Toni’s voice was raw and ragged, as if she’d run a mile and a half with a knife stuck in her side, and fear swarmed Steve’s senses. “Toni?” he demanded, jerking forward and stopping short as if he’d just realized the motion wouldn’t take him where he needed to be. With his girlfriend. “What happened, baby, what’s wrong?”
“Love you, buddy.” Steve waited until Bucky had disconnected the call before he dropped his head into his hands, giving himself a brief moment to get composed. All the ex-HYDRA assassin did was grip his shoulder in silent support for a few seconds before leaving, presumably to get back to piloting the jet. Autopilot was something both super soldiers were still a little leery about.
Grinning back, Rhodes dipped his head and kissed her forehead before retreating. “I’ll think about it,” he promised, and winked at her as he tapped the homing bracelet she’d added to his recent upgrade on the armor. On cue, his armor landed behind him before gently encasing him within it. It made something melancholy pang inside Toni, for the armor she’d had to scavenge, and she made a mental note to make sure all the pieces were collected and sent back to her workshop. It wouldn’t do for that technology to be in anyone else’s hands.
Uncle Loki smiled slightly, looking softer than he normally looked. “I won’t tell,” he promised solemnly.
Before he could douse himself in some irrational self-recrimination, Steve was distracted by his lover tapping his chest. “
“Uh-oh.” Toni made a face, trying to elicit a smile from Steve and bring him back from whatever he had heard with his superior senses that had incited his temper. “Are you going to give them the “Captain America Is Disappointed In You” dressing down, or the “Captain America Is Going To Strike You Down” tirade?”
“I wouldn’t worry about that, Cap,” Toni eventually answered, finally looking at him, and even though her eyes were guarded, there was a measure of pleased approval in her face that told him she was still on his side. It meant more to Steve than he wanted to acknowledge. “Carter and I tend to wreak havoc at the lab just for the sake of a laugh.”
A jerk of his wrist ripped her shirt all the way down the front, buttons popping noisily but without much resistance. A gasp caught in her throat at the action, making Steve grin in wolfish satisfaction, but it was nothing compared to finally getting a chance to look at her like this. “Christ, Toni,” he husked, drinking in the sight of her and wondering if he would ever see a more gorgeous thing in his life. “You’re so goddamn beautiful, sweetheart.”
Shooting her gaze up to him, she saw that his eyes were glittering suspiciously as well, but above all, there was that depth of understanding that Steve had always had.
Toni leaned her head briefly against her arm, and even without the flashlight, Steve would have heard the hitching breath she tried to swallow from miles away. He shared in her dizzying relief, both of them connected in that moment by the sheer force thereof.
Something, Steve realized in a moment of fleeting insight, Toni shared with his mother. She fixed things.
she replied, and Steve heard the slightest hitch in her tone that she tried to mask from them. He’d known, on some deep and intrinsic level, that she’d been playing it down when she denied being badly hurt, but he hoped to God that it wasn’t as bad as his mind was suggesting. From what he could see, extraction wasn’t going to be a simple process, and certainly not a quick one.
“Don’t you ever say that to me again, doll,” he told her roughly, a hint of Brooklyn creeping into his voice as he leaned down to press his forehead against hers. “Don’t you
This was no time for him to fall apart. He had to plan, he had to figure out how he was going to save Steve, there were only three hours to strategize before he had to go to, presumably, Carbonell Tech…
Oblivious to Steve’s mounting displeasure, Tony’s eyes were affixed to Coleman. “I heard you got the bump to LT not too long ago,” he said, pride lifting his voice as well. “I remember when all you wanted was to get your detective’s badge. You’ve come a long way, Ry.”
“Shh, sweetheart, I got you,” Steve rumbled soothingly, soft adoration taking the place of mindless desire for a brief second as Tony relaxed pliantly against him at the reassurance, all wonderfully trusting and willing. Raw need burnt it away again as Steve finally moved his hand underneath Tony’s boxers and gripped his hard length in his hand. He all but purred as Tony cried out with the contact, hips stuttering, trying to follow the movement as Steve languidly stroked him. “Feel good, darlin’?” he husked softly. “This what’cha need? Need my hand on ya?” As he spoke, he increased the speed of his stroking incrementally, and pressed sporadic kisses to whatever skin he could reach.
So distracted was he by his residual concern, that Steve had nearly exited her tent before realizing that there
He laughed shakily, remembering a shared conversation a long time ago, back when he’d known what he was waiting for… only he hadn’t known that exactly the right partner was the person he’d thought he’d hated.
lucky,” her lover replied somberly, the fear causing darkness to creep over his expression. “And you
“If you stop, Steve,” Toni enunciated slowly, brown eyes blown almost black with lust, “then I am relatively certain I might actually combust from sheer desire alone. I am
“Go,” she shooed him away weakly, dragging the quilt at the end of her bed up to cover her knees. “I’ll wait. Don’t worry.”
Bucky cleared his throat a little as he pulled away, blue eyes serious and somber. “Thank her again for me, would ya? For the save.”
That, though, was apparently good enough for their young charge, because Peter nodded in approval at the words, immediately relaxing from his stern stance. He threw his arms around Steve and giggled as the super soldier crushed him to his chest.
Her suit had a built-in oxygen supply and air filtration system, so in theory, she was better off than the kid would soon be. In practice, however, Toni was fairly certain that she could persuade Maico into the suit, and that would greatly increase the kid’s chance of survival.
He saw Toni the next morning before the serum was scheduled to be tested on him, but before he could make a move to greet her, test the waters or something, he was intercepted by Dr. Erskine. The doctor had him out of his shirt and on to a table in a flurry of words, and just when he thought that he was being given a break as the scientist called out for Stark, he found out that the Stark in question was instead the senior one; all flashy and bold as the flying car he’d flaunted as his expo.
Predictably, Tony flinched almost imperceptibly, but like he always did, he soldiered on. “Come on, kid,” he encouraged softly, and Steve mused absently on how Tony’s words were as much of a weapon as his suit. “You can learn from everyone else’s mistakes. You’re young, and I know that you don’t actually want to hurt anyone.” He paused a beat, then added, “Sometimes, what’s left behind can grow back better than the generation before it… if given the chance.”
“It worked, it really did!” Daddy had come home the very next day, and that night, him and Mommy had sat him down and asked him if he was okay with being adopted by them. Once he understood what adopted was, Peter had realized that his wish had come true, and he’d been so happy. Except… “Can I tell you a secret?” he asked Uncle Loki, with no small amount of sheepishness.
They sat in silence until Bruce tied off his last stitch, and without needing to be asked, the scientist quietly excused himself after pressing a gentle kiss to Toni’s cheek. Rhodey waited until Bruce was out of earshot before he spoke, but Toni wasn’t sure whether that was intentional, or incidental while the military man regained composure. She was leaning towards the former, until she heard the shaky inhalation from Rhodey that spoke of his own fear since he’d heard about her predicament.
Steve had redefined his understanding of fear the moment Toni’s gasp had been cut off from the comms, and everything went to shit around him.
Swallowing twice, she worked on finding her voice. “Hey,” was all she eventually managed, thanks in equal part to her physical inability to take a full breath, as well as her residual anxiety from the threat of flashbacks.
“Look, I can’t stay on here for very long,” she pointed out before the quiet even had a chance to become oppressive. “JARVIS is running on backup power; so I’m going to have to spare enough energy for him to try to pinpoint our location, and still connect to the comms when you guys land again. I’ll be in contact soon.” Because the only things that needed to be said now, were between her and Steve, Toni quietly instructed JARVIS to open up a separate, private comm line between them. “Steve?”
As if she’d been waiting for just that, Toni tumbled headlong into the abyss with a sharp cry of his name. Her vision blazed white and her nerve endings sizzled, and it had long ago stopped surprising her that every orgasm was as powerful as the last, with Steve.
And he only realized it when Nat had approached him, a familiar grim look in place that was equally unfamiliar in their home, and told him what had transpired in the time that he’d foolishly taken to sleep.
James Buchanan Barnes could safely say that he had absolutely no clue how he’d gone from being the Winter Soldier; an isolated HYDRA assassin elite who was fear personified; to an Avenger; a do-gooding teammate who had little kids dressing up as him on Halloween.
“What about you?” Steve reached out for her as soon as she was in reach; tucked her close against his body. “Coming to bed tonight, or are we going back to the workshop?”
He stopped in the doorway to Peter’s room, watching with a fond smile as Toni tucked a half-asleep Peter into bed.
Steve knew; of course he knew; there was only one thing that Bucky meant when he got that wolfish grin and winked at Steve. What he wasn’t entirely too clear on, was why he suddenly felt the need to slam Bucky into the bar and warn him to back off from the genius.
She nodded once, starting to turn away before stopping and pinning an intense look on him. “I know that she might sometimes be a handful, Captain Rogers,” Peggy stated brusquely. “She’s reckless and impulsive and jumps into things without thinking whenever her heart is on the line. But she’s the most brilliant and kindest person I’ve ever had the good fortune to meet and I’m entirely fond of her.” Now, the agent’s smile turned razor sharp. “Just something you should bear in mind.”
The blond patiently waited for the reprimand to see its natural conclusion, switching off because there was simply no chance that he was going to heed whatever Bucky was telling him. These sleepless nights with Tony was one of the best parts of this century, as weird as it might have sounded, and Steve wasn’t about to give them up for something as banal as sleep. Besides, he napped sometimes, didn’t he? That was good enough.
Peggy was great. Amazing, even. But she wasn’t the dame that he never stopped talking about, or thinking of.
While she was doing so, Steve spared a glance over his shoulder at the statue of the woman he’d never had the honour of meeting, but who he was suddenly a whole lot more grateful to.
Because she knew he would hesitate, scared of hurting her, Toni took the initiative and gently tugged on Steve’s wrist until her lover removed his hand from her underwear. Showing off her regained flexibility, Toni rolled herself to lie on top of him. Steve grinned in approval, bright and easy like it hadn’t been for a while, and Toni felt warmth encapsulate her entire body at the sight. It was all she needed to drive out any residual cold that she still carried from her harrowing brush with Mother Nature.
In the end, all it took to bring Captain Steven Grant Rogers to his knees, was a goddamn phone call.
Before he could ask the man to spit out whatever it was he so obviously wanted to say, Toni piped up. “Nobody likes a naysayer, Dad.” Suddenly, she was there in his line of sight as well, and despite the rocky footing they’d started on upon introduction, Steve found himself relaxing with her presence. “I double and triple checked the numbers myself; it’s going to work,” she told him confidently, but her posture was all wrong. Her arms were crossed and her chin was tilted slightly and she was stiff and defensive in a way that Steve had never seen; in a way that reminded him of the stance he took when he faced off against bullies in back alleys. Before he could wonder if the comparison had more merit to it than he thought, she turned to him and smiled. It wasn’t like the other razor-edged smirks she usually sent his way; this one was bright and excited, eyes sparkling and face brightening, and it transformed her into the kind of sight that made people stop what they were doing just so they’d get a chance to stare and sigh.
Rhodey, sensitive to Toni’s express desire to keep her vulnerable moments out of the public eye, never usually approached her for this kind of talk while she was still in relative range of the vultures. It stood to reason to her that, in this instance, it was unavoidable because he wouldn’t be able to accompany her back to the tower, where they could have hashed this out a lot more animatedly in her workshop or somewhere equally secured.
As it were, she had plenty of warning as Thor stepped out into the hallway of their floor, looking far removed from his usual cheery self. For the first time since she’d known him, Thor looked like some of his real age was showing, stress and worry and dejection and helplessness all chipping away at what sometimes seemed like eternal youthfulness. His eyes were dulled and his posture imbued with the weight of powerlessness until those strong shoulders seemed almost slumped.
Forcing himself to push past the pain, Tony realized three things; the first was that the weird voice guy – christened temporarily as Slime Man – was talking again, and telling Steve that this was just the beginning of what he was going to watch them do to “The Captain’s little pet”. And okay, rude.
For the first time since his birthday; since that disastrous moment when he’d opened Tony’s gift and realized just how badly he’d screwed up; Steve felt like drawing. Because this man in front of him, this man who’d allowed him to love him, was the greatest type of muse that the super soldier had ever had; or would ever have, if his gut instinct was correct. His beauty was something that shone all the way through, and Steve was sure that if he just had the chance to look his fill, he would see all the most magnificent beauties that the world could ever hope to offer him.
She tipped his head up with a finger until he looked at her, and not at the gruesome looking collage of black stitches, pale skin and residual blood. “Barely a scratch, honey,” she lied smoothly, and grinned to add credence to the falsehood. “But I’ll feel a lot better if I get a proper look at that smile…” she trailed off, before tickling him gently. Predictably, Maico squirmed on her lap and shrieked with laughter, and it was only a wealth of experience doing this with Peter when he was sad, that allowed Toni to maneuver herself so that her ribs and arm didn’t get jostled too badly.
His thoughts were derailed as Steve claimed his lips in another kiss, this one deeper and with an edge to it that Tony easily identified as possessiveness. It wasn’t a rare thing for Steve to stake his claim, especially with all the investors Tony constantly had to charm and sweet-talk, but there was a desperation to the moment that spoke volumes more about Steve’s fear than the blond himself would.
Lurching unsteadily to his feet, because he needed to move or he was going to be sick, Tony forced his words out from numb lips. “Steve’s in trouble?” he asked, although not expecting an answer as much as he was simply focusing his attention on what was important. “Steve’s… they, whoever’s got him, did they say what they wanted?”
Apologies were pretty much the only thing falling from her lips, interspersed ever so often with an endearment or a reminder of how much she loved him. Now that he was safe; now that she had nothing to lose herself in except her own perceived failures and shortcomings; Toni couldn’t quite believe that she’d gotten her wonderful, beautiful, amazing little boy into this mess. This was all her fault; she’d been an idiot to bring Peter into this world, into this life where she was so constantly under attack. What right did she had to put him through this? What had she been thinking?
At the time, his tiny size didn’t even factor into his brain, nor did he think to question why Colonel Phillips sounded so carefully measured as he shouted his warning. All he thought about was protecting everyone else, and with his first glance up to note whether there were other people there, he saw both Peggy Carter and – the surprise was a jolt to his system in itself – Toni Stark. Where the former backed away with his panicked shout, Stark didn’t. Instead, she kept coming forward, grabbing some rectangular metal box as she ran, hazel eyes scared but fierce and determined and even then, so goddamn
On the other hand, a little rutting was probably all he would need to get off as long as Tony kept making all those pretty noises just for him.
“Steve…” Toni choked out, and now there were tears in her eyes too, but he wasn’t finished yet. Not even close. Steve suddenly couldn’t imagine not telling Toni every single thing he’d wanted to tell her since the night he’d realized he was in love with his best friend; because God, how many times could he have nearly not had the opportunity again?
Toni nodded, her expression one of grim resolve. She had the look of a person who could change the world with the sheer force of her willpower alone; as though any cynic who told her no, could just watch and see as she made it happen.
Forcing himself to relax a little, because there was no point in lashing out when he could be thinking of a strategy to get Toni out safely, Steve forced himself to take a steadying breath. “S’okay,” he muttered, absently knuckling his chest. In some ways, he felt like he used to as a kid; steps away from having an asthma attack because he just couldn’t take a fucking breath. Not while he knew that the love of his life was possibly hurting, probably scared. “I just… I gotta focus on her right now. Gettin’ her outta there safely.”
Not that she hadn’t already almost done that. Twice, actually, she had nearly grabbed onto a rickety hand- or foot-hold and if it weren’t for the quick reflexes she’d been honing all her life, she’d have dropped all the way back down, probably burying herself alive in the process. It was only then that she’d realized how lucky she and Maico were to have landed in an air bubble or sorts; and only now that she realized how precarious her debris prison was.
Her boyfriend sighed on the other end of the comms and Toni could just imagine the agitated hand that was probably skating through his blond hair, spiking it up in the way it usually was when Steve got worried and kept repeating the motion.
Toni laughed loudly, shaking her head and pressing her palm to her cheek as it flushed a pretty, light pink. “
Steve hauled himself up and out of the crater he’d put in the rubble since he’d restarted, giving Bruce the space he needed to work and also giving himself a minute to take a breather. It went against his every instinct, but the strategist in him had been very vocal about making sure that he didn’t rush headfirst into this rescue like he did almost everything else. This was the very definition of a delicate operation, and Steve wouldn’t let anything – neither fault nor fatigue – jeopardize it.
Bucky, thankfully, didn’t notice, his entire attention on Toni. “What happened, Doll?” he asked softly, tracing gentle fingers over the marks that had Stark relaxing visibly. “Did those morons try to get back at you for the sparring thing?”
She wanted to fight with him. She wanted to yell and scream and rant and rave and get through to him just how much
In that moment, as he watched the grainy, haphazard footage shot from a cellphone by a man who deemed it more important to document suffering than help prevent it, he had never struggled so much to be Captain America over Steve Rogers. Because the screen was showing the love of his life shooting into a building mere moments before the entire structure crumbled, burying her underneath it.
When she was at the door, she paused, not looking at him but tilting her head as if she were about to. “Do you want to know what I told Phillips about you?”
When the need to breathe became too great for Toni, she pulled away breathlessly, but Steve just kept right on kissing her, making a trail from her lips, along her jaw, and then down her neck when she bared it to him. The gesture – so easy, so inviting for him – made the possessive part in Steve rumble happily, and just because he could, he scraped his teeth over the delicate skin and suckled, varying his pressure and only letting up when he was sure he had marked her with a love bite high enough for others to see.
Tony laughed, and where his eyes had been dimmed with badly concealed worry, they were now sparkling in delight. “It’s almost 3am,” he pointed out in amusement, even as he stood and threw his pencil on the desk, where a half-finished design lay abandoned. Almost immediately, DUM-E rolled to him with a series of happy whirs, making Tony roll his eyes affectionately before reaching out to pat the bot placatingly. “Where are we gonna find chocolate ice-cream with sprinkles?”
“It’s okay,” Peter graciously patted Steve on the back as he mumbled apologies over and over. “Mommy said you were confused. I understand, I don’t hate you. Just the horrible man.”
When you knew someone for as long as Jim had known Toni, it wasn’t difficult to spot the tiniest inflections and nuances in that person’s tone that told a complete story all its own. Case in point, right now, and that uneasy lilt to his best friend’s voice while she detailed her hopeful plan; it told Rhodey that there was something she wasn’t saying. Something that she was worried about, but didn’t want them to.
Steve laughed, a wet and trembling sound that could just as well have been a desperate mumbling of gratitude to every deity he could think of.
And then there was the love. That was something that was always present in his eyes when Steve looked at her, and something that Toni hoped would be present for the rest of their lives. Hoped that she could never do something to make that love absent when he looked upon her.
“And so good in bed,” Steve nodded agreeably, blue eyes sparkling with concealed mischief as she spluttered with laughter. One of the most rewarding things that she’d learned about in this relationship she’d fallen into, was Steve’s dry but undeniably quick humour. Most people thought it was spending time with her that was rubbing off on the clean-cut Boy Scout Captain America, but Toni knew the truth; buried underneath the public persona, there was an impish Brooklyn boy with a sharp wit who always gave as good as he got, and the serum hadn’t changed that inherent part of him.
He had no sooner felt himself begin to fall, a stretch too far away from the other side, before strong, cool arms encircled his waist and he was shooting upwards once again, away from the awful heat.
Distracted from his meditation techniques by the buzzing of his phone, Bruce sighed and checked the screen. It was a text from Natasha, and while that normally wouldn’t have distracted him when he was in the field and she wasn’t, this time, he had to factor in that the redhead was part of the Avengers who were on babysitting duty.
He carried her back to her tent and if anyone had seen or called out something to either of them, then Steve wouldn’t have known either way. By the time he laid her on the bed, Toni looked a lot more like herself, blessed color reentering her cheeks and awareness sharpening her eyes to hazel once more.
Trying to psych himself up internally, Steve walked back to the armor, feigning calm. He only hesitated for a split second before identifying himself.
So instead of cowering, Toni simply wound her good arm around Nat and pulled her into a hug. “No, you’re not,” she refuted sunnily. “You love Peter too much.”
The woman, Romanoff, seemed a little more reserved and a lot scarier, but she’d made a comment about how she’d told Steve to just come clean to Tony, so that put her firmly in Tony’s good graces.
Judging from the grin and chuckle from Bruce and Bucky respectively, Toni wasn’t on a private comm line with him, but none of that mattered to Steve because she was there, inexplicably and impossibly, and just the sound of her voice was enough to bring him back.
“Yes,” she laughed with a nod, eyes brightened with delight. “Exactly like a shield, Cap. Well, a shield that has the ability to level an enemy if they still decide to aim an attack at it.” At some point during her impassioned words, Toni had moved again, this time perching on the edge of the table nearer to where Steve’s chair was. Now, she pushed herself up onto it, letting her feet dangle as she made herself comfortable. “This the part where you tell me I’m delusional?” she asked lightly, but there was a real challenge in her words that made it clear she’d been shot down for her vision before. It made a flash of ire spark through Steve, the idea that someone as vibrant and passionate as Toni had ever been made to feel like she was wrong for daring to dream of a better world.
Steve listened attentively, nodding on occasion to show her that he was following. It was an odd sort of mesmerizing to see the fervor in her eyes as she spoke about her invention; the initial hint of pride, followed by the frustration at its perceived shortcomings, the determination that she held against risking soldiers on anything less than a sure thing. What shocked him the most, however, was her last comment, which Steve was half sure she hadn’t even intended on verbalizing aloud.
No. This couldn’t be happening, she was wrong. She had to be wrong. Nobody would be stupid enough – goddamn
Distantly, he was of course happy for them, but at the forefront of his moment was the leaden weight in his stomach that got heavier with every step he took towards the empty armor. He wasn’t even sure what he was hoping to find, but Rhodes seemed to share his idea, the armored man stepping forward with him while Bucky tried to coax Bruce into some semblance of control.
The words took all the hot wind from Steve’s sails. He slumped slightly in place and without his anger as a buffer, the pain and hurt and regret steamrolled him all at once.
so! You’re a horrible person and I hate you!” With that fierce proclamation, Peter rushed forward and landed a spectacularly aimed boot on Howard Stark’s shin.
Howard smiled at them, and while it might have looked charming on his daughter, Steve just thought that he looked smarmy. “Heard you two needed a ride?”
“There is a tradition in my family, to give this to a new mother,” she explained, and Toni had to listen carefully to the Spanish, lest she lose any of the explanation in translation. “This is a medallion of Saint Monica; she is said to be the patron saint of motherhood. I can think of none worthier of wielding the mother’s symbol than you, Toni Stark.”
Toni wondered how much he’d needed to psych himself up to ask that question. “Scrapes and bruises,” she lied easily, determinedly ignoring the bump at the back of her head still sluggishly bleeding and what she was pretty sure was cracked ribs. “Nothing life threatening.” That, at least, she was reasonably certain was the truth. “The kid is fine, too, I managed to get him to sleep.”
“As you can see from the very precise hole in your boss’s head, I don’t miss my targets,” he stated, voice cold and flat and chillingly dark. Even to his own ears, Tony sounded like a predator, and the look in his eyes, the unflinching stance, was telling of how little he would hesitate to pull the trigger again. “Wanna see if this fancy new repulsor tech melts the skin from your bones before you can get a shot off?”
“I keep repeating it,” Bruce sighed long-sufferingly as he continued towards them, “but I don’t think you hear me when I say that I’m
Jerking into action suddenly, he left his glass back on the table with a noisy clatter. “Are you… did you… you’re hurt?” he managed to demand, adrenaline-fueled panic surging through his previously tired self. As carefully as he could despite his concern, Steve took Toni by the elbow and looked her over for injury. He found it quickly, just below her left ribcage – a patch of her black blouse darkened with blood in a way that was easy to miss if it wasn’t being looked for – and sucked in a breath through his teeth when he realized how much blood she had to have lost. His mind helpfully provided the image of her jumping in front of Erskine when the shots had been fired, and damn it, he should have thought to check…
They still had a few hours, but Toni knew it was coming. It was like a looming wave just waiting to wipe them out.
“Hey, c’mon, now,” he protested around a laugh. “I really don’t like fighting. I just don’t like bullies more. I understand that there’s sometimes a need to fight, because other alternatives just don’t work. But,” he added, tipping his head at her, “I think your alternative just might.”
For the duration of their relationship, Tony had never felt less than immeasurably special, but that feeling of being cherished took on a whole new meaning for him in that moment.
Sufficiently distracted, Maico tilted his head to the side, considering her. “Are you someone’s mama?”
“I know a little something about legacy, you know,” Tony started conversationally, wrenching his eyes away from Steve and fixing them on Man-Child. Behind him, the armor shifted into sentry mode, but their captivated audience, thankfully, didn’t notice. An expression of pain darkened Tony’s face. “My old man, he rode me hard about it all my life. Legacy, the name, the image… it was everything.”
A laugh that sounded more like a sob escaped from the kid’s lips, and Tony held up a hand in the general direction of the rest of the team. Steve nodded, almost imperceptibly, supporting the inventor’s unspoken order not to take a shot at the kid. Tony was turning this around, somehow, and as far as he was concerned, if they had a chance to rehabilitate the kid, give him the second chance that not many others got? That was a win in Steve’s book.
Apparently it was a day meant for surprises, because Toni actually believed the man. He looked distinctly displeased, probably trying to reconcile the public persona Howard Stark he’d known, to the father of the year that Toni had grown up with.
he hastened to assure her, and Toni heard his footsteps as he began to walk, the low sobbing becoming louder with proximity and breaking her heart.
But if that guilt manifested like welts, Thor’s beaming smile when he saw her was definitely a salve; it was like watching the sun come out, which might have been an insult to the God of Thunder, but was a wholly accurate description and the best Toni could liken it to.
In a graceless tangle of limbs, they all made it back onto the relative solidness of the train, and Steve grabbed both Toni and Bucky in a hug, trembling with the force of his relief and excess adrenaline. Both of them clung right back, although Steve was pretty sure his girlfriend was holding back on account of her suit, but none of it mattered because they were both safe.
He had a point there. A person would have to be certifiable to waltz into the Black Widow’s bedroom in the middle of the night and alternately shake and urge her awake. “This is important,” Steve said instead of arguing, brow furrowing as he remembered the reason he’d woken Bucky up in the first place; a reason that was still making his stomach churn. “I was going to the workshop to sketch because I couldn’t sleep, and I knew Tony would be up, too, and I heard him talkin’ to someon-…”
“Gentlemen,” she greeted them cordially; devoid of emotion even as whimpers and sobs echoed out of the room from behind her. “Nat,” she added considerately, but Steve knew her voice; knew that face and her tone and those eyes, and knew that she was far from okay. “I’m not quite done, here.”
How else would one explain the unnatural disquiet from the normally exuberant young lad? Or the fact that he intermittently but frequently checked with Thor or Lady Natasha regarding the whereabouts of the Captain and Lady Stark when normally, he was content in their presence for longer than a few hours?
“I found out who my guardian angel is,” Peter admitted, flushed with happiness. “It’s my Mommy.” Before they’d asked him, Peter had heard Daddy asking Mommy how she had managed to get the adoption done so fast. He still couldn’t say that he understood all the words Mommy had used in her answer, but when he’d realized that she was the one who made it so he could stay, he reasoned the rest out for himself; if only his guardian angel could hear and grant his wish, then obviously Mommy was his guardian angel.
The silence was longer this time, and just when Steve thought that he wouldn’t get an answer, Tony spoke. “Things that were good became great, and things that were bad didn’t seem so terrible anymore.” His voice was sharp, almost curt, but at least Tony was speaking, and Steve wisely kept quiet in the hopes of hearing more. “Making them smile became more important to me than any project I’ve ever taken on, and the sound of their laugh made just about everything feel good and right again. I tried at things that I normally didn’t care about.”
The soldier didn’t dare to look away, and when the scientist tapped his heart, an unspoken message as clear as day in the gesture, Steve knew without asking, all that he was saying.
“You still with me, sweetheart?” she asked the little boy gently, rubbing his back in soothing circles the same way she did with her own charge when he had a nightmare or got sick. Like Peter, the little boy scooted impossibly closer, as if he could hide from everything if he just snuggled close enough, and nodded mutely.
It hurt Steve to see her uncertainty, as out of place on Toni as the look of vulnerability she was wearing in that moment, but in a small way, he also felt incredibly gratified to see that she was comfortable enough to show him what he was sure few, if any people had ever seen before. An honor though it was, however, he wanted nothing more than to soothe the look away.
While Clint may have been the one to teach her that love was not simply a tool for the weak and powerless, it had been Toni who had taught her how to accept that love and love back.
Tony winced at his question and raised ravaged hazel eyes to his. “Bucky called me. Told me that you had a bit of a blow up at the team, and…”
Tony looked flabbergasted and a little pale, and when he made to move his hand away, Steve just caught it in his own instead. Intertwined their fingers like he was never going to let go. Hoping that he could say something, anything, so he wouldn’t have to.
“Look, I think that I… I haven’t really been… I was wrong about you,” Barnes finally managed to blurt out, and Tony knew without looking that there would be a look of genuine remorse on his features. For all that they’d never gotten along, Tony had always appreciated the man’s blunt nature, and Bucky never said anything that he didn’t absolutely mean. But where Tony might have considered the chance to find common ground with Barnes any other time, it hardly mattered to him right now, in his anger.
If Bruce noticed anything amiss, he didn’t say so; only finished stitching her up skillfully and quickly while Rhodey took up the seat he’d vacated. Toni rested her head automatically against her best friend’s shoulder and Rhodes responded by wrapping an arm carefully around her.
Focusing on his face, and on Steve’s, and on the rest of their family’s faces, she hauled herself up one more perch.
It had been dropped there the instant that he’d seen Toni hunched over at her mother’s dedication plaque, and it had only gotten progressively heavier at the sight of her red-rimmed eyes, and then her heartbreaking train of thought, which had made Steve thrill for a moment, when Toni had called Peter her son for the second time, but then had come with the realization that she thought herself no better than that
“You got yourself out of there,” he reminded her, and Toni wasn’t sure whether it was for her benefit or his. Possibly both. “You’re safe, now.”
It was those words that did it, triggering his possessive side like a switch, and Steve wasted no time in setting up a punishing rhythm, taking Toni fast and deep so that she would feel the twinges the next morning and remember that he’d been there.
She’d clip him over the head if he ever gave voice to the sentiment, but Bucky owed Toni more than he thought he could ever really repay.
As soon as the thought materialized in his head, he knew that he had to tell her the words, not just think them. He had screwed things up in the worst way, he hadn’t
Cheers filled the air around them as the trio landed as close to the rest of the rescued platoon as the armored soldier could manage. They couldn’t celebrate for long, though; not when Steve realized that his transponder had a bullet hole in it and the suit’s battery was too low to make a connect without also becoming a veritable coffin for the man inside it.
Through nothing else but a sheer force of will, Toni refrained from smiling, not wanting to spoil what sounded like a surprise. The door shut with a barely audible
Steve halted his internal monologue of cussing out his oldest friend, shifting into a slightly defensive stance as he turned with Tony towards the new voice. Blue eyes narrowed as Steve locked on to a man who was about his height, muscled and toned and a little rough looking with his leather jacket and ripped jeans and close-cropped black hair. Green eyes that looked almost emerald danced with happiness as the man looked upon Tony, and it immediately put Steve’s back up.
Rather than Bruce, it was the AI who responded, voice kind. “Indeed, Sergeant Barnes, however I am most generally the vessel with which Miss Stark conducts the calculations.”
“I wouldn’t have stopped until I did,” he confirmed lowly, and maybe Toni also hadn’t realized just how much she’d treasure the promise, because warmth almost bowled her over with it. “But please… please try not to scare me like that again,” he entreated, so openly vulnerable that Toni felt as if he’d reached into her chest and squeezed her heart in his fist. “I know you can’t promise me anything,” he added, before she could figure out how to meet his words, “but please just tell me that you’ll always fight back. I need you to always fight back.”
So with muscles screaming and head splitting and every inch of her body begging for her to let go, Toni held on. She held on tight, because there simply was no other option but to drag herself, inch by bloody inch, back to home. Back to family. She’d once promised herself that she would never let her son down, and she would be damned if she broke that promise now. If she broke any of her promises, now, including the one that she’d made to him before sending Maico up.
“I always knew what I wanted,” the man stated almost arrogantly, and Steve had to resist the impulse to pull Tony behind him when Cole stepped closer. “I still do, actually. What are you doing tomorrow night?”
Unable to bear the sight any longer, he dropped his forehead against hers again, waiting for her eyes to close before he also shut his. Swallowing hard, he finished in a rough voice, “And
Toni froze at the familiar sound of her father’s voice, willing herself desperately not to react like the same heartbroken little girl she remembered herself being, who’d kept trying to reach out to a father who’d only looked upon her with disgust.
“Oh, honey.” Laura’s voice, even over the phone, brimmed over with a mixture of fear, sympathy, pain and worry. “I just saw the news. What’s the update? Is she alright?”
After a choking swallow, he managed some semblance of words. “Pepper, is she… what did… do you know?” His voice was hoarse, as though he’d spent an entire night screaming his throat raw, which didn’t feel like an inaccurate prediction for the future if the unthinkable would come to pass.
“It’s okay, honey, it’s alright,” she tried to reassure him, desperation edging her voice. Abruptly, she remembered that he didn’t speak English, and almost threw her hands up in exasperation because it had been literal years since she’d forgotten to switch to someone else’s native tongue when talking to them. Maico screamed when a sizeable piece of concrete smashed dangerously close to them and Toni hastily forced her mind to provide the translations of what she was trying to say. “Everything’s going to be okay, little one,” she said firmly in rapid fire Spanish, fighting to maintain gentleness instead of snapping out orders like she would have with an adult. “I need you to go into here for me, okay? It’s my superhero suit, it will protect you.”
“Old flame, I think, would be the more accurate description,” Coleman grinned as he playfully leered at Tony. It raised Steve’s hackles, but there was nothing much he could do about it since Tony, the traitor, was laughing about it. “We used to go out, back when I was a rookie and worked reasonable hours, and this one wasn’t moonlighting as a superhero.”
Hope burst through his chest as he whirled around to see the suit, banged and dented and more than a little damaged, but functional. As it began a very slow and careful descent to the ground, Steve distantly heard flashes going off from what seemed like a thousand cameras at once, and the voices of reporters.
Pushing down the nauseating feeling in his gut that had amplified with Toni’s veiled plea for them to get her out of there, Rhodes focused on the game plan. “For those of us who weren’t invited to the sick-kid- playdate, what the hell is Pick-Up-Sticks?”
By the time they got to Peter’s room, Toni’s arm and ribs were in agony and she knew her face had dipped to ashen somewhere along the way. The tenacity, grit and determination of a Stark was a potent thing, however, and she showed no signs of reneging on her convictions; instead, Toni just forced herself to stop leaning on Steve. That would be as damning as removing the jacket to display her variety of bruises, cuts, bandages and sutures.
Sure enough, in the weeks following the incident, Toni had pulled away from him just a little. Not enough that it was blatantly obvious; they still talked for hours on end and she still prioritized his team when it came to her weapons and equipment upgrades and designs; but she held herself back just slightly in a way that Steve hadn’t appreciated until she was no longer doing it. There were no more light squeezes of her fingers around his forearm when he was stressed out and tense; no more arms thrown around his neck in sheer relief when he returned from a mission, or light, sassy rebukes that just barely hid the tremor in her voice when she knew, just somehow
enough to know that she wouldn’t have acted without cause, and honestly, people had broken up for far less. Was that going to happen to them? Would he lose her for this?
“Obviously not,” Howard nodded, and Steve’s temper cooled slightly until the man continued to speak. “If she’d been an experiment, she would not have been such a resounding failure.”
The demand was spoken in a serious tone that Clint rarely used, and it told Toni a lot about how him, and probably the rest of the team at home as well, was taking her predicament. She’d managed to reassure Steve, Rhodey, Bucky and Bruce, but it simply hadn’t occurred to her that the rest of her team could have done well to hear from her too.
An agent by the name of Clint Barton had been the first person to ever make her forget that irrefutable truth. It wasn’t, like she’d told others, because he’d saved her rather than eliminate her, per SHIELD’s suggestion. That decision had fostered a debt between them, that Natasha had yet to repay, but it had not fostered love.
“You’re starting to sound like her,” he pointed out wryly, riding out the customary spark of jealousy that assaulted him any time that the genius bestowed her attention on someone other than him. What was weird, though, was the fact that he spent so much time with Toni, but somehow never noticed her with any one soldier for a length of time long enough to get repairs and upgrades and testing done on the suit. She was being awfully discreet about that.
Without a word, Jim, Barnes, and Banner all followed suit, each of them working with renewed vigor and purpose. It was time to get their resident genius back.
Yet another mistake. Steve happened to know that Tony’s favourite food was authentic Italian, because it reminded him of the few times as a child that Maria Stark would cook, often letting a young Tony ‘help’ her. It formed a good memory for him, one of precious few, so if it was
“Really?” Tony’s eyes snapped to Steve’s, and the fire in them was his first clue that he’d put his foot in his mouth again. “If you’re asking me that, you must really have as low an opinion of me as I thought.”
For someone who had grown up alone, even surrounded by people, this new family meant more than the entire world to Natasha. She had a place here. A meaning and a belonging. It was beautiful and wonderful and nothing she’d ever experienced could compare to it.
Bucky, the little shit, only smiled, big and broad. “Fuck, it took you long enough,” he said cheerfully, holding his hand up for another drink and settling back on his stool. “It’s never a hardship for me to flirt with our resident girl genius, but I was startin’ to think that I’d have to propose to her before ya got your head outta your ass.”
For all that he knew his lover was awake, she didn’t move an inch, and the reason for that, he knew, was the recently-turned four year old that was almost quivering with excitement next to him.
“We’re not too far out,” Bucky reported, and Steve had to wonder how long his best friend had been standing there next to him. “Two hours, give or take. Those assholes musta underestimated how much power Toni puts in the engines of her toys.”
her. He hated everything Toni Stark seemed to personify; a bully who was so used to being an entitled, spoilt little princess that she treated everyone around her as though they were less, in some way, inferior to her simply because Daddy had always indulged her and made her think that she had any right to put herself above everyone else.
He’d kept to those resolutions as much as he’d been able to, over the years. He’d added to them too, of course, but the most important thing he’d learned from it all, was the standard by which to hold anyone who entered Toni’s life.
Thankfully, when Peter had looked up at him, his face had only creased into a sleepy smile. He’d been content to accept the morning cuddle Steve had given him, and it had taken a whole seven and a half minutes before the kid had shyly asked where Toni was.
“I’ve known you for years, Steven,” Tony replied sardonically, but the habitual use of his full name was something that Tony had always done with fondness, so Steve hoped it was a sign of impending forgiveness. “You don’t say things you don’t mean.”
The genius herself was still frozen, except now it was with something that looked like confusing and disbelief, but she was snapped out of it by Bucky coming forward and gently taking her wrist in his hand.
As soon as the particularly vicious aftershock was done, and Steve caught a glimpse of the way that the building had further collapsed in on itself, he rounded on the two men with him.
She’d been about to sleep, he knew, since she’d forgone her bra, but it only worked in Steve’s favour as he had no barrier to concern himself with as skated a palm up her side and carefully, so carefully, cupped her breast in his hand, thumbing the stiff peak experimentally. It fit his palm perfectly, soft and supple and intoxicating by itself, but when it was coupled with a breathless little whine as she arched up into his hand… well, Steve thought he could be forgiven for taking her up on the invitation and latching his lips gently around the petal-pink nipple of her other breast.
Groaning aloud and ignoring the faint look of reproach it earned her from Coulson, Toni swiveled around. “Cyclops.”
Steve felt fury begin to bubble in his chest, ugly and violent, but the story had barely begun and he didn’t want to give Toni any reason to think that any of his anger was directed at her, so he did the only thing he knew would help. He wrapped his arms loosely around her waist, the contact equally to reassure himself and her, and nodded to show that he was still with her, still listening.
The biggest mob boss this side of the equator? The vigilante type, justice seeking, skirt-the-line-between-light-and-dark mob boss that struck fear into the heart of every man who committed any infraction against the people?
“Who the fuck are you?” he asked incredulously, flicking his gaze between the suitcase, the fabricators and Tony.
Bucky reached over to punch Steve’s bicep in retaliation for the dig, and Toni smiled softly at the interaction between them. Strangely enough, as they began to bicker good-naturedly, that more than anything made her feel like the nightmare was finally over.
As Steve paced the Quinjet, he comforted himself with the memory. People, himself included, so often forgot just how brilliant Toni was; her mind was like a steel trap and it worked faster and more accurately that some computers. She wielded any tool like it was a magical wand and she looked at what most people would deem to be junk, and saw something amazing. She ran numbers and rattled off complicated equations like she was reciting the alphabet. The woman was the personification of futuristic and if there was anyone in the world who front-lined the phrase ‘pulling a rabbit out of the hat’, it was Toni. She had this insane knack to come out of any situation on top.
Before he could do anything rash, like put his fist through a wall, his phone buzzed. A quick glance at the caller ID was enough to bleed at least a fraction of the tension from his muscles. “Hey, Babe.”
It took considerable effort and time to find his feet on his own, but once he had, Steve forced himself to be the team leader that he was. Within a few moments, the Avengers had established a plan to attack the mysterious blue creatures, whose source was still unidentified, and everyone was dispersing to their position. The lack of any sound from Tony was still jarring, though, not just to Steve, but seemingly to everyone. For a brief moment as he fought, Steve fleetingly thought that he would do just about anything to hear his best friend’s voice.
Her breath caught as she woke, stuttering in time with the shiver that rippled over her skin. Instinctively, she tilted her head to the side, baring her vulnerable throat without hesitation to the ministrations of a very persuasive Steve Rogers.
Knowing that JARVIS would offer him no more insights – not until he was satisfied that Toni was no longer going to be hurt by Steve – the super soldier began systematically checking the Tower, wrestling against the urge to go back to the lab and have it out with Howard again, because priorities. Peter was with her, so that ruled out the labs, she wasn’t in their bedroom, or in the room she’d had built for Peter on their floor, she wasn’t in the gym or the communal floor, she wasn’t on Steve’s old floor…
Toni scooped Peter up into her arms as he barreled into her, relieved that she’d had the foresight to step out of the armour and send it back to the tower before she’d entered the room. The amount of blood splattered over it couldn’t have been hidden, despite the fact that red was its base colour.
Thankfully, his entire body was being lifted, bed and all, before he could do something stupid like call out for her. He exchanged a bit of lighthearted banter with Erskine, more for the peace of mind of everyone else, and braced himself when Erskine called for Stark – whichever one of them – to start the process.
“Scolded you, maybe,” Toni sniffed imperiously. “JARVIS adores me.” She grinned when the words earned her a snort of amusement from her companion.
Dismissing the idea of trying to fabricate a new knife in time, Tony instead stalked across his workshop to the suitcase he kept behind one of the shelves. It was some of his old belongings that he hadn’t anticipated needing again, but was now glad that he’d kept as backups.
“Fuck me, Steve,” she demanded breathlessly, looking up at him like he was the only thing she’d ever wanted in this life. God knew she was the only thing he wanted right back. “Make me yours.”
“You couldn’t,” Toni replied with quiet conviction. She dragged her fingertips down his spine and back again, happy when he relaxed on a soundless sigh. “Trust in how much I trust you.”
Toni might laugh at him later, for the sentiment, but Steve didn’t care. He wasn’t going to take any shortcuts making sure that the genius knew she was the love of his entire existence.
“You always have my attention, sweetheart,” he husked, trailing kisses along her jaw. “Including when you’re not even in the same room.”
It was the only thing that Steve needed to hear, apparently, because in the next moment, he was laying her on the bed and following her down, wrapping himself around her as if he could protect her from the entire world as long as his body stood between her and danger. For all that he covered practically every inch of her, he was unfalteringly careful, never once putting any pressure on one of her injuries.
The AI didn’t answer, but as Steve stepped into the TV room to check if she was there, the screen suddenly lit up. Curiosity kept him rooted to the spot, and when he realized that he was seeing footage from the lab, seeing exactly what had happened over the last forty minutes between father and daughter for Toni to finally punch Howard in the face, he paled even further.
Tony had always had a gift; a certain predisposition; for processing large quantities of data at a speed not even matched by the most advanced of supercomputers.
And okay, that was pretty much how Toni wanted it, to be honest. Ever since she’d been a little girl, showing any sign of weakness was nothing less than taboo, and fear was the greatest weakness of them all.
Avoiding everyone’s eyes, Toni followed Coulson out without a word, unsure how to express her immense gratitude or the reason for it.
Rhodey had been borderline homicidal with rage, but he’d submitted to Tony’s pleas to let it go. The Lieutenant Colonel had also been happy to let him crash there as long as he needed – Rhodey was the actual best and Tony would fight anyone who said otherwise – and it was the first he’d felt at home since sharing a dorm with the man at MIT. It was also where Tony had come up with Carbonell Tech.
Without thinking, Steve fingered the good luck charm he carried with him on every single mission; it was a little charm, about the size of a penny; a novelty thing that was designed to look like the arc reactor in Toni’s chest. He’d seen it one day when Nat had been showing him around the city and bought it for Toni as an impulsive gag gift, only when it had come time to give it to her, he just… hadn’t. Even then, before they’d gotten together, Steve had admired the little gadget that powered her suit. The artist in him had appreciated its beauty while his inherent curiosity craved to know more about it, but it was neither of those things that had ultimately influenced the decision to hold onto it instead.
“Sure am,” Toni answered, clearing her throat in an effort to dispel the lump that kept tangling it. It was obviously a lost cause, trying not to think of her mischievous little boy, but then, maybe it was best she didn’t. Thoughts of him, of Steve and home, would make sure that she kept fighting. “My son’s name is Peter.”
Her faceplate drew up with a dull clang and Toni spared a moment to wonder what they saw when they looked at her. Whatever it was, it was enough to make one of them dissolve into pleas, and another, the one on his knees, start shaking like a leaf.
Unwillingly, his eyes flickered to the arm that had been grabbed by Howard, and he was incensed all over again to see the red handprint bruise that was blossoming there.
She didn’t get an answer, but she didn’t expect to. Biting her lip until it threatened to split gave her something to focus on that wasn’t her screaming arm, and after a few dizzying moments, she managed to maneuver herself enough to assess the damage.
Pulling back with the purpose of declaring his intentions, Steve instead found his voice caught in his throat as he looked at his love.
“Rhodes,” the super soldier explained miserably, leaning almost desperately into the contact of Tony’s hand against his neck. “I heard you talking to him last week. You told him you were over me. Why? And why didn’t you tell me about it?”
Steve started to speak, determined to remind them of his presence, but before he could, Tony beat him to the punch. “That depends,” the inventor grinned, and Steve almost swallowed his tongue. “You gonna take me back to that God-awful Thai place with th-…”
The now dubbed Man-Child behind him drew a ragged breath through his teeth. “No,” he choked out, sounding so genuinely wrecked that it actually made Steve feel a little bit of compassion. Until, you know, he remembered the whole part where he was prime target for getting sliced. “I have to finish what he started. I have to honour my father’s legacy and
She arched languidly as Steve pressed closer to her, still mouthing at her neck. Every so often, the scrape of his teeth would send little shockwaves zinging through her body, followed by lazy contentment as he laid openmouthed kisses over the sting, suckling his apology. At some point, her hand had drifted to join his against her abdomen, fingers tangled together as she held on to him.
Even so, Steve was hardly intimidated. “Shoot,” he invited indifferently, relatively certain that nothing the army man could say would surprise him. It was already obvious that the man hated him and had deemed him unworthy of being with his best friend; what else was there?
“You were jealous… because you wanted me at home?” Tony asked eventually, slowly, like he was clarifying.
Bucky nodded once, but Rhodes only stomped past him, the armor making the feat far more impressive than if it had just been the man. Without a word, the super soldiers followed, both of them knowing without saying that it wasn’t worth the fight in this moment. In this point in time, when every second counted, when it meant the difference between getting Toni back and… not.
The kid pulled away from his mother long enough to glare fearsomely at the reporter. “Stop it! Stop saying those mean things!” he demanded, yelling as Peter was wont to do in order to make his point, and loud enough to catch the attention of the rest of the crowd of reporters. “Miss Toni is the best superhero in the whole world, and she’s a real nice Mama too! She was real brave and she didn’t let me go or let me get hurt, not even a scratch! You don’t know anything!”
Steve didn’t know whether to be grateful for, or annoyed by his best friend’s interference when he heard Nat’s voice over speakerphone, but he was forced to admit that speaking to Peter was probably the only thing that would keep his head away from the dark thoughts at this point.
As they walked in companionable silence, Bucky kept throwing sideways glances at him, but Steve didn’t call him on it and Bucky didn’t speak up. Instead, when they reached the tent, his friend grinned and shot forward the last bit of the way to beat him there, making Steve huff in annoyance at the fact that he could still be caught off guard by Bucky, super soldier or not.
The archer would have given anything to help ease his son’s pain, even buried as it was underneath childish anger, but the cost of living off the grid, keeping his family safe from harm with top of the range security and still supporting them all on his paycheck alone… SHIELD paid him well, but not exorbitantly, and less so after he’d joined the Avengers, as the transition had bumped him down to a SHIELD contract employee. Damn bureaucratic red tape.
“Morning, beautiful,” Steve replied warmly. Obviously, she’d been worried about nothing, as everything seemed to be going okay. “You know, I have no idea how you balance on your chair like that.”
Clint still wasn’t entirely sure how that one had crept up on him; and by that one, he meant the mismatched family that had banded together over the course of the past few years, adding to the tally that had started with him and Nat. Laura often teased him, saying that she’d had to wait for years after their marriage before he’d given her in-laws, and though Clint pretended otherwise, it made something that was now all too familiar swell up in his chest, to think that these people were now his. His family, and his alone.
Smiling slightly, she dipped forward and pressed a kiss to his forehead. “You really are the ‘one with strength’, Maico. Your mama named you just right,” she told him softly, ruffling his hair.
The picture inside the envelope hadn’t changed; it was still Steve, bound to a pillar, shirtless and uninjured save for the sluggishly bleeding wound on the side of his head that told the story of just how those cowards had managed to get the drop on his boyfriend. Three red dots were trained unerringly over Steve’s heart, the shooters out of the frame but making their point rather loudly. There was still block lettering in black marker on the back that clearly read:
It shouldn’t have been such a turn-on, but it really was. Toni had been quick to find out that Steve’s voice was more than enough to spark desire in her, but when he talked like that? When he praised her, called her his? It felt like euphoria was buzzing in her veins.
“Thank you,” she replied simply, a rare moment of unguarded gratitude making her relax muscles that she hadn’t realized she’d tensed. “I just wish we had something to go on. HYDRA’s been quiet for a while and that doesn’t inspire much confidence, but if this is an ambush, then it’s a really sloppy one. You guys are prepared for something like that, even with the unfortunate last-minute roster change of me being benched.”
As he ran off, he distantly began to entertain the notion that he might have been a bit off-base with Stark. She obviously cared about more than herself, if today was any indication.
“Love the way you taste,” Steve growled when he finally released her nipple. He released his grip on her wrists – rumbling his appreciation when she kept them in place – and slid rough hands down to her waist, pinning her to the bed so that she couldn’t bow upwards against him. Then, with the utmost care and tenderness, he leaned down and pressed a kiss to the middle of the arc reactor. No matter how often he did it, Toni still felt a shiver race down her spine.
A quick reminder: Italics are flashbacks, bold is conversation over comms or phone, and this: (###) denotes a change in perspective <3
“I didn’t think for a second that you’d go after Stevie,” Bucky continued, ignoring him, and if this was an apology, then it was a really bad one. “I didn’t think for a second that you loved him enough to risk…”
Her right knee in particular ached, and she carefully lifted herself to her feet at the same time that the doors suddenly swished open.
Maybe it would be enough for someone else, but he was… God, he called himself Tony’s best friend. He claimed to love the man. And yet this was how he’d treated him? And why? Just because of some admittedly potent, but apparently unwarranted jealousy?
(It wouldn’t be until much later that Steve would realize the flare of heat didn’t make an appearance while Bucky spoke to Peggy.)
It wasn’t an intrinsic, bone-deep kind of knowing; not the kind of ‘I can feel it in my veins, she’s not in there’ type of knowing, or that educated guess type of knowing based on the trajectory of the flight or whatever, like Toni sometimes did; but the kind of knowing that came from decades of being best friends. Of being family. Rhodey knew the genius in the same way that he knew himself, and so he could say with unimpeachable certainty that Toni Stark would walk to her own execution before letting a little boy die on her watch.
Bucky snorted, leveling him with a knowing look. “You’re saying that like you aren’t already getting all overprotective on her.”
Peggy didn’t bother to announce her arrival further than an urgent, “Toni!” as she strolled into the genius’ space. Steve followed awkwardly, in time to see Stark hastily covering something on her desk with a bit of tarp.
Toni was pretty much the only person in the entire world who never, at any point, mixed Steve Rogers with Captain America; was the only person in the entire world who knew exactly when to reach a hand out to the former in order to give the latter the strength to be everything the world thought he effortlessly was. Steve wasn’t entirely sure how he was going to do it without her, this time.
All through his rant, Toni was ashamed to admit, she’d stayed completely unresponsive, mind reverting back to the little girl who’d been terrified to see her own father looking at her with so much blind hatred. She was ashamed to admit that she’d barely taken a breath the entire time, and when he all but flung her away from him, she was ashamed all over again to admit that she’d stumbled on unsteady feet, tumbling to the floor and scraping up her palms as she tried to break her fall.
on the other hand, would have taken Tony to a drive-thru that was showing the Hannibal Lecter trilogy. It was a classic, and one of the few movies that the genius rewatched because it was suspenseful enough to keep him entertained, and not so filled with technical knowledge that Tony had trouble turning his brain off with it. Plus, it would have had the added advantage of holding the genius close in the privacy of the car…
Leaning a hip against the table, he regarded Barnes. “People see the Carbonell and forget that there’s Stark in me, too. But that’s okay, because I’ve always thought that the most dangerous thing in the world, is the thing that people don’t see coming.”
She was almost tempted to talk herself through the climb, disquieting as it was without JARVIS as her constant guide and steady presence, but she was struggling for breath already; the thin air combined with the dust and her compromised lung capacity enough to thwart even her stubborn refusal to back away from a fight; and she didn’t want to aggravate the situation. Her progress was slow, but it was marked, and it would be for nothing if she did something stupid like pass out from lack of air and fall all the way back down.
To Toni’s surprise, Bruce answered before she could. “Don’t take this personally, Jim,” he preceded his words with his typically placid smile, “but as a man who’s pretty intimately familiar with the phrase ‘being on the edge’, take it from me; Steve’s been there since he got that phone call from Ms. Potts.” As he spoke, Bruce finished up his careful wrapping of her ribs, fingers so gentle against her that they brought only comfort. His touch was far preferable to her than the medic’s; not because Kevin-the-stupid-paramedic was particularly rough with her – indeed, it seemed like he was taking great pains to be as gentle as he could, lest he bring the wrath of half of the Avengers down upon him – but because there was a distinct difference between his cold and impersonal touch, as opposed to Bruce’s warm, caring, loving one. She felt safer with her fellow scientist; a notion that he’d always expressed shy bemusement over whenever she’d voiced it.
Tiredly, she got the suit up and running again, smiling faintly when JARVIS’ voice greeted her again. “What’s the status, buddy?”
“No means no.” She turned her glare towards her lover, but Toni was resigned to the fact that Steve was probably immune to it by now. “Look, I’m here, aren’t I?” Demonstratively, she pointed at her arm, where Kevin-the-paramedic was cleaning the blood and debris from the gouge that the beam had made through her flesh. “If somebody would be so kind as to stitch this thing up for me, I can be in the air in twenty minutes. Half an hour on the outside.”
