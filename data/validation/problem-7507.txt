“It wasn’t always like that, you know”, Tony said to break the silence.
When Steve returned from his patrol, he was asleep on the bed, holding on his notebook like his life depended on it. Which was probably accurate. He walked up to him, not attempting to take it out of his hands and throwing a blanket over the other man, joining him on the other side of the bed.
He grabbed Tonya’s shoulders, looking down at him as he held onto them tightly, craning his neck down to stare into the sapphire abyss. “I cannot help you. I have tried, and I can’t,” he said bluntly, softly.
“Um...”, Steve scratched the back of his head. “I am interested, I mean, curious about what you are.. how you work.. and all that..”
Steve laughed. “No, it was a nice vision,” he said blushing slightly ad he pulled his arms back to wrap around his own chest.
“I’m sure that nobody will notice that you were gone, take it as a..lunch break”, Steve chuckled. Something must have been wrong with him because he just found the idea of a tooth fairy sneaking into his room and asking him out on a date extremely sweet. Yeah, something was definitely wrong, once again he blamed the drugs.
“Of course we can,” Tony said with a subtle grin, noticing Steve’s interest. “There’s no set rule for that.”
“I’m aware that you, sir and Mr. Stark are engaging in such entertaining activities, am I correct? He merely wanted to offer you the same pleasure”, Tony replied, enjoying how blushful Steve would get, completely unaware of how he looked at that very moment, embarrassed with what he was hearing.
“Tony... So Tony, there you go, here’s your tooth”, Steve nodded, handing him the tooth.
They were free to love and free from pain, together forever.
“I expect nothing more than to be cared for,” Steve said, mulling over the idea that it could be a sign, praying that it was the approval he had sought from his mother so badly. “I want this, Tony.”
“It’s strange you calling you..um..Steve, you’re the Captain..but if that’s what you prefer now”, Tony said after getting another sharp look from Steve, huffing in content when Tony finally accepted to drop his alias.
They watched the rest of the film while Steve was doing his commentary, Tony asking him all kinds of questions. He seemed reserved at first, but the more Tony asked him, the more answers he was getting out of him. It was just like he expected, Steve was telling him the real deal, not what the pictures showed, how serious he had to be, but also what the films didn’t show, how close he was with the Commandos, Bucky, the rest of his friends, the ladies he developed feelings for even. Tony was listening to him very carefully, staying quiet and just letting the man take everything out of his chest, appreciating more than anything the fact that he was talking to him at that very moment. Before they could even realise, the film was over, but Tony didn’t really move away, besides disconnecting his reactor from the projecting device.
Tony nodded, and Steve smiled, moving through the water to reach Tony's side. “Well,” he said, giving him a kiss on the cheek, “I like being around Tony. This Tony.”
“You’re lying to me again, Richards! Just for once in your life, be honest! Tony died because of all this dishonesty and distrust, and now this happens? And you refuse to just spill out the truth?!”, he shouted. He couldn't be calm any more, not when the body of his friend that he buried not even a week ago was laying there in the same room as him, along with a man responsible for his death just as much as he was.
“I’m unsure; my mother has wings on her helmet too,” Steve said. “I suppose it represents swiftness, freedom, elegance - the last of which I quite obviously do not possess.”
“Captain, wave at us!”
Steve nodded, giving him a warm smile, slowly adjusting himself to turning around, lying down on the bed with his face tilted to the side so that he could still take the occasional glance over his shoulder at Tony.
With a slow movement, he put one leg in front of the other, and then another, he repeated the slow movements until they felt more natural and found himself a few steps in front of the bed.
“Japanese food? No.. can’t say I have..”, he blinked, narrowing his eyes at the images. “That doesn’t look very tasty..”
him, in all his glory. Tony just stared in awe, his gloved hand reaching and touching the thin ice that was separating them. How was it even possible? If he didn’t know any better, he could have sworn that the Captain was indeed just sleeping, just resting his eyes after sacrificing his everything to save their world.
“Tony Stark. Of course I do. I’ve never missed an issue of all your magazines, I’m a great fan”.
“After them, we need to reach them before they get away!”
“Alluring?” Tony said in a low voice, shivering when he felt Steve’s fingers on him, pushing himself closer.  “You know, I would give credit to the stunning Athenian in front of me as well. You are simply beautiful."
Why did he wake up that night though? He wasn’t sure, the nightmares were still vivid and the only thing he could think off was that he needed some water, some fresh air, anything but to stay in that dark room. His hand was instinctively placed over the centre of his chest, gasping for air; he thought that those panic attacks were mostly gone by now, but he was wrong, he was reminded of that every time that he would wake up in the middle of the night.
“What the hell??”, Tony shouted, as Hulk’s growl made everyone jump. “What just happened? I hope nobody tried to kiss me”
Steve was staring blankly at the spot where Tony was standing in just a second ago.
“That’s what I’m doing!”
It was Steve’s turn to be speechless, and when he turned at Tony, he found him smiling widely at him.
“Stay away…!”, Tony insisted, curling his legs up to his chest. “Don’t come any closer, I’m warning you..!”
“I’m not leaving you with him!”, he shouted in return.
“Really? But you decided to lecture me on how you don’t follow your mother’s will blindly," Tony reminded him, knowing well what Athena represented. He just couldn’t imagine that the man was so pure, despite his age.
Steve tucked himself around Tony, kissing him gently in return before he rested his face by the man’s neck, his hand still circling the other man’s torso, fingertips moving along his dark haired chest and down to his medallion.
“But what?”, Steve asked him, not giving Reed any time to spare.
Steve nodded again, taking Tony’s quite firm hand, feeling warm and slightly shaking.
Steve’s beamed at him, wrapped his arms around Tony tightly. “And for you saying that, I am eternally grateful.”
“I suggest that you listen to your boss, Mr. Stane. He can easily fire you, I’m sure, so if I were you.. I would respect his wishes and follow his orders”, Steve said, letting go of the man’s arm, eyes narrowed, not liking how either of them were pushed aside by the older man.
It was late in the afternoon, and Steve was sitting on the rooftop of the Tower, that became one of his favourite spots to relax and think.
“We all deserve a bit of rest tonight, I can deal with reports and the press tomorrow, right now I need a bubble bath and to lay in bed”, he yawned as Happy drove off and into the city instead.
Tony stayed still as Steve did the same, warm lips feeling so good against his skin, and he didn't really know how to reply, what he should say, if anything.
“You can be an evil man, Steve Rogers, Doom has nothing on you”, Tony snorted as he ran after him, lacing their fingers together. Steve gave their hands a look but turned to him and smiled, making Tony’s stomach jump up again. It was strange, he knew him for so long and they were officially together, but it still felt so strangely nice whenever Steve would let him close.
“My reputation does, and as you know, you can’t hurt me, Athenian," Tony said, letting out a groan as he was pushed back, pushing Steve with his hands. “You can’t win against me in a battle.”
Steve said nothing.
“If you’re going to talk about Brooklyn, I suggest that we leave it to a later date, Steve..”, Tony started, interrupted by Steve.
“You don’t understand anything, you don’t get the bigger picture, you’re only fighting for yourself right now, aren't you? We’re keeping you here because you’re important, because we’re the only people who can protect you!”
Was that what he really wanted in life? To die with honour when there was so much more to offer to everyone? Was Steve right, was fighting a bad call? But he couldn’t just stop. He had responsibilities as the son of Ares. His father was the god of war; his people trusted him, and all he did was lead them to battle after battle. At what cost? Just to die in honour? Honour didn’t seem to matter much when you were dead, he thought to himself, and it wasn't cowardice that made him want to live; he wanted to see the world, and to offer something other than weapons to it.
Tony’s eyes lit up when he heard Steve’s voice once more and he nodded, trying to hide his excitement as he
“For now, I’ll get you a change of clothes and you can get on the helicopter with me, we’re flying back to New York later. You know, you’re Captain America, you automatically gain privileges, a celebrity status if I can say.. You’ll have a new apartment in no time, until it’s fixed you can stay in my Tower. The StarkTower, that is, I moved there as well a couple of months ago, I needed to be closer to the base of the operations”, the brunette replied.
After of what seemed like a century, being thrown outside his own window of his own tower by the power-driven god, back in his armour, Tony was in constant communication with the rest of the team, co-ordination their moves. They fought for so long, dropping down to meet each other and plan their moves, and Tony didn’t doubt Steve’s orders at any time. He might have argued with Steve Rogers, but right now this was Captain America, and they had to protect the world, certainly no time to argue and bicker. The team seemed to work well together, and much in everyone’s surprise, Captain America and Iron Man had a strong teamwork. At random times, Iron Man would land on, blast a couple of enemies, then turn his palms at Steve, the shield reflecting his beams, taking out more enemies.
“Was that supposed to be a joke? It feels weird coming from you..”, Tony muttered. “Very well, but don’t hesitate to reach for me, got it? My door is always open, even if you don’t.. want to take the offer”, he said, not really willing to go away, especially when he spent so much time being inseparable with Steve. He walked close to the door, opening it hesitatingly. “Be careful.. okay?”
“That’s definitely the place, I’m sure! Look at this, Steve!”, he shouted in excitement, gesturing at Steve to come closer.
“Yes… that’s how I've found the rest of them… They just… fell from the sky. If there is a rift there, it’s gone. It would appear then disappear in seconds after it spat out whoever passed through with it.”
“You have to listen, Steve-“
“Don’t worry, it happens a lot with the new guys.. you did well for your first try, you picked it up”, Tony reassured him, rubbing his hand where Steve accidentally touched him. He felt it again, that strange feeling when he first held Steve’s hand, and a part of him wanted to do it again, but there was no way of doing it if he wanted to stay subtle.
Steve nodded in acknowledgement as Tony took him back into the back of the palace, and into a different wing that he hadn’t shown Steve before. “There we are,” he reassured him, leading Steve to a smaller room. It was still filled with steam, as the room before had been, but this was far more private. “Nobody else will come in here.”
He found himself being quite silent, nodding and smiling as Bucky talked about his first meeting with Natasha and how they got together.
“But you can’t say it was a lost battle,” Tony pointed out. “Your technique was really good; I’ve never seen anyone using a shield as an offensive weapon before.”
Steve looked over at Falcon, and then at the other two men as he quickly sat up, away from Tony, holding his tunic to his chest.
“I want to see your face, but, I don’t want to hurt you," Tony muttered, torn between the choices he had in mind.
Tony let out a heavy breath as he tried to picture what Steve was describing. “And what will happen to you? And to me? And our people?” he asked quickly, staying in place.
“You don’t know a thing about me, do you understand? Don’t talk like you know me and what I really think,” Tony hissed as he stopped in front of the door. “I’m not going to let this war happen, I won’t kill you or your people just like that”
Tony saw the man shielding Steve away, and his heart sank. He realised that this was probably the last time he would see the man’s golden locks, his lips when he laughed, and those bright blue eyes that seemed to be filled with so many emotions, so much knowledge and passion.
“He’s alive and well. Healthy, so signs of cancer, chronic heart diseases, nothing. I patched him up after his fall, but he’s the only Tony that turned out to be alive, out of every body that came out of those rifts.”
This was over. He had to prepare an army, he had to be in top shape for the next assault, not mourning lost opportunities and pining after lost causes. He couldn’t understand the way Steve was thinking, but he'd offered to learn and been plainly rejected. And that was his reason for giving up in first place. It had really shaken his sense of pride.
He took a while, the journey long, but eventually he arrived in the beautiful city and walked to the citadel, going to local gatherings to tell others of what he had learned and about laws that Athens was thriving on. He sat down with children, trying to teach them about democracy and the concept of it, encouraging peace and discouraging fighting.
Tony was fascinated by everything that Steve showed him, jumping at every chance to read some of the poems out loud himself. He encouraged Steve to continue as they talked about the various meanings of words and actions of the characters, and Steve explained the background of the jokes and references. Tony was really enjoying himself, and didn’t even look outside to see the time of day; he was focusing on Steve’s teaching, replying correctly to the questions that were set to him, proud when he answered correctly.
Steve laughed, “Challenged and lost, initially.”
“You know, they deserve to laugh over something that doesn’t involve killing something more… innocent people, if you want to put it that way. Especially the children. We are raised in a very particular way, it’s almost not fair," he admitted.
, he said after a deep breath, carrying on inspecting the ice with his own eyes, the men already starting to dig up the shield. There was something really exciting about seeing his hero in person. Well, he had no idea what his condition would be, but based on simple scientific assumptions, his body would have been probably preserved.
“No, no.. not again..”, he said as he squirmed, noticing that he was hand cuffed on a pillar on top of the- how the heck was he even on top of his own Tower?!
He missed it. He actually did, he missed chatting with Steve, suggesting movies and shows to watch, music to listen, a new takeaway place to try out. It was fun, relaxing and casual, exactly what he needed to make sure that he was actually feeling good for a change. A changed man, that what he said he was when the reactor was removed from his chest, leaving a huge scar at its place, when he waved goodbye to his suits. It didn’t last long; the world needed protection and his suits were needed again, so he threw himself into work, especially now that he found himself more alone again. Building, night and day, making sure that his suits were even better than before.
“You know, the dead aren’t really talkative, they never really reply to your questions,” he said with a huff.  “Those bastards."
“And what about that..?”,Tony asked as he cautiously sat down opposite to Steve, giving him some space.
“You aren’t my friend Tony... I had hoped you were, but you’re not. You’re the son of Ares, I am the son of Athena, and we possess traits our parents have. Although I do not let blood dictate me, you on the other hand, seem to have that mentality. I cannot teach those who do not care, nor can I befriend them. You say you want to learn more but you already know I am no mathematician, I am no scientist either. I am a man of morals and justice, which you seem to have enough of here. I did not know at first, but now I am well educated in your ways.”
“It’s such a pity.. we had great plans for you.. the first of many in the new line of super soldiers, but you just had to find about this.. what does it matter to you anyway? You’re faster stronger than ever before-”
Tony tried again to smile in return. “You should keep on fighting, and maybe... maybe one day we can both find who we’re looking for, what do you say?” he asked. “If anything matters, I do have faith in you, from what you’ve showed me so far.”
“I’m fine, are you hurt??”
He kissed Steve right away to ease him but Steve’s eyes widened and he inhaled, gasping sharply as he felt the finger, letting out a loud shocked sound with the breath. “Tony?” he asked, needing the reassurance as his body tensed.
His eyes shined, the light coming from the flashlight emphasising how bright and excited he was to find that gauntlet.
Tony watched as Steve seemed to examine the room, walking close to him.
Tony nodded at him with a smile. “If we fall today, we’ll fall together," he said as he helped Steve up. “We started this together; we’ll end it like that.”
“My heart belongs to my city, that is true,” Tony said, “but I really want to see how living here is, if you would care to show me.”
Tony’s eyes lit up at the mention of their enemy and he stood up, his red chiton waving behind him.
Tony rolled his eyes; did anybody talk that politely anymore? Maybe they did, but not in Deadwood for sure, and this strange, polite yet intimidating Irish fella sure stuck out like a fish out of the water. “You do that, maybe I’ll get to sleep with my door open now”, he chuckled, looking around. “You still have to accept the offer for that drink”, he added casually. What he was doing? Tony Stark wasn’t pleading, he was offering Rogers a chance to join the big league, and after all, he was the Sheriff.
“So… how did this happen…?”, he asked as soon as Steve helped him sit down again, facing away from those ominous doors.
“Nothing. I just figured out that you wanted to know first, while I'm trying to work this out…”
Even though he was particularly jealous of the suit, which sounded stupid to him, Tony couldn’t help but admire how obedient Steve was, ready to take on orders, something that he wasn’t used to from the Captain. The middle finger on his armoured glove pressed against the hole, running it up and down before pushing it inside, slowly and firmly, giving Steve some time to either get used to it or push him out.
Steve's thumb trailed along Tony’s beard, taking in the sight of the man before him. Many had considered him invincible, untouchable and yet Steve saw the damaged side to him, a side he could relate to, in a way. He saw the same loneliness there that he suffered from himself. “Tell me Spartan,” he murmured, “what else do friends do here?”
Steve jumped straight up, turning up the volume, his heart racing at the possibility of Tony being captured and tortured again. He only heard what happened to him a couple of days ago, and he couldn’t help but take responsibility, clearly if he stayed in the tower, he could have stopped this.
Waking up, he jolted forward, breathing heavily. A really bad headache was there, and he was hooked on multiple IVs and...screens? Computers? A large white sheet was covering his legs, and his heart stopped. The moment that he placed his hand on it to remove it, a hand stopped him.
“Mr Rogers?”
“I’ll hold you and we’re both going down”, he said in a more serious voice, dangling from the edge as he climbed down next to Steve.
It felt so nice to lie down next to Steve, of all people, and Tony enjoyed Steve's company and comfort more than anyone else's in his life. It was so strange that he'd come to like him so much, how he wanted him there to feel more encouraged to follow his heart, and maybe Steve was the cause of it, maybe his presence did make him more human like in the end. “Steve?” he asked again.
“You shouldn’t give up, Steve”, Tony said quickly.
Tony actually replied with a smile that confused her even more.
Steve looked up as they finally returned to the monumental structures of Sparta, structures he thought he’d never see again, the large gates opening and letting in the chariot, taking it inside to the main structure where he had found Tony.
Tony couldn’t help but give in to this chance to be loved and love in return, even though Steve probably didn’t see it the same way that he did. They were friends above all, and that was what Tony saw them as. But he was starting to feel something, something he never felt before for anyone, just because he had let the young Athenian in, allowed him closer than anyone else.
“He was an idiot”, Tony said after a pause, much to Steve’s surprise. “He tried to take on Loki all alone, he didn’t wait until someone more qualified was available, that was stupid”
“Captain.”
“That’s right. I’ve read about the job in paper, sir, I think that I’m qualified enough for this job.”
He didn’t complain when Steve dragged him quickly to the car, he just smiled at him a bit tired as Steve started talking about how comfortable and fast the plane trip was, soon distracted by the loud noises of traffic. Tony chuckled as he scheduled their route in a way that Steve wouldn’t be able to see any of the monuments on their way to the hotel, wanting to show him everything on his own. Indeed, Tony planned this trip in every detail, hearing all about Paris being “the city of love” from Pepper, and even though he wasn’t really the romantic type of guy, Steve somehow managed to get that side of him to shine brightly.
“I, uh... I wanted to prove you that I didn’t want you to leave,” Tony said slowly. “I still don’t.”
“You didn’t scare me!” Steve snapped, turning his head away quickly, clutching at his papers as he carried on walking stubbornly. Of course he would never admit to being scared.
“Of course. I didn’t think that men like you still existed, to be honest. Everything has a price, especially when people know that you are a billionaire”
They finally had time to breathe only when they got on board Tony’s plane, glad to be leaving Buenos Aires. Truth to be told, he was worried about Whitney’s status, but Tony seemed to be more casual.
“Excellent. When do we start?”
The man before them was shorter than Tony; he did look slightly older, his dark brown hair having very faint grey lines, as well as his trademark beard. What Steve noticed though, was that he lacked Tony’s warm, blue eyes; this Tony had large, brown eyes, and he surely didn't look happy.
“I see.” Steve said, pausing before he spoke again – he didn't want to pry but he couldn't curtail his curiosity. “So you are... Untouched?”
“Don’t let him come upstairs! Why am I even paying you, you bastards??”, Stane shouted through the intercom, clearly annoyed and frustrated by now, which only made Tony smile wider in anticipation. “What are you laughing at, you little prick? Think that your precious Captain will fix everything up? Save the day and all that superhero crap you keep on believing? Hate to break it to you, kid, that won’t happen”, he said as he pulled out a syringe from his pocket, walking towards the restrained man. “I wonder what will happen if I inject you with this.. will it kill you? Maybe we should test that, if I don’t get my lab rat later, I might as well get a replacement now”
“I want to be allowed to love you.” Steve said.
Steve tried to meet Tony’s eyes, his mouth still slightly open, and his breaths were coming faster as he swallowed down the knot in his throat to move into Tony's touch.
“I hope not.” Steve said, pulling back with the warmth of Tony’s hand still lingering in his own.
“What...? Was everything alright..?”, Steve asked, his voice rough, realising that he didn’t speak for so long.
“You know who I am, come on… Is this some kind of joke the Avengers are pulling on me? It’s really lame, by the way, come on Capsicle, drop the tough guy act.”
“Where..?”, he asked, looking at the keys in his palm.
“I’m sure that you are. This job, however, requires a certain level of.. disclosure, Mr Rogers. I’m sure that you’re well aware of who I am?”
“I’m more cultured than you make me out to be, Athenian," Tony said as he sat down properly, looking around the amphitheatre and the stage, waiting for the show to start. “And you can really walk in and see any play… just like that?”
With a blink of his eyes, he did as he was told, rushing to change and put on a Christmas sweater with Santa Claus hats all over it, laughing out loud when he saw Steve wearing his own, not surprisingly full of stars.
When they were finally outside, an open car was waiting for them, the driver chatting in Spanish with another colleague. He dropped everything he was doing to welcome them in English, with the strongest accent that Tony has heard from a Spanish speaker in all of his journeys.
The silence fell again as the elevator stopped, making a small ringing sound, both of the stepping outside. Steve didn’t blink but he was impressed by the warm interior. He should have seen it coming, if the other man was anything like his father, always about style and wanting to show off. Which he did so far, the fancy tent of his back in the snow, with large chairs and desks, even the clothes with his name embroidered on it should have prepared him for this sight.
Tony turned his back to Steve as he slipped out of the tunic he wore to replace it with a cream coloured one instead, filling his cup with wine and sitting on the low bed. “You must be exhausted" he pointed out.
“Really?” Tony said with a soft smile, moving a little closer to him. “I thought you were joking."
“Since I used to run around with legs that had minds of their own. Someone would think I had stolen Hermes’ sandals and tried to run in them.”
“Didn’t think it was important.”
All that Tony could get from this procedure was Steve’s moans and his focused expression, head thrown back as he panted heavily, sweat and wet hair from getting so much pleasure. He had to show him, he had to know that it was
“You should try it out!”
Tony stretched a  little and finally set off, letting Steve lead the way while walking close to rivers, stopping to rest from time to time and carry on, always chatting on their way to Athens about all kinds of things and experiences.
The man was dark skinned and wore a tunic so large that, when he would spread his arm, it would often appear as a wing. He had the spirit of his mother’s guardian, her owl, in him, however he was a fierce warrior and so Steve took it upon himself to name him Falcon. “I am, Falcon,” he said. “I intend to leave now, in fact.”
When Tony’s alarm clock went on, the man jumped out of bed right away, starting to dress up. He wasn’t sleeping, he just waited impatiently for it to start ringing so he could be ready in a reasonable hour, not to mention avoid looking so impatient in Steve’s eyes. However, when he stepped inside the living room, he spotted Steve already sitting there, his hands on his knees. He gave Tony a small smile and stood up, a blazer worn over his black turtleneck.
He gave him another nod and tipped his head back again, taking in a deep breath through his nose to breathe out through parted lips, shutting his eyes to enjoy the warmth of the bath.
“He was doing a tour a few years back, demonstrating one of those missiles. His escorts were gunned down, a rogue terrorist group took him hostage, tortured, he was missing for a few months until we managed to track him down and save him. He doesn’t like talking about it, but...he came back a changed man. Focusing more on matters of energy and projects like the one you are part of, I think he wants to leave most of the weapons dealing business behind him.”
“Heroes know right from wrong,” Steve said, “heroes know who they are.”
“You would rather be a demon than a human?” Steve asked, looking at Tony with concern.
“My clothes?” He stuttered, looking down at himself then at the suit. “Why?”
“You were wrong, it’s not about them”, he finally said. “To be honest, at first, all the nightmares were about them but this.. changed now”
“He’s responsible for, this, and you shall stop before you’ll be forced to suffer the consequences of your actions. Do you want to face divine punishment?” he asked them with a striking voice.
“Do you mean he tried to hurt you before? And you still keep him around?”, Steve blinked, wondering if the machine on Tony’s chest was the result of a personal attack on him from his rivals. “Because that doesn’t sound like a smart move to me, no offence.. you should do something about that”
“No... No you won’t. I said we’re going together...now, we’re going together, just like we promised," Tony cried, shaking his head, holding Steve’s hand over his cheek, feeling him getting colder. He was having trouble breathing himself.
“Which is what I'm doing right now too. If I helped him take responsibility in such a messed up way that lead to his death… I'm taking full responsibility of stopping Kang and getting you back home safe and sound.”
“It felt so vivid, so real,” Steve said. “As though I could feel the way your skin felt, the way your lips tasted...”
“The terrace, of course. The best place to try this out”, Tony replied, the cool breeze greeting them once they stepped into the terrace. It was spacious, a nice small swimming pool was there, alongside some nice plants and small exotic trees.
Steve grinned and climbed on top of Tony, lying over his body and waving his own feet in the air playfully. “Morning, Spartan,” Steve replied, kissing Tony’s lips softly.
The blonde let out a happy sigh. “You think so highly of me, despite me being an Athenian,” he said with a smile.
“I respect privacy,” Steve said, “And I would much rather not risk my life or engage in another argument.”  A strand of hair blew in his face as he raised still occupied hands, trying to brush it back using the back of his knuckles.
“I love my people... Tony... But I try and do everything I can for them, I just... Perhaps I need to be away, to think,” he said. “To be with you.”
“Fine, I’ll give you that, they can be very festive - so, what’s with the gauntlet?”
“And yet you are trying to shield yourself from it,” Tony pointed out, smiling after every short kiss. He didn't want Steve to pull away, moving closer little by little, careful not to push Steve too far as he wrapped his arms around Steve's neck. “I really like this as well. And we can do it before we go to bed if you want to.”
Tony’s fists clenched, Steve had to fight back, he knew he would, he was the Captain after all, there was nothing he couldn’t do, but then it came to him. All those years looking up to the Captain he was just preparing himself for that moment, where he would save his hero, help him defeat the big guy, just like in the comics he read so many times before. Without any hesitation, he ran outside, and before Stane realised, Tony picked up the shield, which was way lighter then he thought it would be, hitting the man as hard as he could on his foot.
“And I mean, I love you as my friend, I really do. My partner, good old Winghead. But maybe deep down there’s something.. more. Something that I may not be able to exactly put in words right now, but I know it’s there. I think I might be in love”, Tony finished, rubbing his carefully trimmed bear at those words that he haven’t uttered in what it seemed ages to him, and he was probably right.
“Oh trust me, it was,” Steve said, picking up his shield again with the strap he had made, tying it to back to leave the armoury with Tony. “I wish not for you to witness that.”
“I think that the ability to walk again is a good enough offer”, Steve decided to reply before the two scientists had a chance to speak. “And to get out in the battlefield again, of course.”
Tony was gone.
“You seem very keen to remain friends, even though our time together has been brief,” Steve said, sitting up a little.
Steve nodded too. He didn’t know why he felt so sad about it. He had done what he had come to Sparta to do and he should have been happy. But he didn’t want to leave Tony; he liked his company.
Luck had a weird way to side with Tony at the randomest of times, and today was not an exception. That was when the belated shaking of the cave started happening, and when the window of opportunity was wide open for both Steve and Tony.
“Yeah! Well, we can test them now, but I used my new repulsor technology to ease the propulsion so in theory, they should work like a charm”
Tony rubbed his head for a bit, and then he splashed water in Steve’s direction. “I appreciate that you took your time to come into a conclusion concerning my physical appearance. That wasn’t sarcasm.”
“Using your status is unwise,” Steve said with a frown, watching the scenery pass them by.
“Your little faith is somewhat bemusing. You forget, I am the son of Athena. In my mother’s name, I shall ensure that my duties are carried out, no matter the blood that flows through their veins,” Steve said firmly, taking his leave and through the large marble doors.
Tony woke up from his unexpected nap an hour and a half later, hearing the footsteps and rushing outside his tent.
“Captain, you’re miles away from New York, we’re a bit further up South from where your plane was crushed. I need to explain a couple of things to-”
“It’s not completely raw, don’t worry about it”, Tony laughed. “Do you like it?”, he said, taking another piece for himself with ease.
“Steve Rogers, yes, Mr. Stark has been expecting you”, she nodded, offering her hand to shake. “Pepper Potts, Mr. Stark’s PA”
“You can’t control love, though. Eros has his arrows, and trust me, that little guy knows exactly what he’s doing. What if your time comes? Will you just... let it go?” he asked with pure interest. He hadn't me that one person himself just yet, even though he was always being pressured to do so.
“What, really? You would walk out of here?”
“I'm not going to lose you again! I've lost so many of you, I'm not letting it happen again!”, Steve growled, grabbing Tony’s arm to prevent him from moving away.
“No, you’re staying here and we will talk about your nightmares. Steve, they’re getting worse, you have to let me-”
“You think so? I was starting to doubt this, you know, after everything. You should take credit too, you were the first to undergo this procedure and make it out successfully, you started this”
“That is perfectly fine,” Steve said, stepping closer to Tony still. “You can keep it.” After spending the night with him wrapped around him, Steve was eager to feel him again, so he slipped his own arms under Tony’s and held him around the waist, hands gathering in the fabric of his tunic.
“I know”, Tony said surprisingly calm.
“We were all expecting you, Herr Rogers. Even though I’m surprised that you are all alone, where is Stark?”, Zola’s voice was heard, stepping on the front with an annoying, taunting smile across his small face.
Steve stood up, his posture straight as he followed the man into the elevator yet again. He didn’t know how to feel; part of him expected that outcome and he was wondering what would be worse, to see his lover’s grave or to see her aged in front of him, thinking of all the time he wasted and not having been by her side. His fists were clenched up and he stayed silent, following Tony out of the glass elevator and out of the building. The breeze didn’t help at all to cool him down, and he didn’t snap out of his thoughts until Tony spoke.
Steve shook his head. “We learn to be warriors but we also learn of culture,” he said. “Aspects to help our warriors live, to create doctors and great minds.” He slowly slipped out of bed, pulling up his tunic before reaching for Tony’s hand. “Come, I will explain. I have scrolls that have knowledge of our culture and art, writing and mathematics as you have asked for.”
He had to literally run on batteries until help have arrived, and after consulting the greatest doctors, he concluded that this was his greatest scar yet; to have a broken heart and for people to be able to see that. Of course, he wanted to keep quiet about it, and he didn’t allow for the press to know, keeping this between his more trusted friends, but something sure made him shrug thinking that his childhood hero saw that huge scar. He saw it as his weakness, and the last thing he needed was for someone like Steve to consider him a weakling, a soldier that couldn’t march in battle when he was needed to. It was strange, Tony was the one having the expectations, and yet he was worrying about not meeting Steve’s when he would require his assistance one day.
“You won’t regret this.”
“And I can assign you a place to live, get adjusted, catch up with everything..”
“I can fly. With my new legs, I can fly?”
He took his hand out of his pocket to pinch the bridge of his nose to stop any tears from running down, letting it rest at his sides, eyes widening when he felt a warm hand against his own, fingers holding tightly on him. He didn’t turn to face him at first, part of him so desperately seeking the comfort he needed, but when he did, Tony was standing beside him, looking at the tombstone with a strong look on his face. His bright blue eyes seemed to be focused, and their glimpse was almost magnetising.
“The one with the unnecessary huge bill board? I can see it all right”
“She lets me fight my own battles, what is the point of learning if not from experience?” he asked, keeping his eyes on Tony.
Steve moved, taking off his sandals and lifting his legs to lie in the bed next to Tony.
Steve gasped loudly, chest rising against Tony's mouth, and he looked down at Tony with his brow furrowed. He'd never felt that before.
“Sounds to me like he’s got his eyes on your company, you better be careful”
“We’ll see about that..”, he replied, his communicator beeping and walking away from Tony to answer. “What do you mean he’s here?? I’ve told you to you guard all the exits and the entrance! I don’t care, just stop him!”
Tony’s smile looked rather smug, Steve let out another moan as the kneading fingers on his hips began to move him. The friction between him and the suit generating warmth that surged up through his entire body, and by this point his knees were weak and barely moved.
He sounded confident, he had to, but it was true; he felt like an outsider, but learning more about the relationship between and Steve and Tony in that universe he was just convinced that the two of them just… belonged together in a strange, not explainable way. They had such history together and more ties to link them than he could ever possibly imagine. He would love to see them together, he would love to meet his counterpart but in this messed up situation that he found himself tangled in, he was the survivor.
It wasn’t until he was hit by a very clumsy and frightened cyclist that he actually had to pay a visit to the dentist. Spending a few hours there wasn’t his ideal Friday afternoon, but again he considered himself at least a bit lucky for not getting one of his front teeth pulled out. The dentist reassured him that the fake tooth that he would put in would look and feel like the real thing but it didn’t make the procedure of pulling the tooth out any less painful.
Steve stretched, looking at Tony and running his hand down the man’s chest, rubbing it sensually. “I’m sure I will,” he said. “I’m enjoying learning thus far.”
It seemed stupid to him sometimes, but he could really see a future, a life with Steve. He was close to marrying others before and was deprived of that chance, but if Steve said yes.. He sure hoped that he would, Tony even thought of the perfect chance to propose one day, of where they would live, of how they would organise their life. That thought made him smile as he was sitting alone at the office, spinning his chair and looking outside the huge glass window. He built a name for himself, he formed the Avengers, he was the Invincible Iron Man. Despite that, he failed too many times in his life before, he fell low, he was constantly battling alcoholism, but one person was always there; Steve. He owed him so much, he couldn’t even thank him enough for everything that he gave to him, and this was one of the reasons why everything that Steve did, every little thing meant do much to Tony. A simple smile or a touch of their hands together could mean so much more to him, and even if Steve never said those words in return, Tony kept repeating them. He didn’t do it because he wanted to hear them back, he did it because that’s how he felt, because Steve deserved to know.
“Go change into something more festive - keep one of your gauntlets on though”,Steve suggested all cryptically, moving away from Tony.
It was Steve’s turn to scratch the back of his head, looking away for a moment, hoping that his pink cheeks weren’t visible.
Tony looked at his chest and then at Steve. He felt far more comfortable around him by now, and in all honesty, he didn’t see any reason why he shouldn’t know about his past, after all, the two of them had bonded after spending what it seemed ages together.
“And why should I do that, Richards?”, Steve asked coldly, getting out of bed, drenched in sweat. Nobody was meant to know that he would wake up screaming from the vivid nightmares, from seeing Tony’s face over and over again, blood covering most of his once alive body, his suit of armour completely ruined.
“Must have been hard for you”, Tony said after he cleared his throat, having noticed Steve’s silence.
“Son of Ares,” Steve addressed him, holding his chin up high as he spoke.
Tony’s smile was so wide as he tried to contain his excitement.
“I need to tell you something, we need to stop them before the press conference, all this is wrong-”
“Can he see us?”, Steve asked, leaning closer to Reed.
“I know you are,” Tony said with a smirk, placing his hand over Steve’s. “You made me proud last night."
“This isn’t an office job position, Mr. Rogers. We’re here to ask you.. a favour, of some sort. If you were to accept, you will get more benefits out from this than we will.”
The older man took some rope, securing it around a huge rock and then himself, slowly walking towards Steve.
Tony took a deep breath; he avoided talking about this at all times but right now he was talking to a war vet that lost his legs, he saw the same, if not worse, destruction that he did. If there was one person that could understand how he felt, that would be Steve. He avoided talking in detail about it even to therapists that he visited, but something about the vet’s calm and soothing tone in his voice, his firm grasp from earlier and the concerned look in his eyes made him want to talk more for the first time in his life.
He looked at Tony, a man of such power looking so powerless at that moment, looking so childlike and vulnerable. Steve nudged him lightly, “Come on, my pupil, the day breaks.”
“Will you show me?” Tony asked again, staring at the thin brushes. “Can I see you drawing?”
“Now! Out!”, he shouted at Steve.
“They perform - What? You don’t have them in Sparta? But what do you do for entertainment?” Steve asked.
Tony was in the main chambers, sitting on the main throne with his spear and shield at hand, legs spread as he was waiting for the new arrival, smiling smugly when the guards approached. He didn't bother to stand up and greet him, only raising an eyebrow as Steve referred to him by his title, even though Steve didn’t really show any signs of respect. Only pride.
“You said that you’re leaving for New York?”, Steve asked as he picked up the torn uniform and kept it close to him.
“So are you implying that you’re any better? I expect to see that," Tony teased as he began to clean everything up and pack once again.
“But what about your father?” Steve whispered. “Will he not dislike this? You said you follow your father’s will.”
His horses were white and very tall and proud looking, delegated specifically for him along with a beautiful silver chariot with intricate patterns.
What he saw made him gasp out loud; the between his hands pressed on the man’s shoulder blades there was a small pair of light red, pink almost, wings. They didn’t resemble the wings of a bird in the slightest, they looked like the wings of a...fairy? They were fluttering maniacally, obviously in protest, and Steve couldn’t formulate a better reaction to that other than just blankly staring. He was having some weird hallucinations because of the drugs earlier, that must have been it.
There he was, alone in a brand new apartment, preparing for the the next day, the day that he would get back what belonged to him. He yearned for it, the sound of bullets, the mud between his soles, the feeling that he was helping his country, his old neighbours from across the hall. He was going to get it again, and that overwhelmed him.
Meeting Captain America wasn’t exactly like Tony pictured it to be, and there was no way of admitting to him that he still had his toy figure and toy shield locked away in his house when all the two of them did was fight and bicker.
“It was...” He took a pause, “Practice, for the real thing, so I thought.” Steve admitted with a mutter, nestling in Tony’s arms, content even though he was slightly agitated, but that seemed to wash away - after all, it was part of their relationship.
“If I was setting you a trap I would be far more careful,” Tony pointed out as he joined him, getting an apple and biting into it.  “And subtle.”
“I would like to keep it, if I can." Tony said, noticing how Steve was still looking at his work without bothering to move away.
There was a large iceberg in their way, but what made it more interesting, were the spare parts of machinery that were scattered around it. That caught Tony’s attention; anything that had to do with pieces of machinery was his expertise. He jumped off the vehicle despite the rest of his crew's protests, marching carefully towards the first pieces, kneeling down on the ice and trying to take it out.
“Like I said, I don’t think so.”
Steve obeyed, biting on the crust and closing his eyes; the last few days have been overwhelming, to say the least.
Steve took a breath carefully; he wasn’t used to others just sitting there as he greeted them but, as Falcon had warned him, Spartans were a different breed entirely. Tony’s dark hair was striking, it made his sapphire eyes stand out and look even more piercing as they seemed to burn through his soul with the stare he was giving Steve.
His voice was husky, serious, exactly how Tony expected him to sound.
“Together.. I love the sound of that”, he nodded.
Tony nodded and took the Gauntlet off, wrapping it up and placing it inside one of his bags.
Steve nodded, letting out a small sigh. There was something about that small kiss that had managed to get to him, to show his heart how desperate Tony was for him to stay. And perhaps how loath Steve was to leave.
“I don’t want to think that he did it because of me.”, Steve rushed to reply, voice slightly raised. “He shouldn't have done it because of me…!”
“Well, I’m glad you asked”
“Those are not warriors, they are nothing like us! Where’s their training, their teachings? They aren’t allowed to even consider themselves Greeks," Tony kept insisting, his fellow Spartans agreeing with his words, eager to go to war as they polished their shields and helmets.
Steve tilted his head and furrowed his eyebrows a little, “Entertainment? Hey, Tony hasn’t built a drinks dispenser in you has he?” He said with an almost angry tone.
“Why are you sorry?” Tony asked, meeting his gaze with a smile. “You let me in, Athenian. That’s more than I could ask for already.”
“I’m sorry”
“Are those.. the films they’ve made out of you? Of Cap, I mean..”, Tony said with genuine interest; after all, he had been Cap’s fan for a very long time, as long as he could remember, actually. “I’ve seen some of them.. the ones I could actually find..”
“Didn’t take long for you figure out that you aren’t really mad at me”, Tony smirked, with Steve stopping munching on the spoon to give him a small frown, but laughing it off as he pulled Tony to a hug.
“That’s not it. There’s something else too, something that you won’t tell me.”, Steve said calmly for now, finally facing the corpse and sighing, placing his fingers over his eyes and shutting them. It wasn't just a way to pay his respects; he couldn't handle another moment of watching Tony in that state.
Steve was used to being subject to experimentation so he wasn’t as nervous as he would’ve been if it were other people looming over him, but it was just an AI, it was a machine, it wasn’t human and Tony had reminded him again and again that they wouldn’t judge him - which is why the man sought solace within his machinery. The Captain did as he was told, nodding and sitting on the table, next to the suit, looking at him curiously. It was probably a new way of putting the armour on, he thought to himself.
Steve nodded, grabbing one of the scrolls before it fell from his arms. Tony reached out for the scroll too, though he found Steve’s reflexes faster than his own.
Tony heard the roughness in his voice, saw how his lips quivered when he smiled, and he tried to return the smile even though he really didn’t know why.  “Are you saying it was that something that brought us here now? That we can become human?” Tony asked, his voice firmer when he spoke again. “If you’re going to help me, I’m going to do the same”
Tony waited until Steve was ready before walking out of the bath and back into his chambers, with Steve following him closely, and he shut the door behind them as he ran his fingers through his hair, trying to dry it up a little.
“I will lead my people and we will fight!” Steve shouted back with determination.
Moments later, he was left on the stairs of the giant Tower, staring up without really having any idea where to go. He walked inside, and the moment he approached the reception, he could feel the stares, coughing to both clear the throat but to also distract the secretary who seemed to be fixed on his legs. Maybe he should have chosen to wear longer trousers that covered the majority of the legs instead of the cut ones that he used while his legs were missing.
“The scar still looks quite.. fresh”, Steve pointed out.
That was good enough for Steve; he didn’t like Stane, the way he talked to Tony, even the way he looked at him raised his alarms, and now he was proven right. He knew what he needed to do; he was going to save Tony. Even if the world didn’t need Captain America, it was obvious that Tony needed him now more than anything else. His eyes fell on a small bag in the corner of the room that he didn’t notice before, peeking from behind the curtains. That didn’t belong to him, he was sure, Tony must have left it there when they first entered the apartment. With initial hesitation, he unzipped the bag, letting out a huff when he took out the contents of it.
The slick smooth surface of the finger managed to glide inside his body, as it went deeper his toes curled and he raised his knees slightly, trying to spread them so it wouldn't hurt as much.
“I’ll take care of those tomorrow morning, let me shut an eye tonight, okay? It’s hard to sleep around snow, you know, especially when you’re woken up every ten minutes or so”, Tony replied to her, the red head nodding to him before giving Steve another curious look, heading to the elevator and shutting the doors behind her.
“I thought that since you are part of the military, you would know..”
“I do know that our weapons are Stark Industries branded. And that his missiles gave us a huge advantage at the most dire situations.”
“Celebrate? We both know that this is far from over.. despite your inspiring talk earlier”, Tony replied as he moved the object around his hands. “Anyway.. here, I thought that you might have wanted this back”, he added as he got the shield out of his bag and passed it to Steve, who got it and started to run his fingers across it.
“Now!”, Reed called over the intercom, and with Steve’s call, the combined, synchronised attack of the Avengers threw Kang deep into his own portal, disappearing with him.
Tony was taken off guard by that the confession, and he took his time in replying. “I really want that too, you know," he said finally, and Steve smiled softly this time.
“And I’m telling you Stane, I have no intention of- wait, what time is it there? Isn’t it like 2am? Go back to bed”, Tony sighed into his phone’s screen, the man on the other end shaking his head disapprovingly.
“But Steve, this one is
“That you have your ways with the women of your city,” Steve said, keeping his eyes set down into the contents of his glass, staring at his own reflection, tainted red in the wine, “and of other cities.”
“So? What’s wrong, Doctor?”, he asked in his authoritative voice, arms crossed.
“It’s actually keeping me alive”, Tony replied, giving Steve a couple of seconds to register that. “A shrapnel is located way too close to my heart. This device is using electromagnetic power to keep it away from my heart, so you know, I won’t die. And before you ask, no, I can’t get it removed by surgery, at least not now. Maybe one day, but for now, this is what I live with”
“Wakey wakey, Tony”, a familiar voice was heard from the opposite direction, and Obadiah Stane appeared in the picture, a wide grin spread on his face. “How do you like the view? Pretty splendid, don’t you think?”, he asked as he turned to look at the city below them.
Steve had little recollection of the past couple of weeks; he remembered doing press interviews, photo shoots, meeting with veterans, kids, anyone willing to learn more about Captain America and listen to his inspirational speeches. Tony has been his side throughout everything, and even when Steve was able to move in his own place, Tony insisted that he stayed in the Tower with him. For a strange reason, Steve didn’t reject his offer, and before he knew it, things started to get better.
“You have the right to know… what really is going on here.”, Steve huffed. He was thinking about it for weeks; they were getting nowhere with Reed, and it seemed that the only logical solution was to fill Tony in and prepare him to fight by their side whenever Kang would invade again.
He found out how exactly he could give hope to everyone, by presenting them the one and only hero that their world ever known, their own Captain America. Of course, his well being came first, and it would take a while to get him back on track, but the public’s opinion when they would see the legend walking amongst them, waving the star spangled banner, the shiny shield in hand, would surely lift everyone’s spirits.
“Do you want to relive that?” Tony offered, trying to be careful with his words – Steve was so innocent, only now learning to admit to things out loud. “Because I can make it work...well, if you want me to take over from where we left it back in Sparta.”
“No!”, Tony shouted. He couldn't accept that, he was trying for so long to make things right, and just when he thought that he found a way to keep everyone happy, the incursions resumed, the truth was out at last. Steve knew about the mindwipe, about the genocide, about him betraying him, and he knew that the betrayal was what hurt him the most.
The beautiful Captain was coming closer, his bright azure eyes that defined his handsome face focused on him, and before he knew it, he was moving in as well. “You.. what..?”, he said in a low voice, their lips only inches away from each other.
“That’s what global warming does to you, huh?”, Tony huffed once they stepped inside again, only to be interrupted moments later.
“It may be forbidden for me to ever praise Athena, but I’m going to pay my respects to her temple for keeping her son alive for me to meet,” Tony said. “Maybe our parents did want us to meet after all; maybe we can help them solve their differences."
“And what makes you think that we don’t possess that attribute? What makes you think that we need you, of all people, to teach us? We were taught a lot during our training, Athenian, and your teachings and words mean nothing to us. Do not speak like you understand any of us, you did not grow up here. Every Spartan that you see here, alive, is already a warrior from the moment of his birth. What makes you a warrior, huh? You fight with words full of promises and beauty. We can do that as well, but choose to fight with what really matters, our bodies and minds. We don’t want your teachings, Athenian, it means close to nothing to us," he finished, gritting his teeth the moment that Steve raised his chin, shaking him off.
“I’ll give you a guided tour and show you to your room, don’t worry. But you’re free to explore the tour on your own, just try to stay away from the labs.. otherwise, just help yourself”, Tony said as he walked ahead, turning around to make sure that Steve was following him.
“Steve…Steve..?”, Tony asked, still curled up, even though his breath seemed to be calming down.
Tony managed to strike back, killing the man, but he watched his own spear fall. He wasn’t truly wounded, and he looked up for Steve again, trying to decipher anything at all in his eyes.
“But you were comfortable doing what we were doing at that time knowing that it passed the boundaries of simple friendship?" he asked him.
“Let go of me!" Tony hissed, trying to release the arm that the blonde held firmly.
“I.. I saved you”, Steve said as he got up, holding Tony, both of them battered up but close to each other. “I’m pretty sure you’re safe now..”
“Oh come on! You can’t just roll your eyes when I’m telling you that the man who punched Hitler in the face fell here! His last stand, right here!”, he said, pointing at the iceberg. “And I’m going to find him”, he added, convinced that the hero wielding that shield must have been around.
Tony was enjoying the loud cries that came out of Steve’s throat, but he was hardly getting the pleasure, he needed to feel him himself, and Steve insisting on calling him Iron Man, taking the credit for the work he was doing himself. Yes, it boosted his ego at any other time. But this was Steve; he was his, nobody else’s. Steve belonged to Tony; Captain America belonged to Iron Man, that’s how he saw it. How was he even getting jealous over a suit, something that he was commanding on his own? He groaned louder when he felt Steve reaching for him, frustrated as he was, turning off the mute command by mistake. “Steve, come on...” he said between gritted teeth.
“I don’t think the places I may stay would appreciate me bringing another man to lie with,” he said, “but we could go back to Sparta, take the chariot.”
Steve tilted his head, eager to meet Tony’s lips since he was comfortable with kissing, and he traced the other man's lips with his tongue before locking their lips together.
“You’re wrong, Steve.. there’s so much to offer to everyone, just like you inspired me, you can inspire thousands of people! Not just lost kids, every single person in this country. They need something to believe in, to reassure them that their future is going somewhere, that we’re not destroying this planet aimlessly. You’re an icon, a leading future, if they saw you rising from the ashes, standing tall in the same costume you once wore, do you know what it would mean to them? If the future is scaring them, maybe showing them someone old fashioned will reassure them more than anything”, Tony replied to him, hoping that Steve would be persuaded.
“That..sounds good”, Steve agreed.
“I’ll talk to him.”
“Steve…?”, Carol asked, trying to get him back to the Tower, bit Steve didn’t even move.
“And I do not regret bringing you with me,” Steve said, resting his head by Tony’s neck, his eyes closing as he felt the soft movements every time Tony inhaled.
“What...?”
Tony smiled widely at that comment; it was different when it came from such an admirable man, and he was really grateful for the compliment. “Thank you, Athenian,” he said. “I hope I won’t disappoint you any further.”
, he thought to himself as he dressed up in his warm clothes again, covering his hands with heavy gloves, his neck and mouth covered up as well; it was never wise to put fashion over a snow storm, he learnt that the hard way after a team member almost lost a couple of his fingers due to a nasty frostbite. The advanced technology of that era could easily give him prosthetic fingers, but Tony would rather have his normal ones when he would point at the screen during meetings or when he would accompany a lady at a gala event. People did point out that it was well strange that Tony didn’t seem to actively miss those days and luxury, but in all honesty, he didn’t mind. It was a nice break from everything, if he had to put it that way.
“You have no idea. I don’t think anyone does until they actually get out there and under fire”, Steve muttered, shaking his head.
“You are staying away from him, do you hear me?” the blonde said firmly. “You’re not to see him or even talk to him again."
Tony immediately stood up, offering his hand to Steve. “Not yet, let’s try standing up”
“Isn’t your head burning up?”, he asked, wiping the sweat off his forehead, lowering his shield slightly once the rays seemed to be dying down, hoping that the rest of the team had better luck at shutting down the appropriate Iron Man focused death traps in all of the rooms. They did count on the fact that once the Melter was apprehended, the rest of the devices he built in those rooms would be permanently switched off as well, and judging by their strength feeling weakened, it seemed that at least one team was succeeding.
With all his strength, Tony shook Steve violently, trying to wake him up.
“I wish things were as simple between him and me…”, Steve sighed. That might have been a lie; even after the war, after they decided to let that behind them and move on, he was grateful for everything that they went through. It made them stronger, it made their relationship stronger and… it lead to this mess. Maybe some things needed to be changed after all. “Like I said… Tony was always there for me when I woke up. I didn't know that he was Iron Man at first, we had the warmest heart to heart talks when I was training Tony Stark… That fella risked his life for me so many times, and I gladly did the same… there was a huge fight a few years ago, Tony rooted for the Registration Act and I was against it… things got messy and bloody really soon, I was gone for so long, and Tony… Tony erased his own memories of the event to prevent someone from obtaining vital information that he withheld. Again… that guy was lucky to escape death for so long, and now…”
“How do you find them?”, Steve asked as he joined him in the workshop, not really keen on leaving Tony unsupervised for so long.
Steve woke slowly, rubbing his eyes, missing the warmth of Tony as his arms tried to move to feel for him. All he felt was grass and, once his vision cleared he looked up at Tony, preparing food for the both of them, which was a pleasant surprise considering how independent he usually was. Usually, Steve cooked and cleaned, preferring to not let anyone serve him due to his demigod status.
“Leave him some space…”, Jessica whispered to her as he gently pulled her away from the blond who seemed so lost.
“Yes, I just came back… What happened..?”, Steve asked him, reaching out to place a hand on Tony’s shoulder.
He said his final goodbyes when the funeral crowd was disbanded. Standing in front of the grave, with Tony’s name carved on the marbled stone, he was at loss of words. How many times had he been in that situation? He hated it, he absolutely despised it, after so long, he found it impossible to say anything more to the loved ones that disappeared from his life. Even after all this, Tony was still someone very important to him. That’s why he was so upset, disappointed, scared. Right now, he didn't even know how to feel. Fists clenching, his lowered his head.
“My legs! They got wet!”, Steve shouted as he climbed outside the pool quickly.
“Natasha. Close it”, he said, in a steady voice. The portal was getting smaller, the sky appearing clean again, but all of the sudden, a silhouette dropped from it, on the very last moment. “Son of a guy”, Steve muttered, smiling widely.
“I wasn’t ashamed, I could never be ashamed! I was lucky, so lucky to have you for myself, even for a night," he replied with a shake of his head, struggling with his next words. “I was...I was scared, all right? What if you laughed? If this wasn’t mutual at all?”
Tony didn’t raise his eyes, focused on his work. “Oh? Another one? And you’re going to let him in?” he asked as he narrowed his eyes, annoyed at the possible conversation that he was going to have with the ambassador. He was good with dialogues, but he hated talking about pointless things.
“That’s it.”
He was stopped by a red gloved hand against his neck; the soldier looked way scarier and more intimidating now, just like the war movies made him out to be, as he pulled Tony closer and inspected the crew men, their faces hidden behind the masks and headgear.
Steve’s fingertips tangled in the sheets and, as Tony raised his chin, he opened his mouth, desperately seeking Tony’s lips. He whimpered, needing Tony, arching his back as he tried to put more effort into pushing back against him, breaths coming hard and fast.
The next couple of hours were blurry, like being part of a hazy dream. He could swore that he heard people shouting, his chest being pressured, a sharp pain on the end of his legs and the back of his head.
Tony cursed himself, keeping his hands in place as Steve seemed to be pulling back.
“I’m sorry for not being there, Peggy.. I’m sorry..”. His eyes felt heavy, but he didn’t allow himself to cry, not when he was supposed to be strong and move on. He was allowed to mourn, but he couldn’t afford mourning the past and not moving on ahead. The real question was, if he wanted to do that, if he wanted to live in a new world where nothing was the same; he lacked something to live for, and that sure was a self destructing thought.
“Even that’s a bit of a push,” Steve said, keen to move on, “you barely know me.”
Tony watched him as he left, the image of Captain America he heard so much about replaced by Steve Rogers, another human being, a lost soul just like his, waiting for something big to happen and reunite them all again. And for the first time in his life, Tony Stark was sure about this, he knew he found his true purpose, a place where he belonged, amongst people like him, who he intended to keep close, not push away like he always did.
“Where are they! I’m going to find them! Where are they?!”
Tony had to stay completely still the moment that the Captain stepped inside the workshop, knowing that the suit would eventually get his attention; after all, he had the same eye for detail than Tony did, taking his time to pay attention to mostly everything. The moment that he stopped in front of him, he flashed a grin from the inside of his suit, so thankful that he didn’t actually have to speak to give orders to his suit. With a sudden move, the suit sat up, facing Steve, eyes lit up as it looked like it was examining him.
In a way, he knew that Stane was right; they had to move on, but he needed go further, to try and make use of every available source while the government kept chipping in and helping them out. His company started to face problems that were beyond his capabilities, so a breakthrough discovery would surely place them on the top of the market, far ahead Hammer Industries or even Baintronics. The man sighed and poured some liquor into one of his fancy drinking glasses, shaking it, lost in his thoughts. The liquid felt so warm down his neck, which was exactly what he needed before yet another mission in the icy cold weather. He didn’t have to actively participate, but it was fascinating to see with his own eyes what the rest of the crew would normally inform to him later. It always paid off, and he wouldn’t regret taking that decision to leave the pure luxury of his penthouse back in New York for this tent, which was still superior to the rest, if he was being honest.
It took him a couple of minutes, but eventually Steve’s eyes went wide open, shoving Tony away. “Tony!”, he shouted, turning around, relieved to find him there. He breathed heavily, taking deep breaths and letting them out, pushing his hair back over and over again.
Tony decided to set off the next day, for the leader of Thebes had requested his presence. Once again, he wanted to negotiate Thebes’ allegiance in the upcoming war that had already started to break out. Tony didn’t really trust him, but he had to do it, and so set off.
“In a good way”, Tony reassured him.
“Punishment? For what?” Tony asked, a bit confused as they walked around the market.
“That was easier than I expected! You’re not that hard to convince after all, big guy. And here I was starting to think of how to bribe you to accept-”
“I had my hands full, you know”, Steve replied, still on the floor himself.
“You’re risking the ship’s safety, Stark, no offence, Dr. Banner”, Steve apologised with a nod of his head.
The room was dark, Steve couldn’t exactly tell what it was, but when he made a couple of cautious steps, a single light went on, his eyes widening at the sight in front of him.
Tony lowered his gaze, watching Steve’s tongue moving across his skin, giving him an encouraging smile. “Steve...” he said again, stroking the top of his head as Steve continued.
“How?”
Steve laughed and smiled, always known for his optimism which was seen as rather foolish and naive some of the time. “My duty is to educate, to teach and to spread my knowledge. One cannot remain cooped up in a city that no longer requires to be taught. Besides, this could save my people.”
“How do you want us to..?” Tony asked as he pulled back slightly, giving Steve time to think.
“Think straight, you can’t just go out there and demand for them to- what are you doing?!”
“You’re not going anywhere.”, Steve replied, standing in front of him and blocking the exit.
“Perhaps,” Steve said. “You seem to have grown on me, Spartan; I didn’t realize your people made friends so quickly with those from your rival city. Especially considering our parents despise one another.”
“How do you feel…?”, Steve asked him as he examined him carefully, ready to take an action if he had to interfere in any way.
Steve let out another sigh, but this time he seemed more pleased with Tony’s words. After all, he was allowed to feel proud of what Tony became, of how he changed him for the best.
Steve’s look seemed confident and strong, but Tony was able to see past that, having experience that before. He knew very well how it felt to mask your pain and appear strong in front of others, and the least he could do now was to stick by Steve’s request. “All right, I’ll get Happy to drive us there”, he nodded as he stood up and typed on a device he took out of his pocket, gesturing for Steve to follow him.
“They?”
Steve let out a sigh. “I don’t follow my mother’s wishes blindly, and I question them and weigh them against my own ethics,” he said, though at the mention of being friends, his eyes widened slightly. “What makes you think I would want to be friends with you? And why you, me?”
“Tony! Pepper is looking for you everywhere, she said Stane is pissed for you not greeting him yesterday.. something about a discovery..?”, he said as he rushed in the car. The way he spoke indicated that Stane was indeed angry and that Pepper needed him back in the Tower as soon as possible. The last thing he needed was to deal with Stane when Steve seemed to be his number one priority. The comment about a discovery made him narrow his eyes; if Stane found out about Steve, things wouldn’t end up well for either of them.
“That’s the question,” Tony insisted, not moving away. “Do you want to understand me? Do you want to trust me? Do you trust me when I say that I won’t let your people get hurt? If we work together we can do this.”
“Someone requested to see you, they are waiting for you in your room”
Sometimes Tony asked himself; how did they come so far? Of course he was talking about himself, Tony Stark, and his multi-layered, complicated relationship with Captain America. It has been well over a decade, and yet, so many events changed their life, starting from that unforgettable day when the Avengers found the lost Captain froze in ice.
Tony reacted to Steve’s every move and kiss, trying to meet Steve’s demands and stay in control, showing Steve how to do everything, pleased when the man seemed to be enjoying himself, wanting more and more.
“Well, I think your knowledge will be more than just enough," Tony said as he sat down next to Steve, his eyes darting from scroll to scroll, not sure where to start from. But when Steve pulled out the first tablet filled with numbers, his face lit up, trying to recognise what he already knew.
“And yet they are connected by blood,” Tony answered. “They have their disputes despite belonging to the same family. And you’re right; it’s time to do as we please for once. We’ve served them for so long, it’s time that we follow our own dreams, our own desires."
“Of course… I'm sorry, that was highly inappropriate of me to ask…”, he apologised, rubbing his forehead.
“If they don’t...” Tony said, thinking for a moment. “Think we could interfere?”
“What, now?”, Steve asked, not expecting them to get right into it straight away.
One thing brought another, and the two men started to spend more time together, in the beginning wanting to discuss some of the team’s next moves together, those two being considered as the team’s leaders by the rest of their small group, then ending up talking about today’s music and films.
“No no, not at all, I’m just fascinated,” Steve said, watching the fire light up Tony’s eyes, stretching his legs out as he lay there.
Tony was looking outside the window, making sure that they took off just fine when he turned his full attention to Steve once again. “I hate to admit that, but.. we’re destroying this planet, Steve. Constant wars, developed technology that the nature doesn’t take well.. We had to find new means of energy, new ways to keep this planet going without further destroying it.. so this is why we’re exploring areas that we never did before.. I wouldn’t want to call it a wild goose chase, but it’s been hard so far.. we’re hopefully going to bump into something other than a frozen WW2 hero”, he said with a smile that disappeared from his face as soon as he spotted Steve giving him a disapproving look. “No more Cap references, got it”, he muttered.
Steve gave the man an inspecting look once again. All right, maybe just one glass was the polite thing to do, and in the end, he still needed to meet the rest of the townsfolk and earn his respect.
Opening the door and careful not to be relatively noisy, he walked down the corridor. “Last door on my right..”, he muttered as he stood opposite the door Tony directed him to, opening it and greeted by hot steam against his face, forcing him to close his eyes.
He was trained well and soon enough he became more useful, even tracking down bandits and bringing them in, glad that he was doing his job well. His reputation preceded him and after the Marshall retired he took his place, clearing up the smallest towns.
“And what exactly have you been doing out here?”, Steve asked him, aiming to gather as much information as he could before they flew back to his home, or at least, what part of it survived after all those years. He was prepared for the incoming changes, or hoped that he was. He didn’t have enough time to gawk over all the new technology and items that were in front of him, he couldn’t afford time to lose, he needed to get back on track.
“Impressive as always”, Tony said as he sat down next to him, biting on his own, jam filled pastry.
“You must be kidding me..”, he muttered as the cockpit was clear enough, wiping it with his elbow and taking a couple of steps back at the sight.
“See, Son of Athena, your wisdom has failed you,” Falcon said with a stubborn sneer, always blunt with his words.
He thought back to those accidents that he had that always seemed to aim for his jaw, no matter what.
“No, I just thought we could grab some dinner together”, Tony said with a shake of his head. “We could go out or just eat here, if you want to..? Watch something on TV..”
“You would come to Sparta again?” Tony asked with renewed interest. “After what I did to you?”
Tony ran towards Whitney who was on the ground, grabbing the Gauntlet which was laying next to her. Straight away, Whitney jumped on him, pinning him down, hands around his neck.
Tony pressed Steve harder against the wall, gritting his teeth at his words, annoyed by how calm Steve seemed to be, his threats and physical violence always intimidating others. But was that really him in the end?
“I would not do such a thing,” Steve said, breathing softly against Tony's warm skin. “I am a man of manners.”
“We… haven’t talked much.”, Tony admitted. “My dad helped run the experiment that made him Cap back in the 40’s… I've only met him almost… two years ago? Loki invaded Earth with an army of aliens, Nick Fury got a couple of us together to stop him. We didn't exactly hit it off, I'm sure that you can agree…”
“I mean it.. it’s fine..”, he said, giving him his usual, strong rub on the shoulder. “You don’t have to worry about me”
“Uh huh, thanks”, Tony muttered, putting the tooth away in a small pouch by his blazer’s pocket.
Steve was in his room doing sit ups when he’d heard the small beeping of the communication card go off, and with a heavy sigh, got to his feet and walked over to the desk to stare at the small flashing card. The bright cyan arrows were lit up along with the words ‘communication from Iron Man’. It wasn’t flashing red, which was a good sign at least that meant that it wasn’t urgent. He picked up the card, along with grabbing a bottle of water with his other hand from the table, popping off the cap using his teeth and guzzling the water down as he held the card up, tilting it and squinting to read it. The communication was a text one, which was a change for Tony considering he loved being so vocal.
How do you top finding an ancient mask, having your girlfriend turn against you, find out that your father was still alive, fought him, teamed up with a grumpy captain and lived to tell the tale? Too much excitement to last him a lifetime, that’s what Rhodey told him. Perhaps he was right, his heart couldn’t take it anymore, but he craved it. Settling down just wasn’t for him.
Steve sat back too, watching the play. He particularly enjoyed taking in all of the masks, drawing them in his spare time, but he laughed along with the play too as he noticed Tony doing the same. In fact, Tony seemed like a completely different person when he was with him; he seemed happy, light-hearted. Steve couldn’t help but look at him from time to time, watching how he smiled and how he would stroke his beard pensively whenever anything required thought. His rare bright blue eyes sparkled in contrast to his dark hair, and that stood out even more when he smiled. It was nice to see this positive side, and Steve found himself thinking that perhaps his initial judgement hadn't been wrong.
His beard was getting bushier, his eyes seemed to have lost that spark that they once had, and when the door slid open that day, he didn't expect Steve to walk inside.
“I just want you to go back to him, okay?”, Steve stopped him. “That other me that is out there, looking for you. I've had the time of my life with Tony… and now I'm keeping you away, I'm depriving your friendship from someone else out there, and that someone is me.”
“We’re not soldiers, Rogers! I’m not one of Fury’s soldiers, I refuse to be called that!”, Tony snapped all of the sudden, furious with the thought that someone would even consider him being that. He didn’t like loosing his temper, in fact he hated it, and he was pretty sure Steve noticed that, as he wasn’t looking at him with the same look as before, was it concern this time? “We’ll take Loki on, and I know exactly what he has in mind”
Steve walked inside slowly. It was daunting to be in such a large room when there was only the two of them, but he walked up to the telescope-like item and tilted his head at it. “What is this?” he asked with a baffled expression.
It had been a stupid idea, why had he even kept his hopes up?
Tony blinked a couple of times when he heard Steve’s words, at a loss for what to say for the first time in years. Nobody spoke to him like that; he was always respected and viewed as an important figure amongst mortals. But still, this newcomer just appeared out of nowhere and judged him for the way his people had been always raised. That was something he couldn’t take lightly.
“I don’t have to.” Tony said, and then he decided, shifting himself to make himself more comfortable, head rubbing against Steve's skin. “Well, I take it that you like it more this way then. I think I’ll be fine here.”
“I thought it was a pleasant dream?” Tony said, moving to sit opposite Steve as his curiosity grew. “What’s the matter?”
“I don’t regret coming out here with you," Tony said after a couple of moments of silence, slowly drifting to sleep, kept warm by Steve’s body.
“What else can you say to me about him?”, Steve asked curiously.
Tony was interrupted again, this time being thrown on the ground, as the man pulled the wires away from his chest, grabbing a satellite dish that there for repairment and running towards the exit as the men ran after him.
“You should know better, right? Being a veteran and all.. my boss is perfect for putting up a show, always has been. So I would advise you to think twice before believing everything that you may read in the papers.”
Giving pep talks wasn't his forte, in fact, he never thought that he would give one, but there he was, standing in front of his own grave giving a pep talk, heart to heart, to Captain America of all people.
Being a demigod meant that he was looked up to, but very rarely befriended. That was why his mother ‘created’ Falcon for him. But the friends he did make were often warriors who threw themselves into battle to protect his home. Though he would try and fight alongside them, he would live due to his enhanced abilities, and he would watch them fall. Despite the countless years he had endured it, it caused an intense heartache that he never truly recovered from and he hated himself for thinking that a younger king could have such open-mindedness to his opinions when truly he was a man keener to lead his men to hell than to protect their lives. Dying was an honour, he said, but Steve would never understand that.
“Steve..”, Tony repeated again, shutting his eyes, the echo of Stane’s laugh ringing in his ears.
“It’s why I couldn’t get my mind off you the moment I met you,” Steve said, curling his arm around Tony in invitation. “And before that, going to visit you required so much planning...”
“I uh.. after my mother passed away I had to look for someone else to live.. managed to get this place.. not that I could spend a lot of time here anyway, being Cap meant that I was just spending much time in the battlefield”, he explained. “I did come back before that one mission where I..”, he trailed off.
“Boy, she’s fierce! She could kick my ass anytime and I would love it, to be honest”, he sighed.
Steve got out of the bath, wrapping himself up quickly in his robe, tying it up and slipping his arms through. He knelt down for his sandals again and then stood straight, glancing over at Tony.
Steve looked at him with a puzzled expression. “What do you mean? I thought this was...what Spartans do?”
“Cap, think fast!”, a voice was heard from behind him, and Steve’s widened as he caught the bag in his hand, taking out a large donut.
It then dawned on him that perhaps this was the bargain that the Spartan wanted all along; to trade himself for the welfare of his people. Steve he had no problem with that; he was a man of self-sacrifice, and he actually enjoyed Tony’s company.
“We were together in my chambers before” Tony pointed out; unable to resist raising his finger to stroke Steve's flushed cheeks. “We didn’t do anything out of the ordinary...”
“And are you prepared to return to Athens with part of you missing, Athenian?” Tony hissed as he approached carefully.
“If this isn't a joke… then you must be one of those shapeshifter guys. Yes, that must be it…”, Tony mumbled as he leaned against the glass.
“I just, I don’t know, it really means a lot that you think that what I do is admirable,” Ton said, shrugging his shoulders. “I try, you know.”
“Well, remind me to teach you a couple of things about American humour, Steve” Tony replied, waving and walking outside across the road.
“That’s what you get for not sleeping on the plane when I told you to do so”, he said with an faint eyebrow raise, already changed into a casual band t-shirt and jeans. “Wash up, we’re getting lunch, I’m starving”
“Don’t thank me,” Tony said with a smile, rubbing the side of his lips at the soft kiss. “Have you finished bathing?”
“Yes, I’m grateful, they really are...they feel amazing, they are more than I could ever wish for”, he nodded. “I’m looking forward to today, Tony said that he will show me what else they can do”
Steve couldn’t help but smile in relief, this time his smile being genuine and emotional. He really wished he could take all this back, Tony was nothing like the guy he judged him to be. He laughed, looking at him with a likeable face, laughing at his nervous jokes.
“Yeah... If you don’t mind, I’ll go back to sleep now, I think...”
“There is only so much someone can try,” Steve answered with a shrug.
Tony found himself torn. He wanted to learn more, keep Steve there, but was lying to him worth it? No, his teaching said that it wasn’t acceptable, and he had to show Steve that he had learned from it. “Your debt is repaid, yes. I will do everything in my power to save your people," he nodded.
Steve was at the front, clearing a path and listening to Tony’s directions. He was so sure that they got lost, he could have sworn they were going around in circles at that point, but the argument stopped once he lost his balance, disappearing into what it seemed to be a really well hidden cave opening.
Tony gave him a careful look, smiling both at his words and the courage required to confess such thing. “You are loved either way, don’t you ever question that. We can do it the easier way, then. Another time, we’ll work it out.”
Tony nodded in return, shifting to the edge of his seat when the chorus stepped on stage, setting the scene with their song, after which Tony clapped in amusement. He sat back then, and started to pay attention to the different masks and costumes, and the way the characters would mock and criticize their society, finding himself agreeing with most of the jokes and laughing softly to himself.
“And you need to understand that what we could find in the South could be more beneficial for all of us, your old man would agree-”
Steve nodded slightly, trying to find a way to put it into words. “It feels really- strange but I really, I like doing this. I mean I enjoy being close, like this.”
Natasha nodded - with her taking out scientists and their guards left and right, she created enough of a panic for Tony to sweep in and finish the job. That was when he heard the bike tires, heading outside with Natasha and the device the guy in charge was holding.
Yet, this relationship didn’t seem anything like the one he shared with any woman before, but he actually liked it that way. Steve was holding back with his emotions and didn’t express his feelings openly, it was Tony that did the talking. But every time that the soldier would rest his head against him or when he offered to share his bed with him, that alone could keep Tony happy for days. The fact that he didn’t mind telling their friends in the beginning, and then people who asked that Tony was indeed his boyfriend, also helped Tony a lot. Nothing seemed biased and when Tony finally picked up the courage to say those three words to him, Steve responded with a kind smile. If someone else was involved, that would bring Tony down, but because it was Steve, it just didn’t.
“So.. this happened, huh? The two of us.. together.. it’s all real..”, Steve said, just to receive the confirmation he needed.
“Is that an excuse, Spartan?” he asked, making sure his shield was strapped to his arm.
“So what do you say?” he asked again, enjoying the Steve's warm body against his. “Do friends act like the way we do?”
Steve looked at them both from head to toe before shaking his hand firmly.
“We work at night, though, you know, with most people sleeping and all, makes the job easier.”
He trailed off, not knowing what to say.
“They wouldn’t”, the Captain replied, so confident about his reply.
“Pizza? Pizza it is”, Tony suggested, not really waiting for Steve’s reply as they stepped inside his penthouse.
Tony looked down in distress. “I'm… going home…?”, he asked to which Steve nodded. “This is a goodbye then…”
Steve kissed Tony just as deeply, feeling the intense emotion that he was putting into the kiss, their tongues moving together. The moment that Tony kissed him, he took the time to re-open his eyes to admire Tony’s face, his leg movements slowing down as Tony's kiss calmed him a little.
He was, and even if loving Steve was hard because of Tony’s constant need to be taken care of, it did make him happy, more than when Rumiko or Bethany said those three words back and left him when he needed them. Steve never left. Keeping a distance was one thing, but leaving was out of the question. He knew what he signed up for when he confronted his feelings, he knew that Steve was like him in many ways. He wasn’t just a superhero, he was a soldier. He learnt to drown his emotions, and the fact that he even let Tony in surprised him. Of course they had their fights at the start, they always fought, even when they found out what triggered a negative reaction from each other, but they would find a way to make up in the end. Some hours left in silence, even a night spent apart, but everything was forgiven.
“Yes? Now, the other you had proper wings sticking out of his helmet back in the day, I think that you should follow his example.”
Tony looked at the blonde’s eyes, swallowing down hard as he shook his head.
They walked in silence through the graveyard; it was a quiet Sunday morning, nobody else seemed to be around, visiting their loved ones. Still, Tony wore his sunglasses and cap lowered, hiding himself; someone who looked almost identical to Tony Stark standing in front of his grave would raise suspicions to say the least.
“You can use this bedroom.. the bathroom is just in the end of the corridor, the last door on your right”, Tony said as he rubbed the back of his head. “This right here..”, he said, pointing at the wall device next to the door, “Is the intercom. You just need to dial 1 and you’ll get a hold of me if you need anything”, he added. “Is there anything else..? I can leave you to rest for now”
“You committed a genocide, Anthony. You killed off an entire planet, an entire world. Thousands of innocents, millions, billions… All dead. Just because you couldn't wait, you convinced yourselves that you were the true saviours. I tried to stop you, and what did you do? You took me out. Just like you did to those innocent souls.”
“Don’t sweat it, she will have it back by tomorrow. I’ll give you a ride home”, Tony interrupted him, heading close to wrap his hand around Steve’s waist. They were so used to this way of transportation, even before they started seeing each other, figuring out new ways for Tony to carry him every time.
“..Really? I didn’t realise that the feeling was mutual..”, he whispered.
“I was sure you would say that,” Tony said with a small pout, getting himself more comfortable. “It’s not flattery, I reassure you.”
“Well...Mr Stark turned a new page for Stark Industries when he came back from- you read about that, right?”
“Hey,Tony?”, he said, one night while they were taking their usual positions to sleep.
Tony pouted slightly, crossing his arms. “Speaking of which, that shield is one magnificent weapon, I couldn’t help but stare at it before.”
“No...” Steve protested quickly, “I-I want to...” He looked down at Tony and trying to smile, but his nervousness was quite obviously shining through.
Preparing himself, he approached the punching bag, before landing a swift kick that sent it flying across the room.
Tony rubbed the back of his head; Steve seemed to be way smarter and capable of what he gave him credit to be, and he scolded himself for that. After all, he was
Tony was surprised that it took Steve so little time to understand exactly what he enjoyed. But if Tony thought about it, they had been together for a couple of days now, and each other’s company just seemed so natural, not forced like others. He let out a pleased sound, a soft whine as he felt Steve's mouth closing around his sensitive nipple.
Everyone that was still in the saloon turned to look, examining his attire, watching as the stranger placed his hands over his belt and pushed back his coat, walking over to the bar and sitting on a stool.
Everyone knew who both these men were, the Starks were one of the wealthiest families still around and Stark Industries got famous during the 40’s, with Howard Stark’s involvement in the war. He should have guessed that his son would carry on the family tradition, even though Steve only saw his interviews in different magazines and didn’t know what to make off him. He seemed like a type of person that he wouldn’t normally approach and befriend.
Tony watched how sleepy the man was, smiling at him even though Steve's eyes were shut, gently stroking his hand over Steve's skin, enjoying his company and the warmth of another human being next to him for once. “You know, I really like you," he said as he closed his own eyes, not sure if he wished for Steve to listen to him.
Though he honestly had no idea what he would teach Tony, he knew that even if the man kept his mouth shut, he’d always compare their cities and see Steve's as inferior. Initially, Steve had approached with hopes that the Spartan would see them as equals, but he had been quickly shut down and put in his place, and now was not ready to suffer the heartache again. He truly had nothing else to give - nothing that Sparta wasn’t ‘better at’.
Tony lowered his eyes and held his medallion up for Steve to examine. “Did you notice it glowing it in the night? You were probably exhausted but it is bright enough for me to walk outside during the night and see in front of me. That’s not its primary function, of course; it keeps me alive," he explained. “Without it, I’m pretty defenceless. I don’t think I could survive all this training without it."
The heels of Steve's palms were digging into the bed as he threw his head back to the thrusts, feeling his body being pushed forward with the weight of them, his back tensing up. It was taking more and more effort to keep himself up and his hair swung messily as he opened his mouth, his eyes half lidded as he groaned loudly, still getting used to the feeling. But it was more about the bond, the fact that his man was inside him, that he found more pleasing.
“And why don’t you tell me more about your people?” Tony replied, equally as irate. “Every time I say something, you just take it like an insult. You don’t try to defend your people, prove me wrong; you keep giving up, and I never thought the son of Athena would act like that.”
“Should I call Miss Potts, Sir?”, Jarvis suggested.
“Even if that’s exciting, no,” Tony said. “Believe it or not, I find more fascinating the fact that you stood up to me, you really were different from others that came before.”
Tony held onto that kiss. He had thought he'd never get the chance to do it again. “And I will be more than just enough, I swear," He reassured him.
And they continued to ride towards his home town, staying quiet for the rest of the journey, still thinking of what happened while they were talking in Thebes. It felt so strange, so comforting, and when Steve finally touched him, it had felt so right.
Tony heard him, the revelation surprising him. “You did what? You spoke with the fates? Is that why you came here? To change your people’s destiny rather than changing our ways?” he asked as he took a few steps closer again. “Why didn’t you just say so? Why didn’t you let me know of what’s going to happen?”
“In truth?” Steve asked, looking at Tony.
“Do you like it? I thought we should give this a go, maybe our love will last longer now”, Steve joked, lacing the lock on an empty spot against the cold metal, jumping a bit back to admire his work.
“I don’t know why you’re even thinking that this will actually happen, Obi”, Tony said quite confidently. “Steve isn’t up for any experimenting, and the serum isn’t going to be replicated, not now or ever”
“As a child, I was very sick and my mother is the one who pulled my soul from the river Styx, before it had met its end,” Steve said. “Before the fates could sever my thread entirely, she saved me. So I am in her eternal debt, as her son.”
But then, as soon as he announced the future project of Stark Resilient that was back to is feet to rebuild Asgard, she came. The daughter of one of Steve’s mortal enemies, Sin, threatened their world yet again. They couldn’t really catch a break, especially after the Siege of Asgard, but everything seemed to have taken a different turn when Captain America was killed. Tony himself had just come back from Paris and didn’t really take the subject well, but he knew that there was one person sitting in the corner that couldn’t deal with this alone. Steve was deep in thought and Tony approached him, but knew from experience that he wouldn’t take much out of him, and their duty called. He didn’t have time to mourn the loss of his friend again; they had their world to save. Before he could say anything at all, Tony started talking with Steve and Thor, planning yet again and Tony parted ways, requesting help from Odin, but not before seeing his Captain taking the mantle again.
Tony groaned in return, holding firmly onto him to start thrusting inside, drops of sweat already forming on his forehead at the tight heat of Steve around him. “Steve...” he growled after every thrust, wanting to keep hearing the sounds the man under him was making.
The billionaire in the black and golden suit stared at the man’s tensed figure as the doors shut behind him.
“Tooth Fairy!”, the man shrieked as he was released, only because Steve wasn’t sure if he was dreaming or hallucinating.
“Once a Spartan, always a Spartan,” Falcon grimaced, and Steve shook his head,
Steve chuckled, stretching his arms and moving closer to one of the punching bags in the middle of the gym. He hopped a bit in place, which was surprisingly easy to do, throwing a few punches in the air. He was holding back from kicking just yet, but he could tell that Tony was waiting for that moment, wanting to put his work at the test.
“Why are you even apologising?” Tony said with a soft smile, closing his eyes at the kiss. “That’s not difficult at all, I consider myself incredibly lucky. If you think about it, I have to be special to have you deal with me, right?”
“We were assigned to do other things, and I’m sticking with that”, Steve said, looking down at him while they were standing opposite from each other.
Tony nodded, getting to his feet and taking their supplies with him again, glancing at the view once more. “Lead the way to the chariot then.”
“Only if you tell me more about your medallion,” Steve said, gesturing to it. “It glows so brightly it’s become hard for me to keep my eyes from it.”
Steve stayed quiet; he still had his doubts, but to hear Tony saying those words really did help him. Turning around, he wrapped his arms around Tony for a moment, in which the shorter man responded with an awkward pat on the back.
The lights of the Eiffel Tower were on, lighting the whole city, the warm, orange light emerging from it making the metallic structure ten times more beautiful to Steve’s eyes than it did earlier in the morning.
Steve couldn’t help but smile as he lifted his hand to his face to rub it over his mouth. “Perhaps I should rather not say,” he muttered.
“Steve..?”, Tony’s voice interrupted him yet again. “We’re here..”, he said as he pointed at the large, black gates just outside the car.
Steve shut his eyes again, taking in a deep breath as the night breeze swept by and sent a shudder down his spine as he moved a bit closer to the fire for warmth. “Not just flattery,” he said. “Very beautifully worded flattery.”
Steve nodded.
“I can say the same about you,” Tony pointed out. “You seemed eager to have me in Athens as well.”
“Come on, don’t be so difficult. I’ve read your files, you don’t really have a place of your own after you came back from your round. We’re offering you a new life and a home, Rogers. You should at least consider it, spend tonight there.”
Most of the time he blamed it on the heat of the moment, their sweaty and exhausted bodies high on adrenaline perhaps seeing things that weren’t exactly there, his more..animalistic urges coming out when they both were at their most vulnerable state. And most of those times, he couldn’t help but think that Tony was throwing him an invitation of sorts, by how he loomed over him, lips apart, with no intention of moving.
“Can I let go of you?”, he asked Steve, and with his approval, he moved back, feeling proud as he witnessed the veteran slowly walking towards the bed again without his help, his steps becoming more sure and stable.
When Steve seemed more relaxed, Tony pulled his lips away for a second to lick his own fingers, coating them with saliva before moving back again, his index finger pressing slightly inside Steve.
“Right, let’s move on!”
“Oh, I’m starting to want you to make me”, Tony said, risking a cheeky grin.
But Tony frowned at how torn Steve clearly was, not sure what he had done to cause that distress. It looked so similar to the expression Steve had worn the night before. “Steve? I have to tell you some things," he finally said, sitting up, even though Steve was still above him, wanting to come clean. Maybe telling him what he really thought on the matter would cause Steve to leave, but he couldn’t stop feeling as though he was taking advantage of the man’s innocence, a thought that only filled his heart with guilt.
This wasn't what he wanted to hear; his failures, his inability to save Tony, to hear that their argument was the reason why all this was happening was killing him, little by little.
His morning routine involved him putting on a neutral face and wheeling into the main sitting area, conversing with the others, especially with another soldier around his age who was missing an arm. He seemed to be more accepting of his disability, then again, Steve would remind himself, he could walk. His daily life didn’t change to such an extreme level, but he sworn that the guy, James, offered to stay longer in the hospital to be closer to the people he befriended.
He couldn’t afford thinking so fondly of his past, not when he had no idea what happened to any of those friends and allied, but yet he found himself lured into that room, full of memories that made him smile and just wish he could go back where he truly belonged.
He coughed, his vision going blurry, but the he heard the gunshot and saw Steve jumping in, pushing her off him. It wasn’t a fatal shot, he got her shoulder, but it would definitely be a wound that would slow her down.
Steve smiled proudly, placing his most beloved possession back from where he had retrieved it. “I’m honoured you say such things,” he said, picking up his helmet which was a faint blue. The metal had been tinted as it was made, with large silver wings either side and he put it on, turning to look at Tony. “I tend to like being around my items of protection,” he said proudly.
Tony panted from the inside of the suit when he saw Steve pushing further inside him, asking for more, being obedient; he could never imagine the Captain being like that, besides those fantasies of him that he had in the back of his head. “I’m merely what Captain Rogers wants me to be”, he encouraged him, finding it hard to hide his identity every passing minute, wanting to be the one to please Steve, not any mere suit. He picked up the pace and made the vibration harder, going deeper into Steve’s body.
That wasn’t Tony’s intention, he funded the program and was so personally involved in it so he could help people, so those new prosthetics could open the way for more affordable and efficient cybernetic technology. He wanted to make it broader, help individuals who were missing limbs due to legit accidents or were born with those casualties. Suddenly he felt sick to his stomach, disgusted by his own actions, not wanting to do anything with this ever again. No, he had to inform Steve, face Zola and Tarleton, demand some answers and make them face the consequences. He couldn’t believe that something like this was happening right before his eyes and he had no idea. Still in shock, he ran outside the bedroom, bumping into a muscled chest and looking up to Steve who was looking at him curiously.
“I would prefer not to be referred as such from now on..Colonel”, Steve cut him, taking a look at Rhodey’s jacket, clearly able to tell his rank.
“I’m pretty sure they have a gym on the second floor that you can use while I’m away”, Tony yawned, the jet lag always being present even though Steve seemed to be absolutely fine.
He looked around; it was too dark to tell how deep the hole was, and he didn’t want to waste their precious light. The location, however, seemed to match their destination.
Steve shook his head. “I try to tell you, but you just compare my people to yours again, deem yours above mine,” he said sharply, brow furrowed. “I do not give up easily, but I know when I am fighting a losing battle. I promise you nothing, you tarnish my promises with your words. You do nothing but disappoint me, Spartan; your feigned interest is not what I want. I expect those who I teach to listen, not supersede.”
“I still think that you should bring those back, they’re a good look…”
“Are you trying to confess to me, Tony?”, he asked him quite bluntly, which cause Tony to blink and cough nervously.
“Yeah, of course, like always they thought I don’t speak French and I pretty much showed them all. I really put up a good show”, Tony giggled, holding the door open for them.
Steve heard the automated voice again and he raised his head to look the suit in the eyes, thinking it was his dizzy state of lust making him hear such things as his body began to move up and down, catching a rhythm on the vibrating length inside him, his moans became more frequent as beads of sweat trickled down each bump, over his defined muscles that were tensing and relaxing to each movement. His blonde hair appearing dark as it was dampened by sweat, clinging to his skin.
“Yeah, I really enjoyed the jokes and everything,” he nodded, making his way out of the theatre with Steve walking alongside him. “It’s a shame we don’t have this back home."
“We’re not really going to walk,” he said as he jumped on it, moving a bit so Steve could join him.
“And I'm sure that he’ll try. I can save my own skin. And I've got Rhodey on my back. Not to mention the Avengers.”
“All right.. If I’m being perfectly honest here.. I’ve felt like this for a while”, Tony started, taking a deep breath. “It was mostly confusing, I mean, I didn’t know if I exactly felt the same way about you the way I felt about certain ladies, you know? And every time I thought that I was about to settle down.. something came up, always. After Rumiko, after the war, I thought that it was.. gone, that I couldn’t actually speak up or feel this way about you”
He hesitated a moment before walking up to Tony awkwardly, and he leaned down just as hesitantly. He stopped halfway, still unsure, and then he seemed to make up his mind, kissing Tony’s cheek in return.
“But it is worth it, really, to see such happy faces amongst the crowds?” Steve said softly, and Tony nodded in agreement.
“Why are you so stubborn?” he sighed. “You said that I’m a mule, but you’re acting like one right now. Teach and be taught, isn’t what we agreed? I was having a conversation with you, Steve, no need to get all sensitive about it.”
“You erased my memories… All of you, you gave the final call… Didn't you? You’re not any better than the tyrants we’re fighting against, not better at all. I had only one condition; to be present, to watch over those meetings, but you just had to get rid of me, haven’t you? All those promises, everything that you told me about is fighting together, united against the common threat… All those were lies… Isn't that right, brother?”
“People think that they understand, that they get how you feel locked alone with only the darkest thoughts with you, hoping that someone will take you out of your misery soon enough, but only getting the slight taste of pain before they pause, leaving you to suffer, then repeat. People suddenly rescue you and you don’t realise what is happening, you can’t tell reality apart from the nightmare that you’ve been leaving. They invite you to places, expect you to talk about it, or to be just fine, to get over all of it. That it doesn’t just go away, that you need to smile or whatever and feel better.”
“You’re.. you’re Captain America”, Tony replied, looking at him from head to toe, from the star in the middle of his uniform to the shiny shield.
He tipped the driver, sighed at Steve who insisted to carry their bags all the way to their room, or better their suite, despite Tony protesting that the hotel workers were trained for this.
He found Reed waiting in his lab, pacing around nervously. Steve wasn't good dealing with those scientist minds and he hated the way some of them would look down to him, forgetting that he was just as smart. The man had horrible black circles under his eyes, which instinctively cause Steve to rub his own eyes; he knew that it was pointless, his own black circles and slightly red eyes were too obvious.
“You made this?” Steve asked with surprise, seeing how well-crafted it was. “You have a talent my friend.”
Steve looked at him, almost shocked by Tony's admission. He knew exactly how that felt, especially with the loss of so many people; in truth he had led a lonely life and without Falcon would have lived a lonelier one still. His mother didn’t want to promise him to anyone, since he was her child and he was to remain pure, just as she was.
The car ride was relatively quiet, and the closer they seemed to be to Brooklyn, the more tensed Steve was getting.
So this was the new century.. The future he fought for seemed so disappointing to look at, and if he were to take Tony’s words at heart.. he knew he would end up being more hurt. He didn’t even have time to think about his past yet, what happened to his friends, his allies, even his beloved. The thought that they might have been out there, alive, but changed, even not remembering him really made his chest ache. He didn’t want to be left out.. to be a man out of time, because that was exactly how he was feeling at that moment; broken, lost, alone. Sure, Tony offered his help, but he wasn’t Bucky, he wasn’t any of the Howling Commandos and most of all, he wasn’t Peggy. He didn’t know if he would dare ask for Tony’s help to find out what happened to all of them, if he even wanted to know.. but he knew he had to do it, he had to know if he could move on or not.
“You don’t have to deal with this, I got it”, Steve replied, sounding agitated. “I think it’s better for you to get some sleep now”
“I can imagine you doing that, it sounds like you”, Steve said as he turned his attention to the screen.
“I’m here, Steve, everything is okay, I can stop any time,” Tony said slowly, stopping the pressure when he felt Steve tightening around him. “Just relax. Breathe,” he said, kissing Steve's tensed back.
Tony nodded, even if Steve couldn’t see him, his head buried into his chest. He was fine with that, and just like Steve told him, if that was his personal Hell, he couldn’t wait to see how their mutual Paradise would be.
Upon hearing those words, Steve snapped out of the mesmerising stare he was giving Tony, pulling back and shaking his head.
“Is that… an Iron Man suit…?”, Steve asked, eyes focused on the screen.
“Mr. Stark would now show you what I can offer you”, he said as the front of the suit seemed to pull back, the area between the legs revealing a length, long creation, still bearing the bright red colour of the rest of the suit.
“Now that you’re here, yes”, he blurted out. “I mean, it’s good to know that you’re back in one piece, Cap.”
“You have proven that you pride yourself in violence, and once more that you feed on fear,” Steve said with a stern glare. “There is not much more to it. You were only willing to accept once you had broken me down; I don’t need pity from you.”
Loving Steve Rogers was meant to be.
“Got it!”, Tony nodded, firing his repulsors against the force field that seemed to protect Kang, avoiding the rays shooting from his gun.
“We have freedom, we’re not slaves!” Tony said indignantly, even if Steve's words made him consider questioning it. “We have all the rights...well, the Helots don’t...but we have full Spartan rights, and we’re raised to believe that that’s what really matters. We express ourselves, it’s just not the same way you do."
“It won’t work,Tony.. Not for us..”, Steve’s voice was heard from the corner of the room, leaning against the wall next to the bedroom door.
“Zola and... Zola and Tarleton staged the whole thing, this project isn’t real! The accidents.. the candidates, they are all behind them, they are the ones who took your legs away from you, they planned it so you would end joining this project, that they would experiment on you the way they wanted, that they would get those new super soldiers the hard way-”
Steve scrutinized it.
“Looks like it to me.. I don’t believe in Heaven, but.. this, right here and now with you? This is Heaven”, Tony said, and Steve didn’t hesitate to reply to that with another gentle kiss.
“I'll always need to remind you how people in Sparta see me, won't I? I am the son of Ares, a supplier of weapons - weapons that kill and bring honour to us. I am a merchant of death and I can’t afford being soft around them or they’ll eat me alive,” Tony shrugged. “And yet you say it’s all right to have a softer side, that war isn’t always the answer, that is good to laugh every now and then and let your weapons down to sit and watch a play.”
“So you’re keeping me here against my will? I knew that you were kidnapping me! Aren't you supposed to be Captain America or whatever? Where’s my right to be free? You’re keeping me here confined and away from my own world, my people!”, Tony replied, his own voice rising.
As he turned his gaze away from the window, he rolled on his side, using his upper body strenght to get himself sitting up, dragging the wheelchair closer. With precise, mechanical movements, he lifted himself up and sat on the chair, his eyes turning on the full body mirror. The scars on his face were healed, as well as the injuries on his chest and arms. Everything looked normal until he moved to his legs, or rather, where his legs used to be. His knees were covered in bandages, and that was it, there was nothing left lower than that. He hated the looks of sympathy that he would get, the realisation that he would never walk again, got for his morning runs, anything. He wheeled the chair away, not wanting to look at himself again.
“Thanks...?”, Steve started as he turned towards him, realising that he didn’t catch his name yet.
“I ’like’ you too.” Steve whispered in return, smiling to himself.
Tony looked up to him, keeping his hand in place as he watched Steve’s flushed cheeks, smiling at him faintly. “Don’t tell me that you never did this before?” he asked, one eyebrow raised. “On your own?”
His chin was tugged down whilst his hand pawed over Tony’s reactor, the bright light that kept him going. Steve tilted his head forward, trying to shake the hair out of his face as he felt himself on the verge of finishing, hungrily kissing Tony only to break it moments later, calling out Tony’s name as he clutched to the metal chest plate as hard as he could, his body tensing finally before climaxing. With a loud pant he slumped forward and rested on the large metallic suit, counting on the cold metal to cool him down, even though by now the metal was warm from all of the movement.
“I’ll see if I can come around tonight”, he finally nodded, making Tony sigh with relief internally. No, he didn’t hope that he would come, he just needed to keep the bar buzzing, and the new Sheriff having a drink with Tony Stark would sure cause some talk. Not that he cared; even better, it would actually attract more people. After all, whenever he liked it or not, he was relying on that man from now on when it came to safety.
“Happy..? Mr. Stark-”
Steve shook his head. “Never,” he said, brushing a hand through his hair. “I have my own baths.”
“Steve? Are you okay?”
“How long did you know?”
Tony heard the order given and moved forward in an attack, looking out for Steve in the crowd. It wasn’t hard to spot him - his bright colours and unique armour made him stand out - and Tony started to make his way towards him, avoiding the arrows of the Athenian archers, spearing anyone who was in his path. If he couldn’t protect Steve, he could at least make his father proud once, seizing the city he wanted so desperately under his control.
Steve nodded to him to show that he was thankful, but the words weren’t reassuring in the slightest, if one thing, they made him feel even worse. He kept quiet until the helicopter was clear for landing on the pad on the top of the tall tower, Tony sighing in relief once he stepped outside.
“I wouldn’t say that I’m bitter,” Tony said with a shake of his head. “Just don’t judge a book by its cover. I may not be the man you thought I was.”
Steve took Tony everywhere he could, wanting to show him around, thoroughly enjoying Tony's company. While they were at the temple, Steve took the time to look up at the large statue of his mother, internally questioning why he should feel this way about someone if she had forbidden him to love.
As the scientists were placing him on the table, Steve closed his eyes, trying to think of what the outcome, of the endless possibilities that he would receive. He was left in a pair of black underpants, his missing legs fully exposed, his head prompted up as more people in labcoats and surgical masks stepped into the room. Before he knew it, a mask was placed on top of his mouth, and he slowly lost consciousness, Tony’s face smiling encouragingly to him being the last thing he saw.
“It is a sign, it must be,” Steve said, staring at Tony, not wanting to move from where they were.
Tony shook his shoulders. “Whatever suits you”, he said as he turned to Pepper again. “Did you come all the way down here just to greet me? I’m flattered”
Tony wasn’t exactly a man of patience, and Steve’s defensive attitude wasn’t something he was willing to accept, especially after that night. He quickly hopped over the bed and stood over the blonde, looking down at him.
Despite the hard training, his body still looked more fragile than the rest of the boys, and even when he grew up to be a proud Spartan, spending time training and helping to rule the city, his body wasn’t particularly shaped like the others. Still, he was treated with respect, as Ares chose him as his representative, guiding him and giving him privileges that notmany mortal men were allowed to even lay eyes on. Being a lover of war and combat, Ares allowed Tony to be taught by Hephaestus himself, mastering the art of forging powerful weapons, spears, shield and swords. As a parting gift, he was handed a medallion, bound to protect him during battle, which he proudly wore on his chest where it resonated a faint glow.
Tony had lost count of the weeks he spent in that strange, new universe. He was starting to fall apart, but tried his hardest not to let it show. He really did feel like a prisoner, like he was back in that cave, kept there against his will because others wanted to use him. This was no different, apparently he was needed for a reason that was beyond his understanding, or, safer to say, beyond on what they would let him know.
Steve nodded. “I’d like that,” he said, glancing up at Tony.
“But then you said that you want privacy," Tony repeated, getting confused, walking closer to Steve carefully like a cat unsure of its prey. He knew to gauge Steve’s reaction carefully before he couldn't stand to wait any longer, reaching out to push the strands of hair back behind Steve's ears.
“What you search for, they are questions that I don’t know the answer to. Pray hard, Spartan, you may eventually find what you seek,” he said, slowly letting go of Tony’s shoulders to look down at him, his heart feeling heavy with guilt. He hated men who were proud, and yet he was proud himself. But one day he knew he would be able to get past his own pride. Tony’s was another matter entirely.
“You don’t know me,” Tony sighed in frustration. “You don’t know me at all. Do you want to risk it? What do you have to lose?”
“So you need a companion but don’t want to forget your duties?” Tony asked, moving a little closer. “And who said that you can’t do both?”
“I enjoy affection,” Steve said, leaning closer to Tony again to pressing their lips together once more, trying to categorize the feeling. It was more than just happiness, it was an emotion he couldn’t place and he pulled back only scant inches before leaning forward to do it again. They were still just gentle kisses, becoming briefer every time he pulled back. And Steve smiled after his final kiss. “I really enjoy this.”
“No, I don’t think so. I'm pretty sure that we all expect anything from that guy…”
“I mean, we’re doing just fine with you not talking, right? You can understand me so it’s all good”, Tony continued.
They were only getting started.
“I am as old as you think I am. And no, I’m... No,” he said shaking his head, not wanting to admit that he was forbidden to be married to anyone in order to remain pure and untouched, following in his mother's footsteps. “I am as my mother wishes me to be.”
That’s why when he saw the first opportunity to jump in another adventure, he didn’t think twice about it. He needed to be quiet about it though, he attracted too much attention lately, so his usual associates just wouldn’t do it this time around. And that was when the Commander walked into his office. Dressed in a dark blue waistcoat, blonde hair slicked back and having the posture of an obviously military experienced man.
The voice surely made Reed uncomfortable, but Steve narrowed his eyes, approaching with caution. He recognised that voice, but he couldn't remember where he heard it before, and the video was too dark, most likely on purpose.
“I understand sarcasm,” Steve said pouting a little at his brushed off attempt to compliment him.
“You have a way; you could have anyone you please with your charms,” Steve said.
Tony hummed at Steve’s reply; he couldn’t be any happier, and he still didn’t know exactly why. Why was this man making his heart flutter with a simple smile or the words he said? But it didn't matter why. Tony didn’t want it to go away, and he held onto Steve tightly, shutting his own eyes and letting Morpheus come to him.
Tony pulled up again; watching him carefully as he stroked Steve's flushed cheeks softly. “You can think about it all you want,” Tony reassured him, pressing a soft kiss to Steve's cheek, “I’m still going to be here waiting."
Steve looked at the images and stood up, walking next to the engineer and smiled. “Just for the record, I didn’t say that. It’s way too cheesy..”
The other scientist walked forward, opening his suitcase and taking out a small tablet.
“Real thing? Well, catch your breath and I would like us to try it... I’m ready for it when you are, Captain”, Tony replied with another chuckle. He couldn’t stay mad at him, not when their relationship seemed to have taken another spin for the better, now that he was allowed to take control. “It had to be me, it had to be me to see your face when you would finish”, he said after a small pause, excusing himself.
They kept walking, stopping from time to time to rest under the shade of trees, or even share to their bread together while chatting animatedly. And Steve enjoyed the journey with Tony; it was very rare that he would have company of any sort.
Tony let Steve do as he pleased, lowering his own walls and just letting Steve to hold him and kiss him, clearly in not so friendly a fashion any more, his own hands wrapped around the man’s waist as he kissed him, tongue so warm in his mouth.
Tony slowed down his pace; breathing softly as he noticed Steve’s reaction, giving him small, quick kisses. “It’s all right,” he murmured, “I can do this.” He pulled away and focused on Steve’s mouth again, kissing him deeply and slowly. Would Steve want what he planned to do next?
“What happened...?"
“I’ve got him, it’s fine”, another female voice was heard.
Reed nodded, walking close to the wall and focusing on his panel.
He was a Spartan, he would do anything to lead his people to victory, but kill the man in front of him now that the met him? It didn’t sound like something that he would do, if Steve never came here and he saw him during the heat of the battle. Things would have been different, but now it was a different case. “I believe that we can change that,” he said, more firmly this time. “No, I want to change that”
“Rogers…?”, he asked as he sat up. He felt so tensed up, like he had been exercising for a whole day and he just realised how tired he really was.
Why was he even thinking about those things?
“Tell me about your training,” Steve said, his fingertips moving along Tony’s ribs, finding himself eager to touch him more.
They could hear the shouting, missed shots behind them, but they were making their way outside the deeper parts of the cave as fast as they could. Whitney would have without a doubt cut their rope down, but she must have left something there to help her and her men up again.
Tony shivered when he felt Steve’s firm hand gripping his own, their eyes meeting for that split second, before Tony turned his head away quickly, smiling.
“Save your breath, Blondie. I'm not going to sit around and be your lab rat, that’s your job”, Tony said, pointing at Steve.
“I thought Nickie told you all about me”, Tony replied, crossing his arms.
“I’m fine with staying here”, Steve said as he closed the bedroom door behind him. “You don’t normally eat with me though..?”
“I’m not disappointed,” Tony answered, “even though I enjoy being around Steve.”
Tony raised an eyebrow, offering his hand to Steve for a firm handshake. “Strong hand, then again, I didn’t expect any different. Tony Stark, I’m sure that you gathered that, but there’s no harm in introducing myself. I’m the man who funds this whole project. I don’t want to brag, but.. without my support, this would probably end up going down in flames.”
Tony’s chest felt heavy; this might not have been him, but to think that he died in this universe really was a shock. “And why should I trust you then? If you got him killed, you’ll do the same to me, won’t you? I can look after my own self just fine!”
Tony nodded to him as he stood up, his gun having charged again and fired towards the direction of the scientists who tried to reach the controller. Hitting the one on the floor on the face with the back of the gun, he grabbed the controller, turning towards Steve and setting his legs back in motion.
The sight was still overwhelming for Steve, and he doubted that he could get used to seeing his city like that. He was expected to adjust, and he knew that he was going to do that eventually, but for now he was mostly silent, still trying to realise what was going on, what this new life would mean to him. Part of him just wanted to believe that all this was a bad nightmare, that he was never awaken from his frozen slumber, that all this was just his mind playing tricks to him, but the sights and Tony talking to him about this new future was like a slap from reality across his face.
“Perhaps I should return to Athens.”
“I want to visit Athens, will you stop me?” Tony said, scoffing at the soft kiss on his head. “And be with you. I mean, enjoy your company."
Steve cradled the scrolls instead, so he could use one arm to hold them and keep the other free. “And if they don’t?” he asked.
“I’m not him, sadly. You’ll have to deal with me and what I’m saying is that I ain’t moving from here until I make sure that all the resources have been accounted for. We can’t afford losing the slightest of them now, do we?”, Tony replied as he stepped into a tent, that looked nothing like a tent after all. It was huge, full of wires and computer screens, satellite disks just sitting outside; it was his temporary home, and he did his best to have his signature mark over everything, including the bed that was nothing like the rest of the bunk beds in all other tents. Everything screamed Tony Stark, the etiquettes on the clothes, the computer screens, the faint smell of good brandy in the air.
He smiled, got inside his car and Bruce joined him, all parting ways but knowing that this wouldn’t last long. One way or another, they would end up together again. Because the world needed them to.
“Yes, it’s really beautiful here, it gives you a strange sense...” He scratched his head, feeling again that familiar buzz at Steve's touch. “I don’t know exactly how to say this. It brings you close to Mountain Olympus in a way, even if I have no relations to Athena."
Steve nodded blankly; he was tired already, exhausted after seeing corpses of his best friend, and all this secrecy between him and Reed, the slow revealing process of more events was tiring him. What else could be there to shake him even more?
“You know, I had those for a while when I started performing back in the day. Didn't last long…”, Steve scratched his head.
“Of course I am. I'm going home, away from this lunatic world.”
Steve smiled and looked at Tony, noticing the look in his eyes. “Do you wish to return to Sparta?”
“Uh...”, Steve said, rubbing the back of his head. “I just..”
“Yeah, those are real alright, let go off me now!”
From time to time, he noticed Steve looking at him carefully, perhaps having second doubts about bringing him along. But something about the way Steve smiled seemed to ease his doubts. “You know, I can understand why you like living here,” Tony said after a while, walking next to Steve once again.
“That’s big coming from you, you know. That’s for thinking that you would give yourself to anyone else but me..”, he said in his more possessive tone, his hands moving to rub Steve’s back, glad to be finally acknowledged.
“Athletics are our training,” he said, walking down to the large structure. “We choose to partake in the arts. It educates us, and future generations.”
After their first hesitant kiss and fight, Tony was almost sure that this was going to be a love-hate relationship. He didn’t hate the Captain, how could he hate America’s most loved hero? No, he hated so much he
The facility was hidden, but Steve didn’t expect any less from the organisation that called themselves S.H.I.E.L.D. At first he thought that they were heading towards his former training camp, driving outside the city, past the tall buildings and the huge tower that belonged to Tony Stark’s company, but they suddenly took what Steve would consider a wrong turn, ending up in an abandoned factory. The doctors offered to help him out of the car and on his wheelchair, but Steve firmly declined, settling himself down. Immediately he spotted the sign that had fallen on the side over the course of years; Stark was behind this. Not the Stark that he saw this day in the news, but his father. So the place that they chose as their base of operation for this mysterious new project was an old facility provided by Tony Stark, he should have guessed that.
Steve led the horses back to Sparta, through the long journey under the already dark sky, his hair flying back as they moved with speed. Occasionally, he glanced over his shoulder at Tony, giving him that warm comforting smile to reassure him he was safe as he held on.
Still, when Steve turned around he could hardly hide his shock, eyes scanning him from head to toe, taking in every single detail that made Tony Stark who he was.
“It does, I suppose,” Steve said, gently pulling his hand back to rest it against his own side, but not before taking his time to admire the way Tony’s eyes fluttered shut, feeling soft breath dance along his skin. “Your men are probably inquiring after your whereabouts.”
“Well, now you know,” Tony replied. “And you can take your earlier assumptions back. You’re not like any of my ‘women.’”
“If your ties with the fates are as tightly knitted as you say they are, then why have you not done so already? Why does Athens still stand? Do not claim it is mercy or pity; you Spartans fail to possess the slightest bit of empathy in your vindictive, blackened hearts.”
“Thought that I would do what?” Tony asked. “Kill, drink and sleep with women every single night? It didn’t sit with me well, nor did I want it to.”
The Captain did feel like an idiot; he was shouting and insulting Tony and right now he was promising him that he was going to help him until the end of the line. It was the right thing to do, right? Maybe Tony would forgive him if he swallowed down his pride and put everything at side to save everyone. This was about every Tony’s life out there, and he couldn't help but think that different version of his own self were out there, mourning the loss of Tony, looking for him.
“It’s really beautiful, I really think that," Tony continued, trailing his fingers across the image, admiring the detail that Steve put in his work as he tried to get used to the sweet weight on his shoulder.
“Talk. You know, justtalk, most of the time. The children perform sometimes, recite war stories...we have many athletic events as well," he said and Steve nodded.
Steve couldn’t help but scope the area again before tugging off his black belt with a silver star buckle and unzipping his trousers, slipping them off and letting the constricting feeling of the denim brush over his legs as he took them off, along with his shoes and socks, making sure they were neatly folded by his t-shirt. He stepped in front of the suit, in nothing but his black boxers with the ‘Stark Industries’ brand logo over the elastic of them, Tony had gotten them for him for Christmas and strangely they were a bit too tight, but Tony had always insisted that was the style nowadays and that he had to wear them more often to get used to the feeling.
Tony had to hold himself back from huffing, but the suit persona had to stay up, at least for a bit more.
It’s not like Tony didn’t know that he had to do that, it was reckless and plain stupid to reject the advice, or rather, order that he was given, wondering if keeping his helmet on could be an option. Steve hardly saw him shirtless, he normally wore gym appropriate clothes when training together. And it wasn’t like Steve gawked at his body (or did he??) to remember how he was shaped like under his clothes.
“Stop pretending that you know me! I'm not the person that you knew, all right? I'm different, and I owe nothing to you!”
The way the man spoke send a shiver down Steve’s back; it felt like he was back during the war and hearing the Red Skull, Zola or Baron Zemo, any of the villains he had to fight, yelling petty words and promises of revenge to him and Bucky. That was surely not a good sign, and he turned to Tony who seemed pretty unphased by the whole argument.
“I...I am flying”, he repeated, trying to test the functions, sending a bit more boost on the jets, getting a bit higher.
And Steve braced himself. Knowing that the man was in front of his people again, he expected Tony’s attitude to switch back into that of the son of Ares, his eyes lowering at the thought of it.
“Why would I joke?” Steve asked. “Your training is admirable, and you’re keeping us both warm.”
Steve snorted. “So, you came for this?”, he asked, pointing at the napkin.
“You’re a ...? Fairy?”
“Cybernetics...?”, Steve asked.
Some people, especially the ones close to him saw it as a flaw.
“This is.. amazingly beautiful”, he said, stunned by the beauty of the travelling light on top of the tower. “Thank you, Tony”, he added, pulling him in a warm hug, his hands tightening around the older man’s back.
“I’m not comparing, at least not now,” Tony said. “Your words are full of venom, Athenian. You think my interested is feigned, but you know nothing about me, you let me show you nothing at all. You consider this battle a lost one before it’s even started.”
“Feels good to finally say it.. huh?”, Tony said as he wrapped his arms around the soldier; this was better than he ever dreamt of, and he did dream about it too much.
“I can come in disguise?” Tony suggested, not wanting to part ways with Steve even for a moment.
Steve wrapped his arms around himself tightly. “I would’ve liked to think otherwise, so far I seem to be hoping that that will be the truth,” he said, “but alas I seem to be mistaken yet again.”
“Oh, it was very pleasant indeed.” Steve said, closing his eyes as he lifted the fabric of his tunic over his mouth to hide his smile.
“Well, if he’s out to get you, you should be worried too”, Steve simply said. “So, what does he want from you now?”
Tony looked right back to him, not sure what to do, or which of them should act first. “Do you want me to..?” he asked softly, giving Steve's arm a light squeeze
“Hey, Cap”, Tony greeted him, the sunglasses hiding his eyes.
Steve gasped in shock the moment Tony's lips pressed against his skin. It made the heat rise to his cheeks, and he raised his eyebrows as he pressed himself back against the door.
“What’s down there? Are you sure that this is the spot?”
The captain let out a long sigh, taking a moment to bury his face into his palms before maintaining his posture.
“However… there was another incident… I've managed to record this, and I’d rather have you watch the footage first before… I show you what really is going on.”
“Steve!”
Reed coughed, raising his hands in the air. “There’s something…more! I’ll show you, just let me go!”, he replied, not wanting to fight Steve back; it would only put him in a worse situation than he already was, and with what he was about to show Steve, he doubted that the Captain would keep his calm.
“There is no point of you venturing into my home. Do not lie to me and wish for their well-being when just days ago you were preaching their destruction.”
“But I am an Athenian, and I went against my people, and I made the first move,” Steve said, sighing to himself.
“I do.” Steve said softly, hugging the scrolls to his chest.
Tony hesitantly pulled back, lowering his gaze. “I’m glad you came, Athenian. No matter what happens, I hope that our paths cross again.”
Locking eyes with the man opposite him, Tony walked closer and cupped his cheeks, and before Steve could protest, pushing his lips against his own. It felt strange, but not in a bad way. Steve’s lips were still dry, but they tasted so sweet. What surprised him the most, was the fact that Steve didn’t push him back; he froze in place but after a split second, he kissed him right back, and boy, was he a good kisser. Tony tasted of expensive chapstick, nothing like Sharon did, but yet, he found it strangely nice.
Tony lowered his gaze, nodding again with a heavy sigh, not really wanting to look at Steve in the eye, even if he knew that there was nothing wrong with that.
Steve shook his head and laughed. “Come on, we must study, you wish to learn the arts do you not?” he asked, his hand moving down the centre of Tony's torso. “Your body however, fascinates me. The anatomy is a wonderful marvel.”
“I offered you a chance to know me better than anyone, Athenian; I told you things I never considered before in my life. I didn’t ask you to come here to laugh at you, I asked you because I thought that your teaching could change this city for the best, I asked you to teach me first, and that’s what you did so far,” Tony huffed, feeling his heart sinking. “Maybe you’re right, maybe you are a fool, but you think so for the wrong reasons; you’re a fool for not giving people a second chance, for seeing only what’s on the surface”
“That’s the Eiffel Tower, Steve. I’m sure you would recognise it”, Tony said, head tilting to the side as Steve placed his head on his shoulder.
“Well, it was to throw you off guard,” Steve said, pulling back gently.
“Hmm?” Steve hummed, closing his eyes as nuzzled into Tony's neck.
Steve looked at him and then at the flowers, nodding thankfully and stepped inside the cemetery, walking along the graves with heavy heart. He recognised some of the names he passed by; men that fought by his side, kids who brought in smoked and magazines, and he couldn’t help but feel guilty; what if he was the reason why they were buried right here, six feet under? What if,because of him, he deprived some wife’s husband, or a child’s father? With heavy heart, he reached a corner of the graveyard and stood in front of the marbled tombstone. Peggy’s name was written on it, along with the date of her death, which upon further inspection, it was quite recent as well.
Steve let out a shaky moan, feeling his lips quiver as his eyes shut tightly, his toes curling. He was trying to listen to Tony as much as he could but he could feel his muscles being stretched out to the intrusion.
Steve's eyes closed, his head tilting back, eyebrows twitching and furrowing in an almost confused way, feeling this sensation for the first time. His legs moved restlessly, rubbing his feet together, his shoulders tensing up straight away, which didn’t go unnoticed by Tony.
“It’s a temporary solution”, Steve rushed to reply before Tony could even open his mouth. “Until I come up with something better”
“Hey, if that bacon isn’t eatable anymore, I’m going to make you chew it and just watch”, Steve laughed as he started to walk off.
Tony was standing nearby, not wanting to intrude into Steve’s privacy; he needed his time to mourn above all, and he could understand how he felt. He might have said that he didn’t shed a tear during his father’s funeral, but losing his mother was more of a hit to him, alongside Jarvis, his trusted butler and guardian. The AI was a mere tribute to the man who raised him and made him a better man that his father aimed him to be. Seeing Steve devastated like that was heartbreaking, his hero was proving himself to be human, with weaknesses just like him, and Tony only wanted to offer him some sort of comfort, not sure if he even allowed to do that.
It was then when Thor and Natasha rushed inside too, adding their own opinions on the matter, Natasha mainly warning them about Bruce, and him not taking it too well.
“Tony.. what is.. that?”, Steve asked carefully, letting go of the engineer and standing in front of him, shielding him from the potential threat.
“Mr Stark thought that you wouldn’t appreciate his own personal extravagant taste, so he had this place prepared for you”
“Yeah, good idea”, Tony replied, rushing outside the room with the Captain, protectively helping him up, his captain-like instincts kicking in.
“Around Peloponnese, yes, but closer to Athens?” Tony said with a shake of his head. “Not really.”
Tony followed Steve, sitting down beside him. “Let me take care of this," he muttered, and he disappeared.
Steve sighed. “So my debt is repaid? And you will ensure my people are safe? I have taught you enough?” he asked.
“The Captain..”, Obadiah said with a huff. “I’ve done my reading boy, you seem to forget that your father and I worked very closely”, he added when Tony seemed both surprised and annoyed. “So, do you have it inside you now, Captain? Is the serum still working?”
As soon as he was suited, he flew outside, giving orders at Steve, letting aside their argument for the sake of saving the Helicarrier, equally needing each other’s cooperation.
“Negative. No liquids are stored inside me”, he replied, the hands moving to rest on the knees of the suit. “Removing your clothes will be necessary, sir”
“Steve..?” Tony asked as he moved his fingers on Steve's chest again. “I need to make sure.”
“You know, I think I would just cut the wire”, he replied calmly, his expression showing nothing but hurt, and nobody in this room would realise that. Nobody here saw Tony feeling hurt before. Nobody was inside that cave, being tortured, having the first person that believed in him killed in front of him. Nobody saw him on that roof, his eyes close as his reactor was flickering, and none saw his efforts to save the city from Hammer and Vanko. It was unfair to him, nobody, and especially not Steve Rogers had the right to make those assumptions.
“Kang…”, Steve gritted his teeth. This was a threat that he didn't see coming, that was for sure.
Steve shook his head again. “It seems that your blood dictates your movements,” he said, lowering his eyes in disappointment.
“Yes, I tend to walk most places,” Steve said softly, flicking his hair back.
He nodded lightly, reaching out to push Tony’s hair back and out of his face.
“How can I help?” Steve asked. “I know little of friendship or customs such as those.”
Tony grabbed some water from the jar on the table; it was very much appreciated in that heat, and started mapping their trail straight away.
“Had a good sleep?”, he asked him.
The blonde wandered into the large lab, hearing the lights buzz back on as he walked in further, flicking a little before maintaining their bright glow. He didn’t know where to look whenever he walked into Tony’s lab; there was always so much to look at, so much to take in and never once was anything the same as his last visit. If anything remained exactly the same, then there was something wrong with Tony.
“Are you sure…?”
Tony offered him his hand to shake, standing up as well. “Consider it one, as we’re shaking hands,” he nodded.
“Yes,” Steve said, sitting up a little more. “You should lead the way out.”
Tony turned around right away and laughed, offering his hand to the tall, dark skinned man.
“Mr. Stark will be away for a couple of hours, sir, this won’t take long. However, if you want this to last for a longer period of time, I am built to satisfy those needs of you”, he replied sternly.
“Not bad at all! What about walking?”, Tony prompted him, and Steve could hear the eagerness in his voice.
Steve looked at him curiously and then raised his foot, staring at the little holes on the bottom.
“I’m sure that you’re just as good with a gun, Mr Stark”, Steve said with an honest nod of his head.
“I trusted you once, Anthony, I really did. I thought that you changed, after the War, I thought that you would anything, anything in your power to make things right, to avoid casualties at all cost. But no, you killed off more people than that Registration Act of yours ever did. You… all of you… Murderers… We could have saved them, both them and ourselves! Look around you now, Tony! Is this the Avengers World that we were building together? Is it?!”
“I would not only save my people, but yours. You would happily see your men die in battle? Lives lost? Cities, hard work, all gone? Is this honourable for you?” Steve asked in disbelief, taking a couple more steps back. He was trying to distance himself from Tony so that he wouldn’t lose his temper again.
“Farewell, son of Athena,” Tony said in a more genuine tone, not really wanting to move, watching Steve as he turned his back to him. “I hope our paths cross again."
Steve felt his heart sink at the words, looking down at the table before gathering his things together in his arms, taking Tony's words as a polite way of saying he was to leave.
“Captain, there is something that you need to see right away.”, the man’s voice wad heard when Steve finally answered his phone.
“I think luck has been on my side so far," Tony said. He smiled as he joined Steve, looking down at the beautiful view.
Tony looked down at him before he cupped Steve's face, leaning down to placing a kiss on his lips. He didn't pull himself back this time around; instead he carried on kissing him, licking his lips so desperately and so slowly, breathing through his nose so he didn't have to pull away.
Steve sighed a little, knowing he was going to regret his next action.
Steve sighed in relief as a red haired woman walked towards him, her bright red heels echoing on the marbled floor.
“So if I were to come to Sparta, you would treat me as you did, not as you are now?” Steve asked, looking over at Tony and turning to face him.
“Pull that lever, Cap!”, Tony yelled at some point, only to have himself beaten, relieved when Steve finally managed to listen to him, and Tony rushed to his side, blasting off the remaining threat. “What took you solong?”, he panted, taking off his helmet for fresh air.
“Very funny, I can take care of myself”, the billionaire said, but smirked once he turned his head around, getting in the snow vehicle that stopped in front of them. “Come on, hop in”, he promted the other man, as the large amount of trucks and helicopters followed them, heading far away from the camp.
“This morning, I noticed some strange readings on my dimensional scanner. I keep that working at all times, we can never be too safe with dimension hoppers these days”, Reed started to explain, talking way too fast. “At first I thought that we had another common visitor, or that some of our allies decided to use another portal, other than the ones I can provide you with. As soon as I got to the coordinates, I knew that I was right. We did have a visitor from an alternate dimension, but…”
A pause. A smirk.
“I thought I should fix that”, Tony chuckled, walking into the living room and settling down on the large sofa. “Have you ever tried japanese food, Steve?”, he asked him, bringing up a restaurant’s menu up on the holo screen.
“Do you want me to stop?” Tony asked in a low voice as he pulled back, his mouth close to the other nipple.  But he was waiting for Steve’s reply first, before he did anything, and Steve looked at him.
They walked inside the same large tent where the Captain was being kept, the rest of the crew members opening a path, their taser guns still aimed at the man, who didn’t try to hide his annoyance
Steve’s gaze softened. “No need to thank you, I’m just stating the truth here”, he replied as he got a bit closer to Tony. “You know.. when I lost my balance earlier and we fell into the pool.. I was focused, it was just the fact that you were, um, so close to me-”
“This? All this fuss over this? I don’t think so...hey!”
“It’s nearly 12, Stark, it’s hardly morning anymore”, Steve said with a raise of his eyebrow. He was up early anyway, he had a fixed morning routine, but he tried hard not to say anything to the yawning man in front of him.
“I promised that after this, I would give up this life but.. I get the feeling that I’m only getting started.”
“You? Captain America? You know how this feels?”, he asked in disbelief. It might sounded a bit childish, but he didn’t seem to care at that moment. He was still shaking and Steve was there, it should have been enough to calm him down.
And indeed, he kept his promise, interacting with Steve every now and then, but letting him keep his privacy, even though he could have sworn that sometimes the soldier seemed to want his company more than anything. Tony was willingly offering it to him, it was the least he could, and the two of them started to talk way more.
“And since when was that an insult?” Tony yelled at him, kicking a small stone away from him. “I protect my people with the way I deem necessary, but you refuse to acknowledge that and consider me ignorant instead. You’re the one who doesn’t give people any chance to prove themselves, son of Athena,"
Hours later, Steve was left with marks on his arms from the blood tests and some small bruises from all the tests that they made him go through. His head hurt, he didn’t expect them to have so many mental tests either, he had to answer so many series of questions, some simple, some others that had no idea how they were related to any of the procedures.
Tony pulled the table closer to them, and Steve noticed that it had a built in keyboard on it that he didn’t spot before. With a couple of swift hand movements, Tony made a blue window to appear on the air in front of them, typing quickly his password which Steve didn’t catch, distracted by the technology.
Steve swallowed again, this time much more audibly. He leaned back on the table, letting his lower back rest on the cold steel surface which sent shivers down his spine. He’d always secretly had a thing for Tony’s suits. Initially it started as a fear, then it evolved into a fascination the more he worked with him and the more he saw and then finally it turned into a love for them. Always admiring the intricate detailing and the small quirks that would be installed, always a mystery that he wanted to know more about. Tony even created a suit for him, the Iron Patriot, but it had been stolen, still that didn’t stop Tony from trying to build him a new one. His eyes couldn’t focus on the suits face and he kept his head turned, his blush now forming over his cheeks.
Being the son of famous Howard Stark wasn’t easy. Especially when you were declared as the prodigal son of the family, ignoring your father’s great achievements and using his name and wealth to fulfil your own irrelevant visions. Sure, Tony Stark was a genius and a rich fella, but he chose not to appreciate his father’s work with the government to build the Pacific Railroad, which gave Tony the opportunity to open his own saloon in Deadwood, away from the bigger towns. He was criticized for that choice, but business was good, and he was enjoying a carefree life, filled with joys and all kinds of temptations. All was well until that dreadful night when bandits stormed inside, shot in the air and took him away before he could do anything to defend himself. Turned out they wanted ransom, and Tony spent a good couple of days in their Fort, helpless to their torture, unable to do anything about it until the bandits could negotiate his release with his father’s associates. Of course he tried to escape; this only granted him a bullet on his chest and a horrible treatment by a local “doctor”. Needless to say, that left him with a huge, ugly to him, scar right in the centre of his chest, which would equally encourage or discourage the ladies; not that he was thinking much about them when that incident was happening, he was mostly worried about his safety.
“Have you been exercising while I was away? That was one heck of a kick”, he replied, rubbing his arm.
Steve had never felt so embarrassed in his life, holding his hands up to his face as he tried to run past them, only for Falcon to grab his arm.
“So are you denying that you’re well known for sharing your bed?” Steve asked, a little confused. “We keep our women for specific times; they do not just simply roam the streets.”
Tony couldn’t help but smirk to himself when Steve couldn’t think of a suitable answer, a little smug at showing him that maybe the Athenian way wasn’t really the correct one. Steve preached about equality and justice, but his own actions often contradicted his sayings, and Tony could see right through it. He examined Steve's uneasy posture and left his bowl on the small table as he stood.
“It worked..?!”
Despite Tony's words and demands to stop the attack, the Spartan king and leader of Greece’s finest army decided to march on war, sending Tony deeper into his pit of aggression and regret. He'd promised Steve that he would protect his people and beautiful city, and yet, his own people were preparing for war, walking for days and revising their plan of attack.
“Can we get to Brooklyn tomorrow? I want to visit my..apartment” , he said calmly. He postponed that for days now, and he didn’t even know why. Still, he wanted to go, he never changed his mind, and now that him and Tony seemed to be in better terms, maybe it was better, and more comfortable for Steve to make that visit. It had only been a couple of days, but Tony became someone who he could consider a friend, especially since he didn’t have anyone else in that century. Tony as well seemed to be happy of them bonding; he would show up and talk, spend more time together and actually help him figure out anything that Steve needed to be answered.
He was there, Captain America was actually there, right in front of him. His uniform and hood were mostly torn up, but the star on his chest belonged without a doubt to him. His hood wasn’t removed, but part of his hair was visible, along side his right cheek. It
“Duck!”
“That’s what you say; I think you’ve done a lot more than you can possibly imagine;" Tony corrected him.
Tony smiled. “I’m lacking in that domain, you should start your teaching from there,” he said. “I’m more of a practical person; I really love a more scientific approach to most things.”
“Get him, stop them,
“Much better, who would have thought that you need to start controlling your strength now?”
Steve blinked. “You do?”
“Do you really think that there’s a place for me in this world, Tony?”, he asked the older man who sat by his side.
Asking for help to get on his wheelchair every day was painful, so he learnt to do it himself in no time. Still, the times that he found himself on the floor and forced to call one of the nurses to help him up were enough to shatter his pride and cause him to isolate himself.
“And you have patience?”
“Better? You think that you’ll find something better than the top facilities of Stark Industries?”, Tony snorted, a hint of insult in his voice, doing his best to avoid Pepper’s sharp look.
“I live in the temple,” Steve said softly, rubbing the water over his arms again.
“I thought I made myself clear. I didn’t want you to leave me...” He said softly, holding his shield up without even looking at the man who charged at him, protecting himself with his large weapon.
“Why would I mock your appearance?” Tony asked as he sat up, water dripping from his chest. “That is a compliment; I do find your exterior really appealing.”
Tony was beaming as he was standing next to Steve, getting congratulated by journalists, veterans, doctors, families. He needed to do this, this what exactly what he planned when he first decided the program, not create weapons. He wanted to offer soldiers a chance to fight again if they wanted to, but above all, his priority was to give people back their lives.
Steve looked down at him with a serious expression, eyes that had lost their spark of hope.
Steve gripped Tony’s hand tightly, leaning close to him, their armour clattering together as he lifted his helmet slightly to kiss Tony’s lips again, desperate to do so. “You’re all I have now, Tony.”
Tony moved one of his hands to hold Steve’s chin, turning his head back and bringing him closer as he heard his name being called. It encouraged him to thrust in deeper, aiming for that sweet spot that he was aware that it would send Steve into pure pleasure. “Just a little more," Tony groaned, breathing heavily against Steve's ear.
“That comes from the man who ate SPAM straight from the can once”, Tony pointed out.
“That’s right, you can’t do anything! I should have killed you a long time ago, Tony, you and your dog are going down for good!”, Stane laughed, standing before them, his hand up in the air, ready to strike them down.
“After... talking,” Steve admitted, “no, I don’t particularly like you. But, it was pleasant.”
Pepper seemed to be shocked and even cornered Tony when he told her about this.
Just like that, the first kiss came, and so did the confession. It was definitely nothing like the way Tony pictured everything to be. It was clumsy and sloppy, but somehow it felt right. And the fact that Steve actually responded to his feeling left Tony astonished. Steve Rogers,
“Nice? In what sense? What happened?” he asked, more interested with each passing moment.
“How can you know that?! Huh?! You never tried, you never gave me a chance to prove it!”, Tony yelled his grip on his hair tightening.
The only way to fight fire was with fire it seemed, and the fact that Tony seemed so confrontational seemed to trigger a battle defence in Steve’s attitude. Tony watched him carefully, circling him as he spoke, both insulted and intrigued by the Athenian’s guts and desire to oppose him, not used to people back-talking to him; after all, he was the son of Ares himself, the god of war, not just any of the other gods. He had power and honour, and a blood lust worthy of a thousand Athenians.
“They won’t shoot at you, if that’s what you’re wary of”, he pointed out, taking another look at the blonde who walked next to him, his jaw clenched.
“Sparta,” Steve said, brushing back his shoulder length blonde hair behind his ears and glancing up at the man. Falcon pulled a face, furrowing his eyebrows in curiosity.
“You’ll have a couple of words with me about discipline now?”, Tony chuckled, mainly to hide the fact that Stane’s words did sound ominous to him.
Tony shrugged. “Well, it’s been two or three years now. One of the downsides of being the heir to one of the most successful companies for years now, huh? You always have people going after your head. Can’t trust anybody, really, I should have known better”
“Another me…?”, Steve blinked.
Steve was gone and he was turning into the savage beast that he was before he met him, yet again.
“Yes… you’re the only survivor… do you understand why we want you here…? Safe? They all seem to have passed whatever portal is sending them to my universe dead… so there is a huge chance that sending you home before settling this will… kill you.”, Steve said as he gently helped him up, his most caring side rushing to show once he saw Tony being so shaken and distressed, just like he expected.
Tony stayed silent for a moment, thinking about his answer. Of course he did, but would he come off as too needy? No, he couldn’t, since just moments ago Steve was holding him and kissing him. He nodded. “I do.”
This wasn’t the guy that would take every hit for the others, that hated bullies. It was hard to put Tony Stark in this situation, but he did felt compromised, bullied even by what he believed to be his hero, someone that his Dad looked up to, someone that Tony secretly aspired to be, getting Howard’s approval as a child. Suddenly, being Tony Stark, the guy that people wouldn’t stop criticizing didn’t sound bad at all. Anything but being considered the type of hero like the man dressed in blue standing in front of him.
“Tony!”, Steve shouted again, getting his shield and managing a good number of hard hits on Stane, who made a couple of steps back towards the edge of the rooftop. The soldier ran towards Tony who seemed to be unconscious, shaking him while holding him protectively in his hands. “Tony! Listen to me!”, he shouted, fearing for the worst.
Tony drew the painting closer, looking at Steve with a hint of surprise when he pulled him close, his arms so tight around his waist. “Uh, Steve?” he asked, practically feeling Steve’s breath against him.
Like mentioned, their first meeting was right in the middle of the battlefield, fighting off Loki in Germany. A loud noise was heard, and Iron Man, in all his glory appeared from nowhere, landing in front of the Captain and aiming at Loki, who raised his hands in the air.
“What?”
Tony blinked, this was contradicting everything that he had planned in his head about Captain America’s return. Interviews, signings, photo sessions, inspiring talks..  those would have to wait.. until he found a way to convince him that having him as a hero back was all they could now, besides keep researching to save their home.
“What do you need him for anyway? Feel free to ramble away about how much you want this unlimited power, rule the world, get rich, whatever you have in mind”, Tony said as he kept his eyes fixed on him.
“Y-yeah..?”
The roles had reversed right now, Steve was the one looking confused, hurt, and Tony was looking down at him, pleased to be on top again.
Tony gave him a look, watching him as he nodded at Steve's words. “You know, Aphrodite would disagree. To love and be loved in return is a great gift to humanity,” he said carefully. “I wouldn’t say that having genuine feelings for another person is going to plague you.”
“I could help you.. be the Captain again.. be the hero you really are..”, he whispered.
“I was torn too,” Steve said. “I tried to be a God and I watched her... I watched her live without me. I pushed her away for my own duties and I lost her. I would never wish that fate upon anyone, Tony. It was at that moment that I wished I was human, just that once.”  He smiled very faintly, almost sadly. “Perhaps, I have been summoned here by the fates to help you become human.”
He did have a good heart; he just didn’t get to show it much, the Spartan atmosphere requiring him to be tough most of the time. Steve stepped up behind Tony, tilting his head at the spear and patting the man lightly on the shoulder.
A week later, they were sat in Tony’s small plane, eyes shut, waiting impatiently to reach Buenos Aires. From there, they had a rented vehicle to take them to the jungle just outside the city; according to Tony’s notes, their destination was there.
There was silence, Tony could hear the Avengers sighing in relief, smiling to Steve once he flew next to him.
Steve tilted his head up ever so slightly to try and kiss him, but he was far too weak. Instead he just brushed their lips together and shut his eyes. “Together...” he whispered, finally falling limp as the blood pooled around him from his wound, his arm resting over Tony as his life slipped away.
The plan was to leave before dawn the next morning, and Steve was meant to do a routine check that evening and in the morning, in case they were followed. Tony chose to be very quiet about the identity of who could possibly come after them, but it didn’t make Steve’s job any easier.
