"I kinda thought so," Scott agreed, chuckling and wriggling out of his pants while they kissed, sloppy and hungry and kind of perfect. Until recently, he hadn't considered what sex with Logan would be like or how he might kiss. It didn't need a lot of thought in the end. Logan handled sex and kissing with the same sort of brutal instinct he approached everything else with. The surprising part was the realization that underneath all of that, Logan could show true care, true kindness. It was something Jean had seen underneath it all and tried to assure him of. Scott had been too pointedly set on thinking of Logan as a lost cause to take her word. "You could have me right here... up against the wall...."
Inside, Coulson railed against the barrier that meant he couldn't get a shot off. It might not kill Loki, but if it hurt him a lot, it would still have been worth it. "I'm surprisingly hard to kill."
Slowly Scott nodded and let his gaze stray to Logan instead. "I guess it's kind of like asking someone what they're in for in prison, huh?"
Logan nodded. He dug into his pocket. Nobody'd had the nerve get close enough to take his cell phone from him while he was locked up, and apparently Stark's little phones held their batteries for awhile. Finding Coulson's number, Logan punched in a quick message, "Let us know how Rogers is," before setting it aside to wait for the reply. "There. Hopefully he's not too busy." Logan honestly wanted to know, as well, but the rest of the team was obviously far more tightly knit, and he felt like he was sticking his nose where it didn't go.
Fitz winced. "To put it a bit less nicely, it won't work at all. That section there doesn't go off with a bang, so to speak, and Captain Rogers' cells keep eating themselves. Well, eating the serum-y bits, anyway, and eventually there won't be anything left to wake up."
Clint looked to his companion, still chewing the last of his food. "It's alright. I think we're all a little on edge," he said, finishing off his coffee. His mind flashed back to their light-hearted banter earlier that morning, and he found himself wishing he could get back to that level of relaxation. "You really think we'll be able to fix them? Summers and Logan?" While Nat seemed miserable, she otherwise seemed to be herself. The other two, though...
"That would be perfect," Phil agreed readily. He hesitated before adding, "As for the clothes, I don't mind clearing out a drawer or two." That sounded rather official, rather early on, but he hoped it would be taken in the spirit it was intended. It wasn't meant to be pushing, it was meant to be supportive. The truth was he would just as soon have Clint around as much as humanly possible. Phil already knew he wasn't likely to sleep much the first few nights after Clint decided to go back to his own room. "You're also welcome to borrow something. Probably won't fit exactly right, but it's a standing offer."
"Don't need sleep. Need to figure this out."
"How's your 'sharp points through the eye' phobia?" Logan shot back, leaning against the plane's safety harness as if it were the only thing keeping him from making good on his threat.
"Telepathy. Grey's got some mild telekinesis, Xavier's got some other, more expansive abilities that he keeps very much on the down low." Coulson glanced sideways at Clint, wondering if the agent would have been so brazen if he'd known what the pair could do. "The people in that mansion could tear the world apart if they chose to. It's a testament to the kind of people they are that they don't. They choose to help, to try to fight the fight the right way." It was hard not to respect Xavier even if Coulson thought he took his nonviolent principles too far at times.
"Well," Victor said, his fingers hooking over the waistband at the back of Phil's pants, "I'm not talking about killing you. Yet." No need for either of them to know he'd gotten orders not to. He pressed in close, dropping his voice so that Clint couldn't hear him. "I was thinking more I could fuck you. Then you can watch me play with your little archer friend. And then I could slowly tear him apart while you listen to him scream for mercy. Think that might do it?"
Thor doesn't dare to make any sudden moves, lest he spurs the thing into an unwarranted attack. He stops at what he deems to be a safe distance away from it, and observes carefully.
“JARVIS, turn on the radio for me?” Tony requests the AI, settling onto his stool and pulling up a holoscreen displaying an old schematic he’d been working on.
Tony still kind of felt like he was living in his 10-year-old self’s dream sometimes. But then Steve would stop by his dorm room with takeout from their favourite Thai restaurant at the end of a long day or Tony would catch him talking to DUM-E softly when he thought Tony was still asleep, and he doesn’t think that even his 10-year-old self could come up with a dream so perfect.
There were at least three coffee pots sitting out on the table, two of them half empty and the third being guzzled straight from the pot, still steaming, by Bucky, who looked very unhappy to be there so early in the morning. The table was even more of a mess than it had been when Steve had left it last night, but he noticed that someone had graciously removed the wrappers and boxes that they hadn’t gotten rid of the night before. There were plates of eggs, very fragile-looking towers of pancakes, and small puddles of maple syrup slowly seeping toward the bottom rims of glasses to inevitably leave behind resilient stains on the table.
“Need a ride, Captain?” Iron Man drawls through the voice modulator of the suit as he flies towards Steve.
The clock was slowly inching on its way to two o’clock, and Tony quietly giggled half to himself when he recalled Fury’s earlier statement about getting enough rest. Yeah, that wasn’t happening.
“Y’all are fucking nuts,” Sam said, rolling his eyes and sliding off the barstool and carrying his plate over to the sink. “He carries around that damn thing? And you’re here moping? Dude, why are we here again,” he asked, directing the last question at an equally exasperated Bucky.
“I think I know what the source is,” Tony replied, carefully pasting on what Steve had come to know as his press face, his smile stretched a little too thin and his eyes guarded. He turned back to the screen, flicking the infrared image out of the way and zooming in on something else. When Steve peered closer, he noticed that Tony had replaced the previous display with a satellite image of the location. The zoomed-in portion of the screen showed a small box, which Steve was able to identify as a cottage or cabin of some sort. Tony flicked back to another image, this one with a date printed on the bottom right corner telling them that it was taken about two months ago. The small box was gone.
“How can we fix that?”
Tony grinned showing teeth but both their thoughts went back to the robots back in their Cambridge apartment.
“Did you ever hear back from Dr. Pym?”
It’s too hot for this.
He only ever joked about it once.
“You were right! You told me I would never be happy denying who I am and I wasn’t. You told me that I would never forgive myself for what I did and I still haven’t. I’m so sorry I hurt you Tony, I’m sorry I left you by yourself right before you needed me the most. And most of all… I’m so sorry that I was so ashamed of myself that I made our friends take sides.”
So far Steve’s presence had managed to keep Tony away from the epic drug-fueled parties he’d been known for in the original universe. Not because Tony hadn’t wanted to go, but because Steve always managed to find something ‘We just have to try’ that same weekend and Tony didn’t have the heart to say no. And oh, how they had fun together. With Tony’s lack of inhibitions and Steve’s willingness to do anything to please him, they managed to get into their own brand of trouble as they drove all over Massachusetts exploring.
Tony is his one good thing in a world of shit… which is why Steve is not going home now.
They were in Tony’s office (both their office’s really since they shared the space), Steve over at his corner, Tony furiously typing something on a completely flat keyboard.
The calm in Tony’s voice, the warmth and love made Steve’s grip slacken until Tony was able to slide his arms around Steve’s neck. The touch calmed Steve, especially as Tony’s hands buried in the blonde tresses. They sat there, on the floor whispering small likes and dislikes to each other until the need to use the bathroom led them to their feet.
Steve had never missed cell phones more than he missed them now and watching the target vehicle make its way in a remote corner of what was still Czechoslovakia, Steve wished he could at least text Tony. Truthfully he didn’t care much about the SHIELD business Peggy had briefed him on. He knew it had something to do with blood they’d taken from Steve after he became a super soldier and Peggy had gone on and on about how important it was, until Steve pointed out she could draw as much of his blood as she wanted. Her reaction to that fact had been interesting, as if she finally realized what the implications of him being here meant.
“He’s very impressed with your abilities, trust me, I know my husband.”
Life has never been kind to Steve. It gave him an abusive father, killed his Ma of cancer much too early, made him skinny and weak while young so he’d get picked on endlessly at school. Life taught him to always fight for every chance, taught him to work harder than anyone, to hit harder than anyone. Life taught him how to be mean.
“I’m fine. I just came to see how you are”
Her eyes flooded with tears but she was quick in schooling them back in place. Not wanting to weaken her further the High Commander stood up, gave Alaska a quick nod and turned to leave her office. It was Tony who’d taught him that people could remain even if they were not physically there. Not because he’d ever said it to him, but by example.
Discovering something can sometimes be detrimental to one’s peace of mind. Like suddenly finding a miniscule crack in the bedroom ceiling and the more you look the bigger it seems to become, until you worry that after every single storm water will leak inside, that mould might grow, that the roof might cave in.
With the chains ready to go, Steve merely had to attach the blade. He’d thought long and hard about the blade, he’d done research and even a couple of tests on fruit. Eventually he’d settled on a circular (shield like) plate which was so sharp it could cut through a strand of hair just by touching it. It was actually all rather simple, he merely had to pull on one end of the chain and physics would do the rest.
And he’s not lying, Steve truly feels at peace. It’s as if his sanctuary continues to drift further away from the rage that infects the outside world. With Tony, Steve is at his best. Outside, Steve could not be worse.
“Because these hands were made for something other than punching.”
Tony had no organized space in the Commander’s mind, there was no special box in which he was kept. Tony permeated everything. Steve could be in the midst of remembering a particular report about an alloy deal with Wakanda while the Supreme Leader had been in power, when in would strut a thought of Tony’s face the first time they went to visit Wakanda in Stark Solutions business.
“YOU DO KNOW ME TONY”
But sometimes, very rarely, he dreamt of Tony. Not his Tony, his husband, his love but the other one, the one he lost. Old memories flashed across his closed eyelids like faded pictures. Moments in which a man who no longer existed, laughed and joked with a man who was no longer alive.
Steve was wearing a tux, dressed up to the nines at Pepper’s urging and before him, down on one fucking knee was Tony Stark.
Nowadays, Tony was much better at reading between the lines. For instance, he now understood that that had been Steve-code for “I’ll kill myself when you die”. Knowing this hurt Tony, but at the same time he understood it, respected it.
Steve puzzled over the question. Wondered if Tony thought Steve was going to leave him… then it hit him.
Stephen smiles a tight, polite smile. “I’m glad they’re proving useful.”
“I’m pretty sure you have a private jet at your disposal, plus what’s wrong with moving SI headquarters outside New York? California is America’s technology capital anyway so it’d make sense.”
“I’ll take it.”
“Yeah but we’re all bored I don’t think they’ll last long.”
“Yeah she is. You know, she always thought you’d come back. Never stopped believing, it but I bet not even she could’ve seen this coming.”
“I’m actually surprised you haven’t tried to stop me.”
Steve held on to him tighter then, his right arm wrapping around Tony’s torso with a viper grip.
“You ok Uncle Steve?”
The end product is decent, not professional, not bulletproof but decent enough for Bruce to believe it might be that Dr. Baker he met at that conference a few months back, or was it a few years back? Regardless, he accepts the friend request four days after receiving it (he doesn’t check every day) and spares it no further thought ever again.
Since the earthquake hit, food was rationed. They were lucky to have one of the best stocked pantries in the city but they still conserved as much as possible, sent out what they could to the city shelters. Normality was still months away for most of the world’s population and yet Steve seemed more at peace than Tony had ever seen him.
“Stop panicking Tony. Everything’s fine”
Steve sounded worried. The only times Steve ever sounded worried was when Tony wasn’t feeling well. Steve hadn’t even been ‘distressed’ when the earthquake hit, but god-forbid Tony hadn’t slept all night because THAT was a cause for real concern.
“I’m with you till the end of the line Tony.”
“So why did you really come here Steve?” Tony is officially too emotionally exhausted to dance around anything anymore.
Something is said back by Cap but this far away, it was no more than a whisper to Tony. Then as quickly as it all began, Steve Rogers walked right out of their home.
“Fuck,” he cursed, striding over to the fridge and yanking the door open. He only faintly registered Steve trailing behind him anxiously, knowing better than to question him when he got like this.
Tony was late.
“We’re done here. If you still wanted to join us, that is?”
Steve did not know how he was supposed to respond to that. “You know, Thor? That sounds about right.”
“What, the weird non-apology letter with that burner phone I told you not to send?” Bucky asked with a dubious eyebrow raised. “Steve, the guy owns a tech conglomerate and is also a certified genius. I think the burner phone was a little unnecessary.”
Tony winces bodily, setting a placating hand on top of the stack. “I’ll do them now, Pep. I swear. I just, I got caught up in the workshop, you know how it gets. I’ll stay late if I have to, but I will get them done.”
Tony would never admit it, but he’d fucking missed Steve. All that time he’d been on the run after the fight at the airport in Berlin, Tony hadn’t been able to stop worrying about him. He’d made damn sure that Ross wouldn’t get a hold of them despite knowing well enough that with Nat and Sam on Steve’s side, there wasn’t much else for Tony’s assistance to accomplish.
Thank you for reading and I hope you're able to stay safe :)
Tony faux groaned quietly, tossing his head back in a flail that would make bat-pirate hybrid Fury proud of his dramatics. “Oh no, the horror.”
“Tony.”
Tony snorted, tiredly glancing up at Steve’s earnest expression. “Sure, Steve. I guess we are.”
His phone had begun to vibrate at increasingly shorter intervals and at alarming intensity, but he was determined to leave with a donut from Randy’s Donuts, because he wasn’t here for the crappy, fake ethically sourced shit that Starbucks had to offer. Tony decided that if he showed up late with a whole box of donuts for everyone, he would probably be forgiven with minimal grovelling on his part.
“Steve,” Tony called, softly. Steve looked up at him, catching the uncertainty and the concern that was written all over Tony’s face as clear as day just for a moment. “We’re going to get out of here. I promise.”
“Hello? Who’s this?” The man asks, his voice just veering on the edge of being too loud. “I’m not interested in purchasing whatever you’re selling, but thanks anyway.”
Tony had been the one to propose a series of alterations to the Accords, ones that wouldn’t limit the actions of the Avengers as long as they answered to a team of enhanced individuals that Tony and Professor Xavier were in the process of putting together. The Avengers would be able to operate independently in the event of an emergency, but would otherwise operate under the guidance of this team of both people with the X gene and other enhanced members of the community. They'd gotten rid of the Raft, and in its place designed a specialized rehabilitation program for enhanced individuals who had caused some amount of destruction with malicious intent. Along with that, a training program to ensure that these individuals would be able to properly manipulate their abilities and reduce the amount of public chaos during a mission was also in the works. These amended Accords were the ones that Steve eventually signed in order to return back to the States and have Barnes psychologically treated at home after the cryo and Shuri's deprogramming of the Winter Soldier in Wakanda.
“I’m just messing with you,” Stark dismisses, shaking his head. His smile is more genuine when he looks up at Steve again. “Besides, I kind of had this covered.”
Steve’s mind unhelpfully provided him with the image of a rotting slab of meat that had been sitting out on the communal kitchen counter with various species of flying insects swarming it, which Thor had claimed to be his famous roast that he had been preparing for their team dinner.
“Yes, Tony, it took us three hours to find our way out of the town and then we went back to the Tower after seeing no signs of you or Steve,” Bruce explained, looking them over with a critical eye. “We were planning on contacting Strange or Richards but—” He trailed off and looked to the side, apparently noticing the dirty dishes in the sink for the first time. “You two have been here for way longer than a week.”
Seeing Steve right here right now, right in front of him, and there still being the largest emotional chasm in the world between them, hurt like nothing else. Tony missed him like hell. Their falling out had been months in the making, but neither of them had gotten any closure. Steve had up and left him there in that bunker in Siberia after nearly taking him out. Steve had lied to him for months and months. And all Tony had gotten was a half-assed non-apology for all his trouble.
want to deal with this. He whirled around to place the glass back atop the counter that had been digging into his back and shoved a fifty into the fancy tip mason jar before curtailing it out of there.
“Well, I’ve got sitting around and trying not to think about impending doom on my to-do list, but I think I can move some things around to watch Matthew McConaughey’s cute butt floating around in a black hole,” Tony said with a grin of his own, lifting up to relocate his ass to the plush loveseat behind him.
“Look, Doctor Fieldstone, I admit we did have a tough time of it at first, but I think we’re getting the hang of this, Peter and I. And I like to think I’m doing an okay job being a dad despite it all,” Steve says heartfully, causing Tony to feel immensely sympathetic for the man. If only his own father had been half the man this Steve clearly was, maybe he’d be doing a lot better for himself today.
Obadiah’s betrayal had been one that Tony had not expected. After Pepper had warned him about Obadiah’s secret weapons dealings, Tony had looked into them and tried to stop him. When all else had failed, Tony had flown to the ravaged town of Gulmira where his own weapons were being used to kill thousands of innocent civilians. None of whom had ever asked to be in such a position. Tony had destroyed all of his weapons before he returned to the States, and Obadiah had evidently not been pleased with the turn of events.
Tony wishes he could also do whatever he wants to do when he’s a grown-up. He wants to be a butler like Jarvis and help people do things in their homes, but he doesn’t think his Dad would like that very much.
Tony waves his hand dismissively, quickly averting his gaze. “Oh, you know. Word got around,” he mutters, hoping she’d move on from him.
“Where do you need me?” Steve asks, pulling his cowl down over his face as he walks out of the aircraft and into the Mansion.
“It feels weird, right?” Thor asked Steve, the rumble of his accented voice almost too low for Steve to catch amidst the deep hum of the jet’s engines.
“Cover the radius and then make our way in?” Steve spoke into the comm, turning around to face Tony who still had his faceplate up.
“JARVIS, place an order for two boxes of s’more flavoured Pop Tarts for Thor. And as my personal supersoldier, you should be back in there on the couch with me.” Tony says, turning to slide his arms around Steve’s middle. Thor thankfully slinks away, bidding them both a very boisterous goodnight.
Tony looked up with a start when his stomach growled lowly. He’d forgotten to eat dinner at the gala amidst all the Steve drama. He pointed to U who was watching them curiously. “Wanna make me something good? Make sure it’s not bleach. Or motor oil. Even though I confiscated both from you last week. I feel like you’d find a way to poison me. Somehow.”
“This isn’t me, Cap,” Iron Man says, his voice breathless as he leans away from the larger suit’s clumsy swinging gauntleted arms. “Tech’s not as developed so a lot of it isn’t working the way it’s supposed to, which makes this easier and harder for us.”
“JARVIS, let’s pull up the latest?”
Tony feels so happy he thinks he might explode like a supernova in outer space. “Yeah! Let’s be friends.”
“I think if you went and looked at your own desk you would find the reports, because you never gave them to me.”
“Dude, even Fury’s worried about you,” Sam said, his tone betraying the weirdness of it all. To be fair, Fury being worried about Steve’s mental wellbeing was a bit of a shocker, considering the whole, “Here, Cap, so there are aliens, like actual aliens, not the punching through your stomach animatronic kind, and also gods whose vernacular is scarily Shakespeare-like, hope you can deal with that. Hope the cultural shock doesn’t give you depression, and if it does we’ll give you this useless therapy session where the psychiatrist will give you the okay even if you are the definite opposite of okay!” mere months after Steve had been found in the ice.
and is named Ty fucking Stone thinks of him, when the music changed, hoots of delight going up from the couples of the middle-aged variety on the dance floor as the tempo picked up.
Peter’s eyes follow them until they make it to the other side of the street. The light turns green and they start moving again.
“Steve? God, I’m so sorry. Peter’s gone.”
“Sweetheart, you have got to know that this isn’t your fault, okay? If that man cannot appreciate what’s right in front of him, then why do you gotta worry? You’ve got your whole life ahead of you, and you cannot let this man decide what’s to come of that,” is Dr. Fieldstone’s very vague but enthusiastic response to the woman’s lament.
His dad looks up from the bowl of cookie batter he’s been mixing, his brows creased in a confused frown. “What is it, Peter? You okay?”
In his defence, Tony hadn’t exactly planned on being stuck behind Basic Brittany with her pin-straight blonde hair and dressed in Lulus that Tony had thought were strictly a soccer mom outfit staple until this very moment. She had her phone pulled out, reciting her very complicated coffee order to the poor girl behind the counter who looked like she was about five seconds away from putting in her two weeks’ notice. It seemed that Basic Brittany had veered very off course from her usual Starbucks this evening.
“Hello, Peter. What seems to be the problem on this very late night for a young boy such as yourself,” comes the voice of Dr. Fieldstone.
Fortunately, they’d gotten through it and without any altercations that would suggest their incompetence at working as a team. Surprisingly, it went very smoothly, almost more smoothly than their missions before the Accords had happened. Steve figured that a distinct lack of friendly chatter over the comms and Tony’s constant curt, professional demeanour that was so unlike him that Steve often felt that he was working alongside a complete stranger, were the causes for their eerily efficient success.
“So you’re freely claiming senior citizen status now?” Tony asked jokingly, grabbing the remote from Steve and pressing play again, settling deeper into the couch and trying his best to ignore the heat radiating from Steve’s body which was merely inches next to his own.
Steve leaps up onto the flailing elbow of the suit, aiming to strike the neck with his shield, hoping that it would be a weak spot. “Well, you probably know more about this that the rest of us, Iron Man. How do we take him down?” He flings his shield out, but it merely bounces off the metal producing a shower of sparks before Steve manages to snatch it out of the air. The giant suit shifts as the man inside notices Steve trying to keep his balance on top of it.
“People start calling crackpot doctors on the radio?” Tony wonders out loud, nearly missing the kid’s response.
“Well, I’m not exactly thrilled to fly into a ghost town where everything’s gone to hell, but who is?”
“Iron Man? Doing some late night surveillance?” Captain America asks, the kid at his side falling silent as he stares up at Tony inside of the armour in shock.
Peter runs down the walkway and finds an empty seat beside another kid sitting with her mom. He settles in, and when he can’t figure out how to buckle his seatbelt, the mom reaches over to help him. Peter decides travelling by himself is quite fun. He watches the free movies on the little TV attached to the seat in front of him, all the while keeping one hand firmly inside of his pocket where Tony’s letter rested.
“I really don’t think half a banana while crying about last night counts as a meal, man.” Sam offered, climbing onto one of the stools at the counter and watching as Dodger followed at Steve’s heels as he stood at the counter, inspecting the pizza.
He bade goodnight to Steve around a jaw-cracking yawn on his way to the bedroom, but paused at the door when he caught Steve staring at the toaster out of the corner of his eye.
The others are sprawled in various positions all over what must be the most comfortable couch ever manufactured in this new world Steve has been thrown into. The low glass table that sits atop the fuzzy white rug that Thor had insisted on buying when they’d spent an entire futile day at Ikea, is littered with empty coffee mugs, an abandoned bowl of popcorn, and Mjolnir. Of course.
“Almost two years,” the man, Steve, replies hesitantly.
“We don’t know what kind of power this infinity stone might have. And more than that, we don’t know who brought it there,” Bruce explained with a shrug, dropping his notebook with a puzzled look on his own face. “To be honest, Steve, we can’t be sure what’s going on until we see it for ourselves. We can’t even be sure that what we’re dealing with is an infinity stone. It could just be some other, all-powerful intergalactic energy source.”
“Exactly!”
Steve looks around them where the five men who were clearly the ones behind Stark’s kidnapping are now being transported back to the Helicarrier that he can hear waiting outside.
“Hey, Tony, yeah?” Bucky asked him, barreling on before Tony had a chance to even nod. “What’re you doin’ up here?”
On the third day, Tony beckoned Steve over to the kitchen island and gave him a small task to do. It was just prying apart various plates on his armour that he hadn’t quite managed to do with his tiny screwdriver, but the grateful look Steve had sent him as he’d sat down across from him had been everything. And also nothing at all, because Tony was more than aware of the towering pile of issues with a capital ‘I’ that they were both sitting on.
Steve tried his comm once again, but to no avail. He slumped in the stool, burying his head in his hands, his exhausted mind rapidly filing through all the options they had, what could have gone so terribly wrong, how they could get in contact with the others. He barely noticed as Tonys strode back toward him, bustling past to flick on the light and then opening up cabinets and drawers.
Tony turned so quickly, he felt a twinge in the side of his neck. “You’re shitting me. No, you’re not. Oh my God, Steve Rogers gets senior discounts! What the fuck?” Tony guffawed, peering at Steve’s twitching lips that betrayed his own grin.
” There was a deafening shriek from behind the camera, one that sent shills spilling over Tony’s shoulders, the frantic sound of crunching as whoever was holding the camera tried to sprint through the deep snow, and then, then there was nothing. An abrupt cut to black, no fancy fade, no transition back into reality. Just the cut-off scream of someone who had been seeing something that no one else in the room had managed to watch with them.
This was good. They were getting out of here. He could open the front door and leave like anyone else.
“But why do you have to go anyway,” Peter whines plaintively from the pile of blankets he’s surrounded himself in. He clutches the copy of “The Sorcerer’s Stone” that Bucky had bought for him for his birthday to his chest, and pouts up at Steve as he stands at the foot of Peter’s bed wearing what he hopes is a stern frown on his face.
"China," Bruce murmured, shaking his head.
Tony followed the moving blur that he knew was Loki with a glare. He was trying to figure out what, exactly, the god was getting at. "Submit? Like more of that baloney act in Stuttgart?" If pretending to worship Loki was all it took to get Barton and Coulson out of jail free, then Tony was pretty sure he could swallow his pride and manage it, but that seemed way too simple for Loki. Something else the god had said caught up with Tony. "What do you mean 'play nice'?"
Darien couldn't really catch his breath, too terrified and excited to even try. He wanted to look behind him to get a better idea of who the hell the stranger rimming him was, but Clint's grip on his hair made it clear that wasn't in the cards. He looked up instead at the man currently pulling the strings. They were all there for Clint, ultimately. The other guys might have a go at every guy that came into the back room, but they were taking all their cues from Clint. And he was Clint's. It was a strangely comforting thought. If Clint wanted him dead, he would already be dead, which meant that most of the existing possibilities were of an equally dark but probably more entertaining variety.
"Good, then! We shall have to drink and tell tales when things are less grim," Thor replied with a nod. He turned his attention to Lady Frigga, standing again. He knew he might well be taken as hostile, but the sight of his mother so obviously weakened wouldn't stand unheeded. He stepped toward her, holding his hand out. "Mother... are you well? Did Loki hurt you? I swear, this time I will not be so lenient with him when he is found."
Here be smut and character stuff. Some Clint/Phil, lots of Logan/Scott/Natasha. Enjoy!
He just didn't hate it enough to want to die, and staring down the barrel of a mobster's gun, Darien found himself wondering how likely that was. He could quicksilver again, of course - indeed he was fighting the urge to do so as fear trickled down his spine along with a trail of sweat - but the guy could probably shoot him before he managed it. He had only wanted to conserve a little time before his next shot. The Keeper had already been on him about using quicksilver too freely, and Darien didn't want to get an earful about it when he got back from an already unapproved mission.
"Pretty," Logan echoed, then glanced at Scott with a smirk. "She called me pretty." He'd found his best pair of jeans and one of his better button downs. Logan couldn't help but find Scott's choice of shirts sexy. In fact, he was glad Scott was staying close to him, because Logan was sure he'd have been pulling him in anyway.
"Of course. I know just the place," Jemma agreed. She was desperately pleased to find that she wasn't the only one who not only ran early but who was also relatively low maintenance. In younger years, she'd seen it as some sort of feminine failing that it took her all of ten minutes to get ready most mornings, though as she'd gotten older, Jemma realized that there was something to be said for not spending half her life in front of a mirror. After a few moments, Jemma found her courage and assured, "You look rather handsome yourself, by the way."  The coffee shop she led them to was close but around a corner and stuffed between two other shops. "I didn't even see it the first time I walked by." Inside it was quietly charming, somewhere between Starbucks and a grandmother's living room. "They make the absolute best hot chocolate I've ever had."
"Getting real close to it now," Clint muttered, moving to stand next to Stark and glaring at him. "Push one more button, and I swear to god, I'll break your neck if it's the last thing I get to do." The archer was a few inches shorter than Tony, but the set of his jaw and the look in his eye made him about twice as intimidating.
Tony sobered, seeing a shadow covering Steve's eyes. "You miss those days, don't you?" he asked softly. Steve had lost so much that it amazed Tony the other man was as well adjusted as he appeared to be. Tony could not even begin to imagine himself in Steve's shoes, waking up to find the world that he'd known no longer existed. It made him admire Steve all the more, while it also made him feel ashamed over locking himself away instead of facing what had happened.
"Well, this is very deja vu," Tony sulked as he took over the chair and wheeled himself towards the bedroom. "At least you didn't threaten to tase me while looking unnervingly excited at the prospect. I guess we all grow up a little, Coulson." Stopping at his bedroom door, he twisted in his chair. "Supernanny's on channel twelve. No raspberry scones, and there's probably nothing in the fridge, but you're welcome to whatever you find. And stay out of my scotch." With that, he disappeared into his room.
"To find the pieces? You thought he was dead. You had every right to think that. Risking more lives... that would've been the wrong thing to do. You know that." Bruce sighed and pushed off of the bench. "Go get some sleep if you can. Maybe by tomorrow you'll have two friends to visit."
Clint had already fallen in to follow Coulson back upstairs, but one of the junior agents - a guy in his twenties who looked like he'd used an entire bottle of hair gel that morning - hustled over to catch up with the senior agent. "Sir... Director Fury's orders said that Barton could be admitted to the cell block under your escort."
They found the guards in the other room staring at the Hulk warily from the opposite side of the room. Natasha let her appreciation of their intelligence tick up a notch. "Hey, big guy," she began, carefully moving in a bit closer. Her own experiences with the Hulk had been somewhat less than pleasant. "We need to see about calming down and getting home. The sooner we do, the sooner we get to go find Loki and smash him into paste."
"I'm sure she watches the news."
"Look, guys, I just own the tower-"
Mystique wasn't in the habit of taking orders from people who were on the other side, but given the havoc the Hulk was wreaking and the sort of things SHIELD kept in the room... "Victor, peel yourself off the floor and follow us. No one's going to carry you." She didn't bother saying anything at all to Pyro. Allerdyce was on his own. She still wondered why Magneto kept the boy around most days. He could barely even hold his own against Bobby Drake, and John should have known the boy's every move.
Logan rolled his eyes and glanced at Scott. "Like that place doesn't get enough abuse," he muttered under his breath.
Clint tensed, quickly stepping back from his handler and eyeing him as if he expected an attack. "She can have whatever readings she wants off of me, but it needs to stay with me," he said, his voice soft but his eyes steely, glimmering again with the strange energy. "We know it's dangerous to anyone but me." He looked down at the weapon, fingers trailing over the runes on the handle. "Besides, why should they have it? I can use it to protect us."
Clint rolled over the next morning, momentarily confused as to where he was. It wasn't his bed, and it wasn’t Phil's increasingly familiar couch. The faint scent of soap on the pillow next to him reminded him fairly quickly, though. He sighed as the smell of coffee reached his nostrils. It should have been nice, but Clint couldn't shake the feeling that Nat was mostly just avoiding the intimacy of waking up next to him. He sighed, scratching his chest for a moment before finally peeling himself up out of the bed and stumbling into the kitchen. "Morning."
"Thought you said it ain't metal," Logan said.
"I don't really *do* nice," Logan growled in Stark's ear, grinding hard against Tony's ass and taking great satisfaction in hearing the man's heart-rate spike. He'd managed a shallow, six inch long cut across the other man's back, and he was honest enough to admit to himself it wasn’t entirely accidental.
Tony had to struggle to breathe for a moment. He wondered exactly how much Loki had 'asked' of Clint. He had a feeling that information and tea would be towards the bottom of the list of requests Loki had in mind. "Well, this is great. All those Christians told me I'd go to hell when I died, and they were right. I hate it when other people are right." The attempt at humor didn't do much to calm him and mostly just betrayed the tremor in his voice. He couldn't quite see Loki's expression, but he could tell the god was getting impatient. Loki was asking for Tony to give up the one part of himself that was the most difficult. Of all the things Tony was, submissive wasn't one of them. "Fine." A deep breath. "Okay. Fine. You use me... h-however you need to, and you let them go."
“I think you overestimate the danger,” Coulson answered even though he didn’t quite believe the words. Bucky Barnes wasn’t a danger. The Winter Soldier, on the other hand, was a definite X factor. “I appreciate your letting me take care of things back at the suite.” He suspected Clint had been along for the ride at that point too. “I think an arrow to the knee might have escalated that situation beyond what was necessary.”
"Uncertain. SHIELD hasn't encountered enough Asgardian tech to be sure." Coulson wished that weren't the case. Weapons forged in Loki's own dimension would definitely help. "Right now I'm satisfying myself thinking of creative ways to remove his internal organs with a dull spoon."
Logan relaxed as another drink was set before him, then turned his attention back to Steve. "Not drinkin' anything?"
"Mr. Stark, does Ms. Potts know about this relationship?"
Coulson smiled faintly at that. "So long as Mr. Stark behaves himself." He glanced down at the phone in his hand and tapped at the screen. "Be dressed and ready in an hour. I'll have a small selection of reporters here to speak with you both by then. In the meantime, I need to speak with our newest recruit."
"To be fair, I think I was too busy internally freaking out to really get into it," Coulson answered with a short laugh. He'd been able to feel the power, but he hadn't let himself experience it. He hadn't been in a position of having to use the damn thing the way Clint had. The second they entered the infirmary, medics were putting them through their paces. As expected, Coulson was deemed intact after a few stitches. The nurse was kind enough to slip him some painkillers for the soreness that was to follow, and he drifted over to the stretcher Clint was seated on. "You gonna live?"
Steve took everything without a second's protest. He actually enjoyed giving head. It was intimate and deliberate in a way just sex didn't always manage to be. Besides that he always enjoyed the opportunity to watch a lover come undone, and that had never been more true than it was looking up at Tony. It wasn't the right moment for talking or thinking, but Steve couldn't suppress the thought that he wanted to see a lot more of this.
Jarvis was painfully, endlessly patient in a way that Steve wasn't sure he was programmed for. Surely an AI programmed by Tony couldn't be that damn nice, but it didn't matter how painfully incompetent he was, Jarvis only responded with gentle suggestions of adjustments to make the next time. Their first sessions that morning had left his body a network of sore spots and bruises, but Steve had never let that stop him before. With the help of the bots, he strapped in and tried again. And again. He sighed with frustration every time an attempt to fly or stabilize himself ended up with him sprawled gracelessly on the floor.
"It's the best we've got," he agreed, tone suggesting that he hated the plan every bit as much as Natasha did. Steve swallowed hard. He was about to ask another team member to risk losing his mind if not his life on the same fool's errand that had taken Tony away from him. "What do you think, Clint? It's your call. We can ask you to do it, but not one of us would make you. It's a lot to risk over a maybe."
In the harsh light of a new day, Steve felt his stomach knot with fear all over again. It felt like the other shoe had to drop at some point. He found it hard to imagine losing everything the serum had given him and not losing Tony too. Instead of lying prone with the mask on his face, the bed's incline had been brought up so that he could sit. He'd spent a lot of the morning sketching, too tense to focus on reading anything and too nervous to put up with the stupidity that made up most morning television. Steve tried not to freak out at the sound of the door. Another asthma attack wasn't how he wanted to start the day. "Hi," he called out, smile wan but still there.
It was becoming more and more difficult to pretend that Creed didn't have a chance of succeeding. The man was honestly terrifying, and help was likely to be too far away to be any particular help to them. Not until they were in bad shape. Phil rested his head against the wall and did what he could to breathe evenly. The solid weight of Creed was an uncomfortable dose of reality. "Better men than you have tried. And gods for that matter."
The words explained a lot. No wonder Logan looked like he was having some kind of breakdown. "I'm sorry. I'm sure things will settle down for you two. Things have been crazy even for this place." The spark between them was obvious even just seeing it in passing. Steve had faith in love to overcome a lot worse than times of stress. "Just stick it out." He put a hand on the man's shoulder. "It'll be worth it. As long as you two have known each other, I'm guessing it's not the first time you've disagreed."
Phil knew it didn't take psychic abilities to pick up on the nervous energy in the room. "Professor, forgive us for-"
The corner of Phil's lips quirked up into a smile at the husky sound of Clint's voice. He wasn't about to break their plan of not rushing, but he looked forward to hearing that a lot more in the future. "I might. Then again, I think I like the idea of seeing you a little jealous better. Maybe I need more with tiny shields on them." He'd done his fair share of being jealous when it came to Clint. Phil wondered if he could inspire the same sort of emotion, if Clint would ever see any need to worry on that count. He shouldn't, of course. For one thing Phil was monogamous by nature, for another he was already more than half crazy about Clint. Phil set a plate down in front of Clint and slid onto the closest stool with another plate for himself. "Steve's a really good guy, but just for the record, I've never wanted to date him."
Natasha paused as they reached Heimdall's impassive visage. "You see everything?"
When Mystique made to pursue Steve, Hank caught her by the ankle and tugged her back towards him. "Now, Raven," he chided, "I think he might be a tad young for you."
Scott swallowed hard. It had been a long time since he had reason to hold a civil conversation with anyone. "I'm not crazy, right? You're real?" It sounded like Logan, looked like Logan, but the idea that he was safe was too much. Scott reached out and closed trembling fingers around Logan's arm, shuddering at the feeling of the solid warmth beneath his hand. "You're real," he echoed with a shaky sigh. The man's stiff shoulders slumped, and Scott let himself feel the weight of the relief, let it drag his eyes closed again. For once he was in a room with someone he didn't have to watch like a hawk. The thought of a hospital brought up a sudden new rush of panic, and Scott gave a jerky shake of his head as his eyes opened again, "Just... can we go.. go somewhere safe? A hotel or something? I just want to get cleaned up." His voice was rough even to his own ears, but Scott found that he couldn't tolerate the idea of being examined by yet another stranger.
Clint sighed, dropping his hands. "Great."
"Steve?" Pepper had found Steve's room entirely empty, so the natural progression had been to try Tony's suite. Despite the fact that the medical staff assured her they'd left him safe and sound in his own bed, she wasn't surprised to find him curled up in Tony's, his face buried in the man's pillow. He wasn't asleep either, despite their assurances that he should sleep through the night without difficulty thanks to the pills they’d given him. It was the first time she'd seen him since the serum went on the fritz, but that didn't strike Pepper half as hard as the sorrow radiating out from him. "Hi."
Tony seemed to come out of his usual creative haze at that. He'd almost forgotten Steve in a sense. With more urgency than Bruce knew he possessed, the billionaire pushed himself up and took off.
"We'll give them a look tomorrow afternoon if all goes well," Jemma agreed, "but I've had Jarvis keeping an eye out for me. It looks good. The arrhythmia is almost gone, and his breathing is more or less normal. He's putting on weight, a bit of height..." She beamed a smile again. "It's working. Thanks to you. It's fantastic to have some truly, honestly good news."
"No. But the mutants do, and I promised that I would offer my assistance. I am a man of my word in my own way," Loki answered with the same cool smile as Stark slowly ate. "My brother is properly subdued for the moment. My- his mother is with Magneto for safe keeping. As soon as I return, he abdicates the throne, and it's mine as it should have been from the beginning." But would it be? Would it hold? Thor's friends would revolt if they hadn't already. Loki let that go for the moment. "The wheels are already in motion. There's little that can be done about any of it now."
"Of course. Come in, Captain," Scott answered in as business-like a fashion as someone who was barely dressed and obviously freshly awoken could. "Logan?" he called into the other room. "You've got a visitor, and the coffee's almost ready."
Clint was already on his feet and hanging onto the rigger's railing when the plane came to a flawless landing. Having already been warned of the cold, he'd donned his rarely used tunic, but when he stepped out of the plane, he still gasped like he'd been punched. "Jesus, it's cold," he grated, glancing back at Bruce as the scientist tugged on a bomber's jacket and followed him out without batting an eyelash.
"That's a nice way of saying you're going to make sure that you won't' be scooping pieces of the wonder twins and I out of the grating, isn't it?" Tony asked with a quirked eyebrow.
"Please, come in," Coulson answered, stepping aside to let Logan enter. He had a feeling talking had very little to do with it, but there was no reason not to be polite.
Clint picked at the food, taking solace in the friendship surrounding him, even though he wasn't participating directly. It still felt good to have everyone together. He glanced at Phil, reassuring himself of the man's presence.
Simmons' gaze narrowed as if she was trying to discern how much of it was screwing around and how much was a serious tactical discussion. Finally the brunette nodded slowly. "Right, then. Arc reactor it is." She honestly hoped that they might find a way around using Tony even if they used his machinery, but there was no need to tell him that.
It was obvious that Logan could wait no longer. "Now," Scott managed in a husky groan. He didn't care anymore if it hurt, he just needed to feel how much Logan wanted him. He jerked Logan's head up to force the man to look at him. "Do it."
"Not in the slightest," Loki grated.
Steve nodded and let go. He let every inch of the desperate heat he felt unfurl. He held tightly to Tony and let himself believe that he was really holding his lover and that Tony wouldn't disappear again when he opened his eyes. This time it wasn't an ephemeral dream, it was solid, messy, tired-looking reality that was so much better he almost couldn't stand it. "I dreamed about you," Steve murmured breathlessly as they moved. "I hated waking up because you wouldn't be there." The movement of his hips faltered for a second and then resumed, the tension building quickly to a fever pitch. It wouldn't take long. "Gonna wake up to you every day from now on."
Scott was loving the scene not because he felt Coulson deserved the torture, really, but because the easy banter reminded him so much of the mansion. He missed it in a way. He didn't want to go running back. It wasn't his home anymore, but that didn't stop Scott from missing the good old days and the easy interactions with his friends. He was more grateful than ever that Logan was still there and still part of his day to day world.
"It's perfect," Phil answered, cupping Clint's face and returning the kiss, gentle and undemanding, something sweet and pleasant to remind them both that there was more out there than what Creed was capable of. "I'm not going to let him take this way from us." They had just found one another on a romantic level. It had been huge for Phil to allow himself the luxury of connection. Until he'd started talking to Clint, he hadn't realized how long it had been, how many years since he let someone in that close. "Kissing you, holding you, being close to you? That's not something I'm going to give up."
Scott had actually heard himself whimper in protest when Logan left him, but he was soon gasping at the commanding tone of Logan's voice. It was a hell of a lot hotter than it should have been, but there it was. His cock throbbed at the bruising grip on his thighs and the feeling of Logan pressing against him, so close and still so far from where he wanted the man to be. "Fuck me! Please, Logan... god, please, fuck me... I need you, please!" Scott couldn't remember ever hearing his voice so ragged, so filled with need. In that moment, he was fairly certain he would have done anything that Logan asked him to just to get more. He felt the briefest flash of clarity and found himself wondering if Logan was the only one who'd had one or two of his internal threads unraveled.
Clint shivered at the sounds, curled up with his face resting on his arms as his stomach rolled. He wished desperately he could clap his hands over his ears. Hearing Phil whimper in pain while Victor whispered filthy things and moaned was enough to make Clint want to scream. Rage and desperation swirled in him, and he squeezed in tighter around himself as he tried to shut out reality.
"End of the world can at least gimme eight hours a day of personal time," Tony decided between light kisses. He nuzzled at Steve's throat, running his fingers through the blonde's hair. It felt strange to have someone so delicate pressed against him and to know it was Steve. It was different, but someone smaller than him wasn't unfamiliar to Tony, and he still definitely wanted to do more than just make out. He knew Steve wouldn't allow it, though. "Besides, you have to make sure I take care of myself, remember?"
"Yeah, and maybe a little something stronger to go with it." Clint should have known from the start that Phil would be able to detect his presence. No matter how adept he might be at his profession, there simply was no concealing himself from Agent Coulson. "Before you say anything, I'd just like to reiterate I know you're more than capable of taking care of yourself." Clint fixed the other man with a steely look, his brow furrowing as he added, "But I'm not leaving you alone with someone as dangerous as him."
"Though perhaps an insanity defense could help my situation," Loki protested as he pulled his long coat on. He left the helmet aside. If the Avengers were coming in with guns blazing, it would do little good, and if he intended to surrender, looking more vulnerable would likely help. He took a deep breath. The reality of the situation was that if Barton had the hammer, he might not survive long enough to even ask for terms of surrender. "I'll leave the door unlocked. You're free to come out whenever you feel it will be safest. I would... I would recommend waiting until the Brotherhood is properly distracted."
"Uh, hey, so... this isn't the IKEA? I must've taken a wrong turn somewhere around-"
"Don't worry, he isn't mine. Not always. We don't have that kind of arrangement." Nat crossed the room and smirked at Clint before grabbing him by the back of the neck and hauling him into a punishing kiss. "I know how to share."
Logan raised an eyebrow but didn't argue. He was pretty sure, in fact, that he would have rather Scott not get in the line of fire again anytime soon. The man had been through enough, and Logan couldn't help but feel protective of him for that fact. He was quiet for a moment, holding Scott close and relishing the contact. "You do what you gotta do, darlin'. I think you're the one who knows best what you've got to take care of."
Tony nodded, smiling faintly. "See, now you know how I felt," he said, giving his lover a wink. "I'll see if I can argue with the doc to get you out of here," he said, looking at the mass of medications. Allergy pills, asthma meds, a few other things Tony couldn't even recognize. //God. He must've been so sick.// Tony realized that it was probably Steve's strength of will that had even let him survive to adulthood with the kind of medical problems he'd had, especially with no doctor. His gaze fixed on Steve. "I want you home, too." He pressed a few soft kisses to Steve's lips. "Coulson's been on my couch, making sure I sleep. I think I'd rather just have you in my bed." He pushed himself off the edge of the gurney and went back to his wheelchair. "I'll be right back. If you hear yelling, it means I'm negotiating the terms of your release."
Natasha burst out laughing and then covered her mouth. "Sorry, it isn't... no, actually, it's really funny."
At the pronouncement, Phil found himself wondering if he might not just let Clint carry through with his threat, crowd be damned because he's wondered about that. With Natasha, Clint has always seemed to take a submissive role, and yet Phil had never seen something like it with a man. It suddenly made perfect sense. The hard line in the sand had absolutely nothing to do with gender and absolutely everything to do with trust, and he felt like an idiot for not putting that together. Phil returned the soft kiss and couldn't help smiling. "Not that I wouldn't be okay with things the other way around too," he assured firmly, "but I'm glad. When the time's right and we're ready and you're comfortable with it, I would really like to make love to you."
Steve licked his way into Tony's mouth and savored the rich taste of him, the bitterness of the cum and the traces of his coffee from breakfast. Steve was barely breathing by the time their lips parted again, and he didn't care. "Not sure I want to get up from the floor again," he confessed, pulling Tony half into his lap instead. "In fact, I know I don't want to. This feels too good."
"You say that like there's a corner of El Paso that isn't shitty," Phil answered, looking around. He felt dizzy from the thought that they were alone and free. The wilderness he could deal with. They both knew how to survive worse than a shirtless night out in the desert. With Victor out of the way, he breathed in deeply. There weren't any fumes hanging in the air, which meant they were farther from a busy road than he liked. With no food or water, they only had so much energy to expend. Knowing that if there was an advantage to be caught visually, Clint would catch it, he pressed, "See anything promising?"
"Don't push it, or I'm gonna have to mess up your pretty latex kinksuit," Logan warned.
Clint groaned, reaching up and hooking his fingers over Coulson's hips as he worked the man's cock a little deeper into his throat. He could tell it was going to be a little tough to talk the next day, and he didn't give a damn. It felt good to see Phil losing it, to know he was the one causing it. Phil lost it in a much calmer fashion than most of Clint's partners, but knowing how well the man kept himself together in the field made it that much clearer how much he was falling apart now. The archer felt his eyes water as he pushed to get more of Phil down his throat and found himself wondering just how that thick shaft would feel inside him. He felt an answering throb from his own cock and moaned softly as his eyes rose to Phil's face once more.
Bruce cleared his throat. "You may or may not have also dragged in someone who broke Manhattan. And Stark used to make a living off of war. Really, Thor and Steve are about the only two who might have a clean past to stand on. And I don't know that much about Thor," he pointed out with a faint smile. "All things considered, he sort of fits into this collection of misfit toys."
"Not to worry, sir. We have plenty of friends to help." She giddily pointed out a robot arm already reaching out to seat the hammer properly on the pedestal.
"As I'm going to be," Scott answered, though he smiled faintly. The truth was that he felt okay for the moment. He felt better being at Logan's side than he would have being separated from the team. The next time around, he knew it would probably be different. For now he wasn't ready to allow too much space, not where Loki was concerned. He wanted to know that things were dealt with, not just hear about it.
Logan growled as if in answer, squeezing Scott's shaft a little tighter. He worked to stretch Scott further before finally withdrawing his hand and using it to hook his lover's knee up onto the bed next to Logan's hip. Letting go of Scott's cock, Logan took himself in hand and looked up at his lover with fierce, demanding eyes. "C'mon... Sit on it," he demanded, sounding almost impatient. They were moving fast. Too fast, really. But Logan wanted Scott too much, too immediately to go slow.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sif looked almost as furious as Natasha at the revelation. "It will not go unpunished."
The archer couldn't help but chuckle as he leaned back, raising a teasing eyebrow at Phil. "Hmm, are you telling me that the mighty Agent Phil Coulson's self discipline is that easy to wear down? Or am I just that good?" he asked, casually taking a bite of food, his face immediately far more innocent than it had been a moment ago. "Then again, I'm pretty sure you're seducing the hell out of me with this omelette, so maybe I shouldn't be so judgmental."
Tony nodded at that, unsure whether his being awake was really such a good thing after all. “Whatever those meds were, they knocked me out big time. And that never happens. I’ll have to make a note to take a doggy bag home.” Flippancy came to Tony with the ease of breathing. He’d always fallen back on it when things got too serious. Not only did it help him to think, but it also managed to put everyone around him off guard. “Do you think they’ll be springing me out of here soon?” he wondered aloud. “I’d really like to get back to work on some things; important things.”
Clint had to remind himself not to be a little jealous. He knew Nat's comments were about anything but sex, but it didn't help him feel a little bit like the new guy was one-upping him without even trying. He appreciated Phil offering to tase Logan, though he couldn't help but wish the agent actually had reason to do so.
Coulson answered with a faint smile. They both knew better. Steve could get Tony to do things that no other human being on Earth likely could, but that didn’t make him a miracle worker, or at least not enough of one to facilitate quite so drastic a resolution. “I’ll try asking him. In the meantime, I’m thinking of talking to Fitz. He’s young, but he’s bright, forward-thinking. He’s honestly the best bet after Stark.” The fact that Fitz didn’t have any entrenched thoughts about how he approached problems would leave him free to be more creative in solving Bucky’s particularly unique issue. “Assuming we can keep Barnes from strangling him.”
"Sir, I'll go get my gear." Clint was halfway to the door before Fury's voice staid him.
"He was lucid at-"
"I was thinkin' more about beer and killin' cute forest animals for food," Logan replied, remembering his rude awakening that morning. The fact that Stark had dragged them to a gay bar was starting to seem less surprising. Then again, Steve had mentioned a parade of women, nothing about men. //Unless playboy's into high-priced drag queens.// Logan hesitated. "So..." //I'm gonna regret this...// "...what about the two o' you?"
"Phil's more private about that kind of thing," Natasha answered simply. "What happened with us was a one off. Normally he'd consider sleeping with an asset decidedly unprofessional." Given that he was currently off doing god only knew what with Clint, she knew it seemed counter-intuitive. "I'm hoping things with Clint will be a little different. They both deserve something different." She wasn't in mourning at the potential loss of one of her favorite bed mates. Whether the three of them came to an understanding or not, Natasha wanted Clint happy a lot more than she needed to get laid. "What about the two of you?"
"And they won't be able to do anything. We both know this isn't in my body."
"I like you," Logan decided, giving Sif a smile. He dragged Scott into a long kiss, audience be damned. He didn't know when or if he'd see his lover again, and he wasn't going to worry about someone feeling a little uncomfortable. "Be careful," he said. "You'll be fine."
Tony didn't give anyone a chance to argue further, especially when Nat had the decency to smirk at Steve's near-sneaky tactics. He grabbed the blonde by the hand and tugged him out of the room. "I think thirty minutes was a little bit conservative, but I have to give you points for craftiness," Tony admitted, smirking proudly.
"Fuck off," Darien groaned.
Once he'd gotten cleaned up, he moved back to the waiting room. He was so exhausted that he fell asleep almost as soon as he stopped moving, his head propped back against the wall.
Relieved to hear that Xavier was open to hearing what they had to say, Phil recounted briefly what had happened and how Natasha had been taken captive. "Loki knows more than we do. He has whatever Logan had, and that means we're already a few pages behind in this story. We can't afford to be. We're all on even ground when it comes to Loki and what to expect from him, but the X-Men know Magneto. You could help us come out of this with a lot fewer casualties if it gets ugly."
One man stepped forward, "Our King has asked-"
"We couldn't get any more than we had," Bruce reminded her gently. "Remember? It was creating too much interference." He frowned. "My fault, really. That we decided to keep Clint from using it again. I thought we were going to protect everyone. Just like I thought I was protecting Steve by not helping with the serum." He sighed, then smiled ruefully. "Guess it's time I learned to quit being such a mother hen, huh?"
Steve nodded firmly. "That means Iron Man, Banner, you're with me." He trusted both men, and more than that, he trusted Tony to help if anything went wrong with the Hulk. For whatever reason, even as a "big green rage monster," as Tony liked to call him, Iron Man seemed to be a soft spot for Hulk. That was just fine by Steve. "Remember, we're going to keep him from hurting anyone - not to get ourselves hurt." His gaze lingered for a moment on Clint and Phil across the room. "No one's got permission to come back injured. This fight's going to take more than one round knowing Loki, and I need all of you. Any questions?"
Clint nodded. "Good call." The last few minutes of the flight were made in silence. When they landed, the sun was just beginning to come up. Clint hopped out of the aircraft and gestured to Darien to follow him into the tower. "The Director's busy dealing with a recent... fiasco. Normally, Agent Coulson would debrief you, but he's busy as well. I'll be giving you the rundown tomorrow, late morning." He led the way into the residential part of the tower. "I figure you could use some rest and a chance to clean up. We've got some clothes that will fit you and toiletries in a suite."
"Again I am forced to wonder why it is you're not dead," Loki returned, not even bothering to look at Coulson. He only had eyes for the hammer. "That was forged by my people - my true people - and it would be a very good time for you to return it."
Logan shook his head at the two. Anyone else would've been thumping their chest at the grouping. She'd emptied a full magazine into the target, and it took a good eye to tell that more than three bullets had passed through the central ring. "Sweetheart, I don't think you gotta worry about anything survivin' that, anyway."
Steve didn't bother with a verbal reply. It was too much fun watching Tony fall apart. He stared at the gorgeous man beneath him and angled his thrusts to try and get the most out of every one. It wouldn't take either one of them long, he could see that from the way Tony twisted beneath him. That didn't mean it had to be anything less than spectacular. Steve wondered if he could talk Tony into staying with him after they got inside, if they could curl up together and just sleep. "Open your eyes," he pleaded gently. "Let me see you."
Natasha abandoned the blond girl to sidle up next to Scott and Logan. "I really should have taken bets on this one. I thought Clint would take longer to crack."
"I'm not sure he wants to see your fun," Steve countered, though he had to admit that Tony had a point. He wasn't eager to get back into the Tower either, and he had absolutely no defenses against the other man's proximity. He looked around and felt his heart pounding in his chest. Dancing in public was one thing, but someone could come out to one of the few cars scattered throughout the garage at any moment. //That's the point,// Steve told himself as he caught the smirk on Tony's face. "After the other night, I guess it's a little late to pretend I'm not that kind of guy." Normally he was anything but that kind of guy, but Steve doubted many people could refuse Tony. Instead of trying, Steve closed the distance between them and brushed his lips gently against Tony's.
Steve's polite attempts not to ogle the other man were quickly derailed by Tony bending over in nothing but a towel. It was impossible to pretend that what he was feeling was anything but attraction. The thought was confusing on more than a few levels, so Steve settled for the best solution he could manage on short notice: distracting both of them. "I'm sure it'll be great. Hey, if you don't mind... someday... I'd love to see some family photos. Sound silly, but it's hard to picture Howard with a wife and a kid."
“It’s Fury’s orders. Safety. We think we got it all out, but-”
"It's a little late for dinner, so I was thinking cold pizza from the fridge, beer, and bed. Unless you just want to skip to the bed part. I'm pretty okay with that." Scott knew he wasn't being the picture of reserved patience, but he didn't care. He's spent half the day expecting them to find what was left of Logan in a box on the doorstep, and he wasn't in the mood to play coy. "Then once we're in bed, I'd really like to get laid."
Fitz nodded until he could finish the huge bite of pizza. "The nanobots are coming along. They're more active than ever, and..." He continued on rambling in a bit too much detail about the specs until he realized that Steve was probably listening only to be polite and trailed off. "Er, well, it's an improvement."
"Love you too. So fucking much," Scott answered, his filter more or less gone. It had less to do with being too hot and bothered to think and more to do with the fact that he wanted Logan to know that there weren't any stops on. When they were together, Logan got everything - good and bad. He met Logan's gaze, his own eyes dark and in the dim light of the apartment. "I want you to leave a mark or two." It went without saying, really, or he hoped it would, but Scott was tired of looking at his fading bruises and having no idea who'd made them. He wanted something that made him Logan's again, a mark that he could see and feel to remind him that he belonged to someone.
Tony Stark dragged another handful of files from his rollout laptop to the floating monitors posted around the airship's lab. Screams, angry growls, and firearm blasts from five different videos of varying quality and clarity blared from the room's surround sound, and Tony winced internally as he beheld the mess the subject of the films was capable of creating. "Fury's been eating paint chips. Banner's enough of a handful." He glanced up as Steve walked through the door. "Oh, good. Then they told you we've got a new project, Cap?" He flipped one of the screens around so that Steve could see it and hit the slow button.
Bruce's expression darkened momentarily, but Simmons' haggard appearance along with her words served to keep him from chasing her off. He was silent for a long moment before he nodded slowly. "Alright, fine," he said, reaching back to grab his glasses case and stepping out to follow the young woman to the lab. "Maybe... maybe there are some things we can try." He felt terrified at the idea of playing with the serum, but maybe, just maybe, Fitz-Simmons would be the key to making it work. Simmons was right. The Avengers needed Steve to be the Cap again. Everyone in the tower did, in fact.
Natasha's expression twisted, and her jaw tensed. She felt sick just thinking about it. Tony was nothing to Loki, but laying him to rest would have meant everything to Steve. The idea that on top of it all, he held in his hands the two men who were the closest thing she'd ever had to family left her feeling sick. "I don't care what he did to me. We're going to find a way to get to Asgard and kick Thor in the balls until we get some answers. He should have killed Loki before. Now we're all paying the price."
Clint gave Phil a quick peck on the cheek. "Donuts and movies," he echoed as he released his safety harness and stood. His hand wrapped around the hammer's handle, and an odd smile touched his lips as he stalked toward the rear of the plane. "Let's go break some heads."
They walked steadily toward their destination, Clint making a point to bring up old goof-ups and stories from missions they'd shared and even the rare few they hadn't. He tried to keep it light, funny, anything to distract them from the misery of recent events and the soreness in their bodies. Finally, as they neared the electrical pole Clint had spotted - with the sun just threatening on the horizon - Clint was relieved to catch sight of an actual gas station. "Thank god," he remarked. They picked up the pace a little in anticipation, and it didn't take them long to cover the last three miles.
They walked in silence to Director Fury's office and found the man in an ill temper. "They're lying to us."
"Lady Sif, what can you tell us?" Fury began at once.
The medical team swarmed in, taking Natasha, barely conscious, away with them. By the time they were heading to the medical ward, Coulson had heard and appeared to follow along with Clint. "Was she awake?" he asked, stepping quickly to try to keep up with the orderlies checking vitals and trying to get the woman to talk. Even as they walked, Clint texted Steve to let him know. Fury, of course, would have already heard. "Did she say anything?"
Steve smiled until he reached up to touch Tony's face and felt the tears. "Hey, I'm here. I'm fine." He carefully kissed away the trails of tears and then Tony's lips. If he'd had a choice, he would have told Tony to stay there in bed with him for a week instead of working, but they both knew that wasn't an option. "We aren't losing this. It's too good, Tony. We shouldn't even both be here now in the same time and place. That has to mean something."
Bruce sighed and absently began cleaning his glasses on the tail of his shirt. “Me too. For Steve’s sake if nothing else. I heard some chatter. Was it as bad as they said?”
Clint nodded, feeling relieved. He pressed his head to Phil's shoulder, trying to focus on being with his lover even as flashes of what Creed had done to him flickered through his mind. Clint felt himself shiver a little. Some of it had actually felt good, much as he hadn't wanted it to. He knew Phil had probably heard him moan a few times, and that as much as anything made him burn with guilt. Clint took a deep breath, trying to bring himself back to the moment. "I... I'm sorry. About... I'm sorry you had to hear. I'm sorry," he managed, unable to quite articulate what he was thinking.
Even Fitz looked moved by the idea. "Maybe we shouldn't do the extra poking and prodding and giving him a hard time bit. Sounds like he might have that all on his own."
"It's okay," Phil assured, "but considering we're supposed to be watching a movie..." He gave Clint a gentle nudge. Natasha was a patient woman, but she would only appreciate them pushing the boundaries so far. Even assassins with the patience of saints could only stand so much. "I don't want her killing you in your sleep. You're so nice and warm."
Steve grinned up at the other man. He settled happily next to his lover and curled himself around Tony. With his head on the pillow, he gazed at Tony with what could only be called adoration. "You're beautiful like that... lost in the moment..." Steve's fingers trailed gently down over to the arc reactor. Knowing what it was holding at bay scared him. The thin line between safe and dead when it came to Tony was too tenuous. "There's no way to take the shrapnel out?" he asked after a long silence.
Clint raised an eyebrow, surprised by that. Tony was essentially offering up the person who mattered most to him for the person who mattered most to Clint. Maybe he didn't know that. But still... The archer idly wondered how many completely selfless acts the billionaire could commit in the space of a few months before reality collapsed.
"I d-don't think either of us want that," the physicist managed, his voice shaky and breathless as if he'd been running. The whole situation was pissing him off. He wanted to keep it together, but he couldn't help Steve and Tony as he was. Then he noted the flash of light and heard Clint's panicked voice over the comm right before Victor's flying form barreled into him with the force of a runaway train.
Fury shook his head and looked to Phil. "Agent Coulson. You didn't have much trouble convincing Stark to cooperate before..."
Loki chuckled and rolled onto his back next to the man. "As if it would ever be anything else with me." He clucked his tongue at the implication despite not sounding terribly offended. He didn't take lovers often, but that just meant that he felt it was even more important to make the time count. Of course, with the exception of Creed, lately it seemed that all of his lovers remained so only by some form of compulsion. Loki sighed heavily and let his eyes drift closed. "You will find that when I choose to be, I can be a worthwhile partner in more than one sense."
Since subtle hadn't worked at all, Steve took another step back, his hands on Logan's shoulders, and created pointed distance between them. "Look, I had a lot of fun the other night, but I'm not looking for a repeat performance. I'm with Tony. Period." Having some fun together was one thing, but when it came to something deeper, Steve wasn't interested in sharing his affections. "I'm sorry if I wasn't clear about that. We should have all sat down and talked about it, and I apologize if there was confusion. I... I need to go get some dinner. Anything I can pick up for you and Scott?" he asked, carefully including the other man's name in the hope of jogging Logan's memory as to who he should really be worried about. The gravity of the man's actions struck him a moment later. Logan doesn't have blue eyes. He'd been avoiding holding eye contact for too long, but Steve suddenly tensed. "Maybe you could use a little rest. I could walk you back to your room. Where were you headed?"
By the time he needed to take a breath, Steve’s heart was pounding, and he could barely force himself to stop. It helped that Tony didn’t seem to have a lot more restraint. He wasn’t scared, just smiling and a little breathless himself. Steve rested his forehead against Tony’s. “That is definitely something I could get used to doing on a regular basis… y’know, if you don’t mind.”
Nat's gaze narrowed, but she said nothing. Phil hadn't told anyone a lot about his recovery, and Fury had said even less. "In other words, Fury wasn't bluffing when he said Loki's dangerous."
As the world exploded into chaos, Natasha drifted wordlessly inside the cell and closer to Logan, who was clutching the gun as ordered. "Go take care of Scott. If we need two response teams, it would be good to know that now." She nodded toward the door. "No one's going to be paying attention enough to stop you."
Tony chimed in, "Hey, I haven't said one word about-"
No response was forthcoming, but Steve entered the room a few moments later with a bag full of soda and a stack of pizza and breadsticks. "Hey, sorry - they took forever." He stole a kiss from Tony and then set the pizza down on the barest counter he could find. "I hope nobody-" Steve fished his phone out of his pocket once his hands were free and nodded at the message there. He leaned in to whisper into Tony's ear, "You can meet me somewhere tonight," before ducking away and pulling some paper plates out of the bag. "Dig in, folks. I got cheese, pepperoni, and some kind of special thing with lots of vegetables."
By the time he felt truly warm, the medics had already given him leave to get out of the infirmary. Steve was up at once and dressing as quickly as possible. He couldn't just lay there while Tony was somewhere undergoing god only knew what kind of torture.
"Standoffish only works half the time. Other half, girls just think it's cool," he said, taking a deep breath as they entered the restaurant. "Woah... Smells amazin'. Only way it'd be better is if I killed it myself." There were even craft beers. //Nice... real nice.//
"Oh, of course. I'll keep checking things out, and if I find anything that's at all amiss, I'll let you both know immediately, but," Jemma assured hurriedly, "I don't anticipate any issues."
"If you'll excuse me, I'm here for someone in particular." Quickly the Winter Soldier raised a tranq gun and fired.
"Mhm," Tony agreed distractedly. Deciding he'd teased them both enough, he fixed wicked dark eyes on Steve's face and, holding firmly to the base of the man's cock, slowly took the head and part of the shaft into his mouth. He let his eyes slowly drift nearly shut, moaning as the taste of his lover filled his mouth.
Tony winced a little as the two virtually attacked each other. It was a visceral sight, and Tony found himself wanting to participate and yet genuinely convinced that doing so might result in serious injury. He settled for the moment for just watching, wondering again how smart it had been to bring Logan into the Avengers or into his bed.
Scott leaned back against Logan with a happy sigh and snatched the last shot from the tray, downing it. "You still up to being our designated driver, baby?"
Coulson thought that through carefully. The truth was it had been a long time. A very long time. He wasn't sure when he'd realized that he felt something more than the usual tight, sick nervousness in his chest when Clint was in danger. It took Coulson awhile to see that line silence when Clint was in the field hurt him more deeply than it should have. "A long time," he confessed. "I'm not sure when it started. Somewhere along the way... You were a real pain in the ass at first, but somewhere in there, I started looking forward to working with you more than working with anyone."
It was easy to put on a show with such good material to work with. There wasn't a chance in hell that Natasha would let the man cum, but she wanted to make sure Logan was hot and hard and ready. "When I'm done with you, I want to see you bend Scott over that bed and fuck him - assuming you’re both interested in that."
"Jesus!" The exclamation left Clint in a harsh breath as he watched Phil hurriedly swallow his cock down. The archer locked his knees, pressing himself into the wall to keep his legs from buckling. His fingers scrabbled at the cool wall behind him as if trying to gain purchase on his sanity, and Clint panted helplessly, thumping his head back against the wall and moaning, a long, low sound that seemed to vibrate through his whole being. He hadn't expected the eagerness. He sure as hell hadn't expected to see his cock disappear down Coulson's throat in one swift, sure motion.
"That's exactly what he's doing," Coulson agreed. “Given our earlier exchange, I thought you might not like me being here. I feel safer with back up." Phil looked down at himself and then back up at Logan. "Training aside, I tend to think it might not be precisely a fair fight if it came to that." He spread his hands in a placating gesture. "I'm finished here. If you don't mind, I'll get back to my work, and you and Mr. Summers can relax."
Phil watched the blush creep up over Clint's cheeks and suddenly felt far less certain than he had two seconds before about Clint not having meant that nearly the way it sounded. Because Clint Barton was not attracted to him. Couldn't be, really. The world wasn't that strange a place. "I am capable of relaxing," Phil assured him in a neutral tone instead of thinking too hard about it. "I did yesterday morning." The time spent out and about with Clint was actually his favorite recent memory. He'd felt more at ease and more himself than he had in a long time.
Clint tilted his head. He didn't like the idea he was thinking the same way as Fury. "Well, look at it this way: if Fury was doing some kind of crazy hocus-pocus to get you back, he must think a lot of you." Fury had called Coulson his 'one good eye'. That had been rather telling in and of itself. "I'm sure he'll tell you when you need to know. That's his thing," Clint assured, giving Phil a faint smile as if to reassure the man.
Coulson wasn't surprised to find Clint waiting for him the garage and couldn't help smiling at the sight. People could call Lola a mid life crisis all they wanted. The car and Clint together made for a beautiful visual. "Climb in." Coulson had opted for dark jeans and a button down to avoid a repeat of the experience of being called in on an emergency basis while wearing a t-shirt. They began the drive in companionable silence, the radio playing some low key, middle of the road mix of oldies and modern top 40.
Already pale after the attack, the remaining color drained from Bucky’s face as he balked at Steve. “Better? How could me remember doing God knows what possibly be better?” The outburst pained him, but it kept on rolling like a runaway train. “Don’t you get it? If what just happened was a preview, then I don’t want to remember!” He drew himself away from Steve, feeling not only angry but a sense of betrayal. “If Tony Stark was sitting here I’ll bet you wouldn’t be putting him through this.” The words stung, and Bucky promptly shut himself up. Where had that come from? “Steve,” he started, ashamed of his actions. “Look, I’m sorry. Hell, I don’t know what’s wrong with me. No, that’s not true. I do know.” Bucky glanced up, his eyes dark and filled with regret. “I’m jealous. Jealous of the feelings you have for Tony. It’s what I’ve always wanted you to feel for me, but I never had the guts to come out and tell you back then.”
It was then that Clint remembered the surveillance. He tensed, doing his best to not look like he'd just been caught with a dead body. He'd known Coulson too long to think that that tone of voice was anything but bad news. Shouldering his bow, he did his best to look like it was business as usual as he replied with a terse, "Yes, sir," and followed Phil out of the cell block.
Scott's eyes fell closed, and his back arched against Logan's mouth. It stung a bit being stretched open, but not nearly enough for him to want the man to stop. He pushed his hips back against the contact to illustrate wordlessly just how badly he wanted it. No matter what Loki had done, they'd figure out a way to get through it. Whatever Logan's failings, he was kinder and gentler than he ever wanted anyone to see.
Surprise lit up Bucky's features. Barring Steve, he had not expected anyone to want to talk about those long ago days. His mind flashed back to grainy images of barbed wire and mud, the deafening sound of artillery and the smell of blood. Just as quickly, Bucky found himself back in the infirmary with Agent Coulson. "We would've been dead ten times over if Steve hadn't dragged our asses out of the fire," Bucky said in a faraway voice. "If anyone deserves admiration, it's Steve... not me."
Scott didn't like pissing people off. Battles of wills and sparring matches were one thing. Logan looking at him like he was the enemy was something else, something he'd seen too often at the end of his time with Jean. He didn't want to screw things up and lose the man, but he was starting to worry that he already had.
Clint relished the way Phil looked at him, touched him like he was a piece of art. His eyes flicked open at the question and he looked down at the scar Phil was referring to. "Undercover in Iraq," he said with a faint smile. "Some of those infantrymen are a little... rough around the edges. Got shanked with a multitool for... well, I have a big mouth sometimes." The potential underlying meaning of that statement caught up a moment later, and Clint's smirk turned into a wicked grin. "In more than one way."
Steve sighed. He hadn't wanted the night to end so early, especially not to have it end with Fury paging them. That rarely meant anything good. "Guess it is. Just don't think you're off the hook for a sleepover tonight... assuming we get to sleep," he added with a groan. Reluctantly they both found their clothes and dressed for the drive back. Showing up disheveled with Tony on his arm was one thing, but showing up naked wasn't on Steve's to do list. For one thing Clint would never, ever let either of them live it down. "I can't wait to see what corner of the sky is falling today. Then again, we should be grateful. I don't think anybody's tried to kill me in at least a week."
"I do try to keep you around, sir."
Steve didn’t look so sure, but he crossed over to the bed anyway and tried to smile. “How are you doing?” He didn’t know what Coulson or anyone else had been obligated to do to keep Bucky down.
"Hm. Would have liked to have seen that." Natasha sank back down onto the bench in her cell. "Do me a favor and tell Stark to hurry... if he can stop making out with his boyfriend long enough."
When they got there, Clint was reluctant to leave Phil's side, but he knew he needed to. They both needed their privacy for the whole process. The docs gave him an intrusive once over before deciding he needed an antibiotic shot and stitching up about half the claw marks in his back. They wanted an immediate psych evaluation as well, but Clint begged them off, pleading exhaustion. They did insist on him getting a shower and handed him some simple grey sweats and a white shirt to change into.
Bruce picked up the prototype and made sure Fitz-Simmons were out the door before giving Tony a pointed look and stepping out as well.
Tony gasped and shivered at the other man's touch. His mind trapped in a haze due to the truth serum, Tony could not think clearly. "I... I want to... fuck him... fuck him so hard he screams my name..." Unable to control himself, he was revealing things he'd only ever dreamed of, and the thought of bending Steve Rogers over, devouring that perfect ass, and fucking him into submission made Tony Stark hard as the Iron Man suit he'd built.
"I would have said shockingly easy, though apparently the results are ultimately mixed in terms of their success. Since I've already failed with you, there's not much point in spending more time on the problem. Now, who else would like to go on a little trip, hmm?" Loki smiled for all the world as if he wasn't the least bit worried about what any of them might do. "Wolverine, is it? You'd do rather nicely... so much rage."
Waking up hurt. It wasn't like the usual sore stiffness that came with the morning after a mission. It was like waking up underwater, like trying to breathe with a clamp around his chest. The air smelled odd, tasted strange. Steve couldn't force his eyes open at all at first. He felt something warm against his side and finally managed to pry his eyelids open to see Tony lying next to him, his shoulders shaking with sobs. Steve tried to say the man's name but couldn't find his voice. He managed to twitch his fingers in the man's grip.
The mere mention of Hydra set something off deep inside of Bucky. It was like touching a raw nerve ending, shocking his system. For a brief moment the dark fog clouding his mind lifted and Bucky was no longer himself. His whole demeanor changed in that instant, his jaw hardening and his body tense with hatred. He leaped from his chair, grabbing Coulson by the throat and slammed him against the nearest wall.
"Director, if we're finished, I'd like to speak with you privately," Coulson ventured. It didn't sound like they had much more to talk about until the lab rats had a chance to do their work, and even then he really wasn't confident in much of an outcome.
"A bar," Clint replied without elaborating. He lead the way to the garage and hopped onto his motorcycle, gesturing for Darien to get on the back. He knew it was probably a little mean considering the abuse Darien's rear had just been through, but it was the only wheels Clint had, and the archer wasn't really concerned with Darien's comfort anyway.
Bruce nodded, reluctantly letting go of Jemma's waist only to place his hands on her shoulders. "I'll do that. But get what rest you can. We may need you two to solve things long-range for us." He gave her a gentle squeeze, then pulled her in for another kiss before offering her one last smile. "I'll see you tomorrow. Have some coffee ready for me when we get back. I get the feeling there won't be time before we leave." With another wave, Bruce disappeared down the hallway.
Finally decided, Steve looked down, shrugged and answered, "Yeah. It's not weird where I come from, you know?" He looked up to check if Tony understood at all. "I wasn't married, I wasn't in love, so... it never happened." Tony could call him "old man" as often as he liked, but he'd just celebrated his twenty-fifth birthday if you happened not to count the years he'd spent buried in the ice. Steve was fighting hard not to feel weird about being a virgin. Once upon a time, that would have been considered a noble thing, the moral thing. "Things are so different now, it's hard to find somebody. Even if I did, there's not many people who get it." The painful truth was that Steve simply wasn't sure he could find that deep a connection with someone considering how few people really understand what he'd been through.
Scott stared back as intensely as he could manage but broke first, grinning and then leaning in to kiss Logan almost gently. It wasn't chaste, but it was soft. "I'm not chickening out," he murmured before sealing their mouths together in an even less innocent kiss. His hands rose to trail up Logan's side in a ticklish fashion before settling on his hips. The man was solid muscle. Scott thrilled at the realization of the restrained strength against his body. "Tonight maybe I can show you." He wasn't interested in the idea of trying things out the first time feeling like a wrung out washcloth. "I'll even cook you some dinner. Make it romantic."
"Yeah. Guess so," Logan said, though his voice still sounded tense. "If they get the nerve to actually ask a question, instead o' makin' hints at me, maybe we'll talk." Nevermind that Coulson had been pretty direct. Logan stalked over to the fridge and dug out a beer. He glanced back at Scott, looking suddenly more relaxed, more casual. "Somethin' to drink?"
"Yeah, just do us a favor and wash your socks once or twice a month, alright?" Tony chimed in.
Steve sucked in a breath, belatedly realizing what Thor was thinking. He closed his eyes for a second and then steeled himself. "She's taking it pretty hard," he agreed mildly before moving onto the next leg of the verbal journey. It hurt like hell to talk about. It hurt like hell using the past tense when he talked about Tony. "Tony and Pepper broke up awhile ago - it... well, it was messy, but they were okay. Friends." He met Thor's gaze and managed a wavering smile. "We were together. Me and Tony." The smile broke, and it was suddenly damn hard to breathe through the pain. //Were.//
Tony momentarily looked like a deer caught in the headlights. He slowly put his food and coffee aside, lips pressed together as his nerves rattled him to his core. He was never good at this sort of thing. He always knew the perfect thing to say to get someone to sleep with him, the perfect comeback for any insult, the perfect way to tell someone to fuck off, but when it came to telling someone he liked them... loved them, he was all thumbs. He wrapped his hands over Steve's forearms, tugging the man closer, looking into his eyes. "You're so sweet and gorgeous and smart and I... Steve, I..." Tony bit his bottom lip. With none of his usual suavity, he jerked the blonde into a hard kiss, drawing away after only a moment and laying his head against Steve's chest. "Love you, too," he finally managed to mumble, even managing to say it loud enough for a normal person to hear it.
"Well..." Clint glanced at Nat, then back to Phil. Outing the man in front if them all might have been crossing the line, but since they were already in pretty personal territory and he had Natasha’s blessing, Clint didn’t care. She would keep Phil from murdering him. "I hear," Clint said, quirking an eyebrow and giving Phil what was supposed to be a mock smoldering look but felt a little more sincere than he would have liked, "that you've got some pretty impressive equipment." Clint felt himself blush faintly as he said the words, but he was still too amused to feel self conscious about it.
"I can do that," Scott answered, and he knew he could with Logan. He knew he wouldn't get shut down or made fun of, and that was a rather large revelation. He let it sink in and smiled up at the other man. "That goes both ways. If I'm not comfortable with something, I'll tell you, or if I'd like to but not yet or... whatever. You don't have to sell what you want short because you think I might not be on board."
Coulson took all of two seconds to process the information, file away what he couldn't handle, and formulate the best plan. "Barton, go make sure Romanov is okay. Get the cuffs off first. If anyone says anything, tell them they're welcome to come and speak with me directly." He paused. "Point out that right now would be a terrible time for them to come and speak to me directly. You know where we'll be." There was no way Tony could get himself to the infirmary. He was shaking and looked on the verge of passing out himself. Coulson had never seen the man so emotional about anything, so broken up and out of his element. It hurt, but Coulson pushed the hurt off to the side, made sure Clint knew what to do, and began pushing Tony's chair toward medical.
"Hey, at least I had my clothes on." He glanced at his two passengers. "I had my clothes on, right?" Tony looked back at the phone on Steve's thigh. "Hey, I know no one's surprised by anything I do anymore, so if you're gonna get all butthurt that America's golden child likes men, I think this could turn a lot uglier, dear Director. I'll loan you some of my PR guys. I'm sure they can spin it." Without waiting for a reply, he reached over and shut off Steve's cellphone.
They had some things to work through. Clint did especially with years of being madly in love with someone who simply couldn't feel the same way. Phil understood. "Well, that's a bad habit, then. We'll have to change that. You should be hearing it at least daily." Though he wasn't by any means angry with Natasha for the way things had gone - Phil understood well enough that she had her own issues, plenty of them - he couldn't help but feel awful that for so many years, Clint had gone without the attention he really deserved. He'd been taking what he could get. He shouldn't have to wait for what was left over.  Phil kept the introspection to himself and simply stroked his fingers through Clint's hair and over his back, soothing and maintaining gentle contact at all times. "I'll make a note on my calendar."
Scott knew he should hold back and take more time, but it didn't feel like they had any. Instead he began lowering himself onto Logan's cock as slowly as he could convince himself to move. The burning stretch stole his breath, and Scott's lungs burned when he finally managed a shaky inhale and his body relaxed. At last his hips were flush against Logan's, his fingers clenched against the man's chest.
"No, it's not," Steve answered. He knew that Tony was trying to diffuse the situation. It was a noteworthy thing since he knew it was entirely for his benefit. It was sweet, but it was also completely wrong. "Tony, I'm not going to hide who I am. If my sexuality is more important than what I've done and what I believe, then... then people might as well stop liking me now," he finished resolutely. Logan was right - SHIELD had some very definite reasons to want to cover up him being anything less than perfection. Unfortunately that meant walking on eggshells in a way that Steve just wasn't sure would work in a world so addicted to finding reasons to pull people off of pedestals. Another thought struck him, and Steve found himself studying Tony's face with growing unease. There was also the possibility he was being naive in thinking his own sexuality was the only thing at issue. "Unless... you'd rather people not know... about us?"
Clint groaned and rolled his eyes as he heard the exchange over his earpiece. "You must be stressed, Stark. That pun was terrible," he hissed as Natasha dropped into the room ahead of them. He didn't get a chance to dwell on it, though, as four short, sharp blades sliced through the ducting in front of him, narrowly missing his face. Clint shifted back, though with Coulson behind him there wasn't far to go. One meaty, powerful hand sank claws into his vest and its blast-proof plating and dragged him out, using his body to widen the opening.
That would be never. He would never be ready to walk into the lab and see Tony not in it. The thought left him panicked, so he assured, "A-after I have something to eat. Thank you, Jarvis."
"I have a feelin' they won't let 'er near them. I hear the Geneva Convention's not real popular in Russia," Logan said, smirking at the thought of her beating Piotr unmercifully. Hell, Logan himself would be tempted to do the same given the chance. He might even be tempted to hit Mystique, though battering women without provocation wasn't really his thing. He'd learned long ago that women weren't by any stretch the 'weaker sex,' but... well, he was a little old-fashioned, maybe.
Scott acquiesced without a moment's hesitation. Scott braced his hands flat on the bed and presented his bare ass to Clint's hungry gaze. "What are you waiting for?" Scott was achingly hard and needed Clint with a hunger that he didn't understand.
For the second time in a span of minutes, Scott clung to Logan again. He needed the anchor this time. Guilty questions swirled through his head. Had Logan struck a deal with Loki? Did his possible new gift explain why Romanov was still being held captive? Scott couldn't voice the questions. If it wasn't true, he'd be asking Logan something that couldn't be un-asked. He might be breaking the fragile new bond between them. He also didn't want to know if it was true because he wasn't sure he could live with that. Instead Scott breathed deep and stroked Logan's back. "I don't mean to go all catatonic, I just... I never thought I'd have a shot at this."
"Don't worry, already planning to kill him. Slowly. Painfully. If Logan's nice, I'll let him help." The bad blood between them was obvious from a million miles away. Everything about Logan screamed "family problems." It was true of most of them, so Steve wasn't bothered. As he spoke, Steve drifted down to kiss Tony's neck, soft, gentle touches of lips to skin. "I'm going to do a whole lot more of this and be a whole lot less gentle about it."
Logan watched the woman warily, claws already poised for battle. "Yeah. Are you a good alien, or a bad alien?"
"You forgot killing Phil." Tony raised an eyebrow at the strange twitch that got out of Fury, but stayed focused on the subject. "I mean, that's pretty much the long version, but I think that's what he's going for," Tony said, earning another glare from Fury, which phased him not at all.
"Then you know I'm not going to tell you shit." Fury sounded more exasperated than angry as he clasped his hands flat on the surface of the conference table. "We tried a few things. It worked. You're breathing. The details? Those aren't your business. You know exactly as much as you need to. Exactly."
Tony shrugged. "Barton killed a shitload of SHIELD agents before they took him in. And then there's Romanov. Banner broke the better part of New York City way before your army showed up. Your brother brought down half of Asgard on us. And you. Hell, they put up with me, and I've broken I don't know how many international laws. Pretty sure that Steve is... is the only one that hasn't..." He trailed off as his mind wandered to his lover, his jaw clenching as he realized that the whole conversation as likely pointless, anyway. Loki wasn't about to go turn himself over to the Avengers or SHIELD, and they both knew it. The god was going to toy with Coulson and Barton until they snapped or came close to it, let them go, and then make sure Tony was dead in fact rather than in theory. He took a deep breath. "Well, moot point, right? They won't trust you, and you won't trust them."
Tony's expression softened instantly, and he tilted his head at the pair thoughtfully. Using his heels to drag his rolling chair closer to the bunch, he got uncomfortably close to Simmons and stared hard at her. "There may be hope for you, after all," he decided. "When you rebuild the reactor, scale it up 22.2 percent. Use the old palladium core and increase the cycles by 12 percent. And make it a modular connection. In case I have to hook things up to the suit instead." The last thing he needed was another bout of palladium poisoning.
That was most definitely a personal question. In fact Steve was fairly certain that it was personal enough to step over some sort of line well past personal. He almost refused to answer but thought better of it. He'd more or less just asked Tony if the man had slept with someone other than Pepper recently, and he'd answered without hesitation. Would it really be fair not to be just as honest? It seemed like Tony was trying to help and understand. That was a good thing for them as teammates and maybe even friends.
Logan caught the back of Stark's shirt and hauled him to the floor, then proceeded to drag him to the foldout couch. Tony didn't protest much, crossing his arms over his chest. "Tell ya what. You manage to find you way over there on your own, and you can have all ya want."
Tony dug into the take without so much as a thanks, but at least had the decency to remark that it tasted good around his mouthful of food and coffee.
"Do it, Tony," he panted. Steve had often found his image laughable. There were worlds of difference between being a good person and being a blushing virgin. Granted, Tony could still make him blush, but Tony was damn near a professional at it. Which didn't mean Steve couldn't give as good as he got. "You can do whatever you want to me. I'm all yours, baby."
Instead of a stronghold of power, their temporary base felt like a cell. Every time he moved, Loki's broken ribs reminded him of the damage that the hammer could do. It was a power that was his to wield, not theirs. Breaking them wasn't enough, obviously. They would have to be disposed of more permanently. The Avengers were becoming a very frustrating liability.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
"Good. Barton and I will rendezvous with the Captain, Iron Man, and Banner. Keep us informed." Phil finally let his hand fall from Clint's shoulder. "We need to do what we can to help the rest of our team. If Loki wanted us here, he's probably got someone keeping them busy. His version of busy tends to be dangerous. Summers, let them know we'll intercept in five."
They were well settled at a table in the cafeteria, Sif utterly oblivious to the stares of those around them, before Steve joined them. Though he still looked bruised and tired, it was easy to see that Simmons' formula was working. He had lost some of the painful thinness and had gained at least a few inches of height over the course of the past day. "Sorry. Just wanted to get cleaned up. And have the bots help me out of that thing without an audience. It's not a graceful show just yet."
"Of course," Simmons answered with the same smile, at once grateful for and nervous about Bruce's presence. She hated putting him in deliberately stressful situations considering what that did to his equilibrium, but it could hardly be helped. Nervously she began taking readings while Clint stared at her like he expected her to snatch the hammer away. That was the very last thing in the world she wanted.
Ignoring the taunt, Victor tossed Coulson a set of handcuffs that looked distinctly alien. "Put 'em on." Once the man had complied, he gestured for Phil to come closer. Drawing out the device that Loki had supplied him with, he pulled the agent in enough to use it on the three of them, and they were gone.
Bruce followed him out. “Well, we got some of the tests in. Looks like we’ve got the worst of it out. He should be in the clear with the drugs tomorrow. At that point... at that point, some of the stuff that’s fuzzy right now may start coming clear. That’s good for us since it may mean information that could help us find Hydra and maybe bad for him since I doubt this is the first time they’ve asked him to do something pretty horrific.”
It occurred to Tony, however briefly, that he was pretty profoundly lucky to have people willing to pull together for him. For Steve, as well, no doubt. Maybe moreso because of him. But it didn't really matter in the moment. "I love 'im, y'know," he muttered thickly, then took a sharp breath in, trying to gather his nerves. He looked first at Nat and then to Coulson. "Thank you. Both of you." His eyes flicked to Clint, still keeping his distance, hands in his pockets. "Even you."
The thought of that was enough to make Steve feel sick all over again. "I should have gone back-"
Logan chuckled. "Well, at least Chuck just sent us out to fight ancient evil. He didn't insist on us bringing it home with us." He sighed quietly. "Then again, I guess a houseful o' mutants would be enough potential mass destruction."
Tony wasn't the sort to believe in fate, but he wasn't going to argue with Steve. His lover was right about one thing: everything was okay right then. More or less. He stole another kiss and smiled. "I'll be alright. And if you ever tell anyone that I got leaky eyes, no sex for a week." He only kept a straight face for about three seconds before smirking wickedly at Steve. "Okay, so we both know that's bull. But nobody'd believe you, anyway."
The sight of Steve's face when he'd found his mark inside the man had been incredible in and of itself, and Tony made it a point to strike the spot again. Grinning wickedly at Steve's response, he decided, "Might just never let you top again, though. Seeing you squirm like this is too addictive." He was joking, of course; Tony was pretty sure that if Steve never fucked him again, he might actually lose his mind.
Even though she knew his lack of scientific acumen had little to do with the decision, Simmons smiled as if it made perfect sense. "Of course. We shouldn't be long. I'm sure Director Fury just wants to be sure it isn't all pizza parties and endless pots of coffee."
Logan actually look halfway impressed. "And people think metal claws coming outta your hands is weird."
Realizing he was spacing out, Clint grabbed some sugar and cream and spruced up his coffee, stirring it with his finger because he couldn't be bothered to get up. He absently watched Phil work, still smirking faintly about the pajama pants, before finally deciding, "Maybe you should get the boxers."
The sound of the door interrupted any potential answers, and Pepper swept into the room with coffee and a bag that smelled of freshly-baked pastries. "JARVIS told me you boys had a sleepover," she informed them with a smile. "I thought you might need a little pick-me-up if you had a long night." She smiled at both men, pressing a kiss to Tony's cheek and greeting, "Good morning, Steve," before setting the items down on the table in front of them. "I'd stay and keep you company, but I'm afraid that somebody has to actually show up to Stark Industries meetings."
"Right." Coulson gave a nod of acknowledgement to Logan and Scott before falling into step beside Clint. "Is she really okay?" He knew Clint had other things on his mind, but first and foremost was Natasha's health and safety. Before the archer had a chance to answer, Coulson's phone buzzed. He lifted it to his ear and wasn't surprised to hear Fury's terse voice on the other end of the line. "Of course, sir. Yes. He's with me. Of course." Coulson winced as he put the phone away. "Fury wants to see us."
Logan hadn't quite meant his comment that way, but he realized a moment later it had been pretty revealing nonetheless. He wanted to kick himself. Instead, he met Scott's eyes, looking half amused and slightly nervous. "Yeah, since I got here. But before you did," he was quick to clarify. "I was curious. About a few things." Not remembering whether he'd been with a guy before had been first and foremost among his list of curiosities. Going to bed with Captain America had been a plus, too.
"He's... we think... We believe that the weapon interacted strangely with the serum... Obviously, under normal circumstances, the most we do for him is stitch something up so that it heals properly, reset a bone or two. Captain Rogers tends not to need our services." Going over known facts seemed to make the man more confident as he proceeded. "He's losing ground, but not in the way we anticipated. We think that the serum has been neutralized, at least to some degree. Temporarily, we hope."
Clint turned a little, letting one leg drape across Phil's thighs as he fought the urge to fully crawl into the other man's lap. He broke the kiss to let his lips blaze a slow trail down Phil's neck as he tried to calm himself a little, though it wasn't working as well as he'd hoped. "Phil," he rasped, "I am not the only terrible influence leaned up against this tree."
"I believe it's actually Doctor McCoy, isn't it?" Bruce extended a hand as well, then bumped shoulders with Clint and grinned a little. "I figured after working with me, he'd seem pretty cuddly."
Steve's eyes widened, but he had enough sense to process the words for a few moments before he finally ventured, "Oh. That's... new." He fell silent, working the idea over. It made sense for Tony, really, but he had a difficult time picturing Pepper agreeing to that. Then again, maybe it was the only way to make things work at all with Tony. The idea made him sad for reasons he didn't really want to delve into. "I don't think that... um, that's what I'm looking for. Not that it's bad, I mean, if it works for you," Steve added hurriedly, ever conscious of being polite to his host. "I just want somebody who cares about me. Just me. That's really the only way I know how to think about it." He couldn't help but wonder, and soon the question was spilling from his lips, "Does it happen often? Finding someone... uh... interesting?"
“If it helped… if it made it hurt less… if thinking it was me made it easier for you, then I’m glad, but I need you to know that… that no matter how much I want you, I would never hurt you.” Steve’s stomach twisted into a knot, but he didn’t let himself back down. Instead he brushed a chaste kiss to Tony’s lips and tried not to look as utterly terrified as he felt. Tony was skittish, and if the kiss was the wrong thing to do, Steve knew he might have months of a withdrawn billionaire to look forward to. The thought of hurting Tony by trying to help him weighed heavily on Steve’s mind as he waited, barely breathing, to make sure Tony was okay with what he’d done.
Instinct overrode reserve and Coulson reached for Clint's hand and drew it away. He held on just a second longer than was appropriate before dropping it again. "Don't. You know we'll have guards present. You won't be one of them."
Quill nodded, “Oh yeah, I feel better. I fucking hate Kukats, geez.” He rolled his shoulder, stretching and realizing he was still in disgusting, torn clothes. He saw Nebula was resting in a chair in the back, a blanket over her lap. “I’m gonna go shower, hey if you make us some soup we can watch
“Rochester’s April Inclusive Mixer Bash occurring this April 1
Captain Rogers had this funny smile on his face that honestly confused Tony but made him feel happy. He wished he could see the inside of that guy’s mind sometimes. “You taught him well.”
“Just one. He’s a little turd. But I’m proud of him.” Tony drank his wine as their appetizer arrived. It was a neat sort of light pastry with crab, avocado, and a myriad of tasty fresh herbs. “You are so good at this, Steve! What about you, any kids?”
“It’s…very impressive. What is it?”
“Stop being so god damn cute before I show you a piece of my—ahh oh…” Steve thrusted again inside him, the look on his face telling Tony he knew
“That’s valid,” Quill said, scratching his own hair and leaning against the wall with his arms crossed. “I know, listen, I gonna tell you eventually. You’re my little bro!”
“Don’t make a habit of it or I’ll sell your car,” Stark said as they both headed down the stairs together.
“Hm…I like your honesty, it’s kinky.”
“Just Nat. She’s letting me know the status of a few things on Earth. She says New Asgard is doing fine.”
Cap looked at him and stood. “Well come on then.” His voice was a suggestive, deep purr.
Steve nodded chuckling, “Something like that. Do you have any kids?”
Tony pursed his lips looking mildly constipated. “Uh, huh. Well. Okay, tell him no one’s home.”
“Been real busy, Cap. Had things going on. But, it turns out, resentment is corrosive, and I hate it.”
Each noise and movement went straight to Tony’s cock and prostate, and honestly he didn’t care to touch himself right now. This was all he wanted. He clenched his insides in a way he knew Cap would like, and that was a mistake because Cap gasped a high pitched noise that would haunt Tony’s wet dreams for weeks. He grabbed that handsome face and kissed him sloppily, Cap’s pace getting harder and quicker until the sound of their bodies slapping together grew loud and salacious.
“I am literally starving to death here—trust me, I know what it feels like—and so’s the kid.” Tony said as he was already walking straight past Steve and out of the door.
She pet his hair, looking up at him and smiling carefully, “I know.” She guided his face to hers and kissed his lips once, “I love you, too.”
“You know to be almost a hundred, you’re pretty cute,” Stark said with a chuckle, surging forward and hugging Steve. At least, it looked like a hug until Tony grabbed him by the waist and started flying upward. As Stark’s feet left the ground he felt Cap hold onto him tightly. He was actually disappointed. The first time he did this Steve shrieked. Now he didn’t even look surprised. He sort of had that expression husbands got when their wives wouldn’t get out of department stores. “What, no shout this time?”
“It’s fine, I like it,” Tony said, taking a deep breathe and looking down at Steve’s length still in his hand. “You taste good Rogers. All of you.” He was so hard he thought he might actually die.
Something was very wrong, and Peter only had about a full two seconds to react. He clanged his wrists together, then reached out and grabbed Happy by the arm while his Peter-tingle tingled in all the wrong ways. His eyes widened and he grabbed Happy, dragging him toward the front of the plane as the whirring in his ears got louder and louder until the world was suddenly going too fast and large explosion knocked them both backward.
“Nah. Tony hasn’t made me a new suit in years. Why, you know something I don’t?”
Even as Tony took a step back to eventually turn and walk away, he got the distinct impression that Steve didn’t want him to leave. Normally he’d be all over his partner, he was 100% the bang-on-first-date kind of guy but this…it was Steve. Steve was so different, he didn’t think it was right some how.
“Let’s just say I like your mustache the way it is. Even if it’s kind of weird.”
Plus, it was hard to be sad when there were tests and studying to be done all the time, it really kept his mind off of things. Well, it kind of did…It helped. What really helped was Mr. Stark. Ever since everyone in Peter’s life had been dusted, every single person he knew, Tony had taken it upon himself to take him in. So many children were parentless when the Snap happened that the process for people to become legal guardians was legally laxed, especially if the children were actually teenagers capable of making educated decisions. Stark had sat him down and adopted him not long after he’d called Happy, completely inconsolable about a month after they’d gotten back to Earth. Since Nebula, Quill, and Tony kept giving their rations to the kid, he was in much better shape than they were when they were stuck in space. All four of them were in a sorry state by the time Captain Marvel showed up. Thank God Quill had a huge stock pile of space candy. They’d all formed a pretty spectacular bond by the end of the whole ordeal, especially since he’d found ways to make Nebula make this noise that sounded kind of a like a laugh.
Peter shouted, “No one’s home!”
He did. “Yeah! I’m already ready to go. See? I’m all dressed!”
“So, after you’re done, you walk your date to their car, porch, door, stoop whatever. That’s when you can definitely tell how it all went. It’s all in the goodbye, Cap.” Tony leaned against the wall, smirking up Steve.
“The proper kind. That’s what I fought for, what you fought for. The point was for you to always have a family in the end.”
“Friday’s telling me it must have been an inside job, so I’m having all of our planes inspected this week. I’m having someone collect that wreckage too. They’re on their way now. We’re going to find out exactly what happened so that I can find out exactly who the hell I need to fry,” Tony said calmly. His dad was still gripping his shoulder as they took off back toward New York.
As Happy waddled over to sit by Peter, Peter’s chest thudded with an absolute sense of sudden and impending alarm. A whirring noise started up somewhere. Happy was sitting, but the action looked like it was in slow motion, the clouds went by sluggishly and the sound of the jet engines faded into a dull hum.
“Good question,” Cap said, dodging Bucky’s curiosity and drinking some juice.
The two held each other as a second of tense, lusty silence passed.
Chuckling, Stark met Peter’s sheepish eyes in the rearview mirror. “No, we’re not there yet.” Peter noticed there was a glossy quality to Tony’s eyes, even though his mouth was smirking.
“You took him to a Steak ‘n Shake? Wow. Why don’t you get him a Happy Meal next?”
He made his way down to the first floor of the hotel and immediately regretted ever being born.
Tony put a hand to his forehead and cursed, muttering something about never leaving his workshop again. He’d already been forming contingency plans to remedy the uncertain future of his bag and the work it held until he noticed a man running through the water and diving in.
Steve turned to him and his expression was bright and surprised, “Tony, that was amazing. That was one of the greatest things I’ve ever seen.”
“We’re okay,” Peter repeated, holding the two men to himself as he treaded water in the middle of nowhere. The water wasn’t too cold even though it was February, so at least they wouldn’t freeze to death before anyone got there. Peter’s mind was a mess, but focused on the task at hand. Keep these two alive until help came. That’ all. It was going to be okay. He couldn’t look down, he couldn’t think about how deep the water was.
“No,” Steve said, getting back into bed and just looking down at Tony. Tony looked up at him with a little suspicious eye-narrow. What did he want with a look like that? He didn’t have to wait long to find out as Steve leaned down and kissed him, straddling his hips and just sitting on his naked thighs, tongue softly parting Tony’s lips. Tony kissed him back, a hand coming to play with Steve’s hair. He could get used to this. He really loved this. Blowing Steve Rogers’ mind was his new favorite pastime. Maybe this time they’d both been too eager, but it had still been great.
“Ohhhh, my God, I’m so proud of you! I was wondering when we’d have our first movie-quality awkward moment. I could cry.”
“What are you waiting for? Get your star-spangled ass in, you’re coming to dinner if you want to spend time with me so bad. Nothing is keeping the kid and I from our reservation. Not even this conversation—which, by the way—I really didn’t want to have today.”
“That sounds like a plan,” Happy said, sounding genuinely relieved to watch something more palatable.
“What?”
The closer he got, the more he lost focus on the hot breath sending shivers down his neck and the other man’s arm clenching his torso around the ribs. Somewhere he vacantly registered Steve felt like he was already getting hard again—how the fuck—and that he was so close. “I’m almost there,” he breathed hastily, gasping at Cap’s steady hand. In no time he was moaning and drawing his knees up, clenching his toes, and coming all over Steve’s hand.
“I’m sure you will, take a chill pill and watch a movie or something. You’ve been going nonstop for three weeks straight. Don’t you need to sleep?”
“Ugh.”
“Don’t we all.”
Steve held Tony close, their kissing sounding loud in the large, quiet room. Tony parted their lips to kiss Steve’s jaw, and then his neck, wanting to put his nose right where the man’s smell would be strongest. Steve let him, giving him access to his neck and then letting his hands slip down to cup Stark’s bottom.
His head whipped in the direction of the noise and he saw a man leaning over the pier and staring at some floating object in the water. Steve stared at it for a second and looked up to the angry man cursing at the water like it would somehow help the situation. He noticed how he was wearing a red speedo of all things and had a thick, dark head of hair. His eyes were hidden by a flamboyant pair of purple sunglasses and he had the most interesting facial hair. Blue eyes passed over to the other beachgoers, who hadn't even seemed to notice the situation.
“Yep. Sure is,” Tony slurred, already working on another bottle.
“Yep. Sad. Say, Cap, why don’t you let me show you what a real date is like? I’m the king of them.”
Lips kissed and sucked at Tony’s jaw as hands undid his pants. Steve’s fingers wrapped around his length and slowly began to stroke him, his tip glistening from pre-cum ages ago. Tony moaned as his balls were squeezed and his stomach was lightly stroked. It felt so good he already had his lips pressed into a fine line, head leaned back over Steve’s shoulder. Steve took the opportunity to kiss Tony’s cheek and that soft warm area where his jaw met his neck. His hands began to move on his length quicker, and he could feel Steve’s breath pick up with his own. “Ohhh, Rogers, oh,” Tony hummed, lightly moving his hips into Steve’s awaiting hands. The blond pumped him all the agonizing way from balls to head and with such a firm grip it was electric. He squeezed Tony’s legs, kissed his neck and then hastened his pace. Tony shifted and started moaning quietly in time with the other man’s movements, it was just so good he could barely stand it.
Somehow he managed to make it back to the hotel room.
“He’s at school. Getting an education. He’s great at it.”
“Oh my god! Please, this is just an art project! What did you want?” He popped out of the chair and snatched up the pencil after he’d minimized his tab. He held up the drawing to Tony as proof he wasn’t being a pervert. “See?!”
“I hope you have a good time, pal. No matter what Tony’s branding it as. Don’t have to love him to date him. Even if it’s make-believe.”
“Pfft, hell yes,” Tony snorted, kissing him again and then going lower. He kissed his stubbly chin, his collarbone, then his clothed stomach. When he got to Steve’s belt he began to undo it, hands slipping the leather strap from its buckle. Caps eyes were watching him with laser focus, and there was a small upturn of one side of his lips that made him look visibly eager—although his cheeks and ears were all kinds of red. Tony smirked, undoing Steve’s button and just reaching into his underwear, pulling Steve’s already hard member from the warmth. He’d never met a man that got turned on so fast, it was as sexy as it was kind of dorky.
“You sure?”
When the pair got in the hallway together the air was heavy and completely tense. Tony held up his hands, “My bad. Cock blocked you Cap, whoopsie. I guess it’s payback,” Iron Man said easily, even though he wanted to ask a million questions.
As Cap’s thrusts became more sloppy and frantic, Tony really ground his hips against him, biting his lip and wondering if he’d need to pump himself at all at this rate. His mind was beginning to go blank and all he could feel and hear was Steve, as his body demanded more. He felt his hips lurch and twitch as his balls drew in tighter, oh fuck yes, he was going to come just like this.
In seconds, the man—with golden hair he noted—popped out of the water and jogged to the beach. Just as the stranger’s feet slapped the wood of the boardwalk, a seagull cawed somewhere nearby.
“I’ll stay.” Steve got comfy, throwing his arm over Tony’s chest and cuddling up beside him, almost like women used to lay on him. He was just too darn precious to move or fight him on it. So he went back to sleep hoping his kid wasn’t scarred too bad from this.
He let himself smile, eyes crinkling deeply as he watched the way Steve easily put his hand on Peter’s shoulder, leading him to the house and instantly treating him like he’d been a part of the family since 2012.
“Yeah?”
Nat nodded and soon the pair found themselves in a quinjet that they’d had on stealth-mode in the ruins of a nearby destroyed building. It was nighttime so it was almost overkill that the jet was invisible.This particular African town had been doing well until the Snap, which had caused massive chaos that never got fixed.
For lunch Tony had ordered them all Italian food. By dinner, they had burgers. Happy stopped in to greet them each time he carted in their next meal. They didn’t see much of Tony, but that was alright. Bucky was pretty sure he was avoiding them.
As they all sat there and ate a five-star canned spaghetti sauce dinner, things felt right. He and Steve were alright, even after all that had happened. Somehow, they were still brothers. If someone would have asked him which of them would have figuratively settled down first, Bucky would have definitely not chosen himself. Yet here he was, left knee bumping Natasha’s to a cute secret rhythm, giving her looks whenever she met his eye. She needed Bucky, and he didn’t realize how badly he’d needed her. Her emotions were coiled up tightly within her, especially with all that stuff going on with Clint. Bucky was just thankful she’d found purpose doing the one job that was harder than all of the rest—being the head of the Avengers.
Yeah, it was time to see Tony. He needed it.
“Definitely.”
Steve quickly said, “I’ve never done this.”
Water under the bridge.
“Hmm, maybe don’t get the bourguignon then. Red wine goes better with beef, usually. Okay! Second lesson don’t talk about exes, breakups or religion. No politics either. So, how was your day Steve?” Tony leaned back, already comfortable in one of his favorite places. He already knew what food he wanted. Steve was staring at the menu like it was a book to study. The menu had no prices on it.
Tony met Cap’s eyes, breathing the thick air between them, his own heart racing as his body struggled to deal with how sensitive and hard his own cock was—which was pressed right up against Steve’s. Cap looked at him, at his face, at his lips, and then down between their bodies, licking his lips once and speaking.
“I’m…bisexual.” Steve said it more to himself than anyone else.
Cap cursed under his breath at seeing Tony just waiting for him like that, so he grabbed the bottle of lube and immediately squirted some on his fingers. He walked up behind Tony, using a slick index to rub and tease with the rim of his ass.
The two Avengers (plus an Avenger junior) stood in the living room of the nice cabin, just staring at each other. After a long hard staring contest, Iron Man finally decided to talk.
“I’ve got a suit.”
“Wow, what kind of things?” Steve had this funny little smirk that Tony thought looked almost flirty-sarcastic.
Steve shrugged; he really didn’t know. It had been years since he had gotten the serum, and other than his hair getting darker near the base of his skull and temples, and some wrinkles becoming more visible, he didn’t
“I am too. I always am,” Steve took a heavy, comforting drink of his coffee. After putting the cup on a nearby table, he leaned a forearm on the glass, looking down at his feet. He shut his eyes. Ever since Tony sent Peter away to university, everyone had been telling him Tony was getting more neurotic and withdrawn. Steve hoped to God he wasn’t drinking. Every time Steve came around Tony pushed him away. Tony was still sore over the Battle in Berlin and every other wrong thing that had happened between them. Would going to check on him make it worse? Would he even answer the door when Friday told him who was there?
Steve looked up at him and then smirked, slapping Bucky on the leg back. “How are you and Nat?”
Steve nodded, “I know. I just…I want to do this right. For you.”
“Depends. This one can change color. I think I’ll have it in my classic Mark 3 colors since that one was my favorite. This one is something else though Steve.”
Steve rose a brow, turning his head away. “Did you come up with that yourself?”
“So…gonna tell me about those things you’ve been up to Tony? I’d love to hear some of them.”
He liked feeling Caps’ eyes on him as he cooked. Recently, he could have sworn the air was thicker between them whenever they were in the same room. It didn’t help that he was now not-so-discreetly flirting with Cap on a regular basis. He even did so in public. It really did seem like Cap was flirting with him too, but he was pretty sure that Cap couldn’t tell the difference either way. Or maybe he could if Rochester was anything to go by. God damn, he wished he could forget that whole night.
“That’s good enough.” He kissed Steve quickly, rolling over onto his back and spreading his knees to make room. “C’mere.” Steve rolled over, knocking some hair loose so it laid on his forehead. Tony looked up at him and marveled at how pretty he was from this angle too. There weren’t many people he trusted left in this world, and he knew the same could be said for Steve, so he was freaking happy that he’d be the one taking his virginity and not some rando. He hoped this was the first night of many. As he watched Steve squirt lube onto his hand and rub himself with it, he realized this was a whole new and exciting part of Steve he’d definitely never known. After all this, he couldn’t wait to learn more about him.
Cap nearly coughed on a cracker in something that was half a laugh and half a choke. Tony grinned, he loved messing with him. “What?”
Bucky smirked, “Yeah? Where would I wear it?”
. He squinted as she continued hugging his man-friend (that's what they called each other).
It was a moment of silence before his ears caught up to the massive roar of applause directed at him. He grinned and smiled, opening his arms and waving to everyone. “Thank you!” The microphone on his lapel recorded his words, but the crowd was so loud he was sure no one heard it. He waved, took questions for about an hour, and then he was walking back to his plane. Well, his dad’s plane.
Tony could smell Steve when he was this close, even in a room filled with so many other people. He smelled strong, manly, and clean. He was warm. He was everything Tony thought he’d be if he ever got to get this close to him. The slow dancing pace was making him feel shy. He chanced a glance at Cap, only to immediately turn his head upon seeing that Cap had been watching him. He swallowed thickly and abruptly forgot what sort of playboy philanthropist sort of thing he was going to say.
Steve’s eyes widened only slightly, yet again immensely surprised by everything coming out of his mouth. He looked at Tony’s face and then turned to look at Peter in the backseat, who was smiling broadly.
They had just tried to make a deal that went south real quick—now they knew never to trust punks from Kukat. Quill felt a hot burning pain deep in his left ass-cheek. It shot waves of pain down his leg and up that side of his body. “Shit!” Quill forced himself to stand up, turning around and firing his blasters at the two-legged five-eyed slimy Kukat pricks. He took cover behind one of the smooth white trees, panting raggedly and squinting, “Thor!?”
Quill was panting raggedly. He pushed the button on his helmet, and as it retracted, it revealed his wide eyes and sweaty temples. “Thor! Give me a tab! I got shot in the fucking ass!”
Steve looked up, no anger in his eyes. “I really appreciate your concern Tony, but I’m alright. What about you?”
“A Sun Circus?”
Well, they weren’t doing much “helping” other than helping him store fat. Thor sometimes helped them on their new galactic missions, quests, and looting opportunities, but mostly he was just a really heavy freeloader. He wasn’t a bad guy though, and she still couldn’t bring herself to hate him.
Tony led Steve over to the bed, letting him lie back on it. Once Steve was nice and comfy with his head on a pillow, Tony got on top of him and kissed him. “I like whatever’s happening here,” Tony said, stroking Steve’s incoming beard and mustache combo. It was hot, and he’d heard from everyone else just how full and sexy that beard could get—he was kind of mad he never got to see it himself.
Tony blinked, putting a hand on his hip and really looking at this stranger. For one, he noticed the guy was more ripped than a brick-shit house, and damn his eyes were blue. He had a sweet, almost girl like prettiness about his face—he’s blaming those princess eyelashes—and an amazing set of pecks. In fact, he didn’t think he’d ever seen a pair of pecks that large in his life. God damn. “Tony.” Holding out his hand, Tony smirked, wanting to see how strong pretty boy’s grip was. He tried to keep eye contact but failed miserably when he noticed a drop of water slide from the crook of blondie's collar bone over the pinkest part of his nipple.
Steve pulled his pants back up, zipped them, and then just took his shirt off. Steve’s body had always been gorgeous and profoundly unattainable.
what he’s been missing. He’d make fun of him relentlessly later. He wasn’t in the mood to go all slow and instructive, he wanted it now.
“Hey, so you dating anyone yet?”
“Alright, you win this one Rogers. So, how’d the mission go? I’m not really privy to what’s been happening,” Tony asked, cutting out little triangles with the side of his fork.
The two laughed for a second more as Rhodey said, “Hah hah, yeah, whatever, goodbye. Hey, better to be anonymous than a 100-year-old virgin, right?”
“Yeah.” Tony mumbled absently, watching as Steve turned. Damn. His ass was even more perfect than his abs. Maybe he could convince pretty boy to stick around. “Hey! Wait a sec! Where you going?” he called, startling some seagulls perched on the handrails.
“Sounds great,” he said, wanting those lips back on his so bad he felt like dying. He felt like he was suffocating too. This changed everything. Had Steve always liked him? Did it matter?
Thor was leaning against one of the walls holding a soda, and Quill was gripping his hoodie front, just kissing him. Peter was so quiet that by the time they noticed him it was too late.
Licking his lips in absolute anticipation for that sweet, creamy, coffee he walked toward the thing like he was on a mission to murder it (force of habit). He grabbed the handle and began tamping espresso in the little cup when he finally registered the strong smell of something delicious. On the counter were a few huge closed trays of something and when he took a peak, it seemed to be filled with meat on skewers, dumplings, and other things. Who ordered breakfast?
He met Cap’s eyes, and they ate their chili in silence for a few minutes.
“Oh yeah. Hugely inconvenient,” Tony said exasperatedly, making a flippant hand gesture. “You ready to go or what?”
The kid had spaced out thinking about Ned and by the time he snapped out of it he looked a little sheepish. “Sorry! Distracted!”
Steve’s eyebrows furrowed and he shook his head. “No. Why?” Then a second later. “What?”
Once he found a rhythm, he got comfortable, rubbing Steve’s thighs. The other man arched, gasping as his length disappeared into Tony’s lips with each bob of his head. It was clearly driving the blond wild, and feeling him respond like this was making him groan. Steve’s hips were moving gently against Tony’s face, twitching every now and then from little jolts of pleasure. Tony gripped Steve’s thighs and hastened his pace. He sucked hard, bobbing his head relentlessly. He was nearly nose to pubic bone each time his head came down. He was breathing hard just from the sheer thrill of it and was making clipped moans in his throat. Steve was gripping the blanket and moaning too, not seeming to know what to do with his hands. Tony couldn’t get enough of him. He wished he could deepthroat like a pornstar, but he just couldn’t. That was fine, he was able to swallow Steve down far enough anyway to please them both.
“Yeah, yeah shut up!” Quill shouted, heart racing and ass burning. He turned and summoned what strength he had left to make his way back to the ship. He practically belly flopped into the ship because he tripped, shouting as whatever the hell happened to his shoulder shot his body up with more pain. Thor threw his axe out one more time, decapitating a few aliens—and poor trees—and the moment he caught it Nebula closed the door and drove them toward space.
"Well too bad. Cancel it. Why the hell'd you even let me make an appointment during my vacation anyway?"
“Go?” Steve looked around for the jet or other transportation. Fuck it was precious.
“Karen, are we being attacked?! I can’t see anybody!” Peter shouted, flying as far away from the plane as he could get. They were still high up in the sky, and pieces of debris flickered in the sunshine like little pieces of mirror around them. “Karen!?”
He casually fell off the side of the skyscraper, letting gravity take him down until his repulsors kicked in and sped him toward Steve Rogers. He flew close and landed in front of him with a satisfying and metallic clang. Steve turned to him thankful, looking Stark up and down for battle damage or injuries. As Tony’s faceplate flipped up, he gave the big guy a smirk.
His hands roamed her body, and soon he was biting her neck. She leaned back, letting him, and moaned softly as he sucked on that one special place on her neck that drove her nuts. His hand roamed down her back and then he slapped her ass, squeezing it through the tactical material. She made a pleased sound and then grabbed a handful of his dick through his pants. She laughed mischievously, seeming pleased with herself at the noise he made. He quickly began to undo his gear belt and pants. She helped him, and soon his pants and underwear were dropped, and he was sitting heavily on a bench. She immediately took off her own pants and underwear, climbing on his lap and kissing him. He wrapped his arms around her waist, rubbing her ass and legs. She wanted him now and he wanted her now, and in an instant their kiss went from sweet to teeth and tongue. He slipped a hand between her legs, just rubbing her warmth as she moved against him. She reached between them and grabbed his member, angling it for herself and sitting down on it slowly. He watched as she tilted her head back and moaned, eyes shut with bliss at the feeling. He made a gravelled-hum and squeezed her ass hard when she sat all the way down on top of him, skin to skin. She slowly began rocking back and forth as he held her, and he just watched, hands roaming her body.
“Really, now.”
“That’s what I thought,” Steve said, responding to the look on his face.
Steve seemed to feel the same way because those arms that were wrapped around his hips descended and the blond jerked Stark’s jeans and underwear down until they fell to the floor. Tony’s member sprang free, exposed to the cold air. Giving Steve one last hard and sloppy kiss, Tony turned around and leaned his chest on the bar, biting his lip and grinning.
“Hmph.”
Thor made a frowny kind of smile that was more of a look of amusement than anything else, “And all I know, is that your sorry ass is the only reason I get out of bed in the morning.” Even though it was slurry, accented, and drunken-sounding, the heaviness of Thor’s voice gave Quill pause.
Steve smiled and nodded approvingly, “You’re good at it.”
“So, you two are dating?”
“You do?” Cap smirked, holding Tony’s jaw in his hands and just looking up at him. Tony loved it when he got that face, even though he still wasn’t sure what it meant.
“Tony,” Cap smirked.
Bucky rose an eyebrow, “Let me guess…you made grilled cheeses? Boxed mac ‘n cheese? Something pre-made with cheese?”
“Did you like it?”
He stood and started to run to the North side of the building, that’s where Natasha was. “Nat?” he called over the comm, “Was that you?”
“Thor…kick me those cookies woudja?”
He reached out and gripped Peter’s shoulder, sitting quietly at the table. He, Steve, Nat, and Rhodey were all sitting around too, eating Peter’s favorite foods—cherry pie and chicken and dumplings. They were the only two things Aunt May used to cook that were delicious in every way. And even though she was gone, Cap made a pretty good cherry pie too. Rhodey cooked the chicken and dumplings. It was a strange dinner, but it made them all feel better. The conversation was light between them all, and they hadn’t been talking about the incident. After all, it was done and over, and they were looking into it.
Bucky nodded, shaking his head and brushing some powder out of Nat’s hair. “Sounds good.” She was alright, and that was all that mattered. Even though they both had thin bullet-proof vests on and she was a badass, it did little to ease his worrying mind. “Let’s get the hell out of here, this place stinks. I need to fix your arm.”
Each time they delivered him a shipment of metals, he gave them a massive amount of food, supplies, and things to take with them to sell in galactic markets. Turned out a lot of Earth metals go for quite a bit up there.
