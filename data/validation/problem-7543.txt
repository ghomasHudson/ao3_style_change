“Uh oh,” Toni says, and can’t stop grinning. “I’m in for it now. Ow! Hey!” She rubs the stinging spot on her collarbone where Helen just ripped one of the electrode pads off her skin. “Sadist,” she mutters with a glare.
They stare at each other for a long moment, her eyes wide, his inscrutable. Toni's breath hitches in her chest. Her heart pounds with a solid, painless thump, and warmth spreads up her neck. The itching vanishes as if it never was.
And Toni had given it without hesitation. She, who cherishes Clint above all other relationships, had been
whispers the ghost of Sarah Rogers,
JARVIS quietly informs Toni that Project Warbird has finished the fabrication, assembly and paint cycles in four hours, six minutes. Toni tells him to park the armor right next to Rhodey’s, and then finds a moment to sneak off and tape a note on the bright yellow stripe-and-starburst bifurcating the red shoulders and head from the blue torso and legs.
The noise cuts dead in the middle of Hetfield’s growling lyrics. “Channel is open, ma’am,” JARVIS says promptly.
Frigga made no noise as she crept into the room for perhaps the eighth time since Skuld had awoken them with her screams some hours ago. She was sleeping now, finally, curled between her brothers and clinging to each of them as if they would vanish should she let go. She had refused to return to her own rooms, refused to be anywhere but where she currently rested, one hand laced with Loki’s, and one hand laced with Thor’s.
Toni's never looked backward and missed it. She might think fondly about something she experienced, and he knows better than anyone that she has regrets, or things she wishes she had done differently, but Toni is firmly eyes-forward, focused on what is to come. The future is what beckons her, not the past. Not once in his earshot has she ever said,
“Focus people!” Carol snaps. “Now is not the time for this. Get your heads in the game, or turn around and go home before you get someone injured or killed.”
She tilts her head and considers. Behind her, the door hisses shut and clicks secure. “May as well,” she says, and then has to throw herself forward, burning a second of jets to launch faster, as a black-clad goon steps out from around the corner and opens fire with an assault rifle. She sets her feet and skids to a stop, and snaps off a repulsor blast.
Jesus Christ,
He's kind of hoping they don't, because sooner or later, someone's going to start questioning his trustworthiness and are they
Hogan takes the paper and squints at the printing, lifting his sunglasses to do so. Steve flushes a little, because his mother and the nuns at the orphanage had despaired, and rightly so, of curing his chicken scratch penmanship. “Oh! Yeah, I know where that is, Captain.” He hands the slip back and puts the car in reverse, backing out of his parking spot. “Toni's loves their stuff. Mr. Barton used to commission pieces all the—” Hogan's mouth snaps shut so fast, Steve hears his teeth click. “Shit, sorry, Captain. I didn't mean to say that.”
“Gross motor function tests are green, JARVIS,” she says with a grin. “Bright, neon, shiny green.”
Not for the first time, he’s afraid there’s something wrong with the serum, because he doesn’t
Carter looks shocked, uncertain, then indignant. “If this is how you treat your working relationship with SHIELD, Stark,” she says coldly, “then perhaps we should revisit the nature of the relationship.”
There are a great many things Phil can say to that. Most of them involve epithets and questions that involve the phrase
And there’s only a single, purple arrowhead intermingled with Toni’s blue circle, and a smooth expanse of skin where his and Steve’s soulmarks should be.
But that’s really his problem right now, isn’t it? He can’t believe
“Fury didn’t send me,” Coulson says. “I volunteered to come. Yes, there is a message he would like me to give you, but mostly, I thought you could use a friend.”
That really shouldn’t turn her on at all, should it? Recent bouts of insanity aside, she’s never been one for chains of command and adherence to rules. It should frighten her a little that her only response is fiercely happy and challenging, “I was
“Soulmate, huh? Congratulations, Rhodey. Carol, my condolences.” She dusts off her most pleasant smile, and holds out a hand. “Toni Stark. And you are..?”
early as 7, mind, but still pretty young. We knew we were gonna share a soulmate. Didn’t have a fuckin’ clue why we were
He doesn’t sleep at first, paces restlessly around his room until he could walk through with his eyes closed uninjured, and lays on his narrow, firm cot to stare hollow-eyed and blank at the ceiling when daylight breaks wan and pale against the walls. The serum keeps him going on bare minimum, does what it was designed to do, but it’s not foolproof and it’s not without limit.
His head is pounding, and his vision is going blurry again. “But…” He sounds lost and weak and confused, grits his teeth, forces himself to focus. “I remember it all. I am Captain America.”
Getting the stink-eye from Fury isn't a novel experience. He's the handler for both Hawkeye and Black Widow. The Fury glare is a regular feature of his mission reports. This one slides right off Phil's back, just like all the others do. “I don't have time to mollycoddle a spoiled rich kid, Coulson, no matter how smart she is or how many gizmos she sells us. The only thing I need from Stark is our business relationship, and the Iron Maiden suit, if we can pry it out of her hands. She doesn't listen, she talks too much, and she gets a bug up her ass about almost anything that shouldn't damn well concern her.” He leans forward again, eye impatient, exasperated, unimpressed. “Do you understand what I'm saying, Agent Coulson?”
She’s only on her second cup of coffee, sitting on Clint’s lap on a chair in the kitchen, when he saunters into the manor, eyes raking greedily over the fixtures and furnishings. He’s mid-conversation with a cell phone to his ear, and it sounds to Toni like he’s talking to an interior decorator. “ - the kitchen is an utter nightmare,” he says, and oh god, that nasally whine of his voice… Toni only realizes she’s squeezing her coffee cup so tightly the ceramic creaks Clint soothingly rubs his palms over her biceps.
And certainly never because it was
He doesn’t notice until later that she never looks at Steve directly, always in her peripheral, He doesn’t notice until much later that she doesn’t come to bed at all, just works quietly on the couch with her StarkPad before slipping out in the middle of the night.
Brave words, but she knows how much bullshit they are when he just grins, sudden and gleeful, and comes at her with a staggering speed.
“Sorry,” Helen says, not sounding sorry in the slightest, and reaches for the next one, relentless around Toni trying to dodge away. “Some of these are on pretty well. Hold still, this might hurt.”
“No, for fuck’s sake,” Clint says, exasperated. “Why would I be jealous of her soulmate? Jesus Christ, Natasha, you know better than
“You just seem a little… happy for someone who just watched his girlfriend get smacked in the face. I would have thought you’d be pretty pissed.”
“Yes,” Tony says, and swallows hard, raises his eyes to meet Steve’s. “So very fucking tired of it.” Swallows again. Dares to caress over Steve’s cheek, feels a visceral thrill when Steve sighs contentedly, shuts his eyes, and leans into Tony’s touch. “Is this what we’re going to do about it, Steve?”
Steve makes another noise, deep in his throat, and Tony is suddenly interested in figuring out how to make him sound like that again.
His smirk only barely starts forming before she’s wagging her finger in chastisement at him. “What? I didn’t even say anything.”
He’s washing the dishes by hand when JARVIS chimes softly. “Captain, you should be informed that ma’am has decided to return to the mansion.”
He doesn’t understand how they turned another woman into Peggy, let alone hidden his own goddamned soulmarks from him and put a false one on him. Bucky’d shown him the technology, some fine mesh panel that can be programmed to make a person look however they want. It’s science-fiction to him, though. It’s something that HG Wells or Jules Verne write about in their novels and serials. He’s seen it work, both in the security footage taken from Hydra, and on Bucky’s own body, changing his artificial arm back and forth between looking metal and looking like flesh. He just can’t really believe it’s real.
Natasha leans forward, until their foreheads are almost touching. “Your heart stopped beating,” she says, calm and clear and lethal. “Your arc reactor was dark for two minutes.
Green Day, “Boulevard of Broken Dreams”
Learns, unsurprisingly, that he’s pretty much well head-over-fucking-heels in love with her. Thinks she loves him too. Hopes she does.
------
“She’s my soulmate too,” Steve says automatically, then hears what just came out of his mouth and stops dead, staring blankly at the empty bottle in his hand. Jesus Christ, she’s his soulmate, she’s injured and about to undergo a medical procedure. So what’s he doing down here, feeling sorry for himself?
“Yeah.” She squints up at him. “How’d you know that?”
When he stands, she flinches involuntarily, and he reels back like she slapped him. For a long moment, punctuated by deadly, uncomfortable silence as conversations die away, Toni and Steve just stare at each other, wide eyed and holding their breath.
Toni doesn’t pause this time, just keeps her hands dancing through the air. “Fury’s smart,” she says. “Agent Agent’s the one I’m least likely to murder, right behind Tash and Clint. Yeah, go ahead. Let him in. And send my apologies for the state of the house. The maids apparently don’t get paid enough to scrape brain matter off the fucking wall. Progress check?”
Toni is practically asleep on her feet after Bucky finds their clothes. Her eyes aren’t even open as she shoves her arms carelessly into her shirt and tugs her jeans back over her hips, leaving them unbuttoned. She staggers towards a couch in the corner, mumbling about bed now, but Bucky’s sat on that thing, been jabbed in the kidneys and the ass by broken springs.
, she told herself, but shivered at the very real chill creeping up her legs, closing in on her shoulders, undeterred by the delicate material of her sleeping gown.
“There is one active cluster of comm signals that match the hostile frequency, ma’am, moving northeast out of the city, towards Connecticut.”
“Yeah, that’s a no.” Fury sighs and spreads his fingertips on the desktop, leans forward on them. “Stark’s a wild card, Phil. She doesn’t take orders and she doesn’t recognize authority. Since Iron Maiden debuted, she’s been involved with at least thirteen incidents that have directly impacted covert SHIELD operations. Involving her when the secrets are this big is just asking for trouble.”
“Happy to kick you off Bird Squad as quickly as I signed you on,” Clint says cheerfully. “What are you planning on doing while we’re doing all the hard work?”
She knows why Obadiah is insisting on her giving some sort of speech, though. It looks good for the paparazzi. There’ll be a way for him to spin it in order to generate positive PR for the company. She knows, as sure as she knows every line of her soulmarks, that Obie is going to want her to settle down, marry someone -- probably Clint who, despite all the tabloids’ wild guesses, is practically her husband after all this time together -- and start popping out babies to carry on the Stark dynasty.
“Kay. M'tired.” She doesn’t fight it this time, just sinks into the warm, numbing, drugged feeling, and lets the world slip away.
He’s never realized before how none of them share the same birth month. Right now, he’s pretty grateful for that. It makes this job easier and a lot more straightforward than he gleaned from what Toni said.
“Don’t you fucking dare, JARVIS!” She struggles upward, tries to wiggle off Bucky’s shoulder. Forgot that she’s dealing with a super-soldier, and outside the suit, he’s
“I do not know.” She sighed, smiled, linked their fingers together. “That part is unclear.”
There's no more reason to talk, and nothing pressing any of them have to say. So they sit, Toni tucked under Steve's left arm, Bucky under his right, and she's holding Bucky's hand in Steve's lap.
“No, ma’am. Were I to wager a guess, I would say he intends to surprise you.”
He loses a blade to a particularly well-placed snap-kick from the next group of enemies. More darts hit him. He shakes his head hard, trying to clear the sluggishness of his movements. He’s too slow to avoid the impact of brass knuckles to his face, feels his head crack back, feels something jab him in the spine and send electricity jolting all across his body.
So toss me a comment and let me know: more plot forwarding in the next chapter, or make room for the smut?
“My best estimate is at least seventeen Hydra agents remaining, as well as an additional seven scientists.” There’s another of those tiny pauses, and JARVIS continues, “Ma’am, your injuries are extensive. You must take care of yours—”
“All sorts of goodies and swag. You wouldn’t believe how comprehensive they are.” Toni flashes her a real smile. Gets one back in return.
Belatedly, he realizes what he said when her eyes shutter over and her expression goes speculative, and he snaps his mouth shut. Steve Rogers is a topic they have been successfully avoiding talking about since the first day he woke up and was himself again. He knows she has a white star opposite his red, but hasn’t seen it since Siberia because she keeps it hidden with makeup or tech or something. But he knows it’s there, thinks sometimes about if her mark, bright and clear, means Steve’s still alive, somehow, somewhere. And he catches her eyeing his other soulmark, white star nestled inside the red, wistful shimmer in her eye, knows she’s wants to touch it but won’t because it isn’t hers, knows she’s also wondering if there’s a chance.
“I try to be,” she says cheerfully, and makes a
Toni eases up with the boot repulsors as the squat, ugly, abandoned-looking outpost appears, reducing thrust until she’s directly in front of the rusty door, and hovers in midair for a moment. There are two guards stationed in sight. One patrols the top, the other stands beside the door. “Nah. Not really in the mood for AC/DC right now. I’m feeling…
The smile fades when the door closes behind them, and Toni stares at the door, hip cocked and hand on her chin. She watches through the glass as Rhodey and Carol make their way down the hall towards the elevator, noting how Rhodey’s hovering,  walking half a pace behind Carol, one hand palm forward behind her back, probably not touching, but ready to lend support at the slightest hint of trouble.
She stays still for a moment, because she’s never been the best at waking up and recognizing what’s going on. “You’re not Bucky,” she says.
He drives his fist into the bag, snarling with the sudden surge of rage that screams behind his eyes. The thick leather of the bag gives way with a loud, groaning rip, and sand patters fast and furious on the floor. He sighs, closes his eyes, leans his forehead against the cool surface of the bag. Pulls his hand out, sending more sand cascading everywhere. “
“You’ll be fine,” Bucky says, and his left hand reaches out to trace around the double star marked on Steve’s terribly thin chest. “We’ll both be fine. This is proof of that.” And he shifts his hand over so it’s almost, but not quite, touching Toni’s blue circle. “It’s still bright. Our third’s still in our future. As long as the marks are clear and clean, we’re okay. Who knows? Maybe I’ll find them over there and bring ‘em home. Wouldn’t that be somethin’?”
“Yes,” Rhodey drawls wryly. “Damn that ability to vote and go to college and work in traditionally male-dominated industries like…” He snaps his fingers, like he’s trying to jog his memory. “Tell me, what womanly, gentle fields are you studying again, Tones? Engineering? Physics? Computer science?”
“Guess so,” Toni says, grins madly. “God help the world.”
Toni shifts comfortably, feeling gloriously relaxed and … maybe not
For someone who only two nights ago hadn’t known their routines, their walkthroughs, Steve’s picked it up quick. Toni’s shoulders loosen at his words, and she rolls them comfortably, settling into an easier stance. “Yeah,” she says with a tiny grin. “How about you? You with me?”
“Hi James,” she replies, pulling rope after rope apart and letting them drop to coils on the ground at her feet. She grabs the bar of the heavy cuffs locking his wrists together, and starts squeezing to soften the metal.  “You with me?”
“Six,” she reminded him gently. “Skuld is
“... Ma’am?”
"Mostly sitting around. Some flying, mostly exotic locales. Occasionally, gunfire and explosions. I usually handle those in the suit, but it's been known to follow me back to the airport."
Toni flinches violently, almost like Pepper physically hit her, and her eyes are suddenly hot and burning. “Jesus, Pepper,” she whispers, and her voice quavers, chokes. She puts a hand over her face, tries to reach for outrage and indignation, but doesn’t find them. “Fucking
Belatedly realizing he can probably feel her embarrassment through the bond, she snaps her jaw shut and shuffles her feet. Her hand settles on Steve’s hip, and she charges the static lock on that gauntlet. Just in case. In the next second, they’re airborne, rocketing into the sky, and Steve’s whoop of sheer delight rings in her ears like silver bells.
SHIELD, I don’t need Fury, I don’t need your goddamn business. I have clients falling all over themselves to contract for arc reactors, satellites, phones, and skinweave gel. If I never design
For once in her life, Toni decides to be fashionably early, arriving in the conference room with a fresh cup of coffee and her StarkPad at 9:20am, forty full minutes before Coulson’s meeting is supposed to begin. She wants to get some more work done, but can’t go to the workshop (because then she’ll never make the meeting at all) and the resident assassins are still digging into their toyboxes in the communal area, paying little attention to anything that wasn’t a method of messy death. She thinks it’s kinda cute how giddy they get over the Starktech she designs for them, but she simply can’t work with Clint squeeing every two seconds. There’s a reason he’s banned from her workshop when it's crunch time and she needs to focus.
“Sorry to have missed it,” Clint says, peeling and sectioning the orange with his fingers.
, he tells himself.
in his expression. “Then again, I’m a supersoldier.”
“You got it, honey,” she says. “Anything you want. Anything at all.”
“Aw, shit. I knew there was something I was forgetting to give you.” She wiggles out of his lap, goes over to the table where she left her briefcase and thumbs the biometric lock. She comes back and plops back down in his lap and breaks the seal on the manilla envelope with her thumb. “I kinda took care of all that too,” she mumbles. “It’s been done for weeks, just… there wasn’t a good moment to give it to you.”
“The scans,” Tony replies and sighs. He gulps coffee, and Steve waits impatiently for him to finish drinking. “I think whatever bit of the Phoenix picked me to hibernate in was there long enough, maybe even since the moment I broke the damn thing apart, it became part of me.”
Clint sprawls back against the couch, tucking his arms under his head. “Yeah, but you didn’t. You asked for help, you reached out to Coulson. I probably know better’n anyone how many people have burned you, Toni, so I’m just fucking proud of you. And so is Nat.” He closes his eyes, flops a hand around until he finds an edge of the blanket she discarded, and drags it over himself. “Me and Nat’ll work you into our team. I’ve been meaning to try some more aerial maneuvers in combat. Hard to do that without someone who can fly.”
“You’re a brat, kid.” Toni smiles fondly, then grins in vicious triumph when the last of the checks shade green. “Alright, time to take this baby out for a spin.”
. “I’m Toni.”
There’s a pause. “Shall I include your accounts with Stark Industries, Stark Solutions and your private servers, ma’am?”
Laughter bursts out of her throat. “Resistance is futile,” she agrees. “Just let me get a cup of coffee before you start with the pasty-faced drones and the nanovirus, huh?”
Our Lady Peace, "In Repair"
“Please shut up,” Steve says again, and he realizes he’s begging, but anxiety’s churning up his stomach now, and in this moment, he doesn’t care. “Just leave it alone, Clint.”

The silence is very pointed.
Christ, she’s going to end up killing him. He’s too raw, it’s been too long, and the damned bond between them is singing with a whole bunch of emotions he thought he’d long since lost. He forces himself to step back, take a deep breath, turn around, keep his goddamn hands to himself. There’s nothing gentle in him right now, no romance, nothing she deserves.
He’s being uncharitable, and he knows it. Cho needs equipment transported, is taking the time to ensure it’s packed away carefully, crossing her Ts and dotting her Is before making the trip to New York. But the stress is just
Thankfully, he has Clint to do that for him.
“Asscrack of the morning. Around four, I think. It’s dark anyway. You were asleep a while.” He readjusts his head until his cheek is on the back of her skull. “Bucky said you had a panic attack. You need a walkthrough?”
“Even my arrogance won’t let me call myself the Messiah,” Toni murmurs, and her fingers are at his waist, tugging upwards on the hem of his shirt. He bends to let her strip it off him, hears it land somewhere off in the corner of the workshop. Her hands spread across his chest, and a muffled noise rumbles in her throat, strained and abrupt. “Fuck, James. Look at you. Jesus fucking

Steve’s grin is bright and sudden, and he slides his hand up over her shoulderplate to hook around the back of her neck. “You’re far too late for that,” he says. “I was on a USO tour, after all. I caught more than one eyeful of someone else’s fun along the way.”
It’s still a near thing. By the time she sees the broad beach with the dock, the curiosity is killing her. Adjusting her path away from the cliff, she soars up, until the mansion rises in front of her. She cuts around it, arcing wide to the courtyard in the front, and light winks at her, a brilliant flare that draws her attention.
“It appears as though there was a malfunction in one of the lateral vent panels, ma’am, resulting in an improper seal which allowed a minute amount of unfiltered air to enter the armor. That error has now been corrected. The scrubbers should clear any lingering trace momentarily.”

He'd forgotten he was capable of such venom, but he's abruptly reminded when Carol reels back like he socked her in the jaw, eyes impossibly big in pain and grief. This is escalating quickly. Too quickly for sanity or safety. It's nearly too much effort, but he closes his eyes and forces himself to calm down. To

Natasha lays her hand gently on the edge of the comm, brushing a fingertip along the ring of the speaker. “You’d never do anything that compromises Toni’s right of choices,” she says, less of a statement of fact and more of a gentle reminder. “Even if that would solve a lot of problems,” she adds, after thinking about it for a moment.
“It’s what we all
I give no fucks how hot you are.’” Bucky grins at the memory as Steve laughs, and tips his chair back on two legs. “She called me James for weeks. Felt like I was back in school and I'd just pissed off one of the nuns.”
She racks her brain, digging deep into the tired memories and sputtering synapses, dredging for any idea that isn’t going to get her a) killed, b) brainwashed, c) shot full of arrows, d) ruined at by Pepper or e) tortured by Natasha. “I got nothin’,” she breathes, mostly to herself.
Steve replies with nothing but pure relief and absolute faith, and he holds Tony's hands tight in his own as Kobik’s lies turn to ash and stardust in the Phoenix fire surrounding them.
“Sometimes,” he says, and she feels him kiss her forehead, a light pressure she barely senses. “Go back to sleep, Toni. I’ll be here when you wake up.”
In hindsight, Steve is a fucking idiot.
All three of them are digging through the trunks, pulling out armor and weapons and more weapons, when she makes her way back to sit and caffeinate. “Vultures,” she mumbles into her mug, and takes a noisy slurp.
It's familiar and unfamiliar at the same time. Though it uses the same metaphorical muscles as connecting to computer networks and electronic devices, it’s a completely different sensation to connect with a living mind, and for a bad moment, Tony doesn’t think he’ll be able to do it at all.
There was nothing to be done, no blankets to tuck more firmly, no books to remove from their chests, no hair to carefully brush from their faces. Frigga had done that, and more, on previous visits, the last not ten minutes ago. The boys didn’t understand, she didn’t think, watching the three sleep. Loki, cleverer than Thor, perhaps he might have gotten an inkling, perhaps, but even his wildest guess could not come close. Skuld herself could not know, she thought, stretching a hand to hover just above her daughter’s face, resisting the urge to disturb her slumber and ask her, just to be certain.
“I don’t want to fuckin’ see you text-fucking him,” Bucky snaps. “I got enough of that by accident. Not really interested in seeing it on purpose.”
“Thank you JARVIS, that will be all,” she says firmly. She can feel his disapproval in the silence he leaves behind. JARVIS does more with pointed silences than most can do with an entire speech.

It’s from the Joint Dark Energy Research Facility, flagged for review, observation and intervention by the Avengers Initiative and Stark Security.

until you’ve had a break,” Bucky growls, and she glares up at him defiantly. He stops, takes a deep breath, lets it out slowly. Tiredly, “Fuck’s sake, Toni. You gotta make it as fucking difficult as you can, don’t you? Well, can’t say I didn’t warn you.”
,” she says, grinning widely. “You’re her soulmate.” When Helen twitches ever so slightly, she knows she guessed right. And she turns to point up at Pepper with the smuggest, most obnoxious smirk she can dredge up at the moment. Pepper sears her with a look of blistering disdain, then disappears from the window.

Before she can fall much farther, Toni flips down again and accelerates to nearly Mach 1, looping wide to head for the shoreline again. “While I appreciate your cost-saving, J, I built them to blow them up.”
“Yeah? Sounds really lovely. You’d be bored to fucking tears in a few days.”
. Another blow comes, driving into the left side of her armor, and she feels the impact jolt through her ribs, pain flaring in a sheet of white.
Out of nowhere, a warm hand brushes her hair back, gathering it loosely at the nape of her neck. Another hand, warm, but unresisting, settles awkwardly between her shoulder blades. She glances up, and the Winter Soldier is kneeling beside her, looking vaguely shocked at himself. “What are you doing?” she asks scratchily.
She chances a move into the hallway, creeping along the concrete floor with her back to the wall and her knife reversed along her forearm. All she can hear is dripping water, and a scuffling scurry that is more likely rats than it is masked men. She isn’t even sure she’s going the right way, but she isn’t going to sit there in a cold room and wait for someone to save her.
“Dictation noted, ma’am,” JARVIS says placidly, “and filed directly in the trash bin.”

“Thanks,” she says mechanically, but has already stopped really paying attention because the bulk of her formidable brain power is occupied trying to wrap itself around the notion that
He doesn’t move except to straighten his posture from where she drops him, and just sits there, staring up at her with a hollow-eyed intensity that sends chills racing down her spine. “You’ll be taken. You have high value as a target. Iron Maiden, Stark Industries, Stark Solutions. One soulmate, of high value due to his unique skillset. Through you, he may be controlled.”
and Bucky knows that. He could say he wants a trip to the fucking moon, and Toni would build him a rocket ship. But what he wants is much simpler. She's already doing it. “Finish my arm,” he says firmly, and palms her cheek. “Sick of carrying this Hydra shit. Much rather carry yours. Have you with me always.”
Toni blinks, rapidly, a lot. “Uh... “ She and Pepper have had a couple of variations on this argument for some time now, but she’s never threatened to remove her from her own companies. “You can’t do that?” But she’s not really eager to find out if Pepper actually can or can’t. “You know what? I’m done talking about me. Let’s talk about you. And Helen. Cos
Incredibly, the only thing she hits is a pair of arms, one metal and one flesh, suddenly there to catch her. Stupidly, she blinks up at the very tall man in the black leather tactical suit. She can only see the top of his face, because he has something covering his nose and mouth, and his eyes are painted with greasepaint. She has no idea where he came from or what he’s doing here, but she’s never really been happier to see anyone in her life because he caught her, and that means she isn't splattered across the grass and dirt.

Toni doesn't hesitate to speak her mind, and it's one of the things Clint really appreciates about her. Neither one of them have patience or the appropriate brain-to-mouth filters for idiots, and sometimes there's nothing he likes better than to just sit with her and see who can come up with the snippiest one-liners. It's fun. It's challenging. It's something he can do with no one else in his life, because no one else has the snark or the weird twist to their sense of humor he and Toni do.
as the arrow is loosed. “I just wanted a vacation,” he says. “A nice anniversary spent away with my girlfriend. Lie on some beaches. Enjoy the sun. Maybe try to ride a kangaroo. See that giant-ass rock that’s supposed to be the oldest thing on the planet. Surf. Wrestle a shark. You know, fun shit you do when you’re taking it easy.”
He stares at the file folder, tapping his thumb against it now. The embossed Avengers symbol gleams at him under the overhead light, and he sighs faintly. However his path started, little Philip Coulson from Manitoc, Wisconson is now in charge of a team of the most powerful people in the world, and these are the decisions he is now responsible for making.
He sighs and closes his eyes, because the voices clamoring against his skull are pitching upwards in volume again. “What,” he asks, once again through gritted teeth, “would you possibly accept from me that might at least make you
He stares ferociously up at her, prowling below like a goddamn predator. “I want to know why,” he snarls. “Why did she have to die? Was it because of me? Was that the only reason?”
It isn't a threat, or a promise, or a even a guarantee. It comes out of Clint's mouth ringing with the truth of an immutable law of the universe. And Clint may be an unaugmented, plain, old, vanilla human being, but there is absolutely
There are tools scattered about just inside the melted hole in the outer hull, but when Tony floats in and peers around, he can’t see a single crewmember or engineer scurrying anywhere. He frowns a little in confusion, a little in concern. That’s not normal, he knows. He used to be the Director of SHIELD, after all. One thing all Directors have made a priority, regardless of political leanings or agendas, was that any damage to a Helicarrier got round the clock repairwork done, overtime be damned, because as floating, armed-to-the-teeth fortresses, they were too valuable to be out of commission or weakened any longer than they absolutely had to be.
“As you wish, sir.”
“Okay,” he says, and pushes his hands through his hair. His voice is shaking just a little, but Tony’s not going to be the one who mentions it. “I believe you, Stark. What do you need us to do?”
, Toni, but you’re too much of a dumbass to accept that. You just handed me top-level clearance to everything you have. You fucking stupid goddamn idiot. Are you that fucking desperate you’ll just open wide for whatever freak of nature you feel like bringing home?”
Toni rolls her eyes, discomfort churning in her stomach. “Whatever, boss,” she mutters, poking at one last wire before glancing up at Bucky. He shakes his head and she makes a face, closing the panel. “Fact is, I’m not a team player. In fact, I’m fairly certain there’s a report floating somewhere in the SHIELD servers that states exactly that. Iron Maiden, yes. Toni Stark, not recommended. Teamwork gives me hives anyway. I don’t respect people who are supposed to make the calls. It was temporary, boss. I don’t want it to be anything more permanent.”
It’s no less disturbing a speech the millionth time he’s heard it, but Tony’s barely been paying attention. All of his focus is on Carol’s face, watching her reactions as her expression shifts from skeptical to disbelieving and straight into horrified, where it stays for the duration of the stitched-together clips of Kobik hovering over Tony's coma pod, Steve's frequent visits, the final damning monologue.
To no one's surprise, least of all Tony's, the deck of the
For some reason, Toni’s got an eyebrow up and a grin playing around the corners of her mouth. “Yeah,” she says, pushes herself off the window with her shoulder and moves to her chair to sit. “That’s one way to put it. You didn’t answer my question though. What do you want?”
She groans and stretches as best she can, wincing with mingled discomfort and relief as her spine pops in several places. She grinds the heels of her hands into her eyes, craves a shower so badly she can practically feel the scalding water pounding on her tightly-wound shoulders, can smell the shampoo she is going to

much money SHIELD is effectively dropping into her coffers. This is why she has lawyers.
Bucky just looks at her dubiously as she finishes listing off all her excuses, and she kind of hates that he's only known her for a few months, and yet knows her so well. His mouth tightens into a thin line of unhappiness, but blessedly, he chooses not to press the issue. “Alright, Toni,” is all he says. “If you gotta do this, then you gotta do it.”
“She can handle it, Clint,” Natasha says evenly.
“Starting to get that,” Bucky says, then shakes his head in amusement. Wasn’t he just thinking he was going to have a quiet week with Steve and Toni gone? Looks like he spoke too soon.

He puts the man down with a quick jab to the chest, might have crushed his breastbone, doesn’t think twice about it. There’s a momentary gap in the crowd rushing to subdue him, and he spins on the ball of one foot, jumping over a cart filled with bandages and metal instruments, sending it crashing to the floor behind him.
that?”
Time to leave.
It takes a few hours, but eventually SARAH — Smart And Radiant Archival Heroine — comes online, and makes her way into the Internet to see what she can see. Tony leans back as she departs SI servers and scrubs his face tiredly. “JARVIS, remind me to reflect on the morality of letting a baby AI loose on the internet in the morning, will you? I need to sleep.”
Steve smiles and opens the passenger-side door, puts the bag of produce in the back and settles into the seat. “I am,” he says, a little proud that he remembered to use the seatbelt without prompting this time. “Thank you for waiting for me.”
Toni makes a sympathetic noise into her coffee. “Do you want me to make you a plate?” she asks. “I don’t know what you like, but I can just pile it with what I usually grab, and you don’t have to eat anything you don’t want. How’s that sound?”
Clint sighs noisily. “It's just…hasn't she been through enough? Does the universe just really need to fuck her this much? I mean,
“Oh yeah,” Bucky says, and gets up to get Steve a wet rag for the blood on his face. “That was Clint. And yeah. Yeah, you should definitely take him seriously.”
- Discussion of the aftermath of Toni's time in Afghanistan. Jealousy. Rage. Mentions of violence and aftereffects of Steve's mind-control.
He’s on his hands and knees when she reaches him, head low and shaking back and forth. She grabs his nearest shoulder with her gauntleted hand and flips him onto his back. She throws a leg over his chest and fists her free hand in the hem of his torn undershirt, balling it up for leverage. Her eyes flick down as the cloth drags free of bloody skin, caught by a splash of color.
She freezes, blinks up at him. “What?” she asks carefully.
his twitter account, let alone think it a good idea to hit send, but he ruthlessly chokes them back. It’s none of his business. It really isn’t.
“Stark Tower is significantly larger than either the Manor or the Malibu mansion, ma’am,” JARVIS says, and Toni grins a little. He sounds offended. “Your estimated time frame did not take into account the complexity of the security systems, nor did it consider the number of individual work stations and access nodes that required additional installation of protocols to be compatible with my program.”
not back then, anyway. Minute I saw him in that ridiculous fucking suit, it made sense. Guess the other makes sense now too.”

“No, Miss Stark,” he says, and that crawl is now a colony of fire ants marching up and down her back. He’s nervous. His eyes keep flitting back and forth, darting around like koi in a pond. “Just traffic. I think there’s an accident ahead. I’m going to have to take an alternate route. Is that alright?”
“Yeah.” He inhales through his nose. Lets it out with a small, tight smile, turns eyes just a little too blue, a little too wild towards Bucky. Ferocity boils just beneath their surface, strange and unnerving. “Just all kind of.... hitting me at once. You and me and...” He nods towards Toni. “
“JARVIS will let me know,” Coulson says. Fuck, he must have heard everything. “I’ll handle it from here.”
He turns on his heel and walks back towards the door, hears the Asset whisper around the edges of his mind, caged and restless. He ignores it, because he can, but there's an edge of it in his stride.
He knows that, just as Toni and Clint and Natasha made room in their strange co-orbits, they’ll make room for Steve. And not just for Toni’s sake. For Bucky’s too, because he’s integrated with them now. He belongs to them, and they belong to him.
Toni grunts, a sharp, surprised
“Check your six, Stark,” Coulson says just as suddenly. “You’re not done yet.”
“Maybe.” Rhodey’s grin is easy and smart-assed. “Do you still hate me?”
Well, he wanted Tony Stark awake to see what he was doing. The Phoenix Force is a complication, but maybe he can turn it into a boon. If he can secure Tony’s loyalty, which shouldn’t be that difficult or time-consuming, Steve’s plans come to fruition much quicker and with more chance of success than his previous assessments calculated.
“Yeah,” Clint says pensively, then catches Tony’s eye and gives him a very significant look. “You know you gotta take this to her now.”
The Tea Party, “Cathartik”
The color is wrong. Still blue, still beautiful, but instead of calming him like it normally does, the hue makes him tense. It nags at him, plucking at something in his somewhat hazy recollections of his return to consciousness.
“What are we doing, Toni?” he asks quietly. He isn’t looking at her at all, just staring at his hands resting loosely over his knees. He doesn’t pull away from her, and she doesn’t pull away from him.
Clint shakes his head. “It wasn't
He's sure he deserves none of it, but warmth and affection swell up, carrying humility and awe through Tony's chest, bubbles and pops until he thinks he might burst from it.
He shrugs again. “I decided you were right. So mark your calendar. I got no reason to be jealous, and we've all got enough shit on our plates without making more drama for ourselves. You’re not a threat to me and her. I shouldn’t be a threat to you and her.”
It might be irrational, because he’s seen Toni since, but always from a distance, always with glass and bodies between them. He has no idea how he’s going to react to seeing her awake and in arm’s reach.
about this, but his head is too foggy to figure it out.
“Spoilsport,” she says with a grin. Consulting the HUD shows her position as nearly two hundred miles from the shore. While it might be time to turn back, now that she’s in international waters, it’s also time to blow shit up. “Give me some drones, J. I need to test the repulsors and the targeting system, so the trip back’s as good a time as any.” She pauses, checks the time in the corner of the HUD. “Steve back yet?”
“Knew I hired that woman for a reason,” she says, and bends to sign the charter, then shoves it over to him to witness. “Well, that’s done. Let’s go recruit us some goddamn superheroes.”
Clint doesn't look down, doesn't look at Bucky or Natasha, just stares straight ahead with a pleasantly neutral smile. “That's because I do. I've been told that reaching for lethal weapons when anxious is antisocial and dangerous, but hey, everyone has to have a security blanket.”

She inhales deeply, goes up on the balls of her feet, and presses a light, quick kiss to his lips. “I have absolutely no idea. I am literally humming with energy, and I have no clue how I’m gonna burn it off.”
asked with various inflections at increasing volumes. “And now he’s…lost.”
She wonders idly if parents of flesh-and-blood children go through this uncertainty and fear as their spawn come into awareness and understanding. She wonders if parents look into the faces of their sleeping kids and wonder:
It stops being okay late in the evening on day five, when Steve comes back from the gym, fuming and frustrated, with his hands covered in the blood-streaked innards of yet another supersoldier punching bag, and a hole that looks suspiciously like a repulsor blast in his shirt.
A lump rises in his throat, and tears blur his vision, which is fine because then he doesn’t have to see in sharp relief the moment the plane smashes into the ice and sends him flying into the freezing water.
Econoline Crush, “Home”
Panic hammers suddenly under Bucky’s soulmark, and there's nothing but cold fury under the white star.
It’s just her luck; all three of them are in the kitchen when she steps off the elevator. She falters for a moment as three sets of eyes turn to watch her, debates turning and fleeing, debates running down to get the care packages she put together for each one of them and bribe them into forgiveness. Only for a moment, though, because none of that is going to fix the damage she caused. So she squares her shoulders, hitches up her big girl pants, and walks forward into the zone of judgement.
At least that’s something.
He’s silent as he watches Tony pace around the laboratory where Steve had him moved after that Capitol business all those months ago. He kinda hates to admit it, but there’s something fluid, focused and attractive about the absolute attention Tony pays each piece in the lab, from the destroyed pod with its petal-curled, jagged-edged, bowed-out door panels, to the filing cabinet by the work table that contains only extra office supplies.
Toni swallows again, doesn't want to ask but knows Natasha will give her a blunt answer. “

“Sure you do,” Bucky says, and steps into the elevator. “See if you feel that way after you’re clean, fed and fucking rested. Until then, I’m ignoring your incoherent rambling bullshit.”
She can tell him down to the hour, the minute, the second, because her mind seizes on numbers and doesn’t easily let go, but she makes a show of counting. “God, let’s see… it’s April so… five and a half years? Six and a half years?” She flashes him a self-deprecating smile. “We don’t really pay so much attention to anniversaries and dates and stuff like that. We just celebrate life in general.”
“Good thing my ego doesn’t ride on making sure I have your undivided focus, Rogers,” she says primly, and he can

She doesn’t ask, and neither does he. They don’t talk about it, because they can’t.
He directs her high, up into the clouds for cover, and she follows without question. Her HUD overlays a map of the terrain below, a blinking red dot tracking the location of the SHIELD vehicle in realtime.
“Manor systems rebooted, ma’am,” JARVIS says from the speakers embedded in the ceiling. “Performing diagnostics now. Estimated completion of diagnostics, twelve minutes.”
He slides into it, vaguely grateful that it doesn’t hurt as much anymore.
“Ma’am, if I may suggest, returning to your workshop would be the optimal route, as the diagnostic software in the Tower’s mainframe is far superior to the basic suite installed on the suit.” JARVIS is exceedingly polite and even sounds like he’s doing his very best to be the most helpful, but Toni coded and compiled and brought him to life. She knows his tricks better than anyone.
However, the next chapter is almost written, so cross your fingers I finish up early and can post something for you by Sunday night or Monday morning. :)
Toni’s vision shimmers with sudden tears, and she wonders when she ever did the miraculous thing that rewarded her life with the presence Natasha and Clint. She turns her hand under Natasha’s, laces their fingers together, lets her hair fall over her eyes. “I don't know what I would do without the two of you,” she says quietly.
“Always, darling. I love you.”
Steve smiles against his mouth, both hands in his hair now.
The deeper he goes, the stronger his disquiet becomes. He thought the building, that Stark Industries, was a facade to cover Iron Man’s villainous operations, that the floors would play host to a variety of illegal laboratories and hideous experiments. Stockpiles of weapons. Schematics for missiles and bombs. Torture rooms.
He frowns, looking lost in thought. “You need one,” he says absently. “People are going to start to wonder about things pretty soon.” He shifts his head, glancing at her, and rolls his eyes. “Oh hell, Toni. Stop looking at me like that. I don’t want to be your soulmate. I said I
Bucky knows the moment Steve and Toni finally get their shit together and let themselves bond.
“What?! No! That’s not what I meant!” Eyes wide, Toni throws herself right as the drone screams through the space she just occupied. Her followup repulsor shot is almost perfunctory, and the drone explodes in a satisfying shower of shrapnel. “JARVIS,” she says, low and dangerous, “I’m going to install you on a Speak ‘n’ Spell.”

can make Coulson do more than blink. “Well then.”
He glances back at the open door, through which Steve’s broad shoulders are just barely visible, hesitating. Maybe Steve is right, and he doesn’t have the capability yet to deal with all the shit that’s happened to him. Maybe he needs someone he can trust at his back, someone who can spot the things he’s missing.
sore from forging, actually making a soft noise of pleased surprise when she pulls out the escrima sticks and finds the button that charges them with fifty thousand volts of electricity.
JARVIS’s silence is a tad offended.
“She is,” JARVIS replies. “Ma’am has been airborne for approximately forty-five minutes, and does not seem inclined to return soon. Still, I advise haste, Captain. Ma’am will no doubt find something to tweak or tinker with before long.”
Steve’s eyes flick back up to his. “Are you sure I’m back to myself?” he asks, and there’s a moment of sheer panic at the thought that maybe Tony screwed something up when he was inside Steve’s head, because there’s no chance in hell normal Steve would sound that innocent with that gleam of interest in his eyes. He’s not

“No,” Fennhoff replies, and turns to the computer beside the chair, types on the keyboard. “Likely our conversation has triggered his awareness of self. A minor matter. He won’t remember us speaking in a moment. Sit in the chair, Captain.”

Rage and panic thrash, claw, can’t find purchase and sink back down again.
“Like I played chicken with a tank and lost,” she says, and cracks open an eye. Natasha’s face is schooled to neutrality, but the corner of her mouth is tugging up. “Just so you know, I will be writing a scathing Yelp review of your home country, Tash. Terrible hospitality, no care for foreign visitors. Zero stars. Will not recommend to anyone.”
but I’ll give you points for getting it close.” Her face softens, her voice grows less sharp. “Dr. Cho is just about ready. Toni’s going to be undergoing treatment in a few minutes. I thought I’d come see if you wanted to be there. You know, moral support for both your soulmates?”
Natasha tilts her head, still watching Toni and stirring her tea slowly. “I’ve heard better,” she finally says.
Decides not to ask for his dose after all, because he’s Captain America. He’s fought battles with worse than a headache.
“You are fucking evil,” Clint complains, sprawled across the couch in the den with an ice pack cradled to one cheek. He spears Natasha with a dark, baleful look before letting his head roll back against the cushions.
She scrambles on her hands and knees backward as Steve approaches, kicking up onto her feet when she has clearance. Her brain is racing in a hundred different directions, only a few of which are bright and jagged paths to fear and panic at the sight of blond, blue-eyed muscle stalking towards her. But mostly, she’s focused and grinning, anticipating where his first strike will come from and calculating what her best course of action will be.
His body moves against his will, settles in the chair, placidly allows Fennhoff to fasten the cuffs around his wrists and chest. Steve stares at the doctor balefully as diodes are attached around his head, one at a time.
She can’t catch her breath, and panic slams into her throat. She hitches and flails, claws at her chest, vision going spotty and grey...
and creating framework plans for a broad spectrum of possible outcomes is what he does best.
“Keep me updated.” Steve turns his attention back to the blueprints, and a plan of attack begins to come together in his head. He’s always been a good tactician, it’s where he really shines. He pulls open the Velcro flap on the side pocket of his combat pants -- always jumps a little, even though he’s sure he’s heard the sound a thousand times before, because it feels like he never has -- and fishes out a pad of paper and a pencil.
“Sure,” Bucky says easily, turns away as the door closes. He waits for jealousy, anger, possessiveness to flare. And it does. It’s there, probably always will be to some extent. But it's muted and weak, all but drowned by relief and a sense of rightness, contentment that Toni is somewhere she wants to be, somewhere she’s happy. He’s not going to try to unpack it much more than that, because it’s enough as it is.
without gagging on the utterly filthy lie, talks about honoring current military contracts for offensive technology, talks about the complete end of the Stark era of arsenal assembly by 2008. Moves into talking about their new satellite program, the plans to have the next-gen StarkPhone and the new first-gen StarkPad in the hands of consumers by Christmas. Speaks about the rebrand of Star Solutions to Stark Solutions, the merging under the umbrella of the Stark name.
“I’m beginning to recognize a theme to our attempts at vacationing,” Clint says, leaning just as heavily on her as she is on him.
She will never act on it, or at least has almost zero intention to ever act on it, but she’s gotten this far in life by making plans and having contingencies for even the remotest possibilities stored away in the back of her mind. But if it is necessary, she won’t have any compunctions like Clint would. Clint may be bound by morals and respect for self-determination, but Natasha has her own limits to how much she will tolerate. She hasn’t reached them yet, but her moral compass is far, far cloudier than her soulmate’s could ever be.
Electricity sparks on either side, and his breathing picks up, harsh and fast, his body remembering the agony that comes from the device, even if his mind never retains it. Muted by the hiss of static and snap of lightning, the operators discuss the technical details, leaving him to sit in horrific anticipation of the moment fingers made of fire and torment reach into his head to dig out his memories.
Bucky really doesn’t want to do this. He’s not the therapist type. He’s not anywhere near stable enough to deal with this. But that’s the thing: none of them have ever been stable enough. He’s read enough psychology books and articles about shell shock and battle fatigue – what they call post-traumatic stress disorder these days – to know that every single one of his weird family unit could use deep, deep therapy, but they clutch each other and drag themselves through, muddling along until they find something that works.
She swats at his hand in reflex, and yelps as she hits metal instead of skin. “I dunno,” she says, scowls and shakes her hand briskly. “Why? I mean, if you’re asking for a race, James, you’re going to win.”
“I’ve isolated a clean sandbox in the Cubby cluster. Data transfer is in progress, and is estimated to complete in ten minutes.”
He complies. Ignores the strident voice in his mind. Ignores the shred of self he has left, screaming and rattling the bars of his mental prison.
But he doesn’t make any kind of move, just stands statue-still, watching her.
which is why I let you do it.” He squeezes his eyes shut, feeling sweat pop, go cold, go clammy. He doesn’t know if he can get through this and still be sane once he’s out the other side. “Talk to me,” he says desperately. “I don’t care. We can be pissed later. Just fucking talk to me. I’m gonna fuckin’ snap if you don’t.”
“FitzSimmons,” Coulson says quietly, with a smile.
Steve, on the other hand…
The rest of the session passes in blessed silence, even though Steve can feel the weight of her knowing gaze the entire time no matter how attentively he stares at the pages on his lap.
The caption beneath it reads: NATASHA STARK FINDS HER SOULMATE.

But that can’t be all of it. A fist fight with Carol can’t explain any of this. He’s been on some weird mind-trippy drugs before, but he’s pretty sure that even Carol can’t punch him to the moon.
“I thought Morgan was going to get the inheritance,” she says, and flinches back when he raises his hand again.
“Oh, uh. Fitz,” he says, after a blink. “Leo Fitz. I’ve followed your career right from your time at MIT. I loved your paper on using synthetic stem cells to scaffold a connection between nano circuitry and nerve endings. Fascinating stuff, even if it's a bit fantastic until the technology improves.” He fishes around behind him without turning, snags the wrist of his companion, and gently pulls her forward. “This is my lab partner, Jemma Simmons.”
“Anyone ever tell you it’s not nice to go peeping into other people’s heads, Tony?” Clint’s voice is only slightly tinny in his earpiece, and incredibly amused. Tony’s starting to regret playing into Clint’s punnery, because it’s been

It’s more difficult to pull himself away from the market than he anticipated. His fingers long for a sketch book and a quiet corner, long to capture on paper the family of five buying fruit, the couple arguing over lettuce, the dreamy-eyed reader with her hand propped on her chin and her eyes focused on her book, the clearly-bonded triad who can’t stop touching each other’s hands and arms and shoulders having lunch three tables down. It’s been a long,
He swings his arm up and hooks his hand around Steve's shoulder, beams back at him and says, “Catch me up on what happened while I was taking a long winter's nap.”
The aches of his various bumps and bruises are instantly forgotten. Right. This is why he’s here. How silly of him to forget.
There is more than just their shared name and shared love for Clint. There is movie night and lunch on the boardwalk and late night texting and ice cream and hours in the gym beating each other up. There is laughter and friendship. There are nights curled with Clint around Toni, because she dreams of IEDs and torture and palladium poisoning and loneliness and a nameless cold, a freezing, drowning dark, and needs the comfort of warm bodies to remind her she is alive and free and well.
Pillar, "Frontline"
Edit: The art has now been embedded in Chapter 1 and in Chapter 5, where they belong. : )
The edge of the shield bites into her armor, and titanium isn’t much of a deterrent to vibranium. Toni shrieks as Steve saws it back and forth, driving it down through the plates and circuits, uses it like a goddamn shovel to pry off the entire chestplate in ragged chunks of red and gold.
that it breaks the hold Red Star has on her. “Her old man is due to kick the bucket any day now, and when she inherits, Toni’s going to run the business into the ground. She’s an idiot, honestly. Gorgeous, but not much there.”
she thinks, fading out.
“J, do me a favor and run a diagnostic on the filtration system, will you?” she asks, keeping one eye on the HUD’s co-ordinate display and one eye on the actual landscape. She wants to retch but, as she found out on the night of that infamous birthday party last year, throwing up inside the helmet means she’s going to have to fabricate a new helmet, or she’ll be smelling puke for weeks no matter how thoroughly she scrubs it.
She doesn’t want to uncurl from her ball, making checking her physical condition a challenge, but her head is clearer, her thoughts steadier. “Yeah. I think so, anyway. What time’s it?”
She blinks, watches Natasha watching her with concerned eyes. “My workshop,” she says, clears her throat because her voice is scratchy. Continues, soft and unprompted, “Stark Tower, New York City. It’s April 25th, 2012. I'm Toni Stark. You're Tash and Clint and Bucky.”
Toni swims back to consciousness and immediately regrets it. The lights are dim, but still stab into her eyes like devil’s pitchforks, and her head has that tender feeling, like someone scooped out parts of her brain and overstuffed her skull with cotton. Her throat is screaming for water, and her mouth is dry and gummy, tongue thick and clumsy.
Most days, he respects the do-not-disturb vibe coming off her locked workshop, but today is not one of those days. “Lemme in, J,” he says, after trying the handle and finding it immovable.
not in the mood, Barnes,” Toni says in the silence after the music stops, and swipes the video she’s watching backwards.
She’s tried to sleep, laid down on the couch, curled up with Bucky, curled up with Clint and Natasha, taken melatonin, warm milk, half a Valium, everything but booze. (She can function while drunk, but she needs better than functional. She needs to be at the top of her game, sharp and crisp and clear.) No matter what she tries, sleep evades her. Sleep attacks her. Sleep sends her screaming back to consciousness, gasping for air and looking for enemies to fight.
It takes a minute, because Bucky doesn't have Toni's smarts, but he's certainly not all that slow on the uptake. His eyes widen a little as it dawns on him. “Uh, thanks then, J. I like you too.”
He finds himself smiling and swiping to answer the call before making a conscious decision to do so. “Coulson,” he says, his customary salutation, ignores the nervous flutter in his stomach and eyes the elevator doors as they open silently in front of him.
Clint smirks, sudden and sharp. “Bird Squad looks after its fledglings, Stark. Owl take you under my wing. Just try not to ruffle any feathers while you're in my nest. I'm tired of ducking the un-emused’s punches.”
“Yeah,” he says, and thinks it's goddamn pathetic that it's another decision he can't make. His hands tighten on the back of the chair. “What would you have done if I’d said no?”
The presentation goes surprisingly well, mostly because she doesn’t have the brain power to deviate from the cards Pepper handed her. She talks about the exciting new direction for Stark Industries, speaks glowingly about the vision and support of the board of directors, manages
“Understood. We’ll wrap up as soon as possible here, and head back to give you a hand.”
“Stark's entire history with authority consists of Congressmen trying to take her property, and SHIELD infiltrating her company to spy on her. Authority has come at her sideways, insinuated itself into her life, demanded things be done. Authority hasn't asked for cooperation and respect. It's ordered it, and done very little to earn it.”
“Did she beg for her life?” he rages, and raises the shield again. “Did she plead for you to stop?”

She sighs through her nose, a deep exhalation the ends on a wince and an involuntary motion of her hand towards her ribs. Her eye is throbbing too, and there’s an ache in the wide scrape above her eyebrow that’s still sluggishly leaking blood. “They’re still going to kill me,” she mutters. “I’m not going to be able to hide any of this shit from them.”
Kobik whirls, her pigtails flying, and power all but crackling off her limbs and hair.
The relief on Hogan's face is obvious, and his shoulders relax. “Good. Still, client confidentiality is something Stark Solutions employees are supposed to keep in mind.”
Clint has proven immune to her dirtiest death-glare, but that never stops her from sending them his way. She grumbles and grumps wordlessly as she straightens her workout clothes around her, then stretches her arms with a grimace. “Remind me why I hired you again?”
“Stark.” Coulson’s voice is tight. “We’re in the middle of… I just heard your repulsors.”
Toni grins, reaches up and snaps the faceplate down. “I’m Toni Stark, world-class engineer,” she says. “And you are FitzSimmons, world-class geniuses. If you can’t find something to cobble together in
to counter whatever she might do. Except me. You need to trust me, and you need to trust that I know what I’m doing. Steve's still in there. I know he is. We just have to get him back.”

“What date is it?”
“C’mere, Buck,” Steve says, wiggles his fingers invitingly. “Toni’s right. Us three.”
Something flies out of the left, blinking blue and he reaches up to bat it away. It hits the palm of his metal hand, and there’s a pulse of pressure through him. His arm suddenly goes dead.
A flash of premonition warns him, and he spins on a heel, graceful and inhumanly fast, and catches Carol's wrist, halting a hand glowing with radiant energy inches above his shoulder. He eyes it, then arches an eyebrow at her, finding that he's not surprised in the slightest. “Carol,” he chides. “Is that really how you want to play this out?”
“You had rope burns on your wrists, Clint had a black eye, and you slept for twelve hours after that. It doesn’t count.” Natasha fiddles with something on the side table and then holds a glass of water with a straw out.
“Understood. Would you like to warn sir and Clint about the start of your training program, Natasha?”
Bucky Barnes slides into the recesses of his mind, and the Winter Soldier comes forward.
Deep in the back of her head, she knows what he’s doing. He’s deliberately riling her up so her anger will override everything else that might be holding her back. It’s effective, she has to admit; even though she knows it’s just a trick, it’s working a little too well.
She presses her fingers on either side of her nose, squeezing her sinuses gently. Christ, her head hurts. It’s the kind of mammoth migraine that laughs in the face of pain relief, will only be cured by sleep and food and more sleep.
“So,” Kate says, after an awkward silence. “You want us shooting things and knocking down SHIELD agents and superhero types who might be compromised?”
She’s rewarded by Pepper’s most withering look, the one that scares her straight down to her toes. “Don’t,” she says, and the soft tone is gone now. It’s all hard and unmoving, the Big Boss Pepper voice Toni usually prefers to see used on obstinate board members because it always makes that person quail and quake. “Because I’d take the promotion, Toni, and I’d fire you from every position you hold.”
To the left of where her fist is a blue circle with the bright white outline of a triangle inside. Just like her arc reactor.
Rhodey finally sighs faintly and starts moving away. “Good night, Toni.”
Eight flights, nine. He’s got about ten flights left to finish the conversation and wipe what he’s sure is a sappy smile off his face. His standards do not include walking into a meeting with one of his personal heroes like a college kid with a crush. “Was there something you needed, Ms. Potts? I’m on my way to a meeting, but--”
“Mark III engaging a hostile on Level D,” Iron Man says, and there’s a strange whine and a glow from the palms. And then Steve is flying backwards, bent double from the impact of light that crashed into his stomach. He twists and lands on his feet, a spread hand keeping him balanced. Another whine builds, and he covers himself with the shield, hearing the ray ring and slide off the vibranium.
“I was wondering when you'd get around to that,” Natasha says. “He's fine. He's been sitting there for two days.” She nods at a chair Toni hadn't noticed, pushed a little away from the bed. “With a knife in hand. I’m not sure if he was guarding you, or just couldn’t bear to be unarmed.”
“I’m sorry, Buck,” he mutters, jaw clenching with the effort to control his temper. No one at here is at fault, no one here deserves to be beaten to a pulp. He’s saving all that for Hydra. “I just can’t do this right now.”
Silence.
Oddly, it makes him feel just a little bit better about the modern world. He recognizes a tiny part of it now, he has something he can latch onto and hold tight when the chaos threatens to sweep him under. This, at least, is unchanged and untouched by time.
“Ma’am, Colonel Rhodes is at the door.”
“She said fuck off,” Clint says pleasantly. His arm curves around her back, and the muscles of his forearm are tight against her shoulder blades. “I speak fluent Undercaffeinated Genius. Let me know if you need anything else translated.”
Shudders a breath in. Closes her eyes. Breathes out.
He hits the ground on his hands and knees as the flames fade away, head low and panting hard. He’s drained, exhausted, want to do nothing more than curl into a ball and go to sleep for a week, then sleep for a week more over the loss of Rhodey. But he doesn’t have the time, or the opportunity, or the privilege, to do any of that.
Without conscious decision, she finds herself making her way down the dark, paneled hall to Howard’s office. This was his kingdom, the seat of power of his technocratic plutocracy. Toni as a child was never allowed through the doors unless summoned. It’s more than a little unsettling to learn that, at least for the time being, she is the Stark in charge of everything.
He needs to tell Steve. He
“Yeah.” He takes a final look at the skyline, gives himself just one more minute to feel worry and concern and frail, fragile hope. Then, with all the ruthlessness gained from his time as the Asset, he starts locking it all down, compartmentalizing, letting it chill and freeze until it's time to thaw it out again. He's aware it's likely not the healthiest coping technique, but he's got nothing else and besides, he's going for efficiency, not style.
“Good. Now… Close your eyes, sweetheart,” Bucky says, and turns his head to rest his cheek against her hair. “Been a rough day, and you’re on overload. I gotcha. You can let go.”
“With all due respect, sir, I think you’re putting too much stock into Agent Carter’s report. There were extenuating circumstances--”
He’s almost to the steps leading to the massive entrance, eyes blurred and greying, light-headed and dizzy with the onset of hypoxia, when he
Toni snorts again. “No way I’m faster than Clint,” she says, “but please don’t ever tell him you thought I was, because he’ll run my ass into the ground proving you wrong. I don’t have the ability to keep up with him without rocket boots. Any faster, and he’d break the sound barrier.”
“My companies design medical prostheses for amputees that are
and makes a few notes, flips pages back and forth, asks him more questions with answers that just make Peggy more upset. Finally, Fennhoff clears his throat, settles his face into a professional mask, polite and sympathetic, and says, “Well, Captain Rogers, it appears you’re suffering from retrograde amnesia.”
There never was a second Project Rebirth. He is not the second Captain America. He is the first and only Captain America. He was not married to Peggy. Peggy was not killed by Iron Man. He did crash a plane into the ice, and he slept in ice for over 70 years.
Day five, and Toni is on the verge of burning out. She’s passed the point of exhausted and is rapidly approaching needing serious medical assistance. She hasn’t seen anyone in more than 24 hours, (can’t even be positive
“My apologies, Captain Rogers. Ma’am borrowed it several hours ago, and it is currently in her workshop.” The AI pauses, then adds wryly, “I believe she meant to replace it before your return.”
She pulls the blade out of the forge and sets it on the anvil. Her shoulders have passed beyond sore, have settled into a dull throbbing set of knots that will require a tub of Icy Hot and a professional masseuse to wrestle out when all's said and done, but she picks up the hammer and starts swinging.
“Because,” he says through gritted teeth. “You’re tired. You just said you wanted to go to bed.”
“Good,” she says softly, and they just sit there for a long time, as he cries into her shirt and she strokes up and down his back soothingly.
He lifts his head as Natasha calls out, a little surprised. He’s light on his feet. Most people don’t even know he’s on them until it’s far too late. Natasha’s good though, very good. He lifts away from the wall and pads around the corner, sees her at the counter with a cup of tea in her hand, paper tag still dangling from the mug. She’s eyeing him in contemplation, but doesn’t say anything. “How’d you know I was there?”
time, trying to win Tony over to his side, a side Tony has to ruthlessly repress shuddering in horror to think about ever joining.
“I can’t, Rhodey,” she says, just as softly.
“That wasn’t foreplay,” Natasha returns evenly.
The guard’s eyes are as round as dinner plates, flicking between her and somewhere behind her. Toni can take a pretty educated guess at what’s murdering the hamster on his wheel:
------
After nearly eighteen hours of dreamless sleep, broken only twice to inhale a prodigious amount of breakfast food thoughtfully brought to her by Bucky -- who she is now one hundred and ten percent positive she doesn’t deserve in the slightest -- Toni is more or less herself again.
"I remember the Red Skull," he says weakly, massaging his temples with both hands. "I remember fighting Nazis in Germany. I remember Kreischberg..."
He stares for a long time after her, wondering exactly how fucked the world would be if she was ever inclined to conquer it. Decides he doesn’t want to know, because some things are best left unexplored. He turns to the fridge and starts making himself that sandwich, hands moving mechanically in the assembly of meat and bread and cheese and veggies, thinking and thinking and thinking.
Phil has come ready for a lengthy stay in the waiting room, even gone through the trouble of renaming his current guilty-pleasure reading project from
“That’s where I have to put my foot down, sweetheart,” Tony says, and takes a deep breath because he’s not sure at all if he can do this, but fuck it, he has to do something before she walks out of the Mansion with the entirety of his team under her spell. “Let ‘em all go, now, or you’re grounded, young lady.”
What the fuck is going on?
“Cap is here!” she says urgently, and he follows her vigorous pointing with his eyes, locks onto the bright, gleaming vibranium shield.
So he takes a deep breath, steels himself, reaches down into the well of instinct so recently acquired and pulls up the telepathy he now knows with dead certainty is there, waiting to be called on.
Based on Tony’s encounter with Steve, and the foggy memory he has of waking up, Clint calls in Kate Bishop, the Other Hawkeye, and Tony dutifully answers all her questions, and then the archers disappear somewhere for two days, leaving Tony to fend for himself.
“I don’t want to go,” she mumbles, lost and desperate, and her hand comes up to brush across Steve’s where it rests on her chest, and that jolt thrums through Steve with the bright static of lightning, a flash of that deep, shining place he glimpsed within Toni, of endless compassion and endless self-sacrifice.
on his tablet’s home-screen.
He smiles. It isn’t much of a smile, just a twitch upwards of the corner of his mouth, but it may as well be the Grand Canyon of happy expressions compared to what was on his face before. “My name is Bucky.”
I'm also taking prompts for an Avengers Academy AU I'm writing, where both Toni and Tony exist as twins. If it's something that would interest you, feel free to check out the work (starts with Double Date), and either comment with a notion (that will be credited), or send me an Ask/message on Tumblr.
Toni pauses mid-blast for a moment, then carries on. It's muted, it's not as all-encompassing, but she's definitely still got some anger management therapy to do. "I'll keep myself occupied, boss," she says, eyeing the remaining pair of agents through the faceplate, hot and hungry and needing blood all over again. "There's still
“Oh my god, Steve! You’re awake!”
This time, though, he doesn't think he'll be able to pull himself back. Iron Man is just too dangerous. Iron Man has done too much, taken too much, from him. His soulmated wife, murdered in cold blood just for being his wife. His best friend Bucky, captured and experimented on and mind-controlled to fight on Iron Man's side.
Until he hears, very clearly, Parker say, “Cap’s usually right, at least a little. Our community has been through too much in the last few years. We need to hear his side before we can make any decisions.”
And the fourth, and probably the most painful, thing is she needs to start designing another set of armor. Many sets of armor, in fact, since the STRIKE attack left her with nothing except salvage and scrap.
. He wasn’t expecting the ultimate answer to “want me to come fuck it better” be “he’s worth waiting for.”
Something sings past Toni’s ear, passing so close to her head it snicks through a lock of her hair. Red Star’s hand sprouts an arrow, and he recoils away from her.
She drops out onto the next floor through an overhead vent. It’s awkward and painful with only one hand available, and the blood slicking her hand makes her grip slip, sending her crashing down. She lands badly, wrenching her ankle. Keeps hobbling along. She’s almost there; just another few dozen feet. Overhead and behind, she hears the crash of the security door giving way, knows he’ll find the trap door she left deliberately open. Captain America’s a smart man. He’ll figure it out.
His whole life is here, exactly what Doctor Fennhoff told him was only a dream, a fantasy-world based on another man’s life. He wanders between the displays for he doesn't know how long, lost in memories he thought were illusions.
“I studied footage of you too, Toni,” he says quietly, and there's a look in his eye, a distant and angry look that sends chills down Toni's spine, even though she knows it's not directed at her.
Tony cracks the bottle top, smirks and drains half the bottle in a long gulp. “I didn't notice,” he replies, replacing the cap. “I usually have armor on or near me. Isn't that a thing everyone does in our line of work?”
Toni’s second-to-last thought is
“Are we friends, Phil?” Her voice is a little hoarse and raw. “I mean, I’d like to think we are, but I’m having a little bit of trouble right now trusting anyone who draws a paycheck signed by Squinty the Spy.”
Captain, if you’re going to lie through your teeth right in my face, at least have the common goddamn courtesy to make it believable.”
“... Having second thoughts?”
-------
Steve tells himself it’s in deference to Toni’s busy schedule that he leaves her session open, but he knows he’s lying and he hates himself just a little for it. Maybe he should have had Pepper book the appointments for him, but Toni’s depending on him to do this right, and the last thing he wants to do is half-ass it by handing it off to someone else when it gets a little hard.
“Of course,” he says without hesitation. “Anything you need, Tony. Anything at all.” He pauses for a brief moment, and decides to add a caveat that will hopefully limit Tony’s characteristic wandering through computer files. “I’m not sure how many we have remaining. Unfortunately, your departure damaged a lot of systems, including the databanks where most of the medical records are stored. We have offsite backups, of course, but it takes time to request those. I’ll pull up what I can and give you access to them immediately. Will that be enough to start?”
“Toni?”
“That’s what happens when you let Hydra dick around with it,” Bucky replies, though not without sympathy. He knows better than most people what Steve’s going through right now. “Doc says you’ve got another day or so before all that shit’s out of your system. But you’re not talkin’ to people who aren’t there anymore. That’s something.”
Carter follows her gaze, whips out a pair of latex gloves, and is slicing the package open. “This is Agent Carter,” she says, after tapping at her ear. “Stark’s behaving strangely, possible biological contaminant or mood-affecting technology in a package that was delivered here this…” She stops talking mid-sentence, staring at the two cards that spill from the envelope into her hand. “Oh,
He debates taking a suit back to the Helicarrier, because he’s pretty sure that arriving there with his body aflame the same way the security footage showed he left is just going to attract all sorts of attention he doesn’t want, but two things make him decide against it. The first is that he’s pretty sure they already know what he’s become, because he left in a streak of orange-yellow-gold fire that apparently burned through multiple bulkheads and the outer hull of the Helicarrier.  Coming back in a suit isn’t going to change the fact that they already know about him.
He smiles, drains his cup, mourns its emptiness. “May I brief you on the security threats while you work?”
Tony's smile is so bright, it hurts his face. “Toucan play at this game,” he says. “But I find myself desperately egretting every life choice that led me to this moment.”
ahead of her nearest competition in artificial intelligences. “How’re you doing, buddy?”
He reaches up, yanks her down into his lap, cuts off her babbling with a lazy kiss, kisses her til the tension in her shoulders and throbbing through their soulmark goes soft and pliant.
He can feel Toni practically vibrating with the need to know and frustration that she can’t guess it beside him. The more he smiles, the more she scowls. “Fine,” she grumbles, like he knew she would. “I’ll play your game, Barnes. But I want an explanation when you let me catch up to you.”
And he stares at it for a long time, touches it gingerly, traces the lines. Almost forgets Rhodey in the process of not wanting to recognize what he’s seeing. “Okay,” he says, disbelieving and incredulous. “What the
She waves over her shoulder as she rounds the corner and walks into her room. And stops dead, because James Barnes is sitting on the edge of her bed. He’s clean, and in Clint’s sweatpants and a black tank top, barefoot and hair tied back, and looks hellaciously stiff and uncomfortable.
She spins, dropping to a knee and hands coming up defensively. It’s the only thing that saves her head from being knocked off her shoulders.
“That’s what my driver’s license says. Well, not the
She shimmies into a sitting position, letting the sheet fall to her lap. His eyes automatically go to her breasts and darken; there’s an answering pull, sluggish but interested, in her groin. “Stop that,” she snaps, feeling her cheeks flush. “I know you have this thing where you say something that makes perfect sense to you, but
It takes him a moment to process that, because he almost can’t wrap his brain around it. “You’re gonna just toss away something you’ve had for thirteen fuckin’ years because
Her skin isn’t even flushed.
“Why did you hit me?” she asks again, voice small.
what makes you a fuckin’ fine woman.” The fire banks off, dies down, becomes an unbearable itch that makes him want to howl and claw at his arm, electricity crawling under his skin and snapping off sparks. He grits his teeth, pushes through it. “Most girls, fellas too, I suppose, would want to hear a story about the war. They want to know about Captain America. You… you’re asking about
“Whatever you want,” Toni says, then flicks her nose across his and pulls reluctantly away. “I’m sorry, honey. I gotta go. Meeting Agent Carter this morning, and if I’m late, she’ll snark off at me. And if she does that, well, I’m not going to be responsible for her medical bills or her dental work.” She tosses back the rest of her coffee, sets the cup by the sink, leans in and gives him a fleeting kiss. “Love you.”
. I was consulting.”
with resident telepaths and beg for a quick lesson on how to keep a crowd of obnoxiously loud broadcasters from stomping all over his mental personal space. Or even just maybe how to turn it
“Of course, ma’am.”
Suddenly, he’s tired of it. Tired of sleeping in the cold, tired of being haunted by images and faces and voices, flashes of whatever life he’d had before all this. Tired of orders and tired of killing and tired of the deadened, numb cavity where his heart should be.
The Winter Soldier’s gleaming metal arm, now dented and sparking and streaked with scorch marks, cocks back. She grits her teeth. “
Of course, Carter has to protest. Of fucking course she does. “These are time-sensitive arrangements, Stark, and you can’t just--”
“Not to blow my own horn or anything,” Toni says critically, leaning back and eyeing the readouts on the holoscreen above her head. “But this is probably the finest piece of technology I have ever made. You know, except for the arc reactor. And Iron Maiden. Okay, it’s
Jemma has a cup of coffee waiting for him when he gets out of the shower. She’s already buried in her Starkpad, but looks up with a brilliant smile as he comes into the room. He kisses her cheek and goes to the counter to make a bagel. “What’s on the schedule for today, love?”
Toni tenses. She wants to tell him no, she’ll wait in traffic because she has the awesomest boyfriend ever.
He shoves the yoke forward, and the plane tilts into an abrupt nosedive. And serenity settles into his soul, calms his nerves, smooths out his thoughts.
She doesn’t have her usual driver, because Marvin called in sick with a family emergency, but the fill-in her usual temp agency sent over seems to be at least minimally competent. The car is clean, at least, and he doesn’t try to ogle her much, despite being bent forward to fiddle with her stiletto heels, revealing an ample spill of cleavage in her red dress.
And the world goes solid and black for a long time.
“Ma’am has not slept in twenty nine hours, fourteen minutes. She slept for two hours, six minutes. Prior to her ‘power nap’, ma’am had been awake for thirty-eight hours, forty-five minutes. I anticipate your next question to be regarding her eating habits, sir. Ma’am has not had a substantive meal in three days, eighteen hours, and has been relying on Doctor Cho’s nutrition supplements to fuel herself.”
“Stark. We need him alive.”
“Take your time,” she says, lining up a shot on a pair of goons, and blowing them both into walls in quick succession. “Finding Steve is imp--”
to cure her massive trust issues.
Toni eyes him, shakes a tiny screwdriver in his direction. “I am a genius, and that ‘aw, shucks, really’ false modesty shit gives me cavities. I’m brilliant. And I made a fucking
“I know you don’t pay attention to the world around you, Toni,” James says, “but you’re getting shot at.”
The phone shatters in Bucky’s hand, and the world behind his eyes burns white and hot.
His hands go still on her face. “Forget those two assholes,” he says, roughly. “Worry about yourself right now, huh?”
“It’s really no problem, Cap.” He awkwardly pats Steve’s knuckles with his own and tries not to lean into him too much. “Just don’t tell the others I did this for you. I’d rather not find out Clint needed money in college, if you follow me.”
The silence feels awkward and pointed, and Toni grins when she hears the telltale whirr of Rhodey’s fans as they start to power down a moment later.
“It would be my pleasure, Clint,” JARVIS says, and the far screen flickers on. Toni eyes the ceiling, eyes Clint, wondering if she should fear for her life with her AI and her…boyfriend? friend with benefits?... conspiring.
“Steve, it’s 2012, not 1944,” Peggy says, quiet but firm, and pulls a small black device from her pocket. It clicks and beeps under her thumb, and she turns it towards him, showing photographs, changing them one by one with the push of a thumb. Him and Peggy, with dogs around their feet. Him, serious and sober, in the Captain America uniform with a red flower lapel pin and the rows of crosses in Arlington behind him. Picture after picture. Evidence of a life together. Wedding photos. Candid photos.
It starts being not okay when Bucky brings her breakfast the next day, to find her sitting at her main work station staring blankly at what is clearly, even to him, only partially finished schematics for Iron Maiden armor, the last edit of which is auto-logged at four hours ago, and her workshop is covered in scrap metal and scorch marks.
I am never watching Star Wars with you again.” She closes her eyes, shakes her limbs loose, bounces back and forth between her feet. “Should it really be this hard?”
Toni’s breath catches, and her pulse flutters in her throat. She hadn’t doubted, not really, because he was more physically expressive than verbally, but it’s the first time he’s said it out loud. “Aw, Clint, I love you too,” she says. “If I’d known this is all it would take to get you to admit it, I’d have had myself kidnapped
“Ma’am, I have finished decrypting the final layer of SHIELD security--” And Toni’s blood runs absolutely
She blinks again and shakes her head. “No,” she says. “I’m really not. I mean, I used to. Might again in the future. But right now? That’s
She leans back in her chair, holding the contract. Frustration surges again, deep suspicion right behind it. “So what’s the goal here, Carter?” she says, skimming the text on the first page. “Why are you and One Eye Winky so hellbent on making me go through every line of these things when there’s a perfectly good department full of shark-toothed lawyers three floors down doing absolutely
“Maybe I could make the magical bodysuit into Iron Man armor,” he muses aloud as he orients himself, shields his eyes, and hopes like all hell the naproxen is still working to stave off any recurring headache-inducing events that might happen to him along the way.
She yawns and scratches at her chest absently (
Before he can hit the ground, she’s flying, parallel to the floor. She slams into him with the approximate force of a fully-loaded semi, and feels more than hears the explosion of breath as his body bows around the curve of her shoulder guard.
Coulson’s return smile is amicable. “You don’t need to play those games, Toni. They’re far more loyal to you than they are to me. I’m just the guy who tells them where to go and what to do. You’re their family.” He pauses. “Carter passed on your message,” he says. “Hawkeye and Black Widow are on mission in Bolivia, but I am working on getting them extracted and brought home. I give you my word on that.”
“Yeah,” she breathes. “Kay.” She licks her lips, and it feels like cotton over sandpaper. His hands feel good, remind her of all the times he's been there, remind her of sunlight and beaches and her mansion on the cliffs. She misses it, suddenly, knows it's probably just the drugs, but misses it desperately, because everything was simpler and brighter. She wonders if he misses it too. “Hey… ever wanna go back?”
“May as well.” She closes her eyes, allowing herself a sigh of relief. Strix is an older model, still deadly but packing nowhere near the firepower of the Jericho model. Small miracles. She’ll take it.
“Mark VI will be at the balcony in thirty seconds, ma’am.”
Her hand touches his back. “James, you with me?”
His head swims. His vision doubles, blurs together, doubles again. He reaches out to swipe at the buttons, but they’re too far away and his fingers miss. His left knee gives out, then his right. He falls heavily to the floor, drowning in the air and fading out of consciousness again.
Sometimes, Steve wonders if he actually came out of the ice at all.
- "understand/do you understand (me)"
He’s heard the stories, passed down in his family, rumors and legends of famous semi-mythical triads in history.
She hasn’t forged anything by hand since Afghanistan, when she built the Mark I armor from discarded scrap and scavenged missile housing. She hadn’t even allotted space for a smithy in the building’s plans. But money talks, and Stark money talks the loudest and when she felt the itch to put hammer to steel, to work out her aggravations in the clang and ring of metal on metal, she had a forge in a couple of hours.
Here… Here, there is no safe space. She has to be
“Jesus,” she says, as she presses a hand to her racing heart, fingers splayed against her arc reactor, and turns around. “I have a fucking heart condition, Rhodey. Warn me if you’re bringing company so I don’t keel over and die, would you?”
He opens his mouth to turn and ask.
She tries to go to her lessons and tolerate the stifling clothing and the choking makeup and the pointless instructions on how to make small talk. She tries, because the last time she threw a tantrum and refused to go, Howard got a
Gorillaz, “Feel Good Inc.”
“Toni?” he whispers, hoarse and huge-eyed, and his hands fist at his side until his nails are biting into his palm and the sound of metallic stress is all he can hear.
“Eyes open,” he says into the comm, turning left and right and readying himself to move in any direction the second she reappears or one of his own turns on them. “Kobik’s here and in a snit. Watch your backs.”
He hurries into clothes, ignoring the wet towel that slides from his hips, ignores the fact that he’s still dripping from the shower. He tears the room apart in short order, thinking maybe he put it somewhere else, but it’s nowhere to be found. He stands in the middle of the room for a long moment, anxiety a thump under his lungs, trying to remember the last time he saw it, if he brought it to the beach and somehow left it there, if someone could have crept in and stolen it while he was gone.
Bucky’s down in the gym, sinking punches into the heavy bag and burning off nervous energy while he waits for Toni to come home with their registry cards, when everything goes to shit.
She swipes at the air, pulling up a holoscreen and opening a channel direct to Coulson, who is still at the Manor directing cleanup and security operations. “Any word on when we might be able to come to the manor, boss? There's shit I need there.”
, he thinks wildly.
“Fuck, fuck, fuck.” Her bloody hand is on the security keypad when she hears him hit the floor behind her. Footsteps thunder towards her. She wants to look, refuses to look. Punches
near Tash’s league. “There’s no hidden agenda here, Stark,” she says. “They’re sensitive contracts. Top-clearance, eyes-only.”
. It’s obvious from the way his eyes bounce back and forth between them like he’s watching a tennis match, the increasingly ashen hue of his skin, the increasingly horrified widening of his eyes.
God, it’s all catching up to her now, and she sags drunkenly before forcing her knees to straighten. “So what?” she snarls, but most of her fire is out. It’s a fraction of her previous conviction. “I’m not just going to sit on my ass and twiddle my thumbs while we wait!”
There are days when Phil wishes he’d taken a different career track. It’s not that he has regrets, exactly, but sometimes he thinks it would be nice to not be the one left holding the bag when everything goes pear-shaped.
is he?”
“I’ll adjust your medication,” Fennhoff says, and Steve hears him move to the IV stand beside his bed, sloshing of liquids. A little tiny voice from deep inside his mind is screaming and howling and clawing:
She drifts. Floats away. Sinks like a stone. Deep down into the cold, drowning dark.
pissed
“You’re all sloppy,” Natasha says, tucking her feet up onto the cushion beside her. “Carol and Rhodey might have won, but it was by a very slim margin. And Clint’s right, it was an unfair setup. You two,” she says with a nod, to indicate Carol and Rhodey, “are used to working together. You and Bucky,” she shifts her glance to Clint, “aren’t, though you learned pretty quickly. I’m going to keep changing things around, get different combinations used to working together.”
Steve lays a hand on what’s left of the healing pod, trying to wrap his head around the security feeds he’s been shown. Tony, peaceful and comatose, the same as he’s been for months, until he smirks and bursts into bright, orange-gold flames. The agents rushing in with fire extinguishers, technicians in jumpsuits and doctors in white lab coats racing to save Tony from the fire.
He hesitates, tilts his head at her, gaze dark and far away for a moment. She’s pretty sure she knows what he’s going to ask, and she has a perfectly genuine smile ready for him when he does. “You mind if I bunk in with Stevie?”
streamlined and streaking towards the ground, but when he says
She doesn’t open her eyes, just stays sprawled in the chair as her door opens and the rapid clicking of Pepper’s heels cross the floor. “Pep, I’m breaking up with you,” she calls out. “These last six months together have been absolute misery, and we’re just not working out. I’m going back to Clint, who doesn’t make me sign endless amounts of paperwork.”
С любовью - "with love"
“I made double fudge brownie cake,” says a new, female voice, and Toni jerks in surprise. The torch flies out of her hand, automatically shutting off the second her finger leaves the trigger, and only Rhodey’s quick catch saves it from bouncing off into the darker corners of the workshop.
“Another few feet, ma’am,” JARVIS says, and Bucky’s got enough experience sussing out the AI’s various tones and moods to hear the utter alarm in the smooth cadence. “You’ve reached the workshop. I’ve unlocked the doors, and DUM-E is en route from the flight deck to bring you the old reactor.”
“You don't need enabling,” Natasha replies. “You have those sorts of ideas all on your own, with no help needed from me.”
He squints up at the building again, grimacing at the glare of sunrise off the multitudinous panes of glass making up most of the structure’s exterior. He sighs, squares his shoulders, adjusts the button holding his jacket closed over his waist, and reaches back into Lola to collect the sealed file folder sitting on her passenger seat.
She sips her coffee again, enjoying the heat spread through her body, props her chin on her hand, watches the others act like Christmas came early.
Her brain is a slurry of post-coital mush and drifting, dreamy thoughts that basically start with
Toni is bent over his new arm on the bench beside the chair, doing her final checks and making sure that the SHIELD agents that ferried it and the rest of Toni's very long, long list of equipment from the Manor didn't fuck it up. The team is vouched for by Coulson, but Toni isn't taking any chances. Bucky can't blame her. Even though it's been the same four agents moving boxes and machines, making more than a dozen trips back and forth under the flinty, watchful gazes of Black Widow and Hawkeye, Bucky doesn't trust any of them to play things straight.
Tony bites his tongue. He bites his tongue
Toni cuts the jets, kicks herself right way up, and burns her stabilizers hard in the span of a second. She comes to a screeching halt in mid-air, right between vehicle two and three. She flips her hands up, repulsors whining to life, and blows the back doors clean off of van number two.
Fucking Steve.
“Hi there!” Toni chirps as she straightens up, and the warm-up whine of her repulsor ports underscore the guitars as they cut dead. “I’m Iron Maiden. You may have heard of me. You have something that belongs to me. And I’m here to take it back.”
"So here’s your one and only warning: You two will get your shit together and you will fucking keep it together. She deserves far better than either of you will ever be, but you are who she’s stuck with. And you will
The white star limned in blue is loud and accusing between them, and he hates that he can’t look away from it.
Toni, Christ. You and Steve, man. You could both give complete fucking speeches with your facial tics.”
“Totally valid,” she says honestly, and plops back down on the couch. She peels the lid off the container and flings it across the room before shoving the spoon in. “Jesus, now I really need the ice cream. Why the hell would you even ask something like that?”
Tony rolls over, flying with his back to the wind for a moment, and smirks at the Hawkeyes’ quinjet. Kate tips him a merry wave through the windshield, and he returns the salute. “I’m not going to try and micromanage,” Tony says, and hears someone, Quill maybe, snort across the comm channel in disbelief. “Shut it, Star-Lord,” he says. “I have no details as to what we’re walking into here. Flying into. Whatever. The entire Helicarrier crew and SHIELD staff might have been co-opted by Kobik. It might be just Cap on board who’s a secret Nazi.”
“Peggy,” he says, staring at the snow and ice stretching as far as the eye can see around him,  and feels the rightness of it settle along his tired limbs and heavy soul, “this is my choice.”
“That is within my parameters, Captain. I am happy to assist.”
For the first time in his life, both of Steve’s soulmarks are quiet, happy pulses in his chest, and the feeling is indescribable. He can’t remember the last time he was ever in this good a mood, practically bouncing between the stalls and tables stacked high with produce and homemade goods. It’s nice to be able to be in a crowd without anyone noticing he’s here.
“In a manner of speaking,” Tony replies, then sighs. “It might be more accurate to say I
Fuck, he really should have tried harder to sleep. Hovering on the verge of homicide, he thinks, is not an appropriate mindset for watching one’s soulmate undergo some vaguely-explained medical procedure that’s supposed to cut her healing time to a bare fraction of what it would otherwise have taken. Bucky can smell the
yet.”
“Quite, ma’am. Agent Coulson has requested I add a meeting to your schedule for 1pm, topics to be discussed will include the SHIELD assault on the Manor property. Ms. Potts would like a conference call when you have a free moment.”
Another unseen hand caresses his cheek. “You’re not alone,” says a hauntingly familiar, feminine voice in his other ear. “Never alone, Steve.”
A low, rich chuckle announces the arrival of Steve, and Bucky throws him another smirk over his shoulder. “You don’t ever have to say anything, Buck,” he says easily, shaking his head with a grin of his own, and stoops to tighten the laces on his sneakers. “We don’t even need a bond to read your mind.”
Sometimes, he misses the ice. After two days of answering questions and authorizing accesses and giving permission for people to start moving in, and dealing with SHIELD via Coulson, in between sitting with his soulmates who are not conveniently placed in the same room, he’s more than ready to climb in the chair, have this whole fucking week wiped right out, and curl up for a few years of undisturbed rest.
. He growls, broken and guttural, kisses her like he’s trying to crawl inside her mouth, swallowing her noises. He’s not going to last long, the pressure’s already building in his balls, and he desperately tries to fight it back. He wants to see her come first, shake apart, slam into her while her world explodes.
Abruptly, she turns and slams her hands onto the top of her work bench, the half-finished arm  rattling. Her shoulders hunch, heave with deep, shaky, angry breaths. Bucky stares at her back, mute and wretched. Shame and self-loathing make a sick swirl in his gut, and he wants nothing more than to find a dark hole to crawl in and die.
Instead, he goes through a mental exercise to suppress the spike of anger, shock, disbelief, everything else that gets in the way of him protecting his people, and merely raises his eyebrow. “What do you mean, you lost Captain America? When did you
in the corridors, for chrissake.
“... hotel sucks,” she rasps, and her eyes drift closed again. “Bed’s flat. Room s’rvice sucks. Gimme m’money back.”
His ears roar with dull noise, and he shoves away from the table violently, suddenly overcome with the need to pace. Heedless of the fact that he’s just silenced the discussion, uncaring that all eyes are on him, he stalks towards the window at the other end of the room.
Pep. What ever happened to your hardcore ‘I don’t care if I ever meet my soulmate, I’m too busy to bond with them’ attitude?”
Captain America?”
She doesn’t miss the violent flinch at the mention of her injuries, and the mental bulb clicks on. Ah. Right. “I’m too tired to have the conversation about who’s at fault for us slugging the shit out of each other,” she says, and crawls onto the mattress, burrowing under the sheets. “But suffice to say it's not you, it's Hydra. But we’ll talk about that in the morning, okay?”
Bemused by the politeness, enraged by the sight, he lets his body uncoil in a fluid push forward, hauling the shield off his back and onto his arm in time to drive it into Iron Man’s chest. The suit staggers back a pace, heavy feet digging grooves into the floor. Before he can recover, Steve launches another flurry of heavy strikes designed to tear the armor apart, slicing into joints and seams with the edge of the shield.
She arches an eyebrow, and relaxes back in the chair, swinging it from side to side. “How much of that did you see and/or overhear?”
have again. She
He’s already in Steve’s mind, already knows this was a trap. He doesn’t care as much as he should, because this trap works both ways. Just as much to his advantage as it is to Steve’s, maybe even more so. He only gets split seconds to read intent in Steve’s thoughts before they become actions, but Tony’s brain doesn’t need longer than split seconds to make all his calculations.
fucked up, knows that she’s taken a whole lot of shit from him and his bad days, taken it with a smile and compassion and a gentle touch... but this has just shoved her
Steve knows he's going to have to move very carefully with Tony, because Tony might not always see things that should be obvious, but he has a distinctly uncanny ability to make massive leaps of logic from small, disconnected, inconsequential things to comprehension and realization when it's exactly the least advantageous for the other side he does so.
He makes it into the kitchen before JARVIS greets him. “Welcome back, Captain Rogers. Did you acquire everything you need?”
Toni’s sitting cross-legged on the floor, surrounded by physical blueprints and holographic sketches, intently watching one screen that shows security footage of black-clad raiders, her hands buried in the blue-glowing guts of a 3D model of what looks like a turret.
Which is when an actual fist throwing an actual punch smacks into the side of his head, sends him reeling into Simmons, who yelps and goes down in a tangle of arms and legs. A thick-necked goon in black tactical gear steps out of the hallway, rubbing his hand. Looks at her and grins, as she’s momentarily wide-eyed in shock. Steps behind her and grabs her around the chest, bear-hugging her from behind.
“Done, ma’am. Shall I integrate the protocols into my programming?”
Toni presses a hand to her chest, mouth a perfectly round O of surprise. She's not stupid. Her brain makes the leap, intuits the connection. Under her fingertips, the red star, which has always been a spot of chill in her skin she can't shake, is warm and alive.
“My name is Steve Rogers,” he says slowly to the mirror, and watches his own face for whatever reactions he has. Waits for the disconnected feeling. Doesn’t get it. He nods to himself. “My birthday is July 4, 1987.” A twinge of unease at the year, not the date. He makes a mental note. “I am a captain in the US Army.” Seems to be true. “I am Captain America.” Also seems to be true. No dissonance there. “I am the successor to Chester Phillips…”
about that.
“What?” she barks, hand white-knuckling on the spoon. “You’re freaking me out. What is it?”
She slides her foot back, letting muscle memory take over to set her body for whatever he’s going to do next. She dodges to the left as he throws a punch with his right hand, her arms automatically in motion to deflect his rising knee strike with her crossed wrists.
The villain cannot be allowed to live. He's broken out of five prisons in ten years, and each time, innocent people got in his way and ended up either injured or dead.
Rhodey's got her. She's half-delirious from heat-stroke and dehydration, thin and still racked with the cold she could never properly shake, not with expired meds and filthy water. Pain's a constant ache in her chest, her hands, her legs, her belly, her head. Screams and curses in half a dozen languages still ring in her ears. Her nostrils are full of smoke and fire and wet dank rock, hot metal and battery acid, and the disturbingly delicious smell of roasting human flesh. Skin burning, peeling, cracking, searing away after days in the desert sun.
She’s been flying for awhile now, nothing but sky above her and sea below her, the best kind of wide-open space to put the suit through its paces. Once the California coastline is at her back, she opens up, full-throttle and spends the next hour doing loops and barrel rolls, tight corkscrews and hairpin turns, bursts of acceleration and sharp, abrupt braking, doing her level best to make the system redline, stall, cough and die.
He learns that everyone takes a turn cooking, and learns that after a couple of weeks, he’s included in the roster on the nights when they’d previously ordered takeout Chinese or pizza or picked up Thai from the deli Natasha likes. He learns that he likes cooking, once he can make himself get started. Learns that he’s good at it. Learns that he’s probably the best cook out of the lot of them.
“You can’t fight your way out,” says a gruff voice over her shoulder, and Toni leaps nearly out of the suit. She unlocks the elbow of her armor, dumps the Winter Soldier onto the floor, dances back into a defensive position.
“That's not really my problem. You say you can work with Stark? Be my guest. I wish you much joy in it. She wants a new liaison, you just volunteered.” Fury opens a desk drawer, pulls out a stack of file folders tied together, and drops them on his desk. “She’s all yours. Just don't come crying to me in a week's time if you can't stop her from taking over the whole damn world with her AIs.”
knot would be more secure, for fuck's sake!”
Toni fires her boot jets, sudden and powerful, and flings her arms upward. Her attacker is solid and heavy, but the suit augments her strength. The throw, augmented by the momentum from the jets, slams her attacker head-first into the ceiling.
He snorts, picks up the pace a few steps just to see if she notices. “Yeah, if you think that’s a thing I’m gonna stop doing at some point, sorry to disappoint, but at least one of us has gotta have a lick of sense in our heads. It’s clearly not gonna be you or Stevie.”
give you data.”
It doesn’t.
The first time he opens his eyes, everything is wrong. It’s too bright, too clean, too sleek and shiny. It smells wrong, it sounds wrong, the air is too cold on his skin, the sheets too smooth. There are distant voices murmuring, squeaking shoes on linoleum, steady soft beeping. None of it is right. It’s all
She shrugs, doesn’t lose her smile. “You’re a grown-ass man, James,” she says easily. “You want to sit beside me, I’m seriously all for that, but nobody owns you anymore, so you sit wherever you want.” Her hand drifts along his back as she moves around him. “I’m going to go put on another pot of coffee. Do you want some?”
Toni blasts them, full strength. Reaches down, snaps the poles, lifts James by the ropes around his chest, tucks him against her side and locks the elbow joint to keep him securely in place. Feels the frantic, maddening itch behind her eyes, the one calling for blood and death, ebb a little.
“It happened in combat,” says Carol, clipped and short. “I’m not giving you details.”
“Yeah. So why can’t she have just one fucking thing, just
Toni keeps staring at him, can’t process the sheer volume of thoughts storming through her head. “You know what, Phil. You’re a good man. J, add Agent Coulson to the list of protected persons if a Red Queen situation should ever arise.”
, Stark!” he yells back, and his hands flex on her shoulders like he desperately wants to shake her. “You are so far out of touch with reality, you’re having conversations with people who aren’t fuckin’ there! Don’t tell me you’re fine! I
“I don’t know,” Toni mutters, hands strangling the wheel in effigy of his neck.
Tony turns around and there’s Steve, an arguably violent shade of red and his eyes looking everywhere but at Tony’s face, as anxious in appearance as that timid tone suggests.
Bucky paces restlessly beside her, because he’s figured out by now that she can’t see or hear him, and he snarls in frustrated helplessness. “Get up, Toni,” he says, skids to his knees beside her. Can’t stop himself for reaching out to touch her, try to shake her awake, try to bully and manhandle her back up. “Get the fuck off the floor already. You’re stronger than this. You don’t die here, not like this.”
-----
hair out of her eyes. She grimaces, feeling the tack of blood cracking on her face. “Okay, more like six or seven times. You never seem to remember, though.”
He can’t have heard her right. “I… What? Even after all that?”
Whee! Lots of negotiation and stuff here!
To Rhodey’s credit, he doesn’t bat an eye at her dramatic declaration. He doesn't even look up from his computer. “So you’ve said,” he says absently, fingers dancing on the keys. “I’ve yet to see supporting evidence, though. Don’t you call yourself a scientist? Also, I think you’re drunk.”
Toni’s mouth curves up on one side, because she can’t help it. “Plus, Clint and Tash keep you up to date on how I’m doing like the nosy little busybodies that they are.”
“She had no driving reason to just jump in, steady you, keep me from going off my fucking nut. She just did it, because she loves me. Because I needed it. Because she has my fucking back. And now, she’d do the same for you. Cos she loves you. That goddamn arrogant, crazy woman has a heart of fucking gold, but nobody gets to see it because if they did, they’d try to rip it out of her fucking ribcage.”
Machine guns bristle from the van three’s windows, and Toni throws herself in front of James instinctively, pulling him in and down to shield  him with the bulk of the armor. The HUD registers multiple impacts, flashing reminders about structural integrity.

“Give me options, J.”
“I’ve gotten a hint or two of that, yes.”
It’s awkward and fumbling, feet skidding on the wet shower floor. Toni screeches like a cat when her back hits the cold tile wall, twisting hard enough to jar her hip. Bucky overbalances trying to lift her with one arm, tries to correct and bangs his temple into the showerhead, swears mightily. Somehow, they manage to not kill themselves as they scramble and slip, end up sprawled on the shower floor, her legs around his hips, his hand splayed across her back, her fingers threaded through her hair, joined together and laughing their asses off with the water pounding down on them.
“Let’s get you started then,” Steve says, tone just a few notes lower than normal and hand still resting on Tony’s trembling fingers. “I’ll be in the next room. An aide’s been waiting in there for me for the last ten minutes, and they only do that when it’s important.”
“Don’t touch the lady,” comes Clint’s easy drawl from somewhere behind her, and Toni’s knees want to buckle with relief. “She’s got a nasty bite when you piss her off, and you don’t look current on your rabies shots.”
“Stark, do you trust me?”
She shrugs. “Live a little. Go for both.”
“Yes, ma’am. Shall I also upgrade the others’ permissions to levels more appropriate to their new roles as Avengers?”
she’s laughing out loud and dancing backwards, hands in defensive fists in front of her. Steve’s eying her and rubbing his shoulder briefly where her kick landed. “You’re just full of surprises, aren’t you?” he says, wry but pleased.
Another wave, twelve this time. The gun in his right hand clicks empty after three shots. The gun in his left spits out six before the slide locks. They become projectiles, one crunching into a masked face, another embedding itself halfway through another’s head. The last enemy standing goes down fighting, ends up halfway through the wall between the hallway and Clint and Natasha’s bedroom.
Comes back to himself an indeterminate amount of time later, trussed up with heavy cuffs and rope, in the back of a van that’s moving at highway speeds. There’s a bald man wearing a neat, three-piece suit and glasses sitting on a bench near the front, behind the two bucket seats. Two more of those black-clad fuckers are between him and Baldy, holding white poles.
He’s not sure if this is behaviour his therapist would call “health-oriented” or “survival-oriented”. He’s not sure he really cares about the difference right now. All he knows is that it’s helping him find some sort of path through hell, and he isn’t going to give it up any time soon.
“Morning, J,” she says, yawning. “What’s the day looking like?”
“What, the texting, or me and Clint? Actually, doesn’t matter. We’ve been doing that since we first got together, so...Thirteen years? Yeah.”
“That’s it,” Toni says sourly, trying to scrape the taste off her teeth with a bottle of water Helen hands her, “appeal to my love of efficiency. Pepper’s been teaching you her tricks.”
There’s no response.
Natasha is smiling, and Clint’s snort is muffled in her shoulder. Toni is lost. “...no?”
He's lost at sea here, has been since the moment he woke up. Here, on the Moon, in the den of the Tower after he crash-landed back down to earth. For a moment, he’d let himself think that everything could just go on the same as it had before, that despite his changes, Steve was unchanged and together, maybe they’d figure out a solution to this weird twist in Tony’s life.
“It doesn’t work,” he mutters.
They fed her bare minimum, and shit food at that. She was sick most of the time in that fucking cave, too. And she had the reactor in her chest. I mean, I honestly thought she was going to die in the evac chopper. But she held on until we got her to Ramstein Air Base. Took four weeks of constant IV nutrients to begin unfucking the damage. Nearly a year before she was anywhere near herself again.” Clint’s looking down at Toni again. “
The window balloons up to nearly life-size. Steve, with the shield, frozen in mid-leap, his face a rictus of hate, jumping at Iron Maiden, who has her hands up and is falling backwards.
Thor looks troubled, and Tony sighs, because if there’s one person he thought he’d have to work the least on convincing, it was her. “It is difficult to believe,” she says doubtfully, cupping her chin pensively in one hand. “I have seen many an oddity not easily explained, friend Stark, but this stretches credulity, possibly to the breaking point.”

Unexpectedly, Coulson’s arm comes up, finger poking a spot along the coastline a few inches ahead of where the blinking dot is. “There’s a black site there,” he says. “SHIELD acquired it from the army after General Ross’s supersoldier program was mothballed. It’s rated for Hulk containment. That’s the most likely spot.” Toni stares at him. He just smiles faintly back at her. “You’d find it eventually,” he says. “This just saves everyone some time.”
He laughs when Clint just gives him a flat look and pings his bottle cap off Tony's forehead. “Seriously, Stark. Why are you here? We haven't spoken since the trial. And you weren't particularly friendly then.”
“Good kid, J. Mom’s proud.” She flicks her right hand to the right, separating the two different programs she’s been working on, scanning over both of them with a hand rubbing her chin. “Check my code for errors, would you?”
Yet here he goes again, taking a deep breath, opening Steve’s door, stepping inside. Moving quietly to the chair beside the bed Steve is curled up in, broad shoulders hunched and tall length curled around his stomach.
Clint’s eyes are dark and pained. “I couldn’t even tell you, Toni. I’m still trying to wrap my brain around the fact that Jasper fucking Sitwell, who I’ve had dinner with, run ops with, sat and shot the shit with, sent more’n fifty STRIKE members into our goddamn home and attacked us. It was authorized from somewhere, cos that much paperwork? Yeah. Someone had to rubber-stamp it somewhere. It’s just not Fury’s style, though. And
“Never even a question,” Clint says, and his gaze isn't readable in the slightest. But there's faint challenge in his voice when he adds, “As long as it's what she wants.”
“Not what I meant.” The red star pulses again. She closes her eyes, recenters her fading thoughts. Opens her eyes. Tries again. “Do you know who I am to
She flips the cover shut and props her chin on her hand, picking up her scotch with the other hand, and stares out the porthole as the plane begins its final approach. One more meeting, one more presentation, one more schmoozefest with military brass, and she gets to go home and shut down the last weapons factory, sell the surplus components to the government for their next warmongering contractor, and get back to her
“Oh damn,” she breathes softly, and her eyes feel like they’re taking up half her face, they’re so wide. The aura of confidence and command he radiates is alluring, so alluring she nearly swears right then and there to follow him into the mouth of hell without stopping for
“Morgan,” she says, not even
He learns to tolerate Clint’s biting remarks, slowly relearns his own sharp humor in response. Learns about Toni’s quick wit and Natasha’s deadpan delivery, so dry it’s hard to tell sometimes when she’s joking and when she’s not.
, express gratitude. Toni’s eyes well up, and she sniffles as tears stream down her face. God, she’s so tired, and she desperately needs to sleep, but she lays one hand gently on top of the boxy server wired to her laptop, cradling the corner as gently as the skull of a newborn, and cries happily.
until he’s yelling something wordless and enraged, because it’s either that, or the pressure pounding behind his eyeballs explodes through his skull.
He feels her drop a kiss onto the top of his head, distractedly leans in her general direction. She sets down a case beside him, flips the catches, opens it so he can see the maintenance equipment inside. “I knew I forgot something,” she says, clucking her tongue. “Shoulder-mounted heavy artillery. Ah well. Guess you’re just going to have to keep tolerating me until I can make you one. You gonna be occupied for awhile?”
Paula's smile widens. “She hasn't beheaded anyone yet this week. I'd take that as a good sign.”
“Which is why I---

the reason that happened. I understand if you feel that it was still worth it, but from where I’m standing, it doesn’t look anything at all like that.”
“Pretty much all of it.” He shrugs out of the jacket, stretches it over the desk, and starts brushing the lint off the back. “Why?”
before.”
“Mmmph.” With effort, she raises her head so she can look him in the eye. “What’re we doing out here, Steve?” she says, husky and deep, and a thrill shoots through her at the way his eyes darken. “There’s a perfectly good bed inside.”
let alone the armor
James’ head jerks at the word
Steve takes a last, wistful look at the market, promising himself
Toni has spent a large chunk of her life making sure she avoids spending time with Morgan Stark. Her cousin, the son of one of Howard’s aunts, is shallow and vain, concerned with himself first and no one else second. He has the dark charm of the Starks, slick black hair and carefully shaped vandyke, sharp blue eyes and expensive, tailor-fit clothing, but he lacks intelligence, cleverness and any actual personality. He is, in Toni’s opinion, an utter waste of oxygen.
She’s always been good at making leaps of intuition and logic that others can’t follow. This one isn’t exactly hard to connect. SHIELD’s been keeping her busy, keeping her distracted, so they can go after James.
He knows the hook’s been set when Tony beams at him, his face lighting up with gratitude. “Yeah, Steve. That’d be great. I really appreciate this.”
“Of course, ma’am. Captain Rogers requests that you meet him in the courtyard prior to entering the flight bay.”
“Three,” Toni says, holds out her hand. She’s never been more sure of anything in her life. “Us three.”
Her eyes open, dazed and lost and gorgeous, focus on him, jolts him from coiling need right to the edge. “I love you,” she rasps shakily. And
He removes his hand from the pod, and swipes it down his face. He might have the serum back to full strength, but he still feels like he’s pushing a century in age some days. “Are you sure there’s been no sign of Phoenix Force activity?”
“How bad is she?” Steve asks tightly. “How badly did I hurt her?”
She doesn’t do romance and love and expressions of affection. She prefers loyalty and respect, devotion to hard-forged bonds. Still, she knows that, if it were at all possible to force it into existence, she’d already have given Clint Toni’s mark, be wearing Toni’s mark herself, and have her comfortable partnership with Clint a full-blown metaphysical triad instead.
“Huh.” He blinks, reflects, and shrugs. He’s strangely okay with it.
Toni closes her eyes and leans her forehead against the smooth, cool metal of his shoulder. “Then it's functionally dead,” she says. “If Hydra gave half as much of a shit about their craftsmanship as they do their convoluted evil plots, the EMP disk wouldn’t have even dinged the paint job.”
She doesn’t even feel guilty. She should, and it’s just a little worrisome, but she can’t find it in her heart to care too much.
By the time the hum of the cradle shuts off, Toni’s sitting up and drinking her second bottle of Helen Cho’s nutrient-bomb concoction, which she is told contains about five times the daily recommended intake of all nutrients and proteins. It’s thick and green and tastes like it was brewed in Toni’s workshop mini-fridge, the one with the semi-sentient Chinese takeout. But she drinks them, because the first bottle takes the edge off the hunger, and the second reduces it down from starvation pangs to a feeling of
The man doesn’t look like he understands what just happened. His eyes are baffled, uncertain. Swiftly, he sets her on her feet and takes a step back, eyes still boring into hers. Then, he turns to disappear into the bushes again. Toni’s too shocked, too shocky, to say or do anything to stop him. He’s fast as well as silent, but not swift enough to stop Toni from catching a glimpse of the design on his metal arm. A star. A red star. On a silver arm.
Bucky’s hand is tight in her left, Steve’s enveloping her right, and their linked hands together across from her, and no one is letting go. And Steve is staring at her with the same expression of reverence he wore when they completed their bond, and Bucky’s face is soaked with tears, and the wind whispering in from the infinite, dark Pacific beyond the balcony is chill against her own wet cheeks.

“Of course, sir.” JARVIS, ever unruffled, doesn’t even hesitate before he continues with, “You have been tagged over six thousand times alongside mentions of Captain Rogers genitalia. What would you like done with—“
He’s just glad JARVIS’d been more than happy to help him make arrangements, because Bucky would otherwise still be helplessly scrolling through date idea websites, trying to figure out what to do.
Tony throws up his hands. “Fine. Whatever you say, Barton. Fair warning though. If I end up in a coma again, or worse, I’m haunting your ass for eternity.”
“I can do that too,” Steve says, and brushes his thumb across Tony’s cheek, just under his eye. “None of it matters. Not now, not anymore. I’m tired of what ifs and regrets. Aren’t you?”
He shrugs. “You shouldn’t have to change who you are for me. He, they make you happy. Who’m I to get in the way of that? I’m not threatened, not anymore, anyway. Either I trust you, or I’m an insecure jackass. Kinda tired of being the last one.”
He can hear the music a flight of stairs up, loud and throbbing and a little more vulgar than he's really comfortable with. He knows he’s missed a lot, but he has no idea how music went from singing about love and the brassy melodies of jazz and big band to growling about violence and calling women bitches.

Fennhoff isn’t alone. With him is a thin, white-haired man in a grey suit and black, round glasses. They both turn as the door opens, watch him come in. Familiarity stirs beneath the placid surface of his thoughts, a nagging feeling he’s seen this man before.
She gives him a look, patented Toni Stark exasperation, though she’s not sure her eyes are focusing properly. “I’m not drunk and I’m not twelve. I’m not calling you
He’s leaning against the side of the desk with one hip, absently swirling the ice around his glass, and watching her with hooded eyes. His posture screams of long familiarity with using his size to intimidate people, and she takes the cue, hunching back into the chair.
Toni throws her hands up in exasperation. “Fine, you want me to say it? Yeah, it was great. I appreciate the backup, Phil. Wish it could happen like that every time.” She drops her hands onto her face and rubs tiredly. “But that isn’t going to happen. My life doesn’t work like that, and you know it. It never has. I don’t get to have cooler heads prevail. I don’t get to have angels on my shoulder telling me how lethal I can be. I don’t get the voice of God in my ear, the one I know I can trust to make the right call. It’s just me. And sometimes Clint and sometimes Tash, and sometimes JARVIS, but it’s mostly just me, me, me, and I have to do it all on my own, crunch everything, second-guess everything, try not to fuck up, try not to die, try not to climb into a bottle when I get home and my brain won’t shut off and--”
when he needs some goddamn quiet. Experience with Extremis and electronic white noise only goes so far in his self-taught psychic shielding, after all, and so many thoughts screaming at him in the awkward physical silence is giving him a migraine the size of Reed Richards' ego.
“Shut up, Tony,” Steve murmurs, and tilts his head down as a hand comes up to cradle the back of Tony’s head. “And just let me kiss you.”
There's a pause. “For the same reason,” JARVIS says firmly, “I refer to ma’am as ‘ma’am’.”
Slowly, cautiously, she lowers her arms back down and, because she’s her and because it’s happened before, she wonders exactly what absolute
The hallway is endless, she thinks, as she crawls down it at a pace a snail would think is slow. Eventually, she hears the faint sound of voices speaking. She flattens herself again, this time into a convenient patch of shadow, as the speakers come around the corner and into view.
Toni snorts, and casually flips him off when he pauses to throw her his most charming smile. “I can't keep up with super soldiers going balls out, true,” she says with a smirk. “Which is why you are both going to slow your magnificent asses to my speed. Or, at the very least, keep said asses where I can comfortably leer at them as we go.”
and promising she is brilliant and telling her not to listen to her father, who is only a man, after all, and a very silly man at that.
Most of the others seem inclined to leave him alone, which suits him fine. He’s not an unsociable kind of guy, he normally loves talking to people and getting to know them, and this seems like a fine group. But the anger churning in his gut is a constant companion, one he has tenuous control over. Half the time, he feels like a bomb ticking down with indecipherable numbers, like he should be treated gingerly and with an eye to getting out of the way for the inevitable explosion.
This is not a nice world. It's a world filled with opportunistic neofascists and paranoid patriots. It's a world with mind control and experimental superhuman experimentation and torture and pain. It's a world where aliens can pour out of the sky because a petulant demigod has Daddy issues. It's a world where death happens on a startlingly regular basis. Where normal people might get a break, but exceptional people who suit up and go out to fight do not have easy lives.
Toni chokes. Flails. Reels. Sees stars. Clint, alarmed, thumps her on the back until she remembers how to breathe.
“Toni,” he chokes, forehead rolling against hers. He palms her ass, readjusts her position until the head of his cock is nudging her entrance. Then he snaps his hips forward, sinking all the way in with a single thrust. Wet, velvet heat engulfs him.“Oh, fucking Christ,” he says, squeezing his eyes shut and feeling sweat pop on his forehead.
"G'night, Rhodey." She quells the guilt and tries to feel like she didn't just lie. It's a lost cause, because she's pretty sure she's never going to be ready. Because she's done her research and she has a pretty solid idea of what the white star edged in blue is supposed to mean.
“Alright,” she says, feeling more than hearing the whine of repulsors powering up. “Let’s see what this baby’s packing. Don’t go easy on me, kid.”
“Jesus fucking Christ, you gave me a heart attack!” She thuds her forehead into his chest, feeling silent laughter shake through his ribs. Her mouth curves up despite her racing pulse. “It's not funny, goddammit. I need to put a fucking bell on you.”
She forgets that the shield can bounce. She remembers when it rings off the wall to her left, and slams into her left shoulder. Something pops, white-hot pain screams through her body, and she hits the ground, hard.
“Do it,” she says. Sees Coulson eying her. Will deal with that later. A holo screen appears, frozen on the image of a blonde woman with a bun and terribly tacky black glasses.
Toni runs her tongue over her lips, guilt surging unpleasantly in her stomach. “I seem to be okay now, though,” she says tentatively, though how that's possible, she has no earthly idea. She looks around, squinting through the unhappy throb of her eyeballs and the dark of the room. “I mean, this is my room in the manor, so it can't be that bad, or you'd have me in the hospital.”
“Jesus fuckin’ Christ,” he says hoarsely, as fire and acid shriek through his nerves again. He wants to scream, thinks he might have been since his throat is so raw and Toni’s face is so pale and tight, but swallows it back. “How much longer?”
Natasha does remember, and she smiles. “And their response?”
For the record: I am polyamorous myself. I attempted to write in a poly-realistic manner, as I perceive it to be. In a universe with multiple soulmates possible, poly kinda goes with the territory. Things get terribly blown out of proportion really easily without communication, though. They really, really do.
Tony has to laugh when a chorus of exasperated “
She glances at the clock, and grinds her teeth when she realizes it's almost four o’clock. Long past the time she wanted to be wrapping up and heading home. Carter's got a whole fucking pile of folders, though, and seems prepared to keep going until midnight.
“You killed Peggy!” he screams. “Murderer!”
“As I recall,” Toni says primly, slips away from the circle of Bucky’s arms in a lingering fashion, and sets each hand on a hip, “you aren’t much better, despite the whole—” A hand lifts to wave vaguely at him. “—wholesome Captain America schtick. You are a filthy soul, Steven, and don’t pretend you’re not.”
“Nah.” She scratches her nose and slams down the faceplate again with a sigh. “Alright, which batch of idiots should we take out next, J? Floor number twenty six, or lucky number floor twenty seven?”
. He carries them both over to the counter silently, as she slams the fridge door closed and turns around with murder in her eye.
have to be blood, sweat and tears for her? Why can’t she just have ...something easy?”
The second, deeper impression is that this is a woman who’s been through some
Fitz does so, then gives a thumbprint and voice recognition statement when prompted for those as well. The email opens to a few lines of text, and an attachment.
Fitz is clearly over the moon when Toni tells them she’s taking them to her workshop to science the shit out of things. Get them set up with access on some of her designs, get them started to see what they’re capable of. She’s not foolish enough to let them have access to the suit right away -- Coulson might trust them, and she might have hardcore imprinted on them, but she’s not so dazzled by having actual other baby geniuses around that she’s going to toss them the keys to the kingdom on day one.
Toni stops in the middle of the hall, just past the turn-off to where she built the forge, and eyes him speculatively. He’s flushed and excited, all glittering eyes and hopeful smile. Which falters almost immediately at whatever he’s seeing on her face. “Sorry,” he mutters. “It is a bit much to ask.”
It’s creepy as
Carter doesn’t start, or jump, or look guilty, or look surprised. Her face is utterly schooled. Toni snorts to herself; a schooled expression is a tell all on its own. Carter’s good, but Toni lives full-time with the reigning empress of microexpressions. Carter’s
His enemies smarten up, come at him in numbers, six, eight, ten at a time. Knives slice his skin, electricity jitters through his nerves, the prick of two separate darts hit his shoulderblades. Blood sprays across his face, hot and fast and wet, his blades a silver whirl around him.
“--I don’t want the bitch to die, of course,” the other man is drawling, gesturing with his hands as they near her hiding place. The voice is what pulls her attention away from Red Star, because it’s Tiberius Stone, and that is so jarring and
“Certainly, Captain Rogers,” JARVIS replies pleasantly and immediately, everywhere and nowhere at once. “What may I help you with?”
and the kid.
Natasha is torn, because she understands mental conditioning, not being in control of one’s own actions, understands that it’s not really either of their faults. But she also understands that Toni’s frequency of needing medical attention is becoming untenable. If she’s being honest with herself, which is harder than it sounds, she’s surprised Clint held out this long before snapping. “Will they retaliate?”
she told herself again, and couldn’t remember if she had ever experienced scent in a dream before, but wrinkled her nose at the smell of blood and hoarfrost in the air.
“Say no more.”
- PTSD, anxiety attacks, polyamory negotiations, a partial breakdown that's been a long, long time coming. Friends telling each other harsh truths. There is angst in this chapter.
Learns that he has a place he belongs, a place he calls home.
“I’m sorry, Fury wants me to do
It’s funny, when he thinks about it, because three months ago, he was a soulless Hydra assassin with no thoughts of his own. And now he’s the goddamn adult in charge of the whole asylum, because the head lunatic had the bright idea to hand him top-access codes to the whole place, then got herself all unconscious and heavily medicated with half her body broken, bleeding or bruised.
For a moment, he doesn't know how to reply. He doesn't know if he's the Asset, the Winter Soldier, Bucky, or someone else. Panic surges, brings bile, and he swallows hard, forces it back down. “Bucky,” he says, after thinking about it for too long. “James Buchanan Barnes.”
“I believe, Dr. Simmons, that is your mandatory firearms training with Clint,” JARVIS replies promptly. “Shooting Stuff for Beginners.” A pause, and Fitz glances at Jemma just as she glances at him.
Fennhoff and Peggy exchange looks again, and irritation sparks, because he knows they’re carrying out a silent conversation he’s not privy to. “I have to tell him,” Peggy murmurs.
