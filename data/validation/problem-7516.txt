steve had told tony intently about bucky. a man who had ripped steve’s heart apart by not being gay. a man who had been his best friend since the first day of pre-k. from what steve had told him, the world would be a better place if everyone had a bucky. not even that did tony have.
so tony slid off the armchair, kneeling in front of it while steve moved to the edge. the teenager pulled steve’s pants off and found no boxers, making him look gleefully at steve before sliding him into his mouth.
the kid wrote perfectly good grades for the first few weeks of the semester, and he even shot a few smiles at steve when he saw him in the hallway. it didn’t seem to matter much to tony, he was way too busy with university.
“wasn’t on me. tony made the sauce,” he stated proudly and tony felt himself blush.
"No, I'm good."
when they were both done, tony having swallowed the load, the teenager sat back up on steve’s lap. the man was completely naked aside from his socks now. he pulled the hem of tony’s sweater up as well, looking at the thin torso in front of him with affection.
"and I don't want you to go through this alone," steve decided and tony wiped his face again.
“sounds good howard. we’d like to come along.”
“yeah. he became less and less of a dad so why would i still call him that?” tony shrugged.
steve stayed seated when his boyfriend got up, but tony pulled him up after himself. steve got the quiet link and introduced himself simply as ‘steve’ when he sat down next to tony across from dr. banner.
“i’m glad,” steve said. “and i miss you.”
“sure is. do you know what the meds are for?”
"Jarvis, where is Pops?" Peter asked when Clint had told him to sit on the couch and watch TV until Pops would come to the living room.
“why didn’t you tell me?”
“alright sarah. how are you doing?”
“the terrace must be amazing when it’s warm out,” steve added when they sat down on the couch with two glasses of wine and the rest of a way too expensive bottle on the couch table.
“maybe you should ask her for some help.”
"Why did dad leave?" Peter asked his pops with a sad voice.
he blushed before even sounding his request out. "can I sit in your lap?"
the family ate in silence for a while. “so when do we get to meet him?” howard asked then.
“i want you,” tony said and turned the shower off before steve could step in fully.
steve worked the buckle of tony’s belt as if he’d done it a million times and pulled down his boxers with one slick move before taking the tip of his dick into his mouth.
the three of them said goodbye to the millionaire who invited them back for the summer, telling tony his assistant would call him for an appointment.
the two did make a return, but it wasn’t an evil one; when tony tripped over nothing but his weak muscles, he held on to steve’s arm, who in return took his hand into his and rubbed the back of it very gently. “you okay?”
“please, call me howard or i’ll have to call you dr. rogers,” the man smiled and tony’s heart lightened.
“how long have you known the starks?” steve asked at some point because clearly, andrew was more of an uncle to tony than anything else.
the first few days of spring went by quickly, too fast for tony’s liking because he’d start treatment the week after, and his parents were arriving on sunday night, which would be the last night he could see steve for a while.
The boy was just about to turn four years old at that point, and he easily adapted to Steve being his other dad as well, no questions asked.
“no no, not at all,” tony assured. “there’s someone i want you to meet. he studied psychology at harvard and uh… we’ve been dating for a few weeks.” and now tony’s heart was beating rapidly but only until he saw howard smile at maria.
steve arrived in the elevator when the sun was starting to set.
“thank you kid. so, i figured that’s enough business this year. but you know howard, always working on his cover story.”
tony reached the lower end of average weight by dinner the night before the following semester.
the pair sat down in front of the tv and ordered some pizza for dinner. they decided to start watching back to the future because tony loved the classics and steve had to see them anyway.
He decided he'd heard enough, and left his spot in front of their door to run to his room and bawl his eyes out. It was clear to him that dad and pops were getting a divorce, why wouldn't they? It had happened to a lot of kids at his school before and just because Peter's parents were Avengers didn't mean they were any better at relationships. They were probably even worse.
it turned out that the man had studied marketing and worked at a small startup in the city but was hoping to get into a big firm someday.
the counsellor rummaged through the closet next to the bathroom door and threw a harvard alumni shirt at his boyfriend. “alright, i’ll sleep next to you,” he said with a smile and stripped down to his boxers.
“wow. this place is amazing,” the counsellor commented and tony blushed in embarrassed response.
“he hasn’t, actually. what kind of deal?” tony didn’t really care about these things, he was only being polite.
the older man looked into tony’s beautiful chocolate eyes and his heart ached at the thought of breaking this off. of not seeing the pure soul in front of him again. “oh tony i-“ he was so distracted with his thoughts that he didn’t register the boy holding his mouth closer and closer to his, or that he pressed his lips against the taller man before he could say anything else.
tony looked up at steve, for some reason not at all surprised by the tears. “sorry,” steve whispered and tony gave him a sad smile.
“please call me sarah tony, i always feel so old when beautiful young boys call me mrs.”
and tony breathed another breath of relief. “have you…” maria asked then, because they’d never had to have ‘the talk’ with tony. he’d been moved out by the time he reached that stage of puberty, and with the cancer and all there had been some things in the way.
“really? when was the last time you called him dad?”
“hi anthony, how are you?”
tony nodded and exited the shower, getting himself ready while steve washed off. “put on one of your kiddie boxers,” steve suggested through the stream of water. and so tony did; a pair of white boxers with a picture of sheriff woodie at the front.
“we’re good. listen, i’m holding a lecture at the international science and tech convention in tokyo this summer and i wanted to ask if you want to tag along. maybe bring your girlfriend too.”
“you know tony. i kind of envy you. you’re the one who gets to be gone when it’s over.”
"Yeah, she's gone."
steve chuckled a little in response but stayed quiet, even when the teenager in front of him stepped closer and continued to wipe his tears to the side.
the two had yet to have their first time together, or tony’s first time with a man after all. however, steve enjoyed this cuddling base they shared.
It had been three weeks since Peter had overheard his parents' argument, and he felt the need to save their marriage, although there was nothing to save as the two were reconciled and happy with each other.
tony booked enough classes to finish his grad degree within two semesters because he needed some sort of distraction and he felt invincible regarding his health right then.
tony finished up his sources and put his laptop away, then cuddled further into steve’s lap. “you just finished about a weeks worth of work in three hours,” steve realized out loud.
“alright,” bucky smiled and something about that told tony that he didn’t know about his health situation.
“what’s your name,” the blonde girl who finally came to a halt asked tony. “i’m adison!”
tony nodded his head yes, then got up to sit on the couch across from the two. he was becoming anxious. “we can take the lamborghini,” he said with a smile because who wouldn’t love to drive that. steve smiled, too.
Peter leaned into his Pops' side at that and watched intently as his dad started to speak, smiling up at his fathers every now and then.
“were you scared?” steve asked carefully.
the bruises on tony’s back weren’t too bad at that moment. his ribs were a bit protruding and most of the bruises formed their outline a little for even lying down in one position for too long could get tony to bruise.
“whatever it is tony, you’re very sick. i would never judge you for what happens when a treatment messes you up.”
they woke up well rested the next morning and somehow, steve’s world had regained some color overnight.
“do you like to cook?” steve asked, ready to bite down the butterflies that were fluttering up his throat like bile. cooking just sparked something in him, the thought of a man smaller than him wearing one of his button ups and making a beautiful meal.
“so are you stevie. your mom and sister adore you.”
when each got home, they both read up on whether staff and students were allowed to date.
“did you… did we?”
“that good or bad?” tony asked, his ears piping red from embarrassment.
“good, good!” steve assured.
Steve carried Peter into his bedroom, where Tony was sitting on an armchair while going through his phone, quickly distracted by the sobs emitted from his teenager.
“howard stark,” the teenager said then and took a sip from his beer.
steve stayed at tony’s apartment most of the week, and he would for longer after howard and maria were going to leave that friday afternoon.
that afternoon tony lost his virginity in one of the countless hotel rooms that lined waikiki beach. the girl’s name was olivia, and she too cried upon seeing the boy’s back after sex.
“that was…” steve started once they sat in his truck, all three at the front.
when steve saw his little crush get into said limousine before pulling out of the garage, he decided to look up tony’s student file. something had to be wrong with that kid, right?
He diverted his attention back to the screen, where his Pops had hung up the phone and was now covering his mouth with his hand, tears falling from his eyes.
tony shook his head. “no.”
they spent their day like that: watching movies, enjoying each other’s presence and physical touch although they weren’t used to these things. tony enjoyed his mom so sober and his dad so affectionate. they brought him lunch and the pill when it was time, and tony fell asleep right after.
tony was welcomed into a warm kitchen that smelled a little burnt, with a boy and a girl running around chasing a dog and an elderly woman sitting at a table visible through the door.
“do counsellors get counselling too?”
tony keeps his age a secret from steve for their first date.
“i was going to stay in new york, my parents are going to barbados.”
“oh,” tony said and took the pizza carton out of steve’s hands, placing it on the dining table before grabbing them some sodas. “don’t worry, everyone i’ve told so far didn’t let me out of their sight the first few weeks.”
Pepper had Peter put on his little suit and kept him busy, playing with him, briefing him on how he'd bring in the rings and where to stand while they were giving the vows.
steve pulled tony up by his hips so the erection sprung at him just in front of his face. he unbuckled the boy’s belt, removing his pants and briefs without commenting on the latter; they had a toy story print on them. “take care of yourself first,” steve whispered.
“yeah. likely won’t reach midlife,” steve whispered, his eyes filling with tears that he blinked right away.
“tony?” the nurse called him to his oncologist’s office. she never said his full name, the media would simply blow up if people knew who he really was.
“that’s not hard,” bucky laughed but both tony and steve could tell that he’d been surprised.
when finally the tears ceased, steve picked up the hem of his shirt and used it to wipe his face. “sorry,” he said and before he could pull the shirt back down, tony stopped him, and steve’s hands went around tony again while his torso was being admired.
“i uh…” tony leaned in against steve’s chest. “i peed blood, i have to go see my doctor first thing tomorrow morning.”
the teenager almost fucking cried when he said goodbye to steve as he left the apartment shortly before his parents’ arrival. “it’s only a few days,” steve assured. tony was sure his parents wouldn’t react badly to his coming out. he’d grown up with gay family friends and had never heard a single homophobic word out of howard and maria’s mouth, not even jokingly. they were young parents after all, barely older than steve himself. and also, with steve, the teenager had a lot to show for.
tony was given a glass of champagne while bucky and steve showered, and he updated andrew on how school was and where his parents were investing in houses for their next trips. holly snorted three lines of cocaine while the boy spoke, and none of them batted an eye at that.
“you’d do that?”
pepper potts was steve’s last appointment for the day before he’d have lunch with the starks and drop them off at the airport together with tony.
“well you dr. rogers are fucking gorgeous,” tony declared and leaned in to kiss him. “tell me what to do,” tony commanded.
“i’ll tell them and invite you over once i’ve gotten in a routine but i’ll be mostly out of conscience for a couple days. i don’t want you to see me that way.” the teenager started biting on his finger nails then, anxious about steve’s reaction.
steve came back into the room, still naked of course. he rummaged through his bag, finding a new pair of jeans and a t-shirt that he put on right there. “do you want to eat breakfast?” he asked tony.
the man nodded in response. “you probably shouldn’t be driving anyway, right?”
tony spared the older man the truth of him not being able to eat much cooked stuff anymore without feeling ready to throw up, so he just nodded along.
There was no doubt that this right there, them standing on the altar as a family for the first time, became their most beloved family picture for many years to come.
tony was sobbing softly into steve's musky shirt now, wrapping his arms around the man's torso while he was being held closely. it didn't feel like enough touch to him though. "can I..."
“do you mind sleeping in the same bed as me?” steve picked up on the sadness in tony’s voice without having to look at the slight pout the teenager was dramatically giving off.
the teenager pulled holly straight into a conversation.
by the time the sun started to set over the city, the teenager heard the elevator open into the penthouse of the tower and huffed out a breath in annoyance. did his folks really show up the one time he stayed at the apartment?
tony spent the reminder of the spring break week mostly at the rogers’ place or walking together with steve.
"I mean I... I heard you fight and now dad is gone and you were crying and why are you kissing that lady, pops?" Peter whispered the last part and Steve used his thumb to wipe away the boy's tears.
“so stephanie is steve?” maria asked and upon tony’s nod got up and walked around the table to kiss the top of his head and hug him. “how is he?”
Peter sat down on the couch again, looking at a book about quantum physics that had been lying on the couch table. In reality, he was just waiting for his Pops to emerge from the room and maybe sneak in there to look what he'd been looking at.
“don’t apologize for having feelings rogers,” tony said softly and turned back around closing his eyes.
In response to that, Steve easily lifted Peter up while getting up himself, then held him to his chest when the boy wrapped his legs around his torso. At first thought, Peter seemed a little old to be held like this, but he was undeniably very upset, sobbing through the process, and being sick made him feel at least two years younger, so whatever.
once they’d both pulled back, steve looked at tony with a pitiful expression on his face.
tony's lips were wine and strawberries and chocolate. and the kiss wasn’t even tinted by the boy’s age which steve had thought it would be.
“well tony is… special. he’s only just getting to know his parents. they sent him off to boarding schools for most his life and he started out here before he was diagnosed.”
i love the idea of an age gap and i hope the tags and warnings are enough...
“sure is. there’s a rooftop terrace with an outdoor kitchen as well. i used to sleep out there a lot during my first months here.”
two in the morning came, and steve naturally woke up to tony still asleep.
“freezing my balls off and taking things slow,” tony said with an amused tone to his voice.
"Come here," Steve said and sat down, leaning against the bathtub, crossing his legs so that Peter could sit down on them.
when steve approaches tony as a counselor, tony needs to confess what he's been keeping a secret.
“of course, whatever you need,” the counsellor said with a clear voice and no undertone, then pulled tony’s hand from his mouth and intertwined his fingers with the boy’s, placing the two hands in his lap.
Inside Pops' and dad's bedroom, Peter found the album his pops had been looking at with ease; under the bed.
howard and maria thanked steve for the gifts and then showed him to the table, where he took off his dinner jacket, showing his muscular shape through a tight white shirt. tony knew they would have to end the night with something, steve looked way too good for them not to.
“wow, didn’t take you long to ask,” tony laughed. they had only just gotten on the highway up north. he’d promised bruce however that he would make sure he was taken care of, and he didn’t exactly want to stay away from steve for four weeks. “okay. i am only telling you this because i’m too tired to think clearly.”
“yeah, had a rough night.”
“i always thought sick kids were more kid. like, obviously mature in some aspects but more dependent on their parents.”
bucky didn’t ask questions when tony got up to take the pill, or when the teenager only ate a piece of his pizza and left the rest to them.
tony was typing something on his phone, assuring pepper he was okay to be exact, when steve entered wearing only a pair of black boxers.
“pepper? i don’t know, haven’t talked to her much.”
“so what have you been doing this break?” the man asked in order to make conversation and was astonished when tony mentioned the mansion his family had on hawaii, unbeknownst to the fact of who the kid next to him really was.
“i’m confused and i’m not sure about what yet. i’ll tell you when it hits me,” steve smiled and tony climbed on top of him, head on his chest and their legs intertwined.
"okay," tony said then. "I'll try and work on it. but I don't want you to experience this every night."
tony elaborates on his disease.
tony shot steve a smile, who knew he hadn’t been able to tell his parents yet. “do you want to come?” the boy whispered. “it makes me have to tell them.”
“sorry it’s the wine and… so tired.”
“oh stevie he’s adorable,” she said and tony walked over with a fat smile plastered on his face.
"Oh Peter, sometimes when you live together, you get into arguments. But that doesn't mean we don't still love each other to pieces. And no, not even the argument was because of you honey. And the album... I think you're in for a history lesson," Pops said and braced himself not to break down again about Peggy's death.
the two watched movies until late at night when bucky decided to call it a night. steve woke tony up so he could brush his teeth and change into something more comfortable.
steve nodded in response, heart rate picking up on speed.
“oh nothing. i should probably just catch my bus soon. i don’t like to be home too late.”
tony made sure to calm down as quickly as he could, and it’s not like he wasn’t used to those feelings. he blamed getting off of medication for this little incident and kissed steve intently while they were still out on the balcony.
bucky and steve chuckled and tony felt his cheeks heat up.
“since it’s been two years since we’ve tried number 3, i want to suggest another four weeks on that. it was your most effective of all seven.”
The six-year-old made his way down the aisle with a slow pace as he'd been told, and everyone cooed at how adorable he looked in his suit with his curls bouncing like that. Peter handed the rings to the preacher that was standing between Pops and dad and wanted to make his way to the free seat in the front row that had been assigned to him. Before he could turn to leave though, Pops placed his hand on the boy's shoulder and whispered he should stay.
tony nodded against steve’s chest and dozed off into one of the most restful nights of sleep he’d ever experienced.
“do you live alone?” the counsellor asked a few minutes later when he was driving tony back to his apartment.
“yeah, i’m steve,” the tall blonde said before reaching out to shake tony’s hand. “you go to mit?”
“he’s… beautiful. he’s mature and honest and so caring.”
tony took care of steve’s erection while digging his fingernails into the man’s back. steve himself was pulling tony’s hair like they were a handle.
tony had driven most people away that cared. he would get mad when someone said an 83% survival rate for the next five years wasn’t bad. because if the survival rate was 17%, they’d say that tony was so special, and cancer sure wouldn’t take him which was absolute bullshit to the boy. so yeah, survival rate high or not, he would die early on anyway, so what’s the point of getting a company dependent on him for a maximum of ten or fifteen years?
lunches with his mother before he’d gotten cancer had been fun. they would go to the most exclusive places and talk and talk and talk. whereas since they knew that tony would die an early age, maria had tensed up a lot, gotten into drinking and who knows what else. the teenager was always glad when those meals were over and he wouldn’t see his parents again for a while. at least while he wasn’t out of it that’s how things tended to be.
“i have to work on some papers,” the teenager insisted. “but you can still come over, if you’d like.” honestly, sleeping next to steve again seemed like the right thing to do, and he’d noticed that whenever he told people about his illness, they tend to stay close to him over the following few months until he’d tell them that he’ll hit them up if he needed someone but never did.
this led them to talk about where they’d grown up, gone to school and soon a warm sense of nostalgia filled the air, probably because tony kept quiet about his age and health issues.
families and unwanted tears.
he took his book from the bedside table and started to read.
Peter's body felt limp and warm against Steve's, and the man kissed his son's cheek.
“so what are we doing today?” steve asked, going over to the coffee machine to make himself and tony a cup. it was sunny and summery warm outside for the first time that year and tony had planned in a day for not doing school work anyway, so they were all practically open to anything.
“you okay?” bucky asked after having placed the bags on the bed.
“when did you get diagnosed?” steve asked after a while of silence.
“you seem upset,” tony stated and moved a little closer.
“we could take out the yacht,” tony shrugged. “we’ve got one here.”
rhodes had taken the liberty of packing tony’s things up before showing back up at the hospital that morning. and so they went straight from the clinic to the beach to enjoy their last day on the island, tony with a month’s worth of a drug they hadn’t yet tried but that would keep the sickness at bay, hopefully.
"why didn't you tell me?" the hurt was obvious in steve's voice and tony felt so stupid right then. steve was so compassionate, he hadn't wanted to hurt him with his silence. it's not like this was embarrassing or anything. "I thought you trusted me."
“wasn’t a question stevie,” bucky laughed and tony joined him as he watched his boyfriend’s ears turn red.
His pops was clearly upset: he sat on the edge of the bed, going through a photo album. His posture was slouched, he wore a shirt and sweatpants and his hair was ruffled. Peter started to worry. Usually pops was so put together, but this simply looked wrong.
the teenager took his usual spot in the fourth row next to pepper and maria, whom he’d tutored for a while when he started off at school in return for booze and being escorted to parties.
"Hey Tony," Pops said, his voice weak and congested, eyes glossing up.
“i was going to drive on monday, my car’s still getting fixed and they’re hoping for it to be finished by lunch.” the fact that steve’s truck was gone hadn’t gone unnoticed to tony. he hadn’t seen it at its usual spot for a while.
“well, tony. there are no ridiculous problems. life can get too much for anyone at some point.”
“hey, you got dressed,” steve pouted but then he looked down at himself with a smirk. he was wearing tony’s briefs plastered in toy story characters.
“i- no. i’m just protecting you. i’m trying to give you time,” steve explained in all honesty as he guided tony to the guest room.
and steve being the great person he was slipped one hand under his boyfriend's legs and left the other on his back, lifting him into his crossed lap with ease. tony in response buried his face in steve's collarbone, giving the blonde access to kissing the top of his head.
Officially, only Tony was Peter's father. He hadn't met Steve until he'd already been along in the process of adopting a child. They had been together for a mere year when Tony had brought Peter home.
“he was such a beautiful toddler,” andrew started in admiration. there were uncountable prints of tony running around in diapers, then naked, and then with undies.
“i know what happened the last time tony but you know how good you felt afterwards, for months.” yeah, howard had called dr. banner and told him the whole thing, worried that it might be some sort of complication with the treatment. tony still had to forgive him for that.
steve swallowed hard next to tony so the boy placed a hand on his thigh.
Peter shook his head, thinking that yes, he was finally done.
Then, the screen turned black. "I think you have seen enough, young sir," Jarvis said and Peter wondered whether it was even allowed for him to do that.
“no?” steve asked, cheeks turning deep red.
I'm in all finals mode so sorry if I don't update that much at the moment! I'll be free again from mid june
(See the end of the chapter for
“i called my parents, told them i needed them to be parents for a bit.” steve’s eyes filled with tears of hurt and sympathy for the boy sitting on his lap. “i asked them if they could stay with me for a few days,” tony explained. “amazingly, they dropped everything and flew in that night.”
“alright class, that’s it. if you have any questions leading up to the exam, you can email me or come by during office hours anytime.” steve said when the bell rang class out. “oh and anthony, may i see you after class?”
instead he placed his hands on the teenager’s shoulders and slipped down the mit hoodie tony was wearing, letting it fall to the floor once it was off. tony wore a white shirt underneath that steve slipped up after he wiped his face clean.
“hey guys,” tony said when he stepped into the entrance area. “what are you doing here?”
tony took his first pill the next day after lunch when howard was staying with him and maria had a last meeting in the city before she’d be there full time for a week.
tony liked seeing steve’s face from up there while the blond loved him how he’d never been loved before. it didn’t take long for tony to come, and the teenager was shocked when steve swallowed the load catapulted to the back of his throat.
“did you get chemo?” steve asked because he didn’t know much about this.
“i’m glad you guys had fun. i loved coming to college to wake up from that world. here you’re not a loser for driving a bentley because you can’t afford a rolls,” tony chuckled.
steve said yes after considering that tony might not have reached drinking age yet, and so he agreed to go to the student’s apartment without much of a thought.
spring break offers steve and tony time to think things through.
“then talk to your teachers, your counsellor,” bruce urged and saw the two exchange a grin.
“it’s just a small one,” tony blushed. “my dad wanted to teach me how to sail as a kid so he bought it for me and we placed it here when i started college.”
bruce sighed. “yes. he never finished the second round of chemo.”
he couldn't say much more right then, so he turned to the side and lay there while steve turned off his bedside lamp and spooned tony from behind.
steve and bucky frowned at tony with a smile playing on their faces.
tony ejaculated into steve’s mouth, moaning up against the ceiling when he pulled at the blonde’s hair. steve gently pulled tony’s boxers back up and lay his cheek against the soft skin of his lower stomach and tony lay his head back down against the pillow, commanding his house system to shut the blinds and project the night sky against his ceiling.
“yeah,” steve responded. when bucky had gotten up before to change into sweats, tony had told his boyfriend that he could tell him about his cancer when the timing was right. he didn’t want bucky to see him bleed buckets from his nose or throw up for an entire day or pass out in the middle of a room without knowing it wasn’t his own fault. “tony has a rare form of leukaemia. well, it’s rare for people his age. it’s called chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.”
he was beyond tired; sleeping had been hard again and eating was becoming way too filling way too fast.
he felt so, heart wrenchingly sorry for hurting tony the way he did, or just the possibility of how hurt tony might be. but it seemed like this would be him taking advantage of tony’s juvenile affection.
“me too,” tony laughed. “i’ve liked things like this though.”
tony lay down at the front of his yacht in only swimming trunks and napped for a bit while steve and bucky took up some sort of swimming race because both were unbelievably fit.
“i know, i’ll fix it.”
“yes. please don’t cry stevie. it’ll make me cry too and i have class in half an hour.”
"You are so much more than my husband's son Peter, you are my heir and my future and I cannot wait to continue watching you grow. You are one of the best children I have ever come across, so passionate and caring and loving and considerate of your surroundings." Steve used his thumb to wipe away a tear that had fallen onto Peter's cheek.
the skinny type was steve’s type to some extent but usually it had always been with men his age, not teenager. so the man tried to think of tony’s body as just tony, not as a sixteen-year-old’s body in order not to feel like a predator. and besides, tony was a 12 intellectually.
“good to meet you,” holly smiled and tony returned the nice welcome.
drawing blood was quick and easy and the results didn’t take longer than a few minutes.
“is he dying?” tears fell from pepper’s eyes and steve handed her the always ready box of tissues.
about halfway through the semester, steve was hit up by a human factors prof to do an introduction to psychology block in his class and upon seeing tony on the student list he took the offer immediately.
tony shrugged in response. “i guess.” aside from all the throwing up on himself, a lot of tantrums and the occasional two hour nose bleed.
"Pete?" Steve asked, his heart breaking a little at seeing the boy cry.
“it is really good tony,” sarah said. “did you learn this from your parents? what do they do?”
as soon as steve felt how close the boy was to him, their body heats seeping into each other and tony’s soft stroking of his torso, his tears started falling again.
“hey, how’s that redhead friend of yours?”
“i will tony, thank you. but now, we’ve got some things to talk about.”
tony woke, but he was still sort of asleep against steve's shoulder. "m... watch," tony said. he'd been asleep for over an hour but he was so exhausted he couldn't get himself completely awake.
Finally, the moment came in which Pepper tapped the little boy's thigh and handed him the pillow with the two metal rings on them, vibranium or something. Peter thought it was majorly cool that they had made rings out of the same material as Pops' shield.
“can we please drive for a bit?” tony asked and steve nodded, knowing exactly where he would take the boy.
“wow,” tony said before getting up and doing the same, hoping steve wasn’t looking at him and making sure he wouldn’t see his back for now; it was bruised heavily from nothing major; the pit falls of leukaemia. the teenager’s arms and legs and stomach were too, but he blamed it on boxing lessons when steve asked.
“i can understand that,” steve stated and sat down at the table.
“actually, this isn’t really about us. a few teachers have told me that you’ve seemed absent and tired lately, and i’m checking in on you as a counsellor,” steve said with a smile into tony’s smug brown eyes.
“tonight?”
“how’s it going,” the teenager asked with a slight chuckle.
“wow,” andrew said, honestly stunned. “i have always admired hard working youth. what do your parents do?”
tony looked up at steve, wiping his face with his bare hands. "I don't know what to tell you."
tony stepped closer to his boyfriend, thinking he would ask him out on a date leading up to sex hopefully.
steve brought dinner for tony when he came over later that night, but the teenager was feeling sick and all he could think of was finish those papers. he hated writing papers, they were so much more work to him than simply writing an exam. he wasn’t complaining though, he was definitely still a lot more efficient than his classmates, but he was also looking at a lot of formatting work.
“yeah, thank you,” tony said in all honesty. “as okay as one gets anyway.”
when the butler returned, tony switched seats with andrew so that the man could show steve and bucky the album.
“cute,” was all steve could say. “why are you wearing clothes?”
"Hey kid, Jarvis said you weren't f-" Peter heard his dad's voice as he entered the bathroom of his thirteen year old son, but stopped dead in his tracks. "Ew oh no puke warning, Steve!" And just as fast as he'd entered the room, Tony had left it again.
“stark, is that you?” a jet ski motor was running to tony’s right, who turned to find a family friend with a girlfriend not much older than tony himself smile at him from the water.
steve finished watching the first of the three movies and then got up to carry tony to bed.
howard had gotten mad and maria had cried when tony explained that he hoped he would never have to be worked into stark industries, and that they better find someone else to take over.
steve didn’t say any more which came as a relief to tony. there wasn’t much one could say to make things better; although a counsellor, steve tried not to let his exceptional knowledge of the human mind get into his personal relationships. maybe later on, when tony explicitly told him to but not right then.
the teenager blushed a deep red. the treatment had taken a lot out of him then, and there were a lot more embarrassing moments he all but wanted to forget.
“come on, it’s okay rhodey. i did get up by myself, didn’t i?” said tony with a slight smile but james was in no such mood.
“you look good though. you’ve gained weight,” she said and she looked like her eyes were filling with tears. pepper was very sensitive in general, but once tony had brought up the courage to tell her he had cancer, they couldn’t talk much about it without her tearing up. she had protective feelings over the boy; she was five years older than him.
“i uh. i fled from my parents tonight because i can’t stand being in a room with them for too long. and all i’ve ever wanted was to have a loving family. and now here i am and get to see the epitome of what i’ve wished for my entire life.” tony turned around again and steve kissed the top of his head while wrapping his arms around the boy.
(See the end of the chapter for
after howard and maria have stayed in town for a while, tony is feels ready to meet bucky.
tony never ended up sending that message because once his boyfriend walked in and pulled down the toy story boxers enough to take the teenager into his warm mouth, he effectively took his attention off the phone.
Peter leaned his head against his dad's shoulder in exhaustion, still crying softly once he was put down. "Hey kid, you know I love you so much the number is undefined right?"
the two sat like that for a while as tony calmed himself down from what he didn't know had upset him, he just knew it needed to get out of his system and he'd never let himself get comforted by steve before. it was wonderful.
images of tony’s bruised torso made these feelings in steve’s chest worse and the counsellor knew he couldn’t get into this now, or it would take him too long to recover. and so he put on a smile and distracted himself with the fact that later that night, tony would be all his after finishing his papers, and the tears dried up and his hands stopped shaking.
he would have loved to daydream about steve, because as of the mit website, a graduate student was allowed to have a relationship with a staff member that wasn’t of authority to them.
What did not help Peter's fear of becoming a divorce kid was that his dad had to go on a five day trip to Los Angeles and that Bucky was over even more once he'd left.
maria was drunk and howard was screaming about some company he would sue and trample to the ground.
tony took a deep breath. “they held me for a long time. they cried, i did too. was the first time i saw my father cry.” steve was a little shocked when he saw a few tears fall from tony’s eyes. the teenager didn’t seem very hung up on these things. however, it seemed like seeing his father cry didn’t even leave tony’s heart unmoved. “that night, i slept between my parents for the first time since i can think and it didn’t even feel wrong. they cancelled every single appointment for two weeks and stayed with me. they were home when i got home from school, cooked for me and talked me through my fears.”
Steve found his son a few minutes later. The boy was sitting on his and Tony's bed, sobbing silently while looking at the photo album in his lap.
tony’s heart did a backflip at what he heard. “i’d love that. how are you getting down?”
“well. it’s pretty much being raised by a nanny until you’re old enough to go to the finest institutions around the world.”
"Now bud what's wrong? What's making you so upset?" Steve asked his son gently, partly blaming the emotion on him being so sick as well.
tony spent the break between his last undergraduate and his first graduate semester at his family’s mansion in hawaii. howard and maria even showed up, for christmas at least, and rhodes flew in some time between christmas and new year’s.
The boy nodded in response, finally calming down a little.
steve did daydream about tony a little. he couldn’t help but return those beautiful innocent eyes into his mind. and yes, tony did seem very mature even if he was a bit younger than steve. he sure hoped the kid would show up the next day, but from the looks of it he would.
steve laughed out loudly at that, almost spitting out his beer. tony took a pack of cigarettes from his fleece jacket and lit one, glaring at steve while at it.
The boy did just that, and Steve was quick to use one of the rags he'd wet before to wipe off his mouth, throwing it into the laundry basket right away. Then, he used the other wet rag to wipe off the rest of Peter's face and then hold it against his forehead.
the stark’s penthouse at their very own tower in the middle of manhattan was already neatly prepared and sterilized for tony’s arrival and for the first time in weeks, he felt alone. like really alone.
the class was quite interesting that day as oppose to most other days. tony absolutely loved seeing steve talk about things he was passionate and that he knew like he knew the home he grew up in.
“i wanna dance too!” joey exclaimed and so steve moved addy to one side and picked the other kid right up, dancing around with them for a while. tony blinked quickly in response, he wouldn’t go and cry in front of steve’s family on the first day he met them. he didn’t even want to cry in front of his- boyfriend? steve sat down with both his niece and nephew on his lap and showered them with kisses.
tony laughed. “oh my god steve.” the man was definitely way too big for them, the fabric stretched around his crotch, buzz lightyear’s face looking distorted
the conversation went quiet from then on, everyone seemingly intimidated with tony. and so the teenager spoke up: “so addy, are you in some sort of a dance group?”
when the two of them came back to school, things sadly regressed to how they were before spring break. and this time it wasn’t about a silence between the pair but because they both had trouble making time for each other.
When he was four and a half years old, Peter started to call Steve Pops, and the blond man knew right away that this kid would always be a part of his life, whether he was with Tony or not.
tony wasn’t wrong to say the least. when he got back into his apartment all he could do was fall back asleep on his bed, despite having only been awake for a few hours. it took him a while to realize this could have to do with the medication and made sure to call the doctor about it soon.
Steve diverted the fire away from himself and accused Tony of his lack of sleep, and how he couldn't possibly expect to lead a normal life with only two hours of downtime a night.
“i had just moved here. during my first week someone pointed out a big bruise on my upper arm. i hadn’t realised the bigger, black ones on my back because i never look at my back.” tony shrugged then. “and it’s not like i was seeing anyone at the time who could’ve pointed them out to me. i had turned fourteen only two months before.”
steve had to teach another introduction into psychology right after tony left to head to his next class.
“i’d love to,” steve said.
“lunch is served,” a butler got their attention after a while and the whole party got up to walk to the sun deck.
they hugged each other hello. “you okay? you look kind of tired.” steve said and for his eyes looked so sincere to tony that he decided not to lie.
tony always wore his distinctive white fleece jacket over everything, ashamed of the bruises all over his body but also cold as shit most of the time. james lay out in the sun with the smallest of swimming trunks one could find, and returning from a swim he even brought in two girls that were probably as old as he was, four years older than tony.
“well, howard does weird business, i always thought it would come crashing down at one point. lucky for me i’ll probably be dead by the time it does.”
dinner went well; howard and maria loved steve and tony was over the moon about it. coming to think of it, steve could have been howard’s friend just as well.
“who’s your dad?” bucky asked. wow, steve really hadn’t told bucky a thing but again, it seemed like the man was just respecting his privacy.
At some point, after firing accusation over accusation at each other that Peter didn't even understand, Steve said: "Oh no, Tony. You do not get to cry about this. We're both in the wrong here."
“don’t worry tony, i could have asked.”
“i guess. okay i’ll ask her to come stay with me for a few days?”
it was an hour later when tony and steve climbed into the teenager’s lamborghini with a month’s worth of the drug in a bag steve placed in the trunk.
the semester started without a call from steve and a lot of parties the first few weeks.
the group of five ate a big lunch, during which tony got progressively more drunk and steve and bucky began to like andrew.
I don't know why I feel the need to keep mentioning that steve is attracted to tony for his maturity, guess the thing is internally focalised on steve during those times...
back at the tower, tony called up his friends who were spending spring break in his family’s beach house in florida to see if everything was going well. he would have liked to go too, but knowing that the few days after he got off meds could always be weird, he decided to go back to new york. it was where his favorite workshop, his favorite restaurants and his favorite emergency doctors were, just in case.
what the super soldier didn't know, was that his boyfriend woke himself up after thirty minutes of sleep, stayed awake working for a while and went to sleep for another thirty minutes.
the counsellor kissed tony’s cheek goodnight, and the teenager figured it was better than nothing before getting on the next train back to manhattan.
steve nodded in response, using the back of his hand to wipe away the tears on his face.
Peter's gaze shifted between his Pops and his dad, who both had tear streaks on their faces. He stood there, leg bouncing a bit and his left hand on the back of Pops' thigh. His eyes were wet on their own, but all he could do was smile. Steve lifted his hand off of Peter's shoulder as Tony took the Vibranium ring from the pillow and placed it on his husband's finger.
after a while, tony moved to sit back up and steve whimpered in response to the touch lost. “sorry stevie, i gotta pee,” tony smiled and got up, walking to the bathroom while steve watched him from behind.
“how’ve you been?” the lecturer asked absentmindedly while packing up his own things.
"tony?" steve asked carefully.
“she figured, we’re flying out to boston and she’ll stop by when she’s got a meeting with the board next week.”
thankfully steve came to the rescue. “hey addy maybe tony will help uncle stevie save the sauce and i can dance with you.” he gave the teenager a wink in the meantime.
The seven-year-olds heart rate picked up on speed at hearing this. His dad was crying? The argument had sounded pretty bad but it must be really, really bad if Pops made dad cry over it.
“use some time to think,” steve said and contemplated for a bit. “sit in my lap?” he asked the teenager; he really needed some physical touch right then.
it was weird how his father, one of the leading scientists of the twenty first century, didn’t even try to understand what tony was going through, and how he couldn’t factually realize that tony’s chances of surviving his father were low; howard was 36.
"I used to get them a lot before we started dating, like every night so I... I stopped sleeping."
steve watched in amazement at how tony didn’t look up anything while writing his papers, merely images to illustrate what he thought.
Peter was over the moon about it, excited to become the ringbearer to the wedding and have a picture perfect family.
"you can get it tomorrow," steve said and kissed tony's forehead before laying him down on his side of the bed. after taking off the man's shoes, socks and sweatpants, he lay down next to him and cuddled him close, falling asleep in peace.
“that’s okay, we can meet for dinner?”
the man wasn't used to seeing tony fall asleep at nine in the evening, but given that his boyfriend had been working so hard, it came as no surprise to him really.
“and that’s something to tell people too! your dad is howard stark for god’s sake. he’ll get me killed if he finds out about us.”
“you two had sex,” bucky stated an hour later when the two came into the kitchen squeaky clean.
tony nodded. “yeah.” he slid his hands up onto steve’s chest. “they give you ten to twenty years. it’s hard to make estimates.”
“me too, actually.”
three more lecturers came to talk to steve about tony that week, and the man watched his boyfriend almost fall asleep throughout the whole time, and when he was watching the screen up ahead, tony’s glance was distanced and his eyes glassy.
“honestly?” tony asked. and when steve nodded he took a deep breath. “i was scared out of my mind. i was alone, 3000 miles away from my parents.”
steve and bucky’s apartment was small, maybe half of the size of tony’s but the teenager loved how personal it looked. there were pictures of them as babies and then all of the pictures from kindergarten age on were of the two together.
“well i’m flying down tomorrow night. do you want to come along?”
“follow me,” bucky told tony and led him down a corridor into steve’s bedroom. paintings were hung over most of the wall and he too had an ensuite bathroom, something always appreciated by cancer patients.
“you okay?” steve asked after a while, when tony was softly caressing the strands of blond on top of his head.
the fact that tony said ‘it’ll be a while before it gets bad’ didn’t help him, it still meant that tony would die early on. and cancer is so unpredictable.
“yeah.”
the teenager woke up when steve got out of bed to head to the ensuite bathroom stark naked. “nice ass,” tony called after his boyfriend before lifting the blanket off himself.
from jarvis, tony knew that steve woke up at around two in the morning every night and lay awake for about an hour. steve had mentioned it to the man too, but he'd not been able to pin down an exact time. so yeah, tony usually made sure to pretend he was sleeping while steve read a book next to him to lull himself back to sleep.
the three of them sat out on the balcony with a beer when finally, tony could ask bucky what he did.
“well this turned on me quickly,” tony said with a whine and gulped down the last sip of his champagne.
in a very sober tone, dr. banner explained to tony that despite the momentary positive effects, his last treatment hadn’t been very effective, and that he was suggesting another therapy.
“there’s not much to judge steve. i’m just sorry i haven’t told you sooner.”
tony shrugged in response. “i’m not sure. i never was homesick even at the boarding school in switzerland. and i lived there for three years.” steve decided he’d have to get back on that one.
The boy opened up the book and clasped his hand over his mouth. The pictures were all in black and white. His pops was wearing a military uniform and there were pictures of him kissing a really pretty woman.
they went quiet after that and it felt just fine, which both of them appreciated a lot.
“i’m aware of the situation. tony is going through an exhausting sort of treatment that makes him sleep most of the day.”
tony spent the majority of the afternoon working on the drone again. he didn’t make big advances and napped for a few minutes every time he got too tired.
"It's just with v... vomit that I can't deal with it. Just a weakness of mine, like you being unable to see blood okay?"
tony put it on speaker.
“300 tanks and enough ammo to blow up the surface of the earth,” andrew laughed heartily and tony gulped down more champagne because steve and bucky were right there, and they must have been freaked out. “three billion dollars.”
howard hugged tony very tight when he stepped through the elevator. “you look thin,” the man commented.
“i’m glad. that was good right?”
Once the footage finally showed up on the TV though, Peter watched intently.
“no, i’ll grab something after. it’s better to have a blood check when you haven’t eaten in a while.”
there was a lot of rambling in the background once the counsellor picked up. “hey tony. you okay?”
“i took the liberty of getting you a piece.”
“sure, why not?” then steve told him he’d be surfing every day this week, and that tony should just come by when he wanted to and they’ll exchange phone numbers then.
“what’s his name?” howard asked then and tony breathed a sigh of relief.
they had a nurse clean the bathroom floor while james helped tony change into an mit sweater despite the warm weather outside. tony didn’t object. the teenager’s spine was very prominent, and his back still bruised almost black from the fall two days back. the tears returned to rhodes’ eyes.
“oh. tell his mom i’m deeply sorry and to call me if she needs any help paying for the funeral.”
also steve and tony spend their first innocent night together :).
“i don’t need help,” tony shrugged in response.
“how about tonight?” steve asked with puppy eyes and tony almost considered postponing his paper writing session into the night so he could grant steve’s wish, but he figured that would be extremely unhealthy.
tony was so nervous he had to tell them right then. “mom, dad,” he started and howard’s eyes lit up. the teenager decided he would start using that word to address his father again. “there’s something i need to tell you.”
since tony's nightmares had started, he'd figured out that during those 30 minutes, he didn't dream, and so he'd fallen into this exhausting routine just before steve and him had started to sleep in the same bed.
"Okay, see you," Steve said and Peter's eyes filled with tears. No 'love you' from pops?
“hey i can drive! that’s my lamborghini in the garage,” the teenager said in an offended manner.
“hey, i was thinking, maybe you could teach me how to surf when the weather’s a bit warmer?” and also if i’m not dead by then, tony thought.
the teenager did piss his bed again, but he had expected it, practically waited for it to happen and successfully wasn’t all upset like the last time. howard seemingly had too, because the mattress beneath the sheet was covered in plastic and a fresh set of pajamas was ready inside the ensuite bathroom already.
the boy slept for twenty hours straight when they landed in boston early the next morning. he had two days until his mom would get lunch with him, and tony was a bit relieved that he wouldn’t be watched regarding his eating habits, because eating made him feel a lot sicker than hunger did.
steve thought it weird that tony was cutting him off like that suddenly, and also that his voice suddenly seemed shaky. “it’s four in the afternoon, why?”
“your pill babe,” steve brought to tony’s attention when they were settling onto the couch with pizza.
and when he went to sit by the beach in the afternoon, he didn’t feel ready to fall asleep or like he was freezing to death, and he thought if he could feel that way for a prolonged time, he might gain some weight back on like a few months back. the bruise on his back was healing slowly but surely.
the counsellor stepped very close to tony’s back and rubbed the biceps that wasn’t holding a wine glass, his body heat emitting into tony. the teenager leaned back against steve’s muscular chest. “are you okay?”
steve didn’t know what to say. “do you want me to come along?”
steve made big eyes.
that class was uneventful for the teenager, while sometime in the middle steve told his students to quietly discuss a topic while he walked to the restroom where he began to cry once more. his dad had died of cancer when he was a young boy, and it brought all these memories back he couldn’t control. he could smell the hospital room he’d spent most afternoons in, see the bald head and dull eyes and what not.
it seemed to be a general thing in the apartment because tony too was feeling fantastic. he pulled steve out of a last slumber by lying on top of him and kissing him softly at first and getting more thorough as the man started to wake up more.
“i’ll explain over dinner tomorrow night, okay?” when steve nodded in response, tony finally leaned in and worked his tongue between steve’s lips. steve needed some time to think about this; tony knew from experience that after everyone has revaluated what they’ve been told, things would be very slightly easier to talk through.
“okay,” steve said with a shrug.
“yeah. more than okay,” tony said with a smile and rubbed his head against steve’s shoulder for a mere second.
howard wasn’t a bad father in the sense that he was mean to him. he just wasn’t really there much and he wasn’t much proud of tony because to him, his son’s achievements were standard. and tony was okay with how he was, he’d grown up autonomously until the diagnosis and that wasn’t all bad.
I'd never believed in destiny or soulmates until we happened.
“of course, thank you andrew,” tony said and waved when holly and the millionaire rode off back to his yacht thirty times the size of tony’s. as much as it was unspoken not to invite a stark when you saw them around lunch time, it was just as unspoken for a stark saying no to such an invitation. and because tony knew these things could happen, he had made sure all of them were dressed acceptably for the world he grew up in.
things had changed that way since tony’s diagnosis. his mother invested a lot more time into seeing him. who could say they saw their parents more in college than in high school?
“he’s howard stark’s son ma, they own the big stark building down in manhattan.” the world didn’t really know much about tony, that’s the thing his parents did well in the teenager’s opinion.
“alright. kept busy. how about you?”
To Peter, it didn't occur that those pictures were over 60 years old. Granted, they had decided to wait to tell the boy who his pops really had been before he'd ended up in 2005 New York.
“of course, balcony’s right through there. the kids need to go to bed now anyway,” pam said and so while tony got up, her and jim went over and took their kids into their arms before carrying them to down the hallway of the apartment.
“i know,” bucky said softly. “you guys are young though and there’s cancer research so please stevie, just stop worrying about the future too much and enjoy, okay?”
then they talked for a while until howard stepped into the living room area and tony hung up.
“andrew? good to see you, what are you doing out here?”
“don’t apologize. go to sleep.”
“yeah, got an apartment right after i didn’t have to stay on campus anymore.” things weren’t looking up for tony, he’d barely managed to climb into steve’s pick up truck. thankfully the beautiful blonde didn’t realise for he was busy securing the surfboard at the back.
tony goes back on treatment and comes out to his parents. pew.
this sparked conversations about the rogers growing up, jim’s family, about steve’s past in ballet for a few years which tony definitely had to touch back on.
tony was glad to be asked questions, that way he could eat more slowly than everyone else who seemed to gulp the food down like it could be taken from them. “i think i learned it when i moved out. and one of my nannies always insisted i help her cook,” tony told sarah with a smile. he already liked the woman. “and my parents used to produce all sorts of weaponry, but we’re slowly expanding into different fields.”
"Is it because of me?" Peter asked and wiped his nose with the back of his hand, looking up at pops.
tony shook his head. “the doctor agreed to see me alone because i just took off my shirt to show the nurse at the reception, and she thought i was being abused at home. i didn’t tell her i wasn’t, just didn’t object. once i’d filled in my forms, the doctor sent me straight to an oncologist when i told him there was no reason for the bruises. so yeah, i was the one who got to tell my parents once i had it confirmed.”
steve shook his head no, careful not to get himself too worked up into this.
“he’s 25 and a counsellor in the engineering department. sometimes he gives lectures in human factors. we checked, it’s all legal.” tony was suddenly worried now that his parents might not approve of the age difference or their statuses at school.
this was fair… usually if people start dating they don’t decide to become something serious within two days and after two unofficial dates right? the teenager nodded his head. “yes, okay you’re right. i’m sorry i didn’t tell you.”
“i know. they’re lucky kids.”
howard took care of the laundry and put fresh bedsheets on. then he put tony back to bed and upon his wish lay down with him.
tony called steve the second he got back to the workshop and while his parents were settling back into their bedroom.
it would take tony a few weeks to go deep into what steve needed to know but he felt a sense of relief he hadn't known before. maybe the mess he was would be less of a mess after sharing.
“you call your dad howard?” steve asked in confusion.
tony put the cigarette out when he was done and they went inside.
"Steve," Tony said and huffed out a breath. "For the three and a half years that I've known you, you have been nothing but a blessing to my life. Gosh, this will sound so cheesy but before I met you, I didn't even know how to enjoy life. Well, I thought I did, truth be told, but you taught me the right way. There will never be anything that I love more than a lazy Sunday afternoon with you and Peter, while we teach you about the modern technology of the 21st century.
You have given me a family after I was taken away from mine and love, you have given me a future that needs to be lived. Thank you, Tony, I love you with all my heart."
"Oh bud," Steve said, lifted Peter by his arm pits and turned him to let his legs dangle to the left of his body. Placing a hand at the back of his son's neck, Steve pushed the boy's face into the crook of his own neck, letting him cry it out in the hopes of letting it make him feel better. "Your dad doesn't think you are disgusting," he began to explain but Peter's sobs made it hard to stay focused because they were tearing at his heart.
"What's wrong in there?" they heard Tony say from the bedroom.
steve seemed shaken when they kissed each other in front of the elevator.
“i know tony. i know. i’m sorry you never experienced family life like this.”
when he was writing down the sources of said images, his phone rang, and it read ‘howard stark’.
and so bucky told andrew about his job in advertising and that he was a first generation immigrant with a physics professor as a dad and a mom in human resources.
the ginger haired girl looked exhausted as she sat down on the couch across from steve.
he was woken by howard a few hours later. “hey kid, it’s probably time to get ready. steve will be here in a half an hour.”
tony returned back to the now from his memory. he still felt good about that night despite what had happened and despite the fact that he was already in college when it did. maybe it had been some sort of late childhood experience he’d needed in order to heal some of the pain he’d suffered during his autonomous childhood. he hadn’t felt that lethargic ever since, but his parents would likely be there when he would, and now so would steve.
“i didn’t think it was necessary. age of consent is sixteen here and i’m mature aren’t i?”
so tony did, because he needed a spot to sit anyway and steve’s lap seemed like a great option.
honestly, he developed a reckless type of behaviour during his university time. he took on twice the workload others did, for while his body was tired most of the time, his brain was what needed something to do during the nights he couldn’t sleep for sheer exhaustion (and questioning that fact was not on the list, it made him more anxious than it calmed him).
steve sighed as he rubbed his temples. “yes you are tony but… it’s weird. if you had more experience or were a bit older or able to drive-“
“i can’t afford losing all that time during the semester, bruce,” tony said with a shake to his voice that caught steve’s attention as well.
steve was surprised to see a single tiny trembling frame at the beach when he returned from a wind surf session.
tony noticed that steve was looking at him with interest sometime during their much too touchy talk for his liking, and upon that he started to speak more slowly, directing most of steve’s attention to his mouth and hair.
“i’ll see you at dinner tomorrow, okay? i’ll pick you up,” tony said, which had never happened but he felt like driving again after not having done that in so long.
steve got up in response. “espresso?”
“i’m not sure,” the man responded. and exactly how would he tell tony this? that his heart ached for time they’d never shared. that he should have taken care of tony as a kid, that he now enjoyed having someone dependent on him but the reason for that was so tragic he wished it wasn’t happening. “i’m glad we’re finding some sort of a curve to our relationship. i missed out on so much when you were a kid and i regret it.”
“bucky and i coughed our way through them when we were sixteen and i’ve hidden them beneath a floorboard ever since.”
steve breathed a mental sigh of relief with the thought that tony must at least be 21 then. and tony was relieved to be saying that because steve now definitely thought he was old enough to have a good time.
tony figured now was the time to ask; steve was open and nostalgic and also freezing, so suggesting opening a bottle of wine back at his place seemed fair.
“yeah, my parents are way too generous.”
howard was distant, as if thinking his presence or touch could break tony easily, which with his 100 pounds seemed fair. but the billionaire did hug his son a lot more than before.
On the third day with Pops alone, Peter was picked up at school by his uncle Clint, rather than his Pops. Clint wouldn't tell him why Steve hadn't been there to pick him up, and the seven-year-old became very, very suspicious.
“i’m gonna go grab some fresh air,” tony told the table.
tony’s driver dropped steve off at his mother’s apartment building after a fantastic circuit around the city.
the teenager looked down at steve’s crotch, where he saw him bulging against the fabric of his jeans. “can i take care of this?”
tony saw a shocking card on bruce’s desk; an obituary for a five year old boy tony had got to know when he was first diagnosed and stayed at the hospital for a couple of days. “khalil passed?”
it was later that afternoon when steve and tony were on the way back from dropping howard and maria off at the airport. tony had insisted he needed a change of scenery and so he was going to spend a few days in steve’s apartment. he had yet to meet bucky as well and that made him nervous.
the teenager lay his head on the man’s biceps and steve held his stomach close with his other arm. tony still hadn’t completely calmed down from his sadness spell a few minutes back, and steve’s biceps grew wet with a few stray tears out of the teenager’s eyes while they were trying to fall asleep.
never had it gone this fast for either of them, and tony thought that surely now he would get more sick, because that is how life goes.
“you’re sixteen,” steve said as he walked inside.
"do you want to watch a movie?" the blond asked and hugged his boyfriend from behind.
The argument went on and on, and Peter just stood outside of his parents' bedroom in shock.
steve surfed for just over an hour before joining tony on his picnic blanket and thankfully sipping some tea the younger one had brought.
“breakfast?” the man asked and tony nodded in response. he sat down in his usual spot at the table howard started to set.
“hey you’re that new counsellor in engineering right?” the teenager had heard a few girls talk about dr. rogers before and after class, and how his schedule was always full because everyone was trying to make a pass on him.
tony had steve park his car next to his lamborghini down in his area of the garage, without mentioning that the car to their left belonged to himself. he’d stayed off driving for he’d been tired a lot lately, and while he could forgive himself dying, he wouldn’t be able to face survivor’s guilt.
“looking good out there,” a confident voice said and steve chuckled before changing into sweats and a puffer jacket a few feet away.
bucky took tony’s bags from steve at the door of their apartment while steve ran back down to the car to get the rest of his own things.
"He's not back yet."
“i’m maria,” tony’s mom approached steve and hugged him right away, just like sarah had hugged tony when they’d first met.
the situation was driving him crazy. he was a teenager, he couldn’t goof around with someone and not expect sex very soon. and him and steve felt so… homey.
“i uh… nothing i say will leave this room, right?”
tony rose up the moment he reached clarity in his mind. “thanks,” he said with a smile. “what time is it?”
“okay,” the man said then. “in bed?”
tony didn’t say much more, and then howard was done washing him and lifted the teenager out of the tub, wrapping him in a big towel before setting him down on the rim of the tub. howard got his son dressed back in pajamas quickly. “me too,” the teenager finally whispered and then howard was crying, and tony’s eyes filled with tears as well.
“your mom wants you to spend them on the mainland, where house care is close by in case of an emergency. besides, she wants you to get settled in ahead of the semester and not rush into anything right now.”
“yeah,” tony smiled and leaned back into steve’s side.
“yeah,” the boy nodded. “not all there is though. and there was a girl on hawaii before him too.” tony went into detail because for one, he wanted his parents to know he liked girls too, and for the other he wanted to let them know he’d lost his virginity so they wouldn’t come with talks about it.
they had already exchanged so much personal details that day, so tony suggested they watch a movie or two. he didn’t want steve to have to reveal every detail about himself that he might not even want.
“what do you wanna do? i need about another half hour,” tony said and picked up his laptop.
“well, i can’t complain. your dad and i sealed a deal in iran last week as i’m sure he’s told you.”
“oh. do you want to come over? we’ll just have dinner all together and from about nine i’m all yours.”
“did they think you were homesick?” steve wondered because from how tony’s relationship with howard and maria seemed, this didn’t sound like a typical thing in their relationship.
“that’s a big one,” pepper commented tony’s energy drink and he shot her a tired smile. “off the meds,” he stated, and she rubbed the boy’s shoulder.
maria wasn’t drunk and coming to think of it, she had come out of rehab just a few weeks back. he and steve had moved all the alcohol tony had in his apartment into steve’s for just that reason.
“that bad huh,” tony said and looked away. he was not going to get hurt at this. he didn’t even know steve. it was not the man’s problem that tony felt like this was how people felt meeting the loves of their lives.
upon waking out of unconsciousness, tony saw his best friend cry for the first time in a long time, since shortly after he’d told him about his illness. he sprung from the bed to throw up in the adjacent bathroom, not making it completely but nevertheless not bad for being thrown into wake just seconds before.
“so. steve, what do you do?” andrew asked then and tony was glad to get off the topic of his health and arms.
“yeah but hey, i shouldn’t be using your counselling during the semester break, right?” tony raised his eyebrows, not knowing what he was doing.
“i’m so sorry steve,” bucky said then, placing a hand on his best friend’s shoulder. “is he…?”
“harvard, sir. and i got my phd at yale.”
it was eleven in the morning and steve had been awake for about two hours, but he’d helped himself to some coffee and fruit and watched tv while letting tony sleep in.
“hey son,” howard said and hugged tony. “you’ve gained weight, you look good.”
“i’m sorry stevie i don’t think i can eat much tonight,” tony said in dismay but steve waved it off.
“tony,” steve said happily upon picking up. “how was your night?”
On the big day a few months later, his dad's assistant Pepper took Peter under her wings in the morning before the ceremony, while his fathers had brunch together.
“oh,” steve said and stared at tony for a bit, trying to get his emotions under control but failing miserably. tony was going through this, he had no right to burden him with his tears, but he couldn’t hold them back. and steve started to cry, his hands still around tony’s back, who didn’t move in response to the tears.
“there’s always a place here for you if you need anything honey,” sarah said and kissed the boy’s cheek before going inside.
steve laughed too. “what size are these?”
tony woke the next day between his parents and again, it felt so right. he reached over his mother to grab his phone and find a few new text messages from steve, whom he hadn’t answered since the day before.
the two drove out of boston and steve stopped the car at a little restaurant by a rough looking part of the coast. “we’re getting you brunch,” he announced to tony.
“w-… well that would be great,” bucky said, not believing his ears. “isn’t howard stark’s son still a kid though?”
tony felt steve stiffen beneath him. "I mean I take naps, loads of them but I just don't sleep beyond half an hour, usually. I started that shortly before we started going out."
he met steve sort of early the next morning, and they had a cup of coffee first before going for a walk in central park, all the while tony hoped his fatigue and nausea wouldn’t make an evil return now.
“i’ve been sleeping in the guest room but you can sleep there and i’ll have the couch,” steve suggested when they were done brushing their teeth.
“hi mrs. rogers, i’m tony.”
steve chuckled in response. “i slept in the guest room, hope that’s okay.” he took a breath. “i figured you’d sleep better in your bed than on the couch and… i move slowly with people.”
tony came back outside with a pair of black boxers and a shirt on he would sleep in. his naked mood had disappeared when he had seen that he’d had blood in his urine, meaning he’d have to go see his doctor the next day.
It took the A.I. quite a while to have the footage of Steve's and Tony's bedroom show up on screen, as if he'd been thinking about whether Peter should see or not.
“it’s alright. you’d probably rather be pushing through with those papers,” the man guessed. upon tony’s nod, he told him to do just that.
the counsellor dropped tony off in front of the luxury apartment building he lived in after a few minutes.
their time on o’ahu was cut short when the boy fainted in the middle of the living room and was held at the hospital for three full days, hooked up to every device one could imagine.
“how are you holding up?” andrew’s wife had died of a brain tumour only a few years before tony was diagnosed and although it seemed controversial, the man cared a lot about his friend’s kid.
“thanks. what are you up to?”
“very well, thank you. do you think you can check on my son in the kitchen, i think he’s burning the sauce,” sarah said with a wink and turned back to her glass of wine. tony noted that the table was already neatly set and turned on his heel.
tony stepped out on the balcony and wiped a few tears from his eyes before he heard someone step out of the door too. he turned around quickly and wiped at his eyes again when he saw steve, then quickly turned around again. who was he kidding? steve had seen and his shaking shoulders weren’t exactly subtle.
tony nodded then and closed his eyes. “thank you,” he whispered after a while. “for being here, i mean.”
“so? are you not attracted to me?” tony asked a bit unsurely, because you can’t be that bad at reading signs, can you?
“you could go stay with your parents again, or maybe you have someone else to take care of you, here?” dr. banner asked tony, glancing at steve swiftly.
“yes but it’s hard being friends with someone who’s sick and ignores you when you’re worried.”
“well, i’m not going to malibu.”
the two of them sat close to each other when the music started softly and slowly, and steve’s hand was facing up on his lap, so in the middle of the movie tony slipped his own in there. they both pulled back a tiny bit for a short second, then intertwined their fingers like it was so normal.
Tony smiled at his son once their eyes were on the same height, wiped the boy's right cheek with his thumb and pecked the skin there.
“uhh, you’re pregnant?” steve said with a laugh and tony chuckled in response.
the teenager blushed red as he sat down on steve’s lap again. “i’ve had them for a while, they’re kids underwear.”
What the little boy did not hear that night was the reconciliation talk that his pops and dad shared.
“yes. in fact, tony was potty trained on this ship.”
tony gave the things steve said a lot of thought. but no matter what way he twisted and turned the ‘problem’ around, he always concluded that he wanted to be with him.
the teenager was about to wallow in self pity when steve spoke up: “wait, when did you start smoking?”
however, steve decided he’d have to see for himself how tony acted in class first, and so he’d wait until the thursday the week after, and left all pink and in love the next day.
“you know what would be really good right now?” tony asked the blonde and sat down on the windowsill. “a cigarette.”
“i don’t know,” tony lied because he couldn’t possibly tell this story about his first treatment two years ago:
“he’s uh… he’s got cancer and i’m worried because he hasn’t been here all week and he’s not answering my texts or calls.”
tony quickly realized that everyone at the table was living his dream of having a close family. he knew it was cheesy, but something about what he’d seen in movies had always touched his heart. adison and her younger brother joey (joseph, after sarah’s late husband) were loved all around, got to grow up with four adults who loved them to pieces. the teenager didn’t like himself getting jealous of things the way he did. but what was he to do? those kids had won big, that was for sure.
"do you get those a lot?" steve asked to tony's dismay. there it was.
When I brought this little boy home, I gave him the gift of a father. But Steve, what you gave our sweetheart is a family. And I will forever love you for that and for a ton of things that would take too long to mention now."
tony shook his head in response. “chemo is for when you’ve tried everything and things don’t get better. well, it is for chronic leukaemia, anyway. i wasn’t given a treatment until a few months later. what they do is keep your blood cell count supervised and when the cancerous cells spike and your general well-being gets worse, they’ll try a treatment to make it go back down. chemo is more for acute danger of death,” the boy explained and steve’s tears were back. tony was so well spoken, so mature and it hit him way harder than it should have. “the five year chance of survival is 83 percent, but that’s mainly because most people who get diagnosed are seventy or older.”
“sometimes, yes. as i said, anyone can be pushed down at some point.”
His day could've definitely started out better, Peter was sure about that. Because on any morning better than this one, he wouldn't start off being hunched over the toilet, bringing up the remains of his dinner from the night before.
yeah, tony had that effect on people who got close, so he usually didn’t let anyone.
Peter shook his head. "No. Can... can you show me what he's doing?" Now Peter knew that this was a very, very hard violation against his Pops' privacy, but he was worried and just had to know what was going on.
tony sighed. “yes. but i’m also a grad student and really attracted to you,” he said with a smirk.
“howard it is then.”
andrew did as tony had told steve he would and dropped the group of three off in his chopper after they had a staff member of the laura go ahead to get tony’s yacht back to the marina.
“mom, you look good,” tony said honestly as he hugged the woman.
"Is there anymore?"
howard didn’t know what to say because he couldn’t exactly pretend for this to be a natural thing he’d do. and when tony opened his eyes next, howard’s were full of tears, making the teenager’s heart rate pick up on speed. “what’s wrong?”
“sorry, the jokes just come spewing out when i’m drunk.” steve didn’t respond, eyes fixated on the road. “well, anyway. i think andrew liked you guys a lot, summer should be fun.”
maria joined the two a few minutes later and kissed the top of tony’s head.
"Now that your dad and I have put a label on our relationship, I would like to put one on yours and mine too. Will you let me adopt you, Peter?"
after the pair had brushed their teeth and done all other night time duty, they lay down in bed where tony told steve to put his arms around him from behind.
tony woke up the next morning seemingly well rested and not feeling sick for once. on days like those, the teenager took particular advantage of his health. he filled up on as many calories as he could and even took a slow walk in the morning.
steve nodded slowly and lifted tony’s chin up so he could look him in the eyes. “yes. if you want to get off, i’ll do you the pleasure, but i want you to be fully there when…”
“yeah, you’re right.” he pulled his socks a little further up. “your appointments are always booked to the top by horny college girls though.”
tony felt that way for the first time, in his life it felt like. and it made him a sort of sad he’d never experienced before. not even when he found out he had cancer.
the diagnosis had been nothing new. tony was to take things slowly, maybe even slower than he already was taking them. chemo was yet unspoken of. however, the teenager did have to try eating more, he was ten pounds underweight once again, and he had only just gained fifteen pounds 3 months before.
Steve gave Peter's hand a squeeze and then let it go to place the ring on Tony's finger as well. They shared their first kiss as husband and husband and if Peter's eyes were wet before, they were a river now.
but he didn’t really want to crowd bucky during their first encounter and then steve walked in anyway.
the talk got a little awkward then, but nothing a counsellor with a psychology degree couldn’t fix.
now steve knew he’d have to talk to tony soon. he’d been notified by a few lecturers and teaching assistants about tony’s rather tired demeanour ever since the semester had started up, and it was his duty as counsellor to make sure that tony was at his best health both mentally and physically.
“we’re on our way to aruba, isn’t that right babe?” the millionaire laughed and slapped the girl’s tan thigh, nodding towards behind him where tony realized a huge yacht had anchored not far from his. “this is holly, by the way. holly, that’s tony stark, howard’s son.”
"Your father is currently in the bedroom. Would you like me to call him for you?"
steve fell into a sort of melancholic mood for a few days after he left tony standing after that ten minute hug.
Tony told Steve that he couldn't dwell in the past forever, that Bucky was a changed man now and that he couldn't expect him to not be jealous when Steve spent all of his time with his best friend.
The guests quieted down and Steve squeezed Peter's shoulders, then began to talk. "I remember the day when your dad brought you home as if it was yesterday. I remember the first time I put you to bed and the first time I kissed your wounds when you were hurt. I can clearly recall the first time you called me Pops because I haven't really been unhappy since-" Steve took a breath and Peter smiled at his Pops with glossy eyes.
“are you all by yourself kid?”
at the rate he was going the first three semesters, the billion-dollar heir (who probably would be an heir of no sort, let’s be real) would have had his bachelor’s by the end of the following semester. but his doctor had told him to cut back a little before it was time to book classes, for his dysfunctional blood cell count was rising slowly, and another spike was to be expected soon.
“i’m starting grad school in two weeks,” tony said with a shrug.
“why wake up from a world like that? it is your life isn’t it? not like that’s gonna change,” bucky wondered.
steve’s full weight was crushed against tony’s legs, his hands reaching around the boy’s back, fingernails digging into the skin. it took tony longer than it ever had, making steve glad he wasn’t taking advantage of this vulnerability.
“yeah. i’m sorry i’m just pitying myself,” tony wiped a few more tears that seemed to be flowing freely now that steve was here, and he hated himself for it. “it’s no big deal.”
context: howard and maria have just left boston and tony is spending the weekend at steve and bucky's. steve's upset because he starts to realize that tony really is sick and can't be saved.
steve nodded his head in response and by the time they arrived at his apartment, tony had already arranged for pepper to stay with him for a while the week after so he wouldn’t be alone. not that he would have been, but pepper didn’t need to know that.
“hm,” bucky hummed then.
"well that's what people do in a relationship tony," steve said. he wasn't reacting to tony's fresh set of tears and tony was glad.
the counsellor lasted longer than tony had, for he also had to direct the boy with what to do from time to time, but he loved it considering it was tony’s first time doing this.
tony tried to stay awake for as long as he could, but he crashed against steve’s shoulder before the bells rang midnight.
“your parents are different to what i expected.” he meant nicer, tony was sure about that.
tony knew steve was going to get mad at him for not telling him before. "I mean I know I had a nightmare but I have no idea what it was," the man said carefully.
tony’s chest fluttered with butterflies washed down with a new set of tears. he had never felt this wanted and protected and safe.
“you okay?” tony asked when he climbed into bed next to steve, wearing only the toy story boxers steve so loved on him. steve on the other hand, was nude.
it was an odd thing to see, a boy doing calculus while sitting in his dad’s lap wearing diapers but steve loved it. it was so adorable he could have squealed. he asked andrew if he could get copies of the pictures he loved the most, and was promised to receive them in the mail a week later.
"sure," tony said because he needed a break; he'd been at it nonstop for over 9 hours.
“me too,” tony said with a sigh. “i’ll tell them at breakfast. sleep over tonight?”
Peter's body shook in excitement while he sat in that last row and the pastor talked about love and acceptance. It was a small wedding, maybe 70 people at most, invited were only family and a few friends of Peter's parents, some of them really old which Peter didn't quite understand but he nevertheless enjoyed talking to all of them.
steve interrupted that train of thought by handing the teenager a pack of cigarette with a sort of retro design.
tony frowned at that. “did she talk to you or something?”
“yes. i would love for you to blow me.” the teenager smiled slightly at his choice of words.
steve’s alarm was what finally had them settle on another coffee date the next day; he had to go home and make some dinner for his mother, sister and two nephews.
“yeah, just gotta catch my breath.”
tony wiped over his face one last time before he nearly dropped his wine glass when sarah appeared in the door to tell him goodnight.
“yeah, so? would still be nice to do something for your friends, wouldn’t it?”
and it wasn’t like he could talk to his friends about it; they would either say that tony’s a twink who he could just do or that he’s a pedophile, and if he was being honest, he could not face those things if they were the truth.
considering how quiet the table was while they were eating, tony couldn’t be more proud of what he’d whipped up.
"yes?" steve asked so softly it made tony cry more.
"D-Dad thinks I'm disgusting?" And just as quickly as the tears had appeared, they fell down Pete's full rosy cheeks.
they kissed way too long for this not to lead somewhere, and so tony grinded his hips against steve’s body. steve pushed him back a little before he himself got a hard on.
"Hey bud," Steve said as he entered Peter's bathroom and the boy heard a cabinet open and then some water running, and then Steve was by his side in a bit.
Peter was a very sensitive kid, and he was quick to realize when there was tension in the room.
tony slept bad for most of the night and he was exhausted by the time he spotted steve at the back of the counsellor’s favorite café in the village.
Peter had felt similarly to his dad. It'd been a good few weeks since he'd spent quality time with his pops who was usually 'just catching up with an old friend'.
tony turned around and felt so safe with steve next to him that he felt his tears start to fall out of nowhere, unable to do anything about it.
tony didn’t like the word cry. crying was something for kids and he didn’t like that steve had caught him off guard like that.
oh no, suddenly tony’s vision blurred and he felt about to pass out. and coming to think of it, he hadn’t eaten yet and it was late in the afternoon. “hey, do you know what time it is?”
when steve was done eating, he sat down in tony’s big leathery armchair without a word.
“hey uh tony,” steve said when he shook the boy’s small frame awake the next morning. “your phone rang, i didn’t pick up but it’s your mom so i figured it might be important.”
With the wedding ring on his finger, Steve took Peter's left hand into his right one and smiled down at the boy as he examined the new ring. "Tony," Steve started, voice already a bit shaky. "When I was young I would dream on and on about what the future would hold for me. I weighed out many options, and I don't think you'd be hurt if I said you weren't one of them.
“i sure do,” tony chuckled. “he was here last week though. i’m back on treatment for three more weeks,” the teenager informed.
“come here baby,” steve said and leaned against his desk, crossing his arms in front of his chest all teacher like.
“good, thank you. same thing as back in winter two years ago.”
“uhm?” tony asked with a chuckle.
"Okay baby boy," Tony said purposely to annoy the kid, "what do you say we get you dressed and then watch movies together?"
“how did they react when you told them?”
tony had been off his medication for two weeks when he walked into the lecture hall and saw steve up front.
“of course,” steve said and crossed his legs. “what did you want to talk to me about?”
“wow steve, you’ve outdone yourself by a landslide,” jim said and steve eyed tony who was sitting right next to him.
the date was cut short when steve got a call from his sister asking him to babysit in the afternoon for she had a job interview she’d been hoping for.
tony’s heart made a summersault at that. that was adorable. “of course it is. did you eat something?”
“so, how are you, how’s business?” tony asked and pulled out a cigarette when he saw andrew signal over the butler holding a cigar box just behind him. the young man, who couldn’t be much older than steve, held out a lighter to first light tony’s cig, then andrew’s cigar. starks were served first. that was that. steve and bucky sat down on either side of tony, each  handed a glass of champagne right away and offered a cigar that both declined.
“don’t worry,” howard assured. “we both know it’s the meds.”
“sure,” steve said heartfully. “just weird, knowing you grew up like this.”
“it’s very nice to meet you adison, i’m tony.”
“are you aware of your surroundings?” steve asked carefully. he wasn’t too keen on taking advantage of tony’s medicine induced lust that might just be need for physical touch.
“so what year are you in now?”
tony was exhausted, to say the least. he'd been working hard for a few days and his naps throughout the day had become less and less. his stark watch, the thing he relied on to wake him silently next to steve, notified him that it needed to be charged at about eight in the evening. so tony plugged it in right when steve came walking into the lab.
so yes, tony took advantage of said workshop and made a few test runs for a possible drone he might be using for his master thesis before falling asleep on the couch situated closest to his desk.
"I don't understand," steve said then, putting his arm around tony's chest and kissing the top of his head again.
“what happened last time?”
“my sexuality is mature intellectuals.” tony watched steve pace around the apartment.
steve was still holding tony like a baby, and now that the man was doing better, it felt weird to tony. he lifted himself out of the man's lap and scooched back against the head lean of the bed, thankfully leaning into steve's side when the man sat down next to him.
“no no, my boyfriend and his best friend are racing somewhere around here, they should be back soon.”
“i don’t like talking about my problems.” he raised his pitch a little. “oh mr. rogers, my mom’s a drunk and my dad expects me to take over his company although-“ tony managed to stop himself before he said that he was dying. he’d gotten way too comfortable making jokes about death.
“you’re so small,” steve said all flustered and with a blush before tony threw on the shirt that was so big on him it went down to the middle of his thighs.
steve nearly had a heart attack when tony rose up into a seating position, panting heavily.
“will you dance with me?” adison asked and tony knew he shouldn’t be doing that because to be honest, he might fall over anytime now.
and so they went home a while later, deciding to meet again the next day and both unable to wait with excitement.
steve walked over with all his things and sat down opposite tony in the sand in order to put on socks and a pair of sneakers.
“so what’s the verdict?” steve asked with a shuttered voice. “are you going to die?”
somehow getting distracted and active and eating healthy really helped tony. he was really responding well to this treatment, and he loved the fact that now, after meeting steve, he seemed to enjoy life again even if it was without what seemed like a most serious crush.
“exhausting, but i feel a lot better,” the teenager said while blushing deeply. steve could figure.
tony sat up a little, then turned around, kneeling with steve’s legs between his and thanking himself for getting the big armchair when he furnished the apartment. steve reached around tony and held the small of his back so tony wouldn’t roll back; it’s what he did when his niece or nephew sat on his lap like that.
“really?”
“wow, congratulations,” tony said with a polite smile.
and tony didn’t know what to say to that, so he just had james put his head on the bed next to where he was lying and streaked his hair in circling motions.
“i talked to the pilot, our flight’s leaving tonight.”
“steve. nothing has happened, nothing will happen without my consent. and besides, howard doesn’t give a shit about who i’m doing.” he stepped closer to steve and put his hands on his broad shoulders. “nothing has changed besides the fact that you thought i was a few years older.”
“you didn’t have to do that,” tony told him when he pulled his boxers and pants back up and was helped into his shirt by steve. “thank you though,” he said and pressed another kiss on steve’s lips.
the starks along with andrew and his wife had spent that summer cruising around the mediterranean and steve loved seeing how happy tony was with all the adults.
steve was extremely excited for his first ride on tony’s private jet and the teenager loved every second of it.
tony fell asleep in steve’s arms that night. steve didn’t wear a thing while tony stuck with his boxers and t-shirt.
it was great having steve at the oncology centre with him as tony realized. he knew some of the faces in the waiting room; moms with kids who had cancer, kids with moms who had cancer and the odd person who came alone.
none of his professors dared to say anything about that, because they all knew tony could take on classes and graduate with a perfect score without studying for a minute.
“i know what you’re thinking. and no, i don’t have a messias complex. he’s not bound to die soon so i’m just trying to enjoy and live in the moment.” but then tears started to fall from steve’s eyes and bucky looked over at him in concern. “he’s just a kid but his mind is that of a beautiful and challenging man and i-“ steve broke off, couldn’t grasp his emotions properly and didn’t even know why he was crying right then.
“anything,” howard said and placed his hands at the side of his plate.
He was seven years old when he first heard his fathers fight. It was a rough argument about a lot of things.
“steve i…” tony coughed in order to fake a short break.
tony rolled his eyes. “we’re not leaving, there’s two weeks left.”
“yeah, some people just win at life, am i right?” the teenager said and put his head against his boyfriend’s chest. there was no sarcasm in his voice which steve would have expected. tony was serious about it, not looking for pity about his illness.
“wait, let me see what i can do,” steve said before kissing tony again and going inside.
“how did you deal?” steve pulled tony a bit closer then.
“oh tony. i don’t want to hurt you. you’re meant to experiment, to have first times together with high school crushes.”
hey, I'm finally back. I had two finals that each were worth 18 credits so I literally couldn't even think about this story until now, but I'm finally back :)
