The second and third boxes were filled with bottoms, butter soft leggings in basic colors and then in fun prints, black jeans for work that had a little stretch for comfort and reinforced seams so Tony wouldn’t have to patch them so often, several pairs of dark denim with decorative pockets and all the structure needed to hug the Omega’s little waist and still fit over his rear.
take any chances. Safe sex, non knotting sex-- he had to be able to grab his clothes and run if something went wrong and he couldn’t handle it, or if he and Steve really weren’t compatible in bed and the aftermath was awkward, or if Steve tried to settle him, because being settled while knotted was a whole other level of mind numbing and Tony didn’t even want the risk.
of having a child in the house, but for right now, Tony we would love to watch Pete.” Emotion wavered in Nat’s husky voice. “Omega, we would love to watch him. Thank you. This-- um-- you--”
with less trouble than I had trying to wrangle that baby into a pull up for bedtime.” Bucky declared and the Omega laughed at him. “Dunno how toddlers can be that damn wriggly, it just ain’t right.”
“I… did.” Howard nodded hesitantly. “I called to try and check on you but you didn’t answer so I assumed--”
— and Bucky found himself grinning as he watched the lanky Omega sprawl halfway over the counter to reach the phone.
The Alpha eased away enough to sit back on his heels and give Tony a chance to breath. “Can I scent you, honey? Now that it's just me and you?”
Tony's eyes dropped to the expertly knotted tie that perfectly matched the blue pinstriped suit . “...alright?”
The shower was a quick affair, Steve struggling to soap up and scrub down when his cock was half hard, cheeks flushed and mind racing with all the questions about
knew Steve was head over heels for this little Omega and it was looking an awful lot like Tony was only coming around for the money.
“...them?” Steve backed off a few steps, looking over his shoulder towards the living room and the stairs beyond to the bedrooms. “What do you mean
if their partner believed they needed to count calories. The sea bass was higher priced than most Alphas chose for their dates, but the Beta certainly wasn’t going to comment on it. If the big blond wanted to spend fifty dollars on a plate for an Omega wearing scuffed shoes…
“-- and you’re over there in your nun habit wiping down the bathroom and memorizing where he puts his plates?” He made a disbelieving noise. “Tony, there are
“Okay.” It was Tony’s turn to blush, soft pink clear to the top of his ears and making his eyes sparkle. “Okay, I love every single word you just said, and for the record? You’re my entire world too and yeah, I’m never going to want anyone else ever, but I didn’t mean it like that. I mean, you’re so good at all this even missionary position feels porn-star worthy, but do you ever want to try something new?”
sigh, swallowing back the part of him that wanted to pounce on the bed and devour. “Tony, this is everything I ever wanted, do you understand? Everything I wanted. The apartment feels like I stepped back seventy years, and you got the right beer brand and lit candles instead of lights and that’s–”
“Can I have you like this?” Steve managed the entire sentence this time, eyes ringing scarlet as he plucked distractingly at the waist band of the tiny underwear. “Right here on the floor?”
“What?” A flare of panic that Tony quickly tried to squash. “No, I’m not seeing anyone else. Um, are… you? Do you have another… sugar baby?”
“You should go before we run out of time” Steve tugged his jacket a little tighter around Tony’s frame, and shook his head when the Omega tried to shrug away to give it back. “Keep it, Tony. Bring it back next time we see each other, alright?”
“We?” Clint cracked a smile. “What, are you and Moneybags gonna adopt me? I’ll be the little orphan Annie to your guys’s Daddy Warbucks.”
Bucky and Tasha!” Steve said louder and Tony closed his tight and giggled a little nervously as the two Alphas grumbled good naturedly and gathered their stuff to go. “Lock the door behind you, Buck!”
and the Alpha shoved closer, lapping at the slick drops as if he were starving. “Well if you insist, I suppose I could get used to being spoiled like this…”
The fifth box held a leather messenger bag for Tony to take along for errands, and smaller over shoulder bag to take along to work, both bags in dark practical colors that would hide any dirt, plenty roomy enough for any of his essentials but also clearly expensive enough that no one would ever look twice at the Omega again if he walked into a store to shop.
“Sweetheart?” Steve straightened up from the bed, leaving the Omega naked and wet, sprawled out on the bed beneath him.
in there, broken windows and moldy carpet, a series of locks on the door frame that had long since been busted and were now useless, rows of mailboxes with the numbers rubbed off and then rewritten in already dulled permanent marker as new people moved in and hopefully other people moved out instead of… died… in the horrid conditions.
Peter started babbling a string of nonsense about colors and pancakes, and Steve just kept watching Tony, staring up at the Omega with adoration and affection and understanding reflected in his blue eyes.
had me needing to change my panties--” Clint howled in laughter at that and Tony flushed, “So yeah. I’d say Mr. Rogers is still feeling rather neighborly.”
“I uh--” Belatedly, Steve realized they were still standing next to the table, the waiter hovering at a respectful distance waiting to fill their water. “Shit. I mean
“Umm…” Clint glanced around the kitchen then ‘accidentally’ upended a bag of fries into the dryer and ‘whoops’ knocked a burger patty onto the griddle. “Two minutes?”
once Tony confirmed that yes their relationship wasn’t about the arrangement for him anymore just like it clearly hadn’t been about the benefits for Steve for a while now. “Then stay.”
“Be nice.” Bucky repeated and patted his friend only lightly on the back. “You can kick my ass later, if you wanna fight I’ll even let you get a few swings in before I start protecting my face, but
“Dirty.” Tony scrubbed at his nose and left a smear of black behind. “Oh! Did you come down here to drag me into the shower? Cos I’ve got this one spot real low on my back I’m having the hardest time washing and it is definitely the right size for you to fit in and…”
The Omega gasped quietly when Steve dipped his head and kissed him, the plates cumbersome between them and the Alpha leaning awkward over the dishes so the sauce wouldn't stain his shirt. He'd been waiting to kiss Tony since the moment the Omega had walked in with his stretchy pants and carefully tied up shirt and now he lingered over it, brushing the bow of Tony's lips and sweeping his tongue only softly at the corner of Tony's mouth.
So instead the Alpha sighed shaky and kissed Tony just one more time. “I had a good time tonight. Will you text me when you get home? Or call me so we can talk? Maybe we could Facetime or--”
“You don’t eat a lot of salad or eat alot of fruit, do you?” The Omega teased. “Pretty sure those come out of the ground and end up tossed on plates.”
“You’re not funny at all.” the Alpha informed him, but she finally smiled a little. “I’m glad no matter your previous experience that you are looking forward to tonight. Nervous but not scared, right?”
“It’s my sanctuary.” The Alpha popped a bite of steak into his mouth, then cut another piece and offered it to Tony despite the little brunette having his own steak on his own plate. Tony still felt just a bit too skinny in Steve’s grip and he was determined to help the Omega gain back everything being sick had sapped from his perfect frame, and then maybe even a little
“One puppy is enough.” the Omega said firmly, but then immediately tried to correct, “And I’m not saying we should get one--!”
“Oh please.” Tony stammered, his hand a blur as it flew over his cock and rushed him closer. “Please please please please--
“And especially when he doesn’t know I have a valid reason for turning him down.” the Omega agreed. “It's not that I don’t want to go to a last minute concert or an art show, but I can’t just throw clothes on and run out the door. Even if it worked with my work schedule-- which is never does-- what about Pete?”
. “That was a bad day for sure, but it’s also the day you trusted me, the day I got to ask you to stay and to meet Pete-- in a lot of ways, that day was the best day of my life and I just can’t punch a fella for that.”
“St-Steve--” First Tony clutched at Steve's shirt, then flattened his hand to smooth at Steve's chest, up over the solid mass of the Alpha's pecs and along the breadth of the wide shoulders before finally looping his arms around Steve's neck and pulling him in tight. “
“Of course not.” Tony tucked the edge of the blanket in around Peter’s feet and bounced the toddler gently as Peter snuffled and clutched at his shirt, a few startled tears leaking from the corner of his eyes. “Steve has no idea.”
“I um--” Tony cleared his throat, heart sinking a bit realizing that Steve wouldn’t be in town for his birthday, sinking
“Not in the least.” Tony spread his hands at Steve’s flat stomach, dragged his palms up the muscled abdomen and over Steve’s chest then grabbed at Steve’s shirt collar with both hands and yanked his boyfriend right down until they were eye to eye, nose to nose. “Oh, I’m not making fun of you in the least.”
“That and forty dollar tips from Alphas you’ll never see again?” Clint suggested and Tony smiled a little, “Yeah, that too. Thank you, Clint.”
, Bucky.” Steve grimaced. “Just cos you made it a life mission to knot up any Omega who looked your way before you found Tasha doesn’t mean the rest of us need to. You know I don’t just hook up, I’ve never slept with anyone I wasn’t in a relationship with.”
“Oh you poor thing.” Clint teased as Tony snatched Peter up and smothered the baby into a long hug. “Had to stay the night
. Like bonding and maybe community. Like we all have the same memories associated with the color even though that doesn’t make any sense. It’s powerful and bold and
Tony dug the tips of his fangs into his bottom lip as he thought about how to respond. He could just send a smiley face or something generic and end the conversation and do some dishes
“Pretty Omega.” Steve rumbled, sucking at Tony’s tongue and gripping the Omega’s little waist, the curve of his hip and rise of his rear. “Sweet perfect Omega. You have no idea how crazy I am about you.”
The Alpha pulled away to press a kiss to Tony’s nose, to his cheek, to the Omega’s forehead, nosing through the longish curls and sighing shakily when Tony plastered himself in against his chest, hugging Steve tight around his neck. “And it’s okay, you don’t have to say any thing back, that’s not why I brought you up here and showed you the painting, but I just wanted you to hear it, alright? Nothing-- nothing too serious and not me expecting anything back I just wanted you to hear it. I am
in the Omega’s throat. Tony sat perched on the toilet lit in his tiny bathroom, eyes closed and phone held tight so he could imagine he was sitting next to Steve watching the light play across those gorgeous blue eyes and he knew-- he
The last box was intimate wear, and Steve paused in eating to watch Tony carefully as the Omega rifled through the dozen matching pairs of beautiful panties and lacy camisoles, shorty shorts that would cut high over Tony’s ass, and chemise style nightwear that would be transparent against the Omega’s skin. There were two robes, a lighter one for summer time and a warmer one for the winter, coordinating slippers for each and several pairs of ankle length pajama bottoms from satiny smooth to thicker cotton.
“I messaged you because I liked your smile.” Steve said after they’d walked for almost twenty minutes in the evening air. “You’re pretty enough to make me feel a little stupid--” Tony snorted a laugh, then coughed to try and cover it and Steve thought maybe it was the cutest thing he’d ever seen. “-- but in your picture you weren’t showing off, you weren’t made up or
wanted aside and regardless of how little they’d seen of each other lately, Steve had invited him over to get to know the friend group so the Omega leaned away and repeated, “As ready as I’ll ever be. Let’s go.”
as fit as Steve before the Alpha was sitting back and tugging the comfortable sweater over Tony’s shoulders and tossing it towards the window seat.
“Oh man, that was super convincing.” the other Alpha said flatly. “Wow just-- just super convincing. Super convinced me Stevie. Disregard all my other questions, you’re totally convincingly
by the casually lewd way Tony talked about their bedroom activities. “First of all, I would never try and choke you in bed, that’s insane. And second of all, ‘unloading’ would mean--”
Tony clumsily pulled him down for one kiss and then another and Steve stayed hovering at the Omega’s side until Tony wasn’t trembling anymore, until the near brittle emotion in the Omega’s dark eyes had softened to open affection.
but held himself back at the last second. He’d never heard of an Omega who hadn’t wanted settled but he’d never done a sugar daddy thing either so maybe this was… normal. “You still with me?”
But with Tony and Peter moved in and with two cart fulls of Costco supplies, the space was quickly crammed full with all the purchases and Steve loved it. For so long his house had felt empty, he hadn’t wanted to buy meaningless trinkets, he didn’t have any sentimental items for the shelves but now he had toys for Peter and all of Tony’s supplies and their towels and toiletries and the artwork inspired by Tony hanging in the bedroom and one of Peter’s handprint paintings on the living room wall…
“Yeah.” Tears again, slipping down Tony’s face as he watched Peter exclaim in excitement over the new toy from the dollar store he’d picked up on the way home. “Yeah, I think you’re right.”
good things about this apartment and as the Omega knocked on Apartment 465, both of those things were waiting on the other side of the door.
“Oh.” Steve opened the door to the apartment and stopped right in his tracks, dumbfounded by the change in the usual plain apartment and shocked speechless by what was
“You don’t ever sit on it though, right?” Tony picked up the dropped pillow and hugged it to his chest. “There’s not so much as a butt dent in this thing. Is it brand new?”
Now if only he could find a way to say that without sounding like an awkward, lovesick lunatic that would be
“Good.” Tony stroked over him once, twice more and then pulled away with a devilish smirk at his gorgeous mouth. “Stay tuned, sweetheart.”
“Neither of those things.” Tony checked the clock and sighed cos it was already almost time to get back to work. “That’s not what this is about, Clint. It’s just a job and I’ll only be doing it until me and Pete can get a little ahead in life. Money saved means I can afford the ride to a better job, better job means more money and more money means eventually a better place to live. This thing with Steve is just a means to an end.”
Tony's scent was addicting and the Alpha had another flash of what night soft Tony would be like, the Omega sprawled across pillows with hooded eyes and messy hair and apple blossom scent winding drugging through the air, chamomile both comforting and heady and Steve would so willingly
“Everything okay with Pete?” Clint was back again, dragging up another five gallon bucket to sit next to Tony and peek at his phone. “You look stressed.”
“Outside opinion? Sure. This painting makes me wanna depress-eat a pint of that low fat bullshit Tasha calls ice cream and listen to emo music in my truck from high school.” Bucky snorted, and went to get a piece of pizza. “How much you getting paid for it?”
The Omega swallowed once, twice when his throat was still dry. “Steve, I-- I’m a Stark. My full name is Anthony Edward Carbonell… Stark.”
“Lots of non-typical Alphas become extremely traditional when it comes to families and mates.” Tony said softly, miserably. “And it’s not just me having a kid, it’s about me having Peter when I was so young, about my past and who my family is… there’s so much Steve doesn’t know and now I’m falling in love with him and I’m fucking
“As good as it ever is, which is basically terrible.” Tony looked around the studio again. “Steve, what happened in here? Do I need to apologize for this? Or-- or pay for this?”
“Six is early for dinner for rich people.” Clint scrunched an eyebrow, a hilarious expression when half his face was squished. “Why so early?”
“Yeah Bubba, have another scoop.” Tony refilled Peter’s plate, then leaned against the kitchen counter and texted a little nervously--
“Thank you.” Tony said again, and the other Omega only winked before heading back into the dining room to serve their less offensive customers.
, the usual honey highlights dimmed by the weight of the past. “And I’m fine. I just didn’t realize what it would be like to see him again.”
and the indecision and uncertainty sat heavy on his chest as he made to leave calmly and quietly from the delicate situation, but just as he reached the doorway--
“Look. I’ve only held Peter for a minute and a half but if anything ever happened to him, I would kill everyone in this room and then myself. Is everyone perfectly clear on the situation?”
“I don’t know if I’ll be able to sleep without worrying about him.” The smell of the soup heating on the tiny stove made Tony’s stomach cramp with instant hunger. “But could you maybe hold him just a little bit while I eat?”
when the Omega bent over to pick up a pillow that fell over and that well rounded rear presented itself for a brief moment of perusal.
Tony didn’t answer again and Bucky stared straight out the windshield as he took the road that led to the bridge across to Brooklyn Heights and Steve’s place.
The slip tore between Steve’s fingers, shredded with no effort from the super soldier and the panties did much the same thing, disintegrating in a haze of lust and pure want. On a normal night Steve would have wanted to keep the lingerie on and cherished Tony but tonight he wanted Tony
“Buck.” the blond answered evenly. “You about to apologize for railroading Tony like that? Cos that was
The questions came rapid fire, not necessarily mean but purposefully nosy, not terribly invasive but also pointedly prodding about the Omega that had broken Steve’s years long stretch of
Tony couldn’t have answered if his life depended on it, too stunned by the vulgar language, too busy
Bucky accompanied Steve along with a load of trash down the back street to the dumpster, not because the other Alpha needed
“How about here?” Gentle down the side of Tony’s cheek, along his jaw, to the line of his throat and staying far away from the nape of his neck. “Is here okay?”
Was he so far removed from who he used to be that he couldn’t even hold an Alphas attention? He couldn’t even last a date without them getting bored? Jesus, he was twenty years old and a single dad and already done dating? Regulated to just the gross Alphas at the restaurant trying to cat call him?
“Wait.” the Omega’s heart did something flip floppy, but he tried to ignore it so he could needle, “You want me to mess up in my parenting? Honestly, how dare you?”
“Good.” A couple eggs cracked onto the griddle, Steve seasoning them quickly then adding a sprinkle of cheese since that’s how Tony liked it. “So what, we need to baby proof the place? Is Pete allergic to anything I should get rid of? We can go shopping and set up his room this afternoon if you want.”
The Alpha full body shuddered when he parted Tony’s thighs and found the satin soft skin already wet, clear slick easing the way at Tony’s tight hole and Steve jerked forward with a low growl, rutting against the mattress when Tony whimpered and spread his legs to allow him
Nat nudged her mate gently, and Bucky nodded. He’d known Steve a long time, knew the blond had always wanted a family of his own, knew Steve dreamed about having kids and a home and yard where little ones could play. He
“You already are.” Steve stretched back out in the recliner, pulling Tony down until they were plastered together, the Omega held safe over his heart. “My Omega, my mate.
He exhaled sharply. “I don’t know how to say this without sounding controlling or like a creeper or possessive or whatever. I just want to know that you’re
Howard Stark was a titan of an Alpha. Not so much physically imposing as he was intimidating simply by virtue of his last name, of the tech company he’d built from scratch and the pages of patents that paid residual income in the form of six and seven digit yearly dividends. The Starks were old money,
“I tried to return the watch you gave me.” the Omega admitted, the anger in his scent washing out a little in embarrassment. “And they looked me up and down, decided I
“Pretty Omega.” the Alpha tipped his head and licked over his fangs pointedly, crooned lower and lower until it bottomed out as a
“There’s nothing wrong with knowing what I prefer my fella to wear.” Tony sniffed, but it turned into a moan as Steve nipped at his neck, down over his pulse, when he felt the throb of Steve hardening beneath his rear. “You like when you call you my fella, Steve?”
“You look real pretty tonight, sweetheart.” Steve changed the subject before Tony could respond, nosing at the Omega’s cheek and dotting a kiss to the corner of his mouth. “Don’t know how I’m gonna concentrate with your tummy out like this, all this lace is
that three years ago he’d been a trust fund kid on his way to college and now he was a single parent trying to raise a toddler and pay bills on a shitty apartment while dealing with clients offering him twenty dollar bills if he let them ogle his ass.
“Did you--” Bucky’s sharp fangs glinted when he grimaced again. “Did you recover from the Command okay? No lingering side effects?”
“Oh Tony, he’s gorgeous.” The Alpha swallowed, then swallowed again when the words came dry, his throat suddenly raspy. “Honey, he’s-- he’s perfect. He looks just like you. What a beautiful little guy.”
at me with your heart shining right outta your eyes. It always sort starts here at your throat.” he motioned to his own bonding spot. “And rushes up your face and settles high right here at your eyes and makes them look gold and it’s just about the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen in my life.”
“Gremlin-hobbit-scrooge.” Steve set his paint brush down. “That’s a new one, thanks. I appreciate it better than the one about me being a shut in who should just start adopting cats
“Okay?” Steve waited, and finally Tony swallowed and admitted, “I’ve got to spend more time with Pete in the last few weeks than I have in his entire life. Sleeping in and getting home quickly and not having to work full time-- I’ve never had that option which means I’ve missed a lot of moments with him and you start talking about school which means he’s going to be gone and I-- I--”
With one last peek at Natasha holding Peter and Steve still watching sort of stunned, Tony slipped back towards the foyer to meet with Bucky before he lost all his courage and simply
There had been purposefully leading questions such as ‘what size do you wear in your favorite brand of clothing’ and ‘how would you rate your submissiveness and/or dominance in romantic encounters’ but not much that would allow the one searching to learn anything that mattered on a personal
“Passed a long time ago.” the Omega’s scent dimmed in sadness. “She’d never have let Dad throw me out, but I don’t think Dad would’ve even though about it if she’d been there to change his mind. My Mama kept him…
“Don’t hide in here though.” Valkyrie snagged the tray of devilled eggs and flipped Hope off triumphantly. “Everyone else wants to meet you too, including the super spies. Steve, quit hogging him, come out and play nice.”
If Steve sprinkled in every single not-quite-a-curse word he knew on the way to Costco, well that was just how things were going today. Peter kept laughing at the Alpha pulling increasingly funny faces while spouting things like
“Clint called me that the other night when I tried to tell him forks have four tines and tridents have three, and since we weren’t at the bottom of the sea--”
“No no no, you’re going to say things like I’ll cry realizing how smart you are and then not elaborate?” Steve watched closely as Tony scented at, then slowly sipped the wine. “Do you like it? It’s the same bottle from the steakhouse.”
“I’m really just a private investigator -slash- bounty hunter-slash- on call assassin.” Bucky chimed in. “Which I guess maybe sounds worse then what Tash does, but here we go anyway.”
“I was thinking about preschool again for Pete.” the Alpha began, patting at Tony’s hand when the Omega tensed. “Not that we’re in any rush, because we
Another shudder, and this time Steve’s kiss was desperate and worshipful, his hold at Tony tender and possessive. “Thank you.”
“I missed you.” he rasped and Tony only nodded, knotting his fingers into Steve’s hair and hiding his face in the Alpha’s throat, nosing at the blood spotted bite and trying not to cry with an unexpected wash of emotion. “Sweet Omega, I missed you.”
All of it was awful and a far cry from the Manhattan high rise Tony had spent most of his life in, but there were two
...the resulting silence in the living room was almost terrifying, Steve staring wide eyed and slack jawed at the phone, Bucky waiting with red eyed anticipation for his fierce little wife to respond and the sound a slowly measured breath as Natasha contemplated just which threat to carry out on her giant mate…
Tony was quiet again, and Steve jostled his little mate playfully, “But hey, you know? I wouldn't be
Tony just frowned, and the Alpha insisted, “Tony, there isn’t anything more important and private than kids and even a bunch of hardcore soldiers like my friends know that. When Val and Diana started trying to get pregnant, they didn’t say a damn thing. We didn’t even know the baby had been born. It was a whole year before they were ready to introduce us to the first kid. Kids change everything. So the difference between my friends thinking you’re hiding something-- and mind you,
Tony could hardly stand so Steve just held him, let his cock soften inside the Omega’s perfect body as he kept Tony up against the tiles and felt behind him to turn off the water. He eased out of his Omega slowly, wincing at the loss of heat and then
wasn’t interested in being mentored towards becoming a suitable Omega mate for one of the church members. “It um-- it wasn’t fun.”
“I am, but I wanted to talk to you first.” Steve cleared his throat and shuffled his feet, folded then unfolded his arms, put his hands in his pocket then took them back out to stand in parade rest. “Uh, Tony I wanted to ask you if you uh-- if you had anything. Like what you asked me the other day. In-- in bed.”
“Say all that a little bit louder.” Tony popped his fangs and scowled. “I’m not sure the guy at table three heard you talking about how I haven’t been laid in almost a month, that’s fine.”
“Bug’s awake.” Tony’s apple blossom scent sweetened apologetically as he tried to soothe his Alpha with another kiss. “That’s my cue to turn back into Dad. Sorry. Rain check?”
Tony lay on the bed as long as he dared, past the sound of Steve getting water and past the sound of food being delivered and Steve coming to knock on the door and let him know.
“Steve.” The Omega turned the envelope over in his hands a few times. “Steve um what--” another hard swallow because Tony thought he could be suffocating with the weight over
how had Tony never noticed that despite hours of scrubbing and spending precious dollars on higher quality cleaning, the floor was a hopeless shade of dismal
“I’m not worried about dinner.” The big blond adjusted the Live, Laugh, Love pillow just a half inch towards center and then moved on to arrange the flowers he’d had delivered special for tonight. “My Ma’s Third Date Spaghetti never fails.”
“Where’s Tony?” Steve ignored Bucky’s outstretched hand and tried to push past into the living room, nostrils flaring when he caught burnt chamomile and the withering scent of faded apple blossom in the air. “Bucky, where’s Tony?! Where is he!”
But all of this was for Peter and for their future. The extra money tonight would go a long way towards helping him get ahead of next months rent and the
It was a different nurse at the Urgent Care this time, but Tony didn’t catch her name. The Omega hadn’t hardly slept in the three almost four days since the last visit, sitting up through the night listening to Peter cough and worrying through out the day when the fever kept coming back and the toddler couldn’t manage more than a few sips of liquid at a time.
“I might be an old woman now, but I spent more than my fair share of days in my younger years tying up my shirt to show off my belly button.” She informed him, smoothing out the collar so it showed a hint more of his collarbones and throat. “It’s all in how you roll the hemline-- tight enough to hold the tail ends trapped but smooth enough to look flush against your skin.”
Tony bit at his lip in anticipation when Steve closed the bedroom door and started towards the bed, yanking at buttons carelessly and tossing his belt somewhere on the other side of the room.
Tony sucked in a sharp breath, and the Alpha finished in a near whisper, well aware he’d just crossed a line but not willing to go back on it. “I just want to take care of you, sweetheart.”
projects, the drawings and paintings that were inspired by life or dreams instead of bought and paid for, the sketches he’d scribbled on napkins when an idea struck and now worked to convert into something real.
built into an Alpha’s biology to reject any kid that isn’t theirs.” Tony whispered so Peter wouldn’t over hear. The toddler wouldn’t understand but it still felt awful to say the words out loud. “Steve is one of the best men I’ve met in my life, but it is central to his most
“If it were a big deal or even the slightest bit sketchy, there wouldn’t be an app for it.” Clint countered flatly. “Invalid point. Any other objections? Because all that’s standing between you and making sure you never have to count pennies for Pete’s diapers anymore is schmoozing up to some rich Alpha.”
. Put it in a lipstick or nail polish and the woman or Omega wearing it can take on the world. You know, if a color could fly? It would be hot rod red with maybe a little splash of gold. That color could own the sky if the sky wasn’t already blue.”
Tony did another one of those snort laughs that Steve found so charmingly honest, and encouraged, he suggested-- “What if you just think about it? One extra evening a week isn’t all that much time out of your schedule, I hope. And it wouldn’t have to be an evening, we could meet in the morning or for lunch or anything like that.”
“So.” Steve groaned just a bit when the Omega pulled away from him, but not willing to risk another walk in, he quieted the instinct to snatch his almost mate back. “I’m going to try and scrub the gravy pan. You pull down the waffle pan and we’ll switch directions for breakfast, then maybe we can talk about a shopping trip for rings?”
“You kicked me off the phone plan when I left.” Tony interrupted, not angry just factual. “Just like you locked me out of my bank accounts and changed the codes at all the houses. How was I supposed to afford the phone bill so you could call and check on me?”

Peggy had asked that morning when he’d called to check in and ask for her help, and Tony had looked over at where Peter was happily playing on plush carpet and where Steve was headed his way with a second cup of coffee, a bite of french toast and a smile, and answered, ‘
Tony’s elated laughter over being called beautiful even in a potato sack devolved into a throaty moan when Steve’s tongue thrust past his lips and tangled with his own. The Alpha pressed forward deeper, clutched Tony up tighter and dragged the Omega’s head back so he could taste
Peter ran from spot to spot in the park as Steve and Tony walked the paved, meandering sidewalk and kept a close eye on the toddler, snapping pictures with their phones and interrupting their own conversation to answer the myriad of questions Pete had about the birds around or the squirrel still snatching at food or the other people that wandered by.
If it weren’t for Peter the Omega would have given up long ago, if it weren’t for messy smiles and droolly kisses and the unbridled enthusiastic love of a two year old, Tony didn’t know if he would have made it to twenty one at all, he would have let this life tear him apart and cast him aside.
pleased to know she could afford to pay half of it with her pension and said thank you very much for paying the other half.”
Tony raised his eyebrows and the Alpha admitted self consciously, “And no, I don’t think I’ve ever actually sat on it.”
A self conscious, miserable shrug. “I’ve never used an Alpha Command in my life, Tony. I’ve got an Alpha mate which means those things don’t work on Tasha and I value my knot too much to even try. But I am

“Ummm how about strawberry?” Strawberry was Peter’s favorite flavor, and though the milkshake would be melted by the time Tony got home, the baby could sip at the strawberry milk tomorrow morning as a special treat.
When Bucky had spent weeks trying to come up with a way for his pal to get un-lonely and to get very much
Now dinner was over, milkshakes finished and Peter checked on one last time because it was bath time and Tony needed to know Nat had found the exact right rubber ducky, and Steve’s blue eyes were darkening towards scarlet with every passing moment, Tony tonguing purposefully flirtatiously over the sharp points of his little fangs as his core quivered in response to the hormones pouring off the huge Alpha.
. Tony was almost completely covered tonight but he could have been naked for all Steve couldn’t look away, the black leggings distracting and the cream colored sweater falling off one bare shoulder tantalizing. His hair was fluffed up and a little messy and the Omega looked
“Beauty.” the Alpha was feeling a little unsteady himself, but he pushed it aside so he could keep reassuring Tony, keep crooning praise and adoration into the Omega’s ear until it was only remnants of pleasure causing Tony’s breath to hitch. “Damn, I wasn’t ready for that. I missed you.”
The stretch of Steve’s knot inside him made Tony scream, made the Omega arch up and gush wet and he bared his neck and
“Tash, who’ve you got there?” Bucky crouched down next to Natasha’s chair and crooned at Peter encouragingly. “Hey there big guy. I’m Bucky and I’m the cool Uncle no matter what Sam says when you meet him. Wanna c’mere and say hi?”
?” Tony asked in bewilderment, and Steve repeated, “Big ol’ rock, Tony. I don’t even go on boats just in case I fall out. Not scared of sharks, scared of my big ass dropping to the sea floor like an anvil and them not being able to find me. I don’t even take baths. Rather just stay away from it altogether. Do
“Added.” she confirmed. “What’s Steve doing now? How many times has he rearranged the throw pillows on that ridiculously ugly couch?”
, my mate.” Steve forced Tony into his arms that time, held onto Peter tight but held onto Tony tighter, arm like a steel band at Tony’s waist so the Omega wouldn’t pull away and try to grieve by himself. “Come
Steve wants a family, a mate and kids included. But you’re only twenty messing around with an Alpha in his mid thirties. Are you interested in anything like that or just wasting Steve’s time?”
“They would have put you in an Omega home if they couldn’t force you back to your Dad’s house.” Steve guessed, and Tony finished, “And then take Peter away from me no matter what, because the state run Omega shelters aren’t good places for kids. And even if
handle her. I think it’s like that movie with the raptors and the trainer--” Tony started laughing for real, slim shoulders shaking with amusement. “--and the one called Blue? I think Tasha’s
Tony flashed his little fangs in an amused grin. “I think I’d pay good money to see you in full protective flotation gear. Do you wear just the arm floaties and life vest or is there an inner tube around your waist too?”
“Honestly?” Tony’s eyebrows raised almost imperceptibly when the waiter reappeared with a menu but only handed it to Steve, clearly assuming the Alpha would be ordering for the two of them. “I think my parameters for availability were so strict, I eliminated myself from most searches before anyone could find me.”
, and the Alpha’s chest clenched up with longing when Tony stood on his toes by the stove and lifted the lid on the pot to smell the sauce, then made a surprised noise of excitement and anticipation that made everything else clench up as well.
“Tear them.” Tony whispered, gaze molten and lips red from being bitten. “Tear them babe, you don’t have to careful. We don’t have to keep them on, I’ll buy more. Tear these ones if you want to. You don’t have to be careful.”
It was more difficult than Tony expected to open the door and physically step back into his old life. It had been a long weekend at Steve’s townhome, calling out of work so he could spend three wonderfully relaxed days with Peter, food and snacks whenever he wanted and luxurious wine at the ready, a bed so soft Tony was asleep within seconds at night and slow kisses over a perfectly prepared cup of coffee in the morning and now Tony had to physically step
After his rushed shower as the Omega patted dry with a too thin towel and tried to focus enough through a migraine to figure out what he and Peter were going to try and eat for dinner, he realized his phone was ringing and
“Pete? C’mere Bug, come meet someone.” Tony took Peter carefully from Peggy and held him out for Natasha. “This is Natasha, she’s one of Steve’s friends.”
, Clint. I’m so used to being invisible to everyone here at the diner, or trying to be invisible so no one tries to mess with me that I forgot what it was like to just exist. I wasn’t stressed about my laundry, wasn’t counting quarters, no one was looking at me and Pete like we didn’t belong… I actual felt human.”
“Yes, yes a third date would be great.” Steve looked more excited by the prospect of a third date than he did about the prospect of
“You’d climb up on a stool and slap me silly if I tried to settle you in public, but you’re gonna offer to do it for me?” Clint scoffed, but when Tony’s frown deepened, the big Omega finally relented and nodded a little bit. “Please, babe? I’m havin’ a real hard time lately.”
“Yeah okay.” Tony let himself fall pliant into the Alpha’s arms, let Steve take his whole weight and floated for a moment in steady cedar and warm rosewood. “This… this is good.”
“Okay but hear me out.” Clint made his blue eyes very wide, the bandaid at his cheek making the expression comical. “What if you
“You were the customer on the phone.” Any color left in Tony’s face abruptly disappeared, and he washed alarmingly pale. “Clint kept saying how weird it was for someone to call for a reservation and that you’d asked sort of pointed questions while flirting with him. Was that you? That was
“I um--” Steve rubbed at the back of his neck uncertainly, not sure where to begin but thinking maybe absolute honesty was the best segue into this particular conversation. “Well
“I’d probably pay money to see that.” the Alpha grinned, flashing his fangs. “But every time I think about what Bucky did and try to get mad about it anymore… all I end up thinking about is how everything shitty about that day led to you telling me you loved me.”
It was two weeks before the next date and Tony had to make the money stretch just in case Pete’s stomach was still upset and he had to miss work, or if he couldn't pick up as many shifts before rent was due again. It baffled him how even
“You called me when you were sick and told you didn’t have any food in the house.” Worry creased at Steve’s brow and strained in his scent. “You had to work doubles for most of the next two weeks to make sure you could pay your bills even after I helped. I am more than happy to let you use my debit card for groceries sweetheart, I’m more than happy to set you up with a debit card of your own so you never have to worry about it again but I can’t-- I
“Hostility much?” Bucky frowned at his friend but obediently removed his feet. “What’s with the marathon cleaning, you just had that crew in here t’vacuum your drapes and fluff your pillows or whatever other hoity toity stuff you rich people do. Why are you going batshit with a feather duster and why aren’t you wearin’ a French maid outfit while doin’ it? I feel like I’m missin’ out on a free show here.”
“Stop.” Tony put a hand over his mate’s mouth and sighed in relief and adoration when Steve immediately nuzzled at his palm and kissed his fingers. “Let’s start with one and go from there, huh?”
“You sleep furthest from the door.” Steve shucked his pants and settled in under the blankets, carefully handing Tony the glass of wine. “At the risk of sounding traditional and old fashioned again, I need to be closest to the door so if anything happens, I’m between you and any danger.”
“Where did you grow up?” Steve found another green chili on his burger and dropped it on Tony's plate, not because he hated them but because Tony so obviously
“The stained glass pictures in the old churches all use this color.” Steve pulled up a picture on his phone and showed it to Tony. “Most classical art uses this color and I love the idea of something that was never meant to exist, something that happened by
“Ain’t no thang.” Bucky let only the slightest bit of rumble into his words and watched through the lenses as the mouthy Omega straightened up and flushed a little red. “You sound more like my type anyway.”
been inconsistent? Has he ever been anything except sorta dorky and super honest and good ol’ boy sincere?”
as he thought about everything in college he’d missed out on. “Want a degree for your trophy husband?”
Natasha and Bucky both hugged Tony before leaving, holding the Omega tight and reminding him in a fierce whisper that he was family and that they were sorry for not knowing what was going on before and if Steve was ever stupid enough to make him angry, he and Pete could just live at their place.
“Pete’s my entire life.” Tony set his phone back down and left a flurry of kisses on Peter’s cheekies until the baby laughed and tried to squirm away from the tickles. “And what's going on with Steve is just an arrangement. Sugar Seeking Sugar. I can’t let myself fall in love if it will affect our life in any sort of negative way, I just can’t take the chance.”
“I want to be an absolute Bridezilla in like, May.” Tony hiccuped over a not quite muffled sob. “When the cedars are leafing out or-- or you know, my Mama’s wedding pictures are all in the cherry blossoms, I’d like something like that too. But I want to bond this weekend. I want to pick up a few things first and I’d like to go away to a hotel for the night so I don’t have to worry about Peter but I want to be yours this weekend. Friday. Two days from now.”
“I know I am.” he replied calmly. “But even James Bond Level good looks like mine can’t counter an Alpha’s ego being bruised cos I’m taller and stronger than they are. Facts is facts, Tony. Besides, they told me the money wasn’t for me, at which point I asked them to guess what I’d done to their pie and
Tony’s shoulders were shaking, chest heaving as he clutched at his mate’s jacket and tried to disappear into the warmth, tried to bury himself somewhere safe where the memories and almost forgotten pain couldn’t reach him.
“Okay.” she laughed under her breath. “Okay, lets start telling the story a little more romantic than that, but sure. Clint’s a big Omega. Maybe we just
“Yeah see, I knew that was the wrong thing to say the second it left my mouth.” Steve groaned. “No Tony, you don’t look older and even if you did it’s not-- it’s not like it's a bad thing. When I said you were beautiful, I sure as hell meant it and Omegas like you don’t stand a chance at aging badly so--”
“I think those are about two of the best words I’ve ever heard.” Steve rested his chin on Tony’s head and held his mate tight while Tony cried quietly, gratefully, against him. In the doorway, Peggy watched with tears in her own eyes and Steve smiled at her before dropping a kiss into the Omega’s hair and rumbling gently to hush him. “Both those things sound real good to me, sweetheart. Thank you.”
coloring the words, “So long as we’re being honest with each other, I’m not really a fan of these restaurants either. I know it’s expected for the Alpha to order for an Omega in a place like this, and you did a good job ordering for me, but you should know if you ever try to do it again, I’ll throw my overpriced wine at you.”
“You are so beautiful.” Steve barely remembered to hit most of the lights as he passed, hurrying to kneel at Tony’s side and kiss him again. “So so so beautiful, what a perfect pretty Omega, I am so lucky.”
, moving slow and purposefully up his leg, crinkling the dress material on his way to Tony’s thigh. “Um, sort of ridiculously nice. Where you headed there, Captain? Going on little journey?”
“Well I mean--” Steve gestured vaguely, helplessly. “What part of ‘you’re everything I want and need’ aren’t you getting? I don’t need anything other than what we do right here. End of story.”
“Oh my god.” Tony touched his mouth where it still tingled, and the Alpha swooped in to peck another soft kiss at his cheek. “Steve…”
me because the more I thought about asking you to stay, I didn’t want you to ever feel like you were staying because you have to, cos I pay the bills or because you were more or less kidnapped from your old place and won’t be able to get it back. I heard what you said about how your last name and social eliminates any help from the government, how your only choice without me or a similar arrangement would be an Omega house and probably having to give Peter up but

a second-- Steve let himself admire just how beautiful the Omega was with color high in his cheeks and rightly deserved fury in his gaze.
The Alpha opened the door slowly, measuring his steps and making sure his hands were open at his sides, shoulders dropped and tone settled as he came in. He was sure Tony had overheard the fight in the foyer, sure the little Omega had heard him roar and growl and the
“Okay.” That meant more to Steve than it probably should have, and he had to swallow a pleased rumble. “Seventeen, huh?”
"Steve.” Tony looped his arms around the Alpha’s neck and hugged him right back, propping up onto his toes to trill into Steve’s ear. “Thanks for inviting me.”
“Steve.” Tony held up his phone by way of explanation. “He invited me to a thing with his friends and I just-- I am running out of ways to turn him down for these sort of things. He’s never upset or asks why I don’t ever accept the invites but....”
, Tony adored him so much. “Pete! We can have the teddy bear! Pick out which color you want and I’ll put the rest away, okay?”
...Tony was still boneless when the Alpha lifted out of him and went to clean up, an arm tossed over his eyes and the sheets pulled up to his waist. He startled when Steve came back with a washcloth and a half shy, “In case you didn’t want to walk to the bathroom to clean up.”
“Not at all.” Tony gestured briefly to his own unbuttoned collar and the lace scarf tucked into his shirt. “I’m not wearing a tie.”
Tony fought against a smile when he placed the plate down in front of Steve, and the Captain grabbed at his wrist to hold him still. “...where the evening takes us. Something on your mind, Mr. Rogers?”
“Dada?” a little voice down the hall put an end to whatever Steve was going to say. “Dada? Awake! Bug’s awake!”
“Stop.” Tony pointed a finger at him over Peter’s head. “This was the longest I’ve been away from my baby, and yeah okay, that sort of made shopping torture. Steve was talking about which shade of pink he thinks I could pull off and all I could think about was how I’ve only seen Peter for an hour in the last day.”
“Peggy’s already started a poker club with some of the building residents because she decided Bingo was too boring.” the Omega chuckled softly. “She loves the new place, was
into the air surrounding herself and her mate Bucky. Hope was nice enough but there was no denying the intelligence and readiness in her gaze, Valkyrie was a mess but even while doing body shots off of Diana’s shockingly toned abs the Beta’s razor sharp focus and concentration never wavered.
The diner was consistently busy even for being a hole in the wall with visibly iffy menu choices, and Tony and Clint spent the entire time running back and forth between the customers and kitchen, bussing their own tables and mopping up any messes, and at one point Clint ducked behind the line and cooked for a solid half hour when the other cook decided to take a break and not put out any more dishes for a while.
and the morning after pill not taking… well that’s not your fault, Tony. It happens all the time. You shouldn’t punish yourself with a lonely life just because of a few unfortunate circumstances, you’re not even twenty one, that’s far too young to commit to a life of celibacy because of a mistake.”
“Steve at some point in the near future I’m going to make endless fun of you for becoming the boring dad literally within

“Here’s a list of items you’ll need to pick up to make sure the baby doesn’t need a repeat visit.” She tore off a list and handed it to Tony stiffly. “Pedialyte to help with his fluid intake, baby Tylenol to break the fever and a few other items. I would
“It’s way more tame than you’d think.” Tony tipped his head towards the roadster where it sat gleaming on a raised platform near the back of the garage. “I’ve spent the better part of the last twenty years restoring the Ford Flathead. Custom paint job, I built every piece of the engine, I learned how to upholster so if there’s ever a tear I can fix it myself. That thing is the closest I’ll ever get to having a child, and by
Bucky had to close his eyes and lock his entire body down so he wouldn’t react instinctive to the physical challenge of a fight. Alpha to Alpha, pound for pound he and Steve were evenly matched but Steve would be fighting for the sake of the Omega he loved which meant Bucky would be fighting for his
Tony’s heart was galloping in his chest, pounding loud enough he thought for sure the Alpha could hear it in the relative quiet of the street. Steve’s hand was rough, calloused and strong and Tony’s own fingers felt small, safe held in his grasp. Holding hands was innocent to the point of being chaste but right there in the moment, Tony didn’t know if anything with an Alpha had ever been more exciting…
“Why weren’t you going to be here in the morning?” Steve prodded gently. “You know you’re welcome here anytime, Tony. I feel like I’ve begged you to come over more and stay, you know you’re welcome here.”
Steve would be seeing any of this, and his hands tightened on the steering wheel preparing to speed up and snatch an unsuspecting Omega into his car just so he wouldn’t have to explain to his best friend why he let Tony walk alone through some god awful street after sunset.
“They screamed at you?” Peggy’s faded eyes twitched scarlet in a flash of her own fury. “Are you serious?”
to settle. Between Omegas, the firm touch meant only safety and security and when Tony reached to rub circles at Clint’s nape, the blond nearly crumpled, head bowing and tremors running through his body.
It might have been day four or it might have been day five when Peter finally started sleeping for more than a half hour at a time, and the first stretch of few hours where the toddler wasn’t waking crying or coughing, the Omega peeled himself off the bed and stumbled towards the tiny bathroom for his first shower in days.
“Diana and Valkyrie are active duty full time. They still get deployed for specific missions, but most of their time they spend training new recruits at the base so they can be close to home.” Steve squeezed at Tony’s waist, grateful for the kiss when he’d been vulnerable. “Hope and Scott work for a super secret branch of the government and you can’t repeat that, or men in black suits will show up to take you away. Sam’s in the Reserve and works at the veteran’s center as a counselor. Bucky got his private investigators license and is both an investigator and sort of the world’s scariest bounty hunter when certain government branches lose track of people on the Most Wanted Lise and Natasha…”
Putting everything away at the brownstone was actually super fun. Steve had so much extra space in his house that most days it had been slightly depressing thinking the Alpha had nothing to fill his home with.
“Steve.” Tony set his wine glass down and kissed the Alpha again before Steve could start talking about future dates and overnights and spending an amount of time together that Tony wasn’t sure would ever actually happen. “I just worked a ten hour shift and then ran the gauntlet with your friends. Why don’t you just hold me and let me sleep for a while and we can talk in the morning?”
of us should be getting laid, and if it’s not me then it should be you.” the Omega interrupted. “Your ass is so neglected lately, it’s practically drooping. It’s physically making me sad. Physically making me sad with how much it’s drooping from a lack of loving.”

“I was home this morning.” Tony’s tone sharpened. “And then I went to work. My babysitter texted that Peter was running a fever so I came right home and brought him in.”
“Goddamn you’re so beautiful like this.” Steve’s fingers skittered towards and then away from the nape of Tony’s neck, the urge to

.” the Alpha’s shoulders slumped in relief when he found Tony waiting in the foyer, the Uber app open on his phone as he waited for the car. “Hey baby, I’m glad you’re still here. After all that, I thought you’d run for the hills. Hell, after all that
As they stood and waited for the car, Steve started singing under his breath, “It’s a beautiful day in the neighborhood, a beautiful day for a neighbor, would you be mine, could you be mine…?”
“Do you want yourself an educated Omega, Mr. Rogers?” Tony tried to tease, but his chamomile scent shuttered in
Tony only had three dollars to last him until the next shift at the diner and no, the Omega didn’t want to laugh at the ludicrousy of it all, he wanted to throw his head back and
“I’m sure you’re great, I’d still love to hear you play if you ever felt up to it. By the way, the Oreo milkshake is the best, but get whichever one you want.” Steve pointed to a picture of a milkshake piled high with cookie pieces. “We can get it to go too, you don’t have to drink it all here.”
“I am in the market for another piece of garlic bread.” Tony answered playfully. Steve had no idea just how much he
So the Alpha gulped back the rest of his bratwurst and fumbled for napkins so his face wasn’t greasy, then straightened his jacket and readied himself to jog over and try not to freak Tony out by approaching him randomly in public--
“Now then.” Steve set his empty plate aside and clasped his hands between his knees. “What else do you need?”
“Steve, I would like to see more of you too.” A whole truth. “And not just for the money.” Another whole truth and it
“I didn’t tell a joke.” Tony yanked his apron off and used the one clean corner to scrub at his face before tossing it into the laundry and retrieving a fresh one. “Trust me, there was
“Okay.” the Alpha reached to cover Tony’s hand with his own, weaving their fingers together and lifting Tony’s hand to kiss his knuckles. “No problem. We just won’t talk about it. Please don’t scent so sad, sweetheart. I’m sorry I even brought it up.”
“Sort of shockingly handsome in an overgrown Midwestern sort of way, yes.” Tony’s pants were more spandex than anything else, a pair of dark blue stretch jeggings he’d snagged from the juniors section that made his booty look all sorts of
“He’s perfect.” Steve’s throat closed up with tears as he held physical evidence of just how much Tony loved him, how much Tony accepted him and
“I don’t think I’ve ever been so horrified by anything you’ve ever said in my life.” Steve rolled away from his easel for a piece of greasy, cheesy pizza. “Muses and artists don’t always sleep together, artists aren’t all slutty and art isn’t all horny, where did you even
“What the hell is that about?” Clint was filling in for the cook today, and he flipped a row of burgers on the flattop before checking on his friend. “I’ve heard all your jokes and none of them are good enough to make a table laugh that hard, what happened?”
Without the thought of eggshells and midnight hanging over his head, the next time Steve looked up from across the breakfast table and asked hopefully, “What if we go furniture shopping for Pete today? Get him that car bed and maybe a few things for around the house?--
The first box was full of but tops, comfortable t shirts in saturated jewel tones and a few pastels that would look gorgeous against Tony’s dark hair and eyes, long sleeves in various weights that would be perfect for the still cool nights and heavier ones for the change of seasons to autumn. There were button ups in slim fit cuts, lace at the collars and delicate, Omega-styled details that spoke of designer quality and boutique prices, and cashmere sweaters with low vee necks or wide collars to show off Tony’s throat.
, and he tugged them up a little higher so the waistband disappeared beneath the tied up shirt. They were just structured enough to hide any the little bit of curve he hadn’t managed to lose after Peter but easy enough to get in and out of to avoid any malfunctions, which made them perfect date night material. “Blond hair, blue eyes, big arms, bigger shoulders, all that sort of thing. He’s got an ass I could bounce a quarter off of, which is good cos
that Omega is less than impressed with how you handled Tony.” Natasha kept staring after Clint, green eyes ringing admiring red as she watched him play with Peter and laugh up at something Tony said. “Can’t say I blame him, I briefly thought about poisoning you.”
“Okay but I um…” Tony plucked at his shirt uncomfortably, smoothed down the apron at his waist and lowered his voice further so none of the diner patrons would hear them. “Clint, I’m not pretty enough to be a sugar baby. Maybe before having Pete, but afterwards--”
“Why don't you grab those plates and take them to the dining room, I'll bring the wine and bread. Do you want candles? I couldn't decide if those were romantic or a cliché.”
“Harder.” Tony panted out loud, squirmed in excitement when Steve grabbed at his hips to hold him down and pulled suckling at his chest. “Steve–!
“Oh no, I’m real aware that my Dad is a certified asshole.” Tony set his water down so he could get a bandaid for Steve’s palm. “I’m just saying, if Mama would have been here, things would have been different. But she isn’t, and things aren’t different, and there’s no use dwelling on it.”
“Alright, so I’d cry after losing trivia night.” he said instead. “Now tell me what’s wrong with my second shelf.”
why you’re still blushing and looking a little horny stupid around the edges.” Clint picked up the coffee Tony had bought him on the way home and
that was walking at Tony’s side, a little tyke of no more than two, pudgy hands grasping at the Omega’s fingers and face upturned to either one of the adults and lit up with a grin. He had Tony’s nose and the Omega’s bewitching smile and Tony bent to pick the toddler up as they crossed the road and kissed the little one’s cheek like he did it every damn day of his life.
. Steve abandoned the paintbrush so he could grip at his cock when it throbbed in immediate response to the text, to the image the words brought to mind, to the memory of just how sweetly slick Tony had scented while they kissed.
“I’m certainly serious about your naming privileges being revoked after this one.” Tony scrunched his nose and grinned. “Archibald is the worst name in the world, but you siad you liked it, so we’ll compromise on
Tony just kissed him instead of answering, grateful when it worked and Steve’s smile widened towards a little bit goofy.
There was no living room to speak of, of course, just dingy linoleum squares running abruptly into thin carpet that had been obviously carefully cleaned but was a solid decade past when it needed replacing. The bathroom hidden behind a door nearly off its hinges boasted a shower that wouldn’t fit a full grown Alpha, a toilet that was running constantly and a low sink with a locker-sized mirror hanging on the wall. Everything was clean and tidy but there was no disguising the consistent neglect the studio had been through in the previous years, stains on the walls that looked like water damage and a give and squeak to the floor that spoke of termites and maybe even rot.
“Me?” Tony’s hands stilled, the silverware falling silent as he stared up at the artwork, the ivory petals and brilliant honey gold tracing the edges of geometric shapes, strong lines and sweeping curves, a half dozen shades of red from hot rod red through brilliant scarlet and the autumn toned blaze of cedar. “
“Okay.” Steve took a deep breath in, and exhaled through his nose. “Okay, Tony here’s the thing-- I haven’t worn a tie in months.”
needed to be held and cuddled close and kissed and taken care of so instead he broke down a little and
“Omega, I'm not trying to get you drunk.” Steve chuckled and dropped the noodles in the water. “But I wouldn't mind finding out if I like the taste of wine when it's still all over your lips.”
“Damn.” Clint didn’t really know what to say to that, so he changed the subject. “Uh Nat, what’s data collecting?”
“It’s beautiful.” Tony whispered, and Steve whispered back, “You’re beautiful, my Omega. I love you.”
with this mouth.” Tony looped his arms around the Alpha and yanked him in for a real kiss, a messy kiss, teeth and tongue and fangs biting sharp until they tasted arousal tinted blood. Steve groaned through it, sealed his mouth at Tony’s bottom lip and sucked hard, grinding his cock forward into the Omega’s soft body until Tony mewled and gasped and stood on his toes trying to draw it out longer.
“I’m sorry, Omega.” was the first thing Bucky said as he loaded the rest of the supplies into the car and turned to find Tony huddled in the furthest seat, a restless Peter clutched too tight to his chest. “I didn’t mean to use one’a them on you, I can’t even tell ya the last time I used one’a those at all. I just wanna get you outta here and somewhere safe and we-- we can figure all that out later, kay?”

“You didn’t do any of that.” The Alpha pointed out. “You barely even snarled when you had every right to scream.”
“So I was thinking about how to pay you for our dates--” the Alpha started then abruptly shut the hell up when Tony coughed water out of his nose in shock. “Oh damn, sorry do you need a napkin? I swear there’s no good ways to talk about this sort of thing without it sounding shocking and terrible!”
should keep it anyway Buy yourself something else with the watch money and then tell me about it. It was a gift, Tony. That means you get to keep all of it.”
“Next year you can just go with me and we’ll do something special for it.” Steve pressed a kiss to Tony’s temple. “My parents have a bunch of land and the entire family stays for most of a week-- it will be fun.”

“I can't have that sort of conversation when I've got you up on the counter and I'm halfway to knotting up in my uh-- ” Steve made a gesture towards his pants, then winced. “Which is rude to mention but uh--yep. Sorry.”
“I love you too.” Steve kissed Peter’s head and then Tony’s curls, over and over. “I love you so much. And hey, we can have the biggest, most out of control Christmas you can imagine okay? We’ll start planning it now.”
“Cheating.” Tony repeated flatly. “For my super hunky boyfriend with the stamina of a herd of stallions to engage in a little movie related voyeurism while touching himself with his own hand in the privacy of his own room.”
okay?” the Alpha got close enough to scent the misery hanging around Tony’s shoulders and she crooned under her breath at him. “Oh sweetheart, what’s wrong?”
He was stunning, almost breathtakingly beautiful and Steve audibly gulped when he clicked the picture to see it up close. “Tony.” he breathed. “
The kitchen dissolved into laughter when Steve barreled through to clean up the mess looking as exactly stern and judgy as Sam had warned, and
By the time he returned, Clint had taken over one of the cleaner booths with his pile of food, and Tony hurried over to meet him, sliding into the booth and budging up close to his friend.
“Never.” Steve promised, and bent to leave one more kiss at his Omega’s lips before Tony lost himself in the steady, intimate pleasure. “I’ll always be right here.”
“No no no, wait beauty, just wait--” Steve cursed and cursed as he slipped from the heat of Tony’s mouth but he wouldn’t
“Thank you for this.” He whispered again as Tony was drifting off to sleep. “For being so beautiful and bringing a part of my old life here and letting me be open and honest with you. I couldn’t want anything else than this right here.”
“Trust me, the tie is really that bad.” The Alpha switched the bag of food to the other hand so he could offer his arm for Tony as they stepped from the sidewalk into the street. “You don’t mind if I dress down a little, do you?”
, wide eyed and lips parted expectantly as Steve murmured husky,  “Tony, that’s the color you blush when I’m all the way inside you and you’re just-- just
“You feel incredible.” Steve praised, murmuring into Tony’s skin and coming back again and again for lipsticked kisses and the scent of light perfume in Tony’s curls. “Tony, you’re perfect, I love you so much, I love you--”
, clutching his baby close and trying to quiet his own panic so Pete wouldn’t pick up on his anxiety and fear. “It’s okay, sweetie.” the Omega murmured, dotting kisses at Pete’s forehead and holding onto the little fingers tight. “It’s okay, we’re going to go home soon.”
“Is this um--” Steve licked his lips to chase the taste of the Omega, still close enough that their mouths touched as he spoke. “Is this alright? I've been dyin' to kiss you all night but I should've asked first--”
The fever was scary enough, but what Tony had thought was simple seasonal congestion from the changing weather was actually a nasty bout with the flu complete with a ragged cough and sore throat, Peter’s tiny body shaking through each hacking gasp and wheezing through each breath.
“I’ll send you all that information.” the old Alpha’s eyes twinkled as he looked the pair over. “Newly bonded, hm? I can always tell. Anytime an Alpha looks half this smitten when his Omega speaks up, it’s a new bond.”
“Oh what the hell.” Tony hadn’t won a single discussion about what or wasn’t necessary this entire trip and he wasn’t going to start now. “Get the fireworks.”
, babydoll. But hey you know, you’re part of this too. That Omega is both our types and you aren’t trying to salvage nothing! You haven’t even stopped staring at him, the least you could do is help me convince him I’m not an asshole.”
“I'm sorry.” Tony blinked dramatically slowly, fluttering those long lashes in a manner meant to be teasing... with no idea just what the play at being coy did to the Alpha's sanity. “Are you threatening me with a comfy evening in, a bunch of food, a couch I get to make my own butt print on and enough wine to risk spilling? Oh no. Oh
“Mr. Carbonell.” The Alpha suddenly couldn’t breathe, his chest tightening and throat closing up as he held out his hand to the most stunning Omega he’d ever seen in his life. “It’s a pleasure to meet you.”
….It was another few minutes before they could peel apart, before the Alpha could bring himself to lift free from the clutch of Tony’s channel and move off to the side so he didn’t squash the Omega flat and the second there was even an inch of space between then, a thready whine broke from Tony’s throat and he tried to cover his face with his hands and hide.
run the return no questions asked, give him cash back, give him another piece, whatever the hell he wants, am I clear?”
If there were a moment before when Tony had considered kissing less intimate than scenting someone in public, all manner of that particular thought
The thought made Tony whine, and the Omega buried his nose into Peter’s hair and breathed in the baby scent to try and calm himself. He was over reacting, Peter just had the flu but
working here, he loved getting to see Tony three times a week and going out for drinks afterwards. With the bump in pay and tips, the Omega had even managed to sock away enough money for a security deposit on a new place and after the holiday rush, he’d have enough to pay a couple months rent ahead of time so he could get the hell away from Barney and into his own place.
“God babe, there’s so much this time.” Tony scooped his fingers through the spend pooling at his navel and chuckled when Steve flushed in embarrassment. “I’m not complaining, I’m just surprised. This is a
“Ohhh you better do what he says, mate.” Natasha’s voice came tinny over the speaker on Bucky’s phone where it sat on the side table. “When Steve starts hurricane cleaning, he’s always half a Swiffer mop away from

“Okay.” Tony pinched the bridge of his nose as he felt an outrageous migraine pending. The audacity of the customers wasn’t anything compared to the audacity of his friend suggesting-- suggesting
The Alpha put his phone down in time to see Peter tearing down the hallway headed for him, bare feet pounding down the hardwood floor, Bug held tight in one hand as the toddler made a beeline for the big bed and threw himself just as high as he could to reach Steve.

“Oh–oh–oh–!” Tony made an awkward sort of noise, both embarrassed and aroused when the plug slid free with a lewd sucking sound, lube and come sluicing down his legs and sliding with a gurgle down the drain. “
“I will.” Tony tucked a handful of crumpled up twenties into Peggy’s purse before he let go of the hug. “I love you, Peggy.”
. It took days to get my mind right again, and I don’t even remember specific moments, just how scary it was to be alone right then. By the time I was coherent, it was too late for the day after pill and now I have Peter and that’s-- that’s just what I get for being slutty, right?”

roly poly puppy, deep golden with huge paws and enormous ears. “Look at him! How can you look at those eyes and tell me you don’t want a dog?”
“Yeah, I’m gonna break his nose for that.” Steve said calmly, blue eyes ringing red for a blink that told the Omega he was dead serious about it. “Bucky’s a good person and a stand up Alpha but he’s got all the tact of a goddamn
The Alpha gave up any pretense of looking for his current target-- the dude was a scumbag today, he’d be a scumbag tomorrow, right?-- and settled into his spot across the street from the diner to watch as Tony and the other Omega Clint went through the rest of their day.

spilling some rather corny Clint-esque humor, and the moment passed as he arranged the napkin on his lap and took a sip of his drink. “You should call me Tony, then.”
“Um.” Tony hesitated only a split second before giving in, melting into the embrace and whimpering softly when the heat pouring off the big Alpha surrounded him and chased away a chill Tony hadn’t realized had taken root deep in his bones. “Oh. This is nice.”
“Well hello there, soldier.” The apartment had been completely transformed from a shabby bachelor pad to a full on

“Oh honey.” the old Alpha rumbled at him gently. “I think what we need is a cup of tea and a good nights sleep and things will look better in the morning, hm?”
Steve had said Tony was a waiter, the Omega had briefly mentioned working at a place close to midtown and Bucky had assumed it was an Applebee’s or something. It probably wasn’t enough of a lie to matter in the grand scheme of things seeing as how Tony wouldn’t be in the market for a sugar daddy if he had money but… but Bucky hadn’t expected
Tony was quiet a minute. “I haven’t thought about school in a long time, Steve. I was barely through sophomore year when I got pregnant and since then I’ve had more important things than a
“I think we’re going to be okay.” he said into the quiet room, and Peter on snuffled tiredly at him. “We might just be okay, Pete.”
“Hysterical, hm?” Steve bumped their noses together. “And here I thought you were gonna tell me it’s delightfully old fashioned.”
“Oh shit, it's nine thirty.” The Alpha caught the time as they eased away from a bruising, biting kiss and swore under his breath. “Sweetheart, you've got to get going, I'm sorry. I lost track of time.”
Bucky thought he was doing the right thing bringing you here but the fact he did it in a way that has you still--”
“I told you to eat, Omega.” The kitchen door swished again as Clint reappeared, and Tony dragged himself out of rapidly spiraling thoughts to try and smile at his friend. “You’re nothing but skin and bones. Here’s your money, put it in your pocket so it doesn’t get lost. The rats around here will snatch it and use it for a nest faster than you can blink.”
Bucky. Dollars for time. No one’s leading anyone on. I can’t imagine people doin’ the sugar thing without ending up caring for each other whether money’s involved or not.”
This was about Pete and their future, not whatever the hell those Alpha-red tinted blue eyes were doing to his heart.

at the Omega’s bonding spot and his chest tightened with longing when Tony instinctively turned his head to bare his throat for more. “Or do you need something to wear for the night?”
“Don't cuss around the baby.” Clint was there in an instant, scooping Peter right up and scowling down at both the Alphas. “Or say tiddies. It’s bad enough Mr. Rogers over there taught him how to say

“Yeah?” Steve rumbled, notching his nose at the soft spot behind Tony’s ear and nipping ticklish at the sensitive lobe. “You still drippin’ with me, or what?”
“Have a nice day!” Peter echoed, the words muffled into Steve’s jacket because the Alpha refused to let him turn and see Howard. “Bye bye!”
Once Peter was back in his crib and sleeping again, Tony turned to face the unexpected Alpha, arms folded and jaw set stubbornly as he stared up into the glacier blue eyes and silently dared Bucky to judge him.
“I wanted to give you this?” the nurse continued softly, holding out a business card and pamphlet. “The people at this place are real nice, they specialize in helping Omegas struggling with addiction or with holding a job down or anything like that. You might give them a call, they could give you a warm place to sleep for a few nights or point you in the right direction for a job.”
“Right.” Steve squeezed at his hand again. “I’m trying to establish like, six and seven month plans and we’re still on date number two. I got it. Can you honestly imagine someone cutting someone else off financially though, when they
The Omega was gorgeous when he flushed pink, his chamomile scent lightening in relief when Steve kissed him quickly. “So. Next week is the fourth of July?”
Then he walked Tony to the door, set the light jacket over Tony's shoulders and then set his own recently returned jacket over Tony's shoulders as well and drew it around the Omega's slim frame. “Keep this.” he said softly. “Stay warm. I'd be all sorts of sad if you got sick and we had to miss out on a date.”
“For as long as you want.” Steve stood to his feet slowly so he wouldn’t startle either the baby or the Omega, pulled Tony’s phone out of his pocket and set it on the side table. “No strings attached, Tony. Don’t even worry about that.”
“Well, on that note.” Steve pulled back so he could count money out underneath the table, then took Tony’s hand again and passed the bills smoothly into the Omega’s palm. “There we go.”

“Hey hey hey.” Bucky stood his ground, putting both hands on Steve’s shoulders and pushing the Alpha back a few steps. “Just stop. Tony’s fine, stop-- stop freaking out. Tony’s fine, Steve.
“Mmm, that is exactly my type.” she decided. “Try not to scare him off though. Last Omega you brought home to play had to be convinced we weren’t going to eat him for dinner afterwards.”
Peggy cried when Tony came back to the apartment building, threw open her door and grabbed the Omega around the neck into a strangling hug and
. The amount of self control the Alpha was showing, the amount of respect he was offering was intoxicating and Tony could have been carried away on it all. “Thank you.”
. “You need the connection with someone and you need the emotional side of things and sure, you’re tired of football groupies and horny military groupies and those weird horny art groupies-- but seriously, bud. Where oh
One last kiss and Tony took himself out the front door, down the steps and to the curb where the car was waiting. The door closed softly behind him and the Omega had to work hard to not feel like it was a
“Uhhh no.” The Omega shook his head, and Steve cursed under his breath about missing it. “No, it’s fine. Having a birthday right around Memorial Day means everyone is always busy anyway and I haven’t celebrated a birthday since my seventeenth--” a whole truth that almost made Tony want to cry. “--so it doesn’t matter. You’re not missing anything and you should absolutely do your family thing instead of being here for my birthday.”
“Stressed is a permanent state of mind for me.” Tony muttered, and the other Omega grunted in agreement. “We’re out of diapers and he walked through another pair of pants. I need to go to the dollar store and see if I can find something for him.”
“Yeah and we've both been here since six am and can’t go home till sometime around seven or eight so
“I had to Google how many forks might be here and then research which forks to use with each course.” Steve confessed next. “I couldn’t pronounce the bottle of wine I ordered so I had to point at it and to be honest, I actually hate wine. I buy my beer at the gas station. I was basically shamed into using the sugar daddy app because my friend thinks I’m desperately lonely and he-- well he’s right. I am
blue, but I tried anyway.” the attempt at being snarky fell flat, but neither Alpha nor Omega cared once Steve’s fingers were tracing the length of Tony’s cock, the slender weight and slight bend and the way it throbbed beneath the heat of his hand. “Je-Jesus, touch me again.”
“Listen, man.” Bucky leaned back against the desk and folded his arms, running his tongue over his fangs as he thought about the most polite way to say this-- “If payin’ some sweet pretty Omega to go out with you to dinner is the best way to keep you from bein’ so desperately fucking lonely all the time, I’ll pay for the first date.”
“It’s half my commission from my last painting.” The Alpha said calmly. “I’d lost my joy for painting before I met you, Tony. You gave that back to me, gave me the inspiration to pick up my brushes again, the motivation to finish my commissions and the energy to take on new projects. That was all because of you. You are my muse and my Omega, so half the money from my paintings is yours.”
to, but I’m not gonna. Tony’s got rules and I need to respect them. This is only the third date and asking him to bend his rules or make exceptions would make me look--”
“That’s exactly what I wanted to hear.” Steve laughed and then kissed him once, twice, a third time because he couldn’t help himself. “I’m going to get you some water, I’ll be right back.”
lie. Tony was a parent and his schedule would never be easier but it didn’t hurt to give the Alpha hope when Steve was being so wonderful.
“Prettier than me.” Clint chuckled when Tony made a disagreeable motion. “But he's already in love with some fancy uptown Alpha so you’ll have to settle for mildly inappropriate phone banter with me. Tough luck.”
was a minimum of a year old. Some of Tony’s clothes were from right after he’d had Peter and before he’d lost what little baby weight he’d managed to put on during the stressful pregnancy, which made those pieces almost three years old and at least two sizes too big.
, nosing through the soft hair at Tony’s ear and shivering a little when Tony automatically squeezed at his leg under the table and then linked their fingers. Omegas needed physical touch just as much as they needed emotional support and stability, and since both Clint and Tony both went days and sometimes weeks without a kind touch from anyone other than family, sneakily stolen time in the few minutes before shift end and the rest of their crappy lives intervened had to suffice.
Tony shut up when Steve stepped into his space rather abruptly and collected him in for a hug. “S-Steve?”
--“I bought you a bonding present, sweetheart.” Steve rasped, at the same time Tony blurted, “I want you so bad I’m practically gagging for your knot.”--
“You let my gal hold your boy?” Bucky’s eyes went very soft, something Tony didn’t quite understand making the Alpha almost melancholy. “Did she cry?”
This time Tony’s smile was a little less begrudging since a good Mr. Rogers Neighborhood reference always made him giggle. “Uh well, yesterday when he kissed me goodnight I’m pretty sure he growled at me which was really fucking hot.”
“Love you too.” the sweet Alpha blew Tony a flurry of kisses as the car pulled away, and Tony leaned his head back on the seat and tried not to cry.
“Oh he’s lovely.” Tony came up at Steve’s side and smiled at the old man. “What a good dog, and such pretty coloring too, wow.”

“I never said silky.” Tony patted his Alpha on the leg and stood up to stretch, winking over his shoulder when Steve automatically groped at his ass. “But I did say lace.”

compromised by the idea of role play. “Alpha, maybe this is a conversation for when we aren’t in public?”
For most of the past year, this time of day had been entirely unproductive for Steve, his mind blank and hands still as he stared at halfway finished projects and couldn’t seem to find the energy or want to pick them up and continue working. Pieces that had taken his breath away at first brushstroke lay in piles abandoned, sketchbooks filled halfway and then never looked at again… it was
“No, I didn’t come back for that.” Tony knotted his fingers in the material of Steve’s shirt and hesitated, hesitated. “Steve, can I-- can I stay? The night, I mean. Can I stay the night here with you.”
“I know what your Dad did.” the Alpha said softer. “I know you had everything and then chose Pete so Howard took everything from you. I can’t imagine what I'm offering is anything close to what you used to have, but I’m offering it to you
“Yeah, that sounds good for me too.” Steve dropped a kiss on Peter’s forehead and held out his hand for Tony. “Lets get home, sweetheart. You and me need to
stern expression. “Do not finish that sentence. It is way more complicated than some midnight sneaky sneaky between Steve and I.”
“Cheese all done!” Peter cried, and Tony looked down at the pot to see the entire bag of cheese melting into the noodles. “Did I do good?”
He popped his fangs in agitation when Steve didn’t listen. “Stevie! The Omega is fine! Just settle a second!”
“I hear that.” Clint high fived him. “Have your Alpha put in a good word for us with some of his fancy friends.”
, he hadn’t expected Tony in a dirty apron trudging out of a disgusting diner, he hadn’t expected the Omega to cringe away from the table of Alphas that called at him when he got back inside and Bucky wasn’t expecting to feel another wave of itchy uncomfortable thinking about that damn kid with Tony’s smile and now Tony apparently working in
But being melancholy wasn't the right mood for tonight, so Tony tried to move past the moment with an only slightly forced amount of cheer, “I guess not. If a mom-recipe can't get the job done, then we're all in trouble, right?”
Tony was stubbornly purposefully silent, a dark part of the Omega enjoying watching Howard squirm, a larger,
“What’s going on?” Clint was off at the same time and the big Omega bumped up behind Tony, peering over his shoulder to try and scope the text. “Why are you tellin’ Steve no?”
“I can handle the table, Clint.” Tony said softly, but gratitude made his voice wobbly, and Clint just snorted,. “Yeah you

It was after their very quiet Fourth of July Celebration that Tony finally felt ready to invite a few people over to meet Peter and celebrate their new relationship.

anyway. It wasn’t easy to work six and seven days a week at a time, but it was certainly easier to pay the rent on the weeks when the diner’s less than dependable staff called out and he could pick up extra shifts. “I shouldn’t need you tomorrow or Monday.”
“Beep beep.” Peter struggled himself up from the floor and headed right for Steve, stuffed animal held out in front of him as he approached the Alpha and then snuggled right into Steve’s side, tucking in close and holding up his toy to share. “Beep beep car?”
“Look, there ain’t an Alpha in the world who would leave you in this sorta situation, except maybe the Alpha that knocked ya up and left ya poor.” Bucky didn’t want to think about just how

Brand name spices and ingredients instead of discount imitations, specific heat products that would make his next round physically and mentally easier… Omega biology had a tendency to shut down during times of high stress, and Tony hadn’t had a proper heat since Peter had been born but he had a feeling that moving in with a virile Alpha and finally being able to relax meant he’d be due for one sooner rather than later and he wanted to be prepared.
“Anything you want, baby.” On anyone else, a smile so big and lovey-dovey would have looked absolutely stupid, but on Steve it only looked heartstoppingly handsome. “I’ll be right back.”
Alpha and Omega were still standing in the foyer holding each other several minutes later, foreheads touching and noses bumping with every breath when Tony hummed softly and asked, “Did I do okay tonight?”
“Peggy!” The Omega cried, scandalized. “I’m not going to ask for more stuff! The allowance I get is more than enough, and it feels weird even taking that money. Steve will
“Remind me before you leave tonight and I’ll order them for you.” Steve shut the door to the bedroom and made his way round the room to turn off most of the lights, leaving only a few on to set the mood. Then he stripped off his belt, tugged his shirt off his shoulders and tossed it away, bent to take his socks off--
“Look at me.” Bucky grabbed Steve again and shook him lightly. “Look at me Stevie. Calm down. Tony is fine, he ain’t hurt and he’s restin’ in one’a the spare bedrooms alright? You hear me?”
“Because you spend the night keeping Pete safe.” Steve was stunned to realize how much it must have torn Tony up to stay with him that first night, how the curfew was set so the Omega could get home to tuck his baby into bed at a dangerous apartment complex. Tony must have struggled through every single date, smiling and declining when Steve asked for
, the gel in his hair loosened from changing and leaving his curls mussed, long legs bare beneath the thigh length hem of one of Steve’s favorite blue shirts and when the Omega folded himself into the corner of the couch and tucked his legs up beneath his body, Steve got a flash of dark red panties at Tony’s hips before the shirt fell to cover it.

“I’ll heat some soup for you.” Peggy held up the bowl she’d brought along. “And tidy up a bit so you don’t have to worry about that. Would you like me to take Peter so you can sleep all night?”
“I’ve got you.” Steve rested his hand hot over the blue garters at Tony’s thigh and spread his fingers steadying at the small of the Omega’s back, helping Tony with every motion. “C’mon baby, come on.”
“Shit shit shit.” Tony dug his fingers into his hair and tugged aggravated at the curls. He’d thought for sure the diaper box would last another couple of days, but Pete’s stomach had been upset all week and upset tummies made for extra diapers and now they were
Steve was up and whistling at seven am the next morning as he scrambled eggs for Peter’s breakfast and set them aside before breaking out biscuits and whisking gravy for Tony and Peggy to eat.
, who was crooning comfort into Tony’s ear but looked almost… sad...at Tony’s clearly panicked answer to whether or not he was open to a family and children.
“What else did you get at the store?” Peggy dug around in her purse for a lipstick with a hint of color to add to Tony’s mouth and then to dab at his cheeks. The Omega had worked a fourteen hour shift to cover for a last minute call out and now was supposed to go out with his Alpha and while Tony was always beautiful, right now he looked pale enough to be half dead and that just wouldn’t do.
“...so it’s a good thing I’ve already got a cleaner scheduled for tomorrow.” Steve finished with a wry smile. “It’s just a party, Buck. I’ll be fine.”
“Shit, I’m sorry.” Steve stopped immediately, removing his hand and pushing his weight up onto his elbows so he wasn’t squashing the Omega, bracing himself ready to pull out completely if Tony was done. “Should I stop?”
“Half a Swiffer mop.” Bucky chuckled at his wife. “That’s a good one, add it to our jar of stupid shit Steve gets mad about.”
Bucky's smile stretched wide and his grip tightened on the binoculars as he watched the Omega snap a towel at Tony’s rear. “So just you and one other waiter today?”
“Don’t say that again?” Tony ran agitated fingers through his hair before backing up another step so he was up against the crib and squarely between Peter and Bucky. “You broke into my apartment! I can say whatever I want!
“It means I want you guys here whether you sleep in my bed every night?” Steve raised his eyebrows meaningfully. “Or whether you never do that again. Don’t think for one second that you staying here has anything to do with our previous
… Steve was still talking with Natasha and Bucky when Tony walked right back through the doors and into the living room.
“Settle settle sweetheart.” Steve felt around for one of the throw blankets and pulled it up over Tony’s legs, smoothing down the rumpled t shirt and using the moment to flatten his palm over Tony’s pounding heart, counting the beats and letting the steady weight and warmth calm the Omega’s breathing. “Settle, baby, I’ve got you. I’ve got you. I’m right here.”
Steve cleared his throat, took a measured breath, then reached across the table to cup Tony’s chin, brushing his thumb only gently along the curve of the Omega’s cheek. “You are
Tony usually just knocked and let himself into the house, but today he rang the doorbell and waited for the noise in the house to subside and for Steve to come and open the door.
in his mind. “Okay, it's actually going to kill me to leave you here on this couch, but I'm going to get up and do the dishes, pack up some left overs for you, and then I'd like to kiss you some more. Is that okay?”
Sure there hadn’t been zip ties and spotlights during their interrogation but Steve had still been pissed about it and Bucky-- well Bucky was a good enough Alpha to know he owed Tony an apology, even
“Whatever you want, Tony.” Steve kissed the palm of Tony’s hand and then the shine of that gorgeous ring. “Anything you want.”
“Is it?” Clint moved on to the next table, taking advantage of the lull in customers to do some much needed cleaning.
“Maybe next time.” He stayed leaning into Tony’s space only the slightest, giving the Omega plenty of room to encourage or reject him. “But could I kiss you this time instead?”
“Pete.” Steve switched the griddle off, glanced at Tony for quick permission, then crouched onto the floor and held out his hand for the toddler. “Hey big guy. Do you want a bed that goes beep beep? We could get you a car bed with wheels and a steering wheel and have races before bed?”
“Yeah.” Tony tilted his head and listened as Peter discovered the windows in the sitting area and chattered excitedly about a bird he saw in the distance. “Yeah, I know.”
“I’ll use the bathroom and be right back.” Tony promised, and ducked out the side door so he didn’t have to use the customer bathroom and risk making eye contact with that
, that’s not what I usually get. Steve gave me the allowance I missed last month plus my usual date amount plus extra for spending the night. He’s sort of over the top generous.”
“Back when we were kids you were sick all the time.” Bucky said bluntly. “You worked so hard to get over all that shit, to get everything you wanted out of life and now that you’ve got all that, you aren’t even using it to your advantage!”
“I would like that.” Tony peeked up from the jacket, dark hair and dark lashes framing the light reflected in his eyes. “And I’ll message back, even if it’s in the morning.”
“We’re going to have another conversation about exactly what kinks are and how comfort is sometimes tossed out the window for the sheer sexiness of a moment.” Tony said dryly, and Steve just huffed, kissed him one more time and rolled off the bed to find a wash cloth. “Hurry back and come cuddle me, okay?”
, but couldn’t seem to make himself care. “And it didn’t do you justice. Mr. Carbonell, you are stunning.”
“Bucky.” Steve hefted the bags of garbage into the dumpster and wiped his hands down his pants. “I’m going to stop you, before I punch you. I know you and Tasha love me, I know you’re looking out for me and worried that I’m gonna make an ass out of myself with Tony but you know what? Even if Tony isn’t as invested as I am, that’s not his fault. It’s an

“It’s good to see you smile.” Clint scooted past with an armful of dishes to dump in the sink. “I think the phrase is ‘you’re smiling so much you look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth’ but I’m pretty sure it wasn’t the Alpha’s
“When Dad told me to get rid of the baby, I chose Peter.” the Omega set his water bottle down and clasped his hands together tight, anxious. “And I had no idea just how hard the world was for single Omega parents. I had no idea. The Sugar app was a last resort, I didn’t know how much longer I’d be able to keep my job with having to take so many days off when Pete got sick over the winter and I needed a back up plan.”
on the inside of the garters, where he’d slicked down his thigh in anticipation of tonight and where he was still hard and waiting despite the Alpha’s speechlessness. “And I ordered two so you could keep one--”
Another kiss at Tony's wrist and then a little further up the inside of his forearm, a nuzzle and lick at the crease of his elbow and the Alpha sighed shakily as he nosed over the short sleeved material of the blouse, inhaled at the dip of Tony's arm pit and nipped a the curve of his collarbone before finally
was a threat. “We all drag Steve out of his loft and onto a pontoon boat for his birthday weekend. You’ll come along for that, right? Weekend away for the lovebirds? That should be just fine.”
Tony actually giggled to himself as the staff brought him a glass of champagne to go along with his lunch and leaned back into the comfortable chair wholly content with his day, perfectly spoiled and feeling as if he could melt right into the cushions and sleep for hours.
settle a little bit now that he knew Tony was at least physically okay. “What’s going on? Tell me quick cos I haven’t seen Tony in a week and a half and this wasn’t really what I was hoping for a reunion. Tell me what’s going on so I can go see him.”
as he hummed the theme song to the after school show and when Steve finally gave up and laughed at him, the Omega jolted up for a long, thrilled kiss.
Most Omegas never wanted to be settled this way in public, but Clint trusted Tony and more than that, life had taught him to take what he could get when it came to
and Tony hadn’t corrected him, gifts in beautiful boxes and kisses that lingered tingling on Steve’s lips long after they’d parted. The Alpha vaguely remembered a
about it, but you’ll have to ‘allowance’ me enough money to make up for any doubles or whatever I give up to be with you. Tony had it worked out where Steve was giving him exactly enough for rent and I’ll need something similar. Like you said, I can’t give a damn about courting when I’m trying to survive day to day so if that’s a deal breaker…”
“I don’t have a--” Steve stopped, sighed when Bucky only looked at him. “Fine. What’s my problem, Buck?”
“We don’t live anywhere near here.” Steve spoke for Tony again, and the Omega leaned into him gratefully. “If we have any desire to contact you, we’ll look you up. Have a nice day, Mr. Stark.”
“Steve?” Tony took a drink of the wine to calm his nerves, and watched the Alpha carefully over the rim of the delicate glass as Steve just kept
“They’re workin’ together.” Natasha made another surprised noise and Bucky nodded grimly, “Yeah I gotta figure a few things out. See you tonight?”
“My love.” Tasha stood smoothly and bared her fangs in a perfectly vicious smile, “If I remember correctly, you were calling
“Doesn’t matter.” Steve wrenched his own shirt off first before reaching for Tony’s, tossing the soft long sleeve over his shoulder and capturing both Tony’s wrists in his big hand, pinning them up above Tony’s head and groaning at the
“Well--” Clint gestured helplessly. “I could’a told you that like a month ago. Why does that make you so sad? Falling in love with a rich Alpha is basically the dream, what’s the matter?”
Three hours of service and nearly an hour of relaxation in the lounge afterwards left the Omega feeling boneless, warm and sleepy and pampered to the point of delirium but then a picture on the service menu caught his eye and after several moments of deliberation, he texted the Alpha.
Peter snuggled right into the pillows, bright eyed and chattering excitedly about whatever he’d dreamed about, waving Bug the Bunny around and kicking his feet in excitement.
“A surprise?” Steve kicked out of his shoes and grabbed at Tony’s hand, kissing his boyfriend’s knuckles as he followed him towards the bedroom. “What do you mean not so loud, I thought you
Clint waited for the rest of the story and finally Tony bared his fangs and snarled, “They tossed a twenty dollar bill on the ground and told me to bend over and pick it up. Promised another twenty if I bent over nice and slow and spent a few minutes pretending the floor was interesting. They basically told me to bend over and
as he hooked a finger in the blue panties where they sat low at Tony’s hips. “Well you could stay in these, right? I’m sure I’ll be able to focus on real things while you’re wearing them.”
. He shook his head as he sent one last text to check in. Steve knew damn well Tony wasn’t the sort to get an expensive gift and then disappear, hell the Omega had been trying to return the last expensive gift and exchange it for something more practical just last week. Tony wasn’t the kind of sugar baby or the kind of Omega to get something sparkly then move on to someone new so Steve pushed that thought away and focused on the other one--
suite was bigger than his birthday night had been but it was frankly stunning, too large by far for just the two of them and then almost unbearingly intimate once the door was closed and it was just Alpha and Omega staring at each other in open anticipation.
“It was terrifying.” Tony confessed in a near inaudible whisper. “Not during heat, it all felt good then. It was like flying. But coming back down was like crash landing and it was
He spread his fingers over the width of Steve’s chest as the Alpha moved in over him to steal a kiss, and Steve whispered, “That’s alright baby, I love your curves, can’t wait to find out how soft you are... everywhere but right here.” he checked with Tony just briefly before closing a lube slicked hand around the Omega’s cock and stroking him from base to tip, the soft curls above Tony’s sac to the already leaking head . “Yeah sweetheart, I love you soft everywhere but right
ever.” Steve shrugged out of his jacket when he caught Tony shivering, and draped it over the Omega’s thin shoulders. “It won’t be enough money to matter to me, and I’d rather know you’re getting places quickly and safely than wonder if you’re catching taxis or rides from friends or god forbid taking the
“Grew up in Brooklyn.” Steve confirmed. “Did a couple years in the Midwest for football, but moved back here after I left the Army. I’m with you, New York is home, Brooklyn is home. Get me riled up enough and I still talk like the kids in the old neighborhood. Hey, how old are you really?”
“C’mon.” Tony blushed beautifully shy as he scooted over to make room for Steve in the big bed. “Am I on the right side or do you usually sleep over here?”
“Oh hell.” Steve swallowed hard, straightening up to his full height when Tony came in close and staring down into the Omega’s honey shaded eyes. “Tony, I would love if you’d help me with a shower.”
“I’m sure you’ll be relieved to know that is exactly the sort of too traditional Alpha stuff that makes super modern Omega’s like me melt right into the floor.”  Tony squeaked just a little bit, more affected by the vulnerability from Steve than he was ready to admit and trying to pass it by with a bit of sass. “Would you like me to wear your tweed blazer, Mr. Rogers? Or perhaps that one sweater that looks like you swiped it from the wardrobe of a Dad on an 80’s family sitcom?”
“Babydoll.” Turning Tony carefully from the wall, Steve nuzzled at the still distended stomach, moaning over the slight swell and humming into the dip at Tony’s navel. “Thank you for this, for all of this.”
“Why would they assume you stole it?” Steve was honestly baffled. “I mean, you had the bag and everything, it's not like you came in, took it off your wrist and handed it over, right?”
for you in this.” Tony replied, but when Steve’s eyes popped open wide in horror at some sort of misunderstanding, the Omega quickly added, “I’m joking. Joking. I’m sorry, it’s been a long time since I’ve been on a date and I’m nervous and uh--”
“Bucky!” Steve’s lip curled, an embarrassed growl rumbling in his chest at having his entire personal
“Pretty Omega.” Sleep rough and raspy, Steve’s voice was hoarse as they kissed, the scruff on his chin chaffing at Tony’s sensitive skin and making the Omega squeal. “Pretty perfect thing, I love waking up to you in my bed.”
“I like your smile too.” Tony hesitated, then nearly whispered, “Can I ask you something before I leave?”
“That you don’t have a valid reason for not goin’ and getting some loving from that Alpha?” Clint suggested. “I’ll keep Pete. I don’t work tomorrow so I’ll even keep him over night. We can watch cartoons on my phone and eat buckets of Mac and Cheese. I’m not exaggerating when I tell you it will be the most fun I’ve had in months. Go see Steve.”
at his chest. “I worked all day, then instead of coming home to see Pete, I went out to the nice part of town and spent the afternoon with Steve. My baby was here crying and sweating through a fever and I was picking out diamonds and flirting over a sandwich. I am a
“It’s my pleasure, Omega.” Steve got to his feet and bent to kiss Tony’s head before going to get another beer from the fridge. “My Omega, my pleasure.”
“I was looking for some piece of shit guy for a bounty.” Bucky couldn’t stop looking at the kitchen with the cracked counter, the floor with visible rot spots, the bathroom door his shoulders wouldn’t even fit through. “I uh-- fuck, Tony. I swear I wasn’t followin’ you, I got intel that my guy hung out at the nasty diner so I pulled up to stake it out and--”
“If you want.” Steve rearranged Peter on his shoulder when the prolonged snuggled started making the baby sleepy. “Or if you don’t, then Peter’s enough for me.”
“Of course.” Peggy settled into the extra chair with Peter on her lap, pulling a peppermint candy from her sweater pocket and popping it into the toddlers mouth. “Did you call that Alpha?”
“Y-yes.” the Omega’s breath caught when feather soft lips touched his pulse, then the tips of dangerous fangs at his bonding spot. “Yes, that’s good.”
“Pete’s just old enough to have a really good time opening presents.” he continued. “And I’ve got a list a page long of everything I want to buy you, so after we settle on a wedding venue or even before we settle on a wedding venue, let’s start talking about Christmas.”
“You’d think your friend would try to keep you getting laid while also helping me.” The Omega pointed out with a small smile, but Steve just shook his head adamantly.
“How are things going with you two? Your date last night must have been good if you’re still this happy.”
“Okay.” Steve relaxed back into his chair and picked up the rest of his burger. “Your turn to ask a question.”
“Omega.” Steve’s voice was deeper when he was drunk, a rumble steady through his words. “Anytime you want, any
… well it was the sweetest, most content moment of Tony’s life and he was happy to fall asleep with a plug in his ass and his hips elevated and his oversized super soldier boyfriend curled into his side.
“What--” Tony frowned. “What does that have to do with anything? Why does that matter? Can we leave please? Peter’s fever is down, we should be able to leave. Where are his discharge papers?”
From there on his knees Steve lavished kisses all over the marks he’d left the night before, clicked his tongue sympathetically at the already darkening bruises and mouthed adoringly at the bite marks Tony had been so enthusiastic about letting him leave.
“Carbonell.” Steve echoed shell shocked. “As in, the Maria Carbonell Foundation for the Arts. The Maria Carbonell Children’s Charity Gala. The Maria Carbonell Organization that fully funded several school districts arts and crafts programs so the kids wouldn’t lose them, including my high school? The grant didn’t come through till my senior year, but that’s-- that’s your Ma?”
Tony puckered his mouth automatically, and Steve leaned way over the eggs and bacon to plant a searing kiss on the Omega’s orange juice sweetened lips. “Thank you, sweetheart.”
“Oh heavens no.” Tony waved at Peter when the toddler held up a rock and shrieked in excitement over the odd shape. “I’ve just been depositing the full amount into her rental account every month so if there’s ever additional cleaning needed or new furniture or when it’s time for someone from the nursing facility to start visiting during the week, the money is there to pay for it.”
“Steve.” Tony choked out a laugh, stomach swooping as he looked over at Peter snoring happily on the bed again. “Alpha, you are talking crazy.”
to Tony! Shouldn’t Clint be all happy his best friends got a rich boyfriend instead of passing on finding out why you call me Bronco?”
The second gift was a watch-- a more Omega appropriate version of the infamous watch from last time around, a butter soft leather band and more toned down face and something Tony could wear every single day or just on special occasions.
“Replaced?” Clint breathed a laugh. “What does that mean, replaced? You planning on tearing my clothes off?”
“So maybe not the giant teddy bear then?” the Alpha asked half guiltily. “Cos now it seems really super dangerous.”
clothes. Tiny t shirts and sort of adorable pants, the smallest little hoodie Bucky had ever seen and a winter coat at least a size bigger than everything else. Piles of bittie socks and feetie jammies, and baby blankets with elephants and space ships and puppies. A sparse and obviously second hand, but still well taken care of assortment of toys all meant to be learning tools and pushed up against the other wall next to all that was a crib.
“Despite the rampant rumours, I’m not half as freaky as people think. Doing it in the back of my favorite car would be incredible.” Tony squeezed at Steve’s fingers again. “Now it’s your turn. What’s your fantasy?”
he’s here scenting terrified!” Steve’s fangs made a reappearance, eyes blazing and a snarl threatening at his throat. “You broke in and then what, kidnapped him to this part of town to embarrass him or-- or to force him to come clean with me or--”
Steve came down from using the restroom and startled in shock over seeing them together, but before he could interrupt or Tony could hurry to his side and explain the inexplicable feeling and the way Peter had gone right to her, Natasha balanced Peter on her hip, pressed his head to her chest and covered his other ear so he wouldn’t listen and announced--
“I didn’t throw a plate!” The petite redhead sniffed, then yelped when first Valkyrie and then Diana smacked her on the butt as they passed, Valkyrie calling--
“Yeah, I thought I would but I just… didn’t care.” he frowned, brows pulling down wrinkled. “I just looked at him, at my
“Call me Steve.” The Alpha blurted, then cleared his throat and tried again. “I’d prefer if you called me Steve. Mr. Rogers seems very formal and also a little uh… after school specialty program? I feel like it sounds weird sometimes.”
The instant attention from the Alpha was nice in a needy, attention and genuine-compliment deprived sort of way Tony hadn’t realized he was feeling lately and he read the message through twice before putting his phone down again.
He blew out a breath, the exhaustion of the day’s shift rapidly catching up. “He put as much into the ‘job’ section of the profile as would fit but I’ve still got questions. I guess now he is a full time artist, so the money from playing ball and the military must be good.”
, a crib pushed against the wall, a myriad of stuffed animals on the floor, a box of diapers and a brush and comb set by a low bench. “Tony?”
“Well, I love you anyway.” Another flurry of kisses over Tony’s forehead, into his hair, and Steve relaxed back into the pillows. “That was really good, sweetheart. Thank you.”
He cleared his throat, drew a slightly genitalia themed design on Steve’s skin with his finger. “...Okay. How about this, what do you think about when you jerk off alone? Or when you watch dirty movies? What gets your motor running or makes you get all wide eyed? Tell me that.”
you want, I just wanna spoil th’hell outta ya, treat you right and listen to you sweet talk me when you get all blushy and gorgeous…”
, you could wear overalls and promise to stay the night and they would be the sexiest fuckin’ thing…”
“So when are you marrying this Alpha anyway?” Clint forced himself to stretch and shake from the daze, changing the subject. “Or you just gonna move in and shack up with him until someone richer comes along?”
“Tash, there ain’t a person alive who looks at you and thinks ‘yeah she seems like an Alpha who definitely
“I told you I ordered extra!” Steve defended, and Tony sighed extra loud, rolled his eyes dramatically, and then tore into the boxed with more excitement that he was willing to admit to.

of them except Bucky and Tasha knew we were an arrangement, which is the only reason you being a little evasive raised any flags. Them thinking you were hiding something when they also thought we were in a full blown real realtionship is completely negated once they realize you were trying to protect Pete.”
“You know.” Tony ran his bare foot up Steve’s still covered thigh, curling his toes purposefully over the hard jut outlined beneath the zipper. “Doggy style? I guess it sounds a little beastly, a little rough. Less like making love and more like
“Okay.” Clint hesitated because Tony was unfortunately right about the statistics for blended families and adoption. “Okay but Steve-- he’s not really a typical Alpha right?”
Bucky finally risked a breath in when the other Alpha’s hands relaxed and let him go. “Yeah, yeah I did.”
“Good?” Steve bit down again, tentatively, testing out the salt of Tony’s skin on his tongue, nosing at the neckline of the slip before tugging it down to lap over a pebbled nipple. “Like this?”
“Nobody was fine in that place.” Bucky tightened his grip on the wheel, fangs grit tight as he tried not to growl again. It wasn’t Tony’s fault he couldn’t afford anything better than that dump and Bucky knew-- he
The Alpha paid for dinner every time, always ordered Tony dessert even if it was to go, there was a couple bottles of the wine they’d had that very first night in the pantry and once a few dates had ended at Steve’s home, Steve picked out a new blankets for Tony to cozy into and after the Omega murmured that he loved them, Steve bundled them right up and sent the package home in the car with Tony and just bought

“Rumour has it.” Bucky chuckled and reached out to put an arm around Tony’s shoulders, pulling the Omega in for a quick hug. “Thanks for taking care of my friend, Tony. Stevie’s about a hundred times happier than I’ve ever seen now that you’re around. Don’t go nowhere, alright? We didn’t make the best first impression, but you’re family now. We’ll look out for you, don’t go nowhere.”
to.” Tony laughed in delight at the thickness of the comforter and the half dozen oversized pillows stacked at the headboard. “If you’re going to buy me a present as my sugar daddy, would you buy me these pillows?”
Tony tipped his head up and purred as Steve’s lips moved to his cheek, to his chin and down the line of his throat, the Alpha groaning sucking a kiss at his pulse as if Steve were

one had been the only feasible way to survive. “I’m able to work because I was willing to let the owner pay me cash under the table so he doesn't have to pay taxes and then I don’t either. Getting a better job, a better apartment or any government help like food stamps would require me to provide my Social Security Number and… and my Social Security Number automatically excludes me from any of those options.”
I’ve got plenty of reasons to not hide away here anymore. I’m pretty sure I’ve been out of the house more since January than I’ve been in two years, but it’s nice. Now my loft feels like a sanctuary again, instead of a prison. Working on a commission is rewarding instead of just checking items off a to do list...”
“Very good, sir.” The Beta waiter didn’t so much as blink over the selections. It was entirely expected for the Alpha of a couple to order red meat and the Omega to be ordered something lean such as chicken, sea food or sometimes simply a
“I know it isn’t.” Steve kissed his forehead. “I’ll check with a few of my contacts and see about some decent waitressing positions for the two of you. How’s Clint going to get from that end of town to somewhere higher end, though?”

talk about Tony like that.” Steve warned, and Tony tucked his head into the Alpha’s chest so he wouldn’t collapse when his knees threatened to give out.

“I don’t--” an echo of giggles in the townhome had Bucky looking up wearily, trying to catch a glimpse of the toddler through exhausted, red rimmed eyes. “God, Tasha. I just don’t know. That Omega is a goddamn superman.”
It was cold enough to see their breath as they parted, and it rose foggy in the air as Tony exhaled, “

into anything, so he didn’t rush into telling anyone what he’d seen outside the Hotel Brooklyn Bridge two days ago. Steve was just barely back from his week with his family, there wasn’t a date scheduled until early next week, and Bucky had a scum bag to track down and collect a bounty on before he could devote his not inconsiderable talents to digging up some dirt on a certain bright eyed Omega. The Alpha simply grit his teeth, tried not to growl when Steve called to check in and mentioned Tony no less than six times, calmly sat on stakeout across the street from a diner his current project was known to frequent and mentally worked through the questions and possible explanations for what he’d seen at the hotel.
“Fuck me.” Tony was just getting off work at five thirty when the text came through and he groaned out loud when he saw it. “I hate having to tell Steve no so often.”
“Oh god…” Tony wriggled helplessly, pleasure already rushing through his veins. “What the hell have I unleashed….?”
“Yes.” he hissed eagerly. “Yes yes yes, Steve please lose a little control with me, just a little bit, I can’t wait to see–SHIT!”
. It didn’t seem right that a single word could make Tony blush, but here he was anyway-- squashed into a sticky booth at a shitty diner with a plate of too salty french fries--
to have to stay for half the night because the doctors weren’t willing to send them home until the fever had broken and Pete’s temperature was under control.
as far as Tony was concerned, and much to Steve’s delight, Tony immediately bared his teeth and snarled over it.
“I promised you something lace.” Tony smiled sheepishly, maybe a little bit shy, closing his knees so he wasn’t quite so exposed as the Alpha stared down at the brilliantly colored garter.
But instead, Tony had ended up with an Alpha who’d lasted all of forty five minutes before admitting he had to Google silverware and that he hated ties and if Tony hadn’t already been halfway to smitten over Steve Roger’s good looks, he
“I…” Clint pursed his lips, trying to find something ridiculous to say so they’d crack and smile or call it all a joke or just quit
“So how much would your life have to slow down before you let an Alpha take the time to be sort of inconveniently chivalrous….” Steve gulped when he turned back around and saw what the Omega was wearing. “

The curve of the Omega's throat was tempting, the beat of his heartbeat at his pulse enough to make Steve's fangs

into his scent as he could manage. “Sweetheart, I want to put diamonds on your finger and silver right there at your throat. If that happens in a courthouse and a hotel room, if it happens in a big church and a weekend away for a honeymoon, if it happens down the street in the park and we get rowdy in the backseat of the limo--”
“Me too.” Tony finally pulled away enough to tighten the towel at his waist. “I’ll go check on Pete and be right back.”

“And I know this is only a second date.” he hurried on when he felt the Omega tense across from him. “But I already know I’d like to see you more if you’re open to it. We can renegotiate the allowance you set in your profile and everything, I’d be more than happy to work it out so I can see you at least once a week.”
about exactly how to do this, how to kiss and touch and convince the Alpha he was experienced and that sex wasn't a big deal but as Steve licked through his mouth and nipped sharp at his tongue, passed those sharp fangs along his bottom lip and tugged longingly, all those worries and stress fell right away.
“Tony?” Steve knocked tentatively on the spare bedroom door, breathing through his mouth so the bitter scent of

“I’m kidding.” Tony chuckled and stood on his toes to kiss Steve one more time. “What’s going on? I thought you were volunteering at the park this morning.”
to go back to college? Then sure.” Steve fished out a few coins from his pocket for Peter to chuck into the fountain. “I don’t know if finishing your degree would change your life at all, if you’d want to pursue a specific job or if it would just check something off that maybe you always felt was unfinished… I don’t know any of that. I’m just saying, if you’d like to go back to school I would not only be open to it, but I’d encourage the hell out of you as well.”
should the Alpha ever decide to turn on what was apparently legendary charm. “I’ve heard a lot about you.”
’ was playing on the radio, and Steve hummed it to himself as he rapped lightly at the bedroom door, already thinking ahead to when he could pull Tony out into the living room and dance for hours to the love song, already thinking ahead to how sweet this night would be, how he would have to do something nice for Tony since Tony had been doing so many nice things for him lately…
“Most Alphas would never adopt a kid that’s not their own.” Tony swallowed hard. “And I know you enjoy having Pete around, I am so damn thankful that you don’t just tolerate him that you actually do adore him but this is
. The manager gasped, the other workers ducked their heads and looked away and even the Alpha security guards cleared their throats and stared down at the floor.
“You taste so good right here.” Steve moaned filthy, licking wet and sloppy at Tony’s rim, plucking at the tight muscle with his lips, his tongue until the tight muscle started to give. “So good baby, I never wanna have anything else on my tongue, wanna still be tasting you tomorrow morning when I drink my coffee.”
The conversation lagged again, but this time the silence between the pair wasn’t awkward. The streetlights were coming on as the sun went down, and though it was still early spring the night wasn’t too cold to be uncomfortable, so when Steve inclined his head hopefully towards the river, Tony nodded and let the Alpha stretch their walk out a little further, strolling arm in arm beneath the warm glow of the streetlights.

“Keep these on.” he managed, fingers spread wide of the flimsy lace where it lay at Tony’s hips, dipping down again and again to nuzzle and lick at Tony’s cock, to leave open mouth kisses over the wet lace and breathe in the scent of floral perfume and musk. “I’m um– I’m gonna be real gentle, real careful with your pretty clothes but keep them on for me, okay?”
Another minute of watching clear camaraderie and maybe even flirting between the two Omegas, and Bucky did what might have been the most impulsive thing he’d done lately and dialed the number for the diner right then and there. The Alpha wasn’t sure if he was hoping Tony would pick up so he could fire off some questions or if he was hoping big and blond picked up so he could—
“Okay.” Tony pursed his lips and pretended to think. “And how am I going to buy new clothes on my half minimum wage salary and tips that go to babysitters and diapers?”
“I’m just fine, Alpha.” Tony stood on his toes to chase the kiss, nuzzling at his Alpha and trilling happily when Steve held him up tight. “Thank you.”

, then done everything she could with her very limited budget to help the young Omega out. Now she watched with a fond smile creasing wrinkles into her kind face as Tony hugged Peter close and the baby babbled mostly nonsense about his day. “This little one keeps me young! I’d just be an old Alpha with nothing to look forward too but bridge club once a week without him. Today we colored pages and played in bubbles. It was absolutely riveting, of course.”
“Here.” The recliner sat up enough to allow Steve to retrieve an envelope from the side table, and he pushed it into Tony’s hands. “This is for you and for Pete. There’s some more paperwork that needs to be signed and we’ll have to visit a brand office for that, but this is the start of it at least.”
“It’s not anything.” Tony tied the new apron almost viciously around his waist, knotting the bow with an irritated jerk. “Just some asshole Alphas who think they can say whatever they want because I’m apparently
“I know you did.” Steve paused at the bottom of the stairs to his front door and blew out a short breath, steeling himself to go in and say goodbye to the Omega when he hadn’t even gotten to kiss him yet and would have to wait another week for a proper date. “And I love you for it, I do. You gonna keep your mate from skewering Tony?”
He swept his shaggy hair back from his ears so they could see the hearing aid. “I can’t imagine you guys want to take on a project Omega so if
“I’m excited to have you home more.” Steve murmured. “You’ve been working five days a week all day and sometimes when my commissions get busy, we hardly see each other at all. I love the time with Pete but I’m real excited to have some time with my

ears. “Yes. I miss Steve. And yes, I want to see him and not even for the money. Don’t get me wrong, I’d appreciate some cash cos being sick really wiped my savings box out but I um-- I--”
“He’s nervous about the sex.” Natasha chimed in, and though Steve turned six shades of rather tomato-y red, he didn’t reply. “I know it’s been a long time Steve, but it’s not like much has changed with sex, or at least not for
--” The Alpha’s brows lowered in confusion, then immediately lifted in scandalized understanding. “You want me to pay for company? An escort?”
“You must be Tony.” the Alpha stated rather than asked. “Steve didn’t say whether or not you were coming, but I know he’ll be real happy to see you. C’mon in.”
- sort of work, but now I know I’d do whatever it takes to take care of Peter. I could never fault anyone for doing whatever it takes to survive, especially when there’s a kiddo involved.”
Tony just kept staring down at the receipt, at the five digit balance in the brand new checking account. “Steve this-- this is fifty
That first night with the ear infections was the worst, with Peter fussing and pulling at his ears, screaming when Tony had to try and use the ear drops and spitting up the baby medicine to help with his fever. Neither parent nor child got much sleep that night and when Tony looked up from the latest round of medicine and saw that it was morning, he put his head down and
he looked. There were still fading fang marks at his throat, his lips were nearly purple from being kissed so much and the scruff from Steve’s chin rasping at his face. His heart was still pounding, his grip shaky at the sink and he could still feel the
“I hear that.” Steve relaxed a little hearing that Tony enjoyed peace and quiet. Some of the profiles he’d read had been requesting concerts and professional sporting events and constant trips around and out of the country for entertainment, so the Omega smiling while talking about spending time in an art studio was
“You barged your way into my life and now are throwing around orders like you have any right just because I’m fucking your friend!” Tony argued right back and Bucky--
“You’re okay?” The Alpha repeated dumbly, shell shocked by everything he’d found, stunned as the pieces started falling into place to form a sad,
?” Tony touched his cheek self consciously, suddenly envisioning all the long hours in the hot diner, the times he’d helped cook over the heavy duty fryer and how his once high maintenance self care routine had dwindled to only scrubbing at his face with a wash cloth before bed. “Do I look
Dinner had been nostalgic, messy burgers at the diner where they’d gone for their second date. Steve had suggested something five star and dress coded, Tony had snarked, “What, so you can panic mid meal and rip your tie off and try to end the date early again?” and while the Omega had laughed himself half to death, Steve had narrowed his eyes and decided on
do. And this is the only wine I know you like so I had to get it. Leave me a list of what else you want and I’ll be sure to have the kitchen stocked for next time around.”
The Alpha reached for Tony’s cock where it lay hard at his stomach, bobbing with each body racking stroke, but the Omega knocked his hand away and did it himself, open mouth panting and swearing under his breath and jerking his cock in time to each snap forward of Steve’s powerful frame. Steve couldn’t decide if he wanted to watch Tony touch himself or if he wanted to be staring at Tony’s face as the Omega’s eyes rolled back and a gorgeous flush washed up his chest and into his neck, highlighting at his cheeks and making the Alpha half feral with the need to bite and
Steve bent to flatten his tongue to the lace, soaking it through with spit as he traced up the curve of Tony’s length to the wet tip. He growled when Tony’s fingers landed in his hair to make him stay, and when Tony gasped over the noise, Steve did it again, buried his nose in the dark hair closest to Tony’s sac and
“Okay.” the Omega said again, slower this time. “Well, based on the way your phone’s blowing up with text messages right now, I’m going to guess that the Alpha is falling just as hard for you and that’s a good thing, right? If his heart’s already involved then maybe everything else will just be...details?”
“Steve.” Tony propped his chin up on one overtly perky pectoral and waggled his eyebrows. “Come on. Don’t get me wrong, you are the actual definition of a service top and I’ve never been
Originally the apartment had been Steve’s escape from the modern world,   outfitted with WWII era furniture and an old style radio, thrift store curtains and outrageously expensive but authentic soaps and toiletries from the 1940’s. For a long time after the ice, the apartment had been something of a sanctuary from all the unknowns of the 21st century and went a long way towards keeping the fresh-from-the-freezer Captain sane.
for his tentative heart when Steve startled and swore getting a glimpse of the dark blue, lace edged panties Tony had worn.
“Oh isn’t that how this arrangement is supposed to work?” Tony ribbed lightly. “You buy me things and I give you sugar?”
“What about here?” Steve circled his hand at Tony’s cock again, grateful to find the Omega still hard and pulling over him slowly, until Tony finally whined into another kiss and thrust up into his grip for
“It’s a big family thing too.” Bucky added, a big hand spread possessively at Nat’s thigh as the couple tried to suss out exactly how Tony felt about Steve. Hiding at the Alpha’s side all night and
Tomorrow he would pay at least his electric bill and maybe his water bill since that was due this week too, then he’d be able to sleep without stressing, which was a miracle all in itself.
“I didn’t know they were going to explode like that.” she said crossly. “You have to try and get a fresh diaper on him if I’m cleaning the bathroom.”
“She is literally terrifying.” Tony chuckled and the Alpha rumbled in teasing agreement. “How is someone so small and so pretty that scary? And how does Bucky handle her?”
And Steve visibly shuddered, whole body racking through a tremble as his eyes snapped closed and his hands tightened into fists, a damp patch spreading on his khakis as his cock
It was one of those meals that could be made en masse and eaten as leftovers for days and Ma Rogers had made it on holidays or special occasions when money was tight and all she had was noodles, a few odds and ends from the market, and a little bit of cooking wine. After Steve had been recruited for football and money was no longer tight, the quality of the ingredients in the spaghetti got better but the amount of love in the dish remained the same. Sarah Rogers had made it for her soon to be mate, she’d taught Steve to make it when he was old enough to date and after
“Tony!” Predictably, adorably, Steve turned fifty shades of embarrassed as hell. “Don’t say things like that!”
the Alpha had intended Omega mate that was sweet and funny and gorgeous enough to stop traffic, the chance to be Dad to a two year old that was easily the most perfect child in the world, the house was full of laughter and the sweet scent of family and honestly, the Alpha was so happy he really might just
the shagging.” Clint tossed the dishes in the sink, hesitated when he heard a plate break, then shrugged and carried on with his day. “I don’t even have a kid, but if I met an Alpha willing to sit and play with my baby, I’d be jumping their bones. Jumping their bones and riding them like a damn pony.”
“I thought you were lyin’ to my best friend.” Bucky argued half heartedly. “I thought you were gonna break my best friends heart so
He shut up again when Steve kissed him square on the mouth, moving to carefully cradle Tony’s face in both hands and dragging the kiss out long, searching, and
Steve swiped dismiss on the notification so he could keep looking at Tony’s picture, memorized the sparkle in the Omega’s gaze and the tempting patch of porcelain skin showing just at the hollow of Tony’s throat where his shirt dipped low.
“That’s it–that’s it– that’s it–!” Steve tossed his head back and shouted in release when he finally broke, when the clutch of Tony’s channel around him was too much to resist and he couldn’t hold himself back any longer. “That’s it baby, take all of me, all of me!”
“Annnnnd this is the proverbial ‘extra shift’ that will one hundred percent pay your bills.” Clint had that distinctive look that usually meant he was about to say something outlandish. “Sugar Seeking Sugar as in
you know to call out of work to take care of him, and if you cannot keep the fever down, bring him back immediately.”
“Curfew at eight or Cinderella turns into a pumpkin?” Steve winked, and Tony laughed so the Alpha wouldn’t know just how stressed out he was about the upcoming hours long bus ride clear back across town. “That’s okay, we’ll get them to go, which one do you want?”
“What?” the Alpha made an attempt to sit up, carefully cradling Peter to his chest as he straightened, one big hand holding the baby’s booty secure and the other gentle at Peter’s head. “No, why would you need to apologize? Or pay? That’s crazy.”
“This is incredible.” Steve repeated, and when Tony beamed up at him, Steve lowered his voice to ask, “So, Archie
.” Steve budged in close for another barely there kiss. “I guarantee all those questions came from a place of half jealousy and half sheer disbelief.”
“I’m glad your home.” Steve lay a very gentle kiss on Tony’s lips as they passed. “You coming down too?”
“You want to give me two hundred dollars?” Clint’s jaw nearly dislocated. “Tony, that’s way too much.”
“Is Peter’s father anywhere in the picture?” he finally said, and watched Tony cringe out of the corner of his eye. “I just want to know if I’m going to have some angry Alpha banging on my door demanding I give back his family.”
“I told you that you guys could stay.” The Alpha flipped the pancakes in quick succession and cracked another few eggs to scramble for Pete. “And I meant it. Stay. No strings attached.”
“Oh good god.” Steve stared at the ruined painting then back at the message, at the painting then back at the message, at the painting-- then pushed it to the side to be fixed later, and picked up his phone again.
“I don’t mind being covered in you.” Tony suggested slyly, and wriggled his hand free so he could dip back into the puddle and bring it to his lips, moaning loudly,
“Steve--” Tony started, but the Alpha shook his head, pulled Tony in until their foreheads were resting together and breathed in the scent of his Omega right here
“Yeah, cos I haven’t heard that before.” The Alpha rolled his eyes. “When’s your birthday? All you said when we met was that you’d be twenty one in May, but May’s almost over so…”
The conversation turned to lighter topics and easier questions, and though Tony had to be carefully misleading when Steve asked where he worked or if he had any hobbies or what he did on the weekends, the Omega was able to sit back and actually enjoy himself as their dinner plates were taken away and the waitress came back with a dessert menu.
“I’d do anything for you.” Tony whispered into another kiss, and then another. “And from now on, feel free to talk absolutely dirty to me all the time. I loved it, and if you keep up with all this aftercare and I’ll be in love with you forever. I promise.”
particular Friday night, Steve was caught up on a training schedule with Natasha and didn’t make it to the apartment till after dinner time, and as he unlocked the door he called– “Sweetheart? I’m so sorry I’m late, did you eat with out me? I don’t want you to be hungry, and frankly, your eating habits are atrocious. Please tell me you ate!”
The toddler blinked at Bucky as if unimpressed, then turned and snuggled his face into Tasha’s chest and clutched a little tighter at her shirt.
biological instincts to reject someone else’s kid. Alpha-Alpha pairs have a hard time even adopting if the child isn’t a brand new newborn baby and blended families almost never work because the new Alpha in the family has a hard time considering the kids theirs. Peter’s almost three. It’s almost unheard of for an Alpha to adopt or accept a kid that age and it’s not like Steve knows about Pete and has had a chance to get used to it. We’ve been doing this almost five months now and he’d be blindsided by it. I’ve been
“What about a sugar baby?” Bucky blurted, and if his mouth wouldn't have been so full he would have full on cackled at the outrageous expression Steve sent him. “Aw c’mon don’t look at me like that. Sugar babies aren’t just for sixty somethin’ people with too much money and not enough personality and a medicine cabinet full of
“Towels?” The Alpha blinked. “I said not practical and something I could spoil you with and your answer is
“No, don’t worry about it.” Steve looked astonished that Tony would even apologize for that sort of thing. “I thought maybe you were older than twenty one and had listed yourself younger.”
“Damn it.” Steve cursed, then cursed again. “Damn it, Tony that’s so sexy but no no no, I need you like this. Gotta do this the right way, gotta get you bred up full so I need you
, and Tony let his appreciation and adoration shine through his smile when he purred, “Thank you, Alpha. This is an amazing birthday gift.”
“I will need a stool to kiss you on your giant forehead.” Tony informed him dryly and the Alpha’s smile turned a hint lecherous-- “Or I could just get down on my knees. I know you like
