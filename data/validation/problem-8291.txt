"Yeah, right. I would rather deal with the compost for the next month than do the night shift. No one comes in at night."
"Hey, don't give me that look. You're the one who offered to work the night shift." Peter says while throwing his hands up in a placating gesture.
Looking around at the bar, Steve had to admit it was a quaint little place. It was small and thankfully not packed, and looked like a place that regular would come into and enjoy themselves for the night.
Tony told himself as he walked into the shop and got ready for his recent shift.
Without thinking about it any further, Tony happily moved one of his pawns also. After his move was set and he was happy with the moves that could come after it, Tony grabbed the note from before and began writing underneath the other's person's message.
All during that time, Tony and the stranger continued to pass notes along to each other. At first, it was just to talk about the game, but then it slowly grew into more.
zoo, we're able to have dinner and a show. So sit back, and enjoy your dinner and your movie." Tony theatrically says before turning the living room lights off and queueing up
Which was how he landed in this particular bar.
"We did good, right? Like he seemed genuinely happy and no longer upset about missing the trip?" Steve asks.
"No, instead I was so bored from being all by myself the entire night that I was pretty sure time froze altogether," Tony says, giving Peter a pointed look.
Steve couldn't be blamed for what he did next; how could he not do what he did when Tony looked like
Tony smiled after reading the note, the idea of playing a game of chess with a complete strange like this intriguing to him.
Steve brought up the idea of camping to Tony and told him about how much he wanted to give Peter the same experience he got as a boy. Of course, Tony was hesitant about it at first, expressing to Steve how much he didn't want to sleep on the ground in a tent, so Steve quickly came to the compromise of finding a campground that had cabins for rent.
That was around the same time that Peter came in to relieve Tony of his shift, so Tony left the coffee shop - with only a small amount of teasing Peter - actually excited for what was to come tomorrow.
could have offered to join me," Tony says, frowning even more when Peter all but scoffed in his face.
"It is very pretty." Steve agrees.
"Sorry, Love, but I think I'm up for the day now," Steve admits, knowing that once he was awake, he was awake, and wouldn't be able to go back to sleep.
"Are you still going to do it today?" Peter excitedly asks, watching as Steve laid a few strips of bacon down on the griddle to cook.
Steve made his way into the bar late one night, all but plopping down onto one of the stools and sighing heavily.
It didn't take too long for Peter to fall asleep, but Tony continued until he couldn't anymore, not wanting to burst the wonderful little bubble they had created.
What he wasn't ready for was for Tony to reach out and grab his hand, a pleading look on his face.
"So that's why you two were acting so squirrelly today. You were conspiring against me." Tony says in faux offense, making Steve fondly roll his eyes.
"You've got a plan?" Steve hopefully asks, seeing the familiar glint in Tony's eyes that told him the scientist was already scheming some stuff up.
"Oh, my word, if you do not stop talking right now you're sleeping on the couch tonight."
Steve just gave him an amused look in return - thankfully - however that still didn’t stop Tony from feeling the need to defend and explain himself.
"You do realize you ask a lot of questions and that you could have the answer to them all if you just wait for a few seconds, right?" Steve teases, smirking as he finally pulled out a lighter and began lighting the candle on the cake.
"No, he won't fuss much, he's with his grandmother," Sarah says so sure that all Tony and Steve could do was shrug it off and begin digging into the wonderful soup in front of them.
next to such an amazing sight.
we could do." Steve says, causing Tony's head to slowly perk up.
It wasn't the greatest, to be honest, and it probably wouldn't fool anyone older than twelve, but all of that didn't even matter. What really mattered was the fact that Peter believed it and that the familiar spark in his eyes had returned.
When the boy had woken up with a stuffed-up nose, sore throat, and a fever that was a little too high to send him to school with, the hopes and dreams of all of those things that the poor kid had gone straight down the drain.
While Peter was distracted with everything outside, Steve snuck back inside to make sure everything for dinner and "the concession stand" was all set up.
"What?" Steve asks in return as if he didn't know what he did wrong.
Not only did Steve think he was attractive, but he wanted to get to know him better! It was something straight out of a movie, Tony was sure.
"Hey, Bear," Steve quietly knocks before walking into the room, "I heard you were up so I brought you up something to eat," Steve says, gently placing the carrying tray onto Peter's lap.
"You ready to head out?" Tony asks, holding his hand out for Steve to take. And even though it's been two years already, Steve's heart fluttered at the sight of his beautiful
"Why are you telling me all of that. It's none of my business what he's doing." Tony says, making sure not to show the relief that he felt when he found out that the stranger - Steve - was only on a trip for work.
"Uhh, well, there probably won't be mermaids at the waterfalls we're going to because it's freshwater. Mermaids have to live in saltwater." Steve says, hoping that Peter was still young enough to not realize him talking straight out of his ass.
Just thinking about talking to Peter about what was going to happen was enough to send a wave of nausea through Steve; even though the toddler knew exactly what was to come. Maybe it was just the concept as a whole. Either way, Steve felt like throwing up he was so anxious.
Well, okay, he didn't actually forget it. He couldn't. He already thought about it for hours on end earlier in the day and was still dwelling on all the information Peter had given him; even going so far as to daydream about scenarios that involved him and Steve. Yes, he already knew he was pathetic, and he apparently didn't care to make it worse with false hope.
"Okay."
"No. Me and Steve are making breakfast." Peter sternly says, stunning Tony into silence. When Tony glanced over to Steve, Steve made sure to shrug, hoping that Tony won't question it too much. If he did, Steve couldn't go over the game plan with Peter, and that could lead to a disaster like having the whole surprise blown.
What he did;t love was the fact that he somehow managed to form a crush on one of his regulars; Steve.
Eventually, though, Tony couldn't list off any more facts that he knew, and Steve couldn't help but break the silence.
"It says... ti-ti...ck...et. It's a ticket."
"Don't say shit like that with your mother sitting right there." Tony reprimands, Steve still looking at him with a bewildered look.
Steve quickly grabbed a few and threw them onto the counter as well before paying for everything.
"Well, we'd better hope so, or else now he'll know we're planning something." Steve light-heartedly points out, making the small boy giggle at the realization. "Now, come on, Bear, let's get dressed and we'll talk about our game plan."
"Oh my gosh, please tell me my wish came true and you actually brought pizza." Tony blurts out as he walks into the kitchen, baby Peter finally content laying in his arms.
"Wow! Look at this, Daddy! Look at all the penguins! Look, Papa!" Peter excitedly shouts, trying to take everything in all at once while also trying to get his fathers to do the exact same.
”We’re just really, really excited to get there; right, Pete?” Steve asks, hoping if he got the boy excited enough he would start rambling and take the focus off of Steve for a while.
Although, right now, Tony wishes it was impossible because he was currently frosting a cake Steve had ordered, having to write the words "Will you go out with me (P.S Happy birthday)" on it.
"Yes! We have a lovely exhibit of penguins and stars back here, but it's going to cost you one whole ticket to get in and see them." Tony says, his heart warming when Peter avidly handed over his pretend ticket; Steve doing the same right after.
But as more time passed, as the game kept going, Tony began to feel more and more pathetic.
“Do you ever think about trying something a bit different while you’re here?” Tony asks one night as he hands Steve his third Sam Adams of the night.
“Let’s go make this the best birthday you’ve ever had.”
"Hey, Pete, what was the other thing you wanted to do on your field trip other than see the penguins?" Tony questions as if he didn't already know the answer to that.
Deciding not to dwell on it any longer, Tony decided to get back to his nightly cleaning ritual in an attempt to forget it all. The stranger would probably be back tomorrow anyway.
Looking across the grass and towards the communal showers, Steve made sure that Tony wasn't coming before opening up the ring box and showing the ring - once again - to Peter.
Getting to know you and Peter, getting to be a high part of both of your lives, it's everything I've always wanted and everything I thought I'd never get to have. There's not another day I want to go by without being able to call you my husband. So will you do me the honors of making me the happiest person alive by marrying me?"
Fortunately, Steve was distracted from the awkward feeling when Peter began coughing and all the attention was promptly put onto him.
Looking the man up and down, Tony noticed that he matched almost every single description the stranger had written in their notes to each other; except he left out the fact that he was smoking hot.
Steve just took it all in stride though, alternating between rubbing Peter's back and helping to wipe his runny nose.
"You have no choice now. You said yes, that means you're stuck with me forever and ever."
Eventually, Peter's hunger outran all of his excitement and Tony was finally able to convince him to come inside so they could eat.
Every time someone would walk into the shop with similar characteristics as what the stranger told him about, Tony would get beyond excited thinking that this was it; that he was about to meet the stranger and they would be able to go on a date and be happy together.
Figuring it had to be Steve coming to pick up his cake, Tony tried to put on a happy face and boxed up the cake before walking out towards the front.
"Yeah," Tony whispers, almost worried that confirming it any louder would cause Peter to snap right awake. "God, what I wouldn't do for a pizza to just appear right now. I'm starving." Tony huffs, rolling around so he was laying on his back instead.
That's why, when a blonde adonis of a man walked into the shop, Tony was so distracted with his own daydreams that he didn't think much about it. He just absentmindedly wrote down the guy's order and took his money.
Thankfully, when Tony got back to the shop later that night for his shift, the evening rush hour was still going on so he was able to keep busy for half of the night.
Steve kept true to his word.
“Hey! What do I call you?” Steve shouts before the bartender got too far.
"Fine. Aww, you poor baby, I feel so bad for you, you had to stay here with an unlimited supply of coffee and didn't actually have to work." Peter says with faux sadness in his voice, causing Tony to outright scowl at him.
If it meant putting a smile on their little boy's face they would do practically anything.
Steve couldn't help but feel lucky that he was allowed to be a part of this wonderful family. Knowing how overprotective Tony is about Peter and who's allowed in and out of his life, Steve was thankful every single day that Tony allowed him to, not only be in Peter's life, but that Tony trusted him enough to help guide the young boy through life.
"Is it really conspiring against you when you get such a beautiful ring out of it?" Steve points out, finally taking the ring out of the box and sliding it on Tony's finger.
Sometimes the stranger would talk about the type of drink he ordered - which was weirdly never coffee despite this being a literal coffee shop - and Tony usually would respond with recommendations for new drinks.
"Hey, I wouldn't be talking Mr. I'm-officially-banned-from-making-anything-other-than-coffe." Steve counters, laughing at the affronted look Tony gave in return as he walked out.
"So so
"Hello, my two favorite people. Are you ready to go see some penguins?" Tony over-animatedly asks, making Peter bounce on his toes.
"Give us candy." Peter cheekily answers, making both men laugh at him.
"Petey, I know you're upset, but you've got to calm down, Bug. You're making yourself feel worse." Tony gently says, his heart breaking right in two when Peter let out a particularly loud wail.
After watching it for a couple of minutes, Steve noticed that sometimes the lines would bounce in a similar pattern, and sometimes they would dip lower down or bounce higher on the canvas. It all seemed random, and Steve was curious as to what the thought process and making process of it was.
After finding a place to park, Tony began helping Peter out of his car seat while Steve went to the trunk and grabbed the cooler with all of their food. While Tony wasn't looking, Steve quickly pulled the ring box out of his pocket and hid it in between a couple of sandwiches.
“The meatball incident last year? The vast amount of arguments over pizza toppings? The food fights? You had a full-blown fight with Sam four days ago because of apple pie.”
“Of course, Sir.”
“Three times,” Tony smirked, answering all their surprised faces before looking at Anna who was on the other side of Scott.
The Avengers pack had just received their debriefing from Agent Coulson and were able to head out on the mission when something caught Steve’s nose. Taking note that the pack was distracted while they packed the SUV ready, the alpha wolf wandered off to follow the smell of the omega’s scent. It led him to the cafeteria, which was pretty much empty except for two employees behind the counter, an agent off to the side and then the omega. He had just finished paying for a beverage and had turned around to leave. Steve stopped at the entrance, just to watch as the male started to walk towards the doors before stopping, having spotted the alpha wolf a few paces in front of him.
“When did you get back? I didn’t hear my phone buzz.” Tony ran a hand through the male’s hair.
Tony's texts are in bold, Steve's texts are in bold italic
“Only if you call me Tony instead of ‘Mr Stark’.”
“Hey Tony, you ready to go? Are you okay?” Bruce asked, walking into the omega’s workshop.
“I’ll try… I don’t want to steal anything.”
“So, then Jack was trying to round them up and they kept chasing him away. They’re very aggressive. I was no help at all, I was too busy laughing so much as these turkeys were clawing and pecking at him.” Tyler was laughing along with the omega. “I eventually got my shit together and we tried again. We thought we got them all. God, we were wrong. My grandparents knew every single one of those god damn birds. They had well over 250! But when they went to check on them, they knew straight away that one, one, was missing. My granddad went crazy angry at us both. We never had to look after the turkeys again, but we were cleaning out horse shit for a year! I stunk so bad no matter how hard I washed, no wonder I couldn’t find a mate.”
“His ear had gotten stuck on the other side of the door, so he couldn’t pull his head back through. Eventually, we went and got help, not after he was laughed at some more and got his picture taken. He was freed with the help of some Vaseline and we didn’t play hide and seek for some time after that.” Pepper finished off.
“Pepper thinks it’s because, like me, your hormones are naturally making you more protective. And I bet it doesn’t help that I was kidnapped. You lost us and you don’t want it to happen again.”
“Of course! What’s wrong?” Tony answered back straight away.
Out of the corner of his eye, Steve saw Clint approaching. He had just gone up to give his and Nat’s mission report from last night. Though Agent Coulson wouldn’t normally take that long, just going over a few details before emailing a more thorough analysis. Focusing back on his friend in front of him, smiling softly as he took in her words about the new advancements in omega protection. Agent Carter was no ordinary agent, she was also Vice-President of SHIELD but she enjoyed going out on the field. Natasha, his beta and third in command, was standing beside him but moved around Steve to get to Clint.
“Of fucking course.” The delta groaned as the quinjet hummed to life. “Fuck you Stark.”
Tony’s eyes flickered up to the security camera as he slid off the bed. This caused the two new shifters to move back, even more, frightened looks spreading across their faces as the female hid behind her brother. Tony slid to the floor, sitting cross-legged. After a few moments of silence, a voice spoke up.
“What was that about?”
Thank you to everyone who has been reading my story. I never believed I would get this many hits, kudos and wonderful feedback over my first fanfic. It really makes me enjoy writing and want to write more.
Thank you to ShaharSpider, QueenE as always, ILoveyou3000x, airelemental101 and SpazkittyX3 for leaving comments and everyone who has left kudos and reads my story. It means a lot to me :)
“You need to bring Strucker here.”
going to have to try to sleep.”
“You look like a turtle.” Tony giggled.
Steve nodded, glaring at Clint who had started to laugh. “Yeah. Let’s go, doll.” Steve led them out of the door.
“Yes.”
Tony nodded as he pulled away from their embrace, wiping his eyes. “Thank you, Tammi.”
“Hey, they know I’m awesome. You’re just in denial because you’re jealous.” Tony placed his soldering iron down and took another sip of his whiskey.
“I missed you guys too.” Tony smiled before letting out a yawn.
“I’m serious Tony. Don’t put yourself down so much, you’re amazing. Alpha’s don’t invite non-pack members into their territory without a meaning.” The female omega shrugged, picking up her glass and bringing it to her lips. “And he let you keep his jumper, which
“I-I was two,” Tony spoke up. “He told me it was my fault. That two-year-old me was responsible for my mum’s death.”
“What?! We have to find him!”
, Steve thought.
Okay, so double update! Yayyyy! I've also managed to give a number for how many chapters this book will have. Though it might end up being slightly less.
“Just when I drink. I have done for years now.” Tony shrugged as he took out his packet of tobacco.
“I have nicknames for everyone. Thor is Sparkles, Bruce is Cinnamon Bun, or Grumpy CB when Hulk. Sam is Tweety-Pie, Bucky is Star
Everyone was so happy and excited for Bucky; the beta had his leg back in his wolf form. This meant he could hunt again, but more efficient with the pack. Tony would have to keep it maintained and upgraded, but for the first official arm, it had done well. Giving back Bucky his little bit of freedom had been worth every piece of stress Tony had ever had on that project and would continue to be worth it just too see everyone so happy for the beta.
“I’ll be right back.” The brunette smiled before going over to a group of people, turning on the omega charm noticing they were shifters before asking if anyone had a cigarette and a lighter. A female alpha stepped forward, letting him take one from the box and use a lighter. “Thank you so much.” He gratefully took one out before taking the lighter too.
Pepper only nodded in response, looking over at Tony who was staring at the table. He didn’t want to talk anymore, and Pepper could sense that. The redhead didn’t push for a conversation, just kept an arm around the male as they ate their ice creams in silence. Tony finished his ice cream, his head resting on the female omega’s shoulder. He was still very nervous about talking to Steve and when the bell on the door dinged, he didn’t dare lookup.
“Yes. So, they need alpha-omegas.”
“I’m fine Bruce. Just nervous.”
“Oh, I also want you to shift.”
The male nodded a little, looking up at Pepper before taking a deep but shaky breath in, holding it for a few seconds before letting it back out again.
“Chilling about in the sun. Clint getting his ass kicked. Winners all around.” Sam grinned, causing the alpha to laugh.
The two wolves left the lab and made their way down to the ground floor using the stairs as Tony claimed the lifts were taking too long and he needed coffee now. The two made their way into the 24-hour cafeteria that Bruce was in not too long ago and beelined to the small queue that had to begin to form. After getting some food and a coffee each, Bruce paying as Tony forgot about his wallet in his room and the omega insisted on paying Bruce back as soon as possible.
The mechanic managed to wiggle away from the blonde and out of the bed. He spotted his clothes and shoes and grabbed them, slipping on his jeans and shoes before looking down at the jumper he was wearing. The scent of the alpha was so strong on it and he just couldn’t take it off, instead, he bunched up his shirt and walked to the door, poking his head out the door and sniffing.
“I’m going to remember that one.” Tony smiled, placing his and Bruce’s drinks on the table before sitting between the two deltas. “We are definitely having a dance later on.”
“Oh please. I smell like oil, sweat and coffee.”
“Okay, Tony, what do you want to watch?” The alpha smiled at the omega who began to think.
He hadn’t seen Rhodey in nearly six years. He had been overseas for a long time and the omega had missed him so much. Rhodey was like an older brother to him. Their packs had been allies before and the two were very close while growing up, but they grew much closer when they both attended MIT together.
The omega hid in the grass, crouching as he silently moved, like he was hunting, keeping an eye on Steve. Tony grinned as the blonde came to a haunt, watching the alpha sniff the air for any sign of him. They were still playing, and omegas could be sneaky when they wanted to, due to being smaller, lighter and more agile naturally. They could be great hunters for smaller and weaker pray, as they lacked the physical strength to take down larger prey in comparison to alphas and betas. Steve crouched down, a rustling sound coming from behind him.
“What are you doing here?” The smaller wolf was close to tears once again, but for a different reason.
“Yeah, I wasn’t so much short, but I didn’t have anything on me, I was practically skin and bones growing up. My folks didn’t have much money and my dad had left his pack to be with my ma. They found a place in Brooklyn and had me. I had my first shift really late, I didn’t shift until I was eight.”
“Tony went home seven hours ago Steve.” Bruce’s eyebrows furrowed.
“I don’t think it’s a good idea… plus I have to get home to my pack.” The scientist sighed, taking off his safety goggles.
“I’m going to work.”
“Possibly. He looks busy though.” Steve noted, looking around the lab at the sprawled-out papers and science equipment that had been left lazily. Normally the place was fairly tidy, but the whole pack knew that when Bruce had a big project on, things got messy. “Maybe we should leave him be.”
“As long as we get samosas.” Tony grinned before passing the menu to Loki.
Tony laughed a little as he left the room, mind temporarily off the fears of having children. He took out his phone so he could order an Uber home, cursing at himself for forgetting his glasses and watch this morning as he was in a rush. The omega made his way out of SHIELD Medical, heading across the carpark and crossing the road. He was away from work, he didn't want to think about anything to do with it at the moment. He went into a small park, just down from HQ, sitting on a bench. The park was quiet, only a man with his dog inside. Most people would be at work or school as it was the middle of the week, and it gave Tony some time to think while he waited for his Uber to take him home. The omega took a deep breath, looking down at the envelope before stuffing it in his pocket. He didn’t want to think about it right now. He would talk about it to Steve later once he was home and after dinner. For now, he had to calm himself down so the alpha wouldn’t suspect a thing. Steve wouldn’t be home right now anyway. He had gone with Sam and Thor to the community centre in Brooklyn. Some talk about shifter and human relations. Tony smiled softly, thinking about his alpha. He loved Steve a lot. The alpha was everything he could ever ask for in a mate. Maybe things would work out just fine for them? But of course, the universe had ways of reminding the omega how cursed he was.
“I’m sorry about my pack being a pain in the butt.” Steve sighed. “I wanted tonight to go well.”
“Yes please!”
“You guys are so mean to me. Why am I even in this pack anymore? All you do is bully me!” Clint whined dramatically.
In most cases, shifters only got wounds from human weapons. It would depend on the case and the health of the shifter. But weapons powerful enough to inflict harm and kill shifters were dangerous in the wrong hands, even though his father was doing it for the good guys, Tony had a suspicion that someone in his pack was double-dealing to get more money.
“This is your only chance at freedom, Tony.”
A mischievous grin spread across Tony’s face. He was literally sobbing a second ago, leaving the scientist confused at the mood change. The omega had gone from trying to fight an alpha, to crying, to wanting to blow stuff up.
Steve stopped, eyeing the small boy curled up on the ground. He couldn’t have been any older than seven or eight. The alpha stepped closer, causing the boy to curl up more.
Tony glared at the alpha. “Or what? Are you gonna hit me? Mistreat me? It wouldn’t be the first time that an alpha has attacked me.” Tony walked towards the bathroom door. “I’m going for a bath.”
“I don’t want things to end between us… But can we just maybe take things a little slower for now? I think meeting the pack, while fun it was and I think they’re great, don’t get me wrong, kind of overwhelmed me and I think I need a little while before going back to meet them again at once.” Tony gave a nervous smile before licking his ice cream that had began to melt and drip down his hand.
“You’re welcome, Steve.” The blonde smiled, happy that JARVIS was calling him Steve now. Master Rogers was way to formal for him.
“Yeah.” Steve nodded, looking away at the village to look at Bucky. “I’ll be fine. You?”
Reasoning: Bucky had to be Steve’s second in command, so that’s why he is his beta. Normally an alpha will choose a beta to be their second in command/second pair of eyes. Bucky was with Steve in their old pack and they made a new one together, remaining the two highest in charge, even though Thor is also an alpha. I was switching between dark grey and black fur for Bucky and finally settled on black in the end.
“The alphas took over our space in the living room, so we’re out here.” The omega he recognised replied. It made sense why he hadn’t come across the omegas before, but Tony was still confused.
“What the fuck do you think you’re doing?”
“Hey.” That was undoubtedly Steve’s voice.
“I’m sorry about before, again. And earlier too actually. I didn’t know you were courting or else I wouldn’t have asked you out.” Tyler gave a nervous smile.
Also, SamBucky and ThorBruce moments because I needed them while there's no SteveTony.
“You and Loki can head back to Widow if it’s all clear upstairs.” Steve turned to Hulk and Thor. “Thor, Hulk, continue the search for Rumlow, he could be anywhere.”
The pack goes on a mission and Tony can't come, so he deals with it in his own way
Bucky Barnes: Beta Wolf
“I’m with Clint on this one.” Sam laughed.
“Steve-o!”
“How come I don’t get that kind of attention?” Clint huffed.
“I’m going to find him. With or without SHIELD’s help.”
“I know. I’m going to bring it up when we go for the scan. Sometimes it does happen, but I just want to check everything is fine.”
“Your parents?”
"Wanda, Pietro, this is Clint and Sam." Tony introduced, pointing to each one. "They're from my pack and are going to take you to the quinjet where you'll be safe."
“Rude, yes, but they would deserve it.”
“You’re forgiven. Besides you were only following orders from your alpha. Now come on, I need to know what mischief you’ve been up to and how we can create some more.”
Tony had managed to help the twins hold their shifted forms, although it took a lot of effort and it hurt him to watch them in pain for their first couple of shifts as their bodies adjusted. But they needed to learn to escape. They were getting out of their prison and the day had finally come.
Clint stepped out from behind the trees and shrubbery, tentatively walking over to the omega, causing Tony to step back.
“It’s so soft.” Tony looked up upon hearing Steve’s chuckle. “What?”
“I have no clue, Pepper. I’ll probably just word vomit and make it up as I go along.” Pepper gave Tony a look. “I have a rough idea, okay? It’s a bit last minute if I’m honest.”
“Yeah, I did, actually. It was just one of those ‘spur of the moment' things and it’s actually helped me a lot. Whenever I need to, I can just look at it and it’ll put my mind at ease.” The bartender explains.
Steve couldn't help but look over his shoulder one more time, smiling at the sight of the sleeping toddler before turning back towards Tony and taking in his sleeping face also.
Both wolves finished up in the lab before going back to Tony’s room. Tony wanted to shower and change before heading out. Contrary to Bruce’s belief, the omega had managed to get some work done and having grease and oil on you before going out was not a great idea. After getting washed and changed into the last outfit he had, he only brought three with him on his travels with his previous pack and he desperately needed more. Stepping back out into the main room, he walked over to his new companion.
“Clint!” Steve growled down the coms. Sam and Clint were supposed to be sneaking in from the roof.
“When did you get this?” Steve asked, putting it on.
“Okay.” Steve hung up before looking at Tony. “Duty calls.”
“I’m not telling you.” The alpha began to walk again, Tony catching up to walk beside him.
“Says the one who is his mate.” The alpha smirked.
The pack turned to face Bruce, who shrunk down with a shrug. “I was just in it for the experiment. Are you guys not curious too?”
“Please don’t be mad at him. He missed you so much, Tony. I’ve never seen him so worried or stressed.”
After going through several wrong doors and walking in on one very interesting scene, he had found a bathroom. Once he was finished up, he went back to the kitchen and poured himself a vodka and coke. Well, that’s what Tony had hoped. The back door was now open, and Tony caught a whiff of an omega walking outside.
“I would say Steve’s going to kick your ass, but he’s going to end up decapitating you.” Tony got up, walking over to the glass without an ounce of fear.
Tony was stunned “R-Rhodey?” The omega slipped off the barstool, tugging at the older alpha’s arm to get him off Tyler and to pull him into an embrace.
“When SHIELD allows us to have one then we will, Buck,” Steve replied as he pushed his shield into the van in front of Tony before climbing in himself, slamming the door shut behind him.
“Why don’t we go out now? I think I’m done for the day and all you’ve done is stare at the walls… No offence.”
“Well, you build stuff, right? You’re a mechanical engineer… I still need a way for it to be administered.” Bruce smiled, standing up “We should get going before Agent Hill gets onto us. Also!” He gestured to the folder on the table. “Your SHIELD Pack. Agent Coulson told me to give it to you as I was on my way up here.”
“And the archer wins again,” Clint said excitedly, tail wagging.
“You are welcome, Sir.” The AI replied.
“I’ll have my usual,” Bruce replied.
“Are you okay? You’re not hurt, are you?” The alpha sounded so worried.
“Yeah.” Tony smiled too, confirming it. “We’re courting.”
Tony threw his hands up in the air in frustration. “Fuck it.” He grabbed the bottle aiming it away from them both so he could open the bottle slowly, so the contents didn’t spill out. “We’re drinking it from the bottle.”
Clint’s raised voice disturbed the sleeping omega, luckily it didn’t seem to wake him, or he was ignoring them. He rolled off the scientist’s chest and curled up, pulling the blanket tighter and over his head.
“I know people attacked my pack.” Peter looked down towards the ground, scuffing his shoe. “I could hear them. I’m not a stupid kid.”
“Around five minutes.” Steve continued to look forward as they walked along a dirt path that went up a slope.
“Around four months now.” She shrugged, biting her lip. “They’ve just been running tests on me. They were waiting for another shifter like me.”
He just had to go off with the two drunk wolves, gushing about their alpha and probably embarrassed himself loads in front of the male that picked them up. Clint and Natasha constantly made comments about him and Steve, teasing them both and making the alpha angry and very uncomfortable. Tony’s embarrassment never subsided upon realising that he stayed at their house, slept in the blonde’s arms and then he got asked to come to dinner upon trying to sneak out. Steve had dropped him off at SHIELD and didn’t say anything about Tony wearing and keeping his jumper if he noticed.
Steve ran to pick up the handgun before going over to Tony, wrapping his arms around the omega.
“Can’t tell you. It’s a secret.” Tony grinned before leaning in close to Steve, whispering the next part. “I have a surprise.”
“Tony.”
"Sleep? What the fuck is sleep?" -Tony Stark
“Just an ethical battle I’m having with myself.” The brunette shrugged before shaking his head. “It’s fine, my own problem. You don’t have to worry about it.”
“Tony?” The omega froze at the voice, he couldn’t believe he was hearing it again, before turning around.
“Well, I will soon. I’m pregnant.” Tony shrugged. "Twins like you guys."
“Very happy to be with my pack.” Steve’s tail also wagged at the omega’s statement. “With my alpha, as their omega.”
“Buck?”
“Of course I’d let you go Tony.” Tony looked up at the alpha, who was now dressed, a frown on his face.
“Fuck, okay, one second.” Steve pecked Tony’s lips once more before pulling away. The omega gave a confused look as the alpha turned around before turning off the hob. “No fires.”
“I can’t yet, Buck. I don’t want to spook him.”
“Snow leopards are rarer than cheetahs.”
"No, they should be able to shift. It's just going to take them longer to do it. I will help them."
The alpha nodded before turning around to beckon someone over.
Okay so here's chapter 12. I don't know when I'll post the nest one because I'm going away on a short trip for a few days. It's a last-minute thing and I don't know if I'll have time to write.
“Steve!” The alpha turned to where he heard Bucky calling from, waving. Steve jogged over. “We think we’ve found someone.”
“Right, I forgot. Clint, no dinner for you.”
Tony was a social smoker. He had been attending his pack’s parties since he was twelve years old, started smoking and drinking at fourteen before moving onto drugs at sixteen. He had started MIT at fifteen, having friends way older than him who partied loads and got him a fake ID to come out with them too. The omega was constantly surrounded by people that were much older than him and weren’t a good influence. If it wasn’t for Rhodey or Pepper taking care of him, the wolf would have been dead years ago from an overdose or alcohol poisoning. He hadn’t done any drugs since in almost ten years, except two years ago when his father died, but had regretted it immediately afterwards and was thankful he never started again.
“Cuddles?”
The three of them laughed as they played once more, this time Sam and Tony chasing Clint. Hulk and Thor ended up coming down to play too while Steve, Loki and Natasha went off to hunt for some food and Bucky watched them from the side-lines. The five of them were soaked by the time Steve and the others returned from their hunt. Sam and Clint shared a look before running off to Bucky, shaking off their wet fur over the beta who didn’t quite escape in time.
Reasoning: I needed another alpha male that could make Steve jealous. While I planned to bring in Dr Strange, later on, I needed one that wasn’t Rhodey to make him jealous. While Steve suppresses his jealously for Tyler at the moment, it won’t always be like that. I also decided for him to be twins with Brooke for more jealousy reasons. His fur is similar to his own hair.
Furrowing his eyebrows, unsure on what the time even was, he read over the card once more before placing it down and looking at his watch he slipped on earlier which read 10:20 am.
Tony followed the delta, standing behind Hulk and Sam. Thor followed behind them, letting out another low roar.
“Where the hell are you? Wait -what? Sleeping omega? Bruce you sly-”
“He made my slice smaller than everyone else’s!”
Also, I love Tammi. She is a sweetie and I need to protect her.
An obvious reason is that STEVE AND TONY FIGHT AND THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BECAUSE THEY ARE HUSBANDS. That movie left me fucking broken. Not as much as Endgame but I think I've only watched Civil War three times fully. Every other time I can only get halfway through before I have to turn it off. It also spilt so much of the fandom. But I love Tony and Bucky, though it did make me hate Steve for a while. EVERYTHING COULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH BETTER. Other than that, there is a very big lack of my favourite Thor, but I'm glad we got Ragnarok. I just really don't like that movie at all so I chose to pretend it never existed. There are only a few good things about CACW. In no particular order:
Tony nodded once more in response, this time understanding more of what Pepper meant. This always helped distract Tony whenever he had a panic attack, Pepper would always go through the alphabet with Tony forwards and backwards until he was calm before the two would just cuddle making idle chatter before Tony would bring up what set him off. Tony was always able to talk about it to Pepper and she was so thankful that he was able to do so and talk about his emotions when needed to like omegas naturally do. Tony only would when around those who made him feel safe. The two of them went through the alphabet both forwards and backwards a few times. Tony’s head was on Pepper’s lap now as his eyes shut and his shakes began to stop.
“Too late.” Tony pressed the button, standing up as Aerosmith’s ‘I Don’t Want to Miss a Thing’ started to play. “Come on Stevie.” The omega held out a hand, Steve taking it nervously as he stood.
“You’re no fun.”
“Tony?!” The omega heard Steve calling from the hallway.
“Plus, it’s going to be hilarious to watch him get all flustered over a lab coat.” Clint had his shit-eating grin on him. He loved to wind up his alpha as much as possible.
Steve walked up to the table between Thor and Loki, placing the pasta dish in the middle of the table before turning to Tony, taking the bread and butter from him and placing them down on the table too. Turning back to face Tony, Steve took his hand before walking them around to their seats, both of them sitting down.
Tony thought, biting his lip as he looked away.
The bartender soon returned with their drinks, Tony taking out his card to pay the bill before looking around the space. Spotting a clear booth around to the other side of the bar, Tony picked up his drinks and walked around to it, glancing back over his shoulder just to check if his friend was following him, which he was. Sliding into the semi-circle booth, the omega made himself comfortable on the cushioned couch.
“Keep searching, look for anything that could give us any clues,” Steve said before slamming the door shut. He sniffed, getting the scent of two beta shifters from the front. He had to keep as calm as possible so he could find Tony.
“Tony left SHIELD earlier and hasn’t come back home.”
“I found a grey hair the other day. They’re making me go grey.”
“So, there I was in this hallway, I ditched the cone and tried to kick it over but ended up stumbling, Rhodey had to catch me or else I would have headbutted the wall. I was probably fighting the cone because I was angry that it wasn’t an effective megaphone. I almost fell up the steps as I reached the dorms, by this time I had stopped singing and was shouting ‘Cheese Balls!’ every three seconds.” Tony had no idea how he was keeping himself together, but Tyler was full-on crying with laughter.
“Throw it. Like you normally do. It’s only around a hundred grams heavier and it should remain balanced and that it comes back, but I want to check. Hence, throw.”
“We didn’t know how old you’d be, so we got a load of candles and shaped them into a T.” Bruce pointed to the cake whilst looking at Tony.
Bruce was taking him to the house after they finished work, which was pretty soon. Tony hadn’t managed to do that much work today, too busy thinking about moving in. He looked down at the sheets of designs for his current project, moving one of his many empty coffee mugs.
“I fucking mean it, Bruce.”
Tony makes some new friends!
“Come on Tony.” Stane took a sip from his glass. “Don’t be selfish. Come back to Stark Industries.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He had never seen an art piece like that before.
The next couple of minutes were spent with Steve getting both him and Peter dressed for the day while also gathering everything they needed to make breakfast. Steve couldn't keep the butterflies out of his stomach as much as he tried to.
"Well, random stranger, consider the game on."
Steve is going to pro-“
Steve only slightly cringed at the sight before reaching over and grabbing a tissue to wipe the rest of Peter's face off with. "I know you do, Baby, but Daddy and I can still take you to the zoo and the planetarium later on when you feel better."
"Well, I guess when you put it that way, I'll have to let it slide and keep you around, huh?" Tony teases, Steve not being able to resist pulling him in for a kiss in response.
In this moment, Tony couldn't have been any more thankful for Steve's artistic skills.
Tony loved having this bakery and all the regulars he got in it.
"Then I'll stay." Steve replies with no hesitation at all.
"Hey, Steve, perfect timing, I just finished the frosting. Just make sure to get it to whoever quick because I didn't have time to freeze it." Tony greets, just wanting this whole exchange to just get over quickly so he could go home and wallow.
"Why do you look like someone replaced the sugar in your coffee for salt?" Peter finally questioned one night before Tony was even able to get his jacket on.
Even if he had to meet with a customer in a completely different city, or if he was at his office for the whole day - which also happened to be half an hour away - Steve came back. And every single night, Tony was there working and waiting, Steve’s beer ready and on hand for when he walked in.
"Well, possibly soon. I mean, we have been practicing so." Steve blurts out nonchalantly, making Tony spit out the bite of his soup that he had just taken.
All three of them began to stand up, watching as Tony held his hand out and admired the glint of the diamonds in the sun.
"Penguins?" Peter practically screeches.
"Hey, Pete, what's this?" Steve asks, pretending to be staring at something lodged under the boy's pillow.
“What do you mean ‘in real life’? Last time I checked, this is very much real life.” Steve chuckles.
"So pretty." Peter eventually whispers, his eyes not leaving the constellations even once.
"Do you want me to start heading out? I can leave and give you two your space." Steve suggests, fully ready to stand up and begin heading out.
Tony just looked down at their sleeping boy, nothing but contentment, happiness, and love spreading all throughout his chest.
But Tony guesses that's what he gets for starting a game with a stranger and only being able to make one move a day.
"Your beef stew?" Tony hopefully asks, moaning out loud when Sarah nodded her head in confirmation.
Peter couldn't hold in his gasp when they got to the back, the small boy completely stunned by what he saw.
It didn’t take long for Steve to connect the pieces and figure out that it wasn’t actually an art piece but it was a heart monitor, and whoever was connected to that heart monitor was flatlining. But, by the time Steve had actually made that connection, Tony was opening one of the side doors to the bar and booking it up the stairs that were behind it.
"Forever and ever and ever!" Peter agrees, making Steve smile and pull Tony into one last kiss.
Once he remembered everything that had happened, Peter sat up to rub his eyes, a pout planted firmly on his face.
was what was going to get Steve's heart started again. Thankfully, Peter just continued on like what he just said was nothing huge and life-changing. "Can I see Daddy's ring again?"
"What the fuck, Steven?" Tony wheezes out once he was able to stop coughing and choking long enough to speak.
"You're a little shit you know that? I'm leaving." Tony announces before shrugging his jacket on.
"I figured you guys would be going through it right now, so I decided to make a surprise visit and help out a bit," Sarah explains as she begins to make herself at home in the kitchen, setting out and warming up some of the food she had brought.
It didn't take long for the EMTs to get the small boy onto a stretcher and to begin hauling him out of the room, but as soon as they did Tony seemed to snap right out of the stunned daze he was in.
"Come on, I'm not stupid. You've stopped complaining about how bored you are at work now, you constantly stare at the chessboard over there, and the same man comes in every single day and has now officially become a regular when he wasn't before to also stare at the chessboard the entire time he's here." Peter explains, which makes sense if you're stuck in the shop all day and have nothing better to do than noticing these things.
Surprisingly, mopping the floor and washing the tables was enough to quell Tony's boredom for the time being and he was no longer focused on counting all the cracks that were there in the brick wall.
"Alright then, Mr. Stink Face, I guess I won't help with breakfast then," Tony says, making sure to give a fake attitude just to hear Peter's giggles in return. "Make sure Steve doesn't burn the cabin down while I'm gone." Tony teases, lessening the blow by planting a kiss on Steve's lips.
"You're silly, Papa." Peter giggles, "I would like soup and popcorn." Peter declares as if those weren't the only two things on the menu.
"I don't know, Bug, why don't you read it and find out." Steve nudges, watching with amusement as Peter began to slowly sound out the word written up at the top.
"So, uh... I was going to do this while we were having our picnic by the water, but seeing you in front of this beautiful sight with Peter, I'm seeing my entire world and I couldn't wait any longer. These past couple of years have been
Steve quickly opened the ring box back up, showing Peter the ring once again. Like always, Peter looked at the ring in awe and ran his finger over the diamonds. Once Peter took his hand away, he opened his mouth to say something, although he never got to say what because the screen door to the cabin was being pulled open.
Steve was having the time of his life, being able to teach Peter all of these new things. He loved watching how excited the little boy got when he took him fishing for the first time - although it didn't end well when Peter realized that they were going to have to eat the fish afterward - and how the boy's eyes lit up with wonder when Steve taught him how to make smores for the first time.
"Uhh, Steve, you do know people usually put the candles on the cake once they get to the party, right?" Tony questions, watching in confusion as the other man began to place the candles all around the frosting words.
"Yeah, yeah I would love that. But let's make things a bit more interesting. The winner gets to pick our first date." Tony says, his heart stuttering when Steve smiled as wide as possible at him.
Steve had instant flashbacks to when he was younger and sick like that, automatically knowing that if they didn’t do something soon, that little boy wasn’t going to make it.
"So you know who he is?" Tony questions, Peter rolling his eyes at the sheer ridiculousness of it all.
"What time is it?" Tony asks, grunting in annoyance when Steve shifted so he could grab his phone and check the time.
"You could at least be a little sympathetic."
"Not pizza, but definitely something else that would raise your spirits," Sarah replies, gently placing a kiss on Tony's forehead as he walked by.
"I know you're having a tough time, and I know you really wanted to go out with all of your classmates to have fun, but I promise, Papa and I will make it up to you. But you have to get better first, okay?" Tony continues, Peter actually managing to calm down and nod his head.
It was a lot. Although, not enough to scare Steve away. In fact, it was the opposite, now Steve was even more curious about Tony's life and wanted to know more. He always found he wanted to know more about the bartender.
"I've got a plan."
"You are, and it's disgusting. But at least you know now and can be prepared for when you meet him."
That led to talking about the stranger's thoughts on the drinks Tony recommended, to them talking about how Tony worked at the coffee shop, but only at night.
"I would like to do it at the waterfalls. Are you sure you're okay with me marrying your Dad? You know I won't ask if you don't want me to." Steve asks, wanting to make sure that Peter was still on board with everything. Nothing would happen if Peter didn't want it to.
”Nope. No one else I would rather be with.” Steve reassures, sending a heart-melting smile Tony’s way.
“Are you usually this plain and boring in real life?” Tony asks, leaning forward on the bar with his elbows.
“Nice to meet you, Steve. I hope to see you around here again sometime.” The bartender says before beginning to walk down towards the other end of the bar.
Out of all the shitty birthdays Tony has had, having to make something for his crush to use to ask someone else out really takes the cake; pun fully intended.
Sarah couldn't help but watch with a fondness as Steve helped Tony get situated so he could begin feeding Peter. She has never felt more proud for the man Steve had become than she did right there at that moment.
"I'm glad. Now, let's finish making breakfast." Steve says, smiling and ruffling Peter's hair before turning back to the griddle.
Tony wrote back, chuckling to himself when he folded up the note and slipped it back underneath the game board.
“Tony.” The other man says before disappearing to help another customer.
“That sounds fine by me.” Steve agrees, holding his arm out for Tony to take; which the baker did very calmly and smoothly not as eagerly as a starving dog being given a bone  thank you very much.
"That just means that you won't get help with Peter or with making baby number two."
?" Peter begins to whine, repeating the same question he's been asking for the past forty minutes.
She loved this little family they had and felt so incredibly lucky that she was able to have all of this; to have two sons and a grandson. She could never bring herself to wish for anything to change.
“Well, then how about this weekend you and I go on a real-life-” Before Steve was even able to finish his sentence, a high pitch ringing noise began to blaring all throughout the bar and the artwork behind Tony was no longer showing bouncing colors, but a straight line of them.
"Petey, the answer is still the same answer I gave you five minutes ago. What’s got you so antsy back there?” Tony questions, getting an exasperated huff out of the toddler. Lord help them when he becomes a teen.
"You got the food, Babe?" Tony calls out, making Steve snap the lid to the cooler shut before practically running over to the two Stark boys.
Except, this time, when Tony got to the coffee table, he noticed the chessboard was all set up for a new game, except for one little pawn that was moved out of position.
Steve didn't even bother breaking the silence until he felt his phone vibrate in his pocket, signaling that their plan was officially in motion.
Tony had honestly forgotten about his and Peter's conversation from the night earlier.
Then, Tony was thankful that Peter had enough stuffed animal penguins to practically fill up an entire zoo so they were able to place all of them up and around the giant fake iceberg to make it resemble somewhat of their habitat.
“So, naturally I start word vomiting about the real reason why I was there and how I had wanted so very badly to ask you out and then he gave me this idea. At first I thought it was a great idea but, well, now we’re here and you’re giving me a look that doesn’t necessarily scream ‘yes’ and I seem to not be able to shut up.” Steve lamely finishes.
"You're thinking too loud. Go back to sleep." Tony mumbles, sleepily batting at Steve's chest, causing Steve to chuckle.
It was rare for either of them to sleep throughout the night without being woken up at least once, but, looking over his shoulder and seeing the little four-year-old still fast asleep, Steve figured that their trip might have had something to do with it.
"Oh, thank god you're here." Steve breathes out once he opened the door, revealing his mother on the other side, arms full of - what he was hoping - was a bunch of food and goodies.
"It's so shiny." Peter marvels, gently running his fingers over all the tiny diamonds around the band.
Tony had just finished the cake and was contemplating smashing it when he heard the bell on the entrance door ring.
"Six o'clock already?" Tony asks as he turns and faces the teen.
“I’ll be with you in a second.” The bartender calls out towards Steve once he saw the man settle into his seat, Steve giving him a small wave in acknowledgment afterward.
“No, this is not real life. This right here is me working. I’m the employee and you’re the customer, it doesn’t count.” Tony explains his weird logic, giving Steve the perfect opportunity that he’s been looking for to ask Tony on a date.
boyfriend.
"What is this?" Peter asks, laying back down and staring at the strip in his hand.
"That's the planet Jupiter," Tony answers, happily snuggling his little boy close.
Steve didn’t know what he was expecting, but it sure as hell wasn’t what he actually saw when they bursted into a bedroom.
Later, when he knows that Tony's son is okay, when they're both not tired and stressed, and when the right moment came back, Steve will get the nerve again to ask Tony out.
"I know it's probably good for him to learn, I just don't like seeing him so disappointed. I wish there was a least
“Yeah.” Tony nodded. “I’m unsure of cheetah shifters, Fire explained that most tend to be solitary. They don’t mate for life, like most feline shifters and they tend to live alone for most of their lives. Though in my pack we have two feline shifters. A lion and a snow leopard.” Tony bit his lip. “I wish she was still here to explain things.”
“Right. Yes. About that.” Tony bit his lip. “I was kind of hoping to go alone.”
“I-I’m sorry Tony. I didn’t-” the archer was cut off, Steve was suddenly there, growling at him.
“If you think slower will help, I am ready to wait as long as it takes for you.” The alpha took the omega’s hand, smiling softly as he entwined their fingers. “I don’t want you to get worked up and panicked about us again, so if we do this more slowly then that’s okay with me.”
The alpha took this chance, probably the only alone time they would get tonight, and kissed Tony and moved his hands to the smaller man’s hips. Tony hummed back in approval, his hands tangling into Steve’s hair as he tugged on the alpha’s bottom lip.
“Don’t antagonise the prisoner too much, Rumlow.” A German accent cut through. “He is very important to us.”
“No! No more embarrassing stories. I have a reputation.”
“Does anyone else know about this?”
“Yeah, I could go for one,” Tony replied, sliding out of the booth, Tyler also nodded and stood up too.
Soon enough, Tony led them over to two omegas, both were very young and looked nervous but seemed to relax when they saw Tony approaching.
“You’re such a sap.”
“Oh.” Tony frowned, biting his lip.
“I hate you all.”
The pack had left to go out on a mission, which was three days ago now, it was going to take just over a week to take down a large gang of shifter packs in Washington State because apparently none of the SHIELD agent shifters over there could handle the job as efficiently. Tony called bullshit, The Director, Nick Fury, would always send The Avengers out on more missions than any other pack, including flying them across the country into other states, even though there were perfectly able agents that could handle the job there. Of course, The Avengers a the best skilled, but sometimes Tony just thought it was ridiculous. That, and he got left behind every time.
“Hey, Tones. You ready to go home?”
I still can't believe how supportive everyone had been for my first ever fan fiction. Thank you, to all of you that have read this story of mine.
“Christ.” Tony took the shield off Steve and threw it across the workshop, far less gracefully than the alpha would. The shield crashed into a few boxes that had a variety of parts in them, the contents spilling out across the floor. “Now squeeze your palm and be prepared for it to come back.”
The alpha wolf stood as if he was challenged by another alpha and at this moment, any shifter would second guess Tony’s omega status as he stared down the alpha, refusing to move and have the alpha try to control him. Bruce had heard the commotion and had hurriedly made his way over to the two, hoping to defuse the situation before it got any worse.
“Well, you might want a bedroom,” Clint smirked, shifting his eyes over to Steve for a second before looking at Tony again. “Steve’s that is.” Steve blushed deeply, he had been caught watching by Clint and was going to wind the alpha up.
“I was worried he wasn’t going to be able to hear me and I would be arguing for no reason.”
“How long have you been here?” Tony asked Fire, turning around to walk back over to her.
- said in lieu of a response.
"It's not like she doesn't know we have sex. How do you think she thinks Peter got here?"
Tony was a bit curious about who was playing with the board considering it hasn't been touched since he's started working here two years ago, but that thought quickly went away the longer he stared at the board. It kind of really bothered him, seeing the game unfinished like it was.
"See, I told you. Sometimes I think he does it on purpose. I can't tell you how many ill-suited times he's wanted to be fed." Tony light-heartedly grumbles as Sarah begrudgingly hands the baby back over.
But, there was no new message written under the previous one that he left. The stranger must have just not shown up at all.
Steve allowed them, choosing instead to head over towards where Tony was standing. Hoping it wasn't too far, Steve wrapped his arms around Tony, thankful when the man took comfort and leaned into Steve's touch rather than push away from it.
The only thing that could break up this moment was hearing Tony's stomach growl almost as loud as the bears outside would.
It was almost a month later and their game was still going on, with Tony only managing to get one check before the stranger was able to move his rook in protection.
The final customer left thirty minutes ago, giving Tony enough time to clean all of the machines and countertops. Now that all of that was done, and there was no one in here, Tony was about to lose his mind. He was half-tempted to start wiping down all of the tables and mop the floor just to have something to do.
While that thought was supposed to be comforting, it really was anything but, and it made Tony feel sick to his stomach more than anything else.
The two superheroes could tell that Peter was excited about it also when he crawled in, but his cold and exhaustion was beginning to catch up with him so he couldn't do much more than give a small smile as he got in it.
The only problem was when he finished washing the last table - a large coffee table that sat in front of a couch they had - his boredom slammed into him once again at full force.
Steve let out a slow breath, trying to stop shaking long enough to get the ring box out of his pocket so he didn't drop and lose the ring.
Although, Steve wasn't quite as worried about Peter self-combusting as he was about himself. He had no idea how he was supposed to get out of the car and actually enjoy the whole scenery around them when all Steve could think about is what was going to be happing afterward.
"Forever and ever and ever."
"What am I going to do with you two?" Tony fondly asks, walking over and planting a kiss on both Steve's and Peter's cheeks.
Of course, though, the day Tony thought that to himself, every single piece on the chessboard was in the exact same position as it was when Tony made his move.
"Well, I hope whoever the lucky person is they say yes." Tony tightly says, giving a short smile. A night in with Rhodey eating and watching absolute trash sounds better and better by the second.
They both made their way into what appeared to be an apartment - which was where Tony probably lived when he wasn’t running the bar - Steve blindly following Tony into one of the bedrooms there.
"I hope he does too," Steve says, pulling the cake and candles towards him.
He wanted to know more about the dark-haired bartender and his thoughts on different artistic pieces. So Steve started coming to the bar every single night after work for the next couple of months.
“You okay?” Bucky asked, walking over to the alpha, head tilting slightly.
“Honey-bear...” Tony’s eyes were watering.
Bruce arrived back at home, hanging up Tony’s lab coat once he walked in. Clint and Natasha had been waiting for their fellow packmate on the stairs and made their way over to him, looking over at it.
“We were just discussing and we were thinking about going out this evening.” Bucky paused. “As a pack in our shifted forms.”
The omega hadn’t had another panic attack since. Yes, he worried on occasion and he thought he was going to wake up one day and Steve would hate him, the pack would turn on him and the friendships he had made with the pack, Bruce, Clint and Natasha especially would all just disappear into nothing. But he would talk to his therapist about these worries and he would fight them head-on. The Avengers Pack wasn’t The Stark Pack. Steve wasn’t Obadiah.
Hi guys! I'm back (sorta?).
Tony hummed as he swung his and Steve’s entwined hands, walking through to the open area once more. Steve grabbed out the blanket from the basket before laying it down in the middle of the grass. The omega smiled up at the blonde as he sat down on it, patting the space beside him for the alpha to sit.
“Wait. What?”
Tony paused the episode of Doctor Who that came to an end, just before the next one would play again. He went to stand but Steve stopped him.
Just like that, Pepper’s phone started beeping, indicating that she had to return to work. She shot Tony an apologetic smile.
The omega shook out his fur and stretched before padding through the woodland, looking all around him. Tony had missed this and didn’t even realise until now. He wasn’t allowed to go out alone growing up, especially in the woods. It made sense, as he was an omega, but it took away his freedom.
“Hi, Um Steve.” Tony was smirking at having been able to tease the alpha so easily, causing a light blush to cover the taller male’s cheeks. “I’m Tony.”
“What was the last club you were at?”
The blonde took another look at Tony as he stopped at a red light, the omega’s big brown eyes staring into the alpha’s own. His jumper was far too big on the omega, giving him sweater paws that made him so adorable it should be illegal.
“Stop hanging out with Clint!” Tony whined, blushing deeply as he got dressed. “It was a joke!”
“It’s okay.” Steve let out a yawn as he turned on the bedside lamp. “What are you doing?”
Steve’s phone had pinged again from inside his locker, indicating another text that could have been from none other than the omega himself. Steve was currently sparring with Thor to get some training in before the next mission they were sent on. He was a tiny bit distracted and was trying to finish as soon as possible so he could text Tony back.
Tony let out another groan as another wave of nausea hit. He had been feeling really bad for nearly three weeks now. It was mainly the feeling of being sick, but he had yet to be it. That along with some headaches, cramps, and even though he was sleeping better, the omega still felt exhausted; much worse than when he was on less sleep.
“Um. We went on an adventure and now we’re lost.” The archer slurred, very drunk.
“Tony’s phone has been activated.” Everyone turned to face Steve who walked inside the quinjet. “Just outside of Charlottesville, Virginia. JARVIS is sending the coordinates.”
“Another move and I will kill him.” Rumlow lifted a gun, pressing it up against the omega’s head “Release Strucker and let us go before SHIELD gets here.”
There was dancing, lots of dancing and laughing. Maybe an argument? No, a fight. Clint and Natasha got into a fight because of Tony… For Tony? He couldn’t remember that much. The brunette rested his head in his hands. He couldn’t help but think what an idiot he must have been last night. Tony bit his lip, he wanted nothing more than to cuddle back into the alpha and sleep the rest of the day away. But the omega knew better than that.
“It worked?” Tony was surprised.
“You okay?” Bucky asked, concerned.
“The forest.”
1) Unrequited love -Steve and Tony are best friends but Steve is in love with Tony -this is gonna be pretty sad (I'm thinking major character death too if I can work myself up to write that) and will be based on Steve's point of view. The chapters will be based on a certain song (also the chapter name -I'm creating a list)
“Aurora’s.”
“I fucking hate stairs.” Tony huffed.
Tony didn’t reply, not knowing how he could anyway. For an omega, he was never good with feelings, other shifters, and emotions. He tended to hide away from them all. He wasn’t good with other’s either, he was always uncomfortable when anyone in the Stark pack, especially children, were upset. As an omega, Tony was supposed to be the one to comfort another pack member, to cheer them up and help them with their problems, but he was never like that. He’d rather be tinkering away in his workshop, his own space that his dad made sure he had, listening to rock music at full blast and hiding from anyone until he wanted social interaction.
