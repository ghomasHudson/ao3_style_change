Indeed, his eyes are still red and swollen. He looks like someone who hasn't slept for several days. His hair is messy, although Steve is no stranger to that.
« I am sorry Tony. I know it must be hard for you but please can you say something? Yell at me, hit me but please- »
"Tony, — says the priest — do you take Steve to be your husband, to live together in marriage? Do you promise to love him, comfort him, honor and keep him at your side for better or worse, for richer or poorer, in sickness and health, and forsaking all others, be faithful only to him, for as long as you both shall live?"
Tony goes to the sofa and picks up Peter who had fallen asleep on it.  He looks at Steve. Message received. Steve knows what he has to do. Nat frowns as she watches the pair leaving.
Steve tries to answer but his mouth is full of water. The cold liquid is stuffing his nose, ripping his lungs apart, numbing his body. He feels so heavy. A billion torturous arms seem to be dragging him to the bottom of the ocean. He is going to die. He doesn’t want to die.
« She mustn’t know how I feel Steve. There’s no future with me and she deserves to have one with someone’s perfect to give her one. Someone who is able to build a family with her. That’s not my case. »
« I huh... I was worried for you Tony. » Steve answers softly. « I don’t know... I feel like it’s been a while now that I have the feeling that something’s wrong and... » He stops three seconds, looking like he is looking for words. « And I was wondering if I could help you. I know it’s not always easy being us and Nat told me you’ve gone through a lot. I really appreciate you Tony and maybe huh... »
And so here he comes, cooking pancakes soon a Tuesday evening. The table is already set. Now he just has to get ready for the party.
« It's okay, don't worry. And then it's the team. - he looks around - It's a bit like a big family reunion. Even Jarvis is on board. »
He feels ridiculous, even childish. Of course, Steve won’t answer, he is not here. However, deep down, Tony really hopes for a sign. His biggest dream right now is to receive a message saying: « I’m heading back home. » He puts his head in his hands, to escape reality. It’s been one month but it feels like an eternity for Tony. Steve’s shape has nearly disappeared from the mattress. His scent is lost in the air. Dust starts dropping off his clothes in the wardrobe. Tony closes his eyes.  Maybe it’s just a dream. Maybe he will wake up in a few seconds, Steve sleeping next to him. The bed is so cold. Every day, Tony wakes up on the wrong side of the bed, as if his subconscious was looking for Steve too. He feels so empty. Maybe he cried so much that all his feelings have been removed from his heart, from his chest. He feels like nothing could make him happy again, as if happiness has even never existed. He feels… a warm hand on his back?
He prefers to keep the « hot body mishap » to himself. He still recovering and he can’t touch him in this state. Steve’s blue eyes suddenly darken. Lights oﬀ, panic attack, cold water, everything gets back to him.
When they enter the room where the party takes place again, hand in hand, Nat elbows Clint a little and nods his head in their direction.
Steve takes a walk across the room. Around the table, Clint, Rhodey, Maria Hill, and Thor are having a really animated conversation.
Like a nightmare, a deep voice comes from nowhere, like a echo, low and unavoidable: « I told you they would die for this ». So slowly, Tony stands up and faces the man who has been in his head for 6 years. Controlling himself, he tries to keep every inch of rage and sorrow inside.
« Steve, what’s happening? We don’t have time, we have plenty of things to do! We still have to find the boss of that drug organization and Jarvis doesn’t seem to have any clue of where he could be. It’ll be hard, really hard. »
Then, he comes out of hiding and walks toward the middle of the street, a hundred meters away from Thanos. Thanos smiles. Steve sees his lips moving. A violet light appears out of nowhere. Everything disappears.
Nothing can be heard in the lab. Silently, Tony reads the paper Jarvis just gave him. As he goes on reading, Tony’s face slowly changes. Rage, pain, deep sorrow. With an abrupt gesture, he throws the paper away and runs to the window. He needs air. It is like a hundred people are suddenly surrounding him, oppressing him.
"thanks it was starting to get really stuffy in that thing." I say, walking back into the main room.
"uh- wow. I thought it would be an actual threat, not just a random mythical creature, but okay." I say, placing my shield back on my back. The times I've been called in by SHIELD so far have been to storm enemy facilities, rescuing hostages, once it was even to talk down a suicide bomber, so this is way out of my field of expertise. "what are we meant to do with it?" I ask, just as Hawkeye pulls up. it seems he as been briefed, as he didn't seem surprised by the unicorn.
"They finished early, and Nat told me Cap's uniform needs fixing." He tells me, noticeably sitting up straighter.
"no Peg, I'm real. turns out I didn't die in the crash - the serum kept me in stasis." I explain, taking a seat next to her and holding her hand. her mouth falls open as she looks down at our hands, a strand of her wiry grey hair falling into her face. "I'm sorry I'm late."
"No. like I said, He wouldn't want me to discuss his personal life with you." I say, noticing that Tony had slipped off. "excuse me." I head towards his lab, entering my access code before slipping through the door. I quickly find Tony leaning over his work surface where a 3D hologram of my suit is, a bottle of rum in hand.
"you couldn't have told me that Steve was here?" I ask after he has given me Cap's gear, laying my head on the table.
"maybe he's just not a very interesting guy?" I offer, still refusing to believe that Clint is Hawkeye. I mean, come on.
"no he can he was just following up on a joke I keep making about him being a virgin." she fake whispers to him, winking at me.
"I would, but I don't think I have temperament to deal with half the people that you have to deal with." I laugh, wrapping my arms around him naturally.
"I guess that makes sense, I did never see the two of you in a room together. but seriously, you had a whole operation going on." he laughs, leaning back. "you were both living here for a while, for gods sake." We both fall silent after that, and I look up to catch him staring directly at me. He smiles, waving me towards him. I join him on his bed, sitting cross legged opposite him.
"so I heard." he mutters, shutting his eye again. "me too, by the way, kinda. I wasn't expecting him to like me in that way, we're just friends, but it seems like there might be something there."
I just sit there quietly, really unsure of what to do. I was not expecting to see Tony tonight, I just assumed he would be ignoring me.
"Stopstopstop Tony" I say, gently taking the bottle from his hand and steadying him with a hand on his lower back. "just stop."
"okay, well from my side, we were so close the first couple of weeks that we knew each other, but then you came to stay here with me and you always seemed so secretive and panicked, and well, I thought that it was me, or maybe Cap was something more, which is none of my business, but I could see you weren't happy, so I stopped the jokes and the teasing, thinking maybe you wanted more of a chilled friendship type thing. But I'm not great at holding myself back, so maybe I did start to drift. I'm really sorry about that." He explains, his eyes glued to my bed.
we end up making an evening of it, and ordering some food. Nat and I stopped drinking early on, but Tony kept going throughout the night, until Natasha and I literally have to carry him to my car.
"come on, lets go play a game of something in my room so we don't disturb the rest of the building." He laughs, grabbing my hand and leading me to a room much like mine, with just 1 single bed in it.
"yo dude where are you? I haven't seen you in like 2 weeks." Clint says as soon as I answer the phone, catching my breath.
"Its just settling. means its either going to settle and be stable, or- well we'll cross that bridge if we come to it." he mutters, me catching on easily. the building is shifting, it could collapse on us.
« I don’t know... This is... unreal. Before you, everything I thought was going great in my life was destroyed at one point or another. I am just telling myself that this situation won’t be an exception. I mean, look at us. Captain América and Iron Man huh? What if I am not the one you need, the one Peter needs? I am unstable. I am the one who destroyed the Avengers remember? Ultron? Me. Civil War? Me. I fought you Steve! I hurt you and yet you forgave me. What if I hurt you again? What if Peter is hurt because of me? What if I am a bad example for him? What if-»
Steve looked at his phone and sighed. So that’s why Nat had been accepting all those missions. Why didn’t she come to him? He could have helped, he could- He picked up his phone again and answered Tony.
« Speaking of Jarvis, have you seen Tony? He was supposed to improve some of our gadgets, but I haven't heard from him. »
Tony buries his face in the sheets and grasps the blanket. In this position, the muscles of his back are clearly showing. Steve freezes, hypnotized by how good Tony looks, as though a Greek statue had come to life. He shakes his head to focus on the moment again. Slowly, he slips his hand under Tony and starts to masturbate him. It’s meant to be. Whatever happens now, they both want to face it together. Together, always. Tony would like this to last forever. No missions, no Avengers, just him and Steve, loving each other for the rest of their lives. Steve intensifies his moves, making them faster. Tony, well determined to not let his husband unsatisfied, turns around and in perfect synchronization with his lover, stimulates him as well. Trying to stay focused again, Steve closes his eyes and catches Tony’s lips with his. He tries to put all his feeling in this kiss, conveying his passion, fears, and promises to the man he loves.
Tony whispers alone as he sits on the fountain’s edge. He has been walking for two hours now and yet, he doesn’t feel any better. It’s even getting worse. He tries his best to breathe as deep as he can but his shaking hands and legs betray him. Gosh, not again, please. It’s been a month since Steve left for a mission and one month since his attacks started again. He knows that when he married Steve, he accepted his life as well. He tries to deal with it, to control it, going outside for a walk like he is doing right now. The sun shines brightly, no clouds can be spotted in the sky, a soft wind skims his skin. It should be a great day, peaceful, but he can’t help it. His work can only distract him for a few hours but anytime he comes back home, he is gripped by the deafening silence of the room. He knows it, he knows he needs Steve to be okay, to feel okay. Steve is home and without him, Tony has the feeling that a part of his soul has been taken away from him. He is not complete this way. A hole rips his chest apart just by thinking about it.
Steve sighs. He had never thought that the situation would evolve this way. When he ran away, it’s not because he didn’t want to respond but because he was really confused about his own feelings. He had only loved Peggy before, and he didn’t expect to fall in love with a man, especially Tony. He had to take time to sort out his feelings before coming back. But since then, Tony has been avoiding him and he hasn’t found a single time to talk to him alone. He blames himself for waiting so long. He should have fixed the situation earlier. Maybe he would be the one making Tony laugh tonight. Steve watches the stranger. The way he looks at Tony makes Steve want to crush his face. The man suddenly takes Tony’s hand. Worth of all, Tony doesn’t push him away. Steve feels his whole body stretching. He tightens the edge of the table so tightly that the joints of his hands are white. He focuses on their conversation again.
Wasted. Everything is wasted. At this precise point of the story he knows. Tony knows that everything is lost. He is just standing here on a roof, looking at the deviated city in front of him. Somewhere over-there, so many dead bodies, too many for him.
Tony frowns. « There’s nothing to answer Steve. I understood. You don’t love me I get it. No need to run away once more. »
Tears fall down again on Nat’s cheeks. Steve takes her in his arms. She’s always been here for him. All he wants is to make her happy as she did for him. She deserves it. More than anyone. Nat doesn’t say anything, sobbing in his shoulder. A little voice comes out of nowhere.
Peter gives his hand to his other dad and starts making his way outside. When they arrive in the garden, everyone turns back to look at them. Nat, Clint, Vision, Wanda… They are all here, smiling at the cute family image.
As tony suits up, Jarvis doesn’t say a word. But he’s been here long enough to say that it is not ok. Tony’s face right now, that face, Jarvis has never seen it before. Because deep down he knows. Jarvis knows that all what Tony does, the armors, the jokes, is to hide the sadness which has been hunting him for so many years.
Steve sighs. « Tony, I’m your husband, remember? You need to tell me everything, even if you think it’s nothing. For the better and the worst, I promised to love you. »
« BADAHBOOO! » screamed Peter suddenly, throwing the little toy away. He stayed still three seconds, looking distant. Then he run toward Steve.
How could he refuse? Steve’s voice is full of sadness and despair. Once again, Tony thinks that something must have happened. Steve is usually so strong, and never complains. Of course, Tony encourages him to tell him everything because he shouldn’t have to carry the weight of the world on his shoulder. At least, not alone. On the other hand, he is aware that lately, they barely had time to look after each other. He misses the old times, where they didn’t have to save the world every day. Tony takes oﬀ his clothes, just keeping his underwear and slips gently under the covers. Steve turns over and wraps his arms around Tony’s torso, burying his face in Tony’s chest. He wraps his left arm around Steve’s chest and he brings his free hand to his lover’s cheek. He wraps his legs around his husband’s waist, to make sure he feels warm and protected. He holds him tightly. He wants to feel him in every way possible. Judging by his slow and regular breathing, Steve has fallen asleep. Tony buries his face in Steve’s hair. « I’m always going to protect you I swear,» he whispers to him lovingly. He closes his eyes and it barely takes him three seconds to fall asleep too. When he opens them again, the sun has disappeared to make room for the moon. It must be three or four in the morning. Even though he hasn’t slept like this in a while, Tony still feels tired. He takes Steve’s temperature. It seems to be normal again. With his fingertips, he draws Steve’s facial features. Suddenly, he freezes. Steve is moving and Tony is way too aware of his hot body moving against him. His breath quickens. He tries to pull himself out but Steve holds him back. Tony hates himself. How can he be thinking about this in such a situation? Steve’s sick, and it’s the worse time to think about- Steve opens his eyes. For a few seconds, he looks completely lost, wondering how he managed to get to bed. Then he notices Tony’s presence and stops breathing.
"oh yeah. good luck finding some for the next while." Tony says, causing the blush that I've been holding back for a while now to make its way out.
"oh Cap, talking about Tony, I have a friend that I want to set up with him, and I wanted your opinion." Natasha tells me, scrolling through her phone.
"oh hi Nat, just wanted to let you guys know that I've sorted out your uniforms, so come down whenever so that I can make sure everything is as it should be." Tony says.
"okay well you can call me whenever, here is my number, I'm here if you ever need a friend." she tells me, handing me a slip of paper before pulling me into a hug. Pepper and I have become friends quite quickly, me asking her for advice after I had talked to Tony.
"Clint I'd like you to try it with a full balaclava on, and also I need to have a chat with your parents if you think that old people call eachother
"I don't know. Cap and I don't really talk about that sort of thing." I respond after a moment, sitting down on the sofa next to him. "why does Iron man like Cap like that?"
"see you in an hour." I say, grabbing my bag and jumping back out of the window. I don't go all the way back to my apartment, I just pull off my hood and pull on a jacket and find a public bathroom to change in, before heading into a bar for half an hour. I walk back into the tower 50 minutes after I left, quickly making my way into Tony's lab.
"you're an idiot. gimme that, It'd be better for you to have something a little better than a thin piece of fabric before you two next get together." Nat laughs, grabbing my hat. "I'll make sure to tell him to give it to Steve." she tells me with a wink, before walking downstairs.
"Your door was literally unlocked. I opened your door and just walked in. you're a mess, Rogers." She teases, only looking up from her phone to give me a side eye.
For once, Steve is really grateful for his training. He rushes up the stairs, hoping he can get there in time. When he arrives, Tony and the man just got out of the elevator. Steve’s heart skips another beat. That’s what he was afraid of. He watches them as they stand before a door. Tony’s room. Tony unlocks the door.
Avengers tower, 6 pm. The only sound that can be heard is a butter crackling in a frying pan. A yummy smell of sugar spreads slowly in the room. Alone in a comfy jogging and a white shirt, Steve is cooking pancakes for dinner. For the first time in 6 months, all Avengers would finally reunite for something else than a mission. When Tony sent the invitation, he told them to be here at 8, so it gives him two hours to be ready. Long enough. He flips a pancake, whistling and smiling. He is happy about this little party. He only has to finish this and then he’ll go take his shower. Nat said she would pick up Peter at school so everything is fine. Tony should be here in any minute anyway. Steve looks down at the ring he is wearing. Everything has gone so fast and crazy since they married two years ago.  Tony insisted heavily that he comes and lives with him in the tower. In fact, he literally took all his stuff from his old apartment and brought it here without asking him. He remembers how confused he was when he found the flat completely empty. Well, nearly empty, as the only thing that remained was a business card on the floor, with the tower drawn on it. However, he surprised himself seeing how well he adapted to the situation and to his new life. Living with Tony is everything but a burden. Thrilling, lovely, wonderful hell yeah! But definitely not a weight. They even managed to adopt a child. The first time they met Peter, they absolutely loved him. Despite his young age, Peter is very mature and already shows some interest in science which makes Tony especially happy. This morning, Peter couldn’t stay still, way too much excited by the upcoming party.
It made Tony laugh. « Yeah kiddo! -He puts his hand on Peter’s head- Everyone everyone will be here. »
Tony makes a step back, in shock. It’s the first time he hears Steve screaming. He looks at the man. « You better go heal your nose. I’ll call you later. »
It seems like a year has passed before he opens his eyes again and air finally enters his lungs again. He couldn’t remember how but Tony managed to move him. They were still on the sofa, but now they’re facing each other and Tony is straddling him. They are both holding each other, Steve’s face buried in Tony’s neck while Tony strokes his hair. His body is still shaking. His fingers are white from gripping Tony’s shirt. He managed to tear holes in it. It is completely destroyed.
"Steeveeee?" A voice asks as the door opens, causing me to leap at the intruder, Natasha quickly ending up pinned on her front on the floor, her arm twisted behind her back.
has had sex??" Tony adds, making everyone dramatically gasp down the coms system. I just sigh, rolling my eyes again.
"my fucking god is Cap lucky he's ill." Tony says, falling into the chair next to mine. I instantly get hit with the smell of alcohol clinging to him, making me scrunch my face up slightly. "they have the whole lot here tonight, this is the first time i've managed to sit down."
"Yes? who is this?" He asks over the phone, not seeming too worried about the fact that someone else is using Tony's phone.
"come on, lets go." he whispers, grabbing my hand as we run into Tony's lab, turning on the one way glass and watching as Nat enters the kitchen. she walks over to the coffee maker, a frown appearing on her face as she searches for the coffee. she turns around, spying our empty mugs in the sink before turning to face the glass.
"yeah sure, I just get into some more normal clothes. come on in." I say, stepping out of the doorframe and heading towards my room, hearing him softly close the door behind him.
"Meet me at your place. I wasn't joking about wanting to introduce you to Tony." She says, her eyes alight.
"okay just- yeah you're just going to have to pull-" Iron Man tells me while wincing, both of us trying to get the damaged plates off of his suit. Turns out the unicorn ripped through part of the disassembly mechanisms in his suit, meaning we're having to try and pull already dented scraps of metal off the suit, when there's a bunch of things working to stop this from happening.
"thats what- what I was trying to say earlier, you know, death truths and what not." He continues, his voice strained.
"not what I meant." he replies as he quickly flips over to straddle my hips, our bodies pressed together. "I meant," his fingers work their  way under my shirt, exploring my chest. "why did you stop?" He smashes his lips against mine with similar urgency to that in the lift, my fingers automatically falling to his hips, holding him in place as he presses harder into the kiss.
"okay yeah I deserve that. come on, lets move further up." I tell him, pulling him with me as I head towards the most stable looking part of the room, before sliding down to sit on the floor.
"yeah thats probably it. its just weird, I'm not exactly your biggest fan, yet i'm being so open." he says, smiling.
"how do you even know what time I'm meant to be getting here?" I ask, standing to stretch out my body, before running my hand through my hair in an attempt to flatten it.
"I'm glad that you don't want to hide your feelings" I say after a moment, smiling down at the table. "but how about we don't label this, and just go with it?" I offer up, looking up at him.
"I had this - disease - that means alcohol doesn't- get absorbed into my bloodstream very much at all. I only get a little drunk, and not for very long." I sigh, holding up the bottle to show him before chugging it, his hand coming up in protest.
"what's going on?" I ask as I get there, Natasha, Bruce and Iron Man seeming to just be standing around.
"Oh he can't make it, Cap the second." he tells me, his suit whirring as he turns his head. We're all trying to keep our identities secret, apart from Banner, who wouldn't exactly be able to wear a mask if it kept getting ripped to shreds, Nat, who is the one that knows who we all are for security reasons, and Tony Stark, who is someone who isn't working for SHIELD. Iron Man doesn't work here either as Tony built his suit, but I guess he wanted to keep who he is secret.
"aha!" I say, grinning while holding up the panel with the dent in it. I get back to work, helping him remove the rest of him armour, leaving him in just his flight suit and his helmet.
"I don't know why you don't just tell him who you are." She says, standing up. "I mean yeah it'd be awkward but.." she says, trailing off and shrugging.
"and you think that I do?" He responds, looking up at me. "you wanna come anyway?" he asks after a moment. "I mean like if you're not too busy..."
"hey, Steve?" Tony asks a minute later, turning to face me. "you wanna stay another week?" a grin working its way onto his face. I just laugh, my fingers brushing over his cheek as I lean in to give him a soft kiss.
"I know I- that was mean of me. Tony I wasn't good enough for you last time, how can I think I will be this time?" I say, picking up my hood. "I really do care about you, Tony, but I can't do this to myself."
"because- well because he's Tony." I say, running a hand through my hair. "so why are you here?" I ask, turning to face her.
"Really? Tony Stark is bad with emotions?" I laugh, making him chuckle. "I mean yeah I'm still pissed about that, it really hurt bad Tony, but you're not a bad person. I guess we just weren't meant to go that far."
"oh I'm being an idiot? go and crawl back to the all american boy toy you're snuggling up with, and leave us be." He spits, pulling the girl into the elevator, pushing her against the wall before kissing her hard, the doors sliding closed behind them. Its a few minutes before I can move, but when I do, I run back to my room, pulling on my Captain America suit.
"wow yeah I can see how that'd kill the mood." he laughs. "how about we go to the bedroom? promise theres a 89% chance you will not see someones head getting bitten off in there."
"Just visiting Cap. as much as he'll tell you he doesn't need help, the guy can't shower himself with a hurt arm in a bandage, so I am the lucky fellow to get the job. We're probably going to head back to Brooklyn later cause I have no clothes with me." I improvise, earning myself an amused eye roll from Natasha. "what are you doing here? I thought you were meant to be in meetings all day."
"you know I'm not susceptible to that stuff. also we didn't do anything." I say after a solid minute of giving her the death stare.
"wait Steve you told Iron Man who you are?" Bruce adds from his lab. he's trying to figure out where they're all coming from back at the safety of the lab. I'm guessing SHIELD didn't want to let the hulk loose on their shiny building.
"well only because you asked so nicely." I say with a grin, pulling him in for a side hug before I can think about it. oh well. We were quite hands on friends, wow that sounded weird, I just mean that we were usually touching if we were near each other. Now theres an odd tenseness to stuff, maybe its just in my head I don't know.
"ohshitohshitokayyy." He mutters, gripping my thigh hard to brace himself. "okay, this is happening."
"Captain." Hawkeye greets me, sending me a nod before sitting on the other side of Nat. Hawkeye and I have worked together a few times now - we're both technically agents of SHIELD, like Natasha, so we were assigned missions together a few times. we got on, but I guess its just a professional relationship. theres only so far you can go without knowing anything about the other person.
"uh- yeah I'm not really feeling it tonight, I guess." He tells me, stuttering slightly. "you should dress up more often. I'm also a fan of the eyeliner." I throw him a joking wink.
"Hey Steve?" He says, lightly touching my arm. "I'll let you guys have some time." He tells me, grinning as I hand him the coffee.
"I don't think you will be hoping that soon. you hate me just as much as I hated you." I explain, sending him a smile.
"whats all over Natasha? what the fuck even was this?" I ask, looking up to see Tony walk out of the elevator. I just groan, burying my head back in my pillow. a second later I hear a gentle knock on the door, followed by Tony's voice. thats the last thing I want to hear. the dude I have a most probably unrequited crush on, and just embarrassed myself in front of.
"okay, thats fine, take all the time you need, and bring us some food because you look like you haven't moved since the fight." I joke, smiling as he walks out.
"I've messaged Iron Man, but he's probably in a meeting. we can't count on him." Clint says as we get onto the plane, the door closing behind us.
"well I just visited Iron Man - by the way, why haven't you? - and you missed out the part where you kissed?" she says, raising her eyebrows at me.
"Stick around for a while, show him you're not leaving. It'll be hard - all I'm saying is 3 days. give him 3 days." she tells me, placing her hand on my shoulder.
"Steve you're not even on the track anymore." Tony laughs as he crosses the finish line, Bruce smiling lightly as he says he's finally not dead last.
"okay so back to why I'm here so we can move on from whatever that was, I was here to drag your sulky ass over to Stark, but as it is already sufficiently near Stark, I'll leave you two to it." she tells us, standing up. "oh yeah, and Tony you've been invited to another Avengers meeting, later today. can you tell Cap, Steve?"
"um- yeah J call big green and Cap down." Tony says, his eyes finally dropping to the floor from where they were holding mine hostage.
"are you sure you'd want to? I'm not exactly a super soldier, you know." I tell him with a grin, moving further into his space.
"among other things." I mutter, feeling some of the weight lift. "look, I'm most definitely not ready for
"yeah we really should not be allowed near a kitchen. I'll order something if you destroy all traces of this abomination." Tony says, slipping off his stool, making me laugh. he smiles lightly at me, before wandering off. I'm not too sure what is happening there. Its weird - he keeps inviting me to stay longer, but then acting all hesitant and distant. We're basically just friends now, but more awkward. I can't help but wonder if he's just not into me, and feels like he needs to keep me around. I mean, apart from being shy thats the only reason I can think of, and no one could ever call Tony Stark shy without being laughed at for the rest of eternity.
"oh! lemme take your shield - it looks like it might need a paint job and a new strap." he tells me as I walk out the door.
"what you drive in circles until your friend starts to feel bad?" he laughs, raising an eyebrow at me. I just shrug, suddenly more interested in the small dimples that appear when he smiles just right.
"I really like you, and I want something to happen between us, and I regret letting us stop it from happening." He says quickly after a moment.
"no thanks, I'm using it as an excuse for him to see Steve again." I say, grinning at the ground. I know its stupid - this is probably not even going to work out with Tony, and if it does, I have the problem of Steve and Cap being very similar, but its making me feel like a teenager again, in a good way somehow.
"really? that actually worked? I always found you so easy to read." she jokes, sitting up a bit more to take a sip of tea.
"why does it matter if I'm smart? what does it matter if I fly around in a fucking tin can saving their sorry asses? I'm still just the son of Howard, ultimate playboy, just throwing away the reputation that his father left behind." He says, falling back into my arm.
"hey, I dare you to hide the coffee before Nat comes down." I say with a grin after he's made his coffee. He laughs, grabbing the coffee ground and hiding it in the back of the fridge.
"okay, well you can be my date. doesn't this  just make things easier though?" she asks, raising an eyebrow.
Tony is still sleeping when I get back into his room, so I pull off the clothes I put on for the benefit of any stray avengers, before climbing back into bed with him.
"just calm down, okay? lets go and have some food, then maybe he'll be ready to talk." She says, wrapping her arm around my shoulders.
"ah but you see hun I have ventilation and such to make it feel like it isn't even there." Iron man says, and I chuckle lightly at him. and I feel guilty again. brilliant.
"especially not for you! at least only you have found out about me, 3 people found you out in one day!" I sass back, grinning at him. "right, I'd better get going, I'm meant to be getting back from my run any moment." luckily for me, Sparring with Iron Man lead to me working up a bit of a sweat, so I just throw on a pair of shorts and a t shirt, before heading off to meet Tony.
I roll over in bed, watching the seconds tick by on my clock until my alarm goes off. I stand up and stretch, my back clicking a few times before I head over to the bathroom. 15 minutes later I'm out the house for my daily 1 hour run. When I got out of the ice, I had mandatory counselling sessions which was basically meant to help me "readjust" or some rubbish. It was all about building myself a new life, and letting go of Captain America, but to be honest, I quickly slipped back into the army lifestyle of waking up at 5, then straight out for a run. The one thing that everyone agreed on was that the world should know that Captain America is back, but they shouldn't know its me. SHIELD told the world that a new 'mystery person' will be the new Captain America, so that I can live a relatively normal life.
"mmhmm dream on. all the Avengers are invited, so don't think you're special or anything." He says, standing to help. "it starts at 7. you may as well reclaim your bed for the night, if you want."
I wander into my bedroom, pulling out a pair of tracksuit bottoms after my post-run shower. its been a week since I saw Tony. I know that
"so you should be, I'm impressed." she looks over at me, a loose grin playing over her lips. the minute we make eye contact we both burst out laughing, quickly stopping when we hear someone knock on the door.
"so, got any other new hotties on your radar?" I joke, leaning back. we've turned into surprisingly good friends, giving the last thing I said to him is that I love him. it was awkward at the start, but we eventually made it work.
"maybe one day, if things change." Iron Man adds, making me smile slightly. "I think we have them all."
"Don't worry, I know the Avengers would crumble without me." I joke, smiling at him. "but really, I'm still here. You can call or pop by whenever, you're still my mate."
"you okay?" Nat asks as she sits next to me, some doctors inching closer. I just wave them away, leaning back into my chair.
"yeah- thats why I hadn't visited earlier. I was trying to figure out how to explain. my mind was so blank I've ended up going with Clint's idea." I say, looking down and taking a seat on the corner of his bed.
"Cap. Capsicle. Mr America please I know you're awake!" Iron Man whines while poking me in the side, rolling off me when I open my eyes, a grin on my face.
"So, hows this Steve Rogers/Rogerson balance going so far?" he asks, grinning while keeping his head towards his controls. We haven't gotten a lot of chances to hang out recently - the time I haven't spent with Iron Man I've spent training and hiding out in my room.
"oh yeah. we had all the sex" Tony answers with a smirk, placing his coffee down to wrap his arm around my waist.
"I told him that he didn't have to keep me here just for my benefit." I say after a moment, keeping my eyes forward.
I quickly change into some jeans and a flannel shirt, before walking back into the kitchen to find Natasha.
"uh- yeah you could say that. I managed to make a huge idiot of myself though, I got absolutely off my head and the poor guy had to drag me home." Tony tells me while measuring around my torso. I try not to pay too much attention to what his hands are doing, it would be very awkward for captain America to get a boner from Tony Stark. I can see the headlines now.
"Hey Steve, heard you were coming back." She says, grinning at me. I ended up getting there an hour early, instead opting to get ready with Natasha.
"he's- he's been a bit of a mess since Tony, and I think I may have pushed him too hard. I was just trying to help him move on, but now he doesn't trust me, and he's always making snarky comments. I don't know, he's just been acting weird." I explain, leaning back against the back of my sofa.
A minute later I hear Natasha sigh, before seeing her jog around the corner. I stop my pacing to face her, picking up my hood from where I had abandoned it.
I spend most of the evening in the corner, watching the madness of the party unfold. I know that sounds kind of lonely, but it was actually really nice. I'd normally be out there, flashing my best Captain America smile, talking to all the government officials and having to look
"oh I know, Steve told me. I'm taking him home now, he doesn't need this shit from you any longer. I'll be staying with him for a few days, so call me if anything goes down." I say, my voice staying surprisingly calm. "this," I say, shoving a box into his hands, "Is something he got you for your birthday, so throw it out, burn it, he doesn't care." I storm off, keeping tears from my eyes. The box holds a basic screwdriver, the letter S engraved into the handle. I got it for him before he stormed off, deciding to leave out the card asking him to be my boyfriend. instead I burnt that, the night he stormed out of that pub.
« Sure I can… Tony, this month has been a torture for me. Why didn’t you tell me about your attacks? »
« We’ll do anything for it. I have to talk to Carol. I’m pretty sure she feels the same way as Nat does. They deserve their happy ending, as much as we do. »
« It’s not you Tony… — he wipes his eyes — I am just so tired. I always have to be strong, always have to set the tone, even if I don’t want to. I fight every day along with people who aren’t even 25 yet. They still have so much to discover and they stand here, facing death every second. They look up to me, and they wait for my orders, trusting me their lives. And every time I say something, I am scared stiﬀ of sending them right to their death. I am scared Tony, I’m so scared all the time. And I can’t show it because they need me, because it is my duty not to fail or to show any semblance of weakness. I just want… I don’t know, I don’t even know what I want but I don’t know how much time I will be able to go on like this.»
Even though Tony is faking it, Steve hears the pain in his voice. It breaks his heart, to see Tony suffer and to know that he caused it. That’s why he can’t wait any longer. With one step, he walks the few centimeters that separate him from Tony. Gently, he takes his face in his hands and presses his lips against Tony’s. It’s Tony’s turn to freeze. He doesn’t know how to react. He doesn’t know if he wants to forgive Steve. But the sensation of Steve’s lips against his - this sensation -  is the best thing he has ever felt. Steve doesn’t just kiss him. He tastes him, taking everything to his soul. Steve is in heaven. The softness of Tony's skin under his fingers, the warmth of his lips, the proximity of their bodies... Steve feels like he only lived for this moment. He bites Tony’s lower lip gently, and Tony lets out a moan. Suddenly, he pushes Steve away, breathing loudly.
He can't go on. As he turns to face Steve, he can't believe what he is seeing. Steve looks like he has been shot a thousand times. Multiples opened wounds can be spotted all over his body. He is completely bare, all hair gone. There’s so much blood. Everywhere. His old Captain America suit  is entirely ragged.
Tony sighs out of relief: « It’s over now baby. Just keep breathing. You’re safe, I promise, just breathe. »
Steve smiles and presses his hand on Clint's shoulder. Wanting to change his mind, he wanders through the room. There are many people, the Avengers of course but also other people he has never seen. Without realizing it, his steps lead him to the side of the bar, where Tony is in the middle of a conversation with a man. And even though he doesn’t know him, Steve hates him immediately. Not wishing to be noticed, he sits on the other side of the bar.
He thinks about Nat and Clint, Vision and Wanda, Sam and Bucky. All dead. An explosion can be heard nearby, but Tony doesn’t care. He doesn’t care anymore about life.
Steve smiles. « Eternity with you, it sounds like a good deal. » He wraps his arms tighter around his lover. Yeah, eternity seems definitely great to him. It seems perfect. After all, who wouldn’t want to feel at home forever?
« Oh wait! - Tony moves and comes next to Steve - Do I hear something? It’s a sentence… I believe it was ‘love is for children’ » he winks at Steve.
Tony runs in the room as soon as he sees his husband laying on the floor, a single towel covering him. Immediately, he puts one hand on Steve’s forehead and grabs his beloved’s hand with the other. He notices the blood on the floor.
He thinks about Steve. Steve who had always supporting him, who accepted him, who loved him, who he betrayed and who is now dead in his arms protecting him, because of him.
Steve frowns and stares at his glass. Clint bites his lip. He forgot how complicated it was between Steve and Tony. For almost one month, they have been under constant tension as soon as they are in the same room. So that even he never knows if they're going to kiss or fight. When Tony declared his love to Steve, shortly before their attack on one of the last hydra bases, it surprised everyone, Steve first. Not knowing what to do, Steve preferred not to answer and ran away from the room. Tony then shut himself off and has been acting as if nothing had happened. However, Clint noticed the little twitch in his hand every time Steve walks into the room. He noticed that no matter what happens, Tony manages not to be alone with Steve in a room. He noticed that Tony never looks at Steve directly.  But above all, he noticed Steve's look when he lays eyes on Tony, that look that says everything about his feelings.
"Steve, no! » - Tony suddenly wakes up in his bed. He is sweaty and shivering. His heart is beating as though it was trying to come out of his chest.
He cleans it with cotton. Thank God, it is only superficial. No need to call an ambulance. Carefully, he bandages Steve’s arm and covers him with the comforter again. He goes to the kitchen and fills him a glass of water. Steve has been sweating too much and he wants to prevent dehydration. Not without difficulty, Steve drinks it all. He is so pale. His head drops again on the pillow. Tony feels helpless, watching his better half battling against fever. Tears start forming at the corner of his eyes. Seeing Steve like this is the most heartbreaking thing he’s ever noticed. He looks so frail as if a single touch could break him to pieces. He gently strokes Steve’s hair. He wishes he could take all his pain away.
« Why didn’t you call me, moron… » Tony exhales the biggest sigh of his life. Now, all he can do is wait for him to heal. He just hopes he won’t get worse. He tries to stand but a hand catches his arm before he can leave. Tony turns around and looks down at Steve. Semiconscious, Steve whispers something softly enough that Tony bring himself closer to hear.
One tear, two tears crush on the helmet. Steve suddenly feels like a three-year-old boy again. He can’t help but hold Tony tight in his arms, hoping that he will hug him back at some point. He places his hand on Tony’s arc reactor. He wishes, he wishes so hard he could turn it on again. He wants to see that light again. He wants to hear his sarcastic jokes again. He just wants his lover back. A metallic sound resonates. Following his instinct, Steve jumps aside, still holding Tony. He takes a look at the street. There, standing in its middle, the mad titan stares at him, his whole army behind him. An infinite sadness falls upon him. If Thanos is here, it means he is the last one standing. All the others, Clint, Wanda, Bucky must be dead. The wry has no meaning without them, without his family. Slowly, he unties his shield from his arm and puts it next to Tony's inert body. One last time, he looks at it and looks at Tony.
« Oh, so I was supposed to figure this out on my own? I’m sorry not to be a genius then. » Tony replies, openly mocking Steve.
He starts walking out. But as he is about to reach the door, he stops and without looking back at Steve, says: « I think I’ll need a shower after this. - he turns his head and gives Steve a look that immediately wakes up his body - and I think you’re going to join me » Then he leaves.
"okay, come here." she tells me, placing one of my chairs in the kitchen area. she spends the next 20 minutes shaping my almost shoulder length hair into something resembling my old hair cut, making me smile a little. Natasha always comes out with odd talents that no one would expect a spy to have. I then head into the bathroom to shave off the beard that had started growing.
"Ah, Tony! you're... almost not late. good going." she greets him, standing up to wrap her arms around him.
I decide to take the long way home, mainly because I don't want to be driving through new york as Captain America without my hood on, although I doubt anyone would be able to get a good look at me while driving this fast. I drive slowly through the back alleys, stopping quickly when I get a phone call. I answer it, and Hawkeye's voice rings out through my phone.
"sorry just forgot my phone." Natasha says, opening the door and walking in. "jeez, you two look like a pair of teenagers trying to ask each other to the prom." she laughs, unplugging her phone and walking out.
"yeah, sure." He replies with a small smile, handing me his empty glass. I head over to the bar, ordering our drinks from the Iron Man suit controlled by JARVIS.
"you know you don't have to keep inviting me longer just to make Natasha happy." I say in a moment of confidence.
"ah, they found my secret!" I laugh, looking sideways at him. "so you're just, cool with this?" I ask, waving my hand towards my body.
"How the hell did you get in this time?" I ask, rolling my eyes and holding my towel tighter around my waist. I don't like Natasha like that, for somewhat obvious reasons, but Ever since the serum I've always felt awkward about the amount of skin showing. Even my suit used to give me anxiety - I often caught girls staring a little too long. I'm not too dense to know that the whole ripped muscled blonde hair blue eyes look is attractive, but I was never attractive, so to be honest I don't really know how to tell girls that I'm not interested, so I'm scared there's someone that thinks we're something more but I'm just to much of an idiot to notice.
"I just wanted to complain about the fact that I have to go in today." He moans, running his hands over his face.
"oh- uh Robertson." I respond quickly, cringing at how close it is to Rogers. oh well, he's very unlikely to guess that I am a superhero who, according to the papers, died in the 40's, so I think I'm safe.
"thanks, that'd actually be really helpful. the vibranuim might be in good condition, but this is the leather strap that Howard made for Steve Rogers back in the 40's" I laugh, handing it over before walking out, before waving at him, making him laugh.
"lets go - Clint has the jet ready to go." Nat says as I shove my shield on my back before racing out of the room.
"well I'd better get going, nice to see you again, Mr Rogers" He says, patting me on the shoulder before walking out. I speed walk into my bedroom, pulling out some clothes and quickly changing.
"where in your mind did you decide that it would be a good idea to wake a supersoldier up like that?" I ask, glaring at her.
"you go for a shower, I'll sort this place out a bit then I'm giving you a haircut." she tells me, pulling me up off the sofa.
"why thank you, now lets go eat and watch something." he tells me, taking my hand and skipping into the living room, making me laugh.
"oh yeah that'd be great. Hey Tony, I'm actually a 25 year old war hero who was born in 1918." I say dryly, glaring at her.
"thats fine. take it slow, see where it goes." she says, grinning knowingly at me before snuggling back into her bed.
"because I am not one year sober. what happened?" I ask, guiding him over to the sofa, which nearly ends up going very badly with the both of us drunk. luckily mine is already wearing off.
"Steve I-" He starts, taking a step towards me, but gets cut off when Clint and Natasha walk in. Clint revealed who he was to the rest of the group within the first week, saying his mask was quote "too bloody hot".
"STEVE the hell?" Tony asks, and I round the corner to see him standing up from where he had ducked my shield, the suit reforming behind him.
"then uh- congrats? I thought you still love him or whatever." She questions, furrowing her eyebrows.
"right. as fun as this was, Tony is very pissy without coffee." I say, walking back inside, stopping by the kitchen to grab my tea and Tony's coffee.
"yeah I saw photos - it looked like your head didn't belong with your body." Nat laughs, nudging me with her elbow.
"his vitals are dropping. you need to get to him, now." He says, and we all start sprinting in the direction he left, before Nat places her hand on my shoulder.
"can I borrow Cap first? his uniform is most likely to be problematic because I made the most changes there." he says, poking his head around the door to wave at me.
"you weren't being stupid, you were telling me how you feel." he says, the bed dipping at my feet. "I mean you know me, thats more than I'd ever be able to do." he laughs, causing me to slowly sit up, bringing my knees to my chest.
"I always forget that guy actually lives here - I think I've only seen him once." I laugh, shutting the door behind me.
"So Steve is dating Tony, but is also Captain America, but Tony doesn't know?" Clint asks me after he leaves.
"gah you hypocrite, I can smell you've had a beer!" He says, punching my shoulder as he pulls away, him seeming a bit all over the place, which is becoming a more normal sight for me. in his lab he is always like this - hyper because of whatever project hes working on and trying to do 7 things at once.
"This has happened because you weren't letting your friends in. when you were fighting Nazis, the commandos were there, weren't they? but you've decided to do this alone, which not even Captain America can do." she tells me, placing a hand on my arm.
"Tony, Pepper said something to me at that gala, and its been playing on my mind." I say hesitantly, placing down my drink.
"It just makes me laugh sometimes when I look over and you're wearing some normal, everyday human clothes, then a fucking balaclava." I laugh, rolling my eyes.
"yep. thats movie logic for ya." he says, shaking his head at the TV. "by the way, you're phone keeps buzzing."
"wha- Nat-" I protest, watching as she lowers the pencil down. she gently runs it along my eyelids, smudging it a little with her finger.
"hey gimme some credit - the only reason I got hit is because that guy snuck up on me, and its just a graze." I say, rolling my eyes as she begins wrapping my arm with a bandage. "my arm is going to be healed by the time you've got that on."
"oh okay, hope it gets better soon. I think Tony is going to pick up your suit at some point so he can fix it."
"ah okay, i'll show up to talk to some fancy people. will I be wanted in my suit or in a normal suit?" I ask crossing my hands over my chest.
"gah Captain, Steve Rogers would be disappointed." he says, poking my stomach, laughing when I scrunch my face up. "hey, didn't you chug a whole bottle of vodka last night?"
"you're the best." Tony tells me, planting a kiss on my cheek before flopping down  on the sofa, making me blush. "didn't you say Cap was meant to be back tonight?"
"Steve I'm- I'm so damn sorry for what I did to you." He tells me as he sits back on his bed, placing his head in his hands.
"yeah sure." she sighs, pulling me into a firm hug. "you better not back out or I'll drag your naked ass out of that shower and down to him myself." I laugh at that, heading towards the bathroom and stripping out of my clothes. After my shower I stand there for a moment, before pulling my hood over my head and making my way downstairs. I quietly walk into Tony's room, Natasha's eyes meeting mine instantly.
"whoa what even is this material?" I ask, feeling the strong yet flexible material between my fingers before pulling it over my head.
"Bucky was.. Amazing. I mean, he was my best friend, he always had my back, no matter what." I say, looking down.
"we um- we thought we were on my level. I guess we lost track of time." Tony explains, causing them to laugh. the door slides open and they step onto the communal level.
"aw, you jealous?" He says, smiling to himself while reading the menu. "also who said that I'm not going to ask her out?"
A creak comes from the kitchen, causing me to jump out of bed. "hang on, theres someone in here." I whisper to Tony, walking quietly towards the door.
"its no problem, thanks for sorting out my tux, although I could have gone and got it." I say, pulling out some boxers.
"Its stupid - a few days ago, we were talking about how we're going to take things slow because we have 'all the time in the world'" he scoffs, leaning his head back. "how ironic."
"okay, I'd better give you guys some space." She says as she stands up, stopping to place a hand on my shoulder before moving on.
"and I can breathe." I say, pulling my hood off as I fall down onto the bed that used to be mine in Natasha's room. "this thing gets stuffy."
"ah yes, Tony has mentioned you. its great to finally meet you." I say with a smile, shaking her hand. "So Tony sent you over to keep me company?"
"well if I'm ridiculous, what does that make my boyfriend?" He asks, mirroring my actions after pressing the button.
"fine. but you better get here in the next couple days to check in. We've found something big, and we need you to check it out." He tells me before hanging up. I sigh, wrapping a towel around my waist and exiting the bathroom. I've been living a great life since I left - theres only been a few missions that I've been called out on, meaning I've been able to spend a lot of time getting back into my old routine. I quickly change, before heading over to the shop to buy some more bread. I make it back in good time, placing my keys in their bowl before stopping still when I hear a noise come from my bedroom. I quickly run across the room, grabbing my shield before standing with my back against the wall. I hear the noise again, this time closer to the door so I throw my shield around the corner, hearing something metal clink against the floor.
"oh yeah of course. he's out at the moment, but I'll go and grab it for you." I tell him, walking off.
"so you're planning to be there as Cap, then to arrive as Steve tomorrow?" she carries on, laughing at my stupidity.
"table for 2?" Tony asks the waitress, flashing an award winning smile at the poor girl, which makes her eyes glaze over slightly before leading us to the table furthest from anyone else - a booth in a room with only one other table filled.
"Okay you're making me want to leave you idiots down there." she responds, her voice suddenly a lot closer.
"Don't worry, if you weren't so scared I'd be shitting my pants right about now." I laugh, keeping a strong hold on his shoulders. the building shifts again and we both turn our heads when we hear something crack, half the roof falling down, leaving the rest at a slant.
Tony strokes Steve’s hair and looks through the window. It was really a beautiful day. The sun was out and the trees were dancing at the wind’s discretion. For once, Tony and Steve were both home, enjoying each other’s company. Those moments were so rare since they always had busy schedules. They had been watching movies and series on TV while eating popcorn for four hours already. Tony was lying on the sofa, with Steve’s lying across his lap and his head resting on his chest. Steve loves being in that position. He’s not sure why, but Tony is a particularly comfortable pillow. He loves hearing Tony’s heartbeat right there next to his ear. He loves the sensation of his head going up and down, matching with Tony’s breathing. He finds it extremely relaxing and could stay there all day.
Steve pulls him into a tight hug. Tony wraps his arms around Steve’s torso and buries his face in Steve’s neck. Steve runs a hand in Tony’s messy hair.  Both don’t matter how long they stay like this. Tony just wants to enjoy their proximity, when Steve focuses on Tony’s breathing, stroking his hair to calm him down. After a while, Tony’s breathing is finally back to normal. He places his hands on Steve’s chest and gently pulls him away. Steve looks at him, worried. Tony notices it, and appeases him:
« I didn’t abandon you! You didn’t even let me the chance to talk to you! You’ve been avoiding me for weeks! When was I suppose to answer? »
Tony nods and goes to the bathroom. Five minutes later, he is all set up. He comes back to Steve, who is sitting on his bed.
« Tony, look I know this might not be the right time to tell you this. I probably should have called you before but you know I was really worried and I don’t know maybe I thought I was my fault and I know it took me a while to realize it but I don’t want to let you go even if it means you have to hate me. When I lost Peggy, it was too difficult. It can’t afford to lose you too. »
"they only love you because you're giving them attention." Tony tells me, turning around. "this is U, the one bugging you right now is Dum-E, and the one in the dunce hat is Butterfingers."
She is right though. I guess it wouldn't hurt to try and have a better relationship with the other avengers, even if it does feel like i'm cheating on Steve a little. I mean, we aren't even dating, so I really shouldn't feel guilty. I quickly step into my Iron Man suit, letting the metal fold in around me. When I hear footsteps on the stairs I quickly snap my faceplate down, before turning to face Cap.
"are you sure you want to come to this? theres going to be a lot of boring conversations, and not much else." Tony tells me as he walks out of the bathroom, a towel hanging loosely off his hips.
"its fine J. whats making you so happy?" I ask, trying to look over her shoulder. she turns her phone around to show me a photo from a few minutes ago, after I just woke up. I'm stretching after standing up, my shirt riding up slightly and my hair a mess.
We ended up going to see some new Disney film for kids, apparently it was the best thing on, but I'm convinced that Tony just wanted to see it. after that we just wandered around a little, and ended up back near my apartment in the early evening.
"you okay? you seem quiet." Tony asks, turning around to give me a puzzled look, breaking me out of my train of thought.
"okay, Stevie, you're hot, but I'm way to drunk for that to be any sort of good right now. anyways, I wanna see where this goes." Tony mumbles, leaning on my shoulder to place a kiss there.
"Thanks I'm really feeling the love and support." I say, instantly feeling guilty. "I'm sorry, its not your fault, I am just ashamed. I mean, I've fought Nazis, and yet one boy has done this to me?" I say, waving my arms around.
"Its really not that impressive." he tells me, busying himself by pulling the dunce hat off butterfingers. I just roll my eyes, knowing full well that trying to get Tony to accept that anything he does is good is a losing battle.
"I still have no clue what you are trying to tell me." I laugh, trying to pull him away from the whole death thing.
"you literally had sex with everyone in Brooklyn - I'm actually shocked you didn't run into Iron Man sooner - or maybe you did, guess you wouldn't know that." she pauses to chuckle, rolling her eyes slightly. "Anyway, why haven't the two people that have a sex drive to match Tony Stark's not done stuff yet?"
"yeah this has literally no body armour in it. If I can't make something better than this, I'm retiring to work as a shop assistant." He tells me, grabbing his tape measure again.
"Nah these are Cap's popular friends. there was a time in high school where he became big and muscly and I was still tiny and that really didnt help with the whole thing." I say, one of my hands waving around uselessly.
"god, one minute hes jumping down my throat, the next hes sympathising with me? that guy is giving me whiplash." I say, laying back on my bed.
"does it hurt when you breathe?" I ask as I feel around his torso, pulling the scraps of his armour off.
"because he can. just be there." Nat says, shutting my bedroom door behind her. Tony groans, rolling over so his head is buried in my chest.
"yeah, I met him around when I met Iron Man. I actually um- dated him for a bit." I laugh unable to stop the grin on my face. "don't tell Iron Man though - I made a non superhuman persona who Tony thought he dated."
"oh- uh yeah we grew up friends actually, we went to school together and stuff. and I think he likes having a place where he can escape Captain America a little." I say, stumbling over my words slightly.
lol  I just googled it and aparently it takes like 5 mins to get from NY to brooklyn. please excuse my Englishness and pretend it takes an hour :)
"if you say so." I sigh, holding my hand for him to use to stand up. "I have no clue how I'm meant to sneak you upstairs."
"I sent a message saying we were heading into this basement because I knew I would lose signal, so the team should be able to work out where we are." He says, flinching when the building shifts. I just sit next to him, wrapping an arm around his shoulder.
"really? I literally thought we were best mates!" I laugh, rolling my eyes. under my mask. "For what its worth, I don't think you're a bad person, you just piss me off during fights." I say after a minute.
"really? we just went through all that and landed back at it having no label." Tony laughs. "right. I'm going to pay, then do you wanna make a day of this?"
"he's unconscious and bleeding, we're going to need you to carry him so we can keep pressure on his wound." she says, a pained expression on her face.
"Its no problem. I'll let you go and get settled." he tells me, before heading back towards his room. The next few weeks go much the same, I mainly stay in my room apart from early in the morning or late at night. we go on a few missions, but its always quite tense, and Iron Man and I always seem to be clashing.
