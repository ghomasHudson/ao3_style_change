“It’s Asgardian mead,” Natasha says. Steve eyes the barrel with newfound respect, noting the ornate tooling in the bilge hoop. “That one’s all for you, wonderboy.” She holds up a bottle of Tovaritch! in her other hand in demonstration, while Clint hefts a jug of Yamazaki. Steve wonders what Tony is apologising for this time.
Xavier studies him, an unreadable expression on his face. Steve taps his fingers on the arm of the chair once, twice, then glances back out the window. His thoughts aren’t safe in this room. He focusses on the slow wave of the trees as they shift and sway in the breeze.
“It’s like,” he says, knowing Tony can’t hear him and feeling equally as though he cannot stay silent and a deep gratefulness for the time to work his thoughts out aloud. “It’s like when my ma managed to get something nice for me. Like a chocolate bar. And I’d hoard it and hoard it and hoard it, sometimes until it was crumbling and stale, because the idea of eating it was so daunting. What if there was never any more?”
It’s an armour of a different kind, Tony knows. He’d been groomed for his position all his life, and yet even after all the years of living in it and running Stark Industries and building past the confines of human imagination, there were always flashes like this; uncertainty, or perhaps the sickening feeling that he was still playing at daddy’s heir, the perfect son, the perfect American man. He wishes that he could say it was all a mask, that the real Tony was the one in grease up to his elbows, playing with wires, but deep down he knows the truth. This, too, is a part of him; it’s a sick and lonely part, nurtured and shaped by Howard, but it’s there all the same. It’s the part of him he likes least about himself.
Mostly, though, I’ve always been interested in what the idea of A/B/O means for sex/gender. I think there’s a lot to explore there, and I like how it makes everyone in the world a little bit queerer. When you start with the idea of women with dicks and men who can give birth being a natural part of the world, transness becomes something that’s fun to play with for me. What does it mean to be trans in a world like that? That’s what I was curious to explore, and this is what I ended up with. Also, being able to just take a week off from work every once in a while to have wild, biologically mandated sex? Kinda sounds like a great universe. I can barely get sick days in the States.
“I love you,” Steve says fervently, and Tony laughs. He peppers kisses all over the side of Steve’s face. “Don’t stop. I think- God, I’m going to come
“The question is not how much you love your country,” General Mattis says, shaking his head. “As far as I’m concerned, you’re all mad sonofaguns to be doing what you do. You’d have to care a damn sight further than most any American to risk your lives against the kinds of threats we’ve been facing the past few years. Especially a man like you, Stark, who could sit on the sidelines like that snake Hammer and get rich while sending someone else to do your dirty work. But no man is infallible. That’s why we have a balance of power. It’s why the president doesn’t have unilateral control of the country. You can’t just be doing whatever you damn well please, no matter how noble your ideals.”
“She’s picking up tricks as he lays them out for her,” Clint observes, and Tony nods, because he’d noticed that too. Loki was teaching her Asgardian knife fighting, in his own way. Tony had no idea what the fuck that meant, but he was sure it meant something. “When she begins to catch up, he pulls out something new.”
“Agent Romanov would like to know if hot cocoa would be apt for this clandestine conversation, or if it would ruin the drama of the scene you’re setting.”
“Would you?” Tony rasps, one foot slipping out to hook around Loki’s ankle. Loki watches him, slim and predatory as a snake. “You might help an enemy if you wanted something.”
Steve pauses, halfway through spooning some duck stuff over white rice. “I’m not fragile.” It comes out differently than he wanted it to; angrier, maybe, or more vulnerable. JARVIS, to his credit, says nothing immediate. “Sorry, that was. Uh. You’re probably right.”
Steve shrugged, turning around to the sink and washing the container out by hand. He put both the takeout container and the spoon in the dishwasher to dry.
“He said he wants to be a good soulmate,” Tony grumbles, his lip curling into a sneer. “I tried telling him he wasn’t obligated and he got angry. Then he hid in the gym, like always. I’d tell him to move in there if he didn’t mysteriously disappear every time I need to use it.”
“Did you think I’d leave you out there?” Tony asked. Rogers didn’t say anything, simply pressed the cold tip of his nose behind Tony’s ear. “Steve.” He was testing, a little, but also helpless to Rogers’ insistent warmth.
“It’s just biological compatibility!” Tony snarls. He gets up and begins to pace the circumference of the lab again, executing a sharp turn when he hits a corner. “He hates me.”
Steve knows, in this moment, that this sight will eat away at him for the rest of however long his consciousness abides. It is powerful enough to supersede the image of Tony wrapped in nothing but bright crimson fabric, draped over his hips like some kind of glorious Roman statue. Here, Tony is naked in the entire, golden and beautiful in the lamplight. Steve can see the tendons of his thighs straining, the small divot at the place where they meet groin a shadow that Steve desperately wants to press his tongue to. His gaze lingers there, because he knows that anywhere else he might look is more treacherous.
He didn’t mean to do it, but whatever Ben Ulrich has to say in response to that question is met with a roaring in his ears. To his left, Thor is looking at him with some concern, expression pulled tight as he stoops down to gather the ceramic shards up with his fingers.
“You’re dressed,” he says, waving a hand at Tony vaguely. “I’ll just have to. You know.” He hooks a thumb over his shoulder, feeling awkward when Tony’s expression doesn’t change. “See you in fifteen?”
Loki stays there for a moment, breathing hotly against Tony’s neck, Tony’s hand still tangled in his hair, the other gripping his bicep. He’s shivering with the aftershocks, lethargy flowing through him, and he hisses when Loki eventually pulls out and rolls to the side, one hand on Tony’s chest. His fingers trace the arc reactor, follow his sternum to his navel.
“I’m not doing anything,” Steve says, completely unconvincingly, and Tony huffs a resigned laugh. He uncoils himself from around Steve’s limbs, swishing his tentacles around in the water to wash away the tight, itchy sensation caused by Steve’s sweat.
“I’m going to try something,” is all the warning Steve gets. Steve raises his eyebrows, reaches out to tap a question into Tony’s shoulder. He doesn’t get the chance before his body is slipping away, being compressed down the way he’s used to feeling when he travels between his body and Tony. The world peels away from him, Tony as well, and he squeezes his eyes shut at the disorienting feeling of it happening without his intent.
“Well,” Tony says, ignoring the slight stiffening of Loki in his lap, “that’s one way to deal with a panic attack, I guess. Not one I’ve ever chosen, but I mean, if it works for you, go for it. Not sure I’d do that myself, but everyone has their own coping mechanisms-”
"Save Clint," he tells him. Loki's image flickers for a moment. "He's gonna be the one you have to convince."
Clint looked up from his screen, tilting his head to the side before the callous visage of the sniper slid down like a portcullis. “Yes, ma’am.”
“So,” he says, and then pauses, glancing around the table as though begging someone to interrupt him. His gaze snags on Natasha, but her face remains impassive, and finally he lets out a quiet huff of air and wets his lips, turning to Tony with an expression that makes him want to bolt from the table and straight down into the workshop. “Xavier said I haven’t got any of Amora’s influence left rattling around inside my skull.” Steve’s voice is all Brooklyn as he taps at his own temple, a little rough with nervousness, and Tony blinks at him and waits for the penny to drop. No one at the table seems at all surprised or even intrigued by this information, which means they’d discussed it before he showed up.
sins. He wonders if he can stay here. He doesn’t want to go back and watch Tony go through the motions for hours, pretending to be fine when inside, he’s falling to pieces. He wants Tony to stay out of the public eye, to go home to where people he loves can fuss over him.
“You thought I would be rough and demanding?” Loki asks, hitching Tony’s right leg around his hips and sliding a hand up his skin. He touches the injured side of Tony’s mouth, eyes glinting. “Did you take me for someone coarse?”
“Barnes was working with Amora. He nearly killed Rhodey. He was in the compound with you when we rescued you. You
All of this to say, when he wakes up with his head pounding, feeling like he’s ready to throw up everything in his stomach and half his organs besides, it’s an unfortunately familiar feeling. What’s less familiar is the warm hand brushing through his hair, an unwelcome physical stimuli considering how much pain he’s in.
, you really like this, huh? Having me at your mercy?” Tony gasps, trying to get his wits about him. “Jesus, you’ve got the mouth of a pro-”
There was a crackle of static over the speakers, but the fighting was winding down now. Steve couldn’t have pulled his eyes from the little blinking red light if he tried.
“We’re in trouble,” Bruce says, looking grim. He’s sitting at the head of the table with Loki at his left, both of them bent over a StarkPad. “And SHIELD can’t help us overseas anymore. We’re on our own, here.”
Tony waves a hand and climbs into the back of the car, scooting over to make room for Steve. “Let me guess, Pepper spoke to Happy, and Happy and his big mouth?”
“We have,” Shuri admits, and Tony grins. “But for now, come and let me scan you again. We’re going to go over the igniting incident and see if anything interesting happens.”
“Yeah, go ahead.” He hasn’t even finished speaking before the familiar seeping burn of Loki’s healing magic sweeps over him, a little rougher than he remembers. The tingling it leaves behind is less pleasant, sharper, and he hisses a little at the flare of pain, rotating his shoulder in the socket. It moves seamlessly, no clicking or aches, and Tony laughs and turns, measuring Loki’s tired face, the sallow skin below his cheekbones. “Fixed a little more than I expected, there.”
“Because you think I’m a beautiful, pragmatic genius,” Tony says, equal parts smug and terrified, and then he kisses him, because he can’t think of what else to do.
Tony hums a soft, questioning noise. He traces the bowed curve of Steve’s spine, fingers dipping into the crease. The callouses on his hands are rough, and the scrape of them over his skin makes Steve shiver with aftershocks against Tony’s body. It’s enough to make Tony grin, his eyes still shut tight.
Eventually, he forgets all about Steve. He’s six hours into an engineering binge, having discarded the idea of perfecting nanites in a timely manner but instead considering if perhaps he could reach out to the mutant community, when something pulls him out of his fugue. He closes his eyes and breathes in deep.
Steve groans quietly at the idea that Tony is so overcome that his beautiful brain hadn’t been able to parse Steve’s tapping. He sucks a kiss behind Tony’s ear, under his jaw. Then he pulls back slightly.
“Oh, God,” Tony gasps, arching under him, and Steve pants out a breathless laugh into the sensitive, mouth-wet shell of his ear. “
“Then that might change,” Tony agrees, closing his eyes. “Fuck. We humans just keep fucking up in the same ways, don’t we?”
“Captain,” she says, evenly, and Steve swallows. He holds up the small bouquet of asphodel and hyacinths he’d brought with him, now looking so foolish and plebeian in the face of Pepper’s composure. He always felt this way around women like Pepper, but this was particularly embarrassing, when he knows that he’s done something wrong to earn her ire. It’s worse than just the generalised anxiety and wrongness that he always feels around beautiful, competent women; this was personal, and justified. He knows exactly how kind Pepper can be, when she thinks one is deserving of it. He’d simply been moved out of that category, and into one that Tony needed protecting from.
He’s dressed as inconspicuously as he could manage, so as to look least like himself. He’s got a baseball cap on, one of Tony’s stolen t-shirts, a hoodie and sunglasses and jeans. He does his best to avoid anyone’s eye, even as he passes tributes with his shield on them and murals with his face. When he gets to the white-pillared building he stops and looks up at it: the tall columns still standing like sentinels, holding up the peaked roof with its little cross. It’s beautiful. It’s still here.
“Right, so, avoid the scary boyfriend.” Clint glances up at the ceiling. “Why do we do this job, again? Somebody remind me, because I can’t seem to remember why I’m living in a tower that’s basically a giant target for the villains of the world and intentionally putting myself in a position to fight somebody who’s called the Executioner.”
“Tony and I are secure,” the voice said, and Steve felt himself slump, his whole body reeling from relief. “But you can’t come inside.”
“Nope.” Tony nodded towards Bruce, whose eyebrows were raised. Apparently he hadn’t known that, either. “I learned my lesson last time, so I figured someone on the team should know, in case things went south while we were in the field. Pepper’s clearance doesn’t always allow her to keep up with what we’re doing. Bruce’s got the medical degree, and at the time we were closest. Logical choice.”
“That’s no fair, reading me so easily,” Tony pouts, just to watch Loki laugh. “I’m very clever and unpredictable.”
“You are such a little shit,” Tony says, and then he leans down and takes one of Steve’s nipples into his mouth, because that’s enough talking, thank you very much.
“Please,” he whispers, and Tony tilts his head back, opening for Steve’s onslaught. “God, I thought I’d lost you. I didn’t- I can’t do this without you, Tony. You’re- I couldn’t do it. I didn’t know what to do, I was going out of my mind and I left Tash in charge on base and I’m-”
“So, you think people with prejudices being presented with war atrocities was good, because it inspired empathy in them?”
“I'm afraid, Sir,” JARVIS deadpans, and Tony jams his finger into the elevator button hard enough to hurt. “Would you like me to read you the list of U.N. committee members for the accords?”
Eventually, Maria Hill appears at the door, about seven minutes into Tony’s usual checks on Steve’s status logs. She leans against the wall for a long time, not speaking, and Tony doesn’t bother to acknowledge her. Finally, she clears her throat, just once.
Beth sighs. She reaches into the cupboard under the sink, and pulls out some clean clothes: an old blue t-shirt and sweats. She passes Tony the sweats, keeping her body angled away from him in some farce of modesty. But when she unfolds the shirt, she stops. She reminds Steve of nothing so much as a wind-up toy, suddenly out of turns. A look of intense betrayal crosses her face. There is no other way to describe her expression, and Steve moves a little closer, curious. Then he covers his mouth with one hand, because of course. Of course this is the shirt that Tony keeps in the workshop for when he’s too tired to go upstairs and change and face the world. Of course this is the old, comfortable clothing Tony keeps squirreled away down here in this small, private bathroom.
For a moment he doesn’t understand what he’s looking at. There’s a lot of pale skin, and he thinks maybe Steve has his phone pressed to his ear still. But then the camera moves away, and slowly, with the delight of the very, very inebriated, Tony discovers that he is in fact staring at Steve’s strangely hairless, impeccably sculpted, downright edible pectorals. There’s a flash of pink nipple, the top of his abs, before the camera is trained on Steve’s blushing face.
On the big screen, grainy CCTV footage of a green sludge monster smashing its way through Kings Plaza begins to play. Coulson has the good sense to wince.
, Steve thinks, standing outside of Tony’s bedroom in the penthouse. He isn’t here, Steve knows. He’s being a coward again. He sighs, drags a hand over his face.
Tony exhales sharply, pulling away, but Loki doesn’t let him get far. He slips his hands around Tony’s neck, sliding his fingernails gently over the back of his skull in a way that makes Tony want to curl up and be pet.
“No, no, stop that,” Tony says, waving a hand. His heart feels like it’s going to climb out of his chest.
Quietly, he disentangles himself from the pile of limbs in the centre of the bed, letting Lacey and Michelle find each other in their half-awake flailing and curl up in a sweet little ball in the middle of the bed. Tony appreciates the view for a moment before turning around and hopping into the shower. There’s absolutely no way he can go home smelling like this.
Thus, if you’re a queer looking for resources, please feel free to ask for some guidance! Some US-centric links, for the uninitiated:
Tony shoots Loki in the face, then in the gut for good measure, forestalling any cute jibes from him. Suddenly, he’s angry, about all of this.
Tony watches him work, his hands mixing and adding and mixing again. There’s a tightness there that Tony knows well, and he glances at the nearest security camera meaningfully before moving to rummage in the cutlery drawer for a butter knife.
Steve knows from experience that Tony's plots usually end up being wondrous and strange, so he lets Tony drag him down to the garage without protest. Tony had taken him to Sleep No More last month, the two of them running around like mad creatures in the narrow halls, chasing after Shakespearian characters come to life. The month before that he'd driven Steve up to The Cloisters for a closed tour, then left him to sketch tapestries to his heart's content while Tony sat in the shade, sipping a lemonade and fiddling with his tablet. Steve isn't sure what to make of these adventures, only that they always make themselves known when he is feeling particularly sorry for himself and sleep begins to evade him again. He suspects JARVIS's hand in the plot.
There were downsides, to having to wear a disguise if he wanted to hold Tony’s hand in public. When he and Tony went to the theatre, and Tony looked so good that the desire to lean in and press a kiss to the corner of his mouth was so strong it was like a physical need, Steve had been forced to wait until they’d gotten home. He’d taken Tony apart so thoroughly that he hadn’t been able to stand under his own power in the morning, and Steve had carried him to the bath and washed him from head to toe with slow, worshipful strokes, because Tony never let Steve take care of him the way Steve wanted to. Tony deserved that much. He deserved for everyone to know exactly how well he was loved, and how beautiful he was, and that Tony was more than deserving of Captain America’s friendship—
“Nah, she’s the Red Queen, obviously,” Tony says, reaching for a piece of toast. Thor lifts the plate towards him with a nod, and Tony offers him one in return as he snags a few slices for himself.
Steve rolls Tony over onto his side, spooning up behind him and tucking his nose behind Tony’s ear. One arm curls up under Tony’s head, fingers twining into his hair as Steve eases his way inside. It’s a sweet slide, with Tony as relaxed as he is, and he melts back onto Steve’s shoulder with a soft little sound of contentment.
Still, he knows Cap’s biology. Maybe better than Cap does, even, and certainly better than the average doctor. This was Howard’s great triumph, and he knows what Cap’s metabolism, stamina, vitals should be. He knows that Cap has been well taken care of, physically; all the better to get the secret of the serum out of him.
He’s still getting used to that. It feels strange, almost, to be confined to a body. He raises his hands, looks at them in the light slanting through the windows. He turns them over, feels the warmth of the morning sun on his skin.
“Turn over,” Tony demanded, pulling back and hooking a hand around Steve’s thigh to flip him when he didn’t move fast enough for his liking. Steve was dizzy with arousal, fugue, and bond-sickness. He felt like his whole body was made of taffy, like he was melting under Tony’s touch.
Tony puts down his tools, because this warrants his full attention. He turns to the screen, stops fighting his grin, and lets Steve sit in his victory. The man's earned it. Steve's watching him carefully, his expression pleasantly neutral. His eyes are brighter than Tony's seen…maybe ever. They're engaged, intelligent. He's studying Tony like the famed tactician he's said to be.
“Yeah, see, that? That’s why I didn’t tell anyone. I’m not crazy, Stephen. It’s a compulsion, but I can feel it. I know when it’s happening. Captain America didn’t rape me, shit.”
Steve hums, walking back towards the kitchen. He washes out his bowl in the sink and recycles the empty takeout containers, then roots around in the fridge for something suitable. Eventually, he settles for making Tony a turkey sandwich and a cup of black coffee. He cuts the loaf of good sourdough with Tony’s fancy breadknife, sharp, crumbling cheddar, a ripe heirloom tomato, a few leaves of lettuce. He eats the rest of the tomato raw as he adds some mustard. All good quality, of course, as befitting the Stark household. He tucks a box of Savannah Smiles under his arm, then heads for the elevator.
"So this is who you are under all that aw shucks bullshit, huh?" Tony asks, because he's not going to take this lying down. If Steve wants to play, he'll damned well play.  "You're a mouthy little brat."
Rogers’ Irish skin betrayed him. It was one of Tony’s favourite things to see, and he made sure to jostle Rogers out of his way with his hip as he passed.
“I always want you, and you’re just so easy for me, alpha.” He gasped as Tony shifted, pressing more firmly up against him, and oh. He was probably going to come again.
Something hits him from behind, hard enough to force him to his knees. He rolls over in time to dodge a second bolt of pale green light, firing back only to hit a very familiar energy shield. Amora is standing there, eyes wild and red, hair waving of its own accord with the strength of the power humming from her hands. Tony can feel it in his chest, like a strong bass beat, and he fires a few missiles at her to distract while he pulls himself up again. He keeps firing as he powers his way to the green light in the centre of the parking garage, dodging around thick pillars and using them as cover as Amora rallies.
“Yeah, oh,” Steve says, wry. He chucks Tony under the chin. “Are you taking care of yourself, at least?”
“No,” Tony said, and Steve closed his eyes, desire swimming in his blood like a drug, taking all of his thoughts, his shame.
“Friend Steve,” Thor called, and Steve turned around, startled. He’d forgotten Thor was nearby. “I shall stay with the good doctor, if you would like to make your way upstairs.” He grinned. “I am large, and space is limited.”
“If I may, sir, the captain asked that you not to make him wait too long. As that is the first open slot in your schedule for a date-”
"If it came through the United States Postal Service, sure, it would be. But seeing as it was magically placed on my bedside table, I'm not overly worried." He pauses, uncharacteristically reticent. "SHIELD has been scanning me and running tests all morning. I'm perfectly healthy, and have somehow regrown my tonsils."
“Yeah,” Tony says. He nods, just once, for emphasis. “I’m…I know I lash out, to protect myself. It’s a bad habit, and we both know where I get it from. But.” He swallows. “God, I don’t want to be like that. I saw what it did to my mother. I’ll…admit what it did to me, even. So I-… People keep saying you should know better, but I’m older. Or, more experienced.
. Rhodes is your military liaison. Pepper is your CEO. Happy is SI’s head of security. You tried to give me a lab. So it’s difficult for you to imagine that maybe being Sight Bonded to you isn’t a burden for Steve, but something he’s always wanted; a dream come true that he’s terrified of ruining more than he already thinks he has.”
“Which isn’t death!” Tony snarls, low and fierce, but Steve’s already shaking his head. “Listen hypocrite, you want to shout at me after every battle for not falling in line like a good soldier, huh? Look what happens when I listen to you: you get a pregnant woman and her puppy-”
“Tony,” Steve says, expression a rictus of guilt and frustrated confusion, “please tell me what is going on.”
“I am a creature of shadow and illusion, Stark. It is no mark on your ability.” He yawns widely, combs long fingers through his hair. “I suppose I could eat.”
Tony doesn’t wait for an answer, just slips silently out the door. He can hear Rhodey shadowing him, and he pauses in the hallway while Rhodey shuts the door on the hubbub. He heads down the hallway at a clip, putting a hand to his earpiece.
Steve shook his head, breathing slow. As he watched, Tony’s hand crept in, fingers closing over Steve’s fisted hands.
He remembers, with a distinct kind of clarity, reading Charles Bukowski’s “Bluebird” for the first time. He’d picked up
Steve narrows his eyes at Tony, almost playfully. Then something in his face softens. He looks down, away from the screen, and sighs. "I thought about the things you said for a long time. First I was angry." He snorts, an incredibly human sound that Tony's never heard him make before. It's strangely charming. "I'm still…angry is too small a word. But now that I’ve had some time to sit with it, I can admit you were right about some things."
“Fuck me,” he gasped, eyes rolling back as Tony came back with two fingers and then his tongue, hot and wet and everywhere. He rocked his hips back, whining at how good it was, how good Tony always made him feel. “Oh, alpha, my alpha,
"Only if you promise to teach me the names for all your armour bits," Steve bargains, and Tony laughs.
Tony shrugs. “I have congenital adrenal hyperplasia,” he says. “Excess alpha hormone.” He gives Steve a careful look. “Do you want specifics? If you’ve read
“I’d like to hear the story, sometime,” Rogers said, the first thing since they’d touched, and Tony took a shuddering breath and closed his eyes under the onslaught of Rogers’ tender attentions.
“The cryochamber is hermetically sealed, and for good reason,” Tony says. “Are we sure this is a good idea?”
“My brother is more feline than insectoid, ‘tis true,” Thor agrees. Already, there was syrup in his beard. His plate looks like a crime scene set in an IHOP.
Tony does as asked, then dips a pinkie into the dark, viscous liquid and slips it into his mouth. “Mmmm, cinnamon?”
He shrugged, and began pulling things out. Tony didn’t really like vegetables, but he made himself eat them after all the trauma his body had been through. Steve was glad that he was trying to take care of himself, but he didn’t like the way Tony approached food, like it was fuel for an engine. He did his best to make things that Tony liked that were still healthy: egg white kale and spinach omelettes, yoghurt with fruit, whole wheat toast with nut butter. If Steve let him, he’d drink those horrific sludge-green smoothies all day.
Loki frowns, hurt flashing across his face, but this time it’s faked. Or at least, Tony thinks it is. He’s learning. “Your injury is my fault, is it not?”
Reed turns to glance at Tony over his shoulder, one eyebrow raising almost comically. There is an uncomfortably inhuman quality to his expression when he loses track of himself like this: like he’s a caricature of himself.
“Maybe for idiots who don’t think omegas who can bench-press an SUV are smoking hot,” Tony retorted. “And who cares about idiots?” He pulled up his pants, now faintly wrinkled, then tucked his shirt in before closing everything back up. The overall affect was still devastating, because while the charcoal suit was tailored beautifully and fit him like a glove, he definitely looked debauched.
Here we finally see how Tony and Steve got together/the two of them reconcile/questions are answered! Yay! Tbh most of what's left is porn, but I know that's why like half of y'all are here, let's be honest. >___>"
The door slid open with a low hydraulic hiss, and Steve swayed on his feet, catching himself on the door jamb. The scent was enough to make him whine, involuntary, the smell of sex and bond pheromones, of
Tony had nothing to say to that. Silently, he squeezed Rogers’ fingers and then turned, heading back out into the snow.
Steve pulls the hand out from where he’d rucked up Tony’s shirt, splayed broad across his lower back, easily lifting him up. His expression is horrified, and Tony shushes him.
“We thought that Natasha wasn’t affected, but what if she was?” Tony says, pacing back and forth behind the bar. “I now have video proof that Amora can affect women. It makes sense for Barnes to avoid security footage, that I get, but Nat doesn’t appear on the security footage until after she took Barnes down. Why would she do that?”
“You know how I feel,” Steve says. He’s quiet, but firmer this time. “I just wanna know where we stand. I…you’re a good friend, Tony. I don’t wanna mess that up. I’m sorry I’ve been such a coward about it, but with everything that’s happened, you…” Steve clears his throat.  Tony takes a long sip of coffee. “It’s important to me. This…this. So. If this is what you want, then. Then let me know, and I’ll back off, but if not-”
Tony had been the one to extend the olive branch. Steve wasn’t sure he deserved it after he’d been proven wrong in such a nuclear fashion, but Tony had used that branch to build a safety nest of routine and casual intimacy so fast that Steve didn’t even notice he’d been falling before he was caught, held safe and warm in Tony’s regard. He’d been floundering in the new world, and Tony had seen him and pulled him up. He’d given Thor a drinking buddy to have the kind of raucous remembrance of home that he so missed. He’d given Clint open access to the roof and someone to trade vicious barbs with, someone who wouldn’t shrink from his anger or treat him like he was spun from glass. Tony broke people down and played them like he did his machines, testing their sounds and their abilities, then quietly providing them with everything they needed to function at peak capacity. Steve would have bristled at it, if he wasn’t so ashamed.
Tony’s mouth is suddenly dry. His thoughts must show on his face, because as he watches, Steve’s pupils dilate. His throat works once, twice, breath clicking in the fine column of his trachea. “Yeah?”
“It wasn’t until after Project Insight that I realised who he was. To Steve, I mean. To America.” Natasha shrugs languorously, tilting back in her chair. “I know that Steve thinks of Barnes as his, but he’s been awake for a lot longer than Steve. He understands the modern world. He’s helped shape it, mostly for the worse. He’s not the man Steve knew.”
Finally, why A/B/O? Well, honestly? I needed Tony to be trans, and I wanted a way to make the stakes of him being off his hormones higher, and I needed him to be transmasc in a way where it was possible for a partner of 1.6 years to hypothetically just…not notice. Phalloplasty/top surgery hasn’t progressed to a point where that’s super possible for trans men right now. However, adding extra erectile tissue to an existing penis in a universe where Dr. Cho can just straight grow Ultron a whole body if he wants? Eh. I know hypothetically she could grow a dick and stick that on someone, but this seemed more believable because a relatively ironclad suspension of disbelief when it comes to hormones/genitals is already so necessary for A/B/O. When someone goes on T, their clit enlarges, so the idea that someone on alpha hormone would grow a small knot seemed plausible to me. The rest of A/B/O is primarily all pseudoscience around hormones, pheromones, and the endocrine system. All of that is perfectly in line with HRT, and pretty much everyone in the A/B/O AU experiences multiple orgasms (except for beta males, which seems…really unfair now that I think about it, huh) so there were no other major changes I could think of.
“Tell me you didn’t mean it,” Steve says, voice quaking, and Tony doesn’t need to be under a spell to give that to him. The fact that he is means that his mouth moves without his consent, shaping the words, cheapening them.
Tony opens his mouth to protest, then closes it again. He knows a lost cause when he sees one. He’s the closest thing there is to an expert on the immovable object that is Steve Rogers. Instead, he flicks his comm mic onto mute and turns back to Minoru, who’s beginning to look antsy. He knows they’re not on particularly good terms with SHIELD or the government in general, and the whole city is slowly turning into a crime scene crawling with NYPD and agents.
“Pay attention,” Tony tuts, and Steve groans, struggling against his grip. He’s not trying with all his strength. Tony doesn’t think he’s actually stronger than him like this. But he’s strong enough for the illusion of Steve being trapped, and so he watches him squirm for a few moments, revelling in the rare pleasure of his indignity.
“And the idea of that bothers you,” Tony mused, and Steve nodded. “Okay. I think we could do that. How does breakfast sound, tomorrow?”
“Are we allied?” he asks, holding his breath. Loki’s fingers are cool and fine-boned, dragging over the bruised flesh with an aching pain that is swiftly followed by tingling, then numbness.
Steve’s mouth moves to his neck, but Tony can feel him holding back. His whole frame is wrought with tension.
The machine clicks, indicating that Tony’s filled the voice message limit, and Tony drops his head to the worktop wish a gusty sigh. Briefly, he considers re-recording the message, but he doesn’t think he could manage to stomach saying all of that again. It was bad enough the first time.
Pepper raises a single eyebrow at him, and Tony turns further, blinking at the sight of Loki curled into the other side of the mattress, mostly covered in sheets except for a shock of black hair, green eyes. He blinks up at Tony, catlike, and Tony swallows.
Tony Stark has always been loved: by screaming fans, or swooning girls, and sometimes swooning boys. Pepper loved him – loves him, with a loyalty that baffles him. Bruce and Natasha love him, too, but Tony has never been good at understanding people. He doesn’t know why, or what makes them tick. He doesn’t understand patience, or grace. He doesn’t understand how beauty grows out of friendship until suddenly, huh, there she is; six-foot-two in heels and a smile like a jet stream, like lightning striking the edge of a sand dune and leaving a crystalline coral sculpture in its wake. Tony doesn’t understand how love can surprise you. Tony doesn’t know what makes a man, or what alchemical changes have been borne through his blood to make him happier, less of a lush, but he knows what it feels like to have his nerves light up like a Perseid shower. He knows what it feels like, in his chest and his stomach and his spine.
“Good,” Sam says putting the glass on the drying rack. “Captain America makes mistakes sometimes. Reminds everyone that you’re human, somewhere in there.” He turns off the kitchen light, then heads for the stairs, trusting Steve to follow.
“Oh, really?” Tony asked, and the low, dangerous greed in his voice was enough to make Steve moan weakly. “You want me to use you, even after you’ve tapped out? Want me to fuck you while you’re sleeping, until you’re full, until you wake up on my knot-”
Steve smiles. He tilts his head, presses his mouth against the seam of Tony’s shirt for a moment. He savours the feeling of the fabric under the thin skin of his lips, against his cheek. He feels Tony breathe against him.
Tony opened his mouth to ask how in the hell he’d managed that, then closed it again. He wasn’t sure he wanted to know.
“Oh my god,” Tony says faintly. “Your brother is my new favourite person, Thor. I’m sorry to everyone else who lives in this tower, but that’s my final decision. He’s sold me. I’m in, Team Loki 100%. I’m a believer. Is there a temple? I’m there. Let’s go.”
The woman looks even more confused, and Tony extends a hand. “Iron-Man, aka Tony Stark: genius, billionaire, superhero, king of the castle. And you are?”
Steve reaches out. He touches the nape of Tony’s neck. He pulls him into his body, holds him as he shakes apart.
He will never be ready for the way Tony always knows how to twist the knife. He waits for the words to gut him, waits for the slack face of his mother and Doctor Erskine's corpses to flash, waits for the anger to build, and crest, and break. This will flay him, he knows, because Tony always wounds with truth. This will leave a scar long after this moment.
Tony pours out of the armour like a non-Newtonian fluid. His tentacles scrape uncomfortably against the grit of the dirty poured concrete, and he frowns at the workshop floor.
“You’re here, now,” Steve murmurs, soft as silk in his ear, and Tony huffs. “I’m not asking for anything else, Tony. Just.
“Not in the kitchen,” Bruce called tiredly, far too used to these displays by now. Steve smiled bashfully, but didn’t move. Tony was warm and felt absolutely amazing, pressing him up against the counter like this.
“If either of you kick us, there will be consequences,” Natasha drones, and Steve grabs for Tony’s hand with the arm not wrapped around his neck.
Tony hadn’t expected anything different, really. But it was one thing to know, and another to watch it from behind the screen of the HUD, his repulsors up and waiting.
Steve’s whole body locks up. He’s terrified, Tony knows, of hurting anyone, and so instead it’s like he turns to stone. He doesn’t manage to keep his eyes open, his back bowing as his climax shudders through him, jaw creaking audibly as his teeth scrape together. The sound he makes is stifled and almost inhuman, a muffled scream, and some of his come shoots up out of the water it’s so strong, splashing hot over Tony’s wet chest. Tony works him through it, his pulse thundering his ears, weirdly echoed by the feeling of Steve’s against all of his tentacles.
“You’re gonna have to deal with that at some point,” Tony murmurs, knowing Loki will hear him. Loki ignores him, too. “Hypocrite. Let him go.”
The issue, mostly, was Tony’s scent. With Tony pinned under him, Steve could smell everything. There was a low current of arousal between them, harmless enough. He was an unbonded pack omega, and Tony was a bit of an…unconventional alpha. Where most alphas would be snarling, Tony took all of Steve’s abuse with good humour. Even Natasha, cool and unflappable as she was, sometimes betrayed the slightest bit of temper when they sparred. But then, Steve thought that Tony must not be like the average alpha, to be with Pepper. It was clear between the two of them who was dominant. Where Steve would expect frustration and anger, Tony was all happiness, pack, and sex. It was driving Steve absolutely crazy, and what was worse, there was no way that Tony couldn’t smell the arousal on him, too. They’d been too close for that, Tony’s nose skirting dangerously close to his neck, but Tony hadn’t said a thing. He hadn’t lingered, hadn’t touched Steve in any way that might be flirtatious, hadn’t even smirked. He was being…chivalrous, maybe, and Steve hated it.
“It looked like it barely caught her forearm,” Bruce said, flipping forward a few frames to see where Williams went down, clutching her arm. Now that Steve was watching, the motion looked exaggerated. She was faking being more hurt than she was.
Tony isn’t sure he believes him, but he lets it slide. “Your little shower fantasy can be arranged,” he offers, and Loki’s eyes light up. He grins back at him, trying and failing to not be charmed.
“No, thanks for taking me on at all,” Steve says, shaking his head. “I know you’re busy.” He clears his throat. “I’m, uh. I know you sent documentation saying there was nothing wrong with me, but how long do you think we’ll be having these appointments for?”
“Tony!” Steve manages. He’s unaccountably glad that Tony can’t see his face. He stumbles forward and gathers himself, then gently presses his hand into Tony’s. As soon as he’s sure it’s solid, he scrambles into Tony’s space, cupping his cheek. He presses their foreheads together.
noticed Tony’s scent yet. He’d been too preoccupied, and now it’s all he can focus on. Tony smells incredible—like a mistral crossing the Rhône before a storm. He smells like lightning, and coconut, and warm ocean-y sweat. Steve takes a slow, deep breath and his knees almost go out from under him. He reaches a blind hand out for the elevator railing, does his best to lean against it casually. He is under no illusions that he succeeds.
Tony sucks in a shaky breath. “It’s weird,” he admits. “Hey, you like art. Are you a fan of Hokusai, perchance?”
“I would if I could get this damn thing off,” Tony muttered, shaking fingers slipping on the apron string. “I…I was trying to lay off a bit, today.”
“I don’t think he can go too far from me,” Tony says, clearly having decided to…well, Steve might say give up the ghost, if he was feeling at all inclined towards humour. It was the kind of joke that would leave Tony groaning. “I feel a tug. Sort of like I’ve forgotten something important. I can’t explain it.”
The Steve of right now isn’t thinking much of anything. He’s stumbling away from the blinding blue light beaming down onto Bethesda Terrace, sucking Loki and Thor up into a world he can’t even imagine. Steve’s been confronted with a lot of things he can’t imagine lately: powerful beings calling themselves gods, and flying barges, and Tony Stark being so simultaneously different and familiar in ways that twist him up inside. So far Steve’s been clinging to his sanity with all the pain and precariousness of a hangnail, because what else can he do? He feels like if he lets himself stop and think about anything he’ll just unravel bottom to top, like an old sweater caught on a nail.
Steve takes a deep breath. He stares up at the basketball, then walks around the tree, looking at where the branches are putting pressure against the skin of it, where force would have to be applied to knock it loose. Then he takes a few steps back, pulls his arm back, and lets the soda can fly.
“And Loki’s not?” Tony snorts, mouth still full. Steve frowns at him. “I’ll give you a pass for yesterday, since you were pretty fucked up, but you seem okay today.” He gestures at him with the sandwich. “How are you feeling?”
There was a pause, just long enough for Steve to notice, before JARVIS spoke again. “Should I presume that you are asking for the ring size for the third finger of Sir’s left hand?” The AI’s voice possessed a warmth that made Steve smile, a bit of pressure burgeoning in his chest because,
“For you,” Loki corrects, solemn, and Tony near about swallows his tongue. He reaches out a hand, flinching in surprise when it passes straight through Loki’s cheek.
“Is that why we’re fighting?” she asks, not taking her eyes off of Steve and Clint. The corner of her mouth moves, a strange kind of half-smile. It’s almost like the one Tony knows is just for him, but slightly more bitter.
“I should be back by seven,” Tony said, pressing another little apologetic kiss to the shell of Steve’s ear. “You’re feeling a little needy, hmm?”
“You are notorious for hiding your hurts,” Stephen repeats, and Tony frowns at him. “For you to mention the issue, willingly, signalled to me that there were dire circumstances involved.”
“I thought we were allies, at least,” Tony says, watching the counter. He broadcasts his voice to Rhodey’s helmet. “But I’m not so stupid as to trust him. Now!”
The crowd laughed, but mostly people seemed to be holding their breath. SI employees were a lot of things, but stupid was generally not one of them. They knew this was going somewhere good.
At first, Steve was glad that Tony had stopped punishing himself and was relying on his support network again. Now, he isn’t so sure. He thinks, perhaps, Tony reaching out is actually a sign of the darkening skies of his internal landscape. Finding nothing when Friday ran every possible scan she could think of on Steve has been hell on Tony’s confidence in his own sanity. With every day that passes, he looks more haggard. Regardless of whether or not he is provably insane, he isn’t provably sane either. No matter how much he sleeps, he always looks tired. He’s visibly lost weight.
Strange studies Tony carefully, but there’s nothing there for him to see. There’s just his blank face as he gathers his things, flexing his injured arm a little.
Bruce scratches at his brow with the thumb that isn’t holding his blanket on, eyebrows raised. “Yeah, okay.” He turns to the bickering brothers. “Loki, you’re with me. And Thor, you know the rules about the lab.”
“Gyrich,” Loki repeats, stubborn, and Tony sighs against the steady thump of his pulse. He closes his eyes to the smell of him. “Explain. You are upset, and keeping things to yourself unnecessarily.”
“You don’t know that,” Pepper says, but her heart isn’t in it. She opens her arms, and Tony slumps forward, pressing his face into the crook of her neck. “I wish you wouldn’t blame yourself for these things. It wasn’t your fault.”
“I was getting to it!” Tony protests. “Also, using the accent while we’re arguing is cheating. We agreed.”
Tony is fidgeting, fingers tapping on the arc reactor, eyes flitting around the elevator. Steve remembers the fight they had here, only three weeks ago. When he considers it, he can hardly believe how little time it’s been. It feels like it’s been months.
“You’re very easy to read,” she tells him, waving a hand. Pepper laughs at the outraged expression on his face. “Pepper, do you know what this means?”
“Should I have slept elsewhere?” Loki asks, voice rough, and Tony blinks at him, not sure he knows the answer to that question himself. “I assumed-…well.”
Tony’s breath is coming in deep heaves. His eyes are wild in his face, darting over Steve’s face, his body. Steve lifts a hand to his mouth, but when he touches the skin there, he feels barely anything against his fingertips.
He slipped an arm under Steve’s hips, tugging him where he wanted him. Then he hummed, thoughtful, dragging two fingers over the curve of Steve’s ass. There was the distinct sound of Tony sucking on his own fingers, and Steve glanced back over his shoulder to catch the sight of him. His eyes were closed, brows furrowed slightly as he groaned, and Steve could feel a fresh wave arousal and slick wash over him at the sight.
“No licenced medical professional will prescribe them in your current state. If your cortisol levels continue to rise at this rate, you’ll have Cushing syndrome by November 3rd,” JARVIS tells him. “At the risk of wasting my time, I’d like to recommend that you speak to Captain Rogers, or at the very least Doctor Banner. Your heart is already compromised; you’ll be at severe risk for a heart attack within a month.”
“Yes, dear.” He clears his throat. “I sense I’ll be strong-armed into a bit of rest, so I may be sleeping when you come by. Just wake me up, of course.”
Rogers did as he was told, almost meekly. He was bluffing about the extent of his injuries, Tony knew; likely he’d hurt himself in the fall from Liberty’s saddle. There was a nasty blackening bruise across his hip, and Tony bundled him up under the covers and turned to the stove to stoke the fire.
The interviewer’s mouth pinched in a suppressed smile as Tony turned back to her. “But really. Let’s be blunt about it. What does it matter? Does it change my material conditions? Does it make you think differently about the fact that I’m indisputably the smartest man in the world?” He’d winked at the camera, then, like he knew how he sounded and was joking. It’s Tony’s most incredible and infuriating trait—the way it’s so hard to see down to the truth of who he is.
There was a long silence, and eventually Steve nodded to himself and began the trek towards the entrance to the complex. They hadn’t passed Bruce, but the whole thing was a maze. He’d probably taken a different route.
Steve knows what is going to happen. He knows. He wasn’t even nearby when the building fell; the images that are being shown are from his memory of the footage he saw afterwards. But still, when he sees the building, his heart jumps into his throat. He cannot stop himself from running towards it. He cannot stop it from collapsing.
Steve closes his eyes, and takes a deep breath. There’s nothing satisfying in it, because he doesn’t really have lungs. He isn’t really here at all.
Steve leans closer to the screen, eyes narrowing. He’s probably on his StarkPad, from the angle. He’s in bed, leaning against the headboard. His shirt is too tight.
me, when you have a concussion, or when you’re hurting, or when you’ve broken something. I could tell you weren’t telling the truth, or being completely honest, or…I knew something was wrong. So I went through the medicine cabinet, while you were at work, and I found the bottle, and I looked it up-”
“And get reamed out for my lack of patriotism and my inappropriate humour? No thanks,” Tony grumbles. Then, projected out of the suit, “Rhodey, working on borrowed time here.”
“How can you, Steve? We barely know each other,” Tony points out, and Steve sobs like he’s been stabbed. Tony can feel himself choking up, too, but he’s better at this part than Steve. He’s had years of public scrutiny to practice. He knows how not to cry. “I know that you wanted this soulmate thing to work out. I know you did. But it’s making us miserable, Steve. There are hundreds of people out there. Literally billions. Plenty of people who will love you as much as you deserve-”
“Oh,” Tony said, struck silent with wonder. “I don’t know who they oughtta feel more sorry for, then, Sheriff. The town drunk, or the good sheriff who’s only got the town drunk to tell his sorrows to?”
“I don’t want to talk about it,” he says. “JARVIS, call the elevator, since the Blue Meanie here clearly has no intention of moving.”
“Alpha,” Steve murmured, deciding distraction was the better part of valour, and Tony turned back to him, burying his face in his neck. “Do you have any plans for today?”
“But!” Tony says, gesturing with the sandwich again, “you’re fine, and I’m fine, and we have Girl Scout Cookies, which are the best kind of cookies, because you get both cookies and vague feelings of moral righteousness and goodwill.”
“In this way, Steve will never die. He will forever live on as that little voice in our heads that tells us to do better, to work harder, and to forgive ourselves when we can’t. He will always be alongside us, urging us on, loving us as we often cannot love ourselves.”
There was a little tin first aid box his mother had nicked from the hospital. The hinge was busted, and they were probably going to just toss it out and buy a new one. So she’d brought it home and given it to Steve to keep his treasures in: good brushes and nibs, charcoal and ink. Little bits and bobs he’d pick up here and there. Things he didn’t want the mice to get into. He imagines opening it up now, Tony’s picture lying in the bottom alongside all his childhood treasures.
“I’m sorry,” Steve whispered, and Tony took a deep breath, leaning in to press a kiss to Steve’s brow.
“All the more reason why it was important that people were made to go and fight for what was right,” he argues. “I’ll admit not every soldier I met was…well. The term now would be politically correct. But once you got to the camps, you couldn’t deny what was happening. I saw battle hardened men who’d used words I don’t feel comfortable repeating sobbing like babies over piles of emaciated corpses. That kind of thing changes a man.”
Tony goes. He lets Loki pull him in by the tie, sinking down into the lushness of his mouth with a hum. Languor slides over his shoulders like a blanket, and he slips into Loki’s lap with a boneless ease.
“Pillow,” he demanded, and Steve reached a hand out blindly to try to comply, but he was too slow for Tony. He was bent near in half as Tony reached up behind him with one hand, shoving a pillow under Steve’s hips to keep them up in the air. Tony’s other hand scrabbled at his belt, pushing his trousers and briefs down to his knees.
Tony takes a breath, checking his wrists for his cuffs. Then he walks to the edge of the landing pad and crouches, sitting down and swinging his legs off the edge. The drop is dizzying, and one that Tony knows quite intimately.
, Steve wants to say, but he doesn’t. Instead he licks the powdered sugar from his fingers, eyes meeting Tony’s with a challenge. Tony, to his credit, just raises an eyebrow at him.
“Or, perhaps not?” Professor Xavier asks, amused. He blows gently on his tea, raising an eyebrow at him. “How are you feeling?”
Tony is lying next to him in bed. He’d clearly cried himself to sleep, and Steve stares down at his face. He reaches a trembling hand out to touch, his fingertips dipping into the bags beneath Tony’s eyes, through, to the bone. All he can feel is the faintest sense of warmth.
“Fuck,” Tony rasps, fingers clenching in the crinkled plastic sash, and his grainy face looks caught halfway between awe and desire. The corner of his mouth curls, just the barest twitch.
so, I totally meant to update weekly but then a) some personal shite got in the way and b) i had a month long camping and road tripping thing with girlfriend and family with zero internet. sorry! but we should be back to our regularly scheduled programming now.
“I really need you to listen to…everything. Before you talk.” Tony pads towards him, sitting down close enough that their knees brush each other. “Can you…could you do that? For me?”
“I do not mean sexual intercourse on its own,” JARVIS says, and Steve blinks. He can count the number of times he’s witnessed JARVIS interrupt someone who wasn’t Tony on one hand. “I cannot understand the draw, or rather, the need for, touch. I would say human touch, but of course we are no longer trading in just humans anymore. Still, Sir is a human, so I will say that human beings have been proven to require physical interaction with other human beings, in order to appropriately function. Preliminary research would show this extends to other humanoid beings, as well, but the fact remains that this is a metric I cannot measure with the same accuracy as sexual desire or happiness simply by examining behaviours and speech patterns and microexpressions. I cannot measure skin hunger, as it has been called. I can only know when Sir is unhappy, and when he is happy, and extrapolate from there.”
Tony waits, frowning when it goes to voicemail again. He doesn’t know why there’s no one home to pick up the phone at all, not even Wong or Clea.
“You don’t remember,” Tony says, as though this is unsurprising. When he turns to Steve his eyes are sharp, dangerous, and Steve knows now that they’re treading on dangerous ground. “Of course you don’t remember.”
“You might have tried saying: we should remain apart until my curse is broken,” Strange deadpans. “Or, maybe: I have been cursed-”
“Letting ourselves have love, where we can find it,” Steve says, and Tony claps a hand over his mouth.
. And your ma. And I never said anything to him, because he was my friend. I knew it was wrong, and I let him go on like that. So aren’t I responsible for that?”
“Touch me,” Steve is begging, demanding, but Tony doesn’t listen to him. He doesn’t have to, and he’s not ready for this to be done yet. “Tony,
The expression that overtakes Tony’s face is curious, to Steve. Surprise, maybe. He looks up into Peter’s stubborn face with a small smile that’s equal parts trepidation and hope.
“Yeah,” Tony says. He pulls back, leaning over the fetch the lube from the drawer in his bedside table. He hasn’t had much occasion to use it of late, and it’s blessedly full. “You want me to use a condom?”
Steve swallowed, and swallowed, and moaned again, running his hands up Tony’s body to hold on to him, keeping him inside as Tony’s knot swelled impossibly larger inside his mouth. He wriggled his tongue as much he could manage with his mouth so full, knowing how it would feel against the sensitive underside of Tony’s cock, and moaned low in his throat when Tony groaned and thrust up against him.
JARVIS helpfully changes the timestamp on the footage, and Tony watches Steve pull him into the stairwell with inappropriate desire curling in his stomach like an eel.
The kiss that cuts him off is biting and laced with a throaty groan, Steve’s fingers gripping his thigh so hard it’s going to leave a perfect five-point bruise dotted into the skin. Tony’s fingers scrabble at Steve’s shirt, and then his own t-shirt is being pulled up and over his head, coming to wrap around his wrists over the plastic. Steve’s gaze on his body is ravenous, calloused fingers dragging slow over Tony’s stomach, tracing around the top of his waistband and over the sensitive jut of Tony’s hipbone. The shock of pleasure is enough to make Tony’s head knock back into the wall, and Steve immediately moves to Tony’s neck, biting along his jaw. He unbuttons Tony’s jeans one-handed and pulls them down, over the curve of his ass until they can’t go any farther.
“I am leaving a message for Doctor Strange with Miss Clea. She says he is out dealing with the ramifications of the battle.”
He’s going to go back to the tower and he’s going to talk to Tony. He’s going to be what Tony needs him to be. He’s going to figure this out.
His expression is manic, and over his shoulder Tony can see the approaching quinjet, a black spot quickly becoming bigger. The Hulk drops out of it like a bowling ball, and Skurge begins to twitch. “Do you think you can defeat me, Tony Stark? I’ve been watching you. I could ruin you, easily and completely, send you tipping headfirst into madness without ever having to crush your damaged mortal form.”
Loki smiles and dips his head, and Tony takes his distraction as opportunity to pull on his briefs, trying hard for casual and probably missing the mark by a mile. When he glances over his shoulder, Loki isn’t even looking at him, and Tony rolls his eyes at himself and pulls on his jeans.
"I think he's turning himself just fine," Tony says. "He's not gonna come in without Thor. He knows his brother's goodwill is nothing but an asset. He's not stupid, and he'll want that protection."
Steve presses a grateful kiss to his mouth, his jaw, his pulse point. Then he wraps Tony’s wrists in the make shift sash. It’s not quite enough that Tony can’t get out of it, but it’s enough to remind Tony to keep his hands to himself. He hooks his tied arms back around Steve’s neck just to be contrary, reeling him in for a kiss, and Steve goes with a happy hum.
“Oh, God, spare me the biology lecture,” Steve groans. He presses a laughing kiss to Tony’s clavicle. “I love listening to you, but not right now, please-”
“I fucking want you to stay! You know I want you to stay! I want to go home to my private beach and bring you and my sad sack bond mate and meet up with Pep and Happy see how beautiful you all look in the Malibu sun. I want my workshop with the rest of my bots. I want to feel safe in my own fucking skin again. I want to sleep for two weeks. But I have a Fortune 500 company, and responsibilities, and Pepper is too sad about our breakup to be my friend right now, and my stupid fucking so-called soulmate left me, and now you tell me you’re leaving too. So what’s the fucking point of asking when you know what I want and we don’t want the same thing, huh?” Tony’s shouting, now, and he knows it’s stupid. He knows it’s dangerous to rile Bruce up, but he’s angry. He’s exhausted and heartbroken and maybe dying,
When he comes, it’s almost an afterthought. Sometimes sex is like that for Tony, when his brain is going too fast, too far, too hard. His body keeps going while his mind is elsewhere. Still, it’s enough to force a hard reboot, the orgasm sparkling bright through the pain centres of his brain and cutting the migraine off at the knees. As always, the pain flares for a few heartbeats, an unbearable swelling before it fades, slow as the tide receding from the shore.
“Yeah,” Tony panted, lifting his hips, and Steve pressed a small kiss to his belly in silent thanks. He pulled Tony’s sweatpants and briefs off in one smooth motion, then swooped back down to nose gently at the side of Tony’s cock. “Steve.”
And then he’d cursed himself, because Stark was his own man, damnit. He’d proven it fourteen times over, for better or worse.
Steve lets out a low, wanting sound, his eyes black with desire. He sways in place for a half-second, two, then takes a sharp breath and steps into the bathroom, slamming the door behind him.
“You liked being in charge, having me at your mercy. How did I look, squirming for you while you held me down? How did it feel, watching me? Having me there, under your hands, just for you to touch, to kiss, to control and hold and loving every second of it-”
, J. They didn’t deserve this shit. We should have tried harder to get them to release them to SHIELD.”
Tony has watched Steve and Natasha fight before. It’s a terrifying, dangerous dance. Steve is strong and quick. He’s a natural at any sport. Once, Tony had taken him to the Central Park tennis courts, thinking he would have to go easy on him. Tony’s been playing tennis since he was a child, just as Natasha had been trained to kill from birth. One would think there would be no contest, against a man with barely any training, but Steve is engineered to move. He is engineered to perform at peak human perfection, to react on instinct, to know where to place his foot to stabilise his body. He knows exactly where to ricochet his shield to bounce off of six different men, in ways that defy a natural, human understanding of physics.
“Steve,” Tony whispers, and Steve opens his mouth against Tony’s pulse, leaves a sucking kiss to show Tony that he’s here, now, and in the future, and for days to come. “Steve.”
“Stark does not even think very highly of himself, in most ways,” the professor counters, chuckling. He turns his wheelchair, leading Steve back down the hall. It’s a Friday afternoon, and children are milling about with that unmistakable childlike delight at the weekend, climbing over the furniture and playing chase. They all duck around the professor with the ease of long practise. “Anyone who doesn’t meet his standards is easily dismissed, and so as you and I know, there are only a handful of people in the world who can actually meet his requirements for praise.”
“So, nobody’s told you,” she says, apropos of nothing the next morning. Bruce is still sleeping, never an early riser, but Tony hadn’t slept at all. Instead he’d been pouring over the data, wrangling with his own grief about Pepper, even though they’d been broken up last he remembered. The fact that they’d been back together—that they’d been
“Now you know how I feel,” he counters. “Watching you in the workshop with your shirt off, smeared up and down with grease and dripping with sweat…”
Steve whimpered, getting desperate but not quite there yet, but Tony just hushed him. He kissed him slow and searing for what felt like ages, tongues sliding wetly together inside Steve’s mouth. He reached down to toy with Steve’s nipples, rocking into him steadily, and Steve could feel tears now. The tension built higher in his spine with every stroke of Tony’s fingers over his pebbled skin.
“Negative, Iron-Man, you can’t look for Cap on your own when we don’t know where melty is,” Hawkeye pipes in, followed by agreement from the rest of the team. “Wait for War Machine, we’re on our last doombots here.”
Steve doesn’t reply to that. Instead he presses another gentle kiss to Tony’s hairline. “Let’s get you into some water first, huh?”
Thor spears him with a sideways glare, and Tony shuts up. “Part of me hopes for deception, because it would mean that I have not been repudiated. Yet the other wishes only peace and happiness upon him. I certainly would not wish you harm.”
"Hey hot stuff, rockin' the wet t-shirt contest as usual I see." Steve carefully does not react. Dummy rolls by, clutching briefly at Steve’s shirt in greeting. Steve pats him in return as he passes. "How was the run? Save any old ladies from trees, help kittens cross the street..."
Eventually, Steve subsides with a huff, bowing his head. He looks at Tony from up between his lashes. “I’m listening,” he says, and Tony smiles at him.
“Yes, you do,” Steve said, uncovering Tony’s present. It was an image of him and Steve in the workshop, Tony explaining the basic theory of wormholes to him complete with holographic aids. Tony’s expression was rapt, full of manic joy the way he always was when he was caught up in something, but Steve was just staring at him with stars in his eyes. His expression was transparent, smitten. He looked so in love, and it was this that he wanted Tony to see. He wanted Tony to know how much he was cherished, how beautiful he was when he was happy and excited, how much Steve loved him.
Tony shuts his eyes at the wave of guilt and pain that washes over him. He deserved that. He deserves worse. “That’s definitely not true,” he rasps. He fixes a smile to his face, opens his eyes to see Steve’s intense blue glare. “I’ve seen the photos. You’ve always been adorable.”
“Sweetheart,” Steve said, gently as he could manage it, “I don’t think I’ve got anything to worry about. Some stuffy paper pusher who never sees the light of day couldn’t do this, for one.”
The surname is like a knife to the gut when he’s already down, but he clears his throat when Tony begins to look genuinely concerned, trying to compose himself. “Um,” he tries, throat catching. “God, I’m such a jerk.”
Steve pulled a glass from the cabinet and set it on the counter, then opened the fridge and set to pouring himself some juice. Maybe some toast? He shifted on his feet, considering, listening to the sound of cartoons from the living room and the quiet munch of Clint eating his cereal, the steady tread of footsteps approaching the kitchen.
“Yeah,” Tony tells him, and Steve’s smile sparkles at him, white and gleaming, before he leans in and presses a small kiss to Tony’s nose.
“I am on deadline, Steven,” Tony begins, and Steve laughs. He takes Tony’s tied wrists in his hands, untangling his t-shirt and pulling it back over Tony’s head, his shoulders. He breaks the plastic wrap with one firm tug.
“Have you got any of that left?” Pepper sniped, to a series of hoots. “I guess we can run it again…”
“They always leave,” Tony whispers. It’s not quite audible over the slow thump of the chopper’s idling blades, but Steve hears it anyhow. The desolation in it makes the hair on the back of his neck stand on end.
Tony breezes into the communal kitchen to grab coffee and an entire box of raspberries, lifting a tired hand to wave at Luke and Dani. She’s got mashed banana all over her face, sticky fingers tucked into her gummy little mouth. Jessica is standing by the windows, muttering into her cell phone, and Steve hoists himself up to perch on the kitchen island. He leans down and makes a funny face at Dani, but she doesn’t react at all.
Steve, who had been mostly unabashedly watching Tony bite his lip as he scrolled through the movie selection, watches as Tony glances up from his usual perch on the couch. One of Steve’s arms is resting on the back behind him, fingers almost close enough to touch. He hasn’t quite worked up the courage to put his arm around Tony’s shoulders, mostly because he and Tony still haven’t had a chance to talk yet. It isn’t that he thinks he’ll be rebuffed, but more that he doesn’t know what it would mean if he did it and Tony just let him. Bruce is curled up on Tony’s other side, fingers combing absently through Natasha’s hair as he reads something on a tablet.
Beth smiles. She reaches out and claps a hand to his shoulder, her eyes bright. “Give me what you’ve got and I’ll do some digging while you make your phone calls.”
Steve doesn’t want to wait. He wants Tony now. He presses forward, sucks open-mouthed kisses along Tony’s jaw, his neck. He licks into the hollow of his throat.
Steve studies him for a long moment. Three breaths. Four. A small, shy smile breaks over his face. "I think you like me better this way,” he says, slowly, like he’s testing the words out in his mouth.
The mansion is one of the things that Steve had been sure to avoid with extreme prejudice in New York, along with his old neighbourhood and the entirety of south Brooklyn. New York was a chameleon; she was changing all the time, donning new faces, new landscapes, new people. It was easier, in some ways, to feel grounded here when it looked so little like the old city he’d once known, the cobbled streets and the red brick and the sludge.
But Steve can’t do any of those things. Steve is dead, or something like it. So instead he hovers his hand over the back of Tony’s neck, and he skims an ineffectual hand over Carol’s back, and he hopes that somehow, soon, Tony figures this whole mess out.
“Your scent,” Steve says miserably. “I just wasn’t prepared. But if you don’t want to wear your blockers, that’s- I mean, please do whatever you want. I just. I don’t want you to do it because of me. That’s all I’m trying to say. I want you to do whatever you want with your body. I…I get it, now, so if this was to prove a point-”
Steve shifts, just the barest rustle of fabric to betray his movement. There’s an uncomfortable pause, and Tony wonders what exactly the content of that discussion was like.
Tony considers this seriously. Steve had always been running away, when they lived together. From his own bodily responses, from Tony, from conflict. But Steve’s never abruptly hung up on Tony during a video call before. Perhaps the distance gives him more space to breathe.
“If Bruce is the only one, I’m cool with that,” Tony agrees. “If the Hulk gets twitterpattered, we’re gonna have a serious fucking problem.”
Firstly, he’s olive-skinned as his mother, so green is really not his colour. More than that, it’s not even a good green. It’s the kind of green that looks bad on everyone. And
“Cap, inside, now,” Tony says into the comm, not projecting his voice externally. He watches as Cap steels himself, then his body language shifts. Steve Rogers shakes his head stubbornly. “Cap, you stubborn ass, you and Natasha and go inside.”
, he thinks, swiping idly through another holoscreen full of Loki and Amora’s readings, he could really punch something right about now.
“That’s always your problem,” Bruce replies, straightening his glasses. He moves over to a screen. “I think you should supplement your static and targeted anti-magic pulses with a kind of faraday cage.”
“I’m eating,” Tony protests. Reluctantly, Steve agrees. Tony isn’t doing anything any more self-destructive than usual. It’s like the grief is a parasite, eating him from the inside. There’s another animal that lives behind Tony’s eyes, now: something hunted and unclean and hungry. “I dunno what to tell you. I just…”
Steve narrows his eyes at his target. He hefts his makeshift weapon in his hand. Then he lets fly, really putting his back into it.
“JARVIS said we have a situation,” he says, and Tony lets out a rough breath, lips grazing the fabric over Steve’s chest. “Amora escaped?”
There was a pause. “I think, perhaps, there are LGBT-focussed advocacy websites that might be better suited to your edification in this matter,” JARVIS says. “Only, I know that you find it disconcerting when we cover topics involving sexuality. If you would direct your attention to the StarkPad in the sitting area, I can pull up the relevant information for you.”
“I’m sorry,” Steve babbled, baring his throat, and Tony let out a rough sigh, smoothing a hand over his face. “I’m sorry, alpha, that was unacceptable.”
“You never call me just to talk anymore,” Tony simpers, a small smile flickering over his face when Rhodey hangs up on him. “Fuck. Fuck fuck fuck. Where’s Steve?”
Steve could feel the ache of him like a missing limb. The pain of knowing his bondmate was suffering and being absolutely unable to do anything about it was a howling, shaking gale force of a thing inside his chest. Every day he woke up and tracked down Hydra agents in Eastern Europe, bashing in skulls with Thor while they waited for the brains and spies on the team to figure something out. Every day, he took a shower, and he shaved, and he moved with what felt like stones piling up inside of his chest. Every time he wanted to sit down and sob, he couldn’t, so he swallowed it. And every time, he could swear he felt the lump in his throat settle inside of him. He was getting so full of stones, soon his lungs would be full up. Every day that passed without news, Steve felt like it was harder to breathe.
Tony freezes, smile dropping off his face. Numbness spreads through his chest, skittering down his arms. Fear. “What?”
“You know I don’t remember,” Logan says curtly, and Steve holds up his hands in surrender. “Probably for the best. That first costume was an eyesore, bub.”
Steve closed his eyes, tension rippling through his muscles at the thought of Tony being locked up behind glass, being able to see him but not touch him. He was shaking, fists clenched tight, and it felt like several minutes before he was able to grasp hold of himself again, rein his instincts in and realign his body and his mind.
Steve looks at him with a gentle kind of sadness, like he can read everything that Tony isn’t saying in his eyes. He tugs him close and presses a soft kiss to his brow. “I had a great time, Shellhead. I’d love to do something like it again, if that’s something you want. If that’s something we can do. Always ask me for what you want. Okay?”
He almost doesn’t catch it. He’s about to do another circuit of the room, maybe do some shadow boxing or katas, but something about the cryochamber stops him.
“They’re in space,” Clint says, mouth full of dumplings. Natasha spears him with a scathing look. “What? Phil said so. And they’re so fuckin’ weird, Nat, come on.”
than I could ever even look at. Duty free. You know, Dr. Cho can put away more than I thought. She’s so small. But damn, can the Koreans party.”
Steve doesn’t know how to say what he wants to say. He doesn’t have the space, in his brain or his chest. He doesn’t have the ability to make Tony hear him.
The barest flicker of movement from Loki, and his mouth stops moving. His entire body is frozen to the spot.
Steve shrugs, a wry smile breaking over his face. “No one is responsible for anyone else.” He laughs a little, more tired than he’d like. He doesn’t have to mention Bucky; he’s always the elephantine ghost in the room, the trailing and unspoken sorrow of his past tracing him through the present. Still, “It took me a while to be able to say that.” On most days, he still doesn’t believe it.
“Look at me,” Tony demands, and Steve forces himself back. His fists are clenched hard behind Tony’s head, arms trembling where they’re looped around his neck. He’s looking at Tony almost sightlessly, so wracked with pleasure that he can barely focus his eyes. “Incredible.”
Tony stills, suddenly, and Steve turns in time to catch the lowering of his eyelashes. He near swallows his tongue when Tony opens his mouth under Steve’s hand, tongue slipping out to lick along the line between his middle and ring fingers in a slow, filthy sweep. Steve can feel his stomach tighten, the muscles in his body coiling as he meets Tony’s half-lidded gaze, his eyes dark and sparkling with mischief.
Tony brings his other wrist up and does the other side of Steve’s neck, then up, behind his ears. Steve reaches up and holds his hands there, fingers light as a bird on Tony’s forearms. Just the faintest hint of pressure telling him to stay.
“I have to ask a favour of you all,” Steve told the team, when nearly two weeks had passed. “And I can’t tell you why.”
The common space is empty when Steve finally has the courage to face the rest of the team. He wasn’t sure what he was expecting, exactly. The team weren’t necessarily ones for happy reunions, but usually there was usually a big dinner after a mission. It was nice to have your comrades around after a brush with death. Sometimes soldiers needed to be reminded that they were still alive and breathing, still here together, still solid.
Steve turns to look at him, startled, but he’s already pulling away. He waves a metal hand over his shoulder and goes over to pour himself some coffee. Then Sam touches him to get his attention, and Danni wants to play peek-a-boo, and the moment to ask passes him by.
Tony’s pulse is thundering in his ears. He can’t seem to get his bearings. Bruce takes a sip of his tea, then pushes his glasses up into his hair and pinches his nose. His eyes are pained and somewhat embarrassed when he meets Tony’s wide gaze. “Steve is a lot of things, but emotionally perceptive isn’t one of them, so you’re going to have to be the one to do something. If not, he’ll just keep wallowing until he falls for someone else. When that happens, you’ll be a wreck, and I’ll have to say I told you so. So don’t wait that long. For me.”
“Thor saw her hit me and didn’t notice a damn thing,” Tony says sighing. “Look, there’s no evidence of it affecting my relationships with anyone else on the team, right?”
The tower is always a little eerie at this hour of night, lit only by the radiant light of the city below. Tony pads silently through the dark bluish living room and steps into the golden light spilling out from the kitchen. Clint is humming a little, clad only in a cotton tee and boxers, barefoot. He gestures with a spatula at an aluminium pan filled with an uncut sheet of brownies resting on the island.
Loki hums with pleasure, nibbling at the thigh propped on his shoulder as he works his fingers inside of Tony, eyes crinkled with wicked delight at the way Tony bucks every time he grazes his prostate. Tony hasn’t had this in a while, the painpleasure and the sanguinity of being serviced; he feels languid, and maybe a little decadent. People usually expect him to do the work.
“Truce, truce,” he laughs. Tony jabs him painfully in the stomach with his free hand. “Stark, I swear-”
“I think you will enjoy Spirited Away. It is about a young girl transported to the spirit world, working to save her parents from a witch’s curse.”
They go to Yasuda. Tony hasn't been since the eponymous master chef returned to Tokyo, but apparently Pepper wants to see what Tamura has done with the place. Tony wouldn't want sushi after a week in Japan, but he's never pretended to understand Pepper's tastes. Tony just likes good food.
“I took you for someone who takes what he wants,” Tony says, but he can feel his orgasm building slowly. He knows what Loki’s game is, and right now he’s getting away with it.
“Mouthy omega,” Tony chided, but there was no heat to it. He cleared his throat, sitting back on his heels and Steve’s knees to put a bit of distance between them. When Steve glanced up at him through wet eyelashes, his expression was tired. Wary, even. “I…before you-” He cleared his throat, looking over towards the lamp with unfocussed eyes. “I mean, you should know. I’m, uh. I’m shooting blanks.”
“That’s better,” Steve pants. He leans down and takes Tony’s mouth in a kiss. There’s saltwater everywhere, dripping from the tip of his nose. It gets into Tony’s mouth as they kiss, open-mouthed and sloppy with laughter and heaving breaths. Steve pulls back and nudges their noses together. “There you are.”
As far as he can remember, Tony’s never actually done this with the combined firepower of the new suits. It’s overkill, and it leaves him defenceless if for some reason it doesn’t work. Still, seeing as the Hulk was smashing his way to them as they bickered, he isn’t worried.
“It’s not that I’m not interested in being honest,” Steve says, slowly, pushing his errant thoughts aside. “I wouldn’t have come here if I wasn’t interested. But you’ve gotta understand, I grew up in a different time. Talking about this stuff…”
Tony jerks back a little, like Reed’s hit him. It’s so simple, said like that. There’s always been something admirable about Reed’s absent-minded wisdom. Sometimes, Steve thinks he’s the only one Tony will listen to.
“That’s not the same,” Rhodey protests, but Tony ignores him, clapping his hands and reaching out to pat an excited Dummy wheeling by and waving an arm.
"Oh?" Loki says, suddenly very close. Tony raises his head to meet the mage's eye across the bar. "And do you?"
“I dunno,” she purrs. Tony glances up to see the redhead tapping her chin, an exaggerated look of contemplation crossing her face. “An impossible genius, his blond war-veteran partner, and the long-suffering cop who has to mind them…”
Tony swallows, because he did promise that. He’d promised that like an idiot, before he’d known how important Bruce would become to him.
Tony quirks a half-smile, glancing out over the city. A red tailed hawk glides by, slow and gorgeous in the afternoon sun.
to finish this,” Tony says widening his eyes meaningfully, and Beth stares at him for a long moment. Her eyes narrow as she takes in Tony’s appearance paired with the fervour of his demands.
Steve chuckles, skirting around an ice-cream cart wheeling its way into Central Park. “I meant about…y’know. Tony, and.” He stops, realising how stupid he sounds.
Steve considered the conversation, running it back. He thought about what Tony had said about his run, and the fact that he had put the island between them. He thought about the way Tony’s eyes had moved.
“He’s having a migraine,” a familiar voice says quietly, and Tony glances back behind Bruce to see Rhodey, thank fucking God. “I got the lights, but sound is gonna hurt right now. And someone might wanna get a bucket.”
“No, I wanted him to let somebody else do it. Be Iron Man, I mean. I didn’t want him out there fighting at all.”
Not that he can really throw stones on the drunk front, or even the bad fashion front, but still. Saint Patrick’s Day is a crime against beauty and grace. He feels very strongly about this.
For a long time, they sit in silence, looking out over the city. The last of the sunset is fading now, red bleeding into purple, purple bleeding into grey. Slowly, Tony sips his tea, until the shaking subsides. Slowly, the tension bleeds out of him, streaming away in every direction into the dark night.
The little tin disc hits the basketball and crumples a bit on impact, and the ball rocks, rolling up onto the edge of the branch, before falling back into place.
Steve takes a breath. “I grew up during the draft,” he says. “I certainly thought it was the moral imperative for everybody that could fight to get out there on the front lines and do it. I believe that it’s everyone’s duty to resist evil wherever they see it.”
“Soldiers risk their lives for this country, and they are brave. Teachers who jump in front of shooters to save their students are also undeniably brave. But do you think that is their duty?”
––and the sight of it is enough to startle. It’s not disguised as wariness, or hidden behind a defensive smile. It’s just there, on his face, bare and horrible to see.
I think this is me working up to an elegy. I’ve been a Cap/Iron-Man shipper for a long time. It’s an old ship, sturdy and still going strong, but lately I've been wondering if it’s time for me to step off of it. I’ve always had some serious issues with Cap, which let me tell you, has always required a lot of doublethink. I always wanted to shake Tony and tell him that he was worthy, and Cap could be a real asshole too, and his golden hero was far from perfect. In the comics, I was actually more on Cap's side from a moral standpoint, even if I thought Tony had a lot of good points considering House of M/the political climate. Having watched Captain America: Civil War however, I came out with nothing but incandescent hatred for Movie!Cap. With the changes made for the film, I found his position surprisingly un-American, rather  imperialistic, and ultimately indefensible without extreme and dangerous arrogance. He seemed so OOC to me. Tony makes his mistakes, but he always owns up to them. His unhealthy self-deprecation ensures that. Steve’s moral superiority won’t let him acknowledge any fault at all.
“You wanted to trick Amora into thinking you were dead so you could stop playing buddy buddy with her,” Clint guesses, eyes narrowed. “Stark, did you know about this?”
“I think sir has answered enough questions throughout this ordeal,” JARVIS said, censure in his voice, and Steve winced. “I do not mean to be unsympathetic to their concerns. However, my prime directive is to protect Sir.”
“It means that Peter wins the pot,” Pepper laughs, “because he was convinced that you were both too stubborn to do anything about it on your own, and that it would take outside influence. He suspected mind reading, or a truth spell, or something like that. So come on, Tony, what was it?”
“I’d rather Tony hold the other guy, than SHIELD,” Bruce had countered, shrugging in that small, slightly frightened way of his. He’d been so reticent, then. “I trust him.”
“Eh,” Tony says, rocking a hand back and forth. “I mean, like all teens, I got radicalised in college. So now I’m a True Believer™. Got the shirt and everything.” Steve blushes then, bright and showy. “What?”
Steve’s organs are made of lead, painful and heavy poison within him. “I can be a mean sonuvabitch sometimes and I’m sorry.”
“Tony,” Steve tries, because he knows how Tony can get when he’s like this. It’s absolutely the wrong thing to do, because Tony holds up a hand. It’s a cutting motion, one they use in the field, and it shuts Steve up immediately because it means two things: first, that Tony is in charge of the Avengers right now, and Steve is not; and second, that Tony is incredibly, unbelievably livid.
The shocked, strangled sound that Tony makes breaks him out of his fervour. Steve’s eyes open, his heart thundering in his chest as he comes back to himself, and in the interim he loses his ability to touch. His hands are no longer touching Tony. He’s once again anchorless, unable to reach him, and this time it truly breaks his heart. He can feel the ache of it below his breastbone, and he closes his eyes and lets out a stream of curses that he’s glad no one can hear.
“You didn’t have to do that,” Tony says, but he knows it’s futile. He sits up, swings his legs over the side of the bed. “Fuck. Give me a minute.”
Steve swallows and shoves that thought away, hard. He certainly can’t be thinking about that with Evan driving him home. He doesn’t think a heat with Tony would be what most alphas expect, anyhow. Tony himself was quite alpha, in almost every way. There’d been a lot of nasty articles that Steve had refused to read about how Tony used being stealth to hide that he was just like every other alpha: a wolf amongst sheep. Steve was pretty sure that was intolerant in some way, although he didn’t know precisely how. But Steve
A month ago, Steve and Tony had sat on the couch and eaten handfuls of popcorn while he’d introduced Steve to the wonders of Ghostbusters. Bruce and Thor had popped up halfway through and sat in, heavy shapes settling into the armchairs. Steve had been entranced, as he always is with every film. His blue eyes had been wide and enraptured, and at the big battle scene he’d clamped a hand on Tony’s knee without thinking about it, leaning forward in his seat towards the screen in the dark, the radiant light flickering across his high cheekbones, the long perfect line of his nose. Steve watched movies on movie nights, but Tony watched Steve. His reactions were always more interesting than reliving the classics.
Tony wakes up on the sofa with a crick in his neck, disoriented and flailing for his buzzing phone. He’s covered in a blanket that smells faintly of Steve, but he’s too sleepy to be annoyed at the presumption. Instead he tugs it closer around himself and pulls his phone out from his pocket. The screen is aggressively blue in the warm afternoon light.
The doors close on Steve’s pained, longing expression. It’s enough to make him want to go back, but he knows he can’t.
“Mister Stark, it’s gonna be too right nasty to keep searching for the sheriff in a few hours. Maybe scarcer than that.” Tony turned to glance at the man looking at him, hat in his hands. Cage had strong, powerful limbs, good for the mining work. His partner stood in the back, humming off-key as she stirred a pot on their small stove.
“You can’t fucking know,” Tony grates out, rubbing a hand over his face. “You- you have no idea what it was like, growing up in that house and then seeing you and god, I wanted to
Steve huffs a laugh. “So fix it, then,” he tells him, jogging over to where the disc fell. The edge is dented, and he does his best to smooth it out with his fingers before offering it to Tony.
“Are you alright, Captain?” JARVIS asked, and Steve blinked his eyes a few times, coming back to himself. He’d been working in his studio, like he always did when he needed to get his head on straight and the gym was occupied. Clint and Natasha had been sparring last he’d checked, and so he’d opted to come upstairs and work instead. He was giving Tony a drawing, because he’d learned over the years that it was impossible to shop for a billionaire who just bought whatever he and his friends wanted at the barest hint that they might want it. It was better to give Tony experiences that he wouldn’t think to try, or objects without value. The first year they’d been dating, Steve had given Tony a little booklet of couple coupons he spotted in a store. They were for things like a massage, or a bubble bath, or trying something new in the bedroom. That last had made him blush, but Tony had laughed brightly as he’d flipped through them, grinning when he saw the ones Steve had added: one instance of no nagging when Tony had been injured in battle, the ability to use Steve to lift heavy things in the workshop when he needed a little more finesse than the bots could manage, a few hours with the shield for Tony to scan and poke at as much as he liked.
Steve grits his teeth. “Tony told me the same thing. He doesn’t pull his punches. I know that I messed up, but I don’t see why-”
“Steve?” Bruce probed. A soft voice, a hand on his shoulder. “Come on, Cap, why don’t we take a break, okay? We should eat something. We can make lunch.”
Tony laughs. He can’t help it. Steve’s wry, self-deprecating smile tells him it’s alright, though. “Come on, old man. Let’s go try to interrogate the world’s most famous super-spy.”
Tony slides his hand down and cups Steve’s sac, pulling gently at the soft skin. Then he slides his hand down deeper, fingers pressing into Steve’s stretched out rim. The sound that Steve makes is obscene. It makes all the hair on Tony’s arms stand on end, a shiver of arousal running over his body. He pistons his hectocotylus harder and faster. He’s getting there. He can feel it, different than any other orgasm his body has ever experienced. It feels…he doesn’t know how to describe how it feels.
The corner of Natasha’s mouth twitches. Tony knows this smile: it’s patronising. Pity. Tony can relate. Sometimes, Steve can sound so naïve.
Steve shifts a little as the lights go down and the movie starts, willing his body to come down off of its high. He can feel Tony staring at him, even as the MGM lion roars out from the screen. He squeezes Tony’s hip again, gently this time, and is rewarded with Tony nestling deeper into Steve’s body. Steve wraps an arm around his shoulders, because it seems stupid not to, now.
Tony knows he’s gaping like a fish, but he can’t manage to do anything else. He has no idea what to say.
“I have a few things to finish up before I might choose to return, but your sacrifice is noted,” Loki says, not answering Tony’s question, as usual. He’s smiling pityingly now, and Tony sticks his tongue out at him. Because he’s childish, around Loki. He can admit it. “I should be back by the end of the day, and thus I expect that my place in your bed shall be empty.” He grins, all teeth. “Make a note.”
He lets himself take comfort in Pepper’s embrace for the space of another score of heartbeats, letting the familiar scent of her perfume wash over him, the feeling of her long ponytail as it slides through his absentminded, fiddling fingers. Eventually, he pulls away, brushing a stray single hair off of her blazer.
“I thought I was created for plausible deniability,” JARVIS says. Tony starts, then laughs at himself.
“I think you know a lot,” Steve says, knowing they’re stepping into dangerous territory now. Or rather, maybe they have been, all along. “You stay with us because you love him. Us, too, I like to think. But mostly him.”
“Don’t think we’re not talking about this later,” she warns him, and Tony nods again. “I take it that Cap’s not coming back?”
“Not at all, sir,” JARVIS says, gently enough that Tony feels warm inside. “Where would you like to go?”
“Faster,” Steve tells him, then closes his eyes and groans in bliss when Tony does just that. “God, perfect. Come on. Come, Tony, I want-”
Steve clears his throat a little, settling back in his chair, and Tony glances at him. The faintest flush sits high on his cheekbones, and Tony zeroes in on that, equal parts curious and terrified. He knows he’s been called last to the table for a reason, but he hasn’t quite sussed it out yet. Did they plan this specifically to coincide with Loki’s absence?
“I’ve been told I come on too strong,” he says. He grins a little, lopsided. Hurt. “Side effect of being unused to anyone looking twice at me, I’d wager.”
“Fight the man,” he says, jogging out towards the elevator. He refuses eye contact with Steve hovering by the control panel, expression fragile. “Thanks for the warning, J, really,” he says under his breath, then louder, “Sorry, gotta run, no time to chat.”
“I am your last defence against Loki, if you are compromised,” she tells him. She turns her head to meet the cool blue gaze of the armour’s mask. “Loki acknowledges that I am dangerous. Admittedly, I was very surprised. I thought things were going quite well.”
“I love you, and you’re an idiot,” Steve says, and Tony laughs wetly, his mouth pressed to Steve’s temple, gasping and warm. “You’re an idiot, and I’m an idiot, and I’m sick of wasting time we don’t have. This is our third chance, Tony. I don’t think we get another one. This is our chance to make things right, the way they always should have been. To be together. Like it was meant to be.”
Tony licks his lips, eyes tracing the v of Steve’s hips. He slides down the bed a bit, then leans in, pressing open-mouthed kisses to the soft skin on the inside of Steve’s thighs. Steve shivers under him, moaning softly, and Tony smiles against his skin. He worries the tendon there with his teeth.
“I could snap off a piece, if you need to ice your wounds,” he offers, and Tony rolls his eyes and pushes himself to his feet.
“We’re keeping the building clear of police while the superpowered fighting is still going on,” Hill says. “They don’t have facilities capable of holding these guys, but they’re damn well going to try.”
Steve lets out an inhuman sound and leans down, swiping his tongue over Tony’s throat where the last bit of his release had landed. He can’t taste anything, but the sound Tony makes is gorgeous, wrung-out and wrecked. It makes Steve set his teeth to the tendon there, his whole body shaking. He tucks a hand under Tony’s lower back, puts the tips of his fingers to the dimples there. He pulls him up into his body, makes himself at home in the cradle of Tony’s hips, and surges up to kiss him on the mouth.
“Tony is all of those things,” Steve says, helpless in the face of Pepper’s completely insane amorality. “Few men are more powerful. He’s already the richest man in the world.”
Tony lets out a helpless laugh. “Coding bias—the AI I programmed is just as bad at reading social cues as I am.”
Steve pulled away to stare down at him, face struck strange upside down and still so beautiful, and thought,
“I’m sorry,” Steve says, again. His voice sounds like he’s been chewing on broken glass. He ducks back into the tower without another word.
“You’ve found Tony a new game,” Pepper says, amused. “You should see him torturing Steve with pop culture.” She looks at Tony, expression souring. “Do I want to know what you’re planning to do?”
“Well, okay,” he says. “How about the Brooklyn Bridge? A huge amount of Irish workers died during construction from the bends, and they haven’t really been honoured properly.”
Tony hadn’t meant anything by it. They’d been together for the better part of two years now, and he hadn’t pushed it once. It was Steve’s choice, he always said. Tony didn’t care, but even if he did, he couldn’t control Steve if he wanted to keep his private life private. Tony loved him, and everyone who mattered already knew. Steve knew all the lines, could play them back six, ten, twelve times over. They’d had the conversation more times than he could count. But now, Steve wondered. He wanted. He imagined.
Tony’s always loved flying. There was nothing quite like the adrenalin of that first drop, and the second, and the third, the wind roaring by as he speeds towards the ground at terminal velocity. He loves the weightlessness of his limbs in the cushioning air. He loves the way the world stretches out like a map beneath him, the shuttling carapaces of the cars and the roads disappearing into webwork, an intricate moving model of life stretching as far as the eye can see. That was one of the funny things about the East Coast; they’d run out of space so much that the spaces between settlements had been eaten up, one town indistinguishable from the next as you crossed the landscape.
Tony releases his ass and slaps him, open handed and loud. It’s more startling than painful, but Steve moans like a slut for it anyway. He squirms deliciously against Tony’s hold.
“Take care of yourself out there,” Steve says, and that’s it; that’s the thing that will bring Tony to his knees. He closes his eyes, makes a fist so tight his nails dig into his palm. “Make sure you eat enough.”
Reed, clearly torn between his duties as a parent, his ethics and morals, and his scientific curiosity, says nothing to that. He wisely keeps his head down and studies the readouts from Tony’s single REM cycle, one hand braced against Franklin’s shoulder. Franklin has taken it upon himself to cling to Steve’s shin.
Pepper smiles at him in surprise and takes his hand as she steps off the plane and onto the metal staircase. Her hair whips around in the wind, long strands curling around her neck, and Tony beams back at her. She's sporting a few new freckles, and he can see the hint of a sunburn under the sheer sleeves of her white blouse. She pauses on the lower steps as he walks her down.
“Your friend Sam Wilson said that you hold yourself to a higher standard than the rest of the world. Do you disagree?”
“I know,” he says, smiling gently. There’s a wistfulness to it, like he knows something Steve doesn’t. Eventually, they both turn back to the display.
“Caught somewhere half-between, huh?” Banner said, wry, and Steve spared him a chagrined expression. “I’m fine with it being Tony, but I think you all knew that.”
“They were defence contractors,” the professor corrects, albeit gently. “Stark in particular is on record as having been able to field strip an M1911 in under seven seconds by the time he was three years old. According to one
He wanted to be good for Tony. He wanted Tony to come in, and see his omega waiting patiently for him, and know that he was loved more than anything else in the world. He wanted Tony’s eyes to flash dark and possessive, wanted the proprietary way he smoothed his hands over Steve’s flanks, his thighs, his back. He wanted the way Tony sounded when he was hungry for him, voice low and rumbling and rough. He wanted Tony to press inside him and make him feel so good it hurt, until he cried. He wanted so badly.
Tony takes a series of comprehensive x-rays and promises to review the data and send it over securely as soon as he can. When he climbs up out of Grand Central, the air is muggy and dead. It’s properly summer in New York now, and getting into the cool metal of the suit is extremely satisfying on his sticky skin. He rolls his shoulders inside the metal, arching into it a little.
Cap is up as soon as the last piece comes undone, slamming into Tony hard enough to knock the air out of him. He’s got a hand on the side of Tony’s head, and Tony grabs his wrist, heart pounding in his chest.
“You can come if you want,” Tony says, trying to salvage the situation, but Steve’s collapsing in on himself. It’s what he always does when he’s truly upset, making himself small like he’s regretting his size and wants to crawl into his own skin. “Or, I’ll see you tonight?”
“I triggered your latent childhood trauma,” Tony says, mouth curling into a self-deprecating smile. “Always knew someone who got beat up so much had to come out with a little more than a mean temper and a stubborn streak deeper than the Mariana.”
Natasha smiles, that small tilt of the right corner of her mouth. It’s his smile, he knows. He doesn’t quite have it in him to smile back.
“That he tried to give himself some version of Extremis,” she says, and Steve sucks in a breath. The facts fall down like dominoes, neat black and white dots and lines. Data points: Tony and Reed pouring near-silently over monitors together, trading things back and forth and speaking even more opaquely than usual for them. Tony’s almost desperate behaviour last night. The reason only Tony can see or hear or touch him. “It’s over, Ghost.”
He was saved from Rogers’ retort by distance, whatever he might have said to that forcibly censored by the bright noon light and the bustling street. Tony hummed an old song under his breath, turning to step back around the building and cut through to the Parkers’ homestead. It was a good day, when he could say he’d managed to fluster the sheriff and get the last word in. Even better, he’d only had a bit of drink, without wanting to absolutely come apart at the seams for want of it.
“Call mercy, Cap,” Tony says, grinning down at him, and Steve is breathless. Tony is never more handsome than when he’s happy and laughing with it, when he’s pleased with himself or something he’s done. His eyelashes are a dark sweep over his cheeks, looking a half-mile long through Steve’s rose tinted glasses, and he can’t stop himself from leaning in, tilting his face up. Through the last flutter of his eyelids, he catches a glimpse of surprise on Tony’s face, and then they’re kissing: slow, sweet, still a little breathless. Tony makes a soft noise, and then his mouth opens over Steve’s, and Steve’s gone. He presses the advantage, slipping his tongue into Tony’s mouth, sliding an arm around Tony’s waist to steady him in place. Tony settles in his lap, sliding forward until they’re pressed together from stomach to chest, and Steve moans and tangles his fingers in Tony’s hair.
and loving Steve. Tony drunk in a fucking gutter while Steve walked away because he couldn’t bear the thought of his own weaknesses, and still, still, loving Steve. Tony descending a staircase like a prince in a fairytale, smiling at him days before Christmas and calling him Beloved. Tony mostly naked except for the swath of red cloth that hangs from his hips, revealing himself as Iron-Man, an image that has haunted Steve for years-
“He is a man,” she says, as though this explains everything. “He made mistakes. You’ve made many mistakes in your life, Tony Stark.”
Tony laughs as he takes out another group of Hydra agents attempting to flee the scene. "Oh, that bastard." And then, "You opened my mail? That's a federal crime."
“You are so cheesy,” Tony complained, but he was laughing. He took a scoop of gelato for himself. “How are you feeling?”
“If he had, I wouldn’t tell you, Captain.” JARVIS’ voice is disapproving, and Steve shakes his head.
“Guess the secret’s out, then,” Tony joked. His voice was dry, broken, and still the sound of it pierced Steve sure as any of Clint’s arrows. It hurt, more than he thought it would, a wild ache swimming in his sternum. He covered his nose and mouth with his arm, taking deep breaths of Tony’s scent from the hoodie. “Sorry.”
“Tony,” Bruce says, expression unbearably kind, and Tony lets out a rough breath. “What’s going on?”
“JARVIS,” he said, and his voice sounded as though it was coming from very far away, “where’s Tony?”
Rogers was listing in and out, now. He’d slurred a bit while he was talking, clearly on the edge of exhaustion, and Tony poked around in the cupboards for some crackers, a wedge of hard cheese. He put them on the chair next to the bed alongside a good knife and a board, then set about tidying up. He stuffed the doors downstairs with newspaper, blowing out the lamps and locking up. When he glanced out the windows on the ground floor, he couldn’t even see his own workshop across the road.
“Hope is for those who lack conviction,” Ms. Bliss sniffs. She turns, opening her body up to invite Steve through the door. “Action is for men of honour. If Miss Potts thinks you are unworthy, do better.”
“Wasn’t once enough?” Tony sobs, and Carol just rocks him back and forth, silent tears leaking from her eyes. “I barely survived the first time-”
“No, he makes unilateral decisions when he is sure he’s right and thinks someone else will get in the way of him doing what is right. You can’t tell me you don’t do the same exact thing, Captain. Or was it someone else who blew up SHIELD?”
“I love you,” Steve told him as he pulled off Tony’s tatty pyjama bottoms. He pressed adoring kisses down the tops of Tony’s thighs, the inside of his knees, the corded tendons of his feet.
“Bethie! So high!” Tony laughs, picking up the glass cutter again. “You must have been pretty sure of yourself when you bet.”
“Sir and Dr. Banner had a strong disagreement yesterday afternoon. Sir became very upset and experienced the preliminary symptoms of a panic attack. He proceeded to take the nearest shortcut out of the living room, which naturally meant jumping off of the balcony and calling a suit to him mid-air. Dr. Banner reacted as you might expect to this.”
“No,” Tony gasps, waving a hand. “No, Fri, don’t.” He hitches another sob. “Don’t…I just. I need to sleep.”
“Well, that’s the tricky part. I didn’t want to kill them, so I just let them pass out, then kept it low-oxygen. Nothing low enough to cause brain damage, just to incapacitate them, so as soon as I start opening things up, they’re gonna begin to revive. It’s probably best to go section by section. I can direct the team.” There was another crackle. “
“Well,” Tony said, and there was something strange in his voice now, something longing and desperate and sad. “We could go into your heat without a BiteBlocker, and see what happens.”
There’s a small, companionable silence in the confession booth. Steve wipes at his eyes and takes a shuddering breath. He lets the atmosphere of the church wash over him: the unique, echoing silence, and the faintest scent of the thurible’s swaying left from morning mass, and the smooth texture of the wood against his arm where he’s pressed against the booth.
“You could ask Captain Rogers why he has chosen to remove himself from the situation, instead of speculating.”
Tony blinks, turning to Steve. “Right,” he says, brow furrowing when Steve won’t look at him. “You’re okay with that?”
“Not every enhanced is a WMD,” Tony pipes in tiredly. They’ve been going in circles for an hour, and he’s sick of it. He’s so fucking sick of it. “And I’ve got no powers, remember? I was the first super out of the gate, unless you’re counting Captain America, and there is absolutely nothing enhanced about my DNA. And before you can ask, I’ve had the tests.” He slides a StarkPad down the table with his results for good measure. “And speaking of the Olympics, Michael Phelps has increased lung capacity and huge flipper feet, and he’s not an enhanced. Do we take away his medals because he’s got better chest and foot measurements than everybody else? Come on, ladies and gentlemen, we all know registration is off the table for now. So what are we really looking at, here?”
Tony takes pity on him. He tips Steve’s chin up with one finger until they’re face to face. He brushes their noses together, then kisses him.
When he came to, Tony’s knot was pressed up against everything that made him want to squirm and cry, overstimulated and so fucking good, and he collapsed limply back to the bed and let out a quiet moan of pleasure. Tony’s face was still buried in his neck, tongue lapping at the abused bondmark, and Steve just let him, rocking his hips in concert with Tony grinding slow and dirty against him.
I ended up catching it/in the hospital and had a lot of time to myself, so I'm trying to catch up on all the fannish stuff I let slide. I owe someone Potterlock chapters from the FTH auction, which I am working on! I know it's late. I also need to find a way to get into my gmail for the rest of my Yuuri!!! On Ice story, which was saved in drive. This story is only getting posted because I keep it on my hard drive smh.
“You-” Tony tried, then stopped. He reached a hand out, shaking, two fingers reaching towards Steve’s throat-
Tony swallows his smile. His fingers pause mid-gesture. “Perish the thought,” he says, but his heart isn’t in it. Steve suspects he knows where Tony’s head is going, and he doesn’t know what to do about it. He reaches a hand out, then lets it fall ineffectual into his lap. “Coordinates sent, no context, as requested.”
So here they are, wandering out of the IFC, Tony pressed into the curve of Steve’s body and talking animatedly with his hands. Steve doesn’t want the night to end yet. He feels five years lighter, like Civil War never happened and he and Tony have only ever been best friends. Like he’s just found out that his two best friends are really the same, single, amazing man. Like for the first time, he can reach out and touch Iron Man and find flesh: Tony, warm and living under his heavy, calloused hands.
Usual warnings: canon-typical violence, arguing, general sad times all around lol. Shit's getting real now.
When Steve pulls back, his mouth is red and gleaming wet. He looks utterly debauched, and Tony can feel his hips rock forward without his meaning to at the sight.
Steve flinched, taking the chastisement for what it was. “Sorry,” he whispered, and Natasha was there again, hand at his elbow.
“Cap,” Natasha said, inclining her head, and Steve grinned at the scene in front of him. Thor was sitting on the back of the couch, dead last, brow furrowed as he bent over the controller. Clint was sitting cross-legged on the ground between Natasha’s feet, both she and Tony perched on the couch. The table was littered with the remnants of pizza and beer.
“If he wanted me why would he leave?” Tony sneers. He grabs his shirt from the island and pulls it back on. He feels uncomfortably naked.
