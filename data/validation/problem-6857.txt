. We're meeting with Blackwell on Thursday to discuss specifics and go over the proposal to fine tune it for their needs."
"You gonna start talkin'? Or are we gonna start gettin' mean?" Bucky lets a little bit of his Brooklyn upbringing bleed through in his speech, and Natasha imagines it's a calculated move. To make himself seem tough and stupid, some thoughtless thug she can let her guard down with. Natasha almost wants to see what happens if the woman underestimates him.
is that self sabotaging. He would have been happy just quietly pining away as Tony's friend until the next ice age rolled into town. "
Steve takes his team the long way around, stopping the car several blocks away from the area Tony's headed. He does a quick comms check with everyone, readjusts his holster, then takes Bucky across the street. Sam and Natasha stay on the other side, and the four of them begin walking in the general direction of the street the meeting warehouse is on.
Clint opens his mouth to say something excited, but Bucky steps on his foot and glares. Right. Don't say anything. He holds his breath instead.
Howard, a father. Steve shakes his head. He can’t picture it. He can’t picture Howard settling down into domesticity, marrying and raising a child. But, then again, people change. Things change. Evidently.
They make it as far as Syracuse before the storm gets really bad. The temperature drops rapidly, and all the snow that had hit the road and melted has re-frozen. Steve sends a text to Natasha letting her know that they might be a little later than expected as Tony slows down on the interstate, but they press on. Tony's anxiety is palpable, not only because of the weather, but because he just wants to get home to Casey. Or at least, that's what Steve is assuming. They talk a lot less than they did on the way up, Tony focused on the road as he is.
The Dora Milaje swarm Thanos from behind, grabbing his arms and trying to pin them back so they can pry the gauntlet from his fist. For a moment, Tony thinks that they might actually have him, but he breaks their hold with a grunt a beat later.
The second time that Steve had woken up in the hospital after the helicarriers went down, Sam had stepped out and Tony was sitting in his place, holding vigil at Steve’s bedside with an enormous vase of flowers.
All the way up until the moment that Tony picks him up that morning, Steve is kicking himself for ever agreeing to this stupid trip. It's a five hour drive up to Rochester, which means ten hours that he's going to be trapped in a car with Tony. Ten hours where he's going to have to fight not to fall more in love, because he'll admit it to himself, even if he's not ready to admit it to anyone else that yeah, he's fallen in love with Tony since the summer.
Casey's little arms wind around his neck to return the embrace, and he plants a sloppy kiss on Tony's cheek before he turns around and runs back to his friends, one arm waving in the air as he calls back, "Bye, Daddy!"
"Well, I don't think it's the thermostat, but I have to pull it out to check the control panel. And it could be something like the rear burner assembly – you might think it would have nothing to do with the oven itself, but sometimes with these older models where they just started putting in some of the more complex electrical connections, if one thing goes out the whole system shuts down."
anything,” Tony growls, stepping closer into Steve’s space. Before Steve realises what’s happening, Tony’s hands are clinging to his shirt and shoving him back hard until his back hits the wall. Then Tony is pressing up against him, pinning him in place as he kisses Steve hard enough to take his breath away. Steve gasps in shock and Tony takes advantage of the surprise to press deeper, sliding his tongue between Steve’s lips. Steve’s brain catches up a moment later, his hands drop to hold onto Tony’s hips, and suddenly Steve is kissing him back with all the desperation and desire he’s been trying to ignore since they’d met. Tony breaks the kiss and pulls back after a moment, and Steve whines softly at the loss of contact, fighting the urge to chase after Tony’s mouth again.
"Tony! Hey!" Steve greets him, wiping off his hands and leaning across the counter. "Usual for you?"
Ultron had told him, once, that he couldn't live without a war. He's starting to think, now, that Ultron was right – not because Steve needed the war, but because the war needs him.
Steve chuckles, and shakes his head. “No, of course you didn’t. You just built a tower with space designed specifically for each one of us, and space to expand in case the team grew. And a dedicated training facility. And everything we could need. You built us a home, but no, of course not. You never suggested we all come and live there.”
Tony glanced around at their group. They were going to need all the help they could get, if Thanos was on his way.
"Get something to eat, maybe a shower and a real nap," Rhodey says to him as Steve leaves the room. "We'll keep an eye on him. If anything happens, I'll call you."
Bruce Banner had stumbled out after him, looking haunted, jittery with nerves, like a stiff wind would blow him over or make him hulk out. Possibly both at the same time.
Tony pinches the bridge of his nose, and tries not to snap. "So, you mean to say, that he could literally be anywhere in the world?"
When he wakes, it's darker in the room. He's only disoriented for a moment, then he glances at the time on his phone screen. It's evening, he's been asleep for a few hours. He doesn't have any messages, though, so Tony must still be unconscious.
Neither of them says anything after that, though Tony doesn't let go of his hand. Not long after, Tony's breath evens out as he slips into sleep. Steve follows soon after.
"What?" He asks. "She's close with Clint. And she brings Casey in sometimes after school. She's really good with him, which is good, he's such a great kid."
Wait, what? His perception slips sideways and his brain struggles to catch up. Obviously people had talked about him, history books had been written about him. Rationally, he knew that. But it never once occurred to him that Howard might talk about him to his
, he needs to think about baseball again or he's going to have a raging hard-on, and he can't get out of bed without Tony's help, and then Tony would also be
"It's been insane since the Manhattan store opened," Clint concedes, and Steve thinks they'll probably let the issue of his crush – which doesn't exist – go for the time being. "Even the Brooklyn store has been busier since we opened. Guess word is getting around? I mean, I figured it would be tough work, but jeez. It's crazier than I thought."
bigger than him, and if Steve wants to beat the shit out of him on the sidewalk for what Tony thinks is a
"Maybe. We gotta fire it up, double check, but I think it might have been a short in the connection. You bypass the connection, the short doesn't affect anything."
"I hope the restaurant doesn't want that plate back," Steve sighs. "That's going to complicate things, we can't punch it, or trap it."
Across the table something close to relief flickers across Tony’s face, as thought he’d been prepared for something worse. Steve frowns, but doesn’t question it.
When they had agreed to be moved to the pocket reality, Strange had taken them to Wakanda to do the spell. He'd said they would be best protected under T'Challa's watchful eye, with his underground facilities, adamantium bunkers, and high-tech medical facilities.
“Yeah.” It’s a thing they do when they can’t sleep. Steve makes hot chocolate, and they sit outside together, watching the lights and the life of the city. It’s peaceful, calming, a moment that belongs just to the two of them.  Steve is remembering more and more every day. So it really shouldn’t surprise Tony when Steve says,
He pulls on some clothes – it looks like these quarters had been set up for him with some of his own clothing, so he puts on a soft, long-sleeved henley and a pair of jogging pants, leaving his feet bare for the time being. He pushes his hair back off his forehead, heading for the door.
They give each other awkward smiles and waves, and then Tony high tails it out of there. If he's lucky, he can catch up to Rhodey and push him in front of a bus or something.
"No, see, that wasn't 'nice to you', Tony, that was 'doesn't want to be here'. If he was being nice to you because he felt obligated, he'd have stuck around to be nice to you. So what'd you do?"
They'll put Clint up high, somewhere he can't be seen. He's got good eyes, he can see from a long way. Clint will keep an eye on Tony, with Rhodey there to provide back-up. Sam and Natasha will scour the area for anyone hiding or planning an ambush.
Since going through Steve to figure out what the issue is was a dead end, Bucky moves down to the next person on his list. Natasha comes into the shop one evening while Bucky and Clint are working late, having sent Steve off early to meet with his physiotherapist.
“You don’t know that,” Steve snaps suddenly. Tony startles, and draws back for half a moment. But he’s never backed down from Steve before and he isn’t going to start now.
Steve flashes him a ghost of a smile. "Everything, I guess. But, if I'm being specific, I mostly mean you and Clint."
"I'm pretty sure we went over a few necessities of self-care when we were in the Haven," Sam tells him. "And there was more to the list than food and sleep."
He doesn't stay where he is, continuing down the hallway, ears straining for any indication as to where in the building Casey might be.
His hand starts shaking a little, but Tony is right there, still holding on, absently swiping his thumb across the back of Steve's palm. He's always struggled to talk about that day, but there is something about laying in the dark and the quiet, and the point in the night where everything feels a little surreal, that makes it easier. Like the words disappear into the darkness, harmless. "One minute we were driving, and the next, my ears are ringing and the vehicle is laying upside down on the road. I was trying to get my seat belt undone, and I could hear civilians screaming outside, and my own troops shouting. Must have gotten myself undone, because I hit the ground and crawled out. Nicki was already outside, she was bleeding, but mostly okay. She grabbed Clint, and I – I went for Bucky. He –" Steve squeezes his eyes shut and takes a moment to compose himself. It's alright. Bucky was okay. Bucky
Fred looks at him apologetically, and shrugs. "Storm's bad. Highways are closed, your car's in a ditch. You're not going to get a tow truck tonight, let alone a ride anywhere." Tony continues to stare helplessly at Fred, who reaches over and pats Tony's shoulder gently. "You boys are safe, and sheltered. You ain't a high priority for emergency services. By morning, it should be snowed out and the roads cleared."
"Felt pretty real to me," Rhodey tells him. "The months of pining after each other. Steve being mopey because he thought you and I were together."
Those three words are a punch to the gut that knocks the wind right out of him. It's like losing Casey all over again. He has visceral memories of realising that Casey had been taken, of feeling like his whole world had come crashing down around him. Vision isn't Casey, he knows that. But it feels the same anyway.
"Tony," Natasha says, kneeling in front of Tony and taking both his hands in hers. She looks up into his face, eyes steely. "We love him, too. All of us. We wouldn't put him in jeopardy. But they didn't even tell you what they wanted for a ransom. That means that whatever this is? It is first and foremost a trap. You go in alone, and suddenly they've got you, too."
He ducks into a doorway, head down, takes two deep breaths, then whirls around the corner and fires, three shots from his own gun, and there's one that hits the wall behind the guy, from the sound of it. Two of them don't make any sound at all, though, meaning they've hit flesh. A howl of pain, then the guy is dropping to his knees in the hallway, and Steve just steps over him, kicking the gun out of his hand because fuck that guy, fuck
Rhodey snorts and rolls his eyes. "Of course you do. And I'm sure I'll have your full attention for the entirety of the meeting, and you won't be ogling the barista the whole time."
Steve had been pretty easy going about the whole thing. He'd taken the key from Fred, and told Tony it was fine, all he wanted was a hot shower and bed. Only now, as Tony watches Steve sitting on a chair, wincing as he tries to pull his soaking wet jeans off, he realises that a hot shower isn't going to be a straightforward thing, what with Steve's inability to stand. There is, however, Tony discovers, a tub. A very large tub. Big enough for two people. With jets. Lots, and lots of jets. It's the kind of tub they could have a
All Steve wants is to go home and hide, but Rhodey won’t let them leave until they’ve at least filed an initial statement, reports to follow. By the time they’re done, Steve feels worn down and wrung right out, and he’s pretty sure he’s going to lose it on the next person who tries to talk to him about something that isn’t leaving. Which is of course, when Tony decides to march back into his line of sight.
feel. That's important to me. The way I feel about you, Steve, I haven't –" Tony is cut off, then, as Steve sets his own mug of tea down and lurches forward, grabs hold of Tony's biceps with his big, warm hands and presses his mouth to Tony's.
Tony winces a little, his throat tight. "Lotta people in Central Park," he says. Too many people for Casey to be around, if Tony is honest, but he's trying not to sound like a crazy person about it.
"She ever gonna wake up?" Bucky asks, hands hanging carelessly between his spread knees as he sits on an old wooden stool in the small room they've taken the woman into. He looks completely relaxed, without a care in the world. He could be a sitting on a park bench, feeding the pigeons, for as much tension as there is in his body.
“You mean where everyone checks every single word they say around you because they’re afraid you’re going to snap? Or shatter? Or both?”
"Are you okay?" A little crease appears along Casey's forehead as he squints at Steve, studying him hard.
at having a coffee shop right next door, and they tell him how convenient it is, and they're going to tell all their friends how great this place is.
Tony, meanwhile, had watched Stark Industries crash and burn, and did his best to drink away the guilt of letting his family's legacy become a stain on the history books.
"Steven Grant Rogers, what the hell happened?" Steve looks across the shop to find a livid Bucky storming over to him. The few people in the shop raise their heads to inspect the commotion, but Steve hardly notices. It is, after all, not even close to the most embarrassing thing that's happened to him today.
"There are six," Strange told him. "The Space stone, the Mind stone, the Time stone and the Soul stone are all that are left."
He'd known it then, when Tony had flown that nuclear missile through a wormhole to the edge of space. Tony hadn't expected to come back, but he'd gone anyway. And Steve had watched him make sacrifice after sacrifice over the years, and he'd never managed to tell Tony that he
By mid-afternoon, Steve is exhausted. Luckily, he and Bucky had taken the busier first shift of the day, so they're done around two – Clint will close up later in the afternoon.
"The only part of that I understood was that the oven seems to run on some kind of electricity," Steve says dryly. The words repeat in his mind on a loop.
. I swear, watching them, it's like a contest, who can make the other blush more. It's almost nauseating. And they will not stop looking at each other. And then! You know what Tony said today?"
"We're just in the middle of a business meeting, here, so you'll have to excuse us," Rhodey pipes up, eyes flicking between the woman and Tony.
"This wasn't art, it was chaos," Tony tells him, and then adds, "really fun chaos. And, as chaotic as it is, Bucky is enjoying himself."
The third guy gets a good kick into the side of Steve's knee, and it's still a little tender from the accident with Tony – a lifetime ago but really only days – and Steve's vision goes white. He's down, landing on his good knee and then listing over to the side, but he knows he can't stop, knows there isn't a chance that he can lay down for even a second and still save Casey, so he aims his gun in the general direction of the bastard who'd taken his knee out, and he shoots twice. The guy goes down instantly, and he doesn't move.
"There, now we've settled that, I think it's time for that shower, don't you?" Steve says. "Not sure what's the hold up."
"I'm not. The reason you and I are having this conversation? Because I'm sick of seeing you two make yourselves miserable pining after each other. So what is it? What's keeping you from seeing how much he cares about you? Feeling like you don't deserve him?"
God, and what if they have to buy a new one? They definitely can't afford a new commercial oven, and clearly buying used didn't work out so well the last time.
!" Hammer yelps. "He's not from the real world, he's just part of the illusion! I don't even know why he's
"I do! I do!" Casey dives back into his bag and pulls out a pencil. He turns the notebook to a new page. Steve isn't quite sure how to explain drawing, but they start by talking about shapes, and then practice making them. Steve explains how everything you draw is made up of shapes, and then details added to make it look more realistic. He explains that sometimes it's nice to draw stuff that you can see, and sometimes it's okay to look at another picture. And sometimes you can just use your imagination and make whatever you want. Soon, the blank pages of the notebook are filled with doodles, and Steve draws a few silly cartoons that make Casey laugh.
“J, call Steve, will you?” The phone rings twice, and half a second later, connects, and and he sees Steve’s face looking at him. “I love you,” Tony says without preamble, his mouth full of a bit of food.
"I've missed you Tony," Steve breathes against his lips, tilting his head up so Tony could kiss him better. It’s perfect, and Tony would be quite content to keep it up a while longer. But Steve's stomach has other ideas, and makes its displeasure at being neglected known. Loudly. Steve breaks the kiss, smiling sheepishly. "Food first?"
Steve does his best to ignore the look, but he can only last so long in the face of Sam's 'Talk To Me' glare.
He’s midway through a sketch of Gabe and Bucky, trying desperately to get the light in Bucky’s eyes just right as he laughs at something Gabe says, but he can’t get it
"Mighty big of you," Steve laughs. How the hell is it possible to laugh when he's limping through eight inches of drifting snow and shivering so hard his teeth are almost chattering. How is it even possible that in the middle of this freezing shit show, Tony still makes him laugh? It has to be a superpower, clearly, and has nothing to do with the way that Tony makes him feel every time he's around.
Tony leans down to take Steve into his mouth once more, the bitter salty taste exploding over his tongue. He licks at the head, sucks at the slit, softens his lips and pushes down to fit as much into his mouth as he can.
That's one of many things Natasha appreciates about him. She knows that underneath that calm, a storm rages in Bucky as it does in her. It's buried deep, but it's there. A talent neither of them had asked for.
!" And Rhodey's tone is creeping into "crowing" territory, which means Tony has got to nip this line of thought in the bud before Rhodey really gets going.
They eat dinner, and then it's time for Casey's bath. They play in the tub for a while, with Casey making use of the brightly coloured bath crayons. Casey uses shampoo to turn his glossy hair into a ridiculous mohawk, giggling and squealing happily, and Tony really,
"Yeah... talking about feelings is not Stevie's strong suit. Definitely not the romantic kind of feelings. I don't think he's even been on a date since we got back," Bucky muses.
"Hey," he says gently, resting his cheek on the top of Steve's head, "it's alright, Stevie. We're gonna get through this." Steve sags against him, and a little of the tension fades from his shoulders. It's a small victory, but Bucky will take it.
A plan is already forming in Bucky's mind. It's more of a 'last ditch effort' than an actual plan, but fuck it. Subtlety isn't working on these idiots – it might be time for a more direct approach.
"Decided to hang around Manhattan for a while?" Tony asks by way of a greeting, leaning casually against the counter. Clint wanders off to the other end of the counter to put away some dirty dishes, leaving Steve to deal with Stark. That had been the agreement – Clint and Bucky had both said that since he'd gotten 'the crazy Stark guy' calmed down the first time, Steve could also be the one to deal with him going forward. What great friends Steve has.
He shoves away the guilt. Yeah, Steve is his friend, and he feels a little weird about just having jerked off to thoughts of fucking his friend who is just on the other side of the door, but it's better than the alternative. He was quiet enough, Steve won't have heard him.
He turns to look back at Casey's school, and he doesn't have to fake the wide grin that graces his face when Casey bursts out the school doors, running toward him and happily shouting about all the cool things they'd done today in class.
Steve pulls back just a little, eyes searching Tony's at close range. They're so blue Tony could drown in them.
Eventually, when he can't stand waiting anymore, he packs up the shop and goes to make himself ready, swapping out the dirty shop jeans for a clean pair, with a clean shirt. He drives himself out to the airport, taking time to stop to pick up a bouquet of flowers and a box of the pistachio chocolates that Steve can't seem to get enough of. It's cheesy and romantic, and Tony gives exactly zero fucks about that. Even with the stops, he still arrives at the private area of the airfield early. It's agony, having to wait, and he stares up into the sky, watching for the approaching Stark Jet for so long that he nearly ends up getting a crick in his neck. But it's worth it to see the plane make its final approach, and landing, taxiing towards the terminal and spiriting his love to him.
Slowly, the club starts filling with people and the volume in the room begins to rise. Periodically,  the same woman would come by and offer him a drink, which he accepted. Sitting alone in a strip club not drinking would have drawn far too much attention to himself, and it isn’t like he needs to worry about getting himself drunk on a recon mission.
Rhodey comes upstairs long enough to make Steve and Tony each a cup of tea, but then he leans against the kitchen counter. "You gonna be okay, Tones?"
thorough background check, but something about her has Bucky right on edge. And Steve has learned to trust Bucky's instincts. He wonders briefly if he should pull Tony aside and talk to him about her.
Tony squirms uncomfortably. "Don't we have work to do?" he says, trying to get them back on track. It works, and Shuri leads him to a workstation.
"Oh, don't misunderstand," Strange said. "I don't intend him any harm. On the contrary, I think we need to protect him,
“Exactly my point! Brussels is very definitely not here. Where I am. And where he should be,” he complains.
," Bucky snaps, hand gripping Steve's shoulder roughly, fingers digging in. It's grounding enough to bring Steve's awareness back to the inside of the elevator. "I can see the wheels turnin' in there, man, and it's
Suddenly, there are shots fired from somewhere above. The rat-tat-tat of a semi-automatic breaks the quiet of the night, and the brick siding of the building to Steve's left explodes in little pops.
"So this is me, not saying thank you," Tony continues, interrupting him. "I want you to know that. This isn't some, I don't know, misplaced sense of gratitude. This is something I should have said to you a week ago, when we were stuck in that stupid motel near Syracuse."
They stop for take out on the way home and bring it back to the tower where they can sit around in their pyjamas eating a late dinner. Steve looks more than a little tired around the edges, and his being awake in the middle of the night watching team training was all the proof that Tony needed to know that he hadn't been sleeping well while away. They sit, they eat, they talk. It feels nice – normal – like his life is in balance again.
He blocks out the voices yelling behind him, closes his eyes, and unleashes the full power of the gauntlet on the Mad Titan.
"Sure, I would love to," Steve tells them. Casey cheers happily and dashes across the store to his favourite table, careful not to upend his cookie. Steve pours himself a cup of coffee, grabs a muffin and comes around to join them.
Steve lets out a strangled noise, grinding up and fucking into Tony, and then everything is hotter and slicker, and he knows that means Steve is coming in him, filling him.
“Tony what’s going on?” Steve asks, concern edging into his voice. Tony frowns in confusion, and stares into the space. A second later, another projectile comes hurtling in from the opposite side of the room — an arrow with some kind of less than aerodynamic deformity at the end which arcs through the air towards Clint’s hiding spot. Clint must sense that it’s coming because at the last second, he dives out of the way, bow in hand, and grabs the fallen arrow and shoots it back across the room.
"It's not like that," Steve protests again even though it falls on deaf ears. "Besides, we're insanely busy right now with the new store. I barely have time to think, let alone worry about a crush. Which, by the way, does not exist."
"Okay, I'll accept that," Steve chuckles. "But seriously, Tony. Call Nat. She'll understand, and she'll stay with him. He'll be in the safest possible hands, next to yours. That's why you hired her. You can still video call him and say goodnight, and they're going to have a blast. It'll be like a slumber party. He and Nat will build a pillow fort or something, and camp out in the living room, and when you get home tomorrow he'll tell you all about it. And everything will be okay."
"Well, good, that makes it easier. So, what are you doing now?" He motions to her and all her three other colleagues, who are all covered in goop.
Steve doesn't answer – nothing seems appropriate. He'd stayed, watching over Tony, because of a visceral need. It hadn't been a favour to her or to anyone else. It had been his own deep compulsion to see him, to be there when he, hopefully, wakes up.
"Oh, uh, hey, Cap – Captain. Captain America. Um, hi, I'm, uh, I'm Peter." The boy sitting on the other side of Tony's bed can't be very old. 16 or 17 at most, Steve thinks.
the kind of man who would stand up until he fell down, who would give his life for someone else when he needed to. The kind who would give up everything in order to save everyone else.
Bucky's off to physio for the nerve damage in his arm, and Steve's headed uptown to the new location. They hired contractors for the main stuff, but now that it's finishing work like paint and flooring, they're doing some of the work themselves to save money.
"Oh, well, in that case," Tony breaks in, sipping at his coffee, "I actually have to go to Rochester on Thursday for a meeting. I was thinking of driving up for a change of scenery. I could take you? The company might be nice."
But it turns out that he doesn’t have to worry, because Tony can carry a conversation all on his own, and he launches into telling Steve about how he’d found the ballet Iron Man online, and that segued into Tony talking about about what he was working on at the time, and suddenly… it’s easy. Tony hauls the conversation along, and Steve has enough space to ask questions without feeling awkward or pressured. Tony seems happy to explain things Steve doesn’t understand, but he’s not patronizing about it. By the time their food arrives, every napkin on the table is covered in pen diagrams from Tony explaining things to Steve, and he stops only long enough to shove a bite of pancake into his mouth and wash it down with another swallow of coffee. Steve follows suit, and takes a bite of his own, and then freezes, eyes widening.
"Look I get that, I think that's great, totally. I'm jazzed. But I need you to do all of that somewhere that
Steve immediately starts coughing, and Tony drops to his knees on the street beside him. "Steve? Honey, talk to me." Steve only manages to continuing coughing in reply, but he's at least breathing. It's the longest minute of his life, waiting for Steve to finally catch his breath.
“Look, I’m not planning anything, okay? It was just a thought, nothing more.” He snatches the card up off the counter and shoves it into a drawer, closing it with more force than was strictly necessary.  “I need to get ready. I want to make sure I know the layout and the exits.”
"Yeah," Tony says quietly. "From some of the stuff that Ultron got from that asshole who stole it from here. I'm sorry," he adds.
He closes the door to the bathroom, and locks it, letting out a shaky breath. He'd hoped that eating and casually chatting might settle things in his head, but nope. His brain has decided to play 'Naked Steve Rogers – The Highlight Reel' on repeat in his head. Over, and over again. He closes his eyes, and all he can see is Steve's gorgeous body and his bright smile.
Steve has to hand it to them, when SHIELD wants to, they can get things done fast. Two days later, he’s carrying his shield and his duffle bag that contains all of his worldly possessions as he trudges up the stairs to his new apartment. It’s in lower Manhattan. He’s been out to Brooklyn once since he woke up, but he’s not ready to move back there yet. Maybe one day, but not yet. It’s familiar and too foreign at the same time. Manhattan is recognizable, comfortable, but it’s not as jarring because it was never
Whatever the opposite of thrilled is, that's how Bucky appears right now. He's radiating electric hostility. Admittedly, it's well covered – Steve doubts a random stranger would pick up on anything more than a subdued mood, but Steve knows him better than that. It's a little concerning, almost. Natasha seems nice, and he's got no doubt that Tony vetted her with a
"Miss Tasha is really fun – she takes me to the park a lot, and she said on Tuesday we're going to the aquarium!"
“Right. Well I know you don’t know me that well right now. But trust me. As soon as you remember me, you’ll realise how ridiculous that it.”
"Is that Thor?" comes Bruce over the comms from inside the Hulkbuster suit. The Hulk is nowhere to be seen today, and as much as Tony likes his friend, he's very ready for the other guy to make an appearance. "Nice of you to show up, finally," Bruce continues.
Steve laughs, and raises his wine glass, and hand in hand, they toast. It's not the date Tony set out to have, but he'll take it. Beside, he's got Steve, finally. Everything else is just details.
"Steve, I'm right here," a voice says. He feels hands grab his shoulders, arms wrap around him and hold him. "It's Tony. Stay with me."
of different spaces before deciding on the one that we did. We considered a number of locations, we did the market research, we have the neighbourhoods stats, we chose that location specifically because it's what we need, and we think we can provide a service that will help the neighbourhood. You said yourself, there is no place nearby for coffee, and it's a lively, vibrant neighbourhood. We're giving people a place to come together. We want to be a part of the community. "
Tony nods in reply. "Hit some black ice, spun out, tire clipped a windrow. Little less than a mile from here."
Good god, not only have these stupid things ruined his dinner, they don't have the good decency to keep their friends corralled. Cursing under his breath, Tony shoots skyward to get a better view. Maybe if he can figure out where they're coming from, he can figure out how to stop them coming.
The doors close, and the three men look at each other quietly for a moment as the elevator cabin starts to rise.
Natasha steps to the side and grabs her tea, taking a seat at a table close to the counter. A few minutes later, Tony walks in, right on schedule, and Steve visibly perks up. This would be so much easier if they could just corner Steve into telling Tony how he feels, but Bucky knows him best, and also he's right. They try that, and Steve is going to end up doing a solid impression of a clam on roller skates and that will be the end of it. They'll be stuck in Steve-making-sad-puppy-faces hell forever. Or worse, they'll fuck things up entirely and one of them will pull away, and this whole dynamic they've built between all of them – which Clint really likes, okay? – will all come crashing down around them. No, Bucky's right. Painful as it is to have to wait, they need to be smart.
again. It's soft, and absent minded — Tony's probably not even aware that he's making it — but it goes straight through Steve and threatens to fill his mind with potential for thoughts he is definitely
She doesn't even look at him, instead just staring at Tony for another long, awkward moment, then turning and, somewhat huffily, collecting her laptop, her purse, and her jacket, and stomping out of the store.
They give him free rein in the tower to go where he wants, he’s not a prisoner after all, and JARVIS can monitor him. But in the first 24 hours he does little more than eat, and train. Tony orchestrates an ‘accidental’ run in with him in the kitchen, but Steve just looks at him passively, thanks him for the hospitality, and politely excuses himself.
"Uh huh, sure," Rhodey says. Tony wishes his BFF – and really, why is Rhodey his BFF with all this flack he's giving Tony? – could see the way that he's rolling his eyes. Too bad they aren't on a video call.
Ugh. He absolutely did not want Rhodey to find out about that. Stupid Steve. "Only because the place was booked up, and this was all that was left."
Steve looked over at the group of aliens – the Guardians of the Galaxy, they'd called themselves, which wasn't at all pretentious as far as Tony was concerned, no siree. "You need to find the Soul stone before Thanos does," he said. "You need to find it, and you need to protect it."
he'd made. God, it was like pure sex, like that hot water was the most pleasurable thing Steve had ever felt.
Strange shrugged. "Mm, about 10 minutes? Once we have everything in order, that is, and move ourselves to a more secure location to keep you all in."
Tony knows a losing battle when he sees one, so he decides to ignore Rhodey completely, and turns back to Steve, ridiculously charmed by the bemused expression on his face as he pours Tony's black coffee into an oversized ceramic cup. "Don't mind Rhodey," he says, positioning his shoulders just so, so that he's turned slightly away from his best friend. "He's suffering from heat stroke, or asshole stroke. One or the other."
He brings his contact page up and scrolls up to Clint's name, taps it and brings the phone to his ear.
"It's fine, don't be ridiculous. We can share," Tony insists. "Besides, after our impromptu rollercoaster ride, we're both probably going to be sore in the morning. We both need somewhere soft to sleep. It's just one night."
Great. So, Thor's off who only knows where, and Thanos is very much here, and now, wielding four out of the six gems and making a beeline for the last two. Tony quickly flies over to Vision and lands beside him and Wanda.
“Oookay then,” Stark says, watching him go before wandering into the room further and glancing around. His fingers never stop moving, running along the back of the couch, snapping and clicking. Even when he’s standing still he gives the appearance of movement, the impression of kinetic energy, and his eyes are constantly calculating. Not in what Steve would call an unsavoury way, just in a way that looks like he’s taking everything in at a speed faster than anyone else in the room. He doesn’t say anything at first, so Steve is the one to break the silence that’s settling between them.
Clint, Sam and Steve are in the car with them. Clint is squished into the other side of the back seat, and Steve is in the middle.
"He's not an illusion," Hammer is saying, voice strained under Natasha's merciless hand – squeezing now – around her throat. "I had it the whole time. The kid
"How will you make us belong there, then?" asked Sam. "How will we know Vision is the one we need to protect?"
Tony breathes a sigh of relief, but he's still anxious as all hell. "Back here, but no idea what state, or how hurt."
"Great, so they both have the emotional maturity of a blueberry. That's just peachy," Clint says. "So what's the plan? 'Cause we definitely can't just like, set them up on a date. They'll never go for it."
. He's warm and solid and here in Tony's arms, kissing Tony, big hands working their way up to cradle Tony's head, fingers burrowing into Tony's unkempt hair.
"You two are always like that with each other, even when we were still deployed." Steve hops up on the counter and waits a moment for his brain to reset. "I'm... wow. I'm really happy for you both. Really. That's amazing. I'm just also very
"That was fun!" Casey says happily. "I wanna come back soon. Steve is really nice and I like him lots."
And yet, right now, in this moment he's happy. They both are. Surely, there's nothing wrong with holding on to that, is there?
"Hmm," Clint hums thoughtfully as he appears back at Steve's side. "He seems in a much better mood this morning. I'm glad to see he's moved on from trying to displace us. You seem to have won him over."
"Okay," he agrees, and takes the coffee as his expression shifts into the bright grin that makes Steve's chest feel like it's about to burst with affection. "And hey, if you ever need anything else fixed, seriously, let me know. I like it, being able to fix stuff."
Once, Steve had told Tony he wasn't the type to make the sacrifice play, that he was the type to stand back and wait for the glory of the win. He'd never been so wrong about another person.
"Good. Go, make things to help stop the self replicating problem. We'll take care of the stuff out here."
Tony wakes up in a hospital bed. The room is dark, cold. There's the quiet, steady beeping of a heart monitor beside him. As his awareness grows to take in more of the room, he realizes there are more beds, more heart monitors, and the result is a cacophony of beeps at different rhythms and tones.
"Steve!" Tony says desperately. "Steve, Steve, Sandi won't take my money. Why won't Sandi take my money?"
He shivers a little as he washes himself down with the hotel soap. It's not a shiver of chill, not this time. Just his body coming down from what was, frankly, a pretty good orgasm.
Steve shrugs, unconcerned. "He's harmless. I mean, he was prickly at first, and I kind of thought he was a homophobic asshat. But that was just wires getting crossed. He's fine."
“Alright Capsicle, I’ll prove it. Come here.”  Tony takes Steve across the lab to the small scale portable CT scanner he borrowed after calling in a favour. He convinces Steve to let him take another scan of his head, and although it takes some time, he eventually gets the results up on his display.
an illusion," Hammer says, and Natasha knows what she's going to say, feels the same realization dawning on her, and she wants to
He sighs, and pulls out his phone, snapping a photo of the drawing to add to the library of ‘Steve’s whiteboard doodles’ that he keeps. His shoulders slump a little, and Sam’s voice cuts into this thoughts, a little gentler. “He’ll be back soon.”
you've got. You put the 'twit' in twitterpated. Your eyes did that creepy Bambi thing when you said his name. I'll show you, say it again."
Tony lets out a hollow laugh. "It wasn't real. Whatever was between us wasn't real. It was all part of playing pretend. Our fake perfect life, our fake kid, our fake happiness."
cookies, and he's determined to try each and every kind. As soon as Clint hears about this, he sets out to come up with different weird combinations, so that by the time Casey gets through all the standard array, there will be more new flavours and kinds for him to try. Clint admits one evening while he's whipping up a batch of maple glazed apple crisp cookies that he's actually really enjoying the excuse to experiment with baking a little bit.
It was thanks to Bucky that they were able to find Steve so quickly, but a week with HYDRA might as well be an eternity. There had still been ample time for HYDRA to inflict their damage.
Casey is looking up at the display case of pastries in awe, as though he's been living in a black and white movie his whole life, and this is the moment he's finally seeing colour. Clint's sweets, cakes, squares and pies do look pretty tempting, but Tony doesn't want to put the poor kid into a sugar coma.
Tony might have to up the difficulty of the next training battle, because damn, they are kicking ass. They've essentially already won, it's just a matter of cleaning up the stragglers. From the corner of his eye, Tony sees Clint take another shot, and an instant later a bright splatter of pink appears across the training floor.
She gives him a smile, and he can't decide what's off about it, except that there's something. It's almost predatory, which is usually a pretty good indicator of what's about to happen, in his experience.
"She's the coolest! She'll fight all the bad guys and protect us! But she says she likes kids, and wanted to help keep a special kid safe. That's why she wanted to be my nanny, and she is the best and most fun nanny ever."
For a moment, the two of them circle around each other, sizing each other up. Steve plans on waiting for Stark to make the first move. They’re both wearing light padded sparring gloves, and Steve knows how to pull his punches, but he’s still very aware of the fact that he’s bigger, stronger, faster, and drastically outclasses Stark. Or so he thinks, until Stark darts forward in a flash and lands a sharp blow under Steve’s ribs.
They have been through so much, he and Tony. More than anyone can reasonably be expected to go through with a friend, and come out whole on the other side.
Since the last time he'd slept in a bed had been that last night in the Haven with Tony, Steve can't bring himself to curl up in the bed that's waiting for him, so after Bucky leaves, he stretches out along the couch and closes his eyes. Enough time in war means he can force himself to fall asleep just about anywhere, so he falls asleep fairly quickly.
"You can't tell that from the smell," Steve says, and there's just enough doubt in his voice to pull a smile out of Tony.
"There is a distributor in Rochester who's willing to work with us and give us a hell of a good deal on maple syrup."
"Casey the goober wanted to say good night to you," Tony says, holding up the phone so Steve can see Casey and Natasha on the screen.
Steve reluctantly pulls back, gripping Tony's shoulders to hold him at arm's length. Tony's eyes look a little unfocused, his cheeks a little pink.
Steve shakes his head. "Nah, it's fine. You say they're good, then they're good. I'm happy to have them – unless they specifically want the interview experience."
actually take a day off. One of his new hires is a former quartermaster, and the single most organised person Steve has ever met. In a matter of days, Sandi had completely taken over managing the inventory and ordering for both shops. Steve had thought the system he had in place had been pretty good, until he saw how well she had streamlined the whole thing. She'd been a lifesaver, honestly.
Steve had almost dropped the phone when Tony had said those three horrible words. All his combat and tactical training had taken a back seat for a moment, and all he felt was frozen terror. He had sagged against the wall, just in time for Bucky to come to the back and find out why he'd run off on the phone.
“Just get your sexy butt home soon,” Tony tells him, letting go the resentment, and it fades away, far back into the background.
"I think we have a lot in common," she says. She barely looks at the signed napkin, shoving it into her pocket with little reverence, gaze still locked on his. She doesn't move to go back to her own table, instead just standing there, as though waiting for him to continue the conversation.
"I don't think I'm gonna be able to walk right for a week," Tony says, lips a little uncooperative. "You proud of yourself?"
He washes his hands and gets to work, slathering pesto over slices of bread to assemble paninis for the lunch special. They'll grill them to order, of course, but the only way they'll be able to keep up with the volume is if they have them prepped to start. Besides – back here, he doesn't have to watch Clint and Bucky snicker about him 'behind his back', and he can let his mind wander. And if, from time to time, his mind repeatedly wanders to the obscenely sexual sound Tony had made at his first sip of Steve's coffee, well, no one has to know that but him.
"He's doing great," Tony assures him. "He's a good fit, he's one of us now. Even if he is a complete menace. I swear to god, he and Clint bring out the best and worst in each other."
There was a time in his life that Tony would have made some flippant comment and walked away. But now — now he’s stared at loss too many times and felt his heart break in too many pieces. He knows when he’s damn lucky to have something back.  So he curls into Steve’s embrace a little and rests his head on Steve’s shoulder.
"And yet you made me say it anyway," Tony says, putting his coffee down on his own nightstand. "Steve,
look unattractive, but it was still jarring to see. It made her whole face look pale, so she looked like a ghost.
"Well, it wouldn't make any sense to open a coffee shop in Manhattan if we don't fully intend to get our customers hopelessly addicted to the coffee," Steve grins. "Clint and Bucky will both tell you I'm bad at backing down from a challenge."
There's a steady stream of customers coming in and getting coffees – nine in the morning was a good time to meet because it means Tony can come straight to the coffee shop after dropping Casey off at school, but it also means that all the morning commuters are in, and he doesn't have much of a proper chance to talk to Steve.
Tony doesn't even try to stop himself as his hand wraps around his erection. The quickest, easiest way to deal with this unwelcome arousal is to jerk off quickly, get it out of his system so he can sleep.
Steve is still in the shower, probably trying to get the goop out of his hair as Tony wanders into the kitchen. is own hair is still damp, and he silently rejoices the fact that he has spare guest bathrooms so he didn't have to wait for Steve to finish up. It gives him time to throw together his plan. He grabs everything he needs, and tells JARVIS to have Steve meet him up on the roof terrace, before dashing off in the suit again. He really hopes Steve takes his sweet time washing up.
Tony either doesn't hear him, or chooses to ignore him as he all but crawls into the oven. Steve can't see what he's doing, but he hears clanging and scraping.
"You have to be fucking kidding me right now," Tony growls. "So Vision is out there, somewhere – you have no idea where – and god only knows what state he's in? That's just fucking peachy, Strange. Thank you for that."
Thanos sneers. "So be it, then," and raises his fist. Thor is quicker, the axe is already swinging in his hand. He catches Thanos' strike with the axe, and for a moment they're locked in a stalemate. Then, the fight really begins.
"Thanos is too powerful," Thor said. "If he makes it to Earth, we will need all the firepower we can muster to keep the stones safe from him."
"Food first," Tony agrees, taking his seat on the other side of the table, and they both dig in eagerly.
Truthfully, Tony was feeling a little bit like he might side with Bruce on this one. He felt like he really had lost his mind. All the pain and frustration and anger at Steve came bubbling to the surface, and he knew he was about to say something he'd regret, something he couldn't take back.
"Tony," Tony corrects her automatically, as he has done every day since she started working for him. "Did you guys have a good day?"
But he smiles back, and even Steve can feel the way it lights up when his eyes meet Tony's. But he must look as terrible as he'd thought, because Tony's eyebrows draw up, and there's a hint of concern in his face. Steve gets through a couple more people before Tony's at the counter, and – miracle of miracles – Tony's the last person in the line. Steve looks forward to the little reprieve, and even more looks forward to hearing about how Tony's day is going so far. It'll be better than Steve's day is going, anyway.
He holds Bucky's eye for a moment, both of them silently counting in their heads, and then it's a burst of movement as Steve twists out from around the corner, back on the street, and Bucky is right there behind him, gun aimed up high. There's a muzzle flash from a window somewhere, and that was a mistake because now Bucky can zero in on the bastard.
He asks a lot about his time before the plane went down. Tony leaves Bucky to field those questions, but he always stays close by. So does Sam.
Tony and Sam circle around, providing the air support as Natasha and Bucky move around on the ground making short work of the remaining baddies. On his right, Tony sees an arrow shooting past, dragging a cable behind it and fixing itself into the wall. A moment later, Clint is whooping loudly as he ziplines across the training space. He lets go and drops, arrow in hand, landing on top of one of the enemies and stabbing it with the arrow before he stands and shoots it through another. Meanwhile, Tony is back in the air with Sam, circling above and firing shots to keep all the little buggers where they want them to be. Tony's cackling over the comms in joy all the while. Rhodey is going to be pissed that he missed out on this session, because honestly, they're having a blast. It would also be better with Steve here, but at least having Steve on the comms barking at them all is better than nothing.
to him, okay? I promise you, you're more than good enough for him. And he's definitely good enough for you."
"You do?" Clint and Bucky ask simultaneously. Clint sits up and stares over at her in anticipation. Seriously, if she has an honest-to-god solution for this mutual pining shit show that they're all living through, Clint might very well just kiss her. Surely Bucky would understand.
And somehow, Steve can’t say no. Without even thinking about it, he manages to drag himself to his feet, wash his tear stained face and make himself look a little more presentable. There isn’t much he can do about the puffy redness around his eyes, but it’ll fade quickly enough. He hopes that maybe Tony won’t notice, or at least will be kind enough to not comment.
"You mean too wrapped up in staring at Tony Stark," Bucky grins, prodding Steve in the ribs with his elbow.
"Look, the reality was built around Vision, right? He was the literal centre of the universe." By this point, everyone in the room is staring at Strange, waiting. "If we had been able to deconstruct the reality properly, and bring you back as intended, it would have been okay. But because the reality was so sharply shattered, there is a very good chance that some kind of magical kickback would have impacted Vision."
If the woman bound to the chair in the centre of the room were to make an unexpected noise, if she were to move in an unanticipated way, Bucky would be on his feet and at her throat in less than an instant.
Tony snorts at that, half in disbelief, because what are the odds? But he looks up at Steve and glances over his shoulder to where Man-bun and the attractive-but-not-as-attractive-as-Steve blond are still standing behind the counter, watching them without bothering to hide that they're watching.
"Guh? I don't –" Clint manages to sputter in confusion as the tension that had been stretching between Natasha and Bucky promptly shatters. Bucky nods once, almost imperceptible, and Natasha turns and saunters out after Tony.
"Wait, if we can't remember Thanos, can't remember who we are – how will we know we have to protect Vision? If we're all just – in this other reality, will we even know each other?" asked Clint.
Steve shrugs. "There are a lot of people who are in need that fall through the cracks. Figure if I can help even some of them, it's good. My Ma didn't always have an easy time of things, raising me on her own. But we had a lot of great people around us, friends who helped her out, people she helped out. As I grew up, it made me appreciate how important community is. That's what I'm trying to do here. And why I think we can do some good in your 'wholesome family neighbourhood'."
Tony sticks out his right hand, giving Steve his best thousand-watt publicity grin. "Tony Stark," he says, finally introducing himself, "of Stark Resilient."
He tips his chin up and kisses Tony again, and this time it's less frantic – warm, slow, honey kisses that start to pick up speed after a long time.
"No, there is something else I need," Thor said. "A weapon to aid us, because when Thanos comes, he's not coming in light."
someone get to Casey? He should have been at school. Tony would have dropped him off this morning, then headed to the office. He usually would have stopped at the shop for a coffee between, but not this week.
out on this mission. This kind of underhanded information gathering is not his forte, and add to that is the fact that he’s having a hell of a hard time playing the role of ‘interested patron enthusiastically enjoying a beautiful woman stripping him down to nothing, teasing him with playful brushes of her fingers and telling him that he could look, but not touch’.
Tony's world. The idea of someone else getting to have all the hours of Casey's day, his giggles and his smiles and his hugs, is like a knife in Tony's gut.
But the real star is Okoye. She is a sharp and fearless General, and her troops respond without hesitation. For a few moments, Tony dares to think that maybe, just maybe they might stand a chance.
Tony makes a noise at that, and sits up, but stays close, pressed into his best friend's side. "Ugh. I can't believe he thought that. So weird."
"Tell us again," Natasha says, sometime later after she, Clint and Sam have arrived. "From the beginning."
At that moment, Tony pulls up in the vehicle, and Steve thanks her, shakes her hand, and jumps into the car.
of research before deciding to set up the office near here. And I did even more before I decided to move us here and put Casey in Trinity."
“Now this is a story all about how my life got flipped, turned upside down,” Stark half sings out of nowhere. Steve stares at him blankly. Clearly he’s missing something. “Yeah, don’t worry about it. You’ll catch up,” Stark tells him. Steve isn’t convinced, but he lets it slide.
"Good," Steve says, and Tony's surprised, he's not being nearly as friendly and chatty as usual. "How are you, Colonel?"
He’s so wrapped up in not thinking that he doesn’t even register that he has a visitor until JARVIS alerts him.
Rhodey shrugs, and lets it go for the time being. But Tony knows him well enough to know that he hasn't heard the last of this.
Steve groans and closes his eyes, because he's trapped between them and there is literally nowhere to hide his face. Sometimes he absolutely hates his stupid friends.
get sick from being cold, right?" Tony is still standing beside the bed, looking torn. If Steve didn't know better, he'd think Tony was actually nervous.
They both regain their footing in a second and move to strike again, when out of nowhere, Tony appears behind the guy, still wielding his barstool, and brings it down on the back of the guy’s head. He drops like a sack of bricks and doesn’t move.
"Right. Uh, thanks then," Steve says and shuts the door. He immediately slumps against it, and barely manages to resist the urge to thump his head against the door repeatedly. He wishes this were still a dream, and not one of the single most awkward mornings of his life.
It knocks the air out of his lungs, and his arm loosens enough for Casey to slide free, and Casey runs to Steve, fast as he can. The guy is trying not to slide to the ground, and Steve pushes Casey behind him, where he can be protected, pushes him out the door.
"I'll tell you why," Bucky cuts in. "It's because you're in love with him, and it scares the ever loving shit out of you."
Casey kicks again, hard, his spindly knee bending so he can stomp back, and his little heel connects with the bastard's groin.
Tony freezes on the spot. Last ditch effort. If this doesn't work, Bucky has probably effectively screwed up any chance Steve has at happiness with Tony. For a long second, Bucky is sure that Tony is going to snap on him, but he doesn't. Instead, he lets out a shaky breath, and Bucky takes that as a sign that it's okay to step a little closer into Tony's space.
of regrets. Steve is grimy, sweaty, and, he thinks, covered in grease when he hears the chime of the door out front. He's got his head buried in the oven, and as much as he's losing the battle with appliance repair, he doesn't want to get up and deal with the front counter. However, he hears the chime another three times, and he knows he's got to go help Evan, their newest hire from the veterans employment program. Sam's hanging out in the kitchen with Steve, handing him tools, but he doesn't know anything about fixing defunct ovens. Sam has also been scouring Youtube for help, to no avail.
He sets a bookmark in place to mark his page and listens to the conversation as the men speaking come closer to the lounge that he’s curled up in. Normally he wouldn’t care about agents bickering, but this is something else. It’s Coulson’s calm voice saying, “Really, you’re not authorized to see him. You can’t be here right now.”
Steve finishes pouring Rhodey's coffee into a clear plastic cup filled with ice cubes. He adds a splash of cream to the concoction and tops it with a domed lid before sliding it across the counter to Rhodey.
When he's done with the background checks on the two candidates he kept – for which he definitely didn't use any questionable computer remote-access skills he may or may not possess – he decides to send an email to the first one, if only because she's got recommendations from two separate high-profile private security firms and a masters degree in early childhood education. He's not sure what kind of person has that kind of disparate experience, but whoever she is, he wants to meet her.
Tony is already at the diner when he arrives, and Steve slides into the booth across from him. Diners are different now, but this one still has a retro vibe that Steve can identify as having originated in the post-war years. For a half second, he thinks Tony might have chosen this place to appeal to him, but as the waitress arrives at the table and asks Tony if he’d like “the usual, darlin’?” Steve recognises that this is a usual haunt. The waitress turns to him, and greets him with a warm smile.
“You learn fast,” Tony comments with approval. “Which is good. Because I definitely understand why you used to get beat up all the time.”
Steve wants to ask more questions, but a crowd of college students comes in at just that moment, and it's all hands on deck.
“Look here, and here,” he says, pulling up another image. “This is your brain when we first got you back, the scan the doctors took while you were still unconscious in medical.” He points over to the new image. “This here, is the one that we just took. See the differences here? There are already neural pathways rerouting themselves. Here, you can see where HYDRA’s work intentionally cut off the connections to the part of your brain that stores memories. But, your brain is already healing itself, and reconnecting. You said you were dreaming in memories?”
Steve shrugs. "We have to assume it's a team, to be on the safe side." He points to a space between two buildings on the computer screen. "See here? This is going to be our rendezvous."
Tony had done it. He'd beat Thanos, destroyed him and all his army. But it had been a long, brutal battle up until that point. There are many dead, and many more injured. The most seriously injured had been spirited away to the Palace's hospital. Tony is there, but most of the other Avengers had made it out relatively unscathed.
“Of course you’re right,” Steve agrees. “This is your area. But  you always tell me how terrible I am undercover.”
Rhodey turns back to Tony and stares at him, expression blank but somehow conveying 'what is happening right now?'
Tony glares. "Don't you have work to do? Why are you still in my office? Go do something productive. You have helicopters to design."
Tony frowns in thought. "I can still see you, buddy. So I guess it's not invisibility. Maybe you have super speed now? How fast do you think you can run and wash your hands for supper?"
"Yeah, he's the owner. Well, one of the owners. But the coffee always tastes better when Steve makes it."
In the last fraction of a second, he lets himself mourn for what he never had with Steve. Maybe it could have been different, but now he'll never know for sure.
Tony nods. "Remember e-cig douche guy?" Steve hums in agreement. "When the thing attacked him, and he coughed out a cloud of vapour, the slime ball shriveled and recoiled. Polyethylene glycol, it's an ingredient in that type of e-cigarette. It is also," Tony pauses for a hint of drama, "an ingredient in the type of paint used specifically in paintballs."
Natasha orders her tea from Steve, who's up at the till, and as Clint starts pouring the hot water into a mug – the cat one because it's Natasha's favourite and she always smiles a little to herself when she gets it – and watches the way that Steve glances over her shoulder to the street outside. "This better work," Bucky mutters beside him. He, too, is watching Steve and shaking his head.
Natasha nods her head again. "Yes. But the two of them need to stop hiding, and talk to one another."
Tony's cheeks flush a little, but he just throws a grin right back at Steve. "Good, I can get behind that. Don't want my son hanging around any place that does any differently."
Natasha rolls her eyes, but punches his shoulder fondly, and Bucky clears his throat. "Back to the subject of Steve."
“Approximate countdown.” Tony waves it off like it’s nothing. “Can’t account for delays. Of which there had better be none, you hear me? Zip. Zero, Nil. Nada. Roger, Rogers?”
Rhodey looks smug as he crosses his arms over his chest and tilts his head at Tony, waiting to see how Tony will deal with this insane scenario.
time. Since we were kids. We know each other, sometimes better than we know ourselves. So while he's never said it to me, I know that at least part of the reason that he won't say anything, or act on how he feels is that he doesn't think he's good enough for you."
"You should probably hold your breath so you can suffocate and put me out of my misery," Tony says, rolling his eyes. They're almost at Brewed Awakening and Tony needs to change the subject, fast. If for no other reason than he doesn't want to be blushing when they walk in the door.
Clearly, something had happened between Steve and Stark on that trip. Bucky stays up front until Evan arrives to do the pre-lunch rush work.
It's not as opulent as he would have expected, and he's grateful for it. He knows what kind of living quarters T'Challa's palace has in it, and he's glad the king had taken Steve's own preferences into account.
"Hey," he whispers, leaning forward and wrapping both his hands over one of Tony's. His hands feel huge and clumsy, dwarfing Tony's like this, but the contact with Tony's warm, dry skin is a balm. "Hey, welcome back."
Tony’s breath catches in his throat, and he holds the cup a little tighter in his hands. He’s grateful that he has something else to look at down below, because he’s not sure he can meet Steve’s gaze.
“Hey,” Steve protests easily, “I got beat up all the time because I was half the size of the other guys.” He’s relaxed, and off center, that’s his excuse as to why he doesn’t react fast enough as Stark darts forward, grabs him and twists, throwing Steve over his hip. A split second later Steve finds himself laying on his back on the mat, staring up at Stark, who is grinning down at him.
"Yeah, we're both okay. I promise. I'm sorry that your dad can't be home tonight like he promised," Steve apologises.
"God, honey, the second I saw you I knew I wanted to get my tongue all over you," he confesses. "And that night in Syracuse? When I had to put you in the
Steve indulgently passes the mug to Tony – handle first – while Tony blinks sleepily at him. Tony brings it to his face, and takes a moment to inhale deeply, letting the smell of it permeate his being. He takes a slow sip – and yes, Steve does still make a mean cup of coffee.
"Okay, well, Steve, full disclosure, then; I'm not exactly a 'boxers' kinda guy." With one more smirk, Tony swiftly undoes his pants and lets them drop to the floor beside the bed.
"Because we're running out of time! Thanos is coming, and I thought if I took Stark's kid he'd tell me where the stone is. But he's so self-centred even
"I'm on the south perimeter," Natasha's voice comes next. Her voice is low and warm like whisky. "Clear here."
“I get the impression you probably just say whatever is on your mind regardless of what permission you have,” Steve chuckles, a little warmer this time.
"Now gimme sugar," Tony says, and Steve dutifully leans forward and pecks his lips with a kiss. He pulls back, grinning, and hands Tony the cannoli.
"It's too small, and it won't accommodate the layout that I need. I looked at it." Steve cuts him off before he can finish, but Tony isn't dissuaded. It
Tony smiles apologetically, and takes Casey's hand. Casey goes willingly, letting go of Bucky's legs.
dammit. He grips the pencil a little too hard in his frustration, and the lead snaps, smearing the face he’s spent an hour trying to make perfect. Steve yells, pain and raw frustration filling his voice as he flings the book across the living room. He can’t see where it lands because his eyes are filling with tears, hot and angry, and his chest feels like it’s constricting – he can’t breathe, like he’s having an asthma attack only a thousand times worse, because this time it feels like his heart is trying to claw its way out of his chest.
"Mostly," Steve confirms. "It's not easy, transitioning back to civilian life. Especially since a lot of vets don't have work experience outside the military, and they're struggling with their own health issues, physical and mental. We like being able to offer a work environment that's supportive of their needs, 'cause Bucky, Clint, and I, we all get it. That's also why we implemented the suspended coffee and meal service. We're trying to help where we can."
"Figured I should spend more time here to make sure the new shop is up and running," Steve replies. "You just couldn't keep away from my coffee, could you?"
"Right," Tony agrees. "Anyway, apparently telling us about the illusion was enough to shatter it. So, here we are."
Tony blinks at him for another moment, opening and closing his mouth like a fish out of water, then holds up his hand and points his index finger right into Rhodey's face. He doesn't say anything for a moment, still struggling with how to get himself out of this mess, but then he takes a deep breath.
"This cannot be happening," Tony whines, even as he is pushing himself to his feet. "Why can't they just wait until after dinner? Rude of them not to consider my social calendar."
Steve looks about as awkward as Tony feels, but he accepts the help gratefully. "You might be right," he concedes. Once Steve is down to his underwear, Tony awkwardly offers a shoulder for Steve to brace himself on and helps him to the bathroom. Tony reflexively wraps an arm around Steve's waist to support him. He'd like to strip his cold, wet slacks off, but he knows that's a bad idea, considering what
The first two goons, who come at him from a doorway in the dark hall, he dispatches easily. A block, a dodge, a couple of swift punches, and they're both down, neither of them moving any time soon.
It's as if the universe is intentionally taunting him. He's already out of sorts, stressed, upset, emotional, and now, to top it all off, he's stuck for the night in a Honeymoon Suite, with the man that he's definitely not pining over. He can already hear Rhodey taunting him about it. Stupid best friends. Speaking of Rhodey, he should probably text him and let him know that he's okay. He's got a few unanswered messages on his phone, and they have a deal to check in with each other once they've arrived safely where they're going. Rhodey is going to hit the panic zone shortly. He takes thirty seconds and fires off a message, leaving out the part about crashing the car, because really, Rhodey doesn't need to worry that much when there isn't a damn thing that he can do. He'll call Rhodey in the morning and ask for a pick up. And then promptly glare him to death if he dreams of saying anything about Steve and Tony sharing a room. A room that only has one bed. Because Honeymoon Suite.
Eventually, he climbs out of the stall, wraps himself in a towel and stares at himself in the mirror for a long time. He can't quite meet his own eyes.
"And I know I'm probably stepping over a line, but tonight proved that, if nothing else, sometimes you have to take a leap of faith. Sometimes you have to do the thing that scares you the most if it means you might get something perfect and amazing and real at the end."
to change the subject, he knows. Something safer. Something that pulls Steve's focus away from Rhodey's comment — a comment for which Tony will later murder him, of course. But Tony is so stunned that Rhodey would have the
