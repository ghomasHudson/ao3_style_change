Despite the busyness of the street, the coffee shop was fairly empty when they arrived. After placing their orders, Steve and Sam settled into a table in the back corner, where Sam shot Steve a wary look as he eyed Steve's large peppermint tea.
"I would definitely agree with that assessment." In Peter's exhausted haze earlier that morning he had only packed about half of his usual amount of snacks, and had been planning on raiding the kitchen as soon as he got home.
"He was pretty bad," said Uncle Bucky. "There were a lot of nights when he slept at our house 'cause his ma was working an overnight shift or something, and he'd be wheezing so bad that he sounded like a dull aircraft engine. Some of those nights I'd even force myself to stay awake just to make sure that he didn't stop breathing."
"He is indeed, Master Peter," JARVIS said. "Please be advised, Captain Rogers has asked me to remind you that you are supposed to be returning to the Tower. Mr Wilson and Sergeant Barnes are currently in the process of coordinating with the rest of the team."
Reluctantly, Tony released him, a soft smile playing on his lips as he watched Steve rise from the bed, the muscles in his back and shoulders flexing deliciously as he dressed in his running clothes.
"No! Don't!" Peter croaked as Thanos' head whipped towards the wizard, his grip loosening ever-so-slightly as he eyed Dr Strange.
Tony said with a soft smile. Once again, Steve had read him like a book. "I guess I really have corrupted you, hmm?"
Sorry for forcing Dad to have to beg for his life to be spared twice in the span of about twenty minutes, which had to be some kind of a record, as hero gigs go.
“Well, that sounds pretty cool,” Natasha says, taking a sip of her tea.  “Seems like a good way for you to get back into it, hmm?”
"Oh, please, sir, I insist!" said Mr Harrington. "I mean, who better to enrich these young minds with tales of post-WWII life than the man who actually lived it, right?"
"Yeah, we know him," Blaster Guy said, scowling as he glanced over at Green Lady. "Tall guy, not that good-looking, needed saving."
"Hey, kiddo, you doing okay? No, wait, don't answer that," he added before Peter could even open his mouth. "Sorry. Stupid question."
"Okay, good," said Steve. He reached for a bottle of superwater, running his sleeve across his sweaty forehead. "I'm gonna—"
Peter obviously hadn't been around while his father was growing up and therefore had only heard about the deconstruction of Dad and Grandpa's relationship from Dad's point of view, but based on his own observations and his relationships with them both, it wasn't too shocking that they'd had their various issues over the years. Both of them were stubborn as hell—as was Peter, but that was currently beside the point—and also very forward-thinking, something that Peter's father liked to call being a futurist.
Unfortunately, Steve knows all too well what that’s like.  He’s been like that for almost an entire year now.
"Someone," Howard practically spat out. "Yeah, I'm almost positive that it was Pym, Chester. He's the only one stupid enough to do something like that."
"Well…" Steve said as he grabbed the hard chair shoved into the corner, dragging it next to Peter's bed. "Do you mind if I sit down?"
"Man, who would've thought that these would be getting replaced so fast!" Bucky said as he jumped down from his X-301, running his hand lovingly along the wing. "We were just starting to get to know each other!"
Thor shook his head, staring down at the ground, where his axe had fallen once Thanos disappeared. Steve took another step towards him, preparing to shake an answer out of him if necessary when he heard Bucky's voice behind him.
I can’t wait to see what you think!  Please don’t forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment!  💖
"I love you," he whispered happily, the sentiment meant for both of his sweet boys. Then he picked up Peter's discarded drafting pencil, adjusted his desk lamp, and went back to work on the airliner design, already daydreaming of their upcoming ski vacation.
"Pete, just stop right there, okay? Just… give me a second." Tony sucked in a deep breath, uncurling his fingers from his arm as he tried to figure out how he was supposed to react. Peter had deliberately gone behind he and Steve's backs and messed around with stuff that he had no business messing with, but at the same time he had uncovered some pretty important information about what HYDRA had been trying to accomplish, so while Tony knew that he should punish him, he was honestly so fried at the moment that he could barely think.
“Yes, that’s really important too,” Steve says.  “You may notice an increase in Peter’s appetite while he adjusts, so don’t be too surprised if that happens.  Swimming is a full-body sport and it burns a lot of calories, which means he’ll need to replenish those calories so he doesn't lose any muscle mass.”
“We’re almost done, hon!” Tony called from Peter’s bedroom.  “Took the kid awhile to find a pair of pants that were long enough.”
And then, if that hadn't been enough, having to watch Tony fall from the sky right afterwards. Being chased back through the closing portal by the rapidly expanding fireball, his limp body twisting and turning in the air as he fell, all while Steve watched helplessly from the ground below.
And Tony didn't like it, not one single bit.  He couldn’t seem to shake his overall feeling of dread that one day he was going to wake up—or not, as was more likely the case—and Peter would suddenly be a fully grown man, and have no further need for his father.
"JARVIS, do me a favour and run another quick diagnostic on the interface for me, yeah?" Tony asked as he tapped some final commands into his monitor. Through the Hulk-proofed windows of Bruce's panic room he could see Steve sitting next to Bucky on the bed, talking to him while Bruce finished attaching a series of sensors to his chest and temples and Sam took his position over in the back corner. Clint, Natasha, and Thor were with him in the anteroom, standing off to the side of the monitors and ready with the emergency supply of Helen's super-sedative if things ended up going south.
And then, less than a month later, she was gone.  Killed when a drunk driver decided to blow through a red light and t-bone her car.
Taking his time, Tony explored and kissed all across Steve's glorious chest and abs, finally popping the button on his jeans when he felt Steve's fingertips digging into his shoulders. He licked his lips as he slid Steve's pants and underwear down his legs, pausing for a second to take him in.
"So, my daughter mentioned something about the Decathlon team being invited to stay in the Stark Industries building down in D.C. during their big competition?" Stacy asked.
Next to him, Thor let out a grunt as they picked up speed, his massive axe swinging with every pump of his arms, just as Steve's heart was pounding in time with Hulk and Scott's thundering footsteps as they raced towards Thanos and his stolen army.
"Say chess," Peter said as he snapped the picture, smiling widely as he lowered the phone. "Aww, it's actually not a bad picture."
“Oh God, T-Tony, I’m not—I need—” Steve stammered as he raked his fingers through his hair.  “Tony, I—I can’t—I need—I need you to—”
"Okay, but please, just listen to me?" Goosebumps covered nearly Peter's entire body from the shivers running down his spine, and the battle sounds were getting louder and more frantic. The odds did not seem to be in the Avengers' favour at the moment, so Peter needed to be out there, helping his family.
And only a month after those fateful Games, Steve lost Ma, sending him spiralling into such a deep and dark depressive state that if he hadn’t met Natasha when he did… there's no telling where he would be now.
a child, why can't you see that?" Peter snapped, pushing against papa's chest and almost knocking him over. "I'm a teenager, and I'm even stronger than you! Papa, you
"Okay, fine, but then what is the best?" asked Peter. "'Cause I really don't think that sending me away and reducing your potential fighting force is." He didn't add that as much as he would love to visit Asgard with Uncle Thor, he absolutely didn't want it to be under those kind of circumstances.
"Yeah, it does!" Ned insisted. "Or… well… you know what I mean. Like, ever since the school year started you've been acting so jumpy and paranoid, and just… well, just
And since the Tower's defence drones hadn't yet taken it out, hadn't even fired on it, from what Peter could tell, then they had obviously come prepared for the Avengers' defences.
The kiss started out slow, like they usually did. Tony had been letting Steve set the pace for their physical activities since he'd confessed to Tony that he wasn't very experienced, and the benefits had definitely outweighed the sometimes painful reality of waiting until he felt comfortable with going further. Just like he did with everything else, Steve kissed Tony with his whole heart and soul, and what he lacked in experience he more than made up for in passion and zeal. It was a kind of a first of sorts for Tony as well, who had always just thought of kissing as a stepping stone to sex, and had never before taken the time to just thoroughly explore someone else's mouth without the pressure or expectation of going further.
Tony instinctively frowned, managing to catch himself just before Bucky glanced back up at him. It had always been difficult for Tony to hear people compare Peter to him, and this was no exception. Peter was… well, he was just so
“S’eve?” Steve hears from beneath his chin, followed almost immediately by a massive shudder.  “S’eve, wha—?”
Or, as Natasha would say, like he’s trying to impress Steve.  Which, if it’s true, Steve has to admit he’s rather fond of that particular thought.
"Ah huh," said Sam. "And… is there any specific reason for this hobbit-like behaviour? I mean, I know it's not unusual for guys like you and Bucky to eat full meals every hour on the hour, but… something tells me that there's something more going on here."
Uncle Bucky was quiet for several heartbeats, his head hung so that his cheekbone-length hair covered quite a bit of his face. He hadn't gotten a haircut since his accident, and Peter had to admit that he kinda liked Uncle Bucky's longer hair. It made him look fierce. Almost dangerous, in a cool kind of way.
"Steve?" Tony said, tugging on Steve's hand when he didn't answer. "I may be a lot of things, but I'm not exactly telepathic. Or at least not yet."
“Good.”  Tony sat down at his desk, hoping Obie would take the hint and leave.  When at least ten seconds had passed and he didn't, Tony cleared his throat.
There were plenty of men who had endured being held prisoner during the war, and if they could survive it, then so could he.
"What?" exclaimed Tony. "That's all you can say? That after all these years we're supposed to just blindly trust you to not fuck up the most important thing you've ever done in your entire life?"
Reluctantly, Steve released Tony, watching as he headed over to regroup with James, Sam, Quill, and Carol, who had just landed underneath the wizards' protective umbrella. Ever since her rather dramatic arrival, Thanos seemed to have given up on trying to summon more of his massive ships through the wormhole.
Tony flinched at the mention of Steve, and he grabbed onto the back of the couch, trying to keep himself from tipping over.
Tony whips his head around, his brown eyes so full of hurt and remorse that Steve can’t hide his sharp intake of breath, guilt hitting him like a blast to the chest.
Tony let out a rather raspy sigh, clearing his throat as he cradled Steve's hand between his own. "Steve, honey, I've told you. I don't get sick. It's been at least three years since I've had anything more than a head cold, and even that was only for a day or so. So I don't think you need to be worrying about me."
"Okay, okay," Tony said carefully as he crouched down, looking up at the obviously disturbed wizard. "You're back now. You're all right."
"Yeah, okay." Tony jumped as yet another barrage of machine gun fire erupted from the speaker, followed directly by an ear-splitting
Tony was just beginning to stir when Steve got to the bedroom, opening one sleepy eye as Steve stripped out of his sweaty running clothes.
"Good day, Mr Stark," a voice suddenly said, one that caused Tony to gasp so loudly that he flinched. "How may I be of assistance?"
"Barbaric?" Steve said bitterly. "Yeah, I agree." He dropped his chin to his chest, shaking his head. "The government hadn't even figured out the power outages yet, but they still didn't think twice about trying to kick us out. If it hadn't been for Bucky and his family, I'm not sure what Ma would've done."
“Yeah, Dad, I do,” Peter said quietly.  He tipped his head back against his locker, squeezing his eyes closed as he tried to think of what to say next that wasn't just another whiny complaint.  “I just…”
Which meant that someone else, someone likely affiliated with either the government or HYDRA, now had a complete schematic of one of Tony's Iron Legion suits, and while whoever it was likely wouldn't have the proper materials to build one of their own that was actually functional, that didn't mean that they wouldn't try.
"Hey, guys," Sam said, a rather disgruntled look on his face. "Which one of you taught that kid of yours how to play chess, hmm?"
“Okay.  And you just didn't tell me about this… why, exactly?” Tony asked.  “What about all the people we’ve got working in that division?”
All of which had worked perfectly, of course. And as long as Phillips gave the approval—which Tony couldn't imagine why he wouldn't—Tony would soon be able to upload JARVIS into the mainframes of each of the three space-capable X-302s and have him take over about ninety percent of the calculations the pilots would've been responsible for. The pilots would still have override authority, in the event that for some weird reason they believed that JARVIS did or tried to do something incorrectly, but in all the numerous simulations that Tony had performed on his matrix, JARVIS hadn't shown one single mistake.
Steve trailed his palms up and down Tony's back as they rode up to the paediatric floor, his lips brushing across the soft skin of Tony's neck. Tony had spoken less than three words since Colonel Phillips's bombshell announcement, but Steve could hear his thoughts as if they were being broadcasted country-wide, draping yet another leaden veil of guilt across Steve's shoulders. After Howard's announcement that he was prepared to administer the only remaining dose of the Project Rebirth serum to Peter, he had also informed Steve and Tony that the reason for Peter's sudden downhill spiral was because he was the person responsible for reconstructing JARVIS.
Tony did at least get the chance to speak to Peter a few times per day, and was even able to link Peter in to talk to Steve twice, the changes in Peter's tone and energy level obvious after only a minute or so. Peter loved his papa immensely, and Tony adored the preciousness of their relationship.
"Yes, well, we need to be heading back to the precinct now," Stacy said firmly, shooting Steve a rather apologetic look. "Have a nice day, Captain, Mr Stark."
"Really?" Rogers said on a gasp. A wide smile stretched across his gorgeous full lips, the little crinkles by his eyes only enhancing his overall hotness factor. "Oh, that's great! Um… would tomorrow night work? I could grab us something and pick you up here at 2100, if that's okay?"
It was too much for Tony to even contemplate. Even now, wrapped tightly in his husband's arms with Steve's strong heartbeat beneath his ear, there was a tiny part of him that still believed that all of this was just one big, elaborate dream, and that someday he would simply wake up and it would all be gone. That the last four-plus years since Steve found he and Peter near death in the middle of the Afghanistan desert had all been nothing more than something he had made up in his overactive imagination.
"Ah ha ha ha," Tony said as he took Steve's arm, guiding him over to the very edge of the Asgardian army. Thanks to Carol's dramatic arrival, Thanos' side seemed to be in a regrouping phase, which suited Tony just fine. He could use a few seconds to breathe.
Thankfully, it didn't take long for Tony's body to relax and his breathing to even out. Letting out a slow sigh of relief, Steve pressed another kiss to the top of Tony's head and closed his eyes, willing himself to think of something—anything—else besides his fateful flight into the ice.
"Tony, please talk to me," Steve whispered into the semi-darkness of Peter's room. Peter had fallen asleep not too long after Helen had gotten him fixed up and he'd had something to eat, but it was a very fitful sleep, filled with whimpers and jerks and the occasional cry for help that if Steve hadn't been there along with him, Tony wasn't sure if he'd be able to handle it. He had been trying to project the façade that he was perfectly fine for so long while Steve had been wrestling with his own demons, that now he was afraid if he let his guard down for even a second, he would just collapse into a huge puddle of goo.
Still remember the exact moment when he realised he could no longer hold his breath, and was forced to give in.
"Hey, buddy!" Dad said from the screen, with Papa sitting next to him in what looked like Dad's lab in their Compound apartment. "You doing okay?"
"Well, 'cause there's nothing there," Gwen said. She turned the screen towards Tony, which showed nothing but ocean waves crashing against a rocky shoreline. "According to your JARVIS these are the exact coordinates that Peter transferred to his phone, but unless I'm missing something, I can't see anything there."
"Well, I can't promise anything," Sam said with wide eyes. "That'll depend on how much this one ends up pissing me off."
"Talk to me, honey, please," Tony whispered as he brushed Steve's sweaty hair off his forehead. "Trying to bottle it all up inside never works, you know that."
Both Dad and Papa turned to look at him, their expressions the exact same mix of pride and anguish. Papa scrubbed a palm down his face as he dropped to his knees in front of Peter, gathering him into his arms and burying his nose into Peter's hair. He reached a hand behind him which Dad promptly took, allowing Papa to tuck him in close too.
"You guys go ahead, I'll meet you back at the jet," Steve said as he reached for his phone. "I just need—"
There simply was no other explanation. No other way Steve could explain the appearance of the portals, or the anticipation this universe's Steve and Tony had felt while waiting for Peter to arrive.
"With the idea to use the system as an energy source, yeah," Tony said proudly. "Howard, he was running experiments on this device back in the day so I know it exists, and I've studied as much about it as I can possibly study so I know that Pete's right. This would end the war."
"Do you know how long Peter was submerged, Captain?" Dr Cho asked as she activated a warming blanket, covering Peter's lower body up to his chest.
"Yeah, well, I'm afraid you might've just woken Peter up with that landing," Steve said, trying to reign in his impatience. With their soundproofed bedroom there was a chance that Tony hadn't heard anything, but Steve knew Peter was a lost cause. His enhanced hearing combined with the fact that he never completely closed his bedroom door would no doubt have him running onto the landing pad in five… four… three… two…
"Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me, 'cause I don't like fish either," Peter whispered back. "Well, at least I don't like eating them. I like watching mine swim around in his tank though."
“Nah, Papa, I don't believe that,” Peter said.  “You had it in you all along.  All Dad and I did was show you where it was hiding.”
Carefully, so as not to disturb his sleeping husband, Tony lifted his head, blinking as he took in the sheer gorgeousness that was his Steve. His adorably mussed blond hair, softer than silk. His strong arms, the right curled around Tony's waist and the left resting on his pillow, bent up over his head. His smooth, broad chest and deliciously defined abs that disappeared under the thin, silky bed linens.
And he did. Tony loved Steve more than he ever thought he was capable of loving another person besides Peter, and all he wanted was to be able to give his beloved the peace that he so desperately sought, that
"JARVIS, can you please open a Russian/ English dictionary on my tablet?" he asked as he started typing, hoping that any typos he made wouldn't be enough to skew the results.
"For all we know, she's already fighting some other battle on some other planet," said Tony. He dragged his gaze over to Bruce, raising an eyebrow. "Think you can get the other guy to show up, like Steve saw? Seems like him and the giant bug man were working pretty well together."
"Oh!" Antennae Lady said, still struggling against her web cage. "You're the ones Thor told us about!"
“Okay,” Peter says.  Placing the lenses against his eyes, he yanks on the rubber strap to bring it over his head, and immediately flinches in pain as the strap snaps right back against his fingers.
But that was okay.  At the moment, Tony was content to just hold his man close.  Steve would let him know when he was ready for sex again.
He managed to make it through the rest of his classes and Decathlon practise without further incident, although it took nearly every ounce of his strength to avoid launching his pen at Mr Harrington when he tried to give the team a pep talk towards the end. Peter was so used to his papa's amazing and inspiring pep talks that while he was sure Mr Harrington meant well, there was just no way that he could compare when all he could talk about were students puking before the competition.
"Can you please start compiling a list of any possible suppliers or producers of materials that could be used to construct an armoured suit similar to the Iron Legion?"
But around twenty minutes later, as he held his sleeping husband in his arms, Steve could tell that the dam he'd built to hold back his ever-growing river of fear was already starting to leak. Tony's dreams of losing his family—of losing
"Damn it," he rasped into his polar bear's neck. He took off his glasses, rubbing at his scratchy eyes and trying to keep the tears from falling. He had been crying so much lately that it was starting to get embarrassing.
"Not anymore," Steve whispered as he replaced his phone. Then he leaned down, pressing kisses to both of their cheeks before tucking the blankets up over Peter's shoulder and settling back into his chair, his heart even more full than his stomach.
how cold his hands and feet always were, and the way the oxygen tubes rubbed the inside of his nose until it was raw, and the tape that made his skin itch where it covered all of his intravenous lines, and the fact that he could barely sit up without feeling dizzy, and—
"At least two more," said Thor. "The Space Stone or tesseract, which is currently well-hidden within New Asgard, and the Soul Stone, located in Wakanda."
Ruby tried to resist rolling her eyes from hearing The Voice again. She really can't fathom how she's going insane to the point that her own thoughts were having a voice of its own. Despite not liking the fact that she was hearing a voice in her head, Ruby still followed its advice.
She wasn't fully prepared to be webbed against the back of a door that slammed shut as quickly as she opened it. "What the hell!"
"It was there already so might as well start it, you know?" Tony said, not looking up Steve even when he felt their shoulders touch when he stood next to him. "Plus, I want to tell Ruby that she'll be going to college."
All of which just made Peter's own feelings of frustration and helplessness that much worse. He could help, he knew that he could. He was so much more than just some scrawny kid who was afraid of his own shadow, as that asshole Rumlow had so bluntly put it. He was Spider-Man. Even if he had to keep it a secret.
“Oh God,” Steve rasps, shuddering as he swipes his sleeve across his mouth.  Ever since he was a kid, he’s always hated vomiting with the fiery passion of a thousand suns, and apparently that hasn’t changed in the slightest since SHIELD defrosted him.
“Yeah, Cap, about that,” Tony says, looking rather sheepish as he scratches at the back of his neck.
"While he was sitting a hundred metres away all by himself in the dark," Steve finished. He reached for his aftershave, dabbing a couple drops on his cheeks and chin. "'Cept he was in the right place and you weren't."
Again, Tony paused, his eyes never leaving Obie’s face as Obie’s eyes flicked over to Bucky, and the empty left sleeve hanging from his uniform jacket, before returning to Tony.
"I'll let you know what Bruce and I come up with once we have a chance to take a look at his stuff, okay?" said Tony as he headed for the door. His patience with Nick Fury usually bordered on nonexistent, and he and Steve really did need to get going.
And of course, at the end of the night, once all the gifts had been opened and the enormous Christmas dinner had been eaten and all the games had been played, Tony and Steve had tucked Peter into bed and retreated to their own suite. Christmas marked the anniversary of their first night spent together, and they celebrated it by making love until the very wee hours of the morning, just like they had four years ago. They had even slept in the nude afterwards, something they usually only reserved for getaways when Peter wasn't with them.
"Me either," Steve said. He pressed a kiss to the top of Tony's head before releasing him and holding out his arm. "Shall we?"
"Yeah, bud," Dad said as he sat down on Peter's bed, leaning down to kiss his forehead. "Wow, handsome boy. Did you get a haircut today or something?"
Steve sputtered out a laugh, very grateful that he hadn't caught Tony on one of his really bad days.
"As he should," answered Steve. "I know he managed to get me completely hooked after only a single conversation."
No longer at all cold, Peter turned back to his panel just as the ship veered to the right so sharply that he nearly tipped over. Dad grabbed onto Peter's arm to stabilise him, glancing down at him in alarm as he checked over the instruments.
Colonel Phillips smirked. "Mmm, or something like that. In fact, I had one of my intelligence boys pull some files from a Meridian scientific database just a few hours ago. Apparently someone over there—"
"Ah huh," Dad said warily. "Except if Stacy's friend knew that information then it probably means that he's another HYDRA agent, which also means that Stacy could be a HYDRA agent, which means that—"
"But Peter doesn't, Tony!" Steve insisted. "He just doesn't, and especially not like this, so something must've happened that lured him out here!"
"Okay, um…" Peter gasped. He quickly scanned the area for a shortcut and took off running, hoping to cut the van off in the next neighbourhood.
At the moment, Tony honestly couldn't trust himself to answer that question.  Not while his precious son was sitting in the living room, nursing both a broken finger and a broken heart.
Grandma patted his shoulder. "It's not a problem at all, dear. Now, I think we have about fifteen minutes before we're due to begin. Do you still have your papa's ring?"
"Okay, what're we missing here?" Tony asked from his spot cross-legged on the floor of the lab, the blue holographic image of the time-space GPS he'd constructed, or compass, according to Steve, hanging in the air above his head. He let out a sigh as he raised his arms up over his head, tipping his head from side to side to try and stretch out his aching shoulder and back muscles. He would definitely have to take Steve up on his offer for a backrub later.
It was all way too eerily familiar, and the fact that Steve had nearly had to deck Bucky to get him to calm down a bit wasn't lost on him either. Bucky had been doing remarkably well ever since they'd managed to remove his Winter Soldier programming, and his relationship with Sam was even stronger evidence of his recovery. But Steve knew that just like him and Tony, Bucky still had his limits. And anytime some enemy of the Avengers decided to skip over all of them and go after Peter, that was when all of Bucky's repressed anger and resentment tended to come out.
There was a short pause as the other Winter Soldiers discussed what to do, with one of them finally stepping out of sight. Steve watched him go, his heart sinking as he realised what was about to happen.
There was a pause while Tony contemplated Gamora's words, trying to force his muddled mind to think rationally. Obviously Thanos hadn't tried to kill Gamora and Quill and their two weird compatriots or they wouldn't be standing there. But the big question was why.
"Master Peter is sleeping comfortably, Captain," answered JARVIS. "All vital signs are within his normal parameters."
"If Thanos was so pissed off at the Avengers, then why the hell didn't he just attack us? Why attack all of Earth?"
Peter waved as Papa exited the parking lot, then went inside, dodging the boisterous upperclassmen as he headed for his locker which was thankfully in the same hallway as it had been the previous year. He had just managed to get it unlocked and opened when Ned suddenly appeared behind him, shoving a magazine right in front of his nose.
"Oh, thank you," Steve whispered as he pulled her into a tight hug. "Tony will be so happy to hear that."
Except the anticipation of seeing the Starks again, which since around three o’clock has pretty much been all-consuming.
"More like a place to stay forever," Tony said, rather grimly. "With a premature attempt you'd still have a chance—depending on your angle of re-entry—of surviving the trip due to the heat shield. But if you end up skipping off the atmosphere and careen off into open space, well… unfortunately, there wouldn't be much of anything we could do about it."
"Can't sleep. I guess saving a girl from the hands of Hydra pulls on my heartstrings I didn't even know I had." Tony spent yesterday night in his workshop ordering clothes and whatever stuff teenagers need.
Overwhelmed with joy, she pulled herself up from the grass where she was lying down and frantically hoped that Infinity would call out again. Her prayers were answered when she heard her silky voice softly whispering her name.
Luke, as what the man preferred to be call, insisted that he accompany her to her lesson much to Ruby's dismay. With tension in the air that Ruby didn't really know where it was coming from, the three minute walk seemed like forever. She couldn't be more thankful when they finally reached the room and the man left her standing next to door after telling her to feel free about approaching him if she needed help or anything.
“Alright, first things first, son. This is not your fault.” Steve clarified as he placed a comforting hand on the boy’s shoulder. “You couldn’t have known. She decided to go back home by herself and something happened. It was no one’s fault. alright?” Peter nodded at the Captain’s words even though he didn’t believe them. However, now is not the time to play the blaming game.
"I thought… you were lying on the floor dying?" Peter answered as he shrugged his shoulders because technically, that was what it looked like from his perspective. Ruby was lying on her left side, head cushioned against her arm while her waist was twisted so that the lower part of her body laid flat on the floor. Sleeping wasn't really the first thing that came into Peter's mind, sue him.
They were having take - away Chinese food for dinner at the moment. Apparently, Tony broke the stove earlier this afternoon and he couldn't be bothered to fix it today. Clint and Natasha had come back home from California who both had a lot to say about the things they've done together but were still insistent on denying that they were dating. Ruby honestly didn't know why they both glare at anyone who even dare suggest the idea.
Ruby couldn't remember the last time she felt so free like this, smiling to the point that she would almost rip her cheeks. The rush of adrenaline made her forget every single worry she had in the world. Right now, all she was focused on was the combined sound of their gasping breaths and the excited thumps of their feet.
Everything that had happened to her, from the kidnapping to being rescued had come back to her these past few days. Perhaps, what triggered this was the sudden realisation that she has seen and been through some shit, yet here she was.
"I bet your drug hasn't affected my ability to spit on your face." Mr O'malley's expression contorted in fury as Ruby's saliva made contact with the centre of his face. Damn if she was spitting at the face of her school principal. She knew all along that there was something wrong with this man.
Her clothes was torn as if it was clawed into shreds, yet Steve could not discern a single wound. If the symbiote did manage to slash Ruby and she healed perfectly in the matter of minutes that it took them to get here, then her abilities might have been more advanced than they thought. Even with the serum, Steve and Bucky couldn't heal as fast as this.
Not in a million years would he have expected that Mordo had been possessed by Eternity himself. Stephen didn’t know about it until he sensed a strong pull of mystic energy from a spell being incanted involving the demon dimension and immediately transported himself to the Avengers Tower to warn his fellow heroes.
Silence enveloped Ruby as she followed the Voice's order. She found herself back to the dystopian field in her dream. Just like before, a female entity blazing with magnificence and underlying mystery was in the middle of the field, a few metres away from where she was standing. Her face was all but a blur and Ruby could see her hand extended towards her direction, beckoning her to come to her. With a new found feeling of certitude, Ruby closed the distance between them. Her hand reached out to the Woman's outstretched hand.
"Who are you? Why are you in Mr. Stark's room?" A guy asked accusingly. His face was covered with a loose Spider Man mask which didn't really match the rest of his outfit: a lord of the rings hoodie and ripped jeans.
Even then, Ruby swallowed the lump in her throat and lied, "It was nice meeting you as well, Mr O'malley."
The gloved hand caging her face released its grip only to backhand her face so hard. It was loaded with so much force that she felt the skin of her left cheek peel off. She screamed but she didn’t get the time to recover because Mordo kneed her stomach, hastily knocking the breath out of her. Again and again, the man kicked, punched and slashed. Most of them landed on raw flesh and Ruby couldn’t take the pain anymore.
That was how Ruby ended up showing Wanda all of the things she could do. From healing wounds, to moving things with her mind. They even found out that she was capable of making portals as well, "Just like Doctor Strange", as Wanda said. Tony absolutely denied that he screamed like a little girl when Ruby appeared next to him in his lab. He didn't have to know that it was a mistake though. Ruby actually intended to try portalling herself to her bedroom, but she didn't have much control yet and so she ended up in several places before actually locating her original destination.
look as he give him a speech about the immorality of slapping a lady, while Bucky shake his head in disapproval behind Cap and Mr Stark telling him to go to his lab afterwards.
Bucky sat down in front of her and slid a plate of chicken sandwich. He gestured for her to eat and Ruby didn't hesitate to dig in especially after hearing her stomach grumble. She wasn't actually supposed to eat solid food yet but Steve nor Tony wasn't here and Bucky didn't know about that.
Ruby witnessed another creature tackle the monster away from her, stumbling through the road in an attempt to dismember each other. The newly arrived one was similar in biology but it was black and was a tad bit smaller compared to the one that was going to kill her just a minute ago.
"How about Gaylord?" Ruby said with a dramatic hair flick but Spidey just gave her an unamused stare. This is probably what Tony felt when he himself asked him stupid questions like this.
After settling Ruby in, Tony disengaged his armour and walked towards Stephen who offered his hand for greeting.
"Morning, Steve." Ruby greeted, craning her neck back to look at him. She smiled and placed a plate of waffle topped with
As soon as the quinjet landed on the SHIELD headquarters, Tony and Natasha went straight to Fury for a mission debrief and report. Steve, who did not feel up to fighting Fury about their decision, just went to the med bay to take the girl for a check-up.
She told him a million times that she didn't do well with heights but Ruby now knew that Tony did not have a single nerve of empathy in his body going by the way his grin went even wider when she told him about her fear.
"Ow, ow, ow. Okay! Jesus Christ, Nat."  She released his arm from her grip  once she was content that Clint wouldn't try to steal anything away, "Those are for Bucky. Wait for yours."
Tony pushed his thoughts aside for now, though. The kid finally emerged from her room and he didn't want to ruin it. Especially when he saw how much she was laughing together with Natasha earlier.
"You want to train with me, Ruby?" Steve offered. She's never really properly trained with Steve. Not because she was afraid, but because Steve was such a slave driver. It may look like he's America's sweet angel with those big blue eyes and shining blonde hair, but don't let them deceive you. The last time she trained with him, Steve made her do three extra sets of strength exercises on top of her two. When she voiced out her complaint, he simply said,
"Thank you." Ruby said, her voice muffled since her face was still plastered against Steve's chest. She didn't know if she'll ever feel safe again, but wrapped in Steve's arms like this, it was as if she had her father again.
"I said shut up!" Ruby didn't realise that she shouted that out loud until both Natasha and Spidey were both looking at her like she's gone crazy. The steel spatula she was using to mix more icing was split in half with how hard she squeezed it.
"Then, this man dressed in a black combat uniform told my dad that we needed to come with him. I couldn't remember why but all I know was that once he led us away from the public, more men came out. Three of them tied me all up, hands and feet, while I was kicking and screaming. The rest of them took hold of my parents. I saw my dad fighting but there were too many of them, you know?" Ruby wiped the single tear that ran down her cheek with the back of her hand, before turning her face to look at both men.
"I slapped you on the cheek because you wouldn't stir. Be thankful I didn't splash you with cold water." Natasha flatly said after taking a sip of her hot chocolate. If somebody could pull off a scary look while being cute at the same time, it would be Natasha.
"V? Are you there?" Ruby asked out loud. She looked up at the ceiling lamp as she rubbed her calf against her comforter, sighing at its softness. She wondered whether the Voice would tell her what her name was anytime sooner. Ruby thought it was only fair. The Voice seemed to know everything there was to know about her yet Ruby was still completely baffled by just her mere existence.
"Hey, everything's alright now." Steve murmured into her ear while he pulled her to his chest, the strong stench of copper filled his nose. He frowned and looked down.
“Her pulse is stable. No open wounds. No visible physical trauma. Looks like Ruby is perfectly in good condition.”
Once again, Ruby found herself staring at her reflection in the mirror. Her eyes searched for the golden fire it had but they were back to her pale blue ones. She had half a mind to question if what happened really happened but the Voice was there in the back of her mind. A constant and reassuring presence to remind her of what she could do.
He was sat on a chair in between the two beds, waiting for either of them to wake up just so he could grill the dumbasses for being such dumbasses.
Ruby never agreed so fast to anything throughout the whole 18 years of her existence. At least with Steve and Mr Stark, she knew she was safe. These were the people who saved her, after all.
It wasn't like it's a big deal that Ruby knew his name. He would have just preferred it if he could have known her better in time before introducing his secret identity. There's a lot of Peters out there after all.
A few seconds in, Ruby came barging with panic-stricken eyes searching for Steve. Right then, Tony realised just how young the girl was.
The two did not waste any more time and rushed to the elevator but just as soon as they stepped foot out of the library, they saw a pair of angry faces in the hallway. The captain may look calm but underneath his furrowed brows, Peter could see the fury in his eyes and while Mr Stark may look composed and collected, the tight clench of his jaw did not go unnoticeable.
"You do know you have access codes to the workshop, right?" Tony said before dropping his attention back to what he was doing. He really found Steve's current bedhead paired with a shirt two sizes smaller to be very dangerous.
A startling alarm suddenly blared through 20 minutes after Peter just left the tower. Ruby was so confused to see everyone rushing through the elevator. Their stance and posture were rigid and screamed of practiced discipline. With no clue of what to do, Ruby just followed them in.
Her breathing turned more erratic when she clutched down the ground, burying her head in between her knees as she tried to zone out the harsh noises inhabiting the place.
"She looks so young." Steve commented once the adrenaline of the team went down and the quinjet was 15 miles away from the facility. He and Tony were sitting opposite from each other; the girl still passed out on a stretcher in between them.
Peter's sweet brown eyes briefly locked with Steve's, and he gave him a stuttered nod. "Uh—uh huh, Papa."
"All right, sounds easy enough," Tony said. He pointed to a small structure on the tablet, about twenty-five metres or so away from the entrance and slightly off to the side. "Looks like this used to be another guard tower?"
"Given the parameters set forth by Master Peter, I have calculated a ninety-seven point three five percent of success," answered JARVIS. "At the moment the only limiting factors are the collection of the necessary components—"
the goddamn time to be starting that argument again, especially when you can't even walk!" Tony snapped back. "Now, get into bed, soldier, and that's an order!"
"I know. And that's okay," Steve said with a nod. At the moment, he honestly didn't care how long it took if it meant they could get their son back. "I'll… I can be patient."
"And you're worried there'll be another attack before he's able to get anywhere," finished Peter. "'Cause it's the government."
"Uhh, what the hell?" Tony said as he slowly lowered his hand. "You're one seriously loyal piece of outerwear, aren't you?"
Tony groaned in frustration, tossing a sharp glance at Steve over his shoulder. "Goddamn stubborn soldier."
"I agree," said Steve. "But Tony's right, it's really the only way to stop it. Otherwise this could just go on forever."
Dr Cho gave a heavy sigh. "Yes, Captain, it was a blow," she said gently. "But try and remember, Peter has a healing factor that's equal or even stronger than yours, and he was able to previously heal from an even worse injury with no apparent lingering effects. We just have to give him time."
"Really?" Tony asked, wrinkling his nose. Even after over three years together, he still wasn't quite used to the compliments that Steve showered him with on a daily basis. He had quite a bit of experience with flattery, both somewhat sincere and some not-so-much, especially during his playboy days before Peter came along, but he'd never really experienced much in the way of being complimented.
As the announcer begins to introduce the eight swimmers that comprise the final of the one-hundred metre freestyle, Steve presses down on his swim cap and adjusts his goggles, ensuring they’re sufficiently suctioned to his face.  One of the swimmers in his semi-final heat had the unfortunate luck of having to swim his race with his goggles around his mouth, and while Steve hasn't had that happen to him since he was in junior high, he is taking no chances.
"I won't be," Steve cut in. "Not till—" He broke off, cradling Peter's hand between his own. "I can't—I can't leave him, Nat. Not while… he's like this. I just—I need to be here when he wakes up."
"Mmm, yeah," Scott said, nearly swooning as he chewed his huge mouthful of banana. Then he popped the cap on his water bottle, downing nearly half of it before swiping his wrist across his mouth. "Whoa. I feel so much better now."
A soft smile lit up Tony’s beautiful face, and he pressed a kiss to the tip of Steve’s nose.  “Well, you are that,” he murmured.  “And I fucking love you.”
"Aww, honey," Tony murmured against his chest. His calloused palms slipped underneath Steve's shirt to glide up his back, sending ribbons of warmth shooting throughout Steve's body. "You know you can always get me to do anything when you start talking like that."
”Oh, yeah!” Peter says emphatically.  “I watched all of ‘em!”  He starts to add that he’s sorry Mr Rogers lost in his last race, but then decides against it.
"No, Bruce mentioned something else that he needed to do for Director Fury at three today," Papa said, checking his watch. "But I'd bet that Dad will still be in the lab when we get back, so you can ask him all about it." He paused, halting Peter before he could climb into the truck. "Just remember, little guy, we can't say anything about any of this, okay? The news people have already caused enough of a panic about a possible space attack, and we don't want to be adding to it until we know what's going on."
"All right," said Papa as an alien jumped off one of the Chitauri's speeders and landed next to Thanos, one who just happened to look exactly like the guy who had tried to take the Time Stone from Dr Strange.
Too frozen to move, Tony could only stare at Fury’s face, his heart thudding as he waited for Fury to tell him he was joking.
me, they would immediately run for the mountains and never look back. And I liked to use the excuse that I did it to protect my son, but what I was really doing was just reinforcing the walls that I'd so masterfully built around my heart. Walls that you then managed to completely tear down with just a few kind words and a couple flashes of that sexy-as-hell dimple."
“All calls from the office are blocked as of right now, buddy,” Dad cut in.  He clapped a hand onto Peter’s shoulder as they stepped into their private elevator.  “Except for Pepper, okay?  I promised it was just gonna be you and me this weekend, and I intend to make good on that promise.”
“I knew it!” he exclaims, so loudly that a woman at a nearby table turns to look at him.  “Oh, I just
Over the last four years, Steve had managed to work his way into Tony's very soul, taking his place right next to Peter. And to lose either of them would completely destroy him.
Sweat beaded across Steve’s forehead as he hiked up a small incline on the road, if one could call the narrow, rocky, evergreen-lined path he was currently following an actual road.  He grimaced as his foot slipped on a particularly icy spot, pausing to glance up at the position of the sun as he tried to estimate how much longer he had before he arrived at the coordinates given to him by Brock Rumlow, the leader of the STRIKE team.
"Thor showed up at the last minute with some information that we'll need to share with the Wakandan prince," answered Steve. "Do you have any new intel for us?"
"Okay, then if that's the case where does all of 'our' money go, hmm?" asked Sam. "'Cause I sure as hell don't see most of it. In fact—"
"Well, I'm not sure if 'interrogate' is the word I would use, but yes, we do have some questions for him," Papa said firmly. "Mainly, why he felt the need to try and break into our home rather than simply ask us for help."
But with no other visible doors or exits he couldn't figure how it would be possible, and he couldn't remember being put in there in the first place since it was right after he'd been forced to see all of those horrible visions.
Tony's heart skittered at the fear in Steve's voice, at how defeated he sounded. He had been able to hold himself together pretty well after the committee meeting, better than Tony had, actually, but this newest revelation seemed to have tipped him right over the edge again. Speaking with the rest of the team once Peter was in bed, Steve had barely been able to keep his voice from cracking when he brought up the senate bill, something Tony knew didn't escape their teammates' notice.
Peter shrugged. "Most people don't, I s'pose. Not like the people who sell it like to broadcast that it messes up your towels."
Something about the tone of Dad's voice, the slight quiver that Peter knew that he was reigning in just for him, caused his belly to swoop in fear. Dad had already been twitchy as hell ever since the weird space thing over Wakanda, and now, after adding on Uncle Thor's proclamation of doom and yet another attack by HYDRA where Papa was almost seriously hurt, Peter was surprised that Dad could still function with how worried he was. Peter knew that he hadn't slept more than an hour or two since Papa left for Namibia, and was rapidly approaching his post-Battle of New York levels of obsession with finalising his nanite armour so he could then get started on a suit for Papa.
"Oh, no, he wasn't really mad," said Peter. "You know Uncle Clint likes to act all gruff and stuff, but he's really a big softie when it comes down to it. And Pietro and Wanda told me that he and Auntie Nat are almost as overprotective as you and Dad."
"As long as you like Steve and get along with him, I'm good," Dad added. "Yours is the only opinion that I care about."
"Tony!" she exclaimed. "I noticed Mr Beck stomping down the hall towards the elevator a few minutes ago, so I thought I'd come and see how the meeting went. I take it didn't go well?"
"Ah, nevermind," Tony said quickly. He cupped Steve's face in his hands, giving him a sweet, lingering kiss. "Let's go home, yeah?"
"And thank you, Тони," Bucky added. He got to his feet, holding Tony's gaze. "Стив is lucky to have you. For a long time, he never—he never thought that he'd—that he'd be able to have a family. You know… because—"
"No, babe, you can't go blaming yourself!" Tony protested. "There's nothing more that you could've done—"
"Yeah, I'm glad you think so," muttered Tony. He frowned as Strange picked himself up and set off down the corridor without so much as a glance back, the maroon cloak wrapping itself around his neck as he stomped away.
"All right, babe, all right," Tony said, softly sighing as he snuggled in even closer. "It's okay. We're okay. I love you."
"Oh hell yeah," said Bucky. "I mean, there's gotta come an end to the war sometime, right? Do we even know why we're still fighting?"
And now, come January, the United States was going to be under the leadership of one President Graham Cole, a candidate who ran mainly on a platform of nationalism and pride and a promise to end all domestic terrorism, which on the surface Steve supposed could be considered innocuous enough if he didn't know any better. But thanks to Tony's expert digging abilities, Steve was now well aware of President Cole's ties not only to Senator Davis, but also to several U.S.-based corporations with very wealthy executives, making his victory seem almost like it was following a well-written script for a spy movie.
"Okay, so, I designed it to work with twelve satellites," Peter began. "But we really only need eight to cover the planet. I figured the other four could be backups just in case something went wrong."
As hard as it was, Steve simply had to trust that Peter would fight just as well—or likely even better—than he did during their training sessions. He was still plenty nervous, especially since Peter was a lot like Tony out in the field, meaning that he was both constantly improvising and had a tendency to lean a bit too far towards self-sacrifice than Steve would've preferred.
, and now the calculations with which to program it, so as far as he could tell, they had all of the pieces assembled. The only remaining task was to put them together.
Strange's head snapped back in surprise. "Your son?" he asked, narrowing his eyes at Peter. "What the hell is he doing here?"
As he had painfully learned in the past four years, life was far too unpredictable to not be with the people you love.
Bucky gave a nod, sliding the glasses onto his face and leaning back against the pillows, his hands clasped tightly in his lap.
"Okay," said Gwen. "Well… will you call me if you find anything out? Please? It's not just me, my parents are worried too."
"Right now I don't give a shit what he likes and doesn't like, okay Barton?" Tony snapped. "If I'm gonna keep footing the bill for all of his goddamn toys around here, then he's just gonna have to deal with it."
A sort of bluish light swept across the lenses of the glasses as the interface connected, with Bucky immediately stiffening on the bed. Steve flinched, taking a step towards the door before Tony could grab onto his hand.
Steve sucked in a hard, shuddering breath as he lifted his head, meeting Tony's worried brown eyes that were bathed in the glow of the dim blue lights lining the perimeter of their bedroom. Tony had had the lights installed before they arrived at the Compound for the summer, after Steve confessed that he could no longer sleep in the complete darkness. With the soft glow of Tony's arc reactor now gone, the room was just too dark at night otherwise.
“You should drink a little too, Tony,” Steve adds.  “It won’t do either of us any good to get dehydrated.”
"But not one that we can rule out, I don't think," Steve said worriedly, his face pale and his voice about three octaves higher than usual. "Tony, we can't let him go to that party!"
"I'm sorry, little guy, but I'm going to have to get going now," he said. "Is it all right if I come back in a couple of days?"
The single best thing to ever happen to Tony deserved nothing but the absolute best in return.  And in order to give him that, Tony had to keep doing what he did best.
"Yes, sir, I understand that this is a pretty unique case, but—no, sir, I don't believe at all that Captain Rogers' intentions were hostile—yes, sir, I know that, but this happened almost seventy years ago, which is why I believe that the statute of limitations—yes—yes, sir. I understand, sir, thank you for your time."
"He won't be able to stay conscious," Peter whispered. "And then… even if they do figure out how to get his power back up, he won't—he won't be able to—"
Because if there was anything about Steve that Tony might've considered a flaw, it was the fact that the man seemed to wear his emotions on his sleeve. And judging by what Tony often saw in those blue eyes he could quite literally get lost in, Steve honestly cared about him.
A pharmaceutical printer certainly couldn't be as complicated to figure out as a missile, right?  And if he could get it up and running, then—
Someone that breathtaking deserved to be immortalised in as many different art forms as possible, especially when not even photographs were enough to do him justice.
“Steve, honey, it’s okay,” Dad said, over and over as Papa gasped for breath, watching his counterpart race towards the destroyed building on his injured leg, shouting the names of his teammates.  “It’s not real, try and remember, okay?  It’s just an image.  None of it’s real.  Not anymore.”
"Steve, I know Peter's gone," Natasha murmured, thick with emotion. "And there's not a single hour that goes by where I don't miss him, my sweet милая ошибка. Peter was one of the brightest lights that I've ever seen in my life, and it's just not fair that he was taken and we weren't. None of it's fair. But you also know that there is no way he would want you and Tony to go through what you're going through now. You know it, Steve. He would hate to see how much you guys are hurting."
"Oh gods, this isn't happening," Tony cried. He pressed his palm to his chest, his heart threatening to break through. "This can't be happening, Rhodey! I only talked to him a few hours ago!"
Steve blushed, looking down at his plate. "Yeah, I did think of that, but Peter seems to pretty much run the other way whenever I try and hold your hand in front of him, so I'm hoping it won't be too much of an issue."
"And as I explained to your predecessors, I felt that the Iron Legion was necessary to defend the convoys transporting artefacts from the cleanup sites from possible outside attack. However, I would not personally classify them as weapons."
"His name's Justin Hammer, and he owns a company that he likes to think is comparable to Stark Industries," he said quietly. "They manufacture tech products, gadgets and stuff, but most of his main buyers are overseas 'cause he's never been able to compete with me head-to-head. And, 'cause I had JARVIS double-check this on the way here, he also has recently landed some pretty lucrative contracts with the military to produce weapons."
"Oh, no, I would never do something to put Young Starkson in danger, Sir Buchanan," Thor said. "You have my word."
"You think Auntie Nat and Uncle Clint would feel like going too?" Tony asked. "I can arrange for one of the luxury boxes, that way there shouldn't be too much scrutiny, and—"
All that remained was for Steve to trust in his teammates, none of whom had ever come close to letting him down.
Finally, after almost three agonising days of counting and deploying and collecting evidence, the time had finally arrived for Steve to deploy and initiate the tesseract. With Carol's four satellites completed, she reentered the atmosphere to a six-aircraft escort—one of whom was Rhodey—and a hero's welcome once she touched back down onto the runway, and was now standing amongst the too-large crowd of pilots and other soldiers who had all collected inside the Control Room to witness Steve deploying the tesseract.
He had just set the suitcase down next to the doorway when he heard Peter yell for him from the living room, startling him. He wasn't used to living in a house where one could yell from room to room and still be heard.
"Judging by the displacement of the surrounding leaves and grass during the incident, it would appear to have been caused by a human," said JARVIS. "However, if that is indeed the case, he or she was too fast for me to visualise."
Tony’s fingers clenched around the handle of his mug.  His blood had been at a near boiling point ever since his conference call with the head of the Stark Relief Foundation stationed in Sokovia, when he learned that not only had their entire supply of first aid supplies been stolen yet again by one of the warring factions, one of the relief workers had been killed in the crossfire during the theft.  Tony had been just about ready to offer to send his jet in to evacuate the rest of the workers when the woman in charge informed him that in no uncertain terms was she ready to pull out of there.
"You're exhausted, sweetheart," Steve said softly. "And to be honest, so am I. I'm wondering if we shouldn't go back home and try and take a nap before you and Bruce get started."
Tony pursed his lips, wrapping his arms around his front in a vain attempt to get himself to stop shaking. He knew he should refuse, just walk out of that room and never look back. It's what a strong person would do.
"Interior could sure use a paint job or something," Tony muttered as he took another step, carefully to keep his foot from clanking against the metal floor. Tony had never been a fan of that dull, charcoal grey colour, as he'd always thought it too industrial-looking. In fact, he was fairly certain that he and Peter had even discussed that very topic a few times, coming to the conclusion that if they were ever to build a spaceship, they would paint the interior something cool, like bright blue.
"No. Never," said Steve. "So… you really think it's true, then? Pym is a scientist. Maybe he had some kind of shrinking tech or something?"
"Tony," Steve warned when Tony kissed that same spot again, smirking against Steve's jaw when he let out a soft moan. "What're you doing?"
"And you've found a spot where I can work on the containment vessel?" asked Tony. "'Cause it's not gonna be needed at all if we're only doing a weapons system, which means people are gonna wonder what the hell I'm doing if they see me building it."
Not surprisingly, Peter's girlfriend, Gwen, was waiting for him by the doors when they pulled up next to the school. Tony had told Steve that she had been instrumental in helping to narrow down the location of the hidden HYDRA bunker, managing to decipher a series of coded HYDRA files that Peter had decrypted after his disappearance during their end-of-year dance. Peter had intended to search for Steve on his own, believing that since he was the only person on the team who could see through the retro-reflective panels that lined the outside of the bunker, that he would have a better chance at infiltrating it without being discovered.
"I'm fine, Steve, just damn frustrated," Dad said shortly. "Besides, I can't really trust anyone else to do it the way I want it done, so…"
Peter Edwin Stark. The child Tony had never known that he'd needed until he had him, and now the child that Tony would do anything,
It was another thing to discover that he was going to die not because he was too far gone to save, but because there was no one who could actually save him.
"Good idea. Go," Steve said rapidly, still scanning the area. The explosions had stopped, but there was still plenty of debris falling from the crumbling building and dozens of frightened people still milling about. "Do we have fire and rescue on the way?"
"It is," agreed Steve. "And it was—it was—" He huffed out a sharp breath, shaking his head. "It was like it was happening in the here and now, but still in 1944. At the same time."
Tony had discussed the Phoenix mission with Colonel Phillips again in the days leading up to the trial mission, trying to come up with some possible way they could convince the government leaders to conduct the mission as designed by Peter. But it had all been just a massive waste of time. Phillips had gone above and beyond, likely raising suspicions and risking his own arrest as he attempted to persuade their leaders to see reason, and yet they still stuck to their notions that there could be no possibility of peace that didn't involve the complete surrender of the entire Meridian continent.
"We'll see, okay?" Steve kissed the top of Peter's head, squeezing him one final time. "I love you, Peter. I'll see you this afternoon."
Poor Peter completely misunderstood Ruby's silence. He knew all about how Ruby lost her parents. Ruby could see the moment Peter realised what he just said and his eyes widened in panic.
"Eww, Ned! I would not be blowing any body parts attached to that boy. Especially not to someone named Eugene. No thank you."
"Ruby, this is Wanda and Vision." He introduced. Ruby smiled at both their guests, despite her initial uneasiness, and held out her hand to give them a handshake. "I'm Ruby." Wanda returned her smile but tilted her head, examining the girl. Ruby didn't seem evil, but Wanda could not help but be wary. She didn't like not understanding things, and the girl right in front of her, was the epitome of inapprehensible.
"Ruby, right?" She realised that the injured man knew about her rescue. Instead of answering him, she opened the glass door and helped him lie down on the sofa. She quickly asked Friday to tell her where the nearest first aid kit is and was glad to know that she didn't have to travel many floors down just to get one.
Just like a movie, Ruby saw through her own naked eyes how the cosmic beings’ creations developed into more advanced life form.
"Hi, sorry. My friend gets tongue tied when he sees beautiful women. I'm Ned, by the way." Ned said. When a few moments of silence lapsed between them, he cleared his throat and nudged his friend's arm with his elbow.
Ruby suddenly felt a deep remorse for this. If only she has told them about her history with theme parks, then they wouldn't have to deal with taking her sorry ass back here in the med bay. God, just a day being in their custody and she's caused trouble for them already.
She was facing him. Her arm and head rested against the back cushion with her knees drawn up to her chest, feet almost touching the edge of Steve's thigh. Barely a minute have passed and Ruby's breath started to even out, an indication that she had gone back to sleep.
Natasha couldn’t stop herself from shooting the screen repeatedly. Each click against the trigger become more forceful and forceful. When she ran out of bullets, she dug her hand down her holster to grab a new magazine, but Clint took a hold of her wrist and pulled her face to his chest.
They reached the library balcony at exactly 11:16 PM. Ruby tried her luck in finding the sliding glass door open but just as expected, it was completely locked.
Steve released a breath he didn't notice he was holding in, then looked beside Tony to give him a reassuring smile.
"But Clint, come on! That one had my mask on it! That was the coolest one! Not everybody could say they ate out Spider Man!"
Ruby found Natasha's voice quite familiar. Perhaps, she was there as well when the Avengers rescued her. She wondered if these two are part of the Avengers too.
There was a fleeting moment when the thoughts of her mum and dad played in her memory, but she quickly pushed them back at the back of her mind.
ability, she also had this Voice that knew nothing about of how she could control it. Maybe this was why HYDRA had her and do all sorts of experiments with her. She couldn't really remember what happens to her after experiments because every single time, they will inject her something that would result to memory loss. The only thing she would remember was being in the Dark Room before they send her in to start an experiment.
"That's enough, servant!" A dark man clad in a long dark green cape reprimanded. Immediately, Mr O'malley dropped on the floor and kneeled. "I sincerely apologise, Master. I merely believe the girl lacked manners and needed to be disciplined."
“Ruby, holy shit. You look so damn badass like this.” Peter exclaimed excitedly before he all but dove and wrapped Ruby in her arms. He tucked his face on the crook of her shoulder, and despite the mask, Ruby could feel his breath against her neck.
Once again, Ruby's vision was filled with darkness. She felt Wanda release her head and she opened her eyes to find said woman looking at her intently with what seemed like concern and empathy in her expression.
"You never were alone in this, Tony. I'd never let you feel like that, if I could help it." Steve said worriedly, looking at him carefully. "That's how you been feeling? And you never... You never said anything. Is that what you've been trying to keep hidden from me?"
"He's not going to sleep, Steve," Tony laughed, rolling his eyes at Peter and Clint's complains, "He'll be up waiting for Santa."
TW: Tony's past, mention of past physical, mental, emotional, and sexual abuse. Mentions of alcoholism. Howard Stark.
"That's something I can be useful for. I can get things down from high places." He chuckled softly, kissing Tony's cheek.
Peter sighed and opened the door more, leaving it open as he headed over to his open books, plopping down in front of his unfinished maths.
"Hey kiddo, Papa and I are gonna spend some time together in the art room, okay?" Tony hummed, plopping a kiss on Peter's head, "We're working on a big surprise, okay?"
"I'm gonna leave my lab alone for a bit. Maybe drag mini-me up here," he murmured, putting a hand on his forehead, "Yeah, that sounds good. I haven't played with him in a while, and I should. Poor guy."
"You find it funny, but I worry I'm going to accidentally squeeze him or something." Steve whispered back, getting up to lay Sammy down. "He's so small. And it makes me wonder if he'll end up small like I was."
"You can spank me later, if you want," he breathed, "But we need to get you in the bath before you're too sore. C'mon, up."
"C'mon, let's get ready for the biggest crying fest of our lives," he sighed, "Hopefully, the last one on a road to getting better. Right?"
"He's always hungry, like someone else I know," Tony chuckled, sidling up to Steve to give him a kiss, "You told him about the tattoos?"
Steve looked back surprised. Howard Stark was the biggest name in business here in Manhattan. Who knew his soulmate would be important.
"You don't poke the big bear and not expect him to leave you be, Pete." Steve stated, settling them down in bed. "Let’s get some sleep, hm?"
"Daddyyyy," Peter grumbled from his place on Tony's chest, not opening his eyes, "Do y'hafta kiss Papa in front'a me?"
Steve carefully grabbed onto Tony's hips, pulling him slightly towards his movement as he fully pushed in.
"Get your rest, kid..." He whispered, kissing the top of Tony's head before settling in and following the man in sleep.
"Well, that would definitely cause some deep seated problems." Rhodey hummed, writing on his notes. "I know you probably won't like talking about it, but I need to know when this all began." He said carefully.
"I always thought about what it'd be like having a kid or two. A family. But that is something that can wait for us both to decide later on, yeah?" He grinned, nuzzling Tony's cheek.
, Steve. You really expect me to hold back?" Tony muttered, stroking him faster, "Once we get the squirt to Buck's, I'm totally riding your huge cock until I can't even
"And maybe add a little silhouette later," Tony muttered under his breath. He coughed, sipping at his coffee. "I know what we're doing after we paint, though," he said a bit louder.
"Well, you did have to get stitches in it, Tony." Steve said softly, carefully pressing his hand against Tony's head. "You feel a little hot. Might be from the stress on your body lately."
Peter scooted himself back in the center of the couch, sending a pout up at the two men as they laughed.
Tony nodded and nuzzled at Steve's stomach, wrapping his arms around his waist. He purred happily, leaning up into his touch.
Feeling Steve shift, Tony leaned up slightly so the blond could get out, laying back down once he was gone. Tony sighed into the comfort of the couch, gently rubbing Steve's back.
"You're such a dweeb," Tony grumbled, a grin on his lips, "Alright, alright. You can expose me to more romance-y things. But any comments over how shy I get, and I'll go abstinate for a week."
"Steve." Tony sighed, holding Steve's hand with both of his. "I love you. You can tell me anything. Whatever you're feeling, I wanna be there to support you." He kissed Steve's knuckles, standing to clear their plates. "You don't have to tell me now, if it makes you uncomfortable. But I do want to know."
"Bye, snookums," Bucky called after him, blowing kisses before dissolving into laughter, taking his place by Natasha.
"More fun. Then we can have shower sex," Tony deadpanned, tugging Steve up, "I also want to be fucked on the kitchen counters. Just sayin'."
He let his eyes shut, letting all the stress and worry from the day release from him. Tony's body fell completely lax from the mental exhaustion, the brunet falling into the deepest sleep he had in a long time.
He tossed a grin over his shoulder before rifling through their closet, humming in approval once he found the silk he was looking for.
"In here, Tony!" Steve called back with a chuckle, glazing up the ham to put in the oven. He headed over and kissed Tony and Peter in greeting, and giving Bucky a quick pat on the arm.
"I'm not terrible, and you know I'd have to later anyway," He rolled his eyes, tugging Steve back towards the stairs, "Please?"
"Okay. 3 months. 3 months, we can work with. That's a whole season." Tony sighed in relief, plopping down next to Steve on the couch with a sigh.
The boy hurriedly tore into his stocking, falling over backwards giggling to play with his new Transformer.
Stunned into silence, Tony had to take a moment to collect himself, making little disbelieving gasps. He shook his head and blinked up into the spray, sighing lightly.
"Well, at least I won't have to be worried about being far from work." Steve grinned, cleaning off his plate to put it with Tony's and started to clean up the rest. "If it’s scenic, it could be good for painting landscapes, too." He hummed, kissing Tony gently.
'I'm sorry, I just-- You've done so much for me, Tony and I wanted to show you my appreciation.' He started, shuffling his feet lightly. 'I wanted to make a nice fish meal because its something my people eat during special occasions, but I've never cooked before. I guess it was in there too long. If you don't want to eat it because I messed it up, its fi--'
"Happy Birthday!" Steve said happily, sweeping in and kissing Tony's cheek. Before he pulled away, he whispered softly in Tony's ear. "This isn't your special surprise for tonight, but it’s a main surprise--" he grinned, pulling away. "It’s your 21st, so we wanted to do something special, so why not a surprise party?"
Steve pulled Tony to him carefully, burying his face in the crook of his neck and choking back a frustrated sob.
you think you would need? No questions you need answered before I go?" Tony asked, trying to hide he was fretting over the other. "There should be enough food stocked. But would you like it all? Maybe I should leave you with some takeout numbers--"
"We're gonna pack you some stuff to be all set over at your Auntie and Uncles', okay? You're gonna visit them for a little bit, okay cutie?"
"It’s all right. It’s a mess we can clean. Besides, you made it doing something sweet, so thank you both." Steve grinned, smooching them both again with a hum.
"Or I'll tell my friend Peggy you use such words, and she'll kick your ass." Steve chuckled. "Besides, you'd enjoy too much if I spanked you." He grinned back.
He nodded softly, cuddling up to Steve until the nurse came with her chart, quickly taking Peter's blood pressure and temperature.
"Cute and manly," Tony offered, sighing happily, "Toootally manly. So manly. Like motor oil. And cars. Yep." He grinned, turning to nuzzle his face into Steve's abdomen. "Damn son," came his muffled face, "You got, like, an eighteen pack?"
"Adopted," Peter muttered, flipping over to bury his face in his pillow, "I wish yous an' Daddy never 'dopted me. At least Sammy's got
"Yes, my little pygmy goat?" Tony laughed, still holding Peter in his lap, "What's got you excited, sweetheart?"
The blond grinned, locking their door just in case and capturing Tony's lips soft and slow. He hummed the tune of 'Baby, It's Cold Outside' against them playfully as he stroked his husband's sides lovingly.
"I dunno about an army, but two or three is plenty. I mean, what if the surrogate had twins or something?" He said carefully. "Can that happen statistically?"
"No, really. Take control. Power me, Steve." Tony switched their positions, needy as he grabbed at the blond, "Please, please--"
Steve looked him over with genuine curiosity, gaze roaming specifically over the other's cock as he reached to gently stroke it.
He leaned down and smooched Steve's forehead, bustling about to pull on boxers and sweats before going to get sheets. The blond smiled softly at the way Tony was worried of him getting sick, not knowing how he would react. He could wind up a worse mother hen than Steve.
“Don't remind me." Steve chuckled gently, nuzzling gently against Tony's leg where he sat. "I may have to get up eventually, but that is not
Tony leaned against Steve's shoulder, content to watch his baby sleep away. Steve gave a quiet chuckle at that, rubbing at Tony's arm softly.
"Yeah!" Peter wiggled excitedly. "I want Sammy ta come home so's we can show him 'round da house and make 'im comfy." He said firmly.
"I already know what I'm getting you, pumpkin," Tony grinned, "I've known for a couple months. Just gotta wait for a time to smuggle it in here." Tony hummed lightly, dancing his fingers up Steve's chest. "It'd be fun if you went, though. I'd love to see that crimson blush on your face from seeing all the sex supplies."
"He told me not to be fraternizing with my boyfriend on school premises..." He hummed, looking back at Tony with false shame.
"Caught me off guard, the extent of it all. Was rough." He murmured softly. "I enjoyed it. Jus' tired now. Wore out."
"That's because Daddy up the blockage on what you search, remember?" Steve clarified. "Can't be looking up things inappropriate for you, bubba. Be it by accident or otherwise."
Steve whined slightly at the loss when Tony removed his fingers, only to wince slightly as the man slipped in.
Tony mewled, arms shaking as pleasure flowed through him, causing him to buck up into Steve's thrusts.
"You make a good point." Steve panted lightly, running a hand under Tony's shirt and along his chest. "I just want it nice and sweet. Nothing too wild. Save that for the trip."
"Ow." Steve said softly, with a slight pout. "At least I asked in a way. Instead of just shoving my tongue in there." He hummed gently.
Tony took a breath and nodded, crawling into bed and curling up to Steve's chest. He kissed his collar, tangling their legs together before settling down in the warmth.
His words were cut off when warm, slightly dry lips were pressed against his, small arms wrapping around his back and holding him closer. After the initial shock- because okay, Steve was kissing
"Well, if that true, your partner still has quite a few more moves to show you." The genius said with his signature Stark smirk, toying a bit with blond locks. "That could go well into the night, one way or the other.".
They packed early that Friday, making sure they looked presentable and didn't smell of sex before they left to head to their meeting with Sharon. They needed to make a good first impression.
"Not dat I can think of at the moment..." Peter said innocently. "Is there something you think I'm s'posed to tell you?"
Steve keened slightly as Tony slid down on top of him, hands gripping just a little more on his hips. He moaned softly at the roll of hips, rolling his back when he felt ready to continue.
"I am no devil, I assure you." Steve grinned, looking to Tony. "Dinner's finished if you wanna wake up the munchkin?"
"Sorry. I totally forgot about the cuffs." Steve admitted sheepishly. "Sorry about that. But yeah, it’s okay to let others do for you sometimes. Take the reins a little bit. "I'm still working on that, myself. But I've been getting better about it."
"Fuck," he whispered, visibly shaking as he pulled out and dropped down on the bed, clearly exhausted.
"I gotcha, baby. I gotcha." He grunted, giving a slow thrust up and lightly pushing Tony's hips down as he started up a slow rhythm.
"Can you believe Sammy will be five months soon?" He mumbled, nosing at Steve's collar, "Time flies..."
"Mhm. Shh. I know, I'm sorry I woke you, Papa needs you," Tony whispered to Peter, "He think you're getting old, pipsqueak."
"Yessir, good f'you, sir," Tony mumbled in a daze, panting softly into the comforter, "I can take more, promise, I don' wanna sit for weeks, wanna feel you in me,
"See? You're safe and warm with us, Petey," Tony soothed, rubbing his back, "Even Sammy's worried over you, sweetie. You're okay, shhh."
"C'mere, Petey." Steve said carefully, scooping the boy up carefully and laying him in bed. He tucked the boy in and gave him his teddy.
to. I dunno, it's dumb, don't listen to me," Tony muttered, still staring at the floor, "I'm gonna go put on real pants, be right back."
Sammy looked around curiously, making a confused noise until Tony tickled lightly at his tummy. The baby laughed happily, giving a big, toothless smile.
"Of course I'd like more than a date. After all the planning you've done? Wouldn't let that go to waste." Steve hummed sweetly, a grin on his face as he enjoyed even just the cuddling. It was quiet and relaxing.
Peter looked up at the doctor slowly, giving a half shrug. "Shrimps made me go into anafi-- an-- 'm allergics..." He murmured.
Peter let out a quiet whine as he was put over Tony's lap, grabbing his pillow tight and tears forming at the corners of his eyes. He didn't even answer vocally, just nodded into his pillow as he prepared for the spanking. Tony quickly placed six even smacks on Peter's behind, helping him up once he was done.
"Do you? I think you can come from me just doing this," Tony hummed back, now scraping his nails, "Think you can do that? Make a mess, babe."
He waited to feel Steve soften before pulling off, turning around before he could see the trickle running down his leg. Steve panted, looking to Tony softly with a small look of concern on his face.
“I have no problem with it if Steve’s fine with company,” Bruce answered with a nod, assuring the brunet “You can stay as long as you’d like, Bucky.”
Tony kissed his merman's lips once more briefly before unsaddling himself from over Steve, helping the blond off the couch and leading him towards the guest room Steve had been staying in.
"Tony." Steve said assertively, grabbing the sides of Tony's face and making his lips pucker comical. "Just calm down." Steve said calmly. "Don't think for a minute or so and just listen, okay?".
"Its definitely weird to here that mermaids are definitely not the stretch of imagination in this film." Tony chuckled, urging Steve to continue. "So whats on your mind?"
"I'll take that as a yes?" Steve chuckled into Tony's ear. It was filled with such joy and warmed Tony from the inside out. Tony just hugged him tighter and whispered back with a large smile on his face.
"A-ah, Steve--" Tony's groans turned into laughter and a sharp gasp, making sure his head was off to the side when he sat up.
"Definitely naptime. A little bit after gifts. You need sleep, bubba." Steve explained, carting the boy downstairs with them.
"You're still a guard, right?" Tony yawned, "That's hot. I bet you look fine in a uniform." He grinned and nuzzled Steve's chest.
Steve had tried to text Tony a few times, but Tony hasn't ever bothered to check them. It physically hurt him that he was avoiding Steve, but Tony kept telling himself that he would get over it eventually. Here he was now, a week or so later, near semester end and he wasn't over it. So Tony just tried his best to cope with it by starting up his packing that afternoon. What a way to spend a birthday, packing things to leave and avoiding your one best friend you've had in a really long time.
"Yes, then you can give Daddy his shark. And we can all cuddle with our animals." Steve smiled as they pulled into the garage.
"Holy shit, Steve, holy shit," Tony whispered, "I--I mean, Sir--" He whimpered, stepping out of his jeans and tossing his own shirt aside before going down on his knees, staring open-mouthed at Steve.
"Correct. You like what you see, Tony?" He chuckled playfully, picking gently at a bow in the front. "When was the Declaration of Independence signed?"
"Happy Birthday, by the way." He whispered sweetly before pulling away and stripping down to get in the shower with Tony. "You don't get your bit of a present until later tonight, though. Got stuff planned." He hummed.
"Part of the job description of being a husband," he hummed, slipping in a third finger, "I'm supposed to know these things."
"It'll get sorted out. Just relax." Steve soothed, settling Tony in the bed. "Get rest and you can sort it all out tomorrow, okay? It’s not going anywhere. Take your time."
"Yeah, something like that. They could be made into anything really, if you know how to do it." He explained. "I have a few of my own, and they all have their own personalities. There's DUM-E, U, Butterfingers, and JARVIS-- I wish I could bring some of them for you to meet..."
Steve just shrugged with a laugh at that. "Hey, Jersey's out of the state, so I could at least say that." He chuckled, rolling over and burying his face into Tony's stomach. "As long as the motel hasn't had a murder in it."
"He's a growing boy, Tony." Steve replied. "He eats well and a little snack won't hurt, I don't think. He did eat all of his food."
"Tony, don't do that. Why are you feeling so disappointed?" Steve asked gently, leaning up in the bed and rubbing gently at Tony's back.  "Or more accurately, why do you feel you've been disappointing?"
"I'm-- I'm breathing," Tony stammered, adjusting himself ever so slightly, drawing his arms in to his chest, "I'm okay."
"Yeah, we have a meeting, we got matched," Tony breathed, still partially stunned, "Holy shit, Steve, we're gonna have a
He leaned over and left a peanut butter kiss on Steve's cheek, laughing softly to himself as he grabbed a bag of pretzels.
Steve smiled happily at that, smooching Peter's temple. "I think he forgives you, Petey." He whispered. "I don't think he's one to hold a grudge."
"Hey, hey, stockings," Tony laughed, easing himself down into his recliner, "Go ahead, Petey. Yours is in your dinosaur one."
Steve did a double take at the statement, eyeing Tony on the floor. Apprehensively, he got up from his seat and to the floor, lying on his back next to Tony.
"It’s about four in the afternoon." He answered, petting Tony's hair back softly. "You feeling okay? You seem sluggish."
Steve let out a careful moan from the sensation, hips twitching upwards for a moment into the touch. Tony smirked over at him, work-calloused hands helping guide his own and developing a rhythm.
He snuggled down into Steve, reaching up to lazily play with the stray hairs on the nape of his neck. Steve hummed happily at the touches, playing footsie as they relaxed.
"....I don't know how, but you need to put it away. Somewhere I can't get to it," he whispered, hands shaking, "I can't-- I can't know where it is, okay?"
"He'll get there, but I'm not imposing early sexual topics on my child, end of discussion," Tony snapped, "You two
"Yeah baby," Tony murmured, leaning over to help clean Peter's hands, "Do you need to go potty first? I'll take you, if you do."
"Peter, we would never stop loving you. Even if you had a little brother or sister, sweetie." Steve assured, smooching the boy's cheeks. "We'll always love you the same, kiddo. Never any less. I promise."
"Yeah, yeah, shoosh," Tony soothed, easing himself into the bath in front of Steve, relaxing into his warm chest.
"You should have seen him, Tony. He was sat up like a big boy and so proud of himself." Steve explained, playing with Sammy's fingers.
"You first," Tony insisted, a smug grin on his face, "I know what Bruce got me, he gets me the same gag gift every year."
"Tooonnneeeee" Steve whined back playfully, finally uncovering his prize with his teeth. "Just playing a bit, darlin'." He grinned, mouthing gently at the tip of Tony's cock before taking him in.
you aren't." Steve said with an anxious laugh from the current surprise of what Peter found. "We are having Daddy up the security on your computer and internet. There are things out there that you do not need to stumble upon yet, Peter. As a punishment for you sneaking to find things."
let him stay like that, God forbid," Tony replied, trying to keep the protectiveness out of his voice, "Let him stay innocent."
"Ever since we had Sammy, sometimes it don't feel like it..." Peter said, starting to sniffle. "He don't spend much time with jus' me anymore. And when I get a chance to be with jus' him, Sammy's crying or stinky or hungry."
"All set for the adventure. Just hope Sammy doesn't cry when we leave." Steve murmured as he got in the car.
Tony laughed at that, propping some things up in the suitcase before finding what he was looking for. Making sure Steve wasn't looking, Tony wriggled out of his jeans and boxers, tugging up chocolate edible underwear that Bruce had given him as a joke. He folded his clothes up and put his shirt aside, grabbing the chocolate lube before going over to Steve. He tossed the bottle on the bed, straddling the blond's waist.
"Gonna get you clean, honey. You've had a busy night and need to get to bed," Tony replied gently, starting to clean him off, "We'll cuddle on top of the comforter, and we'll wash the sheets when we get up."
"I don't want him to grow up, I want Pete to be our Peter Pan," Tony murmured, nearly falling asleep in Steve's warmth, "He deserves all the goodness childhood brings, he really does."
Steve nodded softly, settling back on the bed. He leaned up to kiss Tony softly in thanks, nuzzling his cheek as he pulled away.
"I know. I wasn't talking about that yet." He explained, rolling to face Tony. "Was just jumping onto it. Wanted to see how comfy it was--" he hummed, curling up on the bed.
"I was performing an impromptu rescue mission, which was a success by the way. And I think that is a mask of some sort. For armor or something.".
"Oh my god, big nerds, the both of you," Tony laughed, "Steve, you're gonna make him pee himself, and get him all riled up before bed."
Peter barely poked his head out from under the bed, glancing up at his dad. "What do ya mean 'who is it'?".
Tony moaned softly, spreading his legs just a little more to give Steve a better angle. "Y-yes sir," He stammered, going up on his tiptoes to raise his hips more.
"We can get 'im bandaids," he suggested, staring out the window, "It'll help his booboos get bettah, wight?"
"Sorry! Just trying to make sure we have everything and it’s all sorted." Steve answered, traipsing down the stairs.
Peter giggled at that. "I'mma make sure he eats his veggies 'n goes ta bed by 8:30." He laughed, settling further into Tony's chest. "It’s what he gets fo' bein' a meanie to you and Papa."
Steve took his with an amused smile, admiring how Peter had tried to wrap the gifts. He had a bit of practice to do, but it wasn't all too bad. He opened his present to find a small box of Hershey Kisses and Hugs along with a small drawing Peter had made.
"I've had enough of this," Tony grunted, reaching around Steve's head to unbuckle the gag. He tossed it aside, greedily capturing Steve's mouth. "Better," he mumbled.
“Tattoo Parlor? I want in," Tony grinned, sitting down with Sammy in his lap, "I want a beaker on my shoulder."
Tony nodded and pressed himself into Steve's chest, taking a moment in breathe in the familiar Irish soap and cinnamon; he sighed happily, wrapping his arms around Steve.
"These and a few pictures are all I really have of him, save for the few small memories from when I was little.".
She nodded and let them in completely, pointing out his huddled figure in the corner of the living room. "James is in there watching him," She replied quietly, "He's the only one who got him to stop crying."
"But you don't have to do this alone. Never will have to. I'll be there for you, always. I made that promise, remember?" Steve smiled softly, kissing Tony's knuckles lightly.
"Hold your horses--" Steve said teasingly, pulling his fingers away and going to grab the cock ring. He sauntered back over to Tony, slipping it on carefully and kissing the nape of the brunet's neck softly. "Better?"
"No, no Peter. You'll have special kisses, I promise." Steve assured, helping wipe the tears away. "He doesn't know better yet, plus he's your brother so those kisses aren't like Daddy and I's."
A movie called Lilo and Stitch had begun to play, the opening sequence being set in space and containing a variety of strange alien beings that honestly enthralled Steve enough to attempt to draw some. as he doodled and the movie played, the blond sighed and set the drawing pad beside him for now. All of this just wasn't the same without doing it next to Tony, he found out. The man just had a way about him that Steve just enjoyed being around him. Without Tony, it sort of just felt... lonely.
not to be like that around him. He must've got it through osmosis," Tony snorted, "And you throw tantrums too, don't try to put that one on me-- well..."
"There's more if you want there to be?" Tony replied in a question, voice still staying surprisingly smooth. "I'd like to show you all different things humans do, including how our relationships work. If you want, that is. And we could take our time unlike the movie. We've got all summer, right?"
It was Tony's turn to glance worriedly at Steve, shrugging. Steve picked up Peter and sat him on his lap.
you. But I never told you." The genius said softly, looking over into bright blue eyes. "I didn't know if you'd feel the same, so I didn't tell you. I didn't want to ruin our friendship if you didn't. But I figured you might not remember once you were better, so at least I can say that I--"
"C'mon, Tony... Come for me... Take me there with you, baby. So close..." Steve moaned, thrusting up hard into Tony to nail his sweet spot.
Steve took a deep breath as he felt the emotions Tony kept blocked for so long. All coming wave after wave, feelings of regret, shame, and any negative feelings he could think of. His hands tightened softly around Tony's, running his thumbs along the back of his husband's hands.
Tony helped Steve ride through it, come covering over their hands as he guided Steve through the fall. He whispered soft praises to the other, praising and kissing at Steve's temple as he fell from his first ever pleasure-high.
get dressed, and I--" he grinned, sticking his tongue out at Steve, "I get to set up the house, so to speak."
It didn't take much longer before the nurse returned with a file of paperwork in her hands, grinning at the site of them in front of her.
"Proud'a you," Tony tuffled Peter's hair as he walked past, grabbing Sammy's bottle from the counter.
"Feels so good, Stevie." Tony moaned quietly, petting Steve's hair in encouragement and praise. "Feels
He swallowed, quickly devouring his breakfast. Up on his feet, Peter put his dishes in the sink, obviously ready to go.
"Tony, hey, shh. Relax..." Steve soothed, petting his hair gently then lifting Tony's face up to his, stroking the tears away softly from his cheeks, "You want to talk about it? Do you need a minute?"
"Yeah, I'll go and get one tonight," Tony murmured, petting the baby's fine hair, "Poor thing is probably in pain."
Sammy whined up at Peter, but grabbed at his ankles again, slowly tugging himself up into a standing position. Peter grinned and held Sammy for a moment, then let go, backing away.
Peter whined, putting his hands on his face to hide his embarrassed flush. Tony laughed softly and tugged the boy to his chest, rubbing circles in his back.
"Alright. Fair enough." He stated. "It’s still a bit too cold out for things outside, so we could do a classic date; Dinner and a movie. Do you know if there are any movies out in particular you want to see?"
He caught Steve's lips again, hungrily drawing him deeper into the kiss. The blond complied eagerly, moving his hands down to tug off Tony's pants. He made a happy noise as he felt something familiar. He pulled back and looked down with a grin.
Tony nodded, kissing Steve's cheek as they headed for the checkout. The process was quick for them to get out to the car, arms laden with black bags full of their purchases; the drive home seemed quicker than the drive up, blood pumping through Tony's veins as he helped Steve carry the bags inside.
"Your turn." He answered softly, running his hands along Tony's chest. "Do what you'd like, but your turn."
"Good. It’s been a long day. Tomorrow will seem longer." Steve sighed, bumping their noses together before working on grabbing up some of the boy's gifts. "He's getting a great Christmas this year."
Steve jolted up, hand instinctively going to his ass cheek at the pinch. He rubbed it slightly with a pout as he headed towards the door to be met with Natasha, Clint, and Bucky.
"You're a real merman... I was rescued by a merman. Something that shouldn't exist." He croaked out. "I definitely swallowed too much saltwater. I'm hallucinating."
"No news is good news. He'll probably text you when the kid's asleep," Tony murmured, ducking his head under Steve's chin, "I love that kid to death, y'know. I hope-- Man, I hope I don't throttle that Flash Thompson."
Tony held back a sniffle and slowly got Steve's belt off his jeans, handing it to him before standing awkwardly at the side of the bed, not moving towards his lap.
"Um." The doctor replied, brows furrowed in thought as he continued to run fingers through dark locks.
"Thank you," Tony chuckled, letting himself down. He hobbled into the shower, sighing as he slid down onto the shower seat.
"I figured that'd spark your interests." Steve grinned as they settled on the sofa, cuddling up under the quilt.
Steve hummed into the bites and the kiss, carding fingers into Tony's hair. "That sounds like a confession to me. I may just have to take you in for questioning." He smirked, nipping Tony's bottom lip.
"Old, Brucey. Probably Smithsonian-worthy, but they'd be better in use than on a shelf," Tony hummed, lacing his fingers with Steve's hand, "Now, the flask is slightly cracked, but the rest of it is operable, if you'd like to use it. Decoration's all good, too--"
"Oh, uh..." He began. "Do you wanna move to the bed then? Get some pillows set up for you to lay on?"
"They were about you, y'know?" Tony spoke softly, his voice slightly cracking as he spoke. Steve's ears twitched as he listened to what Tony had to say.
They followed the route they remembered, heading up the elevator and traveling until they were just in front of the room. Peter obediently waited for the nurse to come by and help him sanitize his hands before poking his head into Ms. Sharon's room, creasing his brow when he didn't see anyone.
"Love you, love how y'feel, Tony. God..." Steve whispered back, picking up his pace a bit as he moved. He kissed up Tony's collarbone, latching on and sucking and nipping to form a hickey before trailing further down.
He bounced on his heel back out to the desk, giving Miss Potts a quick kiss on the cheek, flicking his eyes over to confirm Steve's jealous expression before rolling his sleeves down and shrugging his coat back on.
Ruby rolled her eyes so hard, it looked like they would come out of their sockets but still gave a small smile to the guy. He didn't seem too bad.
Female Stark and Rogers number 2 were literally frozen in their place with shock painted on their faces as they saw their lifeless daughter on the floor. The curtain stopped moving mid-swing, just as it was flapping back to its natural position.
Vision sat back down and continued to watch his Beloved with a fond expression in his eyes. After surviving against Thanos, the two have decided to lay low and separate from the Avengers. Don't get them wrong, they would still do whatever they can to save the world if need be. But for now, they were contented in their home in a small little town in the countryside. In here, they were just themselves. Just two people trying to live a normal life like any other couple.
"That's quite recent. You think Hydra's still using this place?" Romanoff, on the other hand, was quiet. Her restless eyes darted back and forth between the photos as she took in the specifics of each document.
“We’re on an alternate dimensional reality. This is earth 3490. Infinity wanted us to see this, though I’ve no idea why.” Stephen explained.
The principal looked at her with a smile that didn't quite reached his eyes. "I reckon that you've been given your schedule, yes?" His fake and forced expression annoyed the hell out of her and his presence was making the Voice anxious. In turn, it was making her anxious at the same time.
Well, anyways, as mentioned before, Tony and Steve had been lazy today. After finishing his project at the lab, Tony said that he’ll watch a movie and asked Steve if he wanted to come along. So this was the reason why they found themselves on a Star Wars movie marathon, curled up underneath a blanket on the communal room’s couch and munching on nachos. They were on the 4th one already and Steve still couldn’t get enough of how Tony mouthed the dialogue of his favourite characters along with the movie.
Wanda's laugh were replaced by screams of anguish while Pietro silently cried as he held onto his father's leg. 'You're out of control freaks! I will be no father to the likes of you.' The man shouted, pulling both children off of his leg and dragged them outside their house. For days, the children begged to be allowed back in. In their street, the neighbours were scared of them too. Afraid of what they would do, if their father decided not to open the door for them.
Dragging Steve and Tony to a shooting stall, Ruby pointed out to the big brown bear that could be won as a price.
Steve saw Tony process these thoughts and nodded in agreement. He was glad that they both have the same perspective towards this situation.
"Uh... I'm Ruby? I'm a Tolkien fan too." Ruby said as she nodded towards the hoodie he was wearing. The guy just looked at her, unimpressed.
So all in all, Ruby enjoyed the day out. She thought that it was nice to get re-acquainted to the normal world again, to get to see the good stuff in life she thought she'll never see again.
Her chase led her in front of a bank. The site was already closed off with barricade tape and was surrounded by officers, reporters and even the SWAT team. Ruby hid herself inside a dark alleyway but still with a clear view of what was happening.
A tear ran down her cheek as she contemplated what she just had done. How could she ever believe that her abilities could bring good? That she could use it to help people? Look at Captain America. If this is what it does to a super soldier like him, what more to civilians? What if she accidentally hit someone?
"If Clint ended up here first, he would have put on the next instalment of that movie." Steve replied, his face contorting with a grimace. He really didn't want to put himself through the pain of watching that again. Those are the kinds of things that make him question why he even bothered to save the world from ending.
"Just your protégé being himself." Natasha explained. Steve and Tony didn't even bother to clarify what it meant.
Ruby continued to follow the direction of her voice. The closer she got, the more anxious she felt. Despite the heavy feeling of uncertainty in the air, she treaded through the rocky path until she reached a humungous angel oak tree perched in between of two diverging paths.
Her eyes met with the malicious shade of azure. The very same ones she swore she would forget and bury deep within in her soul.
"Good, kitty." The kitten purred as Ruby scratched her fingers behind its ears. She had been completely entranced and taken by the creature that Ruby didn't even hear the footsteps that were clumsily and hurriedly heading towards her.
Ruby slowly turned her head towards Bucky and gave him an overdramatic smile. When she noticed that her charm did not work against him and he just stared at her deadpanned, she coughed once to clear her throat and swallowed.
"Oh, I thought maybe I'd do Applied Mathematics." Ruby answered after a moment of thinking about her future career. Everybody gave her a nod of approval at her choice. "You're fine with attending the Empire State University?" Ruby said yes immediately. To be honest, she didn't really care whatever college Tony sends her to. She wasn't going to be picky.
"If you're gonna stay in my Tower, might as well call me Tony, kid." Mr Stark, uh, Tony, said when Ruby expressed her gratitude.
After Ruby took off her shoes and carefully placed them beside the wardrobe, she hopped on the bed and couldn't contain the satisfied groan that came out of her mouth. It's been too long since she slept on a bed. She took a deep breath and immediately got a whiff of lavender and chamomile.
"Tony, status report." Tucking the blueprint inside one of the weapons compartment of his suit, he exited the room. And sure, there were more officers coming down his way. All their rifles raised and ready to fire.
"That's enough. Thank you." She smiled and kissed him on the cheek before turning back her focus on mixing the sauce.
Ruby grinned when she heard her friends groan in frustration and then laughed at her confession. "I wouldn't fault you with that, though. That guy is a menace. He should be thankful you're not blowing his ass off the face of the earth."
The kid clearly sounded in distress and the team wasted no time to suit up. With the incident's location not too far away from the Tower, the Avengers were confident that they would be able to get in time without the boy being seriously injured. Steve, who was as equally worried that the Spider kid was fighting against the symbiote again, asked Friday to pull up a visual of the fight.
"I am not aware that you will be dropping by the tower." Wanda's eyes turned back to Steve who was giving Tony a 'Why was I not consulted about this?' look. The man just shrugged which was basically Stark speak for 'So what?' Steve rolled his eyes but proceeded to step towards Ruby and placed a hand on her left shoulder.
"They are in the kitchen, Captain." The AI answered and Steve immediately went down where the kids were. The smell of bacon, eggs, and waffles filled his nose as soon as he stepped a foot in the kitchen. Ruby was bent over the counter, still whipping up some mix while Peter was trying to fry both bacons and eggs at the same time in two different pans.
When Peter had enough, he decided to resort to more drastic measures. He took his glove off and raised his dominant hand as high up as he could. “I am
Meanwhile, Tony hurriedly approached Ruby’s location after he saw her literally fall from high up in the air to flat down on the ground. He was definitely sure that he heard a sickening crack of bones upon the impact but when he reached the girl, he was disturbed by her unharmed form despite of the pool of blood she was lying on.
"Stay here.” Ruby was so confused. “Wait for me till I get back." She thought they were going to the Statue of Liberty so what the hell was she doing here sitting in a coffee shop?
A small whirring noise made her look to the side and was surprised to see a robot, almost as tall as she was in her sitting position, holding out a pair of... socks?
Peter had had enough so he sucker punched Flash on the stomach. Conveniently, that was when Principal O’Malley arrived at the scene and saw Flash lying on the ground with all the three of them looming over him and the whole class watching. They got automatic detention while Flash got sent to the nurse office, thanks to their useless PE teacher who didn't bother to explain that it was Flash who threw the first punch.
"Oh my God!" A waitress squealed as she ran out of the coffee shop and headed towards Ruby. "That was Spider Man, Right? Right? He was so hot! Did he save you? Did you get to ride in his arms like a damsel in distress? Was it good? I bet it was! You're so lucky! What's your name anyway?"
Although this wasn't his neighbourhood, Spider Man didn't discriminate on who to help. So to make sure that Ruby would be safe as possible, Peter scouted through the vicinity to find a coffee shop to drop her off. Landing just next to the main entrance, he sat Ruby down to one of the chairs and gave her his backpack.
It's Sunday so that means team bonding day. Unless there's a matter of national security. Or international. Either way works.
"I'm fine." Both of them winced at the obvious lie but Ruby was thankful that Steve didn't comment about it. He just gave her a reassuring smile that she returned back with her own shy one.
"I hope so, Петр," Bucky answered. "Стив told me that he talked with Директор Фыри, and he said he was hoping to get me a military ID and driver's licence within the next few months, once—" He broke off, swallowing hard as he glanced up at Tony. "He said he's just gotta tie up some loose ends first."
The look Steve gave him, one of such immense gratitude and adoration mixed with so much intense self-loathing was almost too much for Tony to handle. The self-loathing he could understand since he had so much personal experience with that one, but the rest…
He crawled into the bed, cuddling up right next to Tony with his head resting on Tony's chest so he could hear his heartbeat. Tony buried his fingers into his thick blond hair and dug his fingertips into his scalp, pulling a soft moan from Steve's throat.
"Don't worry, I'll only hold it against you for a little while," Natasha replied from where Pietro had whisked her nearly a hundred metres away. "How's it looking now, Cap? Are we good?"
Peter gave a rather modest shrug.  “Well… I do tend to win most of the games that we play together, so—”
"Okay, just… can you remind me exactly what these gems are again?" asked James. "Not all of us were as involved in the incident in New York as others."
"So, do I want to know why there weren't any prices listed on the menu?" Steve asked with a smile, one that made his blue eyes sparkle and reveal the dimple that never failed to make Tony's breath catch.
"I am, sweetheart," Steve had answered, his dimple showing as he smiled, that gorgeous dimple of his that Tony was convinced could end the decades-long war in less than three seconds if flashed to the appropriate people. Tony had been too choked up to say anything further, choosing instead to show his appreciation in other ways, but the drawing had stuck inside his head like glue, burned into his memory as the perfect idyllic end to all of their current madness.
What did matter is that somehow, either Dad or Peter needed to get to the bottom of what Obie was trying to do.  And the sooner the better.
“Now that’s the voice of a true competitor,” Shostakov says as he slinks back over to his seat next to Batroc.  He whispers something in Russian to Batroc that the Algerian can apparently understand, if his answering chuckle is any indication, leaving Steve so angry that he could swear he could feel steam coming out of his ears.
He was cut off by another blast, this time straight to his chest, throwing him backwards at least twenty metres and landing him flat on his back, unable to breathe.
Steve watched him go, dropping his head into his hands once he was done. He'd been planning on visiting Peter that afternoon, but since they had finished their simulator session a bit early he figured that Tony would be in a hurry to complete his own work so he could get out and visit Peter before curfew started, and he didn't want to risk running into Tony at the hospital.
"That's how it's gonna be, buddy," Tony said firmly. "There are risks that come with using this thing that we need to make sure everyone understands before anyone goes near it, okay? And I'm not sure if I'm willing to allow you to take that risk. Not yet, not until we all talk it through first."
And in the meantime this Doctor List person was still conducting his experiments, and no one had any idea where he was or how many other people he had managed to hurt in the process.
"No!" Steve choked on a gasp as Peter released his grip and he fell into a crumpled heap on the freezing cold floor. He immediately reached for his left foot, cradling it as Doctor List and Wanda turned and walked away, their footsteps echoing in time with his panicked cries.
"Yeah, just okay," Peter said, rather impishly. He paused for a moment, glancing up at Steve as he bit his bottom lip. "So, do you think that I'll be able to—?"
But these last few days, filled with nothing more strenuous than sunbathing and playing frisbee on the beach, lazy meals on the patio of their villa, sightseeing in a town where they were hardly recognised, and lots of alone time with Tony, had managed to recharge Steve in such a way that he could almost say that he felt like his old self again.
looks as he stepped out of the car. Tony could've sworn he saw a flash of trepidation race across Peter's brown eyes, but it was there and gone again so fast that he decided he had just imagined it. "I'll see you after the dance, okay?"
"Dad?" Peter asked as he bounced impatiently on his feet, his huge brown eyes filled to the brim with curiosity and excitement. "What do you think?"
Their ease of conversation was also helpful in soothing most of Tony's lingering fears regarding Peter's upcoming transfer. Peter hadn't exactly been thrilled with the prospect of being moved from the hospital, which Tony could understand. But the fact that Tony had essentially had to tell Peter that he didn't have a say in the matter despite his begging and pleading still haunted him. All through Peter's life Tony had tried to use the so-called "Dad card" as sparingly as possible, and it had made him very uneasy that he and Steve were basically forcing Peter to go and live in a house with an old woman who he didn't know and who knowingly hated his grandfather.
"Absolutely, bud," Tony said, relieved when his voice didn't crack. "And if anyone can convince them to start talking to us, it's Fury and Papa, right?"
"Where the hell is my son?" Tony demanded, finally finding his voice. "JARVIS says he's still at the school, but he's supposed to be with you."
"Okay," Peter finally said about fifteen minutes later, brushing bits of dust out of his curls. "I think I'm done."
“JARVIS is our UI butler that I told you about, huh, Steve?” added Peter.  “He runs our whole Tower!”
Sucking in a deep breath, Tony turned to Steve. "I saw him, hon. I saw Pete, the day he was born. The day—"
Papa had even taught Peter how to pop popcorn on the stove and melt butter to sprinkle over the top, which Peter had decided was one of his new favourite foods pretty much right after his very first handful.
"Is there a problem, Captain Rogers?" asked the colonel, and Steve jumped, internally kicking himself for being so transparent. So much for not drawing his attention.
“You busted the damn hell outta it!” Tony shrieks, and Steve groans as another shockwave of pain ripples down his stinging, throbbing leg.  “I mean,
"Well, I won't tell him if you don't." Steve tipped his head back against Tony's shoulder, beyond grateful that it didn't seem like he'd aggravated his still-healing ribs. He had gotten so used to his body's enhanced healing factor that having to wait for something to heal had hit him harder than he'd expected. Steve had never enjoyed waiting for anything, and that didn't combine well with his usual tendency to push himself.
"Daddy!" Peter cried, tears stinging his eyes as the word tore through his raw throat like scissors through tissue paper. His Spider Sense was still going haywire, his heart was thudding madly, and his legs were shaking so badly that his knees were practically knocking together. "Daddy! Where are you?"
He was cut off by the emergency vehicle as it pulled up just off to the side of the runway, the medics readying their stretcher as Steve's aircraft grew closer.
“We’ll see, bud,” Tony murmured into Peter’s hair.  He planted a quick kiss to the top of his head before releasing him, giving his curls one final ruffle.  “Am I s’posed to pick you up at that bookstore again this afternoon?”
"Yeah, I'm sure." Dad cupped Peter's cheeks in his hands, brushing his tears away with his thumbs. "We're gonna get him back, Pete, I
"Look, sweetheart," he whispered, jerking his head towards the anteroom. "They're all here to root for Peter."
in the mood to hear any excuses from Scott whoever-the-hell-he-was. As soon as he'd heard JARVIS mention Hank Pym's name, Tony had been so damn close to calling George Stacy and having him arrest the goddamn son-of-a-bitch that Steve almost hadn't been able to stop him, finally promising Tony that he would agree to press charges against Hank if they still felt they were necessary after they'd had a chance to talk with Scott Lang.
"Yes, it does," interrupted Steve. He glanced over at Tony, who gave him a quick nod. "We think that the weapon that took out the power plant at the end of the Battle of the Continents was powered by energy from the tesseract."
A pregnant pause settled over the bathroom as Steve attempted to glare at Tony, his lower lip starting to shake after about only three seconds.
Steve thought as they stepped out onto the bright and sunny yard, such a stark contrast to his roiling emotional state.
The conversation continued but Tony barely listened, too focused on his husband to pay more than the minimal amount of attention until Bruce and Helen arrived. Steve's eyes never left Tony's face as Helen conducted a quick initial assessment, starting two separate IV lines before giving Steve an injection of a pain medication that was just strong enough for Tony and Peter to be able to lift him onto the stretcher without hurting him too badly.
"Not leaving here until I do," Tony said firmly. He cupped his son's greyishly pale face, planting a quick kiss to his forehead. "Go with Uncle Sam now, buddy, he'll take care of you."
The group of strangers that Steve had taken five years ago and moulded together into the well-oiled machine that had not only saved the world, they had saved the entire
"Then whose fault is it?" Peter shrieked, jumping when his heart monitor started to beep. "We can't let my papa die up there, Uncle Bucky! We just can't! My dad—!"
"That's very brave of you, Your Highness," Steve said softly. "Especially after what happened to your father."
"He's right," Tony said, thick and low. "Pete… he—he's never had a grandparent that's really cared about him, about
Tony opened his mouth, snapped it closed, then glanced over to see Sam's look of curiosity and heaved a tired sigh. He should've known Steve would be able to read it all over his face the moment he saw him.
Hearing Peter call Steve ‘Papa’ like it was the most natural thing in the world, as if Steve had been there from the very beginning, only cemented the deal.
Satisfied with the GPS, Tony squared his shoulders, trying to convey to Steve that he wasn't as nervous as he felt. His brief living room nap aside, neither of them had slept well the night before, with what little sleep they did manage to get plagued with nightmares of sinking airplanes and people breaking apart like leaves.
"Then I've gotta stay ahead of it," Peter said. He pushed himself up to a sitting position and cracked his knuckles, taking a quick peek at the door to make sure no one was coming. Uncle Sam had gone up to the base with Uncle James to help Dad, and Uncle Bucky was sitting out in the living room with Grandma, trying to offer her support. Ms Sharon would be stopping by to check on him soon, once her shift at the hospital was over, but at the moment, Peter was unsupervised.
"This is so fascinating," Gwen said as she added some finishing touches on her drawing of Leo. "It's so much better than just looking at pictures in a book, isn't it?"
and reached for the boxed set.  He took it from the shelf with shaking fingers, flipping it over to see the back, his jaw dropping as he read it over.  He had heard about the original Bloomsbury limited editions of
Another pause fell across the lab, with Tony unsure if he should be amused that there was apparently someone else out there who loved Star Wars as much as Peter, or disgusted by the fact that Peter's girlfriend just compared him to an ugly fictional spaceship.
"Mmm," said Peter. "You know, it's okay to be sad about your husband, but why didn't you ever tell Papa any of this? Don't you think he'd wanna know?"
He could also hear the faint din of the television, currently broadcasting the trial of Hank Pym. Peter had learned in the last nine weeks that Papa always liked to know what was going on, something he called "minding his surroundings". And while it may have been a bit much for Papa to be keeping watch over the treason trial of such a miserable, bitter man on his own wedding day, Peter wasn't about to chastise him for it. It's not like it was hurting anyone.
"Oh wow, is it really that time already?" Steve asked. Of course he'd noticed that the weather was cooling down and the days were getting shorter, but somehow the last five months or so had seemed to pass both at a snail's pace and in the blink of an eye, and that both surprised and unnerved Steve. He didn't enjoy being so jarred by something as simple as the passage of time. It tended to remind him far too much of waking up alone in that mockup 1940s hospital room back in the old SHIELD headquarters, not realising that he'd just been asleep for the last sixty-plus years.
"What the fuck is wrong with you goddamn people?" Dad screamed, sending Peter scrambling to curl into a ball, his hands clamped so tightly over his ears he was afraid he was going to push them into his skull.
“You mean we're in the Twilight Zone or something?” he asks.  “That dumb show that Clint loves so much?”
And then there'd been Obadiah Stane, the man who'd tried for years to mould Tony into the perfect Iron Monger war profiteer, and then arranged to have him and Peter kidnapped by the Ten Rings after Tony tried to push back. Steve still couldn't even think of the man's name without white-hot rage flooding his body, along with a hefty dose of fear at how close he had come to losing his husband and son forever.
Doctor List tilted his head, once again regarding Steve with an air of disappointment.  “Oh, Captain,” he said with a sigh.  “You may have believed that your little stunt with Schmidt’s aircraft was enough to kill HYDRA completely, but I’m afraid that even with your, shall we say, flair for the dramatic, you still only managed to cut off one head.”  He paused, stepping so close to the window that his long, rather beaky nose was almost touching the glass.  “And now, two more have taken its place.”
Steve frowns as he holds out the tablet for Tony to see.  “Dinner might be pushing it a bit,” he says as he points to one of several green blinking dots on the screen.  “There are at least two to three times as many guards as we’ve ever seen before, stationed in what appears to be both watchtowers and bunkers.”  Tapping the closest tower to their position, Steve zooms in on it, pointing to the mounted guns along the top.  “And these guns are definitely more advanced than anything we’ve seen.”
"Um, because it wasn't just an internal conflict," Tony said slowly, almost as though he was talking to Peter when he was a toddler. "Those helicarriers were programmed to target millions of innocent civilians, as I'm sure your committee members read in the thousands upon thousands of pages of data that Agent Romanoff made available to the public."
Steve tilted his head, looking up at him with pleading blue eyes that were already starting to darken. "I'm not ready to go to sleep yet," he said as he slid his hand up Tony's bare arm to his neck, tugging him closer so he could kiss him. Tony whimpered as Steve deepened the kiss, shifting them so Tony was once again lying underneath him. He should've known that Steve would need more help calming down that just a few chaste kisses and murmured words.
Fury shot him a deep scowl. "Yes, Tony, something like that. And if that were to happen, then SHIELD and the Avengers would be able to coordinate with the Wakandan government to ascertain the best type of response."
"See, sweetheart? JARVIS says that Peter's just fine," Steve said. But Tony couldn't believe him. JARVIS had been overridden before, made to give out incorrect information that had led Tony astray, so Tony could not take his word for it now. He had to see Peter for himself.
A hard shiver raced down Peter's spine at the thought of the entirety of the United States Armed Forces under the control of HYDRA, and especially if supplied with weapons made from stolen Chitauri artefacts. Peter had looked through one of Dad's secured catalogs way back when he first started running the Department of Damage Control, and the sheer amount of stuff in there had raised his eyebrows. Power cores, practically indestructible metals, flying snowmobile-like contraptions, staff pulse weapons that reminded him of Teal'c's staff in Stargate SG1; there really was no limit to what HYDRA could do with the tech, especially in the hands of a brilliant engineer and a wealthy weapons' manufacturer, both of whom had massive bones to pick with Tony Stark.
“You were too afraid, yeah?” Tony murmured as he slid a pillow underneath Steve’s hips and settled in next to him, trailing his fingertips up and down Steve’s spine.  “Before?”
“Language,” Steve says weakly, relief washing over him like a wave.  At least he knows that Tony’s still alive.
“Yes, sir,” JARVIS said, not without a touch of sympathy.  “Render for the pharmaceutical printing device will be completed in approximately eight hours.”
Apparently they were hungry, yet another thing that Peter could relate to, even though it now took him twice as long to actually eat anything.
Tony’s lower lip trembled as he cupped Steve’s face in his hands, pressing another soft kiss to his lips.
Gulping, Steve nodded, wiping the grime and sweat from his eyes as he tried to think of what to do next.
"No!" T'Challa screamed, bounding like a cat over to where the stone rested. "No, you cannot have it! That stone belongs to Wakanda!"
Peter glanced up at the clock, his pencil flipping increasing in speed and frequency. Patience had never been one of his strongest suits—Dad always said he got that from him—and while Uncle James had promised Peter that Papa wasn't seriously hurt, he really,
"Uhh, yeah," Peter said. He resumed his position, unable to keep his wide smile in check. St Patrick's Day was still over three months away, but the thought of getting to spend an entire weekend with Gwen, even if it was under the watchful eyes of most of his family, made him very, very happy.
Wordlessly, Tony stepped out of his armour and climbed into the back of the truck, not taking his eyes off of Peter's face as he knelt down next to him, brushing the damp curls off his forehead and leaning over to kiss him. Then he reached his hand back which Steve promptly took, lacing their fingers together as Bruce and Dr Cho settled into the front seats to head back to the Tower.
The sergeant shook his head. "No, sir," he replied. "I'm so sorry, I was in here prepping to receive your aircraft, and… all I saw was a bright flash of yellow."
"Shh. I want to," whispered Steve. He tightened his arm around Tony, breathing in the glorious scent of his hair. "Please, sweetheart. I just—I just need to hold you."
“Oops.  Sorry dude,” the guy says as he hurries past Steve, leaping off of the train just before the doors slide closed.  Steve grunts as he gingerly rubs his sore shoulder, wishing he’d thought to put on his sling when he left the PT centre.
"All right, then as soon as all the diagnostics on Rhodey's suit are done, get started on the drones, yeah?"
Because he did. If anyone understood the constant need to remain by his loved one's bedside while they were sick or injured, it was Tony.
"Not exactly," Uncle James said with a huff. "Nat and Clint have been going round and round with Fury all day, but Fury's not exactly the darling of D.C. anymore so they're not sure how far that'll get 'em, and I've been trying to get through to someone at the Judge Advocate General's office, but since it's a Sunday there's no one around the place that can actually do any good, and the one person I have managed to talk to doesn't even think that they can help because he says that Steve's technically no longer a member of the military."
"I did indeed, sir," answered JARVIS. "Master Peter is currently engrossed in a video chat with Miss Stacy."
"You had your meeting with that engineer this afternoon, didn't you?" asked Steve. "Did something happen?"
“Then I guess that’s my cue to say goodnight,” Steve says.  He offers Tony his hand, smiling shyly when Tony takes it.  His hands are a bit smaller than Steve’s, and sprinkled with calluses, probably from his work as a mechanic.
"Really? Oh, that's awesome, Dad!" he exclaimed. Then he shifted on his feet, fiddling with the binding on his sketchbook. "Um… do you think that we'll ever have time to go on one of these… vacations? My friend Ned at school told me that his family's planning one for our next school break, and I just thought… well… it sounds like it'd be a lot of fun."
"As you were," Colonel Phillips said, frowning as everyone sat back down. He cleared his throat, gesturing to the dark-haired, bespectacled man who was standing next to him, holding a notebook and shifting on his feet. A man who Steve couldn't help but notice was not only remarkably handsome, he also seemed more than a bit familiar.
A huge thank-you to all of my awesome friends on the IronDad and SpiderSon Fic Recs Discord server for their help with this chapter!  💖 You guys are wonderful!!
"Yeah, sure you are," Tony said as he next unwrapped his left hand, which was considerably more beat-up than his right. Steve had been taught to write with his right hand, as back in the early twenties the nuns at the elementary school still believed it was the sign of the devil if a child wrote with his left hand, and while the serum had made him almost ambidextrous he still sometimes favoured his left hand when punching, and his knuckles often paid the price for it.
Steve shot Tony one of his worried looks. "That's good, Peter," he said. "But that doesn't mean that he never will, so… we still have to be careful."
"I'm afraid not, little guy," he said softly. Since rain was being forecasted for the next day his usual excuse of going for an afternoon drive wouldn't really fly with the rest of his teammates.
Unfortunately, it seemed as though only a few seconds had passed before Steve jerked awake again, this time barely managing to catch his gasp of anguish before it pulled from his throat.  The pain was even worse now, like a million tiny knives stabbing him from all directions, while his head felt like someone had taken an ice pick to his temples.  His knuckles were also throbbing in time with his heartbeat, as if he’d been forced to punch a solid brick wall multiple times.
But Strange's twitching only grew more violent as they approached, and just as Tony reached a hand out towards him, he fell back to the ground, pitching forward onto his shaking hands.
"No, you can't say a word about this to anyone!" Peter pleaded. "Look, I'm sure that Dad already inputted some kind of temporary block into the Phoenix satellites that'll prevent anyone from messing with them, but it's only gonna be temporary 'cause he's gonna be too worried about Papa to want to focus too much on it, which means that as long as I can get in there and find the right code, then we might still—"
The tears Steve had been trying to hold back finally spilled down his cheeks, dripping onto his lap as he looked over Peter's head at his husband. Tony's face was almost completely impassive, with only his tight jaw and a single twitching vein in his temple revealing his profound anger and betrayal at seeing his former mentor/ father figure willingly torture his son.
Slowly, Steve curled his shoulders forward, drawing his knees up to his chest and clamping his palms over his ears, trying to drown out the sound that was now too loud to ignore. He squeezed his eyes closed, fighting against the increasing urge to scream.
you attempt to blackmail the very person you should’ve loved as a son into giving up the man that he loves, simply because you find our relationship repulsive!”
"Actually, he's not," answered Sharon. "He finally turned a corner about three days ago and was just discharged earlier this morning. The doctors expect him to make a full recovery."
"Even so, I'm still gonna start making some contingency plans," Steve said. "I know the bill hasn't been passed yet, and judging from that committee meeting we may still have some members of the government who aren't buying into all this, but we still need to be prepared. Hope for the best, but plan for the worst."
"Has anyone ever told you that you're stubborn as hell?" Tony mumbled, still clinging to his last remaining dregs of consciousness.
"No more," Peter said under his breath. Because as soon as Papa activated the tesseract and the phoenix took flight, everything changed. Including the fact that over an hour and a half past the normal curfew time, all the lights in Grandma's house were still on.
"Only probably?" Steve asked with a wink, relieved when Tony's lips twitched into a smirk. Ever since Tony's first trip into the tunnel, when he saw a tiny baby Peter fighting for his life in the neonatal intensive care unit, his emotions had been all over the place, swinging between his manic creative mode to times where Steve had to cajole him to get out of bed in the morning.
"Thanks, Петр," Bucky said as he released Peter, ruffling his hair as Bruce handed Tony the MAUDE glasses. "I'm pretty happy too."
"Ah, guys?" Natasha cut in as the suits powered up, the collective whine of their flight stabilisers almost drowning out the Avengers' comms. "Whatever we're gonna do we better do it soon, 'cause it seems like Hammer's done talking."
"Only what I've heard through SHIELD and from Agent Romanoff, who had some prior experience in dealing with him," Tony said, as casually as possible. "I know that he was considered a prime suspect in the destruction of our Malibu home and also attempted to kill Director Fury a couple of times, but other than that I have no further information."
And that just wouldn't do. Becoming distracted was practically a death sentence for a fighter pilot, especially one flying an experimental aircraft, and Steve had worked way too hard to get where he was to just throw it all away.
"Y, E, S," he said, his voice barely above a weak croak as he tapped in the letters, relief hitting him like a massive wave as he watched JARVIS's familiar code begin to fill his screen.
A murmured chorus of, "Yes, sir" arose from the seated pilots as Captain Rogers raised his hand, the wrinkle of concern still evident between his blond eyebrows.
"It would appear so, sir. Colonel Rhodes was even forced to call for an additional pizza delivery when the four he originally ordered were not sufficient for the three of them."
"Oh, Dad and Papa are gonna be so mad at me," he muttered as he pushed off from the bus, shooting his web towards the top of a passing bridge, his feet brushing through the water as he swung towards the spinning ship.
Steve grinned widely. Peter Edwin Stark was absolutely the sweetest kid he had ever seen, and there were many times when Steve still couldn't believe he was able to call him his son.
Sam called as he swooped down from the sky, directly in front of Steve's parallel-universe counterpart. "
"Master Peter is sleeping peacefully, Captain," answered JARVIS. "His vital signs are all within his normal parameters."
"My father tried his best to convince me to change my mind, even stooping so low as to deny me his blessing to marry Joseph, but by that point I didn't care." She gave Peter such a melancholy smile that tears sprang to his eyes. "I was young, and in love, and I thought Joseph and I could take on the world together."
"Oh yeah!" Peter said with a rather dopey grin. "It was gonna be me and Uncle Bucky against you and Papa, remember?"
"Yeah, yeah, I know it," Phillips said, waving a dismissive hand. "You've probably already heard this story, but before Rogers got that serum of his, he was just as bad off as your boy. Kid was so sick that he could barely sit up anymore, all wheezing and hacking and coughing up blood. His skin was as pasty as freshly fallen snow, and his lips were as blue as the clear morning sky. By the time Sarah and I brought him here to the base for the procedure, I had to practically carry him into the room."
figure this out, Tony," Steve said. "You're not alone, remember? I'm right here. We're both in this together, whatever it takes."
"Me too," Peter said, sniffing. "And I wanna get home too. But we're not gonna get anywhere if we just keep yelling back and forth."
"Yeah, I'll try and call tonight no matter what, okay? If I can't, I'll just see you in school tomorrow."
"No, no, you don't understand," Tony insisted, shaking his head. He pushed against Steve's chest, grunting in annoyance when Steve's arms held him fast. "I can't—I need to get my suit finished, and then I need to get working on yours, and then—"
"Papa! I'm here!" Steve suddenly heard from his left, his eyes widening in shock as Peter landed next to him and grabbed onto his left hand before Steve could protest, gripping it so tightly that Steve couldn't have shaken him loose if he'd tried.
Peter had done some research on phantom limb pain when he'd borrowed Uncle Bucky's datapad the day before—a not-so-easy task since pretty much all of the available information was on sites that were not government-sanctioned—and what he'd read had horrified him. The descriptions of the searing, burning pain radiating up and down the limb that was no longer there were awful, with testimonies of the pain sometimes ratcheting up to such high levels that the patients tried to take their own lives to be rid of it.
—from Peter's perspective, possessing such futuristic thinking skills often led to approximately ten to fifteen percent of actual progress and eighty-five to ninety percent of pure frustration. And apparently the Stark family—or at least the Stark men, since Peter never got the chance to meet his grandmother—didn't really know how to handle such immense frustration in ways that weren't unhealthy. Even before Grandpa's arrest and subsequent trial, Dad had always described him as being cold and distant, which only grew worse once his trial was over.
Ma said as they stepped through the doors to the sound of a tinkling bell. Taking hold of one of the wire baskets stacked just inside, she jerked her head towards the back of the store. "
"Yeah, I guess…" Steve trailed off as he noticed his wedding ring sitting on the bedside table, next to his water cup. Bruce must've had to remove it before setting his fingers. It was very unsettling for him to see it anywhere besides on his finger, as the last time he'd had his wedding ring taken from him had been when HYDRA took him prisoner.
"Yeah, I guess," Lang muttered, wringing his hands. "So… are you guys gonna turn me over to the FBI now or something?"
Tony let out an exaggerated sigh, but thankfully didn't press the issue. Instead, he released Steve and plunked down onto the couch, patting the cushion next to him.
"Oohh," Steve breathed, a huge smile spreading across his lips as Peter stepped out onto the back deck of the house and held out his arm for Ma, just like the little gentleman that he was.
Tony had no idea. All he knew was that the thought of losing him was too painful to even contemplate.
And, even worse, that they had taken his best friend, who Steve had believed to be dead since 1944, and brainwashed him into becoming the most lethal assassin of the last half century.
"No, he sure wouldn't, big guy," he said, his lower lip trembling. Not too long before he was taken, Steve had given the team one of his famous Captain America pep-talks at the end of one of their training sessions, talking about how they all worked together as a synergistic system, the kind of system that was the most efficient and least likely to break down.
"Yeah, he told me," Peter said rapidly. "So… what did you guys find? Did it really come from space?"
And while Tony knew that whatever that water monster had tried to unleash in Peter by chanting those words had been unsuccessful, that didn't mean that it would be the next time.
"Nuh uh," Tony cut in. Steve had already tried to convince Tony that they could just go out to a pub or something in Brooklyn to celebrate their anniversary, but Tony wasn't having it. "This is a special occasion and you're more than worth it, so just hush, yeah?"
"Pull any salvageable audio files from Pete's phone and display," Tony said, tapping the monitor mounted to the inside of the truck.
"Beat Thanos," Peter finished, nodding against Dad's chest. He pulled back, looking directly into his papa's eyes. "Please, don't send me away. I wanna fight."
Unfortunately, that also meant that the team had to tread very carefully. For how easily HYDRA was able to come up with a chump excuse to arrest Steve, Tony couldn't believe that they hadn't yet tried to nail any of the rest of them, especially given Bucky and Natasha's histories as assassins and Bruce's history of running from the government. He had no doubt that they were already being watched, and as such had JARVIS monitoring all communication lines for possible leaks, as well as keeping the defence drones on high alert at all times.
"I believe Mr Stark is referring to the palladium cores inside the arc reactors," said Steve. "They require regular replacement due to burnout."
Steve sighed, his gaze firmly on the full platter of eggs and bacon in front of him. "I'm fine, guys, really. No need to worry."
And Steve’s not only stunned.  Based on how he’s favouring his left arm, he is also in terrible, terrible pain.
A knot rose in Steve's throat at the question, and the way Peter had asked it. The entire drive over to the hospital Steve had been trying to convince himself that he should back off a bit on the visits, especially since he felt bad for constantly lying to his teammates about his whereabouts. But all of those efforts had flown out the window almost the moment he entered the room and saw Peter's face.
“What did you say the father’s name was?” Steve asks, just on the minuscule chance that he somehow heard her wrong.
"Maybe it really is all gonna work out," Peter murmured into his pillow. For the first time in a long time, he was actually feeling hopeful for the future instead of dreading it.
"The part about you thinking that we can get the gauntlet off Thanos," Gamora said. "I don't think you understand just how powerful Thanos is, so—"
to create something that actually healed people instead of blowing holes in them, that there really were no more excuses.  Obie had said that manufacturing weapons kept the world from falling into chaos, but from what Tony could see, the world was already there.
"Your family," Uncle Bucky murmured. "That's… that's…" He broke off, letting out a kind of morbid chuckle before turning very serious. "Peter, I don't—I used to think that the Starks were… well… that they were—"
They continued playing, with Gwen taking the first round by correctly guessing Miss Scarlett in the study with the knife, and Peter taking the second round with Mrs Peacock in the library with the rope. They were just resetting the board to start again when Flash came over, plunking himself down directly between Peter and Gwen, one of the red Solo cups in his hand.
"What does she want, JARVIS?" he asked, trying to push himself up with his numb arms. He hadn't slept at all the night before, trying to give Dad as much support as possible and too wracked with guilt to sleep even if he'd wanted to.
"You're not gonna hurt me, honey," Tony pleaded, growling in frustration. "Please, I need you right the hell—"
of the ground beneath his boots causing a mild shiver to race up his spine. He had to admit that the Gobi desert was a fairly decent hiding place for a HYDRA base since it was so sparsely populated, even if he wished it was anywhere other than yet another frozen tundra.
"So, just for their peace of mind, as it were, do you care to add anything to your statement regarding these… observations, Captain?" O'Brien asked.
Steve had only known Peter for a matter of days, and already felt almost more protective of him than he did of his own ma. He couldn't imagine how much worse it must be for Anthony.
"Such a gentleman," Carol said with a smirk as she stepped forward, grinning at Colonel Rhodes as he held the door open for her. "Good thing I'm surrounded by 'em."
"We will, I promise." Steve brushed his lips across Tony's in a soft, sweet kiss, trailing his thumb across his cheekbone. "Will you get some rest now? Please?"
"Oh my god," Tony laughed, "I don't think I'll get used to hearing you swear. Okay, okay, small rewarding nap, but we do have to move eventually. And we gotta talk about what you wanna do on our little vacation."
"You'll understand when you're older, Pete," Tony laughed, stepping out once the elevator binged, "But if I were you, I'd give Ms. Sharon a mighty big hug once your brother arrives."
"Honey, I love you, but you don't count on this one, you're supposed to say good things." Tony cuddled Peter up to his chest, not surprised that the boy had quickly fallen asleep in his arms.
"Munchkin, we haven't even seen the worst of it yet." The blond explained. "Messy is the first thing on a baby's checklist."
Tony quickly padded over to Peter's room to grab a pair of long socks out of his drawer, rolling his eyes.
"I think twelve hours would be considered too long a time for you." Steve chuckled, adjusting to where he was above Tony, straddling his hips.
"We could add it under the letter later on." Steve murmured, thinking about what all they could do. "Huh? Oh, and what would that be?" He asked, although he had a good idea.
Steve did as asked and angled his hips, picking up his pace and force. He pounded into Tony, moans escaping his lips and body leaning over the other's back.
"Okay. Night, Daddy. Love you." Peter murmured with a sniffle, shutting his eyes again as he settled in bed.
Tony rolled his eyes and shucked his coat off, hanging it on the rack before rolling his sleeves up. Steve followed suit, considering things might get messy should they get to see the body.
The blond hummed in reply, giving Tony ten more swats in succession, setting the belt down after and running soothing hands over Tony's cheeks.
just thank me for sex?" Tony snorted, pulling out gently before settling next to Steve, "I should feel offended. But I'm not." He grinned, smooching his cheek.
"Wha-- then why did you have people put incense in here if you knew you were allergic?" Steve said with a scoff and letting out a chuckle.
Sammy's lip wobbled after Peter left, clearly distraught as he reached after his brother. He wailed loudly, huge tears streaming down his face as he tried to will Peter to come back.
Setting down the notebook, Steve grabbed his cowl and picked up his shield, sliding it into place on his left arm. He was wearing a brand-new Captain America uniform that Tony had just finished making for him the previous night. The rest of the team had new uniforms too, including a new Spider-Man suit for Peter and suits for Wanda and Pietro Maximoff, who Steve had allowed to join the team with the understanding that they wouldn't be assisting with missions until he believed they were ready.
A pink blush crept up Steve's cheeks, and he smiled, revealing the dimple that Tony firmly believed could launch a thousand ships as he reached behind him, tugging the t-shirt over his head and tossing it onto the floor. Tony grabbed onto Steve's wrists, gliding his palms up his beautiful arms to his broad shoulders, then down to his pecs and abs, pleasure shooting through him like an arrow with every tiny hitch in Steve's breath.
A huge thank you to my wonderful betas, allthesinnersandallthesaints, JehBeeEh, and She’sLikeTexas 💗
"It doesn't," Tony said quickly. "But in some of the uber-rich circles people still tend to look down on it, and would be… less than enthusiastic about voting for a presidential candidate with an openly gay son. And this dude's wife likes to rub elbows in those circles, and they tend to donate pretty generously to campaign funds, so…"
Just as JARVIS had reported, Peter appeared to be sleeping peacefully, clutching the stuffed polar bear that Tony had gotten for him as a replacement for the one he had lost when their Malibu home was destroyed. His sweet, round face was relaxed with his lips in a slight pout, something both Tony and Steve had always thought was absolutely precious.
And if that wasn't the weirdest part, Strange's head was also twitching from side to side, almost like he was having a violent seizure.
But how could he tell her that? How could Peter tell her that he still saw her falling to her death nearly every single night as he slept, still saw himself trying desperately to save her, and being just a split second too late.
Throwing the sheets back, Tony's eyes widened as he noticed that they were torn in a couple of spots. He'd heard what he'd thought was a ripping sound while he was giving Steve his initial blowjob the night before, but since his brain had turned to mush pretty much right afterwards he hadn't given it too much thought since then.
"That's the day that Peter goes back to school, Tony, how can they do this? Now we won't be able to be there, and—"
“Well—” Obie started, cutting off when his voice cracked.  He attempted a smile, one that came out looking more like a sneer.
In all the times that he’d been inside the store, Tony had never actually seen the back room where Steve had his living quarters.  Peter had told him it was way too small for someone of Steve’s size to actually be comfortable, and he hadn't been exaggerating.  The doorways were barely wide enough for Steve's shoulders to fit through, with only maybe four or five inches of clearance in the ceilings.
“Are you sure?  Can you honestly say that you're positively sure about that?”  Peter tapped his keyboard, bringing up the original document that discussed the production of the bullets.  “I didn't have to hack into Hammer Industries, Dad, ‘cause this is all on the Stark Industries server.  All of it.”
"Who says I was trying?" Steve asked, his cheeky grin growing even wider as his fingers curled around Tony's hipbones. Tony groaned as Steve licked him again, his hands gripping Steve's hair and his entire body tingling like it was ready to short-circuit.
Without another word, Tony crossed the room to the door and left, making a beeline across the base to his office. He'd just barely managed to get the door closed before the tears began to fall, streaming down his face in hot, salty rivulets. He wanted so badly to believe Steve, believe that he'd meant it when he'd said that he loved him, believe that it was all just some wacky coincidence that Steve had met Peter before he'd even realised who he was, but—
Peter's mind had to alter the memory himself or the experiment would be a failure, only Steve had honestly no clue how he and Tony were going to be able to just watch their boy be tortured by the very same man who should've loved him like a grandson.
"Or maybe you just unleashed one," said Steve. He waggled his eyebrows, then somehow managed to school his features into a look of pure, boyish innocence in about three seconds flat. "Turn right at the next light, then it's the third house on the left side."
"Uhh," Tony stammered, his blood turning cold even as Steve's arm tightened around him. "Yeah, well—"
Steve winced as James's words reverberated around in his head, like one of the silly bouncy balls Peter and Pietro liked to play with up at the Compound. Peter would bounce the ball as hard as he could against the wall of the training dome, counting the seconds until Pietro could catch it, the two of them laughing the entire time.
"You mean, the rest of your classmates are still learning it, right, Pete?" Dad said. "'Cause I'm pretty sure you had the whole scientific method thing down pat by the time you were four."
"I'm afraid I'm going to have to insist that you come with us, Mr Stark," the officer said, all attempts at politeness gone. "Now."
"And it's not like he'd need to talk all that much once he left the airport," said Natasha from her seat next to Gwen. She had graciously loaned Gwen some clothes so at least the poor girl wasn't sitting around in her fancy dress, but it was already after three in the morning and Tony knew she had to be exhausted.
Steve huffs out a sharp breath.  He honestly hasn’t thought much about that battle because he’s still trying to keep it buried deep inside the innermost files of his mind.
“T-Tony,” he says softly a few minutes later.  “For what it’s worth, I’m sorry you have to be stuck down here.  With me.”
"I highly doubt that any design of yours is actually yours," Steve said. "Since we found evidence that you've been stealing from Tony's company for years."
"If it helps you sleep, then it's worth it," Steve said softly. "I'm sure whatever you and Bruce come up with will be of more use anyway."
"Steve—!" Tony exclaimed, but Steve was already there, approaching Peter as if he were a cornered wild animal.
"Me too," Steve grunted. He cupped Tony's cheek in his free hand, turning his head to find his lips as the pleasure swirling inside his body suddenly spiked. "Touch yourself, sweetheart. I want you to come with me."
"Copy that! And here goes nothing!" Tony muttered, squeezing his eyes closed as he circled back around and slammed into the ceiling, sending broken shards of concrete and shingles flying as he broke through, followed shortly by three of the Hammer suits.
“Good.  Now, go on and broaden your mind there, youngling,” Tony said, frowning when Peter giggled.  “What?  I could’ve sworn that I used it the right way this time!”
Steve came to with a start, grimacing at the horrible taste in his mouth as he tried to blink open his eyes, regretting it almost instantly as a sunbeam stretching across his bed hit him square in the face.
Steve gave a nod, curling his arm around Tony's shoulders. "Yes, sir, I think—I think so." It took nearly all of his remaining strength to push himself up to his feet with Tony's help, sucking in a deep breath as he looked over at Colonel Rhodes. "Where's—where's Carol? She's not—she didn't—?"
Ned gave a nod, his face relaxing into a more sympathetic look. "Yeah, okay, but why the hell didn't you say anything to me about it? I had to hear about it from my mom, don't you know how embarrassing that is?"
Several seconds of stunned silence followed O'Brien's command as Joseph and his two wingmen exchanged identical looks of shock. Joseph had been expecting an order to return to base, but the possibility of a ceasefire, a complete cessation of all military activities, was so remote that it hadn't even crossed his mind. The war between Langara and Meridia had been ongoing in some form or another for decades, longer than Joseph had even been alive, and to think that it was just suddenly over… well…
And the way Peter saw it, he could either call his dads and have them call in the team to stop Mr Toomes and whatever he was planning and turn it all into a huge production, or he could take care of them himself and finally prove to his dads that he no longer needed their constant hovering and supervision, and that he was worthy of being a superhero in his own right.
The thought was enough to make Tony's heart slam so hard against his ribcage that he choked, nearly tipping over.
"Oh. Yeah, sure." Peter pushed himself up to a sitting position, watching Uncle Bucky from the corner of his eye as he set up the chessboard on Peter's lap tray. As stoic as Uncle Bucky usually was, Peter could tell that he was struggling now, with his jaw clenched and his lips tightly pursed. He'd ended up being the person who had sat with Peter for most of the night, so he also looked about exhausted as Peter felt, with his skin paler than usual and dark purple circles under his eyes.
"No, no, she's fine," replied Rhodes. "Soon as she came through I told her what happened, so she decided to stay up there with the backup patrollers. She's attempting to locate the source of the beam that hit Captain Barnes, but—"
Something needed to change, and the sooner the better. Unfortunately, aside from the new security measures he was enacting, Tony had no idea where or how.
"Hey," Steve whispered as the tears he'd been holding back finally welled up and spilled over, dripping onto his lap. He tentatively reached for Tony's hand, letting out a gasp of relief when Tony's fingers curled around his.
"Son of a bitch!" Clint grunted as he stepped back to draw another arrow, aiming at the same spot. "This is like some kinda souped up vibranium ice or something!"
Slowly, Steve withdrew his fingers, chuckling as Tony immediately grabbed for his shoulders, pulling him up for a deep, sloppy kiss. "You gonna fuck me now,
"Eh, it's not so bad," Peter said. "It's actually kinda nice to get out of the city every now and then. It's a lot quieter up there."
For a moment Steve could only gape at his friend, knowing that he was absolutely right, but wishing like hell that he wasn't.
"What were you working on?" asked Papa as he set Peter to chopping garlic bulbs and scallions for one of the Italian dishes he liked to make for Dad. Ever since he'd told his dads about the senate bill, Peter had noticed that Papa had been cooking almost all Italian dishes for dinner, almost as though he was afraid that he wouldn't get to for too much longer.
"No, no, I'll get it," said Colonel Rhodes as he sat down next to Carol. "Long as you guys promise to quit whining about it."
"There was a very good reason why that drug was set to be destroyed, Mr Beck," Tony said evenly. "And I don't appreciate the fact that it wasn't."
"Yeah, well, things are a bit different now than they were back in the forties," Uncle James said. "Besides, this is probably one of those dates that isn't really a date-date because if it turns out that they don't like each other as much as they thought they did, then they can just say it was a friends-date instead of a date-date and be done with it."
"Mmm," grumbled Peter. "I was just watching the goofy video from Pietro and Wanda. It's really no big deal."
Tony managed to shower, shave—without nicking himself too, for a change—and dress at near-lightning speed, and as he finished combing his hair into place he stepped back, eyeing his reflection with a critical eye.
"No, it's okay. I just… don't get how this would be possible? You've told me that none of the attempted convoy robberies were actually successful, right?"
And later, how hard he had fought against the Winter Soldier programming HYDRA had tried to install in him, and how he deciphered the HYDRA code that led the team to the hidden Georgia bunker, nearly singlehandedly rescuing Steve from their clutches.
“Um, like so obvious that it’s written all over your face every time you look at him,” replied Peter.  “And Steve’s the exact same way!”
"Yes, I am," Steve murmured as he kissed Tony's neck right below his ear, smirking when Tony let out a full-body shudder. After three years together Steve knew Tony's body like the back of his hand, knew all of his sweet spots, and he never failed to demonstrate that fact when they were being intimate.
"No, you were doing what you thought was best for your son," Steve said firmly. He slid his hand underneath Tony's chin, tipping his head up to meet his eyes. "No parent should ever feel guilty for that, sweetheart. And especially not such an excellent father as yourself."
“Then what was the point of coming here in the first place?” Steve exclaims, his voice rising with every word.  “Are you telling me that Strucker can just hop to another dimension whenever he wants?  ‘Cause if that’s the case, then this whole raid was just a big waste of time!”
"What?" he said, squeezing Peter so hard that he grunted. But Strange was already gone, his final words lingering in the still-settling dust.
"All of it. I heard all of it." He sucked in a deep, rattling breath, swallowing another cough. "So will you please tell me what's happened now?"
"Okay, now you're starting to worry me," Tony said. He brushed his thumb across Steve's knuckles, something that Steve always found soothing. "Did someone say something to you while you were in the kitchen? 'Cause if they did, then—"
Tony's chest was heaving, his entire body flashing with current as he looked up into Steve's eyes, nearly blown black and so filled with unabashed adoration that his heart nearly stopped.
Jumping from the now-useless boat, Tony pulled out his phone as he half-ran, half-slid across the frozen expanse to reach Peter, his knuckles already bruised and bloodied from beating against the now-solid ice.
And whoever was in there messing around was pretty good, Peter had to admit, but they still weren't as good as him. As long as he could keep ahead of them, he should hopefully be able to get JARVIS back up and running.
"Hello?" Peter screamed again, slapping the wall so hard that it sent pain shooting up his arms like a million tiny electrical charges. "Please, someone let me out of here!"
"His name is Doctor Stephen Strange," Steve said, glancing at Sam. His free hand curled into a fist, his jaw twitching as he tried to keep his temper in check. "This is the brain surgeon who refused to come and see Peter when he was sick down in Miami!"
"Will ya just let me help you?" she said as she grabbed the cup, holding it so he could drink from the straw. "You've got two really messed up hands, Steve, so according to Bruce, you shouldn't be grabbing much of anything for a least the next three to five days."
"I've been trying for his entire life, babe, and I'm still not," added Dad. He brushed the hair from Peter's forehead and kissed him, his fingertips rubbing the back of Peter's neck like he loved. "I'm gonna get Papa back to the base now, bud, okay? He needs to rest."
"And we also might want to start thinking about what's going to happen once we've gone through all these names," said Natasha. "I know we're still working on the decryption, and that it's pretty slow-going, but do we have a plan on what to do next?"
"I don't want him to ever be targeted by anyone," Steve blurted out. "I mean, I know we just overthrew our corrupt government and now we'll probably have at least a few years of peace—"
"Can't be too careful though, right, J?" Tony shot back. "Especially where Pete's safety is concerned?"
“I’m fine, Tony,” Papa said, sounding anything but fine as the interface completed its connection.  Not three seconds later the lights dimmed, and the lab was suddenly filled with the dusty debris of a freshly destroyed cement building.  In the middle of the debris sat Papa, dressed in Army fatigues, his face covered in grime and camouflage paint and clutching his right upper leg, which was bleeding through his fingers.  Dad jumped as Papa suddenly froze, gripping Dad’s hand so hard his knuckles went white as Dad started whispering soothing words into his ear.
Steve's heart gave a painful lurch. Now was not the time to be thinking about Riley, and his baby son who would be growing up without a father.
"At least not yet, Captain," said Doctor List. "However, now that you have come to stay with us for awhile, I am hopeful that we have finally reached the end of our failures."
"Mmm," grumbled Ned. "It'll probably mean we won't be able to go see the Lion King when my grandma's in town though."
They were quiet for a few minutes, sipping at their floats as they watched the various people coming in and out of the café. Peter could tell that something else was bothering Papa, but he didn't want to push him too much. Papa would tell him when he was ready.
"That's good, Scott," Steve said evenly. He was trying hard to hold onto his patience, especially since Tony would probably be waking up fairly soon. "So, the Quantum Realm?"
"Goddamnit it all to hell!" Tony shouted, pounding his fists on the counter so hard that he made his keyboard jump. He ripped the glasses from his face, tossing them onto the counter and pinching the bridge of his nose. The headache he'd been trying to keep at bay with copious amounts of coffee was starting to come roaring back, something that he had neither the time nor the fucking patience to deal with.
"Yeah, I'm sure she'll be thrilled," replied Joseph just as his radio crackled to life, followed by the sound of someone clearing their throat.
Steve glanced up at Tony, quirking an eyebrow in question that Tony almost completely missed because he was too busy staring in awe at his drop-dead gorgeous husband. With his sun-bleached blond hair, broad shoulders, strong arms, and ever-so-slightly tanned skin that was currently sprinkled with water droplets from the lake, Steve was every bit the living, breathing image of the most erotic human Tony could ever conjure up in his mind or anywhere else.
“Ah huh, but not the junior high’s, hmm?” Tony muttered.  “Don't wanna give any impression that I might be biased or something.”
And even now, after all the time that had passed, Steve could still hear the echo of Tony's panicked cries in his mind as he attempted to get Peter to take a breath, terrified that he was going to lose the son that he loved more than anything. Tony had later told Steve flat-out that if Peter had died there in that endless sea of sand, he would've refused to go back with them. He would've blamed himself for Peter's death, and all of his will to live would've vanished.
"No, no, it's okay," Tony whispered. "Unlike you I can't get it up again more than every couple hours, so I'm just gonna let you have some fun for awhile first. Sound good?"
"Scott, it's okay," Steve said, squeezing Tony's knee under the table. "Tony gives nicknames to all our teammates."
"Not exactly public, but yeah, it was a Damage Control server," answered Tony. "They wouldn't allow the Iron Legion to be used in guarding the cleanup convoys until they could have their so-called experts look over the design first. And I've made a lot of upgrades since then that they don't know about, but the basic design is still pretty much the same, so—"
Tony was quiet as he stared down at the drawing, his chin quivering as he traced his fingertip across Peter's round cheek.
"Nah, don't thank me, I didn't do anything," Uncle James grumbled. "I do have to be getting back through. Colonel Phillips wants me there when he debriefs the backup patrollers. Captain, you're to call one of the safety officers when you and Tony are ready to head back to the base, got it? Colonel Phillips doesn't want you going anywhere unescorted while you're still healing."
Unfortunately, his desire for expanding the range of the security drones to be able to cover both Peter's school and the route between it and the Tower had hit a rather frustrating roadblock, one that he hadn't yet figured out how to get around. As he had told Steve back in the beginning, the drones were basically a very hi-tech home security system, so stationing them around the Tower and Compound was perfectly fine.
"No!" Steve exclaimed just as a drop of sweat landed right in his eyes. He blinked against the burning hot sting, yanking back on the stick just as he banked hard to the right, managing to manoeuvre behind the missile so he could take it out.
"We're gonna be back here at midnight sharp, okay boys?" Papa said as he turned to face Peter. "Not a minute later. And Peter, if you happen to sense anything weird, anything at all, don't wait to call us. All right?"
“This is Mr Samuel Thomas Wilson, formerly of the U.S. Air Force.  Honourably discharged after two tours, former member of the 103rd Pararescue Unit, and currently working as a counsellor at the Veterans Administration On the Mall in D.C.”  Tony clapped Sam on the shoulder, jerking his head towards Obie.  “Mr Wilson, if you don't mind, could you please inform Mr Stane here what exactly it is that you do down there at the VA?”
"Longing!" the monster roared, his sand-laden foot pressing even harder as Peter attempted to squirm out from underneath it. "Rusted! Furnace! Daybreak! Seventeen—"
"No, we can't," Peter said, grinning as he pulled into the theatre's parking garage. Ned had even already asked Peter if they could go see
"Well, yeah, of course you are," Lang said with a laugh, one that dropped from his face as soon as he glanced in Tony's direction. "Okay, I'll admit that was a pretty dumb thing to say. Anyway, after I mentioned that to Hank, he told me that he'd spent half his life trying to keep his stuff out of the hands of a Stark, and that—"
Peter breathed in, biting down hard on his bottom lip.  This was the question he’d been waiting for.
And, even worse, out here, out from under the strict, watchful eyes of his and Gwen's families, Peter was finding it harder and harder to keep his hands to himself. Papa had given him a ton of lectures on how to be a gentleman ever since he and Dad got married, and Peter had taken them all to heart. But those wise words were currently locked in an intense battle with the desire coursing through his body, and the last thing Peter wanted was to come off as creepy or pushy during he and Gwen's first real date in months.
It had started out awful, even more so than his trip to the scene before Afghanistan. He was in the HYDRA prison, the invisible bunker hidden on the remote Georgia island, under the influence of so many mind-altering drugs and in so much pain from his shattered foot that he could barely stand, much less attempt to fight against what he now knew had been a vision-induced evil version of his own husband.
"Yep, I'm ready," Peter said as he pulled on his jacket and slung his backpack over his shoulder. He stepped back to allow Gwen to get in front of him, smiling when he saw Papa nod in appreciation.
"Don't know if it's good or not, Tony, but I've at least got a location," Clint replied. "About three klicks away from Jekyll Island off the Georgia coast."
Steve was quiet for a moment, his fingertips massaging Tony's scalp so beautifully that Tony couldn't help but let out a soft moan.
Even if that meant playing puppet to a Langaran military government who seemed to be absolutely hell-bent on continuing to punish Howard Stark through his son, despite their own admittance that none of their own scientists or engineers could even come close to what Tony could offer them.
He even had thought to grab some extra napkins, just in case Gwen started to cry towards the end. Auntie Nat had cried when she saw it with him, so he wanted to be prepared.
"Nah, I don't think they know how to quit whining," said Sam. "It's like physically ingrained in them now."
Would fate be so cruel as to take both Tony's son and his husband in one fell swoop, only to leave him behind? Was this the final act of its sick production designed to inflict as much torture on Tony as possible?
"Mmm. Maybe," Tony replied, moaning again when Steve's fingers trailed down to the back of his neck and pressed harder. He slipped his hands underneath Steve's t-shirt again, tipping his head to press an open-mouthed kiss to the underside of Steve's jaw, smirking when Steve's breath hitched.
