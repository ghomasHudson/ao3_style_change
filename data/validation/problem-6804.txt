“Oh my God,” Tony said. He buried his face into his hands with a loud clang of metal hitting metal. “I—I—I don’t think I knew I was doing it with you. To you. “
“You didn't come find me, you ass.” Tony slapped a hand hard on Steve’s hip. Steve jumped but held on tighter with a startled laugh. “So Fury lied to me? Again?” Tony couldn’t even bring himself to be angry at Clint and Natasha anymore. "Lying liars."
"I am sorry for your loss," T'Challa said. "They raised a good son. But Barnes was the unwilling gun. He did not pull the trigger. You know this."
Tony had been tired lately but physically, he looked to be in good health. Steve was aware that Tony had a well-toned physique, having also watched him train hard in the gym, but being peripherally aware and having a naked Tony with only a short towel wrapped low on his hips appear before him were two entirely different things.
“I thought this wasn’t personal,” Tony said, derisive. He gestured at Steve and then at himself. “We’ve covered this. You do you, and I’ll do me. We do what’s best for the Avengers, the world, and try not to kill each other while we’re at it. The Illuminati will look after the gems. You keep being the top cop—”
“Sheriff the Steve!” Tony roared, raising his arms and leaning sideways onto the banister without his usual grace. “My favorite law man, how are you enjoyin’ yourself this fineee night?” He guffawed at his own joke then took one unsteady step down towards Steve.
Tony stopped his pacing at Steve’s raised voice and Steve took the opportunity to close the distance between them.
He gritted his teeth and focused on the state of his teammates. Clint and Natasha had moved away somewhere together, their comms switched off and trackers disabled halfway towards the Quinjet. There was a burned circle of runes in the middle of the street; Thor had evidently taken off somewhere by way of Heimdall and the rainbow brick road. And Steve—
“He…I…” the agent tried to say before his breath was taken by the blood again. Steve took the dirty cloth from the trolley and wiped the blood from the agent’s mouth. He dropped it on the handle of the knife after he was done and kept his eyes away from the red-stained teeth that bared at him.
Steve drew his hand out just a little, the warmth with the back of his hand. He pressed down firmly when Tony’s back arched off the seat again. Tony let out a rasping laugh that turned into another moan when Steve resumed his stroking.
Sam hears Steve sigh through the comms. Steve’s given up on telling them off for chatter on the comms. Swearing, amusing sarcastic remarks, and general horsing around was common on their comms and the law enforcement they’ve worked with have received it with mixed responses.
Tony only giggled harder. He was aware that he was probably freaking Steve out, so he shook his head and drew away, turning to rest his hands on the conference table, letting the hysteria subside into gurgling chokes as he tried to control his breathing. Steve stood behind him, a hand rubbing gently on Tony’s back as Tony tried to regain his sanity. Tony thrilled at the casual touch. It was something Steve would do. And now he could. He really could.
Tony looked down at his chest, where the arc reactor, Steve’s anchor, glowed bright. “Mind giving it a poke?” He tapped at the arc reactor. “I feel like crap and the last time you touched it, it made me feel less crap. Energized and all that.” Tony looked away, flushing a little, grin faltering. “But, uh, if it weirds you out—“
“Mister Stark,” Steve said firmly and tugged his arm out of Stark’s death-grip as gently as he could. “You mind explaining what you’re doing?”
They arrived at the conference on time only because of Happy's not-strictly-legal cutting of street corners. Steve didn't notice. Tony's hair was still dishevelled but in Steve's opinion, it only made him more beautiful. Tony looked relaxed, loose, and all entirely because of Steve. He was also in a new tuxedo suit, one more suited for the occasion, the first one having been crumpled and stained with their combined efforts after Steve had thrown him over a row of brightly colored ties and fucked him until the shelves broke. Steve was of the opinion that he should have worn it anyway. Tony had feigned a scandalized gasp but followed it with a string of lewd suggestions about being 'entertainment' for the crowd. Steve had taken off his own tie and fastened it around the base of Tony's cock in a fit of possessiveness, its loose ends tucked neatly into Tony's briefs. And suddenly, that door had also opened -- Tony was his to claim, his to mark.
T'Challa took the opportunity to survey the condition of the armor. There were marks and dents all over but they were the most concentrated at the chest plate where the paint was scratched down to silver. This had been a vicious fight between friends. All three of them could have died. It was a fortunate situation, then, that the greatest physical damage was to the Soldier's prosthetic arm and to the Iron Man suit. As for emotional damages – damages to friendships and loyalties – that was less certain. Maybe they could heal from this. Maybe they couldn't. The drive for vengeance, for empty victories, takes more than life away – it takes the soul with it. T'Challa almost lost his. He would not let it take more.
Steve really wanted to shake Tony. This must be what Bucky had felt. “It’s because you don’t remember them. You never remember them.”
the Containment Unit away; there was no need to go to such lengths. He only wanted to poke around the Unit.
Steve waited for Tony’s reply, watching Tony's eyes carefully, trying to read the reactions in them as he’d always been able to. There was uncertainty there – the same uncertainty that was always present when Tony revealed too much of his deepest secrets. The same uncertainty that had been in Tony’s eyes the morning after at the breakfast table, when Steve had hoped and hoped one of them would have just said something. As Steve continued to watch, he saw the uncertainty in Tony’s eyes give way to something like understanding, hope, and then finally joy.
“It might’ve skipped dimension at the last minute?” Bruce guessed. “These O.D. Traps work - the other one is in its Trap. We might need to take this one to Richards, just to be sure.”
Steve takes the contraption and gives it an exaggerated once-over, but his admiration for seven-year-old Tony’s heart and accomplishment is genuine. “You’ve done well, Tony,” Steve says.
Steve frowns and looks around. The details are a little different; there are benches where no benches had been, and there is a distinct lack of the Iron Man armor. He looks down and sees that Tony looks different, too. His hair is curlier, longer, and his goatee is in a different style. His eyes are also bloodshot and his face is pallid from lack of sleep.
” He gave one last squeeze at Tony’s wrists, then calmed himself and sat back onto the chair to enjoy the sight of Tony before him.
Even though Steve had looked like he was drowning in his one best suit, he'd loved the look of it if only because it was the one he would see the most often. He loved the idea of it. The fabric frayed over the years and somehow the threadbare smoothness of it had only made Steve love it more. He'd pretended it was one of those patterned silk numbers with the broad shoulders and sharp lines he'd seen the rich men wearing over in Manhattan or in the pictures, or one of the nicer jackets Bucky sometimes put on for nights out dancing. Those richly cut fabrics looked striking on the imposing figures of men who had money and power to show it. If his eyes had lingered on the stretch of fabric across the flex of a man's biceps or the subtle bulge underneath the smooth front of fitted pants, well, it wasn't a problem for him. Steve never thought he would have the chance to be there in the spotlights with them or rub shoulders with them.
Steve mumbled something about Tony being crass and didn’t make to move. It would have been more effective if he wasn’t also kneading slowly at Tony’s ass.
He left the shower in simple cotton pants and shirt, taking his place at his primary workstation. Biology wasn't his area of expertise but he knew enough to conduct these experiments.
He’d learned about psychokinetic energies, their different classes of manifestation, how to detect them, how to capture them, how to eliminate them. He’d found one of the men involved in both major Ghost incidences, one Dr. Egon Spengler, but the correspondence had been cut short and his trove of knowledge had stopped with the disappearance of the scientist. He’d made do with investigating the paranormal on the side, as a hobby.
Thankfully, the neighborhood is quiet at this time and the streets are mostly empty. Only the cats are awake to hear Tony’s surprisingly steady-voiced cursing and maudlin.
“All right,” Tony began, desperately scrambling together a response. “We’re both under some kind of influence. I’m trying very, very hard to figure out exactly what this influence is so that I can figure out a fix and be very, very sure that when we
Back at the Tower, Maria was waiting for them in the landing bay and Tony ignored her look of complete shock at what must have been a magnificent sight of Captain America attempting to make out with the Iron Man suit.
“You need your sleep,” Steve said firmly, lowering his hand. “You haven’t been dealing with this. I’ve seen your photographs from two years ago. Hell, from two months ago. You look terrible and I only met you one month ago.”
“Lucid dreaming, Cap,” Tony says. He pokes at Steve’s chest. Steve sways back at even the small amount of force behind that gesture and Tony laughs, looking at his own finger. He looks up at Steve again, excited. “I was going to let you test it out after a little more practice on my end but it looks like everything’s working. This is a dream, right? I’m lucid and in control?”
Tony continued to nudge at Steve’s shoulder, punctuating each prod and poke with small nudges of his hips and kisses feathered beneath Steve's jaw. He let his hands roam like he'd always wanted to when they'd been in bed together, cataloguing all of Steve's sensitive spots, where Steve leaned into his touch, where Steve shivered at the contact. The familiar feeling of – dare he say it –
“Whoa, whoa, whoa,” Sam cuts in, raising his hands. “That almost sounded Stark-like. Hey I have an idea. Why don’t you take Tony there if the man comes by for a visit?”
the rub of fine wool against his cheeks, beneath his lips. The scratch of satin under the scrape of his nails.
to trust you and tell you everything about my private life that you don’t want any part of anymore—“
Tony woke screaming. Bruce’s anxious face was hovering over him but behind his eyelids, Tony could see the image of Steve hovering above him instead, shield pressing into the neck of his hijacked ghostly self.
He blinked, and he was standing in Tony’s workshop back at the tower, shield miraculously still in his hands. He looked around and saw a head of messy brown hair poking over the headrest in one of Tony’s vintage cars. Steve hesitated but made his way towards Tony. When he reached the car, he saw Tony had a cheek resting on a close fist, arm braced over the door. His eyes were closed but they looked red-rimmed, dark circles beneath them.
“There,” Tony said. “Now we’re equals. This is normal.” He squinted at Steve. “Friends do this kind of thing.”
It was the day before Valentine’s Day and the weather had finally taken a turn for the good. PLASM had been receiving increasingly frantic calls about ‘inappropriate behavior’ out in broad daylight and the Avengers have once again been called out for a Slime containment mission.
Steve snored once and continued to sleep on. It couldn’t be comfortable, but it was better than what it was before.
Who was Tony, to deprive Steve of that? He’d started to fall so hard, so fast, he hadn’t even realized that there could’ve been no one there to catch him when he did.
They walk in and Steve, through the haze, can make out a large study with two opposing walls of shelves filled with books and blueprints and other paraphernalia. The desk at the centre dominates and Howard is standing over it, plotting something out on a large map spread over the entire desk. Howard looks good for his age; he must be about sixty now and his hair is still mostly brown.
It was in the way Steve caught the beginnings of ferocity of Tony’s passion, lips bitten until they were swollen, fighting and fighting until Tony had his way and Steve was left helpless in the trails of his blaze; the way Steve had to battle for control, repaying each heated stroke of tongue with an answering nip from his teeth, tempering and tempering until they found a rhythm once again.
As was sometimes the case, Tony had to travel for business. The hour before these business trips would be spent with Steve in a suit, then out of it. And once Tony was in the air over one of the oceans, Steve would be lying on their bed, his feet still tangled in the sheets as he buried his face into the cooled lining of Tony's suit with a sleeve wrapped around his cock, rutting into the fabric to Tony's scent until he saw stars. And if the suit was too stained even after a thorough cleaning, well, Steve tried to not feel too guilty about the number of suits that met this fate.
“Stay in the room,” Tony begged, desperate. “Give me twenty-four hours. Twenty-four. I’ll figure this out.” Tony gave one last look at the spit-shiny redness of Steve’s lips and left with a blast of repulsors before he could be enticed even further.
Bruce smiles and turns towards to doors leading inside, Thor a step behind him. But before he could take two steps, a hand catches his upper arm and he tenses as he turns around. Pietro draws back a little and lets go of his arm but keeps his eyes on Bruce.
It was in the way Steve could steer Tony backwards to press him against the nearest wall; the way Tony closed his eyes and let himself be guided, hands running heatedly across Steve’s waist to pull them closer together; the way Tony opened his mouth for Steve, and the way he pressed into Steve like he was giving Steve new life with his breath and the beating of his heart.
It was during the times when they parted ways that Steve knew there could have been something more between the two of them. They’d never addressed it, but Steve could feel it missing from his life like a lost limb. Every time he managed to get Tony back to his side – every time he fought against his own demons, fought against Tony’s demons – he felt that spark renew between them as if it had never dimmed and it burned brighter than it ever had. Steve took what he could, relishing the time he spent with Tony, savoring each and every one of Tony’s small touches and vowing to keep himself worthy of the trust given by a man who didn’t hand out trust so easily.
It was all this, and all in the way they came together again and again, in the dance of lips and tongue, the play of hands on skin and hair, so familiar yet novel. It reflected a lifetime and it spelled a future.
And Tony had blasted out the back wall of his shop, taking the small shed at the back of Starnes Saving & Loan with it. Starnes had yelled at him and then taken him to Steve’s office, demanding justice and recompense.
“You’re the thing from the ice,” Steve realized. “You were with me. You, in Tony’s dreams.” This couldn’t be Tony. Tony was behind him. Bruce was tending to Tony. Tony was
It had been another normal day in Timely. The sun was still hot in the late afternoon and the roads were dry and dusty.
Tony almost bit his tongue, caught between laughing and matching the retort, and he dropped a few feet through the air.
? Yeah, I’m not. I’m going to study this thing by studying myself, gather some data, and by the time I'm not constantly distracted by fantasies about fucking you into every solid surface in the Tower and beyond, maybe I can come to a conclusion as to what exactly the kid pulled on us and maybe get a paper or two out of it in a journal that wouldn’t mind accepting prolonged, repeated masturbation as a variable. Bruce was on the editorial board of a few of them so maybe I have a chance if they still accept the word of Hulk. He knows more about this than me. Your turn.”
Out of the corner of his eye, he sees land approaching. It isn’t right. He knows he put the plane into the ice. He’d knocked the Cube from the Skull with his shield. He went down with the plane. He
“Good work, team,” Steve’s voice came over the comms. “Thor needs help with the Colonel. They’re on west 45
Steve reached through Tony’s hands into the arc reactor but he couldn’t feel anything there. He couldn’t feel the tug of the anchor anymore.
Natasha clicks her tongue at him. “Tony,” she says, “If you want opportunities, just come up into the compound instead of meeting me here in town every time.” She leans over and places a hand over his restless fingers and feels them still under her palm. “We all miss seeing you in person.”
Steve nodded, not surprised in the least that Tony did remember the first time. They hadn’t been together then, and they hadn’t gotten together after it, but it had been one of those things Steve often thought back on. He had always wondered what might have happened if he’d taken that extra step further, if he had only just asked Tony for a date. Just a single date, a single chance, before everything had fallen apart around their ears.
That was fair. "I give you my word as the Black Panther, and the to-be King of Wakanda. I will not turn you, either of you, over to the mercy of the Accords."
Tony laughs but moves to sit back into his car. He looks wistful, but she won’t force him. “I wasn’t kidding about the pug,” Tony says, then sits back in and rolls down the window to look back up at her. “But I’ll keep what you said in mind.”
With a sigh, Jim walks back in and crouches by the head of the bed. Tony squints his eyes open again and blinks a few times at Jim.
“Uh. This might not be the best time for talking. I’ll—I’ll come back tomorrow. Give you your twenty-four hours. Good night, Tony.”
“I know,” Steve says with a sharp gesture, “but I thought I- we could all help him through it. He should know we don’t blame him.”
JARVIS kindly took them up to the penthouse and Tony deposited Steve at the door to their bedroom. Steve tried to pull him in but Tony in the suit was always stronger and he pushed Steve away with ease.
Try as he might, but he found it hard to separate his civilian life as Steve Rogers from his Avenging life as Captain America. There were opportunities every day almost paraded before him, but he could never bring himself to take them. Did he present himself as Steve Rogers? Did he present himself as Captain America? The war never taught him how to deal with his dual identities because even his down time had mostly involved being shot at or kissing babies under flashbulbs. Peggy knew, but Peggy was also miles away in a rest home and only remembered him every other visit.
This was how war was always written, with the winners on a pedestal and the losers cast to damnation. No one ever remembered why a war began until it was too late. Steve knew this intimately; he’d died for his country, in a war that would have taken more lives than if he had not. It had been a small price to pay, to lose all that he held dear in a past life and to live on without it in this new one. He’d been elevated to something close to sainthood, the deaths of millions swept aside to wave his exploits of bravery as a symbol of victory and superiority. Steve hated it, hated the lies, but he’d lived with it because in the end, it had been worth it.
Tony wakes to the press of dry lips on his shoulder. He burrows deeper into the pillow and tries to go back to sleep.
Again, he found no biological changes. He noted that his heart rate and brain waves were almost at baseline while he'd been speaking with Steve the day before. That didn't explain why picturing Steve in his mind could make him come untouched. He couldn't explain anything. He was failing all the cognitive tests because he just couldn’t
Steve coughed, and Tony drank in the sound and the feeling of its vibration at his lips. “They always had me. I couldn’t be revived, until. Until I'd moved on.”
“Anti-Slime platoon in position on the perimeter,” Natasha said through the comms. “On your mark, Cap.”
“Barton wouldn’t let me take a closer look, not like I needed to look further to figure out how it worked but he did imply that I was lacking in fancy gadget inventions so I took it upon myself to prove him wrong. Not that I would ever make a mechanical quiver of all things but perhaps something more elegant, more discrete. And so,” Tony raised his left, sooty hand and waggled his fingers at Steve. Steve stopped his shuffling and looked intently at Tony’s hand. Tony flexed his wrist back and pinched down his pinky and ring finger at the same time. The holder slid along its track smoothly down Tony’s wrist and stopped with a snap and turn right over his palm.
Thirty seconds later, Tony had finished digging the trench and watched as three Quinjets flew in to hover at the periphery, dropping suited PLASM agents to the ground each with a giant tank on their back and a massive hand held cannon.
Steve took in the car around them, the distances, the space. “Let’s try,” he breathed, and pushed at the anchor, moving with Tony as Tony landed on his back on the car seat with an
Steve spread Tony wider with his knees then gave a single, sharp thrust up into Tony’s tight heat. Tony cried out again, but got Steve’s point, and started up the pace again, arms bracketing Steve and braced on the armrest, lifting and falling onto Steve’s cock with wild abandon. Steve dipped his head to mouth at the skin of Tony’s shoulder. The salty musk, the hint of iron, made him groan and he thrust once, hard, into Tony as Tony pressed down onto him.
Tony stopped pacing and glared at Bruce with a levelled finger. “We’re going to the helicarrier. You’re my eye witness. We’re going to get answers.” He ignored Bruce’s protest, went to pick up Steve’s shield, and marched out towards the elevator for the hanger and a Quinjet.
was standing there with his hand still outstretched. He was outlined by the doorway, with the light from the corridor glowing around him in a parody of Tony’s final moments with Steve. Tony tensed his hand on his phone but didn’t initiate the emergency protocols. He straightened and brushed his other hand down his jacket, not to smooth out the nonexistent creases, but for an excuse to look away from the man standing before him.
to this new time - and Steve had never really dwelled on physical appearances anyway. He’d never thought Tony would be conscious of it either.
“More turned on than I have ever been in my life. My arm’s ready for the Masturbation Olympics. You?”
“As good as it can get, with Tony insisting on footing the bill. And it’s Bruce, Thor,” Bruce corrects gently. “Midgardian customs don’t require you to address me with my occupational title. Especially if you’re a friend.”
And Tony’s erection was perking up again. “How can you be sure it’s not the bullshit very unscientific sex whammy talking?” he asked, just to be extra sure. God, he wanted to be sure. He wanted it to be real. He wanted
Steve had a confused expression but was holding it back with a smiling grimace and Tony almost felt like laughing again.
“I had Natasha show me some public records of you. But I don’t know about,” Steve tapped at his own chest to mirror the arc reactor on Tony, “that. How you got it. Why you got it.”
That’s—that’s Tony with his legs around Steve, pressed up against the doors to the Media Room. And. Oh Lord. That’s Steve moaning into their kiss. And—
He nosed behind Tony’s ear, then pressed himself to Tony’s entrance. Tony nodded at his pause and slowly, he eased himself into the clinging heat of
He needed more data. He should get some data out of Steve but only once he felt like he could do it without his dick leading him in other directions.
Steve is in a cave lit from above by an open patch of ceiling. Tony is clutching at a rectangular black box. It was plugged into his chest.
“Good enough for me,” Tony says, clicking his fingers again, and they end up back in Tony’s room, this time without the sculpture. Tony nods at the space and turns back to Steve, expression serious. “I can’t do this long. I really have been practicing, but it’s still hard to concentrate so let’s make this quick.”
like it when you’re not prudish.” He cut himself off before he could go into exact detail on how not-prudish he would like Steve to be. Christ, how had he ever thought Steve to be prudish?
Madrox had been belatedly put on the emergency list as he had been chasing a petty villain from their Earth back and forth. The villain, a recently awakened mutant, had thrown Carol through a building before two dozen of Madrox’s duplicates piled on him and took him down through sheer quantity. They’d locked the villain away but Carol had spoken to Madrox then relayed the news to Steve before going with Madrox to the Earth in question.
“Nice to meet you,” Tony said without looking up. He couldn’t look. “Enjoy your stay. So. New member. I got it. Nice being updated. I’ll see you when I see you.” And he turned tail and left the room.
break it with Steve? He could take the Iron Man suit to extremes but this was all on Tony the man, not Tony in the tin can, and Tony the man couldn't just make his hang-ups go away with a well placed repulsor blast? He was…waiting for the right time to broach the subject?
Tony sighed and walked around to the door. “You two, get out,” he said with a shooing motion. “Why are you still in my house? Take Steve, do your introductions. Scan him, interrogate him, cross-check with Fury, whatever. I’ve got cold sweat to wash off and since you insist on waiting on me, I expect coffee and a full breakfast waiting for me when I come out.” He held the door open for them and they filed past with matching eye rolls.
yourself.” He reached up and tugged Tony’s hands away from where they were fumbling at his belt and put them firmly on the desk, letting Tony bend over and press his ass into Steve’s groin. Steve kept his hips still, but squeezed hard on Tony’s wrists when Tony tried to grind back. “Keep this position. Open yourself. Make it
Tony looked up and saw Steve staring back at him, wide-eyed. Steve immediately withdrew his hand and took a hasty step back.
Tony huffed. “I’m going to take the day off tomorrow. Have Larry-what’s-his-name cancel everything. Lounge in the sun.” Maybe take a more private bath, this time making sure Steve was far, far away….
Stark shrugged, the movement carefully smooth, and returned to looking out the car window at the passing scenery. There was a muscle ticking in his jaw, a giveaway that he was feeling anything other than indifference. Or it could be him trying to conceal the pain Steve knew he was in. It had been a week ago but Steve knew where every one of the hurts were spread across Ton—across Stark’s body. After all, he was the one to have put them there.
What was it that Spengler’s old files had hypothesized? That the ghosts they’d dealt with were simply the remnants of souls which had moved on. Souls. The essence of human life. It was no wonder that Steve had been more human than any Class Three or Four haunting had ever been. They were remnants, imprints; but Steve had been
. He was going to investigate this first, get rid of its effects, and then think about his romantic life choices—
The world tilted in slow motion and Steve was staring up at the haloed blue sky, the rough asphalt beneath him, Tony’s weight on top of him, Tony’s good hand weakly grasping at the sleeve of his bound arm. And Steve’s world narrowed; he cast away the panicked shouting of the guards, the searing heat of the ground, the million implications, and he focused on the dwindling labored gasping of Tony’s breath and the pooling wet warmth at his neck and chest, trying to catch those last words.
“Well,” Bruce says, indicating his little basket, “I’m going to find everyone else. These cookies are from Laura. I’ll put them out for everyone.”
Tony sighed and proceeded to as Steve ordered. He’d only been catching a breather, even if the trench digging was simple work.
“—Nine to Five every other Thursday, Tony. I know. And you’re not a consultant anymore so don’t pretend otherwise.”
"Fractured skull, he had," Stark said in a hollow voice as if reciting a list. "Multiple fractures, large and small all over his face, and splinters of bone in his brain. She had a broken humerus, five broken ribs all along the right side, punctured lung, a broken neck from severe whiplash and a crushed larynx from the
“And speaking of souls,” Natasha turned to Tony, “Steve here said you were being attacked by something when he showed up?”
Tony could only whimper as the numbness reached his throat and then his cheeks. Everything was blurring at the edges and he couldn’t feel his body. As his vision slowly tunneled to a point, he thought he saw a streak of color sweep through the darkness.
There was the sound of a single distant gunshot – something hit the car behind Steve – and Tony let out a pained choke and coughed into Steve’s neck.
This was not a productive line of thought. Had anything like this even happened before between a ghost and a man? Maybe he could ask Natasha to dig the archives—
He kept his eyes between Tony’s legs, on the peek of a reddened cock swinging heavily between them. There was a tearing noise and Steve looked up to see Tony emptying a packet of lube onto his fingers. Tony gave Steve a sultry look over his shoulder then arched his back, pushing his ass out towards Steve, and started massaging at his entrance with his wet fingers.
The battle had raged on around him, after he had taken one hit too many. Above him, skeletal parodies of angels were battling Earth’s Mightiest. Steve saw Sam, wings spanning wide, as he dodged the sharp scythe-like wings of the Fallen. From the edges of his vision, he saw the glow and crackle of lightning and thunder as Thor lit the skies around her. A beam of red fanned the sky and two of the Fallen fell, succumbing to their name. The ground shuddered and a familiar roar reverberated through the dusty air.
Tony shuffles in his seat and looks away. One day she’ll get him comfortable enough to 'talk about feelings' as he frequently puts it. One day at a time, though.
– and he still needed more. He needed to get closer, he needed—he rocked his hips forward and realized the problem immediately.
That night when Tony slept, Steve stayed in bed with him and watched the glow of the light in Tony’s chest, the glow of Tony’s heart.
Tony gave a brief thought to being the filling in that blond sandwich before taking his brain out of the gutter to focus on the task at hand.
Stroking gently at Steve’s hair, he ran the memory of their conversation from just before this session against the wall. Steve was an even bigger sap than he was, if those last words were anything to go by, and somehow it made Tony’s heart dance to know that his sentiment was returned. This was something he always could have had, whammy or no, and now he had a half-naked Steve between his thighs to think objectively about.
The guards hesitated, but nodded and backed away. Steve remembered that Tony and Richards had been the ones to set up this prison in the first place. Fitting, how he was always going to be surrounded by Tony from now on. He should hate it.
Tony flinched back from him at that and Steve felt a moment of both triumph and regret at the look of hurt on his face. The mask of indifference was back on in the next instant and Tony stepped away.
“Big Guns,” Steve confirmed. “We’ll blast from the east. Thor, keep him off the Library and tip him west. Hawkeye, a trip stream and capture streams. Widow, set the Trap at the centre of the lawn, where the thick of the torso would be. Tony, explosives on the torso. Thor, lightning to follow. Clear?”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Jim says with a straight face and takes another drink. “Besides, your messages were getting a little pathetic. An intervention was in order.”
Steve had never been one for pulling corks. As he looked on to Tony’s drunken tomfoolery in the noisy space of the inn, he really wished he could say the same for Tony. As it stood, Steve himself would just stick to the cider.
Giant Colonel Sanders let out a roar and swiped a large hand at Tony just as Tony flew in to fire a few proton shots at the Colonel’s eyes.
The Captain lowered his arms fractionally, but it was the Soldier who pushed forward to stand between them. Even beaten bloody and missing a metal arm, there was a fire in his eyes that T'Challa hadn't seen before. It was the eyes of a man who wanted to make amends and T'Challa knew this feeling intimately.
Crap. “Me and Nat.” Steve looks at him hard. “And Rhodes.” Steve narrows his eyes at him.  “And Vision. That’s all, I swear.”
The bombers are going to unleash their payload on the entire eastern sea board. Steve is going to fail. Steve is going to die for nothing.
The first time it had happened, Steve himself hadn’t been all that awake to process it. They’d been in the drawing room of Avengers Mansion late one night, Steve reading, and Iron Man looking over schematics of something complicated. Iron Man had asked for some creative input from Steve, Steve had moved to help, they’d both sat down on the small two-seater, and the next thing Steve knew a warm weight had lifted from his side and the sun was up again.
“I’m not coherent in the mornings,” Tony said. “And I’m not—I’m not coherent when I’m tired. Or hungry. Or both.”
With a gentle tug, Steve pulled Tony's pants down to expose the curves of Tony's ass. He refastened the fly, tightened the side fastenings, and gave a slap to Tony's ass to tell him to widen his stance. Tony yelped but spread his legs at Steve's urging, until the pants were securely held in place behind his balls, underneath the crease where Tony's ass met thigh.
But no one was in the wrong here, and T'Challa had already made his promise to do right by the Soldier. He nodded. "I have restrained Zemo and left him tied to a beam at the entrance. I have also taken the liberty of gagging him. He shouldn't be awake, but if you take him and secure him to the Quinjet, it'll be easier for us all."
He continued his pace, now sucking hard with every stroke. Tony was quivering in his hold, letting out an endless stream of breathless moans. Steve pulled back one last time then took a deep breath and let Tony sink deep into this throat again. He pressed his tongue along the underside, rubbing the vein roughly, and he swallowed hard while teasing on the skin behind Tony's balls at the same time.
A green glow from the arc reactor flared, permeating the lab and Tony’s vision. A numbness was crawling from his chest and he felt a weakness in his limbs but he forced himself to stay upright, waiting. The green glow coalesced in streaks of light into a small green stone before him, and Tony used the last of the strength in his limbs to grab at it with his hands, holding it to his chest. Taking its power for himself.
Vanko laughed and Tony saw a gnarled hand thrust forward straight into his chest. The pain was blinding, and a chilling numbness spreading from his chest as Vanko’s fist closed over his heart.
Before Steve could make his predicament heard, he was tumbled sideways to the ground with Tony's thighs still clamped around his chest. He found himself staring up at the grey sky haloed around the brim of his hat on Tony's head. The taste of Tony was still on his tongue, and he was still hard and breathless, but he started guffawing in earnest. Tony gave him a devious grin and Steve couldn't help but laugh even harder. Figures he couldn’t keep Tony Stark tied down for any length of time.
do anything, it’s of our own accord, and not because some kid threw a hissy fit and made us do it. I refuse to be controlled by something that does not have at least some kind of scientific explanation because, let me tell you, I am
“So,” Tony said, sitting down and kicking his feet up onto Steve’s desk, “Feel up for a game of rummy?”
Steve bit back his defense. For a moment, he panicked. He knew Tony didn’t have any memories of the months following Steve’s ‘death’ or of the Civil War that preceded it, but maybe there was more to it than Maria, Ms. Potts, and Rhodey had explained. Except everything they’ve said and everything Steve had needed to do to revive Tony from that brain delete pointed to Tony valuing this friendship too much to simply wipe….
“I am unharmed!” Thor’s voice came through the comms again, crackling a little, and Tony heard a breath of relief released from all of them. “His fists are fast for his size. It seems the loss of his steed has angered him.”
“No. Not that. I want us to stop hiding from each other. I want us to stop jumping to conclusions. I want us to trust each other and tell each other—“
He felt Tony shuddering around him, a wetness dripping from where they were still joined. He almost regretted not bringing a condom to limit the mess but he felt a thrill at having a part of him kept inside Tony outside of their neglected bedroom. He would never stop thrilling at how willing Tony was to let Steve fill him like this. He would always be willing to be filled by
The sky was burning. Everything was burning. Steve coughed wetly and crawled over to where Jessica lay. He shook her gently, calling her name but she didn’t wake, strands of dark hair tangled over her face. He made sure that she was breathing steadily before turning onto his back with difficulty to take in the chaos around him, above him.
“I feel it, Tony,” Steve continued, looking behind himself. “There’s something pulling me towards it. That light. I can’t not go to it.” He looked back at Tony, eyes downcast. “I can’t stay.”
Steve was a patient man when he wanted to be, and he would sit through this until Tony looked at him with bright, happy eyes again. “Tony, can you honestly say that you’ve figured out every aspect of the paranormal? We don’t even know why ghosts exist. We don’t even know the meaning of life. This is what I want and I think that’s enough, don’t you?”
Bruce brought the Quinjet to a hover above the Library and the Colonel turned its massive head toward the noise of the engines. An angry frown formed on its burnt and pitted face and it took one step forward with a hand reaching for the jet.
Steve shook his head at Tony, and indicated the Trap with the tip of his own boot. “You slammed into the ground, hard. And you were too close to the Trap’s opening. It could’ve hurt you.”
Bruce spots Pietro skulking by the control station towards the side of the hangar and makes his way there. Thor follows, apparently picking up on the same undercurrent as Bruce had. They'll leave the lovebirds to fly by themselves.
Tony should have known. They'd never figured out Steve's way to move on. Why couldn't it have been something like 'find the shield'? Being anchored to the vibranium in Tony's should have been a dead giveaway.
“Onwards, then?” Thor says. Bruce shuts the door and they move on. If not reading in the library, then maybe arts in the Craft Studio.
Tony snuffles into her shoulder and she shushes him quietly, turning a corner away from Steve. Steve stands in the doorway to Howard’s study, staring after her. He thinks he knows this woman. But maybe it is her mannerisms he knows. This was how Tony acted in those moments he let his guard down, moments Steve has been witnessing more and more.
He continued to squeeze at Tony's ass with his left hand until he decided that he wanted another prize. Reaching around, he nudged a leg between Tony’s thighs and ground the heel of his palm into Tony's hardening cock while his right hand continued to roam Tony’s torso, sliding up to finger the Asolsa Lucida before moving on to loosen the silk red tie and start undoing the buttons of Tony's shirt. Tony, ever the stubborn man, kept talking business, only barely pressing his ass back against Steve's hard cock. Steve could feel him straining to hold still, his thighs stiff with the effort to keep still and his fingers twitching slightly in their gestures mid-air as he continued to ignore Steve's attempts to make him surrender.
He pushes at the bed with a hand and rolls himself on top of Steve. Steve’s hands find their way to massaging at his hips and Tony takes full control of the kiss, hands rubbing up and down Steve’s neck and jaw.
“All right, Avengers,” Steve says, finally. “Focus on getting that bomb off of Quicksilver. Lambda formation, War Machine and Vision take point. If the target gets past the peaks, switch to Sigma and pinch him in.”
Steve only laughed, clearly having felt Tony’s response at those words. “Right. Not your style. How could I forget.”
Tony walked right past Maria after his thorough report, tugging a very pliant Steve along into the elevator. He couldn’t help but feel an irrational surge of pride and smugness when Steve didn’t even give Maria a single look.
To each of them, it was their second kiss. But it was the first one they’d shared together. It was the first one they’d both leaned in towards. Into each other and without hesitation.
“What was that?” Steve’s voice came through the comms, shaken and so breathtakingly arousing. “What did she do? Something’s not right.”
The rubble around him shook and Steve heard the sound of repulsors in flight. He looked above him and saw a familiar glow fly towards him. His heart stuttered then beat faster and he watched on as the glow drew closer and closer. And as the sound of repulsors grew louder, Steve realized it wasn’t what he had expected. What he had wanted.
“Oh my God. Oh my God. Why didn’t you say anything? You could’ve said something. You didn’t have to sit through that for—for
Stark was in a crumpled heap of man and metal inside the compound and T'Challa had never seen a sight so small and lonely. There were scorch marks in the concrete and gouges littered over every surface around and on Stark and the only other spot of color was at T'Challa's feet. Even as T'Challa stepped over the red, white, and blue shield Stark had his eyes on, it didn't seem like Stark was aware he was no longer alone. T'Challa stood a little ways off to the side, giving the man just enough space not to feel closed in, but not enough to attempt an exit without hindrance – he couldn't let Stark continue his chase, but he could understand the man's need to grieve in silence.
Okay, well, Tony could do that first. He had JARVIS pull up the data that had been collated from his past few hours of isolation and he slowly read the details out loud. As his focus turned away from Steve, the arousal that had been simmering during their conversation flared back into life. Tony gritted his teeth and pushed through. For Steve’s sake. For his own.
“Captain Rogers has left the hallway and is heading back to the penthouse, sir.” JARVIS supplied before Tony could ask. There was a hint of exasperation in his voice and Tony couldn’t blame him.
In the end, though, it didn’t really matter, because he was still the one who was getting to have spectacular sex with Steve. Witch kid could suck it.
He ground slow and deliberate against Steve's erection. “Bedroom?” he asked innocently. "I'm already prepped, loose." He wriggled his hips. "You could push right in." He delighted in Steve's full body shudder and broken moan.
Tony had started joining in on active missions as Iron Man, more for the team’s sake - so Steve could be visible to them - than for field observation for the equipment he was developing. He’d spent the past three weeks trying to refine a freeform magnetic beam redirector. That Class Five had dodged linear beams with ease and if he had to see Steve’s face at the destruction of those supposedly priceless pieces of art again, he’d have to take up painting himself just to replicate them for Steve’s artistically inclined soul. As it was, he would settle on trying to prevent it from happening ever again, hence the beam redirectors. He’d only managed a wide angle curve of their proton beam weaponry but he knew he could make it do better if he could only figure out a mechanism to extend and shape the magnetic fields into something like nets.
Beside Tony, Cap sighed and stood straight again, hands resting on his belt buckle. “Thank you.” He looked at each of them in turn, eyes lingering on Tony’s arc reactor. “To answer Tony’s earlier questions, I don’t know how I got here, I don’t know how long I’ve been around, and I knew Howard reasonably well.” He shrugged. “Wasn’t a hard man to figure out.”
The sun hadn’t yet set and the floor was dark enough that Steve could only just make out the silhouette on the couch in the center of the open living space. He trusted that Tony was aware of his presence – had been alerted as soon as he’d called the elevator to this floor – but he made his footsteps loud just in case. The silhouette shifted just a little as Steve moved closer.
Slowly, deliberately telegraphing his moves, he brought his hands up to frame Steve’s face. Steve shifted a hand to cover one of Tony’s and pressed his cheek into Tony’s palm. Tony felt the other hand pressed to his chest, right over the arc reactor. He could feel the warmth there, warmth from Steve’s hands, and Tony felt joy bloom in his chest for the first time in months.
Sam chortles as he makes his way to Steve’s private locker room. Sometimes, it feels like high school here. The good parts of high school.
Satisfied, Bucky indicates for the movie to start and they continue their exploration of the 70s with The Godfather Part Two.
!” Tony threw the shield away from him in a pique. It crashed through the contents of two of his workbenches and the sound of metal cluttering to the floor echoed through the workshop.
When Tony made his way down to the kitchen thirty minutes later, freshly groomed and squeaky clean, and, most importantly, with ointments slathered over the deeper cuts from the night before, he found Steve, Clint, and Natasha chatting animatedly at the island.
He pulled back slowly, letting his tongue drag along the pulsing vein. He gave the tip a small suck and a kiss. More droplets of precum gathered at the tip, a lovely shine on the olive of Tony's skin. Steve grinned at the sight. He was getting there slowly, but surely. Even as he licked the droplets away, Tony continued to leak, and Steve lapped up every precious drop until Tony was moaning and shaking again.
The mottled bruises on Stark’s face and neck were expertly covered with makeup and the worst of the swelling hidden just behind the convenient fall of his hair. He held himself with the poise of a man used to concealing the sting and burn of breathing and moving with broken ribs and a body half covered in stitches. The only outward indication that Tony Stark had been physically affected by this little War at all was the fully casted arm straining the sleeves of the immaculately pressed jacket, the glove covering the hand, and a small hitch in his step.
He’d known that he wouldn’t move on from touching the shield, from seeing the shield, but Tony obviously hadn’t. At Tony’s words, he’d realized what he’d almost made Tony go through, and he felt his own flash of fear of what he had almost given up. And in that moment, he’d realized that he already knew what it was he had wanted. Steve had felt like he did in the ice. It came to him, and he knew what he wanted, now. He knew why he’d known that the shield could never have moved him on.
And that was it, wasn’t it? The hauntings happened only when Tony had had a nightmare. Nightmares Steve had been accidentally privy to through contact with the anchor. Tony had an entire history before Steve had met him and Steve knew Tony wasn’t proud of it. Steve hesitated but he had to know. He had to know straight from Tony, and not Tony’s subconscious. “Tony, why are you being haunted?”
“Fuck yourself on me, Mister Stark,” Steve said in his best Captain America voice. His voice almost failed on the ‘fuck’ but Tony immediately obeyed, pistoning his hips back onto Steve. Steve kept his legs stiff and pressed himself along Tony’s back, letting Tony’s bare skin rub against the material of his uniform, letting Tony use his cock. One of Tony’s hands wrenched itself from his grasp to grip tight at his hair and he bit down hard on Tony’s shoulder in response.
Steve sighed. Right. That. “I was hoping we could have taken it further. Worked on it. Worked on us.”
Tony groaned, pressing the heels of his palms hard into his eyes until his vision marbled. Steve’s name alone was enough to kill higher cognitive functions for a second there. He took a few deep breaths and signaled for JARVIS to open audio-only communication to the outside hallway. “What are the chances you won’t jump me if I let you in?” Tony asked casually.
Steve slammed down his fork and picked up his glass of milk, draining it and ignoring the cold burn down his throat. He used to be able to do this just fine.
“It’ll happen anyway,” Bruce said, equally exasperated, but Tony saw him message the PLASM support teams through the Quinjet comms.
Tony shook his head, stowing his phone. Of all people to turn up not dead after decades. He was going to pick Spengler’s brain later. He studied the Trap in Spengler’s hands - it was definitely the one he’d brought back. “Uh, nothing. I may have scratched it, if you’re worried about the paint job.”
As if to prove a point, Stark leaned forward and began to push himself to his feet. The whir of frozen servos being forced into action was loud and cutting. T'Challa stood and prepared to lend a hand as Stark push and pulled against the ground, fighting the dead weight and frozen joints with every movement until he was standing tall. And even standing a few centimeters taller than T'Challa and encased in bulky armor, the man still managed to look small. T'Challa knew why; it was always in the eyes. T'Challa was just glad that he was mobile.
Even as Stark had just displayed half those supposedly “unpleasant” traits, Steve had held back his instinctive gossip rag thoughts and summoned up the patience Iron Man liked to jokingly wax about.
He’d lost sight of the fight at the end; it had been him against them, him saying “no” and Stark saying “please”. He’d forgotten why he’d picked up the shield in the first place. He’d destroyed the goodwill and trust of the people he was supposed to protect and he had cast himself as the righteous and rewritten the history in his own head to achieve a victory he didn’t get.
. It was delicious, the slide, the grip. He kept going, pressing in until he could feel Tony’s ass pressed to his hips. He kissed the back of Tony’s neck, gentle, then gripped at Tony’s wrists.
It was in the way Tony fell into Steve’s arms, open but apologetic, lips seeking and seeking for something he didn’t know he’d missed; the way Steve clung on even tighter, pressing himself into Tony, tasting the apology between their lips, accepting that there was a part of Tony forever missing from one of their memories, promising with flicks of tongue that one of them would remember enough for the both of them.
Bucky considers. He'd never expected to develop the bond that he has with Natasha. It wasn’t just their similar histories which allowed her to help him through his recovery. She genuinely cares. And Bucky does as well.
Tony nodded and waved them on, watching as the jet streaked off with Thor chasing it through the air. He turned to Steve, who had been unusually quiet through that entire exchange. Steve had been using that tactical mind of his on their missions more and more lately. Today was the fifth time he’d taken command and they had worked like a well lubricated joint. There was no reason for him to be so reserved. “What’s up, buttercup?”
They all stop speaking and the silence resumes. Bruce decides to take the initiative. He grabs whatever he can reach of Thor and drags him back around the corner. “We’ll be elsewhere. Far from here,” he shouts over his shoulder. “I have cookies from Laura. We’ll save some for you. Have fun!”
"You're going against the Accords if you do this," Stark said, voice low. "You don't know Ross like I do. You don't know what he would do to get at Barnes."
“And you’ll give Tony back immediately?” Steve asked without hesitation. “Bring him to life again? Leave him? Stop draining his life?”
Tony nodded, pupils dilated wide. Steve rolled his palm over the warmth, pressing Tony hard back into the seat. He tightened his fist and rolled his wrist, massaging in smooth movements.
Tony opened his eyes and turned his head fractionally to look at Steve. Steve could see how bloodshot they were and he worried. “That’s a paradox,” Tony waved a hand at him. “Why would you show up now, if you wanted to stay? Why not right after you dropped the plane?”
Tony leaned in started nibbling at his lips, freed hands roaming over his shoulders and chest. This close, Steve could see the shine in Tony's blue eyes brimmed around the darkness of arousal. Tony smelled of sweat and metal, the heat of sex radiating like hot coals from his skin; there was nothing Steve could ever find more alluring. It was all Steve could do to not close his eyes and drown himself in pleasure of the moment.
Tony fidgets in his seat and drums his fingers on the table but Jim waits it out. Tony does things at his own pace; Jim’s learned it the hard way.
Tony let out a harsh breath. This was really not a good time for this. His body was screaming at him to open the door but his mind was still stuck somewhere with his baggage. How could he say it to Steve in a way that didn’t make him sound tragic? He was trying for a mature, stable, long-term relationship and he wasn’t going to go into the habits of his old ways which had resulted in not-very-long-term relationships? There was a pattern there and he was trying to break it in order to
“Try to gather as much water and energy bars as possible. Also make a pile of the team's dirty clothes.”
Bruce looked up from his book and gave Tony a concerned look. He leaned closer to Tony and rested his head on the top of Tony's cap. “What's wrong, bud?”
“Carbonell!? Bruce, how the hell do you know my mother's maiden name?” Tony whisper-shouted. “Also, that is so obvious! You know what? You're banned from making any more aliases.” Tony said sarcastically.
The Hulk roared, causing the girl to scream and scramble to her feet in fear. She stood there crying as the Alpha man took a few steps back. The Hulk took a step toward them, then another, his presence filling the entirety of the space and suffocating the Alpha’s scent.
The Alpha struggled for a moment more, but went limp when a close step brought the size of The Hulk’s foot into stark contrast. Tony’s nose wrinkled at the scent of uric acid. Gross, and the guy was on top of him too.
Tony proceeded to pull a wad of wires out of the small door and examined them. A few seconds of intense inspection, then Tony called out to the ceiling. “JARVIS, run diagnosis.”
Tony chuckled. “Haha, yeah. What a shocker.” He said sarcastically. Tony tried taking a few steps before he felt the room spin around him.
“How should I know? I wasn’t the one who made it!” Bedside manner was not one of Bruce’s specialties.
The doctor walked in and briefly introduced himself before heading straight to work with his clipboard.
“Yeah, it must've been a real drag,” Steve tried to joke. Of course it fell flat, Steve was far too tired to properly quip back.
“Stay down, or you’ll get what’s coming to ya!” the Alpha threatened Bruce. “As for you,” the Alpha snarled as he violently thrashed Tony in the air, eventually making his sunglasses fall. Tony was exposed.
“Oh, I almost forgot. There is one last thing Tony asked for before he fell back asleep,” Bruce added, fishing a bottle of water from the fridge.
Tony grabbed a pillow and shoved it on his face, groaning loudly. "Yeah, he's awake-" Bruce laughed as Tony rolled off the bed, throwing the pillows across the room and went to grab a pair of pajama pants and shirt to slip into.
Tony made his best attempts to project as many calming, safe pheromones into the air as he could, but his scent was still sour with fear.
“Sir, I would highly advise against any sort of lawsuit at your correct mental state.” JARVIS remarked.  Tony whimpered and painfully crawled across his room and hauled himself to his bed.
seen Tony in heat? He didn't even know Tony was an omega. For all he had known he was a beta. Was he just so caught up in the New York battle to even notice the secondary gender of his teammate? No, he noticed Bruce was an omega, smelled a hint of omega even on Clint. How could he have not scented Tony? Steve placed a hand on his forehead.
The door next to the counter opened and a Beta nurse poked out. “Tom Carbonell? The doctor is ready for you.”
Bruce let go of Tony, reluctant to voice what needed to be said. He took a step back, still keeping his eyes on the Omega.
“I thought I’d lost you for a second-” Bruce was a panting mess. He paused to catch his breath, but fell silent upon the sight before him. “What’s going on here?” Bruce asked dangerously.
Steve was hit with a need to stay beside Tony, an odd pull towards him. A need to look after him: to protect him. That was when Steve noticed his nose flaring involuntarily, and he understood what was happening to him.
Tony snarled. He opened his mouth to argue with the other Omega, but something else entirely escaped his mouth.
“Tony, please listen to the doctor,” Bruce said quietly, “He knows what's best for you.” Bruce tried his best to keep up with Tony as they walked out of the room.
Bruce let his body sink to the mattress. He was soooo exhausted. Right as Bruce closed his tired eyes, there was a quiet knock at the door. "Is Tony awake? Most importantly, is he decent?" Steve's voice rang through a crack in the door.
“Goddamn doctor!” Tony hissed as he stumbled out and down the still ripped up hallway from the elevator. He gripped the wall, trying his best to steady himself, praying that his wobbly knees wouldn't give.
“Hey there, big guy,” Tony spoke through the coughs, carefully rising to his feet and making his way to the towering figure, “ Everything's okay, big guy. We're good here.” He tried to soothe The Hulk.
Tony squeezed his eyes shut and clenched his teeth as a wave of pain came over him. “My- My stomach hurts."
Tony laid on his battered, broken couch. The city around him was just as bad, cracked and crumbling. Repairs to both the city and his tower were well underway, and some parts were mostly done. But unlike New York, his tower’s construction was halted for an indefinite amount of time. His depression was at its all-time lowest and he was tired as hell.
Bruce quietly tip-toed his way across the room and softly climbed onto the bed, careful not to jostle the food in the paper bag.
The Alpha laughed low, taunting her as she cried almost silently, trapped between a tyrant and a hard place. To the Alpha, this all must have been a sick game of cat and mouse to win over the Omega. As if she was merely an object to be won.
Steve's head nodded from side to side in a quick calculation of his activities. He paused for a second. “A little more than seventy hours?” Steve finally answered.
"T-Tony?" Steve whined at the scent that reached his nose. A sweet rain like scent fresh and warm. His whine got the attention of the omega in the bed and he turned to face him.
“You’re the doct—” Tony doubled over clutching his midsection as repeated a more recognizable form of the noise: a whimper.
“Shit. Please no, don’t say that Brucie. I thought you were a doctor.” Tony sighed and placed his head on his hands.
Tony pushed the Alpha away without much thought, and the Alpha darted from the alleyway with a fearful cry. The Hulk started to follow, but Tony stood and blocked his path.
“Get out,” Tony breathed out. He noticed the alpha stir, confusion and distress hung on the air that only agitated Tony further.
“Doc, you can basically smell it on me.” Tony tried to joke. “All I need are the pills and then I'm out.” Tony said simply.
“Shhhh…” Bruce's voice whispered sweetly. Tony tried turning to Bruce, preparing himself to throw out as many quick witted insults when a pain shot through his body, causing him to let out a cry.
“How dare you!” Tony breathed, looking up from under furious brows at the doctor, his very gaze a weapon.
“Good, you remembered.” Tony said, slightly annoyed at being interrupted, but he couldn't help but crack a cruel grin at the wickedly amusing phrase. “You just say that and the doors just open up.” Tony lazily waved.
“I said, gET OUT!”  Tony lashed out only to feel his guts twist painfully. An almost silent whimper of pain escaped him.
Tony took another bite and shrugged dramatically. “I dunno. I feel kinda hot and bothered, but I guess other than that I'm ok?”
The man roared and went to charge the monster. Tony dove for the man’s hips, bringing him down atop him. The girl screamed, distracting The Hulk from their struggle.
“You're a good man, Steve, you know that? Alphas haven't really changed a lot since your time, and Tony and I sincerely appreciate the respect you have given us.”
The Alpha laughed harder now. “Why do you care, Omega? Not like she’s complaining.” He snickered as the girl kept quiet. “ Besides, what's it to you?”
For all the time that Tony had personally known the Captain, he had never not maintained a respectful amount of eye contact. And it was strange that now he couldn't even look at Tony; it made him feel uncomfortable.
Tony wrinkled his nose as bruce wrenched and his lunch made a second appearance. Tony was there to rub circles in his friends back. A small attempt at helping.
When the doctor told him the news, Tony shut down building repairs, which thankfully left only the bare necessities to a semi functional state.
“Tony?” Bruce asked worriedly, “ is there something wrong?-” Before Bruce could ask any more questions, Tony took off into the alley.
Well, that’s the excuse he gave to his makeshift construction crew of his 3 only friends. In reality, Tony was t-minus 2 days until going into heat and outing his best kept secret. This of course, wouldn’t have happened if New York wasn’t attacked by an alien Demigod last week.
Bruce sighed. “Tony. I don't think I have sufficient knowledge of secondary gendered biology to help you.” He slowly put the pad down and turned to face him.
Bruce carefully pulled Tony's hands from his abdomen. “Does it hurt here?—” Bruce gently pressed down a few inches above Tony’s belly button, “—or here?”
“Sir, Ms. Potts will only become more concerned if you suddenly block her access codes.” JARVIS said slowly, almost cautiously. “Access codes that you have not restricted, for years. She will become suspicious.”
Tony's knee bounced furiously as he clung to his jacket. Saying he was nervous was an understatement. You could smell the fear on him. He tried to spray himself profusely with scent blockers before they left for the doctor's, but his newly awakened endocrine system was hard at work pumping out as many Omega pheromones as possible before his body went back to being numb with suppressants.
Bruce gave a hearty chuckle as he shook his head. “Yeah, it’s the heat. It affects behavior, hormones screwing with the brain and such. Without constant contact and comfort, anything resembling function is out of the question. You can’t eat or sleep by yourself because you can’t even begin to think straight.” Bruce hesitated for a moment as he opened the food bar, eyeing Steve to see if he caught the subtle shift to an inclusive perspective.
Bruce looked down. “Tony, your hormones are all over the place. I mean—” Bruce waved his had in front of his nose. “—your scent is very potent. You reek of afterheat and I can smell your moodiness.”
An Alpha stood over a small Omega girl, pressing her against a wall and pinning her under him. She tried her best to fight him off, but was losing. Desperately.
Tony snaked his arms around Bruce. “Who said this was a hug?” Tony suggested slyly as he swiped the bag from Bruce's hands and quickly returned to the center of his nest with the food. Tony shuffled a bit in his spot, making himself as comfortable as he could before finally bringing his knees up. Tony dug through the bag and pulled out a burger.
“Yeah, I'm not sure if I could take another day of being smothered by Tony's death hugs,” Bruce joked as he reached into a cabinet for an energy bar.
“The pains are a side effect of the heat. Physical interactions ease them.” Bruce said moving himself  closer to Tony’s body, only for him to shrink away.
Tony stopped, his ears straining to hear what exactly was going on. Bruce also stopped in utter confusion a good ten feet past Tony.
“To get a second opinion, because obviously yours is wrong,” Tony answered, grabbing hold of Bruce’s wrist.
Steve had to stop for a second to register the instructions and was about to ask why but Banner practically read his mind over the phone. “He needs to be comforted by the scents of the team. It will help with the pain.” Bruce said quietly.
The coughing seemed to have no end, but eventually Tony acquired air in lungs sufficient to speak and slowly sat up.
Guys this story is so long. I'll try to tighten up the outline and fill in some more action packed scenes. Hopefully it will turn out good.
Tony yawned and stretched his arms forward, reaching for Bruce with grabby hands. Bruce sighed and allowed himself to be pulled into a lazy hug.
The nurse drew Tony's blood for analysis and went ahead and gave a urine sample too. After that, they waited in the room for an ungodly amount of time for the doctor to come. Of course they would, with a sketchy alias, odd clothes, and probably a million other Omegas out there who also needed a check up.
Tony gasped as his knees buckled under his weight and was left shivering on the floor. He wasn’t trying to be melodramatic, but this new experience was dizzying and completely foreign to him.
The man struggled, but Tony grappled him with a snarl. “You’d better stay down if you know what’s good for you.” He echoed the Alpha’s earlier threat. “Now quit it with the angry scent, or you’ll kill us both.” He was only half-lying.
Steve stood in the doorway for a brief second and then turned to run. The omega’s heart broke at every step he heard from Steve getting farther and farther away.
Tony sank back to his seat, guided by Bruce. The doctor was right, as much as Tony couldn’t bear to hear it.
“Come sit with me,” Tony invited, patting the spot next to him. Bruce gave a curt yet sheepish nod and crawled across bed. He made himself comfy next to Tony, making sure to keep pleasant pressure of physical contact. Tony leaned into the comfort that Bruce gave.
“I would also suggest that you grant override codes to Ms. Potts, Mr. Hogan and Colonel Rhodes in cases of emergency until you have fully recovered.” JARVIS said. Tony hissed in disapproval. “No!” Tony said through clenched teeth. “No, don’t let any of them see me like this.” Tony said curling  further into himself.
“Tony? What's wrong with Tony is he sick or-” Steve cut Bruce off before he could say anything else.
“Let’s hear him out,” Bruce suggested softly. Tony said nothing, accepting with his brooding silence.
Tony rolled his eyes. "Calm down, Brucie, we'll figure out all that stuff later. For right now," Tony leaned back into the nest and gave a sigh, "Let's just relax."
Tony shifted closer to Bruce. His smooth and sweet Earl grey scent was the only thing familiar to Tony and he tried to cling to it.
Tony could smell the Alpha’s flight or fight response begin to kick in, the air flooding with testosterone.
Bruce entered the kitchen. The distant look on his face matched Steve’s exhausted expression; the Alpha was spaced as he leaned over the counter with his arms crossed, his head low.ing more evident
As they walked across the floor of the tower, Tony noticed a few things. A few major things. A few very interesting things.
“This happens a lot with your generation of Omegas,” the doctor continued, ”Fathers thought that their Omega sons would be safer as Betas and taught their children to abuse these drugs.”
Tony sighed. “I’m not used to all the scents.” Tony pressed his head closer to Bruce. “Everything is usually watered down and thin.”
” Bruce said almost bitterly. But Steve felt the joking tone on the other’s voice and helped him ease his nerves.
“What the hell was that?" Tony put his hand over his chest, from where the noise seemed to emulate from.
The Alpha continued laughing, not making a move off the poor girl, who still had tears streaming down her cheeks.
Tony snatched the door knob and threw the door open. Steve stood there startled, his mouth wide open. Tony glared at him angrily.
“What I'm trying to say is, Mr. Carbonell,” the doctor addressed Tony directly as his focus waned, “is that there still might be some hope for you. Find a good, strong Alpha to partner with. Your damaged uterus will heal in time. You still have a shot at a family.”
The Hulk stood in Bruce’s place, a towering shadow in the alleyway. In his throat animated deep, low growls made the trash on the ground reverberate.
Tony had been completely alone for the past few days. Steve had still very jumpy since the battle of New York. No one could blame him from imagining what terrible things his teammate would go through to not be able to suit up. He thought of every equation that could end up with Tony groaning in pain. Alone. For who knows how long.
Tony sucked a breath of fresh hair in relief as he passed the threshold of his room. “That-” Tony blinked heard trying to configure a sentence that could make sense even in his own mind. “- Th-that doctor should lose his m-medical licence.”
“JARVIS, call Steve to come here, say it's urgent. I need to call a doctor.” Bruce said to the ceiling.
Tony went to say something. He had opened his mouth, but that was as far he was going to get: the elevator doors opened and the topic was dropped. The observation room was oddly intact, and so were the doors, so why would they be malfunctioning?
Jumping straight into Tony getting his heat. Nothing sexual but if you're worried about that, why are you here? JK, love you guys.
Whoop there it is! Oh God, did I just give away my age? Anyways, uploads are gonna go pretty smoothly with my outline. But I still have to figure out how to get used to AO3.
Bruce immediately went to try to diffuse the situation. “Hey man, let’s not do anything rash-!” Bruce was cut off when the Alpha pushed him down. Bruce’s head cracked against the ground.
“Okay so you have been on suppressants for most of your life, this is your first heat in years and you're complaining of stomach pain.” The Beta doctor turned the page. “Seems your analysis showed some hormones to be all over the place.”
Tony stood there for a few moments as Bruce's nerves frayed bit by bit the more he stared at Tony’s vacant attention.
Bruce smiled; Steve was really trying. Every heat Bruce had experienced in the past had been a total nightmare. The few times he had brushed past Alphas while in heat almost invariably ended as well as one might expect: horribly. It was a nice change of pace to not worry about anything like that happening to Tony while Steve was around.
As Steve took a step closer, Tony let out a growl. “Back off Cap. I can take care of my own damn self.” Tony snarled.
an effect of the alcohol,” JARVIS said solemnly, “I presume that your body is going through the early stages of preheat. I suggest to prepare yourself for it.”
The Alpha turned to where Bruce had been, where the newly, strong, musty, ripe scent of unsweetened gray tea came from.
As they made their way back to the car, Bruce discussed the book he had been reading. In all honesty, Tony would’ve paid more attention to him, it's just that there was a particular scent carrying in the dead wind of the city as they passed an alleyway.
Tony groaned and dropped his head onto the hard surface of the bench. The tools rattled. He closed his eyes and all he could see was Steve. Steve’s smile. Steve’s face twisted in ecstasy as he comes, legs spread, Tony’s fingers insi—
After another heated hour, Starnes left in high dudgeon and with a promise of a new shed and monetary compensation, and Murdock shook Steve’s hand, then Tony’s, and left at a more leisurely pace.
That was all fantasy. All of the images had been fantasy. None of that had happened yet because Tony was trying to sustain a long-term relationship for a
And even with Pepper as his CEO, even with a team of Avengers to pick up the supervillain slack, Tony's schedule was still tight. For shorter trips, Tony liked to fold himself into an Iron Man suit and fly himself there to save time. He would show up to inspections or meetings in slightly wrinkled suits, and Steve would more often than not hear more about it from Pepper than from Tony. Steve only knew about how the wrinkled suits looked on the floor of their bedroom -- or Tony's workshop, or the kitchen -- afterwards.
Tony stood in the open space of the workshop. His hands were loose at his side, and the shirt that he had worn, that had been torn by Bruce
Steve sat and waited, and as he waited, Tony slowly, haltingly, lowered his hand from the arc reactor and started to recount the tale of his capture in Afghanistan, Obadiah Stane’s betrayal, SHIELD and PLASM’s interference with the subsequent Stane Haunting, his fight with palladium, and his most recent altercation with Ivan Vanko. Tony went straight back to bed as soon as he said his last word, avoiding Steve’s eyes, but Steve sat with him, just in case.
“It was kind of… not blue?” Steve looks down at the blue light. “More like yellow or green. And I reached for it and ended up here.”
And back in Tony’s small room, Steve gently lowered Tony into the large bed in the loft and just sat, watching Tony breathe. Tony’s breath was steady and deep. He had a healthy set of lungs. Mostly used to needle Steve with inappropriate serenades, but Steve didn’t mind. He yelled at Tony about it but he’d never tell him to stop. Tony had a nice voice when he wasn’t being obnoxious and Steve missed the old songs from his youth.
“We wouldn’t be in this situation if we were having regular sex before this,” Steve said, and wasn’t that the truth. “It’s making me a little crazy,” Steve went on, voice getting stronger, “but I’ve still got my memories intact. I know I wanted this. I do want this. You can't expect me to sleep next to you every night, kiss you goodnight every evening, kiss you good morning every day, and not want the rest of you as well. But if you don’t want this…it’s not a deal breaker if we don’t ever have sex. It never was. I’m gonna be taking a lot of cold showers and spending longer in the changing room but I can handle it. I’m not one to step out into a relationship just for the sex. And before you ask, I’m not just saying this because I really want to have sex with you right now.”
Thor lands with a booming laugh after being enclosed in a circling maneuver that would have shattered most aircrafts together. Bruce accepts a bone-crushing hug and they make their way through the open hanger door to where red lights are shimmering from the back.
There was a shuffling noise and more silence from Steve. Tony threw his hands up, mouth hanging open. So much for ‘serious conversation’.
Tony laughed and moved in to wrap his arms back around Steve’s waist, mouth hovering close to Steve’s again, teasing. “In that case, this was a hell of an actual first kiss.” He licked his lips, eyes twinkling. “Wanna beat the record?”
“Me?” Tony asked, then continued before Steve could clarify his meaning. “Thor and Natasha would want to spar with you so I’d have to fight them for your time but I think - I want to take you flying.” Tony prodded at the sheets on his lap. “You haven’t flown with the Iron Man until you’ve felt the wind on your face.” He glanced sideways at Steve. “Riding me like a sky pony like you’ve been doing doesn’t count and we can never let that happen again if the rest of the world and the media can all see you.”
“My Quicksilver friend!” Thor says, pulling Pietro into a hug. “It is good to see you fully recovered.” He pulls back, putting Pietro at arm’s length and studies his face intently. “Though something troubles you.”
Tony shook his head. There had to be something he could do. The Stone, it had kept Steve back in this world, but surely— His mind was clouding over and he shook his head again, hard, trying to clear it.
War Machine looks down and then Rhodey’s voice comes through the comms on a private channel. “Catch him before he leaves his locker room.” He gives Sam a small wave and leaves through the hatch.
Thor continued to fly after the Colonel, knocking him away from the giant chicken, swinging at its head, and breaking its glasses. The Colonel refused to fall but was at least moving further away from its partner in crime, stirring up clouds of dust with its massive feet.
Steve thought over his options and picked his own box. It might be a terrible idea which could blow up in Steve’s face later given who they both were but it was something he wanted as Steve Rogers and not as Captain America. “I take it you don’t have a date,” he began.
“I know it’s strictly not my business,” Steve said cautiously, “but do you think you can tell me about it?”
Steve felt the material slither tantalizingly down his leg. He kept his eyes on Tony and his hands in his lap, giving nothing of his simmering insides away. Tony’s eyes narrowed in challenge and Steve gave him a small smirk. Tony leaned back onto the desk, and started undoing his shirt buttons. He pushed off the desk at the last button and spun in a slow circle, tugging the shirt off and flicking it to the ground. The muscles of his back flexed as his hands lowered to his belt and Steve couldn’t take it anymore.
As the boys wipe their mouths, she takes out her cell phone from her hidden pocket and places it on a dry spot on the table between them.
“Come for me,” Steve breathed, nosing along Tony’s ear. He stroked faster, feeling Tony lose his pace as he shuddered and shivered with the need to orgasm. “Come for me. Tony.”
we have between us now and I don’t even remember how it happened. There’s still the guilt every time I…. But I remember everything from before, and I wanted this, too, maybe even before you knew I was Iron Man.”
Tony was standing in the kitchen when Steve stepped through the front door. Steve stopped over the threshold, hand still on the door handle, but didn’t move to enter his apartment. The groceries in his hands suddenly felt heavier, the bag cutting into his palms.
He had left Stark in charge of evacuating the town while he rode on to catch the train. Fisk must have somehow gotten to Stark. If Steve had been any slower in stopping the train—
“Just a set of coordinates. A name. A place,” Steve said. He fiddled with the cuffs of his navy uniform as he walked in a circle. Tony had always liked it when he wore blue. Another slow circle, and the agent finally spoke up again.
Steve started to suck at his neck and Tony threw his head back, a yell caught in his throat. There was too much to feel. There was too much
“You’re so beautiful,” Steve panted into Tony’s hair, trying hard to keep his voice steady. “Spread for everyone to see.”
Steve nods slowly at his words and Sam senses the event horizon approaching. “No promises, Sam. But, yeah, I think I’ll try for it. Thanks.” He looks at Sam, smile turning a little devious. Oh shi—
“I’d be surprised if you didn’t know me,” Stark said. “Look, sorry about back there. You were a quick getaway vehicle. Tell me what you want to not get that out to the tabloids. I’m not building you bombs but anything else, I can do. Cars, talent agent, Tuscan vacation. Pick a box.”
“The lack of a first time in our non-existent sex life. And my original question of why we can't just have sex.”
Trust Steve to barge right through Tony’s bullshit to hit the nail dead center on the head at a time like this. In times of crisis, Captain America pulled through. You could always rely on Captain America to come up with a winning strategy at the last minute. And Tony had walked himself right into the problem, so he couldn't even claim he was ambushed. He must have missed the moment Steve had gone into ‘mission mode’ with him because
Tony woke the next morning looking lighter and brighter than Steve had ever seen him. He seemed to be pretending that the previous night’s talk hadn’t happened, but from then on, Tony became more open with Steve, more honest, more casual, hiding less behind sarcasm. He started taking Steve out at night to visit the sights of the 21
Steve hesitated, eyes flicking between Tony’s face and the arc reactor, but he stepped toward Tony again, reaching out a hand. Tony kept his eyes down and watched as Steve’s gloved fingers slowly sunk into the surface of the arc reactor. Only when Steve’s fingers were at the second knuckle, fingertips level with the vibranium core, did Tony feel the heat flare in his chest again.
Steve clicked his tongue and watched in amusement as the agent tensed in the chair, expecting another blow. Most of them were easily cowed in his presence. Most of them knew what he was, who he was, what he did. Few of them had known him well before—before.
He leans back into the car to fetch the cookie basket from Laura then turns back around to look up at the sky. Thor had joined two aggressively buzzing Quinjets in a game of tag. The jets are new and agile, probably more so because of the pilots he knows are in there.
,” Tony retorted, hissing as a searing, red heat started to build up in his left palm again, pulsing at his fingertips. Steve’s arms tightened around him and Tony didn’t have the heart to tell him it was more painful than not.
it. For Steve to wake, for Steve to leave this false, happy, world. For them to travel back to the real world. With Tony.
There was a yell and a loud thud as something, someone, collided with the ground. The Fallen gave a screech of victory. Steve opened his eyes. He couldn’t see Sam anymore. He panicked.
Cross-walking between the Earths had to go through stringent security checks and Tony Stark had not been on the list of Authorized Travelers. He could not be on the list of Authorized Travelers.
None of the Greek Gods have got anything on those pectorals. Tony could just bite them through that blue under-armor—
“You know,” Tony said from behind him, “it’s been a while since any villain, super or otherwise, attacked anything in the city.”
T'Challa nodded again, and strode on. The aftermath of a broken friendship was never pleasant to witness but he would do this. He was taking his first steps in correcting his mistakes and making peace with one of the largest hurdles he would be facing during his reign. He only wished he could know if his father would have approved of his actions.
Tony, dressed in a neat black suit, is looking down at a particular tombstone. Steve tries to make out the name, but can’t. Around them, amongst the tombstones, half-formed figures appear and disappear. Some are in pristine military gear, some are so torn Steve can barely make out their features. Steve looks away and steps up to Tony but Tony doesn’t appear to notice any of it. Steve doesn’t know what to say, so he stands in silence with Tony.
century was just different and not always for the good. They’d won the war and weren’t speaking German, but he’d hoped that everyone would have moved on from him as well. He had not expected to wake up to the title of Living Legend. He’d done what he had to when he’d joined the war. He had
A soft warmth bloomed beneath Steve’s fingers and he pushed forward, just a little, and grasped at it. The feeling of wholeness, of connection, of purpose bloomed through his mind, just like that first time they’d done this, out on the ruined lawns of Bryant Park. To his phantom hands, it was like holding onto a solid mass of air, hard, yet soft at the same time. A tingle raced up his arm, unlike the first time he’d done this, and Steve gave an experimental squeeze just to feel it again. He felt a spike of pleasure pool in his belly and Tony gasped out loud in the same moment.
Steve slid the eggs out of the pan and onto the toast he’d laid out alongside a handful of cherry tomatoes. He threw on some chives, then took the entire plate, and a cup of milk, to the small dining table under the window.
Tony buried his face in his hands. Of course Steve wouldn’t. Even if they hadn’t exactly officially named this precious little thing they had between them. This relationship. Regular kissing meant a relationship, right? “Just ignore everything that’s coming out of my mouth,” he said. He rubbed his face and reached for the bottle of water one of his bots had put beside him.
happening. Steve always checked on Tony for injuries, but he respected Tony’s wishes and refrained from actively hovering over Tony’s bed.
Iron Man knew how to look past the shield and the star and the wings on Steve’s head. Steve cherished their interactions; just a normal conversation was something he craved on his lonelier days.
“If I let you have a piece of my soul equivalent to what he gave me of his,” Tony asked the Stone, voice level, “will it be enough? Will it make Steve whole? Will you stop with the summoning? Take me to Steve?”
Steve has been wandering on the earth as a ghost for a month now. He’s unofficially joined PLASM (“Paranormal Life and Spiritual Management,” Clint had told him. “It’s sadomasochism,” Tony had tried to amend) as the only paranormal lifeform of Team Alpha, the Avengers (or the Ghostbusters as Tony liked to call them when he was alone with Steve). They were a team that was part of a subsect of a larger organization, SHIELD, which once was the Strategic Scientific Reserve Steve had been a part of. Steve had accepted their help with minimal suspicion and let them fill him in on all that he’d missed. He didn’t know if he should care that they’d won the War. This could all be a feverish dream, the flash before his eyes just before he would truly expire. He couldn’t know.
“This is me,” Tony says from behind Steve. “I know it’s wrong but I do it. I’m just that much of an asshole.” His voice sounded muffled, like he was speaking from behind his hands.
Hulk lumbered away to sit down on the street corner and Tony, mind hazing over again at the sight of Steve before him, took that as a sign of both Bruce’s and Hulk's wellbeing. Natasha and Clint could take care of themselves and Tony didn't particularly care where they were taking the Quinjet. Right now, what he cared about was getting his hands on Steve. He needed to get every part of himself in contact with Steve. They needed to be horizontal. Or vertical. Tony wasn’t picky. Maybe Steve was strong enough to just pick him up, armor and all, hold him up, and just
Despite all of that, there was one memory Steve had kept at the forefront of his mind every time the gossip rags had reported something inane about Tony Stark. Steve remembered the one time Iron Man had said anything positive about his boss; he had said that Stark was ‘trying to help and do the right thing even if no one wants to see it’. It had been a throwaway line, tossed out as the Avengers had been lamenting their terrible aquatic gear when battling a shoal of rogue squids alongside Atlanteans far off the coast of Florida.
Tony nods enthusiastically and grins at him. “Who is it? Is it Bucky? Will you tell me about the time you rode your motorcycle right over enemy walls and took out the tanks with your shield? Bucky used a M1941 Johnson, right? He protected you from up high, right? How good was he, really? What did he like about the rifle? Did he ever need—“
shoulders, and then he finally lets himself sink into the hug, arms tightening around Tony, face burying into Tony’s soft hair. He has almost forgotten the feeling of holding another body in his arms and now he holds onto Tony tightly. He stands and feels the steady beat of Tony’s heart underneath his hands, the soft tickle of Tony’s hair at his nose, the sweet smell of Tony’s shampoo and the musky scent of his skin, the steady rise and fall of Tony’s chest as they breathe in tandem.
Jim puts his glass down and reaches over to pull Tony’s face back to look him in the eye. “Tones. You of all people know that sexuality is a wide, wide spectrum. Plus,” Jim says, pulling his hand back, “I have on good authority that the good Captain will indeed look at a man if it’s the right man.”
“You can’t just wave away everything that’s happened,” Tony said, incredulity coloring his tone, hands waving desperately. “You can’t just make me—make us go back to
Clint and Natasha lowered their weapons fractionally and raised their goggles. Natasha’s expression was as impassive as ever but Clint was staring wide-eyed at Cap in glee.
And Steve smiled. It wasn’t the poster smile. It wasn’t the Captain America smile. It wasn’t formal. It was Steve’s smile. Steve’s happy, boyish smile, with the small curl at the corner of his mouth and twinkle in his eye. It was the smile Tony liked to believe was reserved for him alone.
Steve could feel his phantom teeth grinding. “I show up, they disappear. That’s good enough for me.”
When Jim steps out the bathroom a while later, a little more sober, Tony is squinting at him from under the sheets. Jim makes him from the bottle of water on the bedside table, gives him a pat on the arm, then stands to go sleep in the second bedroom.
Steve grunted and nodded, still sawing his way through the ropes binding the first ankle. He remembered punching a giant, bald man with a bowler hat off the side of the carriage. Steve should've punched him harder. Baldy might even be dead from the fall. Steve didn't particularly care at the moment, considering. Stark, meanwhile, continued to ramble on about nothing in particular.
“What happened?” Bruce asked, coming to stand next to him, a hand on his shoulder. “Why did your arc reactor fail? The vibranium was completely fried. Did Steve do this?”
“And you could stop pretending it’s anything but,” Steve bit out. They both knew Tony’s work would be easier if Steve was gone from the picture permanently.
The hands on his face slipped away and Tony opened his eyes to the sight of Steve being pulled back towards the blooming white light. He used the last of his strength, his will, to stand and reach for Steve, only to catch the final brush of Steve’s fingertips as he was drawn into the light.
“Or I could show you the penthouse of Stark Tower if you want,” Stark added huskily. He stepped forward and trailed his fingers over Steve’s bicep where he’d been gripping moments earlier. “The view’s great. Tallest building around this part.” He stepped closer still, fingers continuing to gently trace patterns on Steve’s arm and Steve could feel the goosebumps rise on his skin at the contact. “Very private, I promise.”
Stark looked away at that, his hands clearly wanting to gesture but were held in aborted movements by the armor.
Tony shook his head sharply and took another step away. He was not prepared for this. He should have at least been here for this. They should have
Pepper had been giving him less and less work, throwing him worried looks whenever he’d turned up at her office. JARVIS had him scanned daily but outside of his increasing grumpiness and clumsy-handed work, he was as healthy as anyone could be with a cluster of shrapnel housed snugly in his chest. He’d tried to sleep it off and had DUM-E and U make him smoothies every day to boost his nutrient intake. Just like the good ol’ days where he’d been dying via palladium reaction products.
The bar is absolutely packed when Natasha arrives at 7:59 p.m. with Clint in tow. She makes her way through the rowdy Friday crowd to the table against the wall at the back of the room. Bucky, Sam, and Rhodey are crowded around half a dozen empty tankards between them with nary a sound. This does not bode well.
Peggy had been the only remaining person on his little list because she was the only one still alive. Steve had not been surprised to learn of this but he had had a hard time deciding if he’d wanted her to see him like this at all. If he’d wanted to see her like this. In the end, he’d fallen back to the mantra that had been running through his head - he didn’t belong, he didn’t belong - and he’d gone, hoping it would bring peace to the both of them. She had cried and he had wanted to hug her tight, withered and fading as she was and insubstantial as his body was. When it had been time to part ways again, he had not moved on, but her mind and her memories had.
Steve had requested it? Tony shook his head violently and took a step away, glancing around at the room. There was a ringing in his ears and his heart was trying to beat right through his chest. His fingers refused to stop shaking and he clasped them into fists at his side. His eyes landed on Steve’s again. His breath hitched and he almost stumbled. “What were you going to do if you touched it and moved on? Right then?”
It was only after the fiasco with the Hood and the Infinity Gauntlet that Steve realized he couldn’t take it anymore. He’d raged and yelled at Tony. He’d thrown down ultimatums. He couldn’t understand how Tony could keep something like the
A small drone, the size of a football, dropped down from the sky and hovered above his knee. It was sleek and rounded, showing no visible seams.
They are in Tony’s bedroom in Stark Tower. The world outside the window is white, bright, and featureless but the inside is exactly the same as Steve had just left it. Tony walks around and examines the room, picking and prodding at all of his various scattered possessions. He stops by the lovely unnamed sculpture by Wejchert and fingers the corners.
The paper under Steve’s fingers scrunched, and he tried hard to relax his grip. The ink was smeared where his fingers had dug in but he ignored it.
“Is there something you wished to see me about?” Tony asked. He was formal. Good. Steve settled himself into this little game.
A minor warning for a bit of dubiously consensual groping towards the end of the chapter, not actually from either Steve or Tony.
“He’s always gone, these days,” Maria says, not looking at him. “He’s looking for you. He’ll never find you and he’ll lose Tony along the way.”
Tony looks good. He’s maybe built up a little more muscle mass, and isn’t getting more white hairs. Good. Tony, evidently, decides to make things weird as usual.
The second time it had happened, Steve had been awake and still jittery from the adrenalin of a fight against two-bit powered villains. The Avengers usually came in two categories: the ones who slumped immediately after a fight, and the ones who needed to work off the excess energy. As a heavy hitter, Iron Man would have been the latter, but Steve had been certain that underneath all the layers of armour Iron Man was just a normal man.
It was late in the afternoon and they were in Flushing, having just returned from an unsuccessful raid of a HYDRA base in Sweden where Loki's Stick of Doom was unsurprisingly absent. Tony hadn’t even had time to make a cool-down smoothie before Maria alerted them of some trouble in the streets that the local police weren’t able to contain.
The fighting had stopped at the sound of a stool breaking over a man’s back and every one of the rogues had turned to face Tony with their bloody fists raised. Then one man had dropped his fists. And ran to Tony with a yell of recognition and began to shake Tony’s hands, thanking him for his efforts. For his contribution. For helping them kill all those Southern rat bastards and showing them their place. And Tony had dropped the stool legs, and left without a word.
“We snack on our victory!” Thor said, raising Mjolnir. “I will race you there, Barton?” He smiled widely and swung his hammer over his head. “I shall be generous and give you ten seconds head start!”
"Keeping him safe is all I can ask for," Steve said. He looked back at the Wakandan imitation of a de-powered Quinjet. "And the plane. Very expensive plane. I can't thank you enough for everything. "
When Steve had been a boy, he’d been certain of one thing in life: everyone he knew and loved would outlive him. Against all odds, it had mostly turned out to be false, and a new certainty had grown in his mind over the years: everything he wanted in life came at a cost. He had envisioned a life with Peggy after the war, and he’d lost that as the cost of saving America from the Red Skull’s terror. And at the cost of his own life. And before that? He had a new body, but Doctor Erskine gave his life for it. They’d been winning the war against HYDRA, and he’d lost Bucky for it. Whatever he wanted, it cost him something, someone he loved.
calling this magic and brushing it off as inexplicable. I know all I want to do right now is to lick you all over, and honestly, that’s not far from the usual for me when it comes to you. All of that aside, I am patient zero. You are also patient zero, but I can’t access you because I might eliminate my status as patient zero by way of copulation. Did I say that I’m not going to call it
Steve nudged at the shattered ankle of the agent and watched curiously as the man screamed through gritted teeth. He kicked it again for good measure, then stood to pace just outside the cone of light.
Tony huffed in annoyance and heaved himself off his couch. He had just ordered his suppressants the day of the attack, only for the 3-day amazon prime package to be lost in the chaos of the falling city. It was already sketchy business making monthly payments to a random online seller. The guy only sold the pills one week out of the month and Stark had barely made it to this month’s sell before they ran out. He tried to go to the closest omega clinic that was still open but when they had heard his lifetime dependency on the drugs they quickly turned him down. Something about taking the pills for so  long might give him ‘adverse effects’. And no sum of money or begging could change their refusal note.
