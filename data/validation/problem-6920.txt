Steve sighs, finishes his apple, and walks over. Presses the literal one button it takes to make coffee on this machine. Tony looks up at him with a dazed smile, like he’s hung the moon.
Except it’s only been a week and a half, now, and Ty is leaning against his worktable, only about a foot from him, under the guise of looking at his work. And Tony can’t—he can’t think, with Ty so close. It’s the
“Tony, someone—how much do you remember? From last night?” Steve says. His tone is measured, tentative.
It doesn’t matter, Ty’s hand doesn’t fucking matter, because yesterday, he got a report from Fury that Steve, Clint, and Nat were in Paris doing some spy work and their comms had gone down, just a blip while Nat was in the basement of some hideout, but—it shouldn’t have happened. She could have gotten hurt, something could have happened. Tony should have been done with this days ago, and then they would have been using it instead of the older tech and it wouldn’t have happened. So Ty’s hand really doesn’t matter.
His pupils are wide, blown out. He’s fiddling with his cuff, now, and murmuring to himself, and even as Steve watches he’s toppling slowly, one way and then the other. How is he still on his feet? Tony looks over at Steve and frowns.
Steve taps on the ground. One, two. Tony’s looking around the room, tapping on his knee in rhythm. He’s still shaking, somewhat, and looks small.
“Jarvis, turn up the heat,” Ty commands and that—that rankles. Ty doesn’t get to command Jarvis. That’s not. No.
He’s looking better than Tony is this morning, though there’s some faint bruising on his jaw and Tony thinks, with satisfaction, that it must correspond to the ache in his own knuckles. The cologne is stronger in here; he'd actually been smelling it in the elevator, but here it's in full force, overpowering. Ty smiles his movie-star smile, shark-like.
How much do you know, Tony wants to ask, how much did I tell you, but he needs to end this conversation fast before it creeps into
Steve winces at the shortness of the response, but. Well. He probably deserves that. “No. It’s—well, Fury put the team together as a team. I guess I have trouble remembering that sometimes, and it’s easy to get into this mode where I stop listening. It gets, well. Hard to listen. But that’s not—I’m on a team, now. And I should trust you with calls, just like you trust me.” He remembers, now, what he and Tony had been arguing about—a call Tony had made over the comms, something about him moving forward and Hawkeye falling back. He hadn’t followed it, and everything had gone to shit.
Tony tries hard, very hard, to smile back. He bites the inside of his cheek to keep the smile there, one, two, three, four, before he lets it fall again, turns back to his worktable.
He hasn’t laughed this hard in a long time. He lets the laugh take over for a minute and then he comes back to reality, wiping his eyes. His chest hurts. “Unfortunately,” he says, shaking off the laugh, “Buck’s straight as a ruler.”
Usually, he wouldn’t bother to do it all up on pen and paper. He’s able to work out flawless designs in his mind just fine. But after the debacle with the comms device, he figures it’s best, for now, to have things written out. He doesn’t want to make any mistakes.
going to route the underneath. He had to, for it to work right. It was in the designs, it was in his first prototype, and—how had he forgotten that?
“A thing," Steve repeats. The room stills every time Steve talks, goes quiet. Even just his stupid two-word answers.
and he’s not Steve’s to care about or think about or watch over so Steve doesn’t owe him a thing. And still he feels—betrayed. Not betrayed. Maybe betrayed. He feels bad, is what he feels, and it’s a persistent feeling that he is usually able to swat away with schematics and wires and prototypes and can’t, this time.
“Want to take a little break, Tony?” Ty asks, walking towards Tony. He has that look on his face. The same one that he had last Saturday, when he gave Tony a dark hickey high enough up on his neck that he’s had to button his shirt up all the way since.
Steve splutters. He’s pretty sure Tony doesn’t get nosebleeds often, though he could be wrong. It doesn’t seem to be bleeding a lot, but there is an undeniable drip of blood going from his noses straight to his upper lip. “Do you need a, a tissue, or—what happened?”
It’s pretty obvious to Tony, too, that Viastone is going steal his designs. He's not sure how Fury hasn't come to the same conclusion, except that Ty's best quality is his ability to talk anyone into believing anything. Or his worst quality. Anyways, Viastone will steal his designs, sooner or later. But fine. Whatever. He can lie to them, give them bad info, something like that. It’s an extra step in the creative process, but it’s doable.
Fury waves a hand, though, in response. “No, no. We’re not giving you a bunch of interns to bully, Stark," and that seems like a joke, but Tony's not sure if he's supposed to laugh, and he definitely doesn't remember how, so he doesn't. Instead, he stares hard at a stack of papers on Fury's desk. He can't even read the header. Should he be able to read that? He should be able to read that. "No," Fury continues. "You’ll do your business directly with Stone here. Meetings, working in the shop together, whatever he needs to make sure you’re on track. A sort of partner-style relationship.”
“Just—Ty. Not,” Tony said, and waved his hand again infuriatingly. He pointed his finger at Steve’s face. “Not what you’re thinking. Not big scaries! Not bad guys. Well. Bad guy. But not your kind.”
“Mm,” Tony says, and tries to think of what he would say if this was some asshole at a board meeting, or someone at a gala he was trying to get money from, but even people at galas don’t usually stand so, so close. Paparazzi—but they have cameras, and questions, and not the smile that Ty has on right now. “Well, y’know. Lots of practice,” he says unevenly, and tries and fails to maneuver away.
“Sounds like you should have kept it,” Tony coughs. Laughs. Shakes his head. “Your friend. Bucky. He sounds like a good guy. He was in the, ah,” he waves his hand, uncrosses his hands from his knees so he’s slightly more relaxed, though he’s still curled around himself like he’d like to hide away as much of himself as possible.  “The comics. But he didn’t steal, in those. Mostly just…protected America.”
Steve is feeling good. Antsy, still, but the afternoon went well. That means that the next couple of days will be cleanup, and then they can go back home. He feels the Tony-Tony-Tony knot easing in his chest as he sits down on the end of his bed.
He’s not fast enough. Just as the doors are beginning to close, Ty works his way into the elevator like he’s in The Shining and he’s driven a hatchet through the doors. He smiles, too. Just like in the movie.
They sit for a while longer. Twenty minutes. Long enough that he starts tapping his foot on the ground, until Nat steps on his shoe with her own. Long enough that the waitress, a tall, middle-aged woman with her hair tied in a sharp bun, starts to get pushy and Steve orders another espresso just to tide her over. It comes in a ridiculous, tiny cup, and Nat takes pity on him and drinks it.
. The whole point of events like these, after all, is connections. (And fundraising, blah blah blah, but no one goes out of the goodness of their heart.) What kind of connections was he trying to get at a S.H.I.E.L.D.-sponsored event? It was practically given that everyone there was on StarkTech, and no one who had StarkTech would ever get anything from Viastone Corporation. What a downgrade.
Sirens hurt his ears, he held his body tight against the corner of his cell and shook his head in the lack of comfort. The raft was probably going under the waves for the last time. Ross had packed up and left a few days ago, watching Steve with eyes that couldn’t be read. It was intimidating at first, but by the time he walked away the captain could let himself be relieved at the fact that he wasn’t dragged from the cell. Actually, he hadn’t left the cell in a while now that he thought about it. His last testing must have been a while ago because the pain was gone and usually he was never without an ache or a bruise the serum once healed upon impact. It was a really nice feeling and almost brought a sense of emotion through his veins, but he couldn’t really feel anything anymore; besides the physical pain.
Part of him knew he deserved this fate, sitting in silence for the rest of his life until the man came searching for answers, but a part of him knew there was so much more. All of the fighting he’s done took away the life he never got to live; the soldier never got to travel, to try foreign food and fly in a real plane. He never got to buy his own car or meet friends down in the city for coffee and it was meaningless, but it was everything. A part of him wanted to live a life without pausing for a war, without craving a war. His mind was circling around the idea of being so happy that he could go stretches at a time without picturing a bomb blowing up the current building around him.
“No. Barnes its too early, don’t start any of that now. Baby, you don’t have to talk about it. But, let's talk.”
Well, any permanent success, because as he continued to stretch against the seams, the voice of the hero he loved wrapped around him and held him together piece by shattered piece. He was wrapped up tight and smothered in ribbons and that was okay, for a moment he felt soft heat prodding at him until he gave in to it. It was so soothing and before it could melt away arms were caving in around him.
This time he felt anger, eyebrows burrowing in betrayal as he finally gained back his movement. He stormed over to the dresser, throwing open the drawer and harshly wrenching the phone from its place. The furniture shook under the pressure and he flipped open the device just as it came to the side of his unkempt face.
Opening his eyes he turned his head, freezing at the shock written across the man's face. Part of him was scared, what was going on, but another part just stared back and waited patiently for him to get his discovery out. He must of read something on his phone and-
Under the weight of a new person, the mattress dipped, arms bracing themselves around him as the familiar face dove around the corner. He stared at Steve with such love, such protection and it was then that Steve knew he figured it out.
“That's what gets you to laugh? Really? Babe, you only seem to want to talk when you’re feeling sassy.”
A curl of ice cold shame shot through him, straight to his stomach as he forced a few words between his lips.
“I am actually going to bring you some clothes, maybe that brown sweater you always tried to steal from me. This gown, as skimpy as it is, which you know I love skimpy on you, is getting a bit out of style.”
“I know, it’s terrifying, I went through very similar things, but you have all these people on your side and you have to trust us.”
“I love you so much. I wanted to come home, but by the time I made up my mind it was too late. I don’t want you coming here. I don’t want you finding me..”
The silence was more than an answer, Tony sitting up and shaking his head before throwing it in his hand.
The man’s face flooded through his mind, flashes of his nightmare shoving him into more silence before he could decide to speak.
The forearms pressing into his stomach lessened their hold, lowering just enough to raise his shirt as the sound of water snapped him back into reality.
The hand trailing his finally caught up, holding tightly to his fingers as they shook viciously underneath.
“Tony-” The word was forced out from between his lips, a breath releasing into the air with instant regret. He tended to get quiet during panic attacks, words limited as he curled into himself and tried to hide from the world.
Whatever it was, it hummed drastically under his ear as a hand began racing across his skin. Flinching a couple times in displeasure he let himself be maneuvered as the far away voice grew louder. It was almost screaming, but his ears really hurt and have been acting funny for the past couple days anyway. So he was fine-
Bucky crouched in front of him as the sheets fully disappeared, face holding in a lifetime of sadness as a small smile painted itself across his face to hide it. No words were spoken, metal and flesh sliding under his shoulders to hoist him up to a sitting position. Tony came around next, a new sweater folded protectively in his arms along with a pair of pajama bottoms.
The pain bled into his soul, mentally and physically, he had a hard time in the darkness and his senses were losing their control day by day. Almost half of his bones from toes to fingers had been bruised or broken in the past- however long it had been, and it was the current pain across his back that held him down. He could barely feel his fingers anymore, the shaking against his will, and leaning back against the wall only made it worse, so sitting up in the middle of the empty cell pulled his muscles like an arrow painfully awaiting a release.
The cafeteria was empty when they stepped inside, Steve found himself exhausted and a bit dizzy from the elevator, so they sat at the nearest table to the door. Tony sat across from him, holding his pulse under his fingers and looked around before sighing.
The scent was calming and as the hands scrubbed him clean he felt his stress soothing back down. Tony was too focused on the wash that he only had himself to turn to, closing his eyes and falling back into the seat. He hadn’t even realized he was moving forward and upon further notice he saw he was holding onto his husbands elbow.
Crossing his eyebrows he took in the words with confusion, silently asking the man what was going on. Even as the phone dropped to the ground and the man was hovering over him he had yet to figure out what was happening.
“What the fuck do you want me to do, Steve? Give him a home in my tower? Give him money and set him up with a new life? He’s a criminal!”
Unable to get any words past his lips he felt his face melt, tears dripping down the sides of his face with absolute defeat and sorrow painted across his thoughts.
He grabbed the hand reaching for the cloth, holding tightly for as long as he could. The morning was so quiet, so spaced out from everyone, and he didn’t want anyone to feel like what happened was their fault.
Lips pressed against his cheeks, fingers running through his hair and the tangles were excruciating, but he didn’t want it to stop. Now that there was a sliver of hope he was terrified to lose it and he could feel himself on the edge of everything coming to a stop.
He was bathed every three days here, it was tiring ever since they made him start walking over by himself. Last time they made him undress himself too, he had not nearly enough energy for that.
Interrupting the voice he felt the impact of another blow, trying to rid himself of the sobs finding their way back into his head. His cheeks were warm under the pressure and after a cry burst from his lips he flinched wildly at the sound of soft music running through the halls.
“Somethings going on,” fingers ran through his hair behind him, “and I am trying to figure it out on my own here. But, only you can tell me what you need, so let me in.”
His hands began trembling anxiously, patience thin until he heard movement and a small timid voice grew from the other end.
Buck took over a lot of the physical therapy, Tony was usually still here, but recently he had been in an out with something business related. Given it was only during PT, so an hour every couple days, but it was enough to give Bucky some time alone with him. He found himself beginning to move a lot more, they wanted him to start sitting up and walking soon, but that terrified him. The moment he became independent he would be left alone and people could sneak in corners. They could linger around the shadows and strike the moment no one was paying attention, so he was fine like this. At least until they became annoyed with him, when they would threaten to leave he would pace himself.
“Theres a bug. It was hydra, but he said he and I know that means someone was there we don’t know about. They said that raft was shut down after the whole incident with- No. Barnes we have to figure this out!”
Allowing himself a quick nod he turned to the new sweater sitting on the counter, using it as motivation as a cloth was stuffed into his hand.
There was a mask on his face the next time he woke up and his arms were too heavy for him to lift to remove it. The presence of the glasses were still there and he felt needles all over his skin. His finger was pinched between plastic and before he could focus on anything stronger there was a hand against his cheek.
Lips attempted to calm him, pressing against his temple and soothing the soft swelling of skin that was still trying to heal. Wincing to himself he found to be pushed backward, lying on his back and staring dreadfully up at the ceiling.
His skin shivered under the strokes of the towel and the will to stay awake was quickly leaking away. A part of him was needing to do it himself, he didn’t need someone treating him like a child, but by the time he gained the courage he was dressed and sprawled across the sheets.
“Things like this happen, trust me. There is no one against you or thinking any less of you, but that was a big one, Steve. I think we just need to stop by and see if there is anything to help you a bit more.”
The man looked upset at the fact, but he was always in the room when Steve woke up and for that he couldn’t exactly blame him. Bucky was usually in here too, but for the second time he was missing from the formation as the time Steve was going through his therapy. He hated it, almost too much, and struggled through everything they forced him to do. Tony tried to help, but every shift of his muscles ached and he ended up being sore for days.
His sobs didn’t stop, the arms around him were too tight and it didn’t take a genius to figure out what he was trying to say. The psychiatrist had left, Bucky tried calming him down, and now the whispering was hard to listen to as he continued to break down.
This is the shortest chapter I have ever written in my life, however this is the end of the story that was saved in my drive- I don't know, I probably fell into an anxiety ridden hibernation- however now I will have to find the will to carry this story on with new ideas so PLEASE throw me ideas or anything you think would fit into this story since we are technically all reading this for the first time together.
He continued to slam his fingers against the keyboard, typing until the map crushed his lungs inside his chest. The marking of Steve’s location dropped him to the ground, eyes pouring a flood of tears down his cheeks as the first sob suffocated him.
Please let me know if you like it, however I want you to keep in mind I am NOT a doctor so as we continue to read let's ignore all the medical advice that it probably not true.
He opened his mouth to speak, pleading for something, but nothing came out and the devastation was harsh. In the darkness his tears didn’t stop, pooling in the material hiding them as another hand fell into his.
He watched the man fold it neatly on the counter top, safe and sound as he was leaned back into the seat. The sob in his chest was still growing and it wasn’t until a cloth smothered his cheek that he noticed he was crying.
He had a hard time figuring out what time was when, he kind of wished he had a clock in the room, but until then he couldn’t really distort when he was supposed to be awake.
“Sorry- I’m not upset with you, I know you can’t control it. I just wish the signs were a bit more clearer, that's all. Maybe we should see her today-”
With nothing to hold on to he fell into the splashes and let the waves take over him as a presence returned directly to his side. He was dragged into the familiar chest and before he could squeal his surprise a kiss was dropped against his forehead.
The cries brought a tear from his own, trickling down his face with a few more starting to trail after.
Waking up was petrifying. When he woke up he could actually open his eyes and the first thing he saw was a tv. He must have been on something because he wanted to laugh, but the voice to his left had him questioning everything.
Time seemed to flash, the soapy water dripping down his body as the hands continued cleansing it. Soft words bled into the air and despite the moments he was too out of it to understand, the tones were enough to keep him still. Hiding himself within the other kept him together just long enough to hear the door open as more footsteps appeared.
Why is he keep dragging on about this visit? Steve hated the doctor and this room and this beeping by his head- Why didn’t Tony understand that he just wanted to go home? He was tired of being locked up in rooms and cells every day.
They talked until Steve fell asleep, or until the medication took him, but he thinks it was exhaustion because otherwise he wouldn’t have woken up through nightmares. The loud beeping grew the pounding in his head and it wasn’t until Tony pulled him from the bed up into his arms that he calmed down. In this daze he thought he was screaming, but he wasn’t even close and the only sounds aside from the machines were the shushing from the older man.
The emotions must of been still running, his eyes growing thicker at the idea of his husband being by his side.
“You gotta breathe, hey, listen to me! Pal, you’re gonna be okay. We are figuring this out, we’re gonna get you home and find out what happened-”
His words drifted off, frown tightening across his face at the trembling around him. The sound of a sniffle had his eyes drooping low as he looked at the face still hidden in a hand.
Under the weight of a new person, the mattress dipped, arms bracing themselves around him as the familiar face dove around the corner. He stared at Steve with such love, such protection and it was then that Steve knew he figured it out.
“You’re safe, me and Bucky are right here, watching over you. Nothing is happening, just a nightmare.”
With a lot of hesitance he lowered his hands under his thighs, struggling to keep them there as he bit on another cry threatening to fall out.
Shaking his head he rolled over, throat rumbling in displeasure as he was pushed back and a body sat against his side. The build of an assassin sitting against his hip was too familiar and he felt pressure behind his eyes as his lips pulled into a frown.
The words fell into a sob, breaking him from his spell as he forced himself up from the bed. He needed to track this call. This was some sick joke, he must have been somewhere in the US. Was he giving himself up? Did Ross find him? Is he trying to get something out of this phone call other than a hello?
“I am so sorry for everything. For what I put you through. You are everything to me and I don’t want you to forget me- okay? Promise me-”
“I thought I was supposed to call you? Or is this some kind of late night call because you need something from me?”
The fingers reached toward him, brushing through his bangs that were growing a bit lower on his scalp.
Sam, Bucky, Tony.. they could live without Captain America; and they could damn well live without Steve Rogers causing battles left and right. Besides, the last thing he saw was the snapping of fingers and the gasps of pain, the sobs all around, there was no way the man he loved lived through that.
He knew. Natasha went deep undercover, shield, or what it used to be, couldn’t afford to lose her. They needed her intelligence so she was quickly welcomed back easily enough. If she wouldn’t have signed they probably would have had a harder time.
The first thing he was going to say was thank you to Tony for bringing a thicker blanket. It was the quilt that Pepper got as a christmas gift all those years ago and he forgot how weighted and warm it was until this moment. As it was tucked around him he took time to focus on the man doing it, Tony’s eyes tired and wrinkled in stress as he mumbled a song under his breath.
He couldn’t look at Bucky, not after that. His gaze locked on the floor and he tried to control his breathing as he ignored her words.
Nodding, he handed the bowl back, spoon hidden at the bottom where it slid down the side of the dish.
He was brushing through Steve’s hair softly, getting through the tangles with a comb as the first bite was taken. It sat heavy in his stomach, but he pushed through it until most of the food was gone.
The suit peeled away and he was tugged carefully into a chest, smothered in sweat stained clothes as another set of hands tugged his own behind his back. It was not comfortable, he wanted to tug free to gain back an ounce of freedom, but the scent that overwhelmed him kept him at ease.
“I have worked with many patients, none the same, not even close. Each situation hits someone differently and if he’s not ready to share right now it’s okay.”
“You’re alright, baby,” the chuckle wasn’t one of judgement, just admiration as he ran a finger down the side of his face.
He was okay as the door opened across the spacious area, drawing a flinch from his limbs as he subconsciously pushed backwards across the floor. He was okay as silent tears dripped down the sides of his face as footsteps grew heavier the closer they got to his bars. Steve Rogers would be fine even as the key jammed into the lock and swung open the heavy door, new breathing filling his space as the lights flashed on and sent him into a world of pain. Each cry of pain was worth it, he knew his fate was sealed and as he was dragged toward the all too familiar room of agony he let it happen.
There was a bit of yelling before a light flashed across the room and at first he thought the lights were coming on so he hid his face, but through the motion he saw a soft blue and grew a bit confused. It was the first time he wasn’t blinded and as the flash made itself closer the voice seemed to get a bit louder. It wasn’t an angry shout or an order, it was almost worried. He watched it hit every empty cell around him before landing on him and he had to close his eyes as it sat vibrantly against him for a bit too long. He almost thought it was stuck, it barely flinched from its sight and before he could reach out to see if it was his last one it dropped to the ground. The crash shook him from his stupor and as the bars began to slide open he shot back from the commotion. The guards never came in the dark, they still thought that he could take them out despite his pain. Also, each step toward him was uneven, rushed and unclear as a hand wrapped too tightly around his bicep. Of course he winced, but it was then again silent and his face must have expressed his pain as he was tugged into some kind of cold material.
He couldn’t respond, his body was too exhausted, but he thinks they knew that because the question was ignored, more the lack of an answer, and Tony stood to wrap himself around the man’s upper half. There was barely any contact at all, but the warmth was soothing enough and he curled into it as much as he could before closing his eyes. He let himself listen to the cries with desire for more and fought to stay awake as long as his body would allow.
It normally would have broken his heart, but he didn’t have the right. Crawling back because he was lonely? No.
Recognizing the tune he cut his next slog, flashes of the feeling of Tony against him the night of their wedding. He remembered the weight of the head against his chest, arms running up and down his back as friends and family gathered around their elated stances. The idea that he did not have to be the strong one for once, letting himself take a turn leaning against his best friend as they danced in the presence of the sun going down. The orange and pink sky turned them into silhouettes as glasses clinked together and the words of the song drifted through his mind.
“Steve? Can you try to focus on me real quick? The doctor is going to be here any second and I need you to-”
He had never felt so elated, body heavy in the sheets as he let the stress fall right off his shoulders. This was the best moment of his life, he felt so alive and he only wished he could join the conversation to tell them he did love darling. And sweetheart and everything Tony spent his time coming up with.
Scrambling for the phone he breathed out another sigh, throat stuffed with sobs threatening to let loose across the empty floor that was his penthouse. It was almost terrifying, how silent everything was, and as his feet pounded against the floor in panic he let himself fall heavily onto the kitchen stool. He was barely able to catch himself on the countertop and after three rings he heard the voice he so desperately itched for.
The bowl in his lap was filled halfway with oatmeal, the spoon forced into his hand as he let out a sigh.
Chuckles melted him to the floor, a sound he swore just days- weeks? Ago that he would never hear again.
His stomach felt heavy already, he knew he wasn’t ready, but the hand in his squeezed reality into him and he quickly took a deep breath.
The soldier himself went through this, Steve knew, so the fact that he was silent as well gave Steve a sense of control and support.
“Tony, I think you just need to get some rest. You might feel better with a clear mind and then we can decide which path to take here-”
Tony swallows. Fury’s stopped talking, now, and is looking at him expectantly. Ty accomplished his goal, apparently. Tony is thoroughly thrown off.
It’s meant to sound sort of half-joking, half-interested. It comes out like he’s annoyed. He nearly curses, then nearly apologizes, but Tony speaks.
Tony stares hard at the comms device. He just needs something to think about so that he doesn’t think about Ty. About Ty being so close to him. So, he thinks about the comms device. What it really needs is more power, and it can’t be any bigger, but he can work around that by—
Ah, shit. Well, Steve knows why that is, and it’s not because he hates gay people. Quite the opposite. It’s because he likes a
And that’s odd. Because Steve has told Tony. He’s pretty sure of that. He’s…he hasn’t told Tony, has he. “I’m bi,” he says with a shrug. “Men, women, anyone else.”
Tony pulls a mug out of the cabinet, sets it down on the counter a little too hard. The coffee machine dings, and Tony pours his mug full to the brim.
sound. And then immediately regrets doing that because even the quiet sound sends his head spinning.
Tony smiles. He definitely doesn’t smile this much, usually. Maybe he should stop smiling. His cheeks hurt, actually, but his whole body feels stiff, painted on. He's not sure he can stop. He counts to three, and stops smiling. There.
joke, but he can’t spare the words—every syllable he speaks squeezes his head like a lemon. He tries to stand up so he can
In case anyone was wondering, the names Natasha mentions are translations of the Cyrillic ones that Bucky mentions in Ch. 7.
“Don’t start,” Tony warned as he consented to the white sneakers. “Where are Pietro and Sam, though? They agreed to be here.”
“When I said we didn’t need to go overboard,” Steve mentioned cautiously as he circled the room and prodded at the strings of tinsel, “I meant we could just give everyone some beer and popcorn while we watched a movie.”
“Family meetings are when there’s bad news to break,” Clint corrected as the waitress set the pop tarts in front of him. “This is a family outing.”
“Bruce would have been here, but he… Doesn’t always do well in crowds,” Bucky supplied, gesturing at the still-present clump of people at the other end of the football field.
“I resemble that remark, Sir,” the AI quipped, “and I think I’ve been programmed to be an excellent companion.”
“Half the fun is in the suspense!” Peter countered, turning his attention back to the count. “Forty-nine!”
Her scream of frustration in response nearly blew the speakers, but left and audible thud as Bucky fell back to the mat.
Clint had drug the twins out of bed this morning with the promise of breakfast (even if morning for Clint was something more like 11am) if they came with him. When Clint had jostled her shoulder in an effort to wake her, Wanda had hauled herself out of bed, bleary-eyed and citing that there had better be coffee involved.  Pietro had taken some poking and prodding to rouse; he’d thrown a pillow at his sister when she called him lazy, and been dressed before Clint or Wanda could even cross his threshold.
Peter nearly fell out of the elevator, tripping on a shoelace and catching himself against the doors. “Sorry I’m late! I just— this stupid vest— and the iron—”
Wanda met Sam’s eyes, blinking in awe at his question. “No one talks about the Red Room around her.”
“Fine. But if this blows up, literally or figuratively, I hope you know that you asked for it,” Bucky warned as he headed back to the elevator. “I need to go get ready.”
Wanda turned her head to look up at him, eyes still shining with laughter. “I’ve never done this!” She waved a hand around the room. “Is this what Americans are like?”
“Papa Roach, they are called,” her voice was thick, tears still spilling down her face as Bucky’s grip tightened on her hands. “The song is, ah, ‘Periscope’ as they say.”
, Tony thought in mock-annoyance. He was glad someone bothered to listen to him, even if the someone happened to have been a source of embarrassment for him only twenty minutes ago. He let Bucky go without further comment, sparing a glance to make sure he had bothered to put on a helmet before addressing the rest of the assembled bodies.
She felt the mattress dip near her feet as Tony sat down, nudging her leg aside in the process as he pulled his feet up. “If you insist, I’ll harass you here and now then.” Tony peered down at her, waiting for a response. After a few minutes of the silent treatment, he shrugged, picking the conversation back up himself. “I wasn’t kidding about the sheets-- can’t change them when the bed is constantly occupied, Natasha.”
Peter let her pull him in for another hug and smiled before she turned and made her way toward the parking lot. He wasn’t expecting Mister Stark to pull him in for his own hug. “Thank you for coming, Mister Stark.”
Tony brightened, leaving his nearly-empty scotch in Steve’s hand and coming to usher Bruce in. “I wasn’t sure you’d be joining us, Brucie!”
“I do not think my rejection was the only factor, no,” she agreed. “Though my lack of interest in my powers since Lagos is probably more likely.”
Wanda bit back a laugh, handing her coat to the consultant and looking back to Nat with a grin. Natasha followed suit, muttering some approximation of thank you to the man as the elevator came to a stop.
Scott wrapped the towel around his waist, grimacing as a glob of frosting fell from his hair onto the floor. “This will take weeks to wash out, Barton. Weeks!” Eyeing the table of food, Scott raised an eyebrow at Tony. “The entertainment charges a fee— food, a robe, and a game of beer pong.”
“Clint,” Pietro said slowly, taking deliberate steps until he was standing right in front of his caretaker, “she would never harm a team member. But she wants to prove this to herself. He will not harm her. Bucky is not the Winter Soldier anymore.”
“Then let me tell you some things-- things that she’s said in the Commons, not here in my office-- about her time there. She was young when she went with the KGB, an orphan who felt like she had no other option. When they began her training, they masqueraded it like ballet until they earned her trust.”
Sam couldn’t catch his breath, still reeling from the emotional pain she had displayed for him. “I need you to take my advice on something.”
“Maybe it’s just the Stark extravagance rubbing off on him,” Nat snickered, wiping the corners of her eyes with the back of her hand.
Steve cocked an eyebrow, though whether it was at Bucky or Tony was unclear, and turned to walk back into his closet. With his bullshit meter already overflowing before the team had even left, there wasn’t much for Tony to do other than stand in the hall and suffer the awkward silence while Barnes smirked at him. Tony started his assessment of Bucky’s outfit, starting at his boots to avoid eye contact (which could invite a conversation about what the hell was that) before noting the dark jeans and skimming upwards to find a white t-shirt.
Bucky’s eyes circled the room, looking for Wanda, and finding her leaning against the bar, head thrown back in laughter at Peter’s enthusiasm. He’d been taken aback by the way her skirt had caught every light source in the room all night, drawing his eyes to her again and again, unable to ignore her every move. The sheer magnetism of the sequins, he told himself as he crossed the room to hop up on the bar next to Wanda, who could ignore that?
“When did I say you had to pretend?” Tony was genuinely perplexed. “Natasha, I’ve been where you are, in case you’ve forgotten. Rock bottom and I are intimately acquainted. You don’t want to go out? Fine. Let me at least get you down to a retail floor with a spa. Get a massage. Get a face mask. Do something for yourself other than wallowing, for your own sake.”
Wanda remained there for a moment, enveloped in the the love of her family, still shaking from the cathartic release of her power and emotions. “Clint?”
How the hell had he just lost almost two hours playing “Dress Up The Avengers”? Come to think of it, that was probably an app someone had— no, no, now was not the time to investigate every whim his head concocted. It was time to round up the damn Brady Bunch he had spent all morning chasing after and be en route to Midtown High School of Science and Technology before they completely blew the surprise. With a huff he turned on his heel to shout at Bucky and Steve, both of which were murmuring quietly about something or other down the hall right where he had left them. “KNUCKLE AND CHUCKLE, LET’S GET OUT OF HERE.”
“You look nice,” Wanda offered as Natasha leaned against the door of town car. “It is… good to see you out of bed, Natasha.”
Tony opened and closed his mouth a few times, sighing in frustration, before the question was answered for him.
Peter and Pietro dissolved into laughter as Steve’s expression shifted from indignant to bewildered. It wasn’t clear if Steve understood the slang Tony had used or if he had merely reacted to the tone of Tony’s voice, but the specifics weren’t necessary when they cast another look at Steve’s face.
“Thank you, Aunt May,” Peter said sincerely before looking toward Tony and motioning. “Mister Stark!”
“At least you already handled the kids, and Bruce can handle himself,” Natasha said from Clint’s kitchen, dressed in a simple black sheath and boots. Oversized sunglasses perched on her head, presumably the ‘blend in’ portion of her outfit that Tony had just moments ago demanded. Not bothering to justify her sarcasm with a response, he turned to say something to Steve, only to find he wasn’t on the couch as he had been before he went to berate Clint’s wardrobe choices.
“Is there going be glitter?” Bucky asked from the deck, the sliding door still open as he tugged his jacket a little tighter around him. “I don’t want to wash any glitter out of my damn hair, Tony!”
“No, no, no, and hell no. You stay here with Clint. I don’t want to think about you— dressing, or undressing— Barnes. I’ll go, since I’m clearly ready to go with time to spare!” Stark snapped, gesturing to his standard apparel of t-shirt and jeans.
“Steven, I will take your phone,” Tony warned as he swatted Steve on the arm. “They’ll get here when they get here! There isn’t a curfew!”
Pietro nodded against Sam’s shoulder, shuddering before he stood up and gathered his makeshift bed. “I need her to be okay. Please help her,” he whispered.
The school song cued in time with the clapping, and they threw their caps, an odd farewell custom to the end of four years. Retrieving the cap from the grass, Peter didn’t linger to say his goodbyes to anyone else. He headed for the seats, stopping at the bottom of the stairs and waving up to everyone, indicating they should come down to meet him.
“What does he mean nice— shit!” Tony had been so busy worrying about everyone else, he hadn’t had five minutes to change his own clothes. Now he was sporting an acid-washed AC/DC shirt and simple blue jeans.
Peter stood, surprised that his legs felt more sure than his head did as he strode to meet Principal Hughes, accepting the diploma and firm handshake with a smile. Exiting as they had been instructed at rehearsal (down the stairs to meet at the front of the stage in prep for the cap toss), Peter’s eyes kept straining towards the team and Aunt May. Only when the last person took their diploma did he regain focus on the task at hand. This was it— it would all be over in moments. There was no nostalgic tinge, no regrets. Unlike the movies, he was ready, really ready to move on.
Pietro wrinkled his nose and stilled, looking annoyed. “Absolutely not,” he chastised, “now pay attention because we don’t have long. I’ve heard that you trained Natasha in the Red Room. What did you do when you trained her?”
“Did I authorize you to plan the food? Jarvis, is that a thing that I did?” Tony asked in mock-annoyance. Truth be told, he really didn’t care what they ate, but he knew that Clint did. There was entirely more food than they needed, spread across two tables that the caterers had kindly set up before being dismissed by security, but it wasn’t hurting his bank account enough to warrant more than teasing. “You know I expect everyone to eat two helpings at least, with the amount of food you can thank Barton for.”
“Something you two geezers want to share with the class?” Before the day’s end he was surely going to burst a blood vessel.
“I can’t believe you’re all here,” Peter blurted as he looked around. “Except… where’s Doctor Banner?”
The Maximoff twins were the best kid substitute Clint was ever going to get, and if pranking the other Avengers with Pietro wasn't a reminder, nothing could be. The pair were huddled on the catwalk of the shooting range, holding their breaths for the next time Sam needed to reload his pistol. When the moment came, Clint let out a breath as Pietro disappeared, coming back up before Clint could count to two. Sam’s eyes had been on his weapon, and he fired quickly before cursing at the miscalculation in his aim. This went on three more times, a mere 3cm movement of the targets each time, before Sam began examining his Ruger for defects. Clint bit back a snort and high-fived his blonde prodigy-- not for the first time, he wished he had more memories like this with them.
“You could give him a bike,” Natasha noted from her spot on the couch, sketching the layout of the decorations.
Pulling his feet over the edge, he slid closer, pulling her hands from the railing to take them in his. “Who sings that?”
Natasha smirked as she sidestepped Pietro to stand with Peter, sticking her tongue out at Clint’s befuddled expression. Giving Sam a nod, she nudged Peter to cue posing— he looked largely conflicted about the prospect of a slew of pictures, but obliged by smiling as Sam pressed the shutter. Clint had successfully inched around them, unknown to Peter but (most likely) just being selectively ignored by Nat, he stretched between them and pointed at Sam. Enthusiastic bunny ears went up around Peter and Nat’s heads as Sam struggled to keep a straight face and held up a finger to hold them there for another.
“Room service,” Tony’s voice called through the door, “and we need you to vacate bed in order to change the sheets, ma’am.”
The corner of her mouth twitched before she consented, downing the small bottle of juice before studying her fingers. “I am not angry that they built these bots.”
He didn’t realize how lost he had been in his own thoughts until Tony shut off the car and tapped his knee.
for being my patient and honest beta. This chapter's quality improved exponentially with her help, as she always keeps me true to my vision and my plot.
Tony’s eyes widened, hardly believing that suggestion could have possibly just come from America’s Golden Boy, at precisely the same moment that Bucky fell to the floor in hysterical laughter. He looked helplessly to Natasha, completely flustered by Bucky’s reaction, only to see that she had joined in on the snickering.
“I’ll take resembling my mother as a compliment, James Buchanan Barnes,” Steve huffed as he settled on the couch, eyes lingering on the elevator door. “I’m just saying, you’d think they’d be on time. There isn’t a commute.”
Wanda didn’t answer, but emerged minutes later in only the body suit, looking much more in her element than she had in any of the previous outfits.
“You said not to toy with you, and yet you couldn’t hit me when I was practically on top of you,” Bucky commented casually as he continued to dance around her. “A pity, really. I thought you’d be a challenging opponent, Wanda.”
“YOU NEVER SAW HIM!” Wanda’s voice was rising every time she spoke. “You know nothing of Ultron, Peter, so how could you ever know if you have created another or not?”
“Alright, that leaves eight of us, and Peter’s coming back here later for the party— which, for the love of all that is holy, no one tell him. This is a SURPRISE party, remember?” He shot a glance at Clint. “That includes hints, or comments about how great the food will be later. Got it?”
“I knew you would come back to me. I knew it- Why am I paying these doctors to tell me shit I know, its a load of-”
The tapping of his foot against the bed stopped, chair screeching against the ground as he shot up and stormed from the room. Steve tried to feel anything other than relieved, but he couldn’t bring it upon himself and didn’t bother watching the man go.
“I got some of the best shit you’ve ever seen, got the tangles out with barely any cutting at all. I know you would hate me if you woke up without any hair.”
“Alright,” Tony pulled away the cup, tossing it on the counter behind him before handing the blond a cloth. Steve wiped his face quickly, turning away and curling up toward the window.
Tony scoffed, sitting on the edge of the bed close enough to where his hip pressed against Steve’s rib cage. He hovered over him with hope glossing over his eyes and lips dropping against his forehead.
There was only silence on the other end, making him angrier at first. He pulled the phone away, looking at the number and watching the time tick further ahead.
The familiar voice should have shook him to his core, but the flashing bright lights distracted him and he couldn’t see the face behind his viscously shaking fingers. They protected his eyes from the unfamiliar brightness and as an arm hooked around his biceps he let loose a silent shudder of discomfort.
“Don’t give me those puppy eyes, Punk, You are gonna get it back, I promise. I’ll even put it on the counter, see?”
He could accept the loneliness, because chances are if he’s here, everyone else is pardoned. Without the lights he knew that no one else was locked away in this underground chamber, that he was the only one and it let him attempt to sleep at night. His suffering was saving lives and at the end of the day, that's what he needed. To be a good man, not a perfect soldier. Given, he wasn’t exactly a good man by any means, but he knows that some choices could clean a bit of red off his ledger. He would never be perfect, but he could atone for some sins he so clearly made the past few years. And he was okay with that.
“You’re alright, just work through it, baby. It’s going to get a bit tough at first, but nothing painful, I promise.”
He too stared at the man in shock as he jumped off the bed as if it was on fire. Steve could only breathe in sharply, trying to figure out what was going on as his gaze darted between the two.
“I just-” there was a bit of silence, drawing out for almost too long before he began to speak again, “I just wanted to hear your voice.”
“Tony, I think you just need to get some rest. You might feel better with a clear mind and then we can decide which path to take here-”
A hand turned his face, locking their gazes just long enough to press their foreheads together. His vision was growing blurred and he gasped out a few breaths as the man continued to speak.
The suit under his fingers was so cold, it soothed the burning of his joints and the beard scraping against his temple grew into comfort for the first time in years. Relief flooded into his veins and for once hope dared push against his conscience. His swollen, crushed fingers rose until they found solace around the familiar neck and tightened as much as they could. Damp cheeks pushed into the hold and his gasps made no sounds as they fought to escape.
Tightening his hand wasn’t painful, he knew he was on drugs, but it was difficult. The small saddened flip of Tony’s lips was a sign that the pressure didn’t exist and he couldn’t even feel the fact.
It had been fourteen months and eleven days since he was left in that bunker and he still can’t come to terms that he was left behind. He knew that Barnes was his best friend, he even considered the man to be one of his first lovers, however Steve had always promised that Tony was his always and the man had believed him. He had believed him so much that he had proposed at that stupid park in Brooklyn, the one Steve had loved more than anything, and they promised to be together until they physically couldn’t be anymore. He had held him, been held by him, and felt like nothing in his life would ever come close to how fulfilled he felt in those moments.
It was actually the doing of said man that got him off the field, storming in the directors office and demanding enough time off to drag him across the country to the best he could find. Session after time hoarding session he spoke as much as he could, leaning into the warmth in his side as they tried to figure out what was going on. He had felt these feelings long before the serum, but since waking up they had grown harder to control and he was having such a hard time adjusting. Even now, three years later, the simplest of tasks take his focus and shred it up into pieces, dowsing him in flames of terror and no medication was helping. The serum was picking at his remains and sealing his fate despite the thread of hope trying its best to stitch him together.
Yet here he was, lying against a chair, lying his face on the cold glass of the window, and letting himself focus on nothing by the dark skies until any other thought
“See? He gets it,” the man pulled the sheet up a little higher toward his chin, covering his chest completely with one hand, “and he gets me. If only everyone understood me like you do.”
The hand trailing his finally caught up, holding tightly to his fingers as they shook viciously underneath.
He doesn’t know how long they laid there, but he does know that by the time he came back down to earth he was curled into a familiar chest. Inhaling the world around him he opened his eyes to the darkers ones ahead, the tired ones staring right back down his way. There were no words needed and by the time he took a breath to speak the older man beat him to it.
“So, my session for the day is over, but I want you to think about your options. This scenario we are in every day, or a house by the water living with your husband retired peacefully from war.”
He grabbed Tony’s wrist almost three weeks into the hospital stay and the shock shunned everyone into silence. The man had cleaned out his feeding tube and when the nurse walked in he panicked. It was his first time seeing a stranger since the prison cell and the thought of going back shot him into action. Tony said he was just going to the fridge under the tv to grab a water, so Steve could try drinking again, and before he could let go of the bed Steve had moved.
The smile was so wide, it grew his a couple sizes and a couple splashes later brought Bucky into the room.
He was almost nervous at what was going on, retreating back into his own head as his friend sat on the mattress and dropped his shoulders.
His fingers shook against the cement floor, trembles harsh and uncontrollable as he struggled to take in a breath. In his chest, both lungs rattled under pressure and he could not focus on a thought as he ran through his current predicament in his head.
Tapping quickly, the cup was pulled away, taking the suffocating feeling along with it. The cup was dropped on the counter and he gagged just enough to bring emotion to his eyes.
With a nudge of his head he agreed, sucking in a deep breath before scrunching his eyes tighter together.
“I can’t handle this right now, okay? I need to get with his doctor and hopefully fix this medication they have him on. He’s not sleeping and he’s obviously exhausted. I also have to up his PT because this nurse has begun cutting our hour shorter as if we are a dent in her time. I’m not paying these people to brush us off, especially when its Steve fucking Rogers that they are messing with!”
“I don’t owe him anything! I don’t owe you anything- you left me in that bunker and now you are calling me on a phone you gave me to ask for help? Screw you. No- screw all of you. I would rather-”
“Tony,” his tone was choked up, swelling all the way down to his stomach as they did flips around his insides. A part of him knew what they were doing was right, but he also needed to smother himself away until there was nothing but him and the quiet.
“Don’t give me those puppy eyes, Punk, You are gonna get it back, I promise. I’ll even put it on the counter, see?”
“Listen, hear me and what I'm saying. You are doing good in some areas, yes? But, the weight of everything else is going to catch up and before that happens you have to get some things out of your head.”
“Okay, first, you didn’t drag me anywhere. I’ve been looking for an excuse to get out of these missions for a while. I don’t have to do anything or be anywhere I don't want to. And Sweetheart, there is nothing I want more than to be around you like this.”
Holding out his arms he smiled a bit too wide, breaking out in chuckles as Steve got just close enough to touch, but was once again duped.
Tony didn’t even bother speaking, pulling the weak body up and forward until he was rested against the familiar shoulder.
Tony was helping him get on his jacket, sliding his arms through the sleeves as he kept his eyes trained on the door. It was November twelfth, the doctors had agreed he could go home, and now he was finally going back to a recognizable place. He would get to see his team today, breathe in fresh air, see his bedroom- But, he knew he would also have to see the devastation. There were talks of a new Avengers Compound, however, Tony said that he had a cabin hidden up a little higher north since the tower had been sold those years ago.
Bucky nodded, shifting to study her. She wasn’t meeting his gaze, eyes wide as she studied the cityscape with interest. “Have you ever come out here?”
“I guess that leaves just you and me, Steve,” Tony ducked his head to conceal what may have been a blush and increased his pace to reach his R8. “I’ll drive.”
The fridge is packed. He eventually pulls out an apple—he’s not really hungry, after all—and shuts it again. Tony is still trying to turn on the coffee machine. They haven’t said a word to one another, and Steve suddenly thinks that he needs to say something, needs to say something or he’ll burst, so he says, “I’m sorry. About today. I don’t even remember what I was yelling about, but—well.” And then he very determinedly looks away from Tony and out the window.
He wasn’t going towards Tony at all. He was walking to Ty, obvious by the fact that he picks up Ty by the linty shirt collar and shoves him against the wall.
It’s just a hand. Just molecules, really, and so is air, so what’s the difference? Nothing. Nothing substantial Tony is completely—unphased. He’s unphased.
” he repeats, because his stomach is flipping and his knee is twitching, he needs to go, he needs to do something.
He’s not going to give a blowjob to someone who can’t bother to get the lint off of his collar. He’s just not.
And that was stupid, of course, because Tony’s eyes widen and his head lifts a little. “Ty?” he says. His voice is quiet and unsure, and Steve needs to punch someone again. “Here?”
He sighs, puts his phone down. What the hell is he doing? This is weird. Possessive. Tony didn’t ask for this.
Clint sighs, stares at the ceiling. “Seriously, guys, tomorrow I’m going somewhere with croissants. You can’t leave me shut up here forever. I feel like that lady in
Steve looks at Tony. At the blood dripping from his nose. At the way he’s holding himself up by leveraging himself on the counter, more leaning than standing. “So this…Ty, he drugged you. And then hit you?”
Steve sits down a few feet away from Tony. He doesn’t know what to do. In the war, people had panic attacks, though that’s not what they were called. He’s helped people through a few of them. But everything’s different now—mental health and medications and studies and Steve’s sure whatever he knows is completely inadequate.
“You wanted coffee last night. Tony, someone—you were drugged last night. At the gala. Do you remember that?” Steve asks again.
Mary Poppins. Steve nods. “Tony made me watch it. Said it was a crime that I had never seen Dick Van Dyke.” And then curled up next to Steve on the couch, singing along to the songs, and Steve wanted to kiss him, but he doesn’t add that part. Obviously.
He gets up, stretches his legs. He really should go to the gym; he has way more nervous energy than is healthy. He leaves his room and makes his way down to the fifth floor, where the gym is. Luckily, it’s empty. He hates working out in front of other people.
Beside him, Tony’s still fiddling with the coffee machine. It seems like he should have it down by now, Steve thinks, based on the sheer amount of coffee he drinks, but Tony’s weird about some things. Forgets basic stuff, like how many planets are in the solar system, even as he does science Steve can’t even begin to comprehend at a mile a minute.
Steve stands. Stretches. Their mark is leaving, that’s what the nod means, though he has no idea how Nat knows that when she hasn’t turned around once. It takes all his willpower to stay turned towards the river and not glance backward.
He taps his fingers on the counter. They’re shaking, and Ty can see that. Ty can see that his fingers are shaking and that he can’t even, can’t even build a simple comms device, what’s wrong with him—
Fury frowns. “There’s no need for that, Stark,” he says, sharply, then shoots an apologetic look to Ty. To
Well. That makes sense. S.H.I.E.L.D. often has to do apology events and fundraisers for this kind of thing, since people thinks it’s
Tiberius Stone is good looking, in a sort of fake way. All white teeth and carefully done hair. And again, when Steve sees his picture, something about it catches. As if he’s seen him before. But Steve is pretty sure he’s never met the guy.
“God, the stories he was telling me, Tony,” Ty says, and shakes his head. “Seems like you’re really stressing everyone out over here. You never were a very good team player—but of course, we balanced each other out so well that way.”
Steve’s head swings up. “What’s going on, Jarvis?” he asks. Jarvis hardly ever starts conversations with him. For a moment, he thinks that maybe he’s going to have to get suited up, there’s a threat, but no. The alert would have gone off.
“Don’t have to tell me twice,” Nat replies. “Obviously, he’s a bit…well. Anyways, I think this is a powerplay that my boss is going to lose. It’ll make him look weak in the end, which will only make his situation worse. Ugh. Anyways.”
