Steve had no idea what Tony was doing, but just watching had him in a full body laugh, head thrown back and stomach hurting with the gusto of it, "Tony!"
"I'm in a relationship," Tony repeated. "An amazing one. It's stable and loving, the kind I can grow old with."
The room is in disarray, but he's calm. His decision is the right decision, and he knows it. Not taking any questions, Tony hops off the stage and walks out where Happy is waiting for him. The din follows him through the doors but stops when they close behind him. It's like shutting the door on his old life and breathing in his new one.
"Look up, my beautiful whore." Steve purred, angling the vibrator against Tony's prostate and tapping it.
Steve went with Tony to the doctor the next morning after giving him yogurt and a banana and explaining what they thought he had. Tony wasn't happy, but any answer sounded better than not knowing. He could handle changing his diet. What he couldn't handle was continuing to be so sick every time he tried to eat.
Steve bumps his shoulder, his eyes dancing. "Hush, you." He bends his head and kisses him sweetly, going a bit red at the whooping from the others. "Anyway!" He tries to speak over the ruckus, but honestly, Steve should know with this group it's like herding cats. Tony quirks an eyebrow, trying not to laugh as Steve fights to regain some sort of control over the noise.
"We are all regulated to 33 or younger, depending on how old you were when you died. So someone younger than 33 will stay that age; if you're older, you go back to how you looked at 33."
Smiling, Steve gently adjusts him. "Hey, Shellhead." He's happy to see clarity shining out from the wide brown eyes. "Hungry?" Tony nods, pushing himself up and wincing. "Careful, Tony, let me help you."
Until he felt someone squeeze his ass and a lascivious voice whispered in his ear. "Ditch the loser and come home with me."
It was hard to believe in theory, but the man seated on the couch looked a hell of a lot like Howard Stark. It was an easy thing to prove. She just needed some DNA, and Bruce could test it against Tony's. Not that she didn't believe Steve, she just never judged anything at face value.
"That's it, sweetheart. Come on." Steve pulled at the brown strands, making Tony's neck bend back just enough to look up at him "Take it all, you can do it." Tony's mouth opened, and he let Steve guide his cock halfway in, the considerable length and girth filling him until his pretty lips were stretched wide around his shaft. "I bet you look just as good being filled from the other end as well, huh?"
"Thank God for small miracles. Look," he pointed, "it's right there. That house on the same side as the fire department?"
"I didn't- Were you always a queer?" He asked Steve. Again, it was the wrong thing to say. It was like he couldn't keep his word vomit from spewing out all over the place. "Fuck, I'm sorry I- But were you?" Nothing was making sense. How did he not know? How had this happened?
Three candles were lit on his makeshift altar: a white one for cleansing, a purple one for dispelling negativity, and a black one for protection and to give power to the spell. He had traveled to Egypt to gather sand, to Israel for a vial of water from the Dead Sea, to Scotland to gather earth, and to Japan to pluck a feather from a Red-Crowned Crane. He anointed the altar with sage from India and olive oil from Italy. All things said to give the spell more power.
"New pots and pans as well," Natasha said, standing to open the bottom cupboards to show him before closing them and flicking closed the ones Clint had left open. "Under the gluten counter are some of the old pots and dishes the rest of us will use."
"Natural History. Tomorrow at 2 work?" The door opened, and Steve watched as Tony came out, balancing a tray of steaks in one hand and two more beers for him and Steve in the other. Steve stood; he’d let Tony make the salad -- it was hard to mess up chopping vegetables -- but there was no way he was letting Tony anywhere near the grill. "Hill got those books too.  She's going to drop them off on Friday."
Checking in on the hangover buddies, Steve found both Clint and Howard still asleep exactly where he had left them. Natasha was nowhere to be found, but her jacket was missing from the hook by the door. With Tony safely in his workshop and everyone else accounted for, he entered his apartment, stripping as he went. A nice hot shower would do wonders for his exhausted mind.
He held him at night and felt the pounds as they eroded away from Tony's body, did his best to soothe the pressure that bloated his belly with soft circular motions, watched as his skin became pale, and coaxed him through the heart palpitations.
"-And see what he sees. The man he loves has never done anything even remotely not heterosexual. Ever."
"No, fuck, no. Forget I said anything." Linking their hands together, Tony rolled his body, letting his eyes flutter closed as he felt Steve shift inside him.
Sucking on a breath at the words, his chest rising sharply as arousal spiked through him, Tony let one of his knees go to grapple at Steve's shoulder. "I stick it to the wall. In my bedroom-" He gasped as Steve rubbed his prostate just a little harder as a reward for telling him. "-In the shower. Anywhere I want. And I sit on it. It's huge, like you. Fills me so good."
a spy after all; he knew his job. He knew when to drop the comedic act. "So, we need to get moving on the memory serum and double down on research to send him back. After we do that, the news and Twitter can say what they want; he won't be here to prove anything." Gesturing to Hill, he raised his eyebrows, pleading, "You can help with that, right? Help us go through all these boring books and find out how to send him home."
happens and you're back in my life?" Tony rounded the island, jabbing his finger into Howard's chest.
Sometimes, the fans really had the worst timing. It wasn't their fault, so he never begrudged them any of it. He tried as best he could to sign as many of the papers shoved in front of him and to lean into as many selfies as possible before a petite girl with blonde pigtails and a studded choker pushed through the crowd. "Are you here for coffee, Mister Stark?" she called out over the din.
The hand on his arm was gone, and Tony was bolting from the room. Steve barely had time to react before Howard was throwing his arms around him and whooping in excitement. "It worked! It worked!"
"You're all mouth is what you are," Tony grumbled, lifting into his elbows and pushing himself up into a sitting position.
my friends from back in the war. I miss Bucky and the rest of the Commandos. I missed you and Peggy and everything. And I really didn't have anyone to talk to about it who was there or understood what I had gone through."
Nodding again, Tony left before he could say anything else, hurrying back down the hallway and escaping into his rooms, blinking away tears. He closed the door soundlessly and leaned against it. Before anything else, he needed to get himself under control. There was no way he could walk into the kitchen to face Steve and Bruce like this.
They slowed, catching their breaths. Tony gripped Steve's solid arms, anchoring himself against the wall of his soldier: his protector, his absolute soulmate. He let his hands slide up to cup Steve's face, taking a moment to drink in his beauty: his eyes, his jawline, his nose…everything. Tony felt the love he had for this man explode in between them, and he surged forward to take his mouth, kissing deeply and breathlessly, conveying without words just how utterly in love he was with him.
"I guess that's fair. Can I have a hint?" He tried, picking up a melon with his fingers. She made a face and slid a fork across the counter.
Tony snorted, choosing a seat after he signed in and watching as Natasha flipped through one of the magazines. "Welcome to my life."
Steve's heart ached. "Okay, Tony, but you have to promise to eat later." Tony nodded. "Anything you want to do today?"
Adjusting slightly so he could burrito them under the blankets, Steve kissed Tony's head and remained quiet. He could hear the sniffling and feel the hitched breaths on his collar. Tony was crying and Steve couldn't blame him, but pointing it out was a sure fire way to get Tony to clam up entirely.
Steve looked close to tears, he was crouched down, next to Tony, one hand on the suit, next to the unlit arc reactor, the other resting on his own thigh. Underneath the mosaic it read:
If anyone could make him come without touching himself, it was Steve. Perfect Steve. His Steve. His sweet friend, who may never be anything but, someone to love from afar, someone to cook dinner with, watch Gilmore Girls with and not be ashamed with, someone who...
"Man after my own heart," he spoke loud enough to get a rise out of Steve. Bruce chuckled, recognizing the ploy, and watching the door frame with Tony. As expected (because he was so,
"Preaching to the choir!" Clint smiled. He appraised Tony for a moment, looking him over. Tony glared at him, quite sure where this was headed.
"Crap, I'm sorry, Tony." The steps he takes back to the living room are slow and steady, and by the time he's reached the couch, Tony is fast asleep in his arms. He's afraid to wake him. With a sheepish smile toward the only other occupant in the room - Clint - he sits and lays back on the arm of the couch, cradling Tony against his chest. Clint shoots Steve a knowing look and goes back to whatever he is doing on his tablet. Blushing, Steve pulls the comforter over both of them.
"Yes. We have. We were getting fed up with your obliviousness, Ant-Tony. You both deserve the utmost happiness," Thor stated, pushing the yogurt cup away from him. "But I wish you to hear this now. You are a commendable warrior: stalwart, brave. You are prepared to sacrifice yourself for the greater good, and that is not just in battle. I do not think I have ever met a man more kind and deserving of true love. You
When they parted, it was with a great reluctance. Tony shivered from the cold and Steve stood in response, pulling Tony up with him. He bent down to grab his laptop. "Where's your new hoodie?" Steve remarked with a bit of cheek.
Vision clearing, he turned toward Bruce and locked his eyes with his, letting Bruce know that he was back, but he was broken.
Steve added a quick swirl of half and half to one of the cups, left one black, and added a heaping of French vanilla creamer to a third. After so many years together, he knew exactly how they each took their coffee.
at what we do as Avengers. The perfect cannot objectively defend. But that doesn't mean we don't deserve the ability to fill in some of those cracks."
"You say that like it's a bad thing!" He grinned, stepping around the pillar and walking towards the exit. She fell in pace next to him. "I like the one on 34th better."
"No! Nothing like that." His hands went back to his hair, and Howard realized that it was a tic of his, something he did when he was feeling insecure and nervous. It was something Howard tended to do as well, something he had managed to pass down, despite being a bastard.
"I'm all wide awake now, who's fault is that?" Tony groaned, rolling over and exposing his gorgeous backside. Steve was tempted, oh, was he ever, to just crawl back into bed and worship Tony until the sun came up and cows came home.
Clint's steady voice sounded from his position by the fridge. "Bruce is working on a way to make sure you forget all of this when you go back."
," he said softly, ruffling the boy's hair and standing. "I hope you have a great rest of your day."
"-Pinky fingers, we know." Bruce finished for her, "and we appreciate you saying that, believe me. We've worked really hard to sound like we do, our voices fit seamlessly together. But that's
"Everyone thinks you're such a good soldier boy, just like Steve." Tucking his legs underneath him, Tony flipped through the menu, laying it on his thigh when he reached the espresso page. "I know better. I have seen both of your 'O' faces."
Aware that Thor had not been around and couldn't possibly know, she explained, "I went a bit off the walls pushing Tony and Howard together. I didn't stop to think about what Tony wanted, and neither did Steve. He did everything to keep them apart."
In the morning, Tony slipped into the shower with Steve, running his hands up his chest and kissing the tension he felt there. He let Steve take him against the wall, fast and passionate, Steve's teeth leaving marks on his shoulder. He shook with his climax, knees growing weak, and allowed Steve to carry him back to bed. There, they stayed until the afternoon, teasing and edging each other until they tumbled away into the first fully restful sleep they had in days.
Steve blinked and looked at Howard, a slight flush creeping up his neck at being caught with his mind wandering. "Howard?"
It was evident as soon as Hill had sat down with them that Fury was pissed that they’d kept Howard's arrival secret. Him learning that the magic used meant that Howard was going to be in the future indefinitely?
"I know the basics, sorry, but I appreciate you telling me. I have learned some things." The mirth in his voice set Bruce at ease that he didn't offend him. "My question is why?"
He sees the smiling face of Petra, cradling him on the swing on the back porch of the Stark Mansion in Glen Cove.
Steve caught Tony looking and grinned mischievously. "I made sure you were the last appointment today." Flipping open a book on the counter, he signed himself out. "I've been planning this for a long time."
"Partially, yes." He looks nervous and guilty. It sets Tony on edge. "But also…" He pauses, shifting from foot to foot, and Tony is aware that although he may not have known him all that long yet, Phil Coulson doesn't fidget.
Howard was on the couch where she’d left him, still fussing with the Starkpad. She settled against the grate to watch; he didn't seem dangerous. But as the saying went, looks could be deceiving.
here without the pulsing energy that was Anthony Stark. Steve sat at his window, sketchbook forgotten in his hands as he stared out over the expanse of the Manhattan skyline.
Steve nodded his thanks, picking up another plate for his salad. "Okay, that's good. I was enjoying it. I can see why it's a favorite of yours."
"Jesus, Rogers! It's about time!" Natasha snapped, pushing a sleeping Clint from her shoulder, "Bruce said you'd be right up!"
When their food came, they ate in companionable silence for a few minutes, before Natasha took up the previous conversation. "No one has the right to touch you without your consent, Tony, even if it's a nonverbal one. You don't have to explicitly say yes to someone putting their hand on your arm, but some jackass grabbing your bubble butt? No, they don't get to do that unless you expressly say they can."
"Steve…" Tony's voice was quiet as a prayer and his brown eyes fluttered closed, his lashes like a whisper on his cheeks.
Steve winced. "Sorry, I'll try harder." He paused, thinking. "Maybe we should stay in my room until he goes back? It might be less, I don't know, in his face that we're together?"
Rhodey respected Bruce. Not just as a scientist or as an Avenger, but as Tony's other best friend. He held no misgivings for Tony taking on another one, it actually helped to ease Rhodey's mind a little. He was so often out of the country or otherwise engaged that he wasn't always able to talk Tony down or be there physically for him. Bruce had stepped up to that plate.
In the guest room, he made quick work of the bed, and rustling through the dresser produced a pair of sweatpants and a shirt that looked like they'd fit Howard. It was all a hodgepodge of left behind clothes from SHIELD agents who had spent the night in the past. He was thankful for whatever he could find, the stuffy suit Howard wore wouldn't be comfortable to sleep in.
The sound of an electric whir interrupted whatever Clint was going to say. He turned and stood up, stepping back to join Natasha as she climbed to her own feet, and watched as Rhodey flew in.
She had been filled in, albeit in drips and drabs, but she knew the Avengers were working on having his memories erased. Which she understood. Of course. On a logical level it made perfect sense to send a time traveler back with no recollection of what had happened, but on an emotional one, not so much. This was Tony's chance to have a good childhood. To have a supportive and loving father. Who knew what positives could come from this?
"That picture in the living room? With the six of us, you remember it?" He nodded to her and she continued, "The green thing in the back is the Hulk. And the Hulk is what Bruce turns into when he's pissed."
Chest feeling heavy, Tony turned to the shower and tried to step toward it, but his body felt like an immovable boulder. The thought of showering exhausted him. He couldn't do it. He just couldn't.
One of him flying, a blast of light shooting from his hands, one of he and Steve, reflecting the repulsers off of the shield, him and Clint, as he gave him a ride up to a building...pictures he never remembered posing for, the photographer in danger every step of the way but determined to capture the battle. Unobtrusive to the point that until Tony caught the man's reflection in a not yet shattered window in a photo of the Hulk, he never would have known exactly what he looked like.
He watched Tony and Rhodey, after months apart, pick up like they had never left the other's company. Their inside jokes and stories that meant everything to them and nothing to anybody else, how Tony could make one face and have Rhodey in stitches, or how Rhodey -- knowing when Tony needed it -- could open his arms and, with no explanation needed, wrap Tony up. He often teased them for their 'slumber parties' -- nights they would stay up until dawn watching bad 80's horror or action movies, melded together on the bed amongst candy wrappers, takeout, and discarded popcorn, giggling like twelve year olds.
"Oh fuck." Steve breathed in awe. Tony's hole was still opened from his earlier fun. "Not much for me to do, huh?"
"Steve is, well." She paused, tilting her head so her red hair fell onto her shoulder. "He's overprotective. Especially of Tony. And let's face it," she pressed on before Clint could answer, "someone needs to be."
Raising her eyebrows at the greeting but still smiling, Natasha took his hand as well. Tony was a handful. Always had been. Rehab twice for alcohol addiction, one stemming from a DUI, two arrests for bar fights, and a whole charade of bad publicity relationships. But she also knew he came from a broken and abusive home, and there were those rumors about Obie Stane…  Regardless, he had boasted recently about being over ten years sober and hadn't had an incident in almost as long. Could be worse. Another lead in the group, with a voice she had heard compared to that of an angel with a smoking problem. He was smooth and raspy in places, and in others his voice rang out like church bells. He was single, but probably had some kids out there. Maybe. Most likely. If it looks like a slut and acts like a slut…
Unsure of what to say, Natasha took a long sip of her drink to buy a few precious seconds, her face darkened with confusion. "Of course it's a good idea. No one said it was going to be easy."
"He's affable enough," she quipped, lining up three clean glasses, "it's Pepper and Rhodey he has to worry about." She smiled widely at Howard at that, "Scotch or bourbon?"
. I gots loyalty. They don't fear me; they respect me. All I ask is for places to conduct business in exchange for protecting them, I don't take their fucking money. All this," he gestured to the safe, "is because of the booze. I'm a fucking business man. I'm goddamn intelligent. Smarter than all you fuckers, I changed the game. I figured out how to make it better, how to store it better, how to transport it better. Other
"Pep, that's just setting me up for failure, you know that," he shot back, laughing softly. "I'll see you then."
"Well, you had to be strong." Avery said, no hint of sarcasm or over excitement. He said it like a fact. And it was. "How have you been fairing since all this started?"
He told them everything. From the first fight with Rhodey there and how he kept speaking for Tony and deciding for him, to how Tony was adamant they tell Howard about their relationship, to him seeing Tony's shaking figure silhouetted by the light from the guest room, to taking Tony to Malibu. Somehow it all came out. Most of it was not necessary because Bruce had known a sizable portion, but it was filling in things for Thor, and by to some extent, Howard. He told them of his anger, of how he was still angry, and how Tony descended into a mental slump that was frightening to him.
"Well then. Back to the fun." Tony walked around the table, grabbed the lube from his desk, and flopped onto the couch. "Decision made!" He yelled, throwing his hands in the air in self victory. Dum-E whirred exasperatingly, and wheeled away, apparently not interested in seeing his daddy get his rocks off.
"Again, it's up to the individual. Some work two or three generations of charges and then retire. Usually around 200 years, but most stay for more than that. I think the mean age is somewhere about 700, but there are plenty of old-timers who stick with it well into the thousands." Coulson sits up and reaches for the texts. "You'll find most of that in these," he taps the books, "particularly
Did they find a way to alter his memory? Or did something go horribly wrong? Or was Tony going to wake up the next day with a boatload of new memories?
"I know the whole erase the memory thing, but, Steve, I promise, I'm going to do everything in my power to change it." He had taken a step back, putting distance between himself and the one person that three days ago he swore he could trust with his life.
He smashes the parsnip into the middle of the face, almost upsetting some of the black bean smile Steve has worked so diligently on. But it stays put, which was Tony's motive for plowing it into its face so hard. Steve winces when it makes contact, but when all's well that ends well, he looks impressed.
"See if you can't get him up and in bed," Bruce spoke, looking into the living room and studying the form on the couch and frowning.
"Eighteen months," he repeated. "All the info is in here," he said, tapping the file again. "Start with tour dates, they have an album set to come out in January. Focus on promotion, on setting up a public image of an old group with a fresh sound. Go into your first meeting
what you guys have been through, but I know my job. And if I can get Ty Stone-" Tony made a disgusted face at the name, "-back on the charts, I think I can get you guys there too."
He didn't have to say it twice. Steve removed his fingers and used the Vaseline again to lube up his dick. Bracing himself with one hand on the lounger by Tony's head, and using the other to line his cock up, he leaned down, and kissed Tony breathless. "Ya ready, sweetheart?"
"Steve, listen, I need to finish this." Tony spoke hurriedly, already turned back toward the gauntlet, his fingers digging into the glove. "If something happens to my GPS, it could get jammed, and we’re down to my gyroscope! Then what do we do? Nat could get hurt, Clint or...or you, and we wouldn’t know which way to go to get to safety! I can't let that happen." He shoved the gauntlet aside and pulled the helmet forward. "We can only get within a quarter mile of a destination with the gyroscope, and I can’t even calculate how to get back to center with it if we’re off that far! We won’t be able to find anything smaller than an airport!” He lifted his head, just for a second, showing Steve wide, exhausted eyes before dropping them back to the helmet. "I'll install a failsafe, of course, but by allowing for a system shut down in the case of a monster that's..." He looked up again, and Steve saw a glint of fear in his dark eyes. "You know, electrical? Like a bad Thor? And the use of a gyroscope… I mean it's archaic, but we need to be prepared. If something happens to my suit, then at least we have options, right?" He didn't wait for an answer. "What's this?" He lifted a bolt from behind the face mask, shrugged, and tossed it over his shoulder. "Useless, don't need it."
"It's a risk I would be willing to take." Before he could answer, she continued, "But not one the Avengers will. They have final say."
But there were good moments as well, and they were beginning to outweigh all of the bad. Howard learning about new technology and loving it.  He and Tony making messes of their workshops as they went on inventing binges. The first time Howard went out in public and the response was surprisingly positive.
"All you." And they were kissing again, and Tony could swear if he had nothing else in his life but the ability to keep doing this, he'd be the happiest man in the world.
She shook her head, "Stevie, don't go getting mixed up with the wrong crowd. My life ain't worth it."
Briefly, he toyed with the idea of changing the sheets, but honestly, he didn't want to get his hopes up and if they
? It worked out in everyone's favor. Ever since the Battle of New York, Hulk had saved Tony countless times. Most of the time, he was the only one capable. And Hulk wasn't exactly a
Roses and daffodils. Maybe a sunflower. He fingered the petals on the bright flower, nodding to himself and gathering the bouquets. Yes. He'd buy the sunflowers for the common areas. Everyone could do with a little cheering up.
Chuckling, Rhodey pulled the suit up, preparing to land. "I knew I needed something quirky to get you out of the tower. I just did my research." Tony pulled up beside him, appreciating the lengths Rhodey always went to in order to help Tony. "No one can fly these other than us. Let's just take that empty spot in front of the building on the road. Two suits, one spot, and no, I'm not interested in whatever perverted pun you're about to say."
Tony had decided, after a long talk with himself, that no matter what Steve said, the hoodie was now the property of one Anthony Edward Stark. It was comfy. It was warm. It was finders' keepers.
"Sorry," a cute little brunette woman interrupted them, "I couldn't help but overhear. Your friend, what's his allergy? Maybe I can help."
Tony sleeps for two hours. It's not as long as he needs, but it's a step in the right direction. His hand fists into Steve's shirt, opening and closing in movements that are considerably more relaxed than they had been.
Steve leaned over and gently kissed his head. It had taken six months of dating Tony to break through his walls enough to understand why he hated his father, and another six to come to terms that the man he had known had vanished sometime before Tony was born and after Steve had gone. Reconciling between the two had taken another three months, but Steve had a pretty firm grasp on it at that point. He had been with Tony for nineteen months. He knew first hand the damage Howard had caused, but he also knew just how resilient Tony was. Howard had done good things in his life, nothing could take that away from him, but he also had caused a lot of harm. Steve was surprised at the hatred he felt now when he thought of his old friend. It only increased the love he felt for Tony, to have withstood the abuse and all the trauma he had endured in his life and still come out a good and kind person… Thinking about it made Steve fall in love with him over and over again.
With a soft smile, Steve stood and pulled Tony into his arms, kissing him sweetly. "You okay with him being there, angel?"
With that in mind, Steve carefully untangled himself from Tony, and it was a testament to Tony's exhaustion that he barely stirred at all. He made quick work of packing a bag for Tony and managed to sneak down the hallway to gather things for himself. It was selfish, but his plan was to take the Quinjet. They'd stay long enough for Tony to get his head on straight and return. Howard couldn't keep them from their home. With any luck, Natasha, Clint, or even Bruce - and he was almost hoping for the Hulk to break out and show just how protective
He was so small. Just a child, really, fifteen and skinny, shorter than almost everyone else on campus because he was
Natasha was busy on her own phone, so Tony called Pepper. It felt a little wrong to tell her first instead of his boyfriend, but it wasn't like Steve was picking up.
Nodding but not really listening at this point, he's got brand new knowledge in his hands; Tony flips through the books.
It was the same as he had said before. But it never got them anywhere. Tony still refused to see a doctor. Natasha was right; this was getting out of hand.
He waited until they were just a few minutes outside Manhattan before he said anything. Steve sat next to him in the cockpit, sketching idly while Tony navigated the quinjet. Occasionally, he would look up and smile, hiding what he was drawing. Tony hated to crush him, but it had to be done.
He was taken aback by that, she could tell. His body recoiled slightly, his face twisting. "That sounds like a threat."
"Wish I could. She needs backup, but you know the Other Guy; it wouldn't end well, and hey! You can tell her that Howard is Tony's father!" Bruce was trying for levity; he knew exactly what he was asking of Steve. Dealing with your boyfriend's drunk father was bad enough even without the added benefit of knowing he was essentially the root of all the emotional issues he had.
Tony came with a shout, a long yell of release that had Steve partially hoping it could be heard in the living room.
). Cuddled together for warmth in the dead of winter, talking in hushed voices of their dreams, how they were going to get out of the tenement apartment they lived in and make something of themselves. How Bucky always knew when Steve was in trouble. How Steve always knew when Bucky needed a little extra support. How they complimented each other, like two colors opposite on the color wheel.
"I know the circumstances are wild, I know at the end of everything that's happened in your life and his, that you're both just ordinary men. We all are. And it's never going to be simple." Gently, Rhodey put his hand on Tony's forearm, aware that the truce between them all was tentative at best at the moment. "Believe me, Tones, I wish, fuck, I know
"-Miss Romanoff," that was Bruce, "no offence, but we stopped caring about relevancy about fifteen years ago."
Clint shrugged, "Seems like it. She got Ty back on the radio, I wondered how that happened." Tony gave a shudder. "Shit. Sorry, didn't mean to say the devil's name."
Steve let his tongue trace along the seam of Tony's mouth before pushing past his teeth and gliding against Tony's tongue. Beneath him, Tony groaned, opening to the onslaught of Steve's mouth, his body shivering as Steve sucked on the muscle. Between them, their cocks throbbed, straining against Tony's jeans and Steve's professional, pleated dress pants.
Steve was just approaching the revolving doors to the tower when he saw Bruce walking up, "Breakfast?" he asked, a guilty smile on his face.
"Hey, hey! It's okay, listen to me." Pressing his lips to Tony's head quickly, Steve tightened his hold and spoke softly. "Bruce is going to figure out how to erase his memory of this, SHIELD didn't even question it, because he's the best at this stuff, Tony, you know that. And Nat and Clint are working on finding that spellbook."
He felt Steve's motions become stilted as he neared his release, felt one of Steve's hands slink in between them to fold around Tony's length, pumping fast to bring Tony over the edge with him. "Steve!" Tony couldn't help but call out as he spilled over Steve's hand, the build up and the emotions too intense to prolong. Steve's body stilled as he came, and Tony revelled in the feeling of being filled up by him.
Natasha was grinning, but her eyes were dark. She held onto Steve's arm as he tried to escape, managing to hold him for a few seconds before he broke free and bolted. She threw her head back and laughed.
Thor raised his eyebrows, glancing over toward the fearful figure at the doors. "And how is it that you have come to know this?"
"I think he's actually tearing up." She bent over and looked up into Clint's face; he was doubled over clutching his stomach.
"What? No!" Tony looked offended on Steve's behalf. "You're not even close to dumb, first of all." His sass was starting to come out, which was a very good thing.
. He had sworn he would attain what was rightfully his, and he did. Along with the crown of fear that came with it. It was satisfying.
Tony without his glasses meant that Steve could see the deep brown of his eyes unhindered, but it also meant that those eyes were unfocused, unable to see the adoration Steve had for how beautiful they were.
She had been able to weasel a bit more information out of Howard before he tipped over from buzzed into sloppy and had sent it all through the Tower's secure email server to Steve and Bruce (with a CC to Barton who, despite technically being there to hear first hand, was unlikely to remember).
It felt like that one time Tony dumped a cup of ice water down his back. The chill shook him, and he had to swallow before speaking. "How did that go?"
Thor's eyebrows raised, "He is out. But I believe he will return shortly. Have you finally figured it out?"
"Hurry!" That was Thor's voice. The dark sky lit up as he gathered lightning, ready to attack should Natasha and Clint be unable to fire.
"Oh, a challenge! I like that in a woman." When she didn't even crack a smile, he continued on, nonplussed, "So, why does it seem like everyone hates me here? Seems impossible. I'm a pretty great guy."
Draping his body over Tony's, Steve kissed every available piece of skin he could reach, his hips rocking hard and fast into him, drinking up every moan he pulled from Tony's throat.
Natasha was a people watcher. Unashamedly. She could spend hours sitting on a bench in Central Park or taking up the corner both at a cafe. Sitting against the pillars between the entrances to track 17 and tracks 18 and 19 at Penn Station was a favorite of hers. She could sit, almost invisible, eating a slice from Rose's Pasta and Pizzeria and sipping on a beer in a brown paper bag, and just watch. During the week, it was all commuters from Long Island, standing in front of the electronic board and waiting for their track to be announced before herding down the steps in a fight to grab a seat and bitching about changing in Jamaica. On the weekends, it was the drunk crowd. Girls and guys, dressed in their partying best, high heels clicking against the floors and screams and shouts of drunken fun. Boyfriends carrying their inebriated girlfriends, arranging for taxis and Ubers to pick them up at their stations, and making plans to meet for brunch the next day.
In the moments between him trying to stand up and hitting the ground unconscious, his fingers twitch over the ghost of the blanket, muscle memory from years of seeking comfort.
Of course it probably would have gone better had Tony not been still holding him in a vice grip, but the point was made.
Biting his lip, Steve turned his hand so his fingers could cup Tony's balls through his jeans. "Is that a yes, Mr. Stark?"
"And he loves me." He lifted his chin, excluding pride, even if he was afraid. Howard realized with a jolt
, he wants to rip it off. The movements jostle the catheter and send flares of pain through his hand.
A voice towards the middle called out, "Gluten free Iron Man!" sending the whole place into wild laughter.
Snickering softly, Steve pushed Tony onto his back and slid on top of him, nestling between his legs and hooking his arms under Tony's. "Do you accept apologies in blanket form?"
5. Interlude: This May Have Been Written by Steven Rogers. Or Was it Clinton Barton. Who Even Knows Anymore?
"He'll come around," Tony said softly, and followed Steve down the hallway, leaving Howard alone in the living room.
--she had grown up listening to. Once, she may have been able to distinguish each separate voice from the other, but years after she left her teenybopper phase, they just sounded like strangers.
Steve guffawed, his face splitting into an enormous grin. "As if you ever get anything less than from me!"
He tries so hard not to, but Tony's eyes flicker away from the window and up to view Steve. He looks so lost. The dull blue and grey of Manhattan's light flickers against his skin, interspersed with shadows from the window panes. He looks like a ghost, something unreal and haunting. Tony's chest seizes.
Steve brought his knees up to cradle around Tony's bottom, tugging the smaller man up on them without ceasing his movements. Around his cock, Tony's rim stretched, Steve widening it as he thrust in and out, the angles sometimes elongating the muscle. It was mesmerizing the way he fit into Tony's body, the slick of leftover lube and precome gathering around the edges, a milky white that left streaks on Steve's cock whenever he pulled out. His hole, rose tinted and greedy, taking him back in eagerly.
Steve's eyes darkened. "I've got work to do." With a meaningful glance at Tony, he turned on his heels and left.
Tony's cock lay forgotten against his abdomen, the story had held just enough truth to make him ache a little, and he couldn't stop reading if he tried.
She studied his face, scrunching her own. "No, you're not. But you will be." She nodded once, satisfied with what she was seeing, and Clint couldn't help but scoot back just a little. He would never admit it out loud, but sometimes Pepper scared him more than Natasha. "I had a talk with Howard, and I will back whatever play
"Let me be the first to congratulate you." Clint smirked, sliding towards him like a child, skating with the slippers.
"'Ey, Bright Eyes, you gonna have some?" It was his right hand, James "Colonel" Rhodes, a handsome black man that Tony had to fight tooth and nail to get into the family business. Many of his
Howard's head tilted to the side, a small amount of confusion growing on his face. "I thought you said you were okay now?"
Tony moaned, "The cursing is really sexy. Never thought I'd say that. Can't believe Captain America is a potty mouth."
Tony had no idea how he was still standing when all of the blood in his body was in his face. Steve could sense he was uncomfortable.
As soon as Pepper had led Clint from the room, Tony had stretched out on the couch, taking up her warm spot.
"Howard," he called, "I have something for you to wear to bed." When no answer came, he popped his head out of the room, fully expecting to find Howard sleeping at the island.
"I'm sorry, Howard. It's been a long day. Just…" Tony was at a loss. There was no quip ready, no joke or retort sitting at the forefront of his mind. He dropped his hand, nodded once, and left the room.
"Tough. You think I'm letting you go anytime soon? You’ve got another thing coming." Pointedly, he tucks the blanket snuggly around Tony and himself. "Better get used to me all up in your business."
Snickering, Natasha made her way back into the center of the living room, "I'll text Steve to see if he and Tony will be joining us."
The only response he got was from Natasha. It was a picture of the three of them crammed into Bruce's lab, all flipping off a hologram of Howard.
Steve's body went rigid, "Tell me you know how to get back." When Howard didn't answer right away, Steve let a burst of air blow through his lips in exasperation, "You don't, do you?"
"Okay, uh -- That is a U! All right, hold on," shifting in the chair to get more comfortable, Tony blinked, and started again. "D-O-Y-O-U...W...A? Yes, A. N...T… M-Y?" Pausing he sat back and rubbed his eyes. "My prescription is shot, Doc."
"-I know that!" He scoffed, tossing the helmet back onto the work bench, "But I also know - in case you missed the memo, I
"I want to spill myself on him." It didn't sound like a request, though Thor had worded it as one. But Steve found himself hard pressed to deny it.
In the early hours of the morning, when Steve woke, feeling rejuvenated like he hadn't in so long, he silently crept into the living room and into the elevator to retrieve his laptop where he had left it.
"He's feeling better!" Steve celebrated, adding the eggs to the mixture in the bowl -- which it also still had the price tag on it.
The bottle of scotch looked safe enough and Howard poured himself two fingers worth. "You didn't age."
"Now, why would you think that? We did nothing illegal!" He had to smack Clint's arm when the archer burst out into a fit of giggles.
Tony tightened around him, urging him to move. "I love you," he breathed into Tony's ear, drawing his body back just a little and rocking forward, the blanket shifting on the back of his body. "I love you so much."
his old life, it also isn't. "Consultant, you say?" he responds meekly as Coulson moves the toolbox and picks up the blueprints.
As he watched through the glass windows looking out onto the landing pad from his seat on the couch, Rhodey put his arm around Tony's shoulders and laughed, giving his best friend a shake and drawing a wide smile from him. The new suits that Steve had watched Tony build stood tall and silent like golems behind them as they walked the path to the door. Tony looked happier -- and Steve supposed he should be glad, if he wasn't so jealous that it wasn't him making Tony look like that. It was Rhodey. Tony's best friend. The center of the puzzle that made everything else make sense. He was Tony's guide, the impetus that set him into motion to become the man he would be. Without Rhodey, Afghanistan could have ended differently. The situation with Stane so much worse. The abusive influence of Howard unchallenged.
Tony is not entirely sure what's going on. She's beautiful; he knows that, but under the gorgeous skin and wavy red hair is a killer. And that's...well, that's frightening. He'd like to go back to Clint now, thanks.
If Steve hadn't seen it with his own eyes, he never would have believed it, but Howard - who was dwarfed by the man by at least a foot and a half - lunged and grabbed the man by the middle, tackling him to the ground. The crossbow went off, the arrow flinging up and embedding itself in the side of a building.
"I don't know, Tony. You don't have to decide tonight." Letting his head rest on the top of Tony's, he swayed them back and forth gently. It was one of those things Steve did. Like a habit. It was a small, physical solace, something his mother had done for him. Tony had learned of it early on in their relationship, and though he always had a low tolerance for all that touchy feely garbage, Steve used that one little motion to break through to Tony.
Lunging up to take Steve's lips, Tony forced his body further down onto Steve's cock, moaning into his mouth. "No, so I guess that means I'm in your debt, Doctor. How will I ever repay you?"
"Sure, Tony. Smoothie and shower first? I'll join you." A brief flash of hope danced across Steve's handsome features.
He blanched at that. They were so caught up in their own discussions they hadn't realized just what they were revealing. "Ah, no."
"How did you figure it out?" Clint asked, plucking the yellow pad from Hill's hands. Changing the subject was an art form for him. She didn't need to know that the mess included Steve as well.
Once again, those dark thoughts had to go. So, Tony mentally shut the drawer he kept them in and locked it.
"We can work with that. Talk to Steve. He knows what you're feeling. He crashed a plane and woke up seventy years later."
All of this was what made the whole Howard situation precarious. Hulk didn't like him by default, and him being with them
"You better." Steve's hand snaked around Tony's body, and the only tell to what he was doing was Tony's breathy gasp and the slow widening of knees.
Tony threw his head back and howled, delighted at the crassness he was able to exchange with his father. It felt so
Tony shrugged, "Don't know." Turning back to the table, he continued to set it while Steve drained the potatoes in a strainer in the sink.
"A possibility, but we have no way to contact him. We have to wait until he gets back on earth." Steve shifted, the weight of the problem at hand making him uncomfortable. "Nat said that Howard stole some book of spells. But he doesn't know how to get back, which tells me that the book might be useless if we even find it."
"It is. Your wings can fold up inside your shell; it's like a magical space. Ever read Harry Potter?"
Tony looked stricken. With eyes wide and pleading, the soulful brown shining with anxiety. At this point in time, they were near the same age, but like this, Tony looked so much younger than he actually was. Howard found himself wondering what Tony was like in his twenties. If what he read on the internet was real - and he was sure it was - he was never going to find out. Not in this life, and certainly not in the one he was going back to. He'd be dead by then.
Over the course of several months, Tony had gone from teammate to friend to confidant to the best friend he’d ever had next to Bucky.
Sitting up and tucking his knees under himself, Steve dug his fingers into the waistband of the pajama bottoms Tony wore, "Nope. She can wait." And he pulled the bottoms off in one fluid movement.
"Nats, come on. I was lucky." He moved his water glass away from him, just in case. "I just want to share the luck."
Twenty-six pounds and four months later, Tony found himself at an upscale hotel in Boston, the other Avengers standing around him in solid support. No one knew why Tony Stark had a sudden interest in donating to the National Celiac Association when it was announced or why he was set to be the keynote speaker at the conference that began that afternoon.
"Yes, really," Tony smiles, stepping closer, "if you're sweet enough to Pepper, she may embarrass me by showing you the pictures from my fifth birthday." Leaning toward Steve, Tony whispers conspiratorially, hoping to make Steve laugh, "Full-on Captain America themed. Complete with streamers, a shield cake, and me in a full, custom Captain America costume. I was the talk of my kindergarten class."
Tony's body heaved, his back arching and his head coming up, "Right there! Oh God, right there!" He let his shoulder hit the ground, reaching up to try and tug at his own cock.
"My facade is working for a government agency known as SHIELD, The Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement, and Logistics Division. Two of my charges are agents there, though I've been watching over them for their whole lives."
Sitting up, Steve pulled Tony into his arms, kissing him deeply. "Now, about dinner," he asked, kissing the tip of Tony's nose, "would you like to accompany me? I
Steve laughed and kissed Tony's head. "Not that I don't want to be inside you," he let his own hands slide down Tony's back, "making you scream," his fingers dipped under the waistband of his boxers, "but I really need to pee."
Steve placed the tray on the dresser and crawled onto the bed, sliding his legs under the blankets and pulling Tony close. "JARVIS, get the blinds?"
"Tony," Steve's quiet voice breaks through the fear. A small light he can walk towards, something to guide him back. "Tony, please. I love you."
"Oh, shoot!" Whipping around, Steve grabbed the pot holders and lifted them from the heat to place onto an unused burner. "Are you going to be okay?" he asked, retrieving the strainer from the cupboard and placing it in the sink.
Bumping his chin on Tony's head some time later, Rhodey pointed to the bathroom. "Go shower and then let's go flying. You need to
Steve felt his heart drop. Tony had every right to be mad. They were bickering and yelling like he wasn't there. They couldn't have screwed up any worse if Howard had actually been in the room.
Chuckling, Steve pulled out, eliciting a moan from the man underneath him, "Let me clean you up, and then I have to go save our sweet assassin."
"Right away, Captain Rogers." Steve was just headed to the door when the AI spoke again, "Sir says he'll be right up."
He watched as Clint rolled to the side, hitting the cushions with zero grace, "If that's how you treat your friends…"
"No, Jimmy," he said, using his hand to bat away the offered drink. "You never dip into your own supply."
Howard knew -- at that moment -- that he was the biggest idiot in the world. But through the rushing in his ears and his wildly breathing heart, his brain worked. There had to be a way to salvage this somehow. A way to go back and stop him from ever casting that spell.
"I'll have the nurse bring some in," she says, marking in his chart. "You were knocked out of the sky, fell a long way. But aside from a few broken bones and superficial scratches, you're going to be okay." Pausing in her notes, she looks at him over the clipboard. "That is one heck of a suit, Mister Stark. It saved your life. You should be proud."
This was him introducing the movie to Steve, who was intently watching and laughing along. But Tony couldn't concentrate. His thoughts kept slipping back to his father. Other than letting him into the suite to shower and handing him a change of clothes, he hadn't spoken to the man. Hadn't even attempted to breach the conversation they had that morning, though it hung between them like heavy rope, frayed and rough.
It scared Steve a little when he realized how easily Tony could have been taken advantage of. In that respect, at least, his media persona worked. No one tried to get close to him.
was Howard Stark. Even dressed in jeans she remembered were Tony's (she was pretty sure she picked them out for him) and a faded Yankees jersey she was positive came from Tony's closet, he still had a
Steve laughs, though it's hollow and weary, looking back down at the bottle, "No, I didn't." He sighs, blinking tiredly. "You'd think with how many missions we've had, and how there's been next to no days off, that I'd be sleeping like the dead."
Steve laid another smack on Tony's rear, the crack echoing throughout the room. "Why? We have things to discuss."
Each one had a picture of Tony, pale and sickly, some with additions from the team. Steve guilding an exhausted Tony back into the tower. Natasha looking worried as he stumbled through a hotel entrance. Bruce with his hand on Tony's shoulder in the Audi, his face full of concern.
Hill waved her hand, dismissing Clint's bad joke like she had so many others. "How's he taking having his father here? I'm not partial to the details, but I know enough from interacting with Stark to know a bad childhood when I see one."
"Huh." Tony said. He remembered seeing a few people on the streets that day, most were trying to find safe spaces to hide, but if he really concentrated, he could recall one man with curly blond hair, and an expensive camera. Funny how the memory was there all along but he never thought about it.
I truly hope this story has brought as much joy to you as it has to me! See you next week with the epilogue!
But Happy being there meant the paparazzi knew that it was likely going to be Tony coming out of the revolving doors to the tower, and they were in a frenzy.
Howard swallowed and looked down. "You're right." Steve hadn't been expecting to be agreed with. He stumbled back - all the confidence vanishing - letting his legs hit the couch, and sat, staring at Howard as he continued speaking. "But there's nothing we can do about that now. I'm here. Even if I disappeared this very second, you can't change that I came. And I'm sorry for that."
They received a rather fierce glare in response, but it softened just as quickly. "Did he at least have fun?"
"Not a problem, I get you another." His soft voice and accent were soothing, and as he left to retrieve another glass, Tony pulled his wallet out to pluck a few large bills. When the bus boy returned, he surreptitiously slid them into his apron; a nice surprise for the young man to find later. "Your waiter be here soon," he was saying, setting the new cup down, completely oblivious that he was now a few hundred dollars richer, "ah, yes, here. This is Angelo." And he hurried away as a Jersey Shore looking Guido approached, but Tony knew better than to judge, as the MTV series didn't show the culture as it really was: smart, capable people with a stubborn streak. Tony had felt the same misconception as a teenager and in his twenties, no matter how many years had past since the mass migration from the early twentieth century, people still looked at Italians as imbeciles.
Tony doesn't speak again until Natasha comes to pick up Steve the next day. And even then, it's only a soft, "I'm sorry," as Nat helps move him to the wheelchair.
She deflated. "I know. And I trust you all enough to understand that you would never hurt him on purpose." She took his hand, a sense of urgency in her grasp. "Agent Barton, he's been through so much already. And he's always come out of it, but that can't happen every time. I
"This isn't just another cause for me to throw money at. I know a lot of you like to think that's all I do, and," he gestured to the attendees, "I don't mean any of you." The cameramen and the reporters shifted uneasily, the jab at them hitting their last shred of humanity. "This
He sighed, dramatically enough to have Jarvis answering with a quiet, "Sir?" before looking back up at the screen.
"Anytime!" Bruce's voice called back as he disappeared into his own room. Rhodey chuckled as he pushed open the door.
"It is!" Tony pulled back, stepping away from Steve like he felt he didn't deserve comfort or human contact. It was just one more thing for Steve to hate Howard for. "This is all my fault! I started this mess the second I fled from the room when Howard appeared!"
"This," Tony began, choking back tears, and that was really annoying, was he seriously about to cry again? He swallowed, bringing himself back under some sort of semblance of control. "This is incredible."
Natasha saw the fight that was about to happen and tried to intervene. "He's fine! Doc looked it over, just a graze, really, Tony."
"Ya really think the world is gonna miss someone like Paulie Two Fingers?" He remarked, his voice low and dangerous. He invaded Steve's personal space, and something crackled between them. "Ask me why I had that bastard put to pasture." Tony smelled like cigarettes and hair oil, baby powder used after his baths, and something sweet. Candy, maybe, sugary and tantalizing. It made Steve's cock twitch.
Swallowing past the lump in his own throat, Steve pulled the blanket tighter around Tony. "What are we going to do?"
"Oh, oh, fuck. Steve, oh god, Steve!" He rambled, letting go of his cock and cupping his balls, rolling them to elongate the pleasure. He dropped his feet, letting the heels dig into the mattress, and let out of guttural moan, shaking with the intensity of his orgasm.
It was almost torture, but Steve waited until they were in the hallway to wrap an arm around Tony's waist possessivly. If Tony noticed the edge of his tension, he didn't say anything. Nor did he comment when Steve lay down on the couch in Tony's living room and pulled him so he was laying on top, his legs on either side of Steve's and his head tucked under his chin.
He didn't know exactly when it was that he first got sick, but he did know the exact moment when he began to feel better.
for getting himself into trouble." He eyed Tony's face, so deeply asleep he had no idea of the conversation around him. He just looked so
"And miss how perky you are after you downed an entire bottle of wine all by your onesies? Absolutely not."
The door opened again, this time revealing Barton, Thor, and finally Bruce. They entered talking amongst themselves, arguing, it seemed, over something Barton had said earlier. The conversation was short lived once they saw the sight in front of them.
Sighing, Howard conceded, "That's a fair point. I'll-I'll talk to him." He dropped his chin to his chest. "I promise."
The look Steve gave him was meant to be stern, but all Tony could think of was draping himself over Steve's lap and being spanked. Damn. Where did the daddy kink come from? That was a new one!
"Thanks, JARVIS." Setting the boxes on the counter, Natasha opened the cabinet above her head to pull out plates. "Can you tell them all we bring nourishment in the form of processed pork?"
He expected Steve to frown at him or to look disappointed. He didn't expect Steve to throw his head back and laugh. "I deserve that."
Finally turning from Steve, Tony chimes in, "Mutz on the fries and brown gravy on the side. Extra coleslaw and pickles. Please," he adds as an afterthought.
Inside the room, Steve took the chair left for family and Tony sat on the exam table, the white sanitary paper crinkling underneath him.
Howard took a long drink. Pulling the glass back and giving it an appreciative look, he raised his eyebrows. "That's fucking delicious."
He stepped forward, to the edge of the stage, "Sometimes the media really knows how to get it wrong in a
"Those aren't the right words at all," he teased, cupping the back of Steve's neck to bring him down for another kiss. "The right words are:
His hands flew up to the back of the lounger, clinging to it as he growled his moans, his voice in the beginnings of going hoarse, the intensity overwhelming. Between them, Tony's dick was bouncing, sending smears of precome tapping along his lower stomach. Steve's chest heaved with the exertion, the burn in his lungs brilliant and satisfying.
Tony sighed dramatically, a small smile playing at the corners of his mouth. "What did I just say? This is about what you want."
"Regardless," Hill snapped, her expression edging into annoyed, "the whole world is now cognizant of Howard Stark -- looking fresh and young -- running around the city, saving his son. When he died an old man over twenty years ago."
text. It's in the kitchen. I think a visit from SHIELD would help aid the New York Public Library in permanently relinquishing it to us."
As Tony leaned against the door frame and sipped black coffee from a Thor themed mug, he wondered at the absurdity of it all.
"I'll find clean clothes for you," she offered, lingering in the doorway a while later, "and we'll get you toiletries and whatever else you need. For now, stick to the guest room, the kitchen, the living room, and the bathroom. You can go to the landing pad if you need fresh air, but don't go anywhere else."
Steve sunk his teeth into Tony's neck, biting down hard enough to leave a mark but not break skin. "The last lines, Mr. Stark. Tell me." A bead of sweat rolled down his chest, falling to where their bodies connected and mingling with the sheen of perspiration along Tony's body.
Tony let him up, returning to his position on the lounger like nothing had happened at all. "Are you in or out,
His head dropped to the side, facing out. And it took a moment, but his eyes focused on two figures just beyond the glass wall.
JARVIS zeroed in on the building through the hub. It was indeed a house, the wooden exterior painted a slate blue and a sign -- in the quintessential
Staring back at him from the mirror over the sink was a stranger. He felt disconnected, like he was floating above his own life. His eyes were hollow and dark, and under them, the skin was bruised and tired. He looked sick and sallow. His thumbs were stinging, and when he looked down, he saw that he had unconsciously picked at his cuticles until the skin around his nails was raw and bleeding.
Really? But once Clint shows him the shooting range and what he's capable of, Tony's already got half a dozen ideas for how to upgrade his bow and his arrows.
as many fans as the late 90's and early aughts, but the quantity was still nothing to scoff at. And they still screamed
Tony laughed hard at that, bent over and rolling with it, wiping tears and letting his face crack open in a bright grin. "That's one way to put it!"
"Oh, God!" Tony yelled out, unable to do anything but hold on, his nails digging into the skin on Steve's back and leaving little pink half-moons along his cream colored skin.
Steve answers the call and drops his head into his free hand. "Nat?" He's barely able to choke out her name.
"I'm very happy to see how you handled that Miranda Cummings incident last week," Nick Fury said, leaning back in his office chair and propping his feet on his oak desk. "You are more than a manager, Nat, you're public relations and promotion rolled into one."
There was a certain innocence to the young fools, parading around in short skirts or tight button downs. The air mingled with perfume and cologne, the scent of alcohol and cigarettes, pizza, burgers, dirty water dogs, and pretzels. Laughter as one girl finally gave into her aching feet as she kicked off her heels and ran barefoot - a definite risk! - down the steps to track 15 when the Long Island Railroad throws a curveball and goes to an unexpected track.
I've kept the sex written here non-explicit, but this chapter jumps that. It's not as explicit as I write in my smut fics, not even close, but it's definitely more risque than the rest of the sex in this fic. Just a warning. You can skip right past it and go straight to the talking if you want.
The guest bedroom hadn't been used in a while and Steve's upbringing demanded he change the sheets on the bed. He propped Howard up at the kitchen island with a glass of water and two Excedrin and raided the linen closet for fresh bed-sheets. Howard seemed okay for the moment, so he dropped a blanket over Clint's sleeping form and left a glass of water with two more Excedrin next to it on the coffee table. He didn't want to deal with a hungover Barton. That never went over well.
"Tony! Oh god, what about Tony? I just- I just got him back!" Steve turned to press his forehead against Tony's, his eyes filling with unshed tears. His left hand reached up, cupping Tony's cheek, his eyes not moving from the other's, which were wide and frightened. Tony had faced his mortality before, but not like this. If Howard being there meant he was never born, there wouldn't even be a legacy to leave behind. Not to mention the ramifications of a world without Stark technology.
Steve was losing him. This was a train of thought he didn't want Tony following. "Don't think on it, babe," he said softly, picking up the bottle again and lubing himself quickly. With an extra squirt from the bottle, he pressed one finger into Tony, slicking him and taking his mind from past memories of his drunk father to the present, where Steve was slowly sliding into him.
"Stark's a little tipsy, I should get him to bed anyway." Steve had a feeling he knew exactly what was up. And he'd be yelling at them all later for the whole fanfiction thing, rest assured.
Those words caused Tony's heart to drop. He hated to admit it, but he had been wishing that maybe, just maybe, Steve felt the same about him, despite the fact that he knew better. Obviously, he was wrong.
And answering Steve means admitting how in love with him Tony actually is. And knowing that Steve feels the same way… He's not strong enough to say no. Not even close. He knows he'll give in, and then he's damning Steve to turmoil and stress. To dealing with the media and with Tony's baggage.
"True. Could be worse," Rhodey said casually, "he could have become an evil villain instead of a mad scientist with a hero complex."
"Of course," she nodded. He slipped the hoodie back over his head, and stepped onto the scale. Steve's breath caught in anticipation as she slid the metal rungs back and forth.
"I like both. I'm gay. A poofter, whatever you called in back in the sixties." Tony's feet moved, stepping backwards and into the kitchen. He was proud, but he was still retreating. Howard remained frozen, unable to act or breathe. Tony was gay?
They ate lunch in a little cafe around the corner, munching on club sandwiches, BLTs, and in house pickles and chips. Tony tried to push the exhibit from his mind, to force himself to be content with how things were. He was friends with Steve. He needed to be happy he had that.
"Hey, wait." Steve stopped but didn't turn around at Tony's voice. He waited, shoulders tense, for him to continue. "Listen, Steve. I'm sorry. You shouldn't have had to see that. Or hear that." There was no need to clarify; they both knew what Tony was referring to.
"I haven't slept well," Tony admitted quietly. "Without you next to me I just tossed and turned. All I wanted to do was sleep, and I just couldn't."
Tony was upside down on the couch. It was just his way, Steve knew, but he still thought it was weird. It didn't mean Steve loved him any less, of course. On the contrary, his adoration was deepened by Tony's little quirks. He was so unashamedly himself that it was hard
Steve didn't look convinced, but his face softened, if only a little. "Howard, you need to go home."
"What can I do ya for, Natashalie. Business or pleasure?" Tony said, standing and stretching. Looked like he was going to be staying in the workshop. His couch was comfy as hell anyway.
Tony sighed, setting his cup back down. The delicate china clincked against its saucer, a cutting sound that sliced through their thoughts.
"Maybe. But…" Tony pauses, looking away and out at the night sky, "sometimes it's easier not sleeping." He speaks cautiously like he's treading across a busy intersection. If he reveals that he's going one way, maybe the drivers will notice and slow down for him. "I don't have very pleasant dreams anymore," he continues, hoping that by being honest about his own mental state for once, Steve might follow suit. "All the missions, the monsters, the deaths we can't seem to avoid… It's built up. I'm… I'm worn out like I don't think I've ever been, not even in Afghanistan, but sleeping brings nothing but exaggerated reminders. It really sucks." Holding his hands out, Tony turns them palm up, showing that they are empty.
"Bed." Tony was kicking his pants off, stroking his dick a few times before he moved to take the hoodie off.
Howard was just coming out of the bathroom as Steve walked down the hallway, and Steve paused, unsure of what to do. He was given a hesitant smile as Howard paused in the doorway. "Go ahead," he gestured with a sweep of his arm indicating that Steve could pass.
"Oh, give it a rest! We figured out it was you like right away, man. Relax. We're all for it." He pushed the cursor, opening Steve's documents and scanning them. "Let me see your unfinished ones, e-mail them to me. I can look them over tomorrow and maybe help you complete them."
"I'm sorry," Rhodey said, sounding not at all apologetic, "but I will continue to refer to you as Mr. Stark. You see, I don't like you. But apparently you're useful. So I'll hide my contempt." Howard was rightly taken aback by that, and Rhodey suppressed a grin.
The Saturday crowd was out: couples loaded up with buys from the farmer's market in the park, twenty-somethings lugging themselves to brunch after a night spent partying, and parents chasing their children down the sidewalks, searching for something to do now that the weekend was here. He weaved his way through them, keeping his eyes down and acting like he was one of them. Just a regular guy out for a stroll. No Hulk. No world-saving.
"Just him and Fido." His usual battle gusto was there, but Steve could hear the underlying current of Tony's emotions slinking behind the saucy tone.
"You gonna carry it?" He mockingly cowered when she raised her fist again, holding up his hands in defeat. "Okay! Okay! Uncle! Uncle! I'll carry it!"
"I can live with that," Tony says. It's information, and Tony will never say no to knowledge. Learning is part of what keeps him together.
"Shut up, Barton!" Groaning, she heaved herself from the chair. "All this thinking has made me hungry."
Tony sniffed, "I'm sorry, I'm being fucking ridiculous." Bringing up his free hand, he wiped at his eyes, refusing to let them spill over. Because
"I swear she's not replacing you, JARVIS." He just loved the idea of artificial intelligence, JARVIS or otherwise and frankly he was lucky Tony didn't throw the thing out as soon as Steve had brought it home.
"Beats me. This is your experimental shit. I still have doubts this thing is going to come off me without the landing pad."
He read everything. The classics, the contemporaries. Books of poetry, trashy drug store novels. Tony read whatever he could get his hands on.
When she next looked up, tucking her phone back into her pocket, it was to see Howard wearing the box the pin came in as a hat.
"It's getting better. You're going to feel perfect soon. I'm sure." Steve placed another kiss on his head; Tony really loved that. "You going to speak to the press?"
Frowning, Natasha laid the crease in her left palm and flipped it open with her right. "The Avengers! Nick,
Steve's pain from waking up so far removed from everything he'd known diminished more and more each day because he had a new family. New friends. A new life. A boyfriend who adored him. A home. Love. Comfort.
Clint swallowed and opened up one arm to her, an invitation for physical comfort that she took readily. He pulled her in close, kissing the top of her head. "We're not going to lose 'em." As usual, he was able to hone in on exactly what was bothering her -- that it wasn't just Tony, but the possibility of losing Steve as well, probably from sheer heartbreak if Tony vanishing didn't go unnoticed. "We'll figure something out," he whispered into her ear, his other arm coming up to complete the hug. "They're not escaping us that easily."
"She's intense. But once you get to know her, she's nothing more than a little kitten." Coulson reassures.
"I spent two days drinking it away." Steve didn't know why he continued talking. "But I felt some satisfaction watching the light go out. I knew what he was. But I ain't never killed before."
"One day," he said quickly, standing and racing to the door, "one day ya use that money, and you come back to me."
His phone rings, and Steve is momentarily elated. It's Tony! It's Tony telling him he's okay. It's Tony saying that there was a mistake, he got the flight number wrong when he informed Bruce, he's really still sitting in the airport, waiting for his gate to be called, he's-
"Hey! That's not what you say to someone who just did you a favor!" She was still laughing, pulling out one of his stools and flopping down.
"That's us!" Clint raised his hand at the maitre d', walking forwards with Tony behind him. They followed to their table, sitting and picking up the menus. "I want a big, fat, juicy steak. Covered in butter."
"You've made yourself at home, I see." Planting her feet on the ground, she left her seat, coming to stand beside Howard. "I am," she answered, pulling open the drawer with the menus that was next to him, "but let's order in."
another concern, that being the drunk archer and the even more inebriated time traveler. And the fact that he had no interest in tempting the Other Guy by going anywhere near Howard Stark.
doesn't mean that if you see me doing something stuipd you shouldn't say anything." He sat up just enough to look directly in Steve's eyes, showing every bit of himself. It made Steve's heart skip, seeing how hard Tony was trying to present his vulnerability to Steve. "You have a voice. And I want you to use it. It's just sometimes I'm going to ask you to take a step back. In battles, I fully expect you to argue with me. It keeps us both alive. But when it comes to stuff like this, I need to make my own mistakes as well." Tony let his hands slide up Steve's body and drape around his neck, pressing his forehead against his. "You can't always protect me. But that doesn't mean I want you to stop trying. Pick and choose your battles. I need to get hurt to learn. You too."
Steve loved the Avengers. They gave him a family when he had lost his own. He had a different relationship with each of them, and he appreciated every one. Nat was like the sister he never had: she put him in his place and challenged him. Clint was the guy you went to when you wanted to have fun but also feel secure and included. Thor was the big brother who loved unconditionally and had the best advice. Bruce told it like it was, never sugar coating it, but somehow it always came out kindly. And Tony.
"Come on," she said instead, walking back to the door, "I'll let it slide this time, in light of…well. In light of." It wasn't time yet to finish that thought. Clint was like her -- he'd want to only have to say it once. And if they wanted to forewarn Steve and Tony as well as Howard before Fury showed up, they needed to hurry into the living room.
Tony moved back to face the lenses, sliding his chin onto the prop as he covered Steve's hand with his. "A-S-S...I...W--" Pausing, Tony squeezed Steve's hand and dragged it up, settling it on his quickly hardening cock. He squinted, mouthing the letters and making out the rest of the sentence, before sitting back enough to lightly thrust up into Steve's hand. "You're so polite, saying please." With his other hand, he returned his glasses to his face.
But so early in the morning, with the city muffled and the sky a vibrant burst of pastel, the feeling the snow generates is more sleepy, and from inside the tower—where it's warm—it's almost cozy.
And Tony laid his head in Steve's chest and just breathed. He was so up and down about everything. He wanted Steve, needed to be with him because he had never, in all his life, felt this type of love. This type of connection.
"I'll show you chewy!" If Steve found himself with an armful of Tony, well, he considered it mission accomplished.
"Yes! See? I knew you were smart," cheeked Tony, lifting the door to the dishwasher and clicking it closed. He turned the knob and hit start. "One of the greatest movies ever made. Right, Steve?"
"It's not an easy job, Anthony," Michael continues, "but it's rewarding. And though you're technically immortal, you
It didn't help. Not that Bruce had meant it to. Steve wouldn't actually kill them. There was a lecture in their future,
Tony shrugged, both arms up with a dramatic flair of unknowing. "Beats me! I've been told that for a genius, I can be a real fucking idiot!"
Steve sees right through him. "Steve," he says with a soft voice, coming to stand closer to Tony. His hand still hasn't left his shoulder. "In uniform, I can be Cap. But here? I'm just Steve."
"Don't pull my leg, Tony, not right now." Steve's response is almost sad like he had a glimmer of hope before being crushed. Tony feels his heart skip a beat.
Steve. His timbre deep and steady as he recited poem after poem, Steve's head in his lap. After a hard mission, after a bad day, after Peggy passed…
"My own?" Dum-E wheeled back, his claw rising and falling in excitement, the tennis ball in his grip. It took Howard a second to react to the robot, moving to step out of the way of the excited claw, surprise clearly evident in his movements.
"I'm so sorry you lost your life, Tony." Stepping back, Yinsen holds him at arm's length, studying him. "You look good. Particularly now that your chest does not glow blue."
Six figures, obviously in the aftermath of a battle, stood staring out toward the camera, combat weary and dirty, but proud. A large green thing in the back - a bit frightening to be honest; a beautiful redhead who looked just as dangerous as Howard liked them; a red and gold robot with glowing eyes; a man clenching a bow with his arrows just barely visible on his back; an imposing man wielding a huge hammer with long blonde hair; and Steve. In his full Captain America uniform, cowl pushed back, shield hanging from his hand. It was a newspaper clipping, taken from what Howard could guess as the front page because of its size.
"What's going on?!" Steve pulls him into a hug again, burying his face in Tony's hair. "We thought we lost you!"
Tony is having a hard time hiding his curiosity…This is something big. Huge, by the sounds of it. "Who's the Captain? And what does this have to do with my father?"
Steve and Tony had a love she could only hope to one day attain herself, but it wasn't perfect. The road to hell, as the saying went, was paved with good intentions. Steve fought with Howard, and Howard fought with Steve. That was the divot on the road, a giant pothole that continuously derailed any attempts that the two of them made to step in the right direction regarding their issues with each other. It was possible that Steve had overreacted. It was possible that Tony had expected the worst - and really, why wouldn't he? - and had interpreted Howard's reaction incorrectly.
"Quite a pair, we are." Standing, Tony moved to Steve's dresser, pulling out a pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt he could wear after he had showered. "So, lunch. What are we in the mood for?"
This is exactly why Clint hated getting involved with other people's business. Not that it ever stopped him.
"Jesus Christ, relax." He responded, exasperated. "I'm okay. I promise. I just need to talk with Steve." At Clint's knowing look, he continued. "I got issues. My issues have issues. I know dating Steve won't fix them, but it's a start, okay? Don't worry your pretty little head."
Another shift and Howard was kneeling on the mattress like he was about to pray. His hands immediately went to do, well, anything else. The thought of a God who gave a crap about him was laughable. Steve believed, at least Howard thought he still did, and that faith was certainly inspiring, if a little annoying. If the Old Guy did exist, he had no time for alcoholic child abusers.
Steve sighed in relief as Tony stopped short of telling him. "Tones, go to bed, or go to the workshop. Play fetch with Dum-E or something."
"Thanks for cooling me off; it's so hot out today; I didn't know what to do." Steve turns to the snowman with a grin, plucking beans out of the bag and arranging them to make the face. Three grouped together for each eye, seven for the smile.
Bruce waved his hand dismissively, already pulling things from the plastic bags. "Forty-five at the least."
"I could have acted like I didn't know him! I could have, I don't know!" He threw his arms up in frustration. "If I hadn't overreacted, we could have just told the others,
Tony was so enamored with Steve's excitement, he didn't notice (until they were there for almost an hour.), the signs for an exhibit. He had looked away from Steve quickly to not get caught staring at him as the soldier was talking about some artist he admired.
Tony balked, "Excuse me? Who's the one who all but demanded I drop all my projects to read. As well as my pants."
"Your health is important, as would any of ours be, Tones, if it were someone else. We've separated the counters because we don't need much space to make a sandwich." Tony listened to Steve speak, his bottom lip quivering just a little as the emotions threatened to take over. He had never felt so unequivocally loved before. "We got a new toaster, look," Steve gestured, lightly guiding Tony to turn with a hand on his back. The new one was labeled
"You being so antithetical is part of why I fell in love with you in the first place," he murmured against Tony's mouth. "I love that you redefine terms, reinvent them like your creations."
"We're close, but no one has ever been able to reach Tony like you." Moving to the coffee table and picking up a tray, he held it out to Rhodey. "And try to get him to eat something?"
The voicemail was still saved on her phone, but she had listened to it enough to memorize it. The first time, her mouth had gone slack at the shock of it, and she had called Tony immediately, but through his slew of
Leaning forward, his elbows bracing on the table, Tony swiped through his phone, tapping the internet open and refreshing StonyFan1918's page, which he had never cleared from his browser.
"If you had just stopped goading her for one second, we could have caught her and been done with it!" His head snaps to the right, glaring at Tony, knuckles tight around the metal rails on the side of the bed.
That was Steve's first hint to how wrong the situation was. The second was that Tony wasn't overtly working on anything. Steve watched from behind the glass wall for a few minutes, studying Tony's form as he sat, pulling out wires from one of his gauntlets and tossing them. To the unknowing eye, Tony was busy doing what he did the best, which was building. Steve knew better. This was Tony throwing himself into anything in order to distract himself. Fixing problems that he invented with an anxious mind, could bes, maybes, might happens… It often helped to solve issues before they arose, and if Tony was anything, he was definitely a problem solver and proactive in anticipating what could potentially go wrong. An engineer at heart.
Steve thought for a moment, contemplating how to answer. Howard was right, of course. He was at fault for what happened, but his intentions were in no way malicious. He didn't set out to hurt anyone. He had just wanted to see his friend. "I think it's safe to say that while you did start this, you weren't looking to cause any trouble."
He nodded and rushed as well as he could with a drum section practicing in his temples, slamming the door behind him. And no, he wasn't ashamed when he sat. He could barely hold himself up and pissing all over himself wasn't anything that was on his current to-do list. Ever.
Clint whipped his cell out and tapped, her phone going off a moment later. "Really?" She glared at him, eyebrows raised.
Dropping the book to the wicker table next to him, Clint gave her his full attention by leaning forward, steepling his fingers, and laying on the sarcasm. "Oh yes, Natasha, go right ahead and maim the man who one day has to convince a woman to fuck him so Tony can be born."
"Thinking about anything else, even on my birthday," Tony's voice was quiet, hurt. "At least he's predictable."
"No," she said slowly instead, "but close. This is New York, guys. Both of these shows. It'll be a rough weekend, you don't need to headline two shows back to back in one weekend in June when you're
Tony prepared him slowly and sank into his body with a moan. The food was ice cold when they finally got around to eating it, but neither cared. They were sated and hungry and content - for the moment - to be together, just the two of them.
"Come here first." Tugging Tony, Steve swept him up in his arms and kissed him breathless. "No matter what happens, I love you."
"It's sexy time!" Tony celebrated, tossing the heavy talk with Natasha from his mind. Jerking off required only happy thoughts. Things like Steve's lips, his fingers, his tongue... "Jarvis. Assume the position!"
"Oh, what a travesty!" Steve jokingly balked, turning to swat at Tony's ass with a dish rag, "Get a move on!"
Steve lifted him easily, setting him onto his feet, "Come on, you need to sleep." They got as far as the doorway before Tony was screaming.
Tony's head popped up from its hiding place, his chin propped up on Steve. His eyes were dancing, full of mischief, until slowly they dimmed, and he looked contemplative for a moment before blinking, a little sadness creeping in around the edges. Steve cupped his cheek, instantly worried.
"What? How?" Natasha paused while sliding the cutting board from its place behind the bread box. "You figured it out."
Tony stayed quiet after that, contemplating what Rhodey had said and slowly making his way through his dessert and (admittedly very good) espresso. After he scooped the last of the ice cream from the plate, he sat back, feeling, well… Feeling satisfied. Feeling good. It was new. Unheard of for him. This wasn't anything he was used to, but he liked it.
Blinking, Steve found himself standing in the middle of the living room, staring off into space. "Huh?" He felt hollow, like he was floating, disconnected from his body.
The backhand had sent Tony sailing to the floor. He cried out and slammed his hand over his mouth to stop any more sounds from escaping.
"Thank you. It's nice to know I'm not alone." He gave a quick nod of his head, signaling he was finished.
Tony's legs clamped around him, his hands went to his back, nails digging in, and he moaned. "Fuck me!"
"I know it hurts; dying in such a violent way always does. That's why I brought you here. Look," the man has dark hair and bright blue eyes, his voice deep and soothing, "the sun is setting. Isn't it beautiful?"
"Careful!" Bruce chastised lightly, "Or we lose our explosives genius." His smile was friendly, showing Clint he was just teasing.
But she didn't kill him, so that was a win. "He's another occupant of the tower. You probably won't meet him anytime soon."
"Yeah! Completely! And if you choose to not stay here, that's your decision. I'll buy you a house in Wisconsin if that's what you want."
"Gotta wait that long? How much time you got?" Steve was already standing up, looking Tony up and down and walking towards him.
"He'll have to get scoped, as well." Bruce continued. "But this is good news!" Steve couldn't see how. "With celiac, all he'll have to do is go gluten free. Then he'll be back to the Tony we all know and love!"
"Where he's not sick and not on the verge of depression?" Steve frowned, glancing away from Tony just for a second to shoot Natasha a loaded look.
Lifting Tony from the chair, Steve stood, letting gravity drop him on his dick. Tony keened, his arms flailing to grapple at Steve's shoulders. Stilling his body even though Tony's hips never stopped trying to rock on his cock, Steve leaned close to Tony's ear. "Can you read the chart for me, Mr. Stark?"
"Uh, yeah, sure, Stevie. Just a sec." Tony made no move to exit the room. "Come to my suite when you're done. I'll get you something clean to wear to bed."
It didn't take much to convince Tony to leave the tower, and he wasn't sure how they did it but when they left at noon, Howard was nowhere to be seen.
Tony had stood in his own way long enough. It was time for action. If he even had a modicum of a chance at happiness with Steve, this was it, right? He couldn't blow it.
Hill had been clear in what she knew. The spell was irreversible, and the only other person they knew of who had performed it was still living his life out in the future. Fury knew more, and they had left a message for him to get over to the tower as soon as possible. Which made it even more prudent that they hasten their steps. The team needed to be forewarned.
Tony writhed, unable to stop his hips from undulating as his ass was worked so thoroughly with the digits. He let out a whine, "Steve…"
On his knees and obviously injured, Tony's head snapped up. His arm, cradling his ribs where the tail struck, tightened in fear. Far from riding a dragon, the man - from the folds of his long coat - pulled out the next best thing: a crossbow. A fucking crossbow.
"Will do. Thank you, again." His eyes finally landed on Steve. "You're still here? I figured you'd be in bed by now. It's after eleven."
"Sir and Captain Rogers are in Sir's suite," JARVIS began. "Doctor Banner is in his lab, and Mr. Stark is in the guest quarters."
"Natasha!" Thor's voice came over the line, "How are you fairing, dear friend? Are you still angry?"
There, he had accepted his fate, gazed upon stars he had never seen before, and closed his eyes. At least the wormhole held a purpose. He was doing something right, sacrificing himself to save the lives of millions. This? This was nothing but a replay of every emotion his childhood trauma could throw at him. He felt like one of those big black garbage bags that landscapers used in the yard. He had too many sticks shoved inside and was beginning to tear, every flaw and every hidden bundle of secrecy starting to spill out.
Steve took the plates, grinning at Bruce, "Sure thing." He handed a few to Howard, jerking his head to the dining room just beyond the door. "Gotta put you to work now." Howard graciously took the plates, looking around curiously. Steve knew that look. It was the same he had when the tower went from a place he visited to his home. "It'll get easier," he spoke sotto voce, so only Howard could hear him. The others were barely concealing their own curious looks at Howard.
She unwrapped a piece of chocolate for herself, popping it into her mouth and chewing thoughtfully before answering. "But it's still making you angry."
"Point. But Tony's also a grown ass man, Nat," he said, lifting a finger to enunciate what he was saying, "And he won't even admit that he was abused. Is it really the right thing to force him to? That's just going to hurt him even more."
"I admire that about you, but it also drives me insane. We're a management firm, Natasha," Fury spoke, pulling his feet from the desk and leaning forward, "and not a temporary one."
"The last one." His fingers twirled the spoon, dipping into the ice cream and slicing through the brownie, the cream of the melted treat pooling around the base of the brownie.
On top of it all, Tony was still a hard person to love, at least he thought so. He was too smart, too vocal, and too disharmonious with almost everything Steve stood for. They were opposites; they were perfect for each other.
Howard was quiet, contemplating. His eyes fell to the floor, and his silence stretched for almost a full minute. At length, he looked up, staring into Thor's eyes. "No. I feel like I should be, but… No."
"And then what?" Tony asks, feeling a little lightheaded. The idea of being dragged to hell is horrifying. "We're just...trapped? There? In the...the other place?" He's named it before. Used the word a million times, but knowing what he knows how… it's become too real.
. He's kind of like a robotic butler, but he does so much more." Talking about his creations always swelled up pride in him. "He runs the tower. Hell, he runs my life. JARVIS, say hi."
The Great Tony Stark, who put on all the sass in public but behind closed doors was just a scared little nerd who only wanted to build robots. And on that night, when he should have been posturing around his newest creation with a father fit to burst with pride, he was instead cowered on the floor, whimpering. One hand covering his mouth, the other protecting his head. Waiting for the rest of the blows that always came.
Each drawing was a different facet. A confusing, complicated, deeply damaged but still so loving man. Sadness and stubbornness, incandescent emotion huddled up in resilience. He challenged the world but also hid from it. Strength, courage, and pain. Like a kaleidoscope, beautiful and dizzying and addicting all at once.
Sitting back at the kitchen Island, he fiddled with the side buttons until the screen turned on. Natasha was so much more forthcoming with information. She probably wanted him to use it. She wanted him to find out what happened, who
Tony jolted when his phone started to ring in his hand, already consumed by the story. "Ah, fuck." It was Natasha, not that it was a bad thing, but he had to answer, just in case.
Bruce's face was red with embarrassment. Oh well. That's what he got for choosing Tony as his best friend. "Forget it. I don't want to go to lunch with two horn dogs."
"This is the bridge from that fanfiction." Steve said quietly. But it wasn't said as a question. It was a statement. Like Steve knew they were headed there.
It had started out all right. He saw Howard. He called him Asshole. But then Natasha broke out the vodka, and he found himself
A dame with some of the nicest stems he had ever seen wandered into view, and he looked up at her from his bent position, a flirtatious smile playing on his lips. "Antonio, there's a man at the front. Says he knows ya."
He threw everything onto a clean spot on the bed, lest he ended up with a smear of lube on his shirt, and that just would not do. Nope. It wouldn't. From his dresser, he picked through his underwear, still a mess from Natasha's rooting through it. Oh well. He plucked a pair of black silky briefs. Just in case.
Clint throws his head back and laughs. "I'll keep that in mind." He shoulders the quiver and picks up the case he had just placed his bow into. "But for real, Stark? The fact that Phil went out of his way to introduce you to me? Chuffed as
"You can't resist me forever, Rogers!" Tony sang out, giving in to the need to shower. "I'll get details from Bruce, you heathen!" He pulled his phone from the extra charging stand he kept in Steve's room, scrolling through his recent calls. Putting the phone up to his ear, he listened to it ring, "Babe, what do you want for lunch?"
The pain is intensifying, and Tony gasps, unable to respond. The man gathers him into his arms. It's so gentle and sure that he's able to do it without jostling Tony's wrecked body too much. He holds Tony against him, carefully lifting his head to see the sunset.
"Count me out," Tony answered, stretching, "I'm not hungry, think I'll take the guitar outside." He ambled to his feet and picked up his Martin and the red leather journal he used for writing his lyrics and guitar tabs.
Picking up a spoon and inching toward the mashed potatoes, Tony attempted to covertly steal a taste. Steve let him. "What would you do without me?"
"Explain what?" Tony snapped, rubbing the washcloth along his front before bringing it around to wipe his backside. "That you
Happy was waiting for them outside, ready to close the doors behind them and drive off quickly to keep Tony from the public view as best as possible.
Tony hid himself away, never venturing outside, even to the landing pad. He didn't go to the office, he didn't try to fly the suit, he just lay on his bed or on a couch or armchair, reading. At this point, even the tablet was forgotten. Steve had never known Tony to have any interest at all in fiction, had even seen him scoff at it. The small library in between the common floor and the gym only ever got use from himself and Bruce, or sometimes Thor if he was bored. But never Tony.
She waved her hand over her shoulder as she entered her room, an obvious dismissal. But his raised voice had finally drawn Howard's attention.
"Shh, baby, just feel me," Steve whispered, beginning to rock his hips in the steady motion he knew drove Tony crazy.
After a week, he had put on a little weight, not enough, but some. It overjoyed the team anyway, and they celebrated with milkshakes (Natasha was a pro at making those).
She tugged him so he faced away from the window, stepping around so their positions were switched, "This Howard is from 1961, Rhodes. Do you get what that means?"
And Tony! Well, from the few interactions he had with the man, he seemed, hell, he seemed incredible. Smart. Witty. Kind. He had created that exoskeleton armour, which to be frank was amazing. So, his child had gone into engineering. Something he, himself, loved! He had yelled at Howard,
"Now, if you could say that at the next award ceremony I'm forced to attend, that would be perfect." Taking the cellphone box from Clint's hand, he popped it open and pulled out the device. Clint sat next to him, picking up his drink and frowning as he looked into it.
over his best friend. Oh, he worried. And that was an understatement. He worried Tony would fall into bed with the wrong person, or piss off the wrong businessman. He worried he'd drink himself into an early grave. He worried at the lonely nights spent in his workshop,
He grabbed a fist full of napkins and three teaspoons, shoving them into the front pocket of his hoodie and lifted the tray. "Tea time!" He called, walking into the living room and speaking with an over the top posh accent. "Served by Captain United Kingdom!"
"Somehow hiding it better, but he's a mess as well. You're definitely needed, though neither will admit it."
Howard watched Steve's retreating form with an affronted look on his face. This was certainly not how he had planned on meeting Steve again. He didn't know who the other man was, he'd barely gotten a good look at him either, but he must have been important for Steve to take off like he did.
Though half asleep, Tony grabbed one of the dry ones to wipe the water from Steve's own skin. The towels were pushed lazily to the floor and the blankets pulled up, Tony curling into Steve's chest.
His hand opens and closes. Opens and closes. He reaches around the blankets, searching for softness, but there is none. He lets his head fall to the side, looking out the window. It's nighttime, and he can just make out the moon in between buildings. His eyes fall shut.
Slowly, Tony sank down on him, sighing contentedly as he did so. Steve let out a puff of breath, the tightness and warmth around him almost too much.
With a giggly laugh (and Tony would rib him for that later), Steve stepped behind Tony as they walked through the door, sliding his hands around to cup Tony's, ah, belly under his shirt.
Howard. Tony didn't know how far down, but he knew it was there. The pride, the love, and the kindness Howard had shown thus far could be erased with only a few words. It could hurt more than he ever thought it would. He had envisioned this moment countless times over the years, and it never ended happily. Sometimes it was Howard screaming, and sometimes it was Tony, finally getting the last word in.
the biggest boy band in the world. You couldn't pass a single newspaper stand or magazine cart without seeing their faces.
"I know. I'm sorry it took me so long to figure out. I feel like I wasted so much time when all I've wanted was to be with you. If you'd have me, I mean." He looked down, self-conscious and unsure of himself all at once. "I know I don't have the greatest past, and I know I'm damaged. I just wondered if you'd have me anyway. Because you're all I think about." It was hard, baring himself like he was, opening up to the vulnerabilities he so often tried to hide.
These people were crazy. That was the only explanation. Howard sat frozen in his seat, eyeing them warily. It was no wonder Steve was so different if this was his new team.
But when he opened his eyes—a sappy grin on his face—he saw Natasha, sitting on the floor and assembling a puzzle. So much for being alone.
They returned, hours later, to the television on, the news covering the attack, and Tony barely awake and watching in the armchair. They cautiously greeted him, mostly undamaged save for a few bumps and bruises, and a long gash up Steve's arm.
A weird, pained expression grew on Steve's face, starting in his eyes and cascading down to his mouth. Tony feared he knew, but this was not a conversation he wanted to have at the house. It was better to be in the air, where Steve couldn't delay their return, where there was a finite amount of time to discuss it.
"A voice, earlier, is what told me that there was food. And I've heard you all talking to something. And calling it Jarvis."
"He's an idiot," she says, and Tony feels his heart drop, "but he's my idiot. And he's a great judge of character. Welcome, Mr. Stark." She turns and leaves, and Tony looks at Coulson like he's about to flee.
Though he understood that this Howard was directly involved with creating the Howard that had abused Tony, it wasn't his intention. That right there went further than anything else. This Howard only wanted to help and heal his son, that he did it with his own dramatic flair was not lost on Steve, but somehow very appreciated. It felt good to meet this Howard again.
Nodding his thanks, Bruce entered the building, waiting for Steve before they set off to the elevator. Steve eyed him. "You okay?"
"I should just leave you to freeze," but Steve was already gliding his hands down Tony's flanks to his hips, trailing from there to his thighs and knees, and lifting his legs to wrap around Steve's waist. They were still naked from their lovemaking the night before, a feisty and charged festival of endurance and want, sparked by another close call, another mission barely won.
Tony adjusted himself so he was slightly on his side, tucking himself under Steve's arm. "All part of my charm."
JARVIS answered him with a tone that represented clear amusement to Tony. "No, Sir, he was being very careful."
"Howard Stark," she said, flopping onto the couch next to him, acting for all the world like she had zero training and was a woman who just so happened to stumble upon a man out of his own time.
"Precisely." Taking a deep breath, Fury sat back. "This is the part that gets confusing, if you can believe it. And the part I was dreading. As soon as I found out about you," he glanced at Howard, "I knew. This won't be easy to accept."
Bruce licks his lips, his eyes watery. He looks stricken, something Steve has never seen on him. His voice is flat as he repeats the information he has like he's done this before, and he has. Nine times since the breaking news bulletin flashed across the television screen. "He called me this morning. Preflight checks on his personal plane came back with engine issues. He said he was taking Flight 328 out of Singapore at 10pm their time." Shaking his head, Bruce looks away. "I'm sorry, Steve. I wish it wasn't true. Tony was on that plane."
Clint takes initiative, setting his tablet aside and standing to help Steve move Tony off of him. His agile fingers and quick reflexes catch Tony as he stumbles, and with Steve guiding him, is able to prop Tony up with a few pillows at the other end of the couch. "It's just us," he says to them, stepping back so Steve can drape the comforter over Tony, "Bruce mumbled something about time sensitive reactions - to be honest, I was only half listening - and Nat has a meeting downtown."
"And no spray tan is going to fix that paleness." Bruce continued. "He's really sick, but we can't force him to see a doctor. Let's try changing his diet first."
"About 220 million tons of old computers and other electronics are thrown away in the United States each year," Tony said cheekily.
"So you've come here not yet knowing of his existence?" It was difficult to piece together what had happened. He would have preferred to sit down with Romanoff and Barton first to gather information, but it was far more imperative to separate everyone. Particularly Romanoff; her temper was in full form, and it was best for everyone involved if she cooled down.
When he opens his eyes, he expects to see either desert or nothing. Tony Stark was never one for believing in the afterlife, after all. So, he doesn't expect a calm, green clearing, the grassy knoll he's laying on, nor the man seated next to him with crisp golden wings folded against his back.
Tony laughed, nuzzling his cheek against the head, causing Steve to shudder. "I bet." Moving back just enough, his tongue darted out to taste the tip, licking up a bead of precome. Steve's eyes fluttered closed, his hands going to the back of Tony's head. "Looks like you're an honest doctor. Good to know." He wrapped his lips around the head, sucking it softly into his mouth. Steve's hands tightened in Tony's hair, and he whimpered, his head following the motion of Steve's grip.
"What about dead fathers time traveling to the future?" Natasha asked in her usual unflappable way. Clint shot her an exasperated look,
Steve felt the passage of time slowly, even if he didn't comprehend it. He could see the minute hand of the clock on the wall making its way around and around, but each tick of each second, of each minute meant nothing to him.
"Tell her to start with karate. It's discipline, and it's a fighting style. She can move on to better martial arts in a few years when she's older," she said, and Tony knew she was secretly pleased.
In the corner cabinet, Steve pulls out Tony's favorite mug. For a moment, he contemplates filling it with coffee, like it usually is, but he shakes his head and turns back to the living room and toward the bar. Scotch. That's the only thing he wants. He can't get drunk, can't even get tipsy, but he can let the warmth of the drink hit the back of his throat and burn his tongue.
"I - ah - just wanted to apologize." Turning his head to the left and tearing his eyes away from the hallway Tony had disappeared down, it took Steve a moment to realize it was Howard talking to him.
"Steve!" Bruce felt his heart drop. He knew how much Steve loved Tony; he saw it every time he set eyes on him, but Steve could be really thick sometimes. His need to protect those he loved stemmed from losing everything he knew. Bruce understood that, but it didn't make Steve's actions always right. He was protective, but it could be suffocating, especially for Tony who had been on his own almost his entire life. Tony had a voice all his own, and he was never afraid to use it. Steve needed to understand that.
Knowing he needed to lighten the conversation before Tony's thoughts got too dark, Clint smirked, "Thousands, huh? Well, tell them they're doing a piss poor job of it." He shook out his cloth napkin in a grand flourish to send his point home, "I'll give you a diagnosis for free: you're a goddamn lunatic, and I love ya for it!"
"--What?" Tony's eyes, already half lidded, popped open as he struggled to remember what Steve was referring to. Before Tony could even try to answer him back, Steve dipped his head and let his tongue lightly lave against Tony's hole, flicking up and down against the soft skin around the opening.
Howard stepped around the bed, fully aware he was being, well, himself, and treading on already thin ice. But whoever she was had scurried underneath, the bed skirt swaying as a heel disappeared. "Damn, Stevie! I don't know who she is, but she sure does have a nice behind!"
"Not until you read the chart for me, Mr. Stark." In a frankly stunning display of strength and dexterity for an optometrist, Steve lifted Tony up off his cock and spun him midair, his hands under Tony's thighs to maneuver him, until Tony's back was against his chest. "Read the chart, Mr. Stark. Doctor's orders." With one hand around Tony's waist, holding him up, he used the other to line his cock up and impaled Tony right back onto him. Tony screamed, sobbing with want. His hands flailed behind him, fingers searching for purchase on Steve's arms.
For a moment, Tony was stunned, and Steve was sure he had judged the situation wrong, that Thor was going to bust in and take him out, hitting him over and over with his hammer until Steve's face was unrecognizable.
The visceral reaction whenever anyone even said the name Howard spoke otherwise, but Steve didn't mention that. Instead, he finally reached out and took the pin from Tony's hand.
Tony gave him a sad smile, "I know. I love you too. Just...be careful, okay? Don't break your promise."
"I assure you, Cap, I'm not. I swear." Turning to face Steve fully, Tony holds his hands up, "Don't forget who my father was. I grew up hearing about you. I idolized you."
"You were smarter than him. Better than him. You did nothing to deserve that, Tony. You deserved the world. Still do." The waitress walked over, two drinks and two plates on a tray. Tony looked at Rhodey, puzzled. He smiled, "I ordered for us while you are figuring things out." Espresso and a brownie with ice cream. It was exactly what Tony would have chosen for himself.
As he was turning to leave, Howard jumped up. "Wait! Tony!" Pausing with his hand on the doorframe, Tony looked expectantly at him. "Uh, do you want to- I mean, since we never got to do those father and son things-" he floundered, blush creeping up his neck, "-do you want to go to the zoo or something?"
Bruce tried to placate him, "Tony, he's fine. It really wasn't a big deal, we didn't even need the Other Guy."
"Clint's awake!" Natasha called cheerfully as she re-entered the kitchen, Clint trailing behind her and rubbing his side.
Turning away from the skyline, Howard looked at least a little abashed, although not by much; he was still Howard Stark, after all. Steve was at once both amused and angered.
"Yeah?" And Tony was almost embarrassed by how small his voice sounded. He cleared his throat, "Yes?" Good. That sounded more confident.
As promised, when Steve returned with two tall glasses filled with the smoothie, he dutifully drank one as Steve drank the other. He let Steve take his hand and lead him to the bathroom, let him carefully strip him of his dirty clothing before taking off his own. In the shower, Steve gently cleaned Tony's body, washing his hair and kissing his skin as he rinsed him. Tony felt his resolve slipping, but he remained strong in his decision. When Steve kissed him, Tony kissed back passionately, pouring all of his love into it.
He had received the spellbook from a high priestess of some super secret coven of sorts (read: stolen). Also, the abbreviation was now going to be SSSCofS, because
He made a face. "Even as a photo, I hate it." The people around them were studying the photos, talking excitedly in hushed whispers, thrilled to see, up close, the vehicles that had caused so much destruction, even in picture form. "Think we saw enough of the real thing." Tony said, walking around the wall and into the open room. Each section held photographs: different sizes, different lights, different perspectives of the disaster and the entire Avengers team. There was Natasha, midair as she jumped onto the back of one of the Chitauri. Clint moments after the release of an arrow, determination on his face, Bruce mid transformation, Thor with his hammer held high in the air, the look on his face pure warrior. And Steve. Captain America himself, jumping from the top of an over turned taxi, shield held high.
His entire life, Howard had always been sure of every move he made. His confidence never came with a price. He was Midas, and everything he touched turned to gold.
Even Bucky couldn't control Steve. He could guide and offer direction and help, but he couldn't always get through Steve's thick head.
"Don't mention it," Bruce said, plopping the cookies in front of Tony. "We're just glad you're going to be okay."
just going to mess them up again...He pulled a random flat sheet from the linen closet and tossed it onto the chair. He'd worry about that later.
Steve pulled a small serving dish from the cabinet and filled it with butter cookies. He arranged the rest to fit the platter and picked the tray up before cursing softly to himself and setting it back down. He'd forgotten the spoons and napkins. His fault, really, for listening more than doing.
She wasn't the only one, though maybe she was the only Avenger who ever acted out her fantasies of being normal. She knew Steve never had that chance, even if he started out without the serum, he had still been sickly and weak. Thor was a godly prince, so yeah, nope. Tony had been born into expectation and certain privilege. His father had gone 'round the bend, and he was a genius. He had no chance. Bruce? He probably prayed for a normal life nightly, and most likely still did. And Clint, damn. Clint would have given it all up just for a shot to have his parents and brother back as they were before his entire life went to hell. They wouldn't judge her, and there was a connection in that. Something deeper than friendship.
"All part of my charm." He flashed Howard his brightest smile. "I'm infuriating. Just ask Director Fury. Hey!" He pointed to Dum-E, changing the subject to something lighter. "How did you end up getting dragged into playing fetch with Dum-E anyway?" Not that Tony could blame him. His robots were the best. And if Dum-E already had Howard wrapped around his claw…
The smile he received was gentle, and he could tell just how much she loved her team. "Because he's let himself hold onto old wounds too long. It's time he lets himself heal."
A forceful breeze rustled the curtains, sending papers and sage rolling across the floor. The book that held the spell whipped through its pages, and the candles blew out with a finality.
"True, but we have so many that would fit the album perfectly. Is it a song that will make or break the album? Or just one we happen to like?"
It was nice to have even a semblance of normalcy after years in the spotlight, to be able to go to lunch without worrying about bodyguards and getting their shirts ripped clean off them, to be able to go food shopping or to the gym without a thousand cameras going off.
Steve waited twenty minutes instead of the asked for fifteen until he took the elevator down to the workshop, always thankful for JARVIS' insight in taking him where he needed to go. When he entered through the doors, it was to see Howard and Tony giggling over something, both leaning against one of the tables and trying to get a hold of their laughter. It struck him quite suddenly how happy he was to witness it. He had been so sure of his hatred of Howard. The feelings from the day Rhodey had come over, and Steve made tea and Tony called him Captain United Kingdom had boiled over until there was nothing left in the pot except for the blackened, burned bits. Steve had tried so hard to not show his contempt, but once the emotions became clear to him, it was nearly impossible for him to disguise them.
Steve's head turned sharply to face him. "What? My lady..? Just turn around!" If at all possible, he was coloring a deeper red.
Shrugging she went back to the puzzle, like she could not care less. "What are your plans for the rest of the night? Gonna eat something for once?"
Once they pulled away and the noise abated, Tony's head fell back against the head-rest, letting his walls drop for only a moment. He had tried, and mostly succeeded he thought, in looking completely unaffected by the tirade of questions thrown at him. The truth, however, was that it bothered him more than he would ever admit. They were
"I really do not feel like having to take Hulk down." The bag of sugar landed back on the table with a plop. "Though I could use a fun romp in a secure facility."
The engineer had made light of a serious situation, which in retrospect probably wasn't the smartest move a genius could make. But at the time, Bruce felt a sense of comfort and happiness that someone didn't feel afraid of him. Tony judged Bruce simply by his brain. Bruce was smart. He was as smart as Tony, maybe even more so, depending on who you asked, but Bruce didn't count the numbers like that. Tony knew things he could never and vice versa. They were both exceptional at different fields of scientific study. Tony didn't care that Bruce had a giant green problem, he only saw Bruce's intelligence. That's how he was judged the first time they met. For once, someone didn't shy away from him. They didn't cower in fear.
His hand slides beneath his pillow almost before he's completely set down, pulling out the worn, once blue blankie from where it lay hidden. He's not ashamed that Steve sees.
Steve shook his head, "All in the past. If anything, you've helped to make us stronger. We both had a lot to learn."
He and Bucky, sneaking in to see the newest motion picture. Or strolling through Central Park pretending they knew bird calls, when really they had worked out a system for the types of dames they saw (they really loved
Tony took a breath and looked up, his eyes red and puffy, but with an alertness she hadn't seen in months. "So, what now, Doc?"
"If you'll excuse my language, fuck propriety. Now-" Bruce turned to Thor, "-when is the pizza coming and for the love of all things good in the world, tell me at least one doesn't have pineapple on it."
Nat and Thor were squabbling over what music to play while they ate, Clint was sneaking pieces of chicken from the aluminium foil covered dishes that Bruce had set in the middle of the table, and Tony was counting forks from the drawer.
"I think," Tony swallowed, looking down at his lap. "I think for the first time in my life, I have a father who is proud of me." His eyes lifted, connecting with Steve's imploringly. "I've never had that before."
Giving up on diplomacy, Steve uses his Captain voice. "Chatter!" There's a slew of laughter, but they all settle down once again. "As I was saying. To a New Year! I wish for the safety of my family," he dips his glass at the Avengers, "happiness for my friends," this time to Pepper, Rhodey, and Happy, "and all the love in the world to the man who somehow found it within himself to love me in return."
"I'm an asshole inventor trying to be a better person and honestly failing half the time. All the money in the world can't make me as good as he is."
The Village Lantern was a small family owned German tavern that had been around since the mid nineteenth century. They boasted all sorts of German fare and a whole menu dedicated to beer they made in house. Bruce had only been once before, not long after the Chitauri, with Tony. Their sauerbraten was incredible, and he set the menu aside without even opening it.
Sexual jokes aside, Tony had never felt he had one. He sure as shit never called Howard that as a child. He called him father as he grew older and more rebellious, but even as a little boy, Howard was just
It wasn't much longer, the heat had built too greatly over the course of their lovemaking, the need over the duration of their knowing each other. His hips seized momentarily as he tumbled over the edge, his orgasm rocking his entire body, coming into Tony, filling him, still thrusting, though less controlled, the fucking so deep that some of it was pushed out through the force of it. His whole body was shaking as he came back down, his movements finally slowing to a stop.
Sitting on the porch with her feet up on the railing, Natasha dropped her head to the side to look at Clint. "He doesn't need his fingernails, right?"
Unfortunately, he was always annoyingly responsible. So, he just kissed Tony's head, grabbed his slippers from the floor at the foot of the bed, and left with a quiet, "Sleep, Tony," thrown over his shoulder as the door shut behind him.
"Seven. And now she wants to be a female superhero when she grows up. There are worse things, of course. But she filled my wife's Amazon cart with leather pants and knives. We emptied it and told her to start smaller."
As he turned back to sit in one of the chairs, he saw that although Thor was already halfway into the room and placing Mjolnir on one of the end tables next to his couch, Howard still stood in the doorway, looking uncertain.
he had been overjoyed at the chance of meeting one of his heroes. Being best friends with Tony Stark had its perks, after all.
"Colonel Rhodes, good to see you." Bruce shook his head in confusion, "I didn't know you were coming."
"Hawkeye," Steve warned, but a brilliant flash of red and gold streaked through the sky, pulling his attention from not only Clint but also the creature and its rider. With a start, Steve realized that this was the first time since before Howard came that Tony flew the suit. The injustice of their situation weighed heavily on Steve's shoulders. It wasn't right. Flying made Tony happy, and he hadn't been able to do it.
"Do you remember when I said that you don't know when your charge will die until a split second before they do?"
The elevator opened, and Pepper stepped out of the hallway and into the kitchen, her heels clicking in the way she loved best: authority on marble. A man was seated at the kitchen island, sipping coffee and ignoring a bag of chips open in front of him. She knew without asking that
"The you that was left behind," Fury's hand was warm on Howard's shoulder; Howard didn't remember him even moving to place it there, "being only a shadow of who you are, is the one who hurt his child. He had no positivity left. But -- and I am sorry to say this -- you're not off the hook. Had you never time traveled, you would have been a whole person."
But his upbringing stood out like a stain of Thor's favorite cloak; regardless of the beauty of the material, it was an oily mark anyone could see. Like the cloak, it was still useful and still his favorite; he continued to wear it no matter how obvious it was, because things - like life - never stay perfect. There was a grace in those imperfections. He may hate the way Tony was raised, but it made him who he was and that was a person whom Thor loved.
"It has been five months since I have been here." Thor said, his eyebrow raising, "I seem to remember it being Steven's turn."
Tony likes his blunt honesty. He can tell right off the bat that Clint is who he says he is and nothing more. It's refreshing. "We go way back," Tony says evasively about knowing Coulson. He adjusts his stance to what Clint has shown him.
Natasha nodded and left for the penthouse silently, the rest looking through the cracked open door at Tony; he was on his knees, hunched over the bowl, tear tracks on his face.
. It always ended up with Tony shaking and scared and cursing the day his father had met Captain America. Once, he had seen Howard hit Tony. Only once. After that, the bastard was more cautious, always waiting until Rhodey wasn't around.
All things that would have made Rhodey curse the day that bastard had been born, had it not been for the fact that without Howard, he would never have known Tony.
Barton was full on rubbing himself, walking closer to get a better view of what Steve was doing to Tony.
"Miss Potts, I swear to you, no one is trying to hurt him." Sitting next to her, he upturned his palms and shrugged. "None of us can figure out the right thing to do. This isn't an alien or a monster. We're trying our best. But-" he held up one finger, cutting her off before she could interrupt, "-I swear to you that nobody wants to see Tony hurt. Howard included."
The physicist just gave a soft laugh in answer, "His children," he said in response to the unspoken question. Tony's bots were his kids. He created them, and they loved him best.
"What? A little thing like knowing the intimate details of the tower? Of course not!" Finishing her drink, she picked up her fork and speared a potato from Clint's plate, popping it into her mouth.
"Show off," Tony grumbles as he struggles to lift the head. Steve only grins and hoists the smaller ball up and onto the larger one. They're not as smooth and circular as Tony's, but Steve has shaped them with the tops slightly tapered. It's an artist's touch, and Tony thinks they're perfect.
Against the window in Steve's room, for all of the city to see. Put on display like he was Steve's artwork, something to be admired from afar, but no touching. Not unless you were the artist. Not unless you were Steve.
The height is exhilarating for all of fifteen seconds before Tony starts to fall. His arms flail uselessly, clanking against the metal of the Mark I armor. The sky is tumbling past his vision, trading with yellow sand, flipping him again to see vast blue. It's disorienting. His last thought before he hits the ground is that, at the very least, he died taking out The Ten Rings. His sacrifice might mean hundreds of lives saved.
Thor nodded, swiveling his chair to face Natasha, "We just want to make music and enjoy our fans. Leave the rat race to the younger groups. It's just not our scene anymore."
Maria Hill shot her a look and sat. "When were you all going to inform SHIELD that Howard Stark had traveled through time?"
Was it just the reaction of his father that had sent him into this downward spiral? No, and Tony knew that. This was everything: Howard showing up, bickering with Steve, Howard's reaction to his relationship with Steve, the stress of the entire situation building and building and building. Tony not noticing that his mental state - the one he had worked so hard to improve after Afghanistan
Tony sighed, "I'm fine, really. This whole thing just had me all..." He wobbled in his seat to show his feelings, "discombobulated."
The old man kisses her hand. "Libby went to the market, Trudy, to pick up bird seed. Do you want to feed the ducks?"
Tony tilts his head in the direction of the elevator, signaling his workshop, "Had a breakthrough with Clint's arrows. You didn't answer my question."
"Can't, or won't?" Again, Steve looked away, this time out through the window. Howard stepped around the couch, blocking his sight. "I don't understand it, Steve, no more than I understand how I turn into a beast. But I
It didn't matter that three different Howards were warring within Steve, or that Tony was most likely feeling the same internal battle. They could weather this together. And though he missed Bucky tremendously and felt envy at seeing others with their best friends, he could take comfort that Tony could fill those missing pieces within him. Both best friend and lover, like a bonus.
Two shaking arms finally wound their way around Rhodey's chest, and Tony let his head fall to his best friend's shoulder. "I don't know what to do." The admission was quiet and unsure, and Rhodey felt his heart break a little. Tony never admitted to not knowing what to do in any situation. Most of the time, he made it up as he went along.
Steve didn't know what to say. He tilted Tony's head up and kissed him lightly, holding him for just a few moments until Tony's heart started to slow its rapid beating.
"It gets me closer to them. They're good people. But also, not working makes you stand out in a bad way." Satisfied that he is no longer sticky, Coulson returns to his seat across from Tony. "There is always a point where you meet and interact with your charges. It's usually as their purpose comes near, or if they just need a bit more of a hands-on approach. I've worked with Natasha and Clint for years." There is a pause, and Coulson gets a weird look on his face, his eyes sad, and his brows pinched. "Sometimes, you never get to meet them."
A Howard he had basically befriended the night before. Calling him Asshole in the kitchen that morning didn't even start to make up for it. That was another reason he called Rhodey. Because best friends fix everything, right? Rhodey could make Tony feel happier just by being there. He knew ways to distract Tony that Steve didn't. He knew how to fish through Tony's mind to aid him in organizing his thoughts. Rhodey had years of experience dealing with the bizarre mind of a genius, he knew the inner workings better than even Steve because he had been there when Tony grew from teenager into adult.
As soon as he caught his breath, he was grabbing for Tony, tugging him up to crash their mouths together, licking along the inside and tasting himself. "Your turn."
Steve felt his anger start to ebb away. How could he not when the sexiest man in the world was propositioning him? The sexist man in the world whom he loved with every ounce of his heart. "Shut up and just kiss me."
"Shit, I want you to fuck me so badly." He closed his eyes, picturing Steve above him as he teased his opening. "Fuck. I love you." And grappled for his phone, needing to read, to experience what he had wanted for so long.
The internet really was enlightening, but that meant he knew without a doubt that he was no longer around. That didn't mean he couldn't set plans into motion; Howard was never known to be a quitter. Number one being that as soon as he got back, he'd unfreeze Steve the second it was possible. That was in the original plan, but now it was imperative. He needed Steve as the catalyst. The impetus that would fix
"It's fine, don't worry," Steve was sounding more awake by the second. "DNA?" He paused, rolling the term over his tongue most likely, and trying to gauge just how much he knew about it. Bruce spared him the feeling of ignorance.
Bruce finally returned with Fury's drink, his hands shaking just a little as he handed over the tumbler. "You okay, Banner?" Fury took the glass, looking up at Bruce worriedly. "No code green?"
this. Let me ask you a question." She leaned toward him, eyebrows raised. "If you were given a chance to make amends with your brother, would you?"
He knew he was smart - he never stopped reminding them! And he knew he was gorgeous - Clint was deaf, not blind. But he honest to God didn't see his own measure as a friend or a person, as a man without genius or a snazzy wardrobe. He thought he had to be
Pepper Potts, the boys' long time friend and favorite composer and producer, hit the replay button, "Sounds good on my end, Bruce, but I'd like to see a bit less vibrato on that high E?"
"Steve," Tony was trying so hard to open up, so hard to let the words out. He had said as much to Natasha, to Thor, even a bit to Clint. Why was it so hard to say it Steve?
"You and I, we're meant." Steve sits up straight, but he doesn't take his eyes from Tony's. "Take a leap, Tony. Good night." And he's gone, slipping through the door as silently as entered.
"Yeah. Well, Tony doesn't. He's an idiot sometimes." Looking back at Steve, Clint asked, "Did you honestly think the FANS knew about the faulty lock on the staircase?" He was referring to a comment, left by Natashaboo, one of Steve's most avid readers and-
Tony is still clueless, but he does suspect someone in the tower. The wrong fucking person, of course! And Steve may start getting an idea that his star spangled ass has been found out.
say anything. "We already have the problem of Howard going back knowing too much and going back in general, because that's kinda important in case you guys missed the memo."
And what was not to love? Steve was kind, funny, smart, and gorgeous. He was perfect. What could he possibly see in someone like Tony?
To Bruce, he said he liked spanking. Not completely wrong, but it never made or broke sex for him. It was fun once in a while. And anyway, he needed something believable for him, Bruce knew the most about Tony.
"And what happened?" He remembered the first time he had met Howard. Tony was fifteen, top of the class - hell the whole college - excited and proud to show Howard what he had been working on. The entire time, Howard had looked annoyed, bored. It was an obligation to him, seeing his son in school, non-important, but quintessential to continue the facade of the loving tech family. He kept up appearances until they were behind closed doors. Until he thought they were alone. Rhodey had shifted on his feet in the bathroom, peering through the crack in the slightly ajar door. He didn't want to interrupt a private moment between Tony and his father because
He made quick work of his own clothes, the worn and home stitched trousers, his father's old dress shirt, and the heavily mended shoes, discarding everything until he was left in his union suit.
Leaning back onto the arm rest of the couch, Tony propped his feet on the cushions, opening his legs and readying himself. And he began to read again.
"Stop that!" With a squeak, Tony batted Steve's hand away and protectively placed his own over his rather ticklish tummy. Which was, of course, just one more thing to endear Steve to him. Who would guess that Tony Stark was ticklish?
Tony blinks at him. Did an angel just ask if he's read Harry Potter? What the actual fuck. "I'm a nerd at heart, of course I have."
It was tough to navigate sometimes, tough to reconcile everything that had happened. But then Steve would see Tony and Howard on the couch, locked in a furious chess match or arguing over a book they had read. Making silly jabs at each other, and throwing pillows.
Hill looks like she swallowed something foul, but Fury looks intrigued. "You may be onto something there, Phil. Hill," he turns to her, "come have a seat and tell us what you've got."
"Natasha needs to reassess the Texas date," Thor said as he took the sweet coffee from Steve's hands, "Thanks," he took a sip, "not sure the stage we want will be right for that venue."
Steve opened his mouth to answer, to rebuff what Bruce had said, but the blaring of the Avengers alarm cut through his thoughts. He stood up fast, turning a shocked expression on Bruce and Thor. "I-"
"Go ahead and hate me," Tony sneered, "but I'm exactly what everyone else wishes they could be but don't got the guts to do."
The room was quiet, like the breath before a storm, waiting for him to say the words most knew were there.
She snorted at that. "And Steve hasn't yet realized that we're all commenting on his stories and feeding his muse."
replied: WHAT ABOUT THE FOOD PLAY. STEVEN NEEDS TO GET ANTHONY TO EAT SO HE BRINGS HIM THE ICE CREAM.
Tony scoffed. "I'm not taking that bet." He paused. "Twenty that the nerdy one hacks into something governmental."
"Good morning," he finally looked up. "Mr. Stark, pleasure to meet you. You as well, Captain Rogers." They both shook his hand, somehow relieved that he didn't pretend to not know who they were. "So, it says here you've had some issues keeping food down, weight loss, diarrhea, constipation, migraines..." He gave a low whistle. "This is a lot, I'm sorry to hear this." Sitting on a stool he pulled from under the cabinets, he put the chart down. "You're very seriously underweight," he said to Tony.
Tony's face crumbled, and immediately Rhodey pulled him into his arms, cupping the back of his head and rubbing his back. Letting Tony cry, giving him something solid to hold on to while he let it all out. This wasn't just the breakup or the coming out. This wasn't even about the assemble call. This was everything, built up over the last -- was it nine? Ten days? -- it didn't matter how long at this point. Tony had reached his threshold. He was done. And Rhodey was content to hold his best friend and allow him to cry it out, however long he needed.
"Nat is in Austin on an assignment." Tony grumbled as Steve walked into the common kitchen. "Bruce is peacefully doing some peaceful peace thing, I think in North Dakota. Clint is in London, and Thor went shopping."
spell and told him she was pregnant, he would have dropped everything to care for her. The best doctors, the best midwife, whatever she wanted. He would have started to carve out a gigantic place for both of them in his life. Did the child want to go into scientific development like he did? Bam! Money aside for that. Was he more artistically inclined? Juilliard could use some renovations or a new building named after him. Law? Sure! A Stark as a lawyer would have been a formidable force in the courtroom. Hell, the unborn baby could have decided to be a garbage man, and Howard would have bought the entire company for him.
Steve had half a mind to gather them all up and burn them. Not a single one had anything right. And the one about it destroying the team? If anything, it had brought them closer together, rallying around Tony.
MountainKestral, LadyLanera, and WilmaKins are at the top of this list, as I couldn't have even attempted to complete this without their support, guidance, and love.
Sitting on the other side of Tony, Bruce gave a short chuckle, "That was all him," he pointed at the sleeping man, "I don't usually
By the time they returned to the tower, it was after midnight and Tony had fallen asleep in his seat. Bruce poked him. Clint shook him. Neither worked. He was out like a kid after a birthday party, and they couldn't blame him.
Morning brought sunshine and a pissed off Pepper Potts. She scurried around the bedroom, with no regard for the two sleeping men in the bed.
"Hey, Pep," Tony remarked after Thor left the room, "You ever work with a Natasha Romanoff before? Manager? Bit bossy?"
Tony opened himself up, exposing his hole, allowing what was basically a perfect stranger to see the most intimate part of him. It made Steve's heart surge. The vulnerability from one of the most feared--and apparently loved and respected--mafia bosses, the trust...it was breathtaking.
But Michael only laughs. "Cursing! Who came up with that one? Honestly, we tried to fix everything with the Book of Matthew. You know—Do unto others as you would have done unto yourself? But no one listens! Anthony," he says, sounding just a tad exasperated, but not with him, "it's all about the heart. Good people go to Heaven; bad people don't. And you are a good person. You had a lot of lessons to learn, and you did. Tell me, why did you die?"
Steve closed his eyes, his heart fit to burst. He hadn't dared let himself hope, but there Tony was, asking for the one thing Steve had refused to let himself think about.
"You're saying roll with it." It was the exact opposite of what Tony would have thought Fury would say, but in a twisted way, it made sense. The public already saw him; they already figured out who he was. If they wanted to keep the conspiracy theorists quiet, it was better to be honest. Time travel. From a spell in a book that there is only one of. People would try to find out what spell, and they would go after the book. That was the biggest concern, but honestly? Tony was all for destroying it.
Looking contemplative, Howard leaned his elbow on the back of the couch and rested his head on his hand. "But I was there. And though we -- uhh -- traveled differently, both of us ended up in the future."
He traded looks with Steve, almost pleading for his boyfriend to take over, but Steve just smiled gently and gestured for him to do it.
The unfairness of it hit Tony like a car splashing through the puddle at the corner across the street. Fast and hard, the water jetting up like a wave against a rock. He felt the realization tumble down his back, soaking him with the very thing he was vehemently against ever saying about himself.
"Sir, it is May 6th, 2008. It’s 67 degrees Fahrenheit, with an expected high of 73 degrees and a low of 61 degrees, here in Malibu, California. It's Tuesday, 7:13 in the morning. Last night, you fell asleep on the couch while listening to your new mentor, Philip Coulson. Which, might I add, is a startling revelation for me. Congratulations on your becoming an angel, though my condolences on your death."
as well. Tony likes to snack on it." Folding the menu back up, she gathered it with the others and placed them back into the drawer. "JARVIS, please place an order at Kiran Palace for everything we mentioned, including
That gave Howard reason to pause. And… what exactly? The best kind of people were nuts, weren't they? It was something he had prided
Before Bruce could speak another word, Steve was in between him and Howard, and the Other Guy was sitting back on his haunches in his mind, watching curiously. At least that was one crisis averted.
"We know," Steve interrupted, plucking a contract from the file in Tony's hands to look over, "KTU caters to an older crowd. We play the standards and pepper in one or two new songs, that's it."
Shaking his head, Tony strides forward and envelops him in his arms. "It's okay. I took them out. I took them all out! All the weapons...everything." Yinsen is hugging him back tightly, and his voice is warbly when he speaks again.
Steve took a minute to answer, gathering his thoughts and trying to place them in some sort of cohesive order. He sat back, scratching his shoulder, head tilted as he studied the man seated next to him. "I think-" he began slowly, "-that we all have that darkness inside of us. It's just we usually have enough good to balance it out. When you came forward in time, you took that balance away. So
"Killjoy. Are you coming back to New York soon?" He asked, bringing his knee up to brave against the back of the front passenger seat, "I'd like to see you for more than three minutes." He paused and made a face, trying to think of something coy and humorous to say to cover up his emotional slip, "no one makes my espresso like you do."
Tony had more patience with Steve than he had with anyone else, but he was still Tony Stark. He still wanted answers, but he
"I'm fucking adorable," Clint chuckled, handing the phone back. "Send me that, I'll add it to the wall." In his office in LA, Clint kept hundreds, possibly thousands of photos tacked up, a verifiable collection of their years together. Tony had tried to go through them. Once. He gave up ten minutes in.
"So what?" Steve snapped, "He's a jackass!" This was insane. No way could Tony's best friend be recommending this. Steve felt himself starting to boil. "He
And he was loathe to admit a begrudging respect beginning to boil up inside him for the half-Sicilian.
"So does Steve." It was said softly, gently, but with purpose. Understanding Tony was never easy, but sometimes he was so transparent; he would do anything to make Steve happy (including harming his own happiness, as he so perfectly demonstrated with breaking up with him), but that also extended to self-care. If Steve wanted him to eat, Tony would at least try. As far as Rhodey understood, anyway. He wasn't expecting much, maybe a few bites, but it was better than nothing, so he smiled encouragingly as Tony bit into the sandwich. "You always said Bruce got the cream cheese to jelly ratio just right."
"Okay, I accept your apology. I can't say I'm surprised someone finally hit him but..." Sighing, Tony threw his arms out helplessly. "But, Steve, he's my father."
"Have you realized that if you mention a kink suddenly it's in the next story?" Bruce said, ignoring what Tony was obviously doing. This was his best friend, and sometimes when it came to besties, you looked the other way.
But by the end, her glares have receded, and she steps up to Tony to shake his hand, giving him a tentative smile. "If Phil trusts you, that's good enough for me."
Sticking out his hand, Tony thanked Fury, "Keep me updated and let me know if you need any help getting things situated."
"Just-" Steve pulled out, leaving the tip inside Tony's rim, "-like this." With a grunt, he slammed back in, and Tony's toes curled, his head falling back, hitting the back of the chair hard.
"Did you like it?" she asks, her hand twitching to move again. She stills it in her lap. "Being called that?"
