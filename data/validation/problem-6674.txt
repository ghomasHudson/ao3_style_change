Bucky cleared his throat and Steve thought he could hear him blow his nose. "My mom already called and asked the camp directors. They said if you don't show up on the first day of the whole thing, you couldn't come at all. I don't know, some stupid policy or something. So she could only ask for a refund and that was that. Sorry pal, you'll have to go alone."
“So, are you a student too?” He eventually said and turned to look at her. She had taken out her phone and started play around with it, before looking up and smiling at him.
“Perhaps it isn’t any machinery? It looks more like one of the strange artistic exhibitions at the museum we traveled to a few months back.” Tony snorted and ran his hand over the dome. Bruce looked over at the other guys, then back at Steve and Natasha before taking a breath and walking away a few steps to get some distance.
Tony sniffed and nuzzled his face into Steve’s shirt, wiping tears and snot on the fabric and finding himself unable to care in the slightest. “I’m not letting you leave again. You’re not gonna go anywhere near that shit again, you’re gonna stay right here with me forever from now on, do you hear me? That’s not a suggestion, it’s an order Soldier.”
Steve was sitting alone at his and Bucky’s usual table and sketching while slowly eating his lunch, letting the sounds of the cafeteria fade away around him. Which was not the easiest thing to do, but he’d had years of practice drowning out noise of other kids and classmates.
Steve looked at his phone and sighed. “And our driver has been missing for almost five and a half hours now too. Something is very wrong about all of this.” Tony, who’d taken another crack at fixing the engine, rolled his eyes and stared him incredulously from the hood of the car.
Bucky groaned into the phone, somehow both apologetic and annoyed at the same time. "I'm sorry Stevie, but I can't. My flu has gotten way worse and I can't come with so mom cancelled the whole thing."
Steve just shrugged and smirked. “Not my fault if you’re bad at board games, guys. You play it to win it.” Sam laughed and he could practically hear Natasha smirk and roll her eyes, which really goes to show how long he’s known her that he knows how she reacts without even seeing her.
He was greeted with a candlelight room and the smell of carbonara filled his nostrils, Tony’s favorite dish. The table was set, candles were light, a bottle of wine along with wine glasses were placed on the table, along with a big bowl of salad and some garlic bread. Fresh out of the oven too, if the smell was any indication.
Tony came running up to him a few seconds later, soaking wet with his normally well styled, coiffed hair hanging in wet strands in his face and the jacket Steve had lent him dripping with water. He glared half-heartedly at him and flicked some of the rainwater into Steve’s eyes.
Then of course was the time he had proposed to Steve, with a ring he had made with materials from his armor and Steve’s shield. The 100$ had gone to the food and drinks for celebration.
He smiled a bit wider and pressed a kiss to his throat, nuzzling his nose against his skin. “Steve, I’ve been a hot mess for years. All the shit that Howard has put me through, the shit he said and did to me, the bad experiences I’ve had with bad guys and nasty girls… I don’t want to think about I’d be like if it without you. You’ve pulled me out of so many bad situations and helped me through so many dark points in my life that I’m not sure I’d still be alive today if it weren’t for you.”
Toni stared back at him, her eyes wide open and mouth opened slightly. Was he being serious? Of course he was, he was close to tears right now, but how could someone like Steve exist? He was so genuine and honest and sweet, he had be some kind of pipe dream she'd made up in the fantasies.
He turned to look over his shoulder and saw Johann Schmidt with Brock Rumlow on his right, like some kind of right hand man or something.
Also, there are references for how my machines look at the bottom, just in case you’re confused by my terrible descriptions.
Really? He thought she was amazing? He thought she was- No! No, bad Toni! Not the time to be flattered over simple compliments.
Tony grumbled and rubbed his eyes before stretching out his arms towards Steve like a child. “Carry me.” He whined, again, very much like a child.
But the best part of this new future was without a doubt his new friends and this kooky, slightly dysfunctional little family they had built together since the Battle of New York. And sure, they had been awkward around each other at first, even after Tony had generously opened up his home to them all with suits made to suit them all individually and doing all he could to make them feel at home. It had taken time for them all to feel comfortable around each other, to feel like friends more than a group of very different and strong-willed people forced to work together. But, against all odds it seemed, they’d eventually managed to make a connection and become a team. And Steve was really thankful that they were now seeing him less like Captain America; Legendary Hero and American Symbol, and more like Steve Rogers, the kid from Brooklyn who liked to try new foods, movies and books, had a dry sense of humor and wasn’t anywhere as sensitive and delicate concerning homosexuality or feminism or other such political subjects that seemed taboo these days.
“Look, whatever is going on out there, I don’t think it’s smart to be out there while it’s happening! It’s probably smarter to stay in here until it’s over!” Clint just smirked over at her, even if it was very strained now with worry and fear.
Toni sighed and took out her phone. She wouldn't get anywhere going back and forth with herself like this. She needed advice. She called Janet, just like she had done after that first day after meeting Steve.
"She and I are from entirely different worlds, she can have anything and anyone she wants! And I have nothing and I'll probably not have much in the future either. I have-" Steve cut himself, almost fighting back tears at this point. "I have nothing to offer her. What business do I have around someone like her?"
, asked Tony to marry him and Tony had said yes, everything had felt so wonderful and nothing had been able to bring him down.
"You know I'm in your corner whatever you choose to do, Tones. But whatever you choose, I want you to know that you deserve to find love just as much as anyone else in the world."
She was pushed down on a chair and Janet immediately got to work. Though she didn’t do much aside from putting some rouge on her cheeks, highlighted her eyebrows and put some red lipstick on her lips and mascara on her eyelashes she still took her sweet time to get it done. She also grabbed a brush and started to brush through her hair and curling it lightly.
Still, the fact that Tony had turned out as amazing, selfless and kind as he had in face of all the emotional, verbal and even physical abuse that Howard had put him through over the years still amazed Steve, and he was very happy to see how much better Tony was doing ever since he’d moved out of his parents’ place and moved in with him. Sure, he’d had to work through a lot of issues and still had trouble with some things, but he was doing so much better now. He was smiling every day, making jokes constantly and his confidence and ambitions felt so much more genuine now than it ever had when they were kids and he’d talked about taking over Stark Industries and building weapons just like his dad. It felt like watching a bird finally being let out of its cage and being allowed to try out its wings and learn to fly and Steve was so happy and proud of his fiancé.
"Y-You… you mean it?" Steve croaked out, sounding about his disbelieving as Toni was about her own line of thinking at the moment, but he sounded so sweet and so incredibly hopeful that she couldn't do anything else but grab his hand tighter and smile wider at him.
Toni had started to come to the Starbucks regularly whenever Steve was working a shift and they could talk for hours, with Steve having to break away from her every now and then to tend to costumers. And with time they started to meet up at MIT, seeing each other in corridors or at meeting in the library and starting studying together on certain days. Well, Steve studied and Toni would distract him with unending chatter, either about classes or stupid classmates or professors or whatever crossed her mind. And as much as Steve acted like he was annoyed at her talking, he secretly loved it. Especially when she talked about her projects or ideas for projects. She was just so excited and happy and full of passion about it that it was hard not to get swept up in her enthusiasm.
"So… then, would you-" Toni leaned in a little closer, waiting for him to just ask her already before her scared, lizard brain would catch up with her and make her run away from him before he could say it.
“It’s the future.” He’d told Steve when he explained his vision to him. “Once Stark Solutions gets off the ground and I get the funding I need, believe you me, I will make sure that fossil fuel will be a thing of the past.” And Steve, of course, had been quick to show his full support and hugged and kissed him all while asking if there was anything he could do to help.
"What?! But mom, you know I don't like outside stuff! I wouldn't have any fun being there, you have realize that!" Dad rolled his eyes with a loud and disapproving scoff, turning away from them and folding his arms over his chest. Mom sat down beside him and gently stroke his hair out of his face.
"I highly doubt that, Clint. Archery isn't really a thing most kids are into, but you can always hope I guess." She brushed a strand of red hair out of her face without even blinking or looking away from her nails and moved on to the next hand.
Jan smiled so widely that her face almost split in two and her eyes sparkled. “Oh my gosh, Toni you asked him out! You! That is so amazing, I’m so proud of you!” She flung herself and Toni and wrapped her arms around her arms around her neck, squeezing tightly. “You
But, as time went on and they got to know each other better, he started to see Tony, rather than Tony Stark. The Tony who was caring and loyal and generous, just as he was infuriating and obnoxious and an asshole. Who had kept everyone at arm’s length for weeks and had taken a bit of coaxing to bring out of his shell, but tried so hard to hide that he was nervous or unsure around them all. Who tried so hard to hide that was caring and generous and kept up a façade of unlikable, narcissistic asshole who wasn’t a team player, despite ample evidence to the contrary.
“Yeah. We have the same dad and we’ve lived together since we were kids. She’s had my back since as forever.” He looked over at Bruce and smiled. “And you are?” Bruce smiled, a bit awkwardly and reached out his hand.
Tony sighed and flopped down on the bed, placing an arm over his eyes. "I won't survive this, Jarvis! A whole ten weeks without my workshop or any Internet or anything I like! This summer will be my undoing, just wait and see."
“Hey, it’s cool. I’m alright, no harm done. And I would say it wasn’t so terrible, ‘cause now I’m talking to you, Handsome.”
Tony had gone to his and Steve’s room first, to change out of his suit and into his comfortable jeans and t-shirt before heading into the kitchen to see what was on the menu for the evening. But only seconds after having exited the elevator and before he could head towards the kitchen, he was greeted by Steve, who smiled widely when he saw him and immediately welcomed him home with a soft kiss.
In hindsight, Tony guesses it was just his luck that something like this happened on the first day of his vacation. He’d have such rotten luck since, well
“Oh, I have the perfect thing for that! I’ve been dying to see this with you; it’s the best of the worst! You ever heard of The Room? Of course you have, everybody has! Anyway, I have never actually seen it, only a clip here or there, but it’s one of the worst movies of all time and also super funny-“
He groaned and rested his forehead against the steering wheel. He wasn’t doing a very good jump pumping himself up for his final day of sophomore year, but he also knew he could stay in in car forever, so just grabbed his bag and got out of the car.
Natasha would probably already be waiting by his locker when he got there. She always managed to beat him in most things, despite his best efforts to try and beat her in something. Sure, he had better aim than her and always beat her in games or tasks that required good aim, but that was mostly it. Still, she was his sister in everything but blood and so it was her job to drive him crazy and yet somehow he would love her at the end of the day.
Steve blushed a little at the sound and chuckled embarrassedly and Tony laughed at him. "I'll take that as a yes." He gave his husband another squeeze before he made his way towards the fridge. "Bruce made this Indian curry last night, it's to die for. We have plenty of leftovers though, 'cause Thor was called away for something last minute before dinner. You want some?"
“Oh! Oh my god, I am so, so sorry for that! Gosh, I’m such a klutz, really, I can’t go anywhere without making a mess of things.” Bruce looked up and saw Tony stand there, his face looking shocked and worried but it was very obviously fake, and his voice matched it very well.
“Yeah…” Then he looked over at Bruce. “What do you think Bruce? You have to see how this could be really dangerous, right?” Bruce drew back a little when he was spoken too and immediately tried to make himself look smaller, just like he always did. He took a deep breath and tried to make sense of his thoughts.
Tony shook his head with a small laugh before letting himself relax and rest against Steve’s body, pressing his lips to his neck. He suddenly felt drained of all energy after all the emotion that he’d gone through just now and was now more than okay with Steve carrying him out of the airport and to the car so they could go home.
Bucky smirked at him and finished his coffee, placing it loudly on the counter to wake him up from his daze. “Well, looks like you’ve got yourself an admirer, Stevie.” He waved the mug at him. “Refill?”
Steve kept his arm around Tony, now resting around his waist and he kept him close, ready to hug him again if he needed it. “You feeling better?” He asked softly and Tony nodded, but he didn’t say anything. He breathed through his nose and kept his mouth shut long enough for Steve to worry about it, but after a few minutes of silence he looked up at Steve and his big, wide and wet puppy eyes made Steve’s heart ache.
He sighed and put his sketchbook and pencils into his backpack and got back to his lunch, eating as fast as he could so he could leave soon.
“I was doing just fine, until you showed up uninvited. Now kindly fuck off.” He turned back to his lunch and sketchbook, when it was suddenly yanked from the table and Rumlow went through the pages with a big smirk on his face.
They both laughed at their corny flirting and bizarre the whole thing had been, then the guy reached a hand for Tony to shake with a more comfortable smile.
“He is into weapons manufacturing. He then he figured that business would be better here in the United States and we moved here. We have lived here for almost a year now.” Tony sat up straighter and smirked at Thor.
Toni Stark was a whirlwind, an adorable spitfire and she had taken his heart hostage from the first day he'd seen her.
“Oh Jesus, Steve you really gotta work on your flirting.” The Adonis- or Steve- blushed even more and glared over at his friend, but Tony just smirked and took a step forward as well, shrugging off his wet, thin jacket, showing off his own well-defined arms and tan. And his smirk widened slightly when he saw how Steve’s gaze was suddenly drawn away from the best friend and was now directed at his body. Though the blush was still there.
The driver honked her horn, glaring at him through the window. “Hey, you comin’ with or what?” Bruce started to nod and dumped his bag in the trunk, opened the door to the backseat and squeezed in between Tony and the other blonde guy, who seemed to look revealed to have Bruce between him and Tony.
“Yes. Yes I am. Do you have a problem with that, Rogers?” Steve sighed and shook his head, partly amused and partly annoyed. While he loved Tony very much and would do just about everything for him, he did
“Yeah, great driving skills you got there, Stark.” She pulled the hair tie out of her hair and let her long red locks fall over her shoulders and back, rolling her eyes as she combed through her hair with her fingers. “Guys behind the wheel…”
“Stark, anytime now!” Tony placed both hands around the stick and tugged, when Clint suddenly found a button on the joystick’s side and pushed it to the right, and suddenly the ship jerked wildly to the left and they all fell the floor around the control panel but that asteroid thankfully did not hit the ship. The alarms became silent, the lights came back on and the ship kept flying forward like nothing had happened.
Clint looked after him, then at the others, shrugged and smirked at them. “Yeah, I’m gonna go with him. And he’s right.” He eyed Natasha and Steve with a dry look on his face. “If you killjoys want to stand here and take the fun out of everything, then feel free to.” He then turned and hurried after Tony. “Hey Stark, wait for me! Don’t find anything fun without me!”
Thor tried to take a few deep breaths to calm his anger. It would do him no good to loose his composure and hit Loki; it would only make his father even angrier. Maybe he would even be forced to leave his phone in the house, or maybe take away his money or something equally terrible.
“Okay, so if choice is between lame or awesome, I’ll always choose awesome! And if I can get even the smallest chance to see actual, real-life aliens in my life on this trip, you can bet your ass that I’ll take it!” And he pressed the green button before going over to Tony, who raised his fist for him to bump.
“Ooh, we’re using surnames now, huh? Gosh Mr. Stark, you sure know how to make a fella feel special.” Steve barely holds back his laugh as he walks up the stairs, not in any hurry at all, and heads towards their bedroom, holding Tony in place over his shoulder with one arm around the back of his knees.
“Well, what exactly are we supposed to do then, Rogers? Just stand around here and wait for someone to hopefully come and maybe tell us what’s going on?” He snorted. “No way. You do that if you want, but I wanna see where the hell we are. Hopefully we can find a way out of here.” And so he walked out, followed by Clint and Thor and eventually the others also started to slowly get out of the small little box, the doors slowly closing behind them. But the kids’ barley noticed that as they took in the room they had walked into.
Steve was walking around the car in circles before he started to walk over to the side of the car, leaned back against it and sighed, either out of frustration or tiredness, and tilted his head towards the sun. Thor and Clint had started to throw rocks at certain targets, Thor getting both very impressed and annoyed that Clint kept beating him and Natasha was fiddling with her phone, before placing it to her ear, held it there for a few seconds before groaning and putting it down again.
And Tony turned out to be right, because after an hour and half she had still not come back and they were still waiting. Tony had taken Thor’s place and was now playing an impromptu game of darts, with small rocks and a few branches instead of actual darts or circles on a round board. Steve had started sketch again, sitting leaned back against a tree with a pair of headphones over his ears. Natasha was looking through a book and Thor was doing pull-ups on a thick and sturdy branch.
actually want to go here, either? What was that about it being a ‘nice gesture from a nice parent?’” Steve glared at him but quickly went back to his sketchbook without saying anything else.
Steve’s eyes were overfilled with tears at this point and Tony pressed a kiss on his nose, leaning in close to his ear. “Now, let’s go home. We’ll pick up pizza on the way home.” He slowly started to pull away, but Steve grabbed his hand before he got too far away.
Natasha and Steve in particular had become really close. Natasha still had moments of acting cold, to all of them besides Clint really, but they both found things to bond over, as they both felt a little isolated in the world due to their pasts, and while she obviously knew more about the 21
“Oh, so your dad is the CEO for Odinson’s Solutions? My dad has talked about that before, he says they’re one of the few big companies that pose any threat to Stark Industries.” Thor smirked back at him and nodded, but before he could say anything, a loud BANG was heard and the driver cursed as she slowed down and pulled over by the road.
Toni rolled her eyes only slightly insulted. “Jan, I can actually do my makeup without looking like a clown by the end of it, you know that right?” Janet rolled her eyes back at her and then pushed her towards the door.
Natasha’s lip quirked slightly and she got up from the bed and sat down beside Clint, wrapping her arm around his shoulders. “Hey Clint, I know it’s not what any of us wanted, but at least no one there will know who we are, right? You might make some friends there who won’t constantly call you a circus freak or whatever.” He looked at her, his eyebrow raised and head tilted.
And now, the following day, he was just going through his back one last time to make sure he hadn’t forgotten or missed anything, before finally deciding he was done and going down the stairs and into the kitchen, where his dad was sitting with a bottle of beer and looking down at a newspaper.
Tony was too surprised to react when Steve first grabbed him, but when his brain caught up with what was going around him, he started to kick and squirm and push his hands against Steve’s back to try and squirm out of his grip.
Thor smiled widely at her, as if her serious tone hadn’t faced him at all. “And we will have contact with our loved ones here as well.” He gestured at the small devices on the podium with his arm. “With these we will be able to contact our friends and family just as simply as on camp.”
“Well, yeah, maybe a little. I can’t deny that maybe this could be dangerous or whatever, but still it’s a fucking space adventure! Who in their right mind would say no to that?” Tony nodded and placed his hands on his hips.
“Nice moves, Barton!” Bruce leaned most of his weight on the control panel, looking with wide-open eyes and his glasses hanging from one ear.
Tony was standing in front of the couch where Steve sat with a brown and white puppy in his arms. It was a rather big puppy, maybe around a year old, tongue hanging out of its open mouth and big brown eyes.
He trailed off, biting his lip and closed his eyes, taking a few breaths through his nose, held them for a second before letting out through his mouth. Steve didn’t push him, just waited for Tony to pull himself together enough to continue. Eventually he opened his eyes again, but still refused to look at Steve.
Tears were falling from Tony’s eyes by this point and he was just barely holding back his sobs and his smile was so big it physically hurt. He sniffed and tried to snark back at Steve but it didn’t come out quite as snarky as he had wanted and more like a sob.
Toni sighed again and gripped Janet's hand back. "I don't know if I can. I’m not like you Jan, nice guys don't exist for me, you know that. They always act like they are at first, only to stab me in the back when they’ve gotten what they want. It always happens. I can't put myself through that again, especially not after-" Her voice broke and she had clear and blink hard to keep back the tears. "After Ty."
She hadn’t done it to defend him, he knew that much. Natasha was never nice to anyone except for brother, and she was just annoyed with them blocking the way into school, that was all. He knew better than to fool himself into believing that there was someone in this school that cared about him, aside from Rhodey and Pepper.
sick of watching you drool over the counter every time she comes in here, just put me out of my misery and
He’d heard it all, ever since fifth grade the rumors had been running wild and they had gotten more and more hurtful and terrible with every year.
“-No, I have no intention of- look, it’s none of your goddamn business anymore, you cut me off! And I am
“That thing! It’s probably how you steer the ship, with that! Pull on it!” Tony was tugging on the joystick in every direction possible and his eyes flickered over from the asteroid right outside the window and then back to the stick.
“Nah, I just like walking into coffee shops and sit down by the counter just because.” Her smirk widened. “I’m kinda quirky like that.”
Steve continued with a soft smile, but he also looked… well, kinda emotional. He let go of Tony’s face and took his hands, holding them tightly. “Tony, you know I mean it, right? I adore you, Tony. I love everything about you and don’t ever want us to be apart for this long ever again.”
“Well, I’m fairly certain this isn’t supposed to be here.” He held something in his hands that looked like the remains from a few taped together firecrackers in a small, plastic container. “Looks like someone was trying to be funny.” She grabbed the container and looked it over, before swearing and throwing to the ground.
The waiting had already been unbearable ever since Steve had left for 10 months; he had to make it worse by being late? And it wouldn’t be so bad if he was only a few minutes late, like ten minutes or so, and that was including the time it took to get off the plane, get through the arrival terminal and getting his bags. But he was almost thirty-seven minutes late by now and Tony was really getting antsier by the minute.
Thor went through his closet for good camp clothes as he heard Loki laugh at him from the bedroom door. “Well brother, it looks like you will have to spend your summer alone, far away from our parents and me. How tragic.”
“What are you doing?” He looked over his shoulder at her for one second before looking back at the computer screen, frantically tapping at the keyboard.
Tony stared up at him incredulously for almost a full minute before he narrowed his eyes at him. “Seriously? You go out of your way to turn me on just to slam the door in my face?” Steve just looked at him wide eyes and quickly got rid off his own pants and shoes.
“Well, next time they want to do something for you or whatever maybe you should tell them what you want instead of just forcing you to do whatever they think you want to do.” The blonde next to them both half-glared at Tony and rolled his eyes with disgust.
Steve swallowed loudly and only managed to squeak out a, “Oh my god…” and Tony shrugged while trying to sound as cocky and cool as always but sounded just as blown away as the rest of them.
“Nah, I think you’re done for the day.” Tony growled angrily and refused to stop kicking or squirming or writhing in Steve’s grip, though it proved to be a very fruitless struggle. To Steve it was like carrying a bag of laundry over his shoulder, except he had to tilt his head slightly to side every now and then to avoid Tony's attempts at kicking him in the face. Whether it would be intentional or not was hard to tell, it was always hard to tell with Tony.
Steve turned to salute her but didn’t stop walking. “Don’t worry Nat, I’ll make sure he gets a long night’s rest.” He smirked mischievously and smacked Tony on the butt, making Tony yelp in surprise and outrage. Clint groaned and covered his eyes with one hand.
Blinking away the tears that were forming in his eyes, Tony swallowed down a soft sob and buried his face in the crook of Steve’s neck and tried to cover it up with a laugh. “You are such a sap, Rogers. Why have I put up with your and your sap for all these years?”
coming with?" Steve had to fight really hard so he wouldn't yell into the phone, suddenly feeling nervous and scared. He and Bucky had more or less been goaded into going to camp together by their mothers and they had eventually caved, albeit under protest and had been prepared to find ways to tough through it together however they could. And now Bucky was calling and saying he wasn't going to go at all? What the hell!
She raised an eyebrow at him. “And yet you felt the need to decide for me who is good enough for me? Like that choice isn’t up to me? Bruce Banner is a genius and going to change the world some day. Reed Richards is a genius and will be rich and famous one day. Justin Hammer is from a rich and somewhat powerful family. Do you see me hanging around them and trying to get dates out of them?”
your fault. He has a grip on you mentally and psychologically, and after what he did to you, it makes complete sense that you’d still be wary of him. He didn’t listen when you dismissed him, and that is not your fault. It’s
"Well, what did you think?" Tony tried for a smile, but it probably just ended up looking very awkward and he put the tablet back down on the table.
“Yeah, exactly like that.” Then his smile turned even more mischievous. “Speaking of coffee…” Then he ripped himself out of Steve’s hold on him and ran out into the rain and down the path towards the coffeehouse. The rain and wind was pretty loud, so it was probably only because Steve’s super hearing that he heard Tony yelling, “Last one there pays!”
“Y-You… you mean it?” He eventually managed to croak out; sounding much more like a frog than a human, but she just smiled and held his hand tighter.
“Close what, friends? Well yeah, we have known each other since grade school, so I guess that makes sense.” Ty smirked evilly and leaned over him, making Tony very aware of the very clear size difference between them. Not that Tony was short exactly; he was around average for a sixteen year old, standing at 5 foot 7 inches. But Ty was a football player, was almost 6 feet tall and he was more than twice as wide and big as him since Tony, despite all of his attempts at working out and doing of lot of work with machines and engines, had failed to get any visible muscles.
His friends, to their credit, tried their best to help him when he had these days. Natasha and Bruce had been very vocal about him talking to a doctor and maybe getting some anti-depressants or other medication or help to deal with these thoughts better, and Clint and Thor tried their best to pull him out of his funks by trying to include him in fun games or activities, like playing video games, watch movies or try to play games with the whole team. And while Steve appreciated their attempts and intentions, he usually just wanted to be left alone one days like these, and sometime the team just didn’t seem or want to understand.
He just ended up looking a like a stereotypical nerd with expensive, fancy clothes and slightly better looks than most other nerds, most of the time.
He smiled sheepishly and rubbed his hand on the back of his neck, a soft red blush coloring his cheeks. “Uh, I… no. No I didn’t, I took French. I don’t really know that much Italian.”
It wasn’t that Steve didn’t like getting presents, but it had always been rare for him to actually get something when he was young due to being poor and starving and all money he and his mother got needed to go to necessities rather than personal things. Bucky was the only one he got gifts from, but he wasn’t exactly rich either so it was never anything fancy. And so, suddenly receiving not only many gifts, but also very expensive gifts from friends and newfound family made him rather uncomfortable. And even as the Avengers became more family than friends, he still preferred to keep the rule in place and was fine with receiving books or art supplies or clothes, since one of the few things Tony and Natasha agreed wholeheartedly on was that Steve had a dreadful sense of fashion.
He coughed again and cleared his throat before he finally started to talk. “You’re… you’re American.” It sounded more like a statement than a question, which was what he had intended it to be, but the Adonis seemed more surprised by the fact that Tony did in fact speak English and what he said than how he said it, so it didn’t bother him too much.
Steve growled and tried to rip himself free out of Rumlow’s grip. Yes, he had drawn Natasha Romanov while she was studying in the library. No, he did not have a crush on her. Yes, she was pretty and was nice to look at. No, he did not have any lustful or romantic feelings towards her. He drew a lot of people while in school, in as much detail as he could, it didn’t mean anything. Not that Schmidt would listen if he tried to say that, but still.
Ty smirked at him. “Well, if you’d like me to help you feel better before you leave, you only need to ask.” He leaned in closer to his face, a predatory smirk spreading over whole face. “After all, we all know how much you like it.”
“Hi puppy. Hi buddy, hi.” Tony smiled and placed the dog down on Steve’s lap, and it immediately got up in Steve’s face and licked him in the face, the neck and everywhere it could reach, with the bushy tail wagging back and forth, making it almost look like a propeller.
Steve jerked forward and barked, “Hey! Don’t touch anything if you don’t know what it is!” Tony rolled his eyes but didn’t look away.
century than him, they could sit and talk about books, movies, pop culture, history, politics and other subjects that helped Steve learn more about this new world.
His mother had always adored Tony, ever since she’d first met him when Steve had come running up to her after that first day of kindergarten with a big, happy grin on his face as he introduced his new friend Tony to her and asked if he could come home with him tomorrow. And so when he’d told her that he wanted to ask him to marry him, she’d been over the moon and very quick to give him her ring and tell him to make him happy and treat him well. Which was more a thing of courtesy than anything else, because the idea of hurting Tony in any way made Steve’s skin crawl and feel like he’d been punched in the stomach.
“Hi sweetheart. You done everything that needed to be done?” Tony nodded and took a sip off his coffee. They’d always made a point to split the chores evenly, depending on time, income and other factors. And despite how Tony had never needed to lift a finger as far as chores went when he was a kid and had to be taught how to clean and do the dishes once he and Steve had moved in together after they’d moved to Boston for college, he’d always made sure to pull his own weight. Especially since he had a slightly higher income than Steve at the moment.
gonna be living here for the summer, might as well get a closer look at everything around here. You sourpusses can sit there and grumble all you want if you feel like it.” Then he turned away and started to inspect everything he passed curiously while also trying to keep his itching fingers in check.
Steve was pretty sure Justin wet his pants before he finally turned tail and booked it out of there like a dog with its tail between his legs.
Clint always loved watching Natasha do these things, ‘cause it looked so funny. Like, Natasha wasn’t that tall or muscular, maybe 5 foot 7 inches and 130 pounds, and Rumlow both taller and heavier than her. And yet he looked at her and looked absolutely terrified.
They weren’t friends exactly, but they did greet each other every now and then when they passed each other in the hallways. But other than that, Bruce was alone for the most part and usually spent all his time away from classes in the library to hide from bullies or jerks or assholes?
He had never liked the man, even as a child and his terrible behavior, drinking and child abuse flew way over his head. Back then he had just thought he was mean and a jerk, but it rarely bothered him too much since he and Tony spent most of their time and his house rather than Tony’s. But as he got older he realized more and more just how terrible Howard was and started to outright hate the man’s guts and made no secret to Tony or any of their friends what he thought of him. And Howard had never liked him either, both because he was
Tony looked away, looking very ashamed and guilty. “I just… I feel like I’ve cheated on you.” He whispered the words, so quietly that if Steve hadn’t had his enhanced hearing he probably wouldn’t have heard it. But he did, and he immediately kissed Tony again, on the forehead, then the nose and then his mouth.
“What? What did you say, babe?” Tony smiled weakly and looked up at him with a few small tears in his big eyes.
He held up both hands and weighing them up and down, like the different sides of a scale. “Space adventure or summer camp?” He grimaced a little at them and moved his hands up and down. “I think space wins out in that question. At least for me.” He then glared over at Steve, who was still standing over by the podium with Natasha and Bruce. “Though it’d be better if Captain Stick-Up-His-Ass could be dropped back on Earth so the rest of us wouldn’t have to suffer his bitching. Seriously, what’s his problem?” Clint snorted and shook his head.
Bruce left science class and tried to keep his head down and make himself as small as he could, clutching his books tightly to his chest. So far, so good. He’d managed to get between his first few classes without any real trouble or bumping into any assholes.
But most of the room was empty, aside from one end that was taken up by a giant closed window and a big control panel, along with six chairs in front of it. There were actually a couple of windows here and there in the room, but they were all covered so when Natasha tried to look outside and to see where they were, she couldn’t see anything aside from metal.
The only one who had any real reason to be at those galas or events would be Steve. As Tony’s husband, it only made sense that he would accompany him to these things, to support him and help promote good press for the company. And while Steve had made no secret to either Tony or Pepper that he hated dressing up and entertaining these kinds of people- reminded him way too much of time promoting war bonds with the USO- he would gladly put up with it to support his husband and to just see how happy Tony got when got to talk about his projects to the world. Steve had told Tony over and over that he hated his PR smile, but he loved it when Tony could just talk about his work, because that passion always managed to shine through and it was a joy to see, even if he was forced to suffer through stiff greetings and small talk with people he couldn’t bother remembering the names or after they left for the night and to wear those tight, uncomfortable suits. All to make Tony happy and to see that bright smile when he took the stage and talked about the things he really cared about.
Toni smiled sweetly at him, her big brown eyes bright and full of emotion. “I would love to, Steve. How about we meet up here, maybe around 7pm?” Steve was so overwhelmed by finally asking her out and her answer that he couldn’t do more than nod and say, “Sure, I’ll be there.”
“Ah, don’t feel too bad about this situation, brother. I am sure you can find adventures on the camp too. Perhaps you will be able to catch a wild boar, or win the grand battles of Capture The Flag.” He laughed and then left, leaving Thor only barely holding his anger back and slamming the door shut behind him.
The car seemed to stand in some kind of room, not very big or tall, and made out of some kind of metal. It looked almost like a big box of something. She turned to look at the others and gently shook Clint, who was sitting with his fingers in his ears and eyes shut tight, to snap him out of it while looking around at the others.
“It’s the last day of school. What homework would you need to turn in?” Blonsky narrowed his eyes and took a step forward, trying to corner him against a wall.
“Yes, yes, sleep and food is important, I get it but I-“ He got cut off by a yawn that threatened to break his jaw, and his eyes drooped slightly. Still, Tony was nothing if not stubborn, so he turned to Steve and poked a finger at his chest. “That meant nothing.”
Or how Natasha’s parents had been assassins and trained her to be one before they were killed when she was very young and she had- somehow- made her way to America on her own as an illegal immigrant before also being put in the same orphanage as Clint and they got adopted at the same time. Or how, because she was a Russian, she had filled her locker with weapons, threatened people with violence when they annoyed her and that she was drinking vodka from water bottles during class or lunch.
“I am merely saying that I feel pity for you. To spend the whole summer far away from here, in some stuffy forest alone with no friends or Internet or anything else that you might enjoy. Poor Thor, no friends and no fun things to do for two and a half months.”
He smirked and leaned in closer, till he was inches away from his face and whispered into his ear. “You don’t belong here, Rogers. You should go back to Brooklyn and stay with your kind of people; poor and mediocre. You’re
“Don’t think you can fool us, you little bitch! Everyone in this school knows the truth; that you’re nothing but a trashy, dirty little slut who acts like he’s better than every one. But we know that you’re just a poser, and you’re dad’s company is gonna tank the second you take over. If he ever lets you run it, that is.”
“Okay look, I get you being all self-conscious and all, with her being the first girl who’s given you the time of day or whatever, but I’m telling you, if you ask her on a date she’ll say yes! She likes you, I can tell. You gotta take a chance already.”
Steve laughed softly and squeezed Tony’s wrists, blinking away the remaining tears from his eyes. “No, no, they do. I guess I’ve just been busy thinking about other stuff to bother with things like shaving.”
“I’m serious, Pierce, get lost or you get the taser!” Thor decided that he needed to interfere and moved up to his girlfriend’s side, putting his arm around her.
Natasha looked up from her nails; eyebrow raised in slight curiosity and put down her nail polish. “Well, this oughta be good.” Thor and Hulk also looked away from the TV and Clint stopped mid-throw with the dart still in his hand.
? But why was he so worked up about that? Toni had never cared about money or status or whatever, so why the fuck would she care if Steve was a bit poor or wouldn't become a great genius or whatever when they graduated college or ten years from today?
The dinner was great, which Tony made sure to say several times to make sure Steve actually knew that Tony liked his cooking and wasn’t just saying it to be nice. And the bastard had even gotten dessert; so when the dinner was finally over and done, Tony was quite certain that his stomach was gonna burst. Still, when Steve got to his feet and started to clean up and do the dishes, Tony got up to help, despite how tired and full he felt. Steve insisted that he could do it himself, but Tony insisted right back that he could help. Might help him digest a little faster too.
“This is perfect! Simple but beautiful, and you totally suit in red, Toni! Add some silver earrings, maybe some light makeup and it’ll be perfect for a first date. You’ll be absolutely beautiful in this, how come you’ve never worn this before?” Toni got off the bed and walked up to her, fingering on the soft fabric and looked it over. She didn’t remember buying this dress or even getting it as a gift, but it was probably a gift from her mother or maybe some other friend had gotten it for her as a birthday gift or something. But Toni just had too many clothes to remember where and when she’d gotten everything.
“What ever happened to ‘is this some kind of elaborate prank?’” Clint shrugged with a wide grin and gestured wildly with his hands.
Tony shrugged and tried to look cool, but as his brain more and more realized that they were in space and what they were being offered, he grew more and more giddy with every second. But he couldn’t show that to the others so he fought hard to keep those feelings and thoughts back. “Looks like it. But I was still right.”
“Ah, Friend Bruce! I see you’ve come to join us in attempting to make sense of this machinery.” Bruce smiled and brushed some thick strands of hair out of his face.
“Yeah, thanks for the tip.” Clint rolled his eyes again, only this time no one shushed him or tried to smack him.
“Hey, don’t touch anything!” She hissed. “We don’t actually know what any of this is, for all we know we could set off a bomb by pressing the wrong buttons.” Thor grumbled, but Tony came up beside him and also started to look over everything.
Instead Tony placed a hand on his cheek and made Steve face him and smiled gently at him. “I’m sure it’s great, Steve. It just so sweet of you to make my favorite meal when you’ve never made it before just to make me happy.” He smirked teasingly at him to lighten the mood a little. “Even you are a total sap.”
Jarvis chuckled and sat down on the bed beside him, patting his shoulder. "I'm sure it won't be that bad, Tony. It might not seem very fun right now, but I believe that you will find this summer very rewarding. It is often by doing things outside of our comfort zone and try new things that we learn the most about ourselves. And who knows, maybe you'll make some friends over the summer?"
Jane started to pull on his arm and yell at him to release this young man called Pierce. “Thor, come on, stop it! He’s not worth it, you’ll get in trouble!” Thor looked at her, then back at Pierce and then saw that a crowd of people had formed around them. And he had the strangest feeling that they didn’t exactly form to see justice being served. So he dropped Pierce, who coughed and clutched at his throat before glaring up at him.
“Don’t mention it. I might be an asshole but I don’t like bullies anymore than anyone else do.” He reached into his pocket and pulled out a protein bar with nuts and berries, breaking it in two and handing one of them to Bruce. “Want some? I get the feeling we’re not gonna have lunch anytime soon.” Bruce took it with a grateful thank you and quickly finished it.
“Well, I guess that’s how you did things in your house, did you? Did your daddy shove his arrow up your ass or did they teach you that at the circus?” Clint’s smirk turned into grimace and he took another deep breath.
“Do you believe it’s reckless to choose to go on this adventure? While I admit the idea is very enticing and I do wish to go on this mission, perhaps we are a bit hasty?” Clint’s smile weakened too and he shrugged before folding his arms over his chest.
Seriously, the fact that there were people in this century that spent thousands of dollars on birthday parties made Steve’s skin crawl.
She kinda expected him to get annoyed with her after a while, with her relentless talking and flirting and hanging around him, but he didn't. On the contrary he seemed to enjoy her company more and more with every day. He would smile wide and brightly when he saw her smile and greet him in between classes, would gladly introduce her to old and new friends he had made and laugh at her jokes and humor her when she would talk nonstop at him in the library.
The guy though probably took Tony’s long silence as him not know English, because he suddenly looked a little wary and looked like he was trying hard to remember something, before speaking again, this time in Italian. “Uh…
Steve grinned and rested his cheek against Tony’s hair, pressing a kiss against his forehead. His grip around Tony tightened slightly and adjusted his grip a little, so he could rest his head against his shoulder. “Let them look. I have been waiting to hold you and kiss you again for ten fucking months, so you’re crazy if you think I’m letting you go ever again.”
So apparently I lied before. I said this chapter was going to be the first date, but then this chapter became so long that I decided to keep it as its separate chapter and have the first date be the next one. Just so it wouldn’t be so freaking long!
Tony smiled reassuringly, if a bit cockily, and stroke his hair out of his eyes again. He folded his arms over his chest, leaning on his leg and looking into his big blue eyes.
And so Toni had done what she always did with attractive people; flirted shamelessly with them and she also stared equally as shamelessly at his muscles, face and ass. He, however, hadn't reacted in the way she was too used to. He was blushing like crazy, stumbling over his own feet and tongue while talking to her, like it was the first time a girl was flirting with him.
And then she ran into to him at MIT from time to time, sometimes in the corridors or out on the campus lawn or in the library. And, against her better judgement, she started to hang out with him there too. She would greet him with a wide smile when she met him between classes or sit with on the lawn for a bit while he was hanging out with friends, or sit with him when he sat in the library and he was trying to study and bug for hours with endless talking or joking around with him.
“We can’t just go through everything in that computer in just a few seconds! We need to act, like yesterday!” Steve leaned over Tony’s shoulder and pointed at the joystick.
They sat like that for a while, just holding each other and Toni felt much better when they finally pulled away and there were no traces left of any tears in her eyes. Janet smiled and sat back against the headboard.
“My phone died at work and I left my charger here so I couldn’t recharge it. But I’ve learned my lesson, next time I go grocery shopping alone I’ll either bring my phone fully charged to we’ll go through the list together before I leave. Just so I know you’re not fucking with me.”
“Well, see, Dodger was already pretty cheap because he’d been there for so long and they really wanted someone to take him and give him a nice home. So, yeah, I spent the 100$ on getting him, but I figured you might have wanted a collar and a leash, a bowl and some toys and food and stuff. So, yeah, it cost a little bit more than 100$ to get him.”
“Like a queen. Now, you go and have a good time and,” She placed her hands on Toni’s shoulders and looked her in the eyes. “Don’t overthink this Toni. Just try to relax and see if this guy can surprise you and actually be nice to you. Don’t overthink this, just sit back and see what happens before you start worrying about this.” She pressed kiss to her cheek and smiled. “Have fun.”
"I'm sorry, babe, I really appreciate it that you get me dinner and offer to look after me when I'm bone-tired and just got back from a long mission. I am forever grateful to you and your kindness, now please be a dear and pour me a glass over milk please?" Tony snorted and rolled his eyes fondly.
And, both the worst and most exciting thing, he was now flirting with her almost as much as she flirted with him. She tried to show it didn't mean much that she was flirting, since she playfully flirted with pretty much everyone on campus, even some girls and boys that she really didn't like, but she couldn’t quite shake the feeling that his flirting with her was genuine. That he was interested in her.
“You’re here. You’re home. Oh my god, Steve, I’ve missed you so much!” Tony could barely speak through the tears and sobs, but he managed to rein them in enough to be at least somewhat understood while still crying. Though, given how Steve was shaking about as much as Tony was at the moment, he probably couldn’t talk much more than Tony at the moment.
He looked over Natasha’s shoulder over at Tony and the others, and felt his own curiosity overcome his fear as he looked over the machine and saw Tony and Clint laughing over something. He eventually decided that it couldn’t hurt to look and made his way over to them.
“Don’t get me wrong, tonight was great, I loved it. But you know I’d be just as happy if we ordered Chinese or pizza and just chilled on the couch watching TV. So why the sudden desire to impress? Cooking a big dinner with wine and dessert and everything, why? Is today important? Is there a date I have forgotten, because if I have, in my defense, I have told you I am terrible with remembering dates-“ Steve shook his head with a chuckle and tightened his hold on Tony.
So no, she wasn't over her fears by now. While she wasn’t scared as that he wasn't who he appeared to be and that he would try to use her or hurt her if she let him in, but now she was sure that he was a genuinely nice and good guy. But she was still really scared, because now she was sure that she really liked him too.
It was a lie. His parents did have a trip planed for the summer, that much he knew, but it wasn’t to Paris and they hadn’t forced him to come along. In fact, they hadn’t even told him to his face and he had heard it when they were talking to each other in his dad’s office without knowing he was outside listening to them.
“I know you’re in there, Romanov, I can smell your trashiness from here, you little slut! Your freak brother can’t always protect you, you piece of shit!”
Steve just stood there, frozen to the floor and staring after her, just like that day when he’d first met her. His hand slowly rose to his cheek where she’d kissed him and a big, wide and giddy smile spread across his face as he realized what had just happened.
is going on here!” Then the sound got so loud that they all needed to cover their ears and the light got so extremely bright that they all to duck down and close their eyes as it covered the whole car and then… blackness.
Once she was done she took a long look in the mirror, smiled and nodded to her reflection before turning to Janet, gesturing at herself with a smile. “Well, how do I look?” Janet smiled and grabbed a purse, dropping her phone, wallet and keys into it before handing it to her.
Steve couldn't really tell how long they were kissing, but when they finally pulled away, they were so wet that he worried if they were even going to be allowed inside the coffeehouse, because there was not a dry spot on either of them. Fortunately Steve wore a t-shirt under his sweater, or it might been a very cold coffee date, even for his 'furnace body' as Tony had dubbed it.
“Natasha, we’re in space! That much has been made obvious here. And we’re being offered a chance to spend our summer vacation in space, maybe fighting aliens or saving the galaxy! And you’d rather pick a summer camp over that?”
Natasha started to look over the walls, running her fingers over the smooth, cool metal to try and find anything that could tell them how to get out of there, and the others weren’t slow to follow suit and try find a button or hatch or a door that could get them out of there. But before anyone found anything, one end of the box opened itself like a slide door, making all of them jump back and stare at the opening.
He pressed another kiss to Steve’s throat. “I’ll be happy. I will always be happy with you.” And goddamn if that didn’t make Steve’s eyes water and he hugged Tony tighter and pressed a long, lingering kiss to his head.
Next to the driver was another girl, a girl with long red hair tied into a ponytail, green eyes and dressed in a tight dark red shirt and black pants. He knew her, it was Natasha Romanov. Everyone in school knew her despite very few people talking to her aside from her brother Clint Barton.
Janet smiled brightly and grabbed her shoulders from behind, resting her chin on her shoulder and looking at her reflection in the mirror. “You look so beautiful, Toni. I am taking full credit for this, just so you know, but you’re still really beautiful.” Toni smiled brightly back at her. Yeah she looked beautiful but she also
But Tony either didn’t notice or care because he just dialed a number and then put it to his ear only to look really surprised when he apparently didn’t get any response and looked down at his phone. “What? But it’s never…”
school for ‘assaulting’ other students. The excuse of PTSD only got her so far and couldn’t be used as an excuse for her whole life. It didn’t even really work anymore as it was. It had been more than ten years now and even school psychiatrists and psychologists told her that it shouldn’t bother her as much as it used to when she was younger. And no matter what Phil said, the school refused to cut her any more slack, so if she hurt any of the girls or even tried to fight back, she knew they would go crying to the principal and tell their own version of what happened. And he would believe them and refuse to even listen to her version and she would get kicked out. Again.
“Well it looks like you can sit at this thing, so maybe it has something to do with food?” Bruce looked at Tony, who seemed to looking for any buttons or display like the hair dryer had had. When he didn’t find anything he just shrugged and straightened up again.
So hey, maybe there was truth to that and he would get kicked out of there before too much time had passed? Or maybe he could try to convince his mom that he was sick too and really couldn’t got to the camp either and maybe she could ask for a refund too?
And a light blinked to the right of the control panel and on a small podium of sorts a small screen had appeared and a strange display of colors and different shapes was floating across the screen.
There had also been a time when Tony had had gotten him this great set of really good colors and brushes second hand that were pretty much unused and couldn’t possibly have cost 100$.
Steve smirked teasingly, but there was something hungry in his gaze, and his hands made their way from around Tony’s waist and down towards his butt, slowly and gently stroking his ass. “Why Mr. Stark, whatever gave you that idea?” But before Tony could respond, Steve had cupped his ass and hoisted him up in his arms, making Tony yelp in surprise, giving him a blinding smile. “I’m just giving my best guy the attention he deserves, that’s all.”
Steve growled as he threw his shirt on the floor, getting ready for his shower. Just thinking of Howard Stark made his blood boil and made him want to punch something or someone. And if he could have his pick, he’d really wish to punch Howard in the face, hard enough to at least break his nose and maybe knock a few teeth out.
“Tony, I brought you here to sleep and that’s what we’re gonna do.” He smirked and pulled Tony’s hands away from his belt. “
His Italian wasn’t terrible, though his pronunciation was weak and a little stilted. It was clear this guy was a tourist and knew very little Italian other than a few necessary phrases that he needed to know. Tony huffed a small laugh, prompting another coughing fit and got up on his knees, brushing wet strands of hair out of his eyes and looking back at the Adonis in front of him.
“Nope. Nope, no, I know what you’re doing, Rogers. It’s not gonna work this time.” He tilted his head up, with his nose in the air. Steve just smiled innocently; pulling the socks off his feet before moving up to unbutton Tony’s pants and pull them down his legs.
“It won’t take so long, just stay where you are and I’ll be back soon.” And with that she disappeared down the road and they looked after her, until she disappeared out of view. Tony closed the hood and walked over to the others, sitting down close by Thor and Clint’s throwing game.
“I can’t! It’s stuck, I can’t do anything with it!” Thor came to them with a big, thick book in his hands, flickering through the pages.
Steve blushed and nodded, a bit embarrassed. “Uh, yeah but that’s just… I mean, I wasn’t really-“ Bucky looked up from his laptop and leaned over her shoulder to get a look at the napkin. He smirked a little and leaned sat back properly in his seat.
It had happened so many times at this point that it was almost like they followed a script, like the words needed to be said, if only because they always said them, but they weren’t needed anymore. Whether it be when Tony woke up beside him while he was crying, or came in with a tray of food for him while he was listening to Sinatra, or when he was pounding the stuffing out of his punching bag in the gym with a snack and some water, Tony always seemed to know when Steve would want him to stay or go, but he always asked, regardless if he knew what the answer would be.
He had actually been called an ugly duckling for years before they all got older, started high school and everyone started to call him a fugly slut instead. He could only hope that he might turn out to be a swan someday.
He groaned as he made his way into the classroom, taking a breath through his nose and closes his eyes as he sat down in his seat.
“Figures. He’s a nerd, he doesn’t have the guts.” And Bruce immediately felt his anger boil up, like flicking on a switch and he glared over his shoulder at Clint before, completely without thinking for another second, pressed his finger down on one of the buttons without looking at which one it was.
“Yeah, I mean, anything is better than that stupid camp! I went into this knowing I would get a summer without Wi-Fi so either I get a summer without Wi-Fi in the woods in the middle of nowhere in being absolutely miserable or I would get a summer of adventure and planets and aliens and God knows what else without Wi-Fi.”
“What kind of weapons would be tested out in the woods this close to a road where cars drive?!” Tony glared at him and Bruce snapped out his own panic and stress and screamed loudly into his face, both to be heard and also to be stop the fighting.
All of them stared at the room for several minutes without saying a word. But eventually Clint licked his lips and took a step forward. “Where… where and what is this?”
“I was done with my speech and went over to the bar to get a drink. Pepper came over and said I did great, we talked a bit before she went off to mingle. Then…” Tony closed his eyes again and shuddered, so subtly that Steve almost missed it. “then he was just there, like he appeared out of thin air. And he wanted to talk.”
His face was jerked back and he was forced to look back at Schmidt. “The thing is, they are above you for one single fact; they have a click and a group that they belong too. The second Barnes gets sick or just doesn’t come to school; you’re on your own. You could be one of the great sport stars and a really popular kid if you really wanted to, but you choose not to be. And you don’t hang out with the art freaks either, because you think you’re above it all. But you can’t fool me, Rogers. You know you’re nothing without Barnes and you know it too. You can turn your nose up at us all you want, and you can act like you think we’re immature or stupid or whatever, but I know it’s because they don’t want you either. Ever since you both came to this school, everyone has tried to make friends with you but you refuse and now they hate you because you act so stuck up. But this school is for special kids, kids with great potential, but where’s yours? Oh, that’s right, you don’t have any.”
Or, well, he would. Just as soon as Steve came home from work and his run to the grocery store on the way back. Then they would sit back on the couch, order take-out for dinner and then sit back and watch Netflix together, just like they did whenever both of them were free from work.
As she walked inside the coffee shop she saw Steve stand and talk to the other guy who worked here from time to time, Sam, who were also a good friend to Steve. She smiled as she walked up behind him to surprise, but she got closer and heard what they were talking about, her smile turned into frown as she got closer and closer.
“Do you think-“ He winced as a loud high-pitched sound started to ring. He raised his voice to a scream, “Do you think it’s some kind of weapon’s demonstration?” Steve turned to him and glared at him, now pressing his fingers over his ears.
“I know you love dogs, I know you’ve always wanted a dog, so I thought it would be the perfect birthday gift for you.” And oh God, how could Steve have been so lucky to find a man like Tony? The love and affection he had for this man almost made his heart burst and he surged forward and kissed him, hard and a bit clumsily, wrapping his arms around his waist.
They had all been sitting in the living room, each with their own activities to keep themselves occupied, Thor and Hulk were playing video games, Natasha was dying her nails and Clint had somehow roped Sam into a game of darts with him. Steve had been keeping himself busy with crosswords when Tony came into the room with a wide grin on his face.
"Of course I do. Why do you think I keep bugging you at the library when you try to study? Why do you think I come here every day you work and sit her until you leave for the day? My attention and time is very valuable, Steve, I don't give this much of it to just anyone." She smirked teasingly at him. "Like you said yourself, I'm gonna be a household name one day and I can't just spend too much time talking to low-life garbage that don't matter. Like Hammer."
And there it was. They were going on their vacation and needed to get rid off him, since they obviously didn’t trust him to be left alone in the house, since Jarvis would also be taking a few weeks off while they were away since there wouldn’t be too many people to look after anymore.
He raised an eyebrow at Tony, probably looking really suspicious. But Tony just smiled and shrugged. “It’s a surprise! I don’t want you to ruin it. Just humor me, will you?”
When he finally let go and they both calmed down from their laughing, Steve took Tony by the shoulders and pulled him close while smiling softly. “Okay, I’m going to take a quick shower and change into something cozier. How about you order take-out and pick a movie and I’ll join you in ten minutes?” Tony smiled sweetly and nodded, his hair adorably ruffled after their little play fight and his big brown eyes still sparkling with mischief.
The kids slowly made their way towards the podium, all a bit warily, and took their spots around it. “What is that?” Clint asked, nudging Tony in the side, who just shrugged while never looking away from the screen. Natasha elbowed him in the side with a glare and shushed him before looking back at the screen, just as the voice started talking again.
tech, Rogers, but this has got to be sabotage here. This engine doesn’t look like it malfunctioned, it looks like it’s been tampered with.” The driver rolled her eyes and folded her arms over her chest.
Steve shook his head slowly. While she was very, very good friends with Bruce, it had been very clear that they were just friends.And while she flirted with him from time to time, it was very clear she was playing and joking with him more often than not and he had his interest elsewhere. She and Reed had been going at each other for months and she kept calling him 'a stuck up son-of a-bitch with his head shoved way too far up his own ass' and he called her 'a spoiled, pampered Daddy's girl with enough ego for it to be visible from Space', so they clearly didn't like each other.
“Well, apparently mom overheard it from the Van Dynes, who I assume heard it from Jan. So she told him and asked if he had heard about it, which he hadn’t. And he freaked out and called the second he heard about it. And well,” He shrugged and glanced over at Steve. “here we are.”
Janet smiled and patted her hand. “Anytime, Tones. Now, you go and take shower, clean up and make yourself look nice. I’ll find a nice pair of shoes and some jewelry that goes with this. And… no, you know what, I’ll help you with your makeup too, just to make it easier.”
fight, and this time not even for defending anyone from bullies but not just losing his temper when an asshole taunted him.
"Thank you, Tony. You're the best." Tony scoffed playfully and ran his fingers through Steve's messy, dirty hair.
Steve must’ve heard the yell however, or spotted Tony moving, because he finally turned in his direction and the smile that spread across his face threatened to split his face in two. He threw his bags down and started running too and before Tony’s brain could fully process it all, he threw his arms around Steve, wrapped his arms tightly around Steve’s neck and pressed his face into the crook of his neck, inhaling his scent and letting tears of relief and happiness fall, the weight that he had been carrying around for a whole year now finally lifting and disappearing.
He looked about as close to a Hercules as you could probably get. Well, a Hercules with blonde hair and looking very All-American, but still.
Tony pressed his lips together, took another breath and his voice sounded a little strained. “I tried to make it as clear as possible that he wasn’t wanted, that I wanted nothing to do with him. B-but whatever I said or did, he just wouldn’t leave me alone. He tried to buy me a drink, I said no. He asked me questions about how I’d been doing and stuff, I gave short and rude responds. He kept… he kept
“Making it home to you.” He placed a kiss on Tony’s forehead. “I meant what I said before, you know. I’m here to stay, Tony, for as long as you’ll have me. You have to know that I adore you and I want to spend forever with you. I’m done leaving you behind for these missions, I promise. From today, I’m done. It’ll be just you and me from now on, if you’ll have me.”
Well… okay, maybe Bruce. If he didn’t already have a crush on Natasha Romanov, she might actually have asked him out once or twice.
So yeah, Steve had really fallen for her. But he couldn’t tell if Toni was feeling the same way, because she- as he had learned quickly- flirted with a lot of people. Sure, she could flirt with him for hours and give him cute nicknames or say suggestive things to him, but he had no idea if she did that to other guys.
Speaking of Clint, he was sitting behind her, his sandy blonde hair a tousled mess and dressed in a purple t-shirt and loose, dark blue jeans. And beside him was a big and buff guy, shoulder long blonde hair and dressed in a t-shirt, red hoodie. In the backseat was another big and blonde guy, dressed in a flannel shirt, brown leather jacket and khaki pants, looking really uncomfortable and had his arms folded over his chest. And next to him was Tony Stark, who Bruce definitely recognized. He was dressed in tight jeans, a red, yellow and black jacket and a black tank top. He had also styled his hair like he always did and had a pair of sunglasses over his face.
A small hatch opened itself on the podium, revealing six small devices, about an inch long and looking like small USB devices.
Or how Johann Schmidt ran a small club in school he claimed to be about history, but was really about benefits and greatness of National Socialism and Nazism, which the school didn’t know about and if they did would probably get him kicked out in seconds.
“Welcome home, sweetheart.” Tony felt himself melt in Steve’s arms and the stress that was still there in his body immediately fade away, and all that was left was his undying love for his boyfriend.
He gestured to himself dejectedly. “And then there’s me. Steve Rogers, scrappy kid from Brooklyn with no money, a bit above average intelligence and have been studying Art for almost two years and has nothing to offer anyone.”
People kept saying he looked a lot like his father did when he had been his age, but his dad was way more attractive and was called handsome left and right and Tony was… not.
“Indeed, a mighty beast worthy of the great Captain.” Thor rumbled from his spot by the couch, having taken a small break in the video game playing to take a look at the newest family member. Natasha didn’t say much, but she smiled wryly at the dog and Steve and Tony before she went back to her nails. Sam came up to them, knelt down beside the dog and started to pet him and scratch him behind the ears.
Steve drew a shaky breath and sniffled loudly before finally talking. “Yeah, I’m here now. I’m home, oh God Tony, you have no idea how much I’ve missed you.” He gently put Tony back down on the ground but pressed him close up to his chest, burying his face in Tony’s hair.
Bruce was sitting with a book of his own, but he had taken to watch Tony and Clint throw their little rock-dart game, and while Clint was still better at hitting bulls-eye than Tony, Tony was still pretty good and did hit a few every once in a while too, until he eventually decided he’d had enough and sat down close to Bruce while Clint was rubbing his obvious victory in his face.
“Don’t know, actually. I don’t remember buying this. It’s probably something my mom bought me or something.” She shrugged and placed a hand on Janet’s shoulder. “Thanks Jan, this is great.” It was a bit simple for a night out for her taste, but this was kinda new territory for her anyway so she decided to trust Janet’s judgement for this.
And of course it was Brock Rumlow, because who else would it be? That guy was out to get him, Clint swore up and down that he was. And now he was laughing along with a few buddies, as Clint was still half-lying on the floor.
Natasha, who was somehow not as tired as him, made her way into the kitchen and got herself a sandwich and an apple before she walked out of the room and patted him on the shoulder as he passed him. "Get some rest Cap, and something to eat. You look like you need it." He groaned tiredly into the table and practically heard her smile as she left the room.
He must’ve been born under a lucky star in a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow, because could not believe how lucky he was.
When Tony got down to the communal floor he could smell that dinner was being made, but there was no chatter coming from the kitchen. Which was always a little weird, considering that Avengers Tower was almost never completely quiet, whether it be Thor and Hulk fighting over cookies, or Clint pulling pranks on anyone else on the team or being chased by the Hulk, or Tony himself blasting music at top volume in his workshop while working. Bottom line, it was almost never entirely quiet in this tower.
His voice suddenly sounded choked up and blinked heavily, like he was holding back tears, which gave Toni pause and she suddenly felt less angry and offended and more pitying. He took a deep breath and looked like he was readying himself for something.
“Uh, well in that case, I guess I owe you an apology for bumping into you like that. I wasn’t looking where I was going and… well, I walked into you, I guess.” He tried to smile, but it looked very strained and unnatural. He then also seemed to realize he was still holding Tony’s hand because he dropped it very quickly. “I’m… I’m really sorry. Are you okay?”
She never said anything about these things, because if she ever did plan of revealing these things she wanted to make it hurt. She’d like to have all her cards sorted out and make sure the people would suffer as she revealed it. Or it was just nice to know these things without them knowing about it. It made it a little more bearable, she supposed.
Clint grinned widely at him. “Oh hey, you’re that guy from Norway, right? Um, Thor, right? Sorry, Natasha is better at names than me.” But Thor just smiled and slapped Clint on the shoulder so hard he almost fell onto the floor.
, didn’t he? It wasn’t enough to spread rumors, to bully and harass him and even beat him up every once in a while and practically ruin any chances of Tony making friends, he had to go for his sex life as well? Hadn’t he kicked in that door enough as it was?
Tony had grabbed Steve’s hand and ran in under the closest gazebo to shelter them from the rain and then started to shake the rain out of his hair and clothes. Steve just watching him fondly and shook his head amusedly because Tony both acted and looked like a cat right then and there. Which was fairly accurate really, considering Tony hated water, whether it was in the pool back at the tower or it was falling from the sky.
“Yeah sure Cap, just like you didn’t cheat when we played Risk last Game Night. Or when he played Monopoly the week before. Or when we play poker, or Twister or any game that we have ever played. You’re not fooling anyone Cap, you’re just as big a cheater as the rest of us.”
Tony smiled back and shook his hand. “Tony Stark.” If Steve recognized the name Stark, he certainly didn’t show it, he just smiled and tucked his hands into his pockets.
Tony sighed for the umpteenth time in the last fifteen minutes and looked down at his watch again. 17:48. A minute had passed since the last time he looked at it. He sighed again and took a sip of his coffee. It was his third cup of coffee and the barista had looked at him a little funny when he had come back for the third time for another one, but Tony just couldn’t bring himself to care. He’d been waiting for hours now and the coffee help his worry, if only a little.
Steve smiled and loosened his grip on Tony’s shoulders slightly; really he was just resting his hands there now. “Right. And I know you do, you accepted my proposal and married me. I know you love me, you show me that every single day with everything you do. Christ Tony, everything I have in this century is thanks to you. My friends, my job, my home, it’s all thanks to you. You gave me a home, Tony, a family and your love. I couldn’t ask for more, so how can you possibly believe that I would think you’d cheat on me, with Tiberius Stone of all people?”
Tony snorted and put his phone down. “You mean I’m not the only one who had this whole thing dumped into my lap the second I got home from school? Well, at least it’s a comfort I won’t be the only one who’ll suffer.”
He felt a hand on his back, patting firmly to help him cough up the water and probably reassure him. “Hey, hey, it’s okay man. You’re alright, just cough it all up.” The voice was gentle, if a little awkward, but his presence did help a little.
“Yeah, can’t a couple of guys just talk without it meaning anything?” Tony almost rolled his eyes. Seriously, if Justin weren’t hanging around Ty and Aldrich all the time, he would never see him as a threat or even a bully. He was nothing but a wannabe who was trying way too hard to be cool and suave but was failing on that front, even when he was hanging around them like a lost puppy.
If anyone had told his five-year old self that he would one day be in a romantic relationship with his best friend and eventually be engaged to him, he was pretty sure it would blow his five-year old mind. But here he was, twenty-three years old and had already found the love of his life and would one day be able to call him his husband.
Only it had taken a turn for the worst when he had been told that he would be sent off to a camp for the summer and he would be forced to leave the next day.
century for a few years now, Steve could say with his hand on his heart that things were better here. There was so much better food, no need to boil everything and spare every little crumb you could find because of lack of money, though the habit to save food and not waste too much food still hadn’t really left him, and probably never would. God, he would never get over the wastefulness of this century. Polio being almost entirely gone and vaccines preventing it was fantastic, and of course the Internet. Nowadays information was so much easier to come by these days, much better than having to look everything up in books or newspapers.
She had called up Janet immediately after having left the coffee shop and they met up back in their apartment and sat down on the couch and dug into a pint of ice cream that Janet had brought with her. Janet was one of her oldest friends, her college roommate and practically her sister and she could tell her anything. So after she told her about Steve and how her flirting with him had gone, Janet hummed and smirked at her.
They had been out in Central Park for the last hour, just strolling around in the sun, holding hands and just having a good time together, when suddenly the weather changed seemingly out of nowhere and it started raining like there was no tomorrow. And not too long after that they had seen a flash of lightning and heard the boom of thunder.
“Um, I asked Jarvis what your favorite dish was and he said carbonara, so I looked up recipes for it. But I’ve never actually made it before so…” He trailed off and bit his lip, and Tony had to hold himself back from going ‘aaw’ at his boyfriend. He couldn’t help it; Steve Rogers was basically a human version of a golden retriever puppy, eager to please and so cute, both when he was happy or sad or nervous.
“Perhaps she has gotten herself lost in these woods? Or she has gotten into trouble with animals? She may not have, as you phrase it, ditched us on purpose.” Tony didn’t respond to that, he just rolled his eyes again and wiped off his hands on his pants before looking through his bag.
“What is this, Candid Camera?” Tony whispered to Clint, who snorted a little but the others quickly and harshly shushed at them and Natasha smacked Tony on the head, quite hard too. Tony yelped in pain and rubbed his head while throwing a dirty glare at her.
Tony had always liked him. Despite being from a rather financially limited family, having very little aside from his art degree and a rather mediocre job and not really being that eye-catching until he got big and muscle-y, Tony had always looked to him as a hero and the reason he was still alive today. Especially during their sophomore year when Tony had come to his house in tears, a big bruise on his face and admitted that he’d had thoughts of killing himself and that Howard had hit him and his mother did nothing. That year had been extremely tough to get through and Steve’s mom had been adamant about calling the police and Tony getting professional help, which Tony had been equally adamant about not getting it because ‘dad would never allow it or pay for it.’ So Steve had done absolutely everything he could and made sure Tony always felt loved and sat with him for hours on end whenever he needed to talk or just wanted to be held while he cried. It had been tough, but they’d gotten through it. And once they had and Tony felt better, he’d taken Steve out on date under the stars and gave a long speech about how grateful he was for all the help and how much he loved him for all that he had done for him. And Steve had just said that he was worth it.
“Tony.” Steve whispered back into Tony’s hair, his grip around Tony tightening and Tony gasped a little when he was suddenly lifted of floor and spun around like a girl in a romantic movie. He tightened his grip around Steve as he was spun around, more out of instinct than anything else, but whatever. The closer he could be to Steve right now the better.
Everyone jumped and immediately stopped what they were doing and stared at it, as the light and the sound got closer and louder. “What’s that?” Clint asked as they all stared and he, Tony, Steve and Thor walked closer to spot what it was. But Natasha called them back.
Steve's eyes widened in pure shook, looking to be completely blown away by her answer and "Sure, I'll be there." Toni just smirked and got up on her toes and leaned in close to his face.
As the bell signaling the end of class chimed, Thor collected his math books before hurrying out of the classroom so he might have a chance to speak with his lovely Jane before next class. They did not share many classes and he very much wanted to speak with her as much as he could.
The whole weekend would probably be much of the same, but really, Tony was more than fine with that. Steve was here to stay forever now, away from the army and had asked him to marry him.
Also, if anyone is interested, Toni’s dress looks like this: https://www.ever-pretty.com/products/sleeveless-v-neck-short-party-dress-ep03989
“Uh, not that I’m against what you’re thinking at the moment, but don’t you think you need both hands for your bags?” Steve blinked, a bit surprised and looked back over his shoulders at the bags he had dumped on the floor. Then he looked back at Tony and then he stubbornly set his jaw and a determined look formed on his face and he quickly stomped over to the bags. He swung one of them across his back and then walked over to Tony with the other bag, a slightly smaller duffle bag, and had a mischievous spark in his eyes and dumped it in his arms.
like you Toni. I think I’ve liked you since that first day we met. And I’d really like to be more than your friend, to take you out on a date, and treat you right and make you feel special like you deserve and-“
Steve could barely talk around the puppy and the licking, but he managed to grab its squirming body and lifted it down on the floor before sitting down in front of it, petting and scratching behind ears and on the belly and everywhere else.
"Oh, Toni." Janet reached out and hugged her tightly and Toni was quick to hug back, burying her face in hair chestnut brown hair and fighting her hardest to keep the tears at bay. Janet was her only stable rock since coming to MIT, especially since Rhodey and Carol joined the Air Force and barely had time to see her anymore. And though she had made new friends since coming to Boston, she was so thankful for Janet, for agreeing to moving in together when both of them got accepted to schools in Boston, for being a mood lifter when she needed it and for having been there for her and with her since they were kids.
“I’m telling you!” Tony called to them from one the doors without looking away from it. “Kidnapped.” Steve rolled his eyes and had to bite his to prevent himself from saying something stupid.
“Not too many other scientists will get a chance to see these parts of the galaxy that we will get to see!”
Everyone whipped around the look at the big window beside them and a big, fiery red asteroid was heading towards them at an alarming rate. Tony and Bruce ran towards the controls and looked over the controls.
“I’ll pay yours and you’ll pay mine?” Tony chuckled and, despite still being soaking wet and his heart was still kinda pounding from the almost drowning incident, he felt totally date ready.
He snorted to himself and turned on the warm water, stepping into the shower. How was it that even now, almost six months after having proposed to him, that word still made him so freaking happy and smile so wide it almost split his face in two? Steve hadn’t dated too much before Tony, only having gone on a few dates with a girl here and there, the only one who’d ever meant anything was Peggy Carter and she’d moved away to another state just before they were about to start high school. And despite being kind of sweet on her, it had never been much more than a crush and they’d only really kissed once and it was during a game of Truth or Dare at a slumber party at Sharon’s house. Tony had been his first real- and only- boyfriend and he’d never been happier than when he had Tony all to himself.
“Aw honey, it’s cute you think I’m giving you a choice.” Tony’s head snapped up, his eyebrows scrunched together and his focus suddenly entirely on Steve’s words and the tone in Steve’s voice but given only a second to figure out what it means for him before Steve grabbed him around the waist, threw him over his shoulder and heads for the door. “JARVIS, let’s close up shop for tonight.”
“Oh yeah, haha, very funny Rumlow! You’re such a fucking riot I might piss myself laughing so hard!” Rumlow just laughed some more before walking up to Clint, smirking and folded his arms over his chest.
“Fine. Let’s do that.” Then he started to walk away from them and the others turned to look after him.
“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to- I never wanted to-“ Steve shushed him again and pressed a kiss to Tony’s temple.
Bucky rolled his eyes harder and opened his laptop and grabbed one of his books from his bag. “Oh yeah, how could I forget?
And then, of course, there was Tony Stark. To say that he and Tony had gotten a rocky start would be an understatement. Even after they apologized for their harsh words on the Helicarrier, there was just something about Tony that had rubbed Steve the wrong way. There was just something about his attitude, this air of I-don’t-give-a-fuck that irked him a little. That Tony seemed to think he could do whatever he wanted and didn’t care about the consequences. That he didn’t have to listen to orders or directions or ideas from others, because ‘Fuck you, I’m Tony Stark, I do whatever I want’. And it didn’t help that they were oil and water and would get into arguments after every mission.
Clint snorted and ruffled Tony hair, making the slighter shorter guy squawk in outrage. “Your hair ain’t that good-lookin’ Stark. If you have to style it before going out, then you’re clearly not a naturally handsome guy, like me.” He smirked and rested his arm on Tony’s head and leaning on him slightly before Tony pushed him off, looking mighty annoyed.
“Oh fuck off, Rogers, no one asked for your opinion.” Rogers? Rogers… Bruce had heard that before, but was the full name… oh yeah, Steve Rogers! They had math together, but he was probably a bigger introvert than Bruce because he was sure the guy never actually spoke or hung out with anyone. At least not that Bruce knew.
"It's just a summer camp, Steve. You'll survive." She got up from the bed and headed for the door. But before she walked out, she turned to look at him with a soft, reassuring smile. "You know Steve, I have a good feeling about this summer. I think this camp will be good for you. Call it a hunch, but I think you'll really like this summer."
“So… what will we do now? Shall we try to discuss what our next course of action should be? How we shall vote?” Clint stared at him with wide eyes, as if the idea of what they should do was really freaking obvious.
Tony wanted to say, but he couldn’t get the words out. His tongue was frozen in his mouth and he couldn’t get it to work for him.
Tony didn’t look entirely convinced, he still looked a little wary and like a scared woodland creature, which just made Steve’s heart ache even more. He grabbed Tony by the shoulders, not tightly but firmly enough to catch Tony’s attention, and made him look him in the eyes. “Tony, you love me, right?”
“What we should do?! I’ll tell what we should do, we should vote yes!” Now everyone stared at him and Natasha raised her eyebrow at him, crossing her arms over her chest.
Thor marched up to the podium, chest puffed out and head held high with a proud look on his face. “My family comes from a long line of brave men and women who have done many great things in their lifetimes, and I will not show weakness in the face of challenge. And this quest promises great adventure and for an honorable cause. So I will say yes as well.” He slammed his big hand down on the green button, smiling widely at the whooping sound before joining Tony and Clint, who high-fived him and patted him on the shoulder.
“Of course I do. Why do you think I keep bugging you at the library when you try to study? Why do you think I come here every day you work and sit her until you leave for the day? My attention and time is very valuable, Steve, I don’t give this much of it to just anyone.” She smirked teasingly at him. “Like you said yourself, I’m gonna be a household name one day and I can’t just spend too much time talking to low-life garbage that don’t matter. Like Hammer.”
Steve shook his head with a sad frown on his face. "No, no of course it's up to you who you want to date or be friends with Toni, I am absolutely not trying to take that away from you. It's your choice and no one else's, but…" He suddenly trailed off and sighed despondently. "I just… didn't think you'd ever think want to date someone… someone like me. I don't have much, I mean I barely get by as it is, but…"
"Asshole. Here I go preparing dinner for you and let you just sit there and relax and not waste any energy after a three-day mission and you attack me! See if I'm ever nice to you again, Rogers." Steve laughed, put the fork down and buried his face in Tony's stomach again, kissing his belly.
Steve just shushed him gently, keeping one arm tightly wrapped around Tony’s shoulders while the other one was stroking his back, doing his best to comfort his distraught husband. But inside, there was a raging battle between his anger and rational thinking. The soldier in him wanted to march right out into the city, find that sleazy scumbag of an ex-boyfriend and beat the shit out of him. It was nothing less than he deserved and nothing could convince Steve otherwise. But the more rational guy in him bashed the soldier part of him over the head and reminded him of his crying, hysterical husband who was begging for forgiveness into his chest, who really needed reassurance and comfort above karmic retribution.
She rolled her eyes. “I didn’t say that. But I am saying that, if we are in space and we choose to stay here, we can’t go back. This won’t be like going to camp, faking illness after a few weeks and being sent home. Besides, we don’t know exactly what we’re getting into here. For all we know we could be asked to join a war of life and death or maybe it’s a trick where we’ll be eaten by a monster if we choose to stay.”
So she changed into a clean shirt and a hoodie, grabbed her bag with her wallet and headed towards the Starbucks, the fresh autumn air cool against her face and making her wake up a little. It was still September and relatively warm but it was slowly becoming autumn and the air was becoming cooler, the leaves were going from green to yellow and orange and it was raining more and more now.
"Well, I wouldn't say that Tony. You are a very good boy, with wit and charm and humor. I'm sure you can make some friends at the camp. And who knows, maybe you'll have some adventures there too." Tony looked up just in time to see Jarvis wink mischievously before leaving the room. Tony stared after him before rolling his eyes and sitting up, leaning back against the headboard.
Then he heard someone clearing their throat from behind them, and the guys turned to look, only to see Natasha Romanov stand very close to them leaning on her hip and her hands on her sides, tapping her foot impatiently.
"Dammit." She muttered as she climbed back up on her feet and rubbed her hand over her cheek. "Fucking hell and fucking robot piece of shit!" Once she was able to stand upright and her head and stopped spinning around, she walked over to the small fridge she kept in the workshop and grabbed an icepack to press against the sore spot on the face.
Steve smiled and placed one hand over Tony’s cheek, stroking his thumb under Tony’s eye. “I mean it, sweetheart. You’ve had such a rough life and you’ve still turned out an amazing man. You’re smart, kind, brave, generous, funny and you’ve worked so hard to get where you are today and I’m so proud of you and to be your boyfriend. And I know we’re young and stupid and just a bit above broke, but I don’t care, I want you now and forever. I’ve thinking a lot of this and when I picture myself happy…” He leaned down and pressed a kiss on Tony’s mouth. “It’s with you.”
Tony had been taking a small walk along the docks down by the harbor, taking in the clear blue water and colorful houses and warm bright sun. There were plenty of boats there too, most of them preparing for a full day of fishing or taking tourists out for tours to hidden beaches or other places around the coast. Tony had smiled, closed his eyes and took a deep breath through his nose, taking in the scents of salt water and felt in his bones that
"Not anymore. This was just what I needed, thanks." Tony laughed and stood up, taking the now empty plastic container and gestured at the empty plate.
“You couldn’t afford me, Toni. Even with your dad’s billions of dollars.” She then grabbed the dress, still hanging on the hanger, and handed it over to her. “Now get dressed, you’ll need to get going soon.”
So they were all going to the camp together? Hm, it didn’t seem like something people like Tony, Natasha or Clint might like, and he didn’t know about the others but they didn’t look like they were jumping at the chance to be here either.
“Well, thank you for the tip, Shaggy. I’ll keep that in mind for the future.” She then turned back to Steve with a softer smile. “But seriously, for ‘not really trying’ this is good. Way too good to be ‘doodles’ in my own inartistic opinion.”
over. He hurried up from his chair, almost ran into Steve Rogers as he was on his way out, quickly apologized and kept hurrying. The Corridors were now full of other kids that were hurrying to gather their things from their lockers before getting out of the building.
“I don’t regret it you know.” Tony’s voice startled him out his thoughts and made him look down at him, where he was still resting his head against his shoulder, talking into his shirt. Steve tightened his grip around his shoulders a little and raised his other hand to brush through Tony’s messy hair.
“I sure hope so, ‘cause if this is just meant for your hair it takes up a whole lot of space for very little meaningful purpose. I mean, I’m all for good-looking hair obviously, but this seems like very big machine for something that you easily fix with a jar of gel and a towel.”
"What trickery is this?" Thor jerked up from where he sat and gaped around in the room, which made Clint jump a little and he also looked around, both shocked and a little scared.
Tony rolled his eyes at her and almost placed his hand on her shoulder before he realized what he was doing and retracted it. “Who cares? It’s still an adventure through fucking space! So what if we face aliens and monsters or whatever, I’ll gladly take it over grilling hotdogs over the campfire in the woods covered in insect repellant or being forced to swim in some cold lake, because it’s awesome!”
“Well, unlike you I actually value my education and future. I need to get good grades in order to get where I want to go in life. And besides,” He looked up from his drawing again. “you and I both now that girls didn’t so much as look at me before senior year. And I don’t want a girl to like me just for my body.”
"Hey guys, are you okay?" The others started to move and look up from where they were sitting with their heads ducked down, hands over their ears and eyes closed.
As he made his way down the hallway he felt people stare at him and heard them whisper or laugh as he passed them. He didn’t care what were saying, because it was never anything new. There was nothing they could say about him that he hadn’t already heard from everyone else.
“What do you want now, Schmidt? Don’t you have anything better to do than hang over my shoulder all the time?” Schmidt smirked evilly and folded his arms over his chest, his black leather jacket squeaking at the movements.
“What transpires here? What could possibly be making this noise?” Tony grimaced too and gritted his teeth as it got even louder.
Tony smiled and sniffed softly, closing his eyes to kill his tears and taking another breath. “I know.” He looked back up and pressed a kiss to Steve’s cheek. “But thank you for telling me, Steve. You’re the sweetest.” Then he groaned and slumped against Steve, looking very tired and buried his face in his shirt.
And it’s finally done! I wasn’t sure how long I wanted to keep this chapter or if I should cut it in half, but I really want to get to the good stuff so I figure we get all of this out of the way as quick as possible.
He looked up at his mother, who was standing beside him with a wide and simpering smile on her face. That honestly made it worse, because it made him feel like she thought he was five years old again and not sixteen, and that he still loved to run around and play with his toys in the garden. His father also stood close by, but at least he wasn't even trying to look like he thought Tony would like it.
Bucky snorted into the phone. "Knowing you you'll probably get kicked out in a less in a week after picking fights with assholes. You've never known when to back down and just let things be." Steve rolled his eyes and stared up at the ceiling.
was heard as someone kicked the door to the cubicle she was sitting in, making her jump, jolt out of her thoughts and almost drop her water bottle. She had put her feet up, so in case anyone walked in they wouldn’t see her, but of course they would anyway, considering it was the only that was locked.
“Fuck off, Barton.” Then he got off Steve’s lap. “Okay, I’m gonna go get the gift, but first you have to close your eyes.” And, okay, that was a little weird. So, if he had to close his eyes Tony probably hadn’t wrapped it. And if he hadn’t wrapped it, what could he have planned this time?
Steve blushed and kept his eyes down on his feet. She was right, of course. He wasn't the most social kid in school, that had always been Bucky. He'd never been one to reach out too that many people in his life and was kinda content where he was. Sure, he had Sam and he kinda knew Thor who both played on the football team, and he kinda knew his girlfriend Jane since she always met them up after practice or a game to greet Thor.
It’s not really easy to care much for your birthday when it’s on the Fourth of July. Especially after becoming Captain America and people had learned that his birthday was, in fact, on Independence Day and it became almost as big a spectacle as the celebration of the country.
“As you wish, your highness. I shall return to you post haste.” He pressed a quick kiss to his cheek and turned to leave. “I love you sweetheart.” And with that he left the room and headed towards the bathroom.
And she also knew what would happen if she did fight back and slap one of them across the face, and she couldn’t get kicked out of yet
“Yeah, so you’ll choose the adventure, right?” Bruce grimaced at him before shaking off his arm and slowly walking up to the podium, looking over the buttons carefully. Natasha chimed in, a slightly concerned look on her face.
After taking a quick shower and changing her back into her regular clothes, she got out of the locker room and started towards her next class. And along the way, it was always the same. Guys stared at her like she was either a goddess or a monster of some sort and girls ran away from her or glared at her, spelling out their hatred or fear for her very clearly.
“Are you sure, though? I mean, it’s still space. It could be dangerous to stay here. We could die from- well, anything out here!” Clint shrugged with a wry smirk.
“So, what’ve you got for me, stud?” Steve suddenly looked a little nervous and licked his lips, looking over the table and the plates with food.
“Yeah, I guess I have. I’m still not sure what to think of the mission yet, but I’d like a good look at these machines at the very least. Just in case we get placed back on Earth and our memories are wiped of all of this.” Tony nodded and patted his hand against the machine.
“Maybe, but it’s not like they would know where we are, right? We can only hope someone realizes six kids are missing with no explanation as to why they didn’t show up to camp on the first day.”
Bruce was fairly easy to befriend. Just as long as you didn’t go out of your way to provoke him, disturb him while he was working in his lab or mess with his personal items, he was friendly enough and probably the most patient with Steve when he didn’t understand a reference or asked too many questions about a subject, which something he could definitely spot in even Natasha’s unreadable facial expressions at times. He also started to relax more around them all and seemed much more comfortable and secure in his own skin than he had been when they’d first met on the Helicarrier.
“Yeah and we could drown in a lake at summer camp, what’s your point?” Steve narrowed his eyes at Clint and took a step forward, straightening his back and towering over him.
They’d probably stop by the pizza place on the way home, or they’d order for delivery when they got home. They’d pick a movie to watch while eating but eventually start to pay more attention to each other than the movie. Steve would pull him close and hold him throughout the whole night, even when they would need to go to bed. Tony would cling onto Steve too, making sure to himself that he was actually home and this wasn’t some kind of dream. He’d probably finger on the engagement ring on his finger to make sure that was real too, because it still felt like a dream.
“You know she would never touch your ass in a million years, right? She has hundreds of guys chasing her and that want to be her boyfriend, and you think you have a shot with her? Keep dreaming Rogers, you’re never gonna get with her.” Steve tried to rip himself out of Rumlow’s grip again and almost succeeded at making him loosen his grip, only for him to tightening it again in a split second.
Toni is both intrigued by Steve being different from every other guy she's met and flirted with and terrified at the same time, and after having landed a date with she promptly freaks out and needs Janet to rein her in.
Steve smirked back but there was a dangerous fire in his blue eyes. “Yeah I know, but fuck Howard Stark, I’m not afraid of him. If he has anything to say about our engagement or relationship he can say it to my face. If he has the balls that is.”
Tony hadn’t given marriage too much thought since before dating Steve, and even then it wasn’t until their relationship had started to become serious that he'd started to even consider it at all. But after having talked to Steve about it, after having read Steve’s letters, he'd realized just how much he loved him and that he really wanted to spend the rest of his earthly days with him.
“Oh, so defensive Steven. I just wanted to see how my old friend is doing, all alone with no friends to eat with.” Steve gritted his teeth and tried to breathe calmly through his nose so he wouldn’t loose his temper.
Once he had managed to get Tony ready for bed, helping him remove his makeup and get out of his tight suit, while Tony managed to wake up enough to brush his teeth and get into his pajamas, they found themselves together in bed and wrapped up in each other’s arms. Tony was out like a light less than a minute after lying down, with his head resting on Steve’s chest. Steve had his arms wrapped tightly around Tony’s waist, keeping him in place and pressed a few kisses to Tony’s cheek, nose and head before settling down to sleep as well.
me, even when I made it clear that I didn’t want his hands on me. An arm around the shoulders or trying to hold my hand, he just wouldn’t
Thor looked over at Bruce, who was still sitting by the hairdryer and looked over at Steve, coming up to him so they could speak to themselves. “Is he well? He looks ill.” Steve glanced over at Bruce, who thankfully didn’t look as pale anymore and had regained some color in his face.
What the fuck was she doing? Had her stupid, moron brain forgotten all about her fears and reasons for
He smiled and slowly retracted his hand as she let go of his, taking her latte and taking a sip from it. She hummed approvingly and when she lowered the cup she had a latte foam mustache on her upper lip. Steve snorted a little at the sight and she smirked at him before licking it away and taking a bite from her croissant.
They sat like for a long time, any thoughts Steve had had about dinner and watching a movie or whatever were completely forgotten. Because Tony was clearly upset and while he wasn’t crying no one wants to have this kind of talk with a parent. Especially not when it was concerning something that any parent should be absolutely thrilled to hear about; that their child had found that one person they wanted to spend the rest of their life with and was truly happy and in love with.
“Oh, you’d better be paying for this. You made me go out in the rain and now I’m wet and cold and then you threw me-“ Steve just chuckled and pressed a kiss to Tony’s lips, effectively shutting him up. His lips were cold and it did feel a little unpleasant at first, but when Tony started to kiss him back and wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck (also very cold and wet,
Because after having hung around Steve for a few months now, she had learned a lot about him. He was a New Yorker, like her, and he liked sports and art and loved to sit outside and draw or sketch things or people or whatever else had caught his eye. He had a fiery temper and was not afraid to call out anyone who was an asshole or a bully, or throw punches when they refused to listen. But he was also sweet and kind and would gladly help anyone who needed it or asked for it. She had seen him many times helping other students or professors around, either by carrying books or lifting heavy things or get things from high spaces when they couldn't reach it. It was so ridiculously sweet and he was such a boy scout about it, but Toni found it so adorable.
Howard had blown a gasket over Tony falling for the ‘broke, lowly nobody from Brooklyn’ he had met in grade school and that had been the point where he really wanted to disown him, which he eventually did once Tony went to college, moved into a small apartment with Steve and made it very clear he wasn’t going to do whatever Howard wanted him to do with his life, i.e. take over Stark Industries and make weapons like him. Tony, however, had never let that bother him too much. He was young and in love and who was Howard to tell him to live his life anyway? Steve was the best thing that had ever happened to him and Tony would be the biggest moron on this side of the universe if he ever let him go. Jarvis had told him on the day he had graduated college, after Steve had hugged him and kissed him and told him how proud he was of him, that
In shorter terms, Steve hated the guy’s guts, despite having never actually met him, and had told himself it was best for Ty that they never did meet, because he might actually kill him if he did.
, only a few feet away from him and fuck it if Tony was gonna waste another second waiting any longer. He cried out “Steve!” but just that second there was an announcement over the loudspeakers, which kinda drowned out his voice.
Ty and his little lackeys were staring at her, wide eyes and terrified before slowly moving out the way and mutter apologies as she passed them with a cold glare, her green eyes probably drilling into their very souls. And Tony would probably also having terrified of her if he wasn’t so busy slipping away from Ty and run off down the hallway.
"I'll just let you eat your fill. And if you're still hungry there's another one in the fridge. Like I said, we have plenty." Steve smiled gratefully up at him, pulled him close and wrapped his arms around Tony's waist, burying his face in Tony's belly.
“Well, it sure ain’t Camp Delight, that’s for sure.” Clint laughed weakly at the comment, but suddenly looked a little pale.
But thankfully it didn't bruise, but it did hurt a bit even after she had sat with that damn icepack against her face for twenty minutes and her ass got sore from her uncomfortable as fuck chair, so she eventually got up and put it away, washed her hands a bit and decided to go grab a coffee to get a change of scenery. Which, yeah wasn't a very smart move if she wanted to get away from Steve since he worked today, but she needed to get out of the workshop and have some change in scenery.
Tony smiled at him and leaned his head on Steve’s arm. “I’m starving. I didn’t have a big lunch today.” Steve shook his head disapprovingly and scowled at him.
and I’m a year younger than you!” He then held back a shriek when Steve wrapped an arm around his neck and rubbed his knuckles against his head.
Steve looked a little surprised at how forward Tony suddenly was and how quickly he had brushed the whole almost-drowning-thing off, but his smile looked more natural now and he took a step forward.
"Where the hell are we?" Clint eyed the little box they were trapped in. Tony shrugged and placed a hand on Bruce’s shoulder, who had started to look a bit pale. Steve looked out his window and tried to examine the room from his seat.
And so Steve accepted that his friends wanted to celebrate him, though made it clear he wanted to celebrate it in his own way, usually just with a couple of friends, some good food and beers, maybe a few movies. And since Tony always tried to get him super expensive gifts, he made a rule that if his friends wanted to give him gifts, it would have to cost under 100$. It had irked Tony something fierce but Steve was firm on this point, even after he and Tony got together and eventually married.
Natasha glared a little at his tone and how he talked about Tony, but chose not to comment and just nodded and dug her nails into her arms, almost cutting through her shirt and she bit her lip. “Yeah, I can’t help but wonder about that too. Like, it could be war or it could be a trick or it could be literally anything. And while I’m not exactly jumping at the thought of what might be on that camp and the things and people there, it’d probably be light-years safer than here.” Steve nodded and looked down at the floor.
“Yeah, you probably have work to do. It’s a real shame nobody asked for your opinion, though.” Tony’s only response was a frustrated grunt and an attempt to kick him in the groin but only got him in the stomach, which thanks to his abs was rock-hard and Steve hardly felt a thing.
Still, he smiled gratefully at her and took the bottle from her, taking a few deep sips of cool and clear water. And it did help a lot to clear his head a little and also cool him down a little. He handed it back to her with a soft smile. “Thank you, Natasha.” Her frown turned into a very small smile and she patted his shoulder before he went over to Clint and started to talk to him.
“Perhaps it’s designed to keep our heads warm? It does not appear to have any articles for your hair.” Clint and Tony laughed and Thor’s smirk widened a little. Then he turned somber and looked up at the others.
muscles, which not only made him very attractive (not that Tony hadn’t thought he was before, but c’mon, the guy had serious abs and muscles) but also developed a protective streak and would stand up to anyone who tried to hurt or bully Tony or anyone for that matter. Steve had always been an amazing friend, one of Tony’s best friends ever, but after having asked him out and eventually confessed his feelings, he had become the kind of boyfriend that only seemed to exist in those ‘Relationship Goals’ posts he saw on Instagram. But as sappy and lovey-dovey as Steve was, Tony had fallen head over heels in love with him and knew he never wanted to let go of him.
“Yeah, let’s listen to Ms. Bossy-Pants over there!” She glared over at him and Bruce could see that she really wanted to smack him but either restrained herself enough or was to distracted by what was going on around them to actually do it. But Steve bumped his knees against the seat in front of him to get his attention.
“I hate college, Steve. If these exams don’t kill me this insane schedule will! I swear, I’m getting no sleep these days; all I do is study all day and all night! And that's not even mentioning the amount of money I've had to pay for everything! Why the hell did I ever think this was a good idea?” Steve smirked and looked up from his drawing.
He went upstairs to his room afterwards, where Jarvis was just closing his bags and placing them against the wall of his room. He looked up at Tony and smiled softly. "Young sir, I have just finished helping you pack your clothes. I figured I'd let you pack your other things for yourself." His smile turned pityingly. "I assume they have told you the news?"
- who could successfully get him out of these funks, if only for a short moment at a time. And while he had learned when to back off when Steve said no and didn’t push until Steve lashed out- that had happened once or twice and Tony knew Steve desperately didn’t want to hurt anyone, least of all him- Steve had a certain weakness for Tony. That’s not to say that he always agreed, sometimes he just wanted to be left alone, with Jarvis playing music he recognized from his time or movies from his time and maybe eat some ice cream or candy while doing it.
Steve rolled his eyes and refilled the coffee machine with beans. “There’s nothing to ask, Sam. We’re just friends.” Sam rolled his eyes back and shook his head, muttering something about ‘
“Feeling sappy today, are we Rogers? Well, I appreciate it.” He got onto his toes and pressed a kiss to Steve’s cheek. “Thank you, honey. This was perfect, just what I needed.”
“Nah man, you’re on your own. Quite frankly you’ve only got yourself to blame here.” Tony narrowed his eyes at their friends and glared at them as they passed them.
He straightened up and rubbed the back of his neck a bit sheepishly. “Oh. Uh, yeah. I’m here on vacation with my friends.” He pointed over at the guy behind Tony, who Tony had kinda forgotten about despite his hand on his back. The guy was also pretty buff, only a few inches or so shorter and had shaggy, shoulder-long hair and dark blue eyes. He smiled wryly and removed his hand from Tony’s back.
“Well, Clint and Natasha were called in by Fury. Some top-secret mission he wanted them to get to ASAP. Thor is on a date with Jane while she’s in town and Bruce is on a seminar about radiation biology and its implications, so…” He placed his hands on Tony’s waist with a sweet smile on his face. “since it’s just the two of us, I wanted to spoil you a little.” He pressed a soft yet lingering kiss on Tony’s forehead, then his nose and then his mouth.
His voice got stuck in his throat and he barely got the words out. But he’d gotten this far, he might as well get it out in the open at this point. He chocked back tears and tried to breathe deep and braced himself. “But I… really,
Still, that didn’t mean he didn’t have bad days. Days when he’d wake up from nightmares about the ice, the dark cold surrounding him and leaving him unable to breathe. Nightmares of Bucky falling off the train and to his death in the mountains, just barely missing Steve’s hand trying to catch him and save him. Or dreams of Peggy and how his life could’ve looked like if he hadn’t been forced to fly the Valkyrie into the ice and had been able to try to have a life with her. Or if he’d just been able to live in the 40’s if the war had never happened at all. Maybe he could’ve just gone to art school, gotten a job drawing comics or something, met a dame and they could’ve had a simple life together. No fighting in a war, no super-soldier serum, no crashing into the ice and being thawed out against his will several decades later. No being forced to live in a world that wasn’t his anymore. And after he woke up from these dreams or nightmares, the dark thoughts barging in uninvited into his brain and wouldn’t leave him alone, sometimes for days on end.
"7pm, Rogers. Don't be late." She then waved a quick goodbye at Sam and then walked out of the Starbucks without another word or look back at Steve. It wasn't until she walked for a minute or so and was far enough away from store so no one could see her that she realized what she had just done.
