"Certainly." Stone -- Tiberius -- smiled at him again.
Steve has to ask the question. "How did you know?"
He takes a shaking breath and tries to push that thought away.
The kitchen was empty, all right. Empty of everyone except Tony.
Steve moaned against Tony's mouth. He felt as if his body had gone to water, to clay, something that could be shaped and reshaped as Tony wanted it, to feel what Tony wanted him to feel. Need swept through him, a rush of arousal that was nearly overwhelming in his intensity, and he clutched Tony to him, seeking more, seeking everything that Tony's lips promised.
Steve doesn't know any of them.
There was no way to out Tiberius that wouldn't also out Tony.
"I had a lot of reasons," Tony said. His voice was hoarse, rasping, dismal. "Don't know if any of them were any good, really, but I thought they were. I figured it wasn't ever going to come up. It's not like I've been with-- with a lot of men." Steve wasn't sure what Tony's definition of
Tony chuckled. "You got me there."
"I love you," Steve gasps. "I love you so much, Tony, you're so good at that, you're perfect, oh, I'm going to--"
"Nah." Tony shook his head. "I want to try your book first. Maybe I'll call him in the morning. But this sounds like a good idea. Hit me."
"Oh, God, no!" Tony said quickly, sounding almost horrified. "Obviously I want Captain America." There was an awkward pause, during which Steve assumed Tony was regretting saying that about as much as Steve was regretting hearing it, but for the opposite reason. "I mean," Tony continued, a little strained, "I'd hate for Iron Man's biggest fan to be deprived of the Iron Man mug, of course." He gave Steve a smile. It was the same one he used for reporters. Steve wasn't sure if Tony had meant for him to notice that. Probably not.
"If it makes you feel any better," Tony offered, with a wry twist of his lips, "I spent a whole lot more of my life living in fear of what you might think of. Uh. Another one of my secrets."
He didn't need to spell it out.
. And that's... it's hard to take. God, that sounds awful, doesn't it?"
Tony was, of course, trying to get the IV out himself, but he still didn't have enough coordination even to get the tape off, and he obligingly let go when Steve tugged at his hand. Figuring he might as well get it all done now, Steve gently peeled off all the electrodes, head to toe. Tony was definitely going to need to wash his hair to get the paste out. Steve was rubbing intently at the remnants of the electrode adhesive on Tony's cheekbone, before he realized he was still holding Tony's hand, and his face went hot. He needed to stop doing that. Touching Tony like that. He knew it was unwelcome -- or, at least, it would have been unwelcome had Tony known everything Steve felt for him, and that worked out to the same thing.
"So the point of all this," Tony said, "is that Donahue thinks that Ty thinks it was suicide. The point of all this, according to Donahue, is that Ty somehow blames
," Steve returns. "I care about
He has to.
"A little sore," Tony calls back. "But I'll live. Don't you worry."
"Of course," Steve says, grateful for the reprieve. He knows it's taking a lot out of Tony to ask for this. He shouldn't have had to. Steve knows what he wants.
," Steve blurts out, stupidly. It's probably not the first thing he should have thought of. He's sure the rest of it will hit him eventually. His face is hot. No wonder Iron Man had been trying so hard not to laugh. "You must think I'm such an idiot. Oh, God, I tried to give money to
Tony shouldn't have been here. The program definitely hadn't aired yet. Was he mad about something else?
Steve's just going to have to live with it.
"You like that?" Tony murmured. He paused to rake his fingers over Steve's ass, to feel the way his warm skin was stippled, ever so paradoxically, with goosebumps. Steve shuddered when Tony dug three fingertips into one of the darker marks.
"Tony, I can't possibly ask you to--"
"Yes?" Mr. Stark's voice is muffled, bland.
tell me it wasn't Ultron either."
"Looks like you think so too, huh?" Tony says, softly, gently. He's not teasing him, not the way he says it. He's kind. He's always kind.
But Tony stood his ground. He lifted his head high. It was a stance Steve had seen on him for a decade, standing on a battlefield before all hell broke loose, ready and waiting, weapons hot:
Tony's eyes followed the slide of Steve's hand, and when Steve stopped, Tony's gaze slid slowly back up Steve's body. Tony wasn't ogling him in any obvious way -- nothing so blatant as the way Steve had been eyeing the very visible signs of Tony's arousal -- but the focused intensity of it, the passion in his eyes, spoke to the fact that Tony was definitely appreciating him thoroughly. Steve felt hot all over, in an entirely more pleasant way this time.
"Is there good news?"
Maybe it's strange to offer this. Maybe Iron Man will decline. But Steve just feels so helpless.
is a bit of a misnomer, because Ghost has none. He's clad head-to-toe in featureless white armor, and his face is fully obscured. His body bristles with technology Steve can't identify, wires wrapped around his belt, running to various devices. No wonder he's one of Tony's villains. This sure isn't Steve's usual sort of mission.
, Tony thought, as he crashed to the floor.
Iron Man's laugh now is a startled one, like he hadn't expected Steve to make him laugh at all. "You boo the Yankees, Winghead, and we don't make it out of the stadium alive."
After that, of course, was the dinner-and-philanthropy portion of the evening, as Tony went from table to table and made nice with the glitterati. The Avengers, of course, were expected to do the same, on a smaller scale. Steve found himself seated next to an older couple who had an interest in art, so they spent a companionable ten minutes discussing Mark Rothko before the woman leaned in avidly and put a hand on his arm.
The word sticks in Steve's brain, snagging the edge of a very painful memory, a fingernail catching in a rough thread. The Vault. The Guardsmen. Tony knocked him out with a negator. That was what he'd called it. Left him paralyzed but conscious. Just like this.
Steve waited, but Tony didn't say anything more. Tony just blew out a breath, tipped his head gingerly against the back of the couch, and stared up at the ceiling.
"What?" Steve asked, confused.
Consciousness was a dry mouth, a fuzzy brain, and a rhythmic beeping noise.
"I like fire trucks too," Iron Man agrees. "They're red. Red's my favorite color."
"You sure don't make it easy on a guy, do you?" Tony murmurs, under his breath, but he sounds ridiculously fond when he says it.
"I did." Tony sounded hopeful, encouraging.
He was starting to worry.
Steve snorted and took a step back. "That's awfully confident coming from someone who hasn't yet landed a-- oof!"
Steve's sex life is his own. What Steve likes to do in bed is not the business of anyone Steve isn't sleeping with. And, for the most part, Steve has succeeded in keeping it to himself. People just... don't ask him. It's like they assume Captain America doesn't even exist in the same world as sex. The very idea of him being kinky is somehow unthinkable. It used to frustrate Steve. But now he's grateful, in a way, for that kind of invisibility. No one's going to press him about anything.
The fingers blurred and doubled. "Um. Not six?"
"Yeah, them."
"So I went up to see him," Tony began. "I told him I was breaking up with him. I told him I knew the truth. I told him exactly what I'd told you, what Donahue had told me. How Ty must have blamed me all these years for his father's death." Tony was starting to shake again. "And he-- he laughed at me. He told me that wasn't the real truth."
He didn't know what else to say. He'd always made this worse too; hadn't he proved that?
This is a message. Tony's trying to tell him something.
"I want to." Iron Man's voice is soft. He sounds like there's something else he wants to say, some other reason he wants to give that would discourage Steve, but when he speaks again, he must have changed his mind. "My God, Cap--
Tiberius had Tony backed up against the kitchen island, one knee pressed between Tony's thighs. Tony's jeans were undone, threatening to slide off his hips, exposing a large amount of gorgeously bare skin and a glimpse of skimpy, satiny underwear that Steve had no right to see. Tiberius had an arm wrapped around Tony's back, holding him close. His other hand was at Tony's waist, starting to slide up and under the bottom edge of Tony's t-shirt; one of Tony's hands was encircling Tiberius' wrist, undoubtedly caressing him, surely urging him on.
No one had ever really liked him running his mouth off in bed. Too sweet, they always said. Too sweet and too much, like Steve was some kind of decadent dessert they'd ordered at a restaurant and wanted to send back to the kitchen. Usually he tried to tone it down, but, well, he'd wanted Tony so much. It had all just... happened.
Tony didn't want him.
Like him, like so many other superheroes, Carol was ex-military. And she'd spent an awful lot of her life handling classified information. That meant, Steve realized belatedly, that she wasn't going to get upset if there was something he wasn't telling her. He'd said he couldn't tell her. Therefore, she wasn't cleared for this. So she was just... accepting it.
The thing is, it isn't supposed to be
Steve was looking wildly around the room -- like he was hoping the box was out here, Tony realized belatedly, as his mind churned sluggishly away. He couldn't think. God, he
Then the covers rustle and Tony turns around. Steve's eyelashes flicker. He's in REM sleep. He's probably dreaming. He looks like he's having a bad dream. He looks like he's going to be able to wake up soon. The spell has clearly worn off -- that part of it, at least.
Slowly, Steve nodded. "I'm as okay as I'll ever be," he said, and he knew that wasn't the best answer. "I just-- I just wanted you to know that you weren't alone. That none of it was your fault." He thought Tony had probably expected him to judge him. He thought that Tony had probably thought he'd never understand. Like how he'd been about the drinking. It was probably a fair assumption. Steve had earned that.
It was almost, but not quite, an open floor plan; the more public areas of the suite -- living room, kitchen, office -- were separated from each other by little walls that ran about half the width of the huge long room, a nice trade-off between demarcating areas and showing off the space. Tony's bedroom and bathroom, however, had solid walls and closed doors between them and the rest of the place.
But Tony was silent, his brow starting to furrow.
Somehow Tony's eyes went even wider. "He's not my boyfriend!" Tony said, practically tripping over the sentence in his haste, and Steve felt every word like a punch, one devastating body-blow after another. "No-- Steve's not-- I'd never-- we're just good friends."
That sounded good. That would be something to do. He could finally help Tony. Steve nodded. "Sure. I'd like to do that."
Mr. Stark tilts his head to the side, mouth gone slack in astonishment. "It
After a few seconds, the helmet quivers; Tony nods fractionally.
Steve cries, pressing his face against Tony's leg, staining his pants with tears.
That was a no, then. Steve took his hand away.
The debriefing itself is mercifully brief, and Steve is on edge the entire time; he needs to find out if Iron Man is all right.
Tony's jeans undone, practically hanging off his hips, barely exposing a tantalizing glimpse of everything beneath--
His head snaps up and he meets Steve's gaze, anguish in his eyes.
Steve licked his lips. "No," he said, and that definitely wasn't a great start. "I can't say that. I-- I know you've made mistakes." He sure wasn't getting any better. "But I wouldn't take out a full-page newspaper ad listing your mistakes."
Jaw clenched, Steve was sitting ramrod-straight in his chair. He looked like he was preparing himself to withstand torture. He still wasn't quite looking at Tony. God. Maybe it was something bad after all.
He'd made it worse. He was always making it worse.
The suit itself could have belonged to a lot of men -- well, a lot of men who owned expensive suits -- but Steve was pretty sure most of those men didn't wear them with ties printed with the molecular structure of caffeine. It had to be Tony.
Tony started laughing. "Okay, okay," he said. "I'll put some pants on and take you out."
Maybe by then he'd have thought of something to say.
Tony opened his eyes, which were already a little watery -- God, he'd been starting to tear up -- and blinked at him twice before lifting his head. Steve could feel him breathe and relax, and then Tony pulled off entirely, grinning an uncertain grin and licking the tip of Steve's cock, then a little lower, his tongue swiping just under the head of Steve's cock, where he was the most sensitive -- and Steve knew he was almost undone. Even with the condom, this wasn't going to take long.
Tony grinned at him. "Then that's what I'll do."
Then Steve's stomach growled.
you. So much." He's sure Iron Man can hear all the yearning in him.
"No, uh," Tony manages to say. "No, thank you. I'm not hungry."
Tony's smile was brilliant, and then he took a breath like he was steeling himself to say something. "I'd really like to go down on you. If you'd like that."
"Topping you's not going to be a hardship," Tony said, as firmly as he could, and something in Steve's gaze softened. He could see Steve responding to him. Trusting him. "I have, let's just say, a fair amount of experience. And I've already seen your gear, so I also have a good idea of what you want."
"You don't have to tell me," Steve said, softly. "You don't. It's your secret to keep. I understand." But Tony could tell from the glimmer of hope in his eyes that he wanted to know. Of course he did.
There's a few seconds of silence, and again Steve wonders if he's presumed too much.
Tony groans with pleasure, a low, drawn-out sound from deep in his chest, lower than speech, all instinct. It's not exactly sexual, but it's not exactly
Tony's fingers skimmed over Steve's jawline. "Hey, it's okay," he murmured. "Everything's okay, Winghead." He smiled. "I'm listening. Maurice." He said it right this time. "Rich guy. Secretly gay. Go on."
But Tony's dropping so hard that he can't make that decision. He's not thinking clearly. And obviously when he's like this, he's not going to sacrifice Steve. He's not capable of it. And Steve doesn't know if he can change Tony's mind, but he has to try.
That was how Tiberius had done it, wasn't it? Just enough praise to keep Tony hungry for it, to make him do anything to get more. And then he could do whatever he wanted. It wasn't like Tiberius hadn't known Tony. He'd known it would work. And it had.
He might not be able to hear Ghost's heartbeat, but that doesn't mean Ghost isn't audible. A baseline human wouldn't have been able to hear him, but Steve still can. Ghost's armor has obviously dampened his heartbeat, and it's just as obviously been designed to be as soundless as possible -- but he can't be completely silent.
Steve steps back. He tugs his mail shirt down, just to give himself something to do with his hands that's not
Too slow. He's spitting phlegm and blossoms down the inside of his mask, out the mouth-slit. When he wrenches his helmet off, he sees that they're roses again, white this time.
"Was that okay?" Steve barely recognized his own voice, low and gravelly, hoarse with desire. Dazed, he licked his lips; he could still taste Tony. He almost couldn't believe that had really happened. Something inside him was unbalanced, hungry for reassurance. "I, uh. I've never kissed a man before."
Tony slid his fingers out now and Steve gave a wordless grumble of dismay and disagreement.
Oh. It's something good after all. "You like that?" Steve asks, uncertain.
was, but he also knew it was definitely not his place to ask. "I was never hiding anyone from you. It-- it wasn't like that."
The popcorn is done; Steve can hear it rattling into the bowl. Iron Man picks up the bowl, and Steve can see the metal of his helmet glint as he turns around. Steve loses sight of him again as he weaves his way through the maze of machines and armor, but of course Steve can still hear his footsteps as he walks--
"Well, I'm right here," Steve says, with a reassuring smile. He sets the towels at the foot of the bed and holds out the washcloth. "And I brought you this. Nice and cool. I thought maybe you'd feel better if you got to wipe your face off."
"Mmm," the man said. "Not my problem."
At least he doesn't have to cut Tony out of this, thank God. But even when Tony's arms are freed, he still doesn't move them; he just lets them hang limply behind his back, like his brain thinks he's still bound. His wrists cross.
Eager, he opens the door before Iron Man even knocks; Steve catches him in the act, one gauntleted fist raised in the air.
"No, obviously you couldn't," Walders assured him. "We're very grateful for your support."
He didn't know. Thank God. Steve still had his secret, although it was bewildering him that Tiberius had kept it.
He couldn't lie. And he could never lie to Tony. Which was going to be a problem if Tony ever figured out Steve's secret. But Tony wasn't going to, because Tony didn't want Steve, so as long as Steve could avoid being blatantly obvious, the truth would never come out, so to speak.
SHIELD gets there in under ten minutes. Tony's got his helmet on again by then, and he hangs back, behind Steve, keeping quiet. Steve is happy to talk to SHIELD; he works with them often enough anyway, and honestly Tony and SHIELD haven't really been on great terms since the last time they tried to make Tony make weapons again, back when Nick was still running it. And that was back when Tony was drinking. It was, in fact, why Tony was drinking. Of course, most of the agents don't know why Iron Man would be taking any of that personally, but SHIELD's ruined Iron Man's life too -- the mess with Tony's technology comes all too readily to mind.
"I don't--" Steve began to say, and then he stopped, because, Jesus, he'd never thought of that before, and he could
"But I
He shook the box again, hopeful for more answers. It sounded like there was only that one metal object left, banging against the sides. Given everything else here, he was more than a little surprised that there wasn't a collar -- but, well, sometimes people had very specific beliefs about those.
That's another one of those things Steve's pretty sure Tony would never have admitted in a normal state of mind. It's also something Steve's really glad to hear.
Now Tony was staring at him again, but he was staring at Steve like Steve had forgotten something incredibly obvious. "Of course I can," he said. He didn't sound arrogant or archly superior. He just sounded, once again, kind. As if, most of all, he wanted to help. Because he did. "I absolutely can. I thought I'd already-- I guess I must not have, huh?" He smiled a very small smile, and then he took a breath and started the explanation from the beginning. "Steve, I've got my own personal dictation software on all my computers. Better than the commercially-available stuff. Coded it myself. Probably right after the time I broke my hand, actually. It just never occurred to me that you'd want it -- or need it -- but I can absolutely install it on your account, if you think it'd be useful. I have admin rights; I can do it remotely. You don't need to do anything. I can do it right after breakfast, if you want. It needs to be trained to recognize your voice, but I have enough of your mission comms chatter saved in the mainframe that I can do that part, too. And then you can dictate all your reports."
The crowd clapped politely while Tony held out a hand to the assembled Avengers. The lights glinted off the mail of Steve's armored shirt.
He didn't know if Carol knew what to look for. He didn't know enough about her past to know if she'd had any of the same experiences Tony had had, and he didn't want to think about the kinds of experiences that he knew for a fact that she'd had being relevant. He didn't want Tiberius to be another Marcus. Not that it was up to him. And, of course, he couldn't tell her any of this.
And, even better, Steve is obviously well on his way to joining him. Steve usually wears a cup under his uniform to avoid embarrassing accidents, but the Phoenix Force's fashion makeover seems to have had no such polite niceties. Steve is... yeah, Steve is definitely packing some serious heat.
And the thing was, it was working. It was really,
Steve still can't actually move without pain, but if he only has to shift over an inch or two to stop making contact, he can do that. He's got to.
, a bleak corner of Steve's mind suggested,
"Beautiful," Tony says, like Steve is a sculpture or a painting. "There you go. I know it's hard. You're always so stubborn. Just be here. Just like that."
"Oh, yeah?" Tony said. The repulsors were at 85% charge and rising. Time to see if he could bait Mordo into a good lengthy monologue. "Try me."
Steve wonders what in the world Iron Man's life has been like.
"What do you want, Steve?"
good, much faster than he'd wanted.
But it wasn't like he could fight this fear with logic. He'd tried. And he was still here. In a mask.
"But--"
"Yeah," Tony said. His gaze was faraway. "Yeah, it does. Not sure how it's going to feel when it heals up and scars over all the way, but it's been a mess under here for a good month and a half. I notice it more when I'm stressed. So, as you can imagine, I've felt absolutely great this week." Tony half-smiled. "For a while now, I've been picturing everything I thought you were going to say when you found out. Thought of a lot of different ways this would go. Never expected that the first question was going to be whether it hurt."
It's Steve's move now.
That's not just permission -- that's encouragement. And that's also Tony, once again, telling him it's perfectly fine to enjoy himself. That Tony wants him to. Now Steve's the one who needs to hear it again, he supposes. It's good to hear.
"I thought you were going to be easy to defeat," Tiberius said, his words smarting with resentment. "But you were a genius. You were a shy, sensitive, over-emotional, effeminate wreck of a human being, but you were still a genius. And I knew, if I didn't do something, you were going to win. You were going to win everything. And you did win. You won all the time, and you were still so
He was woolgathering. He was wasting time that Tony didn't have. He needed to do something.
"Iron Man?" Jan's tinny voice asks, and Steve looks down and sees Tony's armored picture in his palm. Dammit. He answered the wrong card. When he's about to come he gets so damn
Steve had no idea what to say. "I'm sorry."
you get the plug."
"It's not your fault." Tony sighed, heavily. "I'll admit that this is definitely not the model I would have picked for myself, but I didn't exactly have a choice. So."
"Then close your eyes."
Steve looks down at the mess of petals in the sink and back up at Tony. Tony watches his throat work, watches him realize that he knows just how far along Tony is in the progression of the disease, watches him try to figure out how diplomatic he should be, if he should tell him--
What would Mr. Stark have thought of
Stephen's voice is -- well, it's substantially calmer than his. "I've got something. But you're not going to like it."
make an offer like that. That Steve shouldn't actually trust him.
Tony is
"Going to hurt a little, sorry, sweetheart," Tony said. nimbly holding the splint in place with one hand while reaching for the other elastic bandages to secure the splint.
Three down, four to go. Tony rose to his feet, leaving the box behind him on the bed, and started to pace across the room. He always thought better when he was on the move. Maybe he should go flying. He looked out at the twilit sky. This was a really stupid reason to go flying.
The good news was that the police had both managed to clear the building of civilians and set up a perimeter by the time the Avengers showed up on the scene.
Tony's speech to Tiberius had been brave, all right, but it looked like he'd been more affected by the insults than he'd let on. Which was perfectly understandable, because Tiberius had really done a number on him. Tiberius had had his whole life to figure out exactly what actions would break Tony, what words would be the most malicious and efficient. And then he'd done it. All of it.
"I don't think you get what you want," Tony said, softly. "Not a lot. I think you think that as long as you're not visibly suffering, it's okay." He licked his lips; he seemed to be choosing his words with care. "I pay attention to you. When someone offers you something, you'll take it if it's close enough to what you really want. You probably tell yourself no one gets everything they want. Life's not fair. Why ask for
Steve breathed in and out and tried to focus. "I don't blame
"Hey!" Steve said, only a little indignant. "No fair!"
He's sitting in the tower's common area, lights dimmed, watching the sun go down, watching the city's nighttime lights come up, another paean to technology, and he thinks about what he can delete.
Tony laughed and then wished he hadn't. His gut spasmed in agony and he bit back a scream. More tears trickled down his face. He was a mess. This wasn't exactly the way he'd ever dreamed Steve would find out the truth.
He doesn't know how much time has passed, but Tony's touching his hair again, praising him more. "So very good," Tony whispers. "All mine. All you have to do is this. No decisions. No hard choices. Just be mine. Do this for me."
Steve slid his first two fingers over the inside of Tony's wrist until he found the spot. Tony's pulse was a little fast -- understandably so -- but it was strong and regular. Steve supposed that the artificial heart pumped blood just like any other. The uneasiness that had been within Steve slowly settled. Tony was all right. He'd made it.
Steve remembers wondering why anyone would give a damn about Iron Man's private medical business. He still doesn't think anyone should give a damn about Tony Stark's, either, but he understands that the gossip-hungry public would pounce on this tidbit, if they ever found it out. Steve's certainly not planning on telling anyone.
Steve hated to admit it, but he could see where Tony was coming from.
Steve frowned. "I taste like--"
Yep. That was the Avengers alert. Of all the goddamn times.
But Steve also knew what it looked like when someone was getting hit. He'd seen his own mother wear long sleeves and high collars. He'd heard her tell stories, too fast, too casually, about accidents. Falling down.
"I know you feel terrible," Steve said, and he hoped this was right. "I know you do. And you're telling me you want to drink. But that's-- that's a feeling. It's a lousy feeling, and maybe it's a feeling that'll be with you for a long time, maybe some days more than others, and I know that's lousy too. It's not fair, none of it. But the thing is, it's not an action. It's just a feeling. It's just wanting. Which doesn't mean it's not bad or it's not serious or it doesn't hurt. It's an upsetting, distressing kind of wanting for you to feel. I get that. But it's not a thing you're actually doing. Today you're not drinking. In my book, in anyone's book, that's a victory. They're two different things, the wanting and the doing. It doesn't make you wrong, or bad, or weak, or flawed, or-- or whatever you're telling yourself you are, to want something you know you shouldn't have. It just makes you someone who wants something. That's it." He met Tony's gaze. "I know you don't believe in God, Tony. So it seems awful cruel of you to believe you're a sinner. Because then who can forgive you? And if the answer's
"I know," Tony said. "I know I couldn't have known. But I-- I-- do you have any idea what I
So much for their quiet evening together.
Tiberius' return to consciousness was less obvious than Tony's. It reminded Steve of how, back in the war, he'd learned to wake silently. To keep his eyes shut. To not give anything away. There was a little hitch in Tiberius' breath and his eyes fell shut; anyone watching him might have thought he'd fallen asleep as soon as Tony had removed the headset.
"Oh," Ghost says, surprised. "You're new here." He sits back in his chair. His head tilts up; on Tony, Steve would call that gesture
"Or I could keep you warm right now," Steve offered. "Even better than just thinking about it. So I hear."
But Tony was already gone. Steve was alone.
He'd told Steve when Beth had left him; oh, he hadn't been specific with names, because he hadn't wanted anything to connect Iron Man and Tony Stark, but Steve definitely knew he was single. But Steve wasn't single.
," Steve gasped. Oh, yeah, Tony had it. "That right there. So good. Just like that, Tony, that'll do me just fine, just keep doing that. And you could, if you wanted--?"
," Tony said, with a smile, "but I really liked it from
"The only people these jackals are listening to anymore are each other," Jan spat out. "It's an echo chamber. I'm not saying we should stoop to their level, but I think we should meet them where they are. They won't stop if we just hold a press conference defending Tony and Iron Man. They don't care about our press conferences." Her jaw was set, like she was getting ready to step onto the battlefield. "I say we go on one of their shows, one of us. We're Avengers. We've got the truth on our side. We beat them at their own game."
His jaw was quivering now, his eyes were suspiciously reflective, and so Tony leaned over and nudged him as gently as anyone in a several-hundred-pound suit of armor could manage.
For some reason, Tony was grinning more broadly, as if something about that terrible time was making him happy to think about. "I'm just saying," he murmured. "The just thing would have been to turn me in. The noble thing would have been to step back and let me die a free man. The thing you did, Steve? The thing you did was
Iron Man twists his fingers together in his lap. "It's hard to explain, and I know you won't believe me, but... people would care, if they found out about this. People would think less of me. I know you wouldn't -- at least, I hope you wouldn't -- but everyone else would. I know they would."
not okay. I don't think I've ever been."
Tony starts talking, and he's giving it all away. "Lowercase E." The keyboard clicks, metal on metal. At least it's probably a secure password, Steve thinks. But that sure doesn't matter when you're giving it up at gunpoint, does it? Steve doesn't bother opening his eyes. "Capital G." Another click. "The number one." Click. "At sign." Click. "The number zero." Click. "Lowercase D." Click. "Capital E." Click. Tony pauses.
"You heard what I said, then," Tony said, seeming to pick his way delicately through the words. "About how I'd talked to Trevor Donahue, and how he'd made a strong argument for the theory that Ty had resented me for years because my father's business practices drove his father to suicide. I told you I was going to confront Ty with the truth."
It was going to be a couple minutes for the water to boil. Steve walked back around the kitchen counter, then boosted himself up to sit on the other edge of it, facing Tony and the position he'd staked out several feet away on the couch. Tony regarded him with a certain amount of wary interest.
It was the truth, but it felt like a lie.
Tony ran his fingers through his hair again and glanced away. He wasn't looking at Steve. "Steve, I, uh." His throat worked. "Obviously I can't deny I have, uh, feelings for you. I wasn't planning on telling you that, either, but I guess you've figured that out now, huh?" His face flushed again, and this time it was clearly embarrassment, and now Steve really had no idea what was going on. Then Tony looked up and met his gaze. "Steve, you mean the world to me, and I'm-- I'm really flattered, but--"
Tony's nostrils flare. "Do you know why you're in that uniform? Do you know why you're not an Avenger? Do you know why you tortured those men?" He stabs a finger in the air. "Because you decided to. You're the one who put on that uniform. You're the one who picked up those guns."
Steve doesn't move. He's curled on the hardwood floor. Tony could kick him, if he wanted to. Steve can picture it.
Like he thought he was still dreaming.
Tony wasn't doing any of that. Sure, he was covering his chest and buttoning his shirts up to the collar -- and, oddly, touching his chest a lot lately -- but all that buttoning-up had been happening since the Sentient Armor. That hadn't been Tiberius. Tony was wearing short sleeves right now. There were no bruises dotting his wrists or ringing his throat in a handprint. He wasn't nervy. He wasn't jumpy. And he was a working superhero. He got banged up on a daily basis. He was probably still sore from going toe to toe with Radioactive Man last night. If Steve asked him about an injury, the story would be real. He wasn't getting hit. Steve was pretty sure that someone used to hit Tony once -- God, he never wanted to think about that, he'd tried never to think about who or why or how often -- but no one was hitting Tony now. Tiberius was a monster, all right, but he wasn't that kind of monster.
Surprised, Steve turned halfway around; Tony had stepped back, head tilted, shrugging. His smile was small, a self-deprecating little quirk of his lips.
And telling Tony that he should have known Steve would be okay with it because he should have remembered Steve had a hell of a lot of gay friends was just going to be
"I-- I guess?" Steve said, still dubious, trying to think it through.
Steve presses the switch. He isn't quite sure what he expected to happen, but none of his expectations were adequate to the experience of watching the golden metal of Tony's sleeve suddenly sag limply, then detach from the shoulder of his armor and begin to retract into the cuff the same way that the gauntlet had. It's like a magic trick, except it's not a trick at all.
Steve wonders what kind of life Iron Man has had.
, and then you put on, what, easily a hundred pounds of armor, and you ran up two flights of stairs--"
Right now, he just wants to know if there's anything else he can do for Tony. He thinks Tony is probably close to done for the night.
Tony waits. This is his penance. He sits and he waits, while the Sorcerer Supreme knits his probably-former best friend's mind back together.
"You're here at my apartment," Steve said, desperate, because if he could just find the right words, the right thing to say, the thing Tony would believe-- "You're here, and Tiberius has never been here. He doesn't know what it looks like, or-- or where it is--"
Steve might not have liked the guy much -- and that was an understatement -- but that didn't mean he wanted to see Tiberius
doesn't have a tenth of Tony Stark's charm either, because he's staring at Steve like Steve's just smacked him in the face with his shield.
Steve made a very quiet snorting sound. "Oh, is
"Me?" Iron Man hisses out another laugh. "You're sweet, Cap. I wouldn't say I'm all that interesting, though. I'm just a guy in a tin can."
Tony's mouth twisted. "And
? In how long?"
"Are you going to tell me what you know?" Steve repeats. "Are you going to let me in on whatever the deep dark secret is that you think will ruin Iron Man for me forever? Where's your list of reasons, Mr. Stark?" He can feel his mouth twitching, twisting, trying to smile. It's not a nice smile. "You know what they say, right?
The terrible, perverse thought enters his head: he knows how to remove Iron Man's helmet. He's pretty sure he knows where the releases are. He could do it, right now. Iron Man's asleep. He might not even wake up. And Steve could see his face. And he'd
Steve finds himself grinning as he lines up his next throw -- if his shield can carom off that streetlight there, he should be able to hit Zemo from behind, and the guy will never know what took him down.
He looks up and finds that Tony is smiling. "Keep breathing, Winghead," he murmurs. "You've got this. You've got me."
And maybe that was too much, because Iron Man does step back at that, and Steve can see him blinking in wonder. "And you're too kind," he says, finally, like he's discarded several possible responses before settling on that one.
the fish, with portions sized for his metabolism. That was just how Tony was. He never forgot the little things.
Maybe they should have planned the scene out more, because Tony was rapidly running out of the physical capacity to land heavy blows. In fact, he was pretty much done with that. But Steve needed more. They both did. They needed something else. Tony was flying on instinct here, but, hell, he hadn't gone wrong yet. "Well, you're nicely bruised-up," he said. "So maybe I'm done hurting you." But before Steve's face could fall, he added. "This is the really fun part. The part where
"You see that, outside?" Steve rasped. "It's over. You're going to pay for everything you've done. They're here for you."
"I'm glad," Steve murmured. "Me too." He could feel himself slipping closer to sleep. "Hey, am I allowed to sleep like this? With a concussion?"
Steve pauses. "What is
And then he jumps and jerks his hands away as the comm crackles. "Cap," Hank asks. "Everything okay?"
The call disconnects. A few seconds later, Tony smells sulfur, and then Stephen's standing next to him, with his Cloak and his Eye and his stupid red-and-black footie pajamas.
Surprised, Tony lost his balance entirely and tipped to the floor in a noisy collision of metal and linoleum. He yelped.
Steve forced another smile. "Okay. See you later, Warbird."
," he said, incredulous.
"Breathe," he reminds Tony, and Tony obligingly takes a huge breath. "When was the last time anyone worked you over like this, Shellhead? You're all twisted up."
"My father had mostly stopped hitting me by then," Tony said, his voice gone flat and remote, and Steve knew Tony wouldn't have told him this, ever, if the past thirty seconds hadn't happened. "I was big enough that I could have hit him back, you see. Not that I ever did." His mouth thinned. "He threw a rocks glass at my head that time, though. That might have been the last time he hurt me. Don't remember. That was a mess. Glass shattered. Blood everywhere." His fingers went to the side of his head, probing his scalp. "Used to still have the scars. Huh. Guess I didn't come back with those."
He still has one hand in Tony's hair; with his other hand he unfastens his belt, undoes his pants, and pulls his cock out, giving himself an encouraging stroke. He doesn't need a lot of encouragement. He's already aching for it. He hears himself groan again.
"Hey!" the guard called again, yelling after him, but he wasn't actually trying to stop Steve anymore, so it didn't matter. Nothing other than Tony mattered. "You go up there, and I'm calling the police!"
"I've got one question," Tony said.
In any other situation, Steve would probably have been upset with Tony for that, or at the very least annoyed, but he didn't seem to be capable of having even one more distinct feeling right now. It all blended into a formless sorrow, a palette with every single color mixed together into muddy near-black.
He kissed his way down Steve's chest, down his stomach, fingers tracing over the muscles of Steve's abdomen with a kind of reverence. Not because it was Steve's perfect, Rebirth-given body, but because it was Steve. He knew the difference.
"Did I already tell you you're unreal?" Tony murmured. "I think I did."
Oh, geez. Yeah, Tony could see how a nude revue wouldn't have been Steve's kind of thing at all. But the thing was, it wasn't really Tony's kind of thing either, although certainly it was the sort of thing someone with his reputation would have been expected to enjoy. The mask and the man beneath weren't the same at all.
touch him, couldn't he?
Okay. Well. Steve doesn't know what to do except go on from here. He gets up, pours himself a cup of orange juice and a bowl of cereal, and carries them both back to the table.
The woman startles. Her eyes dart over to Tony; she's obviously hoping that he'll explain. But Tony doesn't.
If he was wrong, he was going to feel supremely stupid. But he didn't think he was wrong.
"Just like I like it," Tony says, and somehow Steve is even redder.
"Iron Man?" Steve asks, and Iron Man pauses and turns halfway around. "You have a minute?"
Steve frowns as he pushes the door shut behind Iron Man, then steps back and takes one of Iron Man's gauntleted hands between his own. The metal is still warm, once again. He thinks he'll be delighted by that forever.
"Hey!" Tony interjected, because someone here had to stand up for Steve and apparently it wasn't going to be Steve. "I think that sounds like a great time, actually."
Unimpressed, Fury just stared back at him.
Jan pursed her lips. "Probably," she began. "It's also probably mostly what you think it is, although to be fair, I thought the part where Carol and Simon were together now was a bit of a surprise--"
Did Tony not get it? Did he really not get it?
"I can't," he rasped. His eyes stung. His face was hot. "I can't talk about it, Carol. I'm sorry."
And Tony, unfortunately, was there to bear witness to the look on Steve's face when he realized that Tony wasn't going to make it after all. But at least Tony wouldn't have to remember it for long.
The doors opened as the elevator dinged again, and Steve stepped out softly, silently, into an empty room. It looked like the security guard hadn't called ahead after all.
God, Steve hoped Tony wasn't watching this.
"God." Tony shuddered against him. "Start quoting
you. Because I know you must have been scared. I know you still are. And I hate to think that you've spent any of your life living in fear of what-- of what I might think of you."
"Are you okay?" he asks, his voice too loud in his ears, discordant.
Steve tried to shrug again. He shivered. "I was a kid. It was a long time ago."
Steve swallowed hard. "Tony, I--"
Steve knew a cue when he saw one. He stepped forward. "Tony has my support. Tony has always had my support. And if Tony wants to be the first Avenger to come out -- well, then he'll still have my support. And I'm confident that the rest of the team will stand by him." He smiled.
"Gentlemen," Walders said, "I believe that's all the time we have. Thank you both for being here."
Tony drags the garbage can over and picks out the petals, one by one, hiding every shred of evidence, and then he disposes of the trash in the dumpster behind the dormitory. He takes a mostly-steady breath, ignoring the tickle in his throat. It's a secret.
Mr. Stark takes a few harsh breaths. When he speaks, his voice is rougher now. "Thanks," he says. He half-smiles; it's a pained expression. "Honestly, I think that's the kindest brush-off I've ever gotten."
"I'm not dying," Tony said, quietly. His voice seemed caught in his chest; there was a low, hoarse note in the bottom of it. "You don't have to worry about that, all right? And I'm good to go. I can still be an Avenger." Tony offered up this fact as if it were his sole accomplishment. And then there was anguish in his eyes. "But
Steve smiled back. "Glad to hear it. Welcome back to the real world, again."
Tony runs his thumb over Steve's lips and Steve, desperate with humiliation, opens his mouth, chasing Tony's fingers, God, he just needs Tony to give him something, anything--
There's another message:
Tony grins affectionately and starts printing Steve's name and date of birth in his neat drafting hand. "Do you think the clerk's going to figure out who you are when she gets to the 1920 part?"
So he gently tilted his head back, straightening up, breaking the kiss. Tony's eyes were still closed. He was breathing slowly, raggedly, in through his nose, out through his mouth, like he was trying to ground himself. Steve slid his palm over the nape of Tony's neck, and Tony shivered and bowed his head, his breath catching again.
"Definitely." Tony's lazy smile is gorgeous. "Make yourself at home. Get comfortable. Hell, get naked if you want."
Steve remembered the photographs he'd been looking at, just a few hours ago. In the pictures, Tony had been smiling at him, laughing with him, leaning against him. But this had always been there, all along, hadn't it? Tony had always felt this way. Every picture had been a love story.
When Steve finally got the TV on, he found it had already been on SNN. He repressed a frown. Tony had probably been the last one watching TV, then.
Did Tony really think that Steve would insist on doing something Tony didn't want, just to increase his own pleasure? Well, he probably didn't think
"Tiberius knew you were there," Steve said. Dull horror was taking root in his stomach. "He asked you to be there. Tony, he knew
Almost frantic, Tony nodded. Steve supposed he'd been making Tony wait an awful long time.
Of course, they'd already established that Tony had no idea what people who really hated him would do to him, hadn't they? And for the most part it sounded like it had been, unfortunately, very close to that.
"Same to you," Tony replied, and Thor tapped his own helmet in a lazy salute before continuing on.
Steve still doesn't know what to say to him.
The headline closest to Tony read STARK RAVING MAD and featured a photograph of him staggering out of a club, his arms around two buxom, scantily-clad dancers. Tony didn't recognize the club. Or the city. Or, for that matter, the women.
"I was seven years old," Tony said, anguished. "I didn't know what the word meant. I didn't know what being gay even
Tony pats his cheek softly, which is incredible of him both because he can't imagine how Tony can comfort
"But right now I need to call a doctor."
"Captain America likes you too," he said, softly, and Tony smiled back.
"Okay, well," Steve said, looking Tony up and down again. "I can think of one thing that might make it a little easier. Come over here."
Mouth still open, Steve stared at him. After a few seconds, he shut his mouth. He swallowed hard. "I'm sorry," he said, quietly. "I don't understand what I said wrong."
"So," Jan said, briskly, as she hit a few keys on the closest terminal to bring up the current team roster. They were running larger than they often had; there were eleven names on the list. "Combat training. So I was thinking--"
Steve was actually grinning now. "Sit down. You're rocking the boat."
"Please," Steve repeated. "Please, Tony, yes."
Iron Man is silent for a long time, but he's breathing so heavily Steve can hear it through the filters, a rasp of static.
Steve nervously runs his bare hands down his uniform, unnecessarily adjusting the gloves tucked into his waistband.
"Oh, no, no!" Steve hastens to assure him. "Nothing like that! Iron Man's amazing. Nothing's wrong at all."
Next door, Gregory's still talking; he's the loudest voice, but he's still indistinct.
A corner of Tony's mouth twists. "You still don't need to lie to me."
, his heart had said.
Steve just shrugged. "Who even knows with this guy, Shellhead? He'll probably tell us."
Sure, there had been a few naysayers and homophobes, but on the whole, the world seemed to have taken the news of their relationship remarkably well. It had probably helped that everyone was so glad to see superheroes back on Earth again, after Onslaught, after the year on Counter-Earth that even Steve's memories of were already almost all gone. It had helped, too, that when Steve and Tony had finally decided to come out, they'd done it as a coordinated PR campaign. Captain America and Iron Man, longtime Avengers leaders, finally together romantically as well as professionally. They'd made it sound like a natural development -- which, honestly, it had felt like, the night Tony had kissed him for the first time -- and that was how they'd sold it to the press, too.
"It's always been easy to be your friend," Steve returned. "I know you think it isn't. But it is. I can't say I've always agreed with you on the exact right way to do things," he admitted, "but being your friend has never, ever been the hard part, okay?"
are, right now!"
Tony hadn't said anything about wanting Steve off the team. In fact, he'd really seemed to want Steve to stay, even to stay in the mansion. And maybe it made Steve a coward, but he wasn't strong enough to live in Tony's house, to see him every day, to watch for the inevitable bruises, to wait for Tiberius to finally break him, all the while knowing he could do nothing to stop it.
Steve never liked Extremis. He files away a few of those memories too, the ones where Tony answers the phone in his head and the skin around Steve's eyes goes pinched.
Tony exhales hard, a satisfied sigh, and Steve looks up and sees the edge of his smile.
"There's no
"Surely the question is what
Tony stops breathing for a good five seconds. The smallest spark of hope kindles in his eyes. "Steve?"
"Hmm?" Steve asks. He's still squinting. There's a long pause. "Who are you?"
Tony was still wearing the helmet, and it was probably better if he kept it on until they got inside. Tony now had his thumb hooked casually inside one of the shield's straps. Steve tried not to think about what the sight of Tony posing with his shield was doing to him.
"I'm sorry," Steve says, dejected, ashamed. "I know it's-- it's probably too soon to ask about something like that. I just figured we'd been together this long, and, well, I thought we should... find out if our goals align."
," Steve said, finally. "Not like you're implying. He just seemed-- for a couple seconds, he just seemed... off. Like there was something about him that wasn't right. Like it was all a put-on. But it wasn't much. Just a feeling." He shrugged helplessly. "I wasn't really a fan of how he told me I wasn't rich enough to be in his presence."
So Steve wraps his arms around Tony and holds on, because he knows Tony and he knows how to do this.
The guard scoffed. "Yeah, I can fuckin' see that. But there's no visitors allowed. The boss is busy."
Steve stared. He didn't understand. "It hasn't aired yet."
"Exactly how sure are they?"
Steve needs to do better.
Still grinning at him, Tony arched his hips up in assistance. Leaving Tony his underwear for the moment, Steve tugged his pants down and down and down. With a bit of work, he got them all the way off, followed by Tony's socks.
He walked past Tony, into the bedroom, laying his hand on Tony's arm and gently tugging him back inside. Off-balance, Tony stumbled a little before Steve slowed and righted him. Tony was so tired. Steve hoped they could get him some sleep soon.
"It doesn't," Steve echoed.
Telling Tony that he was also bisexual didn't seem like the sort of thing that was going to improve matters any. Tony already had enough to deal with. It didn't count when you hadn't been with another man before, wasn't that what they said? And of course that wasn't true. Steve knew it wasn't true. But that didn't mean that
"You're wonderful," Tony breathed, and Steve knew he meant
Steve bit back the answer. Tony didn't want him. Not like that. He knew that.
," Steve says, low and miserable.
," Tony began, his voice trembling with rage, "do you think you're doing?"
He struggled mostly one-handed into another pair of sweatpants and another t-shirt and headed downstairs, which was when he realized he'd made two very serious miscalculations.
Steve bit his lip again, as if he was about to say something he hated to own up to, and, yeah, here it came.
Steve considered it. "That was five years ago, maybe? I'd just learned your secret identity."
Steve still can't move. Not of his own free will. He tries to twitch his finger. It's agony, a red-hot pain searing his nerves.
That was what was going to happen. He knew the future. This was how it was all going to go.
work with all that." He didn't mean to second-guess Steve, but-- "You're sure that's a yes on the bondage? You
And then he leans up and in, rocking onto his tiptoes, and presses a kiss to the cheek of Iron Man's faceplate. Like the rest of him, the metal is warm, smooth against his lips, and Steve pulls back a little, staring at his own reflection in the mirrored surface, distorted and golden.
It doesn't take him long to pry off his boots, peel off his socks, and shimmy out of his gloves, uniform shirt, and undershirt. When he has his hands on his belt, he looks up, to find that Tony looks even more nervous than before.
He set the plug down on the bed next to everything else. He was going to be responsible. That would be over the line. He was going to behave in a professional and appropriate manner, because that was the right thing to do. Despite what the rest of the world might think about Tony Stark, infamous playboy, he didn't actually take orders from his dick.
And then he turns and strides back to Steve, smiling politely, like the past several minutes never happened, like he doesn't know Steve is already hard enough to cut diamond.
That was definitely going to come as a surprise, all right. But it wouldn't have come as a surprise to Tiberius. Not that Tony knew that. But it definitely wasn't a good choice. For multiple reasons.
"Fine, fine," Mr. Stark says. He pauses. He swallows, glancing away, and the nervousness looks real, not feigned -- but then his gaze is back on Steve again, with that same thousand-watt smile. Steve has met presidents and movie stars, and this man would outshine every one of them. "I just... had a question for you."
They don't really have records anymore, do they? But they still have fancy cars, and here Steve is, a nobody from the Lower East Side, being treated with far more class than he has ever been accustomed to.
"You'd want to do that?" Incredulity is plain in Iron Man's tone. "With me?"
In response, Tony held up the newspaper, bunched in his fist, then began to unroll it and smooth it out in an exaggerated manner that suggested that this task was taking all his remaining physical dexterity to accomplish. When it was relatively flat, he turned it around. The front-page headline -- it was one of the sleazier daily newspapers -- said IRON MAN NOT NEEDED. Tony was holding it upside-down. The subtitle, as far as Steve could tell, read AVENGERS GOV'T LIAISON ASKED TO INTERVENE.
Tony didn't single any of them out, but he held Steve's gaze for just a little longer when he smiled, and Steve smiled back.
Tapping his earpiece off, Steve stepped up next to him and peered at the device Tony was extricating. "Is that--?"
Tony wasn't the kind of man who would do this. Steve might not have known Tiberius Stone well, but he knew Tony Stark inside out. Tony would never have done this. To anyone. Relationship or no.
Steve gaped. "Radioactive Man was his
He's the last person Steve was ever expecting to see.
"Eleven?" Steve echoed, incredulous.
Tony's not really sure how Steve's magic Phoenix outfit is supposed to come off, and he suspects Steve doesn't know either, but five seconds later there are seams where Tony could have sworn there was nothing and Steve is opening a fly that wasn't there before, and, okay, just for today, Tony likes magic.
He turns back. Tony's sitting up now, and the case next to him is open, the armor within gleaming, but Tony hasn't actually made any other moves toward suiting up.
It turned out that Tony had been very, very good at lying, that he had been in quite a lot of distress for most of his life, and that one of his highest priorities was not breaking down anywhere the public might be able to see him. And then, somewhere along the way, Steve stopped counting as a member of the public. And then, a year ago, Steve started counting as something rather more.
There wasn't much farther for them to go after that, and in a few more minutes, Steve had found himself street parking, half a block away. He put his feet down to steady the bike for Tony.
He couldn't have what he wanted. That was life. But Tony was his friend, and that was enough.
"It does, though." Tony interrupted him. "I said, here I am, here's my goddamn soul, and he decided to break me. How many more times am I going to let myself get hurt? I just-- I only ever wanted someone to love me. But I guess that's just too much to ask, isn't it?" He was blinking back tears. "How long do I keep trying? How long do I give it before I accept the truth? There isn't anyone for me." He raised a shaking hand, gestured at himself. "Who's going to want
"All right," Steve said, dubiously, taking the shield from him. "Back in a second. Feel free to make yourself at home."
It's one of the many questions he knows Tony will say yes to. There are a few others he's holding in reserve. Sometimes he daydreams about getting down on one knee, because he's a traditionalist like that. And just because neither of them are quite ready for that yet doesn't mean that Steve isn't absolutely certain of Tony's answer.
The other half of the solution was that Tony needed to not believe people when they told him that he deserved what they were doing to him, but Steve wasn't sure that was something he could help him with, except by trying to convince Tony that he actually deserved better than he'd gotten. And that, well... that was a work in progress. It had always been.
It was also a statement that Steve couldn't respond to without making himself sound like a goddamn bully. Steve suspected that this was the way this entire conversation was going to go. But at least it was only going to hurt his pride. It wasn't anything compared to what Tiberius was doing to Tony.
"Yeah, well," Steve said, "you sure as hell weren't doing it!"
. It wasn't one of his prouder moments.
. Steve congratulates himself on his tact.
Tony's lips parted in surprise, and he looked possibly even more distressed now than he had at the actual injury. "Carol? But she--" He sounded deeply confused. "I talked to her Friday night, and she seemed fine. She wasn't having any, uh, problems." They both knew what
Now dressed more informally, in a t-shirt and khakis, he heads back to Steve's room, and he proceeds to strip Steve out of his uniform. He knows how to do this -- from battle, from uniform fittings -- but this is intimate. This is a violation. Him and Steve, they're not like that, no matter how much Tony wishes they were. But this, too, has to be done. Steve has to believe he could have fallen asleep like this.
He's not really sure what happens to him after that.
He nudges Steve's partially-open door all the way open with an easy little kick of his foot -- why have locked doors, after all, when Steve trusts him wholeheartedly? -- and deposits Steve, in full uniform, on his bed.
He thought about the sketchbooks he'd filled with Tony, once upon a time, over and over and over.
"I was wondering if you wanted to go out with me," he blurts out. "On a date."
"Fine," Steve agreed, but after Tony strapped him in he let him lean his head on his shoulder, and that made it all worth it.
Steve stood up straighter and swallowed hard, swallowed past the sudden lump in his throat. "I'll just go," he said, tightly. "I'm sorry I-- I'm really sorry I interrupted you. I'll see you later, Tony."
sex life just to make me miserable. I think he's too selfish for that. So I don't think he lied about not having a good time. I think he truly didn't like sleeping with me. I think I'm actually, genuinely bad at this. So, I mean, I understand if you don't want me to, now that you know--"
It was going to be a few minutes to get up there, probably. Steve tipped his head back and took a breath, enjoying a brief reprieve as the elevator started to move. He'd never been here before, so he didn't know the layout, which put him at a disadvantage. And he was going to be at even more of a disadvantage if the guard had also called up and told Tiberius he was coming. He'd deal with that when he got there.
blame yourself for that."
They'd better clear the floor anyway. Just to make sure.
Tony pets his hair for another minute or two, saying nothing, before he takes his hand away and goes back to work. Steve hears the keyboard again, the scrawling of pen on paper. Tony's arranged his schedule very carefully so no one will need to come in, and they stop if anyone calls; that's not what either of them want.
"Don't mind me," Mr. Stark pants. "I'm just gonna -- oh God -- I'm just gonna sit here for a few minutes and chew an aspirin or two. I'll be fine." He bares his teeth. It's probably supposed to be a smile.
Steve nodded. "I'm so glad it was me," he said. And then he realized what he actually meant. "Because I'm glad that first it was something
"I think about you a lot," Steve tried again, and God, he'd said that, hadn't he? "I always have. Not like-- it wasn't always-- but sometimes a lot." Yeah, that made no sense. He sighed. "On the way here, you-- you probably didn't even notice, but you had your hands on my belt. And I thought-- I tried not to think-- I thought about what you could do. To me." He squeezed his eyes shut. "I tried not to. When I thought you didn't want me. Slipped up sometimes. Slipped up a lot more, lately."
"To Ty's thing." Tony waved a hand, inarticulately, and Steve's heart sank. He hadn't meant it. "Gala. Party. Celebration. Whatever. I've got a plus-one, and I mean, it's not like I'm seeing anyone anymore."
This was going to be bad.
Tony beamed down at him. He was taking him apart again, and he knew it. God, he was beautiful. "You like that, don't you?" Tony asked, clearly fishing for compliments, and absolutely, yes, Tony could have all the compliments he wanted.
Steve surges up, shakes Ghost off him, and reaches for the drive--
"I know." Tony shrugged. "No big deal. It was a mistake, Not the worst way anyone's ever found out who I am. At least this time I had all my clothes on, right?" he murmured, and he raised his eyebrows.
Tony nodded, and he looked like he was listening with his full attention. He looked like he understood. "I know."
"Yeah?"
Iron Man slings a metal-clad arm over his shoulders -- they're touching, they're
Tony is starting to wonder if something has gone wrong.
They do, however, have blankets.
Tony laughed softly. "Hey, Winghead, you remember that time a couple years ago when I personally went on a killing spree? Killed three people. Nearly killed Jan. Nearly killed that teenage version of myself, too. You want to guess what you
"Fine," Tony told him. "I mean, okay, yeah, a little sore. But I'll be fine." He yawned. His eyes went unfocused, as if even looking up at Steve was energy he no longer had to spare.
"I can't believe I thought you were
And even so, even with all these setbacks to work around, being with Iron Man is still
Tony's gaze is somehow fond and annoyed. "
"Yeah," Steve said. "Yeah, of course, I'd love that." Eager, he was halfway to untucking his shirt when he had a better idea. "You want to help, or you just want to watch? Either's fine, but you can-- you can touch me if you want. It's allowed. Encouraged, actually."
Iron Man's laugh is oddly sad. "No, I didn't need any help from him," he calls back. "I just... wanted a nice, private space, and this was the first place I thought of."
It's so much like everything that Mr. Stark has been trying to tell Steve about Iron Man that Steve thinks it can't possibly be a coincidence.
The corners of Tony's mouth quivered. "No pressure, huh?"
He wonders if Iron Man's smile is as nice as Mr. Stark's. It surely must be.
It's answers like these that make Steve think he has some kind of chance with Iron Man, even though he knows nothing about him.
Steve can do this. He takes a step forward, entering the room.
this stupid?"
Silent once more, Eddie nods.
The negator is resting against Steve's neck, and Steve realizes Tony asked him a question. Tony's waiting for his permission.
It was a bad move, because Tony wouldn't be able to get his hand free as quickly in an emergency, and it was also a bad move because Steve was going to die right now of his aching, unfulfilled desire, and Tony didn't even know he was doing it. It was a fidgety little gesture; Tony often stood with his hand like that, one hand on his hip, thumb tucked into his belt loops or the edge of his belt or the waistband of his pants. Tony had always been tactile, ever since Steve had known him. Even in the early years, when he hadn't touched people because he'd been hiding the chestplate, he'd always been the sort of man whose fingers were always itching for something to touch, tapping his thighs or spinning a pencil or smoothing back his hair. Steve had had nearly a decade of thoughts about Tony's hands. And now it was all too easy to picture Tony's graceful hands sliding a little further forward, his long, dexterous fingers quick on Steve's belt buckle, and nope, nope, nope, Steve was definitely not going to think about that right now. Or ever. Tony certainly hadn't meant that.
And then Mr. Stark is staring back at him.
"Thanks for the lift, Happy!" Iron Man says. "See you tomorrow morning."
That seems... concerning. "But you're safe, right?" Steve asks. "I mean, you're charged now? All charged?"
Steve wasn't conscious of stepping forward, and he only realized he'd raised the shield when he saw it in his peripheral vision. And then he saw one more thing: flashing lights on the street far below, in the darkness. Someone had called the cops after all. And that was a lot of cops.
He was sure that people could in fact own riding crops for non-perverted purposes. Hell, maybe it even really was Dane's.
The falls hissed through the air as Tony drew the flogger back and swung; Steve gasped and rocked into the first blow. He swung again, harder, and then again, even harder -- and on that one, Steve finally cried out, full-throated. The scream ran through Tony's bones, lifted him up, carried him along the current of desire, filled him with a crackling power like lightning in a bottle.
"Oh," Steve said, lightly, "I think I have
Steve doesn't know what to do with that except be here for him. He can show Iron Man that he can trust him. So that's what he's got to do.
, and everything else miserable that's ever happened to Tony. He knows that sometimes he's been the cause of it. He tries not to be. He's always tried not to be.
"Hey, Cap?"
But now -- now Tony looked
He knew some people were into that, but he was pretty sure the answer for Tony was no. He'd tried to pet Tony's hair and Tony had flinched like-- like he'd thought Steve was going to try to hold him down, instead. That was what that had been. God. That was what Tony had been afraid of. And Steve could have, if he'd been that kind of man. He was definitely stronger than Tony. But he would never have done it. Not unless Tony had wanted it. It wasn't something you just assumed your partner liked. Didn't Tony know that?
"Yes," Tony pointed out, "but I don't have your flawless moral standards to live up to. Who knew Captain America was such a rule-breaker?" He clicked his tongue. "Naughty."
It had been a light blow, but Steve shuddered and moaned, arching into it, his body already begging for more; from what Tony could see of his face, he was smiling. The plug glinted and bobbed where it protruded from his ass, and Tony didn't know what it said about him that he was getting off on Steve getting off on the idea of being fucked by Iron Man. It was like fucking in front of a mirror, but this one reflected his own soul back at him.
"Really?"
"Not a solution I'd recommend," Tony said, sighing again. "If you can get drunk enough, there's a point where you eventually stop feeling ashamed of what you want. Of course, then you're not really in a fit state to act on what you want, and no decent human being would agree to sleep with you. It's very convenient if you happen to be dating an amoral psychopath, though." Tony said the words like he'd only just now realized how terribly wrong the entire situation had been, at a decade-long remove.
They were both here because they loved Tony, weren't they? That was what this had all really been about. It was just that Tiberius was the one Tony loved back.
Steve lifted him higher, sliding him out of the backplate of his armor and into Steve's lap, and, oh, yes, that was good, that was really good. Tony smiled, and Steve leaned in close.
Steve hissed several very un-Captain America words under his breath and lifted Tony's faceplate up. His fingertips roved almost tenderly over Tony's face, and then he tugged Tony's eye a little wider with one thumb, checking his pupils.
Tony couldn't even come up with the one blindingly obvious reason why a man might want to read a book about two men in love. It just wasn't occurring to him. He didn't think that Steve could ever, ever be queer.
"But if we can wake him up, I think we'd better," Steve added. "Speaking as the fella who's probably going to be held for questioning if they find me next to his body."
He finally meets Steve's gaze. "We need to talk." Iron Man's voice is flat, hard, forceful. "We need to talk
So he grabs a worn, fuzzy pair of old sweatpants out of his dresser, peels off his uniform, and is in the process of pulling a t-shirt over his head when his identicard beeps again.
"--embarrassing, I know," Steve said, and somehow there was enough blood in his face to blush. "I'm sorry, I know it's--"
It was probably all just his imagination, anyway. After all, Tony seemed to really like the guy. Tiberius couldn't be as terrible as Steve feared. And Tony usually had good taste in friends. He had to be good, then, didn't he? Maybe Steve just wasn't giving him enough of a chance.
"Good," Steve says, as soothingly as possible. "Good job, T-- Shellhead." He catches himself just in time, before he slips up in public. That doesn't usually happen. He's not at his best either, obviously. But he's better off than Tony is. "I'm going to be right here the whole time. You just have to do what I say. I know you can do that. I'm not going to let anything happen to you. All right?"
When he turned around, Tony was standing next to him, and he startled. He hadn't even heard Tony stand up. Geez. He was tired too.
He couldn't-- it couldn't possibly be because he didn't want to talk about Tiberius, could it? Steve had told him it was fine, on Sunday. They'd talked it all out. He'd thought Tony had understood that he was fine with it. So why was Tony acting like he was scared of telling the truth?
"Yeah," Tony agreed. He slid his thumb over the pulse point in Steve's neck, the spot he'd just nosed at, and Steve shivered.
The crowd began to whisper, intrigued, curious. Tiberius didn't stop them this time, letting the anticipation build. He had them eating out of the palm of his hand already.
"I know," Tony said, but there was still something wounded in his gaze. "I know what you meant. I just-- I can't offer you that."
None of this is going the way Steve had planned, but at the same time it's better than he could have dreamed.
He could start with something he'd figured out Tony liked, though. He pulled Tony over a little more, so Tony was on top of him now -- because, hell, they'd both liked that, hadn't they? -- and that let him bring his other hand up, stroking down Tony's back. And then, because Tony had liked it before -- and, okay, he'd liked it too -- he slid his hand over Tony's ass. Tony groaned into his mouth and pushed back against his hand, clearly seeking his touch, then rocked against him, rubbing his rapidly-hardening cock against Steve's thigh. Wonder flared bright inside Steve, the thought that he could give Tony pleasure, give him happiness, with just this touch.
Steve wonders what the hell happened, for so much of Iron Man's life to go so wrong.
"You're strong," Yinsen says, with utter certainty, and Tony realizes no one has ever told him this before. "You've made it this far. And you'll make it farther." He half-smiles. "Perhaps it is not a bad thing, to be a man so moved by feeling. You have a strong heart."
"You know as well as I do that that doesn't make it a good idea." Fury splayed his hands against the polished wood of the desk and leaned forward. "Look, Stark, you can't keep doing this. It's terrible for Ultimates PR if you get blackout drunk in strip clubs every night. You've got to stop."
"Two," Tony demands. "Come on, I can take two fingers, do it."
Nodding slowly, thoughtfully, Tony looked a little less sickened as he took in Steve's words. But only a little.
"And the guy's scum," Tony said, impatient, like that had been the wrong question. He sounded exhausted. "What else is new? He's the kind of weapons manufacturer who looks like he does most of his business with AIM and Hydra. Trust me when I say I know the type. He didn't admit to anything about Whiplash, but he showed me the prototypes for some armored battlesuits. The same armored battlesuits that attacked Iron Man a few days ago while I was testing my new teleportation functionality. And I didn't think it was a coincidence." Tony ran his hands through his hair. "Anyway, I was still working out how I was going to tell Ty not to bother with this asshole without mentioning the part where the guy tried to kill me twice, because Ty doesn't know about Iron Man. I hadn't told him the bad news yet. And then
"I haven't had the chance," Tony says, his secrets spilling out of him like another spray of flowers. "I, uh. I only just met him five minutes ago."
"Fine," Steve allows, grinning. "I take your point. But... yes?"
He also still can't move, so it's not as if he has any other options -- but it's awfully surprising anyway.
But it's not over. A scrap of half-remembered information drifts through his mind, Tony telling him about the first time he ever fought Ghost: Ghost couldn't be invisible and intangible at the same time. And if that's still true, then Ghost can't phase out of here without being seen, and if he opens a door while invisible Steve will certainly hear him. Ghost isn't going to be able to get off this floor, as long as Steve can track him.
"Feels better," Steve agrees, and then he pushes himself to his knees.
. And Tony had to know that. Didn't he?
His smile was a little broader. It was almost a joke.
At any rate, he'd discovered he'd liked Brooklyn an awful lot when he'd been living in Brooklyn Heights, back when he'd been with Bernie. And that hadn't worked out, and he'd gone back to the mansion. But when he'd decided he ought to have an apartment just in case, he'd found somewhere else in Brooklyn once more. The Avengers that had managed to stay on Earth after Onslaught -- probably mostly Natasha -- had kindly kept him current on rent in his absence. He'd moved all the furniture back in, he'd last stocked up on groceries a week ago, but he hadn't stayed there much lately. He didn't think Tony had ever been there at all, but the address had been in Steve's personnel file. It had been where he'd been planning to go tonight, where he'd been planning to move to after leaving the mansion. But a lot had changed in the last few hours. For the better. He couldn't explain why Tony wanted to go there, though.
Fury finished putting the newspapers on the desk, sat up straighter, and stared at him. His eye narrowed. "Stark."
Tony squinted at him. "I thought you said it had a happy ending?"
And then he gives Tony a crooked smile and takes Tony's hand in his.
Tony raised his head. His eyes were glassy, and there were tears streaming down his face. He took a gasping breath.
"Please," Steve said, because what else was there to say? "Please, yes."
"See?" Mr. Stark's voice is gentle. "Nothing to be afraid of. I-- I want you to be happy. Even if it's not with me. That's the truth."
Steve shivered and exhaled, sliding his knees wider. He looked like a monument to pornography, giving it all up to Tony. Tony pressed the tip of the plug to Steve's hole; Steve groaned as he pushed it in, one long sigh, and then a moan as it finally settled, slick with lube. If Steve weren't face-down, he'd have to be making an effort to hold it in, clenching and tightening around it the way he might take Tony's cock. That was a hell of a thought.
He can't. He can't do this.
Steve supposes now he has to man up and talk about his feelings. "Are you okay?" he asks, and it unfortunately sounds like a demand, spoken aloud.
It didn't look like Tony was even listening. Tony picked up his mug of tea and slugged it all back like he wanted it to be something harder. He probably did. Then, without asking, he picked up Steve's mug and drank it too.
"I sure hope so," Steve said, and Tony gave him three breaths before he swung.
This is terrible. Steve doesn't want to hear this. There's nowhere he can go. He can't escape this.
Tony's harsh exhalation fuzzed out the phone speaker. "I don't even know how to say this. I guess I should just say it." He sighed again. "Steve, you were right. You were right about Ty. One hundred percent. Everything you said was right. I was wrong. I am so, so sorry. I understand if you don't want to forgive me. I wouldn't forgive me either. But you were right. You were absolutely right."
"You're a kind man." Tony's smile was wavering. "You're clearly doing this to make me feel better, and I-- I appreciate it, but I know I'm not someone you really want. And I'd really rather not have anything at all when it's only pity. I know you're straight."
Oh, geez. If Tony was refusing coffee, it had to be bad. It was a ridiculous thought, because it had been quite clear already just how badly off he was right now. But somehow this, this thing that was comparatively so small, just underscored it. An aching sympathy welled up in Steve.
But now, of course, Steve has to ask Iron Man himself, and that means -- or, at least, it might mean, Steve isn't sure about this one either -- that he should show up with a ring.
Steve draws his arm back, eyes the angles, and throws his shield as hard as he can.
"Oh, that's lovely," Iron Man says, and Steve's heart is overflowing with joy.
, and Tony had said
He likes the thought of that.
And then there was that visor. Steve didn't know what to make of that, either. It was anchored around one of Tony's ears, coming up and over half his face, holding some kind of lens in front of his right eye. The image of Tony's eye was twisted and distorted through the glass, warped sapphire-blue. His pupils were unnaturally constricted.
So if Tiberius was telling Tony everything he wanted to hear and Steve was telling him nothing he wanted to hear, it was obvious which of them Tony was going to trust. Tiberius had had a point.
Oh. He probably thinks Steve is going to try something. He wouldn't. Iron Man already said no.
"What did she do?"
"You could touch me back?" Steve offers. "If you wanted to."
He takes another careful, measured breath. "I would. I absolutely would, and frankly I don't understand why you're trying to dissuade me."
In other words, they were sitting ducks.
God, if it was Tony--
Tony wasn't in the living room. That much was obvious. Probably the office, then.
Or had Tony believed the lies already? It wasn't as if Steve had never heard similar sentiments from Tony when he was having one of his worse days, but somehow he'd always thought that it had been because Tony was in a particular mood. He'd never thought it was what Tony had always believed, deep down. It sure wasn't what he believed about Tony. But Tony could be hard on himself sometimes. All his friends knew that.
Maybe Tony was comparing him to all the rest, however many there had been, judging him and finding him wanting. He didn't know. Maybe Tony had made up his mind just from that one kiss.
Hell with it.
"Wouldn't be the same." Steve's eyes were shut. "My visual memory is better than normal, but only after the serum. Thinking of things or people from before it -- it'd be like drawing without a reference. I think maybe... it'd be worse to have it, and have it be wrong, than not have it at all."
"That's the idea," Steve said, grinning back.
"I sure wasn't back then," Steve said. He met Tony's eyes. "And I know you know exactly how I did you wrong. You, specifically." Everything he'd said to Tony when Tony had been drinking had been... unconscionable. There were no excuses. "And it would have been like that, or even worse than that, if we'd been together. And I'm-- I'm sure not claiming to be perfect now, but I like to think I'm better than I was. I think we've got a shot now. We wouldn't have had one, back then. But we've got one now, and I'm aiming to do right by you. As much as I possibly can."
If Steve let him do this again Tony was going to get a proper cross, or at the very least figure out how to get him spread-eagled. "All right," Tony said. If Steve thought he could take it, then he could take it. "I'll see what I can do to get you all trussed up."
"So you want to wait while I call Reed?"
"Anything else?" Tony asked, quietly. "Up to you." He knew Tony must have been feeling pretty impatient -- hell, Steve was -- but he was clearly determined not to push him.
Steve hears the softest rustle of fabric somewhere from the middle of the room, moving toward the windows. Steve has often been a fan of exiting buildings through the windows, but Ghost's method of egress is definitely not the same as Steve's, as he suspects Ghost is planning on literally exiting through the windows. Without opening them.
There was an odd look in Tony's eyes, wistfulness and-- and... something else. Steve didn't know what.
Gingerly, he starts to lever himself up, and Iron Man creaks and stirs, coming around.
No, he didn't know. "You'd have known something, all right," Steve said, confused and a little angry, because, God, he'd wanted to be good enough for Tony, he'd wanted to show him he'd liked it, he'd wanted to show Tony he was much better at this whole gay sex thing than he'd thought he was, and apparently Steve hadn't even done that right because Tony somehow hadn't been convinced of his sincerity. "You'd have known I was an
Henry
He sinks to his knees and feels an immediate and overwhelming sense of relief as Tony smiles encouragingly at him. All he has to do is what Tony says. Tony wants him to do this. For as long as the scene lasts, his life is blessedly, perfectly simple.
Steve's heart skipped a beat. He couldn't speak.
Steve is staring again, dumbfounded. He hadn't thought Iron Man talked to Mr. Stark about him. He knows they must have talked a bit; Mr. Stark had loaned Iron Man the services of his chauffeur for their first date, after all. So of course Mr. Stark knows. But that fact isn't something Steve's thought a lot about. Until now.
"Seriously, though," Steve said. His mouth twitched, and he was starting to redden again. "One of the things I wasn't about to tell my good buddy Shellhead while I was asking him out was the fact that I
"It's okay," Steve says softly. It isn't exactly a lie. He can't lie to Tony. It's just the nicest possible elements of the truth. "You're so clever, Tony," he murmurs, and Tony smiles against his palm. Tony makes a quiet noise that could be an objection. "Shh. You are. You made the suit to help you. I think that's amazing. Doesn't matter how you're standing up as long as you're standing up, does it?"
"Better keep your eyes shut, Shellhead," Steve says, as he settles them both down against a nearby wall, Iron Man's head in his lap. "You can take the mask off later and clean your face. When I'm not here, I mean. I won't pry. I just want you to be okay."
Yeah, that was the name, all right. Steve squints right back, because isn't the answer obvious? "Don't you get messages about it too? I get messages about it all the time! From strangers! They want me to buy it. And they want to sell me things to, uh, make me bigger. And none of them can spell."
"Shh, shh, no!" Tony says. His distress is plain to see. His eyes are wide, pained. "Don't be like that. You have absolutely nothing to be ashamed of. I thought it was so sweet that you wanted to give me money." His mouth quirks. He has a very expressive mouth. Steve is abruptly, acutely aware of the fact that he's kissed him. A lot.
The song Steve had quoted kept rattling around Tony's brain.
Steve was breathing hard, his eyes starting to darken, but there was still reluctance in his gaze. That wasn't what Tony wanted to see, not at all.
Tony couldn't even trust this, Steve thought, sickened. Steve had wanted to do something to please Tony, and Tony had already been trained to look for the hidden catch.
But still, it could have been better. Steve considers this as he watches Tony peel himself out of his battered armor, piece by piece. It was a bad crash, so bad that even Tony's not flight-capable, but he's in one piece. The helmet dented, which is why Tony doesn't have his own comms anymore, but at least it was the helmet and not Tony's head. Mostly.
God, Steve hopes he's okay.
But this isn't entirely about aesthetic appreciation; Steve added a couple of delicate knots framing Tony's cock and balls. If Tony ever manages to move, he's definitely going to enjoy the added stimulation. Tony's already hard, but not desperately so; he'll want to get off at some point, Steve knows, but right now Tony's content to wait. That's fine. That's good. They've got all the time in the world, tonight. For now, Steve's enjoying the sight of him, his cock lying heavy against his thigh, leaking across the rope harness. It makes Steve's mouth water.
Iron Man's gaze drops; he's staring down at his own hands. And then he does a curious thing: he sets two fingers to the thickened edge of the gauntlet on his other hand, to the band of crimson metal halfway down his arm. And then he does something Steve can't quite make out, an intricate movement of his fingers. There's a quiet click, and then the entire gauntlet starts to... retract? The striated metal begins to fold in on itself, as the whole gauntlet, repulsor node and all, draws itself backwards and up into the cuff, and Steve is left staring at Iron Man's hand.
Tony smiled. "I have to say, I like the sound of that."
by Tony Stark's standards means that the bill was nearing four figures, which was a total they'd achieved without ordering drinks. But not only did Steve pay for it all, he didn't even let Tony see a menu with prices on it. And from the way Tony was smoldering at him from across the table, he's pretty damn sure Tony enjoyed that. Though he'll never say it in so many words, Tony really likes being taken care of. And Steve -- well, Steve really likes taking care of Tony, so it all works out nicely.
"Not sure I'd call what I want to do with you
By the time Steve makes it back upstairs to his room, he's starting to feel the way he does after staggering off one battlefield only to learn that there's another one awaiting him. The talk with Mr. Stark had been rougher than he'd expected, and he still doesn't know what all of that was about -- but in the end Mr. Stark had come around, hadn't he? He'd given Steve Iron Man's ring size. He could have said no, and he said yes. That has to be a good sign, doesn't it?
Steve runs, following the path of Iron Man's trajectory, even as he knows he can't do anything to help. It's not like he can catch him. Even Steve would be flattened if he tried.
"I know," Steve said, quickly. "I'm not upset. I know what you meant. It's a good question." He thought about it, turned it over in his mind like yet another tactical problem, and then, finally, saw the shape of the answer. "You're going to say that this is terribly unsentimental, but you know how these days, in politics, they say
Tony turns around and steps forward, ready for what he deserves.
host on
"I remember," Steve says. "I remember everything."
"Still blushing, you know." Iron Man coughs again.
Outside, the sun was starting to come up, the faintest streaks of dawn in the night sky. A new day.
Tony sat back in what he suspected was an intentionally-uncomfortable chair and watched Fury set out a row of newspapers, one by one, on the desk in front of him. Through the sides of Tony's rocks glass, the headlines were distorted, the newsprint tinted amber by two fingers of quality scotch.
"Come on, then," Tony said, with an encouraging smile. "Sit down, Cap. I'll fry you up a couple of eggs."
"I was never meant to join the Ultimates, in the beginning," Tony says, and Steve doesn't quite understand why he's started all the way back there, but that's why Tony's the genius. "You know that, right?" Tony continues, like he's giving a lecture and needs to gauge the audience's understanding. "I was meant to be a tech liaison for SHIELD. I was never meant to be the guy in the suit. It wasn't like Fury ever turned me down, mind you. That wasn't how it worked. He didn't have the chance. My name just... never came up. Because why would you send" -- he gestures at himself -- "your billionaire engineer to do a job any grunt could do?" He coughs. "No offense, darling."
Some fantasies weren't ever going to come true. Steve was going to sit at Tony's side and watch his best friend throw himself at liars for another decade. Two decades. The rest of his life, however long that would be. And he was going to say nothing.
gay? And then it made far too much sense.
No, Steve told his overeager imagination, firmly. Tony didn't
, he just-- well, he missed Tony.
Tony took another contemplative sip of tea. "Go for it. Not like it's going to get any easier."
"Thanks, Carol." Steve's voice cracked. To his horror, he heard himself sniffle wetly. "But I think-- I'm pretty sure this one's permanent. It was bad. It was really bad. Worse than all the other times we've fought."
Steve knows that Tony's still dropping; he knows, too, that the events of the past few hours haven't shaken Tony free of subspace. When he's down in it, when he's really into a scene he's so very eager to please. Tony still wants to give him the right answer and is more than a little distressed that he can't. Tony in a normal state of mind has absolutely no problem disagreeing with him. Several bitter incidents over the years have demonstrated that. Steve remembers the look on Tony's face when he said he knew how to use a negator.
He flipped the phone open, found Tony in his contacts, and -- it was a little tricky with gloves on -- laboriously pecked out a message using the number pad:
The gun slides to the side of Steve's head, still pressed firmly against his skull. Ghost bends over and tugs the keyboard toward himself with his other hand. It's a nice keyboard, Steve notes, inanely. Solid metal, right down to the keys themselves. Looks heavy. Expensive, probably. Tony always believes in buying the best.
Unless, of course, Steve gives him one.
"I've got a shot," Tony said, and Steve obligingly edged just a little to the right to make room, because after a decade, Steve knew where he was without even having to look. Tony raised his hands. "I'm taking it."
Steve clears his throat. "I, um," he says, suddenly and surprisingly reticent. "I thought maybe a back massage."
Steve felt himself smile, just a bit. "So he asked you to trust him. Just to trust him. I'm asking you to trust me, but
Steve observes, distantly, that he's really good at that.
that Tony had given him. Sure, he knew that it wasn't the first book in the series anymore, but it still was in Steve's heart. He'd read the original stories back in the thirties, and at some point in the intervening years they'd collected them all into books. And right now, this was what he needed. A tale of good versus evil. Right versus wrong. Heroes and villains. A man doing the right thing and triumphing.
"Darling," Jan said, sweetly, "I stood here for half an hour while you explained your latest experiments to Sebastian Shaw. Let me have this."
, which is confirmed as Iron Man keeps talking. "I-- I loved him. I still miss him. But I don't want to be like him, and I'm scared that I would be."
He says it softly, hesitantly. Like he's giving up a secret, and maybe he is. One of Iron Man's secrets. A secret Steve would never have presumed to demand from him. But here Mr. Stark is, giving it all away. Invading Iron Man's privacy.
Tony draped his arms over Steve, bonelessly, and let Steve rest there in his lazy, sated embrace. His kiss was slow and tender. He traced one hand down Steve's side, and he smiled even wider as he found Steve still hard.
As the film starts, this time Steve is the one who reaches out and takes Iron Man's hand.
, and pecked out his reply on the keypad:
"I could make myself better." Tony says. Somehow all of his justifications feel inadequate, when it's Steve. "I-- wouldn't have to remember any of the mistakes."
The low hum of the conversations around them were drifting away as the guests slowly began to realize that the stage at the other side of the room was now in use; Tiberius was standing in front of the still-closed curtain, microphone in hand, and the audience turned their rapt gaze upon him as if the hundreds of people in the room were one single person. He had their attention. It was amazingly good showmanship.
"Hello?"
So Steve picks up Iron Man -- he's not too heavy for Steve, of course -- and carries him out of the way of the fight, as Iron Man tries to open his eyes, tries to blink away the rivulets of blood.
"Lower," he groaned. He could still talk, but he was out of more specific words, and he hoped that Tony would understand.
Steve didn't say anything for a long time, and then he took a deep breath. "You know what the worst part of all of this was, for me?" He gestured around himself in illustration.
"Captain," he said, hurriedly, his face a study in surprised innocence, "there's obviously been some mistake--"
Iron Man takes Steve to the movies.
. That doesn't change. He can't change that. He can try to explain it away, he can try to make excuses, but he still hurt you."
Tony ducked his head. "Oh, God. Really? Do I even want to know what they said?"
"That's the other thing," Steve said, eyes downcast. "I'm-- I'm not a good sub. I don't want you to go getting your hopes up, because most people who scene with me don't want to come back for a second round."
Steve takes a deep breath. He can do this. He can definitely do this. It's only a question. Heck, it's a question that Mr. Stark doesn't even need to say yes to. But it would sure be nice if he did.
Steve wasn't going to hit someone who couldn't hit back. He'd never been a bully and he wasn't going to be one and he wasn't going to hit a man who couldn't move, even if it was Tiberius. But, God, he wanted to. His fingers twitched and tensed on his shield.
"It's okay," Steve says again, because it is.
No. He's not thinking about that. He can't afford that. Focus, he tells himself again. He's slipping, and he knows why he's slipping, but that doesn't make it any easier to stop.
He pictured Steve working the plug into himself, red metal against slick skin. Did Steve-- Jesus, did Steve
Tony takes a few wobbling steps forward and shuts the door behind himself. Concerned, Steve watches as Tony wobbles his way further into the room. If Tony falls, there's no way Steve can catch him, being as he's still strapped to the bed.
Steve busied himself with finding the kettle, filling it with water, setting it on the burner, turning it on. The stove clicked a few times and then the flame caught. He opened another cabinet. Tea bags. Two mugs, only a little chipped. They both had the Avengers' logo on them; one had a little Captain America shield and the other a stylized Iron Man helmet. He held them up for inspection and Tony nodded.
was not.
Steve summons up a smile. "Nothing's ever going to make me love you any less, Tony."
Steve wants to hold him, to cradle him close and tell him he'll keep him safe, tell him he'll do everything he can. He thinks now is probably not the time for that.
"As long as you let me come eventually, I'm all in favor of that idea." Steve kicked one unrestrained foot against the mattress. "You want me to roll over now?"
"Sounds good to me," Steve said, amiably, and he dropped his head into the pillow of his bound arms, pushing his ass higher. He was waiting.
Awkwardly, Tony kept patting Steve's shoulder. "I'm really sorry."
No, Steve realized, he
That was going to be at least a few days to heal. Maybe a week. Damn it.
Jan squeezed his arm. "It'll be all right, Steve. I know it's rough, but he's made it through everything else, and he'll make it through this. And if he needs our help, then we'll help him. He doesn't have to do this alone. We're Avengers. No one has to do this alone." She smiled. "Hey, after we're done with the training assignments, do you want to start drafting a press release supporting Tony?" She made a face. "Or Iron Man? I suppose both of him could use it, honestly."
Iron Man laughs a quiet little laugh. "It's okay. Now you know. They also can't make your dick bigger, by the way. That process doesn't actually exist." He glances down again, briefly but significantly. "Not that you, um, look like you need the help."
Steve's smile was wavering, incredulous. "I've wanted you for so long," he murmured, and it was everything Tony had ever wanted to hear, but Steve didn't
Okay, so it definitely wasn't the taste he objected to. Steve could hardly think. God, that was so good, so much better than with the condom on -- though he hated to admit it -- but, oh, it was perfect. He could feel himself getting hard again. The way Tony's mouth felt, it was easy.
And Steve's in here, alone, in restraints. SHIELD brought them in, special. They're restraints that will hold even him, because SHIELD already learned that lesson, recently, in the worst way possible. Though, really, it could have been a lot worse. Steve only bit Blade. He was fine. The guy was already a vampire, apparently.
She shakes her head. "He's made no demands. He came in through the window -- right through the closed window, dozens of floors in the air -- and after that, the security cameras in the section cut out. We're fairly certain he's still on the floor, though."
When Steve says, "I can't do this anymore," he's staring at Tony across the ruins of the broken mansion, and he doesn't even sound sorry. "I love you," he says. "I love you, but I can't."
The helmet tilted as Tony looked him up and down. "You know," he said, "not a lot of people wear red cavalier boots. Just saying." There was amusement in his voice.
He wonders if Iron Man knows about that. About the rejection. If he and Mr. Stark talked about it. Steve's gotten the impression, from things Iron Man has let slip here and there, that Iron Man knows a lot about the guy. That they're close. But this is personal. It could be different.
Retreating, he headed over, rounded the kitchen counter, opened the refrigerator, and he was in the middle of bemoaning his current lack of perishables when he realized Tony hadn't answered him. The silence coming from Tony's corner of the living room felt somehow oppressive.
Well, that's mysterious.
"Then I think a lot of people must not know you well at all," Steve concludes.
"Hey, Jan," Tony said, cheerfully. He grinned down at Steve. Steve couldn't quite hear Jan's half of the conversation. "Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. No, really." He smiled ruefully. "It's my fault Steve didn't get back to you. He didn't want to make it sound like it was my fault -- you know how he is, right? -- but it was absolutely my fault. I got myself knocked out and held captive. You know, a regular Monday, right?" He snorted. "I wasn't feeling too great afterwards. Wasn't really up for team company." He paused "Yeah, I know. Me too. I'm a lot better now, though." He nodded thoughtfully. "Oh, right. I asked Steve if I could stay over at his place in Brooklyn for the night, and I'm afraid I kept him up way past his bedtime. He just woke up a couple minutes ago."
"Oh," he says, finally. There's not much left in his brain. It's been a long night, and he's pleasantly fuzzy in the afterglow. Tony always knows how to get him out of a glum mood. Sure,
prove that you're awake based on particular abilities that you possess and can demonstrate. But you'll have to trust me about the fact that you possess them, unless you already know that fact."
," Tony said, quiet again, pained. "Believe me, I wish I knew how it had happened. I was the picture of health after Onslaught. Had a full workup. And I know it wasn't just me who was better. We all know Clint got his hearing back." Tony exhaled. "Maybe he ought to get his ears checked."
They kissed, again and again. Steve let his fingers trace the line of Tony's spine, down and up and down again, and Tony relaxed slowly against him, everything in him at ease now. His lips were sweet and slack, and he hummed, pleased, as Steve licked into his mouth. If he wanted Steve to take the lead now, Steve was more than happy to. He could take care of Tony like this, the way he'd always wanted to. He'd had a lot of fantasies that started like this. Not all of them were about sex, even; some of them were just about putting Tony to bed and holding him while he fell asleep. But many of them involved giving Tony a very thorough blowjob first.
"Steve, I'm not asking you to make sacrifices--"
of me."
"Maybe," he mumbles. He's never told Tony that he loves him. He's never figured out how. This honestly wasn't how he was picturing saying it. But he's not sure he'll ever have another chance. He steels himself and looks up. "Yeah," he says, gamely. "Yes. Because I love you."
There was more movement from above, as another figure leaped down. This man wasn't in a biohazard suit -- he was wearing a navy-blue uniform with leather boots and gloves, his fingers exposed -- and he landed nimbly on his feet, with the poise of an athlete, and he ran to Tony's side.
God. Steve couldn't say no to that. "Of course you deserve it," he murmured. "And of course it's not selfish. You can absolutely ride with me."
"I'm gonna do a lot of things to you now," Steve returned, which was really quite a remarkable statement to make in the middle of Nick Fury's office, and ten seconds after that Tony realized he didn't much care what Fury thought of that, because Steve was kissing him,
Mr. Stark is wrong. This isn't what anyone else has, sure, but Steve wouldn't trade it for the world.
Steve had made a mess of this conversation, too, hadn't he?
Steve sags forward, gulping air. Out of the corner of his eye, he can see Ghost moving, holding something metallic in his hand, and he tries to twist around, to roll out of the way.
Oh. That was unexpected. Tony had thought about what Steve had done, had tried to reconcile
"Do I ever," Tony says. He sounds unsteady again. "It's a shame home's so far away."
, Steve thinks.
Tony's mouth thinned and his gaze went somewhere far away. "Boy, was she ever." His lips twisted even more, almost a frown; it was as bad as his public face ever got, and if he was showing it this much, his actual feelings were far worse. "Why do you ask?"
"Wait until you hear about what I'd like to put
It's okay. He just has to get through this conversation. Maybe it will even be nice, to get to meet Captain America once, finally, after all these years of loving him. Tony has double-checked the Avengers' funding paperwork with the Maria Stark Foundation. The team will go on without him. Everyone will be all right.
Steve sat down next to Tony, keeping his fingers over the book cover so Tony couldn't read the title. "Sort of." He turned over his empty hand, palm up. "Here's the plan. I can't give you specific information that you can verify. I can't prove to you that you're awake based on any particular fact. But I
And he needed to get some sleep. That would definitely help. He reached up and turned off the light, awkwardly, with his left hand; the light was on the wrong side of the bed. Darkness fell, and Steve shut his eyes. He told himself he wasn't thinking about Tony.
"No," Steve whispered. No, not like this. Tony couldn't die like this.
"Any channel," Pietro said, and that definitely wasn't a good sign.
Since the comm line to Jan is still open, Steve can't object aloud, of course, so he's reduced to gestures. He hastily makes a throat-slitting motion with one finger. But it's too late.
Bewildered, Steve scooted his chair farther out of Tony's line of sight, turned around, and-- oh. It was Tony on the screen. There was footage of him exiting a building Steve didn't recognize, walking out onto a city street. His tie flapped in the wind. The chyron read STARK IMPLICATED IN MURDER.
"Um," she says. She tucks a strand of hair behind her ear. "Employees clear the area as fast as possible in the event of a supervillain incident. The standard buffer is five floors up and down, and we've got that clear. We're working on clearing the rest of the building now. Then we call the Avengers, obviously." She gestures at the two of them. "We also call SHIELD. They're en route." She glances over at Tony again. Tony still has nothing to say. Over the comms, Tony's breath rattles.
-- that's
All his memories are organized there. Files and directories on the hard drive of his brain. A laundry list of mistakes. Sunset Bain. Tiberius Stone. The death of the Carnelian ambassador. The smell of the flophouse, burning down around him. The Guardsmen. The death of the Kree Supreme Intelligence. Mentallo. The destruction of the mansion, and all the death that went with it.
"You hate guns," Tony said. He thought maybe more of his memory was coming back.
, in a way he can't quite put words to. When he touches Tony, it's like he's never been meant to do anything else, a thought that's almost like blasphemy from Steve, a man whose life has been given so much greater purpose. But sometimes he can admit that he likes this one best. He's here for Tony.
But soon enough, they've got Ghost -- who is still unconscious -- out of here. He'll probably wake up in the Raft, and that's fine by Steve. Maybe he'll stay there. One of the painfully-eager young agents runs upstairs to take care of Ghost's grappling hook, and then another one runs outside and comes back with the pieces of the drive Steve dropped out the window, just so no one can try to run data recovery. Steve promises that he'll tell Tony he needs to call Damage Control; luckily, Iron Man is still in the room. He agrees to everything. Yes, he'll send copies of the official reports. He just wants them gone.
"Shh," Steve whispers. He pitches his voice low, soft and gentle. Reassuring. "Shh, it's okay. It's over. It's all over. Nothing to worry about now. You did good. So good. I'm so proud of you. That was amazing. You were amazing." That's not a lie; it's himself that Steve is ashamed of. The words catch in his throat. "You were brilliant. And you saved me, because you're brilliant. I'm-- I'm so grateful. Thank you."
Steve brings the shield down on his face again and again and Tony remembers Steve's gentle hands on his body, remembers that he would have trusted Steve to do anything to him.
Oh. Well. That's something that hadn't occurred to Steve.
And that was precisely when the cops got there.
this -- please go right ahead." He smiles. "I like when you're happy."
"Tony," Steve said, wounded, but he knew he couldn't be hurting right now as much as Tony was. "Tony, that's not true--"
When the spasms finally stop, he washes out his mouth and starts to shove the blossoms down the garbage disposal, which is when a red-gloved hand lands gently on his arm, which is a bad idea for a number of reasons. Steve shouldn't be touching him. He'll feel the chestplate. Maybe it doesn't matter if Steve feels the chestplate. Tony will be dead anyway, soon enough.
"Didn't exactly mean to tell you like that," Tony confessed, because now that he'd started he was damned anyway, so why not keep going? "Didn't exactly mean to tell you at all, but
And, indeed, that was what he'd been doing. Tony nuzzled his way over Steve's jaw and mouthed at his throat. "Feeling better?" Tony asked. His smile was kind. "You were looking a little overwhelmed, just now. Not that you didn't also look like about a thousand wet dreams at once, don't get me wrong, but you also looked like maybe you didn't want to be quite that worked-up yet."
"So." Steve's teeth worried at his unfairly-beautiful lower lip. "Is that a yes?"
Steve can try one more time. He can try to give Mr. Stark a chance to explain himself.
Clapping his hands, Ghost leans over the desk, and he starts to untangle the portable drive from its nest of wires. "Thanks for the chat, Captain," he says, casually, head tilting briefly in Steve's direction. "Lovely to meet yet another brainwashed lackey of Tony Stark." He turns the drive over in his hand and yanks out one of the remaining cords. "We'll have to do this again sometime."
me, you know?" He laughed. "And it turned out that had all been a lie, too. So no one liked me, I guess."
, I suppose. I, uh. I didn't think anyone else was going to be seeing my underwear today."
Steve nods slowly. It's a fair point. He hadn't thought of that. He suspects that, given that, he's also one of the only people Iron Man is willing to date.
Eddie stares up at him, awed. "Can-- can I have
"The username," Tony says, slow and tortured, like the information's being forced out of him, except he's volunteering it, he's volunteering it to save Steve's life, and Steve wishes to God this weren't happening. Tony's never going to be able to forgive himself. "The username," Tony repeats, "is
And Steve was starting to get a sense of how Tony liked it, now. Tony liked to be touched. Held. And, sure, most people did, but Tony seemed to really, really like it, more than anyone else Steve had been with. It made sense, really; Tony sure liked touching people. Touching anything, really. Steve had already known that about him. So of course Tony loved anything that gave him more of it.
He wouldn't have moved on his own, but it seemed that he was going to go wherever Steve went, and Steve obediently dragged him backwards, still holding him tight. Apparently Steve gave really good hugs, too.
"I'm just--" he mumbled. "I'm... sensitive. It doesn't take much to get me there. Not since the serum, anyway. And you're just so--" he gestured, out of words to describe what Tony was doing to him. "The first one's always pretty fast. Not usually this fast, but I'm, um. Very excited."
"Anyway," Steve said. "He's up there, and he's been messing with the electricity somehow. The escalators are all down, as well as the elevators, so it'll be a long walk up, and we're probably only getting emergency lights. But the power drain is fluctuating, so he's definitely doing
Tony caught himself just in time, and Steve knew why. He must still not have told Tiberius he was Iron Man. Steve wondered if he ever would. And it wasn't really a surprise to learn that Tony had worried about Steve's reaction to his secret identity, either.
. If you're feeling bad, if you're feeling hurt, look around at your life and see who's in it. Check out their stories. Check out my story, even if it's me. Try to figure out what's hurting you and where it's coming from. He had a story for everything he did, but the one thing he couldn't explain away was the fact that he was, actually, hurting you and continuing to hurt you. He talked as fast as he could to try to hide it, but it all pointed back to him. His story didn't check out, in the end. And I'd really hope that all of mine will. And, sure, maybe I'm running the longest of long cons. I know I can't prove I'm not. He sure was. But there were signs. If you knew what to look for, they were there. They'd be there. That's how you know."
," Tony spits out, like it's the lowest and most vile of sins. "I was helpless then, and I was helpless tonight. Ghost had a gun to your head and I couldn't do anything. I was just standing there. Just like with Machine Man."
The wind whips around Steve as he clings to Tony's armor with as much of him as he can manage. It's the fastest way to get to Tony's tower, and Tony assured him that he was flight-capable -- but it had been very much like what he'd said about the rest of the armor. Tony's not going to fall out of the sky, because Tony is on autopilot. Tony doesn't have to control the suit at all until he touches down.
When he sets his spoon down, Steve sees another bandage wrapped around his hand. He has long, elegant fingers, covered in a fine tracery of scars. Some of the cuts and burns look newer than the rest. He's the only rich guy Steve has ever known who works with his hands.
Tony was mouthing a few of the words to himself -- yeah, he was definitely reading -- and there was a strange expression on his face. "Uh. This is the middle of a dream sequence."
Maybe, maybe, he felt the same way Tony did.
Steve didn't look
Tony looked like he was re-evaluating the entire last week of his life as fast as humanly possible. Again. "Hang on, a fight about--?"
"Have you ever heard the claim that people can't read in dreams?"
"Right," Steve said. His throat was tight, his face hot. "Then I'll start packing."
A good few hours later, the gala was winding down; Steve's dining companions had left for the evening a while ago, as had the rest of the table he'd been seated at. The string quartet in the corner was still playing, but no one was dancing anymore. There were a few clusters of people here and there, still chatting. Tony was gladhanding the last of the millionaires, and a Daily Bugle photographer, looking dead on his feet, was still taking pictures.
He tried again. "I mean, I know what you say about most of those businessmen you know. Like your Dragons & Dungeons thing you told me about."
"I know." Steve's voice rasps.
What?
Tony slowly opened his eyes. Raising his head, he blinked, then his gaze focused on Steve, and he smiled, wide and pleased. He was actually clutching Steve a little tighter. He obviously didn't want to let Steve go for any reason.
Iron Man laughs again. "Yeah. Nothing to be done about that, I'm afraid. The armor has to stay on. You can't touch most of my body. Even if you're willing to keep your eyes shut. That's not the problem. You can't--
He'd wondered why Iron Man had never even let him see his hands, but he knows now that it would have been a dead giveaway.
Tony clenched and unclenched his fists. His face had gone a sickly yellow-white. "I don't think you want to say another word about my father right now."
Tony sighed a heavy sigh, and Steve turned back to see him biting his lip.
And he seemed to have forgotten that Steve was the kind of fella who threw himself out of airplanes without a parachute on the regular because Steve just said
"Look, just because Radioactive Man was Ty's bodyguard, it doesn't mean--"
Well,
-- and there's an embarrassingly primal part of him that likes watching Tony have to work a little to take him, because that's just how big Steve is. Makes him feel even bigger. It's a damn good sight, too, good and getting even better, the way Tony's mouth stretches around his cock, lips quivering as he has to work for it, as he takes every inch. Steve's always liked a nice visual. And Tony, his Tony -- well, Tony makes the prettiest picture he's ever seen, trussed-up and desperate to make Steve come, to be good for him. Even while his mouth is on Steve, Tony's still frantic with need, unceasingly eager for it, wanting everything Steve's got.
Iron Man holds up one finger. "No, it's not you. You have nothing to do with it. You actually make me very, very happy. Trust me." Steve can just barely make out his smile behind the mouth-slit. But then the smile fades. "I'm just... not a happy person. Intrinsically. Whatever other people have that-- that makes them love themselves, or even like themselves, I don't have that. And this-- this
Tony narrates his actions to himself as he goes, in the hopes that doing so will provide some sort of justification. This was necessary. All this was necessary. One day, Steve will understand why this was necessary. Steve will forgive him. It had to be this way.
Concerned, Steve draws back and peers at him. "You all right?"
But Dane had been Thor's initial guess, and maybe that meant something. Hell, the guy even had a good reason to own a riding crop. They'd known each other a while and Tony hadn't really thought Dane had a secret crush on him... but maybe he was really good at keeping a secret. Plus, the guy had his own castle. He wore full plate armor of his own volition. Surely a guy like that could have something kinky going on; wasn't Tony himself proof of that? It took a certain kind of person to want to walk around in armor. You had to be a little bit weird. And, hey, Dane already liked metal, so maybe he liked vibranium.
Steve takes a deep breath. It's a reflex, because right now he doesn't actually need the air for anything. He's starting to feel, distantly, like he might be able to need to breathe again soon.
That news crew probably hadn't. Not at that distance. Steve shut his eyes in misery. Tiberius had killed his own people for-- for
"Right," Tony said, and he sat back on his heels and regarded Steve speculatively. "Nothing I can do about the ribs, so I think it's leg time, sweetheart. I'm assuming you would have told me already if it's your femur, so please say it's not."
Tony was dizzy and clammy; every inch of him that wasn't sticky with blood was damp with cold, cold sweat, but even with that, he felt hot. A paradox. He really wanted to be sick. The room was spinning.
Right now, his instincts were screaming at him.
"It's going to get better," she said. "I promise."
Tony wasn't looking at him. His gaze had gone unfocused. "The day I got to boarding school, the very first day, the other boys started calling me a pansy."
Iron Man laughs. "Hey," he asks, "so how about I introduce you to Monty Python after all?"
Startled, Steve's head shot up, and then he laughed. He was relaxing now. "Of course you figured out it was vibranium. You know what's in everything. I don't know why I'm even surprised anymore."
Well, that's an answer Steve definitely wasn't expecting.
Mordo laughed.
of him.
"Not to Tony, you haven't."
Steve takes another shaky breath. He can be brave. He can say this.
Still feels pretty rotten, though.
Pulling back the covers, Steve slides out of bed and stands up, making his way across the bedroom, out to the hallway, to the linen closet. He pulls out a few towels and then, after a moment's thought, a washcloth. He heads back in, and Tony -- who is sitting up now, legs dangling over the edge of the bed -- regards him with curiosity as Steve pivots and heads into the master bathroom.
"Yep," Tony said, on a sigh. His gaze looked faraway. "Except I also wasn't okay with the gay thing, so honestly you're starting out better than I was. And I've still got a way to go on that one. I'm aware."
Steve wished he'd punched Tiberius. It wouldn't have done any good, But he'd have deserved it.
He still hasn't said it. It's okay. Steve knows. They both know.
"Yeah," Steve agreed, disconsolately, the breath rattling out of him. "I know exactly what you mean."
"There you go," Tony said, with another smile. He pointed with the spatula at the glass of juice that was at his own place at the table. "Have the orange juice. Go on. I haven't touched it."
"Yeah, maybe," Steve echoes.
"Hello, dear," Tony says. His voice is raspy, but a smile flits across his mouth.
Honestly, Steve has wondered that too.
"Same goes for me," Steve said, with a smile.
"Mmm," Tony said. "That's debatable."
Steve just stares. "Who says it's a mistake?"
, Steve can accept that; it's not like he only wants Iron Man for his body, after all. But it would be nice to know. Maybe they'll talk about that, tonight.
Steve's underwear definitely wasn't hiding much of anything, and Tony sure didn't look like he minded. Tony looked, in fact, like he wanted to get right back to touching Steve as soon as possible.
This was a hell of a lot more than
Carol stepped inside, her mouth half open; her jaw dropped more as she looked around the room. It looked like she'd come in preparing to say something in particular but had been derailed by seeing what Steve was up to. Seemed reasonable. Steve was betting that everyone who wasn't Tony hadn't been expecting this -- and it wasn't as if Tony had been expecting it, when Steve had told him.
Steve finally looked up at him, a determined, defiant stare, like he was facing down a firing squad of his own making. His jaw clenched. His throat worked. "You know the box that Thor found today?"
Steve knew he was a little bigger than most guys, big enough that his size was sometimes intimidating to his partners. Honestly he sometimes wished he were a little smaller, if only so he wouldn't put people off. Then he felt odd about wishing that, because everyone knew guys weren't supposed to want that. But if this was what Tony wanted, then, God, for once in his life he was glad of it.
It's very convenient of Tony to set out his limits here; Steve has a history of not finding Tony's limits in other contexts until they've both tripped over the line. Tony hasn't talked about his past experience much, but it's clear that he's done more kink with Steve than he has with anyone else he's been with. Oh, he's definitely been eager, with Steve; Steve suspects most of Tony's past partners just haven't indulged him, or he never told them. So there have been several safewords called, this past year, because Tony doesn't always know his own limits. But Tony's clearly done this enough that he knows where he stands. And that's nice to hear.
Curious, Ghost cocks his head, evaluating Tony's unusual behavior. Then he shrugs. "No, huh? You really didn't like it when I phased my hand through your heart last year, did you?" he asks, and Steve thinks maybe that got left out of Tony's mission report. Dear God. Ghost pauses. His head tips up. Steve thinks he's probably smiling. "Must be my lucky day."
"Well," Tony said. "Now you've met my favorite Avenger." He rewarded Steve with an unexpected smile. Warmth blossomed in Steve's chest. It was a much better warmth. His face was only a little hot, now.
Tony meets Steve's eyes, his gaze both imploring and uncertain. "Steve?" he asks, his voice almost too soft for even Steve to hear. "Steve, could you--?" His voice trembles; he's afraid to ask, because right now he can't stand up in either the physical or emotional sense, and he doesn't want Steve to tell him no, because he knows he can't take hearing it. "I mean, would you-- would you mind...?"
He was dimly aware of grabbing Tony's shoulder tighter, of trying to bear down on Tony's finger like he could get him inside him if he just pushed, the sensation sending sparks of pleasure through him as he came and came and came. And because Tony didn't have to worry about swallowing, he just kept licking and sucking, the strokes of his hand gentling as he went. Steve was oversensitive, but he liked it like this, shuddering and shaking through the last of it until the last bit of pleasure was wrung out of him; too much was exactly what he wanted. Hell, it could probably get him there again if Tony would just keep going. But eventually Tony lifted his head.
Tony scoffs. "You're not required to lie to me."
He blinked, shook his head, and realized that Carol was going to collide with him fists-first in the next three seconds, oh,
"So if I could just have that box back," Steve continued, marshaling up an unbelievable amount of courage and once again looking Tony in the eye, "I'll be on my way."
"You really don't have to tell me if you don't want to." He realized that sounded bad. "I mean, if you want to, sure, of course you can tell me. But you don't need to put yourself through this for me, okay?"
He still had to figure out who this box belonged to, and he had one last chance for an answer. Maybe the final item would explain it all and help him find the owner.
"So from where I am," Steve concluded, "it's actually an immense relief to discover I only have feelings for one man. I meant it when I said it was the best surprise. I meant everything I said."
"Fear not!" Thor says, as always a touch too loud on the comms. "We shall vanquish these foes in thy stead, Iron Man!"
"Yeah," Tony said, echoing him, trying not to think about getting to
Tony had said he'd learned to stand up and fight. Captain America had taught him that, he'd said. He probably-- God, he probably thought Steve expected him to have fought back. Steve had learned to take on the bullies, all right. But there were some fights he'd never picked. A flood of memories cascaded through Steve's head. His stomach lurched.
There was an excruciating five seconds of silence. Steve sighed and pulled his cowl back. His hair was sticking up. It was, unfortunately, endearing. Tony had spent a whole decade being gone on him, so he did have some experience in the area. Steve's glare was less endearing.
"Cap?" Carol asked. "Hey, Cap, are you with me?"
Steve punches Ghost again. The air moves in front of him, and there's the sound of something heavy hitting the floor. It rings in one particular spot, almost metallic. That's probably the drive.
He turned right on red -- which, honestly, was probably the least of his sins at this point -- onto West 47th, and he didn't bother slowing down as he leaned into the turn. He was too fast, the turn too tight for his speed. He was cornering so hard that for a dizzying few seconds he thought he might actually come off the bike altogether in the middle of the damn intersection. He could picture his body skidding limp and broken across the pavement. He held his breath and he held tight as the bike shook beneath him and he tried desperately to find his center of gravity again. At the last possible moment, in this span of seconds that lasted an eternity of pounding heartbeats, he managed to straighten up.
"So, yes," Tony concluded. "I'll agree that he's a despicable human being, but also he's the kind of despicable human being who wouldn't have wanted to deliberately ruin his
Steve stared up at him, his face flushed and his hair a mess, as Tony ran one finger over Steve's dorky tighty-whities approximately one inch from where Tony was sure Steve would have preferred his finger to be. Tony had made teasing into a precise science, but he also very much planned to make good on his promises.
He couldn't tell Jan about the rest of the problem, of course, but right now dealing with this was more than enough.
It wasn't like Steve took special care with that kind of grooming, really, beyond making sure he was clean, which could already be a fairly involved task depending on who or what the Avengers had tangled with that day. Sometimes he added aftershave if he was feeling especially fancy. He sure hadn't bothered with any of that before he'd suited up to rescue Tony tonight. And he definitely didn't have the collection Tony did, a vast array of cologne bottles. What Tony wore always lasted longer, to Steve's nose, than it would have to most people. He could still smell whatever Tony had put on maybe last night, ever so faintly. He didn't know what it was, but it was something Tony had worn a few times before. Cedar, maybe. It was probably expensive. It was Tony, after all.
It was probably a good question.
This was getting confusing. "But the Sentient Armor wasn't her, right?" Steve asked. He'd been pretty sure about that. Then he had a horrible thought. "Please,
He turned and headed back the way he'd come, practically running. He needed to get out of here. Fast. His face was hot, everything in him tense and twisted, and he didn't think he could hold himself together much longer.
. He takes an agonizing time adjusting his tie in the mirror, like it needs to be perfect.
And here he was, blindsided again.
Trust Tony to science it all out. "Oh."
"And what's it really like," she asked, "dating Iron Man?"
That was clearly the word Tony had been waiting for. Tony grinned even wider, grabbed a handful of fabric at Steve's midsection, and started tugging Steve's shirt up for him. Steve sat up to make it easier, and then gasped at the feel of Tony's hands on his bare skin, Tony's fingers skimming lightly over the planes of his chest. He'd known what he'd asked for, but somehow he hadn't understood exactly what that would feel like until this moment. It was all so much, but somehow
Tony sighed. "I don't feel like I'm worth all that. I don't feel like I deserve it. I'm trying, but I-- it's hard. I'm just waiting for you to change your mind." He gestured at himself with his free hand. "I'm-- I'm a real piece of work. I'm a mess. Somehow you still think I'm a real catch, but I'm not. My public reputation is in tatters. I've been sobbing in your arms all night. You know every single one of my deepest flaws and my worst mistakes. And I was in Ty's bed
crying, tears streaking down his face. "Do it now. Please. I-- I need him. I need him back."
Steve's always been a man of action, and a man of his word, even when his word has only been given to himself. When he says he's going to do a thing, he does it. So when he promises himself that he'll ask Iron Man out the next day, he knows in his heart that he means it.
He's had Extremis for a week now, and he's still glorying in the possibilities, the idea that now he can be
He ruthlessly cut that thought off.
He really
And then Tony spoke. "You're not the first person who's ever asked me that, you know. I have a lot of enemies. You're nowhere near the worst of them." He sounded almost contemplative. "You know what the answer is? You're looking at the wrong things." And then he rounded on Tiberius, and his voice rang out. "So I cried a lot. So what? So I got the shit beaten out of me on a regular basis by a whole lot of people who were a whole lot bigger than me. So what? So I'm as queer as a three dollar bill." Tony's voice trembled ever so slightly. "Again,
. He's got him.
"You probably want to know what changed my mind, huh?" Tony asked. He made a sound that wasn't quite a laugh. "Or maybe you don't. But I guess I'll never know if you hang up on this, will I?" He sighed. "You're not going to like it, but here goes. Right after that interview of yours aired, I got a call from Trevor Donahue. He said he wanted to meet with me. So I figured, hey, this was the guy who was trying to kill me, so I should go. You know me; I'd walk right into a bear trap if it had my name on it."
"You don't have to do it," Steve said, and there was something gentle in his gaze now, something warm and forgiving. "But if I wanted to see me I'd look in the damn mirror. I want to see
Steve let his gaze glide back up Tony's bare legs. Tony had amazing thighs. Tony was still wearing Steve's t-shirt and sensible black boxer-briefs -- a few hours ago Steve had been valiantly trying not to pay attention to any of the details -- and right now he was very, very hard. His cock was an obvious outline in the tight fabric; there wasn't much left to the imagination. Steve could make out the shape of him, the slight dampness of the fabric, the tiniest quivers of movement as Tony grew harder and harder.
Steve smiled back. "Glad to be of service."
Steve turns and walks out. He doesn't look behind him, even when he hears Tony start to cry.
"Tell me you've got something," he pants out. "
"For you, Winghead? Of course. Always." Iron Man's already starting to take a few steps in his direction.
"Do you want kids?"
Tony's voice cracks with concern. "Steve? What's the matter?"
It's really kind of a metaphor for the whole evening, he thinks, glumly.
Steve felt his mouth curving into a smile -- nothing was funny, he was just scared -- and it was Tony's concern to stare at him in confusion. Steve couldn't hold back a nervous chuckle.
The words seem to be chosen with uncommon delicacy. Tony wonders just how obvious his feelings are.
He'd been expecting cold, unyielding metal, or -- at the very best -- room-temperature, but Iron Man is pleasantly toasty. Not burning, not hot to the touch, just nicely warm. He's not quite at human-normal, but he's pretty close to it. It's-- well, it feels
"I think somebody turned out the lights," Tony said, trying for levity, as the HUD flickered and died.
. His libido sure doesn't need any more encouragement.
One: Thor was holding a riding crop.
God, he just wants Tony to be here. With him. For as long as he can.
He lifts, and the chestplate clicks and comes off in his hands. There's something Tony could never have done when Steve first met him, not that Steve knew it. But Tony's heart is all mechanical now, the chestplate unnecessary for survival, and Tony smiles at Steve, a little shaky, as Steve eases the chestplate away and sets it very carefully down. He takes care of Tony's armor the way he takes care of Tony; he's never quite stopped thinking of the armor as another part of Tony. He's gentle with it. Tender. It's precious. Just like Tony.
Steve went several shades paler. His eyes were wide. He nodded, a curt jerk of his chin, and then he drew himself up a little straighter, and Tony watched the mantle of Captain America settle over him.
"Okay," Tony said, and he poked Steve in the shoulder with one armored finger, missing a little, and getting his upper arm instead. That probably should have been concerning, but Tony really didn't care. He'd had worse. "One, neither of us owns our current team residence, two, we are actually in an incredibly sketchy warehouse, and three, I can joke about whatever I want and you can't stop me."
Backing up, he makes it across the room with some difficulty. He's so hard that he's not quite sure how he's still walking. But at least he manages it. Tony's still just staring, blinking at him, and he doesn't say a word as Steve mutes one card and grabs the other.
So it's familiar, being with Tony when he's like this. But it's not on offer, because that wasn't something that Tony offered. So that's not what they're doing tonight. It doesn't mean Steve can't think about it, though, his mind offering up the smallest details: sweat running down the curve of Tony's neck, the way Tony's body yields, that
"I can't walk," Tony repeats. His voice is nowhere near as strong as it should be. "I can't even stand up. There are servos in the armor. They're programmed to assist with balance and movement. The whole thing's holding me up. Sometimes I-- well, you know." Steve definitely does not know. "Sometimes I have to do that. Like now."
The flattened, circular base of the plug wasn't featureless, as Tony had been expecting. In fact, it bore the last thing he had ever expected to see: Iron Man's face. It was a little relief in miniature, the faceplate painted gold, the rest of the red helmet a hint of striated metal at its edges, done up with a little bit of a shimmer to stand out from the red background. It was clearly meant to be a depiction of the old Model IV, and -- Tony thought with a near-hysterical edge -- it was actually pretty damn accurate. Much like everything else in this box, it had been made with exacting care.
He expected the question to make Tony angry. To make him furious. To make him raise his voice again. But Tony shut his eyes, and when he opened them again, there was only anguish in them. His eyes reflected too much light. He looked like he was about to cry.
Steve smiled back. "I'm not going to laugh at you. It's a nice thought. It's a really nice thought."
So he works his way up Tony's back, lightly, just enough right now to get the blood flowing, to let Tony's skin absorb the oil from his hands. He's not trying to actually work the soreness out of any of Tony's muscles out yet; that's for later. Tony makes inarticulate noises of happiness, muffled against his own hands.
"You already did."
"Ah, Mr. Stark!" Wong says, somehow still gracious. "What can we do for you?"
"I don't know what Tony's told you," he said, and Jesus Christ, he was
, and then there was Tony. Steve knew -- had always known, really -- that he couldn't keep up. Of course Tony was going to want friends who were on his level. It made sense. He couldn't offer Tony that.
Tony's face is the picture of skepticism. He waves his hand vaguely in Steve's direction. "Winghead, you could have your pick of anyone in the whole goddamn world."
Steve thought about strangling Tiberius. It would be quick.
"We'll be absolutely fine," Tony reassured her. He wasn't thrilled about magic, of course, but Mordo was only one man. It was hard to imagine much of anything going wrong. "But I think the more important question, for our purposes, is
"Oh, yeah?" Steve knew he was smiling. "Going to let me have a chance?"
Tony must be cold, because it doesn't take any more convincing to get Tony to come over to the blanket. Tony sits down, picks up a blanket, wraps it around himself, but he doesn't come closer. And he's still shivering. It's not going to be enough.
And then Tony got it. His head snapped up. His face was pale. "Steve...?"
"No, no!" Steve holds up his hands. "It's okay. That's not what I want to know."
Steve opens his eyes and he's human again. His face is even more flushed, and there's sweat coursing down the hollow of his throat. When Steve finally, gently, pulls out, Tony feels his come trickling out of him, dripping down his thighs. It's a mess, but Tony likes it like that.
-- in the direction Tiberius had gone. Then he glanced over at Steve, still smiling. "So?" Tony murmured. "What did you think of him?"
Steve knew he had to be gentle with Tony, because Tony was afraid. Not of him. Not of what they were doing. That much was obvious. But he was clearly afraid to assert himself. He was a traveler in uncharted land. With no map, he didn't know the boundaries.
"Little bit lower." Tony managed to marshal enough energy to provide directions. "There's a hidden catch just under the jaw, on the side there, just wide enough for a couple fingers. You'll feel it. Press in and up, like you're lifting it out."
He already has the setting planned out: in the kitchen, in the morning, over coffee. Iron Man can't drink hot coffee, of course, but he likes to have iced coffee through a straw. Even though Iron Man doesn't live at the mansion like Steve does -- none of the rest of the team lives here full-time -- somehow he's always the first one there after Steve gets up. By the time Steve comes back from his morning run, Iron Man is usually there in the kitchen, slurping away; if there's no Avengers business for the day and he's not needed immediately to guard Mr. Stark over at SI, then he usually has some time to spare for Steve. It'll be perfect.
That sounded like a yes to Tony.
"No, no, no!" Jan said, quickly. "It's not bad." She amended herself. "It's not bad for
," Tony repeats, and, oh, this is how it's going to go.
"Great!" Tony said. His eyes were sparkling, his smile wide. He was
"You're smart," Steve repeated. "But Tiberius, he's smart too. So he knows you're smart. And he knows you. He knows how to say something exactly the right way, so it will make sense to you, so you'll believe it. And he's good at it. Everything he says sounds right. Everything he says sounds like it makes sense. But it's all lies, Tony. It's all lies underneath." He fumbled for an example, the kind of example he thought Tony might like. "It's like when you learn how to do a proof, a mathematical proof." Steve had taken geometry once. In 1935. He hoped it hadn't changed all that much. "And all the steps are right. All the logic is right. But the premise is wrong. The thing you're starting from is wrong. But if you don't look at that, if you just look at the logic, it looks fine to you. Because that part checks out. And you don't look at the part that's wrong. It's like that, Tony. That's what it's like."
But when Ghost touches him this time a control on Ghost's wrist blinks blue, and suddenly Steve feels odd, like his skin is too tight all over. Ghost knocks him backwards, back down to the floor, and they're sliding across the floor toward the window, Ghost clinging to him like a goddamn barnacle.
Thirty-eight minutes in, Stephen opens his eyes and drops his hands. Sweat is beading on his forehead. "Done," he says, with finality. Tony can imagine he used to put down a scalpel and say the same thing.
"Yes, of course," Steve says, hurriedly, tongue nearly tripping over the words. "Of course I can. Come here, come here--"
That was Tony. He still cared. Of course he did. And Tony was still smiling that ever-present smile as he got up, but there was a shadow darkening it now. A shadow Tiberius had put there.
Then Steve's earpiece crackled to life. He was still on Avengers comms, because if there was an emergency, he needed to know about it. This was the worst timing in the world, though.
Steve be glad? He could have
Tony was squinting at him. "I spent the whole evening sobbing on your shoulder and regaling you with stories of everyone I was too stupid not to love, then demanding I prove that this is reality. That's not exactly endearing. And I'm sure you never imagined you'd have to put up with any of this when you met me. That, and you've spent the whole week telling me I was wrong about Ty. I didn't listen to you. Obviously I've let you down."
Steve stepped back and let the refrigerator door swing shut.
And even if there were, Tony would never forgive him.
It was all details, anyway. Tiberius' mentor seemed as close to a reliable source as anyone could have hoped for. It had to be right. And, at any rate, like Tony had said, it was all going to be over. So the details didn't matter anymore.
Eventually, behind a little tub of Vaseline, Steve finds a mostly-full bottle of lavender-scented body oil. That's got to be the right one. He fishes it out and holds it up for inspection anyway.
"It does," Steve said. "I'm getting there. So Clive invites Maurice to come visit him at his country estate and meet his wife, and Maurice agrees, and Clive is just so happy because this means Maurice has now seen the light, so to speak, and accepted everything. That Maurice has gotten over him and maybe he'll see how great being straight is."
Tiberius tried to reach for Tony. His arm still wasn't working right. His hand jerked. "Tony--"
Tony stared off into the distance, breathing deeply. It was a long time before he spoke.
"I'm sorry," Steve rasps. "I'm really sorry. I have to take this." Tony looks like he's about to
Steve nods; he can feel his face heat up even as the rest of the blood in his body keeps heading south. "I'm good," he says, hoarsely. "Maybe-- maybe a little too good."
And the thing about aftercare is that there's a good chance that's actually true.
Mr. Stark's on his feet now. He's a little shaky, but he's still standing. And somehow he's still smiling. But his lips waver. He's clearly on the verge of tears.
"You-- you don't have to," Tony says, misinterpreting Steve's silence entirely. "It's okay, I just--"
It took an obscene amount of alcohol to get Steve properly drunk, a good solid can't-feel-my-face level of inebriation, and if not for the fact that the mansion was currently dry for Tony and Carol's sake, he'd actually have considered shutting himself in his room with high-proof liquor and attempting it. It wasn't like Tony was going to be around to be hurt by it. But they'd all agreed not to drink at home, and going out to a bar would also have meant actually talking to people. That was a no. Just being alone would have to be enough.
He didn't know how to come out. He didn't know how to say it. This was all he could manage.
He knew he didn't have the most suave way with words -- no, that was Tony's gift -- but he didn't think it was going to put Tony off any.
Steve stood up fast, wobbling. Tony stared up at him.
He can't make himself say it, but he doesn't need to.
The smallest of smiles curves across Mr. Stark's face. "That's very sweet, but there are, in fact, a few other things that matter."
Steve suspected most of the Avengers were going to have the same reaction. They were going to be happy for them. He just knew it.
Maybe Steve was just seeing things. Tiberius was Tony's friend, after all. If there were something wrong with him, surely Tony would have noticed. It had to be okay.
wished he'd punched Tiberius.
He was across the room in an instant, and Tony took two halting steps forward and collapsed heavily into Steve's embrace, as if he'd run out of strength to hold himself up anymore. That was okay. Steve could be strong enough for both of them right now.

wasn't right, because Steve was right here, next to him. Steve was crouching next to him, rolling him onto his back. Tony could just barely make out Steve's face, pale and drawn, through the eye-slits of his helmet.
"Yes...?" From his tone of voice, Tony definitely hadn't expected Steve to name that night. It was a puzzle Tony couldn't piece together. "You mean, the time I spent twenty minutes telling you how armor class worked?" he asked, incredulous.
If Steve were a different kind of man, a charming flirt like Tony is, he'd have some witty, innuendo-laden retort to match him. If Steve were the kind of man who liked talking about his damn feelings, he'd say something soft, urgent, sympathetic.
"You skipped a step."
"I bet," Tony said. "You must have been shocked."
Steve wondered if he was going to stand back and let him.
"Last night," Tony rasped, like he was crawling across broken glass. "Last night, I was
He takes a breath. He composes himself, stills his expression. He hopes he looks-- gentle. Kind. Whatever Tony needs him to be. He can be that.
Mr. Stark doesn't answer Steve's messages. Neither does Iron Man -- at least until the next morning, when Steve gets a text message that just says,
He had no idea what to say to that, other than that he wanted it too, had wanted exactly the same thing, but that was too terrifying, too much of a risk. Too many things could go wrong. He couldn't let himself believe this.
Not that it took a lot of effort to imagine that. Now who was the coward?
Steve's hands must have slipped in all the blood, because he shifted position, bringing a fresh wave of terrible sensation. Everything hurt. Everything hurt so damn much. He was so very, very tired.
"I want to be more than your friend," Tony clarified.
Tony nuzzled the base of his cock, licked up the shaft, and then took the head into his mouth.
Iron Man's gaze pauses very significantly on the bed. Steve hasn't bothered getting different sheets since he moved in -- why, says his Depression upbringing, when the ones he has now are still good? -- so he's left with the ones Mr. Stark had outfitted the room with for him. They're very... patriotic, striped boldly in red, white, and blue.
He didn't see Tony for the rest of that day, or for the day after that.
Okay, so it meant that one of the two of them had a crush on Tony, and living with that knowledge was going to be a little weird, but at least he wasn't on the East Coast team with either of them. And besides, he wasn't going to let them know that he knew what was in the box. He was going to pack it up, crop and all, and hand it back over to its rightful owner. No awkwardness required. No public embarrassment necessary. Nothing to be ashamed of. No hint of the fact that Tony had examined the box's contents. He wasn't going to ask them for dungeon recommendations or the name of whoever had made them all their gorgeous gear, much as he wanted to. The existence of the plug changed all that. Tony couldn't let them know that he knew what was inside the box.
"Bearable?" Steve said, incredulous. "He's the one who made it hellish in the first place--"
That had been half an hour ago, and the intervening time had been both the best and worst half-hour of Steve's life.
not his secret. If it had just been him, that would have been a different question. Steve still didn't know if he was brave enough to be able to come out to anyone at all -- God, he didn't know how he could risk his life every day and still be so terrified of this -- but at least that part of the secret affected only him. But it wasn't just about him, was it?
There was panic in his gaze, and they all watched another SHIELD car swoop over the building.
But Steve was going to be at his side, so everything was going to be absolutely fine, and then they could get back to a very important conversation.
Oh, God.
He's not going to give Tony's secrets away to get him out of this.
Halfway through swallowing, Tony coughed and nearly choked on his water. But he was grinning. "God, do I ever need that right now."
There's rustling behind him, and when Steve is finally down to his underwear and his undershirt, he turns around to see that Tony, still shivering, has made his way under the covers, which are pulled up practically to his neck. Tony regards him in silence, wide-eyed; his mouth is a taut, thin line.
Oh, hell. He'd forgotten about that part. "I'm sorry," Steve said. "You can pick something else."
that you realized I was actually laying a trap, you went with it. Even though you had no idea what I was doing, you still went with it. You trusted me, instinctually. That's belief. What is that if not belief? You trusted me, with your whole heart, immediately."
, Steve had told them both.
One quirk of the serum is that Steve's always run a little warm, ever since Tony's known him. His temperature's never outrageously high, but whenever the Avengers have had occasion to get his vitals, he's always at least 99. Tony likes it. Steve's always pleasantly toasty. He's nice in the winters. It's not like Tony only likes him for his warmth, but, well, he has some bad associations with snowstorms. So, on the whole, Tony really enjoys the fringe benefits.
fantasy.
Tony's eyes lit up; he was smiling like Steve had just handed him an unexpected present. It looked like Tony, too, was enjoying the novelty of being able to act on his desires. He raised his hand, his palm skimming over Steve's stomach not quite touching him. "You want--?"
Even Steve had heard the rumors. Everyone had. It wasn't as if the tabloids had ever left Tony alone. It was just that, before last week, Steve had had absolutely no reason to think the rumors could be true.
Tiberius smiled broadly, and Steve knew that Tiberius had him exactly where he wanted him. They both knew it.
No, this is all for Steve.
"Is that it?" Ghost demands, impatient.
"Anytime, partner!" Iron Man returns.
"Yeah?"
Tony still looks like he might cry again, but somehow he has the presence of mind to comfort him.
"No," Tony says, softly. "No, my parents were already dead by then. Car accident." He sighs. "About three years ago now, when I'd had SI for about a year, I went to Afghanistan as a consultant for the military. I tripped over a landmine and was captured and imprisoned." His gaze is very far away. "My cellmate was a professor by the name of Ho Yinsen. He helped me design and build the first version of the chestplate, to keep my heart beating, as well as the first version of Iron Man. He died to buy me time. I-- I took the suit and ran. And that's how I became Iron Man. That's the truth."
It's not a dealbreaker.
Abruptly, Steve remembered Tony and Tiberius kissing. He remembered every detail vividly; his memory was never going to let him forget. Tiberius' hand had been at Tony's waist, starting to slide up under his shirt. Tony's hand had been around Tiberius' wrist. Steve had assumed Tony had been encouraging him, welcoming his touch. Steve had, in fact, been jealous of everything Tony had let Tiberius do to him.
Steve stops; he's hit his mark now, an actor waiting for the spotlight -- or, when he thinks about it, the exact opposite. "No, thank you."
, so much," Steve temporizes, trying to find a way not to speak ill of Mr. Stark. Iron Man does work for him, after all, and Mr. Stark is kind enough to fund the Avengers -- even if he insists on saying infuriating and insulting things about Iron Man. "But this is Mr. Stark's workshop, and I thought maybe you'd asked him to help with... whatever you're planning. So I was expecting him, I suppose."
. Theaters in his days used to have columns, balconies, painted murals, an organist to play during intermission. Sure, maybe Steve never had enough money for the really nice theaters, the ones that were velvet all over with gilded trim. He was lucky if he had a nickel for the double feature. But even at the kinds of places Steve went to, you used to dress up. You made an occasion of it, because there wasn't much else to do.
to me. Wouldn't you say?"
But right now, it just meant that Steve didn't have to hold back. He didn't have to pull his punches. He could just... fight.
," Steve said, in a tone of voice he thought he usually reserved for telling Clint to cut out whatever he was doing.
. "And I'm still here. I've survived. I've survived all of it. You can't hurt me anymore. Not in any way that counts. I know who I am. And, if I come out, I know my real friends will be behind me, and that's what really matters." His gaze sought out Steve's.
"I love you," Steve told him again. "I love you and I'm not going anywhere." He kissed Tony's forehead, the only part of him he could easily reach. "Sweet dreams."
Tony shoved his face into Steve's shoulder, as if being able to physically occupy the same space as Steve was the only thing that could possibly make him feel better about any of this. Steve gingerly rubbed Tony's shoulders. His muscles were knotted with tension.
Steve smiles at him. "It's perfect," he says, softly, and he means
Tony is actually surprised by how much this hurts.
"Oh," Tony said, dumbfounded. That was-- yeah, he was going to need a bit of time to process that.
And maybe he was in real life, sure, but it was a game. Steve wanted to
Tony vaguely remembers Steve taking it. Tony takes a lot of pictures with people. It would never have occurred to him that Steve would have done anything like this with it. He would have expected a picture of Sharon here, if anything. Surely Steve and Sharon are still an item. Steve wouldn't have put a picture of
If nothing else, Steve could try to pick up the pieces.
"And here we are," he said, unnecessarily, his voice too loud in his ears. "You should hop off first."
Huh. Maybe...?
Tony was probably worrying he was getting cold feet. After all, Steve hadn't done this before, and it wasn't like he wasn't nervous, a little. Every step took him farther and farther into new territory. But he wanted this. He did. It was just a little hard to say, because it was new, because it was okay now when it hadn't been okay before.
"--if this is pity, I don't want it." Tony's voice was tight. He looked like
He already knew what the reason was. He always knew what the reason was. In the end, no one really wanted Tony. Steve would probably have a different way to say it, of course. Some way to soften the blow. But there was only ever the same reason.
Steve hadn't heard of Tiberius Stone until that morning at breakfast. Maybe that ought to have been a warning sign.
Tony's mouth quivered like he was trying not to smile. "We'll have to test that out sometime, maybe. If you want. I won't mind if you fail at that, though. I, uh. I like it a lot when you say my name."
Was he serious? Steve studied Tony's face. He looked... nervous. Like he actually wasn't sure if Steve had liked it. Was there something Steve had been meant to do differently? Had he somehow not been
The man laughed. "You're the one walking around with near-infinite energy in your chest, Stark. I was thinking about cutting in line and... mmm... just cutting it out of you?"
"It's me."
Turning around, Tony drawled, "It could be." He was still smiling. "Number one at last, huh?"
"Good, good," Tony said. "Let me hear you. Come on."
"You're very welcome," Iron Man says, as he watches Eddie stick the stickers on his ash-streaked t-shirt. "See, there, now you have a Captain America one. That's the best one. He's my favorite Avenger."
"You already read the title and author," Steve pointed out. "But if you want to keep going, anything is fine. Here." He reached over to Tony's lap, opened the book at random. "Just wherever that is. That's probably fine."
His boyfriend had most likely set the entire thing up.
Still, Steve supposes Mr. Stark is giving him his blessing, in his own way.
But he knows what he wants.
"I know," Tony said, "I know. I trust you."
There's the faintest trace of a smile behind the darkness of the mouth-slit. "You're better than I deserve," he says, and Steve doesn't know what to say to that.
"Then what?" Steve asks.
He sat back down on the bed, passed the phone over, and then swung his legs up to stretch out again, because if he had a choice about it he was going to stay right next to Tony for as long as possible.
Iron Man crackles and coughs. "Don't," he breathes, his voice so close to human and yet so distorted by the intermittent filter that Steve can barely make out what he's saying. "Steve, no,
There was an odd look in Tony's eyes; Steve couldn't quite interpret it. "Not at all," Tony said, a little too lightly. "I'm just suggesting that maybe you don't know yourself as well as you think you do." He smiled again. He had something on his mind, but Steve had no idea what. "Maybe you ought to re-examine some of your cherished beliefs about what you want to do with me, hmm?"
Tony's smile was dark and dangerous, promising pleasure that made Steve hot all over with just the thought of it. "Oh, but I want to do so much with you," he murmured.
to him. Haven't we?"
The shield passes straight through Ghost's head. Ghost's whole body ripples as the shield slides harmlessly through him. He's intangible. Steve stares in dismay. Spinning, the shield sails over the back of the chair, hits the wall and bounces off. A few seconds later, Steve catches it on the rebound, fingers closing around the rim of the shield as frustration wells up in his chest.
"That's it," Tony assures him. The nervousness in Tony's voice is real, though. "That's the password for you."
They could build something new after all. Together.
"Shellhead, no!" Steve says. "Please. You can't do this. I don't want you to do this."
, they called it," he adds, and Tony may not know Irish but he knows German just fine. "They were trying to... see if they could induce it in their captives." He shudders. "And they were testing the progression on people who had it, keeping them away from their, uh, their beloved, so they could never confess, and seeing how long it took them to-- uh. Well."
Steve was shaking his head more violently, looking miserable. "You don't-- sometimes stuff isn't
Steve drew a ragged breath. "Like that, Tony, just like that, all of that. All of that and
've hurt me, Steve. What, are you going to tell me that that's different?"
God, now Tiberius even had
Steve's never been very good with relationships. While falling in love with a Nazi spy was an inauspicious start to his love life, it wasn't like he'd done much better with Betsy and Peggy than he had with Cynthia.
The last time Steve had touched Tony was a friendly clap to the shoulder, when he'd told him he hadn't wanted to be an Avenger like he'd expected Tony to be happy about it.
