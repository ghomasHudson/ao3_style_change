Natasha nodded and led them to the living room. They seemed well aware of how she used to work and on one hand she appreciated it, - it was cool not to have to explain herself and her behavior - but on the other, she didn’t know them. She was vulnerable.
The Avengers sat on the couches and picked a movie, just like tradition, and soon forgot about everything else but the protagonists and the crazy situations they were in.
“Excuse me,” Tony snapped, only half joking, “they deserve an entire show! And a beautiful season finale.”
Bruce murmured under his breath something that sounded like “here’s the freak out”, but Tony didn’t even notice, still blabbering.
The kids followed her, holding hands behind her back as to give each other strength. They were really different and yet so similar, with the same lost expression.
“That would be better, yeah,” agreed Steve in that second, walking into the room still in his costume, dirty of mud and blood, eyes tired but a smile on his lips.
“I’ll talk to him,” Clint said and followed him, ignoring Tony’s surprised look; he was sure the man liked his kids, but he never saw him actually spend time with them if others weren’t in the room, so… It was weird seeing him this interested.
“Sir,” Friday interrupted them after a few minutes. “Our guests just asked me what metro line could take them as far as possible from here and what will the weather be in the next few days.”
“Tony!” Steve tried again and at that moment all the metallic noises that had been so hard to stand stopped, substituted by the ones of waves. Tony turned and smiled, a full
“Just say the word, Pops,” Alex smirked, before even registering his own words. He winced and got back on his seat, retreating and putting as much space as he could between him and Steve. “I didn’t - I didn’t mean…”
Bruce snorted and ate a cookie - in every place of the Tower there was food, hidden either by Tony or by Darcy; the first one wanted to piss Pepper off, since she tried so hard to keep everything in order, while Darcy just wanted to make sure “her scientists” ate something, once or twice per day.
They said nothing else, before hugging. Clint kept him in his arms who knows how long, rubbing his spine in what he hoped was a comforting gesture; Alex didn’t cry, but he strengthened his grip and felt like a part of him was dying.
It’s simple, Steve thought. That “it’s not” she blurted was totally unexpected, and just because she finally said something it didn’t mean she was now able to fully talk. Whatever made her silent was still there - it just broke down for a second.
Finally I can post the chapter! I had it ready for a while, but I wanted to make you a surprise... You can find it at the end of the chapter
Every journalist in the room straightened up, eyes on the Avengers’ table; after all, that matter was the reason for the conference.
I'm so sorry I'm late and that this chapter is shorter than usual, but college has been crazy. I don't think I'm gonna be able to post a new chapter, but from June on i should be more like usual.
After the morning training session, however, he had insisted on collecting some other data, and this time Natasha had stepped up, under Tony slightly worried eyes. He knew she would have never really hurt them, but somehow seeing them end up on the mattress time after time still bothered him.
“It’s world trading hashtag all over the social medias. Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, Facebook and all that jazz,” Darcy continued.
They were resting on the couch when it happened. It was late and the kids were tired, because that morning Bucky had trained with them just like old times - except it wasn’t, it wasn’t at all, because their uncle had died and this one was a different person… And almost exactly like the other one, too -, while Bruce took notes. His interest was both scientific and personal, truth to be told, for the simple fact that Alex and Rey had got under his skin too, somehow, while he wasn’t looking, while he wasn’t paying attention.
“You know what? We shouldn’t talk about this,” Tony declared, taking a sip from the glass of scotch he had previously taken - once in a while couldn’t hurt.
A crazy scientist had the great idea to try recreating a dinosaur, mixing his genes with the ones of some kind of bird - it had to be that way, because the result was more like a dragon than anything else.
. I’ve been thinking about children, but just ‘cause… I don’t know, maybe not right away? I have time. But yeah, a couple of kids wouldn’t be bad,” he muttered. He glanced at Alex and Rey, and saw them leaving.
, Iron Man!, by her side, so Alex wasn’t really worried. That’s until that man, that criminal, turned his entire body into sand and swallowed Rey, suffocating her scream.
“I should have told you,” he continued. “It’s just that… Our lives were always controlled and spied by the world, each move judged, every word weighted. It was hard.”
She made him think about all those soldiers he had lost in battle and, above all, those who had survived. They’d never been the same.
The truth was that the day before the Soldier had destroyed him, but there was no need for the others to know.
He hugged her and danced and laughed, and it was so full of joy that it made everyone smile - or, in Darcy’s and Steve’s case, hide the tears.
“It’s okay, it’s okay,” he murmured, but he was actually starting to freak out as well. He shot Steve a look, but he was too focused on the kids to notice.
Alex shut her out completely, focused on his task and his sister - it was impossible, for him, to ignore Rey, after a life spent taking care of her. He jumped from a building and let himself fall for a couple of seconds, before flying fast to the side of one of those criminals; they were called the Sinister Six and, honestly, he could see the reason.
“I don’t really think they want to talk,” Steve mumbled. He decided to step forward anyway, stretching his muscles as best as he could; the others imitated him soon after.
The siblings were fighting each other, in a complex sequence of kicks, punches, gymnastic moves and headlocks that made Steve really proud - they sure knew how to defend themselves. There was something, anyway, that made him frown. The kids looked wrecked and every move was filled with anger and a lot of pain.
“You’re okay,” Alex murmured. He seemed surprised and so, so happy… It made Steve’s heart break a little.
“Ultron’s gone,” Alex was repeating. When the concept finally got under his skin, he turned to talk to his sister… And found out she had built a little robotic eagle; it moved its wings and Rey smiled, delighted.
A stunned silence filled the room and it was just because of the lack of talking that the Avengers were capable of hearing a door slamming in the distance.
“Tony’s words really hurt them,” Natasha whispered after a few moments. Bucky, who was fixing his hair at her side, nodded.
“It’s okay, Alex. Everything is fine,” Steve murmured, looking at Tony because he had already understood the topic; meeting his eyes, he realized he wasn’t the only one.
Refusing to acknowledge the little smile across his face, Alex got inside and let the door close behind him. He was so confused he barely felt like a human being, but by the time the elevator brought him to the others he was fine again - even though Pietro had ran there before him.
“Yeah, right. HYDRA - or Ultron, they were connected - found a way to separate Bruce from The Hulk,” Alex murmured. He blushed from discomfort.
It was actually yes, a way to protect their identities for a little bit, but also a way to buy him time to
Bucky shot him a look that meant “kick yourself or I’m gonna do it” and Steve realized that the girl - he was sure her name was Rey or something alike - never spoke in front of them. Her friend, however, seemed easier to talk to… And to obtain an answer from.
“We got back to the new place we were living in - we couldn’t use the Tower, it was too easy to hit - and I remember very little of that moment. Just that you told uncle Bruce what happened on the jet, so that when he started turning from the pain you… Threw him off. I think uncle Bucky helped me shower because I wasn’t… Rey and pops… Who knows.”
Alex looked at his sister, and in a second Steve thought about how badly, the day before, he had wished to have a kid just like her. He was old and yet so young, and Alex and Rey came as a surprise - they came destroyed, from a world full of war and desperation. A world that left them with scars and nightmares.
“It’s too much,” Tony declared, speaking for the first time since they noticed the news on the social medias.
“I was even in love, in the other world,” he exclaimed. “In love, you understand? And I miss him!” his voice got higher than normal and he laughed again. “I miss him like crazy!”
“It’s not the only thing I’m scared of, though,” Steve admitted. He turned slightly toward the man of his dreams, but he didn’t meet his eyes.
“From another universe,” Tony shrugged. “It’s not like I ever wanted them. I never signed up for this.”
“Yeah,” Alex nodded, every memory from that day dancing in front of his eyes. Tired as ever, he started talking.
“Sounds legit. Rey looked really shocked when they said that Tony’s body was found,” Bucky reasoned, eating his bacon with a shrug. “Maybe she found it - him - herself.”
“It was a risk you shouldn’t have taken,” Natasha snapped, looking out of the window as to find an answer.
“Cap, breathe,” Tony ordered, touching his arm, and it looked like the world had been turned upside down. Tony was now the calm one, and Steve was freaking out.
Clint snorted, stopping and glancing at the ground, where he was doing push-ups. “Thinking about children now?”
“Of course we know! You created a cradle, Tony! A cradle! Just because you wanted so badly to have kids! It must mean something!”
“We have also some tests to take. But first...” Bruce smirked trying to sound as relaxed as possible. However, he didn’t get to finish to talk because the kid threw himself against the circle - Steve really had to find out the name of that thing.
“Okay,” Steve smiled. He moved and took Tony with him, getting near the window. He stared at New York and started talking, refusing to look at the man by his side. “I’m terrified,” he confessed.
It was almost surprising the speed Tony had at that point. He ran towards the window, while pieces of his suit followed him and started composing on his body.
Peter, for example, had lost the ability to do basically anything, because Rey had hugged him and she was still holding onto him, face hidden in his chest. He knew she could hear his heart.
“Guys,” Bruce smiled sweetly, stopping everyone to talk even more. “There’s no need. I don’t… I don’t want to have hope when in our world it’s impossible to…”
He looked so excited, so happy and eager to help, that Steve actually felt he was looking into a mirror. He thought about how many times he had tried to join the army, lying again and again and again.
“Long story,” Alex mumbled, taking a bite of a pancake. It’s not that he didn’t want to talk about it, but… It felt distant. Like a dream, almost - or a nightmare. Or, even worse, like this new life, with the Avengers and all the commodities of a world without war, was the dream - and one day, who knows when, he’d wake up to Ultron’s cold hands around his neck. His sister’s blood all over the place. That monster’s smirk looking down at him.
“Where are you, son?!” Steve asked, already dressed as Captain America - Alex shot him a look but said nothing, because jealousy was the stupidest thing he could be feeling at the moment. Also, he probably used the word “son” with everyone who was younger than him.
The truth was that almost every Avenger had tried to occupy the kids’ days, going out or in the labs or in the training rooms, to minimize Steve’s absence.
He blurted it and immediately breathed loudly, shock and happiness and fear and pride running through his veins. He knew, of course, that no one in the Avengers would have ever judged him, but still - it was something he had never said out loud, nor told anyone who wasn’t his sister.
This made him jump and get out of the lab as fast as he could, because not even three months had passed since Gwen’s… Since Gwen, and the idea of feeling anything
“Sam!” Sam cried, hugging himself. “I missed you so much, man! Me too! How was the mission? Oh, you know, same old bloody stuff, but the thought of coming back to you… Oh, Sam, you’re so sweet! I love you so much, Sa-”
”, like he was going to call him “uncle Clint”. It’s not a coincidence, guys,” she continued at that point. “We thought they knew us from the news, but what if it was something more? I mean,” she turned to face Tony, “Rey basically has your IQ and Alex looks like your supersoldier version.”
“I know we should have gone to shower,” Sam said smiling as well, “but Steve insisted to come here first.”
“Could you let me go now?” the boy requested with a deep breath; Thor immediately left him and the stranger did not lose time. He ran to the girl and hugged her as his life depended on that.
Steve, sensing like everyone else that something was wrong, interrupted him. “It’s alright, son. It’s alright.”
In the labs, Jane and Bruce were having a silent conversation with only their eyebrows - Darcy, chewing something in a corner, found it extremely funny.
“When I had the chance to be with someone I liked, I did it. And yeah, the end was…” Alex hesitated. “The end was painful. But it was worth it.”
!” he hissed, making Clint giggle. Then, because he couldn’t deny it, he bit his lips. “I- yeah, okay?
“If this is true,” Bruce said, a knowing look on his face, “then why are you not freaking out, Tony?”
“It’s not! It’s not bullshit, you’re right, we are no one, for you - for any of you. You saved our lives, bringing us here,” Alex took a shaky breath, “and we owe you. The least we can do is disappear, so that you won’t have to see us again.”
“Sorry,” he murmured, repeating himself louder. “It’s just… We’ve been alone for years. It’s strange to be… I don’t know, it’s just strange to have someone ready to take care of you. Especially you, guys.”
“Tony, you bastard!” swore again the voice. The man whom it belonged to arrived a second later and Tony tried to hide behind Thor, who just got into the room.
“And I can’t?” Peter worried. Maybe he had moved too fast, or he had misinterpreted something. Maybe she didn’t want him to feel that way.
They stood there for a few minutes more, waiting for Alex to calm down, and when he did they made him sit on the couch, a blanket on his shoulders and Bruce’s tea in his hands.
And there has to be a sensor or something, he thought, so that the suit appears when they command. Just a thought and they’d be covered in the armor - not really like his; it looked thinner and more flexible, almost like a second skin, but able to fly.
“And I know it’s okay,” he continued, causing Alex to turn not to meet his eyes. “I mean it,” Clint insisted. “It’s boring it’s so normal.”
Tony strengthened his grip on Alex and smiled softly at Steve, who however didn’t notice, too busy trying to understand where Rey was.
He then smiled tightly and left the room; Steve, surprised, found himself moving before even realizing it.
Bucky grinned when Alex blushed so much he became as red as Tony’s suit, while Clint was using ASL to talk to Natasha without speaking.
Rey nodded at her brother’s words and Peter looked first at one and then the other, before giving up the pretense of being okay and lowering his head. “It does,” he murmured. He was expecting an “I’m sorry”, but it never came.
Someone laughed, many smirked. The same woman of before looked at him, pensive. “Their hero-names are
“Pietro,” he breathed and immediately wanted to cry, to scream, to kiss him and punch him at the same time.
In the meantime, Natasha, Darcy and even Pepper, who now knew the entire story of the universe-experiment, had taken Rey for a girls-only day, Tony’s credit card in the hands and basically every boutique’s director ready to help them - and their money - in every way.
“Yeah, we do,” Tony replied, refusing to stop looking at Rey and, above all, at Alex. “Com’on. Let’s go back to the Tower. You still owe us your story,” he winked.
“H-how di-did- how did- how did you-” Alex asked, eating his words every time his eyes met Pietro’s.
“I create it,” he murmured. “Not HYDRA. I mean, at least in this world - I created Ultron. It’s my fault.”
“Iron Man, Thor, Legend and Hush are the first to get on the scene!” the woman yelled into the microphone, trying to look untouched by the fight behind her back: six supervillains had escaped a SHIELD facility and were creating havoc in New York.
Even though he had taken Rey with him, almost forcing her to jump, she did it with the same nonchalance of her brother.
The yell got lost in the ear-wrecking sound in which the all Tower was immersed. It had been that noise to alert the Avengers, who had ran into Tony’s lab with the weapons in the hands, ready to fight. Between various types of machinery there were Jane, Bruce and Tony himself, and it looked like they were shouting at each other; however, the noise was so loud that neither Steve nor Bucky, both with the enchanted hearing, could listen to them.
Alex looked at him and said nothing, but Pietro, beautifully amazing Pietro, understood anyway. “We were a thing.”
So, instead of saying anything. He carefully wrapped his own arms around the super soldier, melting in his warmth. He closed his eyes and indulged.
Out of everyone Tony had ever met, Steve was the last person he thought would betray him. He’s Captain Fucking America for Christ’s sake. But alas, he’s wrong. Yet again. He trusted the wrong person, yet again.
“This ends here, Zemo! We won’t let you hurt anyone else!” The Captain snarled at him angrily. The height of his emotion was high, enough to bother his team. He’s emotionally compromised, they all thought. He wasn’t thinking clearly. Without their clear headed leader, they were in big trouble.
"Captain, 70 years ago, you laid down your life to save how many millions of people. Tell me, why is this any different?" Steve sighed. It was clear that he doesn't have a real counter answer for what Vision had said. While they were talking, something popped up on Tony's mind.
"Only you have the power to pay it. Thanos threatens half the Universe. One life cannot stand in the way of defeating him." Fuck. Tony firmly shut his eyes. He wanted so much to take back what he said. No. They couldn't do it. Not with Vision as the price.
They told the team on Monday. They had celebratory dinner wherein everyone got blackout drunk which they horribly regretted the next morning because they were called to assemble because Doom bots were running amok in the streets of Manhattan. The majority had killer hangovers that led to very public epic fail videos that littered around youtube and Twitter by the end of the fight. Fails consisted of Falcon almost hitting a flock of birds, War Machine almost dropping from the sky before catching himself at the last minute and Hawkeye falling off a building.
“Boss? Should I call Captain Rogers down?” FRIDAY's uncertain voice came on.  Tony adamantly shook his head.
more. The moment they initiated the attack, everything went downhill fast. They did catch HYDRA off guard during the start. They were at advantage during the first 10 minutes since they started the attack. The tables were unfortunately turned when few of the agents managed to stray from the main fight. They were apparently looking for the Avenger Jet in which they were successful in. The fight halted for a few seconds when the ground shook from a small explosion.
“Have you been waiting for little, old me? Can’t say I’m not flattered for having the attention of such a beautiful lady but as you know, I’m already taken.” Tony glided past the redhead but stopped when slender fingers circled on his bicep on a firm, strong grip. The mechanic looked back and almost wanted to flinch at the cool and sharp glint on her steely eyes. The assassin hadn’t looked at him with that much hostility since she was his assistant.
“Yes. They’re all asking for answers.” The monarch said. Hearing this, Tony’s hand started to feel damp. He was feeling incredibly anxious and nervous the moment he realized that they’re going to Wakanda. Reading Bruce’s message alone made him uneasy and on edge. He didn’t say anything about the incoming threat aside from the words ‘He’s coming’. The fact that he wanted him to assemble the team was immensely worrisome. Whoever’s coming, he’s someone powerful.
"I'm fucking sick of you moping around and badmouthing Tony for everything wrong that goes your way. He's not the reason why you're a criminal and a fugitive, Clint. That parts my fault. Tony didn't create the Accords. He didn't implement it. He just supported it and followed orders. Stop using him as an excuse for your own faults. He's not responsible for your own choices. Fucking grow up." And with that, the blond walked off towards the other end of the room, Bucky following close behind.
“Well, that’s what you get for being a goddamn workaholic. Seriously though, we barely see you anymore around here because you’re always working. That must be painful for Steve because you just barely have time for him too. I mean, being an Avenger, the face of SI, and head of R & D, you surely have no time for yourself, much less for your boyfriend.” Sam’s words felt like knives slicing his heart and gut. It hurts to think that even his teammate would assume that he won’t make time for his lover. He expected it from the media but not his friends. He felt like his stomach dropped.
“According to Red Wing’s sensors, there are about 60 heat signatures inside and within the base’s vicinity.”
“Couldn’t you have opened a portal somewhere nearer? Like, you know, at the ACTUAL city?” Complained the billionaire.
“You said your wings aren’t functioning smoothly. That there’s some delay on the right wing that hampers with your flying. That’s probably why you weren’t able to fly as fluidly as you always do.” Steve reasoned. The veteran had brought up the technical problem to him two weeks ago. They were planning on having it fixed a few days ago but the sudden mission delayed that. It was urgent.
It has been more than 2 years since their return to the US. They were immediately thrown to the field and became active Avengers upon their arrival. There had been an obvious strain between the Rogues and Rhodes but through time, it lessened until it became non-existent. Bucky Barnes was also pardoned for his crimes as the Winter Soldier due to Mind Control issues. Though, he was given 100 hours of community service and was subjected to psych evaluation which he passed after almost a year consistent session with his psychologist. His mind was also now 100% his own as the trigger words were removed with the help of Shuri and her Wakandan doctors and scientists. He only became an official Avenger 9 months ago after being cleared for fieldwork.
The exact same thing had happened in Lisbon. They left empty handed and now was heading to their last destination, which is somewhere in Umbria, Italy. During the flight, they started discussing other plans. They can’t exactly do what they did in Catalonia and Lisbon. Those were in unpopulated areas. Meanwhile, the Umbria base is near a small village which is inhabited by at least 150 people. They couldn’t risk it. They have to take the fight away from them no matter what. The team were pretty much hoping that it would end up the same as the previous two bases.
“We have no time for this, Rogers. Like literally. Just stop and think of what you’re really going to say. Don’t stand there and spit out words and hope they’ll come together on their own. Get to the point and complete your sentences like a grown ass adult, for Christ’s sake!” The super soldier flinched at the harshness of his voice but Tony didn’t want to stop and care for a second. Sue him but he’s damn proud that he got to snap at him. That he didn’t stutter or high tailed. It was pitiful and petty of him to think so but Tony couldn’t find it in himself to care. He wanted this conversation over and done with.
!’ When almost two minutes had passed of awkward silence, someone finally broke and started asking questions. It was as if a spell had been broken and all hell had broken lose.
jokes, right? They wouldn’t really hurt Tony if he looked at Steve wrong? Maybe that’s the thing. He has a track record of trusting the wrong people which makes him extremely wary and paranoid at this point. That’s why he’s reacting much worse than he should.
“The hard way then.” Iron Man said in the same monotone voice. Without any more warning, the little shaft on his shoulders lifted as small missiles were launched, all in a coordinated and organizer fashion. About 20 agents, including the ones holding some of the Avengers down, were immediately incapacitated as they went down instantly. A few more were knocked out by the missiles from the ones on his arm. This apparently woke everyone from their shock as everything went into motion once again. This time, the Avengers, with Iron Man’s help, were at clear advantage.
“The Titans Kronos and Hyperion were defeated during the Second Titan War about 18 years ago. Gaea, the Goddess of the Earth, was bested just a year later during the Second Giant War. I can give you a few more names of immortals and how they were defeated but that’ll eat up too much of our time.” A flicker in both Thor’s and Loki’s eyes done it. His secret was now out in the open. And Tony can’t find it in himself to care. Fuck Zeus and his merry group of immortals who would rather sit on their throne than help protect the universe.
“Princess.” The billionaire gave her a nod and a large smile which she returned. He did always liked her. After the media dubbed Civil War, Tony had stayed in touch with T’Challa for both Avenger and Accords business. During one of their meetings, the princess had interrupted them just to introduce herself to Tony. Turns out, she always been an admirer of all the technological advancement he had done over the years. That first meeting lead to couple of others. They got along like a house on fire. It came to the point that T’Challa needed to bring her sister every time he had business in the US just so they could meet and play in the lab. Those ‘playdates’ always included Peter who got along even better with Shuri, with all the memes and Gen Z inside jokes they have.
“This is important, Avengers. Possibly a HYDRA level threat. They are to be stopped immediately. Is that clear?” The leader of Germany said, his voice strict and held no room for argument. The team nodded in understanding.
“It’s true, Tony. I know it can be hard to believe but I really am in love you. For years now. I’ve never been in love with anyone as much as I am in love with you. Just that.. You’re it.. You’re it for me.”
“Clint.” Their captain’s tone held authority and finality. It was a warning. The archer didn’t take lightly to that. He rolled his eyes.
At this point, Steve finally snapped out of his quest for blood and reassessed the situation. Unfortunately, it was too late. For the first time since they took on their roles as Avengers, they were being backed to a corner and
Not long after, Tony was done. The engineer gave his bicep a squeeze before walking off towards the jeep. The two confused super soldier looked at each other, shrugged before continued on following Tony.
They just wanted to make sure he wouldn’t hurt Steve. That he wasn’t destroying something good because go figures! The only thing Tony Stark is good at is destroying.
” The super soldier’s name was out of his lips before he knows it. It was an unconscious slip. He wanted to set up a wall between them by calling him by his surname. It was cold and strictly professional. That was something he promised himself. But the somewhat hopeful look on the super soldier’s face almost made up for that mistake.
"He could destroy life in a scale hitherto undreamt of." Dr. Strange cut him off, interjecting himself on the conversation. It surprised him. He almost forgot that it wasn't just him and Bruce in the room. That everyone was here.
It began when Bucky came knocking on his workshop. The genius actually jumped (though he would deny that till his last breath) when the former brainwashed soldier pounded on the door. Once allowed access, the soldier didn’t waste time as he stalked towards the billionaire, vehemently laying his metal arm on the table in front of him. Tony backed up and winced at the loud clanking noise made by the collision of metal against metal.
“Of course. It’s a matter of global security, after all. Do you guys have more information about the threat? We only received little to no information aside from
"It's feasible. Actually, we can just reprogram the synapses to work collectively. But we're talking about more than two trillion neurons here. One misalignment could cause a cascade of circuit failures. It will take time but the procedure is relatively safe. What do you think, Brother?" The Princess asked, turning towards her brother who gave her a nod.
Various levels of reaction was painted on the faces of the Avengers. The last being the great Captain whose voice cracked as it filled with emotions.
“Rogers.” Was his curt reply. He’s afraid that if he said more than that, he’ll give away much more than he wants to. Not with Steve looking at him like that. Not with Steve looking at him like he cares for him. Like he wants him. Like he’s longing for him. Because that’s preposterous. Absolutely ridiculous because Steve was a lot of things. In love with him wasn’t one of them.
“My arm is acting up. Fix it.” The super soldier grumbled, his voice rough and guttural. Tony raised an eyebrow at him but did as he was told. He gingerly opened the latch on the arm and immediately went to work as he dove deep on its circuits.
“Yes, Clint. We’re very happy. Thank you.” The blond super soldier chuckled amusedly while the genius in his arms could only snort. Around the three are the rest of their team whose majority are still in shock and trying to process the news they were told.
The Wakandan Jet landed a couple of feet from them. The aircraft’s door slid open as the Princess of Wakanda waltzed down and stopped midway. The royal gave them a mischievous smirk as she beckoned them to enter the aircraft. The group followed without questions.
“Shut up. I didn’t say anything back, idiot. I’m just acknowledging that we have so much to talk about. That’s it. Don’t get your hopes up, soldier.” Instead of feeling discouraged like Tony expected, Steve let out a snort before tightening his arms around him even more.
“Is that what you and your lackeys doing here? Preparing for your grand comeback?” The archer sarcastically asked.
“Oh! Why didn’t you say so, birdbrain? You could have told me 5 minutes ago and not let me suffer by enduring your presence for that long! Dum-E! Get Clint’s arrows. Yes, that-No!! Not that you big sack of bolts! From the other box! Yes! Finally! Thank you!” The genius exclaimed with an exasperated sigh. He handed the stack of arrows to the archer who accepted it with a big grin. Almost like a kid on Christmas Day.
“I know that a lot of my actions as of late can tell you differently but I promise. I’ll explain everything to you once we’re done with this threat. We’ll sit down and talk. I’ll tell you everything you need to know.” The engineer spluttered, obviously against the idea of tabling the topic.
“I guess everyone except me, Spider-man and Black Panther.” The Colonel said with a shrug. Both veterans looked at him in surprise. It wasn’t uncommon for Rhodes to have prior commitments aside from being an Avenger because he was still an SI and Military liason. Though, it was a bit unusual for him to opt out from an important mission like this.
Tony shouldn’t have tried to provoke her but he was just tired. Goddamn tired of all the threats to his person. He already had to initiate the blackout protocol twice in a week. His insomnia came back full force, his panic attacks grew worse, and he hadn’t seen his boyfriend for days. Not for a lack of trying on Steve’s part. The blond tried to coax him out of the workshop but Tony couldn’t because he’s afraid he’ll have a panic attack in front of him. That or he’ll break down. He’s barely holding on. The sight of Steve (lovely, warm, and handsome Steve) would break the dams. All the walls he desperately put up the past weeks would crumble down and he’ll surely break down in his lover’s arms. And Tony couldn’t do that. Not to Steve. The super-soldier would be swelled with guilt. These are his people who are breaking his lover. Steve wouldn’t take that lightly and Tony didn’t want him to need to choose between him and his friends.
And it’s not just his value they were missing. Each day, they realize that they were actually missing the genius. Steve more so than the others. He finds himself staring at the billionaire’s usual spot at the dining table, which no one had bothered removing nor occupying. The super soldier finds himself thinking back to the times he and Tony shared. They would often bond over movies or food. He miss Tony. Incredibly so.
Tony wanted some sort of comfort so he called his trusted Science Bro who went back to India for a few weeks to do some medical and research work. Because Bruce won't be like the others, right?
"We swore an oath to protect the Time Stone. With our lives." Wong added. Many wanted to protest but seeing the seriousness on their faces and the finality on their voices, they decided against it.
So far, Tony received three Shovel Talks. In other circumstances, he would laugh. Pre-Afghanistan Tony would have been rolling on the floor, laughing at the sheer absurdity of it because seriously? Shovel talks? He always thought they only exist in movies. That no one does it anymore. Why wouldn’t he? No one ever gave him one before. No one gave one on his behalf, either. Younger Tony would have accepted it all good-naturedly and move on.
Suddenly, everyone was working more flawlessly with each other. An almost telepathic bond seeped through them as they moved together, anticipating and predicting their teammates’ actions and reacting accordingly without delay and problem. The last time the Avengers moved as aptly and precisely as this is during the Battle of New York. The one they were doing now was as graceful as a warriors’ dance.
"Yeah.. okay.. so. Um. Tony? You were saying?" Bruce asked, faking a cough and clearing his throat. Everyone turned towards the billionaire who didn’t seem to have heard him. He was busy staring at Steve, this inquiring and scrutinizing look on his face. The super soldier was turned towards his best friend as they talked in hushed voices, no doubt about Steve’s actions. They failed to notice the heated stare of the genius.
“I’m not sure what you guys are expecting. More than half of the team are hailed fugitives under the Accords, Colonel Rhodes is just starting Physical Therapy, Vision is still learning, and I’m-”  The billionaire choked on his last word. He coughed harshly a few times. He held on the edge of the podium and needed a few seconds to regain composure.
“Peter!” Both teenagers hugged and surely would have dove deep in their little Gen Z world if Tony hadn’t interrupted them.
This was the first sighting of Iron Man in years. And like always, he commanded everyone’s attention. Just standing there, glistening under the glare of the sun was enough for anyone to stare. A deep silence enveloped the place as they all were seemingly frozen in place, openly gawking at the newly arrived guest. All eyes settled on the technological marvel as the almost emotionless laminating orbs of the armor surveyed the clearing as though analyzing the place.
As expected, Natasha didn’t take his sarcasm well. She gave him a stone-cold glare as her grip on his bicep tightened to the point that it hurt.
“Geez. Sorry for being worried, asshole.” Clint grinned mischievously at the sarcastic tone his teammate had used. Seeing the smugness on the archer’s eyes made Sam glare as he threw a towel at him. The sharpshooter laughed as he caught the cloth easily.
“You were involved with Stark?” The other man out of time asked, surprise coloring his expression. Not out of disgust, but out of genuine curiosity.
Natasha had tried to find out what they came for but found nothing of actual use or anything that can serve as a clue. The computer contained outdated documents and experiments, most they already know about and some were included in the leak from the SHIELD/HYDRA incident years ago. Knowing that they hit a dead end, they had regrouped and left.
“Kitty Kat.” The genius snarked back with no real heat, his lips in a familiar mischievous smirk. The royal shook his head at his playful antics, his lips transforming to an even more genuine smile. The King didn’t bite his attempt of banter. He proceeded on greeting the other people he was with before he led them inside the palace.
knows where he is. That man is truly a useful asset, as both Iron Man and Tony Stark. A pity on your part. The people who would pick him up, though, they might as well have won the lottery, don’t you think?” Steve saw red. He launched himself at the Sokovian who was immediately protected by surrounding HYDRA Agents.
just say you’re here as Antonio’s guest.” The three left behind didn’t even had the time to question Tony as he already sped off.
“You have no injuries aside from a few bruises, cracked ribs and bullet grazes. They can patch you up at the hospital. Your arm though is a different story. There’s a problem with the inner circuits that connects the arm to your nerves. It’ll take a more hands on tinkering to fix it. I can fix it after they look at you at the hospital if you want. Other than that, you’re fine.” Tony then moved on to Steve who was now frozen stiff. This was the closest he is to the genius in years. The super soldier wanted nothing more than to pull the smaller man in his arms and never let go. As much as he want that, he knew it’ll be far from welcome. What with the way that Tony was more on guard with him than he was with the others. It tells him that despite the arm’s length distance, there is still a wall separating them both.
drunk. There go his 2 years of sobriety. And to be honest, that was the least surprising of all. Tony Stark was an alcoholic. He tried but that will remain unchanged. He was a fool to think he could escape alcohol.
“Boss is not in the armor is what I mean, Captain. There is no point talking since you will not be heard.”
” Rhodey asked him as he gave him a serious and stern look that made Tony reconsider his choice. No. He wasn’t ready to face him. Not yet. But then again, he’ll never actually be ready. It’s better to talk to him now and find a middle ground before the threat comes.
tired. Just not only in the physical sense but in every other aspect that matters. His cheeks are sunken. He lost a significant amount of weight. He is favoring his right side which indicates yet to heal injuries. He also lacks the vibrancy and spontaneity that he usually carries whenever in public. Those signs are enough to trigger the warning bells on his friends’ and acquaintances’ heads.
“We can go all day talking about what I don’t deserve but really.. What do I deserve?” Tony expected Steve to pause and falter. Like he was doing earlier. What he didn’t expect was the straightforward and unhesitant answer that he got.
“Hey, man. Glad to see you alive. Haven’t seen you in days.”  The veteran greeted him with a wave as he lifted his gaze from the reality show he was watching. The genius inwardly winced at the reminder. He spent most of those two days on his lab’s floor, trying desperately to calm himself and chase away the panic attacks and flashbacks. Barnes threatening to remove his arc reactor sparked the deep trauma he earned from Obie those years ago, which he shoved far down in his subconscious. That simple sentence reopened all those wounds leaving him to scramble irretrievably to put the lid back on it. The episodes he had those two days were much more than he had the past three years.
“Shit! I can’t follow them, Cap. I’ll be riddled in holes by the time I catch up to them.” The others let out their own curses at what Sam said.
“Boss, an unidentified spacecraft had entered and breached Earth’s atmosphere not five minutes ago.” The genius’ head snapped upwards as his AI’s word registered to him. He cursed loudly as he scrambled to the nearest hologram table and started typing madly.
“As for the future of the Avengers, which I’m sure you are all been dying to hear.. I’m afraid that as of this moment, the Avengers are no more.” That created another riot from the crowd. Flashes and shouts erupted around the place as the bodyguards and security struggled to keep the peace. It took about another ten minutes before the noise died down.
He didn’t need to voice this out. Tony gave his best friend’s left arm a reassuring squeeze before throwing him a shaky but determined smile. He knew that what he wanted to say was received and conveyed fully by that simple gesture. Rhodey was hesitant to leave him alone with
To say that he looked stupid openly gaping at Tony while said genius bandaged up his arms was an understatement. At least if the raised eyebrows and smirks he received from his team was any indication.
“Bold of you to assume that I need your permission to murder you.” Was Natasha’s answering remark which pulled a laugh from everyone. Tony, albeit feeling a bit uneasy, laughed alongside them.
“I can’t b-be Iron Man anymore. I can’t say the exact reason for coming up with that decision as they are personal and private. But I can’t be Iron Man.” The crowd was more somber for this revelation. They were whispering amongst themselves but no shouting or violence occurred. Not like the other two announcements.
“You’re really together? Well, damn. Couldn’t say I saw that one coming. But if you’re happy with each other, that’s cool, I guess?” The archer commented, raising an eyebrow at his two leaders who were not subtly leaning against one another, the taller one placing an arm around the smaller man’s waist.
“Hey. Thank you for agreeing to meet us.” Rhodey answered after a moment of awkward silence. Tony would have kissed him right there and then. Being the official negotiator and representative of the New Avengers, the others most probably have been waiting for him to speak first. Tony couldn’t handle that. The hand on his lower back (Rhodey’s) was helping him calm down a bit. It anchored him.
“Yes, Mr. Iron Stark-Mr. Tony. Uhh, I mean Mr. Stark.” He was obviously full of nerves being in front of the genius. He always did secretly idolized him, one engineer to another. His connection to Hank Pym kind of spoiled that at first but he still held high respect for the Iron clad hero and his many achievements. The 3 years of his disappearance, his name was whispered within the compound’s wall, somewhat like a legend. The few times he and Rhodes talked about the mechanic, he was regaled by numerous stories of his marvelous experiments and creations that made Scott’s mouth water from delight and awe.
Unfortunately, the jet still managed to escape. Just as it flew out of sight, a hot red Jeep Wrangler Rubicon X pulled over the clearing. Before anyone can say anything, Tony Stark himself emerged from the driver seat, the expandable Iron Man Gauntlet on his right hand slowly retracted back to a wrist watch. He ran a hand through his hair and sighed.
“FRIDAY, I want you to message the panel. Inform them of what’s happening but make it vague until we have more information. Then contact Kitty Kat. Tell him to prepare because he has visitors incoming and to not engage because they’re friendly. Lastly, inform Strange. Tell him to come here immediately. We’re going to Wakanda.” Satisfied that he got everything covered, he made his way towards the door of the lab. Though, he did glance back at the screen where the message was displayed before he left the workshop.
He couldn’t stay much longer in his lab without people asking questions. There’s also that protocol that would alert Pepper if he stayed on blackout for more than 76 hours without resurfacing. If it reaches Pepper, it will surely reach Steve and he can’t let that happen. Tony doesn’t have the heart to tell his boyfriend that it was his best friend that caused his setback.
“What the hell?” muttered by a dumbfounded Clint Barton. Around him were the rest of the Rogue Avengers, all in similar state of shock as the archer.
Nothing much changed in regards with the genius’ appearance. At least in terms of clothing. He still wore his beloved band shirts and sweatpants. His skin developed a more golden tan and glow. The most notable and surprising change of all is his lack of facial hair. He shaved off his goatee. He looks younger, way younger than he actually is. That’s probably the first time they all saw him clean shaven. So, excuse them for staring.
“We can’t let anyone escape! They might harm the villagers!” Was Captain America’s order as he continued on punching and tackling his way through the bodies of HYDRA Agents.
“Oh, shit. Jesus Christ. Is that really..? I can’t believe it. Shit.” Tony barreled on with curses and swears as he continued on typing frantically, his hands visibly shaking.
The reason why he couldn’t tell Tony the truth was because he was a coward. They had such a strong friendship at that point that he was afraid that it would be ruined. Above all, he didn’t want to hurt Tony by reopening old wounds. He wanted to save him from that pain. In the end, he still did hurt Tony.
"Woah! Hold up! What the hell is happening here, Stark?! We have no time for your bullshit and games! The universe is in danger and yet you still can't control yourself, huh?! You still want to be the center of everyone's attention like the god damn attention whore and egomaniac you—" Clint would have barreled along if it wasn't for Steve who straight up punched the archer. Shocked and confused, Clint didn't have enough time to process what happened as he was sent crashing towards the nearest wall. The archer looked up at the absolutely pissed off super soldier who was glaring at him like he was Red Skull came back to life. Sensing the tension, Bucky and Sam immediately ran towards the pair, the former went to Cap to hold him back and the latter towards the ex-shield agent to check for major injuries. Clint was too shocked to stop or react to Sam's inquiring hands.
Chapters 73-96, were written for the Steve Tony Games, and I was on Team Angst. Some of these have happy endings, some do not. They're mostly darker than what I normally write. I will put tags in the notes here on each one, but do be aware that angst was the primary motivation for these (and points :P) so they taste a little different from what I usually put up.
"You're okay." Tony reached for Steve, but he snapped his hand out of reach and stumbled up to his feet on his own.
They laughed cruelly, and Tony let himself slide back into Steve’s arms, into false memories and fake love and illusory touches.
"Yup." Tony took his mark, and Bucky settled in beside him. They were tucked behind two crates, guns in hand, while the bad guys shot at them. Most angles would be quick flashes of arms and hands and the tops of their heads. Tony gave Bucky a look while he waited for the go order. "Good morning."
“No begging,” Steve reminded him firmly, as Tony tossed him a shrimp. Steve glared over his shoulder.
“So I guess if we’re going to work together, we should get to know each other, huh?” Tony said with a wink.
Steve shifted the sign in his hands, stomping his feet a little to get blood flowing into them. He'd had more people take him up on his offer yesterday when it was warmer. Now, everyone was hunkered down into their jackets, motoring along, trying to get to class as dry and warm as possible.
This was why he and Bucky used to go to the Stark Expo. This was what saving the future was all about. Utterly incredible.
Steve worked and failed to suppress a smile. “I guess it’s the other thing. What do you call it? Friends who…”
Tony shook his head, but he was smiling too. He stretched out his hands then closed his eyes and set his fingers on the keys again. The music flowed once more, quickly filling the room until it was all Steve inhaled with every breath.
Steve relaxed as he felt the joints of the armour lock to Tony’s control. He blasted through the landing bay and came to a stop in the workshop, landing lightly on his feet. Tony walked over, grinning from ear-to-ear. He pushed a button and the armour sprung open.
“I want a divorce!” Tony proclaimed followed by a rustle of fabric that sounded an awful lot like him being gathered up in super soldier arms.
“I can’t believe this place is really ours,” Tony whispered against Steve’s neck. There were crickets chirping in the distance, and Steve realized there would be all sorts of new sounds to get used to here.
“Mike. Mike Lampton.” The boy shook his hand then wiped his palm on his pants nervously. “It’s awesome to meet you, Captain. Uh, Sir.”
“Not really.” Steve shook his head. “It didn’t feel real, because I remembered every time the day looped and no one else did. It was like you were a dream. Dream Tony. Not real - just in my head. It didn’t matter what I said or did.”
A loud buzzing shocked Tony out of sleep and he blinked around in the dark for a moment before he realized it was his phone ringing. There were only three numbers programmed to override his do not disturb.
“I know.” Bucky shifted his weight from foot to foot. “Guess we’ll have to find something else to do.” Bucky turned suddenly and pinned Steve against the counter. He cupped Steve’s jaw and drew him into a kiss, pulling him into his arms then driving him back onto the couch when he parted his lips and moaned softly. Bucky’s mouth occupied Steve while the cake cooked, wandering hands making Steve almost forget about it until the timer went off. Steve pulled open the oven and they inspected the cake.
Tony’s eyes popped wide, and his mouth fell open. Steve followed his line of sight. About fifteen feet away, a young man - maybe 17 or 18 - was walking across the park, earphones in, glued to his phone, with a leash looped over his arm. His free hand was stuffed in the pocket of his jacket, and he nodded his head along with his music while he walked. He had the floppy, unkempt hair teens seemed to wear these days, and his pants were distressingly baggy. And he was slouching.
Steve tried to smile. “Amazing.” He twisted his wand between his fingers. “You’ll catch the prince’s attention, no doubt.”
"Because it matters to me that you get along," Tony hissed out. "Because I want both of you in my life. Because I have
THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF MY TEAM ANGST RUN. Chapters 73-96, were written for the Steve Tony Games, and I was on Team Angst. Some of these have happy endings, some do not. They're mostly darker than what I normally write. I will put tags in the notes here on each one, but do be aware that angst was the primary motivation for these (and points :P) so they taste a little different from what I usually put up.
Bucky hooked a finger in the waistband of his underwear, back to them, and inched it down to the beat of the song. The curve of his ass started to peek out.
“Oh, Tony.” Steve brushed his hair back from his face, the leather of his gloves brushing against Tony’s skin.
“So sorry.” Tony let go. He changed tactics, digging a tennis ball out of his beach bag. He threw it as hard as he could towards the ocean, and Hurricane galloped off after it. “Fuck, I’m so sorry. Are you okay? I wasn’t paying attention and he likes to punish me by being really embarrassing when I forget to throw the ball again.”
Tony turned the box this way and that, dug through the paper, and ruffled through the bow’s elaborate curls, but there was no note, no card. Who was the fancy watch from?
He kept his hands empty while he watched Tony and Jan navigate the rest of their meeting. Steve knew their relationship had to look convincing in order to pull this mission off, but he still had to bite back a growl every time Tony pressed a kiss to Jan’s forehead or Jan rubbed her palm over Tony’s chest. Clint, smartly, didn’t mention it again.
The dance was hopping already. There were tables surrounding a huge dance floor and a live band. The dance floor was already full, couples and groups bouncing and swaying to the music. Their group claimed a table, and Clint dragged Bucky off to dance with a smirk.
“Yup. And first fight as husbands.” Steve grinned up at Tony and earned a kiss on the tip of his nose. “First orgasms…” he teased. “First broken pie plate.”
We also wanted to thank all of our amazing Trouble readers! Trouble hit 1700 kudos today :D We're so grateful for your love for this verse. We can't tell you how pleased we are!! <3
Tony tried to find a hint of real blush on Bucky's cheeks, but he couldn't tell if it was there under the caked-on foundation. They'd been flirting off set almost as long as they'd been lovers on set, and this movie was a long filming schedule. A lot of it was special effects, which Tony was rarely involved in, besides pestering Anya about how the explosives were made, but his scenes all involved either pretending to shoot someone or making out with Bucky.
Tony shoved his hands in his pockets and huddled his shoulders up against the wind. It didn’t matter that hot tears were sliding over his cheeks; he was all wet and wind-flushed anyway - no one would notice. No one would care. No one was even out here.
They got ready for bed, putting on a movie before curling up together in Steve’s sea of pillows and blankets. Tony floundered for a bit, trying to get comfortable in the mess, but Steve pulled him close, head nestled against his chest, and he was finally able to drop off, fingers crossed that he wouldn’t start talking in a few hours.
Tony turned bright, shaky eyes on Steve. “Sophie went into labour two weeks early. She’s on her way to the hospital.”
“There’s one condition.” Tony was smiling too now, unable to hold back a giddy grin to match Steve’s.
“I know, but this’ll only take a minute,” Steve pleaded. “FRIDAY says it’s going to be cloudy soon.”
Steve dug the tiny plastic shovel into the sand and frowned when the handle bent under the weight. It was a bit damp out still, probably too damp to be playing with Tony’s gardening tools, but after three days of summer storms, Steve had seized the first moment where it wasn’t actively raining to get Tony outside.
Steve twisted around to watch Tony as they were parted, only to soon meet again, in combat. “I don’t either,” Steve said, “but it’s fight or die.” His jaw clenched. “I’ll see you on the other side.”
“Thank you.” Tony unfolds the things, and Steve politely turns away while he gets dressed. With his back to Tony, Tony can see a flaming red stripe of flushed skin at the nape of Steve’s neck, disappearing down into his collar. Tony smiles to himself as he shoves his legs in unfamiliar khakis. Steve still blushes the same, one Captain America serum and seventy-five years later. You just have to know where to look.
Finally, after what felt like a lifetime, the two Ultimates left the frame of the cameras and headed back towards the van, hidden around the corner.
“What’s this from?” Steve reached out and stroked his thumb over Tony’s rib where a stark white line broke the smooth olive skin. Steve had never noticed it before.
Tony squeezed again, then moved to pull away. “Okay, that’s fine. But if you want to talk, I’m here.”
And yet, back in his own room was no better. Steve piled on all his blankets and before long he was warm again, but he couldn’t sleep. All he could think about was how Tony’s face had fallen when he left.
Steve beamed. “Clint showed me this video about rooftop beekeeping and it looked so amazing. You told me I could put whatever I wanted on that credit card, so I ordered some stuff, got the bees all set up and grew them some food.” He gestured towards the plants and shuffled a little on his heels. “You know… I wanted it to be a surprise, but now I feel like I really should have asked you if it was okay.”
“Right.” Tony’s eyes flickered over Steve’s face, alighting on his lips. “Cause… uh… if you need a ride….” he trailed off.
“But what if the aliens come to get her, Clint? What then?!” Tony shouts, gesturing towards the hole in the wall that still has half a broken spaceship stuck through it.
Steve burst into a beautiful grin, like a firework going off. "Alright. Guess we’ll just have to get back together then.”
Steve stomach dropped out. “Oh god, I’m so sorry. I shouldn’t have taken that from you for a stupid bet.”
Steve swallowed the knot down that had formed in his throat and stepped forward as the elevator doors slid open. He needed to start letting himself think that: Tony was his ex. They’d barely spoken since after their break-up. If he kept avoiding it, it would just hit him at the worst possible times.
Why couldn’t his new partner have been ugly, boring, and ancient? Instead he had to be witty, beautiful, and only a few years older than Steve.
Bucky frowned at his laptop, casting back. He'd started the Zoom meeting ten minutes before his lecture time. He liked to watch the students file in as if they were really in a classroom. Parker had been showing everyone his cat. "No. I really can't think of anything. You were here when it started."
nearly half an hour ago. Tony was the kind of person who, when he said "I'll pick you up in four hours," either picked you up at three hours and fifty-nine minutes or didn't show up until the next morning, a manic glint in his eye, and grease all over his cheeks.
They met in the doorway, Steve’s arms wrapping around Tony’s shoulders, Tony’s around Steve’s waist. They burrowed in each other and stayed there for a long moment. “I miss you too much to sleep apart.”
"It's my bottle cap," Steve said. It appeared in his hand, and Tony realized he'd put it in his pocket earlier. "I remember I lost one last week and couldn't figure out where it had fallen, and I didn't really worry about it. I should have made sure I found it. It never occurred to me that he could get hurt with it."
Tony grinned. "Well, how about that? You're still two hundred and twenty pounds of kickass but now you're in a five pound bag."
Tony’s lips were warm and soft against Steve’s, not practiced or fancy, but comfortable and confident. He leaned forward against Steve’s chest and tipped his chin up to angle the kiss deeper. Steve’s arms were full of Tony’s solid, warm weight, and he could taste the hint of cherry soda on Tony’s tongue when he parted his lips and let it dart inside.
Steve reached out and ran his fingers over the back of the armour’s metal finger. He could feel the ridge from each articulated plate, flexible yet melded so seamlessly together. Iron Man looked down at him in the dark of Tony’s empty workshop, expressionless.
“Not stop what?” Tony begged, almost shaking in his bonds. “Steve - Steve - not stop what - what are you - oh
Steve leaned down to help him with the cables. “He likes chocolate better than flowers,” Tony heard him say. “And he’s allergic to shrimp.”
Tony leaned over the fence to get a kiss. “As long as I get to help you wash this -” Tony brushed mulch from Steve’s arm “- all off, then it’s a deal.”
The blindfold meant Steve had no idea what was happening beyond what he could feel, but every now and then, Tony would twitch or whimper. Steve couldn’t help but imagine the tentacles exploring Tony further, curling between his legs, touching him. Guilt soured the appeal of the fantasy, but his body didn’t care. Steve whimpered out apologies as his cock shifted in Tony’s mouth, cutting off his air supply.
Tony swallowed heavily and worked his eyes open bit by bit until he found Steve’s soft, blue gaze blinking back at him. Though, there wasn’t much blue left with how blown-wide his pupils were. And it was
He could feel the weighty buzz of the drug, driving him to want to shift and rut, pressing into the too-light touches, but it was distant, ignorable. He assumed it would ramp up given time, but there was also no way it would affect him as strongly as it had Tony. He had to stay the level-headed one here.
“Yes,” Steve breathed, leaning so far forward on the table that it squeaked and the paper tore under him.
The rest of the evening was soft and sweet, and Tony did his best to push stressful thoughts of Bucky out of his mind. He ate spaghetti and drank wine and curled up in bed with Steve that night, cozy and comfortable in his arms. But with the light out and Steve's breathing soft and slow, Tony couldn't help but think about how nice it would be to have Bucky pressed up against him on the other side.
Tony’s whole body moved as he played, and Steve could feel Tony’s leg rubbing against his as he worked the pedal, his arm pressing into Steve’s side as his hand danced up to the higher octaves.
"We love you too." Tony stood up and leaned over to kiss Bucky's cheek. "I'm going to pop up to my study to answer some of these emails and stop my students from hyperventilating. I'm sure it'll be all over Tik Tok either way, but I'll put out whatever fires I can. You are going to finish showing Steve what I'm sure was a lovely time, and then start drafting your explanation for Thursday's class." Tony reached out and gave Steve's wrist a squeeze. "If he has a meltdown, put him to bed and come play chess with me."
They hung in tense silence for a moment, then Steve finally moved. He stood. “Alright, I’ll go. I’m going to hang around in the bar for a few hours, til it really hits, in case you change your mind. But I won’t come back up. You can text me. I’ll come. You don’t have to justify it, Tony. If you want me to, I’ll stay. I won’t hold it against you, I won’t take it to mean something that it doesn’t. I made a promise to you, three years ago, that I’d be there for you in this, and I’m going to keep it. I can’t lie and say it won’t mean anything to me, to get to hold you again, but as soon as you want me to, I’ll leave.”
A tiny compass appeared in the corner of the screen, and Steve pointed east, headed for the water. Once he was free of skyscrapers, Steve took a chance to look around and really take in his surroundings. The sky was clear and bright blue, though off in the distance, Steve could see the dark roll of a threatening storm. The water was rough today, dark and white-tipped, but, encased in the gold-titanium alloy, Steve couldn’t tell if it was windy or not. The armour seemed resistant to being pushed off-track, the repulsors firing alternately to keep him steady.
“Fuck, Tony,” Steve breathed, when his orgasm had abated enough to speak. “You’re the best thing I’ve ever fucked.”
Steve’s shield bounced down the street, taking down alien after alien before returning to his hand. Tony swooped around behind him. Landing at his back and spraying repulsor fire at the oncoming horde.
Tony opened his mouth then closed it again. He tugged his glasses off, but dropped his eyes to the ground between them. They were still toe to toe, and Steve had each of Tony's shoulders in his hands. "Um. No… No, I guess not. It's okay! I -" He looked back up at Steve and their eyes met. His lips wobbled, eyes going bright.
Set during Arc Three of "In Trouble Deep" - It's Tony's first day alone with Anthony since they moved in with Steve, and he's pretty sure he's got this.
"Tony…" Steve gave in to the urge to touch him, gripping both of Tony's shoulders and rubbing gently up and down. "I'm okay. I didn't come here to ask you for anything. I came here to ask what
He took the elevator again, this time to the shared floor beneath the apartments, where the home theatre, and the nerf guns, and the biggest kitchen lived. Here, finally, was bustling with activity. As soon as Tony stepped out, Thor and Clint threw themselves at him, pulling him into a hug. Thor patted him enthusiastically on the back when he pulled away, and Tony stumbled forwards.
“Yeah…” Steve sighed again, burrowing his face under Tony’s jaw. His breath was warm but his nose was cold. “Just a long couple of days.”
It was the kind of sorry you gave when you were all sold out of sesame bagels, or you bumped into someone at a crosswalk.
Steve nodded, turning back to Tony, and earning a smile. “I feel exactly the same as always,” he said, sighing softly. “Perfectly normal.”
Steve blocked Tony’s view of his hands with is own head, leaning in for a kiss. “I think all of you has aged beautifully,” Steve whispered against his lips.
It was nice to have a lazy Sunday at home, the team spread around the tower but still together. Nat knew Clint was on the roof, Bruce was in the gym, Thor was in his room, and Steve and Tony were behind her, bickering good naturedly over a chess set.
"Wait! What about Viz? If we destroy the Mind Stone then what would that entail for Viz?" The red head asked, her eyes frantic and wild in panic. Tony needed to look away because as much as Wanda hates him, he still do care about the teen. Seeing her in pain after realizing that she might have to lose someone she come love..
month after the Civil War, when a global threat made itself known on California. The X-Man and Fantastic Four were there but it was obvious that they were losing as they were gravely outnumbered. It wasn’t until the arrival of the Rogue Avengers that the threat was contained and eradicated. They not only help save the United States but the whole world as the guy behind the threat was planning on releasing a widespread virus that can kill millions at a time. They were granted immunity and full pardon in exchange of taking up the Avengers Mantle once again.
“Relax, Honey Bear. FRIDAY already called ahead. Told him about the Asgardians and not to engage. He knows we’re coming so cool your jets. And if he didn’t, what makes you think we’ll still be alive if they thought we’re intruders? They probably have traps set up to eliminate unwelcome guests.” That didn’t calm the Air Force soldier at all but he did refrain from commenting further. Only letting out a pained noise from the back of his throat.
"The rabbit is right. The stones cannot be destroyed that simply." Thor contributed, looking much more solemn than he was before. His grip on Storm breaker had tightened. It was still a bit weird for Tony to see the God of Thunder with a weapon other than his hammer
All hell broke loose. The Avengers were forced to defend themselves against the large group of agents. They were all human. Normally, the team wouldn’t have much trouble but they were all injured and disarrayed. Their usually tactical leader was out for blood. His moves was irrational and sloppy, so far from his common grace and finesse. That left the Avengers without a leader. No one to give them orders and tactics. They were flying in blind.
demigod to be exact.” Everyone was silent for a few seconds. They were all staring at Tony with varying degrees of disbelief. It was obvious that they were all trying to process what he said. Or perhaps waiting for him to say ‘
“The panel wants us to go to Europe to investigate further. It seemed big because they want every Avenger available to come.” The spy commented, a hand on her hip. Steve looked up at her at that in surprise.
“I just want to tell you that I’m in love with you.” That effectively shut the genius up. What? His mind couldn’t process what he just heard. How could he possibly? After everything?
“So, in other words, we’re flying blind? How are you sure that it was Banner who sent you that message? It could have been anybody.” The archer’s tone was full of bite and hostility that made everyone in the room wince. So much for a civil conversation.
“No. The doctor said he’ll be need a few physical therapy sessions but otherwise, he’ll make a full recovery.” Everyone let out a breath at that, Sam being the most relieved. If anything would have happened to Clint, the veteran would have taken it worse than everyone else. He’s blaming himself for the archer’s fall, not being fast enough to catch him. He heard Clint’s plea for aerial support over the com during the mission but he was distracted by a few Hydra agents that he missed him. If only he had been more aware of his surroundings and fast enough, the archer wouldn’t have been seriously injured. If he was somewhere higher than he was, it would have been a Rhodey incident all over again. Sam still haven’t forgiven himself for that. Even if Rhodey did, he can’t find himself to forgive and forget.
That created an even more tense and awkward atmosphere. Between a fuming super soldier and an injured archer, no one really knew what to do. It kind of helped that Clint was too shocked to say anything or else it would have resulted to an actual fight. Something that they don't need right now.
“You can’t just drop a bomb like that and expect me to just-” The nerve of the super soldier to just chuckle. Tony wanted to verbalize his complain more but he forced his mouth shut when Steve walked towards him, closing their distance and stopping in his personal space. Out of nowhere, a pair of strong arms wrapped around his waist and pulled him towards a hard and warm chest.
“There’s actually recent development. Something that our trusted source had given us only yesterday, which is why they’re not in the reports you are reading. They gave us a pattern and algorithm to use as a way to locate their bases. These enabled us to have specific coordinates. As of present, there are three suspected bases with high activity, all of which are located in Southern Europe. One in the northeastern region of Catalonia in Spain, another in Lisbon, and the last is in a quiet countryside in Italy, specifically in the region of Umbria. We want your team to go there, investigate and then infiltrate. The first two locations are mostly in mountains and non-populated areas but the last one is posing a bit of a problem. The location of the last base is near a small village which makes it really worrisome. There hasn’t been any reports from the people there which means that they have no knowledge of the base. I doubt they have any idea it exists. If it’s HYDRA, AIM or any large black organization, we want you to put a stop to it immediately. We want to put a lid on this before it has any chance of being a bigger problem. But please, do not harm or let any harm for that matter, to come to any civilians from the nearby village. Under any circumstances. Am I clear?” The Italian leader may be a soft hearted person but he can be a ruthless person, especially if it’s his people’s safety involve.
“Tones?” That snapped Tony back to attention. He blinked a few times before a somewhat horrified look wash over his face as he realized that most of everyone’s attention was now on him. It immediately morphed to a more guarded one as he cleared his throat. That made everyone completely shift their focus towards him.
“Okay. All done, Barnes. You can come to me anytime when it starts acting up again.” Before he can second guess himself, Tony hesitatingly reaches out to pat Bucky’s metal arm. The billionaire jerked in surprise when the soldier caught his hand in an iron grip. Tony let out a nervous laugh as he tried to pry his hand off because that metal arm can surely hold a tight grip. He failed to hide the wince as he felt shots of pain.
“Yep. I think something’s caught with wirings on the right wing. I couldn’t glide nor turn as quick and steadily as I used to. I delayed bringing it to the tech guys because of the mission and also because I knew it’ll take at least a week to get the problem fixed.” Sam looked even guiltier at having to admit that his wings wasn’t on top shape during the mission. It was his responsibility to make sure that his tech works perfectly before going to missions.
“The part where you’re taken and in a relationship. With Steve, specifically. I’m here to give you a little warning.” Oh, that’s why.
He feels like Piper and Pepper would be both proud and disappointed in him. Proud that he got to stand up for himself but disappointed that he chose to do so in a time like this and for the reason he has. Huh. Now that he realize it, those two does have a lot in common, Tony thought. Better not introduce them to each other, the genius mused. Those two along with Annabeth and Natasha can rule the world. In fact, any pair combination of those 4 would have been enough.
still holds a great impact in his life. That long had passed and he still had yet to move on from the betrayal he made Tony suffer through. Out of all the Avengers.
“Any permanent damage or injury?” Steve asked the question that was bugging most of them. Natasha’s lips twitched upward and formed a miniscule smile.
“Oh, no! Clint’s down! He was within range of the small bomb!” Scott yelled over the comm. That definitely affected the fluidity of the team. Clint was their marksman and eye. He was the one who pointed and called out positions and locations. He was supposed to look out for every member of the team. He sees where the enemies’ numbers are weakest and most fragile. Clint going down caused a strain in their teamwork. Even with Sam in the air, it will be hard for him to give positions as he is more effective as aerial support.
Everyone almost let out a breath of relief when they heard Shuri’s watch beep and blink. The Princess pressed a few buttons before bringing out a hologram to display the information and data she received.
“That’s actually what we’re worried about, Tony. You didn’t seduce Steve just so you could sleep with him, right? This isn’t just about sex for you, right? Because I swear, if you’re going to hurt-” The red-haired assassin’s voice dropped to a cold tone as she trailed off with her statement. Tony failed to suppress the shiver that climbed his spine at her threat which the super-soldier felt, being so close. Hoping to ease his lover, Steve squeezed the genius’s hips, offering his comfort. His message was received as the smaller man started to relax on his arms again.
“Seems like you folks are lost without me.” The genius said off handedly, opening his jeep and diving back inside. He resurfaced with a first aid kit in hand.
“Because they’re Earth’s last line of defense. Because they’re Earth’s Mightiest Heroes.” With that final statement, Tony Stark left the stage.
“Unfortunately, we don’t have all the answers. They would have to ask Banner and Thor once they’re here.” Rhodes told T’Challa who nodded half-heartedly. The King knew they don’t know much about the threat, Tony realized.
"No, Tones. You got it right this time so don't worry. Though, if you did spend too much time on your workshop enough to forget the date, you'll have to worry more about FRIDAY telling on you than me. She'll rat you out not only to Nana Rosa, but to the whole town as well." That made the billionaire groan in agreement. That particular incident happened a few times since Tony moved in. Enough times that FRIDAY have a protocol dedicated to it. Whenever he hits the 48-hour mark of nonstop work at the shop, the AI would send out an alert to certain people so they could pester the genius out to rest and eat. At first, it was only sent to Pepper and Rhodey but due to the distance, FRIDAY opted to send one to Nana Rosa, who lived a few minutes from Tony. Overtime, the people part of that list grew and grew. At present, it contains almost majority of the town.
Soon enough Toni is thrusting so hard that the bed shakes and when she lets out a frustrated growl, clenches her toes hard and squeezes Steve’s head between her thighs they look each other in the eyes and Toni sobs, “Oh
“Because it’s new, and soft and the way you treat me makes me feel like I should be cared about the way you care about me. I don’t have to- I’m never the person I was that first night when we’re together. I’m not pretending and I’m not even trying. I don’t have to work for you, you just are,” he exhales shakily. Tony’s hands are quivering when he reaches them out to cup Steve’s face.
Tony can’t stop thinking about all the different versions of his terrible dream. He’s standing there and staring into the eyes he’s loved for years, his breathing in the comfortable, intoxicating scent of Steve’s cologne, and he’s hoping and hoping that the odds are in his favor on this one. There’s certainly a reason why they’ve made it this far, and Tony’s counting on that reason prevailing.
getting liver ruiningly drunk, but Sam’s got to go to bed because he’s planning to drive to Hartford to see his sister and her newborn baby and won’t be back until Wednesday so Steve figures he’ll just live a few nights not internally berating himself with Sam’s advice.
“It’s good,” Steve comments. Tony nods. Maybe Steve was wrong about him being his type; maybe Tony’s different.
“Please don’t be rash about this,” Tony says over Facetime a little over a year later. He doesn’t Facetime anyone but Steve, who pretty much despises texting and will call to say things as simple as good morning. It’s both endearing and inconvenient.
“I just… asked,” Tony shrugs, “I thought you’d wanna take a day,” he tells Steve, moving to take the drinks from his hands and sit them on the counter and invade Steve’s personal space. Steve would never admit it but he feels slightly nervous then, like he should run away from how much he wants to just sink into Tony’s arms and have his space invaded for hours, preferably naked and stoned. Tony is so right; Steve would love to just take a day, after all it had been a long few weeks of doctor’s appointments and changing medications for Steve after a relatively scary bout of the flu. And his mother had been so worried, dropping by so often that he’d had to hide the weed and paraphernalia in his room and Bucky had even
,” Toni screams then, and neither of them stop for a second. Steve knows there are probably tears in her eyes, because every one of her breaths sounds like a chest wracking sob, but he fucks his fingers in and out of her furiously. Crooking his fingers, he rubs them up against the soft fleshy wall of her cunt, the perfect spot, the one that makes her pound her fists into the mattress in frustration. Her hips move quickly; she’s chasing another orgasm. Steve doesn’t let up, sticks his tongue out as she bucks back and forth over his mouth.
Eventually when her breathing evens out she says, “You can tell your driver not to circle the block for the 6
, let alone their bed in the penthouse. Tony’s music is as loud as ever, and he has his welding mask on, so he hasn’t noticed Steve’s arrival but that’s fine. Steve takes in the strong slope of his neck, watches those nimble fingers (which really should be protected by gloves or something) and he just
“It’s covered,” Steve says, but he shrugs out of his jacket anyway, and raises his arm so that Tony can see the faint, practically invisible, lines of his very first tattoo. It had been a little skull. Now, it is buried beneath the lines of traditionally styled big ass compass, which had been the beginning of the larger pieces dominating the left side of Steve’s body. Over the years he had accumulated a bunch of other pieces on his arm and shoulders, going down his back as well, and he had even discussed some of them with Tony, but he had never shared the story of his first tattoo.
Clint joins in harmoniously, “and talk!” and because this is Steve’s life, Bucky starts cackling like a madman. He really needs to move out of this place. Real friends wouldn’t laugh at their friends’ relationship related calamities or harmonize about them. Real friends would do something nice like take their sad friend out to drink at a club said sad friend’s relationship problem doesn’t own.
“Anyway: your pity party, not mine. I don’t mind being single. And I know when I eventually am in a relationship with an intelligent young woman I’ll have the emotional wherewithal to enjoy being in love with her instead of doing whatever it is you’re doing.”
fairy tale teeny bopper bullcrap. This means that Steve must take matters into his own hands and do his own research.
Tony raises an eyebrow now, taking a step closer to Steve and draping a wide palmed hand over his hip, “Oh really? Jose Cuervo?”
Tony’s pictured it for so long, but the actual event is nothing he could’ve cooked up. Despite years with Tony, and therefore years getting used to being in the public eye (Howard Stark’s prodigal son gets his fair share of press), Steve is an incredibly private person. He compiles a guest list with less than 50 people on it, much to Pepper’s chagrin. He wants this day to be about them and the people they love, and Tony likes that idea. He wishes, vaguely, that his mother could see this, could see just how happy he could be. Because as he looks around at the way Pepper has transformed the first floor of the mansion and the garden around back, as he considers the truly idiotic hijinks his fiancé and his best man are probably up to, Tony is happier than he dared to ever dream.
“I fucking missed you so much honey, I really did, it’s crazy yknow. No one around to force me to eat or sleep, I go a little crazy.”
After a few minutes, Tony decides that Steve’s had enough of a break and he reaches for the glass of water on the nightstand. Dragging the straw to Steve’s lips, he holds the other mans head up and allows him a few sips before pushing him back onto the mattress, placing the glass back where it belongs, and picking up the cane. Steve’s eyes are still closed so he doesn’t see it. Tony waves it next to Steve’s ear, lets him hear how it slices through the air, and his body goes so taught that Tony thinks he’s coming.
The next morning is like a scene out of that movie Pretty Woman. Steve wakes up in this huge lavish chamber of a bedroom, naked and tangled in Egyptian cotton with a thread count that probably reads like a paycheck. There’s come dried on his hip, he can feel the pillow lines creasing his face, and when he throws his legs over the side of the bed there’s a huge molten bruise on his thigh that looks like the beginnings of gangrene. His ass is sore in an overwhelmingly positive way and he smiles to himself, despite waking up alone, and wraps himself in a sheet to plod out of the bedroom and towards the stairs, which he walks down somehow without tripping and braining himself on the wall or banister.
“Exactly,” he winks. She’s facing forward and Tony catalogues all of the random information he can. Her slender nose is slightly crooked, there’s a scar on her jaw, too-short pieces of hair have escaped her smart updo and now curl prettily on the back of her neck, her lip gloss has lost a lot of its shine. “Would you like a drink?” he asks her. Tony’s almost positive she’ll say no, because he’s learned that she’s quite staunch and stubborn, but he reaches across her lap to grab a bottle of champagne and two flutes anyway. He could definitely go for some scotch after a long night of pointless schmoozing but he knows how that might look. Tony maintains eye contact as he pops the cork and pours two glasses. Happy pulls away from the curbs smoothly and Tony leans back into the cushions of the seats as he stares Eve down.
Tony growls in her ear, “That’s it pretty girl, you’re so goddamn cute, rubbing that greedy little cunt all over me. You just couldn’t wait huh? We weren’t far from home at all baby, you couldn’t wait twenty fucking minutes to get yourself off?” Tony laughs a little meanly, teasing her, and Eve whimpers when he does, “That’s okay though princess, don’t you worry your pretty little head about it, you just make yourself come. That’s all you care about anyway right? Getting that pretty pussy off?”
kick your ass to Jersey and back and this guy thought I was jokin’ so I shoved him. And as soon as I did it Nat comes out of the bathroom and the guy don’t even care that I’m trynna fight ‘im, he’s just throwing bodies outta the way to get to her and I’m like fuck no you’re not, so I grab him by the back of his shirt just as Steve grabs me by the back of mine and we all end up on the floor. Long story short, the guy was big and slow and I’m slippery as a motherfuckin’ snake okay Kate, so I start wailing on the son of a bitch, like I’m seriously fuckin’ his shit the fuck up-,”
So it’s Saturday and Steve goes to work and when he gets home at like 5 in the evening Bucky is sitting on the couch with the infamous Kate Bishop, who’s been spending quite a lot of time with them it seems, and Clint is in the kitchen cooking
Tony pulls away, “I love you too, baby,” he pants, his lips brushing against Steve’s as he forms his words. Steve’s half hard up against Tony’s thigh, grinding himself there in desperate need for friction. Tony, ever the generous lover, shifts so that his thigh is pressed solidly against Steve’s cock. He balances his weight on his elbows so that he can take Steve’s face between his large, square palms and look Steve rights in the eye. He can’t help it, he tilts his hips forward, squirming towards the heavy weight of his boyfriend. He’s fully hard now, reveling in Tony’s half dressed, possessive glory, getting off on the way he’s being held down by Tony’s stare. They’re breathing heavily into each other’s mouths as Steve presses himself even closer, chasing the sweet tug of Tony’s sweatpants against him.
. Blind Melon is blaring from the shitty speakers they keep in the living room and Bucky is trying to scream the merits of the horribly played out “No Rain” at Kate, who’s nodding along a little fearfully but listening to the lyrics more intently than is specifically necessary. Steve doesn’t know where Sam is but the fact that there’s a random 16 year old sitting on their couch breathing in the scent of Bucky’s weed breath is probably the reason why he’s not at home. Steve waves to them and walks into the kitchen to look curiously into Clint’s pan and then moves on to the refrigerator to possibly find some rotten apples to eat instead of whatever concoction Clint has brewing.
“I had to get it fitted this morning,” Steve tells him, breaking the silence. It’s so quiet in the room still, however, that Tony’s heavy breathing becomes the loudest noise around. They stare at each other, so much hanging in the unmoving air between them.
Steve bustles around the kitchen quickly. He grabs Tony’s favorite crystal decanter and fills it. He takes a glass as well, pours exactly how much Tony allows himself to drink, from the fridge Steve takes some grapes, slices an apple, and places the fruit in a small bowl. He sets all this on a tray. Steve stops in the hall to turn on the AC as well, and then makes his way back to the bedroom, anticipation making the hair on his arms stand on end. His cock twitches in his briefs.
Steve whimpers at the harsh tone of voice, frantic for touch but even more eager for the warmth of his daddy’s approval, “I take w-what daddy gives me,” he states dutifully, “I take what daddy gives me and no more.”
Natasha mutters, “Finally,” and tugs Bucky towards the car. Everyone else, in their drunken stupor, has no choice but to follow after her.
“God you’re tight. You’re so damn beautiful honeybunches, you feel so good. You’re prob’ly sick of all m-my talking,” Tony grunts and fucks into Steve just a bit harder, a touch too rough and Steve mewls, an embarrassing noise that makes his ears go pink, “But fuck baby boy, you’re just
“Somethin’ to do. Wanna help me out?” he says bluntly. Nothing shocks Rumlow anymore, nothing out Steve’s mouth at least, so the dude just stands there in bland silence for a second before letting him in and shoving him towards the basement stairs. They never fuck upstairs, but that’s cool with Steve because he’s not sure he’d want to see the weird, secret domestic set up he and Jack Rollins have got set up. It seems like an invasion of privacy when he even wanders through their kitchen some mornings.
Grinning, Tony teases, “Took you long enough,” and gives Steve a look that goes straight to his cock. Three weeks doesn’t seem like that long, but it is. In fact, it’s too long. Tony steps right into Steve’s personal bubble, trapping him in place by bracing his arms on either side of Steve’s hips. He smells like metal and oil and faintly of the expensive, spicy cologne he’s always wearing. They’re so close that when Steve speaks, their lips brush.
Steve’s pretty sure Tony’s different because he feels different with Tony. In the past he’s been known to get around some; so much so that a few of the guys he regularly fuck with hit him up and ask him where he’s been and he doesn’t feel the slightest need to make up excuses and try to ensure that they’ll hang on to whatever thin thread there is connecting them to one another. He ignores them and he doesn’t feel guilty and he doesn’t tell himself he’s being stupid; he doesn’t tell himself that he’s going to need one of them sometime soon and blowing them off will bite him in the ass eventually. He finds that he is alright with only having Tony pay attention to him; Tony would never not answer when Steve needs him just because he didn’t suck his cock the way he wanted him to the night before. And Tony keeps his time pretty occupied. He figures that’s reason enough.
“What a lovely sight,” Tony muses, pulling his own shirt off. He moves towards the bed, his eyes never moving away from Steve’s as he inches closer and closer. Soon, he’s lying over Steve’s splayed body, his hands on either side of Steve’s head, his chest lowered until their skin is touching. His lips run across Steve’s face, going from his cheekbones to the swell of his eyebrow, down to the sensitive skin of Steve’s neck where he sucks a small bruise. “Love you like this,” he mutters into Steve’s ear, making Steve shiver.
Natasha returns, not a hair out of place but breathing a little erratically, “So we have to go,” she announces bluntly, and drags Bucky off the ground with no help from anyone else. There’s a smatter of some dark liquid on the foot of her boot that implies she’s probably done something violent but no one mentions it and they all start stumbling away smartly.
“Y-you wiped it—all that yknow—all over my face. And then you pinched m-my nose and—oh fuck Tony don’t stop, that feels so goddamn good, you don’t even know just don’t stop,” Steve starts to beg before he remembers what he was talking about. Tony has started to speed up, only slightly, but he’s been fucking into Steve’s ass so slowly, tenderly, that the infinitesimal change is very noticeable. “I couldn’t
, helping her along, bounces his leg some more, “Fucking come for me, pretty girl. Wanna lick you clean as soon as we’re alone,” and that’s it, she’s done.
“Yes, I do,” Tony shrugs, “I have been given plenty of reason to believe I’m pretty smart. Smarter than you, smarter than everyone in this fucking building, actually. I thought we covered this.”
Tony switches to torturing Steve’s other nipple, and as he goes back and forth Steve’s noises get louder and needier. He unleashes a particularly harsh snap, vertically over multiple welts, right on the sensitive little nub and Steve starts to cry. His cock is so hard it’s practically purple. Tony himself is breathing heavily, his own prick a heavy, needy weight in his pants, but he tries to ignore it. He lays a few stripes on Steve’s thighs, instructing “I wanna see you play with your tits,” as he does so. Steve whines, tears slipping down his cheeks, and does as he’s told. He looks up at Tony with pleading blue eyes and squeezes his own nipples, tugging at them and pulling them away from his body, twisting them cruelly. Tony doesn’t allow himself to be distracted, but it takes a great deal of effort. Steve is so fucking hot, he’s so goddamn gorgeous like this Tony can barely stand to look at him. Groaning, Tony continues to use the cane, laying stripes on the bottom of Steve’s feet too.
Steve lowers himself onto the couch first, not saying anything, but when Tony goes to kneel in front of him, he stops the other man with a sharp pinch to his thigh.
Sometimes Steve forgets that he’s supposed to be cool and edgy, aloof and absolutely unaffected by all of the sappy emotional shit that everyone else is plagued by. He watches Bucky and Natasha in the morning—the way they move with each other with gentle hands placed on hips, private smiles, and soft laughter as they go about making coffee for the entire house—and he’s both endeared and slightly disgusted. It’s weird, seeing his best friend all strung out on love because it makes him different and it makes him ridiculous, it always has. Steve staunchly refuses to be that person, but it’s often hard to remember because of Tony.
Kate looks to Steve, as if this proves something. Steve shrugs, “It is for Bucky. That’s just how he is.”
Steve wonders aloud, “So where’s the truck now?” Clint, sitting on the couch and now sipping his cold coffee from the pot (as in a literal Martha Stewart pot), looks to him forlornly, but not regretfully.
for a pen or pencil as soon as they’re in Tony’s chartered car. It’s a black BMW and a man named Happy drives it to this glorious location in Malibu atop a hill. Steve nearly gags upon seeing it because what the
, and it was all very stressful, as one could imagine. Tony could imagine, obviously, because it’s not like Steve had told him how stretched thin and anxious he had been feeling, but his boyfriend just knew. Because Tony knew him better than anyone, maybe even better than Sam and Bucky. In just a year he had managed to dig himself a home in the deep, empty parts of Steve and set up shop. Hell, he’d started making repairs. Steve loved him and feared him for all of the power that he held.
It is a Saturday, so that means everyone in the house is gearing up to go out. Steve likes partying with his friends and always has. Bucky was sure that would change when Steve and Tony got together, was convinced that Steve would give up their dive bars and brawls for the life of posh wine clubs in the Hamptons, but Steve could never. For one thing, he hates going anywhere where he has to remove his nose ring, and for another none of those places play any good music. So of course, when the announcements rings through the house (“Dexter’s!” Bucky had screamed it at the top of his lungs from the stairs leading to the attic) Steve persuades Tony into the shower with him and they clean up for a night of sweaty grinding and drunken yelling.
“I could manage that too hon, would you like that? Hmm Rogers? Would you thank me if I got my cock out  and let you bounce on it until we get home? I can feel how wet your pussy is already, I know you want it, know you’re fucking open and ready right now,” he bites out, and Rogers just uses her grip on his hair for leverage as she humps against his hands faster than he was rubbing at her clit. He likes that his words are getting to her, likes that she’s just getting wetter and wetter as he mumbles dirty things in her ear, likes watching that blush go deeper and deeper. So far she’s pink in the face and the blush is steadily traveling down her neck, dipping past the necklace resting at the hollow of her throat. She lets out a choked little moan at one point and thrusts even faster, grinding against him fast and hard, getting close. She muffles a whimper with a harsh, stinging kiss, forcing her tongue into Tony’s mouth instantly, licking into him and sighing. They’re both panting and groaning but Tony’ desperately needs some friction. Watching the way she moves, he knows he’s leaking into his briefs.
“Oh, you’re such a beautiful boy. You’re so lovely baby, so gorgeous. Good boy, good boy, you did so well, you’re exactly what I wanted,” Tony gasps happily before spilling inside of Steve. He can feel the warm spurt of liquid on his insides, and that’s he last thing he registers before allowing himself to surrender completely.
“You treat me like I’m fucking disposable, Steve! You call me when you need something; when you need to get high, when you need to get fucked, when you can’t to deal with the fact that you have this amazing talent and you work at a fucking coffee shop. You need me and then you fucking leave me, and you don’t even see, you don’t even
“You gave me a home, Tony,” Steve tells him seriously. When Steve is being solemn and making promises he puts on his Serious Voice. It’s the voice that makes parents, colleagues, and superiors alike trust him. It’s the voice that tells Tony when he’s being and idiot and that Steve loves him. “And I can’t thank you enough for that.”
“That’s it gorgeous, that’s it. You’re so welcome baby, you deserve it, you’re so lovely,” Tony tells Steve, who whimpers and reaches out for Tony. Tony kneels on the bed and takes Steve’s face in his hands, kissing him hard as he works through the aftershocks.
Steve blinks at him. There’s no way for his intoxicated mind to process this. Why is Tony here? How did he know to come? Is everyone going to tell him about all the shit Steve’s been saying all night? Steve climbs down from the little step thing in the back to climb up the one in front. Sam stumbles into the seat behind him and when all the doors are shut and the lights go off Bucky takes in a deep breath.
“You’re so fucking stupid,” Rogers groans, tearing at Tony’s sweatshirt. He pulls it over Tony’s head quickly, and his huge hands wander over Tony’s stomach and chest until he’s cradling Tony’s head in his hands and jerking him forward into another bruising kiss. Tony moans into it, reaching for Steve’s belt buckle and pulling his half hard cock out, not bothering with any preamble. Steve is long and thick, throbbing in Tony’s hand immediately, and he groans when Tony rubs his thumb over his cockhead.
Tony though, for all of his messy, clumsy affection, doesn’t react badly. Instead, he crawls into the bed with Steve and forces him to make eye contact. His eyes are very brown and pretty and Steve wants to say that too. He doesn’t know what’s gotten into him to make him this weird vocal person.
“Okay, and then that means you know how I feel about that type of shit. I don’t want to date him. I just know he wants to date me and I need to figure out what to do with that information.”
It’s quiet in the house as they step together and hug. Steve is completely naked and the only article of clothing tony is missing is a pair of pants, but they hang on to each other like limpets for a few shaky moments that Steve takes to ease the flow of tears he can feel wanting to fall. He refuses to cry right now. He just needs this, just wants this. Knowing that it’s okay to want this makes it easier to breathe.
“I would have to agree with you there,” Tony nods, “I hope this was a satisfactory birthday present to Pep.”
, not nearly as thick as the one Tony packed, and purposefully rough as if it hadn’t been properly shaped. It’s beautiful and strange, and Tony can immediately picture himself wearing it. He wants to cry. He wants to scream. He wants to dance. But he can’t move because he’s just so damn surprised.
Clint takes a drink, “Well. Usually when you date someone, you spend a lot of time with them. And then you fall in love,” he says practically.
Steve backs him further into his own room, kicking the door shut behind him. He pivots then, so Tony is pinned against it, grabbing his wrists and holding them in his iron hold up by his ears, “Don’t scare me like that again Tony,” he whispers brokenly. Tony wants to shout at him, act out in some way because he can’t promise that, he can’t promise not to put himself at risk when that’s literally his job. Instead, he bites at Steve’s bottom lip and bucks his hips, grinding his hard prick against Steve’s thigh.
He murmurs, “Hopefully you experience a little death,” and mouths at her neck, placing messy kisses there.
So Steve makes his way downstairs, and still no sign of anyone else. The living room is left relatively tidy, like Sam attempted to straighten up before retiring for the evening, and Clint’s shoes are still directly in front of the door, but there’s no sign of him. In the kitchen there are three empty boxes of cereal and one of those plates shaped like an animal’s face with donuts stacked on top of it, a pleasant surprise that could turn deadly if not properly assessed. Steve opens the fridge, his head tilted so that his good ear can get some action.
Clint grimaces, “Some guy was harassing her, okay. She was in Hell’s Kitchen visiting a friend I think? And she was waiting at the bus stop and this dude was bothering her. And you know, I was walking out of one of those mob buildings out there-,”
in it baby, put your face in it,” she groans, yanking Steve’s head abruptly off of the mattress towards her slickness, “Please baby, suck on my clit, suck on it, suck.” And then she breaks and starts fucking Steve’s mouth. He gets his lips around her clit, swirls around the nub with his tongue and giving her quick, gentle sucks. Toni grabs Steve’s hair in both hands and thrusts her hips quickly, grinding down on Steve’s mouth fast and hard. It kind of hurts his nose, but Steve doesn’t complain, just lets her go to town. Toni is so fucking hot like this, panting and groaning, covered in a fine sheen of sweat, her hair curling at the ends as the room heats up. Steve rests his hand on her ass to feel how she flexes, the muscles working powerfully as she uses him. Steve eventually moves his hand to his prick, rubbing the heel of his palm over himself and groaning at the friction. He’s beyond keyed up, his balls already tightening and his cockhead leaking copiously. Steve’s pretty sure he could come from listening to Toni’s noises alone. Her voice goes so whiny, like she’s about to cry because it feels so good, and she lets out a constant stream of filthy language that makes lust stir Steve’s insides.
“In my lap,” he commands. Tony’s eyes droop closed for a second and he shudders but brings his knees up to straddle Steve like he was told. Tony hovers over Steve’s lap and waits for further instructions or the okay to make the next move. “I missed you baby. I missed you so much,” Steve tells him, sliding a thumb past Tony’s plush lips. Tony sucks the digit into his mouth, laving over it obscenely, drooling down the length and watching as his saliva pools in Steve’s hand. With the other hand, Steve unbuttons his jeans, wasting no time with foreplay. Tony is already hard and dripping as Steve tugs his cock from the confines of his briefs and Steve dips a finger into the drop of precome welling at the head of Tony’s dark length to taste. He closes his eyes as if savoring it and Tony squirms in his lap, trying to thrust into the loose grip Steve has on him.
Now he’s being tortured by satellite radio and wondering if he really does blush and giggle and just generally act a fool whenever he thinks about Steve. It’s probably true. Pepper wouldn’t lie. She probably just genuinely thinks they’re a nice couple; plenty of people have said as much. He and Steve go well together and they’re very much in love and no one thinks that’s something to make fun of, right. It’s not embarrassing to be in love with your boyfriend or for people to be able to see it on your face.
“Good morning,” he calls cheerfully. Steve is dressed in plaid pajamas and thick, fluffy socks instead of the running gear Tony expected. He’s got a mug of coffee in one hand and he sets it carefully on the bedside table before placing a kiss on Tony’s forehead. Slowly, he clamors into bed and pulls the comforter over his body, tucking himself up next to his boyfriend. He drapes one arm around Tony’s waist, like another, heavier blanket, and wraps his hand around Tony’s wrist.
things because Steve liked them and he didn’t really expect much in return. It was weird, Steve didn’t know what to do with it.
“Fuck do you want?” Rumlow says, throwing the door open. He’s got a cigarette in his mouth, hand rolled, which means he and Rollins have probably just fought and he’ll give it to Steve real good to let it all out.
“Motherfucking Christ,” Toni spits, “I’m gonna come so hard—I’m gonna come on your face—fuck, your gorgeous fucking face. Baby, goddamn, goddamn, suck on it like that,” and she continues on like that, fucking her clit at the perfect angle to light herself up. Steve loves being used like this by Toni, he loves watching her take what she needs like this. She gets so—so fucking riled up, is all, and she can’t be tamed. It’s like watching her unravel or strip.
He babbles, “It’s not! Just fun Tony, this isn’t just fun for me okay- it was never, this could never have been just fun. Not after that first night. Not after that day we spent at the Central Park Zoo, or at Gagosian Galleries when you let me get tipsy off all that expensive champagne. Not- this wasn’t just fun after you sat for 3 hours and let me draw you. This was- I couldn’t lie to you and tell you this has been anything like the “fun” I’ve had, and trust me I’ve had a lot,” he says in a rush and Tony still isn’t breaking, totally unresponsive to his kisses and attempts at affection. Hell, Steve has let the sheet fall and is standing naked in front of him, letting his hands roam all over Tony’s chest and usually at this point he’d relent and give in to whatever Steve wants but not this time.
Attempting to be sexy, Steve contorts his body into some kind of slither as he makes his way to Tony. He wants to get his mouth around Tony’s cock, wants to bite a bruise into Tony’s chest, or something, anything. Tony just grabs his hand though, threads their fingers together, and situates Steve on his lap so that Steve is sitting on his thighs and both of their hard cocks are visible between them. Tony always leaks something fierce, so his length is thick, and wet and Steve wants it inside of him like
“I don’t want to distract you. And I don’t think your business partners would appreciate you bringing the twink piece of ass you’re screwing along for meetings.”
when you think about your Steve then I’m not gonna judge you. It’s not a bad thing or a funny thing,” she assured him, “It’s just sweet, is all. Don’t worry.”
“Give it to me baby, let me see you,” he demands lowly, “C’mon, those little panties are already ruined sweetheart, just let go,” Tony plants both of his hands on her hips and
“I didn’t mean to,” Clint says apologetically, “she was just so alone, y’know? And I had to do something.”
“Sorry ‘bout that fella,” he sighs. The two of them let the moment hang there, breathing each other’s air and allowing the need to build before their mouths are crashing together. They groan simultaneously, and Steve’s cock throbs; he hasn’t heard that noise in three weeks. He devours all the sounds Tony’s making, quiet hums and moans of pleasure at their closeness, and licks across Tony’s bottom lip, and Tony lets them fall open, invites Steve’s hot, wet tongue into his mouth. He sucks on Steve’s tongue hungrily, like he wishes it were his dick instead. Steve brings his hands to either side of Tony’s face, holding the other man still as he licks into his mouth. Tony’s hips grind in a dirty rhythm, his erection a hot brand against Steve’s own straining length.
Steve sighs, obviously blissed out. His eyes are barely tracking, honestly, but he looks like he’s trying to convey something to Tony. Tony just nods like he understands, simpering sympathetically, “Yeah I know baby, I
Steve takes one look at Tony (clad in a rare pair of dark blue jeans and a sweatshirt that so obviously doesn’t belong to him) and he knows that there’s absolutely no way they’re going to make it the
“Alright girls, Tony’s head is already too big for his body, let him alone,” Bucky gripes, but he’s laid out in the grass looking an awful lot like a cat that got the cream so there’s not any bite in his words. Steve is spread out next to him and Tony wants to lick the slice of skin exposed between his shorts and where his shirt has ridden up, but he knows that’s inappropriate. The day has been so perfect. He thinks about the box with the ring in it, sitting now in the sock drawer at his apartment back in Boston, and he’s about ten seconds away from jumping in his car and driving home to go get it. He can’t be away from Steve though. Being in his presence when he’s this happy is like standing next to the sun.
Tony starts to jerk them off faster now; one hand moves purposefully over their hard lengths, pressed together, and the other hold steadfast around Steve’s throat, watching how it makes him go pink as he gulps in air. It’s heady, giving this much over to another person, telling them they have the power to decide when you get to fucking
This time, when he pulls his hand away, Tony’s vision is swimming and he desperately gulps in air, shaking. He’s thrusting his hips up quickly, chasing the beautiful friction and working to come.
Bucky asks, “You wanna hit?” Kate nods. There’s a 15 minute discussion about whether or not they should smoke up the random 16 year old girl until Clint finally makes it downstairs and tells them that he’s taking her to a nightclub and smoking her up won’t be necessary anyway. Steve feels like he should probably object on principal but he’s under the influence so he won’t be held accountable.
Steve quakes with relief; his dick is so hard and hot and aching, he could practically cry as soon as he wraps his hand around himself, “Thank you daddy, thank you so much,” he cries, and begins stroking eagerly. Tony hasn’t told him how fast he’s allowed to go, so Steve just lets himself have it, jerking himself fast and rough. His cock is wet with precome and he barely needs to spit in his hand to get himself wet.
The rest of the day isn’t nearly as eventful. Bucky comes home maybe three hours later with his car, wearing a leather jacket with nothing underneath like some kind of wannabe, and holding the hand of a girl about Steve’s size who looks scared out of her mind and totally out of place. It’s Kate Bishop. After taking in the sight of the classic pre war architecture of the building, the real hardwood floors, and crown molding, she also takes in the sight of Steve in one of Bucky’s Pink Floyd tees and his underwear on the couch next to the Dog Box, sipping tequila out of a milk jug and smoking a bowl with Sam and introduces herself politely. Steve can see why Clint was so endeared. Her chin’s jutted out confidently and clenched nervously, and her hand must holding Bucky’s incredibly tightly, because all of the muscles in her right arm are tensed. She surveys them cleverly, like she’s trying to do it without them noticing, and Steve ignores this to introduce himself and Sam and call Clint down from his room. Kate takes a ginger seat on one of the stools in front of the breakfast bar.
The words “I do” fall from Tony’s lips so easily he almost doesn’t remember why he’d been so worried in the first place.
. He’s crying. He sniffles for good measure, in case anyone in their small audience couldn’t tell how pathetically in love he is.
“We really appreciate it,” the woman (who Steve correctly assumed was the notorious Pepper Potts) had smiled warmly, “Who knew security would be necessary at an art gallery.”
Tony doesn’t look away from the screen when he says, “No but seriously, I’ll go with you if you want me there.”
Tony is only considering these things because he’s got a lot of free time on his hands. The drive from MIT to Brown isn’t usually a long one, probably only an hour, but he got a late start and now Tony has been intermittently sitting in traffic for 96 minutes. The radio is always playing silly love ballads and Tony has effectively been drawn down into the rabbit hole of his brain’s thoughts on the subject matter. It’s all Pepper’s fault really. If she hadn’t been teasing him before he left he wouldn’t be doing this to himself.
“What is it?” and just as he asks, Steve pushes something into Tony’s hand. He doesn’t move to sit up straight, he doesn’t stop with the blinking, he doesn’t do anything but wait. Tony separates their hands, his heart beginning to throb as he recognizes the shape. He’s sweating immediately his mind racing as he starts to panic.
“Daddy please,” he whines, trying to speed the process along. Tony loves foreplay, he loves seeing Steve strung out on pleasure and shaking and begging, but Steve wants the main event. Patience is not a virtue Steve was born with, unfortunately.
engraved on the inside. And it’s not the most expensive piece of jewelry he’s ever bought, not by a long shot, but it’s definitely worth more than anything else he has in this world.
So they make their way over to the bar, where Steve locks eyes with Clint and gives him a specific look that means, vehemently, DO NOT ENGAGE I’M TRYING TO GET FUCKED BY THIS GUY, and takes a seat so Tony can buy Steve a drink. He orders a few rounds of Silver 1800, like they’d discussed and sit at the bar and chat for a while. It’s pretty good. Steve can even ignore the docile tones of teenage bubblegum angst in the background while Tony’s talking because the man is an amazing storyteller, and he laughs a lot. He’s exactly Steve’s type, except softer and less angry, and more likely to encourage Steve to keep talking instead of trying to shut him up. Steve doesn’t really know how to handle that softness, the lack of an edge; most of the men he’s slept with in the past haven’t had the time to listen to his rambling about Nickelodeon cartoons or the expensive paints he’d splurged on for his birthday. Most of the men Steve’s slept with have been quick and to the point, efficient almost in their way of seduction, but Tony isn’t. Tony rambles with Steve, drunkenly meanders through their conversation happily, as if he isn’t ashamed to be seen with Steve, or ashamed to be
In the bedroom JARVIS dials up the lights and Steve pulls Toni back into another searing kiss. She goes limp in his arms like she sometimes does, arms hanging down at her sides as Steve envelopes her. First his hands frame her face, and then his arms are wrapped around her midriff, and then he’s lifting gently, so that he can toss her on the bed. Toni squeaks in surprise when she lands on her back.
Kate interjects, “No need to yell now,” she observes, albeit a little loudly like her ears haven’t adjusted yet. This is common for people who aren’t used to sharing space with both Bucky and music at the same time. It’s just not possible for the guy to listen to anything, not even his whiny emo shit, at a normal volume.
And Steve didn’t mind one bit. The way Tony treated him when they fucked like this was no different than how Tony always treated him; as if he were precious, worth being protected instead of always being the protector. Tony looms over him now, eyes heavy lidded and dark with primal desire, hips snapping forward slowly but harshly and thrusting his hard cock deep inside of Steve, rubbing the fat head of his dick right up against his prostate.
So when Steve drags her panties off, pushes her legs apart and peers at her soaking cunt Toni just shudders, moans and waits for him to say, “C’mon, sweet thing, I want you on top.” He shucks off his shirt, pops the fly of his pants and rolls onto his back. Toni enthusiastically moves to swing one leg over his head, plants her knees firmly in the soft mattress, and grips the headboard. They’ve had so many date nights like this that the routine is very familiar, but still arousing and intoxicating.
“Hey there, soldier,” he chuckles, rubbing his hand over Steve’s back. He’s like a giant puppy. Even with his bulky muscles and sometimes severe eyebrows, Steve is really just the cutest thing. Tony wants to bop his perfect nose. It’s humiliating.
, of all things. “It’s not that either, I promise,” he assures Steve, standing to meet him over at the sink. They stand facing each other, hips knocking against the counter. Steve reaches a hand out and rests it on the back of Tony’s neck, warm and heavy and so perfect.
“Oh my goodness!” Steve gasps, hopping up. He deposits his laptop on the couch and jumps to wrap Tony in a hug. He smells freshly showered, his skin still warm and pink with it. Tony buries his face in Steve’s neck and allows himself a few precious moments of simply taking him in before focusing.
this is not my life,” he says in awe as they step through the threshold. The floors are this weird tan color like sand, but classy and not annoying, and everything is decorated in neutral shades of beige and brown with the accentuation of green everywhere. It’s like stepping into the desert, but with A/C and a California king bed.
“Steve Rogers,” Steve introduced himself sheepishly. He stuck out his hand for Pepper to shake and before she could grasp his hand in hers, Tony stepped forward and threw his arm over Steve’s shoulder; and just like that he was Tony’s.
Steve chuckles darkly, “Sweet thing I can tell,” he reaches up to get a hand in Tony’s hair again, and doesn’t miss the way the other man goes almost completely limp when he fists the curls there and pulls Tony’s ear to his mouth, never slowing his hand on their dicks, “You’re so fucking
“Oh yeah? And what does that s-say about you, Captain? Following me here like a lost fucking puppy? You must be desperate; you must need this even more than I do. I could have anybody, yknow that? I don’t-don’t
“Yum,” he laughs breathlessly. Toni rolls her eyes good-naturedly and as a distraction for the both of them, leans backwards to run her own hand over Steve’s dick. He hisses; he’s so hard he’d probably pop as soon as he felt her bare skin.
They don’t really talk about it though. After their first few conversations about it—Steve telling him he applied for the program, Steve telling him he was accepted to the program, and Steve telling him he was afraid to accept his acceptance—they don’t ever talk about the situation in as many words for quite a while. Steve wouldn’t leave until the beginning of his senior year, so they still have about five months, but Pepper keeps telling him they should sit down and hash everything out so that they’re on the same page. Tony agrees in a logical sense, but the more emotional part of him would love to just ignore his impending doom for as long as possible.
“You’re so fucking gorgeous like this,” Tony moans, watching him intently, “I can’t get enough. And you love it so much, you’re so needy. I’ve barely gotta do anything to get you goin’, you’re just so
“Absolutely,” she confirms, and in the midst of this super charged moment she bats his hands away and climbs into his lap with an unexpected ease and dexterity. Tony’s hands instinctively fall to her small waist and he groans as he realizes that his fingers are nearly touching; his grip nearly encompasses her entire width. It’s heady, feeling like he could break this woman in half but knowing, as he feels her muscles bunch and shift beneath his hands, that anything he does to her tonight is being
“Lucky me then,” he breathes. Rogers smirks haughtily and drapes her arms over his shoulders so that she may whisper in Tony’s ear.
When they pull up to Tony’s building, Steve has to fight not to say something embarrassing about being poor. Instead he gives Tony a sly look and tucks his hands into the pockets of Bucky’s old leather jacket he’s wearing, “Nice digs, daddy,” he snorts and in return he gets a surprisingly heated look.
Steve isn’t a sap by any means, very rarely gets caught in the trappings of sentimental values, but there’s always been something about Tony that brings it out of him. Tony will lay in Steve’s bed, under the ratty comforter that will always smell like acrylic paints and weed, and he’ll just look up at Steve with those big, brown eyes and something in Steve’s chest will be knocked loose. Steve will get lost in him, breathe in the sweet, heady scent of Tony’s cologne, run his fingers over Tony’s smooth, tan skin. The world narrows to the tiny pinpoint of space that Steve is sharing with Tony and nothing exists outside of them. It would be amazing if it weren’t totally embarrassing. Or worse yet, they’ll be in the penthouse lying next to each other in the dark and Tony will be talking about the stars that they can’t see due to light pollution, and his voice will take this beautiful low timbre so that Steve can
at this. He looks at Steve like he doesn’t even recognize him, and that hits Steve right in the gut. He’s absolutely bowled over by the furrow in Tony’s brow, the betrayal written all over the older man’s face as he shoves himself out of his own bed to escape Steve. There’s a burning sensation in the cavity of Steve’s chest that he’s pretty sure means he’s either having a heart attack or falling in love and he’s terribly scared.
“You’re not high are you?” Rhodey asks helpfully. The room they’re in used to be the help’s quarters. Now it’s Tony’s wedding dressing room.
“You’re right, you’re right—oh fuck—daddy, I’m sorry. Whatever you want, sorry! I mean—” he yelps when Tony adds another finger, forcing him open and massaging over his slick, quivering insides, “
Nat rolls her eyes, “James and I are going to dinner with my father tomorrow after I’m done with class and I wasn’t sure if it would be a good idea to not only show up to school looking like I’ve been in a mosh pit, but to bring James to meet my father looking like he’s been in a mosh pit.”
“You do as I say, you understand?” Steve snarls, eyes dark with power and uncontrollable lust, watching Tony squirm and making his eyes water with lack of oxygen. When Steve finally lets go Tony’s head is swimming and arousal is lighting him on fire from the inside; he’s so horny his stomach hurts.
Tony rumbles, “Good boy,” and spits right onto Steve’s hole in a shocking display of dominance, “good fucking boy.” Steve’s eyes roll back in his head.
Steve sighs, because yeah it’s not what he said but he wishes it were, “I said I think I might love you maybe a little,” he admits, and rolls over. His stomach doesn’t come with him.
“Who the hell do you think you are Rogers?” Tony rasps, and before he can let out another smart ass comment, Steve is shoving three fingers into Tony’s mouth, stroking over the fleshy parts at the back of his throat and gagging him. When he pulls away those fingers are covered in stringy saliva, thick and runny, and he uses it as lube when he takes both of their cock in his hand and begins furiously stroking over their hard lengths. Tony writhes as Steve’s foreskin rubs against the silky skin of his own hard prick, his body lighting up at the rough feeling of the post battle scrapes and callouses on Steve’s hands. The younger man presses them together, chest to chest, so that he can whisper in Tony’s ear, once again placing his hand over Tony’s throat and giving a hearty
The rain slowed for a moment, the window whipping it the other way, and Steve caught the soft strains of Tony whistling a tune in the kitchen while he cleaned up from dinner. He looked over his mug at his fiancé, unable to hold back a smile. Tony's hips shook left then right as he wiped a cloth over the granite countertop. Steve tipped his head to the side, finding an angle that let him see all those curves…
“Just prom stuff. You wouldn’t have to kiss me or anything.” Tony laughed, and Steve choked on nothing. “Hold my hand, maybe dance a little, show up together, leave together. And if Brock or Justin asks, you say I asked you and you said yes.” Tony trotted along at Steve’s side as they walked down the hall. “I mean if we were going to go as friends anyway, it wouldn’t be that different… right? I guess… unless there was someone you wanted to ask?”
He supposed the other reason why he’d been putting this off was that he so desperately didn’t want to run into Steve upstairs in the hall, brushing his teeth in his stupid adorable sweatpants. Tony would almost inevitably say something idiotic and make this fight stretch out even longer.
Tony looked up and realized there were two men in tactical gear in the basement with them but they filed out at Steve’s command. Steve pulled his helmet back on - somehow keeping Tony from falling one-handed - and carried Tony up the stairs and out the front door of the house. There was a large, black van idling in the driveway. Steve opened the back door and sat Tony down, feet hanging over the back bumper. He produced a blanket from somewhere and pulled it around his shoulders. “Tony?”
Steve’s tongue peeked out from between his teeth. “Think we passed that well more than a few hours ago, but yeah, we definitely do.” He wiggled his hips. “Ravish me, birthday boy.”
But the boy brightened and nodded, then bent and unclipped the leash from the dog’s collar who immediately took off towards them. Steve tensed, not wanting the dog to get too excited and barrel Tony over, but she skidded to a stop right in front of the startled toddler and collapsed onto the ground about a foot away. She dropped her head onto her paws, stretched out as close to Tony as she could get without actively touching him and gave a soft sigh, her puff of a tail swinging back and forth violently. “She loves kids,” the boy said, appearing at Steve’s side. “She’s super gentle.”
"[German] We went to Ellis Island to see the statues again the other day, and I wish I could have gone up and hugged him… or even kissed him."
“Yes. If I wait for you to strip down and shower I’ll fall asleep again. But I need to feel you before it’s tomorrow and we’re back to our lives. Please?”
Steve blinked at them all, trying to take in everything at once. There was a shelf with at least twenty black instrument cases on it, two, large carpet tiles with drum kits on them, stands with guitars, basses, violins - everything. Half of them, Steve didn’t even recognize.
“Oh, you -” Steve broke off with a growl then he reached out and hauled a laughing Tony into his arms. He threw him over his shoulder, surprised by how light a Tony in his twenties was, and made for the quinjet. He dropped Tony in his seat then sat beside him, legs thrown over Tony’s lap to pin him where he was.
“Yeah, I -” Tony ran his fingers through his hair, getting tangled in the wet knots. “Me too. I mean - it is. But this is about public perception.”
So his only option was to tell Steve honestly that he had a problem with his boyfriend - a problem that was entirely his own - and that he might need some time to get over it. Steve was a good guy - the best - he’d understand. Maybe Tony would have his shit figured out in time to be their best man, in time to be honestly happy for Steve that he’d found someone he loved and who loved him back.
“Absolutely,” Tony murmured into his chest, drooling a little as he moved his lips. “Which box has the sleds in it?”
The distant hum of machinery steered him to the south. He couldn’t tell if the fight was inside the castle or out, but maybe there’d be a way to sneak out unseen in the chaos. Then the hum shifted, changed; it - it sounded like repulsors. Was Tony’s tech being used all over the world now?
Steve tipped his head back until it hung over the arm of the couch. He stretched again, and the pop in his back and the groan of his legs were pleasant this time. There was a dark line of… something on the ceiling, and Steve wondered idly if Bucky and Clint had been playing paintball inside again.
“Oh.” It wasn’t like a slap - a slap was personal, sharp, full of emotion. This was cold, empty, flat. Not a hit, a dismissal. “You used me.” It wasn’t a question.
But that was nothing to the nervousness he felt waiting for the door at the other end of the room to open.
Tony groaned and flopped back into his seat, filling the cab with the sound of his heaving breaths. “Guh,” he said, and then he laughed quietly. “Wow. I can’t - I think my brain is -” He waved his hand. “Wow.”
She dropped her hand, and Steve tensed, not pressing, but matching the pressure Tony was exerting, keeping them locked in the middle. Tony pushed, but not with his full strength, and Steve looked up to ask him if that was all he had, when Tony leaned forward, erasing the last few inches between them and pressing his lips to Steve’s.
Literally everyone knew him on sight. No one was going to believe that Tony Stark was on Tinder in Chicago.
The wedding reception still raged on down the street, but Tony had slipped out early, feeling the thudding of his heart low in his core. This was going to suck. A lot. But he had no choice.
“Shit. Inside the tower?” Tony flipped the faceplate down and ran a full diagnostic of his air filtration system. If there was a contaminant in the tower, the others might have already been affected. He needed to take the time to be careful.
And Steve knew they really should spend the night back at the apartment where half their stuff still lived, where their bed and coffee maker were, but they owned this house now, and he wanted to spend their first night as homeowners in the house they owned, as silly as it was. He tugged his shiny, silver key out of his pocket and sighed. “Yeah, I wanna spend the night here. It’s stupid, though. It’s a Wednesday and neither of us will get and sleep, and then we’ll be unpacking exhausted…”
Chapters 73-96, were written for the Steve Tony Games, and I was on Team Angst. Some of these have happy endings, some do not. They're mostly darker than what I normally write. I will put tags in the notes here on each one, but do be aware that angst was the primary motivation for these (and points :P) so they taste a little different from what I usually put up.
Steve gripped his glass tighter. He wished the alcohol would have an effect on him, but instead it was just making him feel a little dehydrated. If he had to smile at one more damn person and pretend he was alright, he was going to scream.
“It was you! In that alley! The naked guy who got beat up! Holy shit. I thought I’d dreamed that! Bucky told me it was a fever-induced hallucination and made me stay in bed for two weeks.
In contrast, studies of bonding chemicals and pheromone production when exposed to viable life-mate have been illuminating.
Tony lay a hand flat on the counter and leaned in. “I have a good memory too. The last time I ordered black with two sugars was two and a half weeks ago.”
It had been hard, at first, to deal with their discomfort around each other, and then hard again, later, when they drifted into fast friends and Steve couldn’t help but feel a bit jealous. But happiness for their happiness overwhelmed that quickly, and both men made a clear effort to make sure Steve didn’t feel left behind. After the awkward transition period, it became all about watching the soap opera unfold and wondering if and when they were finally going to figure their shit out.
“What do you have planned tonight?” Tony snuck a glance at his watch. It was only ten in the morning. Plenty of time to fret, and plenty of time for Steve to get even more elaborate in his birthday plans.
This is for two of my 2018 bday prompts. One is for snooglepoot, who asked for "I'm so lucky to have you" and the other is anon who asked for slow domestic Sunday morning!
Tony not-so-subtly checked his watch again then suppressed a sigh. Thirty-six minutes. He’d been sitting here like an idiot, completely silent, for thirty-six minutes, while Steve gushed over a woman in bright pink overalls with a pencil stuck in her wild, blonde hair.
And when he had something on his mind, it was even worse. Tony was just down the hall, in Cooper’s room, sleeping. Probably sleeping easily, and Steve couldn’t stop thinking about him.
The guard stepped away and revealed Tony, surrounded by men and women in suits, looking over his sunglasses at the situation. At the sight of Steve, his mouth dropped open for a moment, then he frowned. "Uh…"
An hour later, a soft knock on the penthouse door failed to rouse the sleeping Tony. Steve knocked again, louder. Still nothing. He called out, “Tony?” then pushed the door open. They’d had an agreement to spar in the gym, but Tony hadn’t shown.
Tony clutched him close, giggling into his neck even as his hand kept up its teasing explorations. “We’re going to die here.”
Nose is pushing himself up to his feet with a growl, and Tony’s considering stomping on his balls too, when Steve grabs his sleeve and pulls him deeper into the alley. “Come on!”
“Um. I’ve never - I’ve never kissed anyone. And we have to kiss in front of something like two hundred people. And I think I’m going to fuc- er - screw it up.”
This is for my bday prompts, for anon, who wanted the prompt: "They hurt you." with hurt Tony and protective Steve. I don't think this is exactly what you had in mind, but this is what happened. I hope you like it! Thank you! <3
Strucker sneered. “This seems to be the only way to get rid of you, Captain. You have some blessed life that stops me from killing you, but I don’t need you dead, I just need you gone. So…” Strucker stepped forward and the four HYDRA agents restraining Steve backed him towards the cryo chamber. “Have a good nap.”
Pain clenched deep in Tony’s gut, almost dropping him back to his chair, but he locked the joints of the suit and forced himself to stay upright. His plan to do everything in his power to stay away from Steve was failing miraculously already. “Well then,” he forced out. “Show me what you’ve got.”
"I know. That's why I want both of you to be happy. Cause I love you so much. And I know you love me, and we're safe and secure. Besides, you're going to be spending a lot more of the next three months with Bucky than with me, so maybe it's a good time to feel things out. I have to go back to L.A. tomorrow anyway. You should talk to him, just the two of you. Explain everything."
Two strong arms wrapped around Tony from behind and one squeezed. The other was holding a glass of red wine. Tony took it and twisted around to get a kiss from Bucky. “Thank you, sweetheart.” Tony took his place on the couch with his wine and was soon joined by Bucky on the other end, feet tucked up and the well-worn afghan tugged over his bare legs.
"I know. Like I said, I was at Starbucks, I saw it fall out of your pocket at your table, but when I went to give it back, you were surrounded by people. I didn't want to draw attention to the fact that I had Tony Stark's wallet so I let it go. Checked weird fan twitter to see when you usually leave the office and decided to try and catch you in the lobby instead. I was a little late but I’m glad I caught you. Here."
"JARVIS! Stop!" But something he'd hit must have prevented JARVIS from listening. He kept cycling through languages at random.
Tony looked up at him. "I'm so sorry you had to do that alone. And go to the doctor alone. I'm - I'm so sorry."
And of course, Steve hadn’t changed. The cryo preserved him even more perfectly than the ice had. Once again, the world had ticked on, and Steve was left behind. The back of his eyes prickled with heat, and Steve tried to suck in enough oxygen not to pass out as terror swirled through him and tried to drag him under the surface of a budding panic attack.
“And Steve will never forgive me for murdering my brand new kitten that he got me as a very thoughtful birthday gift even though I am clearly a terrible kitten murderer who should never own a pet, ever!"
“No!” Tony grabbed at his sleeve even though Steve had shown no signs of leaving. “No. I mean, I’ll admit I wasn’t super thrilled about the idea at first, but I
“I’m really sorry, Tony. I’m so comfortable with you that I didn’t really think about how awful that was. It was so cool to meet her, but it was incredibly rude of me to ignore you. I lost track of time.” Steve rocked their hands gently between them. “Can we try again? I promise I won’t ruin it this time.”
A cloud of gas exploded from the fox and obscured everything in the room. It lined Bucky’s throat and he coughed violently, waving his hand and trying to find clear air. There was a loud creak of a window and the gas started to float out of the room.
“It’s fine, Tony. It’s not your fault.” Steve buried a kiss in Tony’s hair. It was getting a bit sweaty for him inside the too-small-for-two-people sleeping bag, but Tony was clearly still freezing, so Steve snuggled him as closely as he could and tried to radiate more heat.
Tony laughed at the old joke, then leaned in and hopped his legs around Bucky's waist. Bucky took his weight easily turning to step towards the bedroom, but a loud bang reverberated around them. "Shit! They're here. They found us." Tony dropped to the ground and wrestled a gun out of his waistband, Bucky doing the same thing on the other side. More explosions as their trailer was riddled with bullets. Tony made eye contact with Bucky. "Together?"
"I know -" Steve broke off with a gasp as one of the tentacles worked it's slick point down the curve of his ass to test the rim of his hole.
“God, Tony. Of course. Nothing I want more.” Steve nipped a kiss to the underside of Tony’s jaw then wriggled his way down the bed to settle between his legs. He pulled at Tony’s boxers, and working together they managed to get them off. Tony put his feet back on the mattress, knees folded on either side of Steve’s shoulders and breathed out heavily when Steve drew a line of hot, wet kisses up the inside of Tony’s thigh.
“I guess so.” Tony picked up his guitar and settled in front of his microphone. He couldn’t pull his eyes away as Bucky dug his bass out of his bag and hooked himself up to the amp.
Bucky led the way to another door that looked like a closet, but when he opened it, music, smoke, and laughter poured out. Steve stepped through, and it was like stepping into another world.
“Thanks for letting him play with her.” Steve looked down, and the dog had rolled onto her back, her feet hanging limply in the air while Tony cackled wildly and grabbed at her jowls. “Hey, Mike? I’d appreciate it if you’d keep it to yourself that I’m watching my nephew. I wouldn't want to draw any unwanted attention.” He gave Mike a stern look.
Steve looked back at the painting. “It can wait. I mean, it won’t ruin it if I don’t finish it now.” What was happening?
“He’s great. We’ve filled the whole house with epi-pens and he’s thrilled about outlawing peanut butter.” Steve smiled, and Tony’s heart started to pound. “You’re not easy to find, you know. I went back to the hospital a few times, but it wasn’t until I talked to one of the nurses that I figured out you’re not an ER doctor at all. You’re a specialist who happened to be passing through.”
Tony set his briefcase down by his feet and glanced around at the shop. It was mostly empty - people at this time of the morning came and went - and there was no line. “I bring this briefcase when I have an investor’s meeting and I need the extra sugar to get me through it. Glasses are if I slept in late and didn’t have time to put my contacts in. Mocha helps wake me up for some reason. On the phone at this time of morning means foreign shit which always stresses me out and it’s going to be a four espresso kind of day. First of the month I take muffins to accounting. Lainey only likes carrot. Fifteenth is my monthly review meeting with my PA. I get us both danishes. Oh and jeans means I’m in the workshop all day. Then I get what I actually like best because I’m going to have a chance to enjoy it.” He sighed. “I’m sorry I snapped. I didn’t realize I wore my schedule quite so on my sleeve. I have to worry about corporate espionage and stuff.” Tony rubbed his hand over his face.
Bruce’s mouth twisted up as he slotted the last test tube in the machine. “Boyfriend? Really? Is it that far along already?”
There was something playful and kind and - dare he say - flirty? about the guy’s voice, so Tony took a deep breath and a chance. “Coffee?”
The guard frowned. "If you have a personal relationship with Mr. Stark, you can use his private number to dial in over on the kiosk over there and get a guest badge."
“Oh yeah?” Steve shifted in his seat. “Do you - uh -” He swallowed and looked over at Tony again. His pants were tightening, thinking about what Tony might have been offering before, and he leaned forward a bit so his shirt would cover the rising bulge. “You’ve just been hitchhiking your way along? Where did you start?”
in Steve’s perfect handwriting, followed by a small cartoon drawing of a tomato. It wasn’t physically possible for Tony to love this man more.
Steve woke with a gasp, smashing his shoulder against the glass of the cryo tube. He panicked for a moment, disoriented, and then the tube opened and he tumbled out onto the floor. The tear that had frozen to his cheek finished its trail down to his jaw, and he reached to brush it away, but his arms were still cuffed behind his back. He ached from head to foot, mouth cottony, and brain muddled. The freezing seemed to have killed the shocker on the cuffs, and without that, Steve was able to brace his elbows against his sides and pull until the metal snapped and his arms released. He gasped as his shoulders protested the change, and he staggered backwards until he hit the cryo tube then stumbled to the floor. The serum pumped through his veins, healing the aches and pains, the wrench in his shoulder, and the cut across his cheek from his struggle with HYDRA.
For my bday prompt party, for anon who wanted: steve suddenly has bunny ears and a bushy bunny tail. tony really really wants to touch his tail (and maybe some other things too)
He lay there for a painful, sleepless hour before he decided it wasn’t worth it. He’d rather lie awake with Tony than be anywhere else in the world.
Tony's next cue came from the other side of the warehouse. "They've got Kathy!" he yelled, reloading his gun. "Really? Because if you were my friend, you'd tell me why you hate my boyfriend."
Tony breathed in the Avengers Tower air with a smile. It had been too long. Way too long. He dropped his bags in the elevator, trusting JARVIS to get one of the bots to take them up to the penthouse, and got off at Steve’s floor. He was thirsty and starving and knew that if he didn’t unpack now, he’d just end up buying new clothes instead, but he’d been on a plane for what felt like thirty-six consecutive hours, and he hadn’t seen his boyfriend in better resolution than a five-inch StarkPhone screen in six weeks. So right now, more than anything, Tony needed two hundred and twenty pounds of supersoldier wrapped around him. Everything else could wait.
“Fucking fantastic,” Steve moaned. “I feel like I’m going to drive off the road. All I can think about is your hot, wet mouth. It’s better than anything I’ve stuck my cock in before. It’s like you were made for this, made for me. Custom made.” That got a full body shudder from Tony. “Like a sex toy,” Steve whispered. “I wish I had something like you all the time, here in my truck, to take care of things when it gets too lonely on these long drives. God I - ah -“ Steve twisted in his seat, his hips rocking up without his permission. Tony felt so good, fucking his own face with Steve’s cock, bobbing up and down, spit dribbling down between Steve’s legs. All Steve had to do was thrust up and he could feel more of him, get that perfect, rough friction he craved.
"Alright." Steve had the audacity to look disappointed after slamming Tony into the mats more times than he could count. He turned away to cross the gym towards his water bottle then, once he had it in hand, turned back and sort of froze, staring awkwardly at Tony.
Tony watched like a man on his way to the guillotine as Steve stepped out of the elevator and approached the workshop door. He knocked, so Tony knocked back the rest of his beer before calling out, “Come in.”
At nine-forty-five, and without a single letter added to his crossword, Steve decided that if Tony couldn't go out for dinner, Steve could at least bring something down to him, maybe bask in his company for a little while. He couldn't reasonably call it anything other than basking. He groaned and ran a stiff hand over his face. Why couldn't he just man up and tell Tony why he wanted dinner to be
Tony worked his lip between his teeth. His eyes flicked away. “I guess that’s not a lie,” he muttered.
But he couldn’t focus on reading right now. All he could think about was the two men out in the snow that he cared about so much it ached, finally finding each other. It felt like the last puzzle piece of home had finally fallen into place. He knew in a few minutes they’d come stomping in, shaking snow off in the lobby. They’d sit at opposite ends of the table at dinner, trying to pretend they weren’t shooting little looks filled with an entirely different kind of hunger across the table. That night, if Steve went to see if Bucky wanted to play cards, his apartment would be suspiciously empty, and Tony’s would be firmly locked. But eventually, after some time, they’d trust Steve to tell him and he’d be able to tell them how happy it made him. Honestly, purely, right-to-his-core happy.
Wrote this for a friend who was having a rough day. Fair warning, I was utterly sloshed when I wrote it, and google's spellcheck was responsible for beta so - who knows! I wrote this a while ago and posted it on tumblr, and I'm just now getting caught up on posting it here <3
“I think I just did. See you later.” Steve pushed to his feet and walked out, leaving a stunned Tony behind.
But Tony zoned out after that, visions of Steve’s boyfriend falling off a bridge and Steve turning to Tony for comfort wandering through his mind. It wasn’t fair, he knew that, but he couldn’t help himself.
“Nope. That’s why I’m hitching my way across the country instead of stepping into my dad’s four thousand dollar, patent leather shoes.”
The only mercy was that he'd snagged a seat by one of the few outlets scattered around the gate, and though it meant he had to twist a bit to the right to keep his cable slack, it also meant that he wouldn't be reduced to watching the reruns of a cheery morning show set three states over that seemed to be playing on the TV, under an overlay of the worsening weather that had trapped him here in the first place.
Tony swallowed heavily and was shoved unceremoniously out into the sand ring. Green grins surrounded him on all sides. He tracked Steve’s steps as he crossed the other side of the colosseum. Not Steve - Cap. His opponent. His target.
Steve wrapped his arms around Tony’s neck and kissed across his bow, down his cheek, and along his jaw to his throat. “We have to start celebrating your birthday right at midnight. It’s important.”
“Shit, Tony.” Steve finally gave into the urge to spread his legs and wriggle until he was more comfortable, pants tented awkwardly. “I’m not going to make you - uh - pay me back. I’m happy to drive you, no strings attached.” But he couldn’t deny how appealing the thought was.
Tony moaned and arched up against him, making Steve's hand clench into a fist where it was held fast at his side. He tugged on Tony's fingers with his other hand. This was not how he'd envisioned their first time together. He no longer struggled, sure that it was pointless and also worried that he'd hurt Tony by mistake. And with the drug flushing through him, it was getting harder and harder to want to fight. The tentacle behind him worked its way a scant inch into his ass and a whole new collection of nerves burst to life, shocking a moan as wanton as Tony's out of his throat.
“Guess we’ll be part of the welcoming committee then. How about the… others? Do they-?” Tony’s voice trailed off, the end of his sentence lost but everyone understood what he was asking. His tone attempted to feign indifference but still failed to cover his hesitance and uncertainty.
“We have as much information as you guys, to be honest. I only received an alert from FRIDAY saying that an unidentified spacecraft had entered the Earth’s atmosphere and that they reached out to me by sending a message to one of SI’s main server.” Using his latest model of the Stark phone, he displayed a holographic screen which displayed the message he got from Bruce.
"Eliminating the stone is the only way to be certain that Thanos can't get it." Was the impassive voice of The Vision. That sucked out the energy out of everyone in the room. This early out in the war and yet they're already looking forward to losing one of them. What more, it was Vision who had to be sacrificed. The being who Tony had come to see as one of his children. Tony's heart ached painfully. He couldn't deal with losing Vision too. Not after JARVIS.
“Kind of? He said something about guests from space and that they’re friendly? Other than that, he told me nothing. He just told me to get a jet and pick you guys up.”
“Anyway, I’m here to get those upgraded arrows you promised me last week. You said they were supposed to be ready by now.”
“Hey. Any news from the panel?” The super soldier asked. The grim expressions on their faces was all the answer he needed to tell that it wasn’t good news. His frown deepened even more as Rhodes handed a manila folder to him.
Tony wants to believe that the incoming threat was what makes him so uneasy. Truthfully? A large portion of his mind tells him that it’s the fact that he’s facing them,
“The doctor said he was lucky. Three fractured ribs, few broken limbs, pneumothorax or a collapsed lung, and an aortic rupture. He was touch and go for the first few hours during surgery but he’ll pull through. It’ll take at least 3 weeks to recover. A month at most if there are more complications.” The red head said, her face were stoic but those who know her can tell that she was glad.
"Because you might have a choice. Your mind is made up of a complex construct of overlays. JARVIS, Ultron, Bruce, me, the Stone. All of them mixed together. All of them learning from one another." Tony declared, his mind swimming and gears turning. This could work. This could actually work.
