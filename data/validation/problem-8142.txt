His interview is only at 08:00. It’s too early to get himself ready, so Steve stands up and passes a tank top through his head. He’s going to his daily morning run, a habit he can’t let go of since the military. It helped Steve clear his mind back then, and hopefully, it still does.
"Tony, are you alright?" Tony nods affirmatively, and Steve notices the billionaire's shoulders starting to relax under his touch."Nightmare?"
"Fuck!" Steve says, throwing the bottle in the garbage can, the other hand on his chest in an attempted to appease himself from the scare.
"Well, Natasha will cheer up, for sure. She probably will say something like
"Clean energy."
“Wow!” Tony said when they pulled away. “I like it. You should do it more often.”
What did he have to lose? The worst that could happen was if no one liked him, or people were mean and treated him badly. Wanda said that everyone was cool, and the people he had worked with today were all polite to him. There’s no need to hesitate this much, but Steve couldn’t stop wondering what would people think of him?
Tony looks down to his own Time GPS on his arm, showing random numbers, it looks like it also was damaged, this he could fix it, he didn't want to. Tony smiles, and Steve follows his gaze. The blond opens his mouth, but Tony cuts him off.
His phone chimes on the table and Steve takes it, seeing that Peggy, Bucky’s almost fiancée, liked his last picture and commented on a ‘nice shot’. Well, if it wasn’t for Peggy, they certainly would be at the bottom of the well.
"You're okay?" Steve whispers close to him.
"Well, the owner and her niece. The movie's name is Pound, it seems nice for what they talked about." Steve nods. "Did you know that owner's niece has a crush on you? She asked me if you were single." Steve lifts his brows surprised, and Tony is smiling as if he thinks it is an amusing situation, which it is.
Steve raised a brow, surprised, and he realized that he hadn’t checked his e-mail today.
"I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that." Steve sighs, reaching out for Tony's hand. "I wasn't thinking. I'm stupid." A shadow of a smile appears on his lips and Tony can't hold his own.
Tony slides his hands into Steve's pants, touching the blond's hardened member, circling his thumb around the head of his cock. A drop of pre-cum sliding through his fingers, when Tony massages his cock, teasing the captain.
"I found this in our kitchen counter." Tony hands the folder to Steve. "Hydra is doing experiments in humans, modifying their DNA to enhance them, and apparently, working in human cloning."
“Are you going to the party tonight?” the woman, red-haired, asked the blond.
His hands are gentle, cleaning the brunet's stomach, then his inner tights and Steve's seed coming out of his ass.
"I want you, Steve." Tony wasn't innocent. Tony Stark wasn't innocent at all when it comes to sex, but he never ever actually did it, even though he had played around with some guys that he used to know in parties, he never went that far, just some blow jobs at most. But with Steve he wanted everything and he'd never been so sure about anything in his life.
Tony nods still feeling the thick lump of his throat, his mouth dry with angst. He tries to convince himself that Steve was right, they did what had to, HYDRA was a bad organization after all. Steve has been frozen seventy years ago trying to defeat them. His parents were killed because HYDRA had brainwashed and made Bucky Barnes a weapon, they created Project Insight and they were willing to kill thousands of innocent people. Steve is right.
Crossing the crowd seemed almost impossible, but Pietro made it easy while Steve stopped a few times to not get hit on the chin or nose with so many elbows and hands swinging in the air. They made it. Pietro got to the bar in the first place, and Steve saw Wanda talking to Clint. Yeah, Clint, Steve thought that was the guy’s name.
So, Steve rushed against the crowd direction, pushing people the way down to the bank. His heart pounding hard inside his chest,
Tony slides a hand inside his pocket to feel the four particles, they weren't broken, at least not yet. He sighs, and he is not sure if it is because he is relieved, although there is nothing to be relieved, or if it is just because he is tired. Deep down inside him, he's done with fighting.
“I appreciate it.”
"Thank you," Tony says, keeping his eyes shut just feeling the wind on his face, that's so peaceful and calmly, and Tony just wishes that he could stop the world in this moment, because nothing could be more perfect than this, he knew it from the bottom of his heart.
Steve looks to his husband and their daughter, he couldn’t be any happier to have this amazing family. Morgan had joined them six months ago, when they finally had all of the documents to proceed with the adoption. Before that, they have been knowing Morgan for two months, she was a smart girl which both parents had died in a fire that hit a hotel in New York when she was only three years old, she had no others relatives alive, so she was sent to a foster care system where she has spent the last two years until Tony and Steve find her. As they said, she is a smart girl, so it wasn’t complicated to explain to her that she would have two dads. Well, kids don’t care about it, she was just happy that she would have a family. So here they are, eight months later.
Steve was the one who took most, he told Tony about his family, his parents, his childhood as a sick and scrawny kid in Brooklyn, he also talks about the war for the very first time since Steve had woken from the ice. He trusts Tony and he felt comfortable to open up to him, as the brunet has already done so many times, he confides his fears and his insecurities, being certain that Tony supports him, and for the first time none of them felt alone anymore. They could lean on each other, because if they have each other then they'll be fine.
Hey. I hope you enjoy it.
"I guess we should go somewhere safe." Steve agrees while keeping a genuine smile on his face.
Once the cab driver drops them near to their destination, Tony acts as planned. He passes through security with no further problems, his technology for the badge is pretty persuasive for old-fashioned eyes, Tony brags.
Not exactly a kink, but I wanted to write it anyway.
“Do you want to come over for dinner?” He blurted out. Tony shifted to look at him. “I mean if you want to. It’s nothing big. My friend Peggy, she’s going to marry my best friend, Bucky. Uh. We always have dinner together on Thanksgiving, so… I can pick you up if you want to.”
"I'd say sexy, but unexpected suits too." Tony teases making Steve laughs.
"That's not true. I like the movie, too, Tony." The genius raised a brow doubly. "Okay. I can say that I also appreciated that you held my hand, although I'd prefer to kiss you." Tony's smile fade, and Steve knew immediately that he had said something wrong.
Steve reaches out for the brunet's hand, ready and eager for making the travel back to San Francisco.
He needs to know the truth before surrender completely, he needed to know if Steve really loves him as he does love Steve. He felt insecure and exposed, but it was okay, because there was only him and Steve in that room, and he wasn't afraid of showing his weakness to the blond. His heart was already broken since Germany.
"No, you didn't! You do what you think is right, Tony. You're suicidal!" Steve yells, but he is not finished yet. "You don't know how to work in a team. You could've gotten yourself killed."
He turns to meet Steve's gaze before nods his head agreeing with the blond, Tony takes a deep breath, standing up and going into the small table's direction, he takes the aid kit and turns back to the supersoldier.
"Tony, are you okay? What's in your head?" The genius opened his mouth to answer, there are a lot of things he could say to Steve. He could tell him how much he was panicking with all of this happening, how he was the biggest problem in the team, because Tony is so reckless and selfish. Though, it wasn't Steve's problem, and right now he couldn't be a burden to Steve, because it was him who put the blond in this situation and he has to fix it. The blond shouldn't have to handle Tony either, he shouldn't have to comfort him, so instead, Tony sighed.
They got in the store where quickly a salesman comes to greet them and offer for help, in case, they needed it, wich Tony immediately thank and decline, turning to the closest clothing rail to check the clothes. God, Steve had just remembered that it would come from Tony's watch money and he hated the thought of Tony paying things all on his own.
"You need--" Steve cuts him off.
Behind Steve, Tony notices the two guys who were fighting Steve, one of them was unconscious and had a bleed nose, the other one was tied to a shelf with a black eyes, probably broken ribs.
He seems familiar, Tony thought. His coat is too big for him, he looks nervous but at the same too agitated, the way he talks reminds him of Peter, the spiderboy. That's it. The boy looks like Peter. A pinch of pain crosses his chest. Peter that died in his arms.
"You need to rest"
It's all that he says before his attention comes back to the sketch, and Tony noticed that Steve is wearing a dark blue boxers while he is still naked on the bed.
“Yep.”
"Okay, then. I don't deserve you, you know that, right?" Tony says leaning to drop a kiss on those soft lips that only that supersoldier owned. Steve's lips curled up to the gest in an amused smirk before he looks at Tony in the eyes, getting all serious.
Last weekend, Peggy was asking Steve’s advice for the flowers when Tony called him, inviting him to Stark Tower for dinner. Steve loves to spend time with Tony, so his answer was easy. At first, he showed Steve some of his creations in the lab, apologizing for his excitement, even though Steve loved to see Tony’s grin, and his happiness every time he was talking about his projects. So, after a few glasses of wine, they ended up cuddling on the couch.
It's a simple and silly plan, they both knew it is going to work, the main concern for them was dealing with Hydra, supposing that they would break in the building.
He traces nonsense lines on the blond's skin, feeling the warmth under his fingers. Tony lets his body relax against Steve's. The supersoldier's jaw setting on the top of his head.
The morning light is shining through the window next to the bed, which makes Steve's hair even more blonde, illuminating his face and his blue eyes, it looks like Steve has a bright aura around him. It's beautiful and pure.
“So are you enjoying the job so far?” Clint asked, pulling Steve out of his thoughts. The soldier blinked, then took the seat where Wanda was just a few minutes ago.
Steve kisses Tony's thigh, making the billionaire shivers, then he positions himself in Tony's entrance, rubbing his dick provocatively in his entrance.
"How do you know?"
Steve turned around, making space for Tony to come forward.
"Tony," he says. "We will come back, there is nothing to worry about. I know I'm saying this right now and I'm not trying to play the optimistic. I need you to trust me, because I trust you and I'm sure we will find a solution together, we're already working on it! " Steve says with a kind smile. "I also know you too well to know that tomorrow morning you will still be worried." The super soldier sighed. "This is not your fault. We knew the risks and we decided to accept them. We made this together."
There is not much to look around, families were having lunch, restaurants were completely full, kids were running around, couples were walking hand in hand. The sun was high and bright in the sky, that's definitely what summer season is supposed to be. Steve never really enjoyed summer, being a sick kid meant staying home all day. Sometimes, some days, he used to sit on the stairs in front of the house and sketch the other kids playing around, and then his mother called him in because the dust wasn't good for his asthma. Though, the summer season was definitely his best healthy days.
Steve passes right next to him to reach the sink and wash his plate and mug. He dries his hands on the towel hanging next to the sink.
Steve enters the office right behind her. Nothing had changed since the last time he came here. Natasha does not seem to be fond of decoration or personal items in her workplace, so there wasn’t much he could tell about the woman. The place was neutral, as neutral as her countenance when she pulled away from a few papers on her desk, sitting at its border.
"Let's go, Nat."
"Okay, lemme make it shorter, then." Tony interfered. "Capsicle here," He points to Steve. "Stay stuck in the ice for over 70 years, he was found and awaken in 2011, where he fought for SHIELD, joined the avengers when we fought aliens coming from outer space, a lot of others less important fights too, and here we are trying to defeat or stop, I don't even know anymore, another villain from outer space. But I fucked everything it up and we are trapped in the '70s.!" Tony let everything out at once and inhales deeply attempting to recover his breath.
“I hope you see more around here, Steve,” she said with a grin, then winked.
Tony looks back to Hank.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve holds his hand, leaning to kiss it.
Steve pulls over the car in front of the garage and takes his phones to check if there are any messages, nothing, in the background the radio starts to play a modern punk song, which makes the blond smiles and rolls his eyes. He turns it off before step out of the car and take the groceries in the trunk. It was a bit later in the night, probably 9:30 p.m., well he doesn’t usually get that late at home, but when he realized the grocery was almost empty he had to go to the supermarket, otherwise, no breakfast in the morning.
“It’s a personal issue, Nat,” Pepper insisted. “He’s been through a lot of things right now.” Natasha sighed longly.
She looked around, Bruce was nowhere to be seen what made her wonder if her friends had come back. She grabbed the empty coffee mug and headed to the kitchen.
"The woman in the elevator, she called security when I was coming out," Steve affirms. A light seems to turn on inside of Tony's mind, like the mention of the woman had awakened something, a light of recognition crosses his eyes.
Thank you for reading!
“I’m happy for you, Tony,” Steve said, brushing his fingers against Tony’s hand slightly. Tony gave Steve the cutest smile the blond had ever seen. “I’m glad you took this decision for yourself.”
“Miss Potts, I’m sure Miss Romanoff will be glad in seeing you if you wait a little longer,” the receptionist said, following behind said woman.
His muscles burn before the effort he’s doing, pushing himself beyond his own limits, sweat is dripping from his air, and his tank top is getting soaked quickly. Steve was a faster runner in the military, and he’s glad that his rhythm seems to be the same. He focuses on the burning on his calf, trying to push away the memories brought up by the nightmare. He shut his eyes to just feel the cold air of the morning on his face, making it easier to breathe. Steve wondered if someday he would be able to get a proper night of sleep.
Steve opened his mouth to say something. Anything. But the words never made it out. Was it really happening? It all seems a dream, a really really good dream, the best he has had in ages. Steve’s mouth was slightly opened in surprise as he watched Natasha walking away.
"It's okay. I just..." Tony pauses. "...didn't know that the Captain was into boys."
"It's fine, Tony. I'm a gay guy from the forties, I get it better than anyone." Tony gives him a weak smile. "Let's go." He points the direction with his head, so Tony follows him.
Then, Tony woke up with an idea, something that would be really helpful later. Pym Technologies's floor plan. The original one, with all the hide entry and labs, because obviously, Hank Pym wouldn't put the Pym particles in the showcase, there must be a hidden lab somewhere in the building.
Tony touches his glasses twice.
"I guess we've got a problem, then" Tony starts tapping on the table again.
Steve repeats for the hundredth time since last night when they arrived at the hotel, this does not make Tony feels any better, it was him who made that bomb, all the deaths and injured's weight was on his back. He had broken a promise he has done to himself, and he was feeling the consequences of it. Tony passes his fingers through his hair.
Chapter 11 is almost done, too!
"How do we gonna do it, then, genius?" Steve teases, which makes Tony's lips curled upward. "It's a 44 hours trip."
Tony stays on the corner of the hallway watching scientists, interns, and staff people doing their daily and boring activities in their respective departments. Some interns pass by talking about a lecture scheduled for today, so Tony was right, there is a scientific event occurring in the hall, as well as Hydra agents looking around for them.
“Huh-huh, sorry, I don’t drink,” Tony said when Bucky moved to fill it.
He did not want to face all the staff again, and Wanda, and Natasha, who also witness his anxiety attack, but he knew he had to. It was one of the days to cope. He needed to face it, no matter how scared or shameful he felt. If he wanted to overcome it, this was something he needed to do. The fact that Tony was holding his hand and standing there by his side turns it a little bit easier. Tony would be there, right? In case, he needed someone to lean on again.
“Good. Everyone’s here,” Peggy says, straightening her dark blue skirt.
“Hi you again,” she greeted. “The models are almost drooling on you,” Wanda stated, making Steve raise his eyes from the camera he just got. It was true, a blonde and a brunette are whispering and glancing at him, as well as some of the other women in the room. Steve blushed.
Steve blinks and his gaze turns to Tony, dodging a running girl holding a teddy bear, and caressing a boy head, he smiles at the sight. Tony would be a good father, he knew for sure for the way he talked about Peter the day before, he cares about the boy and Steve could see clearly now that the teenage also sees Tony as a father figure.
"We need to go," Steve says from the doorway. Tony nods, holding the bomb safely inside of his jacket.
"You'll not get away from this," Pierce smirks.
“I’m considering it,” Steve retorted, then Wanda started talking again.
It couldn't be happening, there is no way that he would leave Steve behind.
He was coping badly. He should not feel that way. He has been to every appointment with dr. Banner, he had talked about everything that had happened on the battlefield, so why was he reacting so badly to a goddamn light bulb explosion? He should do better. It’s been almost eight months. However, the nightmares, the cold sweat, the way he jumped with any sudden noise or flash of light, were still there. No matter how hard Steve fights it.
He feels his eyes watery and he decides to shut it. He couldn't imagine what this man must have done to Steve to talk. He must have tortured him. This simple thought makes Tony's chest clenches in distress.
Steve acquiesces.
He hears the guards steps outside the door, then he turns on his heels and sees the corridor empty. That's his call. He exits the office and moves fast to the elevator. Thankfully, it's empty and it goes like this all the way up. Steve finds himself back in the ground, the midday light blinds him for a second, till he puts the mirrored glasses back on. He moves to the corner where they came from and waits for Tony. He appears a few minutes later carrying a briefcase and talking with Howard Stark, his own father.
However, the brunet didn't take long in that apprehensive state, he woke up and got up in jolt and sitting at the edge of the bed, his breath was heavy and shaky. He ran his fingers through his hair while attempted to regularize his breath. Tony was having an anxiety attack. The blond knew about Tony's PTSD, but he never really has been present to witness one of his crises. Certainly, because Tony spent most of his time in his lab, it was this way in the Avengers Tower and he kept that habit when they had moved to the Avengers Compound.
Loki decided to play with the Captain of the Avengers. He cast a spell at him. Steve has two hours to be fuck, otherwise, he dies.
situation.
Tony thinks.
They appeared in the Army Base laundromat. It was empty, for their luck, because two men coming from nowhere would scare anyone, it also would be a hell of weird since one of them was wearing a SHIELD security modern uniform and the other, the Captain America's suit and shield.
"You know what? I'm going to buy it." Tony affirms determined, taking Steve out of his thoughts.
Thank you for reading.
"It's a cute movie. I like it. I guess you won't be able to tell me your opinion since you didn't stop staring at me the whole movie. You were almost drooling." Tony said smirking sassily. Steve frowns, but eventually, he rolled his eyes, impossible to hold his smile for longer
However, the blood is quick by his side, holding him up and putting him under the shower. The cold water hit him while he still has his clothes on and he swears against everything. Steve helps him to take his clothes off and bath.
"Trust me..." Steve sucks his neck, leaving a beautiful and red hickey on it. "I do." Tony finishes. "Get off of these clothes." The billionaire complains, bossy as always.
I'm currently writing chapter 5, and I'm surprised by the number of words. Anyway, stay tuned.
That report she wrote for S.H.I.E.L.D. years ago was wrong, it means nothing, because Tony is one of the best human beings in the world. She couldn't see it before, but now, she would remember him. If he was really stuck, he and Steve, she would make sure the world remembers them as the purest and kindest heroes. She owes them that. She owes it to Tony.
"You wouldn't see it." The billionaire replies, pushing away the sand with his foot, Steve hears a metallic sound. "Find it," Tony shouts.
Everything looks exactly the same. The same old building with the painting chipping, and the ugly garden in front of it, the lawn maintenance is nonexistent here. Tony makes his way to the apartment, he rolls the knob to find the door opened, he is unarmed but he got in without hesitate. Strangely, everything looks in its place, Tony verify every room making sure that the apartment is empty, whoever broke in did not care to take anything out of place.
Steve opens his mouth, but... To say what? Tony’s too far from him, and the Omega looked away before he could’ve warned him. Tony smiles at the man and they toast. A malicious smile tugging on the corner of the man’s lips. Steve swore under his breath that he would make the Alpha swallow all those teeth if he did any harm to Tony.
“‘Kay. I mean, she’s your ex, isn’t she? And she’s dating your driver, so are you okay with this?”
"You're ready?" He asks putting the low-pulled cap and mirrored sunglasses he had just found. Tony nods, takes his own clothes, and hides it, so when they finally get the tesseract and the Pym particles they could get their clothes back and go back to 2023.
Since Steve came back home six months ago, he’s been diagnosed with PTSD - post-traumatic stress disorder -, which was not surprising at all. He had heard of a lot of cases during his time in the Army, but Steve wanted to serve and he just had to get his chance, so he would fulfill it happily. Bucky was diagnosed one year ago as well since he came back before Steve. He was in therapy longer than Steve, so he coped better with nightmares than Steve did. The blond was also in therapy in the last three months. He finally decided to follow it after Bucky scolds him so many times for not getting help before. So, Steve was learning to deal with his PTSD, as well as Bucky, although Bucky has also been coping with phantom limb syndrome.
"Did you know that the Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl crossed the Atlantic on a raft in 57 days?" Steve says while pointing the news on the paper, he's trying to make conversation, so Tony nods negatively before start to serve himself while Steve follows him doing the same.
“‘kay. Listen. There’s a huge event today, it’s beneficial to help war veterans. Anyway, the photographer Maria hired got sick. He can’t come, and you’re the only person I can think of, plus your pics are better, so, could you come over, replace him, and save this whole event?” Steve wanted to laugh at the tone Sam used, pleading with him to save them all.
“Hammer Industries, what did you expect?” Tony shrugged, giving it back to the intern.
The hours pass by, the crow dissipates, people leaving the bar to head home or to another party, like he used to do a long time ago. Tony glances at the clock standing on the wall in front of him, above the shelf filled with all sorts of alcoholic drinks. It's half past midnight, which means that they have officially five days left until Hank Pym comes back from his international trip. Five days to go back home.
"Want a better version, Cap? Tell her your fucking extend version, then, it's not like we don't have anything to do today." He clenches his teeth. "You know what? Maybe, you want to stay here, right? You just found what you've been regretting these past 11 years. That's it. Go ahead, Captain America." Tony stands his hands up and turns on his heels leaving the place.
"You're alright?" Tony says, approaching Steve.
Tony blinks, unable to turn his gaze to where the light comes, the philanthropist raises his arm to block the light from his camp of sight, on the other hand, Steve's eyes quickly adjusted to the light, and he spots two police officers, the first holding the flashlight is short and overweight, the second seems pretty young and apparently, new and unfamiliar to his jobs duties.
“Okay, then,” Steve said, raising his hands in a gesture of surrender. “So what are your plans for tonight, then?” he asked curiously. In his heart, Steve was happy that Tony wasn’t just using him. He was not a nightstand like he had thought at first, and that was great. Wonderful, really.
"You said it would take 10 seconds," Natasha says accusingly. "What went wrong?"
See y'all next week.
"I know," Tony nods. "You need to go to a hospital."
"Morning, you too." Steve twitched his nose. "Are you feeling better?" Tony rolls his eyes in response and gets up.
“Huh, I don’t think so. I’m going to Peggy’s after work.”
"T-Tony" Steve's voice comes out shaky, attempting to muffle a moan.
Tony grins, and tiptoeing he leans against Steve's body, sealing their lips together on a gentle and passionate kiss once more.
The next chapter has 7K words, bigger than this one.
Tony closes the door, then he walks in the kitchen's direction leaning on the doorway, observing Steve takes a bottle of water out of the fridge and drinking directly from it.
Tony gets up approaching the man while Steve finishes untying himself. The brunet puts his hand on the doctor's neck still feeling the pulsation under his fingers. Good, he's not dead, just unconscious. He lets out a sigh of relief.
Steve called him suicidal, and maybe the blond was right, he has been playing the hero a long time now and where it leads him? To more death from innocent people, but not his own, because apparently Tony should suffer, grief and mourn all those deaths, he should watch and pay for each one. And this time his burden was heavier, it was half of the universe, because he failed one more time.
“So beautiful, Tony,” Steve says, a drop of sweat rolling down Tony’s hairline, and Steve leaned in to catch the Omega’s lips in a dominant, passionate kiss, exploring Tony’s mouth with his tongue, closing his hand around Tony’s cock, which makes the Omega’s back arches as Steve’s steady hand pumps his aching, reddened cock, his thumb spreading the drop of pre-cum on the cockhead.
Tony takes the cereal from the counter putting some in a bowl, and he opens the fridge to reach for the milk, he adds it to the bowl, throwing away when he pours the last milk. Then, he gets the thermos and pours coffee in a white and graceless mug. He misses his mugs collection, they're certainly much funnier than this one. He smiles thinking about the Avengers' mugs collection he has at home.
"I'm fucking great." He whispers when Steve reaches him, his arms wrapped around his body.
Steve approaches to see what looks a door leading it to the underground, there's a device on it. Tony knelt typing a number code on it, there's a click coming from the door, and Tony pulls it up. Steve sees a stair leading below, Tony got in already going down.
Steve follows the brunet to the exit, he looks both sides before crossing the street, they haven't talked about the kiss yet, and Steve was starting to worry that maybe he had pushed too hard, the adrenaline rushing through his veins didn't make him thinking straight, maybe he went too far. He couldn't know none of this, he had to ask Tony about what happened, does that kiss mean something? He couldn't deny that he was afraid of knowing the answer. All of these thoughts were growing roots inside of his head, making him feel so insecure.
"I can sleep on the couch." He says. Tony pushes out of the blond's wrap and he looks around the apartment, his looks falls on the double bed and he turns with an incredulous look to Steve.
“Yeah. Sure. Why would I not be?”
"Yeah, sort of I am." Tony shrugs, but he's smiling. Steve leans down to kiss his forehead.
Tony and Steve look around the laundromat, the wash machines working in a unison and noise sound. It was dark there, but some flashes of morning light bathed the place, in the deep part of the laundromat they could see some dry clothes hanging in there.
His eyes fell on the red-haired, it was her. Natasha Romanoff. The woman Bucky told him about, the one he had given Steve’s number for a job opportunity. Steve aligned himself to take the pictures, the flash lightning the group’s face and making Natasha’s hair burn red on the pic.
“I’m not gonna clean it, that’s your fault, soldier,” the dark-haired stated, reaching out to get his shirt on the couch.
Steve got in the kitchen to find the lunch already set on the small table, Tony had insisted on cooking just to prove that he could prepare a meal by himself, the pan was still at the same place it fell while Tony was drying the floor, the smell of burn came from a kitchen towel half burn next to the pan.
Then, she frowns at the sight of a book on the desk, she doesn't remember to buy anything, this one looks pretty old and used, though. She sits on the bed pulling the book from the desk, which makes some pencils fall on the carpet, she passes her hand over the red cover making the remnants of dust flew in the air and dance beautifully on the sunlight.
With the agent on top of him, Tony moves his knee up hitting him on the stomach, the man groans in pain and closes his hands around Tony's neck. Tony's eyes widened while he gasps for air, his hands moving on the floor looking for something, anything to hit the guy. Tony's hand closes around a piece of glass that cut his own palm, but he ignores the pain raising the glass and hitting the Hydra agent on the neck.
"I-I think I'm falling in love with Rogers." The words slip out before it's too late to take them back. Natasha smiles widened, she is really having much fun in this whole
"Y-yes, sir. T-thank you." The boy stutters and his gaze turns to the door where the ginger guy is leaving the store. Steve followed his gaze and things started making sense inside his head, he should remember himself he was in the 70s, rights and thoughts on LGBT people were very different, full of prejudices.
“Wait,” Steve said all of sudden, which surprised even himself. “The new photoshoot, it says here ‘The pictures taken must be edited in a computer inside of the SHIELD Clothing establishment’, so it means…”
He wanted, at least, to try drawing something since sleep seems something unreachable right now, Steve points the pencil to the paper, but he is out of ideas, he starts to draft a line carefreely, he has no idea how much time has passed, he ended up with a paper covered in nonsense lines that means nothing, it's not even a draw, just some scribbles. He looks at the clock to realize it's 4:50, the sun will be raise soon.
"Yes, it was."Tony mumbles, hiding his face on Steve's arm, snuggling by his side, which Steve happily accepts while caressing his dark hair and dropping a smooth kiss on the top of it.
“Yes.”
We're close to the end, and I'm happy to announce that this story is officially complete. I'll post it regularly now.
"What do you think, guys? Let's teach him a lesson, huh?" The one who tried punch him said. "Freak."
His tongue playing with Tony’s sensitive nipples, pulling out a moan from the needy Omega. He trailed his thumb on Tony’s bottom lip, letting out a groan of satisfaction when the Omega licks his thumb, and his hands fastly unbuttoned Steve’s shirt, throwing it on the floor next to the bed.
Thank you for reading. This work will be updated on Thrusdays.
The bomb explodes, throwing everyone in the lab backward.
“Dad was telling me how the Avengers won!” replied Morgan excited. She seems too agitated for someone who should be sleeping.
Tony nods.
Tony was dragged out of his thoughts when he heard the bathroom lock switched off, revealing a supersoldier shirtless, exhibiting his amazing chest and muscles, wearing the military pants from yesterday with his blond gold hair wet, drops falling from his forehead.
Steve nods silently, but Tony can see that he still did not accept this idea, he feels like they should act and stop it right now.
The man's eyes widened surprised and in horror when the blood starts to wet his shirt, Tony pushes him up taking the weight out of him while the man grunts on the floor, incapable of moving and probably dead in a few minutes.
Pierce puts his hand inside of the left pocket taking out a keychain with more than ten keys. Tony takes it, asking which one opens the door of the room they are in, and which one opens the room Steve was, the man answers reluctantly. Then, Tony puts the keys inside of his jacket. He keeps holding the blade high while he walks to the door.

Steve entered the convenience store while Tony filled the
A group of students get out of a lab making their way to the elevator. When the doors close Tony knows that they need to act fast before anyone sees them or Hank comes back from his little discussion with whoever professor Evans is.
"Let's talk somewhere private."
Guiltiness is eating him alive. He shouldn't have yelled with Tony, and now he can't sleep. The sight of Tony's body covered in bruises just makes him feel more guilty. He was nervous and angry at Tony for putting his life at risk, because he loves the brunet so much that he couldn't handle the mere thought of Tony being dead. Every time, every time, they were on a battlefield and Tony gets hurt or almost dead, Steve felt like his asthma came back, he just couldn't breathe anymore.
After Tony snaps his fingers, everyone thought he would die, he thought himself that he would die, like Banner said no one could handle that amount of gamma radiation. But he didn’t die, surprisingly.
Well, downtown showed itself crowded. Families walking happily on the sidewalks, stores are fulls, there was a large queue to the ice cream truck. Tony looks around the street looking for a pawnshop that we had in the hotel's map of the city, and catch a glance at one right around the corner.
Tony reacts, leading Steve through the hallways while he groans in pain. This is his fault, Tony blames himself, he shouldn't have been so reckless, but at the same time, he knew he needed to do something. Tony shakes his head trying to push away his thoughts, he needs to focus on getting out of the warehouse while the Hydra agents were running to the place of the explosion.
"Me too." She tiptoes, a gentle smile on her face, and drops a kiss on the blond's left cheek. "Goodbye, Steve." She steps on the car, she doesn't glance back to him, and he watches the car disappears down in the road.
Steve nods following his train of thought. They don't have answers, not yet, at least, but they are sure that Hydra will chase them and they must be planning something for tomorrow when Steve and Tony break in Pym Technologies, so they must be ready for whatsoever is coming.
Steve shrugs.
Steve locks those blue eyes on him.
They had a plan since Steve and Tony were almost caught like intruders the last time. First, they would be apart, Tony would break in Pym's lab to seek for any clue of how they could find the scientist as soon as possible, so they would be able to get their asses back to 2023 and avenger the Earth. No, not only the Earth, the whole fuck universe.
"Tony. Tony!" The blood pounds loud in his eyes making the shouts fade away on his way to the door. He didn't look back.
You want to know
“You have me, too, now,” Tony said, his voice sounding hoarse from the cold.
Steve splashes water on his face, wiping off the barber cream and taking a good looking to the mirror in the bathroom, he passes his hand on it feeling the soft skin. Then, he smelled something burn right after a pan fell on the floor doing a disturbing and metallic noise.
"What is that about, Nat?" Rhodey was the first to talk.
Love wasn’t for her. What Natasha praised most was power.
It was easier than he thought, it looks like Hank Pym doesn't expect information to be stolen, otherwise, he needed to improve security fast.
“Stevie, please,” Bucky whimpered, pushing his ass back against Steve’s cock.
"What's so funny?" He asks twitching his nose, he doesn't look up at Natasha, he doesn't want to see her face mocking at him.
Tony looks down checking himself.
Steve turns his back looking for an empty room, he spots the next, the room was dark and it seems empty, without second-guessing, he slides in the room. He closes the door behind him and moves forward to the desk in the room, there was a notebook, some documents with SHIELD ensign, a couple of pens and a frame with a black and white picture of him, in the early forties when he got in the army, received the serum, and fought in the World War II. Steve frowned his brows and turned to look at the name on the office's door.
There was nothing else that they could do in New Jersey, they already had the Tesseract, the only thing missing was the Pym particles, so their next destiny is San Francisco, where Pym Technologies was settled, which also means that they have a forty-four hours road trip ahead.
Steve is just a few steps from him when Tony noticed two men entering the aisle, one of them leads his hand to his hips ready to pull out a gun, in the next moment before Tony blinks again Steve has the guy on the floor.
The blond looks at his boyfriend. Boyfriend? Was that the right term? Steve wasn’t sure if he could call Tony that.
“Oh, I guess it’s my turn, then,” Peggy tucked her hair behind the ear. “I’m thankful for the success and attention my restaurant is receiving. I’m thankful for my new-born niece, Sharon. And I’m thankful that I’m going to marry this man.” Peggy points to Bucky, and everyone laughs. “Okay, okay. Tony, you want to continue?”
Tony stood up with difficulty. He might have a concussion since everything was spinning around him, and his sense of balance was completely useless by now. He puts himself straight, his eyes never leaving the man in front of him.
The snack bar Steve takes them is not so far from the Army Base, and it still opens. The front of the store has an old charm, and it changed considerably since the last time Steve has been there, it seems, of course, more modern than in 1941.
"I'm Thomas Pierce. I'm sure you'll know how to find him." That's all the man says before hanging up.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony pushes himself out of Steve's hug to look at his face. A brow lifted questioning.
"Let's kick his ass."
Steve doesn’t even listen to his friends’ footsteps when they come into the room, he was too focused on making the man bleed, he’s too aggressive to even notice that the man passed out. His instincts tell him that it was right, that he's just protecting his mate. It took Thor and Bruce to get Steve off the man, which requires Thor to hold Steve tightly to allow Natasha and Clint to take the body outside, alive, breathing, while Natasha handcuffs the pervert Alpha.
“I don’t know,” Steve confesses. “We’ve been going out.”
"I have to handle this, Potts. Wait here, I'll be back in a minute, I still want to show you our new generator." Hanks pats Tony's back and leaves following the student.
"What you did was completely reckless. Run into the man who has a gun aimed at you! Are you out of your mind?" Steve says too harshly.
Steve waved goodbye to the members of the team going out for lunch until there were just him and Wanda in the studio. Even though the red-haired had turned off the lights, the window allowed a good illumination for them to organize the stuff. Wanda waited patiently for Steve as he got to clean the lens he would use later.
everything about him.
“He can’t do it now, Nat. Give him two weeks and I’ll get him back,” Pepper almost begged.
"I don't think I'm going anywhere, Tony." Steve raises his arm to show his time GPS completely destroyed due to the impact of the explosion when he was thrown backward.
The supersoldier crosses the street the buy two bottles of water for them. They were lucky to get out in a street full of restaurants and snacks bar, and close to the beach. When Steve comes back, Tony is already recovering his breath, inhaling and exhaling deeply. Of course, when he ran he didn't think about Tony's heart condition, although, he should have to, he only thought about getting rid of the two officers. Now, seeing Tony panting that way, he couldn't hide the concern on his face.
"Yeah. Morning." He replies heading to the bathroom.
"Good, you?" Steve replies standing upright, and Tony turns around to face him. Steve's blond hair is sticking on his forehead due to his sweat, his lips are dry and parted. He smells to sex, just like Tony, and he thinks that's so hot.
When Tony steps out of the Avengers' compound that day, after Ultron, Steve said he would miss him, and he really did, but he knew that Tony was okay, the billionaire visited them once in a while. Everything was fine, and then the accords happened. It took away their peace, and that stupid secret made him fight against Tony, Tony might have forgiven him, but Steve knew that he wasn't ready to forgive himself for that damage that he caused to Tony.
"Yay!" Tony celebrated, taking the project, and leaving the office.
The man smirks like he had just reached his objective, everything happens fast, the man took something to his mouth, before any of them can stop him.
"Fuck!" Steve's hand turns into a fist, Tony startles when the supersoldier punches the table.
Anyway, he couldn’t wait much longer. That was the first real job he was getting after being back from the Army. The first real interaction with people after six months of contact only with Bucky and Peggy, mostly. It was normal to be nervous to meet new people, he just couldn’t let it take over him. He was in the field again. A different, and less dangerous one, but it still had its battles to win.
Steve smiled. They knew each other too well that even when communication failed they would know each other's move. That's something good for their relationship, being predictable, even better for the battlefield.
"No. I'd get supplies in the morning, but then you arrived and we got distracted with this," Steve replied folding the floor plan. "There is a grocery store down the avenue."
She throws the mug in the sink and walk to the living room. It's weird that her last memory from this room was that she was agreeing with Tony for the accords, the Civil War wasn't exactly a happy memory, it was in this moment that everything seems to go to shit.
That's a lot to think about, Tony's life is full of
She keeps her green eyes fixed on him for a moment, she dodges it when she feels her eyes watery. She shrugs as an answer to Bruce's question.
Wait, did Steve just make Tony Stark blushes? He surely deserves a prize for it. It should be a challenge among the avengers, how to make Tony Stark blushes? Natasha would love it, looking for many ways of embarrassing the brunet. It'd be fun. Steve smiles at this thought.
“I’ll get an Uber with Pietro. You can come with us.”
“See you,” Steve mumbled to himself.
"By the way," Steve starts saying, Tony turns to look at him from the doorway. "It's 08:30 a.m. Better hurry up if we want to catch breakfast." The brunet doesn't reply, he closes the door, and Steve just heard the water running inside.
"Thank you." Tony blushes slightly, biting a toast that Steve had just put in front of him.
Anyway, it’s been a long time since Steve’s last paint, and he missed it a lot. But the thing is he just can’t find the inspiration right now, instead, he photographed and hoped to get a job soon. His concern now is to get some sleep, he will have a long day tomorrow. Steve tugged himself under the sheets, and he’s snoring softly in a few minutes.
“Steve Rogers,” the woman completed for him. “I know. I’m aware. Ms. Romanoff will see you soon. You can wait there,” she pointed to a place where benches were placed along with plants in the hallway. Steve nodded in understanding and went to sit next to where the woman indicated him. He looked to the door and the signal with Natasha’s name next to it. Steve felt his stomach clenching with the anxiety.
Steve approaches the black and white TV, Tony indicates the two men in the hall.
"I know. I feel like if-if you die, that's on me." Steve reaches for another spoon of vanilla ice cream.
Tony puts on a dark blue shirt and makes his way to the kitchen, Steve is putting scrambled eggs on his plate along with bread and a few blueberries, well Tony's blueberries but he doesn't mind it. Actually, it makes him remember when he first met Steve, and he can't help but smile at the memory.
Tony looks away, unable to face the red hair. Steve wasn't falling with him, the blond loved Peggy, he carries a picture of her wherever he goes, Steve wasn't... couldn't... Steve does everything right and Tony, Tony is a such a mess.
"Good luck in your... project, doctor." The elevator doors close.
“Great. You’re seeing Fury with some other right there?” Steve acquiesced. “And our partnerships there? We really need pictures of them, they make a big difference supporting this event.”
It felt like someone had hit on his throat, or he had fallen from the twentieth floor of a building on his back and survived. It felt like someone had punched all the air out of his lungs.
"HYDRA's director, I think. Thomas Pierce." The brunet shrugs nonchalantly. Steve raises a brow, surprised.
"I'm gonna make some coffee, then."
I promise Tony will be in the next chapter ; )
"What are you doing?" Steve asks, a furrow between his eyebrows.
"You know you broke my heart, right?" Tony whispers. "When you run away. I mean you broke it figuratively and literally." A smile appears on his lips.
?, Tony thought, now feeling less tense than before.
The room gets silent when she finishes the letter. Each one of them try to hide their emotions, but they all look sad, they had ended up losing three friends, after all. At least, Steve and Tony had a life together, a calm, happy and delightful one, she expects.
"You mean... Aliens?" A skeptical gaze passes through Peggy's face.
Steve blinks, wondering if he had heard correctly. Did Tony just tell him that they were dating? Is it what--
“Huh, yeah. It’s great. Really. Everyone’s cool, it was good,” Steve babbled awkwardly. Clint acquiesced, sipping his drink.
“Did he?” Tony raised a brow, a sassy smirk appeared on his lips. Steve winked at him as he went to the kitchen with Bucky.
"Hey, you!" He shouts, taking a step in his direction, he's too close. "I know you." Tony frows. No, he didn't know the guy, how could he--
. Fuck you, Stark. Steve curses.
Tony pants, his short nails scratching Steve’s sides when the Alpha hits his prostate, sending immeasurable waves of pleasure as he keeps hitting the sweet spot inside the Omega.
A few minutes pass until Bruce joins her in the room. He is sipping his tea quite peacefully, which annoys her a little bit. She is fucking worried about her friends.
“I have a motorcycle.”
“If you say so,” Natasha shrugs, putting each paper into the right folder on her shelf. “You can always talk to me, Steve. I can talk to Tony about his behavior if you ever feel uncomfortable, you just have to tell me.”
"No, I'm serious. Why are you fumbling on my things, Steve?" Steve cheeks reddened, and Tony is not sure if he is ashamed because he was caught or if he is angry for Tony hides something from him.
They both know that they are.
"We take the stairs, alright?" Steve says appearing by his side.
(See the end of the chapter for
There's hand on his shoulder forcing him to stand up. Tony blinks again trying to focus on something, on someone, in a matter-of-fact. He stares at Steve, the supersoldier is shouting something, but he can't listen, the whirr in his ear are too loud now. He feels Steve's arm wraps around his waist pulling him out of the lab.
He stepped out of the bed careful not to wake Steve, he took a quick shower and left without breakfast or coffee. There's no need to wake Steve for that simple task, he was more than capable to do that on his own. When Tony Stark has an idea, he got obsessed with it, not even basics necessities could get him rid of it.
Steve counted three models wearing sexy lingerie. They were in the makeup process. Steve looked to the scenario in front of him. There were flowers coming down the ceiling on the wall, where a red sofa was in the middle to make everything look sexy and desirable. A provocative collection to praise women’s bodies. Steve was happy for the fact he was gay. From the corner of his eyes, he could see two men talking next to the window, one of them had a cigarette between his fingers, and the crotch on his pants showed clearly that he was turned on by the view of the almost naked models. Disgusting.
loved it and he wanted more of it, more of Steve, all he could wish was that Steve also wanted it as much as him.
“I--We are not?”
"Sorry. You looked so sexy, I didn't want to ruin the moment." Tony sat beside him observing Steve's moves.
Something must be wrong. Maybe Steve had lost track of time, too and he was still training. He feels his heart pounds inside his chest with concern, it is almost painful. Tony takes the keys and heads to the gym.
Tony feels the head of Steve's cock pushing in, bringing back the burning, it doesn't hurt, actually, just stings. He feels Steve pushes forward a little more, then the burning starts to become in pleasure. Tony sighs feeling his hole stretches and struggles to accommodate Steve's huge cock, suddenly, he feels full again with their bodies connected.
Tony slams the door on his back, leaving Steve alone in the apartment.
"Well, you don't have to anymore."
Tony nods adding milk and eggs to his mental list. They have to buy exactly the quantity that they are going to use, otherwise, they would waste it and Tony hates the thought of waste food so relentlessly. They will leave in three days, three days to get in Pym Technologies again, and take the particles they need to go back home, Tony can almost sigh in relief thinking about it. There is nothing to worry about, right? Everything will work according to their plan, everything is going to be fine, he tranquilizes himself.
"You know, Mr. Stark. Cut off one head two more grow in its place"
"We'll stay," Tony says to the woman standing his hand for a handshake that the woman happily accepts.
"You're sassy, Stevie."
“I like to create and develop stuff. That’s why I’m going to keep working in the R&D,” the billionaire explains. “I need less stress in my life right now.” Steve notices the way Tony clenches his hands on the wheel. He does not ask further, though, if something is bothering Tony, then he would tell him eventually.
Steve sits upright staring deeply into Tony's brown almonds eyes. The soldier sighs and Tony feels frustrated, he can't have another breakdown in front of Steve, so he shuts his eyes and takes a deep breath, he only opens his again when he felt Steve's thumb caressing his wrist. It's a gentle and relaxing touch and it gives courage to Tony lifts his gaze to that pair of blue eyes.
"I guess a see one when we're coming to eat." Steve sighed.
Warning: there's a smut scene in the end of the chapter, just leaving this warning here in case you don't like it.
Thank you for reading : )
“What kind of caption is that?” Steve raised a brow to his best friend. Bucky walked around to take their dinner out of the bags.
Another look from Peggy sent Bucky back to the kitchen.
The sun was glowing on the horizon, the birds were chirping, everything give her signals that this is going to be a marvelous morning, but Natasha knew it wouldn't. Her mornings were not the same since the snap, it has been this way for the past five years.
“Come in, boys,” a British voice sounds from the inside.
“Yes. I--” Tony keeps his eyes on the road. “I’m making Pepper CEO of Stark Industries.”
He snapped his head back to the table where his phone was buzzing but before he could reach for it, the call turned off. If it was Natasha… The phone starts to buzz again and Sam’s name pops on the screen.
Steve keeps his cap down all the way to the sixth floor. However, the agent seems interesting on him, she looks right into him.
The door was locked, of course, but a simple door would not stop Tony Stark, right? So quickly he solved that problem, and once he was in, he started to look for the floor plan inside of the cabinets, drawers, archives. Then, in the last drawer of Hank's desk, he found a black folder, the cover is made of leather. Tony glances at the papers inside of it, till he found it. The floor plan in the middle of all those boring documents, that's the original one, from the 50s, with all the entries, underground levels, and hidden labs.
"Hum, I don't know. My taste isn't used to sweet food..." Steve doesn't finish the sentence, because Tony gasp exasperatedly cutting him off.
"It's nothing. Nothing to worry about."
"No."
Tony bites his lower lip. Steve notices his brown watery eyes, so he rubs up and down Tony’s back in a comforting gesture. He did not know what was wrong, but if he could reassure Tony that everything was fine, he would. After all, the man had done the same for him on other occasions.
His eyes come back to reality when he saw the men in the corner moving, an apparent fight surging among them, Steve turns around to see what is going on, then something hits the back of his neck because Steve takes his hand to it, Tony can see a bit of blood between the supersoldier fingers, the supersoldier turns around to see where it came from. He stumbles, the fight behind him ceases and Steve fell on his knee, he looks drunk, but Steve can't get drunk.
“I want it, Tony. I should’ve asked before,” Steve sighs, zipping his bag and throwing it upon his shoulder. “I have to say that I thought you just saw me as one nightstand,” the Captain admits.
"Hey, don't look at me like that! It was the best thing I could think at the moment." The billionaire exclaims indignantly.
“It’s okay. Come in, Pepper,” Natasha replied. The blonde stepped inside, and the receptionist closed the door pulled behind her, though she had left it partially opened, and she walked back to her place in the reception.
Tony thank her for the information, and he starts to make his way back to the apartment, deep down he knows that something is wrong, very wrong, indeed. Where the hell is Steve?
Steve is not the kind of person who hides his emotions, Tony sees clearly that Steve doesn't believe him. And Tony knew that he was not fine, not with Hydra chasing them and harming civilians to reach them.
"I'm-I'm sorry for..." for what? He screwed up like he always does, he yelled with Steve and Peggy because he was jealous, that's utterly childish. Oh God, Captain America was really messing with his feelings. "...yelling." He concludes.
“You’re sure?” Tony places a kiss on his hand. Steve nodded. Yes. he was sure. He would be fine. He just needed to breathe.
Tony glances up to see Steve closing the door and mouthing him to stand down behind the counter. Tony spies above the counter just to see the two workers they have seen earlier on the security cameras, passing in the hallway, they stop close to Hank lab, one of them says something to the other who looks annoyed, unfortunately, or maybe, fortunately, Hank's lab is soundproofing.
"Holy shit!" Tony swears when one of the agents stops the door with his foot.
“Mr-” Peter Parker tries to say, but stops to catch a breath. “Mr. Stark. Ca-Captain.” he looks that he is going to fall on the floor, but instead, he holds tight the doorframe. Both men look to the door and see the boy’s state, his grey tux was a little wrinkled and his hair was a complete mess.
"We have to made to a decision. We did what had to be done. This is on me, too." Steve says softly, but Tony can feel the sourness and the chagrin on his voice. "We did this together." The blond reaches for his hand, squeezing it as a way to console him.
“What are you doing awake so late?” he asks seriously, but there is still a smile on his face.
“Hey,” Tony takes Steve’s hand, stopping him from organizing his bag. “Let’s go to my place.”
The laundromat is empty just like when they first got in there, the wash machines working at full, at least, the noise would drown out the conversation.
Later that afternoon, they were in bed, they didn't feel like leaving the house today. Also, it wouldn't be necessary since they still had supplies, and Pym would be back in over a week now.
Tony shakes his head, bursting into laughter all of sudden, though his laughter is not enough to draw attention to them, which Steve is thankful for. He can’t help the grin that appears on his face either. They were really dumb, aren’t they? They certainly needed to improve their communication.
Steve leans forward to his ear, whispering.
"Who's everyone?" Steve asks, a hint of jealousy in his voice. Tony smirks.
Day 16: Fuck or Die.
“Yes, sure,” he replies distractedly. Natasha puts the last folder back on the shelf before turning to face him, she places both hands on the desk, looking more serious than Steve had ever seen.
“Steve talked a lot about you,” Peggy said.
Is he in trouble? Because he feels like he’s in trouble.  Is it because of Tony? He hopes not. He could not get fire now.
"Mr. Stark?"
“Yeah. I hope so,” Steve said. “I’m getting supplies, will you be home for dinner tonight?” Steve asked, but he kind of already knew the answer.
Steve can’t breathe. Or at least, his mind is making him believe that.
So, Tony starts to put their things inside a bag, which is not much, just their clothes, hygiene products, and Steve's sketchbook. That's when he remembers the floor plan of Pym Technologies that he had stolen a week ago, it is the only thing missing in the entire apartment.
"It's okay, Tony," Steve mutters calmly, rubbing his hand on Tony's biceps. "It's okay." He drops a kiss on his forehead.
It didn’t go well. The man, Johan Schmidt has a different, radical, and intolerant view of the world, which makes Steve disagree with everything the man says. So, he left the place knowing very well that he wouldn’t be hired, and he regretted that he hadn’t listened to Peggy’s critics about that Agency. Steve felt that he wasted his entire morning in a place that he didn’t fit. Steve believed that everyone should have equal rights, that no race was pure or something. Of course, he would never fit in a place where black people were highly mistreated, women received less, and homosexuals were seen as sinful. Steve was raised by his mother, and she taught him better principles than that. Steve could never let her down. His mother accepted him like he is, she never even questioned him about it when he came out to her. Instead, his mother showed him love and affection, and she believed that Steve was strong enough to tackle this limited world full of prejudices.
"Excuse me, can anyone explain what is happening here?" She asked with a confused look.
"If that's a dream, please don't wake me up." They sealed their lips back together.
"Steve," Tony calls.
"I'm going with you." Rhodey states, and she nods. Then, she points to Rocket and Bruce.
There are TVs showing the inside and outside of the warehouse when Tony enters the small room in the back of the place, luckily for him, there wasn't anyone watching these security tapes, so no one knew that he was inside of a HYDRA's base yet. Tony looked to every single place on the screen looking for Steve attentively. He has to be here, Tony thought.
"It's fuking freezing down here." He manages to say, but he is uncertain if Steve even understands it.
"What is true?" Steve turns to him. "Tony?"
“You’re a great photographer, Steve,” Steve mumbled a low thanks in response. Yeah, he knew he was good, but when people talked about his work openly he always gets incredibly shy. “Have you ever considered becoming a model?”
Of course, he had to ask about Tony’s own plans for Friday since it was already Wednesday. Although Tony did not have a ‘family’, for it Steve means, someone from his own bloodline. Tony has his best friend, Rhodey, whom Steve had heard a lot about, then, Happy, of course, and Pepper. Pepper. Steve tenses up when he thinks that Tony and Pepper had been in a relationship not so long ago. Though Steve remembers that he and Tony are very recent, he should not feel this much jealousy.
Steve keeps the gun, turning to Tony and reaching for his hand, rushing out of the establishment with hurried steps.
"I have a crush on you." The words came out of his mouth faster than he could stop them.
"I love a challenge, you should know that." Tony jokes rubbing and rolling his hips against. Steve's. The blond can't suppress the moan that comes out of his mouth. "Let's go, we have to buy some supplies besides chips and soda." He pushes himself out of Steve's grip around his waist and walks out of the apartment, leaving the door open to Steve.
After Steve had uploaded the photos to the company’s laptop, he was free to go. Wanda left earlier probably with Pietro, but Steve still had the address to the ‘party’, so he would just show up, say hello, get something, then go back home. The soldier wasn’t too fond of parties.
"Yeah, uh, you're right," Tony says looking across the restaurant, but then he blinks a few times. "Excuse me? What do you mean we can't-" Steve cuts him off.
Okay, I forgot to update yesterday. Sorry.
"Are you coming?" He shouts disappearing into the darkness below.
The people cheering and celebrating around him had no idea how the future sucks, how much pain was reserved to their sons and daughters, grandsons and granddaughters, and watching all of this makes him sick. He blames himself for everything that had already happened and he wasn't able to change, he blames himself like that mother from the HR had blamed him for Sokovia, for his son's death.
Tony crosses the street, and stops looking around, his hands on the top of his head while he snorts annoyed and worried. Everything is going so wrong since they came here. Tony almost hates the seventies for all the misfortunes it has brought to them, although he makes a mental note to remember that it was in the seventies that he and Steve finally got together, it does not seem so bad, after all.
. When he reaches the bank, he only saw some businessman and staff coming in and out for lunchtime, then Steve noticed an alley between two old buildings opposite the street.
Steve thank the girl who allows him training and they exit the place, making their way back home. Home, such a small word full of meaning, what is home? A place where you would feel safe, but what if home wasn't a place, but a person? Steve had a home, the compound, Tony had given him that home, it was enough for Steve at the time, but now the meaning of this word changed for Steve. Home is a person and Steve knew that no matter where he was, if Tony was with him, then he would be home.
There is a loud noise when the door comes down, and Hydra agents come in. Steve reacts first. Damn those supersoldier reflexes! Tony fights back, always having FRIDAY assistance studying the enemies fighting patterns, but even with this, all his advanced technology, they are clearly outnumbered.
He slides his hands on Steve's side, getting closer to the supersoldier warm body. The sun is shining high in the sky, and Tony knows he needs to go to the apartment, get their things back, and then he can come back and cuddle Steve. This thought makes him smile between the kiss before he pulls away.
“Are you okay, doll? Did he hurt you? I swear to--” anger and concern mixed in Steve’s voice.
“Hm… Not really,” Tony replied, eyes still fixed on the show.
Tony exhales deeply, then he feels both of Steve's hands on his hips. The blond thrust inside him, in the next thrust, Steve hits the right spot and Tony feels the pleasure spreading through his body once more. He'll never get tired of it, he'll never get tired of the feeling of having Steve inside him, it just fucking amazing.
“Pops!” exclaimed her with a childish voice, she was almost six years old now.
"Well, he would kill
"Yeah, keep moving," Tony replies feeling Steve pushes all of him inside Tony. A wave of pleasure consumes his body and he moans out loud.
"Good, I see you're from MIT. That's great. What are you working on?"
“What?” Tony asked.
"C'mon, mister Perfect-Body!" Tony exclaims, rolling his eyes and turning to read the package's cover. "It says sugar-free, see? It doesn't even have sugar on its composition"
They must have had a couple of beers only, since Steve couldn't get drunk and Tony just wanted to enjoy the moment sober at his lover's side. So when the game is over, with a Dodgers' victory, and Steve asks if Tony wants to leave he nods affirmatively. Yes, he just wants to spend the rest of the night with Steve only for him.
Steve laid his head against Tony’s shoulder on his side. His breath slowed down, and the world looked a bit clearer now, even though the sky was gray and cloudy. Steve found himself breathing in the scent on Tony’s shirt. That scent he learned to feel every single day in those past weeks. The same scent Steve missed when he got home. He got addicted to it. Tony smelled like home. And Steve was in need of a home, though he would never admit it to anyone.
He wasn’t planning on spending much time there, anyway. He greeted Thor when this one came looking for Carol Danvers, which Steve quickly assumed he was talking about Carol/Wanda’s fiancée. Steve looked around, realizing that Carol and Wanda had gone for a while now, and they probably wouldn’t be back sooner. Clint was on a call, and Steve had no idea where Pietro was. Nevertheless, Thor went looking for them, leaving Steve alone. The blond quickly texted Wanda to let her know that he was going home, there wasn’t anything for him to do anyway. He doubted that the red-haired would see it today, at least, tomorrow when she had read the message, she wouldn’t feel guilty for leaving Steve behind.
"I'm a guy who likes to surprise," Tony said. Thomas Pierce only chuckled like the whole situation was just pleasant to him, while Tony was just an inconvenience. "Where is Steve? What are you doing to him?" He spits. He's fed up with this stupid game.
"I know. I'm sorry." Steve feels the guilty clenching inside his chest. "I was selfish. I never meant to hurt you, Tony. I hate seeing you hurt." Steve regrets.
"Can you stop it?" Steve says, and Tony sees his boyfriend blushing by the unwanted attention.
Tony looks to the clock to see that is already midday, and lunch is almost ready, Steve should be on his way. Tony turns on the TV, there is an old movie passing and he can just think of how Steve enjoys these old movies.
“I love you tons,” whispered Tony in Morgan’s ear and also kissed her forehead.
“Huh, yes,” Steve replied. Then, he extended his hand to her. “I’m Steve Rogers.” The girl retributes the handshake.
"Shit. We have to go."
“Man, thank God you finally answered. I need your help, it’s kind of urgent, and you are the only one that can save us. Seriously, you’re my only hope,” Sam practically spits out. Steve grimaced, confused.
“Just one,” Wanda insisted, although Carol never moved away from the counter, waiting for Steve’s answer.
"Yes. They-they exist. Seems impossible, but they do," Steve leaned against a washing machine while crossed his arms in front of his chest. "One of them, Thanos. He snapped 50% of humanity in 2019, he said he wanted a better world, a perfectly balanced world. We couldn't stop him on time." Sadness was showing up on his face. "Only now, we found a way to reverse it, maybe." He shrugged. "Tony was the one who built a... Time machine? So we could restore the Infinity stones before Thanos. I-I know this a mess, Peggy, it's insane. I know what it must seem to you, I can't force you to believe me, but... That's the truth."
I'd like to thank you for all kudos. I really appreciate them.
“Huh,” Bucky drew Steve’s attention back to him, lifting his fork in a gesture as he spoke. “There’s this woman, she went to check in the new billboard for SHIELD Clothing in the marketing department. Natasha Romanoff, have you heard of her?” Bucky asked, but he didn’t wait for Steve’s reply. “Her photographer was fired for harassment, I guess, something like that. Anyway, I gave her your number.”
He isn’t jealous, he tells himself. He just doesn’t like other Alphas near to his Omega, even though Tony has his bond mark and he has nothing to worry about. But just a few people knew that Captain America and Iron Man were bonded, this group of people resumes to the Avengers themselves and some S.H.I.E.L.D. highly essential staff.
They come out in a street with a few people walking to only one direction, to the right. And that's exactly the direction that Steve takes. They are not running anymore, they turn the next two corners to the left mixing with the crowd in the seashore, losing the officers from their sight.
"Got it," He says holding a up a paper bag. "Have you tried it?" Steve shook his head. "Well, they're amazing, I'm telling you, you're gonna love it."
Also, I'm already planning other fics, promise I'll post a SteveTony one-shot soon, and the next long fic will be around Doctor Strange and Wanda Maximoff.
He doesn't see who spits at his side while saying that he is disgusted. He felt humiliated as he never felt, and the thought that he won't be the last to suffer this kind of aggression makes him feel sick. The guys leave laughing down the street on the opposite side he should head. Tony groans in pain in an attempt of lifting himself, the pain reflected in all over his body.
“Easy, soldier,” Tony mumbled between their kisses, though Tony doesn’t make anything to help him when the brunet bites his lower lip.
“Right,” Natasha said. She looked inside the office, then back to Steve. “Come in.”
Steve cups Tony's face with his hands, he approaches even more and bring their foreheads together.
Day 19: Stripping
"Or you could've just kissed me like you did earlier, then you would figure it out." Tony retorts with a sassy smirk on his lips. Steve furrowed and narrowed his eyes, but he ends up smiling too and leaning to find Tony's lips once again. After they parted, Tony stares deeply in those blue eyes. "I love you, too." He leaves these words to fill the silence between them. Tony always has been scared of saying those words out loud, everyone that he cares, ended up leaving him, and each departure hurt more than the last one. He didn't want Steve to leave him too, but he hadn't realized that not saying it was keeping him away from achieving his own happiness, from Steve, until now.
A flash of pain crosses Steve's eyes before he lowers his head, a hand resting on his hips, he sighs in a clear sound of disappointment. Tony's brows eyes are watered, he feels the lump inside in his throat grows thick and becomes hard to breathe. Listening to those words coming through Steve's mouth was too harsh and suddenly too much to handle, but he clearly deserves it.
"Shit!" Steves hisses.
How are you dealing with a pandemic? Honestly, Writing is the only thing that is turning this quarantine bearable for me.
"Damn, Tony, you scared the hell out of me." He answers sitting on the bench and taking off the bandages around his fists and hands.
! You’re coming!” Wanda’s smile widened.
Basically, angst Tony in this chapter. I hope you liked it!
The blond wraps his arms around Tony’s waist, the difference between their height was clearly.
“Language,” Steve scolded him.
Steve sighs, but he nods in agreement just before leans in and kisses Tony again.
"Did you find something?" Steve asked through the comm.
Steve does not even have the time to stop him before Tony steps in the middle of the corridor, all of the guns aiming at him. Suicidal tendencies, Steve has said once, huh?
Thank you for reading.
“Tomorrow is our big day,” mumbled Steve against the genius’ neck, while kissing him.
"It's not your fault, Tony."
"Goodbye, Peggy," Steve muttered to himself.
Steve doesn't reply back instead he starts to unbutton his shirt.
Tony's aware that the security cameras would catch his face. But since that the 70s camera's footage was awful and low quality, that was not something he should be so concern about. So, he moves on, passing through hallways, labs full of interns and professors.
Bucky sat up, and Steve brought their lips together before he had the chance to say anything else. The blond’s hands run over the back of his shirt. Steve pinched one of his nipples, and Bucky gasped, definitely not expecting for that dirty move.
“Sam? What’s up?”
When he opens the door for him and Steve's room, he sees that the blond is asleep for his relief. Steve went through a lot yesterday and they haven't talked about it yet, but what it is in the folder is true, then he needs to know what exactly happened while Steve was in that improvised infirmary.
"I'm glad to see you again." Steve smiles.
"For what?" Steve mumbles close to his ear, his warm breath makes Tony shivers.
Steve looked down facing his shoes, he only heard Peggy's high heels approaching him, she took his chin in her hand and lifted it up so she could look straight into his eyes.
“You know it’s her favorite story.” he shrugs defending himself.
Steve sucked the skin on Tony’s shoulder, sure that it’d eventually become a beautiful hickey on that olive skin of his lover. He trailed kisses down to Tony's breeches until they are both getting rid of their pants. The huge bulge pulsing on Steve's underwear, the smell of Tony's slick much stronger now without the layers of clothes, inebriating Steve's senses. The urge of taking Tony right now consummating him.
Tony doesn't even try to stop the loud moan that comes out of his mouth when Steve pulls out and then in again. Steve's left hand hold his hips with a tight grip, Tony knows for sure that the blond's going to leave a bruise, but he doesn't care, he loves it, he loved to look himself in the mirror and find an unexpected bruise, of course, only the ones that remember him of the amazing sex he had with Steve that ended up in those bruises. His other hand is holding his lower belly firmly, stopping Tony from move.
"Bullshit, Rogers." He waves his hands turning his back to the blond man, which just makes Steve follows him out of the kitchen. Tony catches his keys that he just had thrown on the coffee table.
"So, tomorrow," Steve starts the conversation, Tony glances up. "Hank Pym is back at his company, and we can get the particles to get back."
"What is this place?" He asks looking around.
Hank sighs loudly.
“Hey, Laura. Well done. Thank you for today,” Wanda approached. Laura smiled at her and walked away to where the other models were getting dressed. “They all have a crush on you,” Wanda declared with laughter. “Oh God, they will be so disappointed when they know.” She laughed more and loudly.
“Right. It begins in two days, is that right?”
"Run, now!" Steve shouts pulling him in the stairs' direction.
, Steve thought, sharing a bed with Tony wouldn't be so bad, he, actually, would like it, even though he knew the brunet didn't correspond his feelings. Tony turns to him.
Steve missed training days in the Avengers' compound. He also missed the morning jogging with Sam, well not exactly with Sam because he is faster than him, so he always outruns him, though he enjoyed his company.
"Anytime, you can always count on me." Steve looks deep in those brown eyes. Tony nods and lets go of his hand. Steve goes back to his side of the back, turning off the lamp by his side. Tony lays down and quickly falls asleep again. He doesn't move again, apparently in a peaceful and deep sleep, so Steve turns his back and closes the eyes.
"Yes, it is the latest technology, they said that the images are five times better!" She sounds excited to show her new acquisition.
“Okay,” Steve said. “By Maria, do you mean Maria Hill?” Steve couldn’t hold his curiosity, watching Natasha’s features afraid of having crossed a line, but she only raised a questioning brow.
"No need to apologize. You two have been under too much pressure lately." Peggy says calmly. "Is there something I can do to help you?"
"I-Sorry" Steve mumbled, but Tony didn't understand why Steve was apologizing, there was nothing to apologize for. Behind him, Peggy furrowed.
Steve holds the man by the collar.
Even Thor, who spent most part of his time in Asgard or outer space, he missed him asking about 'Midgard's objects and habits' or telling stories about Asgard. He also missed reading the newspaper on the tablet that Tony gave to him when they moved in the compound, the Internet is really useful and he couldn't deny that he missed it badly. He never thought that someday he would miss all of this when eleven years ago he felt out of place and time in the brand new twenty-first century.
"What?" Steve almost spits the words, his brows lifted upward in a clear sign of disbelief.
He was calmer, his breath was almost regular even though the lump in his throat persisted. His head is still aching, he should go home and get some sleep, in the morning he would talk with Steve and fix it whatever he did wrong. So he thanked the bartender for letting him stay even if he hasn't drank anything, but looked pretty miserable.
"Shit," Tony says, throwing the jacket in a chair. "I found it on the lab you were, it's a blood sample of yours." Tony rolls the tube between his fingers, then he raises his gaze to look at Steve. "Steve, what happened when you were there?"
, he knows he is screwed if the guy had noticed that move, maybe he thought that...
"Not exactly." He answers, maybe a little too quickly. The doors open and the supersoldier turns to her. "Have a good day, agent..." he tries to read the name on her badge. "Agent Rose." Turn away, it just works to let the woman even more suspicious.
"I don't think they were successful. Hydra was exposed and taken down in 2014 by you, Natasha and Fury. We can't change this timeline, we would screw everything up." Tony says calmly, but he understands Steve's anger. After Tony learns that HYDRA was doing human experimentation, he stopped feeling bad for the warehouse.
Tony agrees following Steve out of the security room. They walk with a rush through the corridors, at some point, Tony has to hold Steve's wrist to slow him down, after all, they don't want to call attention to themselves. They need to act like everyone else, like they are part of the place.
Tony smiles widened.
Day 17: Massage.
Tony tiptoes and kisses the super soldier’s lips. Steve tights the grip on his husband’s waist and deeps the kiss. A slow song starts to play in the background and Steve moves away just a little while Tony catches his breath.
“We were playing tag!” says Morgan jumping happily. The couple looks to each other, an amused smile on their face. Living in New York means that Peter would show up for lunch occasionally and play with the little girl. Morgan treated the boy like he was his body. And honestly, they, the avengers, were a family.
, he thought attempting to clear his mind from dirty images.
"No one is going to die anymore!" Bruce says punching the coffee table and broke it in the half, he stands up and look for both side of the room. "It has to be me. The radiation is most gamma." He quickly explains. Natasha nods understanding his point.
Thank you for reading.
"Be careful," Steve says, squeezing Tony's hand.
Steve can't contain the groans of pain who come out of his mouth, and even though it disturbs Tony, he keeps cleaning the wound, he owes that to Steve, even if Steve keeps saying that is not his fault and he shouldn't apologize.
Steve sat up, his back against the head of the bed, he pats his side to indicate that Tony must come and sit. The billionaire got the message, making his way to Steve's bed.
He looked up at Tony. His lips were moving, forming indecipherable words. Steve furrowed. Tony moved closer, putting his hands carefully and lightly on the soldier’s shoulders. Steve took the hands out of his ears, and Tony held them in his, even though his hands were larger than the brunet’s, also Tony’s hands were more calluses than Steve’s. Tony helped him up, he turned around and said something to someone Steve couldn’t see. God, everything was a mess and confused. What had just happened?
He feels his hole tightening around Steve's cock when he comes. White strips spiraling in the ceramic wall and Steve's hand, coming down his fingers.
“Huh,” Natasha stands up, joining the papers on the desk. “Are you okay with that?” Steve nodded. “What I mean, Steve, is Tony bothering you in anyways? Are you feeling obligated to go out with him just because he’s a star? ‘Cause, you don’t have to. We’ve talked about it before. I don’t want any of you to get out of this hurt.”
“This photoshoot has been delayed for quite a while now. These photos should have been done weeks ago. And I just got a new photographer. Tony has to be back in Manhattan in two days for this photoshoot,” Natasha exhaled. “He signed the contract. He’s aware of the consequences of breaking it.” Steve listened to the heels clicking on the floor again.
"Peggy, I-I..."
Then, Tony's mouth is on Steve's again. His tongue exploring every corner of the blond's mouth desperately. Steve lets out a moan.
The Alpha knows he's cornered, that there’s no way for him to run from Steve’s anger, and that’s exactly what Steve wants. Steve runs toward him mercilessly, punching the man on the nose and hearing the satisfying crack when it’s broken, and the man falls on the floor holding a bleeding nose, the fact that the man is not reacting doesn’t make Steve slow down. Steve seated on the man's chest punching his ugly face repeatedly making him losing a few teeth, well, he deserves it, he should’ve never tried to hurt Tony.
“I--” Steve was about to apologize when Tony held his hand, squeezing softly.
“Tony, this is Bucky.”
“Don’t worry,” Natasha said, stepping forward to take another glass of wine when the waiter passed close to them. She sipped the alcoholic beverage, then turned around to stare at Steve. “Bring your documents tomorrow.”
Steve stopped, putting his hands on his knees to catch his breath, and he looked around. How much has he run? The sun is rising on the horizon. Hell! How long has he been running? Well, long enough the city starts to show signs of life again. People are starting to leave their homes to work out or get to work, cars are whirring in the streets, some kids are half-sleeping against the window of the bus. Steve ran back home.
"Are you sure you want to come? I can do it on by myself," Tony reassures the blond. "Then, we can get the Tesseract and go back."
Day 21: Biting Marks.
"That's not the story, there is much more." Steve frowned. Tony chuckles balancing his head negatively, and Steve just prepared himself for the sarcastic sentence that will come next.
"Did you just swear, Rogers?" Tony lifts a brow and has a proud smile on his face, which makes Steve smile too before turns his gaze outside the window. "I got it, though, you deserve to have a life, a private one, being happy no matter who you love. You deserve it, Steve. It's not fair to let the authorities take this off you." Tony thighs his grip on the wheel, and tenses a bit.
“No dinner, then. It’s fine,” Steve mumbled to himself.
"Uh, yes." He points to Steve. "He's guiding me."
“Yeah. The director of the marketing/design department at SHIELD,” Bucky reminded him.
“Yeah,” Natasha furrows. “You know, I really thought she would be the one Tony would settle down. Then, he started to act reckless, going out and spending nights out. Betting. God. He started drinking too much again. He had been sober for 6 months. I didn’t know what turned him like that again,” Natasha sighed. “Anyway, Pepper broke up, which worsened everything for a while. Then, I heard he went to Italy, his mother was Italian, I guess,” Natasha seemed to think for a bit before continuing. “He disappeared for all those months till Pepper came here, and… Well, you heard everything that day.”
The blond took off his camera, positioning himself to get a nice, clear shot of that lovely scene. This was probably the last picture of the day to update on his Instagram and online portfolio. Steve crouched down to get the sparks of light reflected in the water and the fancy color of the trees where a couple of swans created a gorgeous spotlight. Perfect. Steve stood up, blue eyes fixed on the camera, his main work material nowadays, and a slight smile on his face as he shoved the camera in his bag and walked fast, not wanting to get stuck in traffic on his drive back to the Brooklyn.
“I know your steps,” Bucky replies, grinning and stretching up to glance after Steve’s broad shoulders. “Hey, you, stranger.”
The owner's chin falls, she looks a bit scandalized, but as soon as her face comes, it fades away while she conducts Tony outside.
Tony slams the door of the apartment, going straightly to the owner's house, when he knocks it is her niece who comes to the door, Tony throws to her a sour smile remembering that she has a crush on his boyfriend, however, she calls her aunt very quickly. The owner shows herself sad when Tony gives back the keys, and thanks her for the short accommodation and he bids her goodbye and leaves. It will be better for everyone.
“Captain Rogers?” A voice called him, and Steve turned around aware of who was talking with him.
The men came in Tony's direction again, the first one attacked, but Tony was short and fast and he dodges the attack. The second attacks, directing a kick to his lower back, which makes him stumbles and holds on a shelf bring the products on it to the floor. The second moves forward, this time raising his knee to hit Tony's stomach, but he doesn't expect Tony to take a step and hit his jawline hard, the attacker's head is thrown backward, and Tony holds his neck with a tight grasp almost cutting the airflow. The man pants, holding Tony's arm in an attempt to soft the grasp and escape, them the second holds a gun aiming at Tony.
"Right," Steve sighs changing the weight in his legs and resting a hand on his hips. "How are we going to do it?"
Steve was looking for Tony in the middle of the crowd, they were together during the entire ceremony, then Steve went to greet Nick Fury and lost the brunette of sight.
Steve chuckles looking defeated. Tony frowns, that wasn't exactly the reaction he had expected from the blond.
Anyway, Steve started to massage his foot, putting the exact strength to make it pleasurable. And, Bucky knew that massage always leads to sex. Steve seemed to enjoy it, even though the winter soldier had told his boyfriend a lot of times that if he just wanted to fuck, then he only needed to ask for it, but Steve liked to play, and massage is the blond’s favorite foreplay.
Someone's bumps onto his shoulder. A younger scientist, sixteen years old, maybe.
He wanted to take down Hydra as much as Steve, but they can't do it now. They had a mission, take the tesseract, and go back to 2023. Bring half of the universe back was their priority now, they can't lose focus, Steve knows it.
“This year, huh, was… How can I define it?” Everyone’s eyes fell onto Tony. “Everything was falling apart. I fell apart along with it. I’ve felt hopeless. I hadn’t anything to celebrate or be thankful for on Thanksgiving back then. It wasn’t my best year. But when our whole world is crumbling, and you feel there’s nothing left of you. Well, the world shows us that we are wrong. There’s always a little piece, a tiny piece that keeps fighting. A tiny piece that keeps beating, hopeful, attentive, waiting for something you don’t know,” Tony sighs. “I’m thankful for all the people that helped through the worst days. But I’m really thankful for this guy,” Tony stared at Steve. “I’m thankful that he does not let people tell him who I am, or was, I don’t know. I’m thankful that he does not give up on me. So, yes. I’m thankful for having you Steve Rogers in my life.”
Tony nods while already making his way to the door. He waits Steve gets his leather coat, then he locks the door.
Now, it comes the hard part, which is to tell the rest of the team what had happened, and then she could think about the future. The Avengers future.
"Roger that, Captain!" Tony replies, turning off the lamp.
The super soldier didn't reply, instead, Steve walks there and throw a white buttoned shirt, a lab coat, and a tie to Tony, while he got himself an Army uniform, the traditional green khakis. Miraculously, the billionaire didn't complain at all, he just got the clothes and started to dress up. Steve turns his back and does the same, but he can feel Tony's gaze on his back and he can't hold his smile, even though he knows that the brunet can't see his face. In a matter-of-fact, the genius can't see a lot of him. He wishes Tony could see beyond, he wishes Tony could see Steve Rogers. The super soldier turns back.
It's hard and he feels relieved to see that old building smelling mold, he almost crawls the stairs on his way to the second floor, leaning on the way while searching for the keys in his pocket. His hand was trembling, fuck, his whole body was trembling. He pushes himself in the apartment, leaning on the door to keep himself up, because he can't trust his own legs to do it.
Steve speaking in French is a true turn-on to Tony.
"I don't know I was unconscious, I guess. I remember some glimpses, but that's all."
“Peggy, this is Tony,” Steve introduces them.
“You can only upload the pictures on this specific computer, Steve. I’m sorry, we have to ensure the safety of our brand. We do not want any photos leaked before the collection is launched,” Natasha explained. Steve tapped on the table. He didn’t like it but there wasn’t anything he could do about it, and it seemed like the only restriction so far.
They finished with the floor, and both wash their hands before eating. Steve sees that Tony made a Caesar Salad, which is basically lettuce and vegetables, chicken, eggs, bacon, mayo, and parmesan. Everything looks delicious.
"We need every available agent to sub-level 6. We have a potential breach."
But now, they could change it. He could bring Peter and the others back. He has a mission and he has to accomplish it. He has to take those rare particles and takes the space stone back. He can do it. For Peter. For all of the people who had lost their loved ones in the snap.
Then, in a blink, Steve is moving. Walking as fast as he can without seeming that he is almost running, dodging the people dancing on the hall and those staggering due to drunkness and unable to handle another stupid drink but keep drinking regardless of their condition.
"I love you, Tony."
He's sitting on a wooden chair, his legs folded up on the bed where a sketchbook rests on his knee. He's biting the tip of the pencil when he glances up and his eyes find Tony's brown ones. A smile surges on his red and swollen lips. It's a magical view. Tony wishes that he could spend the rest of his life like that, waking up with Steve by his side while those eyes look at him full of awe and love.
Steve hates bullies. And Tony hurt.
"Are you going out?" Steve's voice sounds in utter disbelief.
He stood up, even though the soreness is still present. He puts on his boxers, and makes his way to the kitchen. The smell of coffee is intoxicating. In the kitchen, there was Steve, he had already showered and dressed. A pity, because Tony, would've loved showering with the blond, but now that they were together, yeah, Tony Stark was committed, opportunities will appear more often.
"It nearly killed my father, if one of you snapped you're going to die for sure." Nebula says.
It might not be what y'all expected. Share your thoughts on the comments, I'd love to know what you think about this chapter, and please, do not hate me.
"Are you okay?" The blond grunts. Tony just nods affirmatively, resting his head against the wall. Steve walks in his direction, turning Tony's face to analyze the scratch on his cheek, no need for stitches,
"Hail HYDRA, Captain." He says starting to convulse and drooling, and then his eyes are glassy. He's dead.
Alright. Perhaps, Steve had borrowed her the book and she never had the time to read it nor give it back to its owner. It happens a lot with her. However, she frowns when she sees the year besides the name. 1984, that's not possible. S.H.I.E.L.D. had found Captain America in the ice in 2011, this book could not be Steve's, someone was certainly playing a prank on her.
"I'm next to..." Tony didn't finish and all Steve heard was something being hit, probably, against the wall.
Tony bites his nails while watching the footage. He sees when Steve fell unconscious on the edge of the sidewalk and the men in the corner rush to get him, then a beige van stops by, opening the door, the men put Steve inside and that is it. That's how Steve disappeared, actually, he was kidnapped, but by whom? For which purpose? These questions wander in Tony's mind without being answered and it makes him anxious as hell.
"I know what you're thinking." Steve lifts a brow under the brunet's statement. "Hydra would steal it yesterday, unfortunately, for them, not for us absolutely, we got there a little early." Tony takes a sip of his coffee and smirks. "Can't even imagine the filthy thief's face when he, or she, realized it was already taken."
Steve snorted with laughter, his cheeks blushing with embarrassment.
“Me too,” replied Tony. “I’m sure she is happy for us wherever she is.” Steve is done with his tie and the brunet squeezes Steve hand slightly attempting to reassure him. The blond nods in agreement.
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean those words, it's just-" Steve sighs defeated. "I just hate seeing you in danger."
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony looks around, the road is empty and he is surrounded by giant warehouses, an endless amount of warehouses with some factories throwing out smoke in the air. That's the fucking end of the world, you just bring someone to this kind of place for only one reason: to kill and hide the body. A shiver passes through his spine. He fears for Steve.
Then, his eyes fell over a screen on his right side, he approaches from it. Steve was tied to a stretcher, an IV tube connected to his body, delivering some unknown substance into his body. Tony felt sick, what the hell are these infamous doing to Steve? His hand clenched to a fist, everything looks so quiet.
They took a table next to the windows, they sit in front of each other. Tony puts the briefcase by his side. Soon, a waitress comes to take their order, she doesn't take her eyes off of Steve. Tony clenches his teeth, he feels so bothered, he is so pissed with the waitress for drag Steve so much attention. He rolls his eyes, he shouldn't be jealous, Steve and him are just teammates, nothing else, despite Tony's hidden feelings.
Wanda was rambling something about the Christmas party thrown by SHIELD at the end of the year when Clint entered and she changed the subject to the man who worked in finances and Natasha considered as a sibling. He looked a nice person, Steve thought, but well everyone seemed nice so far. Steve’s hopes of fitting into this place were growing.
“How are you, Steve?” Natasha asked, rolling a pen between her fingers.
"So, what's the matter?" Tony asks again. Steve hesitates, but then he gave in.
“Oh man,” Steve breathed out on the back of his neck when he slid out and more cum came out of Bucky’s hole.
"Does it hurt?" Steve asks.
Tony leads them to the closest emergency exit for what he remembers from the floor plan. One more agent appears from the elevator.
"What? Two thousand?" Steve frowns asking. Tony looks at him indignantly.
“Hey! You came!” Wanda exclaimed excitedly, and Steve could see that she was slightly drunk. The young woman pulled Steve by the wrist. “This is Clint from finances,” she said. Steve nodded, squeezing Clint’s hand when he extended it for a handshake. “That’s Thor there, he works in security,” Wanda pointed to a blond dancing clumsily, though he doesn’t seem ashamed of it. A blonde bartender appeared bringing another drink to Clint. “Oh! That’s Carol!” Wanda said, smiling passionately. Carol winked in response. “My fiancée. By the way, everyone, this is Steve Rogers, SHIELD’s new photographer.”
"Only if you do that too." He says now glancing up to find Natasha pale, her lips clenched in a thin line. Now, it was her who was surprised and shocked by his answer. The widow never opened up about her life or how she obtained her skills, but Tony knew for sure that Natasha must've been through a lot. And it's okay, he doesn't need to know, everyone has secrets, she only needs to know that Tony supports her and she can also see him as a friend.
A doctor comes in holding a clipboard that he puts on the table, he gets a syringe aspiring the liquid of a bottle, tapping on the syringe to get rid of bubbles. He walks toward Steve, he is close enough when Steve punches him on the face. Tony hears a crack and he's sure that Steve has broken the doctor's nose. The man fell backward, his head hits the tray and his body reaches the floor unconscious.
He got a cab and around twenty minutes he arrives in the place. The building was far from downtown, which makes perfect sense since the enterprise would be running experimental tests that could result in a release of radiation or even an explosion.
Tony looks behind to see a Steve rubbing the sleep away from his eyes while he yawns.
"Fine. Deal."Tony looks to Steve with a brow lifted, but then his face softens and he smiles at the sight of the blond.
“You see Maria Hill there? Ask her for coordinates. She planned this whole thing, I’m sure she has a lot for you to do,” Sam said.
Besides, this chapter was very hard to write, I felt really bad for Tony.
“Okay?”
“You asked for my suggestion, Stevie, I offered one,” the dark-haired waved his hands in the air.
Fuck!
The guy let go of him, and Tony falls again, being insulted for who he is, for love Steve. Tears prickle on his eyes when another kick hit his stomach and Tony lay in the fetus position to protect himself of his attackers.
"FRIDAY, look for fingerprints." Tony stands in front of the digicode while the AI reveals the numbers touched by Hank, probably earlier when Steve and Tony had seen him coming down on the cameras.
Tony sats on his bed, taking the folder out of the bag and putting the rest of thing aside. He reads the content attentively, his eyes widening in shock and horror when he keeps reading further. What Hydra is trying to do is inhuman and unnatural.
Hank pointed to the labs indicating their function and the projects that were being developed in them. Well, the Pym particles must've been somewhere here down here, and now that he and Steve were there they could look carefully to find it, it shouldn't take too long now.
“He put something in your drink,” Tony looked up to meet Steve’s eyes. “My guess is that was some kind of drug to induce heat,” Steve concluded. Tony whimpered, putting one of his hands on his lower belly. “I've got you, doll,” Steve leaned in to plant a kiss on Tony’s forehead, Tony buried his face in Steve’s chest, blushing furiously when he feels slick pooling between his thighs.
"What? I saw him this morning, he said he'd come here." Tony says visibly confused, at the same time he feels his heart rate increasing.
“More,” Bucky said. It sounded muffled because of the cushion, so he said it out loud. “More, Stevie. More. I need more.”
"I-I..." The genius stuttered, shutting his eyes. Why was it so hard?
"Stop!" Steve hears the police office shouts before he reaches the back door, pushing through it.
Tony feels a drop of water rolling down his spine slowly. His hair is wet and a mess right now, while he has his forehead leaned on the ceramic wall in front of him. He's gasping, and his body is half folded, his right-hand clenches in a fist when Steve thrusts deep inside him. He's gasping, too. Steve's fingers trailed a now yellow bruise on his lower back, a reminder of the first night they had sex. Steve leans and kisses it.
“Huh-huh,” Bucky said, putting a fork full of macaroni in his mouth. “Humm… Peggy’s food is wonderful.” Steve smiled, putting macaroni and grilled vegetables on his plate.
He turned the keys in the knob, stepping into the apartment and being welcomed with a deadly silence. Bucky hadn’t come home yet, or maybe he went to Peggy’s. Steve didn’t get to know since his phone had been discharged in the middle of the day. Shit, he really needed a new phone, how can he work with this one during only half-day? Steve connected the phone to the charger and entered the kitchen. He sighed longly at the sight of the pans and plates building upon the sink since breakfast, he’s very aware that it’s his turn to clean them up. Then he opened the fridge, however, instead of cooking, he decided to take a slice from the cold pizza inside the box on the microwave.
“Did you go to Peggy’s today?” Steve asked, already knowing the answer.
"My life is where you are," Tony whispers while Steve rubs their lips together.
“Oh? Sorry, I haven’t checked it yet today,” he excused her.
Every day, he was encouraged to socialize with the people around him, and now with his new job, he would need to talk and keep a good ambient of work. Steve was looking forward to it. He hasn’t been with anyone in a long time. In the Army it was almost unthinkable, even though it happened sometimes, it doesn’t mean anything, though. It was simply stress relief. Now, he was back in his life between Brooklyn and Manhattan, perhaps he could give a chance to meet someone new, and see how it goes. His therapist probably would be happy if he knew Steve gave it an attempt.
"It's okay." Tony mumbles. "I was stupid too." Steve nods still holding his hand.
He feels Steve's head fell down on his back, the soldier's hands supporting him on the wall beside Tony's own. So, thankful, he is not putting his weight on the brunet's back.
Everything in the restaurant shows sophistication, mixing the old and the modern perfectly. Luckily the place isn't crowded, which means that there are plenty of tables available, and, of course, they took the one next to the large glass windows with a splendid view of the ocean and the illuminated avenue outside.
Hey, here it is.
He could almost see Steve’s lopsided smirk with the soldier’s plea. But the Captain wasn’t a sadic, so the bottle lid flew somewhere as Steve poured the content on his fingers. Steve didn’t waste time, though. He spread Bucky’s cheeks and pressed a finger inside him. It’s only when Steve adds another finger that Bucky couldn’t help but arches his back.
Instantly, Tony touches his glasses twice, activating the vision for heat signatures. FRIDAY scanned the place, looking for entries, hidden spots, and traps, according to the AI scanning, his best chance is to enter for the back door, and of course, that is exactly what Tony does.
However, he didn’t understand why he was so nervous, though. Steve has always been a peaceful person, even in the field, and mostly in the field since his men’s lives depended on his decisions. But here he is. The Captain feared what expected him when he stepped in. Natasha seemed a good person, exigent and critical yes, and she seemed a good boss. Steve thought he would not have trouble working with the woman.
"That's exactly why...We need new disguises!" Tony smiles brightly and Steve frowns a little confused. "Let's go shopping!" Tony stands up leaving a 20 dollars note on the table, which will be more than enough to pay the bill.
Tony was leaned against the wall next to the door, the lab coat folded upon his left arm, and his glasses hanging from the collar of his shirt, a few bottoms opened now. The genius turns, he gave in, he's sick of hiding, so he directs a sadness look upon the couple.
"Same. I'm glad," Steve shrugs, putting the coffee in front of Tony who pours some in a mug. It was strong, thick and bitter, just like Tony likes it, no sugar or sweetener. He took a sip, in the corner of his eyes he sees a sketch, he stretches his arm to reach it, putting the mug back on the counter to take a good look of the drawing.
Natasha got in Tony's lab without knocking or warning, she doesn't come down there often, so he expected she would, at least, have the decency of knocking, her high heels click loudly on the floor making Tony raises his head to look at her. He hadn't been working for so long that Natasha would come down to drag his ass up to eat something or get some sleep. He was just doing some minors upgrades in the Iron Man armor, trying to distract himself from what happened early. So Tony frowns to the sight of the red hair, while she leans against the table next to him with her arms crossed, ready to scold him for something that he had no idea he did.
"They've been looking for you, Captain, for years." The man coughs and blood comes onto his hand. "HYDRA will not give up now that they know you are alive and with the Tesseract." Steve's face is neutral with a relentless countenance, his jaw is clenched, he's angry.
“That’s a pity. You could make money with this pretty face,” Natasha patted his cheek, and Steve was sure he was blushing in a scarlet tone now. “I sent you an e-mail this morning.”
Steve doesn’t have much experience in relationships. He didn’t know if people usually talk about their past lovers. When he was in college, he used to hang up, rarely, making out with some guys, but nothing really serious. It was generally one nightstand, which was also something Steve could not blame on Tony for his nightstands or exes, those are a lot. However, Steve was done with being only a nightstand. He needed to know if what they had was serious. He didn’t want to get attached to the model if it means nothing else for him.
They left the sandwich shop and walked together back to SHIELD’s building. They still had time, and Steve imagined that the other team members who left earlier were probably preparing the next scenario for them. According to Wanda, this one was a Winter Collection, left unfinished by the last photographer, which means today was only the first day of pictures. Steve observed as Pietro exited the building, joining him and Wanda. Now, under the sunlight, Steve could constate that his hair was white, it looked like silver when the bright rays of sun hit him.
"It's okay, Tony." He whispers softly and reassuringly.
“No, I don’t think I will.” He replies before holds Tony’s legs around his waist with a tight grip and heads straight to their room.
“I don’t know. Pepper needs him more than I do,” Steve frowns. “Pepper and Happy are… dating. God, I’m still trying to assimilate it, you know? They’re a good couple.”
"Why didn't you wake me up?" He listens to Steve's voice from the bed behind him.
She sat cross-legged and she can almost hear Tony complaining and asking her to take her filthy feet out of the couch, Am I running a bed and breakfast for a biker gang? He would say. It makes her a laugh, a sad and loud laughter. She never thought she would miss him so much.
Thank you for the comments and all the kudos. I really appreciate them, I hope you're enjoying this story as much as I am writing it.
"We can shower together." He bites Tony's ear lobe seductively before he robs a kiss from him. He feels Tony smiles naughtily against his lips, and Steve feels his own body shivering, not even remembering where they are and that they shouldn't be so close in public.
He should be doing better, right? That’s what he was supposed to do. That’s what people expecting from him. To do better. To be better.
Tony blinks when reality hits him back. That memory, that specific memory was when he realizes that he, indeed, loved the blond super soldier, the man that he grew up listening about. What a coincidence! Life is
"Steve," the brunet sounded serious, and Steve felt a cold passing through his spine. "I guess I'm being followed." The Captain stood up at once.
"Tony, not your fault." Steve squeezes Tony's knee slightly with his good arm.
I promise the next chapter I'll make a happy Tony and all fluff.
The elevator’s doors opened, and Tony broke the kiss, walking into the living room of the penthouse. Steve sighed exasperatedly. He did not understand what was holding Tony back. They surely needed to talk about it, but not today. Today Steve wasn’t in the mood, he just wanted… sex. And ask Tony about his Thanksgiving plans, of course. Steve followed Tony into the kitchen, where the brunet was already preparing coffee for himself.
"It's beautiful." He mutters, more to himself than to Steve. He takes another sip and glances up to see Steve serving them. "I didn't know Captain America was an artist." Steve smiles shyly.
Steve didn't even have realized that they stopped in front of a candy store, he was so distracted on his own thoughts. He glances to the showcase to see that Tony was pointing to a pink package full of colorful jellies gums and too much sugar.
Tony didn’t leave his side, which Steve was thankful for.
"No, it doesn't," Steve thinks, his eyes wandering outside of the window.
"That's him," Tony said, leaning on the wall, ready to have a talk with whoever he was speaking. At the same time, he just wanted to hang up and find Steve.
“Miss Potts?” Steve blinks, a little bit incredulous to have learned that by Natasha and not Tony.
“‘M coming,” Steve replied, ignoring the will to check the correspondences and entering the room again.
For a second Tony hears Steve lets out a soft gasp, Tony looks back to his boyfriend and Steve tilts his head in the direction of a lab. Tony's eyes follow the direction and he sees a dozen of Pym particles on a counter, Hank Pym's name is stamped on the door, which means this is his private lab. There is a digicode on the door. Tony nods to Steve showing that he had understood, they need to get rid of Hank so they can get in.
Bruce sighs hopelessly, making his way to the kitchen and prepare himself a tea. He raises a mug to Natasha with a lifted brow, a clear question behind his eyes asking her if she wants some tea, honestly, she wasn't the tea girl, right now, she'd rather a bottle of vodka or gin, that would be perfect to forget all this shitty world. She shakes her head negatively.
I won't post next week. Sorry, but it's gonna be a little complicated for me. Anyway, I wish y'all a Happy New Year, and stay safe!
Tony finds the blond's lips again, biting his bottom lip. He wanted it so bad, he's been craving for it for so long, having Steve like this, naked on top of him. Then, Steve's eyes mouth move, stopping above Tony's bulge. The blond strokes his cock and Tony's body shivers with lust, then he leans and kisses the bulge.
"Hey, look!" Tony shouts, pointing to the showcase in front of them.
"I don't know." He takes a sip of the warm liquid, it smells good. "A lot could go wrong, Nat. Everyone knew the risks. Tony better than anyone, why do you think he refused to help at first?"
"No one is perfect, I've made a lot of mistakes too. But it's assuming them that we prove wrong." Steve, then, pats on his knee. "You need to rest now. We've had a long night." He sits on his side of the bed, pulling the blanket.
“I’m coming,” he shouted.
What came next caught him totally off the guard, and also unpredictable, when Peggy tiptoed to reach his lips and kissed him. The odds were definitely against Steve because that was the exact moment that Tony chose to get out of Hank's lab and get a full sight of Steve and Peggy kissing, the blond took a step back and look to Tony.
“Will you be my best man, right?” Bucky asked, pulling away the hug to look at Steve. The photographer smiled only widened.
"The usual?" Tony looks up to see the red-haired girl with freckles who always take their order.
"Told ya." Tony throws three orange gums inside his mouth. "Let's go to the movies, then you take me out for dinner."
"For this, for these moments, for everything." Steve smells Tony's perfume in the crock of his neck, inhaling his scent.
Steve watched as the blonde walked away, stopping in front of the elevators’ door. Then, he drew his attention back to Natasha on the doorframe, her arms were crossed and she was leaning slightly on it. Pepper stepped into the elevator, and Natasha turned her head in Steve’s direction. The red-haired frowned and looked down at the watch on her wrist. It was an old gold watch, Steve noticed, probably an heirloom.
“Yeah, sure. So, yeah. We never made it officially,” Tony shoves the pill in his mouth. “I--I just thought--”
Bruce's eyes lay on her, watching and studying her. Natasha didn't blame him, of course, but she really want answers. She needs them. It takes one or two minutes to Bruce replies, he shrugs.
Steve stepped out of what might be the fourth, maybe the fifth, company he had left a CV that day. He just hoped that he got lucky in any of them because things are not easy since he came back home six months ago. Steve only expected that those brands would check his portfolio, then schedule a job interview. He really needed to find a job. The ones he has been doing, well, it’s not like working for a brand company, where he would have his money guarantee in case anything happened. No, he has been photographing local events, sometimes, a wedding or college graduation, that’s all, even though the money was good, it wasn’t enough for him to pay the rent, the endless bills, the food, and to keep insurance. Although Steve didn’t get sick easily anymore as he used to when he was a child, he still preferred to have insurance just in case, so he was thankful that being a veteran meant that medical care cost lower for soldiers. However, that’s how Steve’s life has been lately, ‘just in case’.
Steve looked at his reflection in the mirror in the bathroom. He had bags under his eyes, which was awful for someone who would be in a job interview tomorrow. Steve threw the two pills in his hands into his mouth, swallowing the medication that allows him to get some hours of sleeping during the night. Steve hated being on meds, but he needed it now, otherwise, his mind wandered through dark places.
"Steve!" Tony shouts in an attempt to alert him.
“I said you’re right, okay? I can’t let you pay the rent, the bills, and the food alone. So, it’s fine.”
"Steve?" Peggy Carter says almost in shock.
He heard footsteps in the corner and quickly opened one of the doors on the vast hallway and got in. There were archives spread over the table, but Tony didn't explore the room, Steve was his priority now and he needed to focus on that. A couple of agents pass, they did not look rush or alarmed, but as they were doing their usual patrol. As soon as they turned the corner, Tony swiped out of the room, walking swiftly in the opposite way.
"Hey, you!" The one holding the flashlight shouts.
Tony's beard tickles his skin, but it doesn't matter because he loves it. Steve's hand rest on the back of the genius's neck, pulling him closes and deepening the kiss, then Tony groans and pulls apart licking the cut on his bottom lip.
Tony turns to look at him, just to find a light of concern into those eyes. Steve is a super soldier, so his strength was inhuman, leaving bruises on Tony.
“You know, I was thinking, back in the nineties, these kinds of accidents were common. The material they used to make light bulbs was shitty,” Tony commented, rubbing his hand up and down on Steve’s arm. “Though, I found it funny the way the models yelled because of it.”
Steve leans next to the exit, his face is covered with ashes and Tony supposes that his own face is probably covered it, too. Tony takes a breath, but he chokes on it due to the inhaled smoke.
"What? Maybe I can use my mouth in other places." Steve suggests dirty and shameless.
Happy New Year, everyone! I hope 2021 will be kind to all of us.
"We'll find a way, Tony." The answer just makes the billionaire laughs more.
The ride to Brooklyn was quite calm. Steve had the chance of showing Tony some establishments around, and alleys he was beaten up at when he was a child and Bucky needs to get him away from troublemakers. They passed in front of Peggy’s restaurant, which Tony already had heard about. Peggy would be over the moon when she knew that people were talking about her sympathetic establishment.
Tony passes it through his skin, and Steve struggles and fails to muffle a groan.
“We’re fine, Natasha. I mean, I’m okay. I--I’m not feeling obligated. It’s… everything’s okay between us,” Steve assures her.
Tony sets the first aid kit on the table in the hotel room, with some difficulty Steve takes off Tony's sweatshirt that he was wearing to not stand suspects on the hotel staff with his blood shoulder. First, he got a scissor to cut Steve's shirt, there is no way he'd raise that arm. Steve stays silently while Tony gets rid of the bloodied shirt, he pours alcohol on a towel to clean the wound.
They led Peggy to the laundromat, at least there they are sure that no one would see or even hear them. Steve moves his hands nervously, clenching them against each other, he took out the cap and looks to Peggy who had leaned against a washing machine, her arms firmly crossed. Tony puts the briefcase aside and goes to the place where they hid the clothes yesterday, he found an empty and dusty bag in the corner of the room and put the clothes inside, zipping it with an annoying noise. No one talks in the room while Steve observes Tony, he can say that the philanthropist is upset, even though he tries to hide it without direct his gaze to Steve. The blond just wanted to fix the mess he'd made, explain to the billionaire what happened, even knowing that he didn't owe any explanation.
