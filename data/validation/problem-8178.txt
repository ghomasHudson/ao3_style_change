Piling up his paper into a neat stack, Steve left for the coffee break to meet Dr. Banner the school’s best biology teacher.
“Steve?” a small voice asked as he felt fingers on his waist moving up under his jacket, roaming his ribs.
“I think it’s better he stands while I do this” Clint said making a general upward motion with his hands and Steve stood pulling Tony with him but Tony didn’t seem to have the strength to even stand up yet and his knees buckled the moment he was upright and another pitiful whine escaped his throat as Steve caught him around the waist and held him up so Clint could quickly get to work.
“He needs to keep pressure off his chest, make sure he doesn’t turn all the way. But he needs to change position every now and then if he wants to avoid getting bed sores" clearly they had all had immense hospital experience to know all this.
Tony will be okay, this is just a passing moment in his life.
“Don’t go steve"
Steve spent his next class on reminding himself that he needed to really take a breather. The kids in his class looked a little terrified of him today, possibly heard about his mood from the previous class. Word travels fast in a school corridor , that much Steve was aware of.
“yeah Clint you idiot" he mumbled and Clint mock glared at him while Steve snickered.
“so I know I promised to show you my lab , but first I really need to see that you are okay.” He heard Tony say from the other side of the door and Steve grinned at Tony’s stubborn insistence
“Yeah really, rhodey was pissed that I was not spending enough time with him” steve was still blinking owlishly at him and then Tony smacked him on the shoulder
“Yeah, he’s not taking it well though. Can you please do the Iv, there is only so much I can torture him with" steve said motioning to it.
Steve turned his head to find Clint perched on a chair beside him.
I knew Tony was going to hate me for what I was about to do but it was for his own good. I placed the mug back on the night stand and laid down on my side beside him moved my hand to his forehead pushing him back into the pillows and kissed him with passion. once I felt him succumb to the kiss I moved my other hand and pulled both his wrists together and pinned him down.
Except today Tony was the last one to leave after the bell rang and just as he walked by Steve’s desk he blew a low whistle at Steve
Thor had been suspiciously silent for a while now and Steve was starting to take notice .
“Yes, because that’s what a teenager needs when he is dead on his feet from exhaustion and doped up on painkillers" he said chuckling as he got up from the couch Tony in his arms.
"Clint! I am going to super glue your mouth closed if you don't shut up" I threatened him.
“Tony? Hey sweetheart” he said softly as Tony struggled awake , blinking sluggishly at Steve before his eyes went wide in panic after realizing there was a tube shoved down his throat. Steve gently held his hands still over the pillows and spoke to him calmly after pressing on the call button.
“there is a Mr.Stark in medical and the doctors told me to get you because he is refusing treatment and seems hysterical.” Steve’s heart was already hammering
Tony did not agree it was funny as he picked up a pillow and smacked Steve with it repeatedly and Steve held up his arms in defence
“I need you to breathe for me tony, come on just like the other day” that only made things worse, Tony started gasping for air as Steve eased him to sit on the bed, holding him at arms length, Tony’s fingers were wrapped tightly around Steve’s wrist as if he was hanging on for dear life.
“You were gone a long time" he said looking up , there was no real hatred there but Steve could tell he was feeling hurt from  being kept in the dark.
“Well, maybe if you conveniently forget to ask for it tomorrow in class then no I don’t have any homework” he said turning to face Steve his eyes imploring .
“ok guys listen up, this here are my good friends Clint and natasha , they are here to make you guys don’t go crazy" and the crowd groaned as they realized that there was going to be supervision.
“will it really hurt ?” He asked looking up at Steve
Tony had been quite pissed with Steve and the team for no apparent reason as far as Steve was concerned , and had been avoiding them all for two days now.
“I have to pee" right, they had taken out the catheter yesterday. Someone had to wall him to the bathroom now.
It did ring bells, a very specific one . One that Steve did not want rung.
“Everybody has patches on their skin, doesn’t mean they underwent surgery. Besides why hide it? If tony was sick he would have told me, told us" he said ,the fear settling in slowly as he realized that what they were saying may have some truth to it.
“okay, will see you in ten.” He said cutting the call as he made his way over to the duffel bag that just seemed to be grower bigger in size. Again probably courtesy of clint.
“Okay, I promise. Even though I know you would never do that" he said confidently and Steve was glad that at least one of them had that confidence.
Steve had sat considering their options of how to handle this. He was internally raging and needed to go a few rounds with a punching bag but he couldn’t leave Tony alone, besides he didn’t want to. He had finally given in to his lustful desires and kissed the teen, safe to say he wasn’t going anywhere for a while, from the teen that is.
“I don’t know actually. Haven’t had a chance to speak to the team yet.”
“I am okay sweetheart” he said after a few moments of silence during which he knew Tony was fretting over Steve’s well being. Tony looked skeptical but nodded anyway.
The touch woke him up, he opened one eye and decided the brightness was too much and Steve switched off the lights before going to occupy the chair hoping tony would actually wake up and not go back to sleep.
“he will be okay. I promise. But the rest of them are going to be worried so please go tell them that we are fine.”
“Tony? You okay in there buddy?” he asked because he couldn’t hear any movement inside.
"I know tony but before that can you just open your eyes for me? just for minute, I promise."
“Okay, I am going to make sure he is okay and I’ll meet you guys down here” he said exiting and took off in a jog . He skidded to a stop however when a familiar voice reached him. Tony was arguing with the medical staff
“nobody should be allowed to look that hot in the rain" he said pouting a little .
“Okay, okay can you sit here for a few moments? I’ll be right back , I need to have a word with the principal.” Tony gave him a quizzical look not sure whether to trust him or not.
“You don’t want to face the team?” tony shook his head ever so slightly
The sudden shock of silence made Steve’s irregular angry breathing sound noisy in the kitchen space. It didn’t being there and yet Steve couldn’t stop it.
“Stop thaat" Tony whined curling into a tighter mass. Steve sighed and pulled the covers off before shaking Tony harder and called out louder
Steve was out of the door within seconds,  but he forced himself to stay rooted outside the nurses office
“I can manage on my own thank you very much" he said rolling his eyes
“What does this have to do with me getting mad?” now Steve's heart was racing and he unconsciously tightened his hold on Tony
"Okay. I'll tell him but can we maybe talk about something else now?" He sounded exhausted as if somehow talking about this had released the tension from his body as he lay boneless not moving in the comfort of Steve's arms.
Steve nodded yes, “definitely had a fever. He was okay when I checked earlier after the debrief.”
“there is something you can do, you are captain America!”
“Steve-“ natasha started but he cut her off
“I am sorry for drinking”
Bruce sighed knowingly ,”I understand,  you can stay until Tony is under and then you can either watch from the gallery or wait outside, he won’t be conscious to know" steve smiled at him gratefully as they made their way back.
“Thank you Mrs. Rishah” Steve smiled at her as she handed over the wrap without much fuss.
He walked through the isle on the side towards Tony’s row and nudged lightly at the person sitting on the corner and whispered to him to call Tony. A few heads turned but thankfully they had shut the lights off and it didn’t distract everyone as much. Tony’s head snapped to the right single eyebrow raising.
"we should do a blood test. Maybe he is anemic?"
“Now now Mr. Stark is that how you talk to your teacher?” Steve whispered his voice had turned husky and as Tony’s eyes snapped up to meet his Steve’s eyes darkened at the sight of Tony looking up at him with questioning eyes.
"I'll go make him a sandwich" Bruce replied instead. I felt myself being lowered onto the couch. Someone was lightly slapping my face, well it had to be Steve, who else.
“we just need to find out how he’s been keeping tabs on you" tony nodded
This is a short one!
“Something tells me you are not as happy as you should be following certain events I am assuming occurred,” Natasha said as she pocketed her phone and walked over
“Why cant you sleep Tony?” he asked gently as he scratched his nails along Tony’s back soothingly.
“What if natasha hadn’t come in at the time she did?” Steve frowned , he hadn’t really thought about it . Mostly he was only worried about Tony.  To be honest he found rather impressive that after what tony just went through he was still worried about Steve. He didn't know how top describe the feeling , the flashbacks don’t just feel like memories but like he was physically reliving it. He shuddered at the thought of having to explain what it feels like to someone else especially Tony-
“Okay, what are you feeling right now? Can you describe it for me?” Clint asked and Tony shied away from Steve’s hands again and said “ it’s hot”
“Should I be jealous?” he asked slightly hiking Tony up higher against his chest.
“If I don’t receive my hug in the next three seconds..”
He was eager to walk the few steps to close the distance between himself and Bruce who was waiting for him at a table. It was the lone table at the cafeteria away from all the noise, Steve wondered why he would pick this spot next to the trash can.
“I didn’t want the money, I wanted the son” tony blushed some more when Steve said that , trying to get up but Steve kept him down against him.
“Okay, I am going to the men’s room , finish your pizza and I’ll drop you home" he said emptying his pockets and placing his phone and wallet on the table next to Tony so he could pay the waiter with it when Steve was gone.
“I actually don’t have much to do , well there is one thing” he said looking at Tony
“its going to be dangerous? How dangerous?!” Tony  asked his problems momentarily forgotten as he paced in front of Steve
“Hold still for one second, do you want to fall sick ?”
“I’ll clean it up,  put some skin glue and steri strips over it. Should hold it for now" and Steve was so grateful that they all had any kind of medical training to manage these situations.
Tony shook his head , he didn’t even seem to be considering what he was saying.
“I should be asking you that" he said holding on just a little tighter
“I…we …no!” Tony sputtered as he tried to pull away from Steve but he was just held down more firmly by steve as he chuckled
“meaning?”
“don’t go anywhere!” tony said leaving the room as everyone rolled there eyes. But the moment he left the concern on everyone’s face was back full blast.
He eased out from under tony, stuffing firm pillows under him before brushing the hair matted to his forehead one last time smoothing the slight frown there with a thumb.
“He has done a lot of good for me too" Steve sighed as he felt Tony become rigid
“these indicate that extensive surgery was done to cover up the scars, there is someone mentioned here by then name of Dr. Cho and that her speciality is surgical recreation with nanotech. There wouldn’t be a scar" he stated
“Mr. Rogers don’t be so hard on the kids" nat said as she walked over with a syringe that had Tony crawling back towards the end of the bed.
The video that went viral about captain America dying was all over the internet and Steve had initially been very worried that his cover would be blown in school but soon realized that his face was marred enough that people didn’t put two and two together.
“Natasha is just worried, nobody likes seeing you hurt by stane or rumlow.” Tony’s frown shifted into a pout and it completely took Steve by surprise.
Tony was already gone to sensation and Steve rubbed his thumb over the leaking slit and that was enough to get him over the edge.
"I was just passing by and saw him sitting here. Came over to say hi, and then noticed his eyes" steve immediately crouched down beside Clint hand going to Tony's chin tipping it up.
She gave him a stern look and Steve shrugged
“Hmm , it was a long day" he said in return sighing “do you really  have homework?” he asked him
“did he give you any more information?”
Natasha cleared her throat “ok now that introductions and semantics are over , can we get back to the reason why we are here?” she asked
“That’s about it" steve told him and Tony’s eyebrows puckered like it did in class when he was trying to concentrate.
“I am going to go for a run" he said and Tony reached out to him grasping at his shirt but Steve brushed it off as he walked out of the room leaving Tony sitting on the table.
Tony's POV
Steve tightened his grip on his wrist and pinned them against the wall above Tony’s head before looking him in eye “do you really think I would be doing this if they all knew?” he asked as he pressed his smiling lips to Tony’s worried one’s.
“You don’t have to explain yourself to me Steve, I am just really glad you are doing okay.” His heart was beating fast and he scolded himself for being the coward.
"No captain, Dr. Banner and Thor escaped relatively unscathed."
“what’s wrong ? Steve you are scaring me" he asked as he gingerly tried to stand up and reach for Steve.
“What I need from you both,” Tony’s head shot up his eyebrows raising but Steve ignored him “is if you guys would let Tony stay with you for a couple of days.”
“put me down!” he giggled as Steve nuzzled his head in Tony’s throat, his hair tickling him.
“I don’t know…co incidence I guess. Just glad he is okay” Steve said “ maybe you guys should drop by, he needs a few familiar faces.” And they agreed
“also, the fact that you didn’t get kidnapped helped, a lot"
Steve knew at the mention of that name that this is was probably the end of his self righteous captain America gig. He was going to soon be the super soldier who went on a rampant murderous rage and killed two very successful businessmen.
Tony kissed him back feverishly, like he was afraid steve was lying.
“When you can’t have something it makes you want it more” he said irritably and Steve did understand that, after all Steve couldn’t have Tony and all he had wanted was Tony.
“Why don’t you show me where he hurt you? Is it your ribs again?” He said trying not to grit his teeth and forcefully stopping his hands from tightening around the table frame.
“I told you NOT to call him" he heard Tony whine from his right side and he turned his head sharply glaring at him and Tony took a step back from the intensity of the glare. He was wearing a sweatshirt around his waist and was holding a small wad of cash in his hand. He looked flushed and completely inebriated.
“Go, steve . We will handle this lunatic.” Clint said and Steve didn’t need to be told twice as he took off in a jog towards medical.
“I am not breaking up with you” he said slowly reaching over he placed a hand over Tony’s and Tony turned his palm around his fingers threading through Steve’s
Thor and the hulk had taken out majority of the squiggles, temporarily giving me some time to reroute the energy transmitted into my arc reactor. The plan was to let the energy be absorbed by the reactor, and once the squiggles don't get their energy back, they are going to have to go back to where they came from through the portal, which Thor would channel his asgardian powers to close.
“how does stane's friend have such close access to you?” natasha asked and Steve shuddered at the thought.
“I can’t face him now, please” Steve contemplated for a few seconds before gently bringing his hand down on Tony’s back.
“Why do you ask?” he said, failing to keep from smiling at the scientist.
“I want to hold you, is that okay tony?” Tony’s eyes snapped up to his , it was clear he was still doubting Steve’s motives. But Steve’s own fear for tony and anger for the man was starting to seep through his carefully neutral face.
Somewhere within him,  Steve hated that Tony asked this question at all. He hated himself for feeling jealous of what was after all just curiosity.
“where to?” Steve gave him a small smile a frown forming on Tony’s face
“Okay, head to physics. We can drive up to shield after okay?”
"how may I be of assistance, captain?"Jarvis replied quietly so as to not wake his creator.
“This is icky steve let me out!” Steve had half a mind to get one of the agents to help him.
“Tony” he said firmly “eyes on me baby, look at me”
“Can I skip school tomorrow because ,you know” steve raised his eyebrows “I underwent trauma" he said.
He was trying to purposely irk them. Hoping that they would hurt him more so the tracker would finally pick up on it.
“I figured I should at least experience everything once.” He said not taking his eyes off of rhodey.
He had a goal though, he helped remove the cellophane wrapped around his chest and then carefully the bandages that covered the reactor which had managed to get damp but not wet but it still needed to be replaced.
“steve?” he asked voice still sleepy
“I hate chem" steve gave him an unimpressed look at pulled him upright,
He drank sluggishly and Steve praised him running his hands up and down his back and Tony’s eyes drifted shut as Steve pulled the comforter over both of them and played down.
Steve considered telling Bruce about Tony and his injury but he remembered how Tony was so against telling anyone so he simply said “yes, yes sorry I was just lost in my thoughts.”
“Why is he here?” steve asked as he felt a chill run through him when he remembered how Tony had said he had wanted obie with him because he was scared. He knew Tony hadn’t been thinking right then, he was bring sedated and he was terrified. But he hadn’t allowed himself to think what it meant that Tony would still feel safe if obie was with him. Had they made a terrible mistake and forced Tony into a situation he was not okay with?
He looked torn between wanting to hug Steve and trying to stay away from him.
“sounds like the infection caught on a lot faster than I thought" he said thoughtfully.
He pulled Tony along towards one of the private room stopping once to make sure the girl was okay. She was already asleep and the other teacher walked in just in the nick of time letting him deal Tony.
Everyday Steve was fed breakfast lunch and dinner. Before every meal he was beaten until his meal was not appetizing anymore.  They were keeping him alive but torturing him. It didn’t make sense. If Steve was in the way then they should have just killed him, why were they doing this?
“he needs to be examined.” Clint snorted at bruce, “yeah like he’s gonna allow you”
I watched with concern as Tony left the room with slightly less swagger than he usually does.
“I didn’t mean it” he said again when Steve finally stopped fussing over him.
I woke up to tossing and turning. Tony has been doing this a lot the past week. I untangled the mess of blankets he had managed to get wrapped up in and pulled him into me smoothing his hair. After a few seconds he calmed down. I turned to look at the clock on the nightstand ,it read 6 30 am. It was almost time for my morning jog. But today I felt somewhat unsettled to leave Tony; he seemed so out of it yesterday night. Deciding to skip the jog just for today I settled back in holding him close to me, never wanting to let go.
“yeah you stink. medics on stand by.” She said the second half to Clint.
“Around four, you want to tell me what was happening with you when I found you in your underwear in the kitchen?” Tony  squirmed a little and Steve actually chuckled as he remembered .
“do you need a hospital?” and Tony shook his head again and Steve asked again
“I don’t think I will ever take your side on this, but I will respect your decision because I have realized something off late , that tony doesn’t let go like he does with you. I spent three weeks with him in the lab while he was getting more sick and he just pretended to be fine and then you walk in and he has a panic attack and gives in. So I know if there is anyone he trusts, it’s you. ” he said adjusting his glasses
"yes Tony?"
“no. Tell me when” he scowled
“are you laughing?” pepper asked frowning and when she caught the look Steve shared with Tony she whipped around and glared at Tony “what’s happening?” she demanded and Tony backed up a step pursing his lips and throwing his hands up in the air .
"The Lion king" Thor explained much too excitedly. I sighed, It must have been his turn to pick the movie. Thor was a sucker for animal movies with happy endings.
He sat down beside him, making sure to give him space and waited in silence for a few minutes to give him some time to collect himself. He wanted nothing but to hold him close and tell him that whatever had caused this panic attack would be alright. But Steve didn’t know what had actually caused it and he didn’t know if this was a one time thing. He didn’t know anything actually, so he opted to stay quiet at least until tony was tracking again.
"What's going on with you?" Nothing! Geez..
Steve was deliberately holding back even though it was getting harder by the second and Tony’s muscles clenched down around Steve’s cock as he rode through his orgasm , and Steve moaned at the stars he saw at the tightness, and momentarily lost his control as he felt the electrifying pleasure take over and he pushed deeper and harder making Tony’s body spasm and shudder around him.
“Repeat them for me” he asked
Tony's POV
“Hey buddy, what are you doing?” he asked still unsure if Tony was aware of what he was doing and he came closer to him his hands hovering the air afraid Tony will fall.
“I am here baby, I am alive. Right here. You can feel me right?”
Tony’s mouth closed shut, it seemed he was honestly considering his options and Steve waited , still glaring at the teen.
He had to wake Tony up, he wanted to talk to him before he was under the influence of the anesthetic and didn’t know what was happening around him.
“I honestly don’t know, I was trying to avoid it as best as I can. Trust me I really tried" both nat and Clint smirked at him “but yesterday happened and I held him in my arms as he slept you know?” it was the first time he had caught natasha trying to hide a smile at him , he knows he must look flustered and it was odd to think that a sixteen year old had him feeling this way.
“He is" Clint cut in
“yeah?” he asked not looking at Bruce but his eyes still on Tony and the tie that hung around his neck. Steve had never seen Tony in an uniform , he didn’t think it would be such a turn on , he had infact expected it to be quite the opposite because Tony looked oh so young! And naïve and absolutely handsome his hair neatly combed.
He knew most of his students and their immediate family well enough but Tony was the new kid and Steve hadn’t had a chance to meet with his family on any school occasions yet.
Tony kissed him back just as fiercely and he was glad because he had been worried that Tony was pulling away and it wouldn’t be the same anymore.
“Nope and how did you know about that?” Tony was still wearing a collared shirt like he had been all day but he didn’t want to ask Tony to show him the bruises yet , he felt like Tony deserved an explanation and answers to all the questions Steve knew was running in his genius mind .
I finally looked at tony for the first time since we arrived at the party. He looked somewhat pale and very exhausted. The fine lines at his eyes crinkling more than ever. I was still holding him facing me and felt him sag into my arms listing completely into me like he had just lost all his energy. If I was not the one holding him I would have never noticed it.
“Sorry, my schedule changed. I have a class after yours” he gave him an apologetic look and Tony looked momentarily sad but shrugged it off quickly enough.
“Okay..why don’t we talk about what is going to happen in the future?”
“Steve you are an honest man, don’t overthink things. It’s not your best quality" she was right but he couldn’t help himself .
Hey guys, is this getting too predictable?
“Is he going to be alright?” Steve nodded
“Do you need a hospital?” He asked and was met with a frantic shake of his head and Steve let his hands hover in front of the now swaying teen. “Do you have any allergies that could have set this off?” His was getting calmer as it become more obvious that this was something he could deal with and that tony was not in any immediate danger.
“I’ll get you food , you sit here” he said pulling her towards the large couch in the communal area. Nat smirked at Steve and he had fight the urge to roll his eyes again.
Steve thanked the doctor and turned to enter the small room Tony was kept in , they had a private room courtesy of black widow.
Tony leaned away from Steve’s hand, shuffled to his feet awkwardly glaring at Steve “why?” Steve rolled his eyes at him but pulled his hand back from the defensive teen
steve waited a few minutes, as he rubbed gentle circles on his back. He didn’t know how to make this better for him.
“-eve" no wonder Clint said no to this mission. Damn that hurt Steve thought as he finally was able to bring his arms up to his face run the weariness away. He’s been wanting to do that since a week now.
He pressed a kiss onto his cheek and pulled his hand out from under his shirt but replaced it again over his shirt.
“He needs to eat something” he told her as she pulled out the needle and Tony calmed down a little finally allowing Steve to take care of him. Steve was still unsure if Tony knew what was going on around him and he sat Tony half upright pulling the throw over him .
Tony also seemed to have gotten over his infatuation with Steve, which Steve was very happy about but was heart broken inside knowing he cannot , just cannot feel for Howard’s boy in that way.
“only steve gets hugs after a battle huh? What about me , did you see my ankle? The poor thing" she said tilting her head slightly trying hard to keep from smiling at the cowering teen.
For a second steve was confused as to what Tony was referring to and then Tony pointed to the cut along his cheek and Steve made an “ah" sound clearly surprised that Tony had been the one to start a conversation this time. Tony grinned at him ,winked and shuffled out the door.
“Okay, good. You are okay" steve murmured mostly to himself and pulled them both up so Tony could rinse his mouth but the moment he pulled them upright Tony scrambled for purchase and his eyes rolled back into his head and his knees gave out.
He handed the cup back and took a minute to take in his surroundings , everything finally sinking in. The realization was sudden as tony looked up alarmed at Steve.
He thanked him , quietly closing the door behind him as he made his way over to Tony again.
Halfway through, as simba was reuniting with Nala, Clint got up and expressed his need to use the facilities, and demanded the movie be paused. Thor gave an irritated sigh and paused the movie.
They sat on the couch like that for a while , until Tony started fidgeting “you okay?”
“she is fine, an agent drove her home a while ago directly from the scene. The blast shook the train but no one was injured inside of it”
“I am heading to the tower now, can you come over? Stay the night?” he asked him even though he knew Tony would say yes
“Tasha huh? Since when are you both on a nickname basis?” he said tilting his head at the nervous teen.
“he is having a flashback,  it happens sometimes when you undergo some form of trauma. For him it’s the cold from the ice.” He heard Clint explain quietly
Merry Christmas to everyone reading this!
That was the last thing he heard before he completely blacked out.
I sighed and looked at the others shaking their head in amusement. He had just scared us all half to death a moment ago from his lack of cognition and now here he is making sarcastic remarks.
Steve tugged him closer towards him and ran his fingers through Tony’s hair once before leaning forward and kissing him softly on his lips. Steve could hear Tony’s heart racing from this close and he turned him around so that Tony’s back was resting on his broad chest.
“Tony? Sweetheart?” he tried , but Tony didn’t even twitch.
It was a peaceful summer break as far as Steve was concerned. Nothing too extravagant , and enough little things happening for it to not have been too dull. It was the perfect relaxing break he had needed before he had to manage a handful of raging teenagers again.
“Don't be an ass-"
“I bet you are” he said kissing his head.
“think you can change into some clean clothes?” he asked picking up the scrubs and showing them to Tony. But tony wasn’t listening to him.
“I forgive you then” he said around his spoon and Steve shook his head while Tony shrugged like he didn’t want to have this conversation
I sighed again at the mention of his eating habits ,tony really did not care about what he was shoving down his throat as long as it was NOT healthy."Yeah i am working on that"i quickly said.
“See? It’s out sweetheart" he showed him and Tony clung to Steve’s hands staring down at his own cock.
“You said this mission was dangerous,  are you okay?” he asked running his hand down Steve’s chest testing to see if Steve reacted and he did wince a little when his fingers pressed against his already healing but probably still bruised ribs from when Bucky had kicked him.
Things got better , eventually. Steve kept busy in school and tony seemed to be over his infatuation with Steve. He was doing very well in school, Bruce loved him. Tony and Bruce had taken to each other quickly . Steve often found the teen trailing behind Bruce as they both waved their hands around arguing about science.
“When did you figure it out?”
Steve hung his head down in shame unable to voice out loud what had just happened.
He nodded more tears falling from his eyes and natasha hit the nurse call button over his bed .
“tony, look at me"
“Tell me what you need baby" and tony whined again shaking his head
“no, I am taking lead. I want a review on status stat.” he turned back to Tony who looked very out of place fingers clutching whosoever pants he was wearing, because they also looked big on him.
They sat there in silence for a few more minutes before Steve decided that tony was really in no condition to be at school.
“he is not very happy with the fact that I am defending you"
“Slow down there octopus, you are going to pull out your IV” clint told him and Tony whined, he whine loudly shaking his hand out in front of Steve’s face
“No, I just don’t like when obie interrupts me in there"
“Why?” okay now Steve was not enjoying the disconcerting emotions anymore. He pulled the throw off of him, pulling him upright and supported him as he swayed a little on his feet.
"He's just a kid Steve, he was just standing up for pepper" now steve gave clint his full attention.
“have you eaten? you took a pretty bad hit” she asked
Just as Steve left the locker room, he heard the distinct choking sounds of someone who was struggling to breath.
"um think I am going to lay low today " I told her as I settled on one of the bar stools nursing my drink. That was enough for pepper to understand I didn't want to be disturbed. Bless pepper, she definitely knew me better than anyone. She gave me quick kiss on the cheek as she herded the people already lined up to speak to me towards her.
“On one condition” Tony groaned about to argue but Steve held up a finger
Over the next few days, Steve was already back to his routine. Grading papers, home works and what not. Until he came across one particularly well written paper especially for a bunch of fifteen year olds who wanted nothing to do with history.
“its called a flash back , sometimes your mind flashes back to traumatic events that you have been through.” Tony made an ‘oh' sound taking a second to comprehend and then asked “do you remember everything about that day?” Steve stiffened ever so slightly hoping Tony wouldn’t notice and thankfully natasha was quick to tell him “let’s hold of on the questions till Steve is feeling a little more like himself okay?”  Tony’s face immediately took on guilt and Steve brushed his fingers along his hair “it’s fine, but for now let’s just eat okay honey?” he said pulling them both upright as they handed over the food.
“target at 12 o clock" and Steve nodded subtly knowing she was going to chase him down. Steve stayed put , as Tony frowned at them both.
Just as I finished my curry, Steve entered again, and dropped two pills in my hands in exchange for the plate. He didn't say anything about it or about me forgetting it. Just handed it to me casually and walked away with my plate to put in the dishwasher. I put them in my mouth, and washed it down with rest of my orange juice.
It was stated clearly that the company was to be handed over to Anthony Edward stark when he turns twenty one and until then for the company to be run under the management of obadiah stane. Ofcourse that made sense, stane was Howard’s business partner after all.
Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
“Tony come here next to me please”  tony looked up concerned from the sudden change in tone and walked over to the bed sitting on the edge
“I think it will require sutures , do you wan-" he hadn’t even finished the sentence yet and Tony scrambled away from Steve shaking his head fear evident on his face
“Oh so you want me to be the bad guy?” she asked as she picked up the necessary things to insert it.
“Tell me what’s wrong” steve shifted them so tony was laying beside him instead of practically on him.
"Tony , he said we should meet him at this bar. He sounded upset so we came and he's a little drunk and we didn't want to take him home like this." He took in a sharp breath, he had definitely not expected this. Especially not in the middle of a very important meeting he was having.
Steve took it from him turning it over in his fingers you will attach it to your underwear, in case they strip you.” Steve nodded,  embarrassment long lost regarding these matters.
“that’s okay, I’ll tell you what. Why don’t we do colors? Red for stop and green for good?” He nodded fast like he was afraid that Steve will take back his words
“Come here” steve said pulling him by his ankle , so he was back to laying down and finished his job quickly and finally pulled Tony’s pants up himself and patted him on his thigh.
“Okay" was the only response he received
“He is on his way sir ,he was in California on business when we called him. Another two hours maybe”
“Okay honey, you want to go back to the bed?” he shook his head , his eyes were wide and terrified and steve didn’t know what to do.
“Bruce i-“ he started but he didn’t actually have an argument here and he clamped his mouth shut at Bruce’s disappointed look.
“There we go , you are doing so well honey”
“Steve don't do that,  you are thinking too hard. “ he felt warm lips brush at his jaw ,down his neck bringing him back to the present .
“Tony? It’s time to get up” he said softly and Tony woke with minimal effort , he looked weary as he remembered where he was and reached out to Steve who took his hand without hesitation.
He quickly made his way over to where Natasha was interrogating the man. And stood beside Clint behind the glass watching her break him. It was mesmerizing to watch Natasha work, she had a way with her words that would tear anyone apart .
“Tony, did steve hurt you? Tell me the truth” he asked knowing Tony at the moment wasn’t capable of screening what he was saying.
"You up for meeting a few people? "She said already looking around searching for the people she needed me to get acquainted with.
Somewhere at the back of Steve mind he knew something was wrong but Steve was so close to the edge himself and he pulled out of the all encompassing heat, tortuously slow and Tony grabbed on tighter thrusting his face into Steve’s shoulder not allowing Steve to move. But Steve was so close to the edge and he needed to pull out now .
Everyone looked shocked to say the least, but Steve was feeling helpless at the moment and he disnt care that he was practically begging for Bucky to stay, he didn’t care that he had just told Bucky he would give up his apartment for him. He didn’t care, because he just found his bestfriend again and this time he was not letting him go.
“You okay?” he asked , pulling his glasses off
“Have I told you just how much of a genius that kid is?” Yes, multiple times from multiple faculties. Steve nodded and Bruce shook his head at him
two and half sets of eyes landed on him as he glared at them, Natasha and Clint surprisingly stayed quiet letting fury take this one. Fury on the other hand , waved a hand at him to sit down at the table where they were clearly going over some mission reports.
“I was doing just fine by myself  before I met you” he said frowning
Both of them nodded and Steve spoke up
Tony whined again unable to close his legs because Steve had them trapped and Steve slowly inched his hand down along his faint happy trail the fine hair becoming coarser as he went lower. Tony was mostly bare , and Steve loved it , his skin pale and his cock perfectly pink at the head.
One, steve was smiling unbeknownst to himself because tony being bored in his class was not only a history thing and two, there was a questionable sense of pride bubbling in Steve’s chest that he just couldn’t fathom. Was he proud that tony was doing well in Bruce’s class?
“I am sorry,  I am really Tony. Please wake up for me sweetheart” he was aware somewhere at the back of his mind that his voice was trembling and his sight was getting blurry.
Tony refused to go to medical, he wanted to see his friends and it was his birthday and Steve couldn’t deny him that.
Steve continued to stroke him through his orgasm “come back to me Tony” he said as he gently palmed his now soft cock ,just loving the weight of it in his palm.
Without letting go of his face Steve pulled back a little “why did you go through all the trouble of hacking shield and calling natasha?”
“I ..I thought you were not going to apologize” Steve smirked even if Tony was not joking
“okay, I am sorry” he heard the static before the link cut off and Steve sighed pushing the door open to his bath.
Tony dropped the pen in favor of Steve’s shirt that Clint had given. He brushed his hand through his hair palm settling on his forehead feeling for the warmth.
“All I am saying is, be careful. It can be dangerous.” She said severing a bot on her own.
“No tony, tell me what’s going on” he insisted and Tony looked aannoyed
“Not really just..I don’t Know" steve felt a little guilty at leaving him alone. But new thoughts today, so Steve was going to take it in stride, because tony was alive , well and doing okay.
“Steeeeeve"
“Where are you going? Come here ,” He said pulling him back between his legs
“Kay okay. Geez! What time do you leave?” he asked clutching tightly at Steve’s wrists so that he wont lose balance.
Even the shocked look on rumlows face at seeing steve was not enough and Steve wanted to slap the shit out of him .
“I am not a kid any more” tony grumbled and peggy kissed him on the head
But Steve wasn’t sure it was his place to ask anything, but the concern was getting the better of him as he watched Natasha pull the door close behind her leaving the two of them alone again.
Clint cleaned up behind them , natasha kept up a constant conversation to keep Tony from spiralling back and thor was nowhere to be seen.
“Not much , turns out he isn’t the master behind all this. Just a puppet" they had already suspected this, because this man had no real incentive whatsoever.
“I really hope you know what you are getting yourself into with that kid” he froze, fury knew. The bastard was pulling his leg.
I heard him fake gasp and hop off the table. I smiled to myself as I heard his footsteps in my pursuit.
“We should take him to medical after a few hours" clint said getting up after he switched off the tv. Steve nodded and sighed getting up slowly and carefully and stretched his arms and legs. They had sat there for a while listening to Tony’s breathing as he finally slept on.
“how long till the surgery?” clint asked and Steve opened his eyes to see whoever answered
“I will have phil do the paperwork, he will be able to visit you tomorrow” tony looked shocked and he opened his mouth and closed it a couple of times like a fish out of water. Steve would have found it hilarious if not for the situation.
“Steve  aaah" he moaned head trashing back trying to arch off the bed but unable to ,the monement just making him thrust into Steve’s mouth.
“Obie says I have to go back to boarding school” he said , looking square into Steve’s eyes, and it was worse than pointing fingers while accusing.
Steve didn’t stop , he kept two fingers in feeling the heat and the velvet soft lining , he used his thumb to massage the rim from the outside.
Tony huffed as he shifted on the bed a hand reaching for the IV and Steve was across the room fast enough to interrupt the scratching that was about to happen.
“who was he steve? Just tell me.” He asked his eyes boring into Steve’s until Steve was forced to give up the answer. He internally chuckled his emotions awry at the moment, thinking about how Bucky always stared him down from doing rebellious things during pre-serum times.
“Thought we could drop by in medical, just a quick check up?” he asked as casually as possible but too late Tony was already panicking
Tony was there, shaking his head at something pepper was asking him. He looked anything but okay, there was a paleness to his face that made Steve think he would pass out any second. His eyes were gaunt like he hadn’t slept all night and the crepe was gone from his hand, revealing the red and swollen wrist.
“Let’s go, to the nurse” he said pointing with his thumb behind him and tony immediately pursed his lips, stepped around Steve “I can go by myself, thanks” and he was off before Steve could even blink.
“What? Why? I am fine!” he exclaimed pointing to himself and Steve agreed
“You have mentioned him at least five times in the last two days” she deadpanned and she was right, Steve never really spoke about his school to these guys.
“Ready to talk? “ he shook his head
“okay. How about you do this and I let you help me in the lab?” well, if only bruce had offered this earlier,  everything would have gone a lot smoother. Because tony accepted that offer so quickly, everybody sighed in relief as he stopped fighting Steve’s hold and finally held still.
“Tony, what is your problem with the xray?” bruce asked patiently while the others looked on worriedly
"no, no I can walk " I woke up feeling groggy and tired . Maybe Steve carrying me is not such a bad idea.i got out of the car with Steve's hovering over me(wait, why were there two of him?). He said something to happy and turned towards me "one foot in front of the other, come on" he was practically supporting most of my weight already and I was so tired, I sagged further into his hold. He stopped in the common room dragging me into a more upright position and ran a hand through my hair waking me up again "Did you eat anything at the party?" he asked me suddenly doubtful.
He was aware how much the guilt was wearing him down at the moment, a weight on his chest refusing to let him take a complete breath. Especially because Tony didn’t feel safe enough to trust him to come to him in the first place. He took in a breath, aware of the fragile human in his arms that was meant to be his to protect, but it only came as a gasp jarring him into sudden darkness as his eyes closed against volition.
“The palladium is not out of his system yet, we need to treat it but now we know it’s not being made worse.” Bruce said as he tweaked a few things around Tony and finally , finally stopped.
“okay steve calm down, he’s probably just dehydrated. He will be fine , we need to get him to medical.” Steve nodded as he picked him up , his head falling lax
“I love you steve” see steve really should learn to trust Tony. Last evening's reaction came from the doubt if Tony really did love him like Steve did.
"okay, let's not prolong this more than we have to" Bruce said "can you take off the shirt so I can see the burn?"
If it was anyone else , steve would have maybe let them take a swing , probably teach Ty a lesson but he knew Tony wouldn't stand a chance, considering the other boy was a foot taller and well muscled, atleast not with his still injured arm and ribs. It's been a few weeks but Steve knows that arm is still bothering him even if he won't admit to it. He hated bullies and had heard enough stories from the other staff. While tony was known to cause a lot of trouble in school , he had realized a while later that Tony never actually bullied anyone and all his classmates seemed to really like him. So he knew instantly that whatever was happening here, it must have been Ty who initiated it. But unfortunately he also knew this called for detention for the both parties involved.
“Yeah, probably broke a rib or two. But it’s mostly gone now “ Tony was still looking a little worried “tony look at me" he asked
“please don't fight me on this Tony" he said as he walked them both back to the bed. He picked him up , manhandled him onto the bed and sat down next to him.
“Yes,” he confirmed without a moment of hesitation but the weight of the question of the status of his relationship with Bucky hung in the air heavy and tense.
“Yeah , is he here?” he asked looking around and Steve sighed running his palms along Tony’s thighs and shook his head , he stood up , pulling Tony with him who just wrapped his arms around steve and tucked his head against his chest.
“Because you decided to take a stroll in the middle of the night" he said searching Tony’s face for any indication of remembrance.
“If you need our help, you are going to have to tell us who did this” she said in a no nonsense kinda way
“Cant sleep.” He mumbled as he tried to get comfortable under the blanket.
“I am sorry but I agree with him, it will be safer for you” tony didn’t even twitch
“At the age of one the child was diagnosed with a failing heart. In two months of the diagnosis a device was invented to keep the heart beating . The technology is far fetched Steve,  even for this generation and I don’t doubt Howard’s genius.” No, steve was not buying any of it
He hadn’t even gotten a hug from his sweetheart since three weeks.
“Okay, so now that this is solved. What are we going to do about Tony’s living arrangements?” that was something steve honestly didn’t know
“there is nothing to fix, nothing has happened” he insisted , steve didn’t like the way he sounded, exhaustion and fear and anguish combined in his tone.
“I didn’t think this would be enough of a reason for stane. Did he say something else?” he asked
“ I am not going.” Steve sighed and pulled up one of the chair and sat down in front of him
Tony pulled away from natasha and looked up at Steve tentatively not sure how Steve was going to react. But steve reached down, wiping the chocolate mustache Tony had and smiled warmly at him.
steve was feeling a little surreal, pinching himself every few minutes to remind him that he had indeed had his hands on the bare chested teen. He was also trying very hard to forget it, it didn’t make any sense in his head either.
“Steve don’t listen to him-“ Natasha started but Steve cut her off shaking his head
“So captain, how does it feel now that the world thinks you are dead again? But I have to say, only you can make dying look good. That was some heroic movie we just shot. There is going to be a lot of tears I can tell.”
Within seconds he was handed the things and he thanked the person without looking up. He took a little bit of the normal water splashing some on her face to give her a bit if shock before dripping some down her parted lips.
Anything and everything else could be dealt with tomorrow when steves brain was actually tracking he decided as he succumbed to the dark behind his eyes.
“Wait , what?” Clint asked and nat shushed him
“He hasn’t been sleeping at all apparently,  I just wanted to tire him out a little.” She just gave a half smile before bumping his shoulder and walking off
“you insist on people not touching you, but not me. Why?” Tony laid his head down on Steve’s chest, giving Steve more access to massage his scalp.
Carefully letting go of his hands over Tony’s ears he guided Tony down onto the bed so he can sleep until obadiah arrives.
Okay guys, i am really sorry for the inconsistent updates. I wanted to write more to this chapter but not having the time. So here it is.
He felt Tony stiffen against him and then say a small “sorry" to natasha while she continued to glare at him but Steve had a distinct feeling that he was missing a piece of conversation between the two of them.
“Yup,  was nice , spent it with everyone I wanted to" he looked up to find steve smirking at him
“no it doesn’t, stop that” he said irritated voice thick from sleep and he buttoned his shirt up and got off the bed while steve watched warily as tony looked around for something.
“Something tells me that the reason stane saved Tony from the accident had something to do with this" he tapped the object in question on the x ray.  “it has a source of energy I don’t identify and I saw the design and I know for sure there is nothing out there like this.”
“ I am not going and you cant make me. Why do you even think I need one?” steve sighed wanting to give up
I wanted advice on whether I should leave this story here or delete it before I start it over again?
Everything hurt and the serum would fix it and then it would hurt again after they would beat him up again. Something didn’t seem right , no amount of negotiation or prying got a answer out of them.
“Tell me about it" steve asked and Tony frowned concentration etched on his face
“sit down,” he said gently pushing tony towards the large couch. His apartment wasn’t extravagant but it was large, it had large furniture because Steve was not a small man. It was cozy enough for Steve to feel like home.
“Good I am happy to hear that, but I need to tell me if you need help okay? Even geniuses need help sometimes" and Tony snorted
“Okay, that’s that. There is one more thing I need to discuss but I think we can do that later" Phil said eyes grazing over Tony’s form.
“hey , come here” Steve said opening his arms slightly as an invitation for Tony to hug him but Tony didn’t move so Steve wrapped his arms the genius. Since Steve was almost a head taller Tony’s head rested perfectly at the level of Steve’s heart.
“language” Steve commented and the three of them glared at him
”you with me buddy?” He asked after he didn’t get a response from the teen even after a few seconds and when he tried to push the teen back onto the bed, he was met with resistance.
“Are you not happy that I get to continue in this school?” he asked pouting but at the same time he looked a little afraid of what Steve’s answer might be.
“I am assuming from the look on your face previously that it didn’t go as well as planned” Steve shook his head at her
“Why does everyone talk about protecting me?” He asked but Steve didn’t know just how much tony knew about his past. Or about his parents.
Also, steve didn’t think he could handle seeing her with another person yet , so he had reasoned with himself that not contacting her would be for the best. When steve finally felt brave enough to look up at her, she gave him a warm smile, her eyes crinkling at the corners which Steve realized must have come with age.
“Fine" he grumbled
“Okay, I think you are done for the day. Let’s get you home" he said tugging him upright gently and Tony bucked pulling away
“Bucky, I have to ask…” natasha asked and something in her voice told Steve that this question will not be appreciated
“Steve, come on. He’s okay, put him down.” Steve was being guided to the couch and he was aware of the cushions hitting his thighs as he was pushed onto it.
“How are feeling?” He asked, as he pulled out his phone from his back pocket and sat it down beside him.
“our job, at shield is dangerous tony. It’s not your everyday police and thief story. It’s real and innocent people always end up getting hurt. We don’t want that person to be you”
Bruce was waiting for Steve with a tray of food at the cafeteria. It had been a troubling two hours as Steve fought with his thoughts about Tony so this was a welcome distraction.
“So?” tony asked as Steve watched him eat his pizza , which wouldn’t have been Steve’s first choice but since a few days Steve was just happy as long as he was willingly eating something. It had taken two days before Tony could handle eating solid foods without throwing up and Steve was not feeling too happy about his choice of foods but he didn’t want to hover so much so he just let it go and ordered himself a salad, so he could pass some to Tony on the sly.
"I am really sorry Tony, You know why I did it" He nodded his head and relaxed into my touch.
"Fat chance!" Clint shouted back without hesitation
“Hmm maybe you should” and nibbled on Tony’s lower lip giving it a tug before pulling back to smile at Tony’s completely shocked face
He was decidedly difficult and often complained about small things but they had long since learnt that a crabby Tony meant he needed some form human contact. So if steve was not available natasha or Clint or even bruce would sit with him for a while.
Tony flailed from the sudden unexpected movement trying to hold onto Steve so he wouldn’t fall face first to the floor and gave an undignified shriek.
“I am sorry, I just needed to figure out things for myself first and you said you trust me with making decisions!” he said tone edging on defensive
“Drink" he was ordered and Steve opened his mouth much too fast letting the cold water wet his dry mouth and blissfully run down his throat.
“It will take longer to heal buddy “ he tried to reason
“eat” he said and tony for once did as told.
“Stane?” she asked her voice like steel and Tony quickly pulled the blanket back up and Steve’s hand wrapped around him again.
It was obscene the amount of cum Steve had released , covering the expanse of Tony’s skin and he leaned down to kiss him at the center of it all  beside the dog tags and Tony immediately wrapped his arms around Steve tightly and his sobs became louder and his breath hitched.
He didn’t know how to explain his guilt of doing these things with Tony and he most certainly didn’t want Tony to feel like he didn’t want to do it him.
“That’s for steve" natasha said handing it over to him as Tony scowled
He gave them both a genuine smile , “we are just headed to a friends place, weekend getaway” he said and he knew he had been immediately caught with the lie when tony frowned at him looking him up and down, but surprisingly he stayed quiet.
So he repositioned him against his chest pulling the towel aside so Clint can access it. Tony squirmed against him feeling uneasy about everything  but Steve  held him firmly against him trying to keep him calm.
“You need to wrap this, this is worse than I thought tony” he said dropping his hand after he didn’t find anything shifting under his fingers and when tony only looked more reluctant he added “you don’t have to go to a hospital. Go to the school nurse , she will do it for you,do you want me to give you a hall pass?” He asked patting his pockets looking for a pen.
Natasha was still asleep , curled up on the sofa along with Tony. She had her arms wrapped around him keeping him from falling over and that reminded Steve that he has not been paying enough attention to his teammates because natasha is never this tired and there must be something keeping her from resting .
“Sure" steve smiled “we will talk then" Tony’s smile dropped
“Sleep Tony, we will talk in the morning”  he told him and kissed his cheek.
“why am I here?” he asked his voice still raspy but clearer, he wanted to sound pissed but he didn’t have the energy. His mind was trying to work a mile a minute trying to remember what happened last night the confusion evident on his face.
"Tony?"
When Tony’s back relaxed once again and his toes unfurled , steve dropped another kiss on his now sweaty hair
“I don’t,” Steve said shaking his lightly watching Tony’s face ease up again “you need to get some rest though, stane will be here in less than two hours” he said and tony frowned at him
“That makes no sense whatsoever”
And Steve laughed relief flooding him as he realized the stupid reason why Tony had been refusing to see her. It was also the first time Tony showed his childlike side and Steve decided to just do it himself.
Steve wasn’t sure what had just happened but he kicked his shoes off and pulled them both more comfortably onto the bed. Tony was still wearing his shoes and after a few comfortable moments of silence he sighed got up to kick his shoes and socks to the floor haphazardly before cuddling back up to Steve.
“How?”
Tony’s face whipped up and Steve cringed at the whiplash  he heard
Tony even seemed to be doing really well, he was always surrounded by his friends . The three of them had become kind of inseparable actually and it was nice to know Tony had someone looking out for him. Steve often found Tony lurking around hiding in the corridors every now and then during gym class but did nothing more than smile and tell him off for doing it again in the future.
“is there a reason you are giving me the silent treatment?” he asked and bent down to give him a kiss on the cheek.
"Yeah I think you got that right. Come here, tony" he said more firmly and Tony adjusted the sweatshirt around his hips and shuffled over reluctantly. He stayed a few feet away from Steve's reach and steve rolled his eyes at him turning back to the other two.
“Uhm , that he was holding you hostage or something” Steve nodded
“Sorry"
“Why did you lock the door?” he asked breathily as Steve stroked over his slightly swollen head .
“ is that what you really want?” Tony shook his head slowly and Steve gave him a small smile
“steeve stop,” he whined bodily moving away from him
“Yeah" he said just above a whisper and Steve closed his eyes taking a deep breath before leaning forward and kissing him gently on the lips.
He trailed wet kisses all along Tony’s neck and his shoulders before nipping at the skin there and Tony whimpered when Steve sucked on the skin but for the first time Steve didn’t stop and he caught Tony’s hands that were trying to push him away and held them above his head. Tony whined when Steve ran his tongue over the now deep red skin , soothing the pain he had just inflicted.
“exactly” he said instead and Tony eyes widened and he squawked indignantly when Steve pulled him onto his lap sideways his head tucked just at Steve’s neck and shoulder so Steve could see his face at all times.
“We are fine Tony , infact we are really great okay?” tony nodded against his chest
I didn't know what it meant, but Tony seemed excited so I smiled anyways trying to appreciate whatever he had managed to accomplish. "j, let her down easy" he instructed. The boots came off, after he stuck the landing gracefully. Wiping the grease off his hands, he sauntered over to me. I opened my arms, and he sat down on my lap, locking his hands around my neck. He looked so pale and exhausted. I wrapped my arms around him pulling him close tucking his head by my shoulder and kissed his head.
“come on” Steve said getting up but Tony only looked at him for a second before turning his attention back to rhodey.
Of course natasha would have told him, he was planning to do so himself, but it still made him feel a little guilty when he thought about how Tony hadn’t wanted anyone to know and now Steve was roping in so many people. He shook his head lightly telling himself that these are the good people , the people that will help Tony out of this situation as best as they can.
He nodded and watched as she carefully slid out from underneath Tony and straightened her skirt.
“sorry” he said putting his hands up “but I am serious about the alcohol Tony. Wait a few years, it wont kill you” tony pouted some more
“is this okay?” He asked as he brushed his thumbs across his cheeks and tony nodded fevereshly trying to move in closer to kiss him again but Steve held him back smiling fully now.
“Too bad, I am already hurt.” He puffed out
“Okay. You are okay" he sighed speaking mostly to himself. He looked okay, other than being a little pale so Steve forced himself to focus on other things. Like how Tony’s lips, soft and warm was making it’s way up his neck.
“Don’t call me buddy and I will be eighteen soon” Steve tried to will natasha and Clint to come back and save him from this but no matter what intensity he stared with at the door, no one came.
“Hey mr.Rogers.  what’s up?” he asked and Steve realized that his friends didn’t know of what happened yesterday.  He had thought he was going to be getting berated by them.
“It will hurt, a lot. And the next time rumlow does succeed in drugging you and If I am not there or if no one is there , things will happen. And it will not be pretty. Are you with me so far?” he asked feeling the wood under his palm creaking from how tight he was clenching it.
steve knew it hadn’t been an accident, but how did they keep this from him?
it was a nice change of pace, sitting together eating. Steve was through with his salad before tony had even taken a single bite of his burger. That may have been because he was too busy asking questions about them and lucky for him and Clint, Natasha did most of the answering, evading questions like a pro.
“Huh, like father like son" Tony said shrugging but was smiling as he heard new information about his dad.
Three months , Steve had managed things and he was proud of how he was handling it. At least he could finally see reason now, as opposed to the first time he stormed into fury’s meeting with nat and Clint.
Just as I started towards Tony I saw Bruce sit down next to him. Engaging him in some sort of conversation. Not even my serum enhanced hearing could pick up on what they were saying over the loud music. Tony has been sulking this whole time. But I was not able to get to him sooner, stuck in my obligations to greet everyone I knew.
On queue, just as the medics arrived, tony said “ catch you guys later, there’s a leak in the armor I need to fix" steve sighed as he watched him fly off. Normally tony would at least allow steve to see for himself that he was indeed alright.
“rub his palms and soles of his feet – Mr.stark can you hear me?” she asked grabbing his right hand rubbing his palms. I did the same with his left and natasha remove his shoes and socks before doing the same. I stopped for a moment to loosen his tie and unbutton the first few buttons on his shirt. His skin was clammy, and pasty looking. I looked up at the nurse in alarm
She made her way inside, holding up the water bottle with a small smile which tony took without much prompting and drank a few sips with shaky hands. Natasha shared a look with Steve and he knew exactly what she was trying to say.
“How is your injury?” Steve asked knowing that Tony cant deny it anymore.
“Steve, can you open your eyes?” he recognized the voice immediately this time
“Medbay downstairs ,and before you say anything to get out of it , it’s not an option.” Tony stood stubbornly pulling away from Steve’s hold and glared at him.
Steve made his way to his class, amusement and a hint of worry making an itch at the back of his mind , to pull out the papers Tony’s class had submitted this morning. He rifled through them quickly finding Tony’s paper to go through it.
“Yes” no point in lying , steve shrugged.
“he reminds me a lot of howard" he said instead eyes scanning over the sleeping face
“please? I promise I won’t cry this time” said yogurt dropped to the floor and Bruce looked at him wide eyes as Steve clamped his hand over Tony’s mouth.
He shook his head clearing his mind and walked behind Tony towards his car and realized his keys were with his wallet and Tony handed them to him but he held both their phones in his hand getting in to the car not waiting for Steve .
Tony took a seat opposite steve, next to Bruce just as Bruce shared a concerned look with steve. Debrief went longer than usual, due to the fact that we still had no idea who was behind the attack. I watched as tony slowly started hunching in on himself, he was taking carefully measured shallow breaths. As soon as the meeting was done, the first thing steve did was corner tony as the rest of team left the room, giving the two some space but not without glancing at tony with worried looks.
She smiled brightly at him ready to tease, but held back
The latter had shocked bruce and Steve but they hadn’t said anything about it other than glance at each other worriedly.  Bruce made Tony recite the fibonacci sequence while he was going under the anesthesia. Steve had left immediately after.
It took almost another twenty minutes before the rest of them were done with this floor and Steve almost sighed with relief. That relief was very short lived however when pepper came walking out of the elevator looking pale and nervous.
"If I make you take off your shirt will I see some new bruises?" Tony winced when Steve ran a hand down his back over the bruise Steve knew was still there from yesterday.
Steve quickly wiped up his hands and then handed Tony one to let him clean himself up and when Tony just stared at him instead of taking it from him Steve laughed amused
“Sure" tony said shrugging his shoulders and Steve felt his heart tug.
“What? Why would he do that?” Steve was thoroughly confused ,he was tired his mind numb and natasha sighed on the other end.
Instead he asked “why do you not want to go to the school nurse?”
Tony was panting, his chest heaving as Steve placed a palm over it , splayed his fingers over the skin and gave him a minute to calm down.
“good, I’ll be back in ten minutes and if it’s not in by then , I will do it myself.” She told him firmly and Tony sniffled and pulled away letting her leave.
“three weeks into staying here" Steve was trying, he really was but he couldn’t accept what Bucky was telling him right now. He relentlessly argued with his mind that this was not Buckys fault, it was the winter soldier’s. Bucky wouldn’t even look at him at the moment and Steve wanted to shake that look off his face and tell him that it is not on him.
Steve's POV
Thor and Bruce were already in the common room, Bruce had a look of utter dismay.
“Okay fine dad” he said and Steve gave him a smack on his butt and Tony yelped trying to get away while steve held him by the wrist.
“how did I do? Do I pass?”
“Your backpack" he said
“I’ll see you later, I think?” he said his voice wavering as he headed for the door.
“No don’t tell me to calm down. Because mr adult here thinks its okay to let someone sexually abuse him, he thinks its okay to let someone hurt him and that I have to watch and do nothing about it! Are you really that stupid enough to think I am going to stand by your idiotic decisions to ruin your life?” steve was breathing hard face flushed in anger
“We need to figure out who’s holding his strings now” steve said and they nodded and this conversation just suddenly became a lot more sensible.
Steve took that as a cue to barge into the room taking in the scene , Tony was sat on the edge of the bed two people looming over him ,one holding an oxygen mask as he tried to coax it on Tony but he wouldn’t allow it even though it was clear he was in the middle of a full blown panic attack.
“because It didn’t happen in the gym" Steve dropped the pen he was holding and his eyes snapped up to glare at Tony at this new information but Tony still wouldn’t meet his eyes.
“Clint and nat , but they don’t know the details. Well natasha might” he said remembering the catheter in the hospital amd Tony’s almost violent reaction against it.
“you know tony stark?” Steve felt an eye roll coming, as he wondered what sort of trouble he was creating again.
“What’s so funny? Two weeks of torture not enough for you?” he spit out and the other one snickered.
“ nothing actually makes sense yet , they hurt me everyday but fed me on time. It’s how I kept track of my days. Week two , same thing, with a camera and then a man ,wearing a well polished suit walked in ,informed me that the world thought I was dead. I shrugged and he walked out annoyed. Week three he came back asked me about whereabouts of the winter soldier”
Tony although had other things in his mind , he pulled the covers away letting it careless entangle in his legs and he moved to get up , the sheets tangled in his legs making him lose his footing and Steve was forced to grab him around the waist to keep him from toppling over. Before he could let go, Tony’s fingers latched onto his shoulders, nails digging into skin as he held on as tightly as possible
" you okay?” bruce asked genuinely concerned
“Can I stake a shower?” he heard an unsure voice pull him out of his reverie. He gave a small smile nodding “I’ll get you some clean clothes. Towels are on the drying rack.” He said getting up to go grab some of his clothes for Bucky.
“I am not sure if I can stay in that room while they are actually cutting into him" steve knew what removing a piece of bone was going to be like, he knew it would smell even worse and to be there while they cut into their lover made Steve feel very nauseous.
He frowned , not entirely comprehending “give tony to me" he felt his arms unconsciously tightening around the teen as he watched natasha take a measured step into the shower in front of them and reach for Tony but Steve wasn’t going to let go.
“I am being unreasonable? Bruce it’s not just a punch and slap every now and then , they have been sexually abusing him since he was fourteen! FOURTEEN BRUCE!”
“Hey, welcome back sleepy head” Steve didn’t know how he managed to soften his voice suddenly like nothing had happened and Natasha raised an eeyebrow wondering the same. Tony had all kinds of effects on him and he was still surprised every time.
Bruce sighed knowing it was a lost cause, he jogged over to the quinjet, Thor pulling him up.
“We decided to put you on the need to know list, when pepper and rhodey told us that he was warming up to you. He is a tough shell to crack. His defense walls are up high . We wanted someone to be there for him if he needs it.”
“I know I can’t promise you that nothing bad will happen but this is what I am made for. My team needs me there, i need you to Understand this.” Tony didn’t say anything,  didn’t even nod so Steve continued
“very well then, good captain, will you please guard my pop tarts until I am done?” he said handing over his paper plate to me.
“Just before Tony went under, he mumbled something about wanting stane there with him because he was scared. Bruce and I thought he was just not thinking straight because of the sedative.”
“Are you staying here tonight?” he asked and she nodded bringing up a spoon of yogurt to him mouth.
“Steve , are you okay?”
“let’s go have dinner and then we can work on your homework" he told him walking towards the door
“For your first time, I’d say you fared pretty well.” Tony didn’t even twitch , zero response.
“worth a try"
”I said what I meant, he was concious and talking while they arrived. I don’t know the extent of his injuries” Steve nodded once
He couldn’t see what he was doing because he had Tony positioned on his lap so that Tony’s face was right below his. He pressed the tip of his finger , just breaching the rung of muscles there and Tony whimpered
“hey, do you want me to take you home?” he asked rubbing his hand up and down on Tony’s back in slow soothing circles.
“Baby" he said and Tony respond with a “hm?” steve chuckled at him before kissing his already swollen lips
Steve slept more soundly than he thought he would that night.
“none, but 17 injured. We caught the guy, nat is interrogating him as we speak” Steve nodded looking around and recognised the wall colours immediately. They were at shield. He was lying on one of the rooms they used for an occasional rest.
“Tony , there are a lot of things we need to discuss. Hey look at me please” he asked tilting his chin up with his finger
“You are supposed to be the level headed one" he said accusingly and Steve winced already knowing what was in that envelope.
“we don’t know of any such incidents, we don’t have a continuous eye on him, stane says it’s unnecessary and tony is smart enough to figure it out immediately” that he was.
He knew exactly why it had come out so hurtful, steve had been angry at Tony at how he had pushed him away in the moment where steve needed to know that his lover was okay , but the worry he had had that Tony was going to spiral to a bad place after so much had been dumped on him had kept his anger at bay .
“I am trying” steve was surprised. It was the first time Tony has ever responded like this to a panic attack.
"Tony! Are you done with the Armour?"Bruce asked, Tony made a so and so gesture at him sitting down on the far end of the furthest chair from Bruce.
I shall break this man’s bones! As soon as we have finished with this mission, I am going to RIP his flesh-"
“Bruce?” He asked tentatively
“Put it on, I am sure if anyone can pull it off, it would be you. Do you need help?” steve asked and Tony stuck his tongue out at him and Steve ignored him as he helped take his shirt off.
Tony held on tightly to Steve’s shoulders teeth clenching.
“No, please just drop it Steve” he said looking down at their linked hands.
The more tony denied wanting people to know about, the more concerned Steve was getting about this whole situation. But he sighed in relief that tony had not argued further.
“What’s happening right now?” he asked as Tony groggily pushed his head up from the bed squinting at the the rest of team before huffing and pulling the sheets tighter around himself.
“you are okay, I got you sweetheart” he said pulling Tony away from his chest to look at his face
“Yes, there is a situation here concerning Steve and ton-" steve tuned out putting his head in his arms trying to clear his mind.
“he said some one delivered it to the house" he said it like he had been repeating it a couple of times and was  but when Clint and nat shared a look, Tony caught on immediately
“The nurse” Steve barked out a laugh, as tony looked at him incredulously at his obviously inappropriate reaction.
“Which is why we contacted CPS to get hold of the original certificate. Everyone will know in a few days that he is really only turning seventeen" natasha told him or re told him for the n'th number of time.
"geez! Okay I am going!" he said glaring at me all the while.
" I feel you bruce" I said as I headed in the direction of the quinjet on the launch pad.
“Yeah? That actually sounds nice. Have a good weekend.” Steve said, trying to end this conversation and get them moving along towards the fast approaching train.
Steve’s head immediately supplied – physics, Tony had told him before leaving his classroom after missing gym.
“I am legally eighteen" he said giving him a half smile and Steve nipped at his ear lobes and Steve ignored him until he whined and pulled Steve back to look at him.
“Avoiding gym Mr.stark?” Tony scoffed prompting Steve to raise an eyebrow
“even if that’s true , I am sorry to say but I agree with stane. It is safer for you” tony clenched and unclenched his already swollen hand tightly like feeling the pain was keeping him grounded.
Tony was sitting against the headboard with a pillow behind his back that natasha had insisted upon and a few pillows below the ankle of his injured leg to elevate it. There was a bandage wrapped around his upper thigh that he didn’t stop picking on so Steve slipped a pen in his hand so Tony would have something to keep his hands occupied.
“Are you planning to fail your classes on purpose so you can stay in my class forever?”
“Okay, sit tight for a few minutes. I will be right back” Tony didn’t look up at him only nodding.
Steve called clint to find out where they were and somehow he didn’t expect them to be at the tower. Spending a day with Clint is usually a roller coaster and Tony would have been his perfect partner. But under the circumstances he shouldn’t have expected as much.
“Cap, how you still sleeping man?” either there was a massive earthquake or someone was shaking him.
"It doesn't happen often" steve froze his fingers momentarily stilling in Tony's hair. He forced himself to resume carding his fingers as Tony put the bowl down next to them and seemed to cower into steve.
He forced himself to focus on the papers in front of him that he had to finish grading, letting tony sleep a little longer. He had gym after Steve’s class but Tony was in no shape to be playing today and Steve would write him a note for the next time. He didn’t think Tony would miss it either way.
“That’s normal okay? You are not hurt , I promise.” He said as he laid down next to Tony,  waiting for natasha to come back because he would rather her do the IV. He just wanted to hold Tony for the moment.
They were crouched in front of him and Tony was on his knees as he refused to let either of then touch him.
“Steve” she said but she didn’t seem as surprised to see him and Tony’s sluggish arm wave snapped him out of the frozen moment and he walked over sitting down on the chairs next to the bed.
I walked him to the elevator, letting the door close.
He couldn’t even shiver, the cold was sinking him deeper and he couldn’t even react to it.
Making sure Tony was really asleep, he ran the heel of his palm along the front of his now soaked pants and sighed when he still felt the hardness under his hand and quietly settled in pulling Tony closer to him.
His head peaked out from under the covers "steve can we sleep now? just you and me? In our room?"
Tony’s moans  turned into whimpers as he came back to himself and Steve kissed his parted lips ,still pumping his hand around Tony’s soft but still twitching cock and he tugged at the tip , swiping his thumb over the slit. Tony let out a pitiful moan at that and Steve continued stroking him slowly.
Tony had been too out of it to realize what Steve or anyone for that matter were doing to him.
He caught a cab, telling the agent to wait for Tony and drive them wherever they wanted to go and then back to the tower. He hadn’t realized he had told the cabbie to go to his apartment instead of the tower until he was already standing in front of it.
“Does is hurt anywhere?” he asked frowning as he scanned his eyes over his body only to find nothing
"Drugs tony, what did you take? I am not mad, I promise. Just tell me what you took honey" he was not angry, he was scared. Scared that he hadn't even realized in his irritation when he had picked him up and now that he was seeing it, it was so obvious.
“how bad is it steve?” she asked that protective self coming out, he could see the menace in her eyes and steve thought to himself, good that bastard deserves it.
“Nat" Steve said the joking aside , his tone now serious. “I need you to make sure Tony can stay in school here" she hadn’t figured it out yet, but she would do anything for Steve.
He nodded slightly before explaining “being gay was not exactly appreciated in the forties. But the feelings were there"  she covered Steve’s palm letting him know, that no matter what the answer might be to her next question,  she was going to be there for him.
Food was always the same, oatmeal. He kept thinking about the greasy food Tony always liked to keep eating. Unhealthy but really right now anything other than oatmeal sounded appealing. Tony was going to be so happy when Steve takes him to a McDonald’s to eat a burger as soon as he gets out of here, after the shower of course.
Tony only just nodded , still not saying anything. He still looked slightly frightened .
“I only have my bike with me, will that be okay or do you want me to borrow Bruce’s car?” he asked now wrapping his other arm around Tony’s wrist
"As much fun as these boring parties can get" he replied before yawning and snuggling into me. I put my arm around him and pulled him closer to me letting him rest his head on my shoulder. He was asleep before we reached the Highway.
“Tony, hey you need to let go of him , he’s going to be fine okay? He needs medical and so do you come on , let go, he’s okay"
Steve almost spit his sandwich out.
he finished saying quietly and it took Steve a while to realize that Tony was trembling again and that Steve was probably going to throw up .
“Anything else?” he asked squeezing gently and Tony jumped a little, but shook his head
“He really does take after him, sometimes I wonder how things would have turned out if they were not..” steve nodded his lips pressed in a tight line.
“tony what are you doing?” she asked him and Tony didn't even look up but answered “fixing your microwave” and nat raised both her eyebrows at Steve who simply shrugged.
“Tony-"
The day was over a lot faster than any of them were ready for it to be. Tony was alternating between being Brave and being scared, even if the latter was only for Steve’s sake.
Turns out sparring was exactly what he needed to get out all the stress from his mind and body and Steve felt like he could go on and on for hours , which is apparently what they did because natasha came down to find them, her hair wet from a fresh bath and oh how Steve wanted a bath. It had been a while since he had taken a bath, he was used to quick showers but at  his moment soaking in the hot water seemed rather appealing.
Steve brushed his fingers through his hair and pulled the covers around him snugly and let him sleep , whatever this was he just needed to rest. He wasn’t sure what was going on eith him, he was sick and tired a lot and Steve was feeling guilty for putting all this stress on him. He didn’t need that, he was just a school kid who’s worst worry should have been about getting into college. Now tony was not even passing his classes.
"Don't you dare fucking speak to her tha-" Ty chuckled shrugging
Steve chuckled “no he is at asgard, but will visit sometime soon"
"How did you both get here, should I have someone drop you?" He asked and they both shook their heads resolutely lips pursed.
So he took a couple of deep breaths and sat down on the edge of the couch looking at Tony he tried again as gentle as he could manage
“Steve you need to get some rest ,he is not the only one that is currently  recovering, head back to hotel for a while.” Natasha tried for the fourth time since Tony had fallen asleep. Until now Steve had been stubborn to do so.
“Why are you giving them to me?” he asked still looking at the metal and Steve tipped his chin up so he would meet his eyes
He was freezing, steve could tell by how cold his skin was and he made Tony stand for a minute while he grabbed him a fresh shirt to put over his head. He couldn’t raise his arms yet and Tony was glad for the help.
“What are those?” Tony asked warily as Steve pulled open the gown and shook it out for Tony to take. Bruce had given him explicit instructions that the catheter and the IV were a must and that if Tony was not willing for it then they would have to sedate him. So Steve had said he would do it himself, not that he didn’t have the knowledge to do so.
“Mr. Rogers something is w-wrong with Tony. He says he can’t breathe and I tried to help him but I don’t know what to do anymore can you please come with me?” already tugging on Steve arm and pulling him towards the elevator.
“I want to..do well" he tugged on Steve’s hand a little pulling it closer “I want to do  more than kiss you" he said and Steve smiled at him pulling him closer.
“That stance is somehow involved. And that he knew we will move in after three weeks and he knew about the tracker.” Clint said as he waited for realization to sink in.
He sighed getting up and picked up the shirt needing to keep himself occupied, he threw in the hamper they had thoughtfully kept along with Tony’s other clothes.
“That bad huh?” she asked as she worked on Tony’s hand. He whimpered a little but didn’t wake up and she taped it in place quickly before attaching the leads from the heart monitor. Steve eased himself back in once Tony was hooked up to everything and wrapped his arms around him.
“That’s all" he said his forehead forming a frown as his lips pouted just a little bit
Tony stirred neck rolling back up and landed on the wall behind him and he let out a tiny whine and Steve reached out to clasp his hand that was laying limp on the floor.
I listened carefully as Jarvis briefed the entire battle to me in perfect sequence. I gasped at hearing that tony's suit had been burnt, that had to be some really strong radiation to be able to affect his suit.
“is he going to be okay? Maybe we should get a doctor to see him” steve smiled knowing Tony wouldn’t be able to see it with his head up.
Tony has also been spending a lot of time in the mansion, and when steve asks him about it, he always speaks this science jargon he doesn’t understand and then sighs and tells him that he is working on something in his lab. Which is good because Steve didn’t like the thought of Tony sitting around stane or rumlow. Which by the way, rumlow had been AWOL since they were back, again something Steve didn’t complain about.
“Steve stop , are you serious?” he asked urgently trying to really get away from Steve’s hands now.
“we are planning to stay at a hotel for tonight , we should probably get going. It’s getting cold” he said turning to face Tony and watched him nod and he got up from the edge and Steve’s hand hovered in the air just incase he tripped.
“Hey" he said knocking on the door getting their attention and they both turned giving him a irritated look and Steve held up his hands mouthing ‘sorry' . He had apparently distracted them from something important.
“You two, out, Now!” said the man in the fancy suit. Steve had seen him only once, he had only spoken once informing Steve that the world thought he was dead but Steve had shrugged.
“everytime I close my eyes, I see you unconconcious and bleeding” he said quietly , eyes averted.
“I am naked! And I am not a girl don’t call me beautiful" he whispered trying to turn so he could hide himself in Steve’s arms and Steve loved it , he loved wrapping his arms around the genius and protecting him.
“tony, he was under some kind of influence , he would never hurt you or your parents otherwise and I know that it doesn’t make it okay but I want you to know that part of the reason I gave you this,” he said tugging on buckys dog tag “is because if you are ever afraid of him, if something happens and you have this I am positive that he wont hurt you, because he knows how much you mean to me.”
Steve spoke softly to him , keeping his mind engaged as they waited for the few seconds it took for two nurses to come in. They got to work quickly, and Tony was put on an oxygen mask instead.
“Do you want to share with me what happened?” He asked as he was finishing up and tony went rigid his arms coming down to drop by his sides.
Steve moved the table away , he moved to sit beside Tony’s chest , his fingers carding through his hair trying to calm him down.
He felt himself blush, he hadn’t done that in a while really. It was different with Tony,  he was the adult and Tony was the one doing all blushing. He didn’t mind as long as he got to see that on tony , but to think back the roles were reversed with peggy ,he didn’t ever think things would be the way they were today.
“It’s just me Tony.” He said quickly as Tony took in his surrounds and relaxed his shoulders. He tried to rub the sleep out of his eyes before turning to look at Steve. Steve held back his sprained hand carefully before he injured it further.
Natasha smiled at him “thank you, was that so hard? And yes I will take care of it.”
“Tony has been working very hard these past few days, and he discovered a new element , that can be used to replace the palladium.”
“He’s going to be okay , steve” he said resting a hand on his shoulder. They looked at Tony in silence for a while, watching his chest rise and fall until natasha came in followed by rhodey and pepper who started started crying again looking at him.
Once he got to the gym, he walked over praying that the coach was nowhere to be seen or heard for that matter. Thankfully he wasn’t, it was a nice day out, so all the students were probably out playing . He rounded the corner at the showers scuffing his shoes a bit on the floor. He didn’t want to startle the boy. He spotted Tony immediately , his brown hair was wet, he had towel wrapped around his neck and was wearing a batman tshirt and a pair of faded Jeans.
He also saw tony startle,his body jerking, from his peripheral vision but quickly composed himself and muttered something that sounded suspiciously like ‘just Natasha’
“My metabolism is apparently not as good as yours” he muttered and Steve cracked a small smile , at least he was talking again. The color was slowly returning back to his cheeks, his eyes tracking better and he sat up straighter against the wall.
They waited for another five minutes and his eyes slipped closed, tears staining Steve’s shirt as he turned him around so that they could check the reactor. After a while,  it was only Bruce and Steve , who sat in silence as they watched Tony’s chest rise and fall.
“Because I already took a shower this morning , stop moving for two seconds atleast.” Tony whined as Steve finally managed to get Tony’s shirt off. His skin was pale from the lack of sunlight for so many days and skin pasty.
"I am sorry" he said softly. I melted at that, sighing knowing that my grouchy mood had ruined his day as well.
“natasha? How long has this been going on?” he asked
Both tony and Ty seemed to shrink back at the threat, it was more the intensity of the tone than the severity of the threat that had them both backing up. It also didnt help that Steve was a towering bulk and looked physically menacing when he got this way.
“now that we have established that I am not going anywhere and that I am not breaking up with you , will you please tell me what’s going on in here?” he said tapping Tony’s head lightly.
“Party at home, drinks and lots of people” meaning someone had slipped him something .
“Ms. Jones ? Anna? You with me?" he said gently trying to get  her attention.
“Sweetheart I have already seen it before" he said smirking at him and tony continued to blush
“I ll go get us something to eat okay? Why don’t you pick something for us to watch.” He said sliding a control for the TV that was mounted on the wall.
"Good morning"
“Tony, stop hey, you are only going to hurt yourself" he tried as he picked up the discarded blankets and trailed after him
“We need to talk , until then I think this will suffice" he said pulling away and Tony looked like a kicked puppy as he nodded
The scalding hot water had helped in more ways than one and by the time he came out of the shower wrapped up in a robe that was much too short for him , food was already waiting for them . A lot of it by the looks of it and Steve couldn’t have been happier as he plopped down next to Tony onto the bed and reached for the first thing his hands could find.
“what do you mean?” he asked confused
"Tony,can you open your eyes?you with us?"Bruce said .That's a good question!why are my eyes still closed?I blinked my eyes open ,everything seemed hazy at first but got better quickly. I was seated sideways on the chair and my head was resting on Steve's abdomen with his hands cupping my face and head.
He had wanted to go to Tony immediately but natasha had told him to give the boy some time and space and recover from the grief. So Steve had left him alone for the four hours it took for them wrap everything up. When everything was done, it dark outside and Steve had half a mind to just settle down and just sleep for the next five days. But home was still ten hours away on the quinjet so Steve decided to stay the night at a hotel and leave the next morning.
“hey" he called out softly and Tony finally pushed his way in shuffling to the foot of Steve’s bed. Steve would have laughed, if his mind was not still feeling fuzzy and shadowed.
But he seemed to be really enjoying the quiet and calm celebration.
I swatted Bruce's hands away and pushed myself away from Steve and grabbed the glass of water someone was holding out to me,Nat, bless her!I drank the whole thing with all eyes on me.
They nodded “we had him picked up from school yesterday because you were coming close to the three week mark. So it wouldn’t matter anymore.”
“I have a tendency to finish too fast"
“I made him run, made things only worse” steve said and chuckled “he did not like that" bucky just raised an amused eyebrow at him
“Oh ,well okay then mister adult , why don’t I leave you alone so you can get some beauty sleep"
Shield had offered the space before but Steve had refused because he wanted some part of his life to be away from this part of his life. But they had still kept it the same way ready for use always.
“ Tony, please I need to see. Is it as bad as last time?”
Steve walked back and forth around the room for a while. He had actually forgotten Bruce and natasha were still in the room with them until bruce came up to him to stop him from pacing
Tony was staring at them, every breath he took made a rattling sound and Steve could already see the red bruises starting to form around his neck. He looked terrified.
“And I will stay here till you wake up" he said and they spoke quietly back and forth like they usually did when tony didn’t want to sleep but needed it until he was too exhausted to say any more and his breathing quieted and his eyes fell shut.
“Well, Mr stark I am glad you told us that, or we wouldn’t have ever known. Up until now we all were under the impression that history was the most creative of them all.” The class snickered, he knew the kids loved him and it was mostly because of his carefree attitude and attempted friendly banter. But he was also very keenly and uncomfortably aware of the pining girls he learned masterfully to avoid after the first few months.
“Wait, what do you mean ‘you guys?’” Steve asked looking around the cafeteria
“I am not that hungry" he said eyeing the wraps but reached for the bag of chips.
“I don’t feel like doing it with anyone but you" he said and Steve could tell he was drifting off as his voice faded with the sentence.
“one week back you didn’t even want to sleep naked next to me, today you want to have sex?” tony stuttered on his breath at Steve’s sudden bluntness and he smirked at his reaction because this was more the Tony he knew.
“I love you so much” he said kissing him on the lips next “you are going to be fine" .
“Will you carry me like you always do?” steve did not expect that, he didn’t even understand what he was asking
Steve took large quick strides over to Tony reaching out to touch him but Tony jerked back at the touch and his gasping intensified as he shook his head .
Tony frowned at him, reaching into his pant pockets and pulling out the sleek phone. “I have to go home, obie will be back soon"
“He demanded we eat something of flavor and I may have conceded. I was not aware that Anthony was not allowed certain food groups yet and he graciously threw up all over himself" he said his face screwing up into disgust as he remembered. Steve winced at the thought of Tony throwing up with that thing in his chest.
“are you okay? Did something happen?” he heard Tony’s panicked voice and Steve cursed clint
“Hmm?” he asked distracting still looking at Tony
“I have enhanced hearing, I could hear you from the door.” He said folding his legs underneath him and turning towards Tony who wouldn’t turn to look at him ,his eyes glued to the TV.
It was funny ,Steve laughed to himself as he thought about how he was basically hanging from chains, covered in blood and filth and sweat since two weeks and all he could think of was that he didn’t know why rhodey and pepper had not sat with Tony in class . Well he did have enough time to mull over why it had been in his thoughts and he had concluded that it was because he knew Tony had two very reliable friends when he was not there for him. But it worried Steve to no end thinking what if they were still on bad terms. He chuckled again and one of the goons, that is if you can call him that when compared to Steve got up and walked over to him with an irate look
“Can I call you this time?” Steve chuckled and nodded
“Not sure , they were playing a game and I heard sudden yelling and she collapsed the moment I turned to see" steve nodded
“And then leave me again like you did yesterday?” Tony’s words cut through him painfully
“I will answer all your questions once we make sure you are okay.” He said and thanked the gods that tony nodded accepting the deal.
“Don’t call him that.” Steve snapped and natasha was studying his face intently and Steve just stared ahead avoiding her gaze.
Steve's POV
“Natasha!” he screamed for her and the second she came running he gave a pleading look for help
“Absolutely not, I won’t be giving up on teaching any time soon. The basics matter, you know?” Another reason to love Bruce. Steve beamed at the women who handed them both their schedules , they parted ways at the end of the hallway promising to catch up with the other at lunch.
I didn't receive any response to that. Only his quiet breathing as he snuggled closer into me tucking his head below my chin.
“Did you guys know?” He asked natasha and Clint
But Steve knew it was not the time to deal with that. He ignored his own needs and lifted Tony to turn him around so he could look at him. His eyes were downcast and he was having trouble holding his head up.
Steve wasted no time in sinking to his knees in front of Tony
“Okay, ready to try?” Tony nodded as he took a step back to allow Steve to enter the room first .
Steve left a while after , he didn’t feel guilty for coming here when he knew Tony would worry but he actually just wanted sometime to himself before Tony was back. They had planned a dinner at the tower with the team and thor was going to be there too. Clint had vowed to get the best tasting cake there ever is and thor was very excited.
Clint was nursing an ice back to his ribs and limping ever so slightly ,some butterfly bandaid holding together a cut on his left eyebrow.
“I do, just not for as long as you would.” He felt Tony wince a little in his arms and Steve kissed his temple and then slid his hand down below Tony’s ass and picked him up like a toddler and grinned at him as Tony held on tighter. Tony grinned back his thoughts about Steve being in pain forgotten as he realized the leverage he had with this new angle.  He wrapped his legs around Steve’s torso and Steve hiked him up higher such that Steve had to look up to kiss him.
“Is it bruce?” Steve’s hand stilled and Tony unconsciously moved his hips to seek the relief again and Steve continued his gentle stroking . He wasn’t sure how Tony guessed that ,but it was not something he wanted to be thinking right with his hands wrapped around Tony’s cock.
Tony whined at the loss of skin to skin contact "we are going to have to wait and find out" I answered him letting go and backing up from the table.
“Steri strips?” he asked hopefully and Tony gave him a confused look and steve held them up showing it him
“He’s going to have a tough dday" again, all they could do was share a look.
“we will start with three of you, then do the rest. Who wants to go first?” she was way to chipper,that was for sure .
"Tony?" He started to sway and I immediately moved to grab him. He jerked away from me so fast, colliding into Nat who tried not to grab as she knew he was feeling betrayed and didn't trust anyone right now. But he was becoming more pale by the second and someone had to do something so I moved forward again very slowly bringing my hand up to caress his cheek .He let me this time still looking at me with the look of betrayal.
“Don’t” Steve said through gritted teeth not looking at her
“I came to ask if could borrow this one?”
Tony immediately latched onto the emotion on Steve’s face as he entered the room to help tony off the table
“Where is he?” he asked his eyes scanning the place and not finding Tony
Steve froze , it was the first time Tony had said that to him and the words that came after that confession broke Steve. He took a few deep breaths before pulling Tony away and holding him at arm length “I love you too sweetheart and I promise I am not going anywhere unless you want me to" he said looking at him but Tony’s face told him just how much he feared what he had just expressed.
“I am okay now , everyone can let go.” Tony said ,trying to laugh it off. It was a known fact any of us hated showing weakness in front of others and we all respected that.
"In the restroom" steve sighed ,taking in the two teenagers looking at him with wide eyes.
“What happened?” he asked looking up his eyes imploring and Steve knew he had to have this conversation with Tony at some point, but he didn’t think it would be today. He didn’t even think Tony was aware of the tension between him and Bruce.
Steve’s decision was made for him then and there when he saw the doubt in Tony’s face at Steve’s words.
“What did the doctor say?” She asked steve and Tony buried himself below the covers
“Pepper has excellent penmanship” he said instead and Steve blinked twice before it registered. He got up from his chair, moving around his desk to walk over to tony. It took him a good few seconds to carefully formulate what he was going to say next, because he knew if he said the wrong thing then tony would get defensive.
“Don’t call him cute or call him your boy?” Steve pinned her with a look , a warning.
“Hi honey" Steve grinned all pain forgotten . An itch he didn’t even know existed at the back of his mind seemed to have eased.
“Sweetheart are you sure?” he asked , and Tony nodded again
I sighed to myself as I tried to think of any other signs of sickness his boyfriend had showed in the past few days.
“I’ll be back asap, promise.”
“Sweetheart,  look at me" he asked gently as Tony finally looked up at him
"I forgot about them because of the invasion, not on purpose!" I snipped, slightly annoyed that Steve thought I would have had the time for this between everything that was happening.
“I have a pair of boxers in the bag" he said shy and playing with the discarded paper Steve had pulled off the steri strips from.
She walked inside and gave a small smile to Tony, handing a small water bottle to him. He took it with shaky hands and drank most of it in one gulp. Steve shared a look with natasha and she nodded and left.
“antibiotics , saline and electrolytes. We need to get rid of this infection” he said , as he gently dabbed at Tony’s hand inside his elbow with a spirited cotton. He waited a second to make sure tony was still asleep before piercing the needle through his skin. Tony whimpered , yes he actually whimpered , but he didn’t wake up.
“okay, we have to get going. You take care okay bud?” They said after they were all done eating, cleaned up the mess they created.
Tony looked like he had been slapped , his eyes darkened and he shrunk a little lower in his seat. Steve sighed , he really thought he had done a decent job of letting him down easy.
“Can we take it out now? It burns” he whispered his lips to Steve’s ear and Steve glanced at bruce who mouthed ‘no' and Steve shook his head and kissed him softly on his cheek and turned him carefully so he was turned towards Steve.
