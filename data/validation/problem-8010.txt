The TV was playing a commercial about some product called Oxiclean, apparently it was good for removing stains from clothes and whatever else got stained on. The man they had promoting the stuff was pretty annoying in his delivery, if you asked Steve. Almost like he was forcing them to buy his product. He sighed, reaching for more popcorn on Tony’s belly, wishing for once they finally invented something that could fast forward through commercials on live TV.
------
“Merry Christmas, Natasha,” Steve murmured softly. It had been a great day with he and the rest of the Commandos miraculously getting a 24-hour leave just in time for Christmas. And who better to celebrate this one day of freedom with than with his love?
“Boss, where do you want this?” Quill asked as he approached them.
“How are you feeling?” he felt Natasha sat down on the side of his bed. Her hands started to card through his messy oily hair, gently lulling him to sleep.
“Pierce told me that he works for HYDRA.” Tony told Steve as they drove back to the bar. Steve scoffed at the ridiculous notion, but Tony continued, “he told me something else too.”
“Uh-huh. I believe that when I see it,” Tony quirked his eyebrow up suspiciously, “what’s going on, Steve? Where are they?”
“Okay you got me there,” Tony took a sip of his Kona coffee. After all this time, it still amazed him how he managed to live without having Kona coffee everyday. Now if he were to fly back to New York, he’d probably turn his nose up at the stuff they tried to pass off as coffee over there.
“It’s only money, Rogers.”
Steve accepted the polaroid and tilted it to show the picture to Tony, still nestled in the crook of his neck. Clint managed to take a picture that somehow incorporated the natural light from the sun spilling inside the penthouse living room from the floor-to-ceiling glass windows, making the picture looked like it was professionally taken, and not a candid one. In the picture, Tony was resting his head on Steve’s shoulder, his eyes steadfastly on Ulysses, who was sleeping soundly in Steve’s arms. Steve himself was smiling down fondly at Tony, happiness evident in his face. This was the first time he ever saw the three of them together, and Steve felt a flood of love and affection so great for his family. “Thanks, Clint. It’s a really good picture.”
” Ulysses exclaimed gleefully.
“I don’t know…” Tony lied. He knew, he knew why. There was an ugly, ugly part of him that was unleashed back then, a part that was buried deep within him and for some reason reared its ugly head back during their altercation in the lab. A part that blamed Steve for not being there at his last moments, for letting him die alone. He remembered how scared he was, how much he wished he could have seen Steve one last time, but he wasn’t there. And earlier in the night, that dark, resentful and scared part of himself showed up and spat out some hurtful stuff to Steve. Though to be fair, Steve wasn’t mincing his words either. They said hurtful things to each other, hurt each other with their words.
Later, much later, after they’ve called Dr. Rosenberg and explained the situation, received a prescription of misoprostol and painkillers for Tony, called Happy and asked him if he would be so kind as to send one of his men to pick the boys up from school, they lied in bed together, exhausted after the whole ordeal.
“Hey, guys. I got the good stuff.” Ned said proudly, dumping a large handful of single-sized chip bags, packs of randomly assorted candy, and a six-pack of Pepsi onto the floor. He looked back and forth between his two friends in confusion. “What’d I miss?”
Quietly, Rose approached the bed and the slumbering teen inside it. She picked up the picture frame off the bedside table out of interest. In the picture, a well-known billionaire stood beside a young teenager, the same one she needed. Lightly, she ghosted her fingers over the people in the photo then turned to the bed, glancing between the photograph and the boy asleep in bed.
One thing he had to look forward to was the one-thousand dollars tucked away in his backpack. A thousand dollars! Not nearly enough to feed his metabolism for five whole days, but it was much better than nothing. He survived on much less in the past and could certainly make do with what he had now.
Tony and Peter were chained to the cracked cement floor in the center of the vacant warehouse, a heavy shackle around their left ankle. During their uncomfortable ride, the handcuffs they initially wore were switched out for shiny, much bulkier cuffs that, by the looks of them, were not your standard police handcuffs.
“What! Is Peter okay?” Tony looked at Steve. His husband’s face was etched in concern, much like his own. Their son was the most precious thing to them in the entire multiverse. If something happened to him… “Was there an attack? Do I need to call Helen or-“
After a terrifying minute in which Tony could barely breathe, Justin removed the knife from Peter’s leg. “The guys and I will leave you two alone for a while. You’ll need some rest before our next session.”
Peter’s hold tightened as well, though not so much that Tony was uncomfortable. Quietly, in a barely audible whisper, he said, “the little ballerina girl.”
The temperature dropped drastically to the point where Rose could see her breath every time she exhaled and goosebumps formed on her skin. The heavy smell of adrenaline and fear hung around them as the tension continued to build.
The phone rang and rang, and rang. After it went to voicemail, he tried again. The second time it went to voicemail, he froze. A sudden thought struck him, sending chills down his spine and forcing his heart even further up his throat. He stepped away from his desk and called his fastest suit. “Mark forty-nine.” His suit molded to his form, and he blasted off into the night sky.
was, he needed to be fully coherent.
“Aggragify!”
The elderly wizard smiled broadly when he saw the little arachnid he had grown to love and care for so much. He opened his arms, and Peter didn’t hesitate to embrace him. “It’s so good to see you again, Peter.” He held onto the teen tightly; his subconscious fears of losing the young hero making his eyes water with unshed tears.
Peter didn’t say anything, just nodded and leaned further against the billionaire’s side. He loved team movie nights. And there was no way he’d pass off a chance to snuggle with his teammates, particularly his father-figure. Odin knows May never gave him any affection; unless you counted slapping and kicking as affection.
Both Avengers slumped back down into their seats, relief washing over them. Although Peter was one of the smartest, most powerful heroes they knew, the skinny teen still had a knack for getting into trouble. His uncle Sam called him a klutz while the rest of his family said he was too pure for his own good. Peter just called it Parker Luck.
“He’s a wizard,” Peter explained, “he’s a friend of Dr. Strange.”
“He probably can’t,” Sam crossed his arms. “Kid is probably just tryin’ to scare us.”
“Yeah.” Billy laughed. “She didn’t put up much of a fight. Screamed like crazy, though.” The cult broke out in boisterous laughs and cheers as if they had just won the lottery.
The first thing Peter registered upon waking up wasn’t the dull pain spreading throughout various parts of his body, not his gurgling stomach that clenched painfully every few seconds, or the fact that he was still chained to the floor in an abandoned warehouse. No. The first thing he discerned was Tony’s pained grunt and the gun pressed against his mentor’s temple.
“Oh, really.” Tony’s snapped. “What kind of guardian lets a kid’s parents abuse them and treat them like some feral beast?”
“Of course we do, Pete.” Tony moved around the granite island to sit beside his protégé and pulled him into another hug. Peter’s hair smelled like the green apple shampoo Tony had gotten him, knowing they both liked the scent of it.
****************
“We have a room ready.” Dr. Cho broke in; her demeanor was calm and professional as usual. She smiled gently when her eyes met Peter’s. “You can rest now.”
“Yes, sometimes.”
After a moment of pathetic stammering, Peter managed to stutter out a full sentence, his voice small and shaky. “I-I um… was at the-the in-internship. Mr. Stark needed my help with some Stark Industries tech.”
Both dads smiled wider at the next one. “Great hero and a great singer. You’re the best, Spider-Man.”
Before he could stop himself, Peter leaned into the touch, relishing in the warmth of Mary’s hand and the physical sign of affection. He knew there would be a punishment waiting for him and that this display of kindness was fake. But Peter couldn’t find it in himself to care because he craved this version of Mary; the kind words and soft touches. A mother. Not the cold scientist he was used to.
“Peter! Pete, buddy!” Tony pulled frantically at the chains keeping him locked to the disgusting floor. Only a few hours in, and Tony had already screamed his throat raw. His fingernails were split, and the tips of his fingers were coated in red from grabbing at the uneven cement floor in an attempt to pull himself forward.
“I see dead people!” Peter blurted loudly then immediately covered his mouth with both hands. He closed his eyes and groaned, mentally wishing he could go back in time and
The spirits would welcome him and accept him as one of their own. He could slip into the Unknown without a hint of difficulty and just… let go.
“It’s okay,” Peter said as he dropped down from the ceiling, landing silently on his feet. “‘M just getting ready to head out.”
“Oh, sure, Mr. Stark.” Peter stopped chopping to give his mentor his undivided attention.
“Ever since I was born.”
It was Tony who responded, voice tight. “Hold up. Friday is picking up some type of energy field. It’s all around the warehouse.”
Peter’s eyes glowed brightly, another animalistic snarl escaping his throat before he answered, voice echoing. “I am death.”
Song for this chapter is Monster by Willyecho
***********
Natasha kissed Peter’s forehead and smiled. “Oladushki, it is then.”
A piercing scream echoed throughout the otherwise unoccupied forest as the surgical tool turned weapon found its mark.
“I’m feeling a lot better. Thank you, Mr. Rogers.” Peter replied, not looking away from the herbs he was chopping as a garnish. Whenever he stayed at the Tower, he liked to help Steve, or Bucky and Natasha on occasion, cook dinner. It was something they bonded over, and Peter had learned a lot so far. Peter also loved hearing Steve talk about his life before the war, and all of the stories he had to tell.
*********
The funeral was a quiet affair. A small crowd attended despite the chill in the air, winter’s frigid temperatures biting at everyone’s fingers. Cumulonimbus clouds gathered in the sky above the congregation, darkening the somber event in a literal sense. May’s coworkers and friends attended, offering their respect to their fallen colleague and gave their condolences to the last remaining Parker.
Tony, hearing the truth of his husband’s words, calmed down and looked to Friday for confirmation. “Who or what is filming this?”
“Have you always felt this way?”
“I still feel bad.” Peter still wouldn’t look at him. After sobbing for a good two hours, he finally managed to calm down. But Peter clamped up almost entirely afterward. What he saw was horrible, to say the least, and he really didn’t want to talk about it.
Her plea went ignored. Peter effortlessly yanked Rose to her feet and threw her out the window. “Get out!”
****************
“So we should expect some magical spells and whatever else that crazy shit entails.” The billionaire mused, lips pursed. “Anything else?”
“Yes,” Hamir nodded sadly, “there’s a very ancient group of people known as the Knot who use the dark arts to trap and kill every viewer that crosses their path.” At the cult’s mention, Peter shivered and pushed himself impossibly closer to his father-figure and mother-figure. His movements didn’t go unnoticed by the group. “I fear that…” Hamir’s voice dropped two notes, his hand clenched into a tight fist as he pushed the dreaded words past his lips. “I fear they have finally detected Peter.”
A holographic screen appeared in front of them, showing a clear image of their son perched on a rooftop. He was looking out across the city skyline, his thin form illuminated by the sun that was just beginning to set. His mask was pulled up over his mouth and nose, and he was bobbing his head to some unknown beat, most likely a song Karen was playing through the speakers in his mask.
And that’s what hurt Tony the most. The realization that Peter was used to guns, criminals, and dangerous situations pierced his heart like a knife. Peter was only sixteen years old. He should be worried about girls, his grades, and hanging out with his friends. Not desensitized to the dangers that hero-work brought. But here they were, being held captive by unknown assailants traveling to an undisclosed location where who-knows-what would be waiting for them.
“Besides, I need to hide my identity.”
The cult members continued to laugh at and mock the teen in front of them. But they were so engrossed in their jeering that they neglected to notice the lights flickering above them or the drop in temperature.
Tony groaned, mentally kicking himself for his lack of preparedness. He knew from experience that bad guys often showed up when you least expected it. Hence, the necessity to always be prepared. Of course, that logic had been temporarily lost to him, which is why they were in their current predicament.
She stood up and effortlessly pulled Peter up so he was standing in front of her. He stood just an inch taller than her, and it made her smile. “You know that Tony, me, and the rest of the Avengers will always be here for you. No matter what.” She wrapped her arms around him, hugging him gently, her chin resting on his shoulder.
“Wha- h-how?” Crow looked between Rose, who was cowering behind an old barrel, and the teen in front of him. “That’s not possible! You ca-“
Peter didn’t know this, but Tony was building a case against May and planned on taking her to court to fight for custody. Pepper had already sent him adoption registration forms, which were on their way to be verified, and the Avengers were putting their various skills to use in obtaining records, documents, and evidence proving that May was unfit to care for a minor. They weren’t ready yet, but they would be soon.
Peter shuffled from foot to foot uncomfortably, not ready to confront his teammates. If there was one thing he hated most, it was being at the center of attention; whether he was Peter Parker or Spider-Man, it didn’t matter. Feeling people’s eyes on him was unnerving, his past experiences of being in the limelight unsavory. Typically, people only gave him attention if he did something wrong or if they were angry with him.
“You’ve been a lot quieter this past month.” She noted. “Not that you’ve ever been much of an extrovert.”
Rose couldn’t suppress the panicked gasp that escaped her when multiple shadowy figures started to emerge from the portal. Stalking closer and closer to her as the whispers only increased in speed and intensity.
Some one-shot sequels? Yes, no, maybe?
Tony sighed, a big grin on his face.
“Yeah, dad.” Peter nodded, ready to go back to the Tower, his new home.
Another kidnapper, with a bazooka strapped to his back, chuckled, “you two’ll be hidden well enough by the time they even realize you’re gone.”
“And that kid from the movie The Sixth Sense?” Rhodey asked, more amazed than afraid.
It was only Thursday, so he hoped he wasn’t asking on too short a notice.
Peter’s grip on the knife handle tightened to the point where he could hear the wood begin to splinter. “You mean me, their experiment.” He wouldn’t look at Tony and stopped cutting, the knife being squashed under his powerful grip.
“Alright, then.” She tapped her finger against her chin, trying to choose the best way to go about this. Eventually, she decided to start with broad questions, narrowing things down depending on what Peter’s answers were. “Is the month of October hard for you? And or Halloween?”
“So you’re saying there’s something after Peter?” Natasha moved to stand behind the chair where the two geniuses were seated and began running her fingers through Peter’s hair. She just needed to be near her baby boy.
“What kind of energy field?” Bucky asked.
There was a moment of silence before Peter opened his bedroom door, causing Tony to fall backward. Peter couldn’t help but laugh as he helped the billionaire to his feet, the surprised look on Tony’s face beyond funny. “Sorry ’bout that, Mr. Stark.”
“Well,” Peter continued, his demeanor just as dark as the portal, “I am going to show you hell.”
Justin chuckled. A maniacal, sadistic laugh that shook Tony to his core. He stood up slowly and sauntered over to Peter, who was curled up on his side, attempting to put pressure on his various wounds. “What have we talked about?” Justin screamed, making Peter jump. “Huh?” He kept eye contact with Tony as he dug the tip of his knife into Peter’s thigh, causing the boy to scream.
Peter shook his head. “You know I would never do that. Plus, there were civilians around. Someone could have gotten hurt. We need to wait for the team.”
“I had a vision last night,” Peter explained softly, “I’ve had them before… especially when they’re getting too close to me.”
“I love you, Peter.” Tony said with as much conviction as he could muster. He meant it with all of his heart, and he needed Peter to believe it. “I love you so much. You’re my kid. My son.”
Avoiding the actual question; a tactic Tony was familiar with, having used that tactic as a way to avoid questions from Pepper or Fury. “What happens when both you and your aunt are home at the same time?” He chose each word carefully, making sure to cover all of the bases so Peter couldn’t divert his response to anything else.
**********
“Yes, I am.” Hamir nodded. “Initially, I planned on going myself. But after conferring with some of my fellow wizards, I elected to meet with you all first.”
“Is it alright if I ask a few questions about May?” He asked, hopeful that he would get better results by asking politely. “You don’t have to answer if you don’t want to. And I promise I won’t push you, bud. I went too far earlier.”
Next chapter is the last. I also drew a picture of the wendigo from this chapter, and I’m going to try to upload it so you can see:) if I have time, that is.
“Because it is a big deal, Peter!” He snapped harshly, much harsher than he meant to.
Tony didn’t flinch once. Justin Hammer didn’t scare him; neither did the gun held to his head. He experienced plenty of similar situations in the past and was desensitized to most threats. What truly scared Tony was that Peter would be left alone with this psycho if he was killed. And there was no way Justin would let the teen go. No. Justin would continue to torment Peter, both physically and mentally. And that was a scenario Tony could not allow to happen.
This chapter takes place where the first left off. There's some cute momma spider and baby spider fluff so I hope you all enjoy it XD
“Friday,” he cleared his throat, willing the shakiness to go away. After a few deep breaths, he tried again. “Friday, station multiple suits at Ned’s and MJ’s homes,” Tony instructed his AI. “Tell me if any irregularities are recorded within a five-mile radius.”
“I’ve come into contact with a bunch of negative spirits before, some of which were vocal or lashed out. But she was just… different.”
Sorry for my nerd rant. But I needed to get that out. I hope you enjoy this chapter!
His consciousness began slipping away as the hunger, pain, and fatigue took hold once again. Dark spots danced across his vision, and he went under without a fight, the persistent loneliness in his chest disappearing along with his consciousness.
After what felt like hours of driving, the van eventually came to a halt, and the two heroes were roughly grabbed and removed from its bowls. Metal barrels, broken equipment, and trash littered the surrounding landscape. Peter looked around, trying to take in his surroundings as best he could. But the starless sky offered little to no light. Even with his enhanced eyesight, he could only make out vague shadows and figures. Ominous-looking cumulonimbus clouds started to gather, becoming a symbolic representation of the heroes’ situation.
“No.” Peter dropped out of Steve’s hold and backed away, his anxiety levels rising the more he thought about his aunt. He couldn’t stay even though he wanted to. The Tower was his home, the place where he felt safe and loved. But there was someone he needed to check on before he could allow himself to rest. “I… I can’t stay.”
What made the whole situation worse was that Peter’s life wasn’t much better now that he lived with his aunt, poverty and emotional tension affecting their every move. New York was expensive, and it was evident that the Parkers were very poor, the teen’s clothing weathered and worn; covered in holes, or poorly stitched up from previous tears. Even his shoes seemed to be more hole than shoe, the soles threatening to fall off with each step.
(See the end of the chapter for
Peter’s and the Avengers’ job was to make sure criminals like that got what they deserved. And Peter was not about to let Mr. Stark, his mentor, his father figure, die. Not after everything they had been through.
Natasha pursed her lips, unconvinced. “You sure, Милая?” (Sweetheart)
“Hey, kiddo.” Steve greeted the teen with a fond smile and a quick side hug. Gently though, so as not to hurt the seemingly fragile child. He couldn’t help but smile when Peter leaned into the hug, his entire body melting against the super-soldier’s side. “Is Nat making her famous Oladushki?” He asked after seeing Natasha standing by the stove, mixing some type of batter.
Peter’s dark chuckle had the warlock snapping his mouth shut immediately, the fear palpable in the stale air. With a wave of Peter’s hand, the wand Crow used splintered into a hundred pieces. Little particles of light flitted up from the wand’s remains before fading into nothing.
I based Mary Rivers off of Dorothea Puente. She was an American serial killer who killed 15 people but was rumored to have killed many more. Seriously, she was a piece of trash. (There's a really awesome Ghost Adventures episode on her. I highly recommend watching it.) However, Mary Rivers isn't old and is actually a good person.
“S-she was the-there.” He choked out as a few stray tears slid down his cheeks.
“Like what?”
Peter shoved the dazed billionaire to the floor when a barrage of gunfire exploded outside. The sound of guns firing and repulser blasts lasted for less than a minute before an eerie silence fell over them once again. Peter kept a firm hold on his mentor, not daring to move in case the fight started up again. There was another, much larger blast seconds later, and the massive front door flew off its hinges, sending a cloud of dust into the rafters above.
************************
Tony crossed his arms and pushed off the fridge with his hip, stepping closer to Peter. “I just feel like there’s more that you aren’t telling us.”
She quirked an eyebrow and huffed sarcastically, “right. And the sky isn’t blue.” MJ lightly touched her friend’s neck, her fingers ghosting over the barely-visible bruises. Bruises that looked like someone had dug their fingers into his skin. “Ned might be oblivious, but I’m not.”
This is one of the last “setting up” chapters. There’s some fluff because I’m a sucker for domestic Avengers.
That creeped Natasha out; she couldn’t deny that. The thought of having a ghost, who lived decades ago, know your name, and talk to you was just crazy. Not to mention terrifying. No wonder Peter’s anxiety was reading its ugly head.
“Pete…” Tony sighed, well aware of what was going through his kid’s head. “Don’t worry about th-“
He spun around to see two young teens walking out of a quaint corner-store cafe. Their hands were entwined, and they laughed as they walked, taking pleasure in the other’s company. As the boy, Peter, stepped closer, another wave of energy hit him.
“Whoever killed this guy had a key or was already in the club,” Thor continued, trying to outline his thought process to his boss.
“Nope. Did you?” Thor’s tone of voice changed from the deep and foreboding tone to a more lighthearted tone, “‘cause until I get a specific answer to that question, my loyalty’s with you.” he finished, his index finger pointing at Steve to emphasize his words.
“They’re with Clint at the beach. Surfing or something.”
What better way to celebrate their first Christmas together than with a proposal?
“Yeah, our bad. Sorry, Steve.”
Steve furrowed his eyebrows in confusion, “Are you saying I’m weird?”
“Quit busting our coconuts for five seconds, huh. We’re just trying to help,” Quill said, taking out what looked like a joint from his pocket.
In the struggle, one of the scientists activated one of the finished bomb prototypes causing the facility to be blown to smithereens. Clint and Natasha managed to round up most of the scientists and was out of the warehouse before the blast occurred. They only sustained minor injuries, scratches and bruises on their faces and bodies.
.” Steve murmured as he wiped down Ulysses’ face.
“Yeah right. What’s not to like?” Joe replied patting his bulging stomach.
(See the end of the chapter for
“The top contenders are said to be federal judges Anna Corrine Barnett of Pennsylvania, Tyrone Banks of New Hampshire, and Raymond Rutledge of Michigan. President Trump will reportedly choose his nominee…”
While there were some initial concerns on whether he’d be able to carry this pregnancy to term due to Tony’s advanced age (he’s old, he got it), the baby seemed to be hitting all the appropriate milestones. After the three month mark came and went and the probabilities of spontaneous miscarriage went down, everyone collectively breathed a sigh of relief. They were getting their pack baby after all.
“We’re Hawkeye,” Tony rolled his eyes at the name, “I mean the name of the band is Hawkeye. No one’s actually named Hawkeye. It’s like there’s no one named Jethro in Jethro Tull, you know.” Clint started to ramble on.
“Maybe if you had a picture of him alive? I’m good with faces, but only live ones.” Natasha replied serenely. “Perhaps you have a picture of him while he’s still alive.”
“Avengers assemble!” Bruce screamed into the panic button despite the lack of speaker on the button.
“Because they’ll take it without telling me if it means what I think it means.”
“What about this?” Bucky knelt, poking a matchbook at the feet of the victim, “D’Angelo’s. Ever heard of this place?”
A couple of hours later, Joe was lounging on the couch trying to throw cards at an upturned cap he placed a couple feet away from him. James was doing situps on the love seat next to him and counting the number of reps he’s done, when the back door slammed open, and the two men rushed to their default position of “watching” the football game. Joe turned the TV on and James pretended to read a magazine. Steve came into the house, his face and clothes splattered with paint. He was drinking water he retrieved from the refrigerator.
Steve woke up with the dawn as usual. His biological clock has long been trained to start with the sun after years of waking up at the crack of dawn for football practices. That day he woke up as usual, cocooned under soft warm blankets. In the cloudy haze of his mind, he registered the presence of another person in his bed. Whoever it was, they were warm to the touch and Steve felt a profound sense of contentment and warmth deep within him. He could stand to wake up to this feeling everyday, he thought as he drifted back to sleep. Deciding to chase after that feeling, Steve moved closer to the other person until he could feel the soft bristles of their hair brushed against his cheek as they finally shared one pillow. Steve decided to sleep in for today, it was Saturday after all.
I'm so sorry for being AWOL, you guys.
“Congratulations, Sir. You have achieved the first recorded controlled thermonuclear fission in modern history.”
Steven nodded. “I remembered a time when I was a little boy when I was so sickly and frail. I contracted every disease in existence, there was never a time I was healthy enough to go and play outside with the other children. My parents thought I wouldn’t live past fifteen, she was already preparing my funeral pyre. But one of my siblings stepped in and healed me and at great risk to himself, because of Hera’s insistence that no Olympian interferes in any of her affairs lest they risk her wrath. So I was healed and I was able to survive to adulthood and now here I am.”
Tony laughed at his antics, “Yeah they’re extra greasy now. All that spam grease mixed in there with the motor oil.”
It all started with an off hand comment from Clint, like everything weird always did. That morning it was just the two in the kitchen, eating breakfast. Steve, Natasha and Sam were off on a mission out of the country, while Bruce, Thor and Bucky were still sleeping. Tony was feeding Ulysses and talking to him in Italian, because he wanted Ulysses to grow up just like he did: speaking his Mother’s mother tongue. Clint was playing on his phone, a bowl of cereal and orange juice in front of him.
“This is more Clint’s domain than mine. I prefer the solitude and greenery of the Grecian forests.”
Steve fell to the ground as Thor used Mjolnir to flip over a taxi and send it flying to the Chitauri brigade that attacked them, ultimately incapacitating them. Steve tried to get up, using his shield to lift himself up but his legs gave up under him. Thor grabbed his arm and helped him back up.
Steve stared flatly at him, “Tony, you build your reputation on defying societal expectations of what an omega should and shouldn’t do. You’ve been waiting on a chance to scandalize those society magazines and giving them the middle finger with this double date.”
“When did you realize it wasn’t me?” Steve asked his mate as they walked into Tony’s office, closing the door behind them.
Steve’s eyes widened in surprise, “Black-- are you serious? Goddammit, Clint.”
“For God’s sakes, Barton.”
“Hush...need to take your clothes off,” Steve hurriedly stripped Tony of his dress shirt, flinging it off the bed not caring where it lands. Once he has his mate naked under him, Steve ran his hands down Tony’s torso, admiring his mate’s smooth olive skin and toned body. “So beautiful, Tony. My beautiful mate,” he leaned down and they started kissing again. Tony opened up so beautifully to him, his Omega was always so responsive to his touches. Steve was humbled and awed once again at the thought of this beautiful creature choosing him to be his mate and bearing his marks.
“See, I told you, you just had to take a leap. He totally likes you too, there was a zero to none chance of you being rejected by Jamie. Am I good on the matters of the heart, or am I good?”
He did, much to the consternation of his balls.
“You’re ridiculous,” Steve rolled his eyes fondly. The light in her eyes was back which Steve was grateful for. Lately he’d been noticing how easily her moods shifted, one second happy then the next some words or some gesture would take away from her playful countenance. He tried to talk to her about it, but Natasha just shook her head and kissed him softly, whispering softly that everything was fine, yes everything was fine. It pained Steve to see her so troubled, even more so when it was trouble he couldn’t punch in its face or knock down with his shield.
“If you’re not pregnant, then you win the rights to decide what we see on movie nights. I won’t even protest about watching Firefly again for the thousandth time. But if you are pregnant, I reserve the right to take pictures of you when you cry at a shamwow commercial
With St. Patrick’s Day coming and going, Easter was the next holiday to come around. And honestly, Tony had been expecting this conversation in awhile. It just didn’t mean he was completely psyched to have it.
Natasha opened her mouth to answer him but something stopped her. The happiness in her eyes dimmed slightly before she gave Steve a tremulous smile, “Yeah, darling. We will someday. I’ll play something slow so you won’t step on my feet.” She seemed far away, as if reassuring herself of the truthfulness of her words.
“What do you think it means?”
” Peter greeted them, swiping an apple from a fruit bowl on the counter for a snack later on the field trip.
“No, wait!” Tony interrupted them.
“You’re doing more than that. You are Tony Stark of Stark Industries aren’t you?” Steve said.
Clint and Quill exchanged alarmed looks on their faces. Tony was more out of it than they thought.
“I’m starting to regret that,” he mumbled under his breath and poured a cup of the decaf. He snuck a look at Ulysses and felt that regret fade away. Anything and everything, that’s his motto when it came to his boy.
Tony pulled him up from the chair and settled him on his hip. They went back up to the common room where it was blessedly quiet, for once, the guys have stopped playing Rock Band and was now off at God knew where. Tony cleaned up Joe then went downstairs to the garage and load Joe up in the minivan. Once done, Tony hopped in to the driver’s seat and head off to Ulysses’ kindergarten.
Tony and Steve looked at each other, debating whether or not they should start explaining developmental biology and genetics to their 4 year old.
------
“Yeah.”
Steven nodded in acknowledgment. Hearing Anthony’s life story was enlightening to say the least. He wasn’t under the impression that Anthony’s life as a crown prince was smooth sailing and without hardship. Everyone had different paths and problems to go through in their life. It would be disingenuous of Steven to assume otherwise. He placed his hand on Anthony’s, squeezing it for reassurance. Kind blue eyes gazed into vulnerable golden brown ones and for the first time in his life, Anthony felt comforted and safe.
“So Tony, what do you do?” Steve asked, eager to start a conversation with Tony.
Steven and Anthony jolted upwards and scrambled away from each other at Clint’s obnoxious voice. When they looked up, there he was, the God of Sun just a couple of feet away from them, looking harried and for all the world like he was annoyed Steven didn’t tell him, he was still alive.
“Yeah.”
“I got interrupted.”
“So do I.” Tony said solemnly.
“I don’t know who you are, Tony. But I dreamed about you every night. Every night when I fall asleep, I see your face. I see us doing things I don’t remember ever doing before. Why?” Steve’s soft baritone washed over him, imploring Tony to have an answer to his question.
“What happened, Steven?” Anthony asked with trepidation in his voice.
“Of course, Tony. We’ll get Ulysses in bed with us, too. It’ll be a prolonged slumber party.”
“As you wish.” Steve swept him up in a bridal carry and carried him all the way to their bed where they cuddled and did other things until they both fell asleep.
Steve frowned, “What was he doing on tv? Is that why you had an attack?”
Fury chuckled as he went through the evidence Sharon has compiled for them, “A mobster named Brock. What’s the world coming to?” Tony chuckled along with him, surprised at the small smile that Fury managed to coax out of Sharon as well.
Like every little boy in America, Tony grew up idolizing Captain America. He was the perfect role model. Captain America was brave, righteous. He was patriotic and he would do what was right for the country and for everyone. Captain America was everyone’s hero. And until he felt like his dad liked Cap more than Tony, he was Tony’s hero too. Tony wanted to be just as good and noble as Cap. His Cap action figure was his favorite toy, he never went anywhere without it. And someday, he wanted to have a love story like Cap and Aunt Natasha. Minus the tragic separation by death, of course. But he wanted that certainty, that devotion to and from someone and being so in love that you’d willingly sacrifice your life because life was just too unbearable to live through without them at your side.
In his heart of hearts, Tony thought that Steve would have sided with him. Cap’s lover was his Aunt Natasha, who single handedly revolutionized particle physics, and who if only the Nobel committee didn’t adhere to the stupid rule of not awarding the Nobel posthumously would be the second woman ever to win the Nobel prize in Physics after Marie Curie.
“No, it’s not the baby. It’s just-- It’s--” Tony stuttered out with eyes still tightly shut. Finally he released a loud gust of breath and rapidly blurting out “yourballsmakemenauseous.”
“Uh-huh,” Steve shook his head, sipping on his coffee, “We got the Crew.”
. Still here, still with you. Still around to drive you crazy by stealing your ties and socks.”
“It’s certainly grand. A grand gesture.” Steve answered diplomatically, “Gonna be hard to top that. How are we going to fit it in the house?”
“Boys, be nice.” Tony cautioned, rolling his eyes at his boys’ antics. Steve chuckled at Joe and Peter trying to one up each other with their inventions.
“Soon.” the prince whispered to him, his smile wicked and endearing at the same time. Steven shivered at the promise and the thought of having Anthony for himself for the rest of his life.
“It’s okay. It’s all okay, Steve.” Tony said, then to Bucky he said, “Thank you. You’ve helped us. Now, please, let us help you.” Tony reached forward, holding his hand up for Bucky to give his gun to him. Bucky slowly placed his disarmed gun in Tony’s hand, which Tony gave to Sharon who had lowered her gun when a civilian walked right into her line of fire.
How do you stand so tall when you bear the weight of the world and humanity your shoulders?
“Come on, Tasha. I’m not that bad,” Steve joked, “the serum would help me learn the steps.”
Or until they decided to take another picture to reflect the new addition to their family two years later.
As he turned around, he saw Sit Well approaching him and walking up to the center stage. As he came closer to Steve, he leaned in and whispered, “My brother would like to talk to you. He’s waiting out back.”
Once Ulysses was satisfied enough with playing at the park and tired out, Tony ushered him back to the minivan, buckled him up and drove back to the Tower. Since it was time for his afternoon snack, Tony gave Ulysses a bag of Goldfish crackers for him to munch on. On their way home, Tony started to hear cooing sounds from the backseat and saw that Ulysses was trying to share his afternoon snack with his little brother.
Father Vincent looked ready to laugh too, “And all his works?” he continued on.
“Can we please hurry this up? Downton Abbey starts in, like, 5 minutes?” Happy implored them.
He started to hand his phone over to Loki before retracting it, “I’ll show you the picture but only if you drop the accent.” Loki nodded in acquiescence, his right hand held up waiting for Phil to hand over his phone. “Take a look.”
“Okay.” then Natasha proceeded to empty everything in her pockets, which included knives, guns, brass knuckles and lighters and bullet magazines. The TSA agent looked shocked. To be fair, Natasha was wearing a sundress with no pockets in sight.
Tony has just emerged from a twenty-five hour bender in the workshop, working on the latest update for the StarkPhone, StarkPad and debugging the B.A.R.F code. The rest of the Avengers have long started their daily activities: Bruce should be in his lab with Thor, Natasha and Bucky are out exploring Manhattan in an attempt to get Bucky caught up in the 21st century (although Tony suspects those two are actually going on a date) and Steve would be in his studio or still out running with Sam. Only Clint was still in the Penthouse’s common floor when he arrived, sprawled out on the couch eating a bowl of cereal and watching CBS.
Tony willed his heart to beat slowly and sat on the booth opposite from Adonis, making sure he sat far away from the Japanese grandpa that sassed him yesterday and closer to Adonis’ booth.
“Oh, I must have missed that,” Steve acknowledged, “Well I’ll take you up on that. Maybe we can grab some dinner while we’re at it.”
“Your mate wants to put your newborn baby in a cutest babies contest.” Rhodey answered for him.
“Wilson’s brother. Head of the gangbangers.” Thor answered. He cocked the hammer of his gun and pointed it at the man, “don’t move, or I’ll blow your head off.”
“Knock yourself out.”)
“I don’t think so,” the TSA agent insisted, “the partial prints came back as his. And this picture more than proves it.” He placed a mug shot of a man that looked almost like Bucky. If he didn’t shave and let his hair grow again like he used to do when he was younger.
“Okay, Babbo, Papa.”
“Psh. Bring it, Bird brain.”
anything, because Zeus still sounded like a scumbag if Steven’s stories were to be believed. And Anthony was more than inclined to believe him more than anyone in his life.
“Who do you work for that could scare off AIM and the gangbangers?” Tony asked.
“I’m glad,” Steven smiled and brought Anthony’s hand in his hold up to his lips to kiss his knuckles, much to Anthony’s delight, “I only ask because I will do what you wish in a heartbeat, but I need you to know the situation I will be bringing you in if you do come away with me.”
But Steve stood by his decision. You couldn’t build a house on shoddy foundation, and you couldn’t build a relationship based on lies. If Tony couldn’t forgive him after this, then…
“Controlled thermonuclear fission aren’t feasible because the fulfilments of the Lawson criteria remain unachievable on Earth.”
I know someday you'll have a beautiful life. I know you'll be a star in somebody else's sky. But why can't it be mine?
“Just that when I woke up this morning, this was not how I pictured my day would go,” Tony smiled deprecatingly, “finally getting the guy of my dreams, finding out my parents were actually murdered by a HYDRA assassin who happened to be my guy’s brainwashed friend from back in the day. I feel like my life just became something out of a Lifetime movie.”
Steve was more than happy to oblige. There were times when he would put on a show for Tony. And on those times, the suit up duration would always be exponentially longer because they would get sidetracked with making out. Most times, it was Tony helping him suiting up, handing him the body armor or one of his gloves, eyes hooded with desire the whole time. Steve would only be able to barely resist and the rest was history.
Tony closed his eyes, willing the tears he’s holding back from dropping. He leaned his forehead against Steve and whispered, “I love you too. So much. That’s why I don’t want…”
They took their sandwiches and moved to the living room where Thor was still sitting on the couch, this time staring despondently at the television, Princess Peach still in the same position she was in when Steve first entered the kitchen.
“You didn’t see this guy last night?” Bucky asked again. Once again, Tony shook his head.
“Umm, I had some coffee. And my nephew’s Reese’s peanut butter cups,”
He shook Tony awake, hoping to spare him the pain of nightmares. Tony woke up and with him waking up, the mark 42 that previously greeted Steve on his arrival home was suddenly in his face, grabbing his throat and pinning him down to bed, a sentinel guarding Tony against any and all threats.
“The only reason we’re representing the school was because Joe and Peter aren’t in the Science Olympiad team and would be in DC for the Decathlon.” Jamie elaborated.
“Tony, you need to settle down,” a hand was pushing back, urging him to lay back down on the bed. Tony fought it, batting it away and scooting forward to get off from the bed. “Tony, seriously, stay down. You don’t want to make me angry.”
Steve cornered him in the precinct’s break room, in the process of trying to fuel up on more crappy coffee for the day. Well, caffeine’s caffeine, can’t really complain much. Bucky knew what Steve and Tony were here to ask for. At least, he knew that Tony would be trying his damnedest to get his partner to let him reopen the bar. Bucky’s brother-in-law was as relentless as a dog with a bone, just like Steve. Maybe that’s why they fit together so well.
Tony was silent for a while fiddling with the straw stuck in his water cup. Steve looked at him intently. His blue eyes, as bright as the Hawai’ian sky exuded understanding and empathy. Tony felt like he could spill everything in his heart to this man and still talked some more.
“Trying to solve how to overcome the energy barrier needed to fuse two atoms together. If I can do it, then the arc reactor technology is basically complete.” Steve’s awestruck and amazed face would always be one of Tony’s expression he saw on Steve’s face. Other than his orgasm face of course. Steve looked so beautiful when he finally reaches completion.
“Wow, really? We’re getting a new nephew?”
“What does that supposed to mean?”
Black’
“I bet he fakes a pass at Odell and throws a pass at Gallmann at the End Zone. Loser does the dishes?” Bucky challenged, ignoring the look Joe directed at him.
They all gasped in unison.
(See the end of the chapter for
And just like that, Tony’s heart stopped.
“Is the response an enthusiastic ‘yes’?” Anthony grinned up at Steven.
The visions actually started when he was sixteen years old, right after his birthday. That day he threw a big party, much to Rhodey’s disapproval, one last bash before final exams and everyone made their way home for the summer. To say that Tony drank too much and took too much ecstasy that night would be an understatement. It was a night of firsts: the first time Tony and his then boyfriend Ty Stone had a threesome, and the first time he wasn’t completely in control of his faculties and was unable to firmly say yes or no, to anything they did that night.
Would the same thing happen if he and Jamie were to mix like sulphuric acid and water? There’s only one way to find out.
“Thank you,” Joe murmured to him.
“And your mother never told you about him?”
It was almost 5 AM in the morning when Tony Stark finally came home. His mate was sleeping soundly in their bed, but wakes at the sound of their bedroom door opening. He has always been a light sleeper, Tony notes. His years in the military taught him to wake at the drop of a hat. Tony took of his loafers and his black blazer as he enters the room, unceremoniously dropping them on the floor, then his slacks follows. His mate will probably grouse and complain at him in the morning about their room being an unkempt mess, but right now Tony has better things to do than worry about properly disposing his clothes in the laundry basket.
At first, he wanted to go back to the Malibu estate. The California sun would do him good. Plus, he hadn’t been there in forever and he quite missed the cliffside estate with its floor-to-ceiling glass walls that let in natural lights. His workshop in Malibu was also stocked with everything he needed to tinker and invent new techs for SI. After his health scare, he saw how arcane the field of biomedical engineering was and how sub par medical devices that are currently on the market are. Once again the world needed Tony Stark to show them the way. So it looked like he had a new task to revolutionize the field of medical technology. This hiatus from the corporate world would also hopefully give him a chance to work on his magnum opus: the arc reactor technology.
“Oh God…” Natasha whispered, calling out for a God she didn’t believe in but helpless not to, “Steve…”
what ‘little’ means.”
Steven chuckled at Anthony’s words, “She’s Maria.”
“You mean, Thor?”
Dad talked a lot about how good and brave Cap was, but he never talked about Steve. What Steve would do if he were presented with a moral dilemma. What Steve would think about the Gulf War. What Steve would think about Stark Industries, getting bigger and bigger on selling weapons, benefiting on the fact that there would always be war. Would Steve approved of the way Howard, and later Tony, conduct business? What would Steve think about the military industrial complex? Would he think it’s a good idea to put everything into weapons development, like Dad and Obie did? Or would he side with Tony and push them to diversify their portfolio to include medical devices, intelli-crops and renewable energy?
As for his other project, the one he started since he had his recurring nightmares all those months ago, well that’s another story.
Steve drove his motorcycle up the winding road leading up to Tony’s Malibu mansion. When Tony said that he needed to go back to California, because that was where he actually lived, it was no question that Steve would be following him there. There was nothing keeping him in New York, sadly, and there was no way in hell he would be living clear across the country from his partner.
Outside, he saw two people standing beyond his door: his brother Bucky Barnes and a woman he assumed was Bucky’s partner at the NYPD, Detective Sharon Carter.
“Yesterday, me and Uncle Sam were watching cartoons. And then-- then the Powerpuff Girls came on. And they were so cool, Babbo! They’re little, like me and Joe, but they have super powers, just like you and Papa and the ‘Vengers! Uncle Sam said that real men watch Powerpuff Girls.”
“You’ll be fine. Take it down the Nu’uanu Pali for a spin. You’re the best mechanic in the world. You know that car inside and out. What’s the worst that could happen?” Natasha encouraged him.
“What, really?”
Steve cleared his throat, and looked back to Tony tearing his gaze away from the blue lights of the holograph, “So how’s your head?”
“Ugh, this is the worst part of being pregnant. Not getting to have caffeine.” Tony grumbled.
“Ugh,” Tony groaned, “you push…” He moaned pathetically.
Steve scooted over to him, letting him see their youngest son for the first time and transferring the baby from his hold to Tony’s. He took Natasha’s place behind Tony, letting Tony leaned his body on Steve’s “Hi, baby.” Tony whispered reverently, “it’s so good to finally meet you, sweetheart.”
“Well, there you go. Spend some time together, get to know each other again. Ending things seem a bit hasty, don’t you think?” Steve turned towards Tony who was eating his lunch, avoiding Steve trying to make eye contact with him and for once in his life, absent of witty quips, commentaries and things to say. Thanks a lot, Tony.
“That’s my Papa!” Ulysses proudly proclaimed to the crowd, before Tony could prevent him from blurting it out. The gathered people clearly thought Ulysses was joking, though, and just laughed at him, dismissing his claims as a joke.
“What’s going on?” Steve heard and felt Tony came up behind him as his mate placed his hand on the small of Steve’s back. He was wearing Steve’s dress shirt , the one he threw into the laundry bag yesterday, and nothing else. Tony had a penchant for wearing Steve’s used clothes, he said it made him feel more comfortable surrounded by Steve’s scent. And also Tony knew how much he affected Steve by strutting around looking like he’s Steve’s in Steve’s borrowed clothes. But that didn’t mean Steve was okay with letting other people get a glimpse of Tony’s body.
“Thank you, JARVIS. It’s good to be home,” Steve greeted back. It still amazed him after all these months living with Tony just how lifelike JARVIS sounded. Another testament to the genius of Tony Stark, “It went as well as we would have expected.” Which was to say it went to shit in the first five minutes, but Steve wasn’t a master strategist for nothing.
“I do.” Bucky answered for him.
“My tower, my rules,” Tony gasped out.
Anthony watched from the safety of the cliff as Steven, handsome, kind hearted and shrouded in mystery, engaged Cetus in battle. It was clear that Steven was no mere mortal, his ability to rip apart the chains binding Anthony to the boulder like they were made of dried tree root instead of steel was testament to that fact. He had to be a demigod, a son to one of the Olympians. Which one, Anthony did not know, nor did he cared much for it. The way Steven treated him and his actions impressed Anthony more than his lineage. Of course Anthony was impressed by the immaculate beauty and charisma he exuded, but such matters were skin deep. Steven’s courteous and respectful manner and the way he blushed so prettily in the face of Anthony’s flirtations intrigued him more. When he realized that Anthony had a plan, regardless of how futile it was in the face of Cetus’ grandness, he didn’t run roughshod or belittle his plans. He politely told Anthony that he had a better one and asked (
“Tony,” Steve shot him a look of annoyance, and Tony placated him by pressing a light kiss to the corner of his lips. “What are you guys talking about?”
“How can anyone not know?” Sam piped in. Ulysses and Joe were on a Disney phase, which meant they have been forced to watch Disney movies, from the classics all the way to the new ones. They’ve had to watch Frozen more than most because both Uly and Joe were fascinated with the snow, much to Steve’s dismay, although Tony had successfully transitioned them to slowly letting go of Frozen and moving on to Moana. It was the better of the two movies anyway.
Sorrowful, numb, disheartened, somber, remorseful. No adjective could be used to accurately describe the extreme guilt that hovered over him like a black cloud, clinging to his person with no intention of releasing him anytime soon.
Just as her fingers touched the binding of a large red book, someone grabbed her outstretched arm and roughly threw her backward.
“Now, now, Stark.” Justin tisked, looking down at the billionaire condescendingly. He wiped the bloody knife he was holding on his shirt as he approached his old rival. Crouching down in front of him, Justin smirked. “I gave Petey the choice of who gets martyrized.” He nodded towards the injured teen, without a hint of remorse. “And he chose himself. Why I don’t know.”
And through the dizziness that threatened to pull him to the floor, the physical ache that reached his bones, and the gargantuan weight of guilt tearing him apart from the inside, all Tony could think was, I deserve this.
, and Natasha led Peter into the large, open-concept kitchen on the first communal floor. She guided him towards the granite island and sat him down on one of the tall bar stools, subtly making eye contact with Steve, who was standing in the archway between the lounge area and the kitchen talking to Tony.
“Pepper and Michael are away for their first wedding anniversary so Tony won’t be scheduled for any meetings. And unless an Avengers level threat pops up, no one will be away on any missions.” She smirked. “So you’ve got all of us to deal with, kid.”
“Hello, Captain.” Hamir greeted kindly. He looked much more tired than the last time he visited, his face wrinkled in concern. Dark bags had taken residence below his eyes that no longer held the youthful spark shining they once contained. The wizard was undoubtedly a century or more old, but only now was he finally starting to look his age.
He didn’t want Tony, or anyone else for that matter, to see him as a charity case. But he couldn’t help but feel relieved to have one less weight on his shoulders. Now, he didn’t need to hunt for food this week. Hesitantly, Peter stepped forward and wrapped his arms around Tony’s neck, holding onto him loosely in case Tony wanted to pull away, not one for physical affection.
“And you- do you think they found you?”
It didn’t take long for the vigilante to grow on the heroes. Only after a month of knowing him, they were absolutely smitten and understood what Tony had meant when he said the kid was adorable. Peter was empathetic, selfless, a genius, and an extremely powerful mutant who risked his life daily to save people. Now, a year and a half later, after completing dozens of missions, field operations, training exercises, movie nights, and everyday activities accompanied by the vigilante, the Avengers considered Peter a teammate and a family member. They would die for him.
Steve mock saluted then went about cleaning and cutting the fresh fruit, careful to remove all of the stems. He put the prepared strawberries in a sizable white bowl that matched with the rest of the tableware and put it on the island in front of Peter. The pancakes were ready about five minutes later, the delicious smell wafting around the large room.
He went to knock, but the door fell open with ease. A red flag. The suit molded to his form with a silent command, and Tony entered the apartment cautiously. The sight that befell his eyes was gruesome. Most surfaces had blood splattered on them, and a large crimson stain coated the carpet. May was sitting in an armchair, a gaping hole in her throat straight through her carotid artery.
Peter took a hesitant step inside, prepared to fight whoever had so-obviously broken into the apartment. What, or rather who, he saw crushed any hopes he had of saving his aunt.
Peter stuck by him because he saw Tony as his father and would do anything for him.
“Hamir told me to be careful. To use my powers sparingly in order to remain hidden from them.”
“I um… I can t-talk to spirits. An-and get rid of them.” He met Tony’s gaze for about three seconds before ducking his head to look at the floor some more, studying the intricate patterns in the wood grain. “I also have, um, Telekinetic powers.”
Another person said, “I’ll grab the quinjet. Keep him conscious.”
“Yes.”
Rose advanced towards the meta that killed her family but halted abruptly. Peter was drained of most of his energy. That much was obvious. But she couldn’t underestimate him. She wouldn’t make that same mistake twice. Her arms drooped, and the hatchet made a resounding thunk as the metal hit the floor. It wouldn’t do her any good to rush into a fight, her friend’s deaths a glaring warning against that route. Instead, she elected for a verbal assault. With how injured and worn out Peter was, it would only be a matter of time before his body gave out. She just needed to drag things out and hold onto the hope that Peter would fall.
“You don’t need to apologize, Mr. Stark.” Peter smiled tiredly. The cuffs around his thin wrists were much too tight, and he knew that he could break them easily. But Peter didn’t destroy them because he could not give his identity away. These people, whoever they were, didn’t seem to know he was Spider-Man, and Mr. Stark always told him to hide his secret identity no matter what.
Natasha ran her delicate fingers through the honey-brown curls tickling her cheek. Everyone loved those adorable curls, never passing up the chance to pet or ruffle them. “I won’t force you to talk about it. But you know it’s only going to hurt more if you keep everything bottled up inside.”
“Peter has not been harmed, nor is he in any danger.”
Some organizations would do just about anything to get their hands on a powerful mutant like Peter. And Tony didn’t want any HYDRA wannabes to find him.
As the argument spurred to life, no one took notice that the lights throughout the kitchen, dining room and lounge began to flicker. Their power being drained by the young meta unknowingly.
Turning his attention back to his phone to check whether any work emails needed his attention, he settled back on his seat at the counter. For awhile he immersed himself in quarterly reports, the results from the latest arc reactor simulation using the new parameters he specified, an email from Pepper reminding him to sign off on the sale of the Howard’s old storage facility in New York. Then something shiny hit his eyes.
“I’ve been trying to propose to Tony! And you people keep ruining the moment with “going to jail,” to Sam, Clint and Bucky,  “and fighting with other kids, albeit for justifiable reasons” to the boys, “and losing your own baby because you were too busy arguing about which of your alter egos your mate was more attracted to.” to Bruce and Thor. “Tony and I never had a bonding ceremony. We had a shotgun bonding at a city hall, and afterwards we were too busy building up the Avengers after SHIELD dissolved. And we just...just never had time to stop and properly celebrate our relationship.”
Tony woke up with a horrified gasp. His amber eyes flickered back and forth, trying to take in his surrounding though in his panicked and frightened state of mind he couldn’t register anything too much. JARVIS’ soothing baritone immediately filled the air.
Suddenly the space between them seemed to vast for Steve. He needed to hold Tony in his arms, assured him of his love. “Tony, can I-- can I hold you?”
“The victim has been identified as Brock Rumlow.” the detective said, sliding the picture towards their direction. Tony accepted it, glancing at the picture then handing it to Steve for his own perusal.
“Captain America, perhaps not. But Steve Rogers is just an Alpha madly in love with his Omega and would do anything to get back in his good graces.”
Eighteen years. Eighteen years of blissful mating with Tony. Even after all these years, some days he still woke up amazed and had to pinch himself to make sure he wasn’t dreaming, wasn’t trapped in the dreamscape he saw all those years ago where he and Tony were bar owners and the rest of the Avengers were their employees. Waking up and seeing Tony’s face next to him, the beloved face that looked so peaceful in sleep, beautiful and so full of life and warmth upon waking, was one of the greatest pleasures of his life. Raising a family and growing old with him was another.
“Barton, get over here. I wanna get out of this monkey suit yesterday.” Bucky told him, “the sooner we finished this the better for everyone.”
“I want a baby brother again.”
“JARVIS, can you please put the lights at ten percent?”
“Uh, um,” Tony stammered, “You could just kiss me through the mouth slit, y’know.”
“No Jarvis, no DJ. No DJ, no entertainment.” he sat down in front of Clint, “Time to
“I’m always up for biscuits and gravy, Papa!”
“Tony?” a deep, smooth baritone pulled him out of his reverie. When he looked up through the glass walls of his workshop, he saw Steve standing outside the door by the stairs, his hand raised in a wave. JARVIS must have put him on speaker.
Hazy and unfocused eyes locked onto the figure crouched down in front of him. The voice sounded familiar. Very familiar. But Peter’s spider-sense was on high alert, and pain was clouding his mind, messing with his perception. He began to struggle, using what little strength he had to move away from the hand that was touching him.
“You were right, though, Pete. I… I hurt you in so many ways, and I never even realized it.” He wiped his face with his sleeve, removing some of the salty tears slipping down his cheeks. Looking away, he murmured, “I really am a shitty mentor, aren’t I?”
“Absolutely stunning!” One comment read.
I hope you enjoy it!
“Rose!” Snakebite Andy was the first to reach the injured woman. Her eyes widened in alarm at the charred skin on Rose’s right forearm. “Your arm!”
“I know.” Steve kept his eyes peeled for a weak spot in the force field or some other type of opening that would allow him and his team inside. But he found none. “I don’t… I can’t find a way in.”
“Pete, I-“ he massaged his temples, feeling a stress headache begin to form. “I think it’s safe to assume that you don’t want to have a full-on conversation, so… questions?”
Everyone’s primary concern was Peter’s current mental state. It wasn’t the first time he was kidnapped or tortured or in need of immediate medical attention. Hero work and having the Avengers as your family guaranteed all types of dangerous situations. It wasn’t anything new.
Peter’s grip tightened, a fury lighting up his eyes as he snapped, “you will leave now.”
“This is it, Stark.” Justin snarled, a delighted grin nearly splitting his face in two.
“Shield disintegrated after that bitch died.” Someone growled.
. Them being Hamir, a close friend, and May, the only other living Parker.
“Oh thank goodness.” Steve clasped a hand to his chest while the other reached for Tony’s. “I’m so glad he’s okay.”
Bucky, above all people, knew how Peter was feeling. “Do you get what I’m saying?”
Oladushki, otherwise known as Russian pancakes, was one of Peter’s favorite foods, so Natasha tried to make them for him whenever he visited. Seeing Peter eat and his beautiful smile was well worth the effort.
Tony desperately needed to hear the kid’s voice. Even if Peter just continued to scream and berate him, Tony didn’t care. Peter had always grounded him, and he needed that more than ever right now.
Crow was next. The warlock fired off spell after spell; each one meant to incapacitate the mutant he was fighting. “Alarte Ascendare! Petrificus Totalus! Stupefy! Sectumsempra! Expelliarmus!” But Peter dodged or deflected each spell and incantation, unfazed by the magic. Crow continued to back up until his back hit one of the mold-covered walls of the warehouse. He whimpered in fear as Peter closed in. In one last desperate attempt to stop his attacker, Crow screamed, “Avada Kedavra!”
“Yes.” Steve rolled his eyes. Despite being adults, his teammates sure could be childish at times. He was grateful that Peter was so mature and polite for his age. “About ten more minutes.”
“There’s nothing wrong with taking out a greedy psychopath.” Sam agreed. “He probably woulda just killed even more people had you let him go.”
Logically, Peter knew his surroundings weren’t unlike the other kidnappings he experienced. During patrol, crime often drew him to dilapidated buildings in the more seedy parts of Queens, and Avenger missions occasionally led them to abandoned military bases that were nothing short of scary.
“About ten minutes ago.” Natasha continued typing away on her laptop while she spoke, her eyebrows furrowed in concentration. Hacking was one of her many specialties, which came in handy when the team needed traffic camera footage. “But it cut off almost as soon as we received it. Friday locked onto the location where it came from.”
“Mr. Sta-“ Peter’s throat felt so dry, causing his voice to crack. Clearing his throat, he tried once again to get the mechanic’s attention. “Mr. Stark.” He squeezed the larger hand gently, hoping it would help pull the man back into consciousness. “Mr. Stark, are you okay?”
“The Knot. A group of ancient people who keep themselves alive by feeding off of people like me. People who have psychic powers and or a sixth sense.”
“You know about Peter.” It wasn’t a question. The guy was a magical wizard; of course, he would know that Peter had been kidnapped. Why else would he be here?
“You killed Hammer to save me, Pete.” Tony did his best to reassure Peter that he hadn’t done anything wrong. But he knew Peter would still feel guilty.
“Are you ready, Steve?” Natasha asked from the pilot’s seat, her black catsuit armed with various weapons, the famous Black widow bites adjourned her wrists.
Peter goes home to his aunt and some unexpected and not so unexpected things happen.
Steve and Natasha did their best to clean and dress any wounds Tony and Peter obtained during their kidnapping. Being Avengers, they were well versed in first aid and could treat just about any injury. But they knew that Bruce and Helen would be better equipped to address their medical needs. Peter needed an IV for intravenous nutrients to keep his body from shutting down and would need stitches for his deeper cuts until his healing factor kicked in from the nutrients. Tony, on the other hand, could get by with some gauze and a few butterfly bandages. The small injuries he obtained were in no way life-threatening.
And May… his last living relative. The only other Parker left… was dead. And it was his fault. He had failed to protect her. It seemed that Parker luck would never release its grip on him.
“He told me that the Knot uses incantations and dark magic, picking up random spells along the way. They use them to incapacitate their victims.” Peter thought back to the visions he had in the past; snapshots of pain, fear, and torment. The little ballerina girl came to mind. Her tear-filled eyes glazing over as death wrapped his arms around her, pulling her soul from her physical body.
“Does she… does she not like that you’re a mutant?”
Natasha was the first to recover, anger painting her features. She sent Tony a look that could’ve set his soul on fire. “You,” she pointed at the billionaire, “will fix this.”
“Whatever’s easiest.” Came Peter’s usual reply, not one to be picky or demanding.
“You were in the panic room for a while,” Sam added, his concern evident in the way he spoke. The Falcon was usually full of sarcasm and often gave Peter lip to mess with him. But not today. “Did something happen at school?”
“That skinny dude got one hell of a voice. Holy cow.” Read another
Peter couldn’t help but smile, grateful for the amazing heroes he saw as his family. Never had he ever dreamed of being a part of such a wonderful, albeit crazy, family. A soft poke from his pseudo aunt told him to continue. “They grabbed me. I couldn’t fight back without revealing my identity, so…” he took a deep, shuddering breath, “so I let them drag me back over to that creepy, decrepit mausoleum and throw me in.” His breath caught in his throat as tears clouded his vision, the memory playing on repeat in his mind. “They shut the doors and locked it behind me.”
One spirit remained, taking the time to thank her savior before finally laying to rest.
Tony didn’t appear to be injured, which did wonders to ease Peter’s mind. One of Peter’s biggest fears was that somehow, Tony would get hurt or killed because of him. That Tony would be gone, and he could never get back the man he saw as a father. Even if the Avengers decided to get rid of him, at least they would still be alive; Peter could still watch out for them. But seeing as he was in the Tower’s medical wing with Iron Man beside him, Peter believed it was safe to assume that neither of his fears had come to fruition.
“Feed off you?” Tony’s uneasiness was apparent, not liking the sound of someone trying to feed off of Peter.
He sounded so exhausted and worn out and Natasha had to fight the urge to turn around and hug him. Instead, she calmly said, “we could never hate you, Peter. You’re a part of our team. Please don’t worry about that.”
“And communicate with them,” Peter spoke softly, “sense them, and sometimes… remove them. I also have Telekinetic abilities.” He continued to wring his hands nervously. “I told you it was weird.”
“Are you okay to talk about it? If not, that’s fine-“
And Peter did understand. Hero work was dangerous. And inevitably, people got hurt and sometimes killed. Peter accepted that cruel yet inescapable truth long ago. But that didn’t mean he liked it. The young mutant would always do everything in his power to save people, no matter how bad they may be. Sure, he couldn’t save everyone, but he’d be damned if he didn’t try.
He broke a rule, the third of many enacted by the scientists to keep him in line. Address Mary and Richard as ma’am and sir. His pain-ridden mind was barely able to process where he was, let alone how to properly address his superiors. Each waking hour was a living hell. Peter never knew what form of pain he would be receiving. Whips, scalpels, starvation, frigid and searing temperatures, knives, and dog whistles were tools he was all too familiar with. Even something as mundane as a belt could be used against him.
Natasha came up beside Steve and placed a hand on Tony’s and Peter’s shoulders. “We’re all glad you’re here. Gave us quite the scare.”
Rose gave a noncommittal shrug, clearly unbothered by the topic at hand. “If you call surviving monstrous. Then I suppose we are monsters.” She took a few steps closer to Peter and leaned down to look him in the eyes. “And we will continue to survive. We will continue to hunt down viewers, no matter their age, no matter their background. I don’t care how much they beg, scream, and cry. But I think,” she straightened up and took a few steps back, “I think we can start off with the Avengers.”
“It’s nice to meet you, Peter,” he held out his hand, “I’m Justin Hammer.”
“And I- ugh.” The teen groaned when a particularly deep cut on his left shoulder throbbed painfully, and fresh blood began pouring out. He pointedly ignored Tony’s concerned look. “I’m assuming you did something to piss him off.”
Tony cleared his throat, fighting back the tears pooling in his eyes. No child should ever have to scavenge for food, fear going home, or struggle to live with a neglectful family. No one deserved that, especially not Peter. Squeezing his eyes shut, Tony managed to choke out a response, “no problem, Underoos.”
A sudden thought hit him,
“I highly doubt that,” Tony said confidently, sitting up straighter. “The Avengers are the best of the best. They’ll find us, and when they do,” he paused for effect, making eye contact with each kidnapper, “you guys are dead.”
“Who’s shooting this video?” Tony leaned forward, his eyes sweeping over the screen. “It better not be stupid paparazzi. Ever since Spider-Man officially joined the Avengers, they just can’t leave him alone. That was almost a year ago!”
The small teen just shook his head, choking out a weak, “it’s okay, Mr. Stark.”
Tony set the empty cup on the nearby overbed table tucked against the wall to his left. “Your healing factor sure is outstanding.” Tony mused, genuinely amazed by Peter’s incredible powers. “But I guess sleeping for almost five days can help too.”
“Really!” Clint practically screamed. He jumped off the refrigerator and grabbed a soup spoon out of the nearest cabinet drawer, nearly stumbling over his own feet in his haste. He held up the spoon at arm’s length and asked, “can you bend this?”

“Can- can I hug you?” Tony asked, unsure of how Peter would react. Hopefully, it would be a good reaction, considering how much the vigilante enjoyed physical affection.
Peter sat quietly for a few minutes, contemplating what he should say and if he should even talk at all. The Avengers were his family, and getting them involved could be potentially life-threatening. He would never, ever consciously put his family in harm’s way.
“No, they are not.” A new voice spoke up. The warehouse’s front door slid open, then shut with a bang, and a scrawny, blond-haired man stepped forward. His face twisted into a sneer as he made eye contact with Tony. “Stark, long time no see.”
“He and his goons have bullied you for years. Even though you try to hide it.” Her hand found its way back into the honey-brown curls she loved so much, tussling the strands absentmindedly. “I’m the world’s best spy,” she smirked, “did you think you could hide it from me?”
Recovery is always difficult no matter the trauma. But Peter’s got his friends and family by his side to love and support him.
“What do you want me to do?” Tony’s aware his tone has turned hostile by now. But it’s the last thing on his mind now. Steve’s breaking up with him! “Be some stupid chapter in your scrapbook and go on my merry way?!”
Stockholm? They didn’t know anyone in Sweden.
“Uh, what?” Steve dumbly asked.
“What…” Steve faintly croaked out. Ulysses, seeing a cat on Clint’s lap, started to coo and reached out for a chance to pet the animal, while Tony sighed the sigh of man who has been suffering long and arduously.
Joe turned an interesting shade of red at the reminder that he had been outed by Peter in his desperate attempt to shift attention away from his supersecret identity. “You know, we don’t have to talk about it. Peter’s secret identity as Spiderman clearly takes precedence here.”
The younger soldier, sitting next to him timidly raised his hand, like a schoolkid wanting to ask his teacher a question. “You’re kidding me with the hand up, right?”
“Bruce touched it.” his mate continued.
“This is a travesty. I’m Italian and I can’t even stand the sight of meatballs.” Tony lamented, “this baby is too Irish.” he glared at Steve.
As they passed the other Avengers, Tony could trace the exact moment they saw Steve’s disfigured form from the way their eyes blew wide open in shock and mortification. He felt Clint and Natasha stepping out of the Quinjet, solemn and stoic behind him. Tony didn’t want to see them, because he knew if he did then he would falsely blame them for coming home whole and healthy while Steve looked the way he was.
