. He’d find himself telling Steve about the most random of things and Steve would listen, sincere and interested. Sometimes he’d talk about life before the war, about the assholes who used to beat him up, about his best friend Bucky. His voice would go softer when he mentioned Bucky. Tony wonders how he hadn’t seen it coming.
“Birdbrain,” he says. “How was house arrest?” Okay, he doesn’t have the warmest of feelings towards Clint. He feels bad about the whole house arrest thing, of course, but he doubts Clint’s as friendly as Steve and Nat have been. They had been friends, once. Maybe, if they’d all stayed in the Avengers Tower, maybe they could have stayed friends. Maybe they could have stayed together.
“We. As in you and me. You’re not alone. And you didn’t have JARVIS or your lab when you built Iron Man. Focus on the things that you do know and then we’ll go from there, okay?”
It really is unfair that Steve seems so unaffected. He hadn’t said a word throughout the entire soulmate thing and now he’s standing there, stoic, ready. He’s always ready for the next mission, the next war, the next big thing. He’s always so firmly planted, always right where he’s supposed to be.
“Well, I’ll procrastinate that confrontation because Pepper’s wrath is terrifying. Rhodey’s time zones are all off. And well, you’re one of my best friends so I guess you’re the first to know.” Steve was touched by that but it hurt too. Best friends was all he’d get which was fine. He was happy if Tony was happy. That was how love was supposed to work, right?
and all I could think about was how much I wished that it was me you loved enough to even look at, let alone-”
Tony’s mind is a wonderful thing. Steve thinks of it in electric blue, taking in information like a computer and processing it so fast that he zones out for a second. But all this new information, full of unknown variables- even a genius would find it hard to process, especially one like Tony who would be bent on figuring the place out, even if it is one of those things that just isn’t meant to be understood.
Instead, he had nearly died in outer space after flying a nuke through a wormhole. And now, he’s back in outer space and Thanos is on Earth and any time now, there will be a snap and some of them will die.
Steve opens his eyes. The world shifts into focus. It hurts, a little, to see so much amber after all that darkness. Or perhaps it hadn’t even been dark for very long. But through the amber, he sees something else too, something he will never fail to recognise.
“Sure didn’t look that miffed,” came Natasha’s voice. She had this way of making scathing and sarcastic comments sound like observations.
“I’ve always looked at you, Steve. I- are you saying that this whole time, I could have had you instead?”
But Steve could barely hear them because Tony was looking at him with that focussed look of his and everything else had blurred away. Steve couldn’t get drunk, but when he finally kissed Tony, his husband Tony, Tony Stark-Rogers, he thought that the whole point of wanting to drink was letting go and feeling free. And in Tony’s arms, right there, he’d never felt freer.
Or perhaps Steve was being ridiculous. The nausea he felt was probably because the man he was in love with was marrying someone else, not because there was any sort of threat to the wedding. What kind of idiot villain would attack an Avenger’s wedding, anyway?
“Yes, Thor did mention. I would like to come with you to meet him at this base of yours.” Clint looks at Steve for a second, his face slightly tight, but it loosens at Steve’s nod.
“I have no idea how to do this. I’m a genius, and I don’t have a clue about this. What even is the scientific explanation for soulbonds? I mean, magic is just science we don’t know how to explain yet, but is this even magic? Should we ask Thor? Do Asgardians have a soulbond concept?”
Steve’s a lot more silent now. Before everything had happened, Steve used to speak to him a lot more. They used to do that all the time. He’d come into the workshop because it helped him focus and Tony could never ask him to leave. He’d sketch away and soon they had begun to
“Rogers.” Not Cap, not Steve, just Rogers. Tony never really called him that. But then again, he never called him Steve either.
The tension in her body does not fade. Steve may not have a shield, but his body was weapon enough. He readies himself into a fighting stance, glancing at Tony. He really doesn’t want to fight but he will, if he has to. “My name is Gamora. You say you’re from Earth, Peter’s planet.”
he had said. The words were so easy. They didn’t get caught up in his throat the way Steve’s words always had when he’d tried to tell Tony. That was the privilege of loving and being loved back, a privilege that Steve would never get, not from Ton, at least.
Now, seeing that look again, Tony isn’t thinking of Siberia. He hasn’t in a while. No, all he’s thinking is that he never wants Steve to look that helplessly miserable again.
Steve had drawn Tony’s lips too- the way they were pursed when he tried to stay silent, the way they’d pucker up just later when he’d realise that he had to say something. He’d drawn them the way they were parted just a little when Tony slept. He knew the shape of those lips so well that he could draw them in his sleep.
Steve is obviously feeling guilty. He’s a lot quieter and he watches himself, like he could hurt Tony any minute.
“Who are you?” comes Tony’s voice from the helmet. The girl holds up her hands in surrender but Steve spots the knives she’d slid behind her wrists into some kind of compartment. It would take the barest flick of her wrists for her to bring them out. She’s tall and she stands with the presence of not a soldier, exactly, but a killer. Oh, and she’s green, so there’s that.
“Someone wants to see you and Steve.” He’s trying very hard not to look at Tony, but he’s studied that expressive face so many times that he can’t help but notice the flash of alarm and then the mask of confusion that covers his features.
And that’s when it hits Tony. Steve’s been through this before. He’d woken up in an entirely new century, everyone he’d known gone. And there hadn’t been anyone to help him. There had only been SHIELD with its thick case files and ready missions. No wonder Steve had joined the Avengers. It had been a purpose. But after Loki, none of them had been there for him. Tony hadn’t been there for him.
“Lead the way, Romanoff,” he says. Gamora follows Natasha and they get lost in conversation. Tony won’t lie- seeing the two women being so friendly is a little terrifying; they could probably take over the world if they wanted to. Hawkeye, as always, is lookout, his keen eyes scanning the environment for threats.
“God, Steve, I would have gotten over it. I mean, I got over seeing the video right in front of me while simultaneously finding out that someone I trusted had lied to me and I’m more or less over it. Not that I’ve forgiven you. But I’m not angry anymore. It’s been a long two years.” Tony doesn’t know why he’s saying any of this. This is supposed to give him closure, technically. It’s supposed to feel cathartic. But it doesn’t, not really. Tony used to think of all the things he’d say to Steve if they met again. He’d wanted to hurt him, to yell. But now that Steve’s actually in front of him, he can’t bring himself to do any of it.
“You love me?” And Steve’s voice was soft and fragile, like the words had barely made their way out.
Tony had gone completely white, the shawarma that he’d been so vigorously digging into suddenly abandoned. He’d said it out loud, of course he’d do something stupid like that.
“There could be. I don’t think the two of you waking up together was coincidental. I don’t think the soul stone works with coincidences,” Gamora replies. Of course Tony would be looking for the others.
Some people say that when you fall in love with someone, your body reacts to them before your mind catches up. Seeing them makes a tension in your shoulders that you weren’t even aware of disappear. You can’t help smiling when they smile. Your pupils dilate- you want to take in everything about them (the errant brown curl that was almost plastered to Tony’s forehead after he came out of his workshop, the manic glint in his eyes when he had a new idea, the way he smiled at Dum-E fondly sometimes when he thought nobody was looking, but Steve was always looking at him, even when he didn’t know it himself).
“Well, you are a good man, Captain, as Dr. Erskine had said. Besides, this could save me as well. Perhaps I will finally be at peace after this for I will have done my duty.”
Steve almost touches Tony, just then, if only to assure him that they’re not completely alone, that they’re together, that they’ll figure something out.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to say that,” he started but then Tony’s face fell a little. “Not because it isn’t true.”
“Yeah, together. Don’t have any time for arguments, we’ll do that after we save the world. And you better be prepared, I was pretty much a debate champion in school.”
But Steve’s silence bothers him for a reason he can’t really place. Maybe it’s just so out of place and Tony craves some normalcy right now. This, all of this, it terrifies him. Not knowing what to do terrifies him. But he’ll power through, he always does. And he’ll get them out, he has to.
“Wish I could say the same but you know, too busy making sure Spider-kid stays safe to catch a break.”
Steve wasn’t someone who liked to drink. But there were times when he wished he could get blackout drunk and forget everything. This had happened only twice since he’d woken up in this new century and funnily enough, both times were because of Tony Stark. Surprisingly, none of these times were because Tony had driven him mad. No, he had long since stopped hating Tony’s intense urge to argue with every decision Steve made. In fact, they’d stopped arguing. Not completely, of course, but now their arguments were limited to teasing and friendly banter. And all the words Steve had said to Tony on the Helicarrier? They’d been forgotten and forgiven. To everyone, it was obvious that there was nobody Steve trusted out on the field more than Iron Man. They were
Eyes of smoky quartz, whiskey when the sun shines through them. But there is no sun here, just a steady, dull glow and Steve does not know where it comes from. But those eyes, he knows them.
“Not everyone has a soulbond, of course. Very few do, in fact. But strong soulbonds get magnified in the Soul Stone Realm and the one the two of you share is one of the strongest. It is no coincidence that you woke up beside each other. Even the rest of your teammates share a certain bond which is why you have all woken up in the same district. Your soulbond, now magnified, will help you find a way out of the Realm.”
“I respect you too, Cap. And if we don’t find anyone else, I’ll trust you to get us out of here. We’ll figure it out together.” Steve doesn’t know what he’s done to deserve that olive branch but he takes it gratefully.
“Steve, I’m not doing this out of pity. I’m doing it out of pure selfishness. I’m in love with you. I mean, our timing is terrible, but nothing changes how I feel about you and I thought Ty did but here I am, still irrevocably and irreversibly in love with you.”
Steve looks surprisingly calm. Natasha is not a woman of many tells, but there is an air of quiet around her even as she talks to Gamora. Clint is trying hard not to jump at the sounds of their own footsteps, but in the silence, there isn’t much else that can be heard. They’re all thrown off by this realm. But Steve walks on and the tension in his gait seems to be more because of Tony’s presence than being in an entirely new world.
“If I tell you, you may not be very eager to go. But this needs to be done. Please try not to freak out.” She may be answering Tony’s question, but she’s clearly talking to Steve. He’s even more confused now. He isn’t that irrational, is he? Does Pepper think he’s rash? “He’s waiting inside.”
Tony opens his mouth to reply but suddenly his expression darkens as he looks at something behind Steve. Steve turns around, immediately reaching for his shield before realising that he didn’t have it anymore. He hears the high frequency sound of Tony’s repulsors getting ready to fire.
“It’s not that bad, these aren’t even as strong as the ones I’d fought back then. It’s honestly more of a distraction.”
“He’s…Rhodes, do you know where Ty Stone is?” There was some indistinct yelling. “Sorry, no clue. But he should be safe, I’ll go look.”
“It’s fine, he’ll be rotting in a very secure prison. Besides, I don’t really care. Kinda finding it hard to be sad right now.”
When Thor asked if there were any objections, there wasn’t silence, but laughter, coming from all the Avengers gathered there, like they found the very idea of someone objecting absurd.
So there he was, two weeks later, unable to drink away his sorrows. Tony looked...well he didn’t exactly look happy, per se, but relieved. He looked a little lighter, less worried. The stress lines in his face seemed to have smoothened out. And of course he looked beautiful and Steve hated himself for noticing the way the tuxedo clung to those powerful legs and that stunning ass.
“Red Skull. What are you doing here?” he asks. Johann Schmidt takes the hood off and Tony audibly gasps.
But something seemed off. The wedding was organised completely by Pepper, of course, who had been secretly delighted to do it, even as she whined about the short notice. Colonel Rhodes was coming in and would have arrived on American soil a night before. All the Avengers were there, decked in their finery (except for Thor who had been appalled at the fact that capes were not worn for Midgardian weddings and was wearing a bright red one over the suit Jane had made him don). Even Clint was dressed up for the occasion, no food spilt on his attire. Natasha, of course, looked wonderful as always and Steve noticed how Bucky’s eyes followed her around everywhere. Everyone was here, and everyone was happy.
They ordered and leaned back, barely tired. Everything was so normal and suddenly it was all too much, looking at Tony still in the armour with a ruined tuxedo underneath.
“And do you think we’ll be able to get out?” he asks, ignoring the part about coincidences, because it scares him, in a way.
But then it turned out that he didn’t need to interrupt it because there was a crash and suddenly he was reaching for a shield that he’d left behind in his room and there was gleaming metal appearing over Tony’s tuxedo and he felt the air crackle with electricity as Thor’s hammer arrived.
Steve thought. It had crept onto him without him realising and he felt dizzy with the realisation, like there was something jarring about this confession that he had made to himself. And it had been a strange sensation, falling in love with someone after everything he’d been through. It had been a sad sensation, because Tony dated so many people (all brilliant and modern) for so little time and Steve didn’t stand a chance. But he hadn’t thought of drinking or of forgetting.
Steve felt his face heat up as he finally let go of Tony. “Oh, yeah, we were just racing to see who would get up here first.”
His butler Jarvis provided Tony with a more suitable father figure he needed. The British man was kind and warm hearted. Him and his wife were the people who would throw him birthday parties and graduation parties when his parents could not. Jarvis was the person Tony always went to after a lecture or confrontation at school. He supplied the advise and comfort Tony constantly craved.
The doors unlocked and Steve practically folded himself in half again, squishing into the car. How could he have not noticed this before?
The last thing he heard as he watched the blank whiteness cloud his vision was Peggy's beautiful voice, calling out his name. Pleading him to give her an answer. To fly straight home. Safe and sound. To build a life with her. End this war. Live happily.
Another angsty chapterrrrr. I'm so happy for all the kind and encouraging comments, so thank you so much!! I have all the time in the world now from quarantine, so many updates to come!!
This chapter was so fun to write, not going to lie. That stare though, ugh, we are so close! It took all the self control in me not to make it go any further HAHA! I am loving all of these comments too by the way! Next chapter will be up soon, I just turned 18 yesterday so we got some adulting to do!
You guys are so incredibly amazing. Thank you so much for all the lovely comments, they are so motivating and sweet!! I know everything is getting more and more crazy, so please stay safe and make smart choices! Stay home and stay healthy :)  the one pro about never leaving my house during quarantine is endless writing time! Also, hope you like the small cliffhanger, the real tea is coming!
I have changed the ratings for the story if you haven't noticed so please head the warnings. I'm not too graphic with it, but there's going to be more violence than anticipated with language.
Poor Steve is trying to figure out his feelings as well as handle escalating nightmares. Additionally, just as he was enjoying the domestic team moments, someone comes to crazy the party. :O
Heyooo, I'm back! Ugh, this story, I love it so much. Thanks to everyone for your comments and kudos! It's so inspiring to see all the enjoyment coming from this piece. I'm trying not to make these characters out of character, but add my own twist to them at the same time. Next chapter is gonna be very fluffy and fun :)
Steve was actually really excited for this. When he was a kid, he was always too sick to hang out with friends, and the only times he watched movies was by himself or with Bucky. So this was probably his first casual movie night. As soon as they burst through the stairwell, the smell of popcorn hit them, making Steve’s mouth water.
Another update! Feel free to leave a comment or kudos! And what plan do you think Steve's hatching? hhmm
I can't believe this story actually hit 200 kudos!! Thank you guys so so much, this is amazing! I appreciate all of your comments and kudos so so much. I'm so sad that I'm coming to the end of this story, but it was so much fun to write! I really was not expecting this much of a slow burn or even this long of a story, but I promise it will be worth it!
Peggy was strong, stubborn, beautiful and kind. He saw a part of his mother in her and held a strong longing for her. He soon hoped he would be able to end this war, destroy Red Skull and his forces, and come home to hold her in his arms. Simple. They would live together, buy a small house in the suburbs, have a dog, a white picket fence, 2 or 3 kids. Whatever Peggy wanted. But of course, that's just not what life is. Life isn't simple.
By the way, I hope that everyone is staying safe and healthy during this time! This is so scary and nerve wracking for everyone. Please take any precautions you can to help keep yourself, friends and families safe. This is something that we will all get through as long as we keep our heads and stay together :) Best prayers and wishes! <3
He had to think of something else, quickly. Of course, right at that moment, Steve felt a small weight on his right shoulder. Looking down he could see Tony’s head laying on it casually as he stared at the tv intently. The warmth and weight made the soldier smile. He really liked this feeling.
Tony wakes up in the hospital to Clint watching transformers, Steve unable to stop crying and burger king.
His best friend Bucky's disappearance was the catalyst that he needed to push him from this hole. One of the scientists, Howard Stark, and the amazing Peggy Carter assisted him into going against orders, flying into enemy territory, and rescuing not only Bucky, but hundreds of other soldiers. From that moment forward, all of his dance routines on stage turned into organized attacks on the battlefield. With Bucky and the Howling Commandos by his side, he was able to finally make a difference.
Nat’s words sunk into Steve and he absorbed them like a sponge. This was important and needed to be handled with expertise. He was scared to death, but so excited. Internally, he was jumping for joy that he was going to finally be a little selfish and go after this with all of him. He wouldn’t take any chances. This would be thought out and genuine, and he was going to give it his all.
James Rhodes had known Tony ever since MIT. They were the kind of friends to hold each other accountable when they fell short and lift the others mood when they needed it. Rhodey was Tony's big brother in a way. He was Tony's protector and guide through his screwed up world. The genius' best known friend soon became his savior from the desert wasteland. The helicopter landed with a cloud of sand and dust, causing the tears in Tony's eyes to fall. He fell to his knees and held up a signature peace sign. It made Tony's heart throb in thanks at the sight of his friend running to him, tears in the other man's eyes as well.
“That baseball game,” he looked to the radio, which was praising a player for hitting a home run. “Happened in May 1941. I know because I was there.” Steve approached her suddenly, radiating aggression. “Now, I’ll ask you again. Where am I?”
The company grew and they both became even more successful, especially with Tony's new Jericho missile. This piece was a revelation in the industry. On a trip in the middle east to gain buyers, Tony's fleet was attacked by the very weapons he built. The genius and innocent American soldiers were blown up by his own pieces of work. The sight of the very weapons Tony built to protect Americans actually taking their lives was traumatizing. But the aggressors wouldn't settle with just the death of the inventor. They wanted his genius and work. They surgically implanted a magnet inside his chest to stop metal shrapnel from entering his heart, thus 'saving his life'. The group was called the Ten Rings. They demanded Tony build them the Jericho in exchange for his freedom. Or so they claimed. He knew that he would be killed eventually, but this was no place to die. Not when Tony hadn't even accomplished something notable enough for his father's pride.
Another update!! Yayy! College is so much fun but sO much work. I am sorry if this is late but we are almost there! One more chapter... ;-; Also, this was my first smut scene that I have ever written so I am sorry if it's a little weird or just choppy lol. Thank you all for the encouraging comments and kudos! Please leave comments about what you think about the story and what you liked!! Thank you!
Thor lifted his hand to rub his chin before his eyes lit up with realization. “Oh! I see! This character, he was a weakling before, but he had the spirit of a true hero. And now he has earned the obvious body of a hero! This is quite like our friend Steven!”
The next hour and a half was full of explanations and flirting lessons. He was to shower Tony with even more attention, flirtations and give him every sign in the book. She told him about how to casually, but obviously put an arm around someone, how to look at them, speak, things to say, and dozens of other things. Once they were done, Steve felt like he had an arsenal of techniques and was ready to give Tony everything he had.
Thank you guys so much for your Kudos, comments and love! I'm so happy to get this update uploaded so early. I'm super excited for this storyline, I see it going so far. Let me know what you guys think!
After a couple more meetings with Daliah, he felt like he was ready. Ready to put himself out there and show vulnerability and to accept any type of response from Tony. Well, he was ready for everything, except for Tony being this oblivious. No matter what he did, nothing was working. The man only blushed adorably, and rubbed it off. Was Tony this insecure about himself? To think that not even he could attract Steve? It even angered Steve slightly to think that Tony was that stereotypical to label Steve to be so incredibly straight, but he knew he had to keep trying and to keep his cool. He wouldn’t give up because Tony wasn’t some person you gave up on.
Opening the car door and stepping out, Tony waited for Steve to follow his action before he finally spoke up again. He could still save this. His eyes remained on the elevator doors ahead of him the entire time. “So...being gay.”
(Basically an Avengers 2012 recap, introducing Bruce and Thor. Its mostly the same, but Stony sprinkled throughout. The ending is important to the plot though, if you choose to skim :) Also the suit I used for Steve is the one from Age of Ultron. I'm sorry, but I can never take him seriously with the original one from this movie. Enjoy!)
A chuckle rose from Steve’s chest, as he shook his head, feeling any tension that was lingering in the air dissolve. He used the black sleeves of his sweater to wipe away the remaining tears and redness. The chilly air began to nip at his runny nose, making it very uncomfortable.
As Tony spoke his first words at that moment, a gasp escaped from Steve. Finally. Something broke inside of him, as realization hit him like a truck. He was actually alone. Everyone was actually gone. He wasn’t just saying it anymore. He was realizing it, seeing it. Something snapped in him as one gasp turned into 2, and Steve's chest began to quake. Tears slid out of each eye as he allowed his walls to crumble. Sucking in each breath as if it were his last, he broke. He broke right into Tony’s arms, in the middle of the parking lot. All the pain inside that he hadn’t even realized was there made itself known, and he moaned in pain. Tony’s hand slowly ran circles into Steve’s shoulder.
The more he thought about it, the more it did make sense. It was kind of funny in a way how this character’s story was quite similar to his own. The body under Steve’s arm started to shake with a chuckle as Tony spoke. “That’s actually pretty accurate. Who knew bird brain could be observant.”
Slowly, Tony approached Steve. His form was hunched, hands at his sides, clenched into trembling fists. Ever so carefully, Tony stepped forward, slotting himself into Steve’s chest, wrapping arms around his large shoulders. Silently, he stood there, just holding the other male. The soldier froze and went tense for a moment. He seemed to not know how to react. Hesitantly, his arms encircled Tony’s frame, wrapping around his trim waist. He tucked his head into Tony’s neck and stood frozen in the hug.
Will Steve be able to save Tony in time? Will Bucky's prison break plan work? Will I ever end this story? Who knows?!
Breaking from his thoughts, Tony looked up to see the cashier handing him back his card and proof of transaction.
Shopping for art supplies for Steve was like a kid shopping in a candy store. The place was huge with so many different options and varieties of tools. He wanted almost everything in the store, but knew how selfish it was to take advantage of Tony’s wallet. So, trying to be as picky as possible, Steve browsed the isles, grabbing paper and pencils and pastels. It was becoming harder and harder to focus on what he needed as his mind kept daydreaming of what he would draw. Mostly it was a certain brunnette of course. Entering the picture frame aisle, Steve was just wandering at this point. He was just about ready to go back and search for Tony and the cart, when something caught his eye. It was a frame of 2 men and it said Love. He didn’t know why, but he picked it up and stared at it curiously. The world really was more accepting of this.
Shaking his head to attempt to clear it, he focused back onto the road, watching all the buildings and listening carefully as Tony explained the intriguing history of some. He was very knowledgeable, having the ability to just spew these facts randomly.
Finally, Tony dragged Steve out of the store with more supplies than Steve wanted. They went back to the tower, got ready for movie night, and raced up to the communal floor. Steve had some kind of burst of adrenaline and he and Tony, once again, acted like kids as they ran up the stairs, tackling each other.
Yaaayyy! Chapter 9! This one was really fun to write. The chemistry is heating up, Clint's having a grand time, Steve gets easily distracted by Tony's thighs, and Nat has never been more proud of Tony's use of her special move. I'm making it so from Iron Man 2, the 2 of them trained together while getting so close and that's where Tony learned most of his self defense from. And from Happy of course! Next Chapter has so much tea.
Yes, Tony actually said that. It didn't process in his head until he saw Steve's reaction. The words had flown out of him before he could even realize what he was saying. A beet red color invaded Steve's pale skin as his eyes widened and smile faltered. "Oh, oh! In like a friend to friend way. Like, from a girls perspective, she could describe you using that word...hot."
Sorry it took so long but the ending is finally here!! Thank you guys so so much for all the comments and kudos! I hope you loved reading this story as much as I loved writing it! I did leave some holes for a possible sequel, so we'll see where it goes. But for now, thanks so much for reading and hope you liked! :)
A faint buzzing was the only thing he could hear at this point, until it started to blend into a faint discussion. Voices could be heard in the distance. Steve tried to focus on them as a way to bring his brain back to consciousness. His brain seemed to be waking up on it’s own accord, ignoring his attempt to rush it. Eventually, the voices came through clearly. It was a baseball game. From May 1941. His eyes opened finally. Something was spinning above him. Slowly. The blurred object soon sharpened and morphed into a ceiling fan.
Steve took one more long breath, feeling the anxiety in his stomach finally settle a bit. “I think so.”
The days after New York was filled with clean up and search and rescue. It was exhausting with that on top of meetings with Shield, training sessions, and the press. Once their lives finally began to go back to normal, Steve went back to Dr. Daliah about twice a week. New York left him with some troubling dreams and nightmares of Tony falling or losing his friends. She was able to help him with that, thankfully, which then led to a different type of problem. The ‘strange feeling’. He told her all about it, and she understood fully. It took an endless amount of meetings for Steve to get that sorted out. She would tell him that there was nothing wrong with him; he was not perverted, demonized, insane or a creep. The feeling he was getting was indeed something along the line of love. She told him that he didn’t have to call it that, it could be a crush or liking or whatever he wanted, but night after night, and day after day with Tony, Steve knew what it was.
The relationship between himself and Peggy blossomed into something beautiful. When Bucky fell, he lost a part of himself. He felt a giant weight of guilt from letting his best friend slip through his fingers, literally. He wasn't strong enough, not enough to save Bucky or to handle the loss of him. Bucky was the one who dragged him away from the danger he created for himself. He helped him from the day he was born to the present. Bucky supported him through his sickness, his parent’s death, his rejection from the army, and his fights with any and every bully.  And now he was gone forever. Drinking didn’t help; he soon realized that only Peggy did. She stood by his side and helped him stand back up. As he stood on shaky legs, Peggy supported him, getting him through the depressive period. She soon became his new best friend. She was his first true love. Of course he still felt like part of him was gone, with bucky not there, but Peggy gave him a new piece of life.
"Oh, oh yeah. Thanks." Taking the card, Tony looked back up to glance at Steve. He was still staring intensely at a celebrity magazine, a serious glare on his face. "Hey, Steve. Are you ready?"
All Steve wanted to do that day was make some breakfast, set up the most romantic scene he could, and prepare to put his entire heart out in the open. Too bad life has a different plan set in motion.
Tony was about to leap from his seat, but was held back by Steve as Clint howled with laughter. Thor suddenly boomed with it as well, slapping his knee.
"Come on, Steve, show me. It can't be that bad," Tony insisted, crossing his arms as he shifted on the uncomfortable bench he was perched on outside of the changing rooms.
His body felt slow and exhausted as Steve tried to sit up. He cringed as he swung his legs from the bed he was perched on and took in the room he occupied. It was bland and typical. The radio buzzed on, there was a lamp and a window, but it was hazy and seemed off looking. Every muscle tensed in his body, his mind racing trying to make sense of this. A knock on the door drew him from his evaluation of the room. A woman stepped through. She wore a nurse uniform and a smile.
Hello Peeps! I hope you liked the first chapter of my first work on Archive! I am very new to this, so please let me know what you think ^^ I am mainly doing this for fun and experience, so although criticism and requests are welcome, please be nice!

Natasha smirked, nodding. “100 percent. Now, what you need to do. Tony is very oblivious. You say he’s smart, which he is, except when it comes to this. He wouldn’t be able to recognize genuine flirting if it hit him like a bag of bricks. So, we have to be obvious without scaring him off. He’s been hurt a lot with previous relationships. People would date him for money, fame, sex, or just to make fun of him to the press or other people. He might not believe you if you aren't careful.”
Tony gets discharged from the hospital and Steve brings him home. Feelings are spilled, angst is fresh and the fluff is present!!
The man stood with his hand on the door handle, back towards Tony. His breaths were coming in short, ragged gasps,  and Tony could even see the shaking in his hands from here.
Pepper Potts had known Tony ever since his inheritance took place. She was the only one who knew how to beat him into shape and stand up to him. She was beautiful and brilliant. Tony's heart burned for the woman as she moved her way up the company ladder, becoming his number 2. As she watched him walk off of the plane, rescued from Afghanistan, Tony could see the red in her eyes and a smile grew on his face to see the love in her eyes. With her resilience and audacity, Pepper was the one to gather the proof to convict Stane and help Tony and Rhodey bring him to justice.
The movie started and it seemed really cute. Steve was unaware of the fact that it was like a musical, but that made it even better. Of course it was hard to focus, though, as Steve was focused on something else. He was trying to gather his courage and wait for the right time to move his arm so it was resting on the back of the couch and, more importantly, Tony’s shoulders. Finally, the man leaned forward to place the empty bowl of popcorn on the coffee table and Steve saw his perfect opportunity. Swiftly, he looked up at the ceiling as he draped his arm behind the two of them as Tony leaned back into the couch. His far shoulder slipped perfectly into Steve’s hand, and he couldn’t help the goofy smile that slipped onto his face. He looked over to Natasha, who was looking at them with a smile and her thumb and index finger forming a ring. Pride and confidence flooded his chest as he took a risky glance at Tony. The man glanced at the hand on his shoulder, and there was a smile on his face. It was soft, but Tony smiled at Steve’s gesture! The soldier felt undeniable giddiness as he turned his eyes back to the animation. The girl was currently singing about how she wouldn’t admit her feelings about the demigod.
“Oh, trust me, Steve, listen to me when I say you should go for this. You are perfect for him and just his type.”
When they both passed in 1991, Tony was devastated. The car crash was so sudden that it shook the world. Tony allowed his deep depression to drag him into the world of substance and abuse. He coped through very unhealthy methods and spiraled into a dark hole. Howard's most trusted and ancient business partner, Obadiah Stane took hold of the company during Tony's meltdown. It wasn't until the boy hit his 20s that he decided to take control of his life. He vowed off any and all drinking and addiction. Suddenly Tony took hold of his inheritance and was the owner of a goliath company, one of the worlds largest suppliers in weapons manufacturing. He took it up with ease, having excelled during his time at MIT enough to take on anything. The young genius was the inspiration for the future, inventing and running the company like never before. He was a symbol for the New Age.
Steve thought for a moment, and while yes he was slightly exhausted, new clothes did sound like something he needed. He was also feeling much better about himself. "We can go to the store, I'm ok now."
Thank you all for your comments and kudos! I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy! I am so excited where this story is going and will be keeping the updates coming :)
Mostly from Steve's point of view as he goes back to Shield and meets some interesting characters. Spoiler alert, it's our 2 favorite Shield agents. ;P
The Avengers finally come together to protect the world from Loki's madness? Will they be able to win this fight? Who knows??
Steve recieves a history lesson and learns not only about the history of the movements for equality, but also about Tony himself. Then things turn floofy.
Tony's eye roll almost made his whole head roll off his neck. Releasing a long, exaggerated sigh, Tony leaned over Steve's ridiculously built body and snatched the damn book.
Steve cried. He cried, and he finally felt everything. He closed his eyes and saw Peggy. He saw her sweet smile, brown hair and the gorgeous red dress she wore at the bar that one unforgettable night. He saw Bucky’s charming smirk, and he felt his hand on his shoulder. He heard him say, ‘Til the end of the line’. He saw him falling into an abyss of snow. He saw Peggy fading from existence, from his mind. He saw Howard smiling at him and also walking away into darkness. The same happened to each of the Howling Commandos, one by one. Opening his eyes, Steve looked up and saw white. Small flakes were falling silently around them. They danced in the winter air as they weaved themselves into Tony’s hair and landed all over them.
As Steve stood up, he watched as Thor grabbed Tony gently by the arm to help him stand up. “Yeah, of course I won. And Thor, please call me Tony.”
After his visit with Peggy, Steve has a moment, finally starting to come to terms with Tony's help. The duo then goes on a quick shopping trip, and Steve touches upon a sensitive topic.
“They are all gone. They all left me! Everyone left me all alone.” he finally turned around to face Tony, but his expression had changed. It was twisted in rage and pain. Utter pain. “She can’t even remember me. Bucky is still dead. And every single person I knew, everyone is dead. I feel like I’m in a nightmare, and I can’t wake up and no one can hear me! I can’t see, I can’t breath, I don’t know where I am. She told me to cry, My shrink. She said that I had to cry, but I can’t. Why can't I even do that? Even after every nightmare at night. After I see everyone I know vanish in front of me and I wake up alone, I can’t force a single tear. And everything is so different, it’s too different! I can’t handle this Tony. I can’t do it!”
Steve Rogers was a traditional man. He liked things to be simple and that was that. His favorite ice cream flavor was butter pecan. He liked steak and potatoes. He wanted to get married, have a family, support them with a simple 9 to 5 job, retire, and live with his loving wife in a cottage by a lake. So when he got the chance to enter the army and serve his country by participating in a life altering experiment, he was hesitant. The one thing that pushed him was his drive to do what is right. His hatred for bullies and desire to help people overrode his preference for routine and simplicity. After Project Rebirth, Steve became accustomed to change and started to become better at processing it. Going from scrawny and sickly to muscular and super strengthened was an adversity on it's own. He started out performing stupid shows as a way to gain soldiers and support America, telling himself that he was making a change, but when it came down to it, he wasn't. He wasn't making the vital difference he originally intended to do.
“Ok, ok, sorry. That is adorable, Steve. I’m so happy to see how far you have come. That’s amazing. So what now? Do you know if Tony likes you back?”
It must have been at least an hour as Tony sat in the waiting room, answering emails as he waited for Steve. Ever since that morning, the super soldier had been on edge. He looked like he could have fainted any second. Tony knew that he really wanted to do this; that it had to be done at some point, but the poor man looked like he was killing himself over it. Tony made sure to keep checking in on him, but everytime he said that he was ready, so here they were. He was also very glad they did those breathing exercises because Steve probably wouldn't have even made it to the room if they didn't. He looked 100% better afterwards, so hopefully he was fine.
ago. The heat of Steve's eyes could be felt burning into the side of Tony's face, only fanning the flames to the small flutter of anxiety that blossomed inside Tony’s chest. He had already faced the judgment for that decision long ago, and he hadn’t been prepared for more, especially from Captain America himself. Not yet at least. The idea that this man, who obviously held traditional ideals, could quite possibly turn his back on Tony and abandon their friendship over a lifestyle Tony maintained, scared Tony to no end. The fact that this man also wasn’t just a normal person, but the person whom Tony’s father raved over for years and installed the urge to live up to Steve’s legacy, also fueled Tony’s fear. He never wanted to feel the need to obey his father, but this was something nailed into his brain permanently. Now that Steve was back, this need was more prominent than ever. He felt that somehow, if he was able to live up to Steve’s standards, in a way he would be not only impressing Steve, but also earning that small amount of pride that he had never gained from his Father before he passed. This was Tony’s only chance to obtain this and finally settle his uneasy feelings that still lingered all this time. If this were to be ruined, Tony would be stuck with this lack of pride forever. Therefore, with all of this in mind, when Steve mentioned this word and associated it with Tony, almost all of this hope of wholeness had vanished in Tony’s mind abruptly.
Steve looked back at the movie, looking as the characters interacted. Tony and this cartoon woman did share some similar personality traits. They were both sassy, confident, and smug. And Steve wasn’t ashamed to admit that he also shared some of Hercules’ traits being strong, a little naive, kind, courageous, and slightly timid. He blushed at the thought. Seeing these 2 characters show obvious chemistry made him wonder if both himself and Tony displayed the same thing so obvious to others. Although this was a cartoon, they seemed to make a perfect fit as a disney prince and princess. Steve’s face only reddened more at the thought of himself and Tony in those roles.
Suddenly, Thor appeared in the doorway dressed in pajama pants and a sweatshirt. It looked kind of strange to see the norse god dressed so casually without his armor. His expression of concern soon turned into confusion as he saw Steve, who was still in the stairwell. The soldier still was holding Tony’s ankle, desperate to win the race still, although Tony was right when he said he entered the room first.
Inching up to the gate, Tony was buzzed into the garage and pulled into his spot with ease. The silence was more deafening now that the engine was off and the snow no longer surrounded them. Tony wanted to downright stop breathing right then as it’s volume increased, or maybe it was only loud to Tony. His brain seemed to short circuit as the sound of his pounding heartbeat grew louder and louder too. He forced himself to focus and push these ridiculous thoughts back down.
After a few more outfit changes and adjustments from Tony, Steve was all set up with a new wardrobe. They got him several outfits, pajamas, gym wear and some basic hygiene necessities. At the end when they reached the cashier, Tony was so thankful that Steve was too distracted with the magazines and trinkets to see the price. He didn't want Steve to feel any guilt or negative feelings for the rest of the day. Tony couldn't even begin to imagine what Steve had been through that morning. Of course he probably was feeling better after having released a lot of his bottled up emotions. After hearing Steve say that he couldn't even cry, Tony felt his heart melt in sympathy. His mind immediately recalled some similar thoughts after Afghanistan. He has had a lot of experience with going through a traumatic event and not fully being able to understand it.
One day, Tony literally fell out of the ceiling, into Steve’s arms, and (surprisingly enough) Steve became even more smitten. His heart filled even more with affection as he took Tony back to their room for yet another pillow fight. They fooled around like children for a while longer, before setting out to get some art supplies for Steve. The soldier’s fingers itched way too much. He missed sketching and feeling the relaxed sense he would get from it, but most of all, he wanted to draw Tony. The man always had this presence about him that Steve desperately wanted to get onto paper. He knew he would never be able to capture that essense specifically, but he wanted to try. And to maybe have an excuse to stare at Tony for a long period of time.
“Figures." Tony snorted, leaning closer to Steve to get some popcorn. The close proximity caught him off guard, making it impossible to stop the involuntary blush.
Steve finds out about Tony's late night work binges and angst ensues. Poor Tony is still haunted by Khan but finally opens up to Steve. Very fluffy ending!
Another Chapter finally done! Thanks to all for your patience. Next chapter is gonna be overflowing with angst and fluff so get ready. The plot is thickening! Til next time~
The soldier turned around to look at himself in the mirror. As he did, Tony tried to calm his heart from the panic that was making it race. Why would he say something, especially in that
A loud snort escaped Steve's lips, as he raised his hand to smack it against Tony's shoulder. "You're a child."
The yelling stopped. And Steve paused. The rage started to fade as his shoulders and gaze dropped again. “It hurts. And I feel it all the time. It never stops.”
Tony had underestimated how strong Steve's push for 40's style fashion was. He was consistently grabbing every plaid shirt and tan khaki pants they passed, resulting in Tony snatching them away to give him jeans and sweaters. Once they collected all they needed (or rather Tony picked and chose articles of clothing, adding them to the pile Steve carried as he trailed behind), the duo hit the fitting rooms.
Tony had purposefully picked this outfit along with many other options, trying to combine the style that Steve prefered while also trying to modern it up a little without totally making him uncomfortable. Standing up, Tony stood directly in front of the soldier. Thinking nothing of it, he reached around Steve's waist (or tried to at least) and tugged the button up down from where it bunched up under the sweater. He tugged the sweater too, fixing it from its twisted position. The sleeves were rolled up to his elbows, and straightened. Stepping back, he put a hand over his mouth, silently admiring his work. Fighting a grin, Tony faked a sniffle as if he were crying.
aka Pepper ships stony, Natasha is secretly evil and plots something malicious, and Tony is flustered.
The door opened and 2 more people stepped through. They were donned in dark blue uniforms with an eagle logo on the top.
This chapter is a little slow, I know. But I promise, the build up WILL be worth it. I'm more excited about the chapters up next. This one was a little boring not going to lie, so I'm updating early. Just working up to develop the characters and set up the plot. It will pick up within the next few updates ^^ Thank you for your patience and support! New chapter soon to come!
“Steven is the valiant hero and Anthony is this sassy woman! I see it!” Thor laughed, holding his stomach as Clint wore a smile of victory.
Hey guys! Again, I'm so excited for where this story is going to go. I'm expecting a few more chapters after this before the finale :) glad that this story is sparking so much enjoyment! Feel free to give your thoughts in the comments!
There, Tony met Yinsen. The humble translator was the person who inspired Tony to keep going, to not give up and not submit. He was Tony Stark. The Tony Stark and no one can take that from him. Yinsen reminded him of the teachings he learned from Jarvis, motivating him even more. He assisted Tony in assembling not only a powerhouse for a source of renewable energy the size of Tony's palm, but an escape plan. The power house of energy was an Arc Reactor Tony used to power his magnet and their transportation to escape. From only the scraps left available to them, they constructed a suit of metal. The plan was almost a success. The only unplanned part was Yinsen sacrificing himself.
Steve's POV of the clean up and Tony's sacrifice. Things are starting to heat up in the feelings department as Steve gets some realizations. Please enjoy this fluffy and angst filled chapter!
It came to him one night after he settled Tony down after a nightmare. He had gotten up to get a glass of water, and when he returned to bed, Tony was laying on his stomach, looking as peaceful as ever. The tear tracks had been all wiped away, and he seemed at peace. Suddenly, the genius reached to the right, grasping at the sheets on Steve’s side of the bed. He was reaching for Steve in his sleep. In a whirlwind of emotions, Steve could only feel one thing, and that was love. He was in love with Tony.
Gathering all of his courage, he approached Natasha. The two of them had grown extremely close and he felt comfortable enough to confide in her for advice. They talked about all of the meetings, and Steve poured everything onto her, unable to hold the walls up any further. He told her all about his revelation about his feelings for Tony, help from Daliah to accept them, and plan for courtship. He recalled the end of the conversation that occured after they had sparred in private.
Feelings are finally uncovered as Steve attempts something called "flirting". The team also has their first movie night full of fluff.
Tony opens up to Steve a little more, helping the 2 bond. And Steve's frustrated and confused. What else is new?
“Greetings, Friends!” A voice boomed from the elevator carrying an ecstatic tone. Yeah, that was definitely Thor. “How are-Anthony! Are you alright?!"
The bombs weren't defused. The plane was barreling straight towards America. Steve was alone on this mission. He gripped onto the cold handles of the plane, watching the horizon, searching desperately for an answer out there in the snow. The only answer that lie blatantly ahead was one that was not ideal. But it was the only one. Peggy's voice cracked through the radio. She sounded sad. Empty. She also saw the same answer in the snow like Steve.
“Cap, what’s wrong? Is it… do you have bad memories here? I’m sorry baby, it must have been a rough crash landing…” she said soothingly, running her hands up and down his arms to calm him.
Toni looked amazing in a form fitting red dress, her bouquet set to the side as she fondly watched Pepper and Happy move gracefully in their first dance.
Cap – Steve – put down his burden and wrapped Toni in his arms, a shaky breath revealing how moved he was to finally have his real name back.
Steve had a lot of content to fill his nightmares, but the smoking, blood-soaked battleground would hold a special place. He had a nasty cut on his arm and what felt like several cracked ribs as well as being covered in bruises. But worst of all, he had lost track of Toni.
He played at teasing her this morning, getting her close, hearing her moan and pant before backing off, keeping his touch too light for her to finish.
She clung tightly to his neck, wondering if she had grossly overestimated how balanced and reasonable this man was.
It was getting dark, and though he could move through the jungle with ease no matter the time of day, he did not think she would be as able yet.
She trailed her hands over his skin where it was in shadow, in case her eyes were not picking up marks in the low light. She urged him to extend his legs so she could examine them too. Still nothing. And she had been intimately pressed against his back enough to know there were no scars there.
But she could not stop. The drones were made of stealth gear and had resisted their efforts to track them thus far. The only feasible strategy was good old-fashioned line of sight.
Cap grabbed his cock by the base, holding it firmly for a minute and taking a bracing breath before he lined himself up and pushed in.
He tried to cool his excited body in the water, but Toni submerged her head, flipping her short, dark hair up so water sprayed everywhere, droplets clinging to her elegant neck and exposed back.
Toni woke to twittering birds, stray rays of sunlight poking through the trees and a handsome, naked man looking at her adoringly.
“Yes. I will take you. Whatever you need.” He did not know where the words came from – stilted as they were, it was the longest sentence he had been able to string together where he knew exactly what he was saying.
Cap did not know what to call this creature. He could not recall ever having seen one before. But it grabbed lightly at his shoulders in a friendly sort of way before it settled next to him, also having a drink.
“Huh. Guess that explains your pearly whites.” She said, smiling at him and helping herself to some au natural toothpaste.
“Cap… Cap, I’m- I’m coming!” she cried, her channel clenching down on Cap’s pistoning cock, her back arching as she cried out her pleasure. The volume of her moans briefly drowned out the sound of him thrusting inside her soaked pussy. Cap continue to pump into her, his rhythm turning more erratic now. The hand that had been between them thumbing her clit was now beside her as he brought his body down, pressing himself against her for as much skin contact as possible.
“Cap, can you show me how to get down from here? Without any moves that will further press on my bladder?”
He hovered around her all day, bringing her water and food, holding parts of her suit still while she worked on them, listening to the almost constant stream of chatter that poured from her mouth. She taught him a whole slew of new words – ‘suit’, ‘drone’, ‘tools’, ‘metal’, ‘toilet’ and ‘kickass’ for example, along with all her names for fruit and almost everything in their eyeline. The more words he learned, the more the buzzing in his head increased, the strange sense that he knew what the word was going to be before she said it.
The wedding was beautiful, as elegant as one would expect an event organised by Pepper Potts to be. Toni would have paid for everything if they had let her, but Pepper and Happy had talked her down to just the food, drink and cake. Plus a sizeable contribution to the honeymoon.
She looked at him appraisingly. “You know Florence Nightingale, I haven’t spotted any battle scars on you. Makes me wonder where you got all this practice. See? Scars.” She said, gesturing to her leg, then chest where the arc reactor used to be.
The very thought made her shudder. Even mostly powered down, it was her only resource to keep her safe in this wild world.
Toni sped through the air, chasing the HYDRA drone that held the package the Avengers had been sent to retrieve.
“Are you crazy man? Warn a girl, jeez…” She may be being slightly overdramatic, given some of the stunts she had pulled in the Iron Woman suit, but he did not know that.
“Lips.” He whispered back to her. She did not need to look down again to see the response he was having to her game. It was the one body part she had reluctantly missed on her mapping.
Cap looked back at her. “Family.” He said, pointing out west, a different direction from where they had been for the past few days.
She walked in quickly, making a beeline to the control panel. She dug out a screwdriver she always kept on the gauntlet on her person and opened up a panel almost on the underside.
“Yesss.” He was almost whimpering. “Feel good, want you… make you happy…” he replied in his slightly-broken English.
“I’m not surprised, not exactly clear line of sight for the satellites. While you’re at it, cross reference missing or downed quinjets in the African jungle. That’s where I’m calling you from, might help narrow down the radius.”
“You’re so beautiful.” She whispered heatedly. His eyelids fluttered slightly at her tone, but he forced them back open to watch her. His hand squeezed hers in what she took as a silent request to keep talking.
He followed the movements of her body, rolling his hips in likeness. He groaned once more, Toni burying her face in his neck and nipping at the skin there.
It was a leopard, half shrouded in shadow but staring intently at her. Its head was low and shoulders hunched, as though it were getting ready to pounce.
? Steve baby, no one blames you for what happened! The tesseract blew the controls, no one could have fixed that – not even me. The fact that you managed to survive at all is a miracle, not something to apologise for or regret. You hear me?” she spoke forcefully.
The grin and twinkle in her eye caused a surprising bolt of arousal to ricochet through his body. The thought that she
Toni nodded. Anything that cut through a SHILED operative’s apparent amnesia to set off alarm bells as ‘not safe’ was something she wasn’t opening without her suit.
“What… the fuck… this fucking place…” Toni panted. She pointed from the direction they came from. “Are there any more wild fucking animals set on killing me? Is it normal to be attacked this often? I mean, I’m attacked pretty often but that’s a professional hazard. This feels more personal.”
He matched her energy, picking her up again to wrap her legs around his waist so he could lower them both to the floor.
Once he was buried balls deep he fell forward, catching himself on his hands and kissing Toni messily.
Once on the platform, he urged Toni to take a seat and grabbed some more of the cleaning plant to treat her leg once again, resting it on his lap.
He let out a guttural sigh, moulding his hands to their shape. Still he pressed against her, his forehead resting against hers even as he tried to watch his thumbs brush over her nipples. She held his head in her hands and gently urged it down.
He licked down to her entrance, darting in with his tongue. She was practically dripping. A groan ripped from his throat. His tongue messily made its way back to her clit, rubbing her just right.
He pointed to the sky and back towards his nest to try and convey his message, once again gesturing like he wanted to pick her up - he would like to pick her up, to be close enough to smell her hair.
She could not get any words out to tell him off for being fucking crazy enough to entrust his and her combined weight to the vines he was using, not that he would have understood her. She hoped he knew the way back to the suit on the ground because she was NOT flying through the air like this again.
Toni was taken aback by the earnest declaration. What does someone say when an ex-SHIELD, wild jungle man tells you he loves you after you just had sex in his treehouse?
She gave him a meaningful look and scooted back a few inches, finally nodding to let him know that it was alright, she wanted him to take care of himself.
He pressed his lips back to hers for a longer time, withdrawing slightly but still leaning into her space.
She reluctantly withdrew, sitting back to observe his dazed expression, slightly puffed up lips surrounded by his scruffy beard and when her eyes travelled lower, streaks of pearly liquid decorating his stomach and a still half-hard cock loosely held in his large hand.
Steve heard himself yell, fighting tooth and nail to get there, get to Toni, don’t let her get hurt-
Toni stole one last glance at the profile he cast – perfect glutes and a dick that she would be equal parts intimidated and excited to see at full strength. She took a quick gulp of water, missing her toothbrush. Cap slinked silently to her side, leaving no more than an inch between their bodies as he offered her a shell with a gritty paste in it. He dipped in a finger and scrubbed it over his teeth, indicating for her to do the same.
They flew back to New York a couple of days after their jungle rescue, landing on the Tower’s helipad. They had a few hours to get settled, to show Steve around, before James ‘Bucky’ Barnes would be joining them.
“I would be happy to provide some advice on how you can update some of your Stark Tech, really bring it in to the current century.” Shuri joked.
Around them a bright blue light beam appeared. The black box and two HYDRA cases went up first, followed next by the broken-down Iron Woman suit and left-over drone skeleton and pieces. Toni felt a slight tug on her body and then nothing. She was weightless.
“Toni…” he ground out, eyes darting down to watch her clever hand stroke him. She seemed to know exactly what would make him feel good. She thumbed the sensitive part under his head, then wrapped her fingers around him for short, firm strokes. Her focus on his sensitive cockhead was perfect, sending sparks up his spine.
She turned to face him, her expression rather serious. He had been pensive for the rest of the day, quiet.
“Yes. Always.” He responded immediately, raising their now entwined hands to his lips to kiss her knuckles.
He changed the angle of his hand to bury three wide fingers in her, moving them slowly while his thumb came up to brush her clit.
It was only just twilight, and she was far from ready for sleep. She patted the floor in front of her for him to sit, which he did eagerly and immediately.
Perhaps if he had felt free to move around, to fight unencumbered by the injured woman behind him, he might have been able to avoid being pinned down by the wild animal.
She stepped forward slowly to the side of the craft. The side was ajar, as he remembered. He took a deep breath, reaching out to touch Toni’s arm. She paused, looking at him. He stepped forward. He would not allow her to step forward into a confined area with who knows what in it.
“And this, baby, this is my cunt. Feel that, how I’m wet? You can slip your fingers in here.” She said a little breathlessly, her finger tracing of her entrance.
“Sergeant Barnes? Toni Stark. Nice to meet you. Steve’s been telling me all about you for a few days now.” She said, shamelessly selling Steve out for being excited to meet his friend again.
“Tony, you’re an idiot. Of course he likes you. He comes here practically everyday to hang out with you,” says Rhodey, lowering his voice. He rests his elbows on the counter as Tony busies himself with counting out the register.
As Tony stares fondly at the mural, he finishes wiping a glass and puts it in its designated spot before rounding the counter and taking a seat across from Steve at their usual table.
to me. You ask how my day is and are genuinely interested in the answer.” He meets Steve’s eyes. “I know I can be a force of nature at times, but it doesn’t seem to bother you in the slightest. I can’t tell you how many people I talk to, and I can tell that all they’re seeing is a talking bag of money. People think they can’t connect with me, so they don’t even try.”
Puberty hadn’t been kind to Steve and his growth spurt stopped once he hit 5’6”. He makes up for his small stature with a big personality and sunny disposition. He grew up scrappy and was caught in many street fights but doesn’t regret a single one because he doesn’t tolerate bullying and isn’t afraid to stand up for what’s right.
The idea comes to Tony one day as he’s nursing a latte in a coffee shop down the street from Stark Tower. He had finally finished going over R&D’s latest project and found a chance to escape from work to wind down a little bit. Sitting there basking in the cozy atmosphere of the cafe, he sees how comfortable so many of the patrons look — how content they are to casually spend time with their friends as if they have nothing to worry about at the moment. For the most part the baristas seem happy too, with their friendly greetings and widening smiles when they see regulars walk through the door.
“Tony talks about you all the time. It’s good to finally put a face to the name,” Rhodey says with a smug grin.
“Oh, of course, this can’t be your only job.” Steve nods in understanding, then frowns. “I was actually wondering, doesn’t the shop close at 6? Why are you still working when it’s almost 9?”
It’s one of the rare days where Tony manages to get to the shop early on and pitch in during regular store hours. Peter is in the back rolling out dough with Butterfingers and Tony is behind the counter punching in orders when the cutest man he’s ever seen in his life steps up to the bar.
Tony quickly learns that Steve is caring and compassionate in a way that only a teacher can be, putting his students before himself, and holding their wellbeing and education to the highest standard. Tony only wishes that his teachers were as thoughtful when he was the gawky fourteen year old kid in advanced arithmetic courses at MIT.
Every once in a while, Steve would bring two of his closest friends to Y NOT. Steve tends to seem more relaxed when he’s around them, so Tony is thankful for their presence at times. Bucky, Steve’s childhood best friend, was in the army before he got honorably discharged. Now he’s getting his degree in integrative neuroscience at Fordham.
“I can’t believe you’re being rude to one of the great servicemen of our country. Shame on you.” Rhodey laughs, leaning back in his chair.
Tony ropes in his favorite research assistant Peter to help out at the store. Peter’s aunt May occasionally brings by baked goods to sell. DUM-E and U get a new baby brother, Butterfingers, who helps out full time at Y NOT. DUM-E trains him on how to brew the drinks and Bruce teaches him his croissant recipe. Jarvis shows him YouTube videos on how to make different kinds of iced tea.
“Are you sure about this, Tony?” Pepper asks. “Not that I’m saying no to this opportunity, but are you sure?”
The moment they get to Stark Tower, Tony feels a shift in the atmosphere between them. Steve is strangely quiet on the way up to the penthouse. He’s holding himself stiffly, and the air in the elevator is buzzing with tension of the unsexy kind.
The man’s blue eyes widen in embarrassment and he shakes his head. “No, you’re great,” he blurts, seeming to realize the error he’d made instantly. He stammers on. “
There is only one customer so far, as Tony had forgotten to post the hours yet again. Halfway through cleaning the espresso machine, Steve walks in.
“Tony. I’m going to say this again. You’re an idiot.” Rhodey grins over the top of his coffee mug and elects to say no more. He saunters over to a table near the counter so he can remain within talking distance of Tony.
On the morning of Y NOT’s first anniversary, Tony unveils a new mural painted across the cafe’s largest wall.
Tony’s not sure where he went wrong or if there was something he did between the trip from the restaurant to the tower that may have made Steve change his mind. The last thing he wants to do is pressure Steve into anything he isn’t ready for, particularly if he’s uncomfortable even being around Tony. But they’d had such a nice time, hadn’t they? Was he completely blind to the fact that Steve found him repulsive?
It’s comfortable. Y NOT quickly becomes Tony’s safe space, like his workshop in the tower. But unlike the workshop, Y NOT is the safe space where Tony goes to welcome socializing, not escape from it.
They don’t go to a diner. Instead, they opt for cozy, family-run pizzeria that Tony frequents when he needs comfort food. They spend hours in the quaint pizzeria, discussing their day, talking about their friends, and any other topic that may arise in their easy conversation.
Together, they finish up the rest of Tony’s closing duties in record time. Tony locks up the store and takes Steve’s hand in his as they walk down the street.
In impeccable detail, Steve has drawn himself and Tony sitting together in a diner with a plate of fries and a milkshake between them. However, the food remains untouched and ignored, the two men in the sketch gazing at each other with matching smiles on their faces and Steve’s hand holding Tony’s on top of the table.
Tony knows, practically, that he has too much on his plate to even consider a venture like this. And as much as he loves coffee, these businesses are a dime a dozen in New York. The romantic that’s usually hidden deep down within him, however, decides he wants it anyway. He’s going to open his own coffee shop.
As they step out of the elevator, Tony is about to ask if Steve is alright when the man in question cuts through the silence.
Rhodey stares between the two of them as he leans against the counter. “So, Tony tells me you’re a teacher, Steve?”
Early on, Tony decides to do away with traditional store hours since his schedule tends to be highly unpredictable and he wants to be present at the cafe as much as possible without it interfering with his sleep or SI work.
“They listen to me because I have money. Because I’m Tony Stark, the genius billionaire industrialist.” Tony smiles. “You talk to Tony the barista.”
The store is next to a chocolate processing factory which helps with bringing in customers who want a nice cup of coffee to balance out the sweetness. Business is surprisingly booming early on, and he quickly realizes he needs to hire more staff to keep the shop running on days when he’s not around (which, disappointingly enough, is a lot of the time).
Tony decides early on that the shop is going to be his own private passion project. He doesn’t want the cafe to be associated with SI in any way, so giving it the Stark name is out of the question. The problem is, he
Tony picks up the pen laying on the desk between them and hands it to her. “You’re the one always telling me to find some time for myself and relax. I can’t do that if I’m both the CEO and CTO. I trust you to do what’s best for the company. You’ve practically been running it for years anyway. Besides, now I can focus on the true love of my life. Coffee.”
In the mural, Tony’s family of bots is gathered by the tasting station. DUM-E, with his claw hanging forlornly over a hill of spilled coffee beans. U, using a blender as a scoop. And Butterfingers, holding a tray of his signature croissants. Off to the side, a group of friends hangs out next to the coffee counter, chatting and laughing together. Behind the bar, the brunet barista is happily teaching a shorter blond man how to use the espresso machine.
“Oh! Oh I’m sure he doesn’t talk about me that much. I’m not that interesting…” Steve answers bashfully.
Steve shakes Butterfingers’ hand. “Hey there. If your name is Butterfingers, should you really be around fragile ceramics and glassware?”
Of course Pepper doesn’t mind. She knows how much more relaxed Tony has been since he opened Y NOT. “Definitely not. Pepper knows I like working here and trusts that as long as my two jobs don’t interfere with each other, I can open up shop as often as I want. Usually if I remember then I’ll let people know on Twitter when we’re open after hours.”
” Steve gapes in awe at the impressive penthouse. Stone floors, a sunken living room situated next to a cozy fireplace, and large, floor-to-ceiling windows that give him the most gorgeous view of the city anyone could ever see.
“Is something wrong with your coffee?” he asks politely. Not everyone is pleased with their first cup. But with some tinkering, he usually always finds the blend that works well for each patron.
Their hands touch, fingers brushing and interlacing. Their feet tap against each other, Steve’s foot running one way and Tony’s running another.
Intrigued, Tony stops what he’s doing and gives Steve his full attention, dropping his failed attempt at acting casual. “A surprise gift? Those are the best.”
Two weeks after Rhodey leaves, Tony finds himself working in store earlier than usual. He gets there in the early afternoon and stays until closing, needing the menial work to occupy his hands and mind after a stressful meeting with R&D.
“Hey Tony.” Steve approaches the counter timidly with hands behind his back. “I, uh. I saw you were closing and I wasn’t going to come in and bother you. But I got something for you, figured I should give it to you sooner rather than later.”
. Have time for himself, work on things unrelated to SI, discover what he’s passionate about besides the advancement of technology, and maybe develop some genuine relationships with people who care about him as just Tony. Not Tony Stark.
He doesn’t want to sound ungrateful, because he knows he’s luckier than most, to be born not only into a wealthy family, but also blessed with stellar intellect. Many people would be happy with just one of the two. But this also means many people have no idea the kind of stress and pressure Tony constantly feels in his everyday life.
For a moment, Tony thinks Steve will refuse, and he prepares himself for the inevitable rejection. But the blush creeping into Steve’s cheeks, followed by his apprehensive though delighted nod makes Tony’s heart leap with joy.
Over time, Tony gets to know more about Steve through shy, brief conversations at the testing stations. He’s a born-and-bred Brooklynite, went to Pratt and graduated with a degree in fine arts, but ultimately pursued a career in teaching to pay the bills. His mother’s a nurse and raised him all by herself after his dad died when Steve was four. He likes to draw in his free time, and he loves his students just as much as he loves his art.
After Steve leaves, Rhodey turns to Tony and asks, “So, Mr. Stank, when are you going to ask Steve on a date?”
at naming things. All his products are attached with “Stark” because he’s only creative with designs and not words. When he does attempt to think of non-Stark names, well...he named his bots DUM-E and U.
A surprising question since Tony clearly recalls Steve recognizing him the day they met. “I thought you knew? I distinctly remember you saying ‘I know’ when I told you my name.”
“Do you think there will be others, then? Any of our friends?” Tony asks, his tone flat and devoid of hope.
He notices Pepper Potts looking at him curiously. Pepper was the Stark Industries CEO and is one of Tony’s closest friends. The jealousy and sadness suddenly disappears. He’s glad that Tony had Pepper and Rhodey, that he has friends who would choose him, who wouldn’t lie to him. If Steve had to go back to two years ago, knowing the outcome of choosing Bucky, he knows his choice. He would still choose Bucky, the way Tony would have chosen Rhodey if their situations had been reversed. But he would have told Tony the truth this time. And he still despised the Accords, but he could have found a way to get them amended, and to get Bucky out without arousing too much suspicion. He would have found a way to be there for Tony, to be ready when Thanos came. He would have stayed. But there isn’t time to waste on stupid fantasies and would-haves.
But Steve had very conveniently left out one person in his fantasy- Ty Stone. Tiberius Stone who loved Tony and who would be Tony’s
Before DC, Tony had been happy for a while. He and Pepper had broken up and he’d known it would happen but it was still painful. But he’d shifted into the Avengers tower and he had friends and Steve was his friend and then Steve had kissed him. He’d been giddy with happiness.
“I can’t believe I fucked us up,” Steve says, voice soft. “Fate, destiny, the universe, soulbonds- all that undone by my selfishness? God, Tony, who fucks up something that the universe has fought for?”
And just like that, the battle was over and they were all on their way for shawarma, Steve and Tony starting out first as Clint and Nat stayed back to report to Fury and Thor went to look for Bruce.
“I guess we should figure out where we are. And if there’s anyone else here.” Tony doesn’t say anything but he holds his hand out. Steve takes it and they walk in silence.
(When the phone had finally rung, he’d been terrified. He’d heard Tony’s voice so many times over the past two years, but all those instances were from his various interviews and press conferences. It wasn’t the real Tony, but a cold, stoic facade. When it was Bruce’s panicked voice that came through, a part of him was almost disappointed before he’d put all those personal feelings aside and attempted to focus on the crisis.)
(Before everything, Tony’s smiles were more free. He’d get to witness them every time he snuck into the workshop with takeout, or when he handed Tony another of his doodles of Tony and DUM-E, or even those eyes-closed sleepy smiles that appeared when Steve tucked Tony into bed with a forehead kiss. Steve doesn’t think he’ll ever be the cause for one of those smiles again.)
Steve isn’t worried about that, he’s always known that Tony did what he did because of Steve, not Bucky. He’d had to see a man killing his mother and then face someone he trusted and find out that he was lied to. Even the best people would lash out in such a situation, and Tony was the best of the best, but he was only human. He doesn’t even need to apologise. The only person apologising should be Steve.
“Maybe I should thank you for the vacation, Stark. Finally got to spend some time with my family.” Clint’s words are a little clipped, but there’s a tentative offer of friendship there, to put the past behind them.
But there was no time to think about any of that. He had to get to his shield and then get to Tony. Or get to Tony and then the shield. Thankfully, all the Avengers had their comms on them.
“Wedding’s still off for now. All the guests have been evacuated,” said Bruce. He hadn’t hulked out yet but was helping Happy and Rhodey get everything in order.
“I know that science doesn’t work in this realm the way it does on Earth. I know that because JARVIS isn’t working. But I know that independent energy sources are, because most of my suit is still functional and so is the arc reactor. But I don’t know what kind of energy soulbond energy is, or how to harness it. I don’t even know if it
He doesn’t hate Steve anymore, not that he ever really can. He just isn’t as angry as he had been at first. Knowing that those two years had been a lie did sting at first. But later, he realised that not all of it was a lie. There was one big lie but some of it was good, some of his memories were happy, some of their time had been real.
(Tony doesn’t cry like most people do with tears streaming down their cheeks. He closes his eyes and his shoulders shake as he waits for the tears to stop flowing. They get caught up in his eyelashes and make his eyes appear red-rimmed. Steve remembers the few nights when Tony would wake up after nightmares and sob in his own quiet, restrictive way. Steve’s shirts would be slightly wet on the days that he found Tony and held him close, keeping those shoulders steady and leading him back to his bed. Those were the days and nights where he had fallen in love without ever realising it, before DC and before SHIELD and HYDRA, before everything had become so immensely complicated.)
And then there’s Steve and Tony again. Even in a room full of people, it always feels like it’s just the two of them.
(Tony has had this look of Steve’s directed at him once, before, in Siberia, in the cold when Tony had asked if Steve had known. After that, Tony often wondered whether it was that same look of misery that had graced his features when he’d left, when he’d left Tony, or whether he’d been indifferent. Tony had never imagined he’d see such a pained look on Steve’s face ever again, so he’d committed it to memory in his bitterness, back then. With all the pain that Steve had caused him, it was a comfort to know that Steve hadn’t escaped unscathed.)
“Oh well, maybe you were right and the fact that Ty hasn’t said a thing to me today is making me second guess this.” Tony had to be joking, right? Besides, Steve couldn’t afford getting distracted by some random comment.
“Well, first time for everything, huh. I’ve never been stuck in an orange dimension before. I might as well as hold on to the one thing that tells me I’m a genius in such a weird environment.”
He agonised for so long about his hypothetical proposition that Toni eventually finished splashing around and was wading out of the water.
She raised her hands to cup his cheeks, drawing him back to her lips. She kept it sweet, slowly moving her lips against his, letting her bottom lip be drawn into his tentative movements as he got the hang of it. When she drew back, he let out a soft sound, making her smile.
“Yes! That’s it baby, don’t stop. Fuck me. Faster!” she cried, her hands and flexing legs guiding him to what she liked.
Cap was still smiling slightly, seeming amused by her reaction but also hovering close to her to ensure she did not misstep and tumble out of the tree. He held her bicep in what would have been an aggressive and unwelcome way coming from another man, but from him was clearly born of concern and felt tender.
He had clenched his eyes as he moved forward, panting and seemingly unable to deal with the dual stimuli of feeling himself sheathed inside her cunt and watching it happen at the same time.
“I look forward to it. Unless I manage to propose first...” She said warmly back, kissing him softly on the lips before resting her head against his chest.
He threw it back again, letting out a deep, guttural sound that would have had her scrambling away if it were not in her defence.
Her right calf had four long scratches, two deep enough to be worrying but not the shreds she had expected to find. She supposed the mountain man had grabbed the big cat just as it made contact, where it had no doubt been aiming for the femoral artery in her thigh.
Steve had cut his hair and shaved his beard, a huge symbolic move for re-joining the world. Toni had seen pictures of him before he went missing (both pre and post serum) and he looked almost the same, maybe 1 or 2 extra years on him. His strong jaw was now on show, and she couldn’t help but nip at it in the corridor, backing him up against the wall. They made out like teenagers for a while, Steve more than happy to indulge Toni’s desires, but then Jarvis spoke.
“I see. Well if you want to talk about it – I’m not exactly an expert in psychology or the human brain, but I’ve been SHILED adjacent for a while, so… happy to help you out. If I can.” She finished.
He hated the hesitation in her voice, like she felt that she could not ask him anything that was within his power to deliver.
“You’re welcome.” He parroted obligingly, a small smile and sparkling eyes demonstrating his delight in being able to converse with her. She resolved to teach him a few words tomorrow. She would even avoid the temptation of starting with curse words. The idea of this man saying anything dirty seemed strangely inappropriate.
She was even more beautiful up close. Her dark eyes were hypnotic, and her smooth pale skin looked so soft and pure, nothing like his. And she was smiling and chattering like she was comfortable with him, even when she was injured. He felt very privileged.
She looked at Cap thoughtfully, trying to figure him out. He was in many ways the definition of an alpha male – demonstrably strong, every bit the provider and protective as hell. But he also wore his heart on his sleeve, his admiration for Toni extremely apparent.
Toni chuckled. “You’re pretty cute and bashful for a 6 foot 5 specimen of pure muscle that takes down apex predators with his bare hands.”
Once he was on his knees next to the bed, her legs spread wide over the side so he could eat her out, she fervently promised herself that she was going to pin him down and see how long he would last with her mouth on him.
“Steve… I wanted to say thank you. For everything you’ve done for me. Full on heroic rescue, guardian angel stuff really. But I also want you to know… I’m glad it happened. I’m glad I found you, even if it took a crash landing to do so.”
She ground shamelessly against him, groaning at the hard cock that pressed against her through their coverings.
“Hey big guy, it’s ok. I should be the one saying sorry, I shouldn’t have pushed you the way I did. I understand there are probably a lot of painful memories here and I rubbed your face in them.” She said, running a soothing hand up and down his back.
“A bit harder. Harder.” She repeated the word, reaching over to press down on his thumbs to dig into her muscles.
“Well I better wrap this up then. Full thrusters.” Toni said, throwing everything she had into a last burst of speed to catch up with the quick, slippery bastard.
Though he did not understand what she was saying apart from his name, he went to where she gestured, slowly lowering himself to the ground by her leg.
He seemed content here, happy. And Toni knew better than most that time in service, that time with SHIELD, was hardly rainbows and sunshine.
The more the mystery of this man unfolded, the more complex it grew. And it seemed like he remembered more about being a man, of his origins, than either of them gave him credit for.
She sighed. She was rapidly losing hope that he was going to be able to help her any further – unless another wild animal attacked, in which case she wanted him right by her side.
It may have been the perfect wake-up- if it had not meant that yesterday was not a dream. Cap’s smiling face, as attractive as it was, meant she was indeed stranded in the jungle, no one knew where she was or was able to track her and she had no way of getting back to civilisation, wherever that may be.
“Toni…” he murmured in awe as he climbed over her body, holding his weight off her as he kissed her thoroughly. She definitely had pegged him right as a post-coital cuddler.
The echoes of the gorilla’s bellowing followed them through the jungle as Cap carried them away at a brutal speed, Toni’s joints aching from how tightly she held on to his shoulders.
“Kiss.” She said again. She pressed on his shoulder gently to encourage him to sit again, which he did with a little reluctance.
She sighed, flopping down to take a break. She was running out of water. She would have to seek out some soon, but she had been hoping to restore her tracker system before then so she could start mapping out the immediate area and trace her way back to the suit easily.
He made a choking sound, pressing further into her. He moved to bury his head in her cunt, but she stopped him.
They were probably only swinging for about sixty seconds, but when Cap came to a stop on a massive, sturdy tree branch at least ten metres in the air, Toni scrambled down his torso to stand on her own two feet.
“Am I to take it… If I can open a line to SHIELD or some other government nearby tomorrow… you would come with me?” she finally asked the question that ha been haunting her for days.
The comforting warmth of his family was soothing, but it did not fill the gap he felt inside himself.
But in these tender moments, it felt like more. He took so much care in how he handled her, always seeking permission before he touched her, listening with rapt attention whenever she spoke as though he could divine the meaning of her words if he just focussed enough. He tended her injury so carefully and when it hurt, it was as though it pained him too. He was not just responsive, he proactively tried to meet her needs, in simple gestures like blowing a soothing, cool breath on to her leg or plying her with food and water like the jungle’s most attentive mother hen.
It screeched, reeling back in surprise which gave the wild man the advantage, quickly twisting his arms around the beasts’ neck hard, followed by a quick, brutal snap.
One moment Toni had a mesmerised, gorgeous man quivering in her hands. The next he had let her go abruptly, spinning around with an agitated huff, his eyes on the tree line.
“You like them huh? I guess some things are universal. You can touch them if you like…” Toni said, her hands trailing over her breasts, nails briefly brushing over her nipples, causing them to stand further to attention.
“Yes Toni.” He said, lifting her out of the water. He bundled up her clothes by the riverside, pressing them into her arms before carrying her back to the shelter.
Now he leaned forward to lightly peck the tip of her nose, moving back to watch her eyes open slowly to the morning light.
He wondered if he should make himself known. Would she approach him if he did? He was uncharacteristically nervous at the thought of being the one to approach her. He had never approached a woman before. He thinks.
Since she was having a rough time, she thought she deserved the odd treat when it presented itself, so she allowed her eyes to roam down Cap’s body. He looked like granite wrapped in smooth, tanned skin. Her fingers itched to wrap around his bicep, or run down his chest and skate over his abs. She could happily go further and certainly would have complete access to do so, seeing as Cap had lost the loin cloth overnight.
The Family looked at him curiously. He knew that sound meant danger, and he knew it was up to him to protect the Family from it.
He pulled his head back, keeping his fingers inside her to feel the pulsing of her orgasm die down, licking his lips to chase the taste of her as he leaned back to take her in. Still bent over her hips, his roaming gaze was hot and yearning.
The adrenalin of their close call had mostly faded by the time they sat in Cap’s shelter, finishing their dinner of yet more fruit. Toni guessed that Cap usually ate more protein than this, observing his muscles, but he had not parted himself from her long enough to hunt or forage for anything more complex.
She raised to arms in a silent invitation for him to pick her up, which he did with relish, holding her tight against his body. He leapt gracefully over the jungle floor, Toni a slight but reassuring weight in his arms.
She chuckled lightly. “No, you say ‘you’re welcome’. I say ‘thank you’, you say ‘you’re welcome’.” She gestured to show who should be saying what.
His wide hands immediately cupped her jaw, his lips covering hers fully. He quickly introduced his tongue, Toni pleased that he had taken his lessons so seriously.
She got up, wanting to see if there was any more copper wiring or something that might prove useful in any of the wall panels she had not yet looked in to. Two were mostly hidden from view – she only knew where to look because her father had likely designed this quinjet. It resembled old blueprints she had looked over in re-designing the newest models herself.
Toni was elbow deep in a suit, AC/DC blaring from the speakers. Shuri had a few pointers she was throwing in, but it was a lot of trial and error to make some of the enhancements work.
He scrambled over to help her out of the river and watched as she dried herself with her top and slipped back into her pants. She turned to face him with a smile.
Steve laughed again. She had never seen him laugh as much as he did tonight, a weight lifted off his shoulders that his old life would not be obtainable.
She winced, wiping her hand on her tights and looking back to her suit, as though Jarvis would somehow have resurrected himself to get her the stats on death-by-bug in the African jungle.
She sat back, rolling her shoulders in an exaggerated movement, a popping sound coming from her joints after being bent over the suit for so long.
He woke her up the next morning gently, seeking her permission before licking his way into her pussy.
He looked at her with a silent question in his eyes as he went to move forward, obviously not wanting her to yell at him again.
He rushed back toward Toni carrying a water in a bowl he had woven himself from broad leaves and the strongly scented plant he used to clean his own wounds. He was nervous to leave her alone after the leopard had attacked her. If he had been allowed, he would have carried her with him to the river to keep her safe.
His attentions were a balm to the suit maintenance of the day. She thought she had been close to hearing Jarvis’ voice today, and she had not realised how many hopes she had stacked on that until it became obvious late afternoon that it was not going to happen.
Toni turned in his arms, her small, clever hands reaching up to hold his jaw, pulling him down to meet her lips. His hands raised to hold her waist, enjoying the gentle movement of her lips.
She sighed, leaning down to fasten to her wrist gauntlet, picking up the tools and a tracking device she had yet to get back up and running. She moved to stand, being careful of her leg.
“You do.” She whispered back to him. “You make me so happy. You take care of me, protect me, give me everything I need, don’t you baby?” she said. Even amid playing up this Protector kink, Toni had to admit that he did. And while it went against her wide independence streak, it both warmed her heart and turned her on.
He felt a small smile tugging his lips. Even knowing her a few days, he understood how deadly curious Toni could be. It must be killing her not to interrogate him about who he was, about what he remembered and how much he understood. But she wasn’t because she suspected it might upset him.
The man moved so fluidly but had the presence of a mountain, diving forward to dodge the swipe of the leopard’s deadly claws, wrapping his big hands around its front leg and still managing to position himself protectively in front of Toni.
“It’ll be fine you know. Even if it is a bit awkward at first, you guys were best friends. You’ll find common ground.” She assured him.
He leapt to his feet instinctively, tuning his senses to the sounds so he could track it through the jungle.
They looked somehow firm and soft at the same time. They were perfectly curved, pressing together as she bent, bouncing slightly as she moved her body. He thought they looked like the perfect size to fit in his hands.
He once again handled her with incredible gentleness, allowing her to wrap her hands around his neck as he cradled her back and under her thighs to lift her off the ground. He inhaled deeply.
Toni pushed him firmly on to his back, kissing him deeply. Then her hand, slick with her own wetness, wrapped around his erection.
“Yes! Yes, please… I… please…” he said. He trembled slightly above her, his excitement tangible – certainly it was clear from the leaking tip of his cock.
He had left her for a little while after that, returning with her clothes they had to abandon by the river the day before. They were crumpled and the top streaked with mud from where the gorilla must have thrown them around, but better than risking sunburn on more sensitive areas.
“Toni, going to be ok.” Cap told her as she threw down one of the circuit boards from the drone. It was a mantra she had said multiple times in front of him, though it did sound reassuring coming from his lips.
He jumped deftly passed her, offering both his hands for her to hold as she stepped up onto the soft, padded platform.
Cap smiled. “Keep you safe.” He stroked her cheek tenderly, smiling at her with such a soft, fond expression.
Jarvis was still connected to her now – it was likely the connection would erode and make conversation impossible before rescue happened, but for now she was soaking up as much of Jarvis as she could.
He pushed himself up to stand, though his leg hurt where he could see a shard of something sticking out of him.
He was gentling as she relaxed her thighs to release him. He felt somewhat light-headed, his eyes drawn to the rise and fall of her bare chest as she caught her breath.
She took one of the proffered bananas and a drink of water. Cap seemed intent on feeing her up, offering more and more fruit and some kind of root vegetable until she had to wave him away, unable to eat any more even out of gratitude. He seemed to take some pleasure in watching her take her fill. She wondered if this might be some kind of primitive ‘provider’ mindset. She would have to set him straight if he tried to mount her as payment for feeding her.
“It might look like a mess, but there’s some rhyme to it. I’m separating all the- well, it doesn’t matter. I think I can probably manufacture enough to get a long-distance signal wrangled. But um…” she hesitated for a moment.
“Hmmm, I can see that. Two handsome young soldiers, charming the pants off everyone they meet. You two must have been beating them off with sticks.” Toni teased.
He stared back at her. She did not seem upset. If anything, she seemed to be at ease in his company.
This one was real. They had short, dark hair, long pale arms and slim legs covered in a dark material. They were smaller than him, the torso seeming so slight except for the curves encased in tight material on their chest which was strangely… captivating.
She reached up and pressed the wall, a sizeable hidden compartment popping out. Inside was a silver case, well preserved from its hiding place over the years. Toni pulled it out, but before she could open it, Cap was there. He covered her hands with his own.
He cried out roughly, the feel of her smaller, softer hand on him almost making him come immediately.
“No, I draw the line here. You- stay. Me? I’m going to pee in relative privacy. Stay.” She ordered again before she skipped quickly behind another tree to relieve herself. Thankfully Cap listened this time, his expression tight until she walked back to his side.
She deserved a life outside of her heroics, whether that was with him or Jarvis and her inventions, with Stark Industries or travelling around the world.
“Mmm. How sure are you that the river is clear of unfriendlies? No more grumpy gorillas?” she asked, letting him help her to her feet. Her leg was doing much better by now, but she liked when Cap acted the gentleman.
When you were Iron Woman, number one target for terrorists, super villains and all sorts of baddies, you learned to bounce back from potentially traumatic incidents pretty quickly. She reclined against one of the pillars and observed Cap with a smile, putting the murderous ape incident behind her.
she thought wryly. Had she stuck it out even 24 hours before getting him to paint her belly with come?
that he could not tear his eyes away from her exposed body caused his cock to harden to full attention, even as he blushed and averted his gaze.
“You are a fucking work of art baby. Unbelievably hot, running around with just that little loin cloth and built like a Greek god. You know how much I want to lay you out and show you everything you’ve been missing all this time alone in the jungle? I think we’d have a lot of fun testing your stamina.” She whispered hotly to him, basking in the adoration in his eyes as he hung on her every word.
Even as she joked, there was a giddy young girl inside her squealing that the cutest, sweetest guy she had ever met wanted to marry her. Never mind that countless articles, blogs or even personal interviews that had deemed her ‘not the marrying type’.
She drank from a small container she pulled from her shell then tipped her head back to expose her long neck, pressing the water container against her throat to cool herself.
Toni always had a hard time expressing emotions and being sincere with her words, so she struggled now with what to say.
Toni took a deep breath, some of the weight of the day lifting from her shoulders. She had protection, water, food. With the newfound sense of safety, she suddenly felt starving, and so tired.
He was sitting with Sister as she groomed her new son, a fluffy little bundle only weeks old, when he heard the sound like gun fire and subsequent crash.
“I know you want to take care of me. And you know that I want to take care of you too. And that is not limited to the battlefield. I can’t have you risking your wellbeing now to help me later. I can’t bear it.” He said to her softly.
He woke up before Toni the next morning, as he always did. He slipped away to collect some fresh water and something to eat before slipping quietly back to her side. He examined her fondly, the little puffs of breath as she slept were so adorable to him.
Eventually they reached their destination. He had not been here for years, but the location was always keenly at the forefront of his mind.
She brushed his hands away where they lingered close to her skin, and he snatched them back. Maybe he had overstepped?
“You love me?” she echoed in a soft voice. She hated how vulnerable she sounded, but she knew that Cap would never judge her for that.
Then he let go of her legs, wrapped an arm tight around her back and took a running leap in to the trees.
“Use your fingers first, stretch me so you can slide right in.” she instructed, arching her back slightly.
Pain thundered through his body like a terrible electric shock. He turned his head with great effort to look at Toni. She looked anguished, both in pain and distraught at seeing him there with her.
Cap frowned slightly at her suggestion. He seemed to contemplate her words, like he understood them, but a second later he shook his head like he was clearing it.
As the newly wedded couple gestured for people to join them on the dance floor, Steve jumped immediately at the opportunity to hold out his hand to Toni, receiving a laughing smile in return.
But with her – with humans and machines – came his past. He felt the scrambled mess of memories now, still not straight or clear but pouring back into him nonetheless.
His face immediately broke in to a bright, sincere smile, as though she had awarded him a prize far greater than bearing her weight on a walk through their humid surrounds.
Steve closed his eyes, giving his last thoughts to Bucky and the Commandos, his brothers. To the bright, sharp minds of Agent Carter, Colonel Phillips, Howard Stark and the other brilliant officers that would continue to fight HYDRA once he was gone.
“Run it down for us J.” she instructed, squeezing Cap’s shoulders lightly to let him know she was there with him while they heard about his past.
It took four more thrusts forward and Toni’s nails digging into his hip for him to come, spilling on to Toni’s skin and crying out. She kept guiding him through it, letting him grip her more roughly than before and rub his still twitching cock through the mess he had made.
Toni processed this new information. Cap had not been as alone as she had imagined. The thought actually gave her some comfort, as bewildering as imagining living among a group of gorillas was.
She though idly about what she should do to him. He really liked it when she rode him, they could do that. Or maybe start a little slower… she hadn’t felt his tongue on her pussy for over 24 hours which was just unacceptable.
“It was a stealth mission, related to a secret HYDRA base where reports of experimentation on an unknown energy source were occurring. There was an extraction mission, where the operative was to acquire intelligence and related materials to deliver back to SHILED, but they never made it back to base. The quinjet was last pinged somewhere in the Gulf of Guinea.”
“Yes I have the package. Seriously, you aren’t interested in the quinjet I found, or the stranded SHIELD operative I’ve been bunking down with?” She asked with faux-innocence.
Cap was a blur of movement, his right hand immediately cupping her wet pussy and pumping his large middle finger inside her, joined quickly by another. He scissored gently while he angled his fingers, finding her G-spot in a well-practiced move. He did not stop there though. He ducked his head, licking and sucking on her nipples, adding
“Thanks Toni… I… Stevie, man… it’s so good to see you.” Just like that, they both moved forward to embrace each other, neither caring that a tear or two escaped.
“It was a pretty rude interruption back there. I thought we were getting to some good stuff.” She said, running her hands up her body, putting on a show for Cap. He crouched forward slightly, reminding her momentarily of a cat about to pounce. But she was far from afraid.
He felt anxiety clawing at his throat. He did not want to talk about it, he hated thinking about it… but she was so upset, ready to risk something that obviously scared her and if he said nothing, it would be a betrayal.
Cap buried his face in her neck, feeling overwhelmed by the sensation of being so intimately connected with Toni. She continued to hold him close.
He still felt phantom wisps of the gut-wrenching fear he had felt when he heard the snap and soft breathing of the leopard as it prowled towards Toni. He should have noticed it earlier, but he had been so distracted watching her that he had not been as vigilant as he should have been. He had descended on the clearing as fast as he could, but it was not fast enough to spare Toni any injury.
“You know what? There’s nothing else I can do here right now. Let’s go to the river and cool down. Then we can celebrate the strides we’ve made.” She said, leaning forward to steal a kiss before she jumped up, energised. She extended a hand to help him stand up. He certainly did not need it, but happily grasped her hand nonetheless.
He watched her now, the way she manipulated the hard metal with her hands, pulling it apart and twisting the tiny wires together so deftly. He had realised yesterday that this red suit was her creation. She knew every part of it, all the intricate pieces underneath the hard exterior. The other white shell was not hers, but still she disassembled it efficiently, seemingly able to determine what parts should be cast aside and what parts could be used with a glance.
“I can’t believe I’ve gone so long without dancing with you. I intend to remedy that in the future Ms Stark.” He said fondly.
She continued to guide him in this intimate lesson, dragging her fingertips with an unnecessarily teasing touch over various parts of his body and naming them.
“Toni.” Cap growled, making her meet his gaze. Once again, those big blue eyes were on her with a laser-focus. He seemed to be asking her something, something he couldn’t get out in words.
He hesitantly rubbed himself over the material, eyes pinned on Toni’s face. She tried to remain encouraging but impassive, if there were such an expression.
“Thank you. I promise, I’ll make sure you have everything you need to get your life back. Or start a new one, whatever you want.” She promised, unable to bring herself to declare her love just yet, but more than willing to spend her considerable money and valuable time getting Cap the life he wanted and everything he deserved.
Toni could not help but stare at the image he painted. He was large, perfectly proportionate to the rest of his powerful body. Also consistent was how flawless his hard cock was. The shape, length, girth, the head now visible though he was uncut… Toni almost wanted to laugh at how his handsomeness translated to every part of him, but she was too enthralled in how he was touching himself.
He was frowning deeply, his breath coming a bit quicker. Being in here made him feel claustrophobic, the weight of memories making it hard to breathe. Pain, fear, a crippling sense of being entirely
He studied her face, a frown tugging on her brow and full lips turned down as she muttered something.
He had to be persistent – “you’re worse than Pepper and Rhodey!” she had complained. But eventually she packed up her tools and allowed him to carry her – on the ground, she insisted – to the river.
“Would you like that? Do you want to put this in me? Fill me up?” she asked hotly, once again stroking him from root to tip.
His head had been partially stuck in that moment all day, reliving the pleasure of being in her arms over and over even while he luxuriated in her presence now. Still he kept a portion of his senses tuned to their surrounds, feeling more protective of this woman than ever before.
“So, CAP. Do you know any home remedies for a jungle cat gash?” she asked, pointing to her leg and hoping he got it.
Unfortunately, Steve did not feel the same way. After years of sleeping on the hard ground, he was disoriented by the bedding. Last night he had slept on the floor beside her bed. She would have to engineer some sort of super-firm mattress, or maybe even a topper so they could still share the same bed…
He finished his path at her ankles but was reluctant to withdraw entirely. She raised her hand to brush a lock of blonde hair over his ear, pausing there. He slowly raised his hand to do the same, tenderly brushing her short hair back.
She wasted no time in reclaiming his lips, running her hands and nails over him slightly more roughly than she usually did. She felt desperate for him, aroused and gagging to get him inside her. She shivered at the thought of how he would react. Toni would not say that sleeping with virgins was a particular kink of hers, but the idea of being Cap’s first, even just his jungle-life-first, was too heady to pass up.
“And just so you know, I have no intention of stopping looking out for you.” He continued with a hint of cheek.
He drew a rough shape in the soil that she guessed was supposed to be her amour, then a line heading east to an ‘X’. Another sign of societal impact in his drawing. He moved two twigs back and forth between the two places.
He pushed through a panel of metal that was partially ripped away from the side of the room and jumped down to the ground beneath him, his leg protesting strongly.
And Steve was still a hundred feet away, watching helplessly as this mad Titan was about to commit genocide.
He just smiled down at her, carrying her out of the clearing. She cast one last glance at her armour laying prone on the ground. She hated to leave it behind, but she felt deep down that she was in the safest possible place right now, in Cap’s arms.
Cap limped along for an hour before he found water, resting to drink and clean his wounds. They already seemed better than before, they were definitely bleeding less.
His heart fluttered as she looked at him now, her face shiny with sweat, a black mark sweeping her forehead and a bright grin stretching across her face.
By the time sunset was approaching, Toni was covered in a thin sheen of sweat, looking red and drained. She had resisted his urging to take breaks, stopping only long enough to eat and drink.
He was also ever vigilant, tensing at every twig snapping. Nothing bigger than a monkey came anywhere close to them the entire day. Still he stuck close to her, as though being almost pressed against her would allow him to act quick enough in the case of danger. He worried at first that she would find it annoying, would push him away, but she did not. It made him smile and press ever closer.
She was suddenly very grateful to have Steve’s hand in hers – feeling tethered to something was comforting when the Earth no longer had a pull on you.
“You can if you want? Lick them.” She whispered, running her thumb over his bottom lip to indicate what she meant.
“Cap, this is your home and far be it from me to tell anyone how to live. But maybe while you have a guest, you can keep your pet anaconda in its enclosure?” she said dryly, glancing down so he would know she was talking about the ideal-of-manhood he had resting on his thigh.
“Miss, I searched all of SHIELD’s records and found only one instance that could possibly match the quinjet you found.” He said.
He found beauty in a lot of things in the jungle, but this was different. His heart beat faster and he couldn’t tear his eyes away from this lovely creature. He shifted to rest against a branch high in the canopy and watched as she walked back and forth between the two – were they shells? Her voice continued to keep up a running commentary that he could not fully understand but was not for him anyway. He relaxed into the sound of her voice – lighter than his, but still a captivating timbre that he felt he could listen to for hours.
It was in a relatively sombre mood that they washed. Toni wondered if a part of her would miss this. Probably not, not once she stood beneath the six shower heads at her penthouse.
She lay there for several moments feeling winded before she activated the emergency release and rolled out of the inactive suit.
“Not unless you have a secret lab somewhere full of circuit boards and a power source.” She said, indicating the pile of metal ‘garbage’ she had called it before.
He watched her smile at her closest friends. He was in awe of this wonderful, generous, brave woman. There was a huge part of him that still could not believe that she gave him the time of day, let alone let him spend his life by her side and in her bed.
She pressed him back slightly, giving her just enough room to lay on her back, slipping off her panties from the cage of his arms placed around her.
Once he reached the large tree with their nest, he gently slung Toni over his back and made sure she was holding on tight before he began to climb. She was warm against his skin, except for her wrist which was still decorated in the red metal that matched her suit.
She had left the case and all the parts behind, where they would return tomorrow with the suit components she needs to get comms up and running.
Slowly he moved his hands to her arms, tracing his fingertips around her bicep and trailing them slowly down. He intently mapped out her body with his hands, tracing almost the exact same path she had used in examining him.
Then with a quick glance to her face, he tugged himself out of the material that covered his erection and began to stroke himself roughly. He helplessly buried his head in her lap again, inhaling hungrily and growling low in his chest.
“I swear to God, if you swing me through the trees again, I will not be held accountable for the mess I make of us both.” But she climbed on to him nonetheless. His skin was warm where it pressed against her arms and chest, and she wondered if he had whipped himself up some organic, rainforest Old Spice, because a man that lived like this had no business smelling as good as he did.
After a couple of minutes he slowed, standing on a wide branch and wrapping a comforting arm around her back. His sharp eyes surveyed the jungle beneath them, ensuring the gorilla did not give chase.
He flattened his tongue against her before sucking gently, making Toni moan encouragingly and clench her fingers in his hair. He excitedly moved to her other nipple, tweaking the wet one he left behind, causing her to jolt slightly.
“Kiss.” She said. She removed her hand, leaning forward to softly press her lips to his in a chaste kiss. “Kiss.” She repeated, leaning back.
“Well shit, I guess that could been worse- HEY! Don’t come any closer.” Toni had looked up to find the man four paces closer than he had been. She had not even heard him move.
Holding her like this actually helped settle his nerves as he set out. The place was several miles away, so he climbed into the canopy.
Her words were sending Cap into a state, the hand pumping in to her pressing in harder until he withdrew entirely, small sounds emitting from his throat. He sat back on his knees, shuffling up so his perfect member pressed against her wet lips, her legs spread wide.
She immediately dismissed the option of running for it. She was no slouch on the track (Happy would not let her be), but there was no way she was making it more than a few paces before this beast was on her.
He shot white streams over her hand and his own stomach, pumping his hips into her grip where she held him through his orgasm. He grunted through it, grabbing her and hauling her almost on top of him to capture her lips. The kiss was rather messy but perfect.
The only sound left in the clearing was the heavy breathing of both Toni and the mysterious man. He let the lifeless body of the savage animal fall to the ground, now focussing his attention on her.
