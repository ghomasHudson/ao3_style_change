The Avengers all had their tactics; Clint was always obnoxiously throwing things at Tony from a distance, Natasha crept in and stared him down until he backed out of the room like the giant coward he was, Bruce always ended up distracting him with other science-y things that were not anywhere near his workshop, J.A.R.V.I.S. alerted Tony anytime Thor was coming close, especially when he was carrying his hammer.
She laughed and shook her head, giving him a hug. “I’m glad you’re alive and well. Take care of yourself. Wait.” She addressed Steve. “Make sure he takes care of himself. He’s shit at it.”
Tony whipped around, brown eyes wide as they registered a teary eyed redhead, clutching the arm of a dark-skinned man, who wasn’t as teary-eyed but had an air about him that said he was only barely holding it back.
It was late and Steve was getting ready to sleep. Since Loki’s surprise visit (again), Tony had not come to find any of them, so that meant he was most likely brooding in his workshop, pretending he had too much work to do in order to avoid having to talk about what happened. He had found the robot dog abandoned and brought it back to his room with him, still smiling at it.
He wondered about Steve then. He knew Steve could play considering he was part of a band. He knew Steve could draw because he’d seen his art. He knew Steve worked hard to help pay for school and he budgeted his time, created his own personal schedule like a normal person should. Tony had never had to do that. He was fairly certain he wouldn’t have the slightest idea of what to do if a time ever arose where he didn’t have someone like Pepper to micromanage his entire life. So while Tony was a well-known piano prodigy and also a genius, he couldn’t help but feel like he came up short when he compared himself to others. Steve was brilliant, funny, he took care of himself. So did all his bandmates. They made it through life just fine without having to wonder where they were scheduled to go next and how far away it would be this time. Today he was in Germany. Tomorrow he’d be stateside again. He’d only arrived yesterday. None of this would have happened if he’d been left to his own devices. He simply wasn’t capable of budgeting his time on his own. He was frivolous. He was impulsive. He made other people wait for him and he didn’t care what he spent his money on. If there was something he wanted he reached out and got it.
“It’s just that...you don’t really seem all that interested in doing things with the team outside of our battles.”
“C’mon,” Tony said giving Steve’s bottom lip a quick nip, Steve just groaned and let his head fall to the crook of Tony’s neck before giving in to the pleasure and coming hard.
Tony snorted. “Please. I can totally skip graduation for sex all day. That’d be the best present ever.”
Tony’s play at being offended was belied by the fact that he couldn’t keep a grin off his face. “That really hurts, Sourpatch.” He leaned towards Pepper and clutched at her arm. “Potts, tell Rhodey that was rude.”
“You’re a wreck,” Tony mutters against Steve’s lips. “You’re doing so good though. I bet you’re ready to come, aren’t you?”
Tony took a step closer. And then another. He stopped when he was close enough to get a good look at the man who was still floating in midair. If he had inhaled some sort of hallucinatory drug this was the best hallucination he’s ever had. His mind usually didn’t come up with hot, scantily clad male genies.
Tony just shrugged at him and smiled. “It looks good. I mean, I’m still trying to work out how much of that is my genius and how much is your body, but—A+ all around. For now at least. The others still have to try theirs on but I’m liking my odds so far I—“
He would always be that little kid from Brooklyn who couldn’t walk away from a fight. Too bad he didn’t have that same kind of bravery when dealing with the opposite sex.
Steve frowned. This was the first he was hearing about Tony being in pain, though, really, maybe Steve should have assumed. It hadn’t even been two weeks since the genius had shown up bleeding on his doorstep and yet here he was, being forced by Steve to work through it. Steve felt like a jackass. “I’m--I’m going to need you to show me inside him.” Steve grimaced at himself, that hadn’t been what he was trying to say. He tried to backtrack. “It’s not that I don’t trust you, it’s just that--”
Tony was sitting in the kitchen, sipping at some coffee at 11:30 at night because why not? It wasn’t long before the very person that took up the majority of space in Tony’s mind took a seat next to him at the table. Steve’s hand immediately went to the back of Tony’s neck and began massaging it gently.
Steve smiled. He knew he wouldn’t use it. He always maintained radio silence on missions like these, and it had been months since the last sighting. Enough time for him to slowly ease back into a life he was becoming comfortable with. He couldn’t though. Bucky was out there and Steve needed to see him. He needed to talk to him, to get him to remember. He wanted his best friend back and he vowed to go through hell or high water to bring him back one day.
Fifteen minutes later, Steve was somewhat amused to find himself being ordered to make pancakes with chocolate chips by Tony who now claimed he was starving.
Steve chuckled quietly before his mouth was on Tony, barely sucking on the head before he began making his way down, taking him in and covering his shaft completely. Tony almost came right then, the pleasure too much but he managed to close his eyes and force back his orgasm. Just a little longer. He wanted this to last as long as possible.
“This is embarrassing and if you keep it up you’re going to humiliate this entire family. We’re talking about this later.”
When he returned to the tower, the others were having a monumental discussion over what had happened. Tony didn’t want to be petty, but he was sulking a little because he missed out and he wasn’t in the mood to listen. He could be like that. It was allowed. He had the money to prove it. Instead he gave them a smile as he tossed his jacket onto a nearby chair and loosened his tie while waiting for the elevator to take him to his workshop.
“Maybe if you shut your trap for five seconds you’d have heard me say that I can only grant wishes to my master. You’re my master.”
Steve grinned stupidly at where Tony had been before reaching a  hand down and tapping the bot on his head. “I’m gonna get you one in hot rod red, how about it?”
Obies eyes were wide, his mouth held open, speechless. “Tony!” he finally settled on, backing away from Pepper. “You’re alive.”
Steve grabbed Skulls fingers at his throat and yanked them back until he heard an audible crack and the grip on his throat loosened enough for Steve to barrel into his arm and break the grip. He used the momentum from his spin to turn and kick Schmidt in the head, sending him crashing to the ground.
Peter had gotten into another conversation with Steve while Tony was on the phone and it was harder pulling him away this time. “Earth to Peter.”
The boys rolled their eyes but backed off anyway, one of them pointing at the genius as he walked away. “Your time is coming, Stark. You can’t hide behind daddy forever.”
Tony pursed his lips in thought. “What about that right there? Shouldn’t that be Y subscript theta over A? Not B?”
He wanted it to feel good, knowing that he’d essentially won, but all it did was made him feel sick, an unpleasant bubbling in his stomach and a lump lodged in his throat. Half of him wanted to gloat while the other half roared to be down on the ground helping to stop the bleeding somehow.
Tony looked at Steve. “You know. That talk you get from people when you start dating someone. ‘Hurt him and I’ll hurt you’ type thing.”
Steve gave a ridiculous laugh. “I just wanted to bring back my best friend. It’s my fault this happened in the first place…”
One day Tony stopped texting. That wasn’t the part that wasn’t normal though. Tony would go for a week or two without texting sometimes, but he hadn’t heard from Tony in over a month. He had tried texting a few times himself to make sure the man was okay but never heard anything in return. Maybe Tony had gotten bored of their game and finally decided to stop. Which was fine. Definitely. Totally fine. It’s not like he didn’t have school projects and finals to start focusing on eventually anyway.
“I’d make sure they had the security they need and offer them a different place in the company. Or help them find work somewhere else. I don’t know. I wouldn’t leave them stranded like that.”
Steve was blushing. Again. Good grief. “You’re welcome.” He ducked his head and then placed his sketchbook back in the safety of his school bag. He heard Tony stand up to collect his own things before leaving and looked up just as the brunet was walking towards him, holding out a slip of paper.
“You probably won’t find me under the tree, but just know that I’ll be wearing a big red bow for you.” He sidestepped so he could pass Steve and spoke softer this time. “And only a bow.”
“Mmm...yeah.” He pulled back and looked down at Tony. “Thanks. I mean I’m sure I’ll have have some sort of guilt-ridden meltdown again tonight and probably for a long time, but still, thanks for not mocking me.”
Tony laughed at that. “Once I had the right tools, getting out was easy peasy. Yeah, I built a weapon, one for myself. I was able to hold them off long enough by telling them I needed more parts and more time. Of course, my plans changed just slightly when Schmidt stormed in and told me in no uncertain terms that I had until morning to produce something meaningful on threat of death. I stayed up the rest of the night working on that stupid weapon and then used it to blow a large chunk out of their facility. Then I ran and here I am.”
“I just told you that it was going to sound crazy.” He snapped his fingers in Steve’s direction and Steve’s head popped up, one noodle dangling from his lips. When he noticed he was being stared at he sucked the noodle in and Tony’s eyes went comically wide.
Tony paced back and forth, much to the growing annoyance of both Steve and Bruce. It was one of a small handful of nervous ticks that Tony apparently had, come out to play as they waited for their first update from Romanoff and Barton’s work undercover in Stark Industries.
Tony had told Steve everything he’d learned. He’d watched Steve’s face shift from horrified to sad to confused and all other emotions in between. And after all of that Steve still didn’t know. He couldn’t remember. He’d allowed Steve the privacy of going to another part of the building to read the files they had, to see the pictures. Hopefully it’d help him understand why he was at odds with things he knew and didn’t know. He’d been gone for a couple of hours at this point.
Steve tilted his head thoughtfully, looking from Peter to Tony and then shrugged. “Well, if Peter thinks it’s a good idea, then maybe we should.”
Steve sighed and kept reading; it was just his luck that’d he’d set aside work for more work, though it was satisfying to know that he and his people were still ahead of the media which, okay, wasn't too hard when one of the largest New York newspapers, the Daily Bugle, was run by J. Jonah Jameson, notorious for publishing articles that tended to focus more on pop culture figures than really hard hitting journalism.
Steve let his eyes trail to the servers, still working, still infected. He raised his gun at Schmidt, just as the other man came charging at him, gun thrown aside and a hand around Steve’s throat before he could pull the trigger. Schmidt growled in his face. “I will savor this moment.”
The genius continued to place warm kisses along the column of Steve’s throat, his reply quiet. “Bet your sexy ass we are. So. Much. Talking.”
Tony shook his head and reached out to finger the shirts material at Steve’s shoulder. “This, I don’t mind. Protecting people is the part of my job I’d always liked. I just realized the weapons I made weren’t doing so much protecting as they were needlessly killing.” Tony pulled his hand away slowly and started making his way around Steve’s office, hand trailing over anything within his reach.
What was the point of saying something when it could just as easily be expressed or proven through an action? This is how wars were won. This is how his dad did it. Telling someone to fear you was not as effective as giving them a reason to fear you. The Howard Stark philosophy.
“Then come,” Tony orders and Steve does. He makes noises meant only for Tony’s ears as he tenses up during his release, arms wrapped tightly around the genius. Tony pets his hair and lets him ride it out, relishing in the feel of Steve’s cock rubbing against his leg, even as Steve is begging him to turn off the vibrator.
“Hey, you’re the one who wanted to lighten the place up a bit, what’s lighter than a little good humored pranking?”
Steve ignored Tony and started making his way to his room where he kept his gear. Ignored Tony even when the other man trailed relentlessly behind him. When he was all suited up and had his gear strapped to him he gave Tony one last acknowledgement. “You’re still injured, Stark. You’re not going.”
Tony was grinning. He looked excited for the first time since Steve had met him and he was proud to know he’d managed to put that look on Tony’s face in the first place. He held out his hand for the sketchbook and waited for Tony to hand it to him.
Steve’s words were cut off by a loud groaning sound of metal twisting and glass shattering all around them. He pushed himself faster and yanked Tony forward, far enough away that the building imploding only covered them in a fine layer of ash.
Tony gripped both Pepper’s shoulders. “I’ve got this. You’re brilliant, Miss Potts, truly magnificent, and one of the only people I would trust with a job like this. I need you to do this for me.”
“Steve, I mean maybe not now. Maybe things would be good, but you’d eventually get tired of me and move on and we’d have a horrible ending and we wouldn’t even be friends anymore because of some huge mistake I will inevitably make that will ruin everything between us and I don’t want to lose you.”
Bucky was all charm and charisma and could hold the attention of the entire room with not much more than a smile if he wanted to. Girls had always been Bucky’s forte. Steve came along for the ride, and he’d managed to ruin the nights of quite a few females who were expecting Steve to be like Bucky. Well the Steve from before. The Steve who was about five and a half feet tall and maybe 95 pounds. Where they found his awkwardness offputting and undesirable before, it was now quirky and adorable and Steve did not appreciate either of those distinctions.
Steve Rogers had never been particularly keen on double dates. There was a lack of intimacy involved when two other people were essentially sharing those moments that Steve felt should be private. Then again, Steve Rogers didn’t date much anyway and had no basis for comparison other than what he’d dreamt up in his mind.
“It was nice, Steve. I’m not mad about any of that…it just…I guess it just hit me how much they’re willing to lay on the line for me is all.”
With that he turned, tossing the bottle over his shoulder as he did and walked away. Normally he’d probably be turned on by something like that but he was in his own version of hell at the moment.
“Hey! I heard that!” was the last thing Tony said before the elevator doors shut and took them down to ground level.
“I’ve also been instructed to remind you that if you do not speak to the captain at your earliest possible convenience then, and I quote, ‘there will be hell to pay, Tony.’”
The one thing he knew was that he wanted to keep the tone light. Uplifting. Nothing serious. Well not yet. He’d only just met the guy one and a half times, and the half was when they interacted for precisely five seconds before Tony had to run off. And he could not help thinking about how ridiculous it was that he’d decided so quickly this was something he wanted. If there was one thing he was sure of it was that love at first sight was not real and should be more aptly called lust at first sight. People cannot just love someone by looking at them when there hasn’t been any time to learn to trust or get a larger feel for their personality. And wow, Tony should not be thinking like that. Love was a bad bad word. Falling for someone was a thing that happened in horribly cliched romantic comedies and dramas, but the odds of it happening to anyone in real life are highly unrealistic.
Steve glared, already moving toward the door. “It’s not the time, Barton,” he snapped. “Move it or be prepared to do drills from now until kingdom come.”
The blond just stared at the ceiling and frowned. Maybe he forgot to hit send on his text but he distinctly remembered a marriage proposal. Once he found the courage to move, he reached for his phone, and since it was connected to a charger, he could only assume Bucky had thoughtfully done that for him as well.
Steve gave Tony just long enough to finish the last bit of instrumental ending before he walked briskly toward the bench. He took hold of Tony’s arm and pulled him up, his smile brighter than it had been in awhile and he knew he was blushing but he didn’t care. Instead he cupped the side of Tony’s face with one hand while the other made its way to the back of his head and he pulled the brunet into chaste but intense kiss. Tony’s arms eventually folded around his neck and Steve broke the kiss and rested his own forehead against Tony’s.
“Good luck, Captain.” JARVIS said just as Steve pushed open the door with maybe just a bit too much strength as it went sailing open, slamming against the wall with a BANG.
“Yeah.” Silence. “But we’ll be close to each other. We can see each other almost any time we want really. And I sort of might want to find a roommate because I don’t like being alone.” He was giving Steve a hopeful look.
“No need. You didn’t tell me you were alive. I’ve been worried sick about you and I had to find out from Pepper that you were still with us.”
When Tony was finished with his much needed shower and beard trimming, he put on a pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt before making his way out of his bedroom. Reaching the common area, he found Steve staring silently out the windows, hands pressed against the glass like a child who was seeing such a view for the first time. It stood to reason that this probably was his first time seeing something like this. After a moment he cleared his throat and the genie turned around. If he was startled at all he didn’t show it. Tony noted the same look on Steve’s face that he’d briefly witnessed on the island and wondered what was going through the blond’s head.
Natasha offered a small wave. Tony gave her a look. “Do not make any bets with my child tonight, Natasha. Do you understand?”
“I have more than enough proof to put you away for a long time. Emails, transactions, payments, photographs, video feeds—you name it, I’ve got it.”
Steve shook his head. He started after around the corner Pepper and Obie had disappeared behind, made it about ten steps before footsteps came thudding after him.
“Men like Obie—their hearts are black as their hands are red. They think the value of their person is determined by the amount of money in their banks and are incapable of forming connections with anyone or anything. He wasn’t just incapable of loving you, Stark. He’s incapable of loving anything that wasn’t power.”
His last words, drowning between choking and gasping for air, were a fierce declaration of. “Hail Hydra.”
“I can already tell that the talk he’s going to have with me later is going to be a joyous occasion.”
“You’re so concerned about sticking it to your father! My father used to beat the shit out of me and my mom! I’m glad I was able to get away from him but I’ve been having to struggle to pay the bills and make my way through life! This little fling thing is something that I love. It’s something that makes me feel like I belong! You seem to just look down at it and consider it silly and it’s what I do. It’s what I enjoy. It takes my mind off the shit that I don’t want to think about all the time!”
Steve spent three days scrambling for answers about an organization he had no knowledge of and planning an escape he was only 12% sure would work. Three days before the sound of bullets hitting metal and flesh shook him from his meditative daze. Three days and the first sight Steve had seen other than men with bad breath and even worst attitudes was a woman standing tall, a gun at her side, victory curls in her hair, and a very British accent.
“What the hell was that?” Obie grunted. “It’s not like you to have someone else do your work for you.”
“Pizza will be here in 20.” Natasha took a seat next to Bucky again and gave Steve an appraising look. “Just so you know, Tony can’t stop talking about you.”
“Oh come on, Steve. Stop being a baby. Put on your big boy pants and take on the situation head first.”
Steve tilted his head and studied Tony’s face. He was handsome, that was a given. He also looked familiar.
Bucky thrust Steve’s leather bomber jacket into his hands. “Wear this and go. Get out of here. Fix this so I don’t have to watch you be like this anymore.”
Steve laughed and kissed Tony again. He told Tony he was ready to take him out on a date. He was ready to try moving on. He’d visited Peggy on his trip. It hurt to reach that point and it stung to see that she got to live her life, but he was more overjoyed than anything because she was happy. That was all that really mattered to him.
Tony kicked the box hard across the floor. “What the hell do you want me to say, Rogers? Hey, this has been a not so bad experience even though once again I’m getting close to people who only want me for what I can give them. I’m not looking to make the same stupid mistakes over and over again!”
“I’m letting the fact you apparently have an AI as one of the only lines of defense for my men going into what I’m deeming hostile territory go and I’m trusting that you won’t fuck that up for us. No more people are going to be involved. None. We’re supposed to stay under the radar. You’re not accustomed to this, but I need you to understand. This is for your protection. This is for the protection of everyone on my team. You know what the people out there are capable of and I’m not putting my team, you, or even the people you care about at risk because you can’t handle not having your friends in your corner. Is that what you want? For them to get hurt, because they will if you involve them in this.”
Steve would have to pay them a visit pretty soon, a fact that he jotted down into his agenda, all thoughts of Tony pushed to the back of his head as he focused instead on whether or not he’d given his man Lorenzo one too many chances to prove himself working down on the docks. Either way it went, after Steve’s visit, Lorenzo wouldn’t be making anymore mistakes in the future, that was for sure.
Tony groaned as he trailed behind Steve to the front door, radiating a level of curiosity that must have been killing him. Steve made a point of unlocking the door as slow as possible, if only because he sort of liked the way Tony bounced eagerly on his feet while Steve made him wait.
Rhodey and Pepper shared a heavy look before they both turned to meet Steve’s gaze, the beginnings of approval shining through their mistrust.
“I…” he swallowed and looked down. “I sort of thought you were going to hate me and not forgive me and did I mention hate me but then I realized that I wasn’t being fair to you because wow this happened to you and I’m not being a real adult about this and stop me now and say something.”
Tony gave Steve a small grin. “Yeah. Same here.” He looked away and noticed everyone’s expectant gazes on his again. Was he really going to have to do this?
Tony grinned wide. “About three nights ago? To be fair, he’s been in my head for awhile, but then I figured I’d take a break from your list of demands and ahh ahh, Steve. Before you say anything, I’ve been working on your stuff during most of my waking and a few of my resting hours so don’t get on my case about distractions via toys. He’s a learning bot, not as advanced as DUM-E or U, but still very intelligent…..I’m surprised you didn’t notice I was gone though, usually you’re around hovering in some corner.”
And okay yeah. Maybe he’d been so wrapped up in his own pain that he’d sort of selfishly enough worried more about whether or not Steve would forgive him rather than realizing that Steve probably needed him right now.
Steve had his arms crossed over his chest as he leaned against the wall, watching Tony and Bruce while Bruce checked up on him.
“No. It’s not your fault. It’s not.” He pulled Tony toward him, wanting to hug the man, but he was met with resistance and Steve wasn’t going to force it.
Tony’s eyes were wide, frantic yet unmoving. This was his fault. He never should have wished for Steve to be there. He’d been stupid. Steve hadn’t been himself since he’d heard the news from Tony and he hadn’t been the same when he came back into the workshop. Now he was going to get Steve wounded, maybe even killed, and it would be on his shoulders.
Steve ran a rough hand down his face, eyelids drooping as he tried to focus his attention on the writing on the page. He couldn’t let himself sleep just yet, didn’t have the luxury of that kind of time on his hands, not with everything he knew that required his full and immediate attention. Business deals that needed finalizing, corrupt politicians to work around and debts to collect on. Steve was always good at collecting what was owed to him.
The tip of Tony’s tongue was poking from the side of his mouth and he was concentrating hard, trying not to get too angry about the fact that he was not a cookie artist. Once he less-than-skillfully completed one, he held it up with a smile on his face. “This one is for Clint because he’s a dick.”
Bucky just chuckled before groaning and putting his hands over his face. “Steve, I love you. I really do, but you’re going to have to leave and fix this.”
“I’m coming back. Okay? It’s not a forever deal. With me leaving I mean. You have things you’re trying to sort out too. What happened the other day wasn’t good for either of us. I think we both have a lot of head clearing to do.”
“Goodbye, Peter. I’ll see you again next weekend. Goodbye, Tony. Good luck with the wedding stuff. Congratulations.”
Steve smiled. “Because I know you, Tony Stark. I know you don’t have very little self-worth and you’re the most reckless human being I’ve ever met. Did you stop to think that if impressing me was the only way to get me to like you that maybe I wouldn’t really be worth your time? Come on.”
Tony shook his head, kept his eyes firmly on Obie’s face. Tried to remember a smile that wasn’t twisted and cruel but loving and patient.
Steve peered at the holographic image in front of him as it slowly spun around so he could see it at all angles. He had a pinched look between his eyebrows and Tony was losing confidence.
Tony slumped down further and mumbled to himself. “Geez, I leave behind one interrogation for another.” Then louder, “It was a small energy blaster. Don’t worry about the specifics, they require far too much technological jargon for either of you to possibly understand fully.” Tony rubbed at his temple, pulling it away only to scowl at the blood coating his fingers, blood he promptly wiped onto his makeshift sling. “Would it be at all possible to get a Tylenol, or a glass of Scotch, preferably both? I’m pretty sure my arm is broken and I maybe might have or had a concussion at some point. Either way, my head is pounding.”
After numerous unsuccessful attempts to locate Bucky, Steve had become a bit moody. Clint said moody was an understatement. Clint had a concussion after the last time he sparred with Steve. So maybe Steve was dealing with some anger issues. It’s bound to happen. He’d lost everything he had in his life before the ice. The Howling Commandos. Howard. Peggy. Bucky. He’d had to start over, and it didn’t leave a good taste in his mouth. He spent a long time feeling sorry for himself, but after the whole battle against the Chitauri, he’d learned that he wasn’t the only one who was necessarily alone in the world, just not in the way he was.
Tony’s eyebrows shot up. “Steve?” He had no idea why he was still standing there instead of just storming off like he usually did. Of course no one else had Steve’s eyes and his stupid dopey grin that Tony saw when Steve wasn’t angry with him.
A few days later they were able to go back to the tower. Tony was busy trying to get J.A.R.V.I.S. up and running again and trying to dodge calls from S.H.I.E.L.D. They only had a thousand questions about Steve and then just as many about Stark Industries and the current project he was working on. How did they even find out about that?!
“If you say so, kid.” He ignored the glare Steve shot at him. “I don’t care for them either, so how about I’ll have your back if you have mine?”
Tony could do this. Right? He could try to help Steve and not make this all about him. He was Iron Man. He could do anything. He still loved Steve.
Schmidt spread his arms wide again and smiled. “Then, Captain, as they say, hit me with your best shot.” When Steve didn’t move, Schmidt chuckled. “As I thought, you refrain from making the first move, morals can only get you so far, Captain.”
Tony glared up at Steve, but with no actual malice behind I, and stuck out his tongue until Steve laughed.
Tony looked down at the ground and scrubbed at his eyes for a moment. “Yeah, me too.” When Tony looked back up, his face was clearer than Steve had ever seen it. “We need to talk.”
Tony arched an eyebrow. “Well the only other reason I can think of would be having a competent handyman around to fix problems, but as you can see, I have absolutely no luck as it is right now with everything and that’s including my traitor of a suit that not only powered down but won’t give me the tiniest spark of life unless I tap into my reactor right now in which case it will work and we can get out or it won’t work and both of us will somehow end up dying in a completely unromantic way because, let’s face it, when is death ever romantic, but I’d like to have enough power in my artificial heart to make it out of here because who wants to go down in history as the superhero who died in Russia in a shitty cabin in the middle of nowhere with only a fireplace and a few nasty blankets to keep him and his friend warm? Is that any way to--”
When he finished eating, he folded up his paper and stood to walk his plate to the sink where he could rinse it off, mind suddenly not on the elections that were just around the corner but instead on Bucky and his arm that had been giving his trouble as of late. He could tell every time they talked lately that it was causing him pain in the way that Bucky would twitch the fingers on his flesh hand towards the metal one as if he wanted to grip it to stave off whatever was hurting him. A state of the art prosthetic apparently came with a price, but Bucky still insisted that it was worth it just to have the full range, plus some, mobility that a normal prosthetic limb just couldn’t provide.
Jarvis simply nodded before returning to his work and Tony made his way toward a waiting Steve. They had not seen each other in a week. He’d been away for another performance, this time in South America. Three of his five performances had been in Brazil alone. He’d had little sleep throughout his trip and was currently on the brink of sleep deprived collapse, but Steve’s name woke him up faster than any cup of coffee ever could.
Natasha smiled evenly, stepping closer to the boy. "I think you might want to watch what you say. He might not be the runt you bullied just two years ago, but that doesn't mean I'm going to let you think it's okay to talk bad about him."
Nuts-N-Bolts kept nipping at Steve even as he backed up, tiny claws clacking together when he missed. “Steve is a jerk,” he chanted in his high little voice.
Bucky sat down on the bed and nudged Steve. “Sit up, old man,” he instructed and Steve snorted. “You need to learn to hold your liquor. Here.”
Tony looked just slightly smug. “Thought so. Imagine my complete surprise when they interrogated me about ‘The Captain’ and his ‘Howling Commandos.’ Or when they asked me how long exactly I’ve been doing dirty work for Steve Rogers, who, as it turns out is The Captain.” Tony took a deep breath and narrowed his eyes. “I think there are just a few things you guys might have left out those times you had me working on your soldier friend’s arm.”
Dextrous fingers danced their way down Tony’s chest, stomach, ghosting over his cock. Steve’s thumb pressed against Tony’s hole but made no effort to push in just yet. Tony thrust his hips up immediately. His hand searched out his favorite part of Steve (well, when they were having sex at least) and gave his shaft one long, slow pump and the blond’s head fell to Tony’s shoulder, breath stuttering slightly as he began squirming under Tony’s touch.
Bucky shook his head. “No Stark.” Steve shut his eyes for a moment and breathed deeply. “I took out a few on my way here. It doesn’t seem like they’ve opened up to testing again just yet. Cells are empty as far as I can tell. One looks like it could have been inhabited recently but there’s nobody there now.”
Steve paused, suddenly feeling like they weren’t on the same page after all. “…if what you’re saying about Stane is true, Tony, then he’s not the kind of man you can just send to prison. He’s got connections out there higher than the authority, higher than the law. He’s the kind of man you have to put down, a sure way to sever any and all connections he’s got.”
Natasha rolled her eyes and grabbed a knife. “You know, Stark, we really do appreciate how much time you spend making sure we’re all safer when we go out there and the way you are constantly trying to improve it all.”
Tony just sighed. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to kiss Steve. He really really did, but he was sometimes a ridiculous sap and wanted a kiss to mean something. Okay a kiss from Steve to mean something. He had it bad. Shut up.
Steve cut Tony off before he could work himself up to a truly impressive ramble. “Thank you, Stark.”
Steve tensed when he heard footsteps making their way toward him and readied his gun, the noise of the shot would blow his cover but it wasn’t to be helped. Any hand to hand this close to the others would be just as telling.
Tony lost. Steve smirked. The genius glared but stood up, grabbing the empty canteen from the backpack they had. Too bad they didn’t have enough foresight to pack…
“Understood”, Steve stood up. “I’ll give you three some privacy.” He directed his attention to Tony. “I’ll meet you at the door,” before turning and walking away.
Steve adored Peter. That made this much easier for Tony. It’s not that Tony hadn’t dated at all since he’d had Peter, but it was always difficult and most people were not interested in being a relationship where a child was already involved. Steve didn’t even seem to mind. Peter loved him. Peter talked about him nonstop. Tony could spend the rest of his life talking about how much he loved his son with Steve honestly.
Steve nudged Tony with his shoulder, a smile on his face. Tony grinned back, open and wide and sort of beautiful. Steve rolled his eyes toward the sky, how had this become his life.
“First of all, Captain, he is not an it, he is a he. Secondly, he’s standing right here and it’s rude to talk about someone like they aren’t even in the room when you and I both can clearly see him there, running into the wall--” Tony paused and frowned, though just for a moment. “That’s not supposed to happen, I’ll fix it. Thirdly, his name is Sergeant Major Nuts-N-Bolts.” Tony held up his hand in a stop motion when Steve opened his mouth to object and pointed at the bot where the name had in fact changed on his little screen. Tony grinned smugly and almost proud. “He’s already moved up in the ranks. You can’t say he hasn’t earned it, that sonuvabitch.”
Shoulders slumping a little, he tilted his head, still grinning. “I guess everyone else was right. And you know what? I’m glad they were.”
Tony just shot Steve a rather unimpressed look but he was actually pretty hungry so he vowed to make an attempt. Steve had kicked Bucky and Natasha out of the apartment for the night so he and Tony could have it to themselves. Tony was turning 18 and Steve wanted to make sure he gave Tony a memorable birthday. Bucky had told Steve that he better be screwing Tony into the mattress if he was going to have to leave the fortress for the night. Steve declined to comment on that.
Steve had managed to avoid everyone for about a week. Tony hadn’t attempted to bother him once, but he knew the genius was checking in on him through JARVIS since the AI appeared to be asking how he was doing a lot more frequently than normal. He was somewhat surprised JARVIS hadn’t tried to retaliate after the way he’d treated Tony and that seemed like something Tony would code into all of his machines.
“No problem.” He started putting his tools away and ran his good hand through his hair, which is when Steve noticed Tony had done all that with one hand, the other still held in a sling against his chest. Steve was just that much more impressed.
Tony stopped right in front of the blond but didn’t make a move to touch him. He wasn’t sure what to do in instances like this and Steve didn’t seem to know what he was supposed to do either. “It went well. I mean I visited three different countries in six days and I was tired, but I managed to stay awake through every performance so I count it as a victory.”
Steve was drawn back to the present, fists still pummeling the punching bag in front of him, when he heard a throat clear. He was breathing deeply and looked down at his hands. He hadn’t even bothered to tape them up and now they were torn and bleeding.
Waking up under the sun on a deserted island was actually not any fun at all. Granted, this was the second time he had now done that and this was the second time in a row he hated it. At least his head didn’t hurt as much this time. Small miracles.
For the past couple of weeks, Tony had been designing several new electronic devices, creating prototypes after staying up three days straight, moving fluidly from one project to the next. He couldn’t rest, wouldn’t rest, until he was satisfied with what he had created. There was the usual cell phone/tablet combination because it was pretty run of the mill except better than all the others because it was created by a Stark. He’d also designed a better engine for the quinjet, a pair of patent pending hover sneakers based on his repulsor technology but without the punch his gauntlets produce (for obvious reasons and there were also a lot of safety issues he still needed to work out, but whatever because it was still in the early stages) and maybe a type of fabric that either cooled or heated the body depending on what it needed, already knowing what temperatures fell under the parameters of safe and dangerous in any situation. The fact that it was the same shade of blue as Steve’s suit and possibly already created to fit the soldier perfectly meant nothing at all. Nope. Not a thing.
Tony gave a short nod. “Fair enough.” He sat up a bit straighter to stretch his back. “So tell me, Steve, what do you do besides the whole punk thing? Not that this isn’t a good look on you, but I’ve sort of got the wholesome American boy next door image in my head from the first time we met and I have to say that you rocked that look pretty well.”
Bucky’s head peered back in. “Check your phone, by the way. You appear to have multiple text messages.”
Pepper just snorted and wiped at her eyes. “’Don’t worry about me’, he says. We’ve been worried about you for weeks, Tony. And now here you are telling us about all the horrible things that have happened to you and how it isn’t over and you want us not to worry?” She sounded incredulous, shaking her head as if Tony was a problem she could never hope to solve but resigned herself to sticking with anyway.
“You okay, babe?” His smile was innocent (well as innocent as Tony was capable of) and he took a sip of his ginger ale while the blond blushed.
Steve resisted the urge to let his head fall heavily into his hands and instead settled on rolling his eyes, sure that he’d never met another human being that left him feeling exasperated more often than not. “Some other time, Stark,” he said shortly, shifting in his seat for the fifth time in under a minute.
Steve rolled his eyes and poked Tony with his elbow again, this time much lighter than the previous tap. Maybe he had recognized his own strength.
Peter frowned but nodded. He might have broken a few eggs, okay a whole carton of eggs, on the floor, but really God shouldn’t have made them so easily breakable.
“I know.” He turned Steve so he could see just the edge of the dancing crowd and pressed up against him from behind. “Look at them, Steve,” Tony started, turning the vibe back onto its lowest setting. “All those warm bodies, sliding against each other.” His hand cupped Steve’s ass, palm pressing against the base of the vibrating plug while his other hand wrapped around Steve’s waist before landing on his crotch.
Steve had no idea what to do with this. In his mind, he knew that Tony was only five years old and the idea of superheroes was probably cool to any kid that age, but he also knew that it had to mean something different too. Tony knew he was a genius, knew what he was capable of and had so much to be proud of this early in his life. Then again, he was a kid and probably had no idea how important his genius was, and definitely had no idea how it would end up saving his life in the future. Present. Whenever he remembered. Gosh, this was confusing.
The brunet nodded and the others made their way into the limo so Tony could get a little privacy with Steve.
“Okay, Pepper. Pepper. Take a deep breath. There are several things we need to discuss and I need you here.” He jerked his thumb in Steve’s direction. “This is Steve.”
Steve gestured for Tony to follow him, out the door, past the guards and to his car. They drove in what was mostly silence, peppered only by Tony’s period question of where they were going followed by Steve’s never wavering answer of ‘you’ll see’, though the other man did spend most of his time staring out the passenger side window in apparent reverence. Time passed quickly as familiar landmarks gave way to scenery Steve only saw a few times a year if that. Even Tony stopped asking where they where they were going about halfway to their location, instead resting in his seat and watching everything disappear in a blur as they drove pass.
After an ungodly amount of time spent working, Tony was greeted by a hand falling heavily on his shoulder that caused him to jump slightly, quickly turning to put a face to the hand. Steve. He should have known.
Steve eyed Tony briefly when he’d made himself comfortable, looking for any sign that Tony wasn’t absolutely sure about involving his friends in this past the point they already were. When he received nothing but a shrug, that seemed to say ‘this is out of my hands’, in return he turned his attention to Pepper and Rhodey.
Standing on the tips of his toes, he leaned into Steve and bit his earlobe as his hand slid down down down, his hand tugging at the zipper of Steve’s pants and pulling it down. Next came the button, which he undid with a pop before pushing the fabric away and reaching for the blond’s already hard cock.
“Good. Then we can get started,” Tony said with a small grin. He looked up and startled. “Oh, Rogers.” He furrowed his brow, looking around for anyone else who might have sneaked up on him.  “When did you get here?”
“So is the sweater a fashion statement or…” Tony tilted his head. Where Steve had found this monstrosity he had no idea, but the smiling face of Rudolph and his actual blinking shiny nose looked back at everyone else.
Steve looked down at his work spread out over the table and then back to the bot currently attempting to climb up Tony’s leg. “Sure. Let’s go.”
Steve opened his mouth to argue, before shutting it with a snap. Anything he said on the contrary would sound empty when the only reason they were helping Tony was because of what he promised them he could create. Steve felt guilt eating away at him but couldn’t afford to lose focus because of it. This was a job and Tony was the best one to help them get it done.
“Right, well there’s that. Just Red Skull. This was not one of my better plans, you know. Wish me luck.”
Tony was just shouting his opinions on tears in all of space and time when someone cleared their throat. Both men turned to look at the intruder.
Pepper laughed, squeezing gently where she still held Tony’s hand. “He’ll like that. He’s going to go overboard checking everyone for clearance from now on.”
This was how Steve and Tony had found themselves resting in front of a fireplace. He felt miserable and knew Tony probably felt worse. He continued to shiver. Despite that, Tony seemed relaxed as Steve held on to him.
That was when Steve walked in, donning the ugliest Christmas sweater Tony had ever seen in his life and wearing a smile that could light up a city. Tony liked it when Steve smiled. He liked it when Steve talked. And when he walked. And when he breathed. And when he laughed. And okay okay, he likes Steve. A lot. Big deal. Not the point.
Pepper fixed Tony with a look that promised pain if he was messing around with her. “Fine.” She turned her attention to Steve. “I wish Tony would stop talking so much.”
Tony shrugged. “Umm, it depends. Sometimes I am gone for just a few days. Sometimes they are here in the United States. Sometimes I’m stuck in another place for a whole week doing one show after another.”
Steve chuckled. He could hear the pout and he knew Tony was just as miserable as he was. He began rubbing his hand up and down Tony’s back to try and help the man a little. “Does this help at all, your highness?”
Tony was still pretty sure he was hallucinating anyway. He reached forward because he was going to tap the man’s shoulder to make sure he was corporeal, but he was drawn in by the allure of man boobs and he gave one a slight squeeze.
“I still should have known though!” the brunet shouted. He took in a shaky breath, breathing a little too fast now. “I should have been able to detect that my own boyfriend wasn’t…”he scratched his head and looked down. “Something should have clued me in. I mean he was a little grumpier lately but considering what was going on it wasn’t much of a shocker, but I should have known. How stupid can I be? I’m supposed to be a genius, Steve!”
Steve tried to futilely wipe the amused smile off his face. “That’s not how I operate. Buck swears it’s some sort of insane hero complex, which is ironic considering the life I lead, but that’s not it exactly. What I wanted and what I want are worlds apart now, there’s no use dwelling on the past when I wouldn’t change a thing that lead me here. Even the part where I somehow adopted a tiny annoying robot created by a tiny annoying genius stowaway.”
Steve just hummed and Bucky knew that was Steve-language for ‘please don’t make me eat right now.’ Bucky laughed and walked out.
The soldier’s shoulders slumped. “Sometimes I wish I could figure out what has been happening between us for the past few months. You flirt and flirt and then you’re distant and I’m so confused but if you could just…”
Tony smiled lovingly at Natasha while he continued trying to finish adjusting part of his faceplate. He figured if they were going to keep making him come up and do things he’d bring his work to the table. “You’re just jealous because you have hideous bow wrapping abilities.”
“And you’re okay with that?” Tony asked, a challenge in his voice as he made his way to stand in front of Steve again.
Steve gently pulled Tony’s hands into his own and guided him to sit back down. “I’m not trying to make you feel like one, but this is something we have to talk about. Maybe not right now, but you can’t let it go either.”
He was busy filling a mug with the blackest coffee he could get when he heard Steve walk into the kitchen with hellos for everyone. And if he sounded a little sad, a little lost, and if his eyes lingered a little too long on Tony who was very adamant about not looking at him, well he was going to pretend not to notice.
Tony was out of his hospital bed before they could put him in it. His paralysis was gone and the only reason he’d stayed as long as he had was because Pepper had pinned him with a glare that dared him to challenge her on this. As it was, he cared more about Steve than himself. The doctors didn’t have time to tell him he was perfectly fine before he was making his way to where Steve was.
Tony’s hand moved to rest on Steve’s pulse point and the blond felt his breath stutter just a little bit as his heart picked up speed. Steve scrambled to retrieve the reply he’d had on the tip of his tongue, but found nothing but a chasm of empty space where his vocabulary usually was. He was still scrambling for an answer when Tony glanced up at him from under his lashes, eyes questioning.
After a few moments of silence, Clint spoke up. “So, you going to cut this turkey or what, Tasha? I’m starving.”
He loved his teammates so much. He was so happy to have them in his life no matter how nosey they were, but they didn’t question him about his trip once and he relaxed for the first time in over a month. They were his family now.
So that’s how Clint ended up being forced into giving archery lessons to a child prodigy who watched him with fascination. Tony had called him Robin Hood and said he wanted to try. Tony was nothing if not eager to learn, and Clint had to reassure him that it was okay if he wasn’t good at it. Tony had looked as though he wanted to cry and Clint reminded him that he was not able to build his own circuit board.
Tony gave him a sardonic grin. “Is this a romantic getaway, Steve? I would have dressed nicer if I had known. What anniversary are we celebrating? I’ve always been bad with dates.”
“Just saying. You’ve got a good thing. He’s got a good thing with you. Don’t let your insecurities mess it up.”
Steve tilted his head. “I can’t really predict the future, Tony, but if we do end up in a relationship, I don’t have any plans of it ending anytime soon, if ever.”
Tony resorted to drawing smiley face dabs on his because everyone else was finished and it took him all that time just to draw a penis on a cookie. He at least put a barely decent looking star in the middle of Steve’s because Steve deserved the best Tony had to offer and apparently that was it. So when Steve handed Tony his cookie, the genius suddenly found himself a little embarrassed by his tacky creations. Steve had somehow managed to draw Tony’s helmet. Not only did he draw it, he drew it perfectly. There was even some shading in there.
Without a word to either of them, he took a seat opposite Tony and watched closely as Tony carried on with his work.
“I’m sure you can, but I don’t want to hear them. They don’t matter. I wasn’t exactly expecting you to feel the same way about me, but I’m going to take what I can get too. We both have plenty of faults, but you’re more than just those faults. I see just as many good things about you as you see bad about yourself.”
He swiveled his head to assess which would be less painful and frowned a bit when he saw another disappointed look on Steve’s face.
He didn’t wait for a response before sprinting for the door. He thought that if he could flag down a taxi he’d make it in time. He hoped he had enough money to get in. He had just gotten paid and he was sure it wouldn’t be cheap to go, but he’d sacrifice two paychecks if he could get Tony to speak to him again.
Steve rested his arm against his legs and leaned forward so he was closer to Tony’s eye level. “I’d love that. I bet you make amazing things.”
Bruce looked like he wanted to object to Steve’s demands, but before he could, Tony started speaking, explaining in great detail with almost manic excitement everything about the weapon that helped him with his escape. No, he didn’t make anything for them. No, he didn’t give them the real blueprints. Yes, he swears. Steve wanted to tune out about halfway through when their conversation delved off course into a conversation of their own about ways to potentially make the weapon more efficient in the future.
“And miss dinner? Bruce made us a whole meal. There’s also pie. Or cake. Some sort of celebratory dessert. Natasha’s here for a visit so since we have everyone here, team bonding. You love team bonding.”
“It just means...you’re good and you always do the right thing and you’re strong and...well I’m not really…” He was having trouble thinking and maybe he had a few holes in his argument but he felt like it was important for Steve to know that being with Tony would be a grave mistake. He’d let Steve down. Steve would leave. Isn’t that how Tony’s life worked? The morphine was really currently messing with his brain.
“Great. Be here at seven in the morning on Christmas Day. I’m sure Peter will wake me up at five. I won’t tell him you’re coming. It can be a surprise.”
He peeled off his shirt and pants, letting them land next to the foot of his bed. His shower was quick and then he was in bed, burying himself under his blankets. Maybe he’d wake up only to find this past month had been nothing but a bad dream. Maybe he was dreaming right now and he’d wake up to find his best friend was really here with him.
He decided it would be a good idea to text him and let him know. Natasha probably wouldn’t kill him. Then again, this wasn’t the first time he’d jokingly proposed to his best friend.
The rest watched him expectantly and he smiled. “I would, but I was just bombarded with new projects that I need to get started on.” He indicated the briefcase at his feet containing several new blueprints and contracts he was being forced to sign tonight even though tomorrow was Thanksgiving and no one would be around anyway.
“Aye Aye, Captain.” The bot chirped and Steve’s nose wrinkled. “I...love..you?” Nuts-N-Bolts said, words drawn out as if he were trying to understand the phrase before repeating them a lot surer than before, tiny hand clamped onto Steve’s pant leg. “I love you!”
Tony shot Pepper a look and shook his head before turning his attention to Steve again. “I...well it just didn’t...does it change anything?”
Steve and Tony had taken a couple of breaks to eat some more crackers and refill on their water supply. Thank the stars there was at least enough snow for them to melt. Tony wasn’t particularly excited to be drinking it, but it was better than becoming dehydrated. After they were finished though, they crawled back under their blankets and came together one more time. Steve held onto Tony as if he was the most precious thing in his world.
Tony nodded and moved even closer to Steve. “I think you’re cool. I have my very own Captain America costume and Jarvis lets me wear it whenever I want to. I told my dad that I wanted to be just like you and he told me that’d be impossible.”
When Tony entered the door he was greeted to the sight of Obadiah holding a gun to Pepper’s back with one hand while the other worked furiously away at the computer.
Tony shook his head but then switched to a nod. “Yeah. It’s not like it’s a huge secret. Well it kind of is but…” he lifted his shirt to show Steve what was there. “It used to be a lot bigger than this, but plastic surgery is miraculous.”
Bruce gave Tony a small grin. “I told you, Tony. He’s not safe to be around, and I’d hate myself if I accidentally hurt you.”
Finally though, they finished their meal. Cake included. And if Tony had to be honest he’d say this was one of the most amazing nights he’d ever had in his life. He helped Steve clear the dishes from the table and waited while Steve packed leftovers into the fridge. The dirty dishes needed to go into the dishwasher but that could wait and…
Tony glared down at the other man. “You wanted to mold me into someone like you then? Someone corrupt and power hungry?”
They were standing in front of the diner and Steve couldn’t remember, for the life of him, when they’d even begun walking. He was wondering if now would be a good time to chicken out and run away, but he’d never run away before so why start at this point? So, as Natasha suggested, he walked into the diner with his head held high and a smile on his face.
Tony kissed him once more before standing up, abandoning his drink as well as Steve’s lap. Instead he grabbed the soldier’s hand and tugged on it until he was out of his seat as well.
Steve charged  at the other man, gripped him at the back of the neck and began punching at his abdomen until he was doubled over. Skull staggered back, gave Steve the chance to land a kick square in his chest, sending him crashing back into another set of servers.
Tony jogged to the bathroom, determined to get in and out in a hurry. He hated to think Steve might up and disappear on him even though Steve was bound to him because of that whole master clause. He asked JARVIS to set the shower temperature for him while he removed his clothing.
Steve snorted and started running as well. “How could I when you’re taking all the stupid with you?”
“You won’t find anything here, you know,” the man said lightly, pushing his round wire framed glasses further up his nose. “Once I heard all the commotion, I set all databases to self destruct mode. Though, judging from that conversation you were having, it wasn’t information you came looking for.”
Tony laughed delightedly and patted Rhodey’s back, pulling away about a foot. “Empty threats, pooh-bear. You were never very good at them.”
It was the sort of mind numbing task Steve needed to calm himself as much as possible, punctuated at brief intervals by Tony waking up, taking meds and then falling back asleep and Bruce coming in and forcing him to go take care of himself while he checked on Tony.
“Well, I’ll be the death of you so sort of means you plan on spending the rest of your life with me.”
“Yeah! Neither did I!” Steve shot back. “You play the hand you’re dealt and strategize. No, this isn’t a war that everyone is aware of. It’s in the background, it’s everywhere, but it’s quiet and there is more at stake than you might have ever realized. We work together and then we move on to the next thing.”
Steve opened his eyes with a groan, not missing the amused smirk of his best friend standing over him.
Bucky laughed. “Yeah well it’s not my fault you suck at finding good places to hide. You’re a big guy.”
Tony curled himself into Steve, whispering apology after apology against the blond’s neck, letting Steve comfort him for the time being. He would probably wake up in the morning and worry about this all over again, but for the time being he wanted things to be okay and he wanted to keep feeling Steve holding onto him.
Steve bit the metaphorical bullet, asked the genius out on a date, and was relieved when Tony enthusiastically told him yes. With the way that his heart had been hammering in his chest he felt like he’d turned back into that awkward asthmatic kid he once was. He was still awkward but at least the asthma was gone.
Steve waved as the car took off and wondered just what he had gotten himself into as well as what he’d do to pass the time in Tony’s absence.
He looked up to meet the genie’s gaze to discover he was blushing and Tony smirked. That was apparently the wrong thing to do because his face shifted from embarrassed to angry and he slapped Tony across the face as hard as he could.
Steve tossed a balled up paper towel at Clint’s head before turning his attention back to Tony with a smile, leaning forward in his chair. “So are you going to eat it?”
He jumped when there was a loud set of raps on the door. Reflex had him grabbing his gun and aiming it at the door, hands steady and eyes narrowed. Nobody should have been able to get far enough to knock on his front door, he had guards for christ sakes. Or he'd had guards, he’d have to check on that.
Tony’s brain was a mess of incoherent thoughts as he valiantly tried to keep up with Steve’s pace, feeling Steve’s erratic thrusts and knowing he was close to finishing. Steve’s pants became harder, moving faster and faster before freezing inside Tony, body clenching as he spurted his release into the condom, falling bonelessly onto Tony for a moment as he tried to catch his breath.
A slight shudder went through Tony’s body and Steve reminded himself that it wasn’t his place to comfort the younger man, not now that he had his friends with him. Tony narrowed his eyes at the table as he spoke. “Obie—Obie did it.”
Steve’s head jerked up and he looked at her, his mouth falling open. “Peggy?” He had to look away because he needed to reboot his brain after being thrown into such a loop, but he had ignored the biggest sign of all that she knew Peggy and was probably related to her. So not a coincidence then. His eyes slid toward his friend as he searched for some sort of help.
“Oh yeah. I have to go...do this thing. I’ll probably be a little busy for the next few days actually because I have a concert thing.” Tony waved his hand dismissively as if what he was doing was not to be considered important. “So I might not be able to get in touch with you until after, but still. Call me!”
Steve chuckled and rolled his eyes as he hoisted another beam and rested it on his shoulders. “This would probably go faster if Tony showed up to help though.”
Steve did just that, taking his shirt off after Tony began driving and wringing the water out all over his floorboard. He didn’t comment, though, when Tony almost wrecked the car when he finally got a good look at him without his shirt.
Steve entered Tony’s bedroom after he and the others cleaned the kitchen. Tony had been ordered to the bed and told he could get out of cleaning this once since he supplied them with the meal. He mostly figured they could tell he was exhausted. So here he was, sitting on his bed with his tablet in his hand once more.
Schmidt placed his hands behind his back and strolled forward, unconcerned by Steve’s presence or the gun he still held firmly at his side. “Dear Captain, you yourself are feared by many. Does that not make you a coward as well?”
The first thing Steve noticed was the duck pond. He practically floated to the bridge that overlooked it and stared down.
Bucky clapped Steve’s shoulder. “We’ll find him,” and then took off, sprinting down the hall. “Don’t do anything stupid!”
Steve spread his hands slightly. “With all due respect, ma’am, what I’m getting out of this is of no concern at the moment. If Tony wishes to divulge that information at a later date, then the choice is his. I find it better to focus on what we have in common, that being that we are all determined to keep Tony safe, no matter how it is we as individuals have come to that consensus.”
Her lips were pressed together, forming a thin line. “Yes. I have seen the news. You also said that you had every confidence the team could function without you just once and that you’d show up.”
Tony grinned. “See? Even Captain America can be beat, so my dad is wrong. Right? Then I can be like you.”
“It doesn’t matter! I still treated it like it was you! I kissed it. I hugged it. I shared a bed with it and now…” he has to stop because he might start hyperventilating soon. He didn’t want to think about it too much.
“Here’s the thing, Captain.” Rhodey leaned back against the wall with his arms folded over his chest. “I’ve been friends with Tony Stark for more than 20 years. I’ve seen him at his best. And I’ve seen him at his worst. I met him when he was just a kid who wandered into MIT. He was too young to drive when he started MIT. I’m sure you knew that. I was there when his parents were alive. I was there to watch his asshole of a father treat him like shit. I was there when his parents died. I was there when he took over the company, when he was partying, drinking, being a jerk, all of that. I was there when he was kidnapped and I was there when we found him. I watched Tony surpass his father in every conceivable way. I watched him become the person I knew he could be, and he’s a better person than I ever even imagined he could be. Tony’s been through a lot. He’s been hurt. A lot. He likes to think he’s got everything under control and that he isn’t freaking out, but I know him, Steve. I know he takes on responsibility like he’s carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders and I know he blames himself for everything that goes wrong. He’s a brilliant man though and I’ll always be proud to call him my best friend. This should probably go without saying but, Captain, if you do anything to hurt him, anything at all, and believe me when I say I’ll be watching you, I will not hesitate to use whatever force possible to make you pay for it. Understood?”
Not anymore though. For as long as Tony decided to keep his distance and didn’t ‘accidentally’ blow up something, Steve would give him space to get over what really equated to a temper tantrum because he hadn’t gotten his way. And he wouldn’t get his way, no matter how many quiet glares he received or how many rooms suddenly emptied upon his entrance, or how many conversations stopped dead the second Tony laid eyes on him. Steve’s will was stronger than Tony’s petulance, he was sure of it even if the longer it went on the more annoyed Steve got.
The heavens must have been on Steve’s side in that moment because Tony didn’t do much more than shrug his shoulders, his good hand reaching down to pat Nuts-N-Bolts’ head or--maybe those just counted as eyes. Either way the bot whirred excitedly. “Yeah, I was. It’s in the past though, let’s just move on.”
Tony cleared his throat. “You said you were confused by me. That I was giving you mixed signals and you had no idea what to do with it. You also said that you’d like to see me more. I showed up because you wanted me to, Steve. Not out of guilt. I thought maybe if I showed up and helped that you’d get the message.”
Skull dropped to the ground like a brick, body limp, laying in a pool of blood that didn’t seem to be slowing down in growth.
“All right,” Steve started, “introduction time. Everyone knows Tony Stark. Stark, this is my team. Well some of my team. They are first response if you need them.”
Steve sighed, long suffering, grateful for the silence even if that too seemed a little pointed when coming from Tony. Steve ignored him in favor of watching the door, waiting for his team to show up.
“I have some hover shoes here. That’s more for mass production and a much smaller scale version of repulsor technology. It still has too many flaws in it though, so I’m not going to waste a lot of time on trying to impress you with it.”
“No. No we’re not. We are not doing double dates. I have had my fill of bad experiences going on doubles dates with you, Bucky Barnes.”
“Then give him a reason to trust you first. So far all he knows is that you want weapons and armor from him. He just escaped from HYDRA. You know what they’re like.”
Somehow their texting relationship lasted through half the semester when school started again and Steve was honestly concerned as to whether or not Tony was actually planning a wedding. Based on what little he still knew about the guy, it didn’t seem too far off base that he’d plan a wedding to a guy he never met. He was oddly eccentric.
He heard Pepper apologizing to Steve as he hit the elevator. This wasn’t how the rest of tonight was supposed to go. He was going to tell Steve and watch movies and spend a couple of more days living in denial. He wasn’t even angry at Steve or Pepper. He was angry because it was Obie. It was the man who had taken care of him after Howard had died. He’d been Tony’s mentor and father figure and taught Tony the ropes at Stark Industries. He was angry because his weapons were the crux of the entire problem and because he was too stupid to know what was going on before it got this far. He was supposed to be a genius. He should have noticed. He should have known.
“Pierce is here,” Bucky said quietly. Steve clenched his fist at his side; he was well aware of Alexander Pierce’s involvement in what happened to Bucky after the war, of the cruelness held by that man. He’d been like a ghost since Bucky’s escape, no trace left of him anywhere except for now, here today. Steve should be out there, Steve needed to be in here. He squeezed his eyes shut for a moment and took a steadying breath. Bucky’s breathing became heavy, “Should I—shit!” Gunshots echoed over the comm.
“I’m right here with you.” He started rubbing a hand up and down Steve’s back as fast as his own hand was able to. “You’re not alone and I won’t let the cold take you again, Steve.”
“Just a genie. Yeah right. I don’t think genies are supposed to be as sassy as you are, but I kind of like it. It suits who I am and you’ve made things interesting.”
The elevator stopped, the doors opening. Steve stepped out, checking in every direction for a sign of anyone else. He held his gun firmly at his side and listened for any sound that might lead him in the right direction.
“I don’t think he’d ever feel like that. That’s why I am calling unresolved sexual tension. You guys have it, and if you think I’m making that up, you can ask Peggy and Pepper too. Trust me when I say that Tony is not going to fall into line with all these assholes getting uppity about the fact that you’re gay. You should at least let him know how you feel about him. I mean how you really feel.”
Steve lifted his arms just barely and turned a complete circle in front of everyone before stopping with an expectant smile on his face. “Well?”
Great. He was never going to stop messing things up. He opened his mouth to apologize but Tony turned and walked quickly from the room without a word. He hadn’t even meant to snap at Tony. All he’d wanted was Tony after the hellish month he had, but instead he’d hurt his feelings or just pissed him off. Probably both knowing Tony.
What felt like hours but was most likely a minute the Hulk returned with a very still Tony and Steve felt his stomach bottom out. He’d run toward the Hulk and crouched down next to the genius when he was placed on the ground. He wasted no time in ripping off Iron Man’s face plate. Tony could yell at him for it later. His first instinct was to feel for a pulse. Tony was cold. So cold but there was a faint pulse present. Steve tried to hold back the tears that sprang to his eyes as his own memories of cold water rushing toward him came to the forefront.
He’d ended up right next to Tony on the couch who had smiled and handed him a controller. Steve took it, smiling quickly and then turned his attention to the tv screen. Tony didn’t try to bother him. He was strangely silent but Steve could still feel his eyes on him.
Tony didn’t say anything for minutes that stretched on for what felt like forever and Steve started to worry that he’d said the wrong thing again. When Tony spoke it was almost a relief. “You’re annoying sometimes, Cap.”
The genius was grinning. He grabbed whatever he would need and made his way upstairs. It didn’t take long for everyone to crowd around and there were a lot more people that had shown up than Tony recognized.
“I will always choose Iron Man when I need someone to have my back. That’s always a given. I also enjoy having Tony Stark around too, though.”
Steve took the StarkPad from Tony and leaned against the counter, arms crossed over his chest. He looked a little concerned. “I’m going out to lunch soon. That Italian place a few blocks down. I was hoping you’d join me.” Another bright smile.
On Peter’s eighth birthday, Tony and Steve had decided the park would be a good place to have it. Peter had made a lot of friends and the park would be a great place for them to run around so they wouldn’t tear up the house.
Tony Stark was sitting just outside the gym when he heard the laughter. He knew from experience that that kind of laughter was the kind usually followed by trouble. He slowly stood up and walked to the corner of the building before peering around the side. A boy, skinny as anything he'd ever seen, was backed into a corner by two basketball players who already had their fists raised. Before Tony could act, one of them punched the boy hard, in the stomach, and laughed as he fell before delivering a kick to his back.
“Steve!” He gave the soldier a smile. “Just the man I wanted to see. I made some things! Lots of things actually. Come take a look.”
Steve knelt down on the floor, hand outstretched to pat the bot who began racing his way around the legs of the coffee table when acknowledged. “Congratulations, little guy. It looks like you’re getting much better at coordination.” He tried to catch a glance at the bot’s screen as he shot by, just barely able to make out the words. “Captain Nuts-N-Bolts. You’re about to surpass me. I’m going to be honest with you Bolts, I don’t know how I feel about that.”
Tony was laughing loudly. “As you heard, that’s J.A.R.V.I.S. J.A.R.V.I.S., this is Steve the genie. If you need anything, Steve, just ask him and he’ll help you. Let me tell you about the adventure I just had, J.”
Tony laughed, quiet but laced with pain. He clutched at his ribs and winced. “I didn’t ask to be taken.”
While Natasha was on the phone Bucky leaned over the table they were sitting at to get a look at what Steve had been busily working on. “I thought you were supposed to be doing a self-portrait.”
Steve took a deep breath. “I do! It doesn’t mean that you can’t take a little time out of your life to offer up a tiny bit of help. I’d like to see you there!”
“I’m out.” Tony picked up his son and peppered his cheek with kisses. “Be good. Go to bed when Natasha tells you to. Don’t make any bets with her. And no more ice cream.”
The genius stopped mumbling but continued to pace, albeit a little slower. “I know that,’ he answered, just a smidge indignant.
Fury stayed where he was standing, and Steve was unable to tell if the man was upset or if he was trying to avoid giving Tony a pitiful look. “They went on a trip together, and they will be gone for awhile.”
“I guess—the connection I’m trying to make here is that while you were selfless enough to let your girl go, give her the space she asked for, I wasn’t—I’m not. When she left I clutched at anything she could give me even at the expense of her. That’s why people like you, Cap, despite what you do, you deserve any piece of happiness this life has out there for you, even if it means leaving things behind to get it.”
When he received an affirmative from everyone he began checking and double checking his guns, listening to both his team fight their way toward the warehouse and the sound of the men on the other side of the wall he hid behind, unaware of anything happening around them. Steve shook his head in disgust; nobody in his organization would be as careless as everyone here seemed to be.
Tony watched Steve, a slightly nervous tick taking over his hands. Steve thought it might be a good time to approach him. He could extend an olive branch.
Tony looked from Clint to Steve for verification, and Steve wondered just how much this was going to happen. “It’s all true.”
“Why are you always so god damn ungrateful? I’ve given you everything you have ever wanted in life. The best schools. Piano lessons ever since you were a toddler. I told you that whatever you do, please make sure you keep the integrity of our name intact. Instead I find out you’re part of a rock band that takes away from the time you actually need to practice.”
“What’s the hold up, Tony? We’ve been…” Pepper stopped midsentence to fully grasp what she had just walked in on.
Steve shifted up slightly, removing both fingers slowly, grinning as Tony bit his lip to keep from calling out again. He tore open the packet with his teeth, a sight that always caused Tony to only become more wanton and then he was sliding it over his dick, keeping his eyes closed as he did so, and giving himself a few slow pumps.
It took awhile for both of them to finally come down from their high, passing the time with lazy kisses. Tony’s hands were roaming all over Steve’s chest. This was obviously heaven or Tony was being rewarded for something. It’s not like people like Steve were standing on every corner waiting for someone to snatch them up. Tony wasn’t surprised to learn that Steve’s feelings were mutual because they’d been doing their bizarre little dance for awhile now, but he was surprised someone like Steve could want someone like him.
Steve rubbed a finger over his eye. “Look, you know that we think you’re just as important to the team as the rest of us right?”
Tony laughed. “Noted.” He looked at the house with wary eyes. “So, not a romantic getaway. Are you bringing me here to kill me? Because I swear I only drank your orange juice from the jug like three times. Clint does it every day!”
Rhodey huffed a laugh at Tony’s indignant cry. Tony flipped his best friend off while idly rubbing his arm at the abused spot.
“I’m surprised your buddy Schmidt didn’t tell you,” the genius said flatly. “I guess you should be used to it though, the art of keeping secrets and backstabbing. Remember what you told me? This really is a cut throat business we’ve found ourselves in.”
What they arrived to was all out chaos. Smoke billowed from the top floors of Stark Industries, gunfire being exchanged between a line of police and from within the crowd of people scurrying about trying to get out of the way. There were firemen running in and out of the building carrying stretchers and covered in soot and news crews scavenging like vultures at the barricades along with bystanders who seemed to have no regard for their own safety.
“Don’t leave us,” the blond bit out, then shook his head, a flush making its way up his neck. “No. That didn’t—we haven’t—I haven’t seen you in awhile and…It’s not about just what you can do for us, that’s not what I’m trying to say, I wanted to make that clear.”
Tony stopped what he was doing and sighed. This was going to mess up his record. "I hadn't noticed. Thanks. Glad we had this talk."
He stopped when he did reach the piano and rested an arm on top while he watched the brunet play. He knew he was probably blushing at the moment which probably looked rather strange for someone dressed the way he was, but oh well.
“Wha--?” Before he could finish Tony had grabbed him by the waist and lifted up into the sky with the soldier. Steve was holding on pretty tight if the sensors in his suit were anything to go by.
“I know. I wish it didn’t have to be this way, but keep your head up high. Don’t let them see that you’re hurting because they’re out for blood.”
Steve took it with a smile of his own. “Steve Rogers, art teacher. You already knew that though.” If both of them lingered a little too long on the handshake, neither of them bothered to mention it.
“I’ve been saying your name for like two whole minutes. At first it was just about getting your attention and then it turned into seeing how long it would take if I just kept saying your name. I got impatient though so here we are now.”
Tony finished the tail end of the instrumental part and was smirking again. Steve stared at him for several seconds before finally giving a small round of applause for the performance. Tony took a tiny bow while seated and scooted over to make room for the both of them to be seated on the bench.
Steve was resting against the doorframe, arms crossed over his chest. “Just a little in the way of plans and all that.”
The blonde abruptly shut the ledger, all important information recorded and ready to be hidden away for the time being. Steve sat at the table a bit longer though, his pen forgotten, fingers steepled underneath his chin.
“Nothing,” Tony said, a little too quickly. He plastered a smile on his face. “It’s true. They’re here, the good Captain’s got one on as you can see. You’re welcome to try yours on as well.”
Tony mock scowled at Steve. “Sergeant Major Nuts-N-Bolts is not a punishment. Why would you say that? You’re going to break his circuit board. He loves you already, Captain.”
Steve was in the art room, working on a charcoal piece for his final project. The drawing itself was a blurred image rather than anything with specific detail, but the fact he was rendering his best friend onto the paper didn’t go unnoticed. Even though they had fast become friends, Tony had always seemed to be one step ahead and just out of his reach.
When Steve did return a few hours and one demolished punching bag later, Tony was asleep again, face scrunched up a bit. Steve sat down in what had become his chair, reached over and smoothed out the creases on Tony’s face until they were smooth and his face slack. Steve sighed contentedly, thumb brushing Tony’s cheekbone gently until he felt his own eyes drifting closed.
Steve wanted to argue further but he already knew it was pointless. Bucky was stubborn and protective to a fault, getting him to leave would be like pulling teeth. “Don’t die,” was all he said, turning back and staring down the hallway Tony had disappeared down long ago.
“I don’t think they’ll let us into the lobby if we’re completely drenched like this,” Steve mused while he swayed with Tony, in the rain, a smile on his face hidden in the hair of the man in his arms.
Steve just winked at Tony. “Don’t worry about it. No pressure. If you don’t want to then you don’t have to.”
Steve laughed. “Bye.” He smiled at Tony and gave him a look that Tony wasn’t completely sure he understood. “See you around, Tony.”
Steve let out a breath and gently held Tony’s face between his hands as he returned the kiss. This was happening and Tony wanted it too. He tightened his grip and pulled the brunet’s face closer to him as the kiss intensified. The brush of Tony's knuckles against his stomach was all the warning he got before he felt Tony's dexterous fingers wrap around his dick. Steve jumped as Tony gave his dick one long slow pump, and slowly let out a shaky breath.
Tony, gaze somewhere over Steve’s left shoulder, sighed. “How am I supposed to know what the right choice is?”
“Yes. Yes it does. Even if you do make him remember who he is, he’s not going to go back to being the guy he was. There’s no way. It’s never going to happen.”
“I guess I can see your point.” He cleared his throat and eyed the guitar still resting against the walls. “So you were going to dazzle me today, right?”
The look Tony shot him was something he’d have to think about later. Tony wanted to come with him and help, but Steve had forbidden it numerous times even though he’d allowed the guy with the wings to go along. He felt guilty Sam was risking his own life, he wasn’t going to put Tony at risk too.
Tony leaned over, kissing Steve just then. It was only supposed to be a short kiss, but it ended up lasting longer than that.
“The information I’ve found suggests otherwise. And if he knows you’re not dead then he’ll probably be paying you a visit soon. I can’t even get to him to stall him. His secretary is handling everything outside of the current business he is conducting and…”
Steve quirked an eyebrow and allowed his fingers to brush over it again, curious about the tattoo on Tony’s chest. It was round and blue, but with an intricate pattern. “And the tattoo?”
“Put her through, J.” He swung his legs over the back of the couch and landed on a cushion next to Steve.
He spoke in hushed tones when he got to Obie’s involvement, eyes hard as he stared at the wall in front of him, fists balled up in front of him, only relaxing once he spoke about going to find Steve and his team and the way they’d helped him out.
The soldier just shook his head and looked away. He didn’t have an answer. He didn’t want to bare his soul. He didn’t want to talk about why he was avoiding everyone he cared about and why he was longing for the past more than ever right now.
With lightning quick reflexes only reserved for those who believe they’ve located their own personal holy grail, Tony picked it up and looked closely. After a moment he shook it and discovered there was no liquid. Just a rock or something. Figures.
“Steve, we’re heading out! Gonna go watch The Avengers play so Bucky can stop fretting over his new lady love.”
Clint swallowed visibly and made a dash for the door, quickly followed out by the others as they split off into every direction looking for their resident kid genius.
Steve pocketed his phone and he knew he had a stupid grin on his face but he couldn’t help it. He had no idea what was going on between him and Tony but whatever it was happened to be making him pretty happy. When he looked up he had two sets of very curious eyes on him.
The genius gave Steve a curious look. “Is there something happening right now that I’m not aware of?”
“You,” Tony said angrily, “work together. With your people. I have to trust that you guys won’t somehow turn against me or make even more demands from me than you already have.”
“Sweet!” Clint grabbed the shirt and vest Tony held out to him. “Hey, guys,” he shouted out the door, “it’s true. Stark has presents for us!”
The genius stopped. “Okay.” Steve saw a flash of what he thought might be hurt cross Tony’s face. “Let me know when you’re in the air at least. Yeah?”
The blond just huffed because he didn’t know what to say to that. “I wish.” He watched Tony leave with Natasha when his phone began to ring. “I’m on my way, Bucky. Calm down.” He didn’t give his friend a chance to reply before he hung up and headed toward the front with the rest of his group.
“Even after what he’s put you through? That’d be enough of a reason for most people to kill another human being.”
Tony finished his song and glanced at Steve. His face was heated and he realized this was probably the sappiest, most romantic thing he’d ever done in his life, but the look on Steve’s face was definitely worth all of it.
Steve shook his head. “No, Tony. He’s not, but you should be Tony because you’re good at being Tony.”
Once they were half a mile away they ditched the vehicle and Bruce behind, making their way from there on out by foot, quickly but quietly.
“Steve. Steve is the Captain, call him Cap.”  He waved his hand at Steve, gesturing him closer. “Take a seat, old timer. Don’t want you to hurt your back or anything.”
He paused just outside the door and leaned in closer to see if he could hear it better. After a few seconds he straightened himself up and looked around to see if there was anyone nearby before he barely pushed the door open, just enough to hear and was greeted with a view he was not entirely expecting.
He opened his bedroom door and waited for Steve to enter before shutting it and taking a seat on his bed.
Tony offered an apologetic look before pulling Steve from the bathroom with him. Pepper was holding a garment bag that she told Tony he was to change into after the plane was in the air. Then she turned once more and this time Tony followed, not letting go of Steve’s hand.
“Right away, sir.” Jarvis said, English voice carrying the a small hint of fondness that Tony was sure he hadn’t actually programmed into him. He and Jarvis were due for some quality time when this was all over.
Steve shrugged and rolled his eyes once more while he waited. Fifteen minutes later though, Tony returned, and he looked ridiculous. He struck a pose and pivoted around on a foot. “How do I look?”
Both men turned their attention to Clint who took a step back. “Or I can come back later? What did I just walk in on?”
Steve smiled down at the brunet and grabbed his hips, pulling Tony’s body flush with his once more as he pressed open mouthed kisses to his neck. His hands began roaming sliding and exploring all of Tony’s dips and curves before coming to rest on Tony’s ass. Gripped it in the palms of his hands. And squeezed the mounds, massaged them then let a few fingers dip between them to feel out Tony’s entrance once, twice, before returning his hands to his hips.
They sat down to eat and after quickly finishing, Tony helped Peter pick out what he wanted to wear for the day before finding something to wear too.
For his part, Steve wanted to be annoyed with Bucky but he understood the logic even if he didn’t plan on admitting it out loud.
“Well let me be the first one to tell you that you did an outstanding job protecting me. Really, guys. Bravo!”
“You just nothing, Steve. Look.” Bucky rested his arms on the table, leaning forward a little more and Steve knew he meant business now. “Do you realize how many double dates I have taken you on? Because it has been a lot. No matter who I introduced you to, you were never able to show any sign of interest. Okay so at first I thought you were still just bummed about Peggy, which is completely understandable, but then it wasn’t about that anymore. You just managed to make yourself feel awkward because you think you can’t talk to girls without sounding dumb. And that’s--well that’s kind of true, but you’re sort of a love at first sight guy and if you aren’t interested from the beginning then it won’t be happening later. Steve, I haven’t seen you smile like this over another person since before Peggy. You weren’t this mushy about her and you were head over heels in love with her. So I’m telling you this right now, as a friend. Stop holding yourself back and make sure you hold on to a good thing before you manage to lose it completely. You actually do deserve that.”
He felt Tony let go of a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding. “Like you’d get an apology any other way.” He pulled his head back a little. “But what about the times when you have to do the apologizing?”
Steve stood up and brushed off his pants. “You know, that actually took less time than I thought it would.”
“Oh. Yeah no, that’s, it’s understandable. You’ve got another life after all. I’m not going to tell you that you have to stick around.”
“Bruce can vouch for him, even though he’s no fun and repeatedly told me I was wasting my time building something just for the amusement of others. Sometimes he reminds me just how old he really is. I can show you though, Nuts-N-Bolts has--well, he’s a learning bot so he hears commands and improves over time, but--” Tony wrinkled his nose. “This would be easier to just show you. Right now. I’ll show you right now.”
When Tony began to thrust his hips, fucking himself on Steve’s fingers, Steve added a third. His fingers found Tony’s prostate and he pressed against it before sliding his fingers over and around, Tony freely moving his hips up and down now.
