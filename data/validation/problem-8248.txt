Steve smiling in that shy way that only he got when he became self-conscious; Steve shining like a comet on Tony's sensors when he was looking for the soldier in the middle of a battle; Steve training in the training room simulations; Steve spending most of his free time in the lab with Tony, drawing in silence, just so Tony wouldn't be alone; Steve during movie nights, when he fell asleep and his head fell on Tony's shoulder ...
Like, for a potion?”
“Bareback, then.” Tony grabbed a nipple in each hand and twisted a little, just to make Steve moan. He positioned Steve aligned to his entrance, and, slowly, impaled himself on his throbbing cock.
"Nothing." Steve swallowed. "I'm just wondering when you're going there." He nodded at the karaoke stage, where Nat and Bruce were singing Mamma Mia.
“So, you have my records from the moment I smelled that flower. Was I also infected like Tony?” Steve looked back at Tony, who frowned, not getting the point.
“That day, in court,” Steve began, leaning over the marble island and leaning on his arms. “I was shot -”
Tony let out a heavy sigh.
, to live with you in that Tower that I had spoken so badly about.
“Gosh, Steve, this is... This is
to do that?”
“Of course, I do,” Tony replied without hesitation. “What question is that?”
That hurt. Tony didn’t think he could feel anything anymore, but he found he could underestimate his own feelings when it came to Steve.
Tony could see the headlines:
Tony thought.
"Is that why you did not join us today, young Parker?" Thor asked.
Tony looked away from the screen and looked up in time to see Steve's reaction as he read his message, the quick inspiration and his Adam's apple going up and down was more than enough for Tony to realize he was on the right track.
“You will.”
That was supposed to be a calm day, like any other, in the life of the Earth’s Mightiest Heroes: fight some minor villains, but no less disgusting and annoying, nothing really troubling, leave the mess to Damage Control and go back to the Compound to continue the routine, until some real villain decided to dominate the world and give them some work to do.
“Very well.” He smiled at Steve. "I'm sorry, dear, but I can’t stay. I have a date with three adorable winged ladies and a monster with multiple heads.”
"Can you give me fifteen minutes? I need to make sure I won a bet," Tony looked at Steve.
be late again when it comes to you," Steve winked and turned, heading toward the Tower entrance, letting Tony slowly transform into a body purely made up of love and desire.
“And which one is it?” Tony was startled to hear himself almost screaming.
“Four bullets,” Tony said quietly, unable to contain himself. Four shots that pierced Tony’s heart every time he watched that day’s footage. He had lost count of how many times he’d been hit by those four shots since returning from his own limbo. And how many times he’d cried until he had no more tears because he couldn’t prevent it from happening.
Tony came over and kissed Steve passionately, grabbing him, rubbing their bodies and their dicks, taking Steve's every moan and sigh, making it look like his arms had multiplied to be on every piece of Steve's exposed skin at the same time. One of those arms managed, at some point during this make out session, to find a tube of lube - the same one Tony had thrown away when he’d tried to give himself a handjob. Tony showed the lube to Steve.
“Did you hear that, Tony? No more sex-pollen!” Steve smiled widely, looking down.
"I love you," Tony heard himself say to Steve for the first time.
Tony looked sideways at him. “I think it’s better for us not to get to the heart of the matter.”
Steve shrugged and looked a little embarrassed, a little unsure of himself. “I just want to make sure that we’re on the same page.”
Tony stared at Steve's back, his brain running a million miles per hour. What had just happened? Had he got it right? And what was that hole full of air that he had in his stomach? Was it a delayed effect of the explosion? It didn’t seem possible, because a side effect wouldn’t make him smile, right?
of you breaking into my home?” Tony turned off the repulsors and went down to the floor, standing next to Steve, who was pretending very badly that he was no longer worried. Tony knew he was tense, waiting for the bad news Strange had certainly brought. Steve had his eyes fixed on the Sorcerer Supreme and his gaze alternated between Strange's face and the box he held.
Tony's dick throbbed under the undersuit and he moaned low.
Tony was breathing fast, his heart was pounding in his ears, and he felt dizzy. Steve said he wanted to see Tony. That was good, right? But he hadn’t left Tony much of a choice.
“You’re the best thing that ever happened to me. I could draw you now, just like that.” Steve stroked Tony’s face and let his hand go down his arm, until he reached Tony’s hand, which he held, brought to his lips and kissed with adoration. “But I would never be able to put on paper all your nuances, all your complexity, all your beauty, all your perfection, Tony. Nothing I try to do will do you justice.”
Someone who was worthy of love.
"Indeed." Thor agreed, sitting at the end of the table.
"I will have a word with Hercules to see if he knows anything about the exit of the hydra from the Tartarus," Thor said. "These events do not usually foretell good news for the Greeks.”
Tony smiled back, because he trusted Steve. He
“This is good as hell, Steve.
“We're together now, as your parents most likely wanted,” Steve said.
“Since I smelled that flower, I can only think of you.” Tony pulled away enough to look Steve in the eye. “
"Steve, this is completely normal," Tony said, following Steve and taking a seat on one of the benches around the island. "The boy’s on trial for murder. How do you think his head is right now?"
Well, that's it for now.
“Okay, I’ll try.”
“What I mean is that we switched places.”
Tony shifted uncomfortably.
See you soon! Enjoy!
“No,” Tony said instead. “No, there isn’t anybody.”
Steve frowned. “What? How so?”
“My name is Liz Stark-Rogers.”
“Just keep firing,” Natasha said in a voice as bored as his. “The sooner we finish here, the faster we go home.”
She looked around.
"It's a great advice, if you'll allow me to say."
“It's time,” they all froze in place. “We can’t wait any longer.”
“Because it means that we’d be together anyway, whether or not we knew the contents of the box in advance. This we have right here.” Steve lifted their hands and kissed Tony's hand. “
Tony leaned on his elbows and stared at Steve still smiling crookedly.
“Oh, my God, Steve,” Tony's own dick throbbed.
Steve finished slicing the zucchini and started slicing peppers. Tony was amazed by the scene in front of him. It had absolutely nothing special, but he just couldn't take his eyes off Steve holding the knife and his hand going up and down, up and down as the blade sliced through the vegetables.
“And what do you see?” Tony whispered, out of breath.
"Okay, let's go back and focus on the details. Invitations first.”
“What?” Tony whispered to no one in particular.
Tony thought, because he was already one step away from having an extremely embarrassing boner there, right in the middle of a meeting of the Avengers with Nick Fury.
"Talk to me, my love," Tony said, tilting his neck to give Steve access, which sucked in a particularly sensitive spot. Tony moaned loudly.
"What do you want to know?"
happy. I don’t know when you decided that happiness was something unattainable for you, but it’s not true. And you, more than anyone in this world, know that I have flaws. We caused a war because of these flaws, Tony.” Steve took the last step. “I’d do anything to convince you that you’re worth all the effort, that you’re worthy of all happiness, but words will never be able to convince you. Let me be with you, then, to prove, day after day, how much you mean to me. How much I love you.”
“You suffered a mild concussion, some bruising and a dislocation in your right leg after this morning’s battle and you were brought here.” Explained the Al. “The concussion and bruises on your upper body have already been treated. Your dislocation still needs care.”
Steve refocused his attention on Tony. "What is it?"
- and looked back at Rhodes. "I should’ve paid more attention to where I was coming when I accepted the case, but it didn't even cross my mind that you could be involved in any way."
"About what?"
"I like you in all your ways." Steve smiled and kissed him.
"Tell me something that is not impressive when it comes to Tony Stark." Steve kissed the top of Tony's head, who laughed.
“Won’t take long. Try to relax, okay?” Natasha smiled at her and walked away, heading toward the front of Quinjet. “Contact either of those two and see if they've gone back to the Compound,” she whispered to Clint and Sam.
“Yes, all the time. To think that I would never see you again, that I could never tell you how I felt, and that it was all my fault? There wasn’t a minute when I didn’t think about you.”
"Maybe I can start to reconsider," Steve smirked. "The company has improved a lot.”
"All right." What else could Steve say? The man had just said that he liked him, even though they had known each other for a few hours, that there was a connection, whatever it was. But it was a good thing. So, how to avoid that it was something, and to let that keep happening?
that’s so damn good! Keep going!”
Tony laid Steve on the laboratory floor. He couldn't stand to get anywhere more comfortable. His undersuit was already over the edge of the uncomfortable. Steve moaned and brushed his lips on Tony's. He circled Tony's lips with his tongue who opened his mouth slightly, letting Steve drive his tongue in. Without hesitation, their tongues were in a duel, both of them gasping for breath, their groins aligned and grinding into the other.
"And since when do you have affairs with Rogers?"
"Hey, my darling." Tony smiled at him. "I thought Fury had already sucked your souls and that there was no hope anymore.”
He heard her sigh again. "You will hear all of this again from the Chief's mouth, but probably not in a nice way or with the right details. So, you better know by someone who cares about you and Peter. And know that I would rather be having this conversation in person. Talking on the phone sucks."
Steve started by betting four chips. Natasha kept the bet on four chips, Clint only put two more and Tony didn’t bet anything, perks of big blind.
“What time is it?”
Tony’s heart squeezed and expanded, all at the same time with butterflies that found some opening in the armor and reached his stomach.
“Thinking. I can hear you thinking. Thinking
"Maybe it's time for you to improve on this and call this girl to do something other than the decathlon, right?" Steve winked.
Tony thought.
Tony walked through a room, with the bed meticulously made, and went down a narrow corridor, until he came to a room that was lit and smelled of coffee: the kitchen, with the living room right next to it. Steve was behind the kitchen island, his back to Tony, preparing several things at the same time. On the island, two steaming cups of coffee placed on opposite sides, facing each other.
“Thanks, Friday, but follow the original plan, okay?” He took off his shoes and coat, and threw himself on the bed. "Just tell Natasha and keep secret from the others. Let me know when it's an hour before the party.”
“It's what I do,” it was possible to detect a shrug in AI's voice.
"What the hell is going on here?" Clint asked, without any patience.
“For you?” Steve stroked Tony's face gently. “Always.”
innocent, because if Natasha puts her hand on the fire for someone, I do too. Second: if she used the favor, she had with me to ask me to come here to defend the boy, the case was
He turned, and in an action that would make him think hard for the next few hours, Tony came down from the counter, crossed the short distance between them and, standing on his tiptoes, hugged the soldier by the neck. It took a fraction of a second for Tony to hear the water bottle fall on the floor and he felt Steve's hands around him, large and warm, pulling him close.
Steve pushed some more, until he was whole inside Tony, and then stopped again, because the feeling was overwhelming, indescribable, it was so incredible, and they both groaned loudly. Tony rolled his eyes and was breathless for a few moments. It was a suffocating sensation of pure contentment to feel Steve inside him. Feeling that completeness was something Tony had never even imagined possible because he never imagined himself to be so incomplete, not until that moment, when he finally found the missing part. The last piece of the puzzle. The perfect fit.
"I know. I already heard the news," her voice was calculatedly neutral.
“What's the problem?” Natasha asked. It couldn’t be just that. There was something else disturbing the android.
Tony laughed softly.
That thought made Steve smile.
That brings out the man in me
"I told you to not underestimate me. Or do you think I didn’t see the smiles, the glances, the slippery hands?”
” Tony frowned.
Tony.”
“Hey!” Happy protested.
"And you always ended up screaming my name."
"Does that mean you haven’t even gone to bed yet?"
“Who are you?”
"Let’s go, son. We'll take you inside," Steve said, guiding Peter through the entrance to the house. "You're going to take a shower, eat something and rest in your bed," Steve smiled and Tony wanted to give him the Best Effort Award for that attempt.
"Have you two finished dating?" Clint asked. "Because things are not very easy around here.”
As soon as he got in the Stark Tower at the end of another workday at Stark Resilient, a day that passed by him without him even remembering what he had done, and that he allowed himself to take a shower, his feet didn’t take him to bed or to the kitchen. He found himself walking straight to the lab and wearing the stealth armor once again.
With a grunt, Steve kissed him and Tony was surprised by his ability to make a sweet and delicate kiss turn into something dirty and sexy so fast. But Tony wasn’t complaining. Ah, no, far from it. He was loving every second, every stronger grip of Steve's hands on his skin, every hickey at the base of his neck, every breathless groan in his ear as Tony fingered his back. Without communicating what he was about to do, Steve laid Tony back on the marble, came down, and holding Tony by the waist, pulled him to the edge of the counter.
“I know. But I wish you had trusted me earlier. I always trusted you, Tony, even when you thought that outside that armor you weren’t someone trustworthy.”
Tony looked at him.
Steve shrugged.
“Come here.” Steve pulled Tony into a hug. “I help you with what you need, my love. I love you, remember?”
Nick Fury was always punctual when it came to starting their meetings and that day wasn't different.
"Now put three cups of flour into the bowl, three tablespoons of salt, and then break the eggs and mix slowly."
“There's an extremely rare, valuable ingredient with a level of power that is beyond your understanding in there.”
Rhodes sighed. "It's not easy being your friend, you know?"
He turned his gaze to Steve's face.
“Happy?” Liz laughed with sarcasm. “My happiness died embracing the love of his life in the midst of the flames of a laboratory in an Earth that no longer exists.” The tears marked the face of her mercilessly.
“Great. Steve likes them all.”
Tony bit Steve's shoulder and groaned loudly, as he tightened his arms around him even more. Steve took that as a yes.
Tony couldn’t formulate a coherent sentence because of the huge lump in his throat. That should be forbidden, so much love, so much sincerity.
"He already did."
“See you later then.”
“Look, Tony,” Steve continued. “I just want you to know that you can
don't sing, Steve." Tony was outraged. He filled the sake glass and took a sip.
With a groan of frustration, Tony slid his head to Steve's shoulder and his hands went to the soldier’s back, who hugged him back.
you." Tony's smile faltered, but it came back bigger than before and Steve's world cleared almost completely.
“What?” Tony stood and stuck to the glass, trying to see the girl's hands.
“We should immediately take this box inside and put it in the vault, as we promised.” Steve said, looking suspiciously at the golden box in Tony's hands.
“Really?”
Tony smiled at A.I.'s remark.
At that moment the door to the meeting room opened and Tony came in smiling, wearing a kneaded black T-shirt, black sweatpants and bare feet, and with his hands raised, apologizing.
"So what? We both already know that."
"I'm just telling you not to panic or anything. I know you." She looked at him intently, as if she could see into him. "And you deserve it too.”
"Thank you, Tony."
And Tony left the kitchen, trying his best not to jump in excitement at the new information he had gotten during his little dinner with Steve Rogers, the best host he had ever had.
"So is there a possibility that Peter will leave with us or not?" Steve wanted objectivity. The whole situation was already too complicated for him to still have to worry about subjectivities.
"What the hell is going on?" He looked around and found Natasha sitting at the foot of his bed, fully clothed for a party, in a fair red dress draped in sequins, her hair falling in waves to her shoulders and soft makeup. “Wow, you look stunning.”
, that I couldn’t do it.” Steve put his hand behind his head and scratched the back of it, as if he were suddenly uncomfortable. He sighed, looked up, and looked again a few inches to the left of where Tony really was. “We need to talk.”
"Look, I understand if you don't want to accept it, but here you can have a normal stay, as if you were in your own home," Steve actually smiled this time. Tony looked away for a few seconds, then smiled and looked at Steve, who felt his heart racing. "Okay, then. I accept your guest room, Steve."
Even though he didn’t remember what actually had happened, even though he had been told everything that happened the day he erased his memory, Tony knew what he most likely had felt. He was still him, only with a piece of his mind missing. It was frustrating, but he did his best to find the most accurate description possible of his own feelings to tell Steve. “Redemption, perhaps? To make sure that your death was not in vain? After all, you died after fighting that stupid Act. And look where it had taken us. Everyone was now seeing that the Act wasn’t the solution, everyone realized that you weren’t the villain of the story, the
I have no home”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Shut up, Nat, and tell me how I'm going to prove your godson’s innocence."
Tony managed to think.
haven't you left yet?” Tony asked, hurt and angry.
He came over and gave Tony a quick kiss. Tony tangled up his legs with Steve's and let out a sigh of satisfaction.
“Oh, my God, Steve, how can you say those things and still be sexy like that?” Tony said, pinching one of Steve’s nipples between his fingers, making Steve throw his head back and moan loudly. Tony smiled, satisfied.
" Tony said. "I mean,
“I wish you could see what I see when I look at you.”
The plane's door closed and Tony went to sit in front of Steve. The two watched from the windows on the plane taxiing down the runway and said nothing until the aircraft was in the air.
"Does anyone have any other ideas?" Steve asked.
“I have the feeling that we won’t have to wait much longer.”
“If Natasha asked us to stay here and not there in the other room, she certainly has her reasons.”
"What kind of dream? A nightmare?” Tony knew nightmares were not only frequent as they were expected, doing what they did. And Steve used to have some of the most disturbing.
"Sam, do you think you can give Clint a ride?" Steve asked.
Wanda smiled.
“Very well. In five minutes in the quinjet,” Steve looked around the room and nodded. “Avengers Assemble!”
Tony gave a quick kiss and smiled.
"Yes, I'm sorry. But I wanted to ask you something else."
Tony was unable to contain his disappointment. His disbelief made him come back to his senses. He was expecting some magic herb, a frog leg, maybe. Strange said it would be for a potion, right? And that it was extremely powerful or something. That lone flower resting inside the box didn’t fit a sorcerer’s potion ingredient requirements. It was beautiful, Tony admitted. The red lily, which Tony saw only a few times in his life, had each of its six petals tinged with the purest bright red -
"Does anyone have anything to add or maybe want to change in the plan?" Thor asked, swinging the weight of his ax in his hands.
“That's what I’d do, sweetheart.” He smiled fondly.
Or maybe it was when he realized that he couldn’t live without Steve soon after they fought in Siberia and Steve was gone away.
Steve ran a hand through his hair, then his face, and ended up resting his chin on his hand. He was watching Tony as if he were seeing him for the first time. “How was it when you woke up?”
Steve's car keys were on the kitchen island. So, why not go to the police station and surprise Steve and enjoy getting to know Peter a little better? People didn't call Tony a genius for nothing. Before leaving, he took an apple from the refrigerator, ran his hands over the car key and left quickly, before Steve could return and spoil the surprise.
Diverting from a left-handed onslaught, Steve rolled forward of Cerberus and positioned himself defensively, with the shield in front of his body. The three heads of the infernal dog turned to him.
“Just you and me.”
“Friday, I'm still not sure what time it is...”
“Tony?”
"And we'll need it," Steve sighed wearily. "I just didn’t want to make it a feast for TMZ.”
"Do you want to stay here?" Steve asked without thinking. It just left, and then, when he really stopped to think, he didn't regret it. Tony looked at him for long seconds. Steve scratched the back of his neck, uncomfortable. "I mean, you don't have to spend on hotels. We have a very comfortable guest room here and it'll be our way of paying our share for your services," he tried to smile.
My tears have come and gone
"Good you both realized it in time.”
Strange frowned and looked at Tony suspiciously. “First, that person would have to have inhaled an enormous amount of pollen, an amount that I can't even imagine within a human's system.”
do you mean the same Natasha that I'm thinking of?"
“Steve...” Tony's voice was just a whisper.
The family is finally reunited (even more than it looks like)
Tony and Steve got out of the car, grabbed their suitcases in the trunk, and walked to the plane. Tony stood with one foot on the first step of the ladder.
Tony opened his mouth, but no words came out.
Tony didn’t understand. Then he dropped his hands to his sides and faced Steve. Looking at him was like being punched in the stomach and wanting to repeat the experience. It was beautiful and suffocating. Perfect enough to hurt.
Tony was already half-hard and he just wanted the time to stop, the world to stop, the universe to stop, and only he and Steve to remain.
"I got a warning from the Lincoln Center that the entire complex was emptied." Vision, besides Clint, removed a headset from his head. "For safety.”
"Like our fr..." Thor started to say, but Natasha interrupted him.
Steve laughed, but soon later they were silent again. They stayed there like that for a while, just enjoying the coffee, the view and the proximity of each other. For Steve, happiness would have that image as a definition when he looked in the dictionary, with Tony still sleepy, but with his fast and acid humor as always, flirty like never before, because now Steve knew it was all true, with no layers, no doubts, with his soft and warm body glued to Steve’s, allowing Steve to love him and show him how Tony was essential.
"Isn't that what I'm doing
Peter frowned.
“One of the countless dimensions of the Multiverse, Captain. As Sorcerer Supreme, I am needed there.”
“Relax, little Witch,” Clint replied. "We have everything under control.”
“We leave in thirty minutes.”
“Yes, sir.”
“Talk to me, Tony.”
“Yes, I did.”
Tony opened his mouth, but no sound came out. Did Steve pay attention to
Tony hooked his fingers on Steve's belt, pulled him close, and pretended to pout.
Tony was breathing fast, his heart was pounding in his ears, and he felt dizzy. Steve said he wanted to see Tony. That was good, right? But he hadn’t left Tony much of a choice.
was.” Tony blew out a heavy breath. “So, I don’t know, but I like to think that, before I really erased everything, I thought about what
“We only have one more fight,” he said, wetting his lips with his tongue.
"Come on, Steve, it's not every day we celebrate one hundred years old.”
“As you might imagine, if you’re following the timeline, a few days after Urich’s visit to my office, you died. After that, the Skrulls came and, with their defeat, came the distrust in me and the arrival of Norman Osborn on the scene.” Tony sighed, thinking about what it must’ve been like to deal with that maniac. Tony didn’t mind not remembering that. “He was responsible for pulling the trigger on the gun that killed Skrull Queen right in the middle of Central Park, in front of dozens of cameras, which broadcast him on national television as the hero the country needed ... the hero I wasn’t. For all these reasons, he found himself in the position of savior of the world, and took the opportunity to present the government with a plan apparently better than what we had, and introduced himself as someone more
"Maybe I understand better than I’d like this whole thing of admire from afar."
Peter jumped out of the chair and with a cry of "yes!" hugged Tony, almost knocking over coffee in everything.
“Sir?” Jarvis called after some time.
Sometimes Tony hated Steve's perfection and his ability to know exactly what to say to break all of Tony's barriers.
Steve looked back.
who can help me.”
“Sir, your heart rate is faster than normal, as well as your body temperature. Your blood pressure is worryingly high. And, as far as I can see, you have a painful headache.” Jarvis seemed too concerned for an AI.
Tony smiled.
Steve ran a hand through his hair, then his face, and ended up resting his chin on his hand. He was watching Tony as if he were seeing him for the first time. “How was it when you woke up?”
Tony clapped his hands, but the reasons were so varied that he could barely contain the excitement. "Glad we cleared things up, Steve. You know, I wanna be your friend. I mean, when this is all over. I think we can get along. And I don't want us to start a relationship without knowing the basics about the other."
With great willpower, Steve placed Tony on the floor beside him, sat on his heels, and ran his hands through his hair. “Tony, this is craziness. How can you think that I'm the solution to… well, to
“Dr. Richards and the rest of the Fantastic Four are off the planet at the moment. You are my last resort.”
“I could draw it all, you know?” Steve kept talking. “This pale and dull night, with nothing exciting going on. I know that most people would find this night boring. Apathetic.” Steve lowered his head and his gaze locked directly across the street, on the roof of the building opposite, the one with the chimney, right where Tony was trying to hide in the shadows. The display, was still with the zoom on Steve’s eyes before Tony could adjust his lenses and the view was breathtaking. Two blue circles, bright and alive, staring at him, seeing inside Tony, reading his thoughts, knowing his location, knowing his fear. Those eyes knew the way to Tony’s soul. They always knew, long before everything fell apart. They knew how to read every bit of Tony, every half-hearted smile, every half-truth, every joke made because he felt uncomfortable, every sincere conversation, every feeling. Well, maybe not all of them. Tony may have been able to hide a feeling, keep just a little bit of his own self to himself, a piece that Steve never managed to reach. And maybe that way was better for everyone. Especially for them. Steve blinked and Tony adjusted the lenses, framing his face again. Steve had one side of his mouth slightly pulled up, almost a smile, but still not sure if he could really let it out. “But most people are sleeping. So, what do they know about this night, am I right, Tony?”
~~~~~
“And how are you?”
And, if you don't mind, I believe it would be better to discuss this in person, here at the precinct," the Chief paused. "Maybe you would want to bring a lawyer when you come," and without saying anything else, he hung up. Like that. Cold-blooded.
“Steve?” Tony called, forcing his legs to move toward the other. “Steve, talk to me.” Tony sat on the other chair and looked at his husband. Steve was glazed in the other room, as if hypnotized. Tony held his face in his hands and turned to face him.
Tony looked at his room and grimaced.
Tony snorted, taking the cup. “Damn super serum that took that joy from you.”
"It's just not as amazing as seeing two fucking Furies whirlwinds unconscious to the ground," Clint said, laughing.
"Do you know what others are?" Steve asked.
“We detected an unusual source of energy coming from there,” Steve replied. “Natasha, Thor, Vision, Clint and Sam went to investigate, but we haven’t talked to any of them since we went out to face the Doombots.”
"Thank you for bringing my shield, Nat," Steve smiled at her.
“You don't have to run.” Steve said with a sigh, taking off his helmet and getting that messy hair that Tony loved so much. “This is what I was trying to say.”
“A penny for your thoughts,” Steve said after taking a sip from his coffee.
“Who?” Tony asked and it was possible to hear explosions in the background. "You're not talking about Parker, are you?"
"We're here." Nat announced, opening the door to the oriental restaurant they had chosen for that night.
Steve nodded, panting as well.
“Peter missed the final tests because Spider-Man was on a mission with the Avengers. But Peter Parker was hospitalized because of a pneumonia. I myself took the certificates signed by the hospital doctors to the school to get Peter to take the tests at a later date.”
"It's your turn to bet," she said.
"Have a good trip, and when you least expect it, you'll be back."
Reluctantly, wanting to keep looking at his cup forever, Tony looked up, meeting Steve’s gaze.
"Yes. You're going to run into a hallway and three doors. One of them is a bathroom. Choose the room you want.”
"Are you
When he finally turned around, Tony pulled the air so hard into his lungs that his chest hurt. It was the most beautiful sight Tony had ever seen ... in his life. Perhaps it overcame the day when the Avengers found Steve frozen in the Arctic. They weren’t friends that day, they didn’t know each other as they did now. This was different. Looking at Steve was like looking at the sun after hours in the dark. It hurt and it was glorious. It made Tony’s eyes sting, but he couldn’t look away even if someone forced him.
"What do you think, Steve?" Nat asked, unaffected, making Tony choke and cough a few times. Steve tried to reach him, but Tony pushed him away. He didn't need Steve that close at the moment.
With a crash and a flashlight, the four heads fell. Thor and Steve landed next and Tony realized that they had done their "Vibranium Hammer" move when Thor simply hit Steve's shield with an extremely strong bolt of lightning and everything around was destroyed by impact. Fast and efficient.
Steve stood up, smiling, still red-cheeked.
"Looks like we're being attacked by... giant-legged snakes?" Peter ventured, looking at the holographic screen projected by the table in the center of the quinjet.
"What if they're already there?" Sam asked, taking off with the aircraft.
didn't work?” Tony made a flourish with his hand, pretending to cast a spell in the box's direction.
“Move, Steve,” Tony demanded in a whisper.
Tony gasped and it took him a few seconds to get back to normal. That story had taken a completely unexpected turn. Pepper had been his and Steve's surrogate belly on the other Earth! How to react to that?
Tony looked at him and smiled. “Have you ever looked at yourself in the mirror?”
“What happens now? What happens when we decide to leave here and face the world outside?” Tony turned his face away and listened to Steve’s heartbeat, amazed at the perfection with which he fit every curve of Steve’s body, ecstatic that they were halves of each other.
“Please, finish with my undersuit. I kinda need you
Tony thought, his whole body responding to the kiss. His hands flew over to Steve's hair, his fingers wrapping around the soft locks, and pulled the soldier closer, holding him just as Tony was being hold.
“I just don’t see why so much firepower. It's the A.I.M.! Why so much effort?”
“Thinking. I can hear you thinking. Thinking
Steve lost the strength of his legs and fell to the floor, but he felt no pain. Only nausea and emptiness. No, no,
“Got it, boss,” Tony jumped in Friday's voice. He blinked several times, regaining his focus.
"If I beat you, you give me one of your weekends."
Please, I-I...” Steve was a mess of beautifully incongruence and Tony kept teasing his entrance. Without warning, he slipped one finger inside Steve, making the soldier throw his head back and open his mouth in a silent cry. Tony thrusted his finger a few times and then added the second, never stopping jerking Steve's cock.
“At the energy core, sir. A prototype discarded from the arc reactor,” an image of the inside of the gun appeared on Tony's interface, showing the exact location of the energy core.
“What?” Fury was offended. “Of course not, for God's sake. What do you think I am? Some homophobic asshole?”
"It's a very big animal and full of conflicting thoughts," she said, her voice flawed. "Making him sleep drained me a lot of energy.”
He was exhausted. The flight hadn’t been pleasant, not at all comfortable, and his whole body was sore, and Tony knew that much of his dissatisfaction was simply because he didn’t want to be there.
Tony thought,
But that's not true.
“Really.”
Tony held up his hands. “Start from the beginning. What the hell are you talking about, what do you mean Pepper called
Steve nodded, hesitant. “Okay.”
Slowly, Vision loosened the grip on the girl's neck and placed her back on the floor, but continued to hold her hands firmly behind her body. All care was little with those beams of energy.
“Like
Tony swallowed.
He swallowed. "I ... I'm going to see my son."
As if coming out of a trance, Steve focused on Tony's face and their eyes met.
“Fine.”
“Nothing,” Tony replied quickly. “I mean, we're not going to hurt you. You yourself said you inherited the best of us.” He waved his hand between himself and Steve. “We want to see it working. It will be fascinating.”
didn't do that, obviously.” Tony put his hand on Doctor Strange’s shoulder. “I told you that we could trust Captain America to keep his promise not to open the box.” He opened his best magazine cover smile. Theoretically, Tony wasn't lying. Steve hadn't really broken his promise to the good Doctor. Steve never opened the box or touched the flower. It was always Tony. Tony opened the box for the first time, Tony took the flower out of there, then opened the box again so that Steve could see and smell the flower ... But Steve himself? He never opened the box, so promise kept, and Captain America maintains his good reputation, thank you very much.
“What?” Tony didn’t think he heard it right.
“Yeah, I know, but settle down. We take care of everything here. It's only four days, Tony. Just worry about signing your contract and coming back.”
Steve rested his head on Tony’s and they shared the same air. They kissed deeply and Tony allowed himself to enjoy the electricity running through his body. Steve’s lips were warm and soft, sticking Tony to the present, reaffirming that it looked like a dream, but incredibly it was happening. His body was a fortress. That body belonged to Tony’s love. Steve
"Do you think the world already knows about us?"
“Please, is this some joke?” Tony could not contain himself.
Steve laughed. “We have a chance to start over, Tony. I can leave the past behind, where it really belongs. And you can start over, even with your second-hand memories. Learn from experience. It’s not just because you have lost the original memories that you can’t learn from what happened, that you can’t feel anything about it. But allow yourself to move on,” Steve smiled.
Then Tony felt wrapped in a pair of arms, which wrapped around him knowing that they wouldn’t be pushed aside. On the contrary, they were very necessary. It was a warm, soft and firm haven, able to protect him from all dangers, even those that Tony created for himself, steadying him to reality, bringing him back, comforting him. He didn’t deserve that. The smell of clean clothes and Steve, the scent that only he had, permeated Tony’s senses, making him dizzy, thirsty and with a racing heart. He was hyper alert, about to explode, and having such a concentrated dose of Steve at that moment could lead to unexpected and dangerous reactions.
Tony. “How are you?”
"Bonjour, Monsieur Stark.”
“Yes.”
“You’re screaming,” Steve said, taking Tony out of his daydreams.
Tony blew up the security door that closed the elevator shaft and reached the roof like a bull, ready to hit whoever was trying to break into his Tower, his home.
“You'd better not eat all the pickles,” he told Clint, looking at him from above.
Huh. The conversation was taking a totally unexpected turn, but one that Tony liked. "The second reason that made me want to come and get you alone was because I wanted to know your side of the story. Tell me, Peter, what's going on?"
"I'm always presentable, Pep.”
Tony looked away from the tablet and looked at Fury, who was still talking, but now the image behind him was of a fenced plain with a cow raising on it, but Tony had no idea what Fury was talking about. It could be about the next alien invasion or it could be about the best milking techniques. It'd have the same effect on him. Tony nodded thoughtfully, as if he were seriously considering whatever Fury was talking about and looked back at the tablet.
“Yeah, yeah, I know.”
Steve shrugged.
Tony sat up straight.
Tony looked at him through his long lashes and snorted in exasperation. “You can’t expect me to stand looking at you all dressed up after you tell me all these things.”
"Yeah, you get the perfect height up there." He moved enough to stand between Tony's legs, which wasted no time and stuck Steve between them.
“And you still say you're a business man.” Steve shook his head and moved toward the quinjet, leaving Tony behind.
“Not even a little.”
“How can you be so kind to me?” Tony practically shouted. “You just heard me say that I took advantage of the Civil War, that I lied to you, to our friends, to the press, that I let them think you were the villain. Damn it, I let them kill you!” Tony felt like a scratched vinyl, repeating the same thing over and over, trying to get Steve to come to his senses, that he finally understood the seriousness of Tony’s words, that he finally kicked Tony out of that apartment, damn it, that he finally expelled Tony from his whole life, but no matter how many times Tony repeated it, Steve continued to ignore him, and worse: he kept bringing him closer, preventing him from leaving, from being guilty.
” Tony was one step away from complete nonsense. Steve had found his prostate and with each push he took Tony to the stars.
“Not yet. Tony?” Steve called. No response on the comms. “Thor? Anyone copying?” Steve's heart sped up. “Tony? Tony, say something!” He stared at Sam and Natasha. “Their locators. Try to find them,” the two Avengers rushed to the quinjet and Steve faced Clint. “Prepare a dampening arrow and stay alert. Hulk, the same for you, eyes open,” Steve looked up frantically looking for some sign of red and gold motion in the dark sky. “Come on, Tony, where are you?”
Tony sat on the high bench that Steve indicated was his place and Steve sat across from him on the other side of the island after placing some cookies between the cups. They were both silent for what seemed like eternity, and all Tony could do was face Steve openly, without any shame.
Tony never took a shower so fast and so long in his life. As anxiety took over every cell in his body, he wanted to make sure that every piece of skin had been cleaned and no trace of the Furies was on him.
Tony’s mouth watered with the tempting proximity and took another bite of his slice. Steve's gaze flew to his mouth and returned to his eyes.
my memories to
Peter looked up when he heard the door open and Steve's heart broke a little more with the light that took over his son's features when he saw him arrive. He didn't deserve to be received with that joy, with that hope. He had nothing to offer. But still, Peter needed him. He needed him to be anything,
“I think that’s why Peter began calling us the Avengers’ Mom and Dad,” Tony said, taking a sip of coffee.
Tony swallowed. But what was the point of hiding things? Steve would find out sooner or later. Let it be through Tony’s mouth, then. “They did,” Tony confirmed and saw Steve close his eyes, disappointed. It hurt. “Apparently, I manipulated some of the Civil War events and the Registration Act to increase the value of my companies’ shares and profit more from all of that. Sometime days before you went to trial, Ben Urich came to my office and told me that he had discovered everything with Peter’s help.”
“Where you are from?” Sam asked.
As they headed for the police station, Tony stood on the phone with a person named Pepper, explaining Peter's whole situation, and trying to get her to help straight from Tony's office in New York. Steve tried to keep silent as much as he succeeded in, just paying attention to the conversation that, in a way, concerned him too, but even if he bragged before he knew most of the technical terms of advocacy, his brain almost overheated in the few miles between his house and the police station. When Steve turned a corner and then turned left again, he could see the police station just ahead, at the end of the street, and nudged Tony's arm, pointing to him their destiny approaching.
Spent my time so foolishly
“Of course, I am.” Steve shrugged, suddenly shy.
“Aye, Captain.”
"Yes, Captain," the android's robotic voice answered.
"And it looks like we have company." Steve blinked, returning to reality with Tony's voice, sounding almost too low, too sympathetic, without the note of intelligent sarcasm that Steve was already beginning to perceive as a characteristic of the lawyer. Steve looked to where Tony was pointing and felt his stomach sink and twist into a painful knot. The press was there. At least four channels, with their vans, cameras and reporters, holding their microphones as if they were melee weapons, capable of injuring as much as any other weapon.
Or was Steve talking about something Tony hadn’t seen, so he didn’t even have to worry?
The girl shrugged and smiled.
“Thor?” He called, tapping the comms. “Thor? Where are you?”
Who was Tony trying to deceive? He was in front of the person who knew him best, perhaps more than Tony himself. Steve was fluent in the Tony Stark language. It was impossible to hide things from him for a long time.
Tony swallowed. He remembered everything, then. Well, Tony was never good at hoping. He was never the optimist. That role has always been Steve’s. Tony snorted.
"But waiting too long sucks." Clint said, falling into the chair next to Nat.
, darling, but that doesn't stop me from enjoying the moment with the one I desire the most in the world, does it?” Tony tightened his grip enough to make Steve scream a delightfully
The butterflies in Tony's stomach came to life.
"But you did when you two arrived, didn’t you?" Clint commented, looking at Ares's scorched body.
Tony smiled at her, a smile full of his deepest love, despite all the pain of that situation and gave her one more hug. He felt another pair of arms, larger and stronger, around them, and saw Steve covering them, before hearing the fatal words from him.
“I should’ve known when it was time to stop all that nonsense when all I could think about was you, if you were okay, if you were eating, if you were sleeping.” Steve paused. “If you could still smile in the middle of that madness.”
Tony steadied in the air a little above the Scientist Supreme and raised his arms, pointing his repulsors straight at his chest.
"If I win, you'll give me a whole weekend with you alone, without lab, without Tower, without Friday, with nothing. Just you and me somewhere.”
“What will we do, sir?” Jarvis sounded concerned and Tony felt a rush of affection for the AI.
Or maybe it was when he thought Steve had turned into dust too, and Tony would never be able to say that he was sorry for everything and that none of that was worth it.
Tony felt Steve's tongue on his lips, anxious and demanding, and, without hesitation -
Tony’s hands came to life and were on Steve’s shoulders and back, marking his smooth skin with his nails, his mouth leaving hickeys on his neck, feeling everything he could from that man to whom he had given his heart and his soul.
Tony hoped he could leave that room with Steve and go somewhere private, preferably his room, or Steve's, he didn’t care for exclusivity in that sense, but instead, Fury made a point of talking to Steve and Natasha after the meeting and Tony got a call from Pepper, as if she knew exactly what time Fury would finish speaking.
“I don’t deserve you, Steve,” Tony spoke softly, defeated and tired.
“I'm all ears, Strange.” Tony was already losing his patience with so much mystery. “Spit it out.”
Tony stopped with his egg-filled hand halfway to his mouth and looked down.
"She's right," Sam confirmed. "There's a person in the fountain, but I can’t say whether it’s conscious or not. I can’t take Redwing from here without drawing much attention.”
Tony jumped back to the surface and met Natasha's gaze, incisive, accusatory, and at the same time sympathetic, if that was possible.
“Where are you coming from, Liz?” Natasha asked in the other room. Tony and Steve turned to listen.
“And why didn’t that make the front page of newspapers?” Steve asked and Tony cringed when he heard the acidity in his voice. Steve was disappointed. No. Disappointed was an understatement. Steve was hurt, and Tony agreed with him, but he just couldn’t feel the remorse he should have. The memories that were supposed to make that happen weren’t there.
Steve smiled shyly.
"Smiling," Tony replied, looking sideways at Steve.
They returned home without Peter.
"Mr. Rogers, there is no mistake. It was Peter himself who gave me your number as an ...
Steve frowned. “Forgive you for what?”
"You're still too dressed, Stark," Steve said softly, his voice more husky than Tony had ever heard. His mouth watered.
Tony let the weight of his body fall slowly on Steve, who didn’t protest, and slid his hand under the pillow to entwine his fingers on the soldier’s, who smiled.
They all got up and started to get off the plane toward the Tower, all exhausted and unworried to talk. Tony took Steve's arm.
Steve shrugged.
Tony swallowed and took another sip of coffee.
He managed to smile and drank the rest of the whiskey he still had in his glass, trying to swallow the lump as well.
“Already on it, sir.”
Tony shook his head, tears falling again. No, he was no good. Nobody good needs to erase their own memory after having helped install chaos. Tony was a weed, a cute plant, but one that can destroy everything if not controlled.
"I'll remember that next time."
"Are you alright?" Tony asked quietly beside him.
show up when you want to. You don’t have to wait for me to call or, I don’t know, be scared or anything.” Tony zoomed in on Steve’s face and, wow, Tony was surprised by the expectation there. Steve really expected Tony to reveal himself. Steve knew that Tony was scared. Damn, he knew Tony too well. Did he know about Tony’s memory loss? But Tony just couldn’t move to get even an inch closer to Steve. He wanted, his heart wanted, but his brain kept reminiscing about their recent history and Tony just stood there, unable to say anything, to do anything but cry, frustrated, because life was unfair. Steve wanted Tony to go there. It was that simple.
“No, I don’t know. But you didn’t know it either, Tony. The next time you arrive at such a crossroads, trust me. We work better
, the great Doctor Strange, come
How far would the absurdities go in their lives? Was there a limit they hadn’t yet reached? Or had they already gone beyond the absurd line long ago?
“When you land, I need you to send Bruce to the lab and you and Tony come straight to the interrogation room.”
"You must be amazing for her to personally send you," Peter said to Tony.
"May I know how you got here?" Rhodes asked when they were already outside the police station.
“Claiming the Earth as part of the ‘new Olympus’," Thor made the quotes in the air. “He and Hades were together in this scheme. I asked Heimdall to find Hercules, and he will be here soon to carry this loutish to have the judgment he deserves.”
“We are. But her parents aren’t.” Steve said and Tony realized how that situation was affecting his husband. His blue eyes were distressed and his chest rose and fell rapidly, uneasy. If Tony had to bet, he would say that Steve was giving his all to hold not only Tony inside the room, but himself.
“I know I was there; I saw myself on the scenes. But it’s like I’m not there either,
“Reliving?” Tony felt his brain working frantically. “Did you go back in time?”
“Isn’t it obvious?” Tony looked at him, giving Steve a quick peek over his naked body, and he looked hurt.
“Start where you think it’s easier,” Steve said, bending down to pick up his own underwear, lying on the floor nearby, and putting it on.
“It seems that the Scientist Supreme has set up a jigsaw puzzle, boss. The weapon was produced with parts from A.I.M., Hydra, Hammer Industries... and Stark Industries.”
“Can we start?” Natasha asked, her voice reverberating through the small room where they were.
“He fell from a considerable height and was bewildered. I took my chance.”
“Tony!” A groan of frustration was very close. “Friday, turn on the lights.”
"But I'm going to
Steve?”
Tony swallowed. Certainly, Steve could talk more, couldn’t he? Tony thought about what he could say to postpone that part of the conversation. He wasn’t ready.
Tony swallowed. “And what’s causing all this, Jarvis?”
“Why did you stop?” Tony was startled by his own breathless voice, and they weren’t even completely naked yet. Steve’s power over him was surreal.
“No.”
"And you did it?" Steve felt Peter staring at him, but he didn’t look back. "Have you faced your problem?"
"No," Tony replied, his face tucked into a design for a new suit for Wanda, by the time she came back.
Natasha crept through the late-afternoon shadows that the monumental buildings protruded into the square and positioned herself.
“Yes, sir?”
Tony.”
"So no red, white, and blue in the decor?"
Tony looked deep into Steve’s eyes and he felt his eyes wide with panic. “You’re right. My goodness, you’re right. I’m the man stuck in the past. I ...” Steve raised his eyebrows and waited. “I became you,” Tony said in a choked whisper.
Steve held up their hands, still entwined, up to eye level.
Tony shrugged, as if it was nothing, but inside, his heart was racing and everything else had turned to jelly. “I can be very persuasive.”
Steve groaned loud, holding Tony’s waist hard. “Fuck yes, Tony. Ugh, oh, yeah. Like
"Minus one, Steve. Minus one," Tony winked at him and turned, heading for a table, where a middle-aged woman was sitting at. Steve stood there, watching Tony walk away, while reliving the wink in his looping mind. His stomach followed the loopings and that was a welcome distraction after the press attack.
"Don't waste your precious time as a competent and wonderful associate commenting on uselessness, honey," Tony stood up and looked out over the window at the Boston view.
"Zeus would never allow such insanity," Thor said loudly.
"If you don't mind, I'd like to sing a song now."
“Thanks for asking me in, by the way,” Tony said, lifting his coffee cup.
"No need to ask twice, Spidey,” Hulk smiled and held Peter by his feet and threw him like a ball around the hydra. A few laps later, Spider-Man's super-tough web had gripped the monster's legs, knocking it to its knees.
Tony grunted.
“Let us help you,” Steve said.
"No problem, Mr. Stark," the investor stood up, finishing the meeting. "We'll meet tomorrow at eight, okay?"
“I made a bet with Steve on today's game,” Tony smiled. “And as I won, now I'm going to get my reward and I need your help.”
“We did it right, didn’t we?”
They ate in silence for a while, only with the sound of the waves outside framing the ambience. When they were finished, Steve collected the plates and glasses and put them into the sink. He stared at Tony.
With the two of them inside the elevator, the doors closed and the descent began.
"I brought it from the bedroom into the pocket of the robe," Steve said with a shrug. "Precaution.”
“I’m really glad you made it back.” Tony ended up saying, even though it was a silly and generic phrase, that didn’t even begin to express the flood of feelings inside him.
"I know, and that's why I love you."
"Now, now, good morning, Rhodey, my dear," Tony greeted with a petulant smile. "For how long did you think you could avoid me?"
Tony felt that a dam inside him had breached and now he just couldn’t suppress the flow.
Oh! Let me warn you: EXPLICIT CONTENT IN THIS CHAPTER! <3
Steve was without his helmet, so it was possible to see his face clearly now. So clearly that Tony could see his cheeks turning red at the answer.
“What is it?”
"Do you mind if I come down with you?"
Everyone looked at him.
"Right away." Sam nodded and took a flight followed by Vision.
“Thank you.” Steve smiled that smile that made his eyes narrow, making the corners crinkle. It was sincere.
“Yeah, something has changed, yes,” Tony said, his voice distracted, as he watched his fingers fade and appear through the golden strands of Steve’s hair.
"And what did she say?"
They stared at each other for long seconds, in silence, and for an instant, time seemed to freeze and everything was like before. They were best friends again, Tony could allow all the butterflies in the world to invade his stomach while Steve was around, they could share secrets by the direct line that their minds had with each other, and everything was perfect, nothing wrong was happening or had happened. Tony remembered everything. Steve had always been there, there had never been a war between them.
“No.” Tony shook his head, unhappy with his own carelessness. “I came because I wanted to.”
Tony stepped forward, leaving only a fair bit of air between them. Steve's breathing quickened.
He looked around and saw that Natasha had done a good job. Everyone had really come: the Fantastic Four was there talking to Carol Danvers, the X-Men had also come and were laughing at something that Vision and Wanda had told, Bucky had left Wakanda and was with Natasha in a quiet corner and Rhodes was introducing some UN secretaries to the Guardians of the Galaxy and to Hank Pym and his family. Everyone had glasses in their hands and the waiters were everywhere with trays in their hands, always full of food.
No. Tony didn’t see Steve die. He wasn’t there. “They shot you, they took tests. You were
Tony's thoughts were interrupted by the arrival of Peter, who looked exactly as a high school student should be, wearing sweatpants, a shirt two sizes larger than his, white socks, unkempt hair, and the wrinkled face of those who spent hours studying. Tony knew that expression well. He saw it every morning when he looked at himself in the reflection of some new equipment in the laboratory.
“Meet in two days in Dubai.” The voice of the Stark Industries CEO was friendly, but her tone was full of apologies. “They want you.”
“Vision?” Thor called, taking the android out of stupor.
felt all this oxytocin for Steve, I just never allowed myself to feel for real, and now that I can, I never want to deprive myself of the sensation.”
"Thank you, Thor." Tony nodded back.
Even in his condition, Tony felt a twinge in his heart. And it hurt. A dark light in the fog that overcame Tony. "Of course,
Tony looked out the small oval window and could see the mesmerizing blue immensity of the Atlantic Ocean beneath them.
The monster shifted and Tony realized, with panic, that it would crush Steve when it lowered its leg to regain balance and that the soldier wouldn’t have time to get out of there. Diverting from a head that invested against him, Tony flew at full speed, all his sensors focused on Steve.
Tony looked at Rhodes and smiled. "Well, that puts us back in the game. What do you think, then?"
babe, was never the flower.”
In the end, Tony wrapped himself in one of the clean towels left there by Steve and chose sweatpants and a red T-shirt, after all, Steve had told him to feel at home. And there is nothing more "feeling at home" than sweatpants and T-shirts. Tony dried his hair, and combed it with his fingers, letting it finish drying naturally. Without worrying about shoes, Tony left the room and went to find something to eat.
Steve took a sip and frowned.
His body immediately lit up at the thought of Steve. Steve, whom he had left miles away, when the two had finally admitted to each other what they felt, when they could finally begin to live the love that had always existed between them. It was so unfair.
Steve approached and Tony took a deep breath to control himself as he felt the soldier's warm breath on his ear.
Tony put his hand to his mouth and sent a flying kiss in her direction as Steve hugged him by the shoulders. She was going to be fine, Tony thought, she was strong, intelligent and extremely powerful. Nothing could hurt her. Except for an incursion.
"They have already worked together, Rhodes. He let out that he met her during a secret mission on which they worked together, but it was all classified."
“Tony?” Steve called. Tony blinked and looked at him. “Talk to me.”
"You should stop worrying so much, darling," Tony laughed. "He better listen to our mouths than the mouths of strangers, is not that what they say?"
The thought hurt. Imagining his life without Steve, with him dead, knowing he would never return, was one thing. Tony would suffer, but eventually he would learn to deal with pain and longing. But imagining his life with Steve alive, but ignoring him completely, despising him, never wanting to get close to Tony again after everything that happened? Tony couldn’t take it.
Tony swallowed. Certainly, Steve could talk more, couldn’t he? Tony thought about what he could say to postpone that part of the conversation. He wasn’t ready.
"We've reached the West portal," Tony announced. "We're beginning the attack.”
“It was probably the most painful scene I have ever seen. And look, I already had my share of painful scenes to fill about three lives.” Steve tried to make a joke, but his eyes staring at his hands that writhed nervously betrayed him. “I heard everything, over and over, until I memorized every word,” Steve said and Tony swallowed a gasp. “Now I know your reasons, your meeting with Arthur, your vision, that, even in the middle of the whole war you never drank once - and that made me
"Romanoff."
Steve pinched his nose and sighed. “Okay. First of all, you yourself, Stark said sex-pollen only works with our greatest passions and desires. And only the person we desire the most can take the pollen out. Besides, you wanna see something?” Steve looked up to the ceiling. “Jarvis?”
"We were so close. And we didn’t wake anyone.” And knowing it was a low blow, he bit his lower lip and stared at Steve, who swallowed.
"Okay," Steve was in automatic mode. Completely numb. They had his son's DNA at the scene of a crime, which was impossible, because his son wasn't a murderer. He needed to see Peter. Now.
Happy Holidays!
“If the other could sink the west coast of Canada, this one could sink half of Canada without any effort.”
Steve screamed and fell back on the pillows.
"Falcon, Iron Man and Vision, where are you?" Steve asked.
Tony took the mug automatically, but his attention was elsewhere, more precisely on the fact that Steve was wearing the underside of his uniform and an extremely tight blue thermal T-shirt that outlined every muscle in his chest, and
"The results of my finals are out, and Mr. Stark asked them to be delivered to him here at the Tower, instead of delivering to me," Peter explained. "If I got well, I'm still on the team. If I failed, goodbye Avengers.”
Steve took Tony's hands in his and placed them on his chest, close to his heart.
Friday.”
“Oh my, what was I thinking?” Tony facepalmed himself, sarcasm dripping from every word. “You're a Doctor, you need to give us your prescription on how to keep a box in a vault.”
“Could you run the tests you probably ran on Tony before to find out if the pollen has already left him?”
"And who are those friends?" Tony asked without changing his tone.
"Hi, Tony," Steve greeted sleepily.
Tony smiled without showing his teeth and looked at the reporters, who still hadn't realized they were parked there. "Okay, we're going out now," he looked back at Steve. "Do you remember when I said that the people inside that police station are like sharks just waiting to smell your blood to attack?" Steve nodded in agreement. "Well then. Those over there," Tony pointed to the reporters at the police station door. "They're the vultures, waiting for the remains that the sharks will leave behind. But don't let them fool you," Tony became serious, his features hardened and all the smoothness from before disappeared, giving way to a new aspect of the lawyer, which left Steve with goosebumps and with the certainty that this wasn't a look that he liked to see in Tony. "Those vultures over there won't think twice about attacking by surprise if it means getting fresh news to present on the evening news. If shattering you means a career bonus, they won't wait for the shark's remains. They'll eat you up, right here, outside. Got it?"
"Will you finally tell me where we are?" Steve stepped out of the car and Tony thought it was lovely to see the look of amazement marveling on his face staring out at the sea.
So important that I got here as fast as a human being would be able to get."
was.” Tony blew out a heavy breath. “So, I don’t know, but I like to think that, before I really erased everything, I thought about what
Tony came down the stairs slowly, trying to slow his own heart. He greeted some people on the way, waved away from others, and headed straight for the bar, non-stopping to talk to anyone in particular.
Fury looked at Tony for a few more seconds, and after convincing himself that the engineer was really paying attention, he went back to the new A.I.M. base.
Wanda gave a nervous laugh.
“Hi, Tony.” Steve smiled without showing his teeth and Tony thought he could melt in a puddle right there.
“They don’t know that,” Tony snorted.
"He keeps asking if he can come down."
“Did it work?” Tony didn’t move, but Steve could feel his heartbeat increased. He didn’t stop stroking Tony’s hair though.
Tony suddenly closed his mouth. That conversation was taking
“Take what you want,” Steve said, holding the hem of his shirt. “It’s all yours.”
“I know, my love. And I love you, too. More than I can tell.” Steve hugged him tightly and buried his face into the curve of Tony's neck, breathing in slowly and deeply.
Steve changed on the spot. A smile broke across his face, his expression softened and he raised an eyebrow. “
For a long time, Tony simply lay there, just feeling Steve’s body against his, his warmth, listening to his heartbeat, his steady breathing, indicating that he had fallen asleep. At some point, he started to think that maybe that could really be his life from now on. Then, with that thought warmed by Steve’s arms and love, Tony fell asleep entwined with the love of his life.
She knew that that had been a low blow, but they had to go back to the Compound. And get there preferably before a
They passed Natasha, who closed the door behind them, leaving the signal clear: there was no turning back. They stopped in front of the interrogation room door and hesitated.
Tony groaned loudly when Steve's knee brushed his groin. He let his head fall on Steve’s shoulder, and then Tony was pretty sure he really needed it. “Do ... do that again, Steve,
- he’d be able to solve everything by himself. Most of the time, that plan only made everything worse. Steve needed to help him.
Tony ran a hand through his hair in frustration. “We could’ve solved all of our problems with a simple conversation.
“I have an incorrigible boyfriend.”
"Gwen." Peter blushed again. "Gwen Stacy.”
“It was probably the most painful scene I have ever seen. And look, I already had my share of painful scenes to fill about three lives.” Steve tried to make a joke, but his eyes staring at his hands that writhed nervously betrayed him. “I heard everything, over and over, until I memorized every word,” Steve said and Tony swallowed a gasp. “Now I know your reasons, your meeting with Arthur, your vision, that, even in the middle of the whole war you never drank once - and that made me
Steve frowned. "If you already know that, what do you still need to know?" He didn't understand. Wasn't that the crucial information there? Why the hell were they sitting around drinking coffee, like nothing was happening?
“Any tips on how to end this thing?” Tony asked.
"I was in the Army. I know most of these technical terms," Steve said rolling his eyes.
But what about Steve? How much did he remember since he was … since he died? Did he remember all the conversations, all the struggles, all the lies that seemed to be true? Did he remember every feeling, every pain, every betrayal, every stab? Did he still remember Tony?
Steve raised an eyebrow. "And what are we doing here?"
"Let's clean you up," Tony smiled as he wiped the towel over Steve's body, wiping away all cum and sweat.
” Tony surrendered. He knew that tone of voice. It was rare, therefore, very precious. That was the tone of voice Steve used when he was vulnerable and exposed.
Tony paused for a second.
He blinked a few times and focused his vision on the soldier's face, who was looking at him with an amused expression.
“They are the same person.”
“Yes, my parents: Tony Stark and Steve Rogers.” She smiled beautifully for a moment, delighting in the sound of the names she spoke with reverence.
"You make me want to be good," Tony finally said. "It's all for you."
The last community card was opened by Natasha, a beautiful three of clubs and Tony couldn’t be more pleased. With the new card, he now had a four of a kind, joining his original three diamonds plus the other three threes that were opened at the table. Chances were extremely favorable, which made him open the betting round by betting high, placing eight chips in the center of the table.
“I know.” Steve looked at him silently. “But I wasn’t there, was I?”
“Oh, really? Why?” Steve asked cautiously and tried to get more comfortable, still with Tony on top of him.
Steve could almost see the gears running through Liz's brain. According to what she had said, she had inherited the intelligence of the other Tony. If that was the fact, Steve knew she was carefully considering everything Tony had just said, and most likely seeing what even Steve saw: nothing here was as random as she thought.
“What did you call me?” Steve asked quietly, his eyes shining.
As if listening and waiting for the right moment, Natasha asked the girl another question.
"No, of course not," Tony finally replied. And then it was his turn to narrow his eyes. "Do you have a problem with that, Fury?"
Tony’s heart swelled. Steve was waiting for consent. If Tony told him to stop, Steve would stop and they would never talk about what happened there. Tony smiled, released his leg from Steve’s hand and leaned toward him, looking deep into his eyes.
“The coordinates were random,” Liz said quietly, but without much conviction.
"Oh," Tony felt his face heat up. "I'm sorry if I bothered you."
“I wish there was something I could say to you that day,” Steve said, his eyes glued to Tony, holding Tony in place. “I wish I could have said something that would make all that pain you let me see go away. It kills me a little every day, since that meeting, to know how you can feel this way, so worthless, so small, so
It was always
“I know you’re there,” Steve said, still in a low voice, as if to prove that he knew Tony had the means to listen to him. “And you’re dying to know how I know,” and the jackass smirked, knowing exactly what Tony was thinking.
“Fuck, Tony! That was- Oh, my. That was…” Steve panted.
Steve lost his breath again with the sweetness in Tony's expression and words. Did he remember what it was like to be taken care of? Could he let it? Tony grinned, looking at the door handle, encouraging. And Steve knew that yes, he would be able to let Tony take care of his family. And with that huge revelation, Steve turned the handle, opened the door and his heart broke into a thousand pieces.
Can you believe it?”
“Friday, who's at home?” Tony was at the foot of the Avengers Tower, in the car with Happy.
“It’s amazing how one experience can put all others in perspective,” Steve suddenly said, without looking in any specific direction, and Tony found himself freezing in place, afraid that not even his armor’s camouflage would be able to cover him up there. “On any other day, some time ago, I would’ve said that the night could be better, with less clouds in the sky, to be able to see the moon,” Steve continued in a soft, almost dreamy voice. “But now, after everything that happened, I just feel grateful to be here and to be able to see the sky exactly as it is.”
"Can’t be you? I don’t even show up around anymore.”
"Falcon, Spider-Man, get civilians out of the way," Steve commanded. "Hawkeye, Widow, attack the body and legs of the hydra. Thor, Hulk and Iron Man, attack the top of the monster and send it back through the portal as quickly as possible.”
Still, Tony remained silent.
And fate had been very generous to them, bringing them a beautiful boy, whose parents had died in a tragic accident. Initially, the boy had been placed in the custody of a couple of uncles. Unfortunately, the same luck that smiled for Steve and Peggy wasn't so friendly with the boy's family, since the uncle died in a robbery and his aunt, already old, shortly afterwards, of natural causes, leaving the boy alone.
"So what are you doing here, asking me these things?"
"Hulk, the right leg is mine," Thor shouted cheerfully, striking a lightning bolt on the right foot of the hydra.
“I’m really glad you made it back.” Tony ended up saying, even though it was a silly and generic phrase, that didn’t even begin to express the flood of feelings inside him.
"After I bought this island and built this house," Tony began, "I realized it wasn’t a place to bring any person." Tony ran his fingers through Steve's hair, who closed his eyes and made a noise of pleasure. “It wasn’t the place to have a party for friends and even less a place for one night stands” Tony paused. “I realized that it was a special place and that I would only bring here who really was important, who really was worth it.” Steve opened his eyes and they faced each other. “I would only bring here someone I
"Then why are you sitting in your closet talking to me when you could have left ten minutes ago for your trip with your boyfriend?" Friday asked.
Out of the corner of his eye, Tony saw that Steve walked over to the bed on his left and sat on the edge, his hands crossed on his legs, his back straight and his gaze fixed on Tony. Tony didn’t move and continued looking at the void, but paying full attention to Steve.
Steve sighed. "I'm sorry about that. He doesn't usually behave like that," and headed for the kitchen.
“They were amazing,” Liz said. “They've thought about everything to make me feel good.”
“I am.”
wanted you." This was another level of desire.
handle the idea of touching me, would he? Even more after seeing me like this, debauched, in a deplorable state,
"Damn," he said when he realized that none of the missiles had penetrated the monster's thick skin. “Plan B.”
"Okay, the chat's fine, but I'm going to bed." Clint got up and stretched his arms over his head. "I need a shower and some quiet time”
"Coming," Sam said, "only more thirty seconds, Cap.”
Steve rolled his eyes and took a sip of his own mug.
"I love you, Tony," Steve said, afraid that all of New York could see his smile.
You make me infinitely happy, and you make me complete because you let me see who you really are. In the crowd, your smiles are always bright and calculated. But I’m the only one who has the privilege of seeing your real smiles, the ones that reach your eyes, that make you shine all over. And I’m the only one for whom you let your tears show, without fear of being vulnerable, because you know that I’ll take each one as a gift of your trust in me and take care of you, forever. I’m the one who sees behind the perfect shell, because I love your imperfections.
"But here’s the thing, Rhodes," Tony said. "Natasha told me on the phone that her godson's DNA was planted at the crime scene and, even if she hadn't told me about it, let's call it her
Then Steve smiled. He managed to open the warmest smile, the one full of love and affection, the one that only Peter could take from him, and strode to his son, with open arms, so that Peter could see what Steve was actually doing there.
“But we could be,” Tony said with a hesitant smile, taking a step toward her.
Tony got to the lab breathing hard, sweating and feeling a tension build up inside him, just below his belly.
Tony shrugged. “I just did what you would’ve done for me.”
“Shouldn’t we clean up?” Tony asked, not really wanting to know, because he was amazed at the discovery of how perfectly he fit the curve of Steve’s neck, as if that place had been made for him.
They stopped and Tony realized that they had arrived at Steve's house.
Stamford.”
Steve ignored him and kept looking at Tony.
“What?” Steve couldn’t hide his disbelief.
“I didn’t want to go.”
"They were able to free themselves from the wicked clutches of Hades. He will also have the proper destination.”
"To be praised like that," Steve shrugged, took a bottle of olive oil and poured the vegetables, cubed them with parchment paper and put the mold in the oven. He turned to Tony and smiled the brightest smile since they met. "Thank you."
"No, no nightmare this time." He took a sip of water.
Walking in pairs on the narrow corridor, the Avengers followed Friday's directions until they found the access door.
Tony snorted and remembered in time that he needed to disguise, then coughed.
"Y-Yes, I do," Tony managed to sob.
“Captain, how's the sitch?”
“You gave me a purpose, you gave me a
"Bye to you all," Tony said loudly, catching the attention of all the Avengers present. "I'll see you in a few days. Until I come back, please do not destroy the Tower, behave as civilized people, anything you need, call Steve or ask Friday, and do not let the world be destroyed.”
Steve shrugged. “It’s no longer such a problem. It was worse in the first days. I couldn’t sleep, afraid of not waking up anymore, afraid of seeing myself trapped in that infinite again.”
"Well, children, I warned you that inviting me to play poker was a mistake." Tony put his cards next to the other five open on the table and smiled. "A four of a kind, lady and sir." He looked at the other two and laughed. Natasha's mouth was wrinkled in a grimace and Steve, oh, poor Steve, his mouth was open with shock, looking at the cards, unable to believe it. Tony didn’t resist and grasped the soldier's chin and raised his face gently to meet his eyes. "The expression you're looking for, Stevie, sugar, is
Steve shook his head. “No. I couldn’t change the past. I tried, but I couldn’t.” Steve looked away. “I could only go through all those events again and again and again, endlessly.”
"Oh, Stevie, sweetheart, what would be the fun of poker without the bets?"
, where they found him. As if they closed a cycle. Arriving in the Arctic that day, Tony felt himself the most selfish of men, but he just didn’t care. He wanted Steve all to himself, if only for a second, before he never saw his friend again. He wanted to be able to say what he hadn’t achieved during the funeral open to the public. He wanted to say what he had never said to Steve, but he should have. But even there he couldn’t.
Sorry, but I can't do it.”
Tony laughed out loud. "Pepper and me married? Never! She's my associate. And my secretary. And my best friend. And the closest to a family I have. But, no. Not my wife. By the way," Tony paused dramatically and looked at Steve sideways. "I'm not even married."
"And when was that?"
Even in that position, Tony was the one in charge. He kept thrusting his body against Steve’s, each time increasing the speed of his thrusts, up to the moment Tony’s body started tensing up, and Steve felt his hole clamp down on his cock.
"We can go in my car," Steve said, clearing his throat to get his voice out. They went out onto the porch and, while Steve locked the door, he noticed something that wasn't part of the decor.
“Thank you. I’m happy to be back,” Steve ate a cookie and was thoughtful as he chewed. “Do you know what I noticed while I was wandering?” Tony shook his head and waited.
They stared at each other for long seconds, in silence, and for an instant, time seemed to freeze and everything was like before. They were best friends again, Tony could allow all the butterflies in the world to invade his stomach while Steve was around, they could share secrets by the direct line that their minds had with each other, and everything was perfect, nothing wrong was happening or had happened. Tony remembered everything. Steve had always been there, there had never been a war between them.
“Stop,” Steve said, throwing the belt somewhere behind him.
“Come on, Tony, ask the questions you want to ask,” Steve said with a half-smile. “I told you, I didn’t ask you here to fight. I want to talk.”
“For what?”
“I already said it, because I wanted to.” Steve said quietly, without looking away.
"Hulk wasn’t following anyone. But now you gave Hulk a great idea.”
“Did you like it?”
“Come inside.”
"We're there in five minutes," Natasha said.
, would be enough for Steve to forget everything they had lived. Tony didn’t remember anything. Everything he remembered had been told to him. He didn’t remember what he had felt when he and Steve last met. He didn’t even remember his last thought when they last spoke. Tony didn’t remember when Steve had smiled at him the last time, or when they had fought together for the same cause the last time. Tony didn’t even remember what he felt when he last saw Steve. And that ate him alive. All his memories were second-hand, borrowed from people who didn't delete their own memories in a last attempt at redemption. In one last attempt to make Steve proud.
Steve had his head resting on the soft back of the sofa, his messy hair falling across his forehead; the eyes, with those incredibly long lashes, motionless, with no sign of dreams or nightmares; and with rosy lips slightly open and extremely inviting. His chest rose and fell calmly, and Tony tried to remember the last time Steve had been so calm and with such a
“Aren’t you?”
Tony blinked and felt his face heat up. He looked at his own cup and sipped his coffee. It was delicious. “I’m sorry. It’s just that I still haven’t gotten used to the idea of ...” Tony risked looking at Steve, who was looking back at him, waiting. Tony looked back at his coffee. “I still haven’t gotten used to the idea of having you back.”
Tony thought.
"Yes."
Steve shrugged. “Don’t judge yourself so hard. It wasn’t a mission or anything.” He suddenly stopped and looked sideways at Tony. “It wasn’t a mission, was it?”
“Oh.” Steve blinked. “So, what's it like for you?”
The worst that could happen was Tony leaving that night with one less friend. For the third time. It would be a record.
Why so fast?"
We became real friends. The best. We were the best leaders our team has ever seen. You trusted me. And I wish you could hear my heartbeat every time you got close to talk about that day's fight, about a new project that you were very excited about, or just to do nothing. You always chose to do nothing with me. And that was much more than I could have
The same reason that his self from some time ago confessed to Steve’s body after those shots on the stairway, when Tony asked for some time alone with him back at the helicarrier: it hadn’t been worth it. If the cost of defending an idea was to lose his best friend, the person Tony most admired and loved in this and all worlds, then he was not willing to pay. And he wanted to make sure it never happened again. Never.
However, we are talking about the Avengers, also known as “those for whom Murphy's Law was created.” If something could get out of control that was certainly what would happen.
He stood on tiptoe and kissed Steve's face.
Hey, everyone!
"I brought help," Steve said, stroking his son's hair.
“Despite that, we always managed to find reasons to argue,” Tony said thoughtfully.
Steve laughed.
"We haven’t heard from him. He asked Friday to not let anyone bother him.”
Tony held up the hand that didn’t hold the coffee mug. “Let me finish.” Steve closed his mouth and waited. “But I also really thought about what you said to me yesterday. About everything you said to me yesterday. And I can’t even think that you were lying. You don’t lie, Steve,” Tony struggled with the words. Those had to be the right words, because that was the most important moment. More important than the conversation the night before, than the moans of pleasure, more important than everything, because from then on, everything would change, for better or for worse. “You
Steve nodded in agreement. “Yes. We both lost.”
“Yes, it all happened, but long story short, only my body died, Tony.” A shiver ran through Tony’s body when he heard his own name being said by Steve. Would he get used to it again?
“We're working on the basis of ‘better safe than sorry,’” Sam commented.
Tony turned to Peter, who was looking out with an empty expression. "Hey, Peter," and when Peter turned around, Tony wished he were more than a lawyer, and that he could hug Peter, help him in ways that the laws can't. The boy's eyes were pure sadness and bitterness, feeling a guilt that wasn’t his. "I know it seems impossible, but you really need to be strong now. From the door out, you need to be a rock, an example of impassivity. If you want to fall, scream, be vulnerable, be it. But be it here inside your house. Let this be your sanctuary, together with your father. The world doesn’t deserve you, Peter. But you don’t allow this world to crush you," Tony put his hand over Peter's and squeezed it. It wasn't a hug, but it would do. "And I’ll be here to help you."
I apparently died.”
"Welcome to Dubai, Mr. Stark,” a man in a very well-tailored suit received him at the hotel door and showed him the way to the reception. "Have you had a good trip?"
Steve took a deep breath and smiled. He hadn't written his vows on a nice card like Tony. He just improvised, but it didn't take much effort. All he had to do was open his heart like never before, because this was a moment that wouldn’t happen again.
Tony activated the armor’s repulsors and, with a graceful leap, crossed the distance between the buildings. He stepped out of the armor and left it outside, as a sign that he, as well, hadn’t come to fight. And even if Steve wanted to, he had the right and necessary force, especially against Tony off the armor.
would’ve done in his place. It doesn’t look like much me to make all the sacrifice of modifying a ship, to put my only and beloved daughter inside, in order to, in the end, simply throw her in the multiverse, praying for the best. I’d do the complete job.”
That hurt. Tony didn’t think he could feel anything anymore, but he found he could underestimate his own feelings when it came to Steve.
Until a miracle happened and you came back to me. I gave you the space you needed, I gave you all the time you demanded, and I waited until you came to me and I swear my heart almost burst with happiness and relief when you came to talk to me.
“That's gotta be a joke!” Tony said angrily, stepping away from Steve, but without leaving his lap and without removing the soldier’s hands, which were now on his thighs.
“I doubt it very much.”
“Better.”
Tony shrugged.
"So I found out that we have someone forging evidences in the police. And Rhodes is the only one there that we can trust."
“But,” Steve continued.
Instead of start saying whatever she found, Natasha went silent for some moments. Tony’s leg was shaking. "Nat, are y-"
Tony stopped laughing and looked at him on the other side of the island. Steve was serious again and Tony felt a cold chill run through his entire body. But it wasn’t the good kind of shiver. Suddenly, all of Tony’s senses were alert.
Tony thought. He looked around, and he was still hugging Steve, who slept peacefully with his head bent over the back of the chair. Tony smiled slightly.
Tony suddenly closed his mouth. That conversation was taking
a more friendly little voice helped. Tony smiled.
With all of Strange’s warnings out of his mind, Tony came over to smell the flower with a deep breath. And it was delicious, invading Tony’s senses like an explosion. The scent was delicate at first, soft and sweet, but soon after it was replaced by a stronger, yet a very strange one for a flower: the smell of soap, followed by clean clothes and another one that Tony was unable to concentrate enough to identify. He was still involved in the red light emanating from the flower, and his limbs were numb, but surely that was the effect of being on his knees for a long time, right? His head, before so calm, was spinning, lots of thoughts flooding his mind, making it overflow and lighting into Tony something primitive and urgent.
"She told me that I should take good care of you or I would regret it," Tony said with a raised eyebrow. Steve laughed through his nose, but felt his heart double in size for Natasha.
Tony sighed. That War would never have come this far if they hadn’t taken sides. If both had moved away, perhaps things would have worked out differently. Perhaps. Perhaps. Perhaps.
“I can take care of that, Captain,” Thor said, taking the lead. He lifted his ax, drawing a lightning from the sky and holding it to the metal like a torch.
"Are we still talking about our nights off?" Tony asked.
“Do you have any more coffee?” Tony asked. “Or something stronger? I don’t know if I’ll be able to tell you all this dry.”
That feels so good.”
"The smell is great," Steve said in a slightly clearer voice.
“You guys had no problems I assume.” Strange said, taking the box from Tony’s hands.
With the coffee ready, Tony poured the boiling liquid into two mugs that he found in the cupboard over the sink, and went back to the bedroom, where Steve was still sleeping. Tony left Steve’s mug on the nightstand beside him, and went to the front of the huge window, admiring New York, already frantic. In fact, he had no idea what time it was, or whether anyone had looked for him, and to be honest with himself, Tony didn’t care. All that mattered was that bubble in which he was with Steve.
The dog was huge, at least sixteen feet high, and he was furious. But it was difficult to know exactly why. The left head seemed furious because Steve had hit the shield on it while the right head was furious because it had been prevented from continuing to attack Wanda, and the middle head was furious because it couldn’t participate entirely in any attack.
“Hardest for whom?” Natasha asked with a smirk, punching the Scientist Supreme, making him faint. She looked at Tony. “Your turn, genius.”
“What’s going on with you?” Steve asked softly. He couldn’t get it, but he wanted to help.
Tony smiled, he himself excited by the boy's excitement. "As tempting as the offer is, you’re already being accused of one crime. We don't want you to be accused of another, right?" Tony saw Peter's expression wither and he felt terrible. "Look, I know you really want to help solve your own case, but the best thing for you now is to be quiet at home, without making a fuss, okay?"
Tony heard himself screaming.
"Really, they
"Wanda, call his attention," Steve shouted. "Let's make him dizzy.”
Steve snorted. “Tony-”
Steve thought about what Tony had said. Of course, it made sense. Peter was being exposed because of him. And not in an slightly uncomfortable way, as you might expect being the son of someone with some reputation. He was being exposed in the worst possible way. And it was all his fault.
"Where are you going, Mr. Stark?" Peter asked from the couch in front of the huge TV where he, Thor and Hulk were playing Call of Duty.
“That I don’t have to lie anymore, that all that weight on my back can finally go. Because I know which path I must take and how I will be on it.”
"All right." Tony clapped his hands. "Everyone knows what to do. We'll meet up here later for the reports.”
Steve shook his head.
He slid the hand that was in Steve's hair to the back of the soldier's neck and pulled him. Without offering any resistance, Steve released Tony's hand and used his hands to hold the engineer by the waist while Tony nestled Steve's face in his own hands.
“Of course! What do you need, Captain?”
"I'm sorry, it's just ..." Tony struggled with the words. "Well, it's just, I never imagined you seeing other men."
Tony turned around and almost ask aloud, "don’t you agree, Steve?", but at that moment, Steve's hand was back on his leg, hot and unashamed, breaking into the few inches Tony's pants gave him access and he was no longer able to reason coherently.
“Pepper, she called me to help you,” Steve said.
"I thought you might like to know that a certain blue-eyed super-soldier is extremely impatient because he didn’t get any calls from you wishing him a happy birthday."
She smiled.
“Do not let them come closer!” A muffled, accented voice shrieked behind the lighted structure, and all the yellow agents responded to it advancing against the Avengers.
But soon reality drifted through the gaps of that precious moment, and Tony found himself again in Steve’s apartment, still without part of his memory, still trying to understand what he was actually doing there, what Steve wanted with him, why they hadn’t started fighting yet. He blew out a heavy breath. He felt tired.
“It's great. Now use these muscles and knead the dough with your hands until it forms a ball. When this happens, throw some flour on the counter and put the dough on the counter, without stopping kneading.”
"Firstly, that means we're going to take your son out of custody," Tony said with a smile.
Tony snorted. “I never got your message.”
Tony stood up.
Stephen Strange smiled crookedly in that enigmatic way only he could and that got on Tony's nerves. Whenever that little smile appeared, Strange's eyes became more mysterious, dark and impossible to read. He was extremely annoying, to say the least.
One of the vaults closest to the lab door was empty, so Tony decided to get rid of that weird box and put it in there.
“I burn people around me, Steve.” Tony felt like he was just presenting old facts.
“How’s everything there?”
Tony wanted to answer, because whenever he and Steve were together it was as if time stood still and only they two remained within their particular bubble sound and image-proof. The outside world simply disappeared when Steve was around because only what Tony could see was the soldier's perfection.
- I’ll let you do whatever you want, my love. Just don’t stop,
Tony smiled.
“Shut up.” Tony couldn’t believe it. Who the hell Steve thought he was to make jokes? “You've already made it very clear how you feel about it and that you can’t stand the idea of touching me. What could you possibly want here?”
Steve reached Tony's thighs and stroked them on the outside first, until he reached his calves and then went back up, but this time, from the inside, taking advantage of the position of his hands to spread Tony's legs, making room for Steve to settle there in the middle of them.
Tony hung up the phone and looked at the Avengers sat around the table.
“Yes, Captain?”
"I wouldn't be here if I didn't believe it," Tony said calmly. "But the police don't believe you and your DNA there complicates things a lot. But it doesn't make them impossible to be resolved. You just said you didn't know the boy. That's important. I'll start setting up your defense from there," Tony took out the notepad in the briefcase and started writing on it.
Tony shrugged. “Well, it won’t be overnight, of course.” He took a sip of coffee. “But, yes, why not?” Tony turned to face Steve, who was not wearing anything. The lack of modesty, no shame, Steve comfortable with Tony, just made everything clearer. Tony traced the line from Steve’s chest to his navel and smiled. “In addition, the package comes with some very interesting bonuses.”
“I’m sorry?”
The moment of dread was gone as quickly as it had surged when Tony looked up from his legs to scan the rest of the body to which those other strong, shapely legs belonged; the athletic torso, with perfectly shaped muscles, a map that Tony had begun to unravel; flawless chest, with nipples that Tony knew to be sensitive and that, if stimulated in the right way, could elicit groans and delicious sighs to hear; powerful arms that wrapped and protected Tony, holding him around the waist; and the most beautiful, adorable face, and that was synonymous with love for Tony.
With a sigh he couldn’t - and didn’t want to - hold, Tony tucked his face into the curve of Steve's neck and felt his fresh bath scent and Steve, and a shiver ran down Tony's spine. Steve came up and ran his hands up and down Tony's back, all the shame of a few minutes ago gone. He pulled away enough to kiss beneath Tony's ear, that inspired loudly and tightened his arms around Steve, who continued to leave a trail of kisses from the ear to the base of Tony's neck and then came back doing the reverse.
“I’ll be there with you,” Tony said, opening a shy smile. “I always had hope that you’d come back. But I never thought you would be able to make me confess that I’d do anything for you, that I’d give my heart to you, even though I didn’t think I deserve your love back.”
“With the skates,” Tony supplied.
“Any problem, Hocus Pocus?” Tony tried to divert the Sorcerer’s attention. “Oh, I’m sorry. My bad. Jarvis can show you the magician's restroom, if you prefer not to use the mere mortals’ one, don’t worry.”
"Did any of you see Thor? He's with Ares.”
“Yes, boss.”
Steve’s hands came to life and hugged Tony around the waist, but soon they went through everything they managed to reach, until he reached the hem of his own shirt that Tony was wearing and pulled it up, leaving Tony gloriously naked, but now under a completely new and hypnotic light. Steve slowed his own movements and Tony imitated him, until they were with their heads resting on each other, breathing hard, unable to look away from each other.
"No one can deny that, darling." Tony smiled the most beautiful of smiles, and Steve swore to himself that he would make Tony smile like that every day.
Tony heard himself screaming.
“Tony? I’m going to sit down now and bring you with me, okay?” Tony nodded slightly. Steve smiled. Nodding. Good sign. “Great. Come on.” Steve let his cock leave Tony, making both sigh, and put his arms under Tony’s to support him, helping him to sit on Steve's lap and laid Tony on his shoulder.
“Right away, Captain.”
dream." He shifted uncomfortably. "And I needed some water.”
But Tony's heart never slowed when Steve was around since he was a kid when his father told him the stories of the great Captain America and things only got worse when Tony met the real Captain, the man behind mask, Steve Rogers, the most amiable, intelligent, witty, righteous and strong man who ever lived.
Tony held up the hand that didn’t hold the coffee mug. “Let me finish.” Steve closed his mouth and waited. “But I also really thought about what you said to me yesterday. About everything you said to me yesterday. And I can’t even think that you were lying. You don’t lie, Steve,” Tony struggled with the words. Those had to be the right words, because that was the most important moment. More important than the conversation the night before, than the moans of pleasure, more important than everything, because from then on, everything would change, for better or for worse. “You

"Tell Peter we’re home and ask him to come up. Delete all the emails. Begin the tests with the stabilizer.”

But Tony could only look at Steve's smile and wish he knew how to make that smile stay there. At that time, the solution was to say 'yes'.
in this world. Only then will the pollen leave my body and allow me to be me again.” Tony carefully put the flower back in the box and closed the latch. He tried to get up and take the box back to the safe, but his legs failed, and Tony fell. “Soon enough, I’ll no longer look like myself. In a little while I’ll look like a wild animal in heat, but I won’t be able to do anything because it will hurt too much while I try to find a cure by myself.”
"Leave Ares to my care," Steve said with a wink. He released Tony and ran to his own room.
Steve looked at Tony with eyes full of pain. "But that's how I feel, Tony. Just like that. I should protect my son, look after him. Instead, he's spending the night in jail, accused of killing a schoolmate. What kind of a father am I if can't I protect my child from
The girl let out a heavy, sad sigh.
"She said no. That they were going to go through a lot already, and that they didn't need to know that Aunt Nat and Uncle Barnes were spies for an agency that, officially, doesn't exist."
“Quick, we only have fifteen seconds,” Tony said. Without waiting for further encouragement, Thor summoned his lightning and they began to rise, carrying the weapon with them.
Steve looked up to meet Tony's gaze and smiled.
"You didn’t have to come here," Tony said, getting up. "Friday was ready to wake me up.”
Before the soldier could say anything, Tony heard Natasha continue.
“Is it possible for us to feel something for her without ever knowing her?” Tony asked.
"Dammit, Nat. This is crazy."
What if ...
"I promised a weekend without communication with the rest of the world, but we're still in a house of mine, so I can’t promise zero technology, sweetheart.”
"...I always pay attention to what you do," Steve said and Tony noticed Steve's neck turning red. A shudder of satisfaction swept over Tony's spine, and he insisted on ignoring all six pairs of glances watching the scene. "Anyway, as I was saying, let's reverse it. Falcon and Iron Man take Hawkeye and Black Widow to the heads and hit the soft points of them: eyes, inner part of the mouth, ears, anything. Thor, Hulk and Spider-Man hit the legs and unbalance the hydra. Drop it and we'll send this thing back through the portal."
“So you're not even gonna give us a chance?” Tony said and his voice was desolate.
Tony couldn't help himself and laughed. “An
"Friday, what time is it?"
Steve's face turned red and Tony found it extremely cute.
The man in front of him turned around completely, facing Steve and held out his hand. Steve held it and the two looked at each other for the first time. Steve was quick, but he was a good observer. The man had brown eyes, alive, large and curious, that stood out from the rest of his face. His mouth was well designed and he had full lips and, let's all be honest here, inviting. His hair was also a very dark brown, combed and parted carefully. And he was wearing the best-cut suit Steve had ever seen, giving the impression that the outfit and the man had been born together. And in the end, that unknown and disconcertingly handsome man smiled and Steve felt a shiver run down his spine.
He turned, went to the refrigerator, and held himself back so as not to enter the inviting cold that came from inside. He took two bottles of water, sat down on the huge counter that separated the kitchen from the living room and took off his coat.
Steve came back to Tony, facing him. Tony felt his heart race.
Tony moved as well and passed Steve, in a very bad mood, heading for the elevator.
, that I couldn’t do it.” Steve put his hand behind his head and scratched the back of it, as if he were suddenly uncomfortable. He sighed, looked up, and looked again a few inches to the left of where Tony really was. “We need to talk.”
See you soon!
"Let's not get caught up in the details, okay?"
“Really? There were plenty of people at the party. And lots of cameras.”
With no shame, Tony took one of Steve's hands and placed it right on top of his erection, not at all being hidden under his undersuit. Tony shivered and groaned loudly. “This. And it has to be you, Steve.”
Tony looked at Steve. “What do
"Since when do you have an island?"
And Steve gave it to him. Holding Tony tightly around the waist, Steve opened his mouth to receive Tony with all his impatience and desire.
Steve reached over and pressed a button. Thirty seconds later, the glass in front of them brightened enough for them to observe what was happening in the other room, but no one on the other side could see them.
“Prepared for a whole weekend without any communication with the outside world?”
______________________________
But everything had changed.
Bucky greeted Tony back and smiled.
When did listening to Steve calling him my love become so natural and with the power to ignite Tony’s soul?
Liz blinked away the tears, and her eyes returned to that hopeful glow. Steve's heart quickened.
Steve bent over to kiss Tony with sweetness and passion and for a moment, there was no incursion, no fire, and no destruction. There were only the two of them under a dome of love and the certainty that their daughter was safe.
"Friday, prepare my lab and the stabilizer. I'm going to work on it today.”
"Three heads are gone. There's one missing," Sam said, past Tony and taking Natasha to the floor.
“Tony?” Steve called in a neutral, calm voice.
"Why do you think they're here?" Steve asked before opening his own door.
The soldier narrowed his eyes.
“I can’t believe it was like that.” Tony shook his head, punching himself mentally for that stupidity.
“I said we already see you as our daughter,” Steve said, completely turned to her, giving her all his attention.
During the early hours of Tony’s morning and Natasha’s evening, they decided everything about the invitations (the good old e-mail, always work for superheroes), the menu (chicken minifajitas, mini bacon quiches and hot dogs, Steve's favorites), beverages (all distillates of which Tony could remember, beer, orange juice and water), decoration ("Less is more," Natasha had said. Then they would keep the penthouse without decoration because, according to the spy, "the Tower is already naturally beautiful."), and music ("Let the DJ do his job, Tony", Natasha had said, "I'll find the best New York DJ and that's it.").
but he needed a better position to enjoy it. That rush of desire helped clean his mind enough so Tony could at least know where he was. With a cleaner mind Tony made Steve sit on the floor and climbed on his lap, straddling him.
“And you don’t?” The scientist grimaced.
"What? What do you mean?" Steve was confused. Five years ago he was a confused mass in mourning for Peggy's death trying to be strong for Peter. How could that help?
“Aye, Captain!” With thunder rumbling across the sky, the Asgardian god flew northward and Steve and Wanda followed.
“Yes.” Strange was about to punch Tony and Tony knew it. And he was enjoying taking the Sorcerer Supreme to the limit of his infinite patience.
was concerned about his well-being.
“Kinda. She is part of the academic decathlon group, but we never talked much more out of there.”
- Tony forced himself to open his eyes and inhale more often, feeling the scent of the coffee and letting the caffeine pull him out of the wonderful torpor that Steve was taking him to.
"If the Tower is whole when we get back, I already consider tonight a victory." Tony shrugged.
“Curious, darling?”
"He only speaks French, I'm sorry," Pierre apologized.
“All right. Get the company jet ready, okay? And ask Happy to stop by to give me a ride.”
Tony smirked, noticing the change in subject, but let it go. “Yes, he did. He wanted the Superhuman Records that were being held by SHIELD.” Tony saw Steve’s eyes widen and raised his hands, calming him. “That’s why I said at the beginning that, when I accepted to be Director of SHIELD, I believed that I was the best option at that time for the position. I wouldn’t do anything that shouldn’t be done with those Records. So, before handing over the house keys to Osborn, I deleted the entire SHIELD database that contained the Records, including the backups.” Tony smiled smugly.
Steve smiled.
“For the lies, for not being more reasonable, for not talking to you before ... for not saving you.” Thinking that he could have done something to avoid the shots still deeply troubled Tony. He had secretly created counter-attack plans in possible sniper scenarios, such as the day of Steve’s death. It would never happen again.
"She was an Army Sergeant."
"Thor, I thought you talked to Hercules about these things coming to New York."
"I know it wasn't him. But his DNA at the crime scene complicates things, Steve. That's why I sent you the best lawyer I know. One of the best in the country. Talk to him, listen to what he has to say. He has experience in complex cases. And he promised me that he will stay as long as he needs."
, please! Ah, that’s pleeeeaasure. For God's sake, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop. I'm going to come so hot.” Tony’s was out of himself. His sentences were more or less intelligible combinations of “yes”, “don’t stop”, “harder” and “ah”.
“But I was just kidding myself. I should’ve realized that everything was going downhill when every time we tried to talk it all went wrong, either it was never the right time, or it was just a mixture of those two factors.”
Steve swallowed, but said nothing. Tony took another step toward the girl. Now they were less than six feet from each other.
"It's good for you that today I chose a nice suit."
“I heard he created a twisted version of the Avengers,” Steve noted.
Steve frowned.
Steve Rogers was back.
“Start? What are we starting with?” Tony asked, his heart hammering in his chest, threatening to wake the entire block.
"Aren’t you gonna tell me where we're going?"
Steve sighed and opened his eyes.
is impossible, not even to love someone you just discovered to be your daughter, despite the extremely atypical circumstances.” Steve was now with his hands on the table, looking deeply at the girl. That was his last trick. “And I'm sure we here aren’t so different from our versions there. And what makes me believe it so strongly is to know that if I were in their shoes, I would pray that the best part of me, my daughter, would find someone willing to love her and take care of her as if it were me. You don’t see us as your parents, nor as people capable of loving you and helping you, but we already see you as
Before Cerberus could move to attack Steve, Wanda lunged at the huge dog and mounted on the middle head. Realizing that it was being set up, the middle head was startled and began to move furiously to the sides, trying to throw Wanda away, but she held onto the dog's black hair and Steve could see red energy flowing from Wanda's hands to the head of Cerberus. The Avenger's eyes lit up, and Cerberus's eyes closed. All six. And the huge hellish dog fell under his four paws, sleeping peacefully in front of the United Nations building.
“Hello, Stark.”
, Steve to take care of him, to cherish him and, more than that, to give Tony the best sex ever before he exploded.
“So that's how you managed to get through all of my radars.” Tony said, more astonished than outraged.
and nobody else’s.” And to prove his point, Tony slid his hand down Steve’s back and squeezed one of his cheeks.
"Although I'm already counting on some educated refusals," Natasha made an expression of disdain, "by my accounts most of these people will come."
But he was stuck. He couldn't get out of there. His hands were glued to the steering wheel, his foot on the brake and his mind empty and so full at the same time. Peter was so close, but those reporters couldn't get to him, right? But they already knew, didn't they? Everyone there already knew that his son, his boy, was inside that police station. No, his boy didn't deserve that.
"But how long?" Steve looked quickly at Tony between slices of zucchini and slices.
"Was the press here?" Peter's voice rose.
“Thank you again.”
Tony's own cock leaked as he heard those words coming from Steve.
"Yes, Captain," a ten-voice unison, sounded in his ear.
“Steve and Tony are your biological parents?”
"Last week? What happened last week?" Steve asked, holding his breath.
” The Sorcerer Supreme narrowed his eyes and looked at Tony and then Steve. “Since when do you call yourselves pet names instead of defamatory nicknames? And since when do you walk around hand in hand?”
"Why?"
“In her room with Sergeant Barnes.”
But in the end, there she was taking the daughter of Steve Rogers and Tony Stark to meet her parents.
“The rules have changed today
“That was a terrible one.” Steve laughed out of breath.
"Where's my father?" Peter asked before they even turned the corner.
Tony turned to him, very serious, and looked at him. "If he thinks I'm the one to blink first in this game, he's very much mistaken. In this game, I'm an expert," Tony winked at Rhodes in a mischievous way. "I'm
“It will.”
It was still a mystery as to why those Doombots had appeared, but if there was one thing they had already learned was not to try to question Victor Von Doom.
"Still, it's an important date."
“You want to go there and talk to her, don’t you?”
"What’s your thing with sitting on the counter?" Steve stepped back to Tony's side, but didn’t sit up.
"If depends on me, yes, it will."
"But no access to the internet," Tony smiled crookedly. "And I blocked all the signals. The cameras weren’t working.”
Clint turned to Steve.
She smiled back and floated back to the ground, but she swayed as she landed and Steve held her up.
“Hi, Tony.” Steve smiled without showing his teeth and Tony thought he could melt in a puddle right there.
"Romanoff," the spy answered three rings later.
"Nice way to travel," Peter commented.
to the position of Director of SHIELD.” Tony emphasized each word, making quotes in the air. “The government fell for Osborn and accepted the proposal. Thus, I was deposed from the position of Director of SHIELD. But we know that Norman Osborn can’t be trusted because his plans have plans. Nothing is ever what it seems. And this time wasn’t different. He didn’t want to be Director of the largest spy agency in the world simply because the goodness bug stung him and he decided he’d be nice. He had other plans.”
"A full house, too," Steve said, showing his cards. "But smaller than yours." A pair of twos and three threes.
"I'm Natasha, and these are Thor, Clint, Sam, and Vision. We are members of a team called Avengers” she thought a little “Was there something like that on the other Earth?”
"As soon as you give the signal, which I still don’t know what it is."
Steve nodded and they walked into the compound through one of the side doors of the hangar, heading toward the elevator down the hall. Inside, Steve pressed the button of the basement and, silently, the doors closed and the elevator began to descend. Neither of them said anything. Ten seconds later, the doors opened with a plim! and the two Avengers went out into another corridor, headed to the right, and entered the second door, into a small, dark room with two chairs facing the right wall that was covered with glass to see the other room, but that, for now, was blocked by the other side, most likely by Natasha, who did not want to spoil the surprise before the time.
The fight was really quick, with Tony destroying most of the robots with small missiles, Clint hitting arrows straight at others, and Natasha and Steve taking care of the crazy IT analyst. Tony just didn't count on a remaining robot that hit him in the back, in a final attempt by that Zuckerberg project to achieve some victory. Tony was thrown several blocks away and it took him a few minutes to get aware where he was. He could only hear Steve calling his name on the comms, until the soldier’s face appeared on his display, concern evident.
Tony waited for the elevator door to close to release the air he was holding and tried to control his heart. He was sure that Steve could hear every beat with his improved audition, but that was the least of Tony's problems at the moment.
“Nope.”
The sun was finally in all its glory in the Dubai sky and the clock in the corner of the holographic display indicated that it was eight in the morning. Tony did the math quickly; it was four in the afternoon in New York.
Holding Tony as the most precious thing in the world, Steve laid him on the lab's floor and followed with his hands the contours of his slim and strong body, that the undersuit outlined so well, and which supported the armor that transformed Tony into the shiny armor knight that Steve adored, while leaving kisses on his pecs, his nipples - one at a time, worshiping them, learning which movements Tony liked best, which ones made him sigh the loudest.
Steve stopped talking and stared at Tony with wide eyes. “You weren’t there.”
Tony opened his saddest smile and he saw how his expression affected Steve, who frowned and opened and closed his hand on the kitchen island, as if, for a moment, he wanted to reach Tony, but he had changed his mind. Tony nodded. “Yes, I chose it. I
that this is really happening,” she sighed heavily. “I'm sorry it doesn’t make it any other way, because I'm sure you're amazing people. I don’t think it's possible that any version of my parents could be less than that.”
“What?” Tony’s voice got higher. He was shocked.
“I've already contacted S.H.I.E.L.D. to extract this idiot,” Natasha said.
He tried to laugh at his own joke, but Tony was too nervous even for that.
Steve blinked and put the mold on the counter, still looking at Tony. "You didn't mean that I'm handsome?"
not mad at you,
“Nothing else happened, okay?” Steve took another long sip of his water with his eyes closed, clearly trying to calm down.
He doesn’t want to fight.
“No use imagining anything now. I doubt any hypothesis will remotely come close. It could be that she's talking about the coffee maker that broke again or that they've caught the Silver Surfer drunk above the space speed limit.”
with Tony? Tony really wanted to punch something.
, Steve spoke without making a sound, just to Tony.
All the while, Steve stroked Tony’s hair and nurtured him, showing that he wasn’t alone to face whatever was on his head.
"Yes. And you know what I saw?”
“What about you?”
The sound of the warning alarms was deafening.
“Tony, look at me.” Tony took a deep breath and did what Steve asked, meeting eyes so full of love that he thought he could drown. “Now, pay close attention to what I’m going to say to you, and please don’t be mad at me later, okay?”
At that moment, the quinjet landed next to the United Nations building and the two stood up.
“Very well,” Tony said, settling on Steve’s lap, so that his legs wouldn’t go numb, he took a deep breath and let his hands slide from Steve’s face to his chest and rest there. “And we just postponed our bath, is that what I’m seeing here?” Tony pretended disapproval.
Tony’s brain was full of cotton. He was numb with that whole statement. Steve saw him as a lifeguard. Steve saw Tony as Tony saw Steve. How was that possible? It didn’t feel right. Steve was the safe haven there, not Tony. Tony was the Bermuda Triangle, sucking everything and everyone around into chaos. He couldn’t be the beacon that led to safety. Tony’s heart was racing, responding for him, propelling him forward, but his legs were still frozen. Something was still missing ...
This caused another wave of laughter at the table and an extremely irritated Nick Fury. Tony met Steve's gaze and wasn’t surprised to see the soldier watching him. Steve took the tablet and started typing.
Tony felt his eyes sting. “You don’t know that.”
“Friday caught extremely strong, unusual, and sudden energy signals at Lincoln Center just minutes ago.”
Steve shook his head, still on Tony's neck. Tony laughed.
Tony blinked, returning to the present, finding Steve looking at him expectantly and with an amused look. “Sorry, I was just, well, you know, thinking.”
“Yes, it all happened, but long story short, only my body died, Tony.” A shiver ran through Tony’s body when he heard his own name being said by Steve. Would he get used to it again?
“Call it, oh Captain, my Captain!” Tony intoned in an affected voice, because he knew he would get that beautiful shade of red off Steve’s face and, oh yes, there it was. Tony smiled and triggered the repulsors to pass over Clint and Natasha, who helped Steve get civilians out of the crossfire. “I'm gonna go ahead and delay the robots.” Tony said. “See you soon.”
Tony looked at that jack in disgust.
birthday party, you know? It must be special for the man, not for the symbol.”
Recovering from his orgasm, Tony smirked.
I have no home
Steve too.
Natasha nodded.
"It was better," Steve said without even thinking. Tony shifted and faced him. "In my dream it wasn’t real, as much as I wanted it to be. Now I can touch you for real,” Steve stroked Tony's face. “I can really kiss you,” he came over and gave Tony a quick kiss. “I can stay with you for real,” Steve smiled and Tony smiled back. “So everything I'm living right now is way better than any dream I might have had.”
“Don’t be so hard on her. She was scared and scared for you. She just wanted to protect you from more pain.”
“I left when I saw my parents hugged in the middle of the burning lab,” she said in a voice filled with tears. “The last memory I have of them is to see them exchanging one last kiss before everything was being consumed by the fire and I being sucked to the multiverse.”
. I can only feel
(See the end of the chapter for
No matter where you go, I will accompany you. Because
Steve, then, in a bold move, not only called, but increased two chips, totaling six. Tony felt his eyes widen quickly, but he soon returned to his empty expression.
” Steve waved vaguely in Tony's direction. “
“I love you, Winghead,” Tony said, still hiding.
With his pants loose enough, Tony slid his hands to Steve's ass and slipped a hand through the fabric. His hand covered one of the cheeks and Tony squeezed it.
“Have you already realized that no matter what situation we are in, at one time or another, we always end up alone with each other?”
“The pollen is already inside you.”
"You look amazingly beautiful in everything you wear, Tony.”
"You must be Steve Rogers, right?" Steve nodded, not trusting his own voice.
"We have a ship, apparently of non-terrestrial origin, with some damage, but with the structure still stable and” Vision went a few feet to the right, being exactly by the side of the ship, facing the place where Natasha was “yes, there is a person here. A young woman.”
"Us too, Hercules," Steve smiled without showing his teeth. His energies were already at the end and he hadn’t much left to even try to be diplomatic.
They moved far away enough for Tony to finish taking off Steve’s shirt and Tony took a little break to admire the man in front of him, the man he loved, and who, surprisingly, loved him back. He reached out and touched Steve’s torso slowly, gently, learning how each of those lines behaved under his fingers, how Steve reacted to his touch, what sounds he made, which places produced the softest sighs, the deepest moans. Steve waited patiently, even though he was breathing hard, his hands holding Tony around the waist, admiring Tony’s reconnaissance work.
“I will be here.”
“Tony, I-” Steve started, but he never finished the sentence, because Tony didn’t wait for it. The invitation was right there, in front of him. So, he just held it and, with all the passion and willingness he had, he put Steve’s cock in his mouth and sucked, taking all the air out of Steve’s lungs in the process. Tony was very good at that and he knew it. He would do his best for Steve. And he did. Feeling the blood pounding in his ears, Tony slid his tongue all over the bottom, making Steve’s knees buckle and faltering, making him kneeling, giving full access to Tony, who was, little by little, putting all Steve’s cock in his mouth, delighting in the weight of it on his tongue, until he felt it touch the back of his throat.
Tony set it all down - a large dish with eggs and bacon, cutlery and two mugs with fresh coffee - on a tray and climbed back up to the room. He turned on the hallway light and looked inside. Steve was still asleep in the same position Tony had left him, but now he could see him, his arms hidden under the pillow, his mouth slightly open, his hair messed up in a golden nest, his back rising and falling slowly, his slender body stretched flat on his bed, as if Michelangelo's David had grown tired of being a statue and had become a real man, and now was laying on Tony's bed.
“A portal of unknown origin appeared on the 5th with 22nd East, near Madison Square Park,” Friday responded immediately.
Tony’s brain was short-circuited. “Excuse me? How come you weren’t
Tony's foot reached the end of Steve's thigh and stopped as he felt the volume beneath the cloth. Steve held the tablet tightly and took a deep breath. Tony licked his lips again, and saw the soldier’s chest rise and fall quickly.
That was the last straw and Tony decided he’d already endured beyond what was humanly possible. Steve exposed himself to the sex-pollen because he wanted Tony as much as Tony wanted him.
“Captain Rogers?” Jarvis called. “My analysis show that all the hormones that indicated the presence of sex-pollen in the sir’s body have returned to their normal levels or, when in the case of substances not known to man, have disappeared. And his limbic system is visible again. Apparently, the
Tony winced. "A long time?"
a more friendly little voice helped. Tony smiled.
"Why don’t you take those things up there?" Tony pointed to the suitcases on the floor, "and you come back here? This heat is killing me and I need to drink something.”
that girl, because that's what that would be: they would adopt from themselves, as strange as it may seem. But he couldn’t force Liz to accept them. Moreover, both he and Tony had to deal with it.
“I tried to save Bucky,” Steve said, reading Tony’s thoughts. “But I couldn’t.”
Steve continued to cut the eggplant into slices and after finishing, and placing the slices in a bowl, he took an Italian zucchini and started the same process again. "Steve," Tony said, as he watched, mesmerized, at Steve's work. "Peter knows you’re here if and when he needs it. But he needs time to process what’s going on."
"I want you so
The answer didn’t come so quickly and neither was what Tony expected.
Tony lowered the glass he had been holding for too long and smiled. "I'm fine, thanks," he pointed to the food in front of him. "I made dinner. I didn't know if you were coming down to eat something or not, so I made enough for both of us."
he thought.
“Then don’t, baby. Let it go for me.”
“I still don’t know how that’s possible,” Tony’s voice came muffled from where he was with his face hidden in Steve’s neck.
"Back to you.”
"Was it like your dream?" Tony asked after a while.
Tony sighed, admitting defeat. There was no use trying to postpone for much more. “What do you remember from before you died?”
Steve Rogers was back.
"Not anymore," said Peggy, when she heard the social worker's story. "He is now our son." And so, Peter went home with them, fitting perfectly into their lives, as if he had always belonged there.
“Kind of risky,” Tony commented.
“Tony, we were at war. I won’t say that I agree with what you did, nor will I say that it was right. You know what I think, otherwise you wouldn’t be here asking me to forgive you. But it’s not up to me to forgive you.
