“Steve,
“Man, am I glad to see you.”
Somehow Steve remembers these names. Howard is brought up a couple times, but only scarcely, and Tony gets a pinched look every time he’s mentioned, so Steve learns not to talk about him.
“First few days or so, Buck and I spent it undercover, just hitting up old informants, a lot of waiting around, trying to get a trail, something we can follow.” Sam narrates. “We finally hit on something day four; one of Bucky’s old connections as the Winter Soldier got us some info about this high profile criminal who’s been breaking into high security bank-vaults like it’s child’s play. Calls himself ‘The Ghost’.” Sam rolls his eyes, clearly expressing what he thought of that name. “You’ve probably heard of him?”
“Is Peggy here?” Tony asks, and Natasha startles a bit, eyes glued to the scene before them. She wipes away some tears before answering.
Steve pauses a bit, not really sure how to answer.
“But-but
“Dear Lord,
“That’s...that-”
Tony stares at him, and then his expression abruptly turns blank, almost like it shuts down, hiding away all the vulnerability Steve had gotten a glimpse of behind a neutral mask. Steve blinks at him, briefly thrown.
remember anyone doing that, leaning into him. No one except Tony. He gathers him up, wraps him in a hug and hopes that he’s enough to bring this fever down, to at least make Tony comfortable before he - before he -
He brushes a hand through the dust, and the table underneath lights up, holographic schematics flickering to life above the smooth glass-like surface. One of the last projects Tony had worked on here.
how much you were struggling.”
The numbness in his hand and arm doesn't leave no matter how much Steve rubs at them, so he finally ends up ignoring it entirely, staring instead at the play of flickering light across the icy floor. The flames are mesmerizing to watch, smoke drifting in lazy spirals out the window Steve had cracked.
Life (or rather death) continues after that. Tony gets commissioned to help out at Immigration Offices (God he still can’t get over that name) and he happily designs new methods of screening, new architecture for new arrivals to live in, and often comes home to a paint splattered Steve bickering happily with a dirt splattered Natasha. Despite the occasional moments of melancholy, or even nightmares that Steve often helps soothe away, Tony is happy, truly happy.
"I have been nothing but civil to you." Steve returns coldly, not appreciating this confrontation one bit, especially when he’s already physically and emotionally spent.
He becomes aware of his surroundings slowly, registering the feeling of a blanket pulled up to his chest, soft sheets beneath his fingers, and the feel of bandages and a soreness that lingers at his throat and arms, hears the soft voices of conversation in the room.
To Steve’s complete and utter surprise, Tony is the one who comes to find him the next morning.
There’s a shiver of something in the air, and lights Steve didn’t even know existed start glowing a soft blue at the edges of the room, the schematics flickering above each table. They dance and Steve stares as he looks around, mesmerized.
The hydra agent is actually an OC, although I will admit that I took some inspiration from Madame Hydra from the comic-verse. It's not exactly her, but also not really far off either.
Tony’s mouth drops open and the look of utter betrayal almost makes Steve start laughing again. “Stop that. No. That face is not allowed, stop, put that expression away, I’m banning that from the compound.” Steve looks down at his pencil sadly. “Oh my God STOP it, I swear to God you’re
, none of them included jumping to the
“Do you hate me now?” Tony finally breaks the silence, laughing through his tears then, as if he’s made some grand joke.
, and Tony laughing so hard his stomach hurt, and Steve sniping back that how was he supposed to know that them passive aggressively arguing over a car seat was premature love…
He wants to cry. He wants to scream.
“Just so you know,” Bucky says absently as he eats his yogurt, “I don't think Sam's letting go of that shield anytime soon, think that thing has become his security blanket.”
He doesn’t mind social media, and he definitely doesn’t mind the internet. Hell, he knows how to
Steve spends the next week avoiding AI Tony like it’s his job, which happens to be a very difficult thing to do when said AI runs the entire compound you live in.
“I get it if you don’t want to talk to me right now, I’ll leave you alone-”
“Sleep well.” he says quietly to Steve. There's a flicker of something behind his eyes, but it's gone in a flash, the blank expression already returning as he goes to leave. Steve tries not to hear Bucky's words for the goodbye that it is.
“Look Quadratic-”
you, deep breathes he says-” Tony wheezes, and Steve’s worried now, about to get up and call someone for help, but then he stops in his tracks when Tony lunges at him.
Tony side-eyes her, because it’s been fifteen years and Natasha has never once shown an urge to garden, and really she could’ve come up with a
“Uncle Steve’s a mummy now.” Morgan tells him earnestly, and Clint snorts, gives Steve an amused look.
“I panicked when the door asked me for a handprint confirmation and ran away.” Steve picked up his beer from the coffee table and drank a bit.
“Oh don’t act dumb.” Tony says dully. “I’m not broken, so you can stop your little speculations with Pepper. I get it. I’m an AI, but I’m not gonna just kill you all in your sleep, so you can unclench.”
Tony’s rant ends on an offended shriek and at this point Steve is failing horribly at keeping his hysteria in.
could cause, but if there’s a need-”
“Thanks babe.” he patted Steve on the arm and then promptly went back to talking about the plan, and Steve nods along and hums in the appropriate places like the good boyfriend he is. Natasha mouths “whipped” at Steve again when Tony isn’t looking, which he resolutely ignores.
Steve rolls his eyes. “I’m in one piece aren’t I?”
, life-changing even. I feel betrayed, I've been lead on by your friendly demeanor and wholesome good looks, this is false advertisement. Stop
"Like we rehearsed, children!" Tony declares.
He laughs into the snow until he’s gasping for air, happier than he’s been in months, composes himself enough when Tony comes to get him and drag him up the hill.
“Yeah of course I - Steve are you going somewhere with this?”
Tony clears his throat awkwardly, even though he doesn’t need it. “Bruce helped me out with that, since. Hologram. The EMP worked well the first time I used it of course, but the end result was dangerous, because of how widespread the pulse was, so we fixed it to be more adjustable, everywhere from a blast radius of two blocks to one that’s five metres, and inputted it into most of the armours.”
The giant bruise that covers a good half of the man’s face detracts nothing from his beauty, with dark full lashes sweeping over sharp cheekbones, golden skin, full lips framed by a goatee. His unruly dark hair is a sharp contrast against the pale ice, as is his red and gold attire; which Steve only now realizes is a type of armour, and the glint he saw across the hall was gleaming metal.
He upgrades Hawkeye’s arrows, and replaces Widow’s worn uniform, and makes Cap do insane obstacle courses, and buys Hulk glass figurines, and works in the lab with Sam and listens to Thor talk about Asgard, and gets repeatedly dragged out of the lab by Jarvis and the bots and it's...nice. Familiar. Comforting. Those insecurities have been the quietest they’ve been in years, and Tony can't help but be grateful.
Steve almost gives in, because he can’t seem to refuse Tony for anything, but if he attempts a smile now, it’s not going to look rigid and fake like it did at the beginning. Tony will see everything, and that can’t happen, so Steve forces himself to remain blank.
Steve snorted. “What part of that conversation struck you as remotely functional?”
“Yeah yeah, yuck it up Steve,” Tony says, “I control the compound, revenge will be mine. You’ve messed with the wrong AI etc. etc. insert evil laughter here.”
expression pained. “-wish I could
He turns away when looking at them proves to be too much.
“Would be a horrible beer float.” but Steve shrugs. “Do it if that’s what makes you happy.”
He honestly hadn't expected to enjoy filming as much as he had. He’s spent his entire life in front of cameras, and he’s always felt the suffocation of it acutely, and didn't expect this situation to be any different. Except now, while he’s discussing different camera angles and the way a certain shot is supposed to look with Tara, he can finally choose the way he wants to express himself. He has a choice, and it's…oddly freeing.
2. All the injuries/science described in this chapter is dubious at best, because I tried to google things, but this particular instance is kind of specific so I couldn't find much information. So I apologize if it's inaccurate :))
“Neither do you.” Tony mumbles sullenly into his cup.
Steve then turns and raises an eyebrow at all the younger Avengers and co. that have now gathered around him at the dining table.
“I’ll take that as a no.” Tony slumps further down in his chair.
And Steve, bewildered and high on the sudden rush of happiness that bubbles up and bursts, stupidly, starts
Tony, the fury that the AI is even here, alive (as alive as an AI can be) and the real Tony is not.
“No...no, I couldn’t. I couldn’t do it. Pretty much ran the other way.” And Pepper nods.
Pepper grins, self-satisfied. “I ran into her once.” and Steve squints at her suspiciously. “Why,” he begins slowly, “do you look so smug?”
“If you say so Tony. And eat some food while you’re at it.”
His plans become slightly derailed however when he opens the door to see Tony sitting casually on Steve’s bed.
"We're wondering if we should let Morgan know about Tony." Happy finishes for Pepper and.
He heads back inside, intending to rejoin the others in the living room, but he finds himself stopping just beyond the doorway, because in the short ten minutes he's been away, the rest of the Avengers have all gathered together on the couch in a gigantic group cuddle, watching the news. AI Tony is nowhere in sight.
“Real time.” Steve says, a pit growing in his stomach as well at the thought of what might be happening over in Tony’s kingdom. He doesn’t want to say this, wants to beg Tony to stay here where it’s safe, with Steve, but he knows Tony would never forgive himself if he doesn’t do something. “You have to go.”
“Anything from your kingdom would do.” he clarifies when Tony stares at him, confused, and Tony finally plucks a singular thread from his jacket.
It was carnage. Tony, Steve and Natasha watched as allies were made, friendships broken, and backs stabbed. By the end of the game, not a single person remained clean (other than Wanda of course) and the field was a mishmash of bright synthetic colours.
"Yes." Steve sighs, a bit frustrated.
Bruce looks up from the screen at all of them and the expression on his face makes it clear that what Harley said about a human personality is exactly what he’s implying.
“It’s possible.” Steve says calmly, even though he’s anything
Tony makes sure to discreetly give Fury the finger when he settles back into his chair and starts fiddling with his phone again.
to be rescued.” he snarls.
, it's not even fucking
Steve goes back to staring at the ceiling, trying to ignore the fact that Tony is still studying him from his position, half sitting, and half “leaning” on an elbow so he can look at Steve. From his peripheral vision, Steve can see how Tony’s eyes flick over his face, expression still tired, but open now. Calm. He’s just observing. He’s...very close.
Steve groans and Tony finally falls into a mutinous silence, still glaring daggers at the floor.
Tony laughs at that and goes back to watching the screen. It’s been a few weeks since he crossed over apparently, and they scroll through the footage together of the rebuilding efforts and the universe healing. It’s nice.
Tony stares at her, with an expression that clearly says ‘does not compute’.
that?!” The kid’s voice cracks into a squeak at the end of his exclamation. Definitely younger than 19 then.
“Sorry about calling you in two seconds after you arrive back Scott.” Wanda says at one point and Scott shrugs.
Tony smiles at him, light coming back into his eyes, and Steve's so grateful, so glad that his idiotic actions haven't ruined this too.
Steve blinks up at the man's glare. It's the most expression he's seen on anyone's face in. He doesn't even know how long anymore.
“Well,” Steve begins after a moment's hesitation. Tony finds himself admiring how the afternoon light makes Steve’s pale skin and hair glow. He looks beautiful. “I think...I want to take you out on a date.” and Tony starts to smile.
Tony and Steve go back to small talk after that, Steve eventually plating the truly impressively gigantic stack of pancakes (They all eat a lot.
This last comment proves to be a little too much for both Natasha and Tony’s rising amusement and they burst into laughter.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Steve Rogers.” he says out loud.
“Daddy used to say he’d take me there one day to see the exhibits.” She says quietly, and Steve abruptly feels like he just got punched in the gut. She’s so smart, she’s Tony’s daughter so
He nods to himself, not finishing his sentence, and Steve feels like Tony’s two seconds from leaving and panics.
“Tony.” Steve looks at him worriedly, stopping him gently in the middle of his nervous rambling, because it sounds like Tony’s...asking for permission? And that’s just...no. “That’s entirely fine. If anyone should work with the armours, it would be you, and you
The next day dawns, and the world is strangely peaceful, no giant robots or techno-paths, weird Germans or insane alien creatures in sight. Instead, the cool lingering touch of late winter seems to be fading into a tentative spring, and the Avengers find themselves settling into a semblance of a schedule in the upcoming days, without the constant demand of superheroing (and yes that is TOTALLY a verb) to disrupt the flow.
He enters into the room, Steve following behind to close the door with a soft click.
Peter nods, still laughing. “I don’t know about you man,” he says, directing the first part to Harley. “Since we don’t go to the same school, but our gym teacher basically pulls out those videos at every single opportunity. He brings out a TV with a tape.”
It’s the familiar sound of a mechanism starting up, and the room resonates with it as the humming grows louder, almost as if the lab itself is suddenly coming alive, with how it fills the previously dead silence.
hoping it wasn’t me. Pepper seemed to understand though, so I talked to her about it a bit, not much though - I mean, I did ask her what Yinsen meant, which was kind of overstepping bounds so I apologize for that, but she knew what it meant already-”
“Everyone, status report.”
The cleanup is handled by SHIELD agents, because it involves chemical contaminants, which they’re more equipped to deal with then the Avengers are.
Steve gives him a smug look, and Tony glares at him before joining him in the elevator.
Steve glares at her, “Oh don’t
time to joke, Shellhead.” he responds, and hides his smile at Tony’s spluttering.
Tony, from then on, starts referring to their dance sessions as “potato-sack slinging” with a sparkle in his eyes, and Steve wonders how it’s possible for one person to be this contrary, brilliant, confusing.
Oh. Yeah. That is a difficult decision indeed. Steve can’t help but think to himself that he’s probably the
Sam goes back to grumbling, but Steve honestly has no complaints with that, so he falls silent and allows himself to be led to the living room where Harley and Peter are already there bickering over the remote.

“Must you.” He whines.
he can do. And he refuses to let Tony win.
“Um...technically? Yes, because I can multitask, but also no.” Tony says. There’s a brief pause and then:  “holographic me is currently helping Peter with his homework, and by helping, I mean watching as Peter insists he can write things without the function of a right hand, and stubbornly refusing to let me record his answers electronically.”
So it’s on one cool morning in early February when Steve wakes up and looks out of the window at the frozen lake and fresh snow, and realizes the idea of the Avengers compound without Natasha or Tony in it isn’t as unbearable as it had been before. It still hurts, but less.
He needs to leave before he says something he’ll regret, something he can’t take back. Tony’s here, and Steve feels like a bull in a china shop, sharp blades and razor edges, and the newly awakened AI doesn’t even have memories of the Civil War or of their first meeting in the helicarrier, has no defenses against the horrible things Steve says when he’s not thinking clearly, is all vulnerable wrists and soft skin.
Addilynn shrugs before explaining, “It allows you take a look at the events currently happening on Earth. Some people want a chance to see how their loved ones are doing, so we offer them that glimpse, although we often warn not to come here too much. Bad for mentality, to let your past consume you.” She gives Tony a sad smile as his eyes widen throughout her explanation, and for the first time since the conversation started, he gets a glimpse of her true age, all those years of wisdom and compassion and infinite sadness reflecting in her young eyes.
“Hello.” He grins at Steve, who laughs.
“Try, this item has been on Tony’s bucket list ever since he went to Morgan’s wedding and knocked over a glass of wine onto that great aunt of Pepper’s that Tony’s always despised.”
Steve gives Tony a sharp smile of his own, ready to be done with this entire fucking interaction.
“Yes.”
"Overall, it was the same as it always is, when it comes to Thor," Steve comments fondly as they near the door of their living quarters. "Newest trade negotiations are finalized, and Thor told me to tell you he's bringing over his brother to meet us next time he comes over. Loki is...interesting."
Pepper calls Steve into the living room with the rest of Tony’s family and Steve remembers distantly feeling shocked. He’s never held any illusions that he’s been a part of Tony’s family. Tentative friends maybe. Coworkers yes. Enemies, and Steve doesn’t want to think about that one. But there’s been too much history and pain between them, too many mistakes, for him to be considered anything closer, and the thought hurts like an open wound, infected and festering, but the truth is the truth.
Tony shrugs.
It’s been quite a while. Tony’s...actually not entirely sure how long it’s been since that day in the screening room, time is a bit finicky here in the Afterlife, and he finds that he’s started to mark things down as momentous events rather than days and units. The day Steve arrives is another one of those markers.
Every petal that falls after that is another counting down a day. Soon Steve will have enough petals to make a full bouquet.

and it rattled me. Actually that’s an understatement. It blew everything I knew to fucking smithereens. I left so I could process. And what you said about the malfunction thing...about being broken...this situation...it kinda hit a little close to home. I was just not in a good place yesterday; I already wasn’t thinking clearly, like
It’s too late. It’s already far too late, and Steve wants to scream, wants to break down, wants to crack into a million shards of ice, wants it all to stop; everything he’s ever loved, shattering bit by bit. “I’m sorry.”
“Now all of you, get the fuck out of my building.”
What.
“Really.” Steve can’t help but say in exasperation, pinching the thread between his fingers.
“Why thank you Morgan, I’m honoured.”
to hurt Tony. He's glad that the AI is feeling welcome here.
“Your complaints have been noted and ignored.”
Steve, my poor back.”
“‘morning.”
you ready to give?”
“Not yet.” Pepper says sadly, brushing a strand of Morgan’s hair back behind her ear. “Not today, considering all that’s happened. But really soon.”
and he's in trouble, except Bruce grabs him, pulls him back before he makes it a step, and he remembers.
Morgan begins squirming in Steve's arms as the Quinjet makes its ascent up into the air, and she promptly darts over to Peter as soon as her feet touch the ground.
“Yeah, I...get what you’re saying. But, just...
“How do you know where everything is?”
“Ok, so I actually do need your help.” Tony finally says, after about five minutes of comfortable silence. Steve hums in response without looking up. “Really. You don’t say. I’m shocked.”
Tony interrupts himself with a yelp of laughter as Steve suddenly picks him up as easily as anything, walking over to deposit him gently on their bed.
“I wish I could hug you too.” he looks up at Tony, give him a fond smile. “But here.” he leans over, grabs a throw pillow and hugs it to his chest, giving Tony a cheeky grin over the edge of it. “We’ll just pretend this is you. You give very nice hugs Tony.” he gives him a sincere, wide-eyed look, and Tony bursts into laughter, Steve joining in eventually, and it feels like he’s won the entire world.
Tony asks for a place to re-forge his armour one day, and Steve sees no reason to say no, so he shows Tony down to the basement, where the ice isn’t layered so thick, and an old forge exists. The place is long forgotten by everyone else in the palace, but Steve knows of it. He doesn’t remember why, but he gets the sense it’s important.
He finally gets up and starts slowly packing up his things. It’s time to go back.
“I figured giving him some space would be the best way to go about this,” Steve says quietly. “He wanted to be alone, so it’s been a couple hours.”
Steve allows himself to be instructed, watching Tony amusedly all the while, listening to him monologue, because it’s undeniable that he’s in his element here, surrounded by his own creations and genius, thoroughly entrenched in his math equations. It’s awe-inspiring to watch him work, flitting around the lab almost like a magician, although Steve makes a note never to compare what Tony’s doing to magic, because boy will he rant, but that’s exactly what it looks like to Steve. Magic.

I’ve got a fucking DEATH RAY pointed at you, are you like this with all the villains, because that is just plain
It’s snow and ice for them. For all of them. That’s all they’ve known, and that’s all they will ever know.
"Why are you following me?" Steve asks one day, interrupting Tony's terrade as he goes on about something or other. Steve's not sure they're speaking the same language at this point, Tony ranting about some sort of "science" that is lost to Steve.
Pepper sounds contemplative when she answers. “Maybe you did. This could be unrelated.”
It's good to be home.
Peter shrugs, throwing himself into Steve’s chair, and eyeing his notebook curiously. “You got stuck with babysitting duty.”
Natasha clears her throat from right behind Tony, and he curses, jumping about a foot in the air before spinning around. She smirks at him again. Damned super spies.
“Gets the job done doesn’t it.” Steve says, shutting off the acetylene blow torch. “Not all of us can be engineers with a bajillion PhDs.” He pushes the welding mask up and gives Tony a cheeky smile.
"Steve," Tony says, resigned. "I'm an AI. You did have a point with that, I'm not Tony Stark, and considering how much history you two have…"
Tara passes him her laptop.
“There is an old curse, back in my land.” Tony begins, picking at the hem of his jacket. Even being near him lights up Steve’s side with faint warmth, and Steve tries to concentrate on what Tony is saying instead of that.
They’re almost a month in. Tony collapses in the workshop, clutching at his chest, and Steve’s heart stops as he thinks,
Steve takes that as his cue to get the door, and stands up, jogging quickly down the hall.
, people should really stop underestimating teenagers-”
Wanda nods, giving Tony a gentle smile. “It’s not really human Tony’s fault either, he didn’t do anything wrong, we’re all just. Still mourning I guess. We miss him.”
Steve needs to leave
“Well this seems ominous,” Tony says as he takes in the variety of window cubicles lining the walls. There are some people milling around here, laughing with each other and talking.
Steve reaches out a hand towards the wood pile, crooks his fingers, pulls.
It isn’t his place. This isn’t a liberty he can take, not even when Tony’s gone, because it’s still
From there on, it gets steadily worse.
“And the ink?” Peter asks, handing Steve his pencil.
Natasha ends up showing him around the place. It’s beautiful here, all lush grasses and green fields, with beautiful glass buildings that reach for the sky. The Afterlife seems to reflect Life, still just as beautiful, still just as vibrant, but maybe not as broken. They walk through the park Tony had woke up in, and watch other spirits, some human, some alien, all going about their business, in all different methods of dress, a parallel of what it had been for them when they had still been alive.
“Every single facet of personality of yours is coded down to a T, and even as I look at this, it’s being altered by the events happening around you, and there are encrypted files, traits that you’re not even aware of yet, little quirks that in the grand scheme of things are useless - no offense meant, I’m just speaking in computer programming terms of course - and the system is learning and changing as it goes, the complexity and layers to this is
Left to his own devices, Steve stands there for a couple more minutes, thinking over if he has any prior obligations and wondering what he should do. After some contemplation, he finally decides he should go see Bucky off (read: make sure Sam and Bucky haven’t killed each other) before he leaves.
"Hey guys."
“What could I

Tony bounces up and down on his toes and Steve tries not to find it adorable. “It’s functional now Steve! And it can withstand your kingdom’s apocalypse level storms. Now all I need is like a day! Two days at most, fix some handholds so you can come with on a ride and…”
instead of that…
Steve senses the conversation is over, and Tony’s about to leave, but one final thing nags at him as he watches Tony’s discontented and haggard face.
“Her name is Pearl Jeffreys” Sam says tensely, as soon as Steve takes his seat at the table after nodding a greeting at everyone.
, even with it gone.”
??” Natasha continues to look very unimpressed.
Bucky smiles, and Sam nods, satisfied with the answer and they go back to bickering like always. Steve wanders back to Bruce with a happy smile curling his lips, and they prepare the rest of the toppings together side by side at the counter in comfortable silence.
“Oh well then.” Steve laughs, getting off of Tony and flopping to the side to lay next to him, “If your
Tony shrugs and clicks on it.
"What the hell are you doing?"
“Sorry.”
“You don’t seem as frozen anymore, sometimes.” Tony tells him, and Steve tilts his head.
“But it went over so well! You did amazing” She said smiling happily at him. “I underestimated your star power.
Steve shakes his head in disbelief when Tony finishes talking.
“Are you angry?” the question is even quieter, and Steve shifts his head a bit sideways in order to meet Tony’s eyes properly. Tony’s head is tilted and looks almost...curious. Inquisitive. A little bit teasing. It takes a second for Steve to answer, because he gets distracted by the play of the rays of the sun washing the ceiling and walls in colour instead of the usual shell white, lighting up Tony’s eyes into hazel and gold, and parts of him become translucent from the glow, like a spirit, a ghost. Steve’s fingers itch for a sketchpad and pencils.
“Tony.” Steve interrupts gently, and Tony falls silent in the middle of his babbling before sniffing suddenly, wiping away the tears that are tracking down his face.
“And...” Steve pauses, not really knowing what to call her, but Scott seems to understand, offering the information somberly.
He can feel the tendrils of hesitation creeping up, a couple of small reservations.
He decides to put a variety of topping options out, pulling out a carton of berries after moment of contemplation, dumping them out into a bowl to wash.
Steve hums in agreement, lifting up the lid of the pot to check on the sauce. “So, how was training today?”
“Natasha?”
“Weird. If I’m gonna be honest” Tony answers, smiling sadly at Natasha as she takes another bite out of her hot dog. Money is not a thing here, but apparently food is. “A little antsy. Melancholy, yeah that’s definitely one, and maybe even...happy? At the same time. About how it ended. About how we saved them, how everyone’s safe, and that part’s amazing, but it’s also horrible at the same time because we have to let them go, they have to let
, muscles screaming, but too late every time. And then the accusing looks, from Natasha, and Tony, their mangled bodies,
“I don’t monologue.” Tony protests. “And you were also
Then once he wakes up again, refreshed and feeling loads better, he does end up talking to Tara, has a productive conversation even, and she seems to get it, accepts his apology, then punches him an arm with a fond “take better care of yourself dumbass” and a soft smile.
Harley laughs, a bit sad. “Sorry Tony. You know what I mean.” and Tony responds with a teasing smile.
“Tony…” Steve stops his babbling gently with a hand on his arm. “Tony, I’m okay, really. It’s been what, seventeen years since Peggy died? I will always love her, just like you will probably always love Pepper. But I got my lifetime with her, and I’m satisfied with it. Peggy has her husband now who she also loves dearly, and if I’m gonna be entirely honest...it’s never been just her.”
“I’ll make you look good.” She adds.
Not one to dawdle after something is set, Pepper arrives the next day with Morgan and Rhodey.
, won’t go over well, it’s not enough for all of that, but then Tony has to go and imply that all of Steve’s sleepless nights, lying awake staring at the ceiling, panic attacks that he can’t control, are
It was around two or three in the morning before Tony finally noticed just how exhausted Steve looked. Tired as he was, Steve still hadn't wanted to leave so he hadn't said a word about it, powering through his sleepiness, and Tony quickly shooed him off to go take a shower and rest.
“-but the Avengers are gonna be here any minute now,” Tony finished with a raised eyebrow, “so I suggest you take your death ray there and skedaddle before they get here.”
and you showed up, and how exactly am I supposed to feel, about the fact that you look EXACTLY like Tony does, you act like him, you speak like him, but you're not him are you?"
oooh suspense. *evil cackle*
Fury mutters to himself while massaging the bridge of his nose.
“And you already know the rest.” Tony adds in quietly.
“Are they Hulk proof?”
“Exactly.” Addilynn laughs, and then gives Tony a headset. “It’s currently kind of like a simulation, just without all that clunky VR equipment bullshit-” Tony laughs at that. “-just speak your commands and the room will do the rest. We also have fail-safes to avoid viewing all the, erm-unwanted moments in ones life, so you don’t have to worry about accidentally happening on a more - ahem, intimate, um moment. Don’t wanna scar anyone too badly ha. We do allow for short spiritual visits instead of a mere simulation, but for that you’ll have to apply for approval from the Immigration offices. That’s where I work in case you didn’t realize.”

After a while she lets out a low whistle.
But Steve really doesn't want to be the one who welcomes him right now. Doesn't want that responsibility when he can barely keep himself together.
“Yes. Canoodling.” Natasha rolls her eyes at them, dusting off her hands before stepping off the porch to grab the hose situated underneath. Tony watches her incredulously, taking in her dirt splattered jeans and messy bun.
"Right, Pepper's going to
, how magnanimous of you-”
, I don’t want to hear another word.”
Steve sighs. “So can you tell me what’s bothering you?”
Steve heads to bed after that, falling asleep as soon as his head hits the pillow. It’s been an exhausting day, so almost like a reward, when Steve dreams that night, it’s sweet.
the team needs their leader.” Bucky interrupts, which is a good point, but Sam scoffs.
, then you’re stuck with me. I won’t be the one letting go. Ever. And you need to know that.”
“So,” Pepper says, taking a bite of the oreo as it is, which Steve argues is treasonous. “How goes things at the compound?”
And just like that, Tony freezes in place, still as a statue.
“But, the one thing I always had trouble accepting, the one thing that kept me away from him was the fact that he couldn’t give up being Iron Man. I never realized how hard it was making it for him, the fact that he had to choose, just because I didn’t realize that he
Before Steve can do anything, like go back in and demand some answers, ask Tony if he’s okay, Tony meets his eyes, and shakes his head, expression pleading. The look is clear. Not now.
It peters off into silence, and then Pepper sighs after a couple seconds of contemplation.
There’s silence from Tony’s end, and for a second Steve wonders worriedly if he had gone too far, if he had asked too much of the AI, but then there’s a quiet, joking question. “Shellhead?”
Tony’s trailing off and laughing and dancing around the workshop, and he’s so beautiful like this, his red jacket swirling, alive and lithe and graceful, and Steve’s breathe catches as he watches him, with no help from the vines.
“Cap.” he says and smiles. “God, what could I possibly say to you. There’s a lot of history between us, old man.” Tony shakes his head, and Steve gives a huff of laughter, despite the tears now streaming down his cheeks. “You’re a stubborn son of a bitch Rogers. Be happy.”
He enters the field sometimes if they need him as backup, but never as Captain America. He borrows one of the navy blue SHIELD suits in his size from Fury and fights with any weapon he can get his hands on. Without his shield he isn't really picky, and he knows how to work most forms of weaponry.
“Oh geez,
Steve wants him to live.
“Shut up” Tony groans and ducks into the kitchen. Or tries to anyways. Clint backflips over the couch and promptly drags him back to sit with them.
The implications of that. Well. Steve has to be honest. They’re
Steve frowns and mouths ‘Steve the captain america’ at Tony because why, and Peter rolls his eyes in good humour and says “Handwritten, Tony. Because they’re worried about cheating. Handwritten. Means written by hand. With no electricity involved.”
“We got exiled as well,” Peter whispers, rolling his eyes.
Steve hums, not really convinced.
Steve gathers his expression into something not disgustingly sappy before lifting his face from his hands. He imagines his expression is currently set in what Tony dubs as the “Captain America face” despite how many times Steve reminds Tony that he’s no longer Captain America. Tony is currently grinning happily at him, his fake hurt expression dropped, eyes warm, and Steve feels heat bloom across his face again at how
"Well, I got your EMP blast right here." Tony says, and the armour zooms past Steve, the portion that he had destroyed re-assembling and following him. "Sam, land. Now. This is gonna take out all technology for the next two blocks. Everyone get out of range, a million tons of free-falling nanotech is not going to pleasant to be under." and with that, the armour flies upward, dodging spikes and protrusions easily, finding an optimal position.
“I’m gonna put that self-deprecation aside for now, but don’t think I’m not coming back to that later young man-” Tony interjects, and Steve huffs a bit, almost a laugh but not quite. “-to just say, do you even know how these objectives work?” Tony sounds amused now. “Do you know how coding works you
“Good.”

made T.O.N.Y, who else could have had the genius, the knowledge to do so, and the fact that he set the AI’s primary objective to look after all of them when he’s gone, to keep them safe, protect them, even after all the hurt they’ve caused each other, and Steve, just. He just
Tony hums from beside him, and Steve just.
"Don’t change the subject.” Tony responds, sharklike smirk sliding firmly into place, and Steve takes back what he said about the AI being different because this,
He’s so tired.
Steve walks in fully, shutting the door behind him with a soft click and a smile. "About an hour ago at most. Mind telling me why Rhodey is yelling all around the castle about his dead, kidnapped daughter, which you seem to be in possession of this very moment?"
Tony watches Steve when he finally looks away, all beautiful blue eyes and vibrant golden hair, and feels a pang of what had almost been between them, when they had still been alive, that spark that he had buried after civil war, after all that hurt and pain. Even then, it had always been Steve. Always them, whether on the same side or opposite.
Tony looks at her questioningly. “Saw?” he asks. Natasha’s eyes widens and she laughs again, eating the rest of her hot dog in another bite.
The Winter Palace was always beautiful - remaining in cool tones of colour - but it sparkles with life now instead of frigid cold. It's no longer covered with ice, and it's bustling with people, servants and guards rushing around to do their business and to laugh and talk.
Bucky nods at him before Steve enters his living quarters when they arrive back that night, face blank. Steve hasn’t seen him truly smile in months, so he’s shocked at the small, broken one that suddenly graces Bucky’s face now.
“How’s Rhodey doing?” Steve asks curiously. They’ve finished all the oreos, so Steve has started fiddling with the plate.
“To be fair, we should’ve figured he was enough of a little shit to
“Heyyyy that’s pretty good.” Tony interrupts to comment. “A lot better than some other villain names out there, I mean we’ve got a Doctor Doom, we’ve got fucking Dracula, some knuckleheads decided
“Good afternoon, Mr. Stark.”
it is cleaning after a bunch of twenty year olds on Taco Tuesday-”
Tony listens, attentive the entire time, only interjecting at certain points to ask a quiet question, gaze steadfast, calm and unaccusing, even though now they’ve probably been there for hours, and Steve’s voice starts cracking at some point, hoarse from the excessive talking, but he keeps going.
“Shut up and eat your yogurt,” he mutters, and ignores Bucky's offended grunt.
"We need to talk." Tony says, turning to look at Steve, who stiffens in the doorway, irritation rising as Tony continues to stare at him. Seriously. Now?
Tony is there waiting for him.
Steve nods his understanding.
So instead he picks up Morgan from school when she starts kindergarten a year early, drives her to extracurricular activities and babysits when Pepper, Happy and Rhodey are too busy with Stark Industries and the Air Force respectively to do it. He washes dishes and cooks meals, draws in his sketchbook down by the lake (resolutely ignoring the fact that almost all of his pictures seem to turn into a sketch of Tony at some point or another), talks to FRIDAY when he’s the only one in the house and the silence gets oppressive, and life is not exactly good, not with the ache that still echoes behind Steve’s ribs. But it isn’t horrible either.
It’s just one of those days. He knows the feeling before it starts, the tension in the air, in his temples.
Tony opens his mouth, yet again, to object with some amazingly intelligent and well thought out insights.
“EXCUSE ME.”
The rest of breakfast goes in much the same way, full of happy conversations and laughter, discussing how Scott will be back from his trip with his family in a couple days, plans for the rest of the Sunday, Bucky’s mission.
did you even jump from what I said to
“Not on purpose.” Tony snaps defensively when he glances over sees Steve’s expression. “If you had wanted a private conversation you should have left the compound.” He hunches over further.
"Noooo," Steve smiles, pencil scratching at his paper, "it doesn’t, but it
you would have a legitimate reason for avoiding me. Selfish right?” Tony laughs. “I saw it too y’know? I helped you with a panic attack for fuck's sake! I saw how hard you tried when I started talking to you that day when I was first activated, how you would remove yourself from the situation when it became too much for you. I’m sorry I made light of your hardships when you were already trying your best, sorry I tried to wind you up, sorry I didn’t even

." Tony points out dryly. "It's enough to make a man jealous." He pouts exaggeratedly, sticking out his bottom lip to ridiculous amounts. Steve snorts and promptly pulls Tony into a soft kiss, crowding him up against the door.
Peter tries to wave them all off when they go to help him, and finally reluctantly let’s Wanda lead him out of the door when she refuses to leave his side.

“How long was I out?” he asks, already restless and wanting to move. The stabbing pains are some incentive not to, but not much of one if he’s gonna be honest.
Steve knows he most likely looks ridiculous, in an old t-shirt and sweatpants, undoing a gaudy pink apron as if it’s lingerie, but he’s not trying to look like anything else, and it pays off when Peter almost snorts orange juice up his nose. Harley has buried his face on the tabletop, shoulders shaking in silent laughter, Wanda, Sam and Bucky are not even trying to restrain themselves. Even Bruce is snickering into his hand.
“Sometimes it seems like a dream, y’know?” Tony’s saying, trailing his fingers along a snowdrift that’s piled to waist height. “That I survived. That in a couple of days I might get to see them. That we can leave and reverse all this.”
He answers hastily when he sees the caller ID.
Tony cuts himself off when Steve’s laughter grows too loud for his ranting to make a difference.
of the kindness he's been shown, because he had taken all of that and smashed it to smithereens, had been so entitled and selfish, focused on himself, ignoring Tony with no explanation, and Steve realizes a part of him has been seeing an object there the entire time simply because it's been too painful to see a person.
“Electric jolts weaken it,” he reports as he throws himself back in, fully utilizing the staff now that he knows exactly what it can do. “Only briefly though,” he mentions, as he watches the portions he zapped recover and reform into the main mass without problem. He spins the staff expertly, having learned a thing or two from Okoye during his brief stops in Wakanda those years he was running from the government, levers himself up and over a portion of the behemoth, slashes through it neatly, lands.
"Thanks Steve, we'll keep your advice in mind when we decide and let you know." She says, smiling warmly, and Steve shrugs.
- and Tony is sighing and leaning into his cold touch, trusting.
Steve makes an irritated noise and cuts himself off before he can start ranting about the fact that Tony didn’t just
“Steve no. It’s not your fault. That sentence is unimportant. Do you hear me?” Tony glares at him. “It is NOT your fault. Any of it. Not the workshop, or the phone call thing.”
From Steve’s vantage point, he can only see Tony’s face, not Morgan’s since she’s facing away, but it really says it all, that look of awe as Morgan starts babbling at him a mile a minute, talking about how much she missed him, and how “Mommy explained that you’re an AI that’s so cool!” and “it’s okay, I love you 3000 anyways, even though Happy says you don’t remember much”.
About seven minutes later, Steve finally hits on a weakness entirely by accident, when he realizes that the baton that he had grabbed quickly as he left for the helicopter is actually an electric staff.
“I did not.” Bucky grumbles as he walks over to stand beside them. Sam gives him an unconvinced look, and Bucky squints back at him. “You drop kick one measly informant and suddenly you ‘almost-blew-our-cover’”
“Shellhead.” Steve attempts to give him a dry look, but probably messes that up because he can’t quite hold in a fond smile. Tony laughs.

Steve blinks at himself in the mirror, momentarily shocked into silence.

“I’m glad you’re getting along better now,” is all Bruce says before he sits down, giving Steve a reassuring pat on the shoulder.
Steve had seen the humans at it, those huddled in their houses against the cold, a light source crackling merrily in a brick hearth, feeding on fuel and giving warmth to those around them. It would work. Except.
“-my name is
"And what are you up to now?" A voice asks from the doorway. Tony's head snaps up to see the warm gaze of his husband watching them amusedly from the open door, blue eyes sparkling.
Tony nods sedately.
“Tony’s recording y’all, just fair warning,” Peter had shouted out of the window at Sam and Bucky, and then ducked back in, laughing.
Steve laughs a bit at Tony’s disgruntled and exasperated tone.
Pepper gives Steve a surprised look, and Steve explains. "Um, Morgan is a really really bright kid and she understands more than most. I think if you tell her the truth, she'll be able to get it."
“Ironically, we mourn and move on. We live.”
Alive. Which Tony is not. Not anymore.
"My apologies," Steve murmurs, a little stilted. "That was rude of me. It's just. I have to go. I have duties."
“Propaganda. I really only ran around running missions that involved destroying things, and they gave me a rank because I was really good at it.” Steve shrugs. “I don’t know what I’m gonna do now really. I’m probably gonna go back to what's left of the compound, help rebuild maybe. Train some of the up and coming Avengers. The world doesn’t really need me specifically anymore, so who knows?”
Steve blinks for a second, not placing the digression, before it clicks and he rolls his eyes. “Oh my God, let it
the AI actually was, Scott hadn’t been anything but happy to see Tony back in some form or another. That makes sense, the two hadn’t really known each other much beyond fighting in an airport and then a team-up before the final battle. For them it’s a blank slate, a new friendship with no baggage.
Steve snorts. “Kind of.” he says dryly. Pepper smacks him gently on the arm. “Shut up and listen young man, wisdom is being imparted here.”
“Anyways. I was mad yes. I mean of
“What are you doing, where are you taking me, SAM-” His voice is cut off with the slamming of the glass lab door. Sam rolls his eyes and proceeds to take over Tony’s calculations as well.
in a good place, they’re safe and it’s warm here, wants them to know, wants them to stop hurting for him.
“Activating, Technological Operating Network Youth, or alternate designation T.O.N.Y.” the voice continues and Steve shakes his head, as blue light flickers, and form in the middle of the room, a perfect 3D rendering of a very familiar hero.
“No.” The Hulk grunts, scowling. Steve shrugs.
“Sure, why not. I got nothing to hide.” He says, smirking.
Pepper sighs a bit, a mixture of fond and exasperated.
Steve was surprised to find that he knows the flower petals he keeps hacking up out of Tony’s view and earshot. He expected them to be bloody rose petals, like they had been for Tony, but instead they’re camellias, the ones that used to grow all around the castle. Winter blooming flowers, the exact vivid red and gold of Tony’s armour. It’s kind of fitting. Steve’s sentimental enough now to have cleaned and frozen the first one he found, perfectly preserved in a layer of ice. He wears that on a chain under his shirt.
“Rest in peace, Tony” he says, and his voice carries throughout the big room, echoing slightly.
“Alright, alright.” He says finally, poking Steve in the side. “Enough sappy staring, we got work to do. Move it you lumps.” then he pauses, and narrows his eyes at the book Pepper is reading before snorting.
No. Tony wouldn't. Right?
“Look, I don’t know okay, time travel is weird, you’re the one who knows how to do all that physics shit, mister genius playboy billionaire philanthropist.”
distracting.
After realizing that Steve wasn’t going to respond anytime soon, the AI had apparently decided to look around a bit, testing out his holographic shape, walking through tables, fiddling with schematics, and he again, just looks

Another kiss, slow and soft, on the lips.
nanotech because of how everything had melted, and the precautions taken and the way that thing had fought is too advanced and calculated for Steve’s comfort or peace of mind, but they need to locate this villain, find out how exactly he got ahold of this, or how exactly he made this, analyze him for level of threat and stop him before he strikes again.
“TARA.” He shrieks, wheezing.
There’s Pepper and there’s Peter crouching, and at this point Steve no longer knows who else is there, because his vision has tunneled and blurred with tears, and he walks forward slowly, can feel his limbs going numb with shock, because
Peter starts writing some math equations shakily, a determined look on his face, tongue between his teeth, and Tony hovers worriedly over his shoulder, hand reaching out as if he wants to steady the pencil, even though he’s not solid.
Morgan promptly launches herself off the bed in Clint’s direction and Steve laughs at the surprised look on the archer’s face as he suddenly finds himself with an armful of giggling seven year old girl.
the substance. The arm weakens briefly, and as soon as it’s grip is loosened, Steve gulps in air, slashes the hand with the staff, and he drops to the ground as portions of the arm disintegrate, some glitching and shorting out from the jolt of electricity.
Hmm. Steve watches as one of the gaudily dressed villains cowers behind a half destroyed wall when Wanda levitates after him, getting captured easily. He’s cuffed and taken to the waiting vehicle. Maybe Steve’s giving them too much credit.
“Where have you been all my life?” Clint sobs, pulling her into an impromptu hug.
Then comes Clint, Sam and Bucky in that order. There’s a great deal of crying and hugging for those reunions, and they all somehow end up in a gigantic pile on the couch, watching old Friends re-runs.

And Steve smiles at that, soft, because he knows. He knows it’s passed. Tony loves him all the more for it.

Tony flickers back in beside the Iron Man armour as the gauntlet reaches over to take the tupperware of nanites gently from Bucky’s hand.

Steve's POV
Tony stays with him and they chat all through his bedtime routine before finally following Steve into the bedroom, halting in the middle of the room when Steve sits down on the edge of his bed.
“Go away.”
because how could you be?”
Steve pauses after a second, not having realized at first, and looks up at him, worried. He lets go of the wiring he’s doing and puts down the pliers.
“No can do,
“Anytime Tony.”
3. This chapter kicked my ASS. Oh my God, I literally have no idea if it turned out well or not because I've read it over so many times that EVERYTHING sounds horrible to me. Y'all let me know if it actually is horrible because I really can't tell. XDD
There are sad moments of course, there’s bound to be with them discussing all that’s happened in the almost fifteen years after the final battle with Thanos (really to be expected that Steve took so long to get here, he’s the peak of human health even at ninety), but it doesn’t last, because they all know that it’s not the end, not really. They’ll see all of them again eventually.
The Avengers had of course, been invited to a bunch of these memorials, but they had shown their respects last year for the first anniversary in public and this time Sam, as the new leader and face of the Avengers, had politely declined, because none of them felt like being scrutinized while mourning. They had done the same for Natasha and all the other memorials for the fallen heroes.
“That’s it, I want a divorce.” Tony declares loudly as they stride up to their front door. “I cannot in good conscience date someone who has such bad taste in food, that’s it Steven, it’s over for us.”
There’s a moment of breathless anticipation when they finally step into the room, Harley and Peter looking up from where they’re seated on the sofa, and Tony’s back is to the door at the moment, because he seemed to be talking to Peter, but he turns around when he hears them enter, face a mask of uncertainty and fear. And then.
“The purpose of this is twofold.” he continues. “The press currently controls most of your public image, and opinions of the people can be swayed with the drop of a hat. I want you all to get a media presence that you alone can control. It will act as a counterbalance to all the shit that the press will inevitably say about you. It gives you a way to respond without a chance of outside people manipulating the information.”
Steve gathers all the crocuses he can find after that, and makes a lot of the potion. He’ll run out eventually, he knows, he doesn’t even know why the flowers started blooming in the first place, but he can’t go like this. He can’t go not knowing what happens to Tony.
Morgan scrunches up her nose in thought, before nodding decisively.
He pulls Steve into a hug, and Steve lets him, takes the comfort gratefully and sits in broken silence with Bruce as the stars emerge, one by one.
the time to joke Steve.” Tony growls at him, and Steve laughs at his disgruntled expression, capping the medicine once he’s done.
Steve doesn’t know why he does it, but his very first drawing ends up being of Tony. He purposely makes it very very ugly, and leaves it on Tony’s workbench for him to find.
"I hardly think that matters." she smiles sadly and then shushes Morgan when she stirs a bit on her shoulder, rocking her gently back to sleep. “I know you loved him Steve. And I loved him, and Morgan did and Rhodey did, and everyone on the Avengers team, and Peter and Harley…” she trails off, and then shakes her head, coming back to herself. “You can’t quantify that. We all lost him, and so we all mourn. Together.”
And then Tony is there, warm presence pressing Steve into his sheets, and he kisses him again, undoing him with tongue and lips and teeth, and if the first kiss was tender, this one is liquid fire, setting Steve alight, and he can barely keep up, whimpering into Tony’s mouth…
And in turn Tony can blab on and on about his various experiments and Steve amazingly never seems to become bored. Sometimes Tony wonders if he’s even human, because it takes a special kind of wonderful to be able to deal with Tony’s constant jabbering. It’s warm and familiar and comfortable the way that few of Tony’s personal relationships are.
Steve watches through his own stinging eyes as Natasha goes back to staring out the window, the tears freezing on her cheeks.
space, even though he’s no longer around to claim it. Steve won’t intrude on this little bit of privacy, despite how much he wants to open the doors anyways, see the familiar screens and Iron Man suits one last time, even though he knows it might just rip at the wounds even further. He somehow feels like it would be a
What the fuck has he done?
“Punk.” Bucky grunts at him in that way Steve knows means he's happy to see him. Bucky grabs another yogurt and two spoons, sliding the second one over to Steve as he sits down. “So, you're finally back?”
Tony smiles when Steve falls into step beside him, and in no time at all, they make it down to the courtyard where the Sam, Bucky, Nat, Bruce, Peter and Clint are waiting along with Pepper and Rhodey.
He also enjoys causing havoc on twitter. Politically correct havoc of course, as Tara has to approve of the comments. Although Tara being just out of her teenage years herself, Tony is allowed to get away with quite a lot more than he expected.
“I hate you all.” He announces to the room at large, hiding a smile, and goes to get another beer, the sound of good natured ribbing following him to the dining table.
He knows this because it activating is probably the one thing that ended up saving his life, him slammed against the side of a building when the behemoth shoots out an arm, and he doesn’t have enough air in his lungs to even call for help, everyone is too far away, the wall around him cracking as it squeezes him-
“The Yinsen thing. I talked to Pepper today. Well. Actually, Pepper, Rhodey and Happy. Apparently they all knew. They don’t know everything of course, and I’m not sure I’m ready to disclose it all yet. I got some...working theories about why I froze up in the lab that I’m not ready to talk about but. Yeah.”
Steve grimaces. “I’m not entirely sure...we were talking normally and then suddenly Tony just froze and started babbling, and I re-ran the entire conversation in my head but I can’t pick out anything I said that would be particularly upsetting? But there’s a possibility I inadvertently did without realizing-” Steve breaks off with a sigh. “I never say the right things.”
“Uncle Steve?” a small voice calls from the stairwell one evening and Steve looks up from the book he’s reading to see Morgan clinging to the rungs of the stairs. Pepper is working late at the office today with Happy (who had been staying over more and more as well) so he had put Morgan down for the night, which apparently hadn’t stuck.
Never, in all the days Steve had spent in Tony’s company, had he thought it would end with this. With Tony here, both of them alive, telling him those words. Steve opens his mouth unsteadily to speak, to return the words, but Tony shakes his head, placing soft fingers against Steve’s lips, eyes sad and guilty.
“Breaking. The. Law.”
"Alright kiddies, out you go." He says swinging Elle up into his arms. She whines at him, and Tony grins. "Uncle Tony loves you sweetpea, but not enough to face the fury of your mother. Let's go."
All the Avengers are present to greet Shuri, including Steve, and then they all go sit in Bruce's lab once again as she scrolls through the systems.
After the first fifteen minutes of browsing through some Tumblr shitposting web pages randomly, Tony has to stop himself from rubbing his hands together and cackling like a bad Hollywood villain.
Steve manages. Tony probably realized Steve was still uncomfortable around him, and is obligingly leaving him alone, and again there's that combination of relief and guilt, but the end result is Steve being left to his own devices so he ignores it and keeps avoiding people.
Then he turns to Peter and Harley as the door shuts, still kind of bewildered. “I still don’t get why you guys are here though?”
to save me, you give
Steve had left feeling lighter than he had in ages.
"You have a lot of history with human Tony I think." He says quietly. "Why don't you start at the beginning."
This fic has grown into a monster really, I didn't expect it for it to go on this long and it has gotten so damn complicated XDD. It's gonna whoop my ass, but honestly, not that against it :)))
He closes his eyes tiredly. Great.
I got the fledgling of this idea from this fabulous fic that I sadly cannot remember the name of(I will credit when I remember because y'all should all go read it), but the point is, it was post infinity war, and everyone was happy and alive, and Tony decided to leave for space exploration so he made an AI of himself for the compound. It was beautiful, but it got me thinking about Endgame and thus this fic was born.
The subject - a name that starts with O, they’ve come here before to ask for help and Steve had tried so hard to remember, stayed up for hours repeating the names of all those he knows, but it’s so difficult sometimes - they thank him quietly, expressionlessly, and takes their leave, walking silently out into the piercing light, the wind howling and whipping past the open doors into the hall. It’s frigid, but Steve doesn’t shiver.

“Yes sir.”
"You saved my life." He says, "and I responded by yelling at you. You must be angry at that."
, and watches as the camera films a little girl putting down a wreath of roses in front of the memorial platform.
Steve lets out a laugh, startled. Bucky grins at him, clapping him on the back. “Seriously though, you okay?”
like Tony that it takes Steve’s breathe away, not aged a day since Steve had saw him last (maybe even younger?), every detail, every mannerism perfected, his voice, his eyes, the way he walks
“So...you know what it means?”
Tony lowers his head, defeated, and Steve can’t bear the despairing look on his face,
"Did you go in?” Pepper asks casually, no accusation in her tone, and rinses out the coffee cups. Steve looks at her, surprised at her assumption that the lab would unlock for him.
But back to the matter at hand, Steve had just come back from working on said mural and had barely closed the front door before Tony had darted forward from the kitchen, said hello with a quick kiss on the cheek, grabbed Steve’s messenger bag from off his shoulder, and then dragged Steve into the living room. It was everything Tony usually did when Steve came home, except at three times the speed, which made Steve immediately suspicious. Hence the current discussion.
Peter breaks off suddenly with a shout as he gets distracted with the explanation, is a second too slow. One of the spikes catches him in the side, slicing neatly through his webs and he goes down, hard, meeting the concrete sidewalk with a sickening cracking sound.
He’s not really sure
“You’ve got nothing to show either.” Tara responds and then lets out a squawk when Tony chucks a book at her.
“Why is this happening?” Tony asks, voice full of pain and guilt as he watches Steve watch the frozen figures.
“‘We all know what’s right, we all know what’s wrong,’” Lila and Clint shout together suddenly from the other side of the room, evidently having heard Steve’s exclamation.
"Who-" Bruce's voice is understandably shocked. There's a crackle of quiet static and then:
She pouts at him but Tony goes back to his tablet, trying not to smile again. Eventually, Tony hears her leave but pays no mind to it.
“It’s almost impossible to be a hundred percent certain of anything, those are great odds I just gave you.”
“Be. Scared. Of. Me.” he yells, clapping in between each word to emphasize his sentence. Tony snorts in response.
Steve suddenly feels a blast of energy slam him to the ground, taken completely by surprise, and he curses when he realizes he let himself get distracted. It’s painful, and he can feel where his skin is blistering and burning, but mortality wise, he’s still ok.
Natasha peels off from Steve and Tony when they finally bid Peggy and her husband goodbye after promising to visit again soon, citing that she wants to go fix up their disaster of a garden back at their place.
All in.
Tony’s gaze on him, because that’s just how intense it is, the way the AI is looking at him, eyes glimmering, and there can’t be tears, but it looks a hell of a lot like there is.
Steve startles out of his thoughts when he suddenly hears a distressed creaking sound and abruptly realizes he's made his way to the kitchen and had begun strangling the refrigerator door handle.
“Hello, Steve.” Tony Stark says, and smiles.
He grasps for a weapon desperately with the hand that’s still somewhat free, not entirely pinned by the grey substance, and his hand closes on the edge of the baton.
….but if you want my honest opinion on this...I….think you should...tell her?"
try and convince you to something you know is wrong’” Cooper, Cassandra and Nathaniel continue, dramatically throwing themselves across the back of the couch at the word turkey.
Bruce had quickly given them a run-down of everything he had told the Avengers when Happy, Pepper and Clint had come in through the door, with Pepper taking one look at AI Tony and turning as pale as a ghost. Steve had hurriedly helped her to a chair, and had gotten a shaky smile in response.
“Y’know.” Steve says sadly, thinking back to their first argument. “The...shutting out of the lab thing. And this. Everything.”
You in a way that's hard to explain.”
“I’m in love with you.” He whispers. “And I was almost too late. Rhodey’s the one who spotted you. We were out searching, and by the time we found you, your lips were blue and your hands were almost black and there was blood on your mouth and your breath was so shallow because the
Steve had seen the moment of Tony’s capture through his spell, but not his escape a week later with the rest of the prisoners within the castle, nor the final siege outside by the citizens of the Summer Kingdom, fighting a lost cause when Stane had a powerful sorcerer on his side, up until Steve’s storm had arrived and tipped the scales. It had left Tony’s side unharmed, and howled up through windows, wailing and tearing away until the West wall had collapsed, and guards and civilians alike streamed in to help.
He dumps the rather shocking amount of dust from the dustpan into an empty garbage can by one of the walls, and makes a note to remember to take that out when he leaves. Then he grabs a mop from the cupboard, and a bucket, and sets to swabbing the floor.
I could help you somehow, fly you away from this place. There are people outside who could help, Pepper employs a court sorcerer and there are other kingdoms if that won't work. I’ve wasted too much time though. I was angry when I crashed and saw you were still alive, after years of Howard searching for you, and scared and cowardly. I want to help now, but I’m not sure the month I still have left is enough to make a difference. I’m sorry. It might be too late.”
Tony hears Steve laugh as he picks up Morgan behind him, who greets him with a shout of "Papa!" and a kiss on the cheek.
He shuts the hangar door after them, and then goes upstairs, planning to get some sketching in, but he doesn’t even last ten minutes before he starts feeling the absence of human company acutely.
"I'm sorry."
“Because God knows human Tony had no qualms about hiding his injuries
Steve snorts, jumping into the fight. “You were listening in weren’t you?”
stop laughing.”
Steve, that’s completely wrong, this question makes no logical sense for a high schooler, what kind of-”
Tony at the beginning, how he had seemed amiably shocked to be laughing everytime Steve said something snarky, how Steve had tried to be as much of a little shit as possible, just to hear that laugh again.
“What’s the matter?” Tony’s voice has gone back to being devoid of all emotion. He is disturbingly good at that; at putting up his mask at a moment’s notice. “We decided at the beginning we’d talk to each other about our issues right? Total honesty. Because we’re such good
“Any day now Stark.” Tara comments from behind the camera, which prompts Tony to look up and stick his tongue out at the camera.
He tries to lever it between the wall and the unyielding swarm, tries to do
“-I was just anxious because I thought it was something
There’s no reasonable explanation for it, but, suddenly, he just feels so
But it’s not, and he has to figure this out, how things are gonna be now, because Steve’s the one who found him, who activated him, accident or no. He’s responsible.
“love…” Steve murmurs, and he tries his best to listen to Tony’s response, but he can’t concentrate beyond the pain slowly building in his chest, crescendo-ing into pure agony. His hands burn, and it’s only his inability to draw in breath that stops him from screaming.
Steve hopes he's not giving them shitty advice as he hesitantly continues, thinking through his words carefully. "Ha. Okaaay so, in the end it's definitely your call, well,
Rogers, and you know it. Y’know you didn’t stop glaring at me through the entirety of the fight?” Steve frowns, because he actually hadn't realized he was doing that.
“Nat.” Steve breaths, shoots up to envelope her in a hug.
Thanks for reading :)
(He resolutely ignores the whipped sound effects Clint makes from the kitchen when he assents)
He opens his eyes slowly, squinting a bit against the bright lights and sees Scott, Wanda and Bruce sitting at his bedside, still in their battered uniforms and gear, Bruce on the floor leaning against a wall since they don’t seem to have a chair reinforced enough for him yet.
As the room descends into petty squabbling and arguments and half-hearted death threats, Steve settles back contently, smiling as Tony grabs for his hand, intertwining their fingers. He kisses Tony on the forehead.
It takes a while before anyone else of their makeshift family shows up, and Tony is glad because he wants them to live a long and good life. He watches his daughter grow up, restart a company, fall in love and have a family of her own, gets special permission to be at Morgan’s wedding with Steve and Natasha when that comes, and then again after she brings his granddaughter home for the first time.
- but in reality, it’s because all the sketches are of Tony himself. And Steve isn’t sure what that means.
“Insane.” Steve mutters to himself, chuckling sadly, and he feels a sharp pang as he waves a hand through the holograms, shutting down the table again. God, he misses Tony.
“Really.” he says, voice dry as the Sahara, making clear that he doesn’t buy it for a second.
He hops onto the helicopter with a bunch of other SHIELD agents, inserting a comm into his ear, assorted weapons strapped at his hip and they arrive quickly on site. He doesn’t wait for anyone, and throws himself into the fight, moving civilians out of the way along with the other agents, who are trying to secure the location.
“Oh, just a
“Idiots.” she scoffs as Thor booms about how Autumn’s might is superior to all those present, and t’Challa threatens to turn Mjolnir into a bouquet of spring flowers.
Wanda had decided to make herself a referee since she was really the only one that could keep track of all the kills properly from her vantage point floating above the crowd. Also because her magic would kind of be cheating.
and Steve could almost
“What, what happened?” Harley asks, not looking up from where he’s doodling a picture of a spider on Peter’s cast.
“Roger, Rogers.” Bucky grunts, and Steve lets out a huff of laughter despite himself. There are hums of affirmation from everyone, a few laughs, and then it’s all serious battle tactics again.
Tony’s phone beeps after Tara finally shuts off the camera, already uploading the video into the computer. She raises her eyebrows at him, one headphone pressed to her ear as she listens to the recording.
Tony cling wraps the coffee maker, the faucet and the fridge, puts sticky notes with a smiley face on the bottom of all the computer mice in the house, covers the TV with more sticky notes, switches out all the sugar for salt and then watches with barely suppressed glee as Steve and Natasha fill all the plastic cups in the house with water and place them in parallel rows all around the living room floor, just close enough that it’d be almost impossible to walk between them. It’s useful being incorporeal, because as they walk around they don’t have to worry about knocking any of the cups over.
“Shut up and go back to discussing knife brands, you psychos” Tony responds, plopping himself down on the couch with a huff and the room rings with their laughter.
“Sometime today Jin if you please, I’m a busy guy.”
“Original flavour Tony?” Tony snorts in response, unbothered. “The fuck is he, Pringles??” and Steve relaxes incrementally, stifling his laughter with the hand that isn’t flipping pancakes.
Addresses to his people with full disclosure, repairing damaged architecture and helping those injured, and still bringing about the changing of the seasons to the mortal realm. It had been months sometimes before Tony and Steve could even meet, which resulted in arguments as doubt set in, and fear from their respective nightmares in the aftermath, until Tony had finally become fed up with the entire situation, marched his way to a clergy during one of their few meetings, with Steve in tow and demanded he marry them.
Steve opens his mouth to protest but Pepper shakes her head with a quiet “let me finish.”
Steve nods at that. Bruce is most definitely dumbing it down for them, but it makes sense.
but not
“I suggest your first song to be something humorous.” She says, completely ignoring everything Tony is saying.
“Whatever Steve.” Natasha laughs, interrupting him. “I’m going to go wake up the rest. Stay decent.” She points at Tony. “Talking to
.” Bucky pokes forlornly again at the empty coffee maker.
“With all due respect sir,” Steve eventually says. “I doubt a group consisting of a Norse God, a Super Soldier, a billionaire genius, a gamma ray expert, a skilled archer and two SHIELD agents can ever be considered relatable.”
“We’re not entirely sure what happened because Tony flew you to SHIELD medical and then had to book it before the press got here,” Bruce continues, and Steve can’t help but feel an irrational pang of sadness that Tony couldn’t be here, even though Steve knows there’s a good reason for it, that Tony can’t be seen by the public. “and the rest of the time we were concentrating on apprehending the rest of the villains, but by the time they got you stabilized you had severe chemical burns. The serum is the only reason you’re not dead.”
“Steve!” he says happily, “Look, I’m working on being ambidextrous.” Peter waves his pencil at him and then his smile turns a bit sheepish. “Actually, it could be going better but, well. Win some lose some.”
before you throw yourself back into danger-”
to you, just to make sure I'm ok, and I was too much of an asshole to realize it, but
Steve wakes up the next morning at around noon, refreshed and content.
“I’m sorry, what?” Tony looks up from his phone for the first time in the team meeting that afternoon in order to stare at Fury’s unimpressed face.
And after that, there’s not much talking for a very long time.
So like that, things progress. At some point, Steve goes to Manhattan for a day, considering the compound is still kind of removed from the busiest portions of the city, and visits Pepper and Happy in the SI offices, brings them some food, and they sit for a while and chat before Pepper has to head off to another meeting.
He shouldn’t have let his opponent take him off guard like that. Two years ago, maybe he wouldn’t have. Would have been more alert, not so quick to relax. If he’s going to keep leading in Sam and Bucky’s absence, he needs to clean up his act, get back into the mindset.
Bruce is surprisingly the one who ends up coming out to find him in the end. He takes one look at Steve’s face and knows. Because who else to understand rage and hurt, irrational anger that eats away at you,
No caption, but message received loud and clear. Tony laughs.
“Come on, whatever you want. I’m paying.”
“He forgave you Steve, I know he did. And who am I to disagree with him?” Steve laughs softly, ignoring the fact that it comes out a bit wet.
“She was a former HYDRA agent.” Steve tells them quietly, and everyone freezes, tension skyrocketing.
"Whatever decision you guys make, I'm sure it'll be the right one." He says confidently, and then follows them to the door to see them off, because they have to get back to Morgan, who is currently being looked after by a trustworthy neighbor.
“Never better,” Steve responds, and follows Bruce and Clint back into the fray.
“Yeah,” Steve grins at him, tired but happy. “I think we are.”
“Does it...hurt a lot?” the question comes, quiet and subdued, Tony’s voice tentative. Steve hums again, thinking.
” and Tony throws his hands up in exasperation. “What else would you have me call it?” he asks and Steve nods at that because, okay, fair point.
“-oh you don’t
Honestly, I spent most of the last week wrestling in a fight to the death with the plot of this story, trying to wrestle it into submission. Not entirely sure I succeeded, but here's hoping things make sense in the end XDD
“That kid is something else.”
be careful.”
Steve still has no idea what happened exactly, but he can’t imagine that it was very pretty.
Steve loses the second half of the sentence to static as he drifts.
Steve nods for Tony to continue when he hesitates.
Steve nods, accepting the answer. Tony nods once as well, as if to say “good” and then shifts away to sit back up. After a couple seconds, Steve follows.
“I - wait.”
"Nothing." Steve responds haltingly, remembering it's rude to not say anything when you can't think of anything to say. A stupid rule in his opinion. If he has nothing to say he shouldn't be expected to speak.
“Can you tell me what exactly happened?” Steve asks, changing the subject for the time being. “I was unconscious for most of the time I was falling.”
oh lord the
I’m alive right now because of you.”
“No.”
Tony waits for Steve’s nod before he takes his hand away. And then he pauses, looking unsure of what to say now that Steve’s fallen silent.
myself make that judgement, it’s not my place. It’s Tony’s.
“Uncle Steve! Uncle Steve!” She giggles as Steve picks her up and swings her around.
“He could have texted me this.”
did he not think of this before? “Wait, you should talk to her then! If she already knows, that’ll probably help right? Then you won’t have to explain as much -”
“Okay.” He says eventually, face unreadable once again. “Let’s meet.”
I’ve ever seen before. And Tony - human Tony had allowed me to take a look at Jarvis’ systems once, because I was curious about it. Even Vision wasn’t like this, although he’s the one that comes closest.” Bruce gives Wanda an apologetic expression when he mentions Vision and Wanda gives him a wan smile in return.
holding up?! Steve what the hell.”
“Sorry,” she says, amusement lighting up her eyes, removes her hand before her expression shifts to something more serious. “It’s okay. Look, I’ll admit. I was kind of furious when I had heard what had happened.”
“Well it's about fucking time.” And Steve laughs at the echo of Happy's words.
Natasha runs in with a kitchen knife in hand, and Tony feels a bubble of fond amusement for her because even in the
Steve admits he had been expecting Tony to just go about his business like all of his other subjects do in this place, but instead, Tony follows Steve around everyday to each of his duties.
Reinstating someone on the throne in Summer’s side had not been easy afterwards. There was talk of joining together the two kingdoms now that their two kings are married, but that would be impractical, and Tony had been adamant in his decision to make Pepper the new queen. Pepper had argued with him for hours on that one.
A sidenote though: I'm gonna be heading back to China to visit relatives for two weeks, starting tomorrow, and probably won't be able to post anything during that time period, which is why I'm posting a new chapter today. At least the vacation time will give me ample opportunity to write lol.
the highlight of my day.”
By the time Steve has finished cutting up all the fruit and laying out the plates, most of the Avengers have trickled into the kitchen, all gathered around the kitchen table, talking quietly and laughing, Peter included, who, with Aunt May’s permission, had crashed at the compound for the night because of how exhausted he had been. Bucky has returned to some resemblance of a human being, and is now in conversation with Sam and Wanda. Bruce is making some more coffee, and Peter and Harley are scribbling on Peter’s cast with a sharpie. Tony has drifted over and is making commentary on what they’re writing over their shoulders, him and Harley snarking at each other.
Bucky jumps a mile in the air with a shout and simultaneously chucks a container of yogurt at Steve's head automatically, which he catches with ease.
Tony had started creating and running algorithms with Bruce the day after the call to assemble in an attempt to track her down, but had so far not been able to find much on her movements. They don’t have much to go on after all, just a physical description, a vague outline of her abilities, and the knowledge that she used to work for HYDRA.
It’s the contraption
“...yes I did.”
in control of all the arrivals and departures though?”
Steve notices distantly that his words are now coming out almost as sobs, as he gasps harshly, tears streaming down his face, "- talked to Sam when he got too in his head, and you even kept track of
Clint takes another sip of his beer, staring out of his window, unaware of how Steve’s mind is reeling.
He breaks around the five minute mark, and goes to grab his SHIELD uniform, because he’s not going to sit this out if he can help it.

Steve tempers his reaction, and settles for a restrained nod as Tony makes a full circuit of the room. “That’s amazing, Tony.”
Tony pesters her the entire way there, wherever there happens to be, because Natasha is apparently the same Natasha afterlife or otherwise, and refuses to tell him where they’re going. He tries to wheedle it out of her, but her poker face remains legendary, even as a retired superspy.
about it." Steve snarls back viciously, finally dropping his mild facade, and Tony's still glaring, but Steve doesn't stop, on a roll now, the anger having festered to a boiling point, bottled up. "It's been two years since the final battle with Thanos and I thought I was finally
They need you.”
Steve paces around restlessly for an entire hour after that, unable to keep still, feeling like his skin is crawling with guilt. He needs to go apologize
“Of course sir.” Jarvis’ voice is dry as the desert.
Everyone seems to just be chatting idly when they enter, and Tony glances towards the door, his face lighting up when he sees Peter holding Morgan.
Tony clears his throat awkwardly. He looks incredibly uncomfortable now.
“You good?” Steve asks Tony, looking him over worriedly for injuries.
He makes sure to take time for himself when he feels like he needs it, overly conscious of the fact that this friendship between him and Tony is tentative at best, still a fragile, delicate thing. He does the same old thing he always does(Steve never claimed to be a particularly exciting guy), goes for runs around the compound, sketches on the balconies, continues with training for Peter and Harley, works out in the gym, and when he feels like he’s fine, he’ll wander back, ready to rejoin the fray. Tony seems to understand, and leaves him to it.
Rhodey, Happy, Pepper and Morgan are all waiting there when Steve finally arrives; he gets tackled by Morgan, says a warm hello to everyone else (hugs all around) and leads the way to the living room sedately, thoroughly worried despite himself. He’s not the only one, Morgan might be the only person who is actually relaxed at the moment, her tiny hand in Steve’s where she had grabbed it upon entering, swinging their arms and humming happily.
Steve gets that expression on his face that means, ‘I would be rolling my eyes at you if I wasn’t so polite’. “So you want to tell me why Tara went upstairs to help me cook lunch but ended up mutilating a bunch of carrots instead?”
His sleep is restless, but at least he doesn’t dream.
“You called some people...over the intercoms?” he croaks weakly. “...with your current voice?”
fact, but after the emotional turmoil of the last week, Steve’s surprised it doesn’t dissolve into hysterics. The laughter does feel good though, despite that.
“Good talk Rogers.” Tony murmurs, and then blinks out, leaving Steve to stare at his empty room with a million questions buzzing under the surface of his skin.
“Not everything is about you Stark.” Natasha smirks, rolling her eyes. Then her expression softens into a smile. “I’m glad you two had a good time though, you guys deserve it.” Then her expression shifts into one of unholy glee. “Don’t know if there’s STDs here though so use protection. Have fun, shut the windows, I’ll be out back with earphones in if you need me.”
"I was so
Mature and healthy conversations between the two of them. Steve never thought he’d see the day.
“What was that you said about ‘since I saw you five days ago’?”
, I just-”
“Breakfast and a show.” He simpers, hand to forehead like he’s swooning, and Steve laughs harder, finally taking a seat at the table. The team has left an empty one for Tony, which has become a habit, even though Tony doesn’t need one, because it’s really the principle of the matter. It’s a bit like leaving an empty seat for an imaginary friend Steve has to admit, but allows Tony to join in on their conversations (from the little Steve had seen anyways, since he had spent a lot of time hiding in his room) in his holographic form so they do it anyways.
There’s a gentle whispering of cool wind, the sound of leaves rustling. Light filters in through the canopy, spreading dappled colour behind closed eyelids. The ground is blessedly cool beneath him, the sunlight wonderfully warm above.
"Have you seen Elle?" He asks, still panting. "We're leaving in fifteen minutes."
Yes, I gave Tony a Tumblr, because he's literally a walking shitpost and I love it.
“‘There’s one thing that will always give you an edge’” Ned continues along with Peter.
"No." Tony finally declares with a playful grin. "I'm not bothering you at all, your Highness. In fact I am a
“I’m...worried. That something’s wrong. In the AI systems error kind of way.”
“Well, after so long, let’s just say I’m as well-rested and ready as I could be.”
betrayal, even though logically he knows that makes no sense. Logic has shit to do with it.
can't pay for dinner. That's not how bribing works.”
Steve hums. “Sam and Bucky aren’t here right now, but other than that, no mission. Although...have you checked in with Tony to see if he’s okay with it?” Steve hedges, since the AI hadn’t exactly been in a talkative mood earlier, to put it lightly.
, I'll have you know. Everyone says so. Well, not Pepper, but...she’s with Rhodey and not me, so her judgement can’t really be trusted, now can it?”
“Lord help us, Barton as a father?” Tony laughs. Clint releases Tara from his hug in order to glare at Tony for max effect.
This time was...different. This time it wasn't any idea or interest that had caused Tony to leave, to shut everything out. Something had really shaken him, and Steve thinks back to the way Tony had looked; like he had the air punched out of him, heartbroken and mourning and desperate.
Not just a person. A man. And the most beautiful man Steve’s ever laid eyes on, at that.
When Steve wakes up again, he’s no longer outside.
Usually I write a longer end note, but it's kind of 2 am where I am and I have to wake up early tomorrow so I'm just gonna sign off here XDD. Expect some minor edits in the last two days, since I've re-read this chapter for spelling and grammar mistakes but I'm very sleep deprived so there's only so much I can catch lol. You all have been wonderfully patient with me and I appreciate it :) <3
"Good morning Tony," Steve says, putting his pencil to paper again, and shading in the trunk of a far off tree. "What's up?"
“Kill me.” Tony squeaks.
Steve’s first instinct, his first reflex is to blush and splutter, and honestly Steve probably still blushes a bit, but it’s been several years since he’s become friends with original Tony, several years since he’s been someone that would fluster easily with a couple of well said words. Steve instead quickly schools his expression into a blank look. His conversations with Tony might still be a bit awkward at times, still not sure what he's allowed to say, not wanting to break the unstable friendship with a wrong sentence, but
Tony hums, contemplative, and Steve breaks off.
“It’s alright,” Steve says quietly, gives them a reassuring smile. “I’ll tell you guys later, but we’re good now. I’m good.”
"That's quite a lot of words for one expression to communicate." Steve interrupts mildly, but Tony half talks over him, on a roll.
“Traitor,” Steve mumbles, grinning and tossing Tony a helmet.
“Just let me sulk in peace woman.”
“Oh honey,” he whispers as Morgans face scrunches up, and she starts crying, small sobs that break his heart all over again. She flings herself at Steve, who obligingly pulls her into a hug, setting aside his book, tears welling up in his own eyes. But no, he can’t let her see them, he has to stay strong.
It’s time to stop living in the past. This is his home now.
, the tradeoff of challenges,
It’s at this point that Steve realized that he could no longer feel Tony’s presence beside him and turned to see him heading sedately to the lake. He gave him a couple more minutes alone, before finally following behind.
"Anyone got any suggestions about how to take this down once and for all?" Wanda gasps, red magic swirling as she tries to hold back a portion of the mass.
Steve puts his hand over Tony’s mouth and Tony glares at him, to which Steve responds with a cheeky smile.
It’s utter hell and chaos before it finally happens, all muted yells, and strategy, and desperate scrambling for the upper hand as everyone fights with every single ounce of strength and skill that they’ve got. The fate of the universe balanced on a knife’s edge, the executioner’s axe waiting to fall.
." He pleads, pretty much begging on his knees at this point, and he falls silent, breathes heavy and sharp, because there's nothing else he can say.
He talks a bit with Shuri before she leaves to go hang out with Peter, Harley and Wanda ("what, I'm gonna fly all the way to New York and
doing this mission alone?”
“How horrifyingly domestic,” an amused voice says as Steve moves to put the bread knife away, and he turns to see Tony there beside him, expression happy and open, smiling easier than he had a couple hours ago. Steve grins in response, brandishing the knife he’s still holding at the hologram.
“I lost
“I’m surprised how good you are at this,” Tony comments idly as he watches Steve put together a delicate piece of wiring, hands hovering as if he wants to help but can’t. “Even Bruce had trouble at times- wait careful there,
They pop into existence at the edge of the forest near the lake, and locate Pepper and Happy at the back of the house, sitting on the porch swing in quiet companionship. Pepper is reading a book, leaning happily against, well, Happy, who’s tapping calmly at a Stark tablet. Steve smiles at the domestic scene before them, glad that they found each other.
“Don’t look at me like that.” Tony puts a hand on his chest in fake affront. “I can be nice. Maybe.”
to let you go.”
Steve watches Morgans face as Tony says his final goodbye, and he feels his heart break all over again for the little girl who doesn’t quite understand what’s happening, but is smart enough to know that this is the end, the last time she’ll see her dad. That he’s not coming back. The grief tightens like a vice at that thought, and Steve feels like he can’t breathe.
“You know this means war.” She says to Happy, eyes glinting mischievously, and he shakes his head in response, grinning, “I’d expect nothing less. I suppose we’re bringing Rescue out of retirement?”
Tony pouts at him, feigning a hurt expression, which Steve also doesn’t believe for a second, despite how unintentionally cute the look is.
“I’m fine.” he whispers. “Why do you ask?” Steve sighs in response, and settles on the soft ground next to him.
“Punk,” Bucky reiterates. “Why am I friends with you.”
Now he just lies there amidst comfy sheets, perfectly content where he is, reluctant to move. He feels lazy, and happy, the bone deep exhaustion and weight from yesterday gone. The sunlight filters in from the window, and Steve watches the play of light beams dappled on the ceiling and his bedsheets. His hand itches to sketch it, the dance of rays shining in through the curtains, dust particles floating through the air, peaceful.
“Um, am I the only one that seems to realize that this is a bad idea?” Tony asks, choosing to glare at Clint instead of the collective team as a whole. Glaring at Natasha is always a bad idea, and everything is usually Clint’s fault.
He lets himself get lost in the rhythm of cooking, hideous pink apron back on as he works to prepare a meal big enough for everyone.
Tony feels like shit the next morning.
Tony had said, nudging Steve and Natasha smugly) and then proceeded to prank the shit out of the rest of the Avengers (most of which were out for the day, although Bruce apparently remained in the compound laboratory).
“Not a known one, beyond a love requited.” Tony lowers his hand. “That’s not going to happen.”
Steve curls his fingers and lowers his hand a bit awkwardly, shifting under Tony’s unblinking gaze. He’s staring at Steve like he’s seen a ghost.
Steve nodded in understanding. “Natasha told me once, about how she had felt about the Avengers, how it made her better, how she was still trying to
“I gave over command of my kingdom to Pepper. I had wanted to do that for ages, even before the curse. I was not a good King, not a good person, and Pepper had always handled it better than me. She deserves it.”
“And the others?” Pepper prompts, taking a sip of her coffee.
He wants him to go back to his Pepper and his Rhodey, wants him to be happy in his Kingdom of Summer once again, once he realizes that Steve is a lost cause, that there’s nothing he can do. Once Steve finally goes, whichever one gets him first, and Tony can be free of his burden of Steve and whatever misplaced sense of obligation he seems to have, and be happy again.
It’s only a couple minutes before Tony is thrashing again, kicking off the covers, whimpering helplessly, and Steve feels something inside him roil at the sight of Tony in so much pain, moves forward enough to hear the mumbles, “burning up - air - I can’t -”
“Is Uncle Steve a mummy now?” Morgan suddenly asks out of nowhere, and Steve startles a bit before he starts laughing, Pepper and Bruce joining in as well. Morgan frowns at the lot of them, confused.
He watches as Steve gets on the launch pad of the machine with that expression on his face, and Tony’s not surprised that Steve manages to change the game entirely just like he always does. He’s glad that he gets to live out a happy life, if not a bit perplexed.
“-get the healer-”
“Hmm. Last I heard you were supposed to be taking it easy.”
He startles out of his thoughts when a hand settles on his shoulder.
Tony likes her already.
Steve, we thought you were done for. If Tony hadn't been there-"
Days of light and honest work, making gentle snows and ice during the winter months for the humans. Walks across seasons, living and laughing and loving. Fractured memories as a kid in the palace, his mother’s smiles, his father’s laughter. Spinning frost across fingertips with childish delight. He can’t recall much beyond it, beyond that feeling of intrinsic happiness, and even that is fading quickly.
He frowns.
By the time he recovers, the kid is gone, and Steve is already at his side undoing the zip-ties. Tony can see Natasha step out briefly to update the team.
, Steve had known him once, considered him a friend, shaken his hand - he had taken the throne by force, had been slowly weeding in his own people for decades without anyone noticing.
“Just...one of those days.” He says softly, going back to tapping away at his schematic. Steve doesn’t say anything in response, and the silence stretches, punctuated by the soft clicks of Tony typing away at the keyboard.
"Not really thinking much." he lies, instead thinking way
“...why are you yelling at me.” Steve says after a moment of tense silence, not letting himself respond to the barb. He hadn’t noticed when he had first walked into the room, focusing more on how tired Tony had appeared to be, but now that Steve looks closer, he can see how tense Tony actually is; face drawn; hackles risen, as if rearing for a fight.
“Why don’t you ever smile?” Tony had asked sadly one of those days, his hand coming up idly, and Steve jolts as fingers brush against his lips. They tingle with warmth, coming to life underneath Tony’s fingertips, and Steve is shocked from the feeling, so he takes a hasty step back. Tony blinks as if coming out of a trance, and hurriedly drops his hand.
The man, in turn, seems to be waiting for some kind of reaction from him, but Steve hasn't the faintest idea of what.
“No kidding,” he answers, voice a weak croak, and he wipes at his face again, the tears drying on his cheeks, realizes now how gross he feels, still not changed out of his ripped and battered SHIELD uniform, tired and sweaty. He’s very glad the AI doesn’t have a sense of smell, because Steve can’t imagine he’s very pleasant to be around right now.
“-do you hear me!? You’re
“Stark no.” Sam says firmly, and Tony again looks startled, mouthing the word Stark confusedly, “Sorry, that was Tony’s last name, force of habit. We don’t
“Yeah, she would.”
There’s that familiar voice counting in his ear, and Steve grasps onto the sound desperately, tries to match his breathing to it, tries to calm himself, and it takes a few false starts, but he eventually manages, breaths matching closer and closer.
“My king?” the servant says tonelessly.
As days go, it’s not the worst. Not unbearable. But it’s definitely not one of the good ones either.
