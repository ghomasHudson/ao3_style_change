“I am Heimdall, the guardian of the door.” He nodded politely at the mortal representatives, who squirmed some more under his gaze. “I come for the Worthy One”
So Thor was pouting, what of it?
And Steve did, he felt his real hand come up to grasp it, probably making a fool of himself for the God’s amusement. Still, all self-consciousness was drowned out as he took hold of the chain and it hit him like a train wreck.
Poison and Daggers, Steve laughed humorlessly, an edge of panic showing as he leaned over the sink for a long moment. He hadn’t had so many assassination attempts since WWII France!
“Yes Captain?”
Thor gave a small tug to her chin, raising her eyes to meet his own and smiled. “Aye”
“… What are those apples, really?”
“I do not want to marry the Captain”
“Here you come again” Loki sighed, his face blank behind his book and not even bothering looking up at the looming God of Thunder “What happened and why should I care?”
“This is ridiculous” Another one spouted “We can’t just give him over without any guarantee”
“How did he?”
“Aye, Loki bore them out of his own magic, under the teachings of the cursed witch Amora.” Thor frowned at the mere mention of that cursed woman, how she had taken Loki under her wing and deformed his very soul… “For all that Loki is selfish and proud, he treasures his creations above all. As he should. They are magnificent and powerful creatures, my nephews. The amount of magic and skill alone to bring them to life…”
Steve fought the blush that burned his cheeks as he picked a small potato with his fork “Thanks a lot Tony”
Thor’s voice croaked, shaken to the very core and on the verge of soiling his Father’s carpets as he caught Odin’s unwavering gaze, for the first time in his long life, he did not recognize the man before him.
-----
Steve let out a loud breath, his head hanging low as he panted. “I don’t know, I told her to leave, she was hurt…”
After the intense round in the common room, they had both limped into his bedroom and into the shower, where they had cleaned the other with exploring, painfully careful hands; until Tony’s dick started to get excited again.
LIMP!” Steven gasped in deep offense, brows rising high at the nerve of the God.
The Mother of God pursed her lips, a small twitch to her cheek belaying her pleasant exterior. Steve was careful to keep his back to the wall as they parted ways, purposely smiling and waving cheekily at the blushing maidens until they were out of sight. Steve sighed heavily as he entered his rooms, sprinting for the bathroom where he poured out the vial on to the sink, almost expecting smoke to come out or the liquid to eat out the ceramic like acid.
“Steven!” The God cried in alarm, shooting forward to hold his betrothed with startled but gentle hands.
Then, three days later. Steven summoned Thor for an afternoon, out of the blue as they had not agreed to any outings as the Captain began to attend his lessons. Thor frowned at the poor maiden that delivered the request and marched determinedly to the meeting point the Soldier had cited. Far in the forest of Asgard, by a river clearing where Steven had felled the Beast.
Steven shot Thor a flustered look, but nodded graciously, nonetheless. “The pleasure is mine ma’am”
“Ha!” Thor roared at his Betrothed’s dumbstruck face “
Odin clasped a hand to the Captain’s shoulder warmly “None of that my boy, you are my family now. You may call me by my given name.”
The Director answered with a daring arch of his brow as he stepped impossibly closer to the giddy God “Good, ‘cause I won’t hesitate to come up here and remind you.”
“Steven, meet Tanngnjostr and Tanngrisnir.” Thor boomed proudly, entering the stall with an excited step and crouching down with arms open wide “Come here you handsome beasts!” The goats sprinted forth and knocked the God on his back with a combined headbutt, causing Thor to erupt in elated laughter as he took hold of their horns and bumped their heads to each other in greeting, turning then to his bemused spouse with a proud grin. “They will pull our cart.”
Captain America climbed the steps to his Betrothed’s side, clothed in a skin tight uniform of dark azure scales of tornasol armor shifting from marine blue to blood red with every shift and clench of the Soldier’s muscles, all accentuated and laid naked in stark relieve under the armored suit; a lone, snow white star in the middle of his wide chest. His beautiful physique, perfect in every way, strong and unapologetic for all to admire and
“It is done” He said, catching his son’s eye and tapping his staff as a wordless command “For Asgard”
“No, that’s impossible I…” Steven blinked and sprung forward, pulling Thor’s sleeve up and revealing the cards he himself had stolen and hidden under the coffee table at the beginning of the round. Thor smirked wickedly at the Captain.
“Yet.”
“None at all, sweet rabbit.” Thor said gently, turning to pull the Captain away from Groot as the tree had produced a large sack and was attempting to guide the laughing Soldier into it, despite Drax and Gamora’s scolding objections.
Thor had bolted, ripping Mjolnir from Steve’s frozen hand and promptly jumping into the thundering skies. Where once had been sunshine and infinite blue, now poured down in heavy, stinging raindrops, vicious, harsh winds and thunderbolts.
“And you limp.” Thor bargained.
Odin nodded “I see emissaries, noble men and women, generals and royals of the nine realms and beyond. All come to witness the union of Gods.”
As he saw Steven clasp hands with the Man of Iron, he held his head high and fought back the wave of troubled feelings as he was once more confronted by that particular problem he had overlooked. The only comfort the God held now was that those feelings were strictly one-sided. Steven was still only his, now and forever.
“I am Groot!” The tree spoke calmly.
“A warrior and a lover” The blond weasel sighed, besotted “A man after mine own heart!”
Frigga smiled at him and kissed his thin lips lovingly, pulling him gently out of Steve’s rooms with only a worried glance backward to her wounded son, kneeling and bleeding on the polished marble floor. Steve’s heart went to her and tried to meet her eyes, to let her know not to worry, that he would look after her son. That he was
The Man of Iron passed the large basket of steaming breads with a truly jubilant grin, dying quickly as the Captain extended his hand to the pile and caught sight of the blaringly obvious addition.
“Today you come of your own free will” The All father continued “Responding to the calling of your souls. Today I, Odin, son of Bor, King of Asgard and protector of the nine realms, answer your plight. Today, I bless you to become one…”
“I’m not the guy from the comics, Tony” Steve groused out tiredly, as if he had had this conversation one time to many “nor Howard’s war stories.” He shrugged halfheartedly “I’m just another man”
Kudos!
Loki nodded nonchalantly “Expected”
Loki nodded, face unreadable.
Steve pursed his lips to silence his inquiries and nodded, attaching the small communicator onto his belt under Fury’s watchful eye.
“Hot damn!” Quill laughed “Captain America’s got game!”
He flew at max speed, pushing the limits of the armor until the joints wheezed and protested. and then he pushed more. He saw the live feed of the UN chambers, how the blue helmets and neighboring armies began to gather around the growing forces of Asgard.
“Heimdall, by the Norn’s!” Thor crowed, dismounting his stallion with a booming laugh of glee “He did that to you?”
“Only doing my part for men and Country”
Mistress Eir sighed and handed him a much smaller, useful, hammer “Here, use this”
Thor shrugged “I am an honorless hooligan, you see?” He smiled widely to disguise the hurt that laid beneath “No virtue to fret over, Captain”
Thor startled back from his Mother’s hold, flushing bright crimson as he groused embarrassingly “Mother please…”
The Guardians say their Goodbyes, Thor gives the gift of the Gods and Steve daydreams.
“Odin!”
“I should have worn the dress” Thor moaned under his mother’s swift hands. Frigga did not even need to look back to know Loki had yet another insult at the ready, which she smothered with a stern hand in the air. She faintly heard another affronted huff from her younger son and pressed herself to finish her task before she too could lose her head.
“I’m going to look like a right fool. But this is the only formal suit I have; the uniform is pretty shredded from yesterday” The man shrugged his ridiculously wide shoulders “It’s probably more appropriate anyways”
Where does your wedded duty start and your friendship end? Was he hurting him more by refusing him or would giving in to what they both wanted be a greater sin?
Loki leveled him with a haughty glare and a pout “What exactly is your definition of ‘Harm’?”
“That’s on Earth, you idiot.” Fury snarled, gun still at the ready though his posture not as threatening as before, his dark orb eyeing the intruders, measuring and calculating “What’s a human doing here?”
“I know this” The Captain confirmed “Because I know that if it had been the other way around, I would have called you”
“Not necessarily” Frigga offered, her eyes scanning the room in uncertain glances as to how she could word her worries and the need for such formalities.
Steven grinned, that devious curl of lips that never failed to make Thor’s blood boil, and took the Giant’s hand in his own “As I’ll ever be, on the count of three”
Thor pulled a pair of trousers on blindly, invoking Mjolnir to his hand at the same time before he followed Steven down the many stories of the Palace walls and scurried under the night sky out and deep into the woods in ever growing dread as the distance grew further and further from the safety of Asgardian civilization.
“If you get married, who is going to be the girl?”
“Will you stay? I-  I don’t want to be alone tonight.”
the hell out of the Captain. Right there, on the flimsy terrace table in that hole in the wall restaurant. Hell, by the looks of it, even the Hulk had the hots for the Soldier.
He screamed as he felt her inner walls tighten again, like a vice, soaking him as she squirted on his cock.
Thor shrugged as he went back to setting the goats into their leases “Loki and I made them immortal… Accidently.”
Master Bragi glared, but did not budge. Steven would not receive singing classes. Thor was relieved and intrigued in equal measures, he began to plot ways to convince the Captain to gift him a song in one of their future courting days…
After those three days, Thor was next spotted in Texas. Dropping from the skies like a meteorite into the center of a Rodeo. Lightning sparked from his iridescent orbs, prompted startled cries of the spectators and nervous shuffles of the animals in the circle.
“We’ll see about that” Steve surged forward, instead of striking with the sword at the waiting monster, he threw the whole thing at the horned head and slipped to the floor, swiping the Thing’s feet from under it with a powerful kick. The Monster fell with a grunt, both swords falling to the side and out of reach.
“No, that was…” Steven scratched the back of his neck, his eyes avoiding Thor’s as they walked side by side and out of the council rooms “Really swell of you to do, Thor”
Odin nodded and walked out of the Throne room, matters settled and moving on to the next appointment in his court. Frigga glared at her husband and shook a haughty finger at her smiling son. “We will have words, you and I”
“Aye!” Thor agreed eyes bright with joy “For the Captain”
It was his husband, after all.
Thor dropped the sword and every pretense of calm as he turned to Frandal with a mighty glare, but the little gremlin was not done. “Perhaps it is not in your nature to pay attention to your lover’s wants” Thor clenched his fists to the side as thunder flashed in the distance, Frandal’s smile softened it’s wicked edges “Lucky for you, I did, and I promised to aid you in your courting so as much as it
“I’m spending my last day on Earth with my family, good day, Sir”
Steven huffed a disbelieving laugh at the audacity of the God and rubbing a chagrinned hand over his flushed face. “How did you even?”
Thor turned in a slow circle, mentally counting the bodies in the crowd and smiling. Over 600 humans.
Steven shrugged, self depicting “Can’t say that I have”
The All Father smiled patiently at his irate son, turning to gaze upon the room filled with their people and family “Tell me Thor, what do you see?”
The next hours Tony spent making sweet, tender love to Pepper, showering her with kisses and caresses as if he could erase all the hurt and uncertainty from her skin if he could just cover every inch of it with love.
The God shook his head resolutely, hand curling pensively under his bearded chin “No, that’s not right, it isn’t good enough. Try harder.”
“I’m not stupid Stark, we are going to lose a legend in the next days, but we still have you” Fury set his disturbingly sharp glare on Tony, full of expectation and something close to respect “Why do you think I gave you those papers, I could’ve well gone out of my way to let the council know of the Captain’s real rights, but I gave them to you instead.”
“This” Thor boomed, waves of electricity crawling around his feet there where he stood, arms set wide to envelop the damage he had wrought  “Is my reckoning, let it be known that anyone who dares touch my betrothed without his consent will suffer the wrath of the mighty Thor.”
“Thank you, General, that was real swell of you.”
“Yeah, that’s Howard for you” Tony winced, turning away to give the Captain a moment to regain his composure, he stared at the New York skyline. “Anyways, that’s over now, you’re your own man” Tony swallowed around the knot forming in his chest as he finally willed himself to look back at Steve, gorgeous, perfect,
The fallen soldiers would guard the UN council faithfully for many centuries to come. Gone, but not forgotten.
“I’m starting to get used to that by now” The Captain replied with a cheeky smile as he eyed the still sentimental Doctor kindly “You sure you don’t want to stay? You know you are always welcome here, Bruce.”
“You fancy yourself wiser than the Norn’s, Boy!” Odin thundered, turning fully now to his son, his imperturbable mask fallen and now facing Thor with open anger, at his son or himself, it was uncertain. “It should have been an impossible task, for a mortal to be worthy. What I vowed, the magnitude of the act; you have no idee do you, my child?”
“I have requested your presence as an important decision has been made this very morning” Odin nodded at the silent Director to his side and his strangely gloom wife. Thor began to fidget under the uncertainty.
“He especially enjoyed the pie” Thor crooned, his heated voice blowing softly in the Captains flushed ear. Steve shuddered as the hot breath hit his blushing face and fought to stay still under Thor’s groping hands.
Thor grinned blindingly bright for his parents, extending his bejeweled hand forward proudly “Midgardian tradition, wedding bands they call them.” He allowed his Mother to take his hand in her own as he turned his enamored eyes to his husband “Steven made them for us.”
The AI’s voice resounded from the room’s speakers, loud and omnipresent. Startling the men in the room as it drowned the place in it’s soft, English croon “As of this minute, Mr. Stark, you are worth 25 trillion dollars and rising. A slow day, sir.”
-----
Both groups fell into a conspicuous silence as they nudged one another, eyeing the halted step of the Captain and Thor’s own proud gait with variating degrees of mirth and horror.
The captain nodded and with a tantalizing flex of muscles, he pulled with all his might.
“Yep” Pepper popped. Her freckles lost in the full blush that covered her naked skin. “It was… uh… really…”
Thor’s throat closed and worked viciously around the knot that formed, finally croaking out with a watery smile “Thank you, Father”
-----
“Yeah, yeah” The doctor appeased as the three walked out of the common room “You too, Clint”
Chapter 7: God vs. Legend.
Steven nodded and smiled openly for the Overseer, who if Thor did not know better, had a dazzled look on his face afterwards.  Thor shot the Captain a queer look.
“You wished to be an artist.” Thor realized, his thoughts going back to Frandals assessment and cursing the little cunt once again for being right, and then himself thrice for not listening. Steven shrugged once more, self-depicting as he should never be.
just call Captain America a slut.”
He realized then it wasn’t a simple crush, he was in love with the Captain and he hadn’t even seen it coming.
ordered an attack that killed hundreds of Human soldiers.”
The Captain convulsed under him, his legs scrambling under Thor’s weight. The God kissed the abused bundle and continued his exploration of the wonder that was his husbands body, the hand that had held his head now resting on the headboard above the Captain’s head; keeping him in place, anchoring him under Thor’s heated ministrations as the Soldier looked up at him with flustered, surprised eyes.
Tony grunted and groaned, pressing in and rolling his hips in place, letting her feel his length rub at her convulsing walls, prolonging her orgasm until she went blue in the face. Then he began to thrust.
“Breakfast?” Steven attempted, almost questioning.
This chapter broke my heart, I wrote it while listening to Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds-Into my Arms.
Then Odin walked forward, his heavy steps silencing the bubbling chatter of the court as he spoke to the Mortal man “You are a man of skill, Captain. I thank you for this marvelous gift, it is a fine courting piece as any I have ever seen. A good omen of your nuptials.”
Steve saw as the serpent blinked its many eyelids and for a second looked heartbroken, an expression so strange on an animal with so little features but so clear on Jormungandr. Thor reached forth and placed a comforting hand on the serpent’s snout and offered a bright, loving smile.
Tony felt his heart fall and quake and he knew, he
Thor had kissed him.
Jane’s voice began to break at the end. Thor’s heart crumbled to hear it. “We can still have this, us, while we can, just don’t-“
Tony’s hand convulsed on Steve’s chest, a choked sound of gut deep despair leaving his mouth, his face a rictus of agony. As abrupt as it came. Tony swallowed it down, his face closed off, he backed away.
Steve poked his head out of his silken cocoon. “And there’s a whole lot a’ floor for you, Loki.”
“Oh no” Fury smacked his lips, shaking his head calmly “I am here to listen.”
“Goodnight, Steven”
Chapter 28: Sentimental.
Just as Frandal was about to jump into the ring in his excitement and Thor was to throttle him for his impertinence, a dozen soldiers arrived at the sparing grounds, announcing the request of the King for Thor and Steven’s presence in the Throne room. Thor glanced at his now contemplative Intended and nodded at the committee. “We will meet him at once.”
The tree nodded along and pushed the human, non to gently to the side, before taking the Captain’s hand and shaking it vigorously “I am Groot.”
“The worthy one, bring him to me”
“It’s not mine” Steven clarified, as if it were a consolation, then grimaced as Thor probed a sluggishly bleeding gash at his shoulder “Well most of it isn’t”
Steve could feel the heavy gaze of the God on him, and he reluctantly turned to meet it, only to find that the All Father wasn’t looking at him, but at the other odd one out in the room.
Love, the author.
“Lord All Mighty!” Steve gasped, paling at the sight of the disfigured Dark Guardian, a long fingered hand coming to press at his chest.
“This is so cool! I’m going to meet Iron man!”
“Husband!”
Did he just sign off his soul for nothing?
“I have known you since you were a boy, now…” The man paused as he ran his eyes over Thor from head to toes “you are slightly taller.”
“Do not play the prude, Thor” Loki smiled, eyes blazing with glee “I am not blind. The man is a work of art and you are not dead. Tell me then, brother. Why does the Captain still see unicorns?”
“Tony” Pepper protested.
“I know… that language.” Steve tutted, purposely misdirecting. Whatever the Director had hid from him, why he had been forced to hide from the court for these last few weeks, he knew the man enough now to trust he had his best interest in heart.
Thor felt the heat in his loins rise to a scorching blaze as he pressed the leather belt between the Soldiers kiss swollen lips. Their eyes meeting in a tentative but passionate gaze.
This seemed to frighten Frigga even more, as she placed a worried hand on her son, as if to scurry him away from the threat that was his betrothed.
Tony hid a grimace behind a bite of his bread and remained silent for the rest of the meal. Thor felt a shock of sadness for his friend, his usually lively, sharp witted tongue wilted under his heartbreak. Thor clasped his husband’s hand under the table with a troubled frown.
The Captain turned to the waiting Fury, the silent Director eyeing the exchange with a hard eye. His shoulders loosening some as the Captain approached him, hand extended for the dark man to take.
“How’s it going, Regina George?” Stark shot, his tactile hands slapping on his shoulders and chest appreciatively. “Made a burn book yet?”
“You are getting way out of line, mister.” Steven shook a scolding finger at the God.
“I can’t do that, Tony”
Thor watched Steven gape and gaze out to Asgards skyline with a look of deep wonderment.
“Shhh, let me hold you” Thor whispered, lips skimming on the warm flesh of his ear, dipping his head down to his shoulder and curling over the Captain in a needy, yearning hold.
Tony shot up to his feet, eyes blown wide and startled as he caught sight to Pepper, his fiancé, standing near the counter, where she must have been when he walked in and hadn’t noticed.
“Your lessons stopped but a decade ago, Thor” Frigga reminded him. Thor winced at his slip but Master Bragi remained his bored unperturbed self.
The Captain dipped his head, abashed and discomfited under the attentions and Quill fought the urge to coo. And ask for an autograph… on adoption papers.
I know some did not want smut or would have liked it to to be in a side story, but the narrative of this scene was so visceral for me that I had to keep it in. I will still try to take in account all your comments on the rating of this story. Sorry if it bothers anyone, but I feel Thor/Jane needed closure.
Thor latched on to his husband like a leach and whimpered when the Captain retreaded for much needed, but utterly loathed air.
-----
He would kill them all, and then, he’d fuck Thor’s husband over their bloody carcasses.
Though Thor recoiled of these thoughts instantly, for no matter how oblivious he is or how much he wished to delude himself. There is no scenario where the Captain would say what he ached to hear.
Thor halted his harsh hammering of fluffy bed ware, eyes wide and alarmed as he held the gutted pillow in midair, spilling innards onto his clone and some sticking out from his golden tresses framing his pale face.
Fury released a long breath “Now you understand why the need to keep the Captain away from the Court and the Wedding to be as fast as we can make it happen?”
The soldier’s throat began to close, his breathing coming in harsh rasps as he felt the walls begin to close in on him. He pulled his knees to his chest, trying to remember Sam’s advice when these spells happened.
Tony had to get there first, he had to.
Because if you think that's hard, you have know idea what I have got reserved for you guys for the main course.
“Steven”
“Ok, let’s do this.”
-----
So here is the chapter, because I have zero impulse control and I really wasn't satisfied with the last chapter, here is a slightly better one (?)
Which gave her all the rights to continue to use the tactic for as long as she lived.
“You son of a Bitch!” General Ross jumped to his feet.
“Then we are in a stalemate.”
“You must really love him.” The Captain mused, pressing his side to his husbands in quiet sympathy. Thor’s throat closed in a knot as the faces of both his brother and his friend met side to side in his heart’s hold.
Heimdall observed the action figure of Captain America, the plastic likeliness brandishing his trademark shield and the mythical Mjolnir.  A recent model, it would appear.  Heimdall looked down at the small box, holding it gingerly and at an arm’s length. Clint grinned at the meditative God “It’s collectible”
The Director grit his teeth at the cheeky reply.
With one very obvious member missing. Thor saw Steven’s face fall minutely as he counted heads and came out wanting. Iron man would not be present for their nuptials.
“I’m sorry.”
Thor smiled widely, subtly flexing as he extended his hand for a long handshake. “As are you Captain, the military regalia suits you”
Steve jolted as he felt another body approach him, catching the dark clothes with the corner of his eye as the other man stood by him in abject silence.
Jane dropped her eyes again but gifted his knuckles a tight kiss, clenching her fingers around his for a long second. “I know you have to marry”
“No, we really weren’t” Steve mused, looking over to the hundreds of Asgardian Soldiers and the shambles that were the blue helmets. Even with the help of a Hulk and the two mutants in cat suits, Asgards forces had near wiped them out in a matter of minutes.
The Captain released a breathy laugh as he pushed the God off him and laid gasping side to side.
Steve nodded to the Goddess “Thank you, Frigga.”
Steve’s eyes began to water.
Because of course Steven would worry of staining the floors of his jailers.
“Look, Steve, I can help you get out of this” Wheels and cogs already turning in his head as to how to make a bureaucratic shitstorm big enough to deter a God “these idiots can’t actually force you to go through with it.”
Steven sat up in a second, making Thor release a disparaging whine as he took his warmth and attentions with him. The Soldier rose a haughty brow at the pouting God who could only make gabbing hands at the man.
-----
“Go now, my darling. I will watch over the Captain”
“He is marvelous”
The large gates to the hall were slammed shut by an invisible force, the high arches of the windows covered by glimmering runes as the hall they stood in was effectively sealed around the astonished team.
“Aye, they are” The God laughed, pulling the small animals out by the curl of their horns and to the open, releasing them in front of their loaded cart and beginning to tie in Tanngnjostr while Tanngrisnir munched on his cape. Steven eyed the God as if he had lost his senses and Thor thundered his laughter.
“I’ve been going to Therapy in DC.” Steve confided; a whisper so low Tony almost missed it. “I was getting my head on straight. Gettin’ the help I need.”
“You are most welcome.” Thor whispered back, pressing his forehead to the man’s in a comforting bump.
Steve would have to find a way to stop his face turning to a tomato, but at least everyone was happy.
“My people” Thor growled “recklessly put in harm’s way for your pride…”
“We are here to unite the souls that the Norn’s themselves have forged to be one.” A deafening roar of approval shook the very foundation of the palace, prompting a smile from Thor, matched in Steven’s own lips as they awaited for the crowd to settle.
“Frigga” Odin groused; voice thick as he cupped his wife’s face in his hands.
And the door closing behind him sounded like a gun shot.
Odin rasped a deep breath, a soft cry ripping from his heaving chest.
And Loki’s silver tongue had been played like a bow on the fiddle.
“I know it’s not how you do it in Asgard, but here on Earth, we value written contracts”
“Considering what?”
Drawn in dark, harsh lines against a background of faded swirls. He was a King sat in a throne of schemes and whispers.
“Regardless” A blond, aging man spoke looking somewhere over Heimdall’s shoulder intently “We cannot simply hand over the Captain, we must arrange for all the finer details of this union”
“I needed to be alone”
Steven eyed the plentiful weapons until his eye caught the daggers and he grinned “
“Come Captain, we have much to discuss” The General boasted, laying a possessive hand on his shoulder and attempting to steer him toward the looming politicians. Steve stood his ground, startling the Military man out of his fog of thrill.
“120 Mississippi, see you when he stops kicking.”
“Sounds kinky.” Tony drawled as he burst into the room. Dressed to the nines in a bespoke suit, fresh out of the shower and using dark eyeshades to hide the worst of his little meltdown. He grinned as he strutted in and sat unabashedly in the room full of America’s most powerful men. Really, this was exactly where he was supposed to be. “Good evening General Ross. Mr. President, fancy seeing you here; tell me, what did I miss?”
Some days after, Thor had convinced the Captain to take a week off of their duties and part for a hunting trip with the Warrior Three and Lady Sif, as Thor did every decade or so. Steven had been acting strange in random intervals, mostly around Family dinners and Thor thought it wise to give him a respite from his Father’s pointed looks and his Mother’s constant fretting.
Thor’s heart speed to painful heights, hammering against his sternum so harshly his pulse rang high in his ears, a hot blush of his own gathering on his cheeks and wandering down his neck as he gazed longingly up to his beautiful, delightful husband and suddenly Thor could not speak, could not think around the surge of want; of soul scorching love he felt for this wonderful man. And when their lips finally met again in those soft, tender strokes Thor so loved, he broke.
Thor frowned at the barely concealed morose meaning in the Captain’s words “Aye. But Steven…” The blond God raised his eyes to meet his husbands, allowing for once to show the vulnerable underbelly of his proud facade “I will be taken for a fool…”
The sun began to break in the horizon, and Thor found himself surprised at how quickly time had passed in the company of his Captain. For the first night since his rupture with Jane, the skies had not rained.
“Two dudes…” Quill mussed, breathing deeply as he tried to convey security to his trapped friends “Odds are still good”
“I don’t know about your educational system but where I come from no teacher is a slave to their students, there are no slaves, period”
“Father!”
“Concentrate”
“Steven” The God sighed, kneeling between the Captain’s long, supple legs. Looking down at his flushed husband and aching for him.
The Director shoved the gun to the human’s face with a snarl “I ain’t your brother and I am sure not gonna stand here and listen to any more of this shit. General!”
He had spent the whole evening planning his doomsday with the Gods, eagerly contributing and requesting,
Steven gifted her with a cheery grin “Thank you ma’am”
“Are you even trying?” Loki snarled, a faint outline of a vein pulsing on his forehead from frustration. Steve pursed his lips and nodded, closing his eyes with a sigh.
The councilmen and women leaned forward, all their eyes shining with greed. “And what do you ask for in return?”
He was sobbing quietly onto her heaving breasts, shaking like a little kid as he gripped her tight to him.
“He touched her inappropriately so
The Queen smiled back just as stiffly “Frigga, please. You are my son’s partner… we are family.”
Aye, that is why…
Steven though, his righteousness was inflaming, it called to Thor’s passion like none ever had. Even Jane…
Thighs clenched around the God’s head, there where he was cleaved to the hilt, nose brushing the soft bits of hair, the heavy balls hot and pressed tightly to his bearded chin as Thor worked his throat around the large cock of his lover, relishing the cut off moans and cries as the Captain struggled to hold back his voice under the sensual onslaught.
“You are troubled”
Thor curled his fingers around the man’s cock, sighing in wonder as he finally touched that which was his by holy right, smiling as a low-pitched groan managed to escape the Captains gagged mouth at the soft attentions.
The man raised the hammer and brought forth a string of lightning. Heimdall spun out of reach, his eye catching the flight of the shield as he feinted forward onto the unprotected man, his sword raised high to clash with Mjolnir in a howl of magic. He was stunned for a second, and that was his downfall.
“I hope you’re not too scared to stay now” Laura smiled brightly, her hands rubbing absentmindedly at her belly, soothing little circles that drew Steve’s eyes to them like magnets.
“Oh, you imbecil!”
Loki hummed, not bothering to contradict his panicked rant and that was as good as agreeing and Loki is far better at reading a situation than he is and if he thinks he is right about Steven not ever forgiving him then…
(See the end of the chapter for
He left the man in the middle of the plaza, glaring at any of the politicians who made a move to stop him. He climbed the stairs to meet the Avengers, now sporting equal delighted smiles as they received him among them.
Steve knew the feeling… He felt it every day. And knowing that this bright, formidable, so unquestionably
Thor rejoiced at meeting his friends. Banner adamantly refused to spar with him, Hulk or no, but was happy to see him, nonetheless. Stark pranced around like a peacock, flouncing about with his love and showing off a diamond ring in his lady’s finger with pride, earning sweetly indulgent smiles and kisses from his soon to be bride.
Heimdall glared with his slightly less swollen eye. Thor grinned wider still and straightened. Adjusting his clothes as they waited for the Royal entourage to join them by the Bifrost’s doors.
“I am Groot!” Groot cried, slamming a heavy branch arm to the protected spelled windows and retreating with a sharp cry as it caught in a small fire. Rocket scrambled to his side and quickly patted out the flames.
“I observed him, of course”
“Fret not! We’ve done this before!”
Thor gaped a bit more, eyes darting around the room; expecting Loki to come out and stab him or something that made a bit more sense than the Captain, the paragon of Truth and Free will, accepting he had been tricked into something as serious as impending Godhood with a smile. Thor shifted on his feet and probed tentatively “You are not mad?”
“Aye”
Who had found him, after… had they found him quickly? or until the
Chapter 23: Ronan the Accuser.
The general visibly recoiled and he could almost swear he heard a collective ohhing from the side. Steve side stepped the man and the frozen UN representatives as he strolled toward his teammates, still standing by the Council doors with unreadable expressions.
“Yeah, sure.” Quill scratched the back of his head, recuperating quickly form his mishap and grinning winningly “And if you guys ever need anything, and we are around…”
The Hulk burped “Hawkeye is stupid Avenger”
“I’m sorry” Steve began, his baby blue eyes full of regret mirrored thickly in his voice as he spoke softly “For not being there. I’m sorry I can’t be what you need… I wanted to, I was getting there, I thought. Somehow I’m always late…”
Thor sat in the large couch as he merrily went about to distributing steamy buns of freshly baked breads and sliced fruits “The newly wedded pair stay in their rooms until they conceive…” The Captain startled once more before Thor hurriedly added “It is merely symbolic nowadays but the shortest bedding has been Odin’s, and only because he had been mid siege with Vanaheim.”
Steven nodded “Yeah, we’ve all been busy with the wedding preparations, and-“
“Coulson’s due.”
Later that morning, he broke his fast with his Shield Brother’s and Sister. Miss Pott’s already gone to work with a warm farewell and a tender kiss to her fiancé’s lips. Thor gorged himself in the human marvel that were pop tarts, whispering heated praise to the sugary confection, much to the amusement of his friends, and Barton’s open disgust. “Just get a room”
Quill gasped dramatically at this, his eyes blown wide and face palling. “
“Agent Hill”
“We will see you soon, I hope.” Barton interjected, smiling to the Captain as he extended his hand for a shake and goodbye.
Banner nodded in understanding. Thor laughed and clapped both Banner and Widow in the back with heavy hands. Jolting the mortals lightly in camaraderie as he turned his eyes to the beautiful redhead assassin with mischievous purpose: “Lady Widow, would you care to test your worth?”
The God swallowed thickly “I once promised you, not to take that which you would not give freely. And I stand by it.”
Steve grit his teeth, his jaw working to contain his anger and give a polite response to the enraged and short fused God in front of him, measuring him. “I’m not very good with a sword, your Highness”
“Steve” Black Widow called “Really not looking cool right now.”
His emerald scaled body parting the sea like Moses, the large horned head rising high in the sky and peering down at the two blond men with astonishingly bright and intelligent eyes, the long parted tongue slithering out in a soft hiss as he dipped low to the beach side to meet a beaming God of thunder.
Heimdall nodded diffidently “If it would please you, Captain”
Inside, the council members of the Nations were seated and waited in contempt, their cold cunning eyes following Odin’s step with various degrees of disbelieve. The human guards fidgeted nervously as the Asgardian delegation set in place, completely impervious to the pleas to leave their weapons outside of the chambers.
touched
“Hey, hey” Steve said softly, already waist deep in the water before he realized, holding on to the God’s bleeding hands and stopping his compulsive scrubbing “No more of that.”
Loki smirked innocently, an expression positively angelic in Steven’s handsome face, his blue eyes batting demurely up to the irate God whose hand shook under his shapely jaw. “You would not dare abuse your husband, would you?”
The words sounded like she had had to drag them wailing and scratching out of her lips, reluctant and cold.
“And yet” Odin continues “It is not enough, you ask of me my son, Loki, to stand trial and punishment in Earth. Loki Odinson, God of Lies and Mischief, set your world to destruction in 8 days, all by himself and you could not contain him for a day in your most advanced facilities”
“There, that is better.” Loki hummed approvingly “Now loosen it”
Steve wanted flowers for his wedding.
They fought in waves of jabs and strokes, near to fast to follow as they altered from blades to punches as it suited them. Lady Sif acquired a fevered gleam to her eyes with each stunted strike and every attack she sustained.
“I am sorry, my Boy. For everything”
To his side the Widow smirked coyly up to the grinning God “Make sure the Captain treats you right”
“Sleep, Thor.”
Thor’s troubled thoughts were cut short as they finally came to a stop before the King, sitting in his throne his lone orb scanned the sight of the prisoner, protected by the Crown Prince and Royal Consort. The Court rose with furious whispers.
Thor nodded shortly, mind still a turmoil of conflicting emotion. Odin retracted his hand and stared out to their people making merry as if they had not been in threat of extinction barely an hour ago, faith in their rulers restored and ignited.  “In this occasion, I thought it best a demonstration of wills be had. Nothing like a good show to the right people to silence the crowds…”
“Thor?” Steven inquired, setting down his pallet of paints on the soft blanket he used to cover the marble from under his workstation. Thor’s heart ached at the sight of that stained blanket.
The man harrumphed noncommittedly and slowly prowled forward, sleek and dangerous as a panther.
Tony pressed his mouth eagerly to her pink folds, his tongue dipping and curling around, his teeth nibbling on her pert little nub with the desperation of a drowning man. Pepper cried out, legs kicking in the air as she took Tony’s mouth and tongue.
“You lead an attack on the Royal Halls” Odin accused “On your family!”
Thor tried to use his hands, he truly did; but they were batted away with ease.
Thor cleared his suddenly dry throat and brought his hands to rest reluctantly on his husband’s splayed thighs, decency weighing heavily on his lustful thoughts as Steven dipped his head to hide his blushing face in the God’s neck, unknowingly testing Thor’s resolve to not ravish him again. Loki or no Loki.
------
The God nodded, understanding with those scant words what the Soldier truly meant to convey, Thor gave the man’s nape a soft, lingering kiss, eliciting the most delightful shiver from the Captain as they both settled down to sleep.
A round of thunder broke the sky as a metallic blur parted the sky and whirled its way from high above to slam into Steve’s open, waiting palm. Electricity danced around the Captain’s arm, sliding into his body, alighting him from within as the clouds rolled over and lightning crackles above before the startled, awestruck audience.
“Well fought, Captain” Stark patted Steven’s knee and parted, leaving the room in quiet contemplation.
Chapter 5: Avengers
“Not so clever, since it was me who gave you the means to escape in the first place”
Steve’s breath quickened, his hands clenching to his sides, itching to take hold of his shield. But the Director went on, his burst of anger gone now, but standing fierce and looming over the Asgardian Nobles fearlessly, arms held out wide in open provocation “So now.... Here I am, tell me.”
“Nat. Always a pleasure.” Steve murmured gently into the red head’s shoulder.
The Captain nodded firmly, his blue eyes losing their tenderness and steeling with righteous rage.
“We see that as a violation of the accord”
Thor scowled at the bizarre question “Sacred? How so?”
Thor felt a wave of unease at the request but Steven seemed to not perceive it at all as he smiled winningly at the woman and followed her into the ring. Lady Sif handed Steven a training sword and eyed his hold with now doubtful eyes.
The Soldier met his gaze, so very still under the weight of Thor’s confessions.
Tony had spent most of his adult life hating the man for driving drunk and killing himself and his mother. Hated him for leaving him alone so soon, for not being there long enough for Tony to understand him, to outgrow his childhood resentments; however well deserved, and get a chance to know the man behind the Iron fist and the tumbler of scotch.
“Clint” Steve reprimanded, feeling bad for invading the Doctor’s privacy in such a way, ignoring Tony’s conspicuous silence. But the Hulk was already babbling away.
By the entrance, Miss Potts greeted in a high and pleased voice: “Captain Rogers, I’m so glad you came!”
Chapter 1: The United Nations.
Thor felt a thrill of lust mix with the cold grip of suspicion as he stared at his beautiful husband beam and cheer, his own lips fighting a smile in their frozen state as he shared a look with Sif and Hogun.
Thor felt panic rise in his chest, he could not deal with his Shield Brothers falling apart. He had already lost his strongest pillar on Earth, he could not stand if all his foundations came crumbling down under him. His existence in Midgard would truly become a bane if that were to happen.
It said something about him; very unflattering actually, that he instantly forgot he was in shitcreek with his soon to be wife (hopefully, still, please, pretty please) at the drop of Captain America’s name.
By the Norn’s, but Asgards whores could learn a thing or two from the Captain.
“I think it still needs some working” Steven corrected, eyeing his work with a contemplative expression. “It’s good that he agreed to this, he’s the only man who can stand still for hours on end and not bat an eye”
“At the very least I won’t have to stare at Odin’s smug face for all eternity” Loki mused, carefully handling the warm slice of pie and taking a ginger bite. Thor sniggered as Loki moaned in pained delight.
He then threw open the doors for his betrothed to climb in the opulent ride, enjoying laying a hand on the small of the man’s back as he guided him inside. Much to the disconcerted glances of the Captain; Thor was about to ‘accidentally’ let his hand slide lower when a dark, heavy hand slapped his away. Thor recoiled from the sting as the Director glared him down.
The Captain blinked and studied intently the other man’s features for a long, searching moment, ignoring the startled and interested stares from the Avengers at the newfound detail, as they too scooted closer to the pair.
As they assembled in a large, opulent room with many elderly royal councilors and spokesmen sitting around a beautifully crafted map of the realms Steve had to physically suppress the urge to wander over and appreciate the mastery of the artful piece. Fury had no such qualms as he near dragged the Captain to his side, deliberately sitting on the opposite side of the room from Odin and in between him and the rest of the gathered noble men.
Odin tapped his mighty staff and silence fell upon them.
If only he could bring the man to feel the same…
Thor shot onto the skies by Mjolnir’s handle, just in time to avoid another swing to his bottom by the irate Heimdall. His laughter heralding his arrival to the palace doors.
“Thank you for not hating me for it” Sif replied, giving an answering clench to the man’s calloused hand and a shy smile.
with you, and that is all I’ve ever wanted him to be. You make him so happy…”
“He is not wedded yet and until he is, I get the final say” The fierce Director declared, pushing the elderly Head of Arts into Steven’s rooms “now go back in there and get to teaching”
Thor rubbed at his stinging behind, shooting a reproachful glance at the mute Guardian. “That was unnecessary” and then, because Thor was in cheeky mood “Steven will hear of this”
Steve eyed the door where his husband had left with open longing. If only he could walk out of this just as easy. Loki bristled some more as he caught a glimpse of his thoughts through the chains that enslaved his soul.
The All father pursed his lips, nodding once and raising his hand to his sons and kingdom.
Stark’s mouth gapped as he met the chagrined and amused eyes of his teammates. Even Thor had noticed the heavy contraption Stark insisted on carrying around like a child would its blanket.
And still, it wasn’t enough.
Tenderly maneuvering Thor’s hand into place, the Soldier slid the golden ring onto the God’s frozen finger as he vowed “To have and to hold, from this day forward. For better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death do us part…” Steven smiled cheekily at the speechless God “And maybe a bit after that too.”
“Jane”
Steve swallowed, blinking about as he tried to recall his dream and drawing up blank “I… I don’t know, I can’t remember.”
The engineer cleared his throat, fighting the urge to go look for Pepper and beg for another role play, he could show her the video feed of the Captain, she’d understand.
“Sir” Steven clasped hands with the mighty man, his large palm engulfing that of the Mortal in a firm clench.
With a final cough and roll of his shoulders, the Soldier pulled the God ever closer, impossibly so, as he skimmed his luscious lips to the heated shell of his husband’s ear and began to sing.
Steve had been deadly allergic to pollen.
(See the end of the chapter for
Loki stood pale and unblinking, healed and tormented by the same touch, he followed Odin’s steps as the King turned his attention to the stunned Soldier.
Thor rubbed a calloused palm to his tired face as he confessed in a shamed whisper “Someone tried to take the Captain and I knew nothing of it”
------
Some cheering could be heard from their audience, Banner and Stark standing witness to the carnage, as they preferred to fight with their intellect rather than their bodies. Which to Thor and everyone present sounded like a coward’s tale. Barton nursing his bruised body and ego next to a solemn Captain, dutifully punching a giant sac of sand.
Except.
Steven smiled that All American Charm smile and Thor felt his heart go aflutter.
Loki blinked his eyes open, crooking his head to the side to better hear the soft baritone in the cell next to his.
Thor felt a swell of affection for this man, his love drowning out his fear and doubts as he crawled next to his husband and pulled him to his chest, efficiently curling all his limbs around the Soldier like one of those Midgardians sea creatures he had seen on the television once. Steven huffed and snickered as he was smothered by the God, but his good mood held and he shook hands with a now kneeling Volstagg.
“I’m so sorry, Tony.”
Thor plundered the Captains mouth in deep, all-consuming strokes, swallowing the little gasps the Captain let slip in between kisses. Then Thor’s hands began to wonder lower.
He hoped Steven could see past this and accept him all the same.
Thor cleared his throat and straightened under the scorching emerald gaze “I would have you stand next to me when I make my vows, if you would have it so”
Sooo, this happened, I know it wasn't the smut scene that you wanted but maybe it was the one this story needed. Tony needs a break and Pepper is always there for him, even when she shouldn't. I love those two so much.
“Aye, unfailingly.”
The adults of the table nodded, somber and suddenly serious. The children on the other hand…
He vowed to avenge the slight to his beloved later in the sparing grounds.
Thor frowned down to his husband and turned to shake his head resolutely to his mother “No, Mother. I must stay with him” Passing a gentle hand over his blessedly cool brow Thor dared to lay a kiss to the smooth forehead, ignoring Frigga’s troubled glances “I promised”
Steve opened his mouth to reply, no doubt to defend the honor of his burgeoning idiot of a husband when a series of screams and crashes were heard from outside. The royal halls filled with the sounds of swords clashing and cries of death. The Captains eyes blew wide and Loki grinned like a shark.
(See the end of the chapter for
Thor swallowed thickly as the Captains eyes blinked open lazily, batting his full lashes to focus his eyes on the intruder of his afternoon nap.
The Captain winced in commiseration “Oh.”
Tony mentally pleaded.
“And these” Thor breathed anxiously as he set his hands on the handle of the sole remaining room. Building up the courage he burst the door open with a wide grin “Are your private rooms”
What exactly had happened last night to inspire such respect from these unfeeling men? Or was it
Steven nodded and shook hands with the shorter man, eyes intent on him as he spoke “General”
“We shall feast again tonight” Odin declared to all “This feat must be celebrated accordingly.”
It appeared Thor wasn’t the only one with a broken heart; he thought, as he observed the men shake hands. At least Stark still had one love to hold on to.
He left the shower and dressed in his clothes from the day before, patting them to smooth out the wrinkles and walking out of the room.
Steve gazed down at his husband, shamelessly nude, his body so defined and that golden glow of his skin. His long, wavy hair spread out over the sand like rivers of sunlight; features strong and perfectly proportioned, his full beard marking what Steve now knew to be a perfectly squared jaw, so angular and sharp under his hands when he dared to hold the God’s face when they kissed.
“Oh.” Steven breathed with a shudder, turning his head back up to stare at the heavens.
Odin’s eye gleamed as he looked upon the man, measuring him, catching sight of Mjolnir hanging conspicuously at the Man’s hip and an odd shine of approval framed his gaze, then he turned his eye to the other Human, the Director deliberately nodded in acknowledgment, but stood tall.
“I’m not allowed to leave the palace now?” The Captain shot back, eyes hard and unwavering.
Thor frowned as it dawned upon him. His disgust from the night before coming back in a vicious wave.
Thor leaped back with a disgusted yelp, rolling away and out of the bed in a ball of flailing limbs and tangled sheets, followed by silent snickers echoing in his mind as Loki straightened and stretched his lanky arms over his head in a luxurious and totally unbothered manner, his green eyes bright with the sharp and mocking smile he could not show from under his bandages.
“The lesbians will freak” Hawkeye giggled. “How did that even happen? Thor the Lesbian Icon?”
“Thee who is Worthy of Thor” Jane finished, her tone icy with a finality that made Thor stumble. “Worthy of Thor. DO you know how many nights I’ve stayed up asking myself this exact same thing?” Jane let a small self-depicting laugh “It’s easier when you are here, when we are like this. To forget what we are. But that is not an option anymore”
Thor held his hand high, calling Mjolnir back to him as he strode forward to his enemy with a snarl. “You dare try and take what is mine?”
” Thor grinned and snuggled closer to his husband.
Steven smiled primly at the man, setting the plate of food by Thor’s lap, his free hand gentling the God’s hair back and away from his furrowed brow in an absentminded gesture that made Thor’s heart jump and cheer. Thor smiled up to his husband and began to feast on his meal with eager bites.
“He is your lover” Heimdall guessed, coming closer again, unbothered by the beams that Tony blasted his way.
Thor patted her unruly hair with his spare hand, grinning wider at the prospect. “Aye, I do”
“Do you not like it?” Thor sobered, worry etching on his bearded face as he saw the Captain stand frozen in the entrance and scrambled for anything to nudge his husband from his troubling state “I even bought you a doormat”
“Odin”
“So that is settled” Frigga chirped, her face glowing as she clasped her hands excitedly “Now on to the wedding preparations!”
“Soldaten!” He called to the surrounding men “Folge mir! Venez avec moi!”
Thor grinned at his mother and rose from his seat in an eager leap. “It is settled then; you are Steven’s tutor”
Steven barked a dazzled laugh “Ha, that’s gonna take some getting used to.” Thor grinned winningly at the now bashful Soldier, eyeing him longingly as the man pondered something or other with a serious expression “There is one thing I’ve been saving up for this moment… Seems about the right time…  The right man.”
And well, Thor had only himself to blame for trusting the God of Lies. Anyways, Thor really did know how to wear a gown with grace.
“Thor, my son” Odin greeted, his eye darting quick to the Captain “Captain Rogers”
“Sure, there’s enough for all of us”
“You are hearing what we are, right?”
“SchieBen!”
Thor was not surprised that the man knew of his surprise for the good Captain, as his roundabout comment gave away, and actually felt himself relax at the assurance. He wanted to please Steven, as their engagement was drawn alarmingly short, he could not help but feel that they had been cheated of a beautiful opportunity and sank into his duties with unknown fervor, as if getting this right could somehow undo the wrongs of a stunted courting.
“Aye, Captain, what are you doing here?” Thor’s hand went to open the balcony doors, eager to meet the man, his nudity but a plus in the scenario. They were to be married soon; it would be remiss of him not to flaunt that which would belong to the Soldier. Thor grinned brightly and pulled the handle.
In a second, the sturdy little bridge on the pond succumbed under the combined weight of a dozen young maidens with a sharp crack and crumble.
Thor blinked, a demented gleam to his eyes now that it drawled on him “You mean to say we were alone and unattended for a whole hour.”
“You are not my Family!” Loki spat, his own eyes flaming with emerald hues of magic. “You are my captors!”
Thor winced internally, they had been mostly old, hadn’t they? Even so, a decade in Earth, was his father truly aware of what he was giving Thor? A decade to roam free on Earth, with his brothers in arms and his lovely Jane. Thor waited for the other boot to drop. When Odin remained silent Thor quickly parted the room, fearing that his father would just give Mjolnir a nudge the next time a bald priest attempted to hold the hammer if he interrupted his entertainment. Really, at this point, he did not trust the cheeky mood his Father was in and feared to test the waters in case he ended up wed to a Hamster.
“Widowhood will suit you marvelously, Captain.”
“How about you spar with something of the Captain’s choosing?” Hogun suggested, his tone too light to be innocent. Thor nodded nonetheless and scurried forth to pull Steven away from the dreadful woman.
“No, no, no. You’re doing it all wrong.” Thor hissed, earning a frustrated sigh from the Captain as he halted his stunted gait in the middle of their torn bedding rooms for what could be the twelfth time.
Thor pursed his lips to impede a smile as he took hold of the Captain’s hand, turning it over in his own with tender care “I am not wise enough a man to appreciate beauty from another’s perspective. But if it is from your eyes, I am sure I could come to love it dearly…”
Thor smiled at his precious man and held on tighter as the bells sounded again.
His mind had been assaulted with the sweet tones of his late mother’s voice, how she had spoken to him when he was bedridden with fever in his childhood, which was every other Tuesday to be fair. How she had told him of how she had planned her wedding day, she had been a spring bride, which had not been so good as the weather had not yet mellowed out by then, but on the bright side, there had been flowers a plenty. She had loved her flowers.
“Be it as it may, he is mine.” The God leveled the Queen with a sharp gaze “I have invested too much, cared for him too long to allow you to hurt him. He is under my protection, Frigga. And I warn you, I will not touch my heart to do what I must to keep him safe.”
“Come on, Thor. They’re your children.” Steven urged, walking stiffly to the tent’s curtains and halting with a jolt when the God released a high cry of mirth. The Soldier turned to his smirking husband with a questioning gaze, to which the God leaned back into his beddings with a truly filthy and self-satisfied smirk on his Godly face.
The feast in honor to the future nuptials was an opulent extravagance of Asgardian riches, open to all who would join, the halls filled to the brim of Asgardians celebrating his betrothal with ale and meats.
“His voice is better kept to the bedroom, my Prince”
Odin joined them at the mention of his youthful adventures. Eyeing the trophy with an appreciative but calculating gleam to his blue orb. “Aye, it is quite large… Steven slayed it, you say?”
“I can do this…” He murmured to himself, rolling his shoulders as if warming up for a run. “It’s Thor, it’s just Thor…”
“I too, Steven, promise this…” Thor hurried to reply, taking the other band lying lone in his other hand and pulling at his husbands limbs to reciprocate “I wish I had words as precious as yours to say, but I know them not, I can only pledge my soul, my faith and my very
“The Norn’s are fickle masters” He explained “They are seldom so direct in their will” He pressed a kiss to her furrowed brow “We were fortunate; to have found each other, as we did.”
Loki followed the Soldier through the palace halls with little clue of what to expect of the Captain’s sour mood. His plan to cause trouble for Thor had worked perfectly, and in reality it was bound to happen eventually. Only Thor could believe that a lie of such magnitude would hold against time…
A flash of rainbow colors adorned the UN council doors once again, the reporters startled but for a second, then began to flash pictures of the lone man that appeared at the stairs. Dressed in gold armor, his ebony skin shone like lacquer, his golden eyes disturbing in their intensity, so much so that many avoided to take direct pictures of the man, even the cameras shying from his gaze.
“I did escape, if I must remind you.” Loki grinned, unrepentant. “And with quite a bit of company, in fact.”
“Yes, Thor?”
The Furry one scoffed and sighed painfully “Don’t embarrass yourself Quill, you’re making us look bad.”
“What, you don’t like it?” That lovely, golden brow arched over those beautiful cerulean eyes and that half smile and adorable shrug of wide shoulders; it was startling how accurate those mannerisms were achieved. God of Lies indeed. “The costume is a bit much, I’ll admit… So tight,” Loki mused in Steven’s gorgeous voice, only fueling Thor’s anger as he continued with his subterfuge by striking a mocking heroic pose “but the confidence.”
“We are not doing this Thor!” The Captain interjected with a twitch of his lush, pink lips at the God’s surly antics.
Banner laughed and slapped a green hand into Steve’s, visibly recoiling as he saw the green skin against ivory. Steve held on tight to his hand, eyes kind but firm on the panting man “We humans are stronger than we look”
“Ahh! Captain” Thor cried in pain as he was dragged out of the chambers “I will speak with the Masters of Art!”
“Good morning, Thor” Steven smiled softly for the blissfully grinning God as he walked past him to the large doors of their room.
Tony’s mind still reeling from the events in Genève. Steve, Brooklyn brat Steve, had beat the holy shit out of a God.
“Hulk like plan” The Green Guy groused at the side, dragging around a broken piece of one of the Giant metal warriors he had smashed to little bits as he realized the fight had stopped.
He rubbed his thumb on her flushing cheeks, she smiled openly “And they dare wonder where Loki came about his Silver Tongue”
“This is so cool!” The little boy screamed, the shrilly voice of a boy barely out of his toddler days. “You’re really the Hulk?”
Inescapable.
His mother had always enjoyed weddings.
“What are you doing?” The Accuser demanded, patience running thin while the Starlord attempted to string along his other battered and bloody companions into the strange affair.
After the initial charges and stances had been set. the voice man stood in front of Odin, fearless as only a true being of Hel could in face of the Gods, and spoke the ultimate fallacy:
, he had startled to realize, as he heard Steve congratulate him for the engagement.
Steven, of course, saw right through his pretense and walked over to sit next to Thor’s shameless sprawl, eyes serious and apologetic. “He shouldn’t have said those things, you are a great man, Thor”
“Is that…”
“Then who is the Prince marrying?” Rocket questioned, scratching his furry head in perplex.
“Yes, I… What was Heimdall doing here?” Thor stumbled over his words, eyeing the door where the Dark God had disappeared with a feeling of being in a dream. Steven followed his eyes and shrugged.
Silence filled the room, so disturbing, so deafening after the escalating voice of Odin’s statements. Thor looked upon his father as all the human diplomats that had so hounded him remained cowered by his statement of facts alone.
“Of course it’s impossible” Loki hissed “Odin himself set the bar!”
“Thor…”
Steve nodded in acknowledgment. Eyes wandering back again and again to the bodies squished under the Jet’s wheels and the way the Representatives gingerly stepped over them with a faint look of disgust as they exited the Jet and marched resolutely towards him, their greedy eyes shining with bliss.
When the rainbow lights flashed in the skies before the blond pair, Thor kept his eyes glued to the Captain’s oblivious face, mesmerized as the million colored stars danced on his Betrothed’s fair skin and paled in face of the Mortal’s bright, enchanting eyes.
Steven blinked and shifted uncomfortably from foot to foot, eyes darting about as a blush began to form in his ivory cheeks “How did that-“ Thor rose a haughty bow, daring and playful as the Soldier deflated quickly “never mind. Even so, the serum…”
-----
“Sounds like Loki” Thor grumbled, laying back down on his spouse with a sigh “He would be gentle with me too, before…”
Sorry for taking so long, this is a bit shorter than I should have but I have a lot more in store for the next chapters, Steve on Earth is going to be a treat!
Here in her loving arms, he could almost believe everything would be ok.
The sad part of it is, Peter couldn’t tell which one she was talking about. Both probably.
“My Dad taught me how to make Missiles and Margaritas, in that order.” Anthony countered, his mischievous grin just on the edge of sharp. “So no, I don’t like people taking my stuff. Nothing personal Rapunzel.”
Steven took the proffered hand with a firm nod “I will run ops in a STRIKE team for Shield, and my work as Ambassador is in effect next month. You’ll be seeing a lot of me yet.”
“Yes, he has betrayed Thanos and with the infinity Stone he plans to attack the Gods.”
“Captain” Thor called as he landed in the hidden clearing. His worry grew as the Soldier took a long moment to acknowledge his presence, his usually polite ways overrun by whatever emotion stabbed through the Mortal’s chest.
“He can’t be away from me for more than a couple of hours at a time” Steve explained patiently, walking around the bed and sitting on his side as he pulled his boots off with tired, mechanical motions. “and until I pass the string to you tomorrow, there is nowhere else he can be.”
And with a withbearing grin the Goddess Eir left the God of Thunder to mend his mistakes, surrounded by young ones who slowly braved to approach the warrior, Thor felt he could still gleam wisdom from the pair of old bats, Eir and Bragi alike.
Thor raised his head slightly to eye the utterly torn and decimated state of their rooms, stray pieces of ornate furniture laid in all manners of disarray and the coffee table caught swaying with Asgards night wind there where it hanged halfway through the high windows, glass peppering the marble floor like freshly fallen snow.
“Thor?”
“Which is?”
“We should go to the Healing rooms” Thor reasoned, gently guiding his husband out of the bathroom.
“Come here, Soldier.” The Widow approached with a saucy jut to her lovely hips and a playful glint to her keen blue eyes. Steven extended his arms and embraced the woman softly.
“I don’t need you to be sorry.” Nebula barked, voice wrought and shaky “I need you to be my sister... I need you to stay.”
The Captain shrugged his self depicting thing, making Thor’s heart ache for this humble, glory of a man “Wouldn’t feel right not to.”
Howard and Maria Stark had been killed by Hydra.
Thor nudged his husband forth, receiving a soft, uncertain smile from the Captain as he had overheard the conversation with his Father, and the nervous glint Thor hated to see in his husband’s eyes dared to shine once more. The God nuzzled the Captains temple reassuringly as they entered the great halls in direction to the Royal table.
“It will be a serious insult to Asgard if I refuse. It might even spark a war”
Thor grinned wider at the man “Bet you I can win every round”
A ridiculous part of his brain wanted to make a crack out of that sentence, but he was so drained, so utterly done, that he could only nod, falling back into the couch like a puppet with it’s strings cut.
“Oh, oh, oh” Clint jumped in his seat like a child “Do me, do me! Which Avenger am I?”
Thor felt his own cock steer, leaving a wet trace of precum on the bedsheets under him as he allowed himself to be used, his mouth fucked open with abandon as he gazed up at Steven; eyes clenched shut, overcome with sensation, muscles on his abdomen clenching as the telltale rising of the man’s testicles slapping on his chin gave way to the most amazing sight Thor had ever had the honor to behold.
The Captain stumbled, appalled. And really, it was his own fault for ignoring the Lady’s wise input. Thor lunged a mighty punch to the man’s crotch.
“Let’s make this interesting, shall we, husband?” Thor groused, turning to lay face to face between the Soldiers thighs and place his hands on the sides of the Captains unimpressed face, caging him in and under him with a salacious smirk “One slip of clothing for round?”
Steve looked up to meet Clint’s open gaze for a second, before faking a consternated sigh “Director Fury is going to be livid”
The God turned to the harsh voice calling his name and found Fury standing impassively by his side, Thor cleared his throat from the earlier emotion of the reaffirmed friendship “Director.”
The royal wedding, the stunted kidnapping and an unexpected guest.
Fury turned his fuming eye to the Soldier as the discussion escalated “Was it? ‘cause that hand felt pretty serious to me”
Thor’s glee sobered quickly at the whispered admittance; so it had almost happened.
The God beamed brightly for his dear friend “He already does.”
Peter gasped “Oh shit, she wasn’t bullshitting me?!”
“Captain!” The black widow called, standing before UN doors and beckoning him forward, joined in a leap by a haggled looking Hawkeye, bow pulled and firing explosives at the advancing Giants.
“Promise?”
“I love you…”
Steve rolled over the Beast’s chest and dealt him a fierce punch, cracking one of the horns that framed its’ mouth. The Thing roared and flung a heavy arm to Steve’s head. Steve turned in time with the impact, giving him the momentum to roll onto the forgotten swords and take them in hand. Spinning back toward the turning Monster and cleaving one blade deep through the meaty shoulder, effectively pinning it to the marble floor.
Steven stumbled back dramatically as Mjolnir went with ease, offering no resistance. The mythical hammer light and perfectly balanced as only fit for an instrument of the Gods.
“What?” Steve sputtered.
Thor forced out a wide smile. “And who will I be bedding? You or the Beast?”
“I’ll kill you and then I’ll kill her” It rumbled, his voice startingly clear and human even as an animal roar began to rumble in its wide chest.
Steven halted his restless pacing with a pointed glance “Thor,
There was silence as the Soldier squirmed and huffed on the other side of the curtains.
“Ok, just checking.”
“Jane, trust me, it’s ok”
Steve could almost hear her say. He imagined her small, clammy hands on his hair as she used to pet it when he was at his wits end over something or other. Steve nodded to his ghosts, ripping his silly clothes off in frantic pulls to stand in his undershirt and pants, ruffling hurriedly through his things for that little wooden cross he had always kept in the inner laps of his uniform, right next to his compass.
Frigga’s lips trembled and Loki’s resolution faded.
The music rose in magnificent waves of splendid tones as the sun rose at the horizon, meeting the magic lights in a clash of illusion so majestic it even made Thor’s eyes water at the sight.
He had only a couple of hours before he had to travel to Geneva to the UN meeting, where the whole marriage thing would be discussed and Tony would have to dig himself deeper to keep the soulless bastards at bay.
“I guess I brought that on myself”
Thor set the leg down with a faraway look in his eyes. For a moment Frigga worried over his state of mind until abruptly as the state had come, it had passed. Thor smiled in wonder as if she had just revealed the secrets of the universe to him and him alone. Without so much as a wipe to his crumb filled greasy beard, he bestowed a hearty kiss to his mothers brow and rose from his seat in a mighty sweep of cape and armor.
“I know it cannot compare to the life you could have had in Earth, but…”
“Steven”
They drank and laughed and cheered well into the night. The Warrior Three had accepted the usually shy Doctor and taciturn Widow in their midst as if one of their own, sharing stories and attempting to drink one another under the table. For a pair of mortals, the Avengers had the alcohol resistance of a Bilgesnipe and soon only Valstagg, the Widow and the Doctor could form coherent words.
Thor awakens, Steve hopes, Tony squares up to a fight.
The widow shushed him as they avidly observed Stark approach the blond pair with a sure step. Arms wide and a showman’s grin on his bearded face. “Cap, fancy seeing you here, got my invitation after all?”
Clint ignored him “Come along, the guest’s rooms are this way”
It had been such a strange and stressful day that when he entered his shared bedroom and found Thor viciously smacking him- Captain America suit and shield- with a feather spitting pillow, Steve could only stand by the door and blink.
Alas, it was all for not and Thor walked with a little spring in his step to the Great Halls to break his fast with more than a little jubilance on the prospect of Earth and his adventures to come.
as we can.” The God pointedly said, prompting a startled, shy glance from the Soldier before coming to lay a comforting hand to the man’s trembling shoulder “You are of Asgard now, Captain. It would always come to this.”
“Aye, it is a sad thing, but I am here in his stead” Thor said “He has not forgotten you, my boy. Nor could he ever”
“How about we have breakfast first, then we can go out and play with my shield”
“Ha!” Barton barked, turning to a shocked Bruce with an urging, extended palm “Gimme it”
Thor lathered his chest and belly in kisses and nips, his hands kneading the hard body appreciatively. A God worshiping a Man.
Gasps resounded in the wrecked rooms “My prince!”
bed…” Thor said, his voice soft and pleading.
“Siren? what siren?- “ The Director asked, thrown for a second as his troubled eye met the Guardian’s unwavering gaze.
Thor saw the opportunity and took it with no hesitation “Frandal is much the same, you can never be serious with the man, never believe a word from him, he has a tongue viler than Loki”
No, Thor realized, no amount of time could erase this man.
What made him worthy?
Ronan fell to his knees with the strength of the blow, unimaginable coming from a single man, or entity. The Accuser spat the blood gathering in his mouth, facing up to the King of Asgard as the God clenched his weathered hand around the thick of the weapon until it crumbled like dry sand in his fist, leaving only the stone in the middle of his scared palm, shining and pulsing harmlessly in his Godly hold.
“Steven… Are you still drunk?” Thor groused, voice hoarse and cracking around a smile so wide his cheeks stung. His Soldier gave a teasing nip at the God’s corded neck, ripping a sharp cry from his husband, before gentling the stinging left by his punishing teeth with apologetic pecks of his smooth, plump lips.
Quill winced and scratched his head abashedly “Yeah, I wouldn’t know, haven’t been to Earth in nearly 30 years.” The human sighed heavily “I hope she is”
Aghast and heartbreak ahead.
Thor felt a nudge of power extend from their shared bond as the All Father tied Loki’s Sedir onto Steven’s soul, drawing a hiss and gasp as the King’s order fulfilled itself on them.
Thor grinned wickedly as he lied “Yes, but that is beside the point.” Thor straightened to his full height, standing proudly as a Prince before his Kingly Father as he declared “I know what I wish to give as my courting gift to Steven.”
“I should steal him from you” Frandal plotted, resting his head pitifully on the wrench’s bosom.
That beard burn, though. Still going to need some getting used to. Steve thought, remembering the last time he had felt it and ripping himself back to the present with a harsh shake.
Well, this is going spectacularly. Thor grimaced internally, turning to look at his father in search of any hint of discomfort. Of course, he found none.
Frigga was not ready to let go.
a dude. That is a
“Do you love him Steven?”
Steve walked up to the canvas with a tight knot threatening to choke the breath out of his chest. This is what it looked like then. A fresh start… Just like Thor had said.
And just as his mother laid the finishing stitch, a familiar, mechanical voice resounded in Asgards ruined walls.
Before he knew it, his back hit the mat with a tremendous thud, shaking the foundations of the sparring ring and eliciting a round of commiserating sounds from his Shield brothers.
Thor nodded firmly, laying a hand over his heart as he swore “I will.”
His brother.
“Tony, that’s enough” Miss Potts intervened, laying a hand to Stark’s chest where not a month ago, the arc reactor laid like a fallen star “It was a misunderstanding, it happens”
The thing let out a frustrated roar and flung his whole body over Steve, who just barely avoided being crushed by grasping the Thing by the horns adorning the sides of its head, his feet scrambling for purches as he took the whole weight of the Monster, who pressed and pushed against him with its enormous body. It snarled and punched repeatedly at Steve’s side, claws ripping at his skin in bloody stripes. Steve grunted and brought the Beast’s head down hard to smash his knee to its face. The Thing dropped to its knees with a sharp gasp, spiting black blood at Steve’s feet and attempting to swing his claws at him once more.
He caught hold of her naked hips, one hand curling under her, clasping a handful of her pert cheeks and the other gripped the bunched belt that was her skirt, gripping it like a reign and pulling her lower half up off the couch and onto his face.
Quill almost went cross-eyed when the Captain called him by his chosen title and spurted out “You were almost my grandpa, you know?”
“The Lord is my shepherd” Director Fury recited, drawing a small rosary out of his long trench coat and fondling the worn beads with practiced hands “and he will find his herd no matter how far it strays. For he who is with the Lord, never walks alone.”
“Get to him, Tony” Steve insisted, a pinch of a plea in his voice. “Doctor Banner, you’re with me”
Steve says his goodbye's.
A long line of Asgardian workers came in with arms full of wooden boxes and all matters of things they went about to setting in his room with but a perfunctory glance his way. Steve was about to ask what all those things were when he saw a blank canvas be set near his balcony window on a high, golden easel. So white and crisp his eyes burned to look at it longer than a couple of seconds.
Odin sighed. “I cannot do so”
I love reading your comments so please keep it up! I'll try to answer to each one of you as soon as I can.
Ronan stood before the wreckage of his ship and armies, after being bombed by explosives of a grade never beheld by the Accuser, his whole forces decimated in but a flash of fire and smoke. The Accuser seethed hatefully as he watched the remains of his ship sink in Asgards sea and dragged away to the edge of the planet like a pile of rubble.
Nebula sprung to her feet with a furious sneer “And I needed you! I needed my sister!”
Thor gave a full body startle, coughing as he spluttered. “Modelling?
Thor surged up and ripped the obstructing leather from the lovely man’s lips, taking his mouth and shoving his tongue inside the warm cavern, letting the Soldier sample his taste and groaning in sync with the man’s startled gasps at the filthiness of the act, his limp cock stirring bravely on his taut belly and more honest in his desire than he ever was.
“Yes, ma’am.”
“Yes sir”
Odin turned once more to the expecting mass, his face fierce as ever and decreed: “And be it so, Asgard pledges her protection to Earth, in my time and that of my sons, and those who follow.”
A suit of armor to cover the World.
The blond God winced “ 5 days now”
And Tony kept her there, thrusting his hand in sharp motions, rubbing her, licking her wet folds while his other hand unbuckled his belt, unbuttoned and unzipped blindly, pulling himself out and giving himself a couple of tugs as he kept Pepper on her high, feeling her muscles clench and milk his fingers in frantic undulations. He pulled his hand out of her and thrust his cock in deep, jolting her whole body with the force of it.
Some of the guards tried to shuffle forward and Steve almost wished they had, already spoiling for another fight to spill out his frustration, but the All Father held them back with a raised hand, giving Steve a considering look.
“Soldaten! Ruckzug!”
Steven gazed down at her with empathic eyes, not an ounce of judgement in his lovely gaze and so very perfect that Sif wished she could resent him, wanted to envy him and hate him for having that which she had loved so dearly for longer than he had been alive. But she could not, not
Jane began to shake in his hold and Thor scrambled to explain, how could he have been so dense? coming here and immediately bedding her? She was bound to think this a farewell. Thor pressed a hasty kiss to her sweaty brow in apology.
He knew this, and he had let himself be fooled by sweet words of comfort.
Steve felt himself blush as he recalled all the kisses, the furtive and tender, the heated and passionate. Thor knew what he was doing, alright. And though Steve had a couple of tricks up his sleeve, he could never achieve the easy confidence and masterful touch that the God had when he held him and pressed his lips on the Soldier and
Thor frowned at the human, but wisely kept his silence. The director smiled. “You do understand that this wedding is purely business?”
“You would threaten me, your mother.”
“Fuck!” He screamed. Pepper already watching the news in the wide screen of the common room, her clear blue eyes wide in horror.
“But you are not…” Thor prompted, hands clasped together as he spoke “you pulled away Steven”
Thor felt ice grip his chest as Odin voiced his offer, all the greedy eyes of the Midgardian rulers now set on him with open hunger, raw and gripping as the power behind Odin’s sentence.
Thor took a deep, fortifying breath as he braved on forth “I mean, he wishes for art!” Thor smiled like a lovestruck fool as he explained Steven’s sweet inclinations “He used to be an apprentice before war claimed the Earth of his time. I wish to give that back to him. In whichever measure he will allow.”
“Then war they shall have” Odin vowed.
“Tony!”
“No one you need to interest yourself in anymore” He assured, rising to meet the God eye to eye “but don’t fool yourself, flaunting your fiancée about is not the harmless play anymore. Keep your eyes open and your ears on the ground... Something is in the works in here and I don’t like the smell of it.”
A collective ‘Aww’ was heard before the Avengers burst in laughter.
“Good morning.” Steven said. Devoid of any other response as he approached the Gods, wisely avoiding asking about the situation and taking it all in stride.
“What did you plan to do to stop him?” The Director asked, standing now next to the Dark God with a pointed, no nonsense eye set straight on Quill, mind rushing to assess the level of the threat and the use of the fools in front of him.
“I can’t stay” Jane repeated, voice firm and desolate “And know I am not worthy to be with you”
Thor’s eyes threatened to bulge out of his sockets, a wave of lust so hot and overwhelming he barely managed to bite his lip to stall a wanton moan from escaping. Thinking of the Captain in his deliciously, obscenely tight uniform, throughout the wedding… the
Thor stopped his ministrations for a second before restarting, now with both hands actively massaging Steve’s neck and shoulders, earning a small groan from his husband.
Frandal grinned wide and spread his arms to envelope the scene, reveling in the reactions of the Captain and sprouted into prose “Aye, it is lovely, but it pales in comparison to your beauty” Steven visibly startled and looked down at the blond warrior in surprise “I am bewitched by your charms since the first moment my eyes had the honor to feast upon your visage”
He cleared his throat loudly and nodded. “Put him through”
In Asgard, Odin let out a frankly disturbing cackle of laughter as he and the royal family (minus Loki who to this point remained unaware of the fires that he had set) spied on the oblivious humans scratch at their heads like the apes they had sprung from and paw at Mjolnir with ever increasing frustration.
The Director recoiled violently at the decree “Wow, wait a minute, I ain’t supporting no Slavery”
Now, Steve dared to look and
He let out a shaky breath in the darkness and his eyes blinked back the tears that gathered as he felt a warm, calloused hand curl into his own. He pursed his lips tightly and clenched the fingers that intertwined with his own, drawing silent comfort from each other.
Thor stole another kiss before turning back to his meal, purposely ignoring Sif’s downcast mood. “I will introduce you after, you will love him, I’m sure”
“This is a declaration of war!”
The Big Green punched the Accuser with angry fists, roaring and snarling when the Kree slipped out of his reach and gave him a swift hit with the hammer, sending the Hulk flying out into the sea.
Steven sighed, hands clenching on the God’s shoulders with urgency as he murmured agitatedly “Thor… Loki is-“
“Captain Steven Rogers, Director Nicolas Fury” Thor spoke, uncomfortable and unbalanced “My Father Odin Borson, the All Father, King of Asgard and Protector of the nine realms” Odin nodded at them from his seat on Sleipnir; then he turned to his silent, contemplative Mother “Frigga, Mother of Gods and Queen of Asgard”
“You are leaving for Midgard.”
It was almost worth the restlessness he suffered to see his baby brother scramble in his bed like a Midgardian chicken, dark hair fluffed like feathers and eyes wide like a fretting maiden.
“Ok” Steven sighed, eyeing the gleeful God of Thunder with a queer twinkle to his blue orbs “Fair is Fair”
Loki glowered from his sprawl on the other side of the bed. Steven’s side.
“What about a contract?” The voice man asked after a moment of solemn silence, a screeching halt to the proceedings that almost seemed laughable.
Norn’s, he could hardly wait.
“No harm” Steve repeated, his voice an undeterrable command that imprinted itself into their link. “I don’t intend to imprison you, mischief is what you are, I get that now. But you are not insane, nor too far gone to understand when hurt is brought.”
A loud, guttural roar followed and the room was quiet, again.
“I have a task for you, my oldest friend”
Thor held on tight to his husband, his hands wandering the clothed expanse of the Soldier’s strong back, his nails catching on the fabric of his shirt and going lower to finally grip that perfect bottom, earning a low groan as he groped and kneaded the firm cheeks in time with their thrusts.
Steven had comforted him and curled into sleep with open windows, trusting Thor to be respectful.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Jesus Christ” Clint whistled “Look how far down that goes” He cackled as Steve shot him a disgruntled look “alright, alright. I’ll give you a shirt Mister America”
“Ha!” The Director barked his laughter and turned away from the Soldier.
Bruce shook his head at the exchange and sighed heavily “Take care of each other, boys.”
Tony arrived to the UN council doors with a crash, the doors flying out of it’s hinges and out of his way as he flew into the Council room to land in front of the Asgardian General, who tracked his movements with golden, creepy eyes. Tony fought to keep himself from fidgeting under his gaze.
“Is he willing?” Sif asked, finally breaking her sullen silence.
Steve smiled to himself, head dipping and hands resting on his hips as he stayed still on the beach side, fresh wind brushing his face and teasing his hair, and for once, no doubts of where he stood.
Also, anyone interested in an Avengers vs Heimdall beatdown?
dared to wink in sync at the Captain, eliciting a dark flush in his high cheekbones and a rowdy laugh in their friends.
“Wash your mouth out with this. Do you think you could eat anything solid?” Silence responded the Captain’s gentle promptings as he tended to the wounded God “It’s ok, they sent some broth for you.”
“He is truly Worthy” Thor rasped, understanding now, after all the pain and despair, what this all meant.
Thor felt a pang in his chest but nodded, nonetheless.
Thor leaned his forehead to his husband’s, feeling the nudge of the man’s soul against his, those clumsy hands shoving the bright Sedir of his little brother like one does an olive branch.
He stood in front of the man in the middle of a circle of Soldiers, Asgardian and Humans alike, he sighed loudly and closed his eyes, then promptly punched a fist in the air.
Chapter 25: The Warning.
“Says who?” The Archer shot back, fiddling with his bow as he walked towards the conference room door “America is a free country and there is no warrant on you.”
man could ever feel the need to claw out of his skin made Steve’s heart tremble.
“No, you’re right.” Steven agreed in a somber tone, though his eyes sparkled with mischief “But my husband can hit my husband.” And he promptly gripped a wandering appendage and slapped Thor’s own hand smartly on his bearded cheek. Slipping out of the flabbergasted God’s hold with a chuckle and out of arms reach.
He was going to have some very serious words with Sam after this.
Thor quickly stepped forward, clearing his throat to begin introductions before blows could be dealt.
“You don’t!” Thor yelled, his panic finally peaking “But I will set it all to rights again. I will destroy Odin’s artifact.”
Loki smirked.
“Steven?” Thor gentled, feeling unsettled by the man more than he could readily explain.
to defeat me, boy…” The All Father sneered at the Kree Lord, speechless, battered and on his knees.
The walk to the Bifrost was an animated one. As the good Doctor inquired extensively of the science behind the travel, Thor himself could not revisit the facts entirely, but what he had learned he shared freely to the starry-eyed Scientist.
(See the end of the chapter for
Thor grinned. Yes, this was his Loki.
Thor suppressed a relieved sigh at this, nodding sagely at his otherwise preoccupied father.
Quill snorted at the alien, sobering when he noticed Gamora eyeing the newlywedded pair with overwhelmed lust “His muscles are like corded steel”
“There is still some pie in the coffee table” Steve offered instead with a strained smile “I don’t think anyone will want to eat it now”
Thor nodded sharply, his hand still in his Father’s, the difference in them so harsh he could not form words… when had his Father aged so?
Tony flew Thor’s unconscious body back to Avengers Tower, nearly dropping him a dozen times on his way. He kept telling himself they were all accidental. When he got to the docking platform, he kept the suit on, well aware of Pepper waiting for him in the common room and watching him with hard eyes through the wide windows.
“It’s what Coulson would have wanted” Fury whispered.
The Captain bit his lips as he held back a smile, lifting his own drink for a private toast to their future together. However long it may be, Thor prayed it be as happy as he was now.
Thor could in fact resist over 200 Mississippi’s. Steve tried not to think very hard on that.
’ was tackled brutally to the ground by Asgardian forces, and the scurry that followed as the musicians and mages scrambled to flee was one fit for a Midgardian comedy. Hogun, Volstagg and Sif managed to escape swiftly, all loyalty forgotten in their quest to escape Odin’s wrath.
Loki grinned “Best hurry Captain, none of those silly gooses can swim.”
Lo’ and behold, his cock could in fact rise again. Thor crowed internally as he struggled out of his prison of sheets, smiling wide and elated at the Captain. Loki frowned and rolled his emerald eyes at the unmasked longing, turning away from his sibling and eyeing the human instead.
Heimdall nodded, his honey eyes crinkled in wonderment.
And with that last bit of eloquence the God of Arts turned on his heel and stomped out of their Wedded rooms. Thor blinked after the man and turned to glance questioningly at his smirking husband, crooning another of his Midgardian tunes with a truly wicked gleam to his bejeweled blue orbs.
Thor quickly rose from his seat as the first blows were dealt and slid next to the startled Captain just as the chairs began to fly and was about to grasp the man’s frozen shoulder when the tavern whore that Steven had been defending sprung forth and punched an approaching drunk right in the throat.
The Captain spoke in soft waves, but his words, they were hard whiplashes of pain, of loneliness, of aching deep desolation that Thor found himself fighting the tears that gathered and clouded his sight.
“Thor?”
Thor began to shake as he looked upon the fallen beast and his charming man “Steven?”
Steve nodded thoughtfully, his eyes finally setting on Tony and really
“Oh look, nurse Volstagg is here” Thor cried happily, rising and pulling Steven out with him with a wide smile to his large friend. “He has a far better bedside manner, I assure you”
Thor scowled at the mortal “You speak as if someone will try and take him.”
“My prince, have you come for another examination?”
“How different are Asgardian Animals to Earth?”
“I beg your pardon?”
To the side, the voice man of the chamber (a man of high stature and willowy limbs that for the previous weeks had made himself into a near literal bane of Thor’s existence)  shuffled up to the stand and declared the Session Open, calling forth General Ross of the United States of America, to begin his speech.
Thor was well and truly smitten.
“Fret not Steven, these are no regular goats.” The God received an unconvinced glance as those beautiful blue eyes looked down at the little beasts and their rather large cart with uncertain shifts. “Here, observe…” Thor pulled his cape out of Tanngrisnir’s mouth, pointing at the closest pillar of the Royal Stables and barked “Yeet!”
“Of course, you may go to her this instant if you wish.”
“He’d shoot you” Drax assured, making a gun of his fingers to point at the disgruntled Starlord right between the eyebrows “in the face.”
“Fuck, I love you so much” He cried, rolling his hips inside her, just the way she loved and hated at the same time. The way that would get Tony anything, forgive and forget everything, just don’t stop.
Frigga greeted them with a smile so tender it was hard for Loki not to return it. Steven, of course, smiled preciously and took his seat by the Queen with a gracious nod and a subtle look to the God. It was with that look that it dawned on him…
Steve thankfully understood the gestures and grinned self-consciously: “I know, it’s a lot. I don’t think I can pin all these on the jacket, it’s enough that I have to wear the hat”
“Would you tell me?” Thor asked, his voice small and melancholy “Would you let me know, Steven?”
Heimdall struck again and again. succeeding in pushing the man back a few feet before his rhythm stuttered, and that was enough. The captain caught his eye in a fleeting, terrifying moment, A smile of pure glee on his handsome face as he breathed his sentence: “My turn”
“Thor?” Steven mumbled, wrapping his arms around the God’s back, patting softly as if testing it was truly him.
“Do. You. Yield?”
“Mother” Thor reproached her, pulling away from his troubled mother and frown deep on his features “This pertains solely to the Captain and I, I will ask of you to mind your place”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes well, don’t enjoy them too much, I would like to have a brisk step still when my grandchild arrives.”
The Doctor gave a watery, shy smile and nodded. Steven eyed the exchange with a placid expression, his eyes kind on the emotional Doctor and gifting Thor with a tender, pleased smile.
Easy peasy. Tony thought in hysterics.
angry?”
Though his heart rejoiced to see his father in such a vibrant mood, he could not forget the personal expense this brought. He was to marry a human for his father’s entertainment. Or as Stark had so delicately worded: for Shits and Giggles.
As he had expected, Odin had been furious. Only the intervention of his mother, sweat voiced and soothing, had avoided his renouncing Thor as his first born and heir in place to name him a stable boy for the rest of time. Frigga had pleaded his case with eloquence and spun reason with a finesse that sounded sweeter than sonnets to Thor’s ears. And Odin, in all his wisdom, had relented.
“Will you be joining me, sir?” Steve asked, finally noticing the luggage waiting next to the Master Spy.
“You know” Steven started, after a long moment of dejected silence “Weddings on earth are a lot different.”
The captain gave Thor a sharp kick to the stomach, sending him stumbling back to the corner of the ring. Barely staying on his feet, Thor pulled at the ropes to stay afoot, breathing hard and sampling his own blood in his mouth.
Thor did not deserve that trust.
“Clint” Bruce cut in, pale faced and near cowering to the side “I really don’t think I should stay here. I mean you have kids.”
Thor kept a cadence of passionate sucking and tender nibbles to Steven’s flesh, dragging him to the edge of mind-numbing pleasure and then gentling him back to a steady arousal that had the Soldier trembling under his hands with overwhelmed frustration, his defined hips finally losing the battle with decorum and thoughtlessly thrusting up to Thor’s eager throat, taking his pleasure shamelessly from his husband, as was his due.
“The arrangements for our rooms have taken far more time than I had expected” Thor admitted, thinking back at how many hours he had spent making orders and sending out scouters to retrieve the items he wished to make the place they would live, his bit of home with Steven, just perfect.
And as Loki sucked in a deep breath. Thor’s world turned dark, with one last fleeting thought of despair for his husband’s life. Thor fell limp in his brothers’ arms.
“There is a certain beauty to words, my prince” The old man said as he turned and walked to retrieve his materials from the high stand “The art of conversation, we call it… You would do good to revise your lessons upon it.”
“Yeah, but evil takes no holidays, and neither do we” Barton said, a heroic smile on his features though his eyes were dull and sad. “We are following up on the location of Loki’s staff and we have some hints on some Hydra Bases that need some blowing up”
Frandal gapped and removed the woman from his body, leaning forward with a hiss: “How dare you, I am Frandal the Charming! I could woo any man or woman that I so choose!”
Steve rose a haughty eyebrow “Is this just your way to call Master Bragi a tool?”
“I had an appointment today”
“Steven!”
“Marriage” Tony added with a short smile, earning a sharp scoff of a laugh from the morose Captain.
“I Odin, Father of Gods, sent to you my son, Thor Odinson, God of Thunder, with my word and vow of protection, I removed the threat of the Tesseract from your planet, I tried and condemned my own name for the attack on your planet and yet...”
“My prince, you have grown much since you last slept through my lectures…”
“Sentimental…” Thor whispered, pressing a lingering kiss to his husband’s mussed bed-head.
“It’s fine Thor, your mom explained.” The Captain halted the God with a patient smile, closing his book and setting it to the side, smile growing at the astonished blinking of his husband as he was met with candid words instead of shouts of indignation for deceiving him into immortality. Steven continued when the God could only gape back “I get it. It would have been nice to have a head’s up first, I won’t lie.” Thor winced, bracing himself for the recrimination he knew he deserved, but none came. Steven continued to smile and took his book back into his lap with a serene expression “But you had no way of knowing it would be like that.”
Thor joined Hogun and Sif, pulling Steven to his side and bestowing fleeting kisses to the man between bites of buttered bread, their conversation soft and pleasant though Sif’s gaze was resolutely set on her plate through-out the meal. Hogun cleared his throat after a moment of silence following a quick peck to the Soldier’s neck that earnt him a sharp look and a fierce blush.
“Because you are the most powerful man on Earth” Fury declared, eye cold and unwavering “And if there is anyone who stands a chance to fight a God, it’s you”
Steve startled and concealed it quickly, offering a polite smile at the woman, who responded with a slightly dazzled look to her husband, who grinned and mumbled “I know right?”
The Hammer hit the shield, the stone pulsing bright as it infused its power to the weapon. But the shield did not budge, it did not crack. Ronan’s eyes widened at the sight of the mortal man holding back the power of an infinity stone, clenched jaw and eyes shining. The Captain not only held the attack at bay, he began to
“Aye, I suppose not.” Thor conceded and followed the Goddess out of the room when she beckoned to him, however reluctant he was to part from Steven’s side. The fear and horror of having his husband faint and wither in his arms would likely haunt his dreams for eternity. His newfound love for the man, however unrequited it may still be, enough for Thor’s soul to die along with him. He could not lose another love. He was not that strong.
“We do not speak of it” Thor evaded, sending a mischievous look at his brother, who by the white knuckled grip on his butter knife was aware of the content of the conversation “It upsets mother.”
“You are truly eager to lose your other testicle” Thor glowered down to his impossible friend. Frandal smirked tiredly from his sick bed, his features lost to the swelling and only his unapologetic manhood rising to attention.
“Your unrequited feelings for the Captain”
This is like nothing he has ever had to do and for once, he was scared to make the right choice.
“What?” Steven groused as he watched the God scramble to the adjacent bathrooms.
Bruce barked a startled laugh and reached for his wallet in chagrin “Serves me right for betting against America”
It took a couple of minutes, but the Captain’s mind was freed from its miserable fog of despair and the Soldier rose his head slowly from the God’s chest, like a scared newborn fowl, he dared look around him and his eyes shown with wonder.
Thor started forward with a furious roar, determined to crush the foul voice man’s head in with Mjolnir for his insult, only the sharp gaze of his father froze him, an odd spark in his father’s blue orb that Thor startled to identify. Odin was amused.
Really, it only appeared proper that this would be the man to make an honest one out of
“God Bless
to you. I-“ Thor cut himself short as a sob threatened to rise, lowering his gaze from that of his sweet, delightful, utterly perfect husband and rasped instead “Which finger?”
They moved together, back and forth in the sensual strokes of old lovers, Pepper leaned back onto Tony, laying her head on his shoulder, bringing one of his hands to rest with hers on her belly and push.
“You won’t, You’ll have my word to show him.”
Thor bit.
Thor dared to place a kiss to the Captain’s brow, startling a soft chuckle from the man as he was once again dragged across their wedded room to the other side of the shared chambers.
Thor blinked at the request, noticing with relief how the man’s breathing slowly regained its smooth pulls, he relaxed against the curtains “I would suppose so.”
“I am so sorry, Steven” Thor moaned, rubbing his bearded cheek to the Captain’s smooth one in increasingly harsher nuzzles as the man groaned and pushed at the God “This is all my fault, I should have warned you-“
(See the end of the chapter for
Steven met the dark God’s gaze wonderingly, but did not protest as the Guardian turned to the Royal pair and the Director “I could watch over the men’s courting from a great distance and appear in a blink of an eye if need be”
“You’re more clever than you look, Captain”
They spared fiercely, the sounds of their weapons meeting a deafening burst of harrowing power that even the neighboring trees of the clearing could not withstand and soon they had set aside their artifacts and turned to their fists.
Steve ignored him, his unwavering eyes set on the General “You and me; fight one to one, there is no need for anyone else to get hurt”
“Thor” Odin called, his blue eye glued to the mirage where they observed Midgard shenanigans. “ You will part to Earth in a fortnight”
“You know we can’t simply ask him.” General Ross said, his voice slow and condescending, as if he was speaking with a child “This is an inter-galactical treaty we are talking about here. The repercussions of breaking this accord could mean the destruction of Earth.”
“He is not safe under Odin’s will”
Jormungandr, the sea serpent, turned out to be a around the size of the Chrysler building.
Thor took hold of the Captains body and carefully pulled him up, near carrying in his arms to the plush sofa in the living space where he laid back and allowed the Captain to lay over him, or move away as he offered his silent comforts in small pets of the man’s hair and back, peppering kisses wherever he could reach, trying to give him space but not standing the thought of letting him out of his arms.
He had said his goodbyes to Sam, grateful beyond words and gone to bed, for once free of the despair that had curled and settled in his heart. He had slept like a babe.
“I will have to marry Thor” Steve said, for the first time voicing it out loud, a sinking feeling gripping his gut “I’ll have to leave Earth”
“We assumed we would just follow the wanton wailing to the slut.” Drax said, hands leisurely set on his hips as if he was not facing an omniscient God and an angry Master Spy. Groot nodded his assent with the statement.
Thor had heart palpitations, this is the first time anyone had spoken kindly of his brother since his darkness had overcome him, maybe even before that. He felt awash of emotion and tender feelings for the unassuming Captain that would fight to death in one breath and defend an enemy’s honor in the next.
can still hit you for touching me.” Steven arched a daring brow, glaring down sternly at the brazen God, kneeling behind him and gripping his hips, inches away from his ass and slowly, but surely, scooting lower.
Tony broke “Come here, Steve”
The crowd caught on quickly and began to chant the Captains name in eager summonings. The captain rubbed the back of his flushed neck and sighed in mortification “You know what, Stark.”
He tried not to think of Steve.
“Captain?”
“Stop!” He ordered. Startling Odin out of his trance to meet his clear gaze, the black string cutting halfway through Loki’s clenched lips. “This isn’t justice, this is
Steve fought back his reaction to the warning, mind running away from him as they released and met gazes for just one second too long, then the Director arched a haughty eyebrow and barked in his usual, unflinching tone “Report for duty at 8000, and don’t be late.”
Just like a coin flipped, the stone shifted from his mother’s expression and her lovely features twisted with desperation. Leaning forward to take Loki’s hands in her own, the Queen whispered urgently “We can still make things right, my dear.”
Thor gasped, face flushed and eyes bulging out of his skull as the Captain concluded his song. No wonder the elderly God had ran like a soul out of Hel!
“I was part of his guard, I simply took advantage of the opportunity presented to me in such a situation” Frandal fibbed and waved away Volstagg’s statement, circling the ring where he and Lady Sif danced with their swords, his eyes turning vicious as he spoke “I am surprised that you have known him for so long and never noticed his penchant to admire man’s most gentle craft”
“In one of our trips to the primitive Earth, he took to waving tales, so outrageous and vulgar about Loki’s conquests, about his children’s sires.”
Steve stood rigidly in front of the Barton’s TV, the room submerged in a deep silence as they watched the Asgardian General tap his sword every couple of minutes, conjuring tens of soldiers and mammoth like Iron Beasts onto Earth in multicolored bursts of magic.
“Perhaps” A deep voice halted the heated argument rising between the Mortal men, and the whole royal wing turned to face the newcomer. A fresh, barely bruised Heimdall stood in his regal finery, his presence in a feast a novelty enough to halt any proceedings. The usually isolated man looming over their table with his severe All Seeing eyes “I could help you, Captain”
Steve took the proffered vial of clear liquid from her shaking hand with a fake smile “Thank you, my Queen.”
Odin sat in the Queens gardens. A sight so rare that all the court members who had been strolling about, hastily emptied the premises, unwilling to disturb the wise king in his silent contemplation.
The fight with the Widow was fierce, she was skilled and struck fast and true. But Thor was a God, and even with the superior skill of the assassin, she found herself on her back every time. It was startling to hear her giggle from under him after she yielded for the third time.
“Yeah” The Starlord jumped eagerly to agree “As far as I’m concerned that’s
“Adopted” Tony quipped.
Thor was just about to lose his grip with propriety when a loud boom rocked the palace grounds.
Fight for Steve.
, this was worth everything.
That last conversation had haunted him, both before and after the war. That had been the last time he had seen the man. And he had always regretted those being the last words they had shared.
The nerve of this man. Steve scoffed and dipped the baby potato into the cheese. Missing the way Tony’s eyes followed the motion as he pressed the combined foods past his bashfully smiling lips and into his mouth.
“Hey, how are you feeling?” The Captain asked, gently taking the God’s hands and inspecting the healing knuckles.
“Ha!” The All Father barked, tilting his head to the side as the thumping coming from the Bedding rooms became harsher and fast and punishing in a pistoning rhythm, culminating in a tremendous crash of bodies and broken glass.
Steven arched an eyebrow and pulled him to his work, there in many shades of gold and amber was the likeliness of the dark God. Thor took a moment to appreciate the masterful strokes that began to create the mirage of Heimdall, but ultimately, he was drawn to the eyes. Always the eyes.
“Fear not, Mother” Thor pacified, holding Frigga’s hand in his own. “Steven is a gentle soul; you will come to love him entirely”
Chapter 2: Loki
Tony pulled back reluctantly, but needing to clear his mind from this man. “What are you talking about?”
“I would assume so.”
Heimdall saw it before it came, but his body still reeled from the impact, he barely avoided the strike of lightning the Captain invoked, opening a portal in the blink of an eye and rolling out and back in to Midgard, appearing behind the Captain and swinging the flat of his sword onto the man’s side.
Mjolnir fell with a heart wrenching thud. Jane’s hand curled firmly around her wide handle, her arm pulled straight as the Hammer sat, unmoving and irresponsive to her touch.
Steven sighed and raised his face to bestow a parting kiss to his husband’s bearded cheek, so sweet Thor could only sigh back and smile as he took in the man’s bashful expression at being caught snogging by his in-law.
“Nope, your Father has spoken” Laura agreed, hands on her waist in the universal mother pose that had Steve automatically standing up straight. “Off to bed with you”
“I can’t lose you too”
Thor kicked the doors opened in his rush to get the Captain in the rooms which would hopefully see many, many centuries of wedded bliss.
Ronan stood gawking at the mortal fool who had challenged him, of all things, to a dance-off.
“What has happened?” Thor bellowed, frantic in his inspection of the Captain’s integrity under so much filth “Were you attacked? Who dared harm Thor’s Betrothed!”
The Hulk took the bread with surprisingly sweet care and smiled down to the Captain. Before unceremoniously shoving the whole thing in his mouth.
“Release me, you spawn from Hel!” Volstagg cried, followed by more bleating and crashes and a truly acute squeal of pain as other, urgent and tired voices, joined the fray.
So Thor stalked his intended, as was his right.
The whore eyed the coins and the Golden pair, as if weighting her chances, before taking the gold and bestowing Frandal a filthy parting kiss, after which she sauntered away to join the scantly dressed women near the bar; their taunt, naked bodies writhing together to a tune under a shower of random coins.
“Go Steve!” Natasha cheered on, ripping the men from their trance.
Thor watched Stark’s face convulse minutely, for a second such deep longing peaking out to be covered quickly with a blank, shallow smile. “Yeah, I’m happy too”
“With all my heart.”
Steven blinked owlishly at the admission. Thor pressed forth.
“You are adapting Steven.” The Queen explained, sitting now by the shade of one of her gazebos, surrounded by her flock of young maidens gracefully fluttering by to tend to her every whim. And sending Steve the most salacious looks he had received since his USO days. Steve sat freshly bathed and flushed under the tittering attentions of the ladies. Frigga took her cup of tea and swirled the liquid with a tiny spoon as she spoke “This is the longest any human has remained in Asgard, in all our history. She begins to call to you.”
“Yeah, Cap.” Stark agreed, though his smile was far more fierce than the archer’s harmless ribbing “No homo, or whatever.”
“Are we really considering pimping out our National Icon?” A voice sounded, appalled “The man is a war hero! He’s already taken more than one hit for the team!”
The Captain released a sobbing laugh, the first sound to leave his lips after the episode had begun. And he gave it to Thor, that happy, shy thing of a laugh, only for Thor.
Steven laughed “Oh I know the type, he reminds me of a friend, Jacques Dernier, he was…” The soldier struggled to form the words as he pursed and bit his lips, conflicting emotions flashing so fast on his face that Thor could not read them all, only that the man must hold tender memories to look both so full of mirth and sorrow at the thought of him. Thor wanted to punch Frandal even more.
They had all gathered as he was getting ready, and it had actually been a good thing as he had struggled to slip into his wedding… attire, by himself. A new version of his uniform, as Asgard was a warrior race, his battle uniform was more fit than his military regalia. Though the Asgardian take on his Captain America suit was… well, something else.
“I see you like my portrait”
The Avengers arrive in Asgard
Thor startled from his fog of laughter and shared a bemused look with his friends and other patrons, then scurrying after the fuming blond out of the Tavern, only barely catching Volstagg questioning in low tones to Hogun and Sif: “Whoever called him handsome?”
“Aye” Thor’s voice broke, overcome with feelings of oneship he struggled to not break into tears “It is. Now let go and reach for it again, don’t touch, just feel.”
The whole team turned completely to see in the distance a dark figure of blue skin, holding a war hammer high as it was surrounded by a strange group of aliens and a tree, complete with woodland creature.
The Captain rolled his eyes at the Godly echo and sighed “Just come to bed Thor.”
“Now Captain” Director Fury began as the carriage pulled forward on the rainbow bridge, snapping the curtains shut from where Steve was busy admiring the view. “I want to be very clear on this, and for once I want you to shut up and listen carefully.”
“Frandal, please” The man dared, his eyes bright and raptured as he looked up to the Captain with a gaze like one who gazes upon the Gods. “I would have you say my name”
Tony fought a blush and glared at the Master Spy. “Not the sharing type, Patches.”
I would appretiate feedback on the smut scene though, did I go to far or not enough?
Steve’s frown deepened but nodded regardless. “Yeah, sure. Come on in Thor”
“No stealing” The Captain scolded, face serious but eyes sparkling.
“Are you drunk, Stark?” Senator Stern shot pompously.
“No, of course not! What are you even-“ The man sighed dramatically and passed an agitated hand through his hair, taking off his shades to reveal his sorrowful, earnest eyes and… send a forlorn gaze to the Captain, sharing an uncharacteristic embrace with the Director. The engineers throat worked around a knot before turning back to the waiting God and finally shaking the awaiting hand “Look, just, just… treat him right, ok?”
“You know of me, then you know it is best to surrender now.”
Thor was woken by the loud thud of Mjolnir falling from it’s perch on his night table onto the marble floor. Thor blinked blearily at the Hammer, at the nightstand, and at the Hammer again.
“You’re on”
With a pursed smile, Thor laid a soothing hand to the Capta-His Husband’s- shoulder, holding a grimace when this startled a near imperceptible jump of the blond man, who was so deep in his ghastly thoughts to have left the room entirely. Steven quickly offered a small smile to Thor and patted the hand set on his shoulder reassuringly.
Fury smirked “Captain. It has been an honor.”
-----
Pepper lifted her gaze to his, her smile too bright, too calm “No you don’t; but that’s ok too”
“The offer stands” Thor remarked on this, smiling down to the foreign team, plus cyborg, and bowing his head in recognition of their merits “I owe you a debt for saving our people, I will not forget this.”
“Yes and then I would be burdened with the duty to marry the Captain” Loki taunted, grinning brightly as his brother made a rude gesture in the mirror for him to catch, Thor winced when his mother swatted his hand down and patted his armored chest, declaring her work done as she pulled her eldest son to do a spin for her.
Thor frowned at the vague response “Aye”
Thor was confused, but eternally grateful for the woman’s uncharacteristic behavior.
Clint shook his head sternly “Nah, Nat wins”
Tony reached the room where Steve was and ripped the door open. His breath caught in his throat when he found it empty.
Barton perked up as he heard the Gym’s doors close behind Stark’s dejected back and yelled: “Hey! Where’s my money?”
“We will never betray our cause.” Gamora replied, her voice failing to sound collected as she was faced down by the looming God. The Racoon on the other hand…
“I… suppose not, we met at one of my last USO shows, before I was sent out to front” The Captain explained, smiling stiffly though his eyes sparkled at the memory “She was the sweetest dame to ever walk Kansas city” The captain smiled sheepishly under the other man’s gapping shock “Wicked poker face, too”
Loki blinked his big green eyes at Thor, his expression open but for a second, then morphing into an ugly snarl as sleep left his consciousness.
Fury glared, as if he knew his thoughts and Thor shuffled past him quickly.
Heimdall rolled his shoulders, crouching slightly to a fighting stance, his unblinking eyes following the Captain’s every move and breath, his very thoughts. So when he came forth with shield and hammer at the ready, Heimdall shifted out of the way, moving smoothly, as if he had seen it coming for miles. And maybe he had.
“Yes, I am here”
“How is he doing that?” Sif gasped softly, even through the thick haze of intoxication.
Tony took a startled step back, but the Captain lolled on.
“hmmm” Sif nodded adeptly and took a sip of her ale.
Thor snarled, his legendary patience as always, nonexistent. “Quit the insults and speak clearly, you think it impossible for anyone to lift Mjolnir?”
Steve frowned but did as he was told, because he did know how to be quiet; thank you, Mister.
“Working on it!” Barton huffed “Give me a minute, will you?”
Thor blinked, taking a second to understand.
“Not you! Dammit Steve!”
The musicians broke into a lovely song, the cords scratched expertly, stringing a ballad so soft and sweet it made one’s heart ache, barely a moment later, the mages broke into chanting, hands weaving spells in the darkest moments of night and brought forth light, minutes before day should break, they washed the garden and city with a golden haze.
After some minutes the Captain emerged, freshly bathed and dressed in his apprentice uniform. Thor curled his arms under his chin, cuddling the ‘Steven pillow’ under it as he grinned up at his husband going about his morning routine. The Captain noticed the eyes set on himself after a moment, pausing in tying the laces of his leather waist coat and tilting his head to the side, meeting Thor’s own gaze with a soft, happy one of his own as he walked forward, his hand reaching out to curl his long fingers into the God’s golden hair. Thor sighed with contentment and continued to gaze up at his husband with quiet appraisal.
“Suit yourself.”
“And before the serum, life expectancy aside; no gal woulda wanted me; one look at my bony ribs and blotchy face and they’d a run for the hills. After the serum… there was only killing.”
Thor grinned all the brighter. Steven blushed harder.
Thor sure was handsome, and then some.
a gift.”
The man’s face turned into a nasty grimace that was wiped away as soon as it had come. Nodding politely at the Goddess. “And who would this new pupil be?”
me to part with the Captain’s affections” The thunder roared ever closer and Frandal chuckled loudly “For you, my dearest friend, I shall”
Cheers erupted from the room as the mortal jumped onto the tables and began to reenact the most shameless gyrating of hips that Thor had ever witnessed. Blatant lovemaking for the eyes of the astounded Asgardians who promptly forgot the many, young swaying wrenches and gravitated to the new and far superior show.
By the Norn’s, the man was truly a wonder.
“Must be hard for the missus then” One of the mortals joked.
Loki sneered, though his eyes sparkled at being outsmarted by the other God. Amused as he was loath to be. “I will be there”
His undelaying meaning lost to no one, clear and brash:
Odin kept his eye on Steve, his gaze so intense, for a wild moment Steve felt as if Odin feared
“Captain” Hawkeye called, his parachute at the ready and standing steadily at his side as the roar of the Hulk rang below “You do what you have to do, we have your back”
And thus, he released the handle.
Steve sat in contented silence in his antechamber balcony, sketching Asgards golden skyline with avid hands. The city was dreamlike in its resplendent glory, but he was sure he could never dream up something so beautiful on his own. A knock to his right pulled him from his private musings. He turned his head towards the chamber doors with a surprised frown.
Tony heaved and choked on bile and half-digested liquor, turning agitatedly in his seat when a bucket was pressed into his chest. He took it and upend his stomach’s contents in loud, violent bursts. When he was done, he raised his head to the beeping and whirling sound. Dummy stood there, beeping inquiries and with the tiniest baseball cap resting on its mechanical claw, proclaiming him Iron Baby. It was a good fit actually; He had refused to release the thing since Tony had tumbled down to his workshop in the middle of the night, just after the engagement party. Having left Pepper peacefully sleeping off some rather vigorous fucking, Tony haven been so emotionally wrought after seeing Steve, he had buried himself so desperately, almost violent, between Peppers thighs, like a man drowning he had clung to her, pushing deep and hard to the point of pain, trying with all his might to become one, as if he pushed hard enough he would sink in her and all his doubts would be gone, because then there would only be her. Despite his efforts, Tony found himself biting his lip bloody when he came inside her, just to avoid shouting another’s name.
“Please, just… want me back.” He pleaded, voice soft and more broken than he meant it to be.
Fury scowled at Steve with a suspicious eye “I trust you will see the wisdom of keeping it in your pants until the wedding is over”
“Can’t tell. But I can tell you that if you don’t let us go, my furry friend here is going to blow this place up like- Ahhh!”
