Among them, surely it was Tony the one with no stable timetable, but that didn’t mean the others had a perfect circadian cycle.
She went to the recliner and climbed on top of it again, while Bruce and Clint, finally aware that
They had to wait three more days to find another moment for themselves where Tony and Steve wouldn’t be within earshot. In the meantime, now that they knew, Steve and Tony’s pine seemed impossible not to notice, so much so that one time Natasha had to kick Clint’s shin under the table to prevent him to laugh out loud.
“Come on, guys,” Natasha stopped them before they could start a rant. “Time to go to bed.”
“Basically, you spin the bottle and the two people that are drawn have to either sing a song together or kiss,” she replied smugly. “Since you all complained of me never singing, I will open the dances. The next one chosen by the bottle has to decide his fate,” she explained a little too menacingly.
It was only when Steve and Tony stood on the opposite sides of the bed in Tony’s room, already in sleepwear and with the covers pulled aside that they realised they went in the same room on autopilot like it was the most natural thing to do. Like it was the right thing to do.
“What do you mean ‘who it is’?” Clint was befuddled. “It’s you and Steve,” answered as if it was obvious.
“Mm-hmm,” she nodded with a slight smirk that he would’ve missed if he hadn’t looked at her.
On the screen, they could see themselves in that kitchen. Everything seemed the same as always, the only differences being Thor sitting on a stool between Bruce and Steve, the rain pouring on the floor-to-ceiling windows and their warmer clothes. It must’ve been around six months earlier.
The words weren’t on the screen anymore. The room was silent. And again, no one dared to say a word. No one dared to look at someone else.
Shy, awkward, gentle Steve, with a young face but old eyes that made you easily forget he was only 25. A strong man with a strong temper and soft hands that were able to bake, to draw, to play.
He made a sandwich, poured a cup of coffee with no milk and little sugar, just how Tony liked it, put everything on a tray and entered the lift.
“Sure.”
Steve and Tony were sitting on their loveseat (the one that overtime for one reason or another had become theirs, however) and that was fairly normal.
“Well…” he delayed. “Tony’s been a little strange, recently,” he answered after a brief pause, while Clint was still coughing on the floor. “He was in that particular mood – when he’s halfway between a schoolgirl dealing with her first crush and a grumpy depressed octogenarian – and I thought it had something to do with Pepper, since he behaved like that only with her, but I realized it was not the case. Then it slipped my mind but- Steve? You think he’s like this for Steve?” he asked a little sceptical.
“I’M MR ROGERS’ FAMILY!” Tony suddenly roared, his face red with rage. His voice thundered in the hallway and everyone fell silent, looking at him with wide eyes. “Don’t you dare say otherwise,” he growled with a cold low voice. “And now take me to him.”
The battle with the villain du jour – some repressed guy with a brain and reasonable ability, whose life had been a sequence of injustice, come back to take his revenge yadda yadda -  had been long and exhausting. Seriously, it took all six of them to take him down, and even then they managed to catch him only because by some miracle he landed exactly between the Hulk and Thor.
“No, it isn’t,” Tony finally answered.
“Hey, Nat,” Steve called her from the door. “I didn’t know you were already home,” he said moving closer.
Even if he - surprisingly – realized it just now.
“How do you feel, Steve?” Tony asked again with more determination, now standing in front of him.
“You sure about that?” Steve asked, placing a mug of black coffee beside the dish.
On the black screen appeared red and blue lines that matched the colour of their microphones to help them understand who had to sing which line. The first one was blue, so when the words lit up, Steve started singing.
Steve looked at him and suddenly burst out laughing, leaving Tony puzzled for a moment. “This-,” he gasped. “This means there’s totally a betting pool on us.”
“You mean we’ve been together for years without knowing?” Tony asked befuddled after some minutes.
“Tony!” he exclaimed laughing.
Steve.
“Ooh, someone did his homework,” Tony replied in a playful tone.
With a serene smile, Bruce turned around and took the stairs to go to his room. He could always drink that tea the next morning.
“No, they aren’t. Didn’t you see? Tony was too relaxed and even if Steve blushed a little he was absolutely honest. And we all know he’s shit at lying,” she remarked.
“Alright, there you go,” said Natasha, presenting them two microphones.
So, despite what the vast majority of fanfiction claimed, he was not some dull buffoon with a peculiar obsession for the ventilation system, on the contrary, he was always the first to notice something. It gave him a sensation of control, he felt safe. It didn’t matter if it was something strange, something trivial or something bad. He just noticed.
Tony looked at him with teary eyes wide open. Steve didn’t understand, but before he could ask what was wrong, Tony stepped closer and lifting on his toes he grabbed Steve’s nape, pulled him down and kissed him square on the mouth.
“Do you want to tell me about it?” Tony asked in a soft voice that Bruce never heard him use.
“Apparently,” Steve said in wonder.
This was one of those days.
repeated Tony
Before the lift door closed, she saw Steve smile with the corner of her eye.
,” moaned Tony. “If I hear another whoo-whoo-whoo I’ll scream,” he sighed theatrically, hiding his head in Steve’s shoulder.
After Clint’s faux pas, things went on smoothly as always. No one talked about Steve and Tony just like before. It was their own business after all, and as long as they were happy the team was happy too.
“I love you,” he simply said.
“Don’t play coy with me, sunshine! They sneaked into the control room and you let them see!” Tony exclaimed.
“Well, well,” he said lightly. “Let’s see who wants a smooch.”
“Tony has his flaws, like each one of us. But he’s also funny, caring, he’s smart as hell but at the same time so approachable that it’s a wonder when you understand who the real Tony is,” he went on vehemently. “During the last year, he’s been so kind, so patient to me. He gave me the chance and the strength to truly live in this century. Now I’m
“Sir has been in the workshop for a total of fifty-two hours in a row now.”
“Hmm,” the other mumbled. A few moments passed in silence but then he decided to talk. “How come you thought Steve and I were together?” he asked calmly, looking at him with doe eyes.
“Wait a minute,” he said straightening up and looking at the ceiling - he never talked to Jarvis like that before Steve, it was outrageous that he out of all people picked up the habit. “You said that no one apart the Avengers is going to see the footage. They’re spying on us, aren’t they?”
“Steve and I are friends,” Tony replied honestly. “Maybe even best friends.”
“Give it time,” said Natasha, looking distantly at the lift. “I bet they will sort it out in a week, tops.”
Steve swayed in place tasting the waters, with a smirk on his face and sparkly eyes fixed on Tony, unknowingly observed by the others.
“ ’ Course. Do you wanna come, guys?” Steve asked at the others.
“Ooh, I like the way you think,” Clint murmured.
He knew that, on an ordinary day, if he’d gone in the kitchen at 7:30 in the morning - like he was doing that day - he would’ve seen Steve newly showered after his morning run already cooking, he knew that Bruce would’ve had his tea and by now was probably in his lab, that Tony might have been in there too after pulling an all-nighter in the workshop and he knew with absolute certainty that Thor and Natasha wouldn’t appear before 9 a.m.
“Go on,” Natasha demanded interested.
“Chop, chop guys,” Nat interrupted them. “We’ve got no time to spare. Jarvis, show them the next one, please.”
“Phew, just in time,” murmured Clint as he approached.
Tony snorted. “Affairs? Yeah, I had them. I don’t know when it stopped, though. Not the exact moment, at least,” he added as an afterthought.
They stayed there, eyes fixed on the ceiling, looking at the lights that came in from the window wall, basking in the quiet atmosphere of the room that sort of lulled them.
“A serenade? No, that’s impossible. They didn’t act upon their feelings and you think you would persuade them to sing for each other?” Clint disagreed.
“Why? Does that bother you?” Thor asked taken aback, looking at him already getting on the defensive.
“Yeah,” it wasn’t a real question, but Nat replied anyway. “ And I truly don’t understand how anybody can’t see it!” she said a little exasperated.
More silence.
At that moment, though, Steve entered the room with his t-shirt clinging to his sweaty chest and his hair rumpled by the run.
“Mm-hmm, now I understand where all your despair comes from,” Steve a tad ironic.
He caught it again on his arm as Natasha’s voice filtered through, harried and a little out of breath, “It’s the droids Steve, they’re in New York. We can’t—tell me you guys figured something out on your little get away.”
It was a forced detox of sorts and he almost managed to convince himself that it was working; all the way up until the day Tony came home.
Tony smirked “I know a few women who would disagree with you there.”
Steve spun Tony dutifully and then pulled him back in closer than he had been, closer than he meant to. He wrapped his arm around Tony’s waist tightly, in for a penny in for a pound and all. Tony didn’t appear to mind how close Steve held him, barely seemed to notice, “They’re going to break through eventually, and then we’ll be hard pressed to get out of here without chase and even harder pressed to get to the supply.”
Tony flicked him off and the table descended into controlled chaos. It was almost a relief. He felt lighter and less lonely and he felt that maybe he had gone about this the wrong way.
Despite Tony’s insistence on watching the movie, he was out halfway through. He snored softly against Steve’s shoulder, hands crossed over his chest loosely.
“I’m sorry, I don’t—I don’t know—I’m sorry” he couldn’t stop apologizing.
Tony motioned at Fury “Anytime now, some super soldiers have been waiting on you for long enough.” He poked Steve’s arm “keep eating”
It was the most important rule of them all because sometimes he struggled with one and two. Sometimes Steve threw his arm over Tony’s shoulder on instinct while watching a movie and Tony would lean his head down on Steve’s chest and there was no way he could bring himself to shake him off and scoot away. Instead he just sat there, placed his arm more firmly around Tony and enjoyed the moment.
The attack was swift, faster than they could have anticipated, faster than they could counter. Steve managed a feeble 2-second-long mayday before communication shut down and he had more pressing matters at hand, like fighting off the tall blue aliens currently shooting at them.
Tony wrinkled his brow, “We—Steve, it’s just me. Do you know how many red flags would be set off if all of the Avengers show up? Mostly recon, a couple days in and out. I’ve already sent an email out requesting a look around the facilities under Stark Industries name.”
They sat in silence, each bringing their breathing back to normal levels. Steve cracked open his eyes and looked at Natasha, “I’m pretty sure you already know.”
Everyone grinned at the both of them and gestured for them to go on, shooing them away.
Steve chanced a glance up at the other man, only to see him wink quickly before turning back to his adoring audience with all the excited exuberance of a child showing off.
Steve blinks, bringing his eyes back up to Tony "Do you want me to ask why you're up here?"
Tony patted Steve’s head awkwardly. “uh, I’m okay. Really.”
Tony looked down at his phone, back to Steve, then at his phone again. “Yeah, I stopped in to see her. Clint’s going to stay and keep her company.”
“The movie, I mean, it doesn’t seem like much. It was just a movie, so insignificant. I could have chosen the other one, just to make her happy, I was going to and then he walked in and it wasn’t her anymore. It was him, it always is and maybe it always will be. I’m going to choose him over and over and eventually she will see it too and that isn’t fair to her. She deserves to come first and—“ he sucked in a harsh breath, “I’m going to end up hurting her no matter what I do.”
He realized he was staring at the entrance way where Tony had just disappeared when he was startled by Thor's outraged call of, "What is this? Such trickery from such a fair maiden! It is reminiscent of Loki!"
Steve watched him, a shake of his head. That wasn’t what he meant. “No, I—“ He stopped when Tony stood, walking back toward the first aid compartment.
With a newfound resolve, Steve closed his eyes and tried to ignore the echo of a laugh that he could still hear in his head.
Tony gave Steve a side eye, “I’m thinking that it would be better to put any suspicions to rest before they can rightfully form.” He threw his arm over the back of Steve’s seat, ran his fingers distractingly over the nape of Steve neck. Tony played dirty without even realizing it, “It’s just dinner, by the time my information comes in we’ll be long gone.”
Steve dug his nails into his palms harder. He wanted too much, he wanted what he shouldn’t.
Tony was the first to break. He let his gaze drop, ran his had roughly over his face, wincing when he hit his jaw, “You need me out there. You needed me out there today. Those things, they were just getting stronger and stronger. You heard the others, we couldn’t take that, we needed an out and I provided one. Why can’t you get it through your thick skull that I did the right thing?”
He didn’t know if it was really appropriate to explain all of this to her. He wanted her to understand though. “I can explain, but…” he trailed off.
Steve lets out a breath and closes his eyes. There's no way he's sleeping tonight. He swings his legs over the edge of the bed and plants his feet firmly on the ground. He stands up straight, gives one last longing look to his bed and then walks forward. One foot in front of the other until he finds himself in the elevator, staring at the buttons trying to decide where he plans to go that night.
Steve pulled away, sat up and gave Tony what was probably an uncertain smile. He felt like he was everywhere at once, a body halfway undone trying to piece itself back together before anyone noticed. He was happy, so happy that Tony was okay but at the same time there was a current traveling under his skin, unsteadying him, tipping his equilibrium.
He wanted to, for his own sanity he needed to.
Steve caught the hint of a full blown, toothy smile before Steve was once again staring into the cold blue stare of Iron Mans helmet. “Let’s do this Cap.”
When he had the batter poured into the waffle iron, he let his hands fall to his sides and stood there staring down at the counter. His hands curled into themselves, nails biting his palms. He needed to calm down. Tony was allowed to bring home whoever he wanted, whenever he wanted. Steve shouldn’t care.
The alarms blared, guards streaming out towards them from every direction and it was all Steve could do to quickly answer Natasha, “What’s the situation?”, he asked as he sent his shield flying at two goons raising their weapons at him.
Steve couldn’t pull in a breath that wasn’t a ragged sob, “I know, I know, I’m sorry.”
Today he needed to ask Tony a really important question and then maybe spend a little bit of time just talking.
“Nothing, It’s fine, it’s—“ There was a scream then, a blood curdling shout as the suit plummeted through the sky. Steve could do nothing but watch horrified as it was dragged down, splashing into the water.
He was done waiting.
“Don’t be such a good citizen. None of them have been stuck without good food for a week. They’re fine”
Steve flounders for a moment, trying to catch up to where Tony is. "No, you?"
He leaned down and picked Tony up carefully into his arms, cradling him to his chest and started walking him to his room.
Steve got into a fighting stance “we’ll see”
Luckily Tony didn’t seem to catch on to the tone that had snuck out of Steve. He just got a faraway amused look and replied “You aren’t wrong there Cap.”
It’s why he had been so confounded by their separation months later.
Tony had been too fast for him then, was still fast, head in the future speeding ahead of Steve, off and into the distance while Steve scrambled to keep up, make up for lost time and try not get left behind.
He managed to pull in a full breath, mind put just a fraction at ease by the site. Tony had done it. He was going to kill Tony, but maybe he’d hug him first. Just maybe.
“Right. That’s good then. Someone will take care of him—” When I’m gone, went unspoken.
Point was, Steve was supposed to be alone that weekend. It made him all the more surprised when he saw Tony sluggishly making his way into the kitchen.
Steve let out an amused breath and began to draw. He never really set out to draw anything in particular, instead he chose to just see what would take shape and go with it. He was able to get lost in it, the scrape of pencil over paper in the foreground and Tony talking to JARVIS in the background. He only glanced up when he heard the sound of Tony's welder turning on.
It was the sound of old gears spinning, working restlessly even when they just didn’t have it in them to turn anymore. They tried though, they tried and it was sad and pathetic and all Steve could think was that they should give up.
They continued bickering until the movie started, but even then Steve was lost in his own thoughts. What had he been thinking?
Natasha raised an eyebrow, “You didn’t have a problem with it before Tony got here.”
Tony walked right past Steve to the coffee pot where he managed to pour himself a cup, immediately bringing it to his mouth to drink.
Steve looked away from Tony, focused on a point over Tony’s shoulder trying to get the white to recede. “If that’s what it takes to get it through your head, then yes.”
“No! No, Sharon. He doesn’t even know that I feel this way. I haven’t, I wouldn’t cheat on you. Not like that. Tony…” Steve paused to scratch the nape of his neck.
The living room was empty except for Tony slumped over on the couch. Steve didn’t know how he’d let himself behave so foolishly, how he’d allowed this to happen. He’d had the signs, he had
“I know. You’re right. I know you’re right. It’s just- it’s
He should have stayed frozen, he didn’t belong here, he was just making it worse.
There were no thoughts of falling, no nightmarish hell zones flashing behind his eyes. It was just him and Tony and Steve could not believe he’d given this up for even a few days. There was nowhere else he’d rather be.
She stepped back from him and smirked “good luck”
Steve sniffed, snot and blood and tears that tasted like salt water, “It’s the red, white and blue. It creates the illusion of apple pie and unquestioning patriotism.”
Tony doesn't so much as glance at it before waving his hand. "I had Dum-E bring it up, you looked cold. I know I was"
It didn’t sit as heavily as it once had though, not after they’d both adjusted and finally worked out a balance that clicked.  Man from the past met a man from the future, both were destined to find peace somewhere in the present. Steve snorted quietly to himself; he never claimed to be a poet.
His hand fell flat to the table with a resounding smack, his head jerked forward. Steve caught himself just before his face hit the table top. He blinked his eyes rapidly, sat up straight and met amused brown eyes.
He turned back to the TV just as Bruce chuckled and pointed at the screen "Yeah, that one even looks like a female version of him."
Steve remained on high alert for all of two hours or so before he finally found himself relaxing, detecting no foreseeable threats. In all honestly, all Steve could see were a bunch of highly excitable, and maybe in need of some fresh air, scientists who were more interested in talking about their work than actually attacking them in any way shape or form.
Steve scratched at the denim over his knee, a nervous twitch, but kept his eyes steady, directly on her. “I really like you Sharon. You are one of the best people I’ve met since waking up here and I don’t ever want you hurt in any way but I know if we stay together I—“
He cleared his throat and the others fell silent. "I'm sorry for my behavior lately. I've been trying to.." his eyes shot to Tony for a very brief and distracted moment, "...figure certain things out for myself and I just needed…" he trailed off, hoping they understood.
Tony sighed, “It worked Steve, this thing we’re doing right now, this arguing? It’s pointless. I did what needed to be done, I’d do it again in a heartbeat if it meant ending that fight.”
Each night he thought about throwing the book out and each night he instead tucked it soundly back in his drawer with a promise that tomorrow he wouldn’t take it out and look.
His breath leaves him in one go and he feels it then, the ice water in his throat. The burn on his skin. He gags on it, he tries to pull in the air but there is no air. He's drowning all over again. He's alive when he should be dead and he's still drowning. He doesn't know if he'll ever stop drowning.
He and Tony aren't friends, but he has a feeling they will be.
He startled when Clint spoke again,
Tony tipped his head at the others and Steve before he was up and out of his seat, leading the women out to the dance floor, a hand already making its way to her lower back.
Eventually he started a new book, full of Natasha throwing knives with deadly precision, Clint perched high with an arrow held taut, Thor raising his hammer, Bruce mid transformation, and Tony in his Iron man suit with the faceplate up as he grinned out over the wreckage left after their victory. He drew his new home and his new city and even the Baxters great-great grandchildren who ran a bakery down in Brooklyn. He caught as many moments as he could on paper; times when he had to pause and memorize what he was seeing like Bruce doing yoga in the middle of the living room or Thor talking on the phone with Jane, fierce fondness etched into his expression. Like the look Natasha got when she talked about her home in Russia or Clint baking cookies in the middle of the night, covered in flour. Moments like Tony crashing on the couch, Tony working in the lab with his goggles perched precariously on his forehead, Tony laughing at something Thor had said, Tony bleary eyed in the morning, Tony's eyes, hands, mouth- just, Tony.
Steve still hesitated, “Why? He already thinks—“
He feels instantly wary, a norm when he's around Tony. They aren't hostile with each other as they were when they first met. Its more of a shaky truce that neither seems willing to break or push forward into friendship. No, he and Tony Stark are definitely not friends.
He ran his fingertips over the angles of Tony’s face and sighed to himself. He’d have to deal with it later. In that moment, he needed to get Tony up and into bed. He shook him lightly. “Hey, Tony? Wake up.”
Steve felt Nicole’s eyes on him, very possibly confused by his behavior. He stared down at the batter in favor of looking up to meet her eye.
He stuck to his original plan as much as possible, not actively going out to find Tony. It just seemed that wherever he went lately, Tony ended up.
Tony’s reaction was immediate “look Cap, we don’t have time—“
Steve hefted his shield higher on his arm and rolled his shoulders, “Let’s get this over with.”
Steve wanted to go back to a few weeks ago when none of this was happening. He’d even take going back to when it was happening but he was blissfully unaware of it. Back to a time when he could go down to Tony’s lab and drag him out to grab a bite to eat and laugh about pointless things. When he could sit and listen to Tony talk about anything and everything with a smile on his face and a shake of his head when Tony got ridiculous. He wanted to go to movie night and sit on the couch squished close to Tony and feel contentedness instead of the worry that Tony could somehow see all the ways Steve had been thinking about him. He wanted to argue over the remote and debate politics and fly down to battle at Tony’s side. He wanted it all back and it was a real fear that he wouldn’t get any of that ever again.
Steve let himself relax and get absorbed in the conversation that erupted. He missed being out there with everyone. For the rest of the evening he stayed chatting until the others started to drift off to their room to sleep and he decided to do the same.
Judging by the smiles he received, he thought they just might have got it. They all went through times when they needed to be alone and they knew when to come and get him and when to ask questions.
Steve frowned before he could stop himself, squeezed his eyes shut to try and focus. It was an act; they still had a job to complete.”
Mattias shook his head bemusedly and turned his attention back to his employees and Tony.
Steve wasn’t sure how much time passed before he caught sight of red hair from the corner of his eye. It couldn’t have been too long given the very small amount of sweat he had worked up.  He stilled his movements and waited for Natasha to say something.
and Steve didn’t want to think about how close he’d been lately to being in love all over again, how when he thinks of love now, he see’s warm brown eyes, motor oil, and a private smile illuminated by the soft blue glow of holograms. He breathed in a shuddering breath, “I never really wanted a simple life, I didn’t think about it. I wanted to love and be loved and I’d go along with wherever that took me, whether that be a house on a grove with 3 children and a dog, or a studio walk up with a cat.”
Tony walked silently next to him and for that Steve was grateful. He needed to think.
He hadn’t realized how little he was breathing until he sucked in too much air too quickly. The grid blipped, latching on to a point a couple kilometers away. Steve was out of the aircraft before it had a chance to properly land, crashing down into the ground before pushing himself up and hobbling as fast as he could over to the red and gold pile washed up on the shore line.
Iron Man, already hovering in the air, angled his body away from Steve, ready to take off at any moment. “They activated the droids stored here but they’re attacking blindly. I need to get out there.”
“So it was you who found us then?”
, the one who would string her along more than he already inadvertently had. It would just end in disappointment and hurt feelings and Steve wanted Sharon to be happy, even though he couldn’t be the one to give her that happiness.
Steve found himself nodding along with the others before he actually took in the full meaning of Mattias’ words, “Oh” Steve started to shake his head, “Tony and I –“
Instead of the surge of panic he thought he’d feel, all that came was the overwhelming sense of relief.
Steve righted himself in his chair, and shook his head. He caught Natasha smirking at him, “So glad you could make it Steve.”
Steve was in the kitchen making himself breakfast after his morning run. The tower was empty with Clint and Natasha called away a few days previous by SHIELD for some operation that fell under the label of ‘classified’, Thor likewise occupied doing whatever it was he did when he went home to Asgard, and Bruce having taken the weekend off for a personal retreat that Steve guessed might have actually been a visit to a woman named Betty judging by the phone conversation he had accidentally overheard.
There was a static crackle-pop before JARVIS’s voice filled all the empty spaces in his room “Good morning Captain. How may I be of service to you?”
Natasha scoffed, “I don’t think you understand the point of him cutting off her hair. To answer your first question, we’re deciding between Sherlock and Inception.”
Steve felt restless and heavy hearted as he tried to come up with a way to stop his thoughts from going to Tony. It was just, ever since becoming aware; all he did was think about it. He'd opened his own personal Pandora's Box and was now trying to shove everything back into a place where it no longer seemed to fit.
“Kiss me.”
Tony let out a distorted huff of air, “13—make that 12.264% possibility that they can reverse my hack and take over Iron Man, but—“
That meant no pats on the back, no arms thrown casually over the shoulder, and for the love of America, no lingering. Steve never realized just how much physical contact he and Tony shared until he had to forcibly stop himself from reaching out towards the other man. It was far more challenging of a task than one might think and Steve could admit that he had failed to enforce the rule on several separate occasions.
Steve didn’t realize that most of the small talk had stopped, not until he managed to pull his gaze away from the way Tony’s hands moved along a lovely blonde as he swung her around to the music, head tipped back with laughter when she tried to spin him.
Steve wasn’t sure he’d heard right, Tony could possibly have been asking him to do
Clint rubbed soothing circles onto his back, watching over him with careful eyes.
Well, no, that wasn’t true. That award would have to go to teaming up with the Red Skull and going dark side, which, he didn’t want to think about ever again.
“You don’t have to say anything.” He paused, tilted his head “I know you’re going to need time, but before everything, you were my friend. I don’t want to lose you completely.”
He heard Tony scoff, "
Tony nods before getting distracted by something on his phone again. Steve isn't sure what to say, about to open his mouth and go with whatever comes out first when he notices a blanket covering him. He frowns "I didn't have this"
Steve walked back to stand in front of Tony again and let himself stare for a moment. It was still relatively new. Attraction he understood after awhile, admitting he was in love. Still hard to swallow.
Tony shrugged, “pure, unadulterated talent.”
Tony’s arms went around his neck, face moving close, too close for Steve’s brain to work an active thought around. “They’ll look away, allow us to leave with no question, won’t suspect anything until it’s too late.”
That was good, that was what Steve should have been doing. It sure would have saved his confusion when he caught the tail end of Tony’s sentence.
“You could have been killed Tony”
“My pleasure sir”
Everything would change: fact. For better or for worse, the thing between them would move forward, propel Steve away from the comfort of the standstill he’d allowed himself to settle into.
"Its not a problem Cap. You looked like you could use the rest. I hear that people your age should get every bit of sleep that they can."
The woman shook her head, took a breath and smiled “Good morning—You’re Steve right? Captain America.”
Tony held up his hand “They can get their own food. This is for you Steve, you need the calories.”
Steve answered the question being asked and tried focus.
He walked in on Clint and Thor playing what looked to be a violent video game both on and off screen and Natasha and Bruce cooking something that smelled like beef and spices. Tony was nowhere to be seen and Steve didn’t want to admit he was relieved.
“Just as good.” And that had to mean something, didn’t it? “I can see the articles now, ‘Suave Stark caught canoodling with Super Soldier Steve: Mission gone right.’
It had been an unspoken agreement between the rest of the team to act like nothing had happened and more importantly not to mention Peppers name in fear that Tony would fall back into the shadows again.
Tony waved his hand dismissively, already opening up a new window in front of him, “I’ll sleep on the plane. I still have some things to finish before we go.”
Steve quirks his lips "I'm sure you could if you tried"
Steve didn’t bother arguing, just nodded and walked out, up to his room to get ready and maybe catch a few hours more of sleep while he could.
Today Tony needed to be pulled away from his lab so that he could eat because Steve found out that the entire time he had been trying to keep his distance, Tony had been lacking in nutrition and that was just no good for a member of his team.
He caught Mattias’ eye, set his shoulders and smiled apologetically, “Sorry, just a bit distracted. It’s been a long day among many.”
For all that he was Captain America, brave team leader of the Avengers, Steve had his money bet on Tony figuring it out on his own.
Steve let his hand linger, index finger tracing the bruise idly. Steve only pulled away when his gaze fell to Tony’s tongue trailing over a small knick on his bottom lip. He shuffled back, hands on his hips before falling awkwardly to his side. He diverted his eyes to the SHIELD agents loading the lizards and jerkily nodded his head toward them. “I should go help them load up—Get that looked at.” Without another word, Steve walked away, steadily ignoring the eyes on his back.
It made him bold.
He left the room as quietly as possible.
Steve nodded, tested out his limbs and received a sharp pain that tore through his left shoulder and shot straight down his arm. Dislocated, he’d know the feeling anywhere. He grimaced as he braced his arm at his side, he’d have to have it popped back into place soon. That was sure to be unpleasant. “Think you can swing by and pick me up?”
He’d excused himself early from dinner that night and no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t convince himself that it wasn’t running away.
Steve’s throat was dry, scratchy. He just managed a rough, “okay”, before Tony squeezed one more time and let go.
The doctors call it PTSD and Steve guesses that’s as good a name as any. What they don’t tell him is a sure way to fix it. They give him suggestions and he smiles and nods and promises to call them if he has any questions even when he knows he wont. He wont call when he feels like he can't breath or when every thing flashes before him too fast and too slow to hold onto. He wont call when he can't sleep at night or when he feels himself get so low that it’s a miracle he's able to get out of bed in the morning. He wont call because there's nothing they can do to make it stop.
Tony took his seat to Steve's right. "Sure you weren't. Another true fact: Bruce doesn't actually get angry and turn into a big green rage monster."
“Of course I’m not wrong. I told Fury to send me with you guys; it was a tech facility for fucks sake. I told him as much when communication went down.” Tony smirked “the only reason he didn’t throw me out was because we both knew his best bet at finding you two was me. You should have seen the look on his face.”
“Whoa, Cap, you look like hell”
The waffle iron buzzed loudly. Steve shook his head to clear it and focused just on getting his breakfast done. He filled the tray with more batter and closed it just as he heard a shuffling noise from the dining room. He looked up in time to see Tony pull Nicole close to his chest and whisper in her ear. She giggled, hands skimming up and down Tony’s sides under his shirt. His nails dug in again.
Steve frowned, continued on his way into the kitchen. When he was behind the counter he gave her another considering look. He cleared his throat quietly and smiled at her when she turned startled eyes on him “Good morning”
If he hadn’t then, then he surely must have the second that Tony’s breath puffed out at his ear. Tony let out another long breath before he actually spoke, “They found an irregularity in their systems, nothing unusual enough for alarms, but their poking at it as we speak. The scans came in, 100% match to the droids. They’re stored at a base in Voxholm.” Tony paused, tapped his fingers at Steve’s waist, sounding preoccupied, “spin me.”
“Good, how was she?”
Mattias sighed wistfully, “The missus is always on my case, always at the office, never make enough time for just the two of us. Though, it must be a bit better, seeing as you two at least work partially together.”
When Tony was done recounting their heroic rescue, one he made sure to let Steve know was 80 percent due to his own daring and intellect, 18 percent due to the others and, begrudgingly, 2 percent to magic, he hovered, hands restless as they rearranged the items on Steve’s bedside table.
Sharon nodded, turned her back on him and walked swiftly away, immediately absorbed into the crowd of strangers.
Its funny really, the way Tony's eyes light up so completely that Steve can only think 'oh, so this is what its like' before Tony's voice washes over him again, a new lightness to it that Steve only hears in passing to other people. "A sense of humor, I can't say I'm not surprised. Who knew?"
Clint rolled his eyes and pushed Steve to the door “go now. Before we have a moment.”
The guards didn’t stand a chance, Iron Man and Captain America picking everyone off silently one by one until Steve’s Avengers ID card began to bleep insistently. Then all hell broke loose.
“If they want some they can have—“
He tensed as a beautiful dame with midnight black hair and fiery red lips tapped Tony on the shoulder, leaned in close to his side and requested a dance.
Well, the knowing he was in love part was simple. The rest of it, Tony’s obliviousness, the part where he sort of hoped Tony would stay in the dark, that was complicated wrapped in doubt covered in a sprinkling of too much to handle.
Tony was so drowsy that he didn’t even say the usual ‘traitor’ that shot back every time Jarvis teamed up with someone. Especially when said someone was Steve.
“It’s been a struggle to find a moment just for the three of us and I can’t stand them anymore, so
“Thank you,” Bruce said, shutting down the project he was currently working on.
Even so, it was uncommon to find Bruce up late. Circumstances permitting, he always tried to get up early and to go to bed by midnight. He found out that a routine helped him to handle the Hulk and even the Big Guy - however dynamic - was happier if he could have his beauty sleep.
“I don’t usually speak for the others but let me do it just this time. If you think you can do whatever you please, ripping us apart and play with us as if we were nothing more than pawns, then you don’t know shit,” he spat. And with that he left the office, leaving behind a taken aback Fury.
“Spin the Bottle Karaoke? What is it?” asked Bruce a little confused. Good boy, doctor. Allow her to go on talking.
“You never had a relationship, Steve, but I never had a conventional one. The only person I’ve truly been with it’s Pepper and we were boss and employee, we knew each other basically by force of circumstances,” he explained. “Maybe–” he said, looking at Steve dead in the eye. “Maybe that’s why it took me so long,” he heaved a deep sigh.
Steve and Tony were an item.
First came Steve, who much preferred the communal floor rather than his private rooms, that sat comfortably on the loveseat opening the folder with the report he had to read and check for the next meeting with Fury.
Even if he probably said it to embarrass her, she took advantage of it. “You’re right,” she said calmly, and everyone looked at her interested, because Natasha never gave in,
“It’s been an
“It’s settled then,” smiled Steve. “I want it too, I’ve wanted for long. I say we at least try. You onboard with the idea?”
Clint’s voice resonated against the wall of the recreational room of the Avengers Tower. He hung a microphone to his mouth, yelling the lyrics into the mike while the others were either dancing or humming along with him.
“Who, me?” Clint snorted. “Not a chance. It’s just that when I finally realised it, I also figured out that they’re together for a long time now,” he explained. “And I really cannot fathom how could I have missed it!”
“Whatever it is, it’s good for you. The both of you,” she told him, picking up her book and finally settling to read it.
“That’s beside the point,” Tony brushed off easily, making Steve smile a little. “She kidnapped me, I tell you! To add insult to injury, I only drank a cup of coffee. Only one, Steve!” he exclaimed. “And just because Happy bought it when he picked me up.”
“Are you shitting me? Of course they are!” Clint exclaimed.
“Why? It always works!” exclaimed the other man.
, Tony barged into easily following the melody,
“What?” Tony asked laughing. “I mean no offence,” he said looking again towards Steve, “We all know you’re the peak of human perfection but-” and then he started laughing again.
After literally hours of fight, they won (without major injuries, which was a victory in itself) and dragged themselves back to the AvenJet, ready to come back home.
“Miss Tasha?” Clint mouthed amused.
did Tony use to choose and buy the presents?
“I can’t believe we could’ve fucked months ago,” Tony said sleepily, swaying his hips slowly and brushing his butt against Steve’s groin.
“So they’re not together…” Thor murmured a little disappointed.
“You didn’t,” she pointed out. “What about you, Bruce? Make me proud,” she said the other man, who was sipping his tea before heading down to the lab like every morning. No coffee for him, but he still needed the energy boost.
The only source of light was a small spotlight underneath the kitchen hood that cast a warm glow and soft shadows all around and wrapped everything in a bubble frozen in time.
Tony took his mug, stood up and went towards the coffeemaker, but Steve intercepted him.
“I know this mustn’t be easy for you, so let me talk first,” he said. “I’m trying to be the grown-up here for both the sake of the team and because I don’t want what happened during the karaoke night to affect our friendship.”
When the music stopped, no one cheered, no one congratulated them, no one either said a word.
She eyed him nonplussed, crossing her harms. “Please. Who do you think ordered all our presents from Tony?”
“Geez, you’re so distrustful,” huffed Natasha. “Fine. Jarvis, show them the last one, please,” said looking briefly at the ceiling.
Steve widened his eyes a little but remained silent.
, Steve sang, realization dawning on him.
Tony didn’t answer and Bruce thought that he might hide but eventually, he spoke. “It’s just that– At first I didn’t think much of it, Clint’s always been a prankster. But then I realised that maybe you agreed with him and… I don’t know, I just wanted to know why.”
The blinds slowly closed, and the lights dimmed. In the half-shadowed kitchen appeared a hologram and after a few moments of silence, a video taken from the security footage of the tower began.
“Well, you’ve got your SHIELD missions and you are a woman, it- it has never been easy for me to deal with dames,” he reasoned.
,” said heartily.
“Pepper woke me up at 6 in the morning. She barely left me time to prepare and dragged me at SI for a multitude of meetings that ended only half an hour ago,” he complained.
“Thank you, Master Barton. It will be reported to proper authorities,” he replied jokingly.
“How do you know?” Steve said surprised.
So it came as a surprise when Tony strode in all dressed up, fumbling with his tie, and let himself fall on the loveseat with a groan, half landing on Steve. To his credit, if the soldier was surprised to find himself with a lapful of Tony he didn’t show it, barely adjusting to make more room for the other man.
“Come on, let’s go get you coffee,” Steve said satisfied, closing the folder.
“Who’s reading fanfiction now?” Clint asked slily.
She opened the book, settled a little better on the couch and-
“Hey, Tony,” Steve called, looking at him.
even Tony who was always so collected faltered a little
“No, Tony. You can’t live on coffee non-stop,” he heard Steve reprimand him. “How long has it been since you ate something healthy?”
“I heard you,” he said in a thin voice. Tony looked at him disoriented but before he could ask something, Steve went on. “This time, before the impact I heard your voice. When-” he cleared his throat, trying to sound more confident. “When I asked you- When I asked Peggie to post-pone our date, she told me she would’ve waited for me the following Saturday at 8 o’clock but- but I still didn’t know how to dance. And then I heard you say, ‘I’ll show you how, just be there’, just like she did,” he explained absentmindedly caressing Tony’s knuckles with his thumb.
After a couple of minutes, Tony took the pan and poured some milk in a mug, added a dash of cinnamon and a teaspoon of honey, and put it in front of Steve placing a comforting hand between his shoulder blades.
Tony’s head snapped up and as soon as he pinpointed the mug, he chugged all the coffee. With a satisfied sigh, he put it down and dig into the dish, filling his mouth with blueberry pancakes and bacon. By the time he finished, Steve had almost cooked his breakfast again.
“I already have in mind the perfect one,” Natasha said with a small smirk.
“But,” she continued ignoring him, “since they’re not anyone else, I think we can rule the option out. There had been plenty of missions overseas in the last six months and nothing happened. I bet they just spent every night moping for not being able to sleep in the same bed,” Natasha said almost distasteful.
“How could you n- Ow!” Clint yelled, spinning his head towards Natasha, and squeezing the shin she just kicked. “What was that for?!” he asked indignantly with a high pitch.
They never heard Jarvis answer, cause the lift doors closed and Tony disappeared.
“Of course you are together,” Clint retorted.
Steve let him finish - just to be sure it was all true - then moved closer, placing his hand on Tony’s cheek, and stroking it lightly. He looked at him with dreamy eyes savouring the moment, just because he felt he could, then leaned down and kissed him softly on his lips.
“No, thank you, Steve,” Bruce replied for everyone, setting aside his book.
They all watched Steve and Tony leaving the room still laughing a little, as if Clint made the funniest joke of the year, but otherwise letting it go almost immediately and heading to bed.
“You know that since Pepper–” Tony trailed off.
“Which one?” inquired Jarvis politely.
They couldn’t know, but a couple of floor below a certain spy was collecting her payout.
When the song finished Nat exchanged a glance with Clint and Bruce, hoping they would be enough in themselves for understand and said, “Alright boys, time to liven up the night.”
Tony didn’t answer; too busy dissecting a hologram in front of his face with one hand, the other gripping the sandwich near his mouth.
Tony jumped up then, bouncing on his heals once “great! Come on, come on.” He ushered Steve along, pushing at his shoulders to get him to move faster.
Tony was his friend, his best friend even, but even he knew that it wasn’t considered normal to sit with one’s friend, practically holding hands. Friends didn’t run their thumbs over their friends bottom lip, split or not, as if it were nothing.
Steve’s eyebrows knit together and he turned the page quickly. His eyes widened at the images that greeted him on each page. “
Rule three was the only rule he could truly count on himself to follow completely. It was rule three that taught him to keep a better poker face and rule three that got him through most days. Tony would remain oblivious and Steve was alright with that.
Natasha huffed, followed by an affirmative before she signed off.
Tony mistook his frown for worry because the next moment, Steve felt a kiss on his cheek, close to his ear, “The armors only a call away, I’ll be fine. Go now.”
Steve smiled wide up at Tony as he reached out to still his hand. He squeezed it gently before twinning their fingers together, “We should go out soon. Right when I get out of her, I want to take you on a date.”
“Oh, please,” Tony groaned.
“Um, we’re really not,” Tony said amused.
That’s why he took him under his wing.
“Nothing changed since then, though,” Bruce said. “So why are you asking me now?”
It was common in Asgard to cultivate a relationship with a fellow soldier, so he wasn’t scandalised. No, it hit him strong just because how could’ve he missed it?
“ ’ Night, Steve,” he murmured peacefully, turning on his right side so that Steve could spoon him. Then, he squirmed, burying himself deeper under the covers.
“You traitor, I’m so gonna sell you at the first high school with less than a hundred students that comes up to my mind,” Tony threatened. He was going on when he felt Steve starting to shake under his hands and looked at him mildly alarmed. “Are you ok, Steve?”
He realized that he felt a sense of responsibility towards the Avengers. Being the oldest one put him in the condition of feeling morally compelled to guide them and be there for them whenever needed. And even if he still had his people to take care of, he tried to come to Earth as soon as possible.
Bruce, on the other hand, was smoking weed slouched on the couch with a dopey smile (namely literally the only way the Hulk could endure a karaoke night – Bruce was well aware of it when he proposed it but even the Hulk couldn’t put up with all the pining Tony and Steve had for each other and he was so tired of it that if this meant he wouldn’t be forced to see them with doe eyes every other then, he could be a good boy on karaoke night).
“I don’t know Nat,” said Bruce, that had remained in silence for all that time. “If it were someone else I could agree with you, but Steve is always so caring, especially with us.”
Natasha was baffled. She couldn’t for the life of her phantom how people could be so dense.
On one hand, Steve was grateful that she was like this, that she was a good listener and didn’t rush you into something. On the other hand, he almost wanted her to speak because he really didn’t know how to phrase what he wanted to say.
Tony nodded slightly. He felt a shiver run down his body. He could feel the phantom rope burns against his wrists and almost let out a chocked sob. He was never going to be free from this. He’d known that his kidnapping was personal from the minute the terrorist leader said his name, but being targeted by the one member of his family that he trusted was… he didn’t know if he could ever come back from that. He couldn’t stop thinking about all the nice things his uncle did for him. He just wanted to be held in Rhodey’s arms, but with the recent developments Rhodey probably wouldn’t be free until well after Tony returned home.
“Do you wanna walk with us to English?” Natasha asked. Tony nodded and walked with the two. He noticed them having a silent conversation with their eyes. He assumed it was about him, so he turned his attention towards his feet. He missed his life before his kidnapping. He hated being away from his family. He wanted to be back at MIT blowing shit up while Rhodey yells at him, or trying to do weird gymnastic moves while Pepper videotapes. He wanted to be home.
Steve kept their hands intertwined, but used his free one to caress Tony’s cheek. His eyes were so fond. He looked like Tony was a gift for him. He looked like Tony was all he ever wanted. Tony could feel himself getting teary, and they hadn’t kissed yet. Steve searched Tony for sincerity before smiling. With Steve’s fingers just barely touching his jaw, their lips touched for the first time. It wasn’t magical or life changing or all that different from the kisses he’d had before. Steve’s lips were slightly chapped, and the angle was a little weird because of how much taller Steve was, and his glasses were in the way but Tony didn’t care. He didn’t want it to be perfect or otherworldly. It was real. It was Steve’s hand tight around his own, and it was Steve’s fingers winding through his untamable hair, and it was Steve’s lips pressing against his. They broke apart to breathe, and Tony let out a stunned laugh.
“I’m fine. God, I’m an idiot. Sorry, I didn’t realize you would think that something was wrong.” He gripped Rhodey’s shirt to try and reassure him that he was fine.
“Would you want to have a party at Thor’s house?” He asked.
“Yes, Steve, oh my gosh, yes” Tony threw himself into the other boy’s arms causing him to stumble back into the wall. He heard Bucky snorting in the background, but he didn’t care. It was gorgeous.
He pressed his lips to Steve’s cheek for half a second before pulling away. The blonde’s face was bright red, and Tony smiled brightly.
“Can I kiss you again?” Steve asked.
“How did no one know about this? No offense, but your time at MIT was highly publicized down to every gross detail.” Clint asked with a sheepish expression.
“What?” Tony asked.
“Oh… I thought you two were…”
Feel free to leave comments!
Clint was dying in the corner. Natasha was patting him on the back because he was quickly becoming his own choking hazard. Bruce had his head in his hands, and Thor was consoling him. Let it be said that Tony never found any normal people to be friends with.
When the Avengers moved into the tower, it became a lot harder for him to keep his secret. Tony’s heels all became ‘gifts’ for Pepper because he couldn’t exactly tell the team that he liked to wear cute dresses and heels and wear makeup. The amount of ridicule he would get from Barton was deterrent enough. His dresses and makeup had to be placed in a safe controlled by JARVIS just in case someone managed to get into his bedroom. The only times he felt comfortable were when all of the Avengers were out of the tower.
“Okay Agent. I’m Tony Scott. Do you think maybe you could help me find my way to me English class? I’m a senior by the way.” Tony pushed up his glasses as he waited for the boy to respond. He hoped he would say yes. He was kind of scared about navigating the hallway alone. Filled with people, someone could touch him, touch touch touch. Tony felt like vomiting and he hoped his green face was coming off as normal first day nerd jitters to the other boy. The last thing he wanted was to blow his cover with the first person he met. Normal high school kids didn’t have extreme cases of PTSD.
Steve hands cupped Tony’s face and their lips meet. Tony’s hands came up to clutch at Steve’s broad shoulders. They broke apart to breathe and Tony rested his head on Steve’s shoulder.
“I don’t doubt it. You’re really smart, right? You were able to do that math really easily. Oh shoot. I forgot my manners. I’m Steve and this is Bucky.” Steve said with a slight blush.
“What just happened?” Bucky asked with a raised eyebrow. Tony glared at Rhodey, but he just sighed.
“Well he does have an actual name I think, but I promptly forgot it. He introduced himself with a James Bond reference. How else was I supposed to react?” Tony complained.
“No. The boys will weep when they see us. Anything less is unacceptable.” Natasha counted with a smirk.
They looked at each other in awe like neither of them could believe that this was more than a dream.
“Is this… coffee mixed with an energy drink?” Bruce asked incredulously after spitting the drink out in the grass beside him.
Tony felt pathetic, but he nodded anyway. Tony followed Bruce out of the bathroom feeling disgusted by the way he wanted to curl into Bruce’s side and skip the rest of the day. He wanted Pepper there to run her fingers through his hair and whisper sarcastic comments in his ear. He wanted Rhodey to pick him up and cradle him in his lap. He didn’t feel safe alone like this.
“Actually, I don’t know if that’s a great idea. I should probably get a ride from someone with a car. Natasha?” Tony asked desperately. The redhead nodded and climbed over the boys to get out of the booth.
“Oh, my God! I can’t believe it! Honey Bear!” Tony squealed forgetting where he was for a moment. He bounced back and forth on his heels. He was really hoping that Rhodey would be able to come and visit soon. Rhodey and Pepper were super busy all the time, but they were the only people allowed to come visit him, so he expected to be abandoned in this town for at least a month before he got to see either of them.
Dummy was Tony’s kid and it didn’t matter what anyone said to him. He would protect Dummy to the death. One of the main reasons him and Rhodey got along so well was the way that Rhodey treated Dummy. Tony embarrassingly cried out of joy for the second time- the first was when he created Dummy- when he came to his dorm one day and found Rhodey and Dummy together. Rhodey was playing fetch with Dummy, praising him, and treating him like a sentient being. Tony was a goner. He immediately burst into tears and Rhodey and Dummy spent the next half hour working together to fret over Tony until he calmed down.
“Hate you.” He mumbled sleepily.
“I’m… thinking about telling the team. Rhodey thinks I should do it on my birthday. I’m just worried…”
“Holy shit, Tony” Bucky breathed out. All of a sudden, Tony had arms wrapped around him. He buried his face in Bucky’s shoulder and let out a couple of the tears he’d been restraining. Bucky still liked him. The relief hit him like a punch to the jaw.
“No. Go to class. It’s probably nothing. I’ll come and get all of you guys if it’s something important.” Tony reassured him.
The next time they hung out outside of school, it was Friday night and for the first time ever Tony found himself at a high school football game. Natasha was sitting to his right waving a sign with Clint’s name on it. If Tony wasn’t staring right at it, he wouldn’t believe it was real. Natasha had one of Clint’s jerseys tied around her head like a bandana, and the sign was covered in sparkles. It even had a big picture of Clint printed out and pasted next to his name. He wondered whether Clint or Natasha made it. He suspected a collaboration.
“Tony, what is going on?” Steve’s voice was soft in between everyone’s screeches. His eyes were huge, and they kept flicking around the apartment like any second he would wake up from this nightmare.
“I can give you a ride” Steve said automatically. He slid out of the booth to let Tony stand.
Thor sprinted down the stairs with a huge grin on his face. He was wearing a normal black tux, but his tie looked like it was literally made of gold. He ran directly to Bruce and swung to poor genius around.
“Did I do something?” Steve’s eyes were desperate. His expression was terrible and Tony felt so guilty that he put it there.
His free period ended all too quickly, and Tony made his way to AP Chem. He hoped he had a decent lab partner or better yet no lab partner at all. Tony didn’t really play well with others in a working atmosphere. His hatred of being handed things stemmed from experiences in the lab with his father, and people working with him tended to resent his inability to hold things for them or be genuinely helpful. Tony inwardly groaned when there was only one seat left. He threw himself into his seat with a huff. For his part, his partner seemed to be equally distraught at being forced to work with someone else. The boy was adorable and Tony couldn’t help but stare just a little bit.
Tony watched Steve skip off to class. He turned back towards Tony and winked. Tony’s face lit up red. Tony loved how blissfully happy Steve looked, but he needed to deal with Rhodey.
“He cuddles like a champ” Bucky deadpanned, and the group erupted into laughter once more.
“Yeah well… not everyone is a sugary sweet as you Honey Bear. I need them to respect me. I can’t. I can’t risk it. I need this team.”
“Yeah. So?” Tony rolled his eyes before pulling a different thermos out of his bag and drinking some more.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Pepper, sweetheart, I’m dying of boredom. Entertain me.” Tony moaned as he slumped against a tree.
“Did that just happen? Do you think she…knows?” Tony wondered.
His friends had gotten over his weird behavior in the diner pretty easily. They knew about having bad days, so they didn’t judge Tony for one of his. Bucky didn’t even comment on it which Tony was shocked about. Bucky poked fun at everything, but he should have known that Bucky liked him enough not to push too hard. As much as he was an asshole, he was also sweet.
“Yeah, what the hell is Anthony Stark doing in a town like this?” Clint asked. Tony saw the hurt in his eyes. Fuck, his relationships were all going down in flames after this. Maybe Natasha would still talk to him.
Bucky snatched it and sniffed, “well, it’s not alcohol.”
Their shaky friendship was solidified by the maniacal glint in both of their eyes as they stared at the chemicals on their desk. Without speaking they began to work in tandem, both purposefully screwing up the ratio of chemicals in order to get a huge explosion. It was an ‘innocent’ enough mistake, and Tony was positive that Bruce had the innocent act down. All he had to do was look down, polish his glasses, and everyone watching was a goner. Tony would have to get him to teach him that trick sometime. He wasn’t adept enough with his glasses to pull it off. He just looked like a confused asshole.
“Who all would be coming?” Tony asked cautiously.
“Okay, Tony, do you think you can explain what’s going on now?” Steve asked.
involved. The two were practically brothers. Tony spent a lot of time worrying about whether or not Bucky would mention anything to Steve.
“Holy shit.” Bucky whispered. Both boys turned to face him and he was looking right at Tony’s blueprints. “That’s insane. I keep up with all the new science inventions and that is… whoa.”
“Since I met you, douchebag”
“Don’t worry about it.” Tony responded absentmindedly. He was scribbling with his right hand and taking desperate sips from the bottle ever couple of seconds.
“It’s not what you think,” Tony scratched at his hair, “Does Clint know? Who I am.”
Tony flinched a little bit before nodding. He led the group to his living room where everyone sat down.
He turned around and quickly gave Rhodey a kiss on the cheek before climbing back into the car. The car sped away and the group of friends looked at each other.
“Yeah, I’m fine.” Tony let go of Steve reluctantly. The man got off the bike quickly and turned back to Tony. His eyebrows were pulled up, and his huge blue eyes were wide with concern. Tony didn’t say anything else, but he did grab Steve to help stabilize him while he was climbing off of the motorcycle.
“I think you look very pretty.” She said with a soft smile before turning and leaving.
“Apparently the boys are having technical difficulties with getting Bucky’s hair to behave.” Natasha snorted again, and showed the boys a photo of a grumpy looking Bucky with multiple clips sticking out of his tangled hair.
“Happy Birthday!” They cheered.
“That’s pretty self-centered Rhodey.” Tony said with a roll of his eyes.
“Natasha. That sign is an abomination.” Tony proclaimed.
Tony tried to say something, but he couldn’t. Oh god, his uncle ordered a hit on him, and he was in danger, and by proxy all of his friends were in danger. He needed to tell them who he was, but he couldn’t do it out in the open. They needed to be somewhere secure where Tony could make sure no one was listening.
“U-Uncle Obie” Tony choked out. His head was spinning. His uncle was the one that ordered the hit on him. His uncle… was responsible for him being tortured. It didn’t make sense. He couldn’t believe it.
“Yes, Tony, sweetheart, yes.” Tony practically leapt into Steve’s arms, and even though he could hear the others groaning and laughing, he couldn’t seem to care.
Bucky slid down the banister like an idiot before stopping in front of Natasha. He looked like he was going to go for a cheek kiss but then thought better of it. He stuck his hand out for an awkward handshake, and Tony thought he was going to die laughing. He was practically on the floor giggling before he realized someone was standing in front of him.
“You’re an idiot, Tones. And I missed you too. Not as much as I missed Dummy though.” He returned with a cheeky wink.
Jarvis opened the door and motioned for Tony to exit. Tony pranced out the door and smiled when he looked at his car. It wasn’t his prized Audi of course; it would be too conspicuous for him to roll up at a public high school in a fancy sports car. It was an old car that he had picked up from a junkyard and promptly tricked out in his workshop. He was happy with it, and there was something soothing about working on the simple mechanics of a car. It was a nice break from the extremely stimulating work that he did with holographics and AIs. It was nice to be able to mute his thoughts for a little bit and just work with his hands.
“Why? You love hanging out at Thor’s. You’re there much more than the rest of us.” Bucky pointed out with a confused look on his face.
“What the hell?” He exclaimed.
“Hey, stop that. I came straight here.” Rhodey said with a roll of his eyes. They both knew that Rhodey always went to see Tony as soon as he got done with his missions.
Bruce gestured towards his class and Tony grinned a bit hysterically, “Thanks, Big Green.”
“Tony, are you even paying attention to me?” Clint asked.
“You should be careful Tony. You don’t want to get on his bad side. He’s on the football team and he’s wicked popular. Also, his biceps are like the size of your face.” Tony blinked at the other boy but didn’t say anything “Never mind. Let’s just get you to class okay? Oh and by the way a couple of my friends are in this class. Their names are Clint and Natasha. You should say hi to them. I need to leave or I’ll be late. Bye, Tony.”
“Tony. You look beautiful. Happy Birthday.” Bruce interrupted his ramblings with a soft smile.
“Anthony. We have missed you!” Thor declared loudly.
That was shockingly sweeter than Tony had expected it to be.
“Snot is a perfectly respectable insult thank you very much.” Tony put his nose in the air and made a face.
For the most part, his friends bantered back and forth while leaving him out of it. They could tell that he was invested in whatever he was working on. Tony pulled a thermos out of his backpack and chugged it. Bruce glanced down to see the whole bag was filled with them.
Tony let out a strangled noise and pushed his hands through his hair, “no more than I was before. The fact that someone probably has a hit out on me isn’t new information.”
He strolled into the front doors and his eyes widened at the sounds that assaulted him. Everyone was talking, laughs and jeers could be heard from all directions. Tony closed his eyes suddenly overstimulated. His captivity had gotten him so used to the utter lack of noise and visuals that he was still scared by touch and loud sounds when he didn’t know they were coming. After all, it had only really been about two weeks since he was rescued, and most of that time was spent in a hospital bed and (a useless) debriefing with the police. He hadn’t had anytime to try and work on his irrational fear of loud noises, and people touching him, and the sound and feel and sight of water. At least Anthony Stark had none of those fears. It was just another detail that would separate his two identities.
“I’m sorry. I-I’ve never had that happen before.” Tony muttered avoiding eye contact with the other genius.
Tony on the other hand felt like his brain was short circuiting. Steve thought he was pretty. No way. He looked over at the boy to see if he could spot any signs of deception. Steve looked like he’d rather be jumping out of an airplane than having this conversation. His face was a bright red the spread to his ears and down his neck. People didn’t get this embarrassed when they were joking. Tony was shocked.
“Yeah. Rhodey had to leave. Deployed to Afghanistan.” Tony mumbled.
“Hammertech sucks” Tony mumbled.
“Yes?”
“It was my uncle. God. It was my fucking uncle. He told me he loved me. He held me when I couldn’t stop crying because my dad was being a dick. He took me to get ice cream when the house was empty. He told me that I was going to have a future. That I didn’t have to build weapons. I trusted him. I trusted him, and he turned around and sold me to terrorists. He wanted me to die. He probably still does. That’s why I can’t go home to the only three people who have ever loved me like a family. He could have paid someone that would actually put a bullet in my head on command. I miss Rhodey, and my best friend Pepper, and Jarvis, and being able to go outside without being terrified, and being able to swim in a fucking pool without getting panic attacks, and not having gruesome scars all over my body. I miss not having to hide. But I can’t have any of those things because my own uncle betrayed me. My own fucking uncle.” Tony grabbed a wrench from the table and threw it as hard as he could. It smashed into the wall, but he didn’t feel better. He let out a strangled scream.
“Nope, Baby girl you are ready for this. You shouldn’t have to hide who you are.” Tony’s face turned as red as it always did whenever anyone referred to him with a feminine nickname, but he made a small contented noise. Rhodey gave Tony a dazzling smile. Tony blushing bright red over being called pretty or baby girl was always so cute to see.
Tony left lunch feeling like he just maybe gained a group of friends. Bucky and Steve walked with him to their math class. They sat on either side of him and Tony felt like he was signing his death warrant. The teacher was explaining something that he had obviously already mastered so he pulled out his notebook and worked more on blueprinting and the logistics of his holographic video chat system. He worked until he felt a tap on his shoulder.
“I love you, Platypus. Bye.” He pushed his pone back in his pocket and walked back to the living room. The movie was paused and they were all looking at him. Whelp… that was embarrassing.
“Shower first then emotional conversations. I don’t want to hear you bitching about your messed up skin when you leave your makeup on for too long.” Tony rolled his eyes, but pecked Rhodey on the cheek before disappearing from the room. Rhodey groaned before burying his face beneath the blanket. Tony sure was a handful.
Clint was Natasha’s right hand man and was basically the funniest person Tony had ever met. Tony was pretty sure that Clint could patent his eye roll as a weapon of mass destruction. That man was even snarkier than Tony himself. He often found himself engaged in heated banter battles with the other boy, and both of them would leave the conversations flushed and grinning. He also did his very best to distract the teacher when Tony was doing inventing work during class. That was much appreciated.
“We can’t talk about this here. Tony, can we go to your house? I imagine you’ll be safest there.” Natasha’s voice was barely concealing rage.
“Um… sure.” Tony responded. He sat his notebook on the table without thinking and started explaining the math problem to Steve in a way that he would understand it.
“We try to have sleepovers every once in a while as a friend group, and we figured since you joined that we should have one.” Steve continued apparently missing Tony’s bright red face and confused expression. Right well. That made much more sense than Steve asking Tony on a date in front of all their friends.
“It’s okay. It’s boring. I’m relatively okay. The hallways are loud and crowded. Your fighting services are not needed. I met a weirdly chipper junior. His name’s Agent. Don’t be worried Mom, I’m fine.” Tony answered in monotone.
Steve looked completely dumbstruck, and it was the most beautiful thing Tony had ever seen. Tony didn’t care that Steve shouldn’t like him. He didn’t care about all the things that made him not worth loving. All he cared about was that Steve was looking at him like he was the best thing he’d ever seen. He was looking at Tony’s dumb brown eyes like they held the secrets of the universe.
“Why? Did you get too overwhelmed with my ability to insult your best friend? Because if so, then yes.” Tony joked before Steve was giggling and leaning in again.
“Watch where you’re going, nerd.” The boy disappeared back into the crowd, and Tony barely managed to hide his flinch when Phil grabbed his arm to pull him back to his feet.
Bruce didn’t seem to be able to come up with an excuse. He did spend most of his time with Thor. The two of them just got along like a house on fire. His face was pained, and he was looking at Tony apologetically.
“Tony, Jesus. What’s wrong?” Bruce asked. The boys were looking at him strangely.
Tony pulled into the driveway where Jarvis’s car had been that morning. Tony felt a tightening in his throat and looked away. He was going to be alone. Truly alone, in this strange place. He didn’t have any sort of defense out here. He had his money here, which he wasn’t allowed to use for anything else but like food. So, he couldn’t protect himself with that. He couldn’t protect himself with his name. He couldn’t protect himself by threatening to tell Pepper and Rhodey. These people didn’t even know Pepper and Rhodey. Tony felt sick all of a sudden. He walked into the house and dropped onto his knees so he could address Dummy from his height.
He thought about it. So many things were happening. His uncle had been caught, and the search for threats was coming to a close. He would be returning home soon. His friends would be graduating high school in a month. He was about to go to prom with the love of his life. He blinked.
He held his breath when he saw all his friends were all gathered around underneath the tree outside where they normally met afterschool. They were smiling and laughing, but Steve’s posture was rigid. Tony knew he probably looked pale. He could feel that his eyes were huge, and he knew that they were red and swollen from glancing in the bathroom mirror. His face was slack and emotionless, but he couldn’t help the shivers that ran through him every couple of seconds. The conversation stopped immediately when he approached. He locked eyes with Natasha.
“It’s still going to take a while to get everything worked out. We haven’t confronted him yet because we’re worried that he’ll retaliate by ordering another hit on you. Even if we get him arrested, he still might have already paid someone to come after you. We’re going to go to law enforcement and try to get him arrested as quietly as possible. We don’t want to have what you went through on the record. Then, we need to do everything we can to make sure that no one is coming after you on his orders. I’m sorry, Tony, but you’re going to need to stay longer.” Tony felt his stomach fall. He wanted to stay with his friends, but he also really wanted to be safe. The idea that people were still after him was terrifying. If they found him before Rhodey found them, then Tony could end up kidnapped again. Or shot on sight. He wasn’t sure which one was worse.
Bruce helped his nearly catatonic friend to the nearest bathroom and began to grab paper towels to clean him off. Tony’s face was deathly pale and Bruce was worried about the way Tony was sucking in breaths. He cleaned his face off and then grabbed Tony’s hand and placed it on his chest.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No.” Bruce said turning to walk away.
Tony stepped out from behind Rhodey with a bright red face. His hand laced together with Pepper’s.
His uncle was still out there. He could have already paid people to finish the job. If the wrong people heard about where he was hiding, then he’d end up with a bullet in his head. He wasn’t stupid. He was supposed to die during his kidnapping. His uncle wanted him to die, but he survived, and he knew that most likely Obadiah there was doing his very best to change that.
“You seemed mighty happy in there.” Clint said with a smirk. He waggled his eyebrows suggestively.
“Obadiah”
The downside of the explosion was that Bruce didn’t duck quickly enough and was splattered with the bright green chemical. It wasn’t acid or anything so Bruce would be fine, which was information enough for Tony to burst into uncontrollable laughter at this sight of his new friend looking perfectly at home coated in green. Tony had to admit it complemented his purple shirt well. The random thought caused Tony to burst into giggles again. At this point the rest of the class had cleared out and the two teens were the only ones in the room. Bruce wiped his face off with a paper towel and the two exited the room.
“This is the funniest thing I’ve ever seen.” Clint laughed and smacked Tony in the arm, “you really were a baby genius”
As soon as he got to the bathroom he flung his shirt off and held his head in his hands. His friends were going to find out the truth sooner or later. He was a celebrity. Someone was going to recognize him. He was shocked no one had already. He needed to stop getting so attached to people that were just going to leave when they found out who he was. The door opened, and Tony cursed himself for not locking it. It was Natasha in the doorway. She closed the door behind her and knelt down next to him. Her eyes flicked down to the large network of scars covering his chest and then back up to his face.
“It’s okay, Dummy. It’s okay, buddy. I’m okay. These are my friends. They’re not going to hurt you.” Tony ran a soft affectionate hand down the arm of his robot.
Tony was now standing outside of Steve’s house clutching a bag against his shoulder. He was nervous about this group sleepover thing they decided to do. He didn’t want to expose his scars, but it isn’t exactly normal to lounge around in button up shirts at sleepovers. Instead, he layered a nerdy tee shirt over a long-sleeved tee shirt and was wearing a pair of black sweatpants. It felt very 2000s, but he prayed that no one would call him out on it. Hopefully it wouldn’t be too hot inside. He rang the doorbell and waited. Steve opened the door with a wide grin. He was wearing a very tight white tee shirt. Tony did his very best not to drool. He followed Steve into the house and was greeted with an amusing sight. Natacha had her feet propped on top of Clint’s legs and Bruce situated on the ground in front of Clint. Thor was sprawled across the floor with his head in his hands as he watched the movie screen. Bucky had one arm slung over the side of an empty couch where Steve probably was. Tony blinked and looked at Bucky’s arm again. It was metal! Repeat. Not a drill. His arm is metal. His mouth fell open. The group was watching Tony with weary eyes as if they were waiting for him to say something offensive. He swallowed.
Steve burst in laughter, “Oh my god, he’s going to be the worst. I wonder if he’ll make more or less innuendos when we’re actually together.”
“Holy shit a hit? Like someone is trying to murder you? What?” Bucky exclaimed.
“Rhodey and I met at MIT. I’ve already graduated college by the way. After I got to know him, Rhodey ended up becoming the consultant between Stark Industries and the Army. Something about preserving the new generation, but he never told the Army anything I didn’t want him to. We were together in Afghanistan to give a weapons demonstration when I was kidnapped.” Tony stopped for a minute. He wondered how much he should tell them.
“I hate all of you” Steve said.
Thanks for reading :)
“Awe, honey.” Tony soothed.
“Yeah, it was” Steve still looked like he was struggling to believe it.
“You-you made me an arm?” Bucky asked. He looked stunned.
When she pulled out of his driveway, he didn’t feel alone like he normally did.
“Buck” Steve exclaimed angrily before being interrupted by the man himself.
The rest of their best friends gathered around and joined the group hug.
“Shut up. Are you in active danger?” Natasha questioned.
The first-time Tony met Rhodey, he was drunk off his ass. He was blasting ACDC, lying on his bed, and probably crying. He had gotten in an argument with Howard that he couldn’t really remember, but it had upset fifteen-year-old him quite a lot. Rhodey walked into the room and promptly walked out. Tony figured he had already fucked up his relationship with his roommate which only made him cry harder because how was he so bad at making friends? Was he really as horrible at socializing as Howard told him? Tony was shocked when Rhodey returned with a large box of tissues and a hangover concoction that the boy next door apparently had down to a pat. Rhodey didn’t turn off his music which was an instant love connection in Tony’s book. He just sat down next to Tony and waited for the boy to calm down. They had a heartfelt conversation which ended with Tony spilling all of his insecurities to a boy he barely knew. When it sunk in, Tony was so horrified that he promptly passed out. He woke up with an Advil and hangover concoction on the table next to him. Taped to his chest was a note that read – ‘You aren’t the dick I thought you were going to be. Let’s hang out when you aren’t super drunk. You seem pretty cool. James Rhodes.’ They had been best friends ever since.
“Yeah yeah love you too squirt.” Rhodey replied fondly. Rhodey didn’t know how long he sat there playing with Tony’s hair before he fell asleep himself.
“Tony, where have you been? Are you okay?” Steve asked taking a hesitant step towards him. He was the only one who knew he’d gotten a call from Rhodey after all.
Tony pulled into the parking lot of the school. He hoped the school had a well-stocked science lab or he was going to pitch a fit. It physically pained him to waste so much time going to school when he could be a home inventing and working. Maria was convinced that the only way he would go undetected was to blend in, and a teenage recluse living alone and not going to school didn’t really constitute blending in. Someone would find him that way. They were looking for someone in hiding, not a high school kid.
Natasha was rapidly becoming one of Tony’s best friends. The last thing Tony thought he wanted was another deadly red head in his life, but apparently, he did. Natasha was deceptively graceful, but there was a certain glint in her eye that revealed her true nature. While she was certainly tough on the outside, she was very sweet with Tony. Tony hadn’t told her anything specifically about why he was in hiding, but he got the feeling that she had a pretty good idea. She had even given him some pointers on making sure that his cover wasn’t broken. It was nice having someone on his side despite who he was.
Steve responded with a poetic, “Dummy?”
Bruce was sitting to the right of Tony in Bucky’s jersey. Bruce had rolled his eyes when he took it and asked Bucky if he wanted to go steady. Bucky had growled back about Steve making the team give their jerseys to people, and he didn’t want to lose another hand by asking Natasha. Bruce was a similar size to Tony, but he’d chosen to wear a hoodie on the outside of the jersey that kept it from slipping off his shoulders. Tony debated doing that, but he liked the idea of Steve’s last name and number being legible on his back. Sue him.
Tony nodded, and Natasha turned towards the rest of their friend group.
“It’s okay. I freaked out when I got bullied for the first time. I think I cried for a solid three hours.” Tony stared at the other boy incredulously, but his face seemed sincere. “Classes are starting soon. We should probably get going. Do you want me to walk you to your history class?” Bruce asked.
“This isn’t fair. My friends can’t team up against me. Steve tell them to stop.” Tony pouted once again.
“I don’t know… I kind of want to see more of these baby pictures.” Steve responded with a small smirk.
He spent the rest of the day in a glum hungover silence. He knew that his friends were sending each other concerned glances, but he couldn’t muster enough energy to care. Rhodey was gone again. He could be dead for all Tony knew. He hated the not knowing so much. It was unbearable. He knew that this was how Rhodey must have felt when he got kidnapped. His heart ached. Natasha gripped his hand under the table.
“What if he thinks? I’m a-a-a freak. He’s from the forties. I can’t… I really like him and maybe it’s better if I don’t come out tonight. It’s not that big of a deal. I can just go put a suit on and-” Tony stuttered.
“Of course, I did, idiot. I like my innuendo filled one armed jock too, okay? Walking around with Hammertech on your body is basically the equivalent of someone hurting you, and I couldn’t let that slide.” Tony joked.
“Me too.”
“This is blasphemy. I thought we had something special. Steve! Rhodey’s being mean to me.” Tony pouted and looked back to his group of friends that were regarding him with amusement.
“Not even a little bit.” Tony shot back with a smile. Clint sputtered, and then stuck his tongue out.
Bucky snorted into his milkshake but didn’t say anything.
“Hey-” Tony yelled, but Bucky had already tossed the thermos to Bruce who didn’t hesitate before taking a sip.
Pepper was more of an accident. Pepper was one of Rhodey’s many friends. Rhodey had to go visit Mamma Rhodes one weekend and was worried about Tony blowing himself up and setting fire to their dorm room. In all fairness, Tony only set fire to the dorm once and it was small. He put it out quickly enough so that the only thing it burned were Rhodey’s textbooks. He paid for them of course so no harm done. Rhodey didn’t see it that way. Rhodey called Pepper and asked her to babysit him. Pepper upon seeing the fifteen-year-old enveloped in a huge MIT sweatshirt was instantly struck with the desire to protect him. Tony hadn’t liked her in the beginning until one day she was scanning over his calculations and pointed out a math mistake he made when he was drunk. From that day on Virginia became Pepper and the two were inseparable.
“That sounds fun” Tony said. He would enjoy seeing Thor’s house. Apparently, his parents were loaded and were frequently out of town. Thor had described his house as super modern which meant it probably wouldn’t even remind Tony of his childhood mansion. All in all, it sounded super fun. Tony had never been to any parties that weren’t based around the desire to consume as much alcohol as possible. College was fun that way. And it was probably good that it wasn’t a big party, despite his hatred of crowds, he’d hated parties for a while. Tiberius had enjoyed them a little too much, and he preferred not to be reminded about his past relationships.
“Welcome to Shield, Nerd.” Tony narrowed his eyes at the boy before realizing when he had in his hand. He had nowhere to run when the cup of water went crashing into his face. It was cold, shit. Shit. He was drowning. He couldn’t breathe, help someone help. He was cold and he couldn’t see anything. All he felt was the hand pressing on his neck keeping his face underwater. Help please. Help. He can’t breathe. Water in his lungs and eyes and nose and mouth. Help.
Tony had only ever told three people about his secret. His aunt Peggy, Rhodey and Pepper were the only ones he trusted enough. They all took it amazingly, and Tony cried without fail each time. Now it was second nature for all of them. Peggy of course was much to old now to hang out and do Tony’s nails, but she would periodically send him cute jewelry and makeup in the mail. Rhodey and Pepper however had a strict strategy for making sure Tony didn’t feel ashamed of himself. They went shopping together all the time; Pepper was in charge of helping Tony pick out clothes, and Rhodey was responsible for telling Tony he looked ridiculously hot and bantering with Tony when he got self conscious.
He woke up with Natasha’s hands in his hair and his feet on Steve’s lap. Tony blinked his eyes open and saw Steve watching him with a fond expression. He felt his face heat up and hid his face in Natasha’s lap. That was so embarrassing. He could not have a crush on the most popular boy in school. Rhodey was going to have a fit.
“You have a heart condition!” Steve growled. Tony shrunk into Rhodey’s arms. Steve seemed to soften a little bit at the sight. “Tony what if something happened?”
“Hey! How was your first day of school, Tones?”
He had curly chocolate brown hair and big blue eyes. His purple button up hugged his body, and Tony was struck by how good the nerd looked. He was suddenly angry at his own failure to look cute in his nerd get up. He looked like an idiot five-year-old and this kid looked like a genius Adonis. Simply not fair.
“I’m taking my baby genius home. It was nice to meet you.” Rhodey said with a smile before hurling Tony into the passenger’s seat of the car.
“Thor and I are going as best friends. Bucky is going with you because he was afraid you’d murder him if you said no. Clint is literally going with that junior named Phil who is meeting us at prom. And, Steve stares at Tony so much that I doubt Tony in any way could surprise him.” Bruce snarked back.
Natasha pointedly looked at his scars, “I have a feeling that you can qualify as one of the victims of that mass murderer.”
“It was my uncle.” Tony managed to say. His other friends were asking questions and looked extremely confused, but Natasha got it. Her face darkened dangerously.
“I can stay with you.” Steve offered seeing Tony’s panicked expression.
Steve shrugged, “I dunno. I just thought that cloud kind of looked like our principle.” He gestured towards a cloud directly about them.
“I’ve missed you so much oh my god. You would not believe how lonely it is in the bed without you.” He wasn’t lying either. At MIT, they used to sleep in the same bed to try and keep Tony’s nightmares away. Tony had a lot more nightmare fuel now, and he missed his bed mate very much. It was horrible trying to go to sleep all by himself. Dummy tried to cuddle him as best he could, but there is only so much a robot can do. Tony (as much as he’d never admit it) was a cuddler, and he really needed human contact to be comfortable. He would manage though. He managed for all the years before he’d met Rhodey, and he’ll manage for however long he has to after.
“What?”
“Come on Buck. We can do it. How hard can it be?” Tony directed his attention towards the second voice. Holy Shit. He changed his mind. Now he was done for. The boy had bright blue eyes and neat blond hair. He was just as ripped as his counterpart and looked like the epitome of an American sweetheart. Tony wanted a piece of that apple pie. Tony made an internal reminder to stab himself with a fork as soon as one became available. There were limits to how stupid Tony allowed his mind to get and that comment just crossed the line.
The rest of their friends were already situated at a corner booth. They slid in the end, and Tony grabbed a French fry and shoved it in his mouth. He couldn’t say anything embarrassing about how much he wished Steve would go dancing with him if his mouth was full.
Thor was always around with a smile or well-placed comment. He had a habit of throwing his arm around Tony’s shoulders during lunch or when they were walking around the school. He seemed to have a radar for when Tony was upset. He always appeared when Tony was freaking out to either glare at whatever was upsetting Tony or wrap Tony up in a warm hug. Tony would never admit that being lifted up into a hug was actually kind of fun and comforting. He wasn’t short; Thor was just ridiculously tall.
“I just wanted to tell you. Get back to your sleepover, you crazy kid.”
Natasha smirked at him, “Everyone always cheers super obnoxiously at football games, right?”
Tony risked a desperate glance at Steve and Bucky. Bucky still looked upset. Steve was staring at Tony unflinchingly. Tony swallowed and then nodded.
They sat in silence for a few minutes. Tony took that time to observe his companion. Steve was wearing a white shirt with the sleeves rolled up. His muscles were on full display. His jeans were close to threadbare, and there was a rip over his knee. He didn’t know why the little piece of skin showing was so appealing. Maybe it was just because it was Steve. Tony thought everything about him was endearing. Steve was biting his bottom lip and staring at the sky.
“Tony is going to be a thousand times worse with him here.” Bucky drawled. Bruce nodded in exasperated agreement.
“Yeah… no.” Steve responded before tossing Tony’s things at Bucky. He grabbed Tony by the shoulders and pushing him into a horizontal position with his head in Steve’s lap. He started to protest, but Steve shushed him. “You lost your speaking privileges by being stupid.”
Tony grinned and walked into the history classroom. He spent the entire time thinking up more green nicknames to call Bruce when he next sees him. That class went by pretty quickly. Time flies when you are slacking off. That’s the motto Tony lives by, which is ironic because he works more than most people ever have.
“Bye, Honey Bear” Tony hit the end call button and tried to stay calm. He was still in public after all. He needed to get somewhere else. He couldn’t afford to lose it on the quad in front of the other students. He was supposed to be in class, but there was no way that was happening now. He tucked his pocket and walked to the bathroom on autopilot. He slammed the stall door closed and lowered himself onto the ground. A couple of tears were slipping out, but mostly, he just felt numb.
“That is the most badass thing I have ever seen.” Tony blurted before covering his mouth horrified. “SHIT. I’m sorry sometimes my mouth just goes without permission and I say stupid things that make people hate me and I’m sorry I just said that about your arm that is so insensitive it’s just like I like robots and mechanics and I’m so sorry gosh I’m the worst.”
“It’s okay, kid. It’s HammerTech. Top of the line.” He punctuated the sentence with a smirk, and Tony tried not to vomit. Maybe one day when Tony wasn’t in hiding anymore he could build Bucky an arm that would 1000% be better than any HammerTech one. He knew he couldn’t comment though because it would bring him dangerously close to territory he isn’t supposed to discuss. God, HammerTech. That was so gross.
“I know. I trust you.” He responded. Her face looked stunned like he’d given her a gift. Maybe she knew how he had a hard time trusting people. Maybe he knew that Tony was just as shocked at his words as she was. Tony imagined his face looked similar to hers. The fact that she was showing this much genuine emotion on her face was rare. She was trusting him just as much as he was trusting her.
“Oh… my parents they aren’t really around.” He thought about Howard locked in his workshop and Maria always on vacation. They had never really been around even when he was a young child. The only real parental figure he had was Jarvis, and he was gone now too.
Their football team had won. Tony wasn’t entirely sure about the rules of football considering he’d never seen the game be played before, but Bruce informed him that Thor, Steve, and Bucky had managed to secure the win for the whole team. Tony was mostly focused on absolutely not watching the way Steve ran around. He was the captain for goodness sake! Tony could not be more cliché. He was literally crushing on the captain of the football team. Rhodey was going to lose it.
It all began one day when Natasha walked in on them sitting on the couch after a particularly harsh mission.
Bruce made some tea and then settled in his armchair with a mug in a hand and a paperback in the other.
“Oh! Did I miss something?” Tony perked up. “Spill it. Who it is?”
After a mission, Natasha liked to pamper herself using the coconut shower gel Clint gave her for Christmas and braiding her hair loosely so that the next day it would be naturally wavy.
“Morning,” he mumbled. They knew he wasn’t very talkative when he just got up, so Steve didn’t mind.
“The door,” Bruce pointed out, raising his voice a little and watching Tony manage a last-minute veer off and leave with his head in the clouds. Then, he shook his head with a smirk and shut down the lab. For today he worked enough.
It wasn’t until several months later that they heard again about Steve and Tony as Steve-and-Tony.
“I think someone here had too much beer. Time to go to bed, boys,” she said cryptically, putting an end at the evening.
Bruce kept quiet a little taken aback. It had been months by now. An answer was due, though, especially since Tony stood there uncharacteristically honest.
New Year’s Eve, Easter and Memorial Day have come and gone, and now summer was just around the corner. Natasha sat on the couch, her legs stretched on the cushion beside her and a massive book written in Russian on her lap. She just came back from a mission and after a shower, she was planning to spend the afternoon loafing about since dinner.
“Fine, but then you go straight to bed,” the other allowed.
The living room was empty except for Tony who entered stealthily with his arms full of bags and boxes. He placed them all under the tree until only a squared package was left. Looking at it, he took a deep breath and stroked it gently with a calm and relaxed expression you could not easily find on him, before putting it with the other presents and go straight towards the elevator.
In all honesty, the person he worried about the most was Steve.
“WHAT?!” he squawked, spitting cereals all over the kitchen countertop and straightening up so fast that he fell off the stool with a loud thud.
When Steve finally arrived, the door of the workshop was unexpectedly open, and the music played softly in the background. Tony wasn’t even hiding in a secure spot away from prying eyes. On the contrary, he stood behind the workbench directly facing the lift and when he saw Steve approaching he didn’t even panic. He deeply sighed, his shoulders sagged a little, but other than that he stayed still with a rather serious but otherwise calm expression on his face, waiting patiently for Steve to move closer. Uh. That was unusual.
“At once, Miss Tasha,” complied the AI.
“You’re serious? There aren’t video cameras scattered around the floor and a crew ready to shoot my debacle, right?” asked only half-jokingly.
Everybody knew.
“Do you-”
“He really is in love with Steve, isn’t he?” said Bruce.
Steve was standing in Fury’s office at Shield’s, while the Agent was sitting on the comfy chair behind the desk. It must’ve been recorded recently because blossoming trees could be seen through the windows. The joyful atmosphere, though, didn’t reflect on their mood. The air in the room was tense, Steve’s shoulders were stiff, and he was in ‘Captain America’ full mode. The silence stretched for several long moments until he spoke.
“Well, it’s all the same for me, really,” said Steve quietly. And if someone noticed that the top of his ears was a little red, no one said anything.
“Hey,” Steve murmured, “Breakfast’s ready,” he said, stroking again his hair.
“Of course, thanks, J,” Nat replied ignoring the archer. “If we want it to work we better get started.”
Sometimes it was a battle at board games (with a fair amount of alcohol involved), other times it was karaoke, but more often than not they just slouched on the comfortable couches and armchairs scattered around the living room, eating takeout, and watching a movie.
“You’re too smart for your own good, you know?” he huffed, stirring his coffee.
The first notes of Little Talks blared in the room and everyone started dancing with their arms in the air and swaying their hips following the rhythm of the song while Nat and Bruce sang a line each.
Tony looked at him flabbergasted and after a moment hugged him from behind, placing his chin on his shoulder. More minutes passed in silence until Steve said, “I’m not heartbroken anymore, but it always upsets me when I have this dream. It’s just… It’s been an emotional moment and it’s not an easy one to re-experience.”
“Alright, gramps’.”
God, surely Tony understood Steve had feelings for him and now hated him. Sure, they had a good relationship but just because they were friends - and above all had boundaries, Steve – it didn’t mean that they could be more. Even so, he knew he had to talk to Tony, for the sake of the team if not for anything else.
“Jarvis!” Clint exclaimed. “By the way, aren’t you breaking some sort of NDA?” he asked, eyeing the ceiling.
“Err, Tony?” answered Clint, as if it were obvious.
“So, you two are going to come together?” Tony asked apropos of nothing one night while end credits rolled on the TV screen, drinking noisily from a straw.
“Well thank
One day, Fury had called to tell them that the AvenJet was waiting for them on the landing pad because they were needed somewhere in Brazil. What they thought to be a routine mission, turned out to be a long, tiring battle against a man who could control basically every material.
At the same time, though, they couldn’t
At first, he didn’t understand why the Captain seemed so out of his element. From what he’d heard, he was a hero, a legend even. So how could he be so uncomfortable and out of touch in his own home?
Before the door closed, they could hear Tony say, “I knew you were my favourite for a reason.”
“For God’s sake…” he murmured. “Could you take me to him, Jarvis?”
Tony stood there frozen for a moment and then plopped himself on a chair, dropping his mask.
Steve was too judgemental, Tony was too proud, Natasha was too harsh, Bruce was too reclusive, Thor was too condescending, and Clint was too distressed to think straight.
“Did she what?” asked Tony, lowering down his forearm and looking up at Steve.
They stood there in companionable silence for a couple of minutes and then Steve placed (his) breakfast in front of Tony, who didn’t even move.
Natasha stared at them and merely raised an eyebrow.
“Sir might want to be a little more precise,” Jarvis stalled.
“We already discussed this, lock them in a closet it’s not a viable solution,” Bruce said strictly. “Best case scenario, Tony has a panic attack due to his PSTD and vomits on top of Steve’s shoes and they will never talk to each other – Tony because of shame and Steve because he would find a way to blame himself.”
“Good morning,” Steve said, briefly turning his head.
“What?! Are you crazy? How could I ever be- Wait, what did you just say?” asked Steve in a sombre voice.
“Alright-alright boss,” Clint crooned, with his hands up.
“There, drink it,” Tony said quietly pushing again the mug towards him, not commenting on what Steve said.
They stood there for a moment, a bit unsure of what to do and then smiled, huffing a small laugh, and lied in bed side by side. They couldn’t pinpoint when sleeping together had become a habit but was it really so wrong?
“I’ve been told,” Bruce replied with a smirk. “So, what do you want to talk about? And please,” he added when Tony opened his mouth. “Don’t beat around the bush. Whatever it is, I won’t judge.”
Maybe it was because of the Tesseract, maybe it wasn’t, but even when everybody thought that the Avengers project was a pipe dream, Clint never had a doubt.
“If it helps, I think it has real chance to work,” Jarvis offered politely.
“Fine, next one J,” said Natasha, turning back towards the hologram.
“Alright, boys,” she said a couple of days later during breakfast when it was only her, Clint, and Bruce. She had specifically waited for a moment in which both the lovebirds wouldn’t be there, and finally this morning Tony was still buried in his lab and Steve was already out for his morning run. “Who noticed
She observed him walk across the room and before he could enter the lift she stopped him.
“I think I do,” he simply said, turning his stool towards Tony. “And a pause was due anyway.”
She studied him for a moment, her face unreadable as always. He could never have said what she was thinking, and it was both amazing and distressing.
After a little pause, he went on. “I’m happy, you know?” he said, raising his head and looking at Tony. “In the last few days I thought you didn’t want to talk to me anymore, I thought you were angry and that our friendship was over. But when you said you wanted to go back as we were before… I felt so happy. I was so relieved you wanted me, even if just as a friend,” he said smiling at him.
“Well, Captain,” inquired Jarvis. “There’s always me, but no one apart the Avengers is going to see this footage,” assured him.
When he raised his head towards the clock and saw it was already past 3 in the morning, he decided to take a cup of tea before going to bed and that for once he could sleep in.
He shut down the lab and took the lift to the common floor. Everyone had their own suites, but they took the habit of staying mostly together especially at breakfast and dinner, so pretty much everything to eat or drink was stored there.
Maybe now he didn’t have to worry anymore, he thought, smiling broadly.
“I look forward to it.”
“Why? I mean- Even if Clint was the only one to speak at that time, I realised that you – all of you – thought that we were together, too. So I was wondering what made you think that,” he explained, sincerely curious.
“No, you don’t get it,” replied Natasha. “When Tony arrived, Steve left everything he was doing to give him coffee. Then he came back to eat the rest of his breakfast but when he noticed Tony didn’t have any he made him blueberry pancakes, his favourites, even if not an hour earlier he said specifically that the batter wasn’t to be touched because he wanted to make pancakes for Rhodey’s birthday.”
I don’t know,” Bruce replied.
“How did we miss that?” Tony said astonished, looking at him.
“I don’t give a fuck!” Tony screamed at the top of his lungs in the middle of the waiting room, throwing his arms upwards. “I don’t care about the hospital policy!
“Don’t worry, I know you’re old-fashioned. I’ll do everything properly. Tomorrow I’ll take you to our umpteenth first date,” he half-joked said with a smile.
?” she inquired, stressing on the last word.
“Well, I don’t see why you need to rub it in my face, but essentially yes,” Steve said a bit resentful.
It was a movie night like many others. Steve and Tony were on the loveseat with an empty bowl of popcorn between them, Bruce was in his armchair with his ever-present mug of tea, Natasha was leaning on her chaise, while Clint and Thor were sharing the couch.
Steve closed his hands around the cup, trapping Tony’s hand under his.
“With blueberries?” asked Tony with a voice full of hope.
For a moment no one said anything then, carefully placing a knife beside her, Natasha said, “You know, too. Don’t you?”
“Ahh…” sighed Clint with a dreamy voice. “Grease is a masterpiece.”
“I didn’t realise it,” Steve said.
“Yes, it is,” Steve answered in a playful tone.
“You have to believe me, I didn’t know what was going to happen. Up to that point, I didn’t know the song, I don’t even know where Natasha found it. I mean, I suspected she had noticed something, but I never thought she would have done something about it.”
When Nick Fury firstly formed the Avengers, they all thought they wouldn’t last a week. They were so different and even though they fought well during the battle of New York, it is known that beggars can’t be choosers, especially not in case of necessity.
And since it was almost Christmas, soon the Maria Stark Foundation would have hosted his annual charity gala.
Tony burst out laughing, he stood up and took Steve’s hand in his, dragging him on the open space between the island and the countertop and starting to sway in place at the first notes of I Got You Babe (bless Jarvis for starting the song without needing to be told).
“What-” Steve high-pitched.
“Like I had a choice with you,” Steve said still a little misty-eyed but with a small private smile.
In a couple of minutes, they found themselves crouched again on the carpet or sitting on the sofa, watching the bottle spin among them, and waiting to see who would be chosen for the next round.
“Shit, I knew you were up to something,” mumbled Tony.
, Tony said alone
“You go first,” Tony said quietly.
“I never said they should know it,” Bruce replied cleverly.
“Of course, Captain,” said Jarvis, closing the door of the lift.
Despite not being Midgardian, Thor felt a strong connection with this world and its inhabitants. The first time he set foot on Earth, he didn’t think that he would’ve found such great companions, but after the battle of New York, he was happy to say he did.
, Tony repeated again
“Come here,” Steve said. And just when Clint was going to walk into the kitchen, he saw Steve picking up Tony bridal style and put him down on a stool. “If I leave you now, will you fall off?” he asked with a smile, placing a hand on his shoulder.
He closed his eyes, groaned and rubbed his temples. He was an idiot.
JARVIS's voice chimed in around him. "Captain Rogers, Sir has requested that I ask after your wellbeing."
“I could eat” Steve stood up himself and followed her out of the room. They walked all the way to the common area in companionable silence.
The fight leaves his body and his eyes fall shut. This is it, he's dead. He's dead, he's dead, he should be dead.
Steve didn’t want to wait; he wanted to get out of there, to walk away from all of this mess before he did something he’d regret. He shook off Tony’s hand. “No”
“Yeah, thanks, J,” Tony barged in. “I’m not joking, by the way, I’ve never been so serious in all my life,” he said firmly to Steve. “So… what do you want to do about it?” asked a little shyly. “I am not exactly good at the all relationship thing.”
Evidently, villains really hated extreme temperature swings, because now that it was nearly Christmas none of them seemed interested so much in taking over the world.
“I appreciate the thought, truly, but… Tony and I are not together,” Steve said sincerely.
“Did she?” Steve inquired, turning the page.
“How could I know?” Steve laughed. “Are you okay with this?”
“Hold on there, Stark. I decide the song,” Natasha stopped him.
It was one of those rare quiet afternoons in which by some miracle no villain had the heart to attack the city, maybe because of the sudden burst of heat that hit a couple of days before. Normally, they kept doing what they had to, but in companionable silence or a soft buzzing.
“They’re not together,” Bruce confirmed with a sigh.
“Do you-”
“Boy,” Clint murmured a couple of minutes later. “That escalated quickly.”
“I gave you my idea!” Clint exclaimed.
“No, that’s true. Considering Tony, it’s a little strange,” agreed Bruce. “But how can you be so sure that it was Steve’s one?”
“Did she wake you?” Steve clarified.
help did he had?”
Natasha and Clint came almost at the same moment. She sat on the rug displaying her collection of knives all around her and began to polish them neatly. Instead, Clint slouched on the big couch with his ankles propped on the small table drinking what was probably the most sugary cup of coffee, with little coffee and a lot of whipped cream, that he could find at the café across the street.
“Steve,” Tony murmured, placing his hand on his cheek, and stroking it lightly. “Do you want to – apparently – keep on staying with me?”
“Steve.”
“Me and Nat?” Clint pointed back and forth at themselves, surprised. “We already have a golden couple in the team, no need to fake one,” he said carelessly.
“Well, since I value my family jewels I think I will sing,” he said with a smile, standing up and taking a microphone.
So, after a period of examination, her patience was at the lowest and she decided to act upon it.
“Mm,” she murmured, seemingly according with him. “What about Thor, then?” she asked a few moments later as if she didn’t already think about it. “He doesn’t have missions and he just stays in Asgard to check on Loki – just like Tony goes to work – but otherwise he’s always here. With him, though, you don’t behave differently than with me, Clint, or Bruce. Would you tell me why?” she said gently.
“Holy shit,” Clint said, eyes wide open and both his hands raised to cover his mouth.
“Actually,” corrected him the AI. “Miss Tasha, Master Banner and Master Barton are currently in the home theatre, sitting comfortably on the couch with a bowl of pop-corn each.”
“Alright, you’re right. What about Steve, though?” Clint inquired.
“You. I want to be with you,” answered Tony without missing a beat.
“We could make them sing a serenade!” exclaimed Bruce.
Steve froze, his eyes growing comically, and before he even thought of reciprocating, Tony pulled away.
Bruce knew far too well that tone. When Tony combined nicknames, tea and coffee and a fake, detached smile it could only mean that he wanted to talk about feelings. Heaving a deep sigh, even if the other man hadn’t spoken yet, he surrendered to the difficult talk he was about to go through.
After all, of all the things he could’ve missed, he didn’t mind that it was something this good. He was just happy it happened.
“Yeah, I know. But you had plenty of– affairs,” Steve finished lamely.
“In cheesy romcoms or lousy fanfictions,” deadpans Bruce.
Steve averted his eyes and took a deep breath as if to collect himself, but before speaking he looked at Tony again.
So, Thor sparred with Steve anytime he realised was holding back during a training session because he didn’t want to harm anyone but needed to blow off steam. He always chose old cult movies during movie night because he knew Steve wanted to watch them but didn’t want to impose on the others. With the excuse of discovering the many beauties of America, he dragged him around the country, and often this trip became little vacations for all the team.
At first, he thought he’d stop there, but then words just came, and he just poured them, suddenly feeling the urge to say them just this once to the man he was in love with. “I’ve loved you for months now, I don’t even know when it all began, but I do. You’re kind, you’re compassionate, you’re incredibly smart, you make me feel part of something, something good, something that is worth, and you’re an arse, you’re self-absorbed, legitimately so even if sometimes you behave like a prick, and I love it all. I just love all of you.”
Later on, Clint and Bruce had told him his story and he finally knew why the Captain stood out like a sore thumb.
“And… he’s been there for how long?” inquired, already knowing the answer.
“Of course I knew, Steve. I’m a genius,” he said with a small smile. “But I never would’ve acted on it, ever. I can only imagine how much difficult it is for you. I know you probably despise me now and that’s why I didn’t want to say anything. The last thing I want is to make you uncomfortable because of me. Say we can go back as we were before. Say you can forgive me,” almost plead Tony looking at him dead in the eye.
Nat spun the bottle again.
“Uh,” he said after a while. “Alright,” he stood up, smiling at her. “Thanks for the talk, I missed you.”
Steve looked at him caught by surprise. “I think you know how I feel,” said a little bitterly.
we need to find a solution yesterday,” Natasha interrupted them.
After a couple of seconds, Tony heaved a deep sigh, “Fine, it does,” he conceded, rolling his eyes upwards.
They stood there, watching each other in the eyes as if searching for something. Steve waited a couple of moments more, but when he mustered up his courage Tony preceded him.
Clint was going to open his mouth, but Thor stealthily nudged him in his ribs, so he kept quiet.
“We could set them up during a karaoke night and make them sing a duet. I can’t guarantee that it’ll work, but the right atmosphere might do the trick,” Bruce suggested.
Tony looked at him bewildered for the whole time and he managed to spoke only after a moment of silence. “What- What do you mean even if just as friends?”
“No,” Tony repeated. “There’s no coffee,” he clarified, not even bothering to look at him.
Suddenly, Steve giggled and turning his head towards Tony, he asked disbelieving, “Are you quoting Cher?”
In the afternoon of the fourth day, when the team just finished lunch Steve decided the time had come.
“What you are looking at, is Tony caressing his present for Steve with doe eyes,” replied her. “And now tell me that this behaviour is on character,” added with a daring tone.
He was ready to internally rant about his (apparently) lacking visual skills when he realized he’d never seen Tony so relaxed and at ease and Steve’s smile so tender, and he suddenly calmed down.
“Hmm,” Tony murmured thoughtfully.
What a surprise. As if she didn’t practice all week to train her arm with the right amount of strength required to land the bottle where she wanted.
. She clearly had something in mind. “I propose a Spin the Bottle Karaoke,” she said with a smirk.
“Wow…” Clint murmured when the blinds opened, and the light came back into the kitchen.
Tony and Steve managed to avoid each other for the next three days. Actually, it wasn’t that difficult. Tony locked himself in his workshop, knowing that sooner or later they needed to talk, but trying not to think about it, and Steve kept a strictly normal routine, counting on Jarvis to let Tony know when he was around.
“Ugh, I wanna die,” he murmured dramatically, covering his eyes with his forearm.
“Yeah?” he turned again towards her.
“Ah, my hero!” exclaimed Tony with a stage gasp. “Those are my favourites, how could I refuse?” said with a small smile while Steve’s ears flushed red.
, Tony went on,
“That your goal today was to lose your team,” Steve replied coldly. Fury didn’t react. “Maybe you’re right,” he continued. “At first, Tony didn’t want to be in the Avengers. Hell, probably none of us did. We were strangers, we didn’t trust each other, we were nothing. But that’s your mistake – this is the past. We’re no longer just teammates. We’re not even friends. We are family,” he said in a dead-serious tone.
When the words on the screen took an unusual shade of green, they sang together the chorus.
Probably due to his exhaustion, he didn’t notice immediately, but at a certain point, he saw that Steve and Tony were sitting together.
The Avengers were gathered in the living room of the communal floor when they discovered they
“Ok, this time I don’t even know what I am looking at,” Clint said with a confused look.
Since no one had a real family to come back to, they decided to spend the day together and even if they told “no presents”, the tree began to host more and more packages until it became a giant Secret Santa free-for-all.
Steve took the mug and filled it himself, placing it carefully in Tony’s hands, then turned back towards the pan, checking his bacon.
Clint stood there, unseen by the two men and after a moment of hesitation, he decided to go ahead. He opened the fridge, took the milk and his favourites cereal, a pear and sat at his spot.
Natasha wasn’t exactly surprised, she could sense their sexual tension from miles away. What amazed her was the straightforwardness of the scene before her eyes. It was probably the first time she saw them so natural, so effortlessly domestic with each other.
Steve looked at him confused. “Forgive you? Tony, what are you talking about? I could never despise you, ever,” he said, shaking feebly his head. “I know it’s not your fault. On the contrary, I should be the one to apologize. I know we’re friends now, but it’s not fair to ask you something like that. I didn’t want you to find out like this. I thought Natasha might have realized it too, but I didn’t want to do anything because it’s something that is just not possible,” he said the last bit bowing his head.
Since the battle of New York, it was a tradition for the Avengers to come home, take a hot shower and gather on the communal floor to spend the rest of the day together.
It was clear that there were few left-overs, not enough to feed a grown man who probably came from a three-day session in the lab. But before anyone could say a word, Steve was already up saying: “I was just about to do more pancakes, do you want some?”
Natasha stared at him for a while, then placed the book on the small table, pulled her legs towards her to make him room and patted the spot beside her. A little more decidedly, he sat down. Then, she waited.
It goes without saying that as soon as they arrived at the Avengers Tower they headed towards their suites, and no one cared to stop Tony when he asked Jarvis if he could order pizza for everybody.
“I don’t-”
“You’re my friend, Tony,” Steve said losing himself in his eyes. “I think I proved that in the last few years. And I never had–” he faltered a little but then went on. “I’ve never been with someone, but… Lately, I’ve been thinking and before, when we were coming to bed –
“Uh, Nat! You’re one to talk! You barely sang a song on your own!” Clint complained.
He respected him, he didn’t question his capability as a soldier or a leader, because it was obvious he was of high-value. Technically speaking, on the battlefield the Captain was perfect. But then, when all was said and done, the Captain took off his cowl and what remained was Steve.
By the time Bruce arrived, though, he was propped on the edge of the cushion, with a couple of files in his hands, his elbows on his knees and a pensive frown between his eyebrows.
“I’m a genius, duh,” he retorted on autopilot. When Steve swatted weakly his shoulder, he sniggered and then replied seriously. “I’ve been thinking about it, too.”
“ARE THEY BLIND?!” Clint exploded a few moments later. “They’re practically
Clint had witnessed the whole scene speechless.
Bruce stood there, looking from a distance who now recognized to be Steve and Tony. Something must’ve happened because they were silent. Steve was sitting on a stool with his elbows on the countertop and his head bowed, while Tony was warming up something in a small pot.
“Why- Um. Do you remember when Clint thought Tony and I were a pair?” he asked looking at her a little awkward but otherwise calm.
“I was trying to tell this idiot that engineering clearly isn’t the best form of science.” Bruce challenged with a smirk.
“Damn. You lost a bet on your birthday. That’s harsh Rhodey.” Clint said.
“So, we are trying to decide which movie to watch.” Steve said with a grin. Tony smiled for real this time. Debating was something he could definitely do. They ended up watching the new Star Trek movie. During the movie, he felt his phone buzzing and ignored it. It didn’t stop, so he excused himself to take the phone call.
“I can see the black bags under your eyes even with makeup.” Rhodey chastised.
Steve’s suit was grey, and his jacket was swung over his shoulders revealing dark suspenders. Tony thought his brain was short circuiting, but due to the blush on the blonde’s face, he seemed to be feeling the same way.
“What’s up?” Tony asked.
The inside of the apartment was scattered with technological marvels as well as random tools. It didn’t look like a typical teenager’s space. Dummy rushed out from behind the kitchen island to check on Tony. He pressed his claw to Tony’s chest lightly.
“I told you I was a genius.” Tony said with a wink before closing his notebook and continuing to explain the problem to Steve “It probably won’t work outside of theory though. We have a long road before we reach that kind of tech.” he lied. He couldn’t let on to the fact that he only worked in holograms at home and would probably invent a holographic video system in a couple of days. He couldn’t draw any attention to himself beyond ordinary. If he got found out as Tony Stark, he would have to get sent away again.
“I know who you are.” She said. She didn’t seem angry. She regarded him with sympathetic eyes.
A couple months later, Tony was buttoning up his shirt in the mirror with a smile. Natasha was attempting to tame Bruce’s curls with a brush and a prayer. Bruce was dressed in a stunning black suit with a dark green button up. He was still slouching a little because Bruce didn’t love attention, but it was clear the formal wear was helping his self-esteem at least a little bit.
“So, Tony, how was your ride? I know Steve can be a little wild. Did he treat you right?” Bucky was smirking, and Tony couldn’t help but choke on the fry he was eating. Steve grabbed his shoulder and started lecturing Bucky about being an asshole.
Music was playing in the living room as they walked in. Tony was completely hidden by Rhodey’s body. Steve and Thor were drinking wine and laughing in the corner. Bruce and Clint were sitting on the couch looking at the four occupants who had just entered the room.
“Please stop freaking out. Tony and I will explain when we get somewhere that isn’t public. Asking a ton of questions is only going to upset Tony more” Tony felt a little bit awkward that she was talking about him like he wasn’t there, but he let it go.
Tony laughed again this time not the product of surprise but of joy. Steve joined him in laughing. He tucked his head into Tony’s shoulder.
He squealed when he saw Rhodey standing in his living room. He threw himself into the taller man’s arms.
He left his car and walked awkwardly to the senior hall. Bruce wasn’t there, so he wasn’t sure what to do. He pulled out him notebook and started jotting down some thoughts about his new invention. He was startled out of his inventing daze by a cough. In front of him stood a stunning red head and her equally stunning blond companion. He blinked a couple of times to make sure he wasn’t hallucinating.
Tony remembered how Steve promposed with startling accuracy. Bucky had herded Tony into the art room where Steve was waiting in a paint covered apron that made Tony’s heart do all sorts of crazy things. Steve pulled with tarp off of his easel with a bright red face. It was a painting of Tony the day they first kissed. His eyes were closed, and his dark hair looked almost ethereal in the sunlight that Steve had created. Tony couldn’t process that this was how Steve saw him. It took him a moment before he realized that the word prom was painted on the bottom with a question mark. Steve looked anxious because of course the idiot would still be nervous that his boyfriend would turn him down
The bike itself was gorgeous. Tony could tell that Steve took great care of it. The sides were painted meticulously. Tony wondered if Steve painted it himself. He was talented enough to do it. Tony’s hands twitched. He’d really like to get his hands on that beauty. He could make it run so much better. Steve would probably like that. Maybe he’d offer to fix it up for Steve’s birthday. But as much as Tony appreciated the mechanics of Steve’s bike, he had never ridden a motorcycle before and was pretty convinced that it was a walking death trap.
“Definitely more. He loves any opportunity to be a snot.” Tony said with an eyeroll.
“It is truly delightful to see you being yourself again, Tony” Thor said with a big smile.
Tony rolled his eyes, “Oh you mean my many sexploits” Steve made a choked noise, “all of those were lies. I’ve only ever dated two people. They weren’t… great people so my parents worked pretty hard to make sure those scandals never got out. As for the kidnapping, it was reported that I was in Japan. I’m not sure what their plan was if they never found me. They didn’t want to public to freak out and the stock to drop.”
Steve looked back up. Tony was sitting there at his desk, his expression almost blank if not for the ways his eyes danced around, “I want to apologize.”
panic.
It took Tony three weeks after the California incident to find information on the droid activity and when he did, he’d sent out a request for an immediate Avengers meeting. Which, yes, Steve was glad that Tony was including the team and informing them about important details pertaining to the threat, but, at the same time, he wished Tony had remembered that most people were in bed at four in the morning and didn’t appreciate being woken up with alarms for meetings that could have possibly waited till the sun was actually out.
Five, Ten, Forty minutes passed by with nothing. No sign or word. Steve duck in and out of the water, feeling more and more dismayed as the time ticked on. Steve tried to stop thinking, tried not to believe that it was already too late. With those thoughts came a rising hysteria that would do absolutely nothing to help the situation.
“Steve, I’m sca—“
Coulson looked exasperated “now he listens.”
Tony squatted in front of Steve, between his spread legs, using Steve’s thigh to steady himself. Steve inhaled deeply through his nose as Tony reached a tentative hand up, checking his eyes first. “I think you might have a slight concussion.” He tapped a finger along Steve’s temple, causing Steve’s next breath to come out as a hiss when it hit the tender area. “you got hit pretty hard judging by this gash here—you know, this is exactly why I tell you to leave the helmet on.”
It took one look from Tony, one glance in his direction and Tony knew. He’d start talking, babbling really, about what he was working on. Sometimes he’d stop working all together and try to distract Steve some other way. They’d work on one of his many cars, go out to eat, or watching bad TV until one or both of them fell asleep. Tony just, he got it. He knew how it felt to feel the air sucked out of a room, to doubt that you’d ever be okay again when in that moment everything felt like it was pressing in way too tight.
There was a chance he could actually ruin everything if he did that.
Tony staggered back, a flash of disbelief before storm clouds seemed to take over. He gripped his jaw, eyes narrowed at Steve “What—“
and Clint placed his hand on Steve’s shoulder as he cried, the weight of it heavy and not at all soothing, but Steve let him, leaned into the contact. His voice tore out of him, wet and ragged and
Tony snorts and turns quickly so that his back is against the rail "Nah, I always keep weird hours. Comes with the whole genius thing."
He grips his shield in his hands and kicks but gets nowhere. The serum was supposed to make him better, he should be able to get out of this. He cant, he cant, he cant breath. He feels like he did when he was younger and smaller. There is no air and every time he tries to pull some in it hurts. Its like an asthma attack times ten.
One thing should be noted first and foremost and that thing is that, at first, Steve never wanted to be in love with Tony. Even after they had become friends, even after they had become good friends, it wasn't something Steve had spent any time secretly pining for. It was as far away from what he'd had planned for his life as he could have ever imagined.
Steve tried to roll his eyes but ended up yawning half way through. “Thanks”
He clasped Tony’s hands warmly in his own, “Mr. Stark! What a pleasure to have you here with us,” his eyes filled with confusion when they landed on Steve, “and, Mr. Rogers? Well this is an unexpected pleasure.” He held out his hand to shake Steve’s, grip firm, mouth tipped up, but gaze practically brimming with the unasked question.
