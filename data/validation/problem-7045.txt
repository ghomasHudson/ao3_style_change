Tony woke up to people talking. He wasn’t sure why people were talking when the last thing he remembered was Steve’s knot tying to him for the third time in so many hours. He wiggled slightly letting out a little whimper when he found he was still hanging off a knot. He tensed, unsure of what was going on.
“Peter, baby. No matter what world we’re in, you are always mine. The other world I just couldn’t express it as easy as I can here. The fact that I’m able to express it openly here tells me that this world is way better than the last one. I know that to you right now it seems a bit strange, being treated like a young child when you feel like the old Peter but let me tell you, kid. This world took away the stress that always seemed around you. You’re happier. You love me and your Daddy along with Bucky. Bucky loves you too and really looks up to you.” Tony had stopped walking and sat on one of the benches he had outside the kid's nurseries, If they had to sit outside to see if they would go to sleep, they might as well be comfortable doing it, and situated Peter so that he was facing him
Tony chuckled at how excited Peter was over a small blue tick. He couldn’t keep up with the trends kids were into.
Steve grinned down at Tony who was still growling lowly. He took hold of his cock, effectively stopping Tony’s anger by distracting him.
Steve had only come right before they came down here so he knew he’d be fucking Tony for a while. The aim was two orgasms before he tied with him. Holding onto Tony’s hips he slammed into him again and again, enjoying the feeling of his tight heat surrounding him. He was so focused on riding Tony that he didn’t hear the lift doors opening until Bruce was nearly in front of them.
“Meany, Mama.” He lisped out from behind the pacifier he was nursing, glad one of the adults were on his side.
“Yes, it is. We call him Bucky because of his middle name, Buchanan.” Hmm, Peter kind of liked the names James.
“Maybe but Peter isn’t lacking anything in life. He’s well balanced, happy, well adjusted. Peter is aware we baby him and doesn’t mind it because that’s the kind of boy he is. He actually enjoys it because he loves the attention and loves seeing us happy. He’s not being held back and that’s all that matters. He had a great day today and that’s all that matters.” Steve said, running a hand through Peter’s hair.
Papa look! Look at how much I have! I’m going to be eating this for months! I won’t ever need to eat sweets ever- ever” A yawn cut through the middle of his sentence. “ again!” he finally finished.
“Can we? I know it’s silly and I trust Bucky but…” He trailed off, not knowing how to explain. Luckily Steve didn’t need him to.
Steve eyebrows creased at his son’s insecure words. “Peter, there’s no point in going by what society says you have to. If that were the case Dad would not be the eccentric billionaire that he is. All that matters is that you’re happy and you have a life that suits you. A lot of adults take naps as well. They just don’t have it at a set time. Uncle Bruce is always napping.”
Tony just looked at him with wide eyes before another wave of heat rolled over him and he whined. He looked over at the wall and couldn’t see his dildo anywhere. Where was it? What was he going to do?
“Bye guys! Can’t wait to show you how many sweets I get.” Peter called over his shoulder. Tony who was following behind them stopped and looked at the rest of the team. “You should all be ashamed of yourselves. Peter is having a sleepover with each of you until that bucket is empty, just FYI.”
Bucky began his little whine-cry again, upset that he had to be stripped, wiggling and trying to get away. Tony was adept at wiggly littles though and got his clothes off him in record time. The room was warm but Bucky was still shivering once he was down to his diaper. Tony made use of his blanket to wrap it around him for some heat.
“His plane has just landed, we have a bit of time before we have to meet him, we have to hurry though!” Peter wiped the sleep from his eyes and hopped out of the car, taking his Dad’s hand so they could rush to the gate to get Harley. He just hoped none of the press was there.
“Sensitive.” He whined, squirming on Steve’s lap. Steve cooed in sympathy but didn’t stop his ministrations.
Tony winced and Steve glared over Peter’s head at Natasha who didn’t seem to care one bit. Out of everyone, Natasha was the one that broke the no sweets rule with Peter the most. Four was excessive though. Peter would be bouncing off the walls, even more than he usually did.
“I heard what you said to Papa about me loving you but not liking you.” Tony stepped further into the room, sitting on the side of Peter’s bed so that he was facing him. From this close, he could see Peter was trembling slightly.
Peter knew Steve, he’d never been anything but polite to him before unless there was something Peter wasn’t telling Tony.
“Shh, it’s okay sweetheart. I’ll take care of you.” He positioned Tony so that he was draped over the unoccupied armchair, pushing his legs out wide enough so that his hole winked at him, slick making it glisten. Steve took a moment to look at it before sinking the whole way in a single plunge. Tony moaned out the second he felt Steve enter him, clutching the armrest, his cock brushing against the fabric of the sofa with every inward thrust making him crave the slight brush.
“It’ll only take a minute at most.” Dr Cho went over when Tony finished up and took a look. “One of the easiest ways to gauge if a boy is a little is by looking to see if they have and pubic hair and the size of their penis. Typically they don’t develop past pre-puberty stage but there have been exceptions.”
Steve had to bite back a smile when Ton made a show of looking himself up and down as if trying to figure out what wasn’t looking right on him before snapping his fingering in realisation.
It took five long days for Peter and Bucky to get over their illness. Steve and Tony were exhausted by the end of it. It felt like clockwork; Peter would throw up, cry, have a bath and fall asleep. Just as he fell, asleep Bucky would start. And on and on it went until they got over the worst of it. All that was left now was some fatigue and clinginess. They learnt the hard way that if Steve left the room, Bucky would scream bloody murder until he came back in.
Peter cuddled into his Papa, content to ignore his phone for the next hour and watch whatever movie was put on.
Steve waited until he knew Peter was far enough away that he couldn’t hear and turned to Tony, pulling up his shirttails and taking hold of his hard cock giving it a few pumps until it was leaking pearly liquid.
Peter shrugged, “You’re rich,” was the only response he had to that. Luckily it made Mama laugh instead of angry like he thought it would.
“C-Cause Jamie was sleepy and you wouldn’t listen to me when I called you. Why?” Peter sounded heartbroken that his Mama would forget him.
“Yep, he sure is. He was just ringing to make sure I’d be there for when his plane got in. I’m going to have to collect Pete a bit early so we can get to the airport.”
The men looked at each other, Tony smiling slightly, giving himself permission to enjoy this world a bit more. As Natasha summed it up perfectly, there wasn’t much more to say. Hence, they continued to sit in silence until Friday piped up, “Sir, Master Jamie is awake.”
“Mama, are the cameras going to be here?” He hated them which was why he was kept out of the limelight for so long.
“So who’s the boy that was annoying you at the front door?” Steve asked, manoeuvring the car out the busy car park. Peter wanted to groan. Of course, Papa would see that.
Tony handed him a well-loved blanket when he was done, explaining. “This is Petey’s post scenting blanket. He takes a nap with it after.”
Steve rolled his eyes but did as was asked, switching between himself and Tony with the pasta. Watching at Tony rode his first orgasm out.
“Fine, what are the other rules?” Peter wanted to get it over with quickly, rip it off like a plaster.
“It’s called crashing honey. It means that Bucky has been hiding so much and now that it’s out he can’t handle being big any more so he’s in his little headspace. He’ll probably be there for a while. It’ll make the exam easier at least.” Mama explained. Peter nodded his head as if the explanation helped. He didn’t understand half of what he said but that was okay. He was sure it would all be explained when they went in.
“Perfect. I’m going to step out and just get the shortened test while you get Bucky sorted. I need him stripped down to his diaper.”
Peter fist-pumped the air when he saw what his Dad was handing back to him. Yes! He loved apples and peanut butter! Harley needed to come over more often, he was getting all of his favourite things today!
“You’ll get to your meetings and your lab. First I’m going to fuck you into this mattress and then we’ll go over your training. You’ll be happy to know that the first week it all based around fucking.” Steve’s knot had gone down enough that he could fuck into Tony properly. He still had a hand around Tony’s cock, stroking up with every time he fucked into him.
got it! After that, it was quite easy to get off. The overalls just slipped down his body and fell to the ground. It was just a case of stepping out of them.
Then there was another point he had to give when he saw the Stark logo on it. He wasn’t 100 per cent sure but he would bet that Mama made it himself.
Peter cut his eyes to his father before looking back to Papa. “Mama is letting me make a twitter account! But I have to let him mute words and accounts he doesn’t want me to see and he’s making you and him an account. Oh! And both of you are monitoring the account and it has to go in my account bio.”
Now he was moving to Massachusetts which was so much closer! He was sure his Dad would let him visit way more now! Maybe he could even stay in their house for the summer and winter break.
Steve walked in before Peter had a chance to reply. Tony took Peter’s shaking to mean that he had been mean to him and glared at Steve.
Steve quickly made up a bottle of formula for Bucky, handing it to Tony and took over feeding Peter some applesauce.
“Yes, we did. You can stand down Bucky. I might not have been prepared for it to be this month for us to be mated but it was an inevitability and if I really didn’t want you up here Jarvis wouldn’t have let you anywhere near me like my last three heats when he confined you to your quarters for the week.” Was it so hard for people to believe that he had
Peter nodded, sending his curls flying. He knew exactly what Steve wanted to do. Tony did it to him once a month to keep his scent strong on his pup. It was common in their society to mask a pups scent with their own until they reached the age of majority. It served a dual purpose of warding off unwanted Alpha’s, as well as giving the Omega pup comfort throughout the day or whenever they were separated for a long period of time.
Tony had been notified by Friday that Peter was up and was talking to himself, saying that he would show them he was a big boy. Tony went and peaked in on him, grinning when he saw his little boy, bare-bottomed, trying to pull his sweatpants up his legs. He had left and told Friday to let them know if he needed help or was upset. Looks like he got the whole way to the living room before his big boy bravery failed him.
“No, it’s okay Petey. I consented. The only thing is that he’s traditional.” Tony got it out quickly, knowing Peter wasn’t going to be too impressed.
“I’m sure you can ask him, baby. He might not want you to though.” Personally, Steve thought it was extremely cute that Peter wanted his own nickname for Bucky.
Bucky finally let go of his cock, which was leaking by this point and red. Bucky said he was only allowed to come at the end if he was good and his stupid Omega traits took that seriously. As much as he wanted to come he didn’t want to disappoint Bucky. The thoughts of the physical were freaking him out as well, he was extremely relieved that Bucky was staying close to him. When Bucky moved to stand up, he involuntarily moved Clint with him so that Clint was standing in front of Bruce.
This wasn’t fair! Peter let out an involuntary wail the more he thought about it. What was he supposed to do now?!
“Well done baby, now let’s go get ready for trick or treating. Steve, c’mon.” Peter jumped up and ran into his parent's room, he couldn’t wait until everyone saw their costumes. He thought they were hilarious, Papa thought it was cute and Mama thought it was ridiculous. He was still dressing up though. That was why he gave him the title Mama. Only Mama’s would find it ridiculous and still do it anyway.
Steve parked up, sighing in relief when he saw a free space in the children and parents zone, he needed the extra space to get the kids out without waking them.
He cracked an eye open to see if he could suss out where exactly he was. His confusion only grew though when he took a sneak peek.
Today was the first day that both boys went down for their naps in their own cribs and without much fuss. Both men were in the living room, just enjoying the peace of having no children hanging off them for the first time in nearly a week.
Bucky’s hand snuck down and gave his cock a quick pass over, his hand coming away sticky. “He’s leaking a bit more from just that. That’s good to know.” Clint shivered at his tone and tried to ignore his comment.  Bruce continued his exam, running his hands over his abdomen, checking for injury as he went down, getting the whole way to his cock without issue.
“And look at you! You got yourself dressed today. That’s something a big boy does!” Tony continued to praise.
Peter woke up with a start. The last thing he remembered was telling Mr Stark that he didn’t feel good and then nothing. They must have defeated Thanos if he was back though. He sat up rubbing his eyes and looking around, still expecting to be on Titan, confused when the first thing he noticed was the bars around him. Did someone kidnap him? Oh god, they did. That would just be his luck, come back to life just to be kidnapped. He looked up expecting them to reach up to the top and was surprised to find that they didn’t. They were quite tall but something he could easily jump out if he wanted. It was strange, he thought, as he looked around the thing he was in. He had a blanket with Ironman on It covering his legs along with a soft mattress underneath him. The Ironman blanket made him blush even though there was no one around to see him. If he didn’t know any better he would have said that he was in a crib. He was always small for his age so it wasn’t like he wouldn’t fit into one but why would he be in one now? There was a little light in the room coming from an arc reactor night light beside him. He grabbed the side of the railing, hoisting himself up, it was time to blow this popcorn stand.
“Are you a traditional Alpha as well as Bucky?” Tony asked, finally able to tear his eyes away from the still moaning Clint.
“Probably, he’s more than likely going to throw a major tantrum. Nothing we can do about it though, other than braving the storm. I’m hoping Peter will help him adjust.”
Tony and Steve looked at each other, Tony shrugging at Steve’s inquisitive stare. It wasn’t a big deal if they knew his age. “It’s alright sweetheart, just don’t tell them your name or show them a picture of you, okay?”
He stripped as he waited for his Papa to empty the bag. Ignoring the laugh he got from both of his parents.
“Bucky, Clint? You here?” Steve called, Tony trailing behind him, trying to hide as much as possible. Of course, the tower was secure as it was going to get with Tony and FRIDAY, but that didn’t mean he wanted everyone to see him naked all the time. He couldn’t see a way out of it though, he knew that Steve was a traditional Alpha before they mated and knew what he was getting into, he just didn’t really think about having to live it other than in an abstract way.
“So I think we all know you’re a submissive Omega like Tony. That means you’ll benefit from the same type of traditional relationship like Tony and Steve a pursuing. It doesn’t mean that you’re limited to it but you’ll thrive in a relationship like that, just as Tony is. You have a clean bill of health and everything is looking fine. We will have to discuss how you were passing for a lesser Alpha but right now I need you to sign these papers to say that the test was completed to your satisfaction. There will probably be an investigation into the centre that put you as a lesser Alpha instead of Submissive Omega. Something like that is incredibly dangerous. You’re lucky Steve noticed it before you got sick.” Bruce chastised gently, making Clint feel guilty as hell over it. He signed the papers in front of him extremely slow to avoid looking at Bruce in the eye. He hated disappointing the scientist. He was the sweetest guy (after Tony) that he knew.
Peter was wiggling excitedly in the chair when he saw his Dad adding the last touches to his account before handing his phone back. He grinned when he saw the profile photo was of him and Papa a few minutes before. He didn’t like that he looked so small compared to him though, which he pointed out to his parents, who laughed.
Steve laughed, “I know, right. It was weird showering and seeing Bucky just outside the door, looking up at me. I don’t think I’m properly clean, yet I showered that quickly.”
“Papa!” He groaned and flopped down onto the bed so he could put his Ugg boots on. Now all he needed was the ears and a black nose and he’d be done!
“Eh Cap, there’s a bit of a heat situation with Tony starting in there.” Steve's eyebrow rose at that.
Peter was not impressed. Why would they only pack jammies instead of another change of clothes? Why would they even pack clothes in the first place? It wasn’t like Peter had forgotten how to feed himself. Or did he? He wasn’t sure of anything anymore. This new world was messing with his head. All he wanted was to go to sleep and wake up back in Queens with Aunt May.
“Good boy.” He heard his Mama murmur before a pacifier was placed in his mouth. It was the final push that Peter needed and he heard no more as he succumbed to his post food lethargy. He’d find out what was going on after a well-deserved nap he was sure.
Peter was not happy when he woke up for two reasons. One was that he was in a crib, and two was that he didn’t even feel himself being moved. He took a few minutes to look around the room once more before he made his move. Last time he ended up falling and hurting himself which brought his Mama. He didn’t need that this time. He was determined to show them he was big. First was figuring out how to pull his crib bars down. It shouldn’t be too hard. He saw his Mama doing it earlier. He was still a genius, regardless of him now being this so-called little. He sat up and studied the mechanism for a few minutes before he tried it. It took him three different tries but he managed to get it unhooked in the end. Yes! Now he just had to shuffle off of the bed, which brought him to his next predicament, he had a wet diaper. Ew.
“PETER!” Peter quietened down straight away, looking at Steve with wide eyes, “Thank you. Dad said he’s trying his best to make it home on time.” He eyed his son suspiciously. “You seem very hyper, are you sure you haven’t had sugary foods today?”
Well if he didn’t have a bad dream what was it? A quick check of his diaper didn’t help much as it was still dry.
“Mama, Thanos? What happened with Thanos?” He asked, not realising what he called Mr Stark. The whole room went deathly quiet at Thanos’s name. His new Mama looking at him before sharing a look with his new Daddy.
“I know you don’t want him to have a Twitter, either do I, but we need to let him have some freedom; otherwise, he’ll grow to resent us and that’s the last thing I want. Especially since he’s signed up for college classes next term.”
The stinging smacks to his now upturned bottom brought him right back to down from the floating feeling, enough so that he was able to beg Bucky to stop.
“I know I am baby. So are you now. Your last name is Parker-Stark, and as much as I don’t care about breaking the rules, this is for your safety. Little’s are a bit more fragile than the other classifications, you need a bit of added protection so car seat it is.”
Steve tried to hold back a laugh as Tony spluttered. “A shirt! That’s all you’re giving me is a shirt?!”
“I know,” He said sighing, “I just really wish he asked for a car or a trip to Disneyland instead. Something easier than this.”
Tony rolled his eyes again, “Well a bit too late for that now isn’t it? I’m your Omega now and from the mark, on my neck, my consent is pretty much implied. You’re a traditional Alpha as well, which you love reminding me of so that comes as part of the whole consent thing. You wouldn’t have gotten near me if I didn’t consent to this whole thing. There’s nothing to forgive because I want this as much as you but you’re still forgiven.” Tony looked at Bucky slyly. “I might say no one day though when Bucky is there, just so I know you’ll keep to your word. He’d defend my honour.”
He looked over to his eldest that was cuddling his ironman plushie and also sucking on a pacifier. He continued to sway with Bucky as he addressed Peter.
To Peter, Harley was the coolest person on earth. It helped that Harley found Peter endearing and didn’t mind Peter following him around and asking question after question.
Peter supposed he was quite lucky. His Dad still had a freaking car seat in his. He said it wasn’t but Peter wasn’t stupid. It had a five-point harness that no matter what he tried he couldn’t figure out. He was just lucky that the Land Rover had high seats so the booster would do the job easily. Not wanting to complain anymore in case he got in trouble Peter quickly buckled himself in. If he didn’t Papa would just sit and wait until he did. Or worse, go around to his side and buckle him in.
Tony grinned up at Steve and how outraged he was, as he thought he would be. “Don’t worry capsicle, I’m in the middle of making you an account now. Then we can make Peter one, I’ve already gone through the rules with him so it’s going to be as safe as possible.”
By the end of his scenting, Peter’s eyes were barely open. That was a side-effect of scenting a pup. Scenting is usually done on babies and then only Omega’s until they got to twenty-five. It was used on babies to soothe them and get them back to sleep. It had the same effect on Omega’s of all ages. Peter was curled up into Steve’s chest dozing as he finished.
“You going to be my shadow baby.” Peter just nodded, watching as Mama washed the bottle and put it on the rack. While he waited he felt a weird sensation. He wasn’t sure what it was but it felt warm. Looking around he tried to see what it was, finally looking down with a growing sense of horror. He was peeing, and he didn’t even realise. Mama could see it all while his grey sweatpants turned dark as he watched. Peter’s cheeks went bright red and his lower lip wobbled, letting out a sob again.
Tony sent off his own quick text to Steve before ushering Peter to the car, opening the back door for him.
Steve took one look at the sorry pair at the table and sighed. “Anyone care to explain to me why I have a crying child in the shower?” Was all he said.
“The best day. Love you, Mama. Love you, Papa.” Peter mumbled, smiling sleepily before falling back asleep.
Nodding with confidence, Peter picked up his Ironman plushie and walked out of the half-open door. Strange. He was sure that was closed tight when he woke up. Peter shrugged, meh, maybe he didn’t see that it was open. He walked down the carpeted hall, listening for voices but couldn’t hear any. Was he here by himself? When he walked into the living room his tummy did a little flip. There was no one here. Did they leave him by himself? He didn’t like being by himself. Sure he was big but that didn’t mean he didn’t need his Mama or Dada. Where was Jamie? Peter walked around in a circle, doing a 360 of the room, finding no one. Unwilling tears sprung to his eyes, he didn’t want to be alone. Maybe they were angry that Peter dressed himself? Is that why they left him by himself? Was it punishment? He thought that they would just give him a time out not leave him alone.
“I’m your only house dad,” Steve tosses back, and Tony turns to look at him. Steve sighs and gestures to the front door. “Wanna go outside and talk?”
When Steve sits back down and hands Tony a frosty glass, he’s rewarded with a hand on his thigh. Tony ultimately takes it back to eat, complaining about how Rhodey always overcooks his steak and should leave it to the professionals, but then Tony’s hand is back and just a smidge higher, and Steve’s feeling ready to crawl out of his skin for another reason entirely.
Well, Steve reconsiders, that might be a bit melodramatic. Tony looks like he’s been stood up, which is ridiculous because Steve doubts that Tony’s ever had that particular experience. And he’s not even going to address the utter insanity that would have to occur in order for Tony to ask anything of Steve that would even remotely resemble a date.
“If I’d wanted to do something nice for you, I would have,” Carol cuts him off, and Steve could spot the indignant expression on Tony’s face from a mile away. He just drains the rest of his drink, icy and spicy-sweet with enough bite to make him feel something, even if there’s no way he’s getting drunk, not even with how much alcohol Carol’s added, and gets up from his seat.
“You barely needed me,” Wanda dismisses. “And I missed Morgan’s weekend with Stark. You owe me for that.”
Steve clears his throat. “Yeah, that’s not going to work for me.” He hopes he sounds sure of himself. “I’m sure it’s secure, but I work best with my subject in front of me. So If you can’t make that happen, then I’m not sure you chose the right guy after all.”
He can’t believe he gets to touch Tony like this. If he’d been asked even a day ago, he would have declared it an outrageous improbability even if he had known about the existence of a world like this.
“Yeah,” Steve says blankly, dipping his head in acknowledgment as Rhodes wraps a strong arm around Tony’s shoulder and begins to guide him across the lobby. Steve watches Tony leave, feels the ghost of his tingling mouth above his jaw, and knows that whatever kind of article he manages to cobble together from this night is going to be just as much of a mess as the last piece he wrote about Tony.
(From what Steve had managed to glean, it had to do with access to equipment and Tony insisting that he didn’t even know if he wanted a full workshop at the compound if he was just going to be retiring anyway.
By the time his head screws back around, it’s apparent who the phantom voice belongs to. And, going off the head-to-toe scan he’s doing of Steve's tuxedoed body, it’s also apparent who the phantom voice had been referring to. Steve can immediately feel the flush start high on his cheeks, spreading rapid-fire to the tops of his ears before venturing down the back of his neck. If he’s not careful, he scolds himself, he’ll end up nervously sweating through the rental.
“Sure thing,” Steve agrees, and then Tony’s clicking off the call, a dissonant buzzing noise taking his place, and it takes a beat longer than it should for Steve to set the handset in its place. For several long moments he just sits there, rubbing a hand over his mouth and staring out into space, acid prickling on the back of his tongue and a gradual sense of finality and foreboding settling in.
“I just don’t know if his body can handle it,” Tony says, recalling the weekend where Scott Lang had visited for a trial run. “You wouldn’t even let me test it out first.”
“Don’t do that,” Steve says, now shaking his own head. “That’s not the problem. You touched me yesterday and I was fine. And then I touched you, and it wasn’t. Just…” He doesn’t know how to tell Tony that he doesn’t need to deflect like that, not with him, except for all Tony’s bared to him all the years, Steve’s rarely - if ever - shown him an iota of vulnerability in return. The thought doesn’t sit right, and Steve swallows again before inhaling long and raggedly. “Quid pro quo.”
And Tony knows exactly what he’s going to say next because it’s been an automatic mantra on the tip of his tongue all week -
Tony yanks Steve inside behind him, and it’s a credit to Steve’s compliance that he’s able to do so at all.
He likes the garden better than the inside. It’s less oppressive, less haunted, and he wonders if this is where most of the joy had been experienced. The neighbor boy clearly isn’t a master gardener, but nothing signals neglect aside from the few weeds sprouting up, and Tony circles back to the driveway to sniff at the oversized honeysuckle bushes lining the gravel. There’s a funny looking lawn gnome tucked back under the kitchen window, dressed up as Uncle Sam, and Tony grins at it before snapping a picture, making a mental note to send it to Wilson at a later time. There’s a bird feeder off the back porch and a lightly rusted fountain in the middle of the small yard holding rainwater in its three tiers.
Tony jerks like he’s going to pull back, but Steve catches him and keeps him right where he is, and Tony remains where he is, pressed to Steve’s front.
“You’re not going to break me,” Steve says with a comforting gaze, like he thinks he can read Tony’s mind.
“I thought I was over this,” Tony mumbles after several tortuous minutes, coming over to rest an extended hand on the back of Steve’s chair. It’s a rare instance of Tony being able to physically loom over him, and Steve just waits for him to get it all out. “I was over this. You thought I’d be mad at you, huh?”
Tony looks at him, likely mentally rattling off that very short list, and taps his fingers against his glass.
Steve feels himself flush and shakes his head quickly, motioning for them to continue. “Only want to know who to hand you off to.”
It happens before he can process it, Steve picking him up and following through on that threat of his.
For seconds, hours, minutes - he just lies there. His head feels empty for the first time since he’d laid eyes on Tony earlier in the night, and the whooshing in his ears lulls him into fuzzy unfeeling until he’s forced to pull his face from the mattress so he can breathe.
“Maybe what?” Tony asks, seemingly perturbed by the lack of opportunity to be reasonably belligerent.
“You,” he says, flailing an accusing tool in Steve’s general direction, “can call her FRIDAY, by the way. She might actually listen to you if you do.”
He gets the impression that it's a question Tony hadn't anticipated, but he answers smoothly enough.
The arch to her brows feels like a challenge, and Steve sets out to make the best pitcher of margaritas anyone has ever seen.
Refusing to let go, Steve keeps at least one of Tony’s hands in his at all times. It’s a tether and he’s not ashamed to need it, and Tony seems to understand without Steve needing to explain it. They sit on the wooden steps, side by side, Tony curled into Steve’s side and breathing steady and heavy as they both stare out before them.
She straightens out her tight skirt and glares. “You’re going to have to open it eventually. Might as well do it while I’m here, otherwise I’m going to keep asking.”
) and being politely rejected, he knows that in the grand scheme of things, familiarity means nothing whether he lets it settle or not. Just because they’re in the same room again doesn’t mean he’s going to throw caution to the wind this time. It’s not like their relationship means something more to Tony beyond the occasional bout of congenial unprofessionalism.
Miraculously, Tony is exactly where Steve left him: on the edge of a settee, head tipped back, his left thumb and forefinger spread wide to massage his temples. He doesn’t look up as Steve clears his throat to announce his presence. Tony just extends his right hand, and Steve juggles his bounty to twist the cap off the water before handing it off.
There’s some rearranging and Tony has to take his fingers out and lube back up and Steve insists on kissing him the entire time. Even when Tony tries to ask if he wants another finger before they try fitting him inside, Steve chases his mouth and is so devastatingly persistent in his want that it would kill Tony to deny him.
“I’m good,” he says, internally wincing as he remembers the last and only time they’d been face-to-face: in the middle of Tony Stark’s foyer after a questionable night of drunken antics that Steve knows he’ll never fully remember. “How are you? In town for the grand opening?”
Carol just shrugs and slices limes in half. “He’ll have to build up his tolerance at some point. I mean, look at the company.”
Deliriously reckless with exhaustion, Steve wraps a hand around himself and exhales too loud in the sucking void of the blandly sophisticated hotel room. There’s an emptiness that won’t fill even as he strokes his cock to fullness, thinking about Tony’s sweat-drenched floppy hairline till he’s about to implode with the uncertainty and hurt carving deep inside of him. He wants to have done this differently, wants to surgically extract Tony from under his skin before stitching himself back together. He wants to smother himself in scotch and chalky spearmint, distinctive cologne and the barest whiff of motor oil, only he’s got no idea where the last one came from and the laser-tipped agony is going to drive him over the cliff if he has to live the rest of his life like this.
“Yeah, you go,” Tony says, voice dripping with disdain. “It’s the only thing you’ve ever been any good at, after all. Hey, let me ask before you go.”
The Target is definitely not within walking distance, and Tony makes no secret of his immense displeasure as he tries and fails to keep pace with Steve's strides. Goddamn those mile-long legs of his.
“Come back,” he says, scrambling for words as the seconds seep from between their fingers. “Or - I’ll come back.”
Josie indulges the handshake but looks at Steve like she can’t believe the guy, and he privately agrees with her.
“Oh, I know,” Tony calls back, not bothering to avert his eyes from where Steve is fully stripping out of the top half of his suit and his undershirt, poking at his wounds to make sure the bleeding has stopped before pulling on a gray t-shirt. “You know, most people would clean the blood off first. You know, just because it’s the sanitary thing to do.”
“I could really use some orange juice with my breakfast,” Tony remarks loudly, and Bucky wastes absolutely no time in flipping him off with his fleshless hand.
Later that day, as the last of the sun clings to the silhouettes of the palm trees, Tony wordlessly offers Steve a beer and presses against the balcony with him. Tony’s house is warmer than Pepper’s, modern but different with all the wood and dark coloring, and Steve likes it just as much as he does the tang of salt in his nose. Morgan is on the other end of the deck, splashing around in the pool even as the evening chill arrives.
“I’m sorry if you wanted to stand in lines with sticky children and sweaty adults for the better part of a day,” Tony says, “but I’m not putting us through that. Not during spring break, when every family in the country is going to be there.”
There’s a pregnant pause in which Steve thinks Tony is figuring out how to let him down easy, which verges on hysterical because Tony has never been the type to let anyone down easy.
“What, you never gotten less than a five-star review before?” Tony asks, and from his vantage point Steve can see the scathing angle of his brow. “One dissatisfied partner, and your answer is to make sure they know you never want to see them again?”
“I did tell you I was going to show you a good time, didn’t I?” Tony says expectantly, tapping at an ashtray that has seemingly materialized out of nowhere.
“Is it bad?” Steve asks, scrubbing a hand over his jaw. He’d managed a painstakingly close shave that morning, but there’s somehow a phantom rasp of stubble against his chin. “It’s cheesy, isn’t it?”
cannot, but he looks away from Tony and over at the empty vase in the corner while contemplating what else he can divulge.
that if anyone can figure out whether or not he’s here because he couldn’t survive the loss of a man he hadn’t known he loved, it will be his counterpart. He hasn’t ever wanted anything so much, he’s certain.
It takes more effort than it should to jam the rising groan down his throat. Steve tries not to make a habit out of being rude to people who’re looking to hire him, but he’s running on about one complete REM cycle, his usual morning circuit has been interrupted by new construction, and his fingertips are veering towards frostbitten. To stop himself from tearing into the poor woman tasked with contacting him - he scoffs in the back of his throat at the phrasing, wondering what the hell he’s still doing in Tony Stark’s mental Rolodex after all these years - at an hour when birds have barely begun chirping and the sun is still merely peeking up over the horizon, he clamps his mouth shut and runs a hand through his hair.
He stops first, to pause the recording and slip his phone into his pocket. It’ll be awkward, he reasons, trying to operate his phone in a group of people, and he’s got a more-than-sufficient memory anyway.
“Then why’d you ask me to give it back?” Tony asks, and he goes to wave the frame around but changes his mind at the last second, wrist jerking until he’s back to cautiously framing it with his fingertips.
“I’m picking up the tab, if that’s the problem,” Tony says, gesturing to the abundance of food between them.
“Like a secret,” he says distractedly, unwrapping a few alcohol wipes. He’s reminded of the times he had to patch up his fellow teammates over the years, and it was never anything this small, but it’s good to know that bribery works universally. “What do you say to some fries, Christina?”
“So we let it mean nothing?” Steve asks, verging on amused which doesn't fit at all. “The other me was in love with the other you and let that fact shape the fate of the universe in a desperate and twisted attempt at penance, and you think we should forget about it?”
“Well, that’s not going anywhere anytime soon,” Tony says to no one in particular, peering at the massive bruise staining the length of his flank. “J, we sure there’s no internal bleeding?”
“Can you even get food poisoning?” Tony asks aloud as they separate, only enough to reorient themselves with their chopsticks. “Or does the serum prevent that, too? Serious question.”
“You know the situation better than we do,” Bucky says, but then Sam’s got the phone again and Steve is wincing at the volume.
Tony slides his way back to Steve’s mouth, hands covering his shoulders, his biceps, his sides - he’s everywhere, and Steve is suffocating. He does his best to reciprocate, fingers scrabbling through the sea of starched fabric until he finds skin and strokes just above Tony’s belt. The moan that earns him reverberates pleasantly, slithering down Steve’s throat to the center of his chest where he just knows it’s going to take up residence until the end of time.
It makes sense, in some twisted way, Steve presumes. The New Year had broken with news that Tony’d been unceremoniously dumped by Pepper after the entire ordeal over Christmas - not that Steve blames her. He likes to think that in another lifetime, he too would have enough self-preservation to ditch Tony. In the two months since then, Tony’s been plastered all over the gossip rags for less-than-favorable reasons, ranging from stumbling out of clubs with oddly sized pupils to being caught the morning after a night with whichever blonde had been charmed enough to sleep with him.
Perhaps he’s ruined something, set something terrible into motion that he won’t know about for years to come.
“I didn’t tell you anything I didn’t want you to know,” Steve tells him before leaning forward to rap his knuckles on the desk once,
“I can’t believe I didn’t know,” Tony says, settling into his seat, one leg hooked over another and his first few shirt buttons undone, hands gesturing as he does. “I’ve known you - we’ve met before. I should have known.”
“She wanted to wait,” Howard says, like that makes it okay. “You’ve seen her. No way she was letting a kid get in the way before she got this whole operation up and running smoothly.”
Tony disappears back to the bathroom and Steve settles in again, but can’t bring himself to open the book.
“You’re going to explain that,” Tony tells him, and he darts forward to snag the keys right out of Steve’s back right pocket with quick fingers. Desperate to gain the upper hand, he strides up the walkway to the front porch, grinning when he hears Steve follow.
He’s got his legs around Steve’s waist, a desperate grip on his shoulders, and Steve is barely even holding him there. There’s the barest sensation of pressure under his left thigh, Steve’s other hand braced against the door, and Tony’s
“You know what you can tell them? You know what you can write in this crap-tastic article you seem intent on writing?” Steve flinches where Tony can’t see, not with his hands dragging down his face. “Tell them that Iron Man is fucking
“Not like that,” Tony attempts, but it’s useless. The damage is done and really, regret probably is the aptest description for whatever Tony is feeling that’s causing sour saliva to well up at the back of Steve’s tongue. He works his jaw, swallowing despite the awful taste. “Hey, you yourself said that you regret it, too.”
Steve does regret not buying a box, so on his way to Houston, he stops in another Walmart and buys two and a newspaper that talks about a charity that needs funding to further their efforts to reunite kids with their families. He eats dry cereal as he travels through Texas, and the burn in the back of his throat matches the one in the back of his eyes.
He’s so distracted by it that he nearly misses the way Tony’s eyes dart over to him, missing the jar with his knife before going back to the task at hand.
“I think we deserve to go out with a bang,” he says indulgently. “I have a few ideas. How do you feel about private islands? Lots of drinking out of coconuts, skinny dipping, that sort of thing.”
After that, he’d launched into an explanation of the history behind his repulsor technology while attempting to convince Steve that handing him the tools he needed wasn’t that tall of an order (“There was that one time I nearly turned Rhodey into pink mist, but I swear that was a fluke and had nothing to do with human error - you’ve just got longer arms than I do and this is bad for my back, c’mon - ”). Steve had respectfully declined, citing a rather favorable regard for his own wellbeing, and Tony had pouted for half a second before launching into a tirade against OSHA regulations.
“Just leave it,” Tony dismisses. “Someone will come around to clean up, I doubt I’ll be here much longer.”
“I might be able to clear part of my weekend for you,” he says, keeping his tone nonchalant. “Now that I think about it, you really do need supervision. Can’t trust you on your own, isn’t that what you were just saying?”
“Wasn’t going to,” Sam assures him, draining his mug and getting to his feet. “I’d stick around to watch you brood the day away, but I promised my nephews I’d show up at their games, so - ”
Tony rubs the pads of his fingers over what must be a phantom headache, turning around to look at something that Steve can’t see. Steve just watches him, his frame silhouetted against the black, almost all the house lights off. He doesn’t know what to do, whether to suggest they turn in for the night or try to wrap up everything with a neat bow, but then Tony makes the decision for him.
“You should get out of the way.” Tony repeats in an aimless slur, sliding his hand higher up the threshold before taking a single wobbling step forward. “I need the sink. I think I’m gonna be - ”
He never spins out very far from Steve’s orbit, even as he asks Laura for advice on how to deal with headstrong daughters and dares Peter to challenge Bucky to arm wrestle. By the time the food is ready, Steve feels sufficiently ogled and he’s gotten plenty of opportunities to study Tony’s backside. He dips his feet in the pool while he eats hot dogs and watermelon slices at Tony’s side, and lets himself be splashed by Clint’s youngest until he’s finally called out of the pool to be forced to eat something of substance.
Tony had always been the bolder of the two of them, and in this minute Steve can only be thankful for it.
It’s so tragically transparent and desperate, Steve’s sure that Tony’s going to laugh at him any second now, but he doesn’t care. Tony just lets out an odd noise, almost disbelieving - but not, that’s not right, it’s not dubious enough for that - and says:
“It’s something, isn’t it?” she says, knocking their shoulders together. “It was a bit of a collaborative effort if I’m being honest. Let me say, Tony isn’t easy to work with. I really would have liked something a little less rustic, but I guess all those years on the lake permanently changed his interior design preferences.”
A wounded noise inadvertently makes its way out of Tony’s throat and he reels Steve in as much as he can, aware that he’s semi-hard and pressed against a concrete stomach but genuinely unable to care.
“I’ll buy the fucking tux,” Tony murmurs, slow and syrupy as his liquor-washed breath laves over the bare skin high on Steve’s neck, pressed in close and hard. “You know I can, I will.”
He opens his mouth, prepared to fumble his way through an explanation of why he can’t explain anything at all, when Tony’s posture changes, eyes flitting beyond Steve.
It’s only then that the hard angles of Tony’s face begin to melt, gracious edges coalescing into something much less harsh.
When Steve’s internal clock wakes him, he doesn’t want to get up. He’s blissfully warm, tucked around a source of heat that he wants to nuzzle into. He almost goes to do so, his cheek ready to rub into soft curls the way a cat curls around a particularly excellent piece of furniture, when the rest of his awareness comes flooding in.
“We got really lucky with you,” she says, stepping back out of his embrace, and he lets her go as she rubs at her eyes with the inside of her wrists.
“Just be careful,” Steve says, because it’s the only thing he can reasonably think to say. “You don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings, or lead anyone on.”
They tie-dye. Morgan’s sheets come out aquamarine and tangerine, and Tony shudders at the combination, but she delights in it. They throw in a few white shirts for good measure, with Tony forcing Steve to make him one that’s vibrant red and sunny yellow, and Morgan forces Steve to do a red and royal blue one.
Tony nods, more to himself than anything as he leans against the frame of the car and strokes his jaw with his thumb and forefinger.
He wants to tell him where he’s from, what the Tony from his universe achieves, how he is only here living this life because of Tony Stark. Steve wants to sit down and unwind the tangled thread together, explain everything and let Tony help him because he knows, he
A knock on the edge of the slightly ajar door prevents Steve from retorting, and Natasha slinks inside with expectant brows.
“I’ve been negotiating,” Tony says like it’s nothing, when it’s decidedly something. “I think he’s just holding out, though. Waiting to see how much he can get me to offer. Course, he’ll probably just end up handing it over for nothing anyway, he’s slick like that.”
Other times Tony catches Rogers watching the evening news while eating various fruits: overpriced chunks of pineapple from the bodega he likes to frequent; crisp green-skinned apples neatly sliced into equally sized wedges; ripe, juicy peaches that drip juice down his long, blunt fingers, with nary a napkin in sight; blueberries that he picks through one-by-one, graciously complaining minimally when Tony reaches over from the back of the couch to swipe an overflowing handful on his way out the door.
“No,” Steve says, and he shakes his head even though Tony can’t see. “Look, I really appreciate what you’ve done. It means a lot to all of us here. But I don’t need you to do...whatever this is.”
“I thought about you in that cave,” Tony says, voiced raised just enough to get Steve to seal his lips shut and know that this isn’t the time to talk all over each other. “Could you have imagined that? That I’d flown over there, thought about working a little magic to track down your personal number and extend a casual open invitation for the next time you were in town, and ended up hooked to a car battery with a goddamn magnet in my chest?”
“Yours truly,” Tony says proudly, flicking through his holograms, and Steve wishes there was a way he could cook and watch him at the same time.
There’s a moment where Steve thinks that maybe they can laugh about it, where they can understand each other, but as soon as it feels possible, the possibility disappears.
“A reserve program sounds like a good idea,” Steve says, adjusting his head till it’s inclined in Tony’s direction, eyes barely cracking open before closing again. “We should start one.”
“Do I think what?” Steve asks, and Tony’s biting his lip like he’s not sure how to put it into words, so Steve tries to do it for him. “Do I think that it’s fate that I lived a whole life in another universe and yet still ended up here with you?”
This Tony will live a poor imitation of a childhood. He will be betrayed far too often and loved far less than he deserves, will lose his parents and gain an arc reactor and try his best to cobble together a life for himself after it all. This Tony has been dealt the same hand, and as much as Steve wants to change it all for the better, he is terrified of what will happen if he does.
“I would not have called had I believed there to be a better alternative,” Jarvis says, and Peggy crouches to lift a sleeping Tony off a hospital recliner and into her arms.
“Your mind sent you where it wanted to be,” she finishes, and he’d suspected, but it’s still nice to know. It makes sense, what with the flowers and animals and sunny open sky.
He slides home inch by trembling inch, and by the time he’s fully seated, he realizes that at some point during the process, their free hands have found each other. Tony is driving Steve’s into the mattress, both of them clutching fiercely, and he feels a little sideways at the enormity of it all.
“God,” Steve chokes out as Tony settles against him, every inch aligned so Steve can feel him sparking thick against the heaving arch of his stomach. “Yeah, okay,
Assuming that this is where Tony means for the interview to take place - if he ever returns, Steve thinks with a strangled laugh - Steve sits down in one of the armchairs to review the questions he’s supposed to ask.
he really needs to stop going down that road), Steve is forced to adjust the angle and pressure of his left arm to steady him. They’re not hugging, he tells himself firmly, they are absolutely not, because that would be ludicrous.
“No.” Steve doesn’t think about it for even a split second, and he’s tight but not the rigid kind of scared that Tony had been worst-case-scenario prepared for.
“I’ll be there when I’m needed,” he says, because he’s had years to think about this, and he’s fairly sure he’s pinpointed the moment he can change things.
It’s not easy, staying away from the others. He longs to spend time with Natasha again, wants to laugh with Sam, and aches to hug Bucky one last time. But he can’t do any of that, even after they all understand who the weird old man living among them is. He doesn’t know what Tony and Rogers had told them, and quite frankly, he doesn’t care. They’re in the home stretch now, and knowing can’t hurt anyone more than what would come if he were to stay away. Aside from Tony, he really only interacts with Rogers, but it’s clear that his other self had gotten all the answers he needed a long time ago. Probably had gotten them the first time they’d met, if Steve thinks on it.
“What?” he asks, because this is Beth, who asks Steve to buy her tampons without blinking and wants to take a bus to visit Callie over spring break.
“Really?” Bonnie breathes out, leaning in and twirling the ends of her hair around her finger. “That was real? That wasn’t CGI?”
“Got a super-sized bed for the super soldier,” Tony says. “There’s the attached bathroom - you’ve got an extra tall shower head, lots of attachments that are supposed to help with sore muscles. A custom bathtub, although I don’t know, do you like soaking?”
“I’m here.” Those shockingly cold fingertips are now touching the inside of his palm, fully prying Steve’s hand away from where it’s digging into the wool. “It’s okay, Steve. Do you want me to go? Because I can - ” Steve shakes his head vehemently, and his entire face hurts. “Okay, I’m here, then. Not going anywhere.”
Steve is grinning wide, fingers easily finding Tony’s side under his suit jacket and pinching him through his dress shirt.
“I need another drink,” Tony says, a faraway look turning his eyes unfocused as he scans the room, the thrum of a heavy bassline vibrating through the sticky floor and up along the center pole. “What do you think?”
“If you are who I think you are,” she asks, gaze hardened and pointed, “what the hell are you doing here?”
Steve swallows quickly, esophagus uncomfortably hot. “It doesn’t have to be if you don’t want it to. I’m not going to be a jackass who lets them print stuff just for shock value and clout.” He shrugs a little, and Tony’s eyes zero in on the mug.
As calmly as he can, heart beating a tattoo against the inside of his chest, Steve turns and rests the length of his forearm along the top of the car. He dips his head down, just about bowled over by the intensity in Tony’s eyes but determined to match it as best as he can.
The problem is, Steve thinks, treading water and drowning in dark eyes - eyes that he knows are the richest of brown, mischievous and magnetic - that he’s pretty sure this isn’t part of the assignment.
“No more lying,” Steve says, reaching over to adjust Tony’s flower crown, to tuck the blooms further in amongst the sheer mass of hair atop his head. “So trust me when I tell you - other you didn’t even come close.”
“Because believe it or not, I don’t love it when you make fun of me,” Steve says, and Tony frowns, eyes drifting to where Steve’s ass is high in the air as he reaches under the desk to grab a few straggling pencils and paper clips.
“Okay,” he says, and all the brightness is gone. He sounds deflated, almost careless. “I just thought - if there was something I could do. We’ve been trying to coordinate all over the country. Have SI do what it can. And you - ”
Those icy fingers wrap around the wrist working its way to Tony’s hip, tight enough to demand attention. Steve can feel the rosy bloom as it works its way across his cheeks and blinks his eyes open, ready to joke about being the forward one for once, but instead is greeted with a carefully blank expression.
Months pass. Steve plants the seeds from the garden he’d grown for his wife, and Tony attempts to recruit Peter Parker, an event that the Tony from his universe would be happy to know remains a constant. When Tony runs into trouble with his calculations, Steve gives him Scott Lang’s number, and they have several very long and argumentative conversations that have Steve stifling a grin as he eavesdrops. The weight of Bucky’s arm affects him more and more as he remains out of cryofreeze, and when Steve suggests giving the Wakandans a call, Tony gapes at him.
“So you think it’s on you to save the world?” Steve questions. “Some people might respect the large amount of accountability you’ve assigned yourself since the kidnapping.”
“Just keep it, yeah?” He’s suddenly all artificial brightness, the kind that Steve swears very few people can tell isn’t the real thing. “You don’t have to wear it, because you’re right. It’s a very distinctive color, and you really can’t ever wear something like that again. Just keep it, I don’t care if you ever wear it again, but don’t let anyone else wear it. Can you do that for me?”
“At Target?” he asks petulantly, and Steve places a hand on his thigh, all warm and electric. “Was I that distracted by all the body washes?”
“You know,” he says, once Tony steals the cone back, claiming that Steve is getting all the good bits of the fudge core, “one day, she actually will turn her photon blasts on you. And then I’m going to have to find someone else to defile all your properties with.”
“Just remember what I told you,” Steve says, and the look in Tony’s eyes assures him that he remembers, and that he will always have something to live for. “I can only imagine what else you will go on to achieve, but I am sure it will be incredible.”
“The Battle of New York was the same,” he begins, and by the time he’s detailing the specific sequence of events that led to the Accords, Tony looks troubled.
Steve feels something inside him grow light, feels it lessen, and nothing has ever felt like such sweet success.
“I’m offended,” Tony says, lifting bags to find the lightest one. “Seriously, I’ll have you know that just last month I set a new PR in the weight room, and even Banner was impressed with - hey!”
It gives the effect of cutting the two of them off from the masses, and Steve isn’t sure what to do with that.
Tony cracks an eye open and directs it at where Steve’s clutching the arms of the chair. Aware of how firmly he’s holding on, Steve loosens his grip.
It’s why they work so well, because they communicate when they need to and trust each other unquestionably.
“Okay,” he reassures her, and any hidden tension in her features dissipates. “I won’t. Just tell me what to do.”
When Steve returns, he’s got that furrow between his brow, visible even in the near dark, and Tony sits up in alarm. He orders the lights on and then he can see, can get a good look at what Steve’s got in his hands.
It had felt like a stab to the back and a balm to his soul all in one when he’d initially received it, and Steve had scoffed at it while his thumb readied itself to delete the one-sided exchange. He’d been sitting behind his desk, loosening his tie and getting ready to sign onto his work email for the day while savoring the last few moments he had to check his personal phone on his own time. In the time it had taken him to roll up his sleeves and turn on his work monitor, his answer had been decided for him.
“I just know better than to mess with the hair,” Steve says, and Tony pouts exaggeratedly until Morgan announces she’s hungry and they agree to get dressed and pick up dinner at a hole-in-the-wall sandwich place.
“To be fair, I’m not sure the planet could safely contain both your ego and hers for any significant period of time.”
“I’m so sorry,” he apologizes reflexively, palms shooting out to steady the woman, and the face attached to the ponytail barely spares him a glance before turning towards the front of the line.
“You’ve got to meet Callie,” Beth says, pushing through carpeted hallways and waving to those she passes. “It’s lunch now - we can take you to the main eating area. We eat in shifts, to make it easier for Hank and Rachel. They take care of the food for us. Today’s turkey sandwiches. Do you like Cheetos?”
(Near the bottom of the list is the fact that Steve eats cold pizza for breakfast sometimes, which is absolutely unacceptable. Tony refuses to allow that into his life.)
They find themselves in some strip club a short limousine ride away - a ride full of Tony artfully dodging questions about his company’s weapons contracts and his rather colorful dating history in between turning the attention back on Steve until he’s fighting a rising blush and almost forgetting that Happy the bodyguard is just a couple of feet away in the driver’s seat, respectably ignoring every word exchanged as the radio plays on low.
“What are you doing?” Tony asks, idly wrapping a loose hand around his cock for lack of anything better to do in the interim, but also because he knows he looks good like this and wants Steve to be able to appreciate it.
He only realizes that his eyes are closed when Tony doesn’t respond and he has to open them to look over at where Tony is sitting in silence, as unmoving as marble as he rests a loose fist on one thigh crossed over the over. His other hand sits on the ledge of the car door interior, and he gazes off into the distance. As the real world beyond Tony Stark begins to rudely break into Steve’s processing center, it becomes apparent that the car is parked.
“What did you think of the avocado toast?” Tony asks, shifting a plate bearing the remains of latkes, applesauce and sour cream smeared across the ceramic. That had been a hit, he recalls.
“Of course I needed you. It’s like you forget everything I’ve ever said. Do you remember what I said when I came back from space?”
He can hear distant voices entwined with the sounds from the creatures around him. When he sits up he can see a ladybug crawling on the inside of his bare foot, and he carefully lifts the insect with the edge of his index fingernail before setting it free in the dirt. There are birds squawking somewhere beyond his line of vision, less musical than the ones he’d first heard upon his arrival but no less brilliant for it. The flowers remain, and Steve gets to his feet to stand among them, up to his knees in the nearly overwhelmingly fragrant blooms.
That afternoon, Steve’s in the middle of patching the screen door when Bonnie steps out onto the small screened-in porch.
“I always thought I’d be the one kissing you,” Tony says, and it’s so surreal that he feels almost giddy with it. “I can’t believe you did it first.”
Tony shakes his head. “I’ve got steaks thawing for dinner,” he says, jabbing a thumb towards the door.
Bucky doesn’t love talking on the phone, has been mostly solemn and reserved in this new century, but he does take the phone from Sam, and Steve is grateful.
“Have we spooked you?” she asks, and when he looks up, her head is tilted sideways in a genuine question, hair spilling out from where it’s knotted low at the nape of her neck.
He feels as light as air, and for the first time in his life, feels truly content with what he is leaving behind.
Steve goes for a run and comes back to find Tony and Peter with their heads together over some kind of suit improvements, so he finds Bucky in the gym. It’s been a while since he’s sparred with anyone, but they’re pretty evenly matched and Bucky never pulls any punches, so he finds his footing with minimal difficulty. Sam lifts weights in the corner and makes fun of Steve and his breakfast attire, but Bucky just rolls his eyes and blocks Steve’s next blow.
Painfully aware of how much he wants this, of how his body is ready to respond to every little thing they do, Tony weighs all his options. He zeroes in on the one with the greatest chance of giving him what he wants without offending Steve’s apparently delicate sensibilities, and gets to his feet.
Steve lifts one pair of joined hands, aware of Tony watching him curiously, and brushes a dry kiss over two very different sets of knuckles. His pink-pale alternating with olive warm, Tony’s fingers slight compared to his. Wispy hairs tickle his lips, and when he picks up his head and dares to glance at Tony, he can’t look away.
“You might wanna get him out of here before Ben loses his shit,” she informs him. “A chance to meet his favorite superhero? He’s gonna puke. No offense, Steve. Ben picked a favorite long before you came around.”
It’s worth the effort it takes to focus because this time he sees a flash of brown. Rich, like the chocolate flowers.
“I’d like to try it,” Steve says, and Tony just really loves him. Even now, he’s resolute in a way that Tony adores, going after what he wants regardless of the risks.
“I think we love each other in every universe,” Steve says, and he’s breathing warm and steady, pressing hard against Tony’s ass, intent as plain as the day before them. “There’s no way we don’t.”
“I like this one,” Tony responds instantly, and he’s edging around the circular table too quickly, bumping up against Steve’s side like a wildfire. “Steve’s barely even really a journalist - more of a friend, at this point.”
“I thought - ” Tony frowns, lopsided and bothered. “You look familiar. Like something...someone from a dream. Not like someone I knew.”
He waits for Steve to struggle it out, watches Steve get distracted by a sudden rush of pleasure, mouth opening and closing erratically like he wants to speak but literally can’t string a syllable together, and Tony keeps at it just like that, raining kisses down on Steve’s face from his eyebrows to his chin to keep from losing himself in the wet-enveloping-fiery bliss that’s being inside of Steve like this.
Steve’s at the end of his rope because he knows exactly what’s in the garment bag and he’s pretty sure he knows exactly how it’s gotten to him, and he’d rather not confront that in the middle of his workplace at two in the afternoon in the middle of the week. He runs a hand through his hair yet again, nearly dislodging the pen in the process.
It’s the easy assumption that Steve will stay, that this is where Tony wants him to be. That’s what gives Steve the courage that he’s lacked for the better part of his life, and he steps forward, feeling the damp earth give under him, just slightly.
“If it makes a difference, I’m kind of a professional when it comes to getting things past you,” Steve says, and the corner of his mouth quirks up. “Let’s not forget that time with the force field.”
He contemplates slipping away, gently and slowly until they never have to touch each other ever again.
“Neither do I,” Tony says with a shrug. “Tried to make a PB&J once and got raspberry jam all over the kitchen. Ana thought I’d hurt myself, said it looked like blood.”
When he’s in the middle of crouching down in front of the vegetable patch, considering poking through the soil to make sure they’re not missing any hidden gems within its depths, he hears Steve approach. It means that Steve wants to be heard coming, because he’s so light on his feet sometimes that he could give Natasha a run for her money, and Tony ignores the fondness unfurling in his chest as he balances his forearms on his knees.
“Do you think we can set up a reserve program?” Tony asks, even though they’re hardly in any shape to be discussing this currently. “So I don’t have to fully retire?”
“I need a moment,” he says, knowing that he sounds grief-stricken but feeling too old and worn to care. “I’ll tell you the rest later.”
Instead, Steve heads back to the place he stayed in when he wasn’t keeping Natasha company at the compound. It looks as it did the last time he was there, and he packs a duffel bag and finds the stash of cash behind a loose brick. There’s a cap jammed on his head, he exchanges most of the cash for a bike that’s old but runs well enough, and he gets the hell out of dodge.
“A pain in my ass,” Tony swears under his breath, but he’s grinning wryly, and despite the little time they’ve spent together in this universe, Steve understands him better than anyone else besides himself.
It’s just a box of cereal, some kid-friendly brand full of sugar and packed with vitamins and minerals to make up for it. Instead of grabbing it, the way his instincts tell him to, he picks up a box two down from it and pretends to be reading the nutritional facts of something with too much chocolate to ever count as breakfast when he hears it.
“I’ve met him before,” he placates, shifting his body in the direction of the main dining area in the hopes that Tony can follow cues. “You might not remember me, but we’ve met before. Years ago. I interviewed you, and Happy drove us around.”
There’s no way this is his Steve, because while he’s always been bold where it counts, he’s never been forward like this.
“I think I’d like to learn,” Steve says thoughtfully, reaching out and snagging a lemon-pepper chicken. It’s still steaming in its packaging. “If the other me could do it, surely I can.”
Tony clicks his teeth back together and pulls his fork back to his side of the table, shaking his head to clear the visual before it grows roots in his brain matter.
For too long, the only sound is the squealing and honking from a distant intersection and the general buzz of nighttime insects. Steve shifts his weight around, shoes feeling too tight after too many hours on his feet, and tugs at the cuff of his sleeve when he realizes that Tony is looking at him soberly, eyes big and full of something that Steve wishes he could understand. No longer ebullient and exalting in the revelry, Tony seemed stripped, and in turn, Steve feels far more raw than he would like.
Tony’s reaching out too, fingers hooking around Steve’s wrist. It’s nothing he couldn’t shake loose if he wanted to, but Steve waits, all his not-anger bubbling low and evenly inside, ready to overflow if he lets it.
Only her profile looks familiar, and she must be thinking the same thing about him as she does a double-take.
“Do you feel this?” Steve says, hushed and humble. “The universe let a man from another timeline come here to make sure we ended up together. Do you really think the universe would let something so significant happen only once?”
“Not in front of the kids,” Clint says, exaggeratedly putting a hand over his eyes, and Steve just leans over to watch where Carol has somehow found a captive audience in the oldest two without managing to scare them away from the compound permanently.
“Ah, there we go. I think he’s had enough now.” Bucky said happily, getting up to let Clint out. Not before he reached under and began to stroke Clint’s cock hard and fast, getting whines out of the omega. His cock must have been super sensitive after just coming and all he could do was whine and buck into the hand. Bucky must have been at it for at least ten minutes before Tony heard him.
“Hey Tones, as you can see Clint is okay.” Bucky laughed from where he sat, reading the newspaper like the old man that he was.
Omg, the last time I updated was July. Not cool of me. I. This chapter is more Clint based but I promise it's only this one to just establish some things so I don't have to explain them later. The next chapter will be focused more on Tony and Steve's point of view!
Hey! This is another commission. Let me know what you think of this :) Comments and kudos are always appreciated. Also don't forget to follow me on twitter!
Nothing could stop the heat coursing through Tony’s body, no matter how much he wanted it to. His body shook with want and there was an ache inside him that needed to be filled. Sweat trickled down his forehead and he groans in frustration, he really didn’t have time for this.
“I think I’d like that, actually,” Steve says, thinking of how he’d meant to travel the country before happening upon Denise and Josie. “I can’t remember if I’ve ever been to California before.”
“Unless you have more questions, or are ready to head out,” Tony offers. His neck cranes to look at the time. “It isn’t that late, and you’re not terrible company when you’re not acting so self-righteous and trying to force your opinions on me, but I can get FRIDAY to order us a pizza so I can pick your mind and bare top-secret secrets without risking you dying of hunger.”
“I think the only one here getting bored is Morgan,” Steve says, and Tony smiles behind his hand. “Really though, it’s been nice. Feels like what everyone says a vacation is supposed to be.”
It’s like slipping on a favorite sweater as Tony shows Steve around. It’s a house, Tony supposes, but stresses that it’s important not to draw an excess of parallels between that which exists in this plane and that back on Earth.
, and the impact is lessened immensely, Sokovia still standing by the end of it. Bruce still gets away, because he is an entity that Steve had never fully understood, an inevitability he cannot prevent. He watches the news and then calls the number for his office at the compound, once he is sure it is up and running.
“Tony here was telling me about what he wants to be when he grows up,” Steve says, wrapping his hand around Peggy’s, eyes still trained on Tony. He waves his hands around when he talks, always restless, just as Steve’s Tony had been. “What was it again, Tony?”
“It was a good article. No wonder he doesn’t hate you.” Steve forces himself to meet Rhodes’ eyes dead-on. “He really does hate all journalists. I guess you’re the exception.”
“ - Don’t understand why we’re doing this,” a distinctive voice is complaining, and as Happy’s bulk shifts out of the doorway, Steve’s attention is irresistibly drawn to the person already seated in the back of the car. “What’s with the jaunt down the street, she didn’t spend enough time with her personal trainer this week?”
“So I was thinking,” Tony says, his voice rising in that way where he’s demanding to be listened to, and Steve behaves. “That since your road trip kind of got derailed when you decided to adopt a million kids, we could pick up where you left off. Take Morgan for a week or two, and end up back in Malibu.”
It’s only then that he realizes the silence between them has stretched out into some awful trench of a thing, separating them and transforming whatever easy banter they’d shared into strained unfamiliarity. He clears his throat, figuring that it’s probably best to salvage as much as possible by parting ways, but Tony just meets his eyes ruefully.
“I didn’t want you to,” Steve says. “You can understand the risks. You are only the fifth person to know.”
Life had been a whirlwind for a while, and that was all without factoring in the emotional rollercoaster he’d been set on upon news of Tony’s rescue. Tony, who’s now got some fancy suit of armor further separating him from the mere mortals of the world, and any delusions Steve may have once held about the single night spent in each other’s company has long since mellowed into a kind of warped respect for the man who upended his life and nearly ruined his company all in the name of doing the right thing.
“Ow,” he says, pushing up onto his elbows and shooting Steve a grumpy look. “The hell was that for?”
“Not...usually.” He trails off because there are a lot of things he probably shouldn’t do, many of which he’s already done.
“This is for young Parker here,” Tony says, and he just barely avoids Steve’s outstretched arm to hand the wooden stick to Peter. “You’re a grown man, you can get your own dessert.”
There’s a glint to Tony’s eye, something that Steve doesn’t want to see grow roots, so he puts an end to the visit and declines to visit the Tower at any time.
“Just for that,” he says, poking a finger at Steve’s face as they walk through the automatic doors, “I call first shower.”
Privately, Steve thought that sounded like a whole lot of bullshit, but ultimately decided that it wasn’t worth commenting on.)
Steve feels like he’s waiting for something. Some sort of sign, a grand signal, something to tell him that it’s okay to tell Tony the last of it. The most important bit of it all. He opts for a truth that isn’t quite it, but close enough.
“Well, then,” Tony says, stroking the clean lines of his facial hair, hoping to hell he looks exactly like a scheming corporate villain. “You’re just going to have to do me a favor and point me in the direction of one Mr. Rogers.”
He needs to know. He’s put himself out there, and there’s no rush, but they’re finally together again and there’s so much they never talked about.
Peter gets hilariously pink and tipsy, determinedly quiet in order to avoid embarrassing himself, and Steve respects that. Wanda doesn’t drink, and as she directs the dishes to soak in the sink with practiced hand motions, Steve leans over to whisper to Tony over their freshened drinks.
For Steve has told him how he ended up here, has told him how everything has lined up, has told him more than he has told anyone else in this universe. He hasn’t told him everything, because he can’t,
From there he heads west, because any further south would be too far south. He stops on the side of the road to help two middle-aged women without a carjack change a flat tire. They thank him profusely, offer him snacks from the cooler they’ve packed for their trip into the mountains, and he accepts an apple while their baby babbles and blows spit bubbles from the safety of one of his mothers’ arms. What he does refuse is an offer of payment, despite their insistence that he’d saved them time and money. Steve doesn’t know how much a tow truck charges, but he climbs back on his bike after watching them merge back onto the highway.
“I know things!” he defends. “I personally experience the same mundane banalities as everyone else. Celebrities are just like us, you know.”
“Maybe,” he says. “My wife has lived a full life, and I have remained at her side for its entirety.”
He half expects fairies to twinkle in the air and a golden unicorn to appear in front of him. It’s that exact sort of mythical beauty, that which humans only fantasize about and never get to see, and it’s not at all what he expected. Knowing Tony, he’d expected a sudden steel monument to rise up high out of the ground in front of him, but this is different and nothing Steve would have guessed. It’s so similar to the meadow Steve had woken up in, with grasshoppers chirruping and a bubbling fountain that stands in the middle of a very miniature pond fed by thin rivulets coursing gently over rocks, and he suspects that Natasha’s demonstration has something to do with its existence.
“I get it,” Tony assures him, tone all bravado that’s a direct contrast to his body language. He moves to cross his arms but stops at the last second, pushing at gelled-back hair before shoving his hands in his pockets. “Wouldn’t want you puking in the air again, would we?”
sucked his dick,” Clint chortles, and while Natasha threatens to dump Clint’s hazelnut International Delight down the break room sink if he doesn’t stop acting like an overgrown pubescent adolescent, Steve mentally braces to scrap the entire thing and start from scratch.
“They’re good kids,” Tony says, and he’s hovering, swanning around the family room and peering at picture frames, picking up knick-knacks and turning them over in his hands.
It turns out that Tony’s managed to be sweet-talked into driving the teenage boys to school, and Steve loses him as he gets pulled into an argument between Jackson and Serena about who gets to play with the Nintendo on the way to school. Josie has to intervene, pushing them out the door so she can walk them to the bus stop.
“You think I need someone to tell me that you brood?” Sam asks in amusement, and Steve clangs his teeth together all wrong as Sam smirks broadly. “I’ve known you for how long now, and you think I can’t tell when you get in your head about something?”
The compound looks different but similar enough that if he hadn’t lived there as long as he had, it might take a while to pinpoint the differences. As it is, when he gets out of the car, he feels like he could puke up his meat and cheese platter.
Tony, who’ve probably never met him even once - pass judgments and pretend like they know anything, makes him borderline nauseous.
“She’s not even tall enough,” Tony says, scrubbing a hand over his face after she leaves the room, slamming her bedroom door above them. “I’m not building the kid stilts so she can fly out of a harness and die, all in the name of the world’s weakest adrenaline rush.”
you spent all this time thinking I wanted to play twenty questions with you.”), Steve can almost ignore the looming self-imposed deadline.
Tony can feel his brow crease with confusion, because he’d barely known the older Steve Rogers before he’d come to the compound and spilled his entire life’s story in between quietly watching as Tony worked on interdimensional time travel. As significant a mark he’d left behind, Tony hadn’t known him, no matter what Steve says to the contrary.
“We’re not dragging Steve to Disney,” Tony says, and he glances at Steve in a way that indicates the reasoning behind that statement is more complicated than he’s willing to divulge in front of Morgan. “I’m using a veto on that one.”
Just as Steve is about to resign himself to never knowing the truth, to accept that putting himself out there may not prove as fruitful as he’d always imagined and maybe Tony isn’t the sort of person to give him honesty -
“You could’ve told me that we’d hitchhiked from Nevada, or that we’d rode unicorns to the moon and back, and I would've believed you,” Steve says, the confession more significant than intended. “Because I do trust you. I do believe you when you tell me I didn’t get sick, and I believe that you chose me to break your retirement news for a reason. So can I trust you to tell me what really happened?”
“In every universe,” Steve agrees, and he speeds up and kisses the back of Tony’s neck and tells him how much he loves him until Tony spills over his fist with a never-ending marrow-deep shudder.
“Yeah, I get that,” Pepper says knowingly, and he grimaces, biting his tongue because even though it’s been literal eons since they’d broken up for good, he knows it still stings both of them to think about too hard. There were way too many things she’d wanted that he hadn’t been able to give. “But you’ll never know if you don’t ask.”
“He said nothing bad,” he promises, and cringes at his middle school conversational skills. He’s supposed to be a hired journalist, for crying out loud, not head of the yearbook committee. “I just.” He makes an ambiguous movement with the hand that isn’t clutching his phone, holding out fingers in a poor imitation of typing on a computer. “I did my research. You’re...you’re actually very impressive,” he admits. “But. For the record. Tony did speak very highly of you.”
So Peggy takes her leave and Steve recruits Tony to help him with the dishes, standing on a chair next to the sink with a dish towel to help dry. Tony doesn’t drop a single thing, and when they’re done, Tony insists that Steve come look at the robot he’d stolen from Howard’s office.
“This isn’t where I thought you’d settle,” Steve admits, once Natasha has embarked on a considerate patrol and Tony has turned the sky into a sparkling tapestry of midnight blue, the stars an imperfect replica of those that hung above New York. It had been abrupt, no sunset to bridge the transition, and Steve makes a note to steal that particular chore from Tony from here on out.
“It’s just Steve, now,” he says, and they shake hands while Carol pulls tequila out of seemingly nowhere.
Tony’s face goes shadowy, but lightens just as quickly. “I did say that,” he murmurs, and there’s a pause where Steve thinks about retracting his acquiescence, if only to avoid whatever tempting brand of illicit thoughts dance behind Tony’s eyes. It’s not that Steve’s self-centered enough to be convinced that Tony is thinking about him - it’s the principle of the matter, which is that he shouldn’t care very much in the first place. But then Tony’s lifting off the chaise with all the agility of a man who routinely pilots a very heavy suit with impressive maneuverability at high speeds, and Steve follows.
(What he doesn’t voice is the recollection that Tony had said Rhodes liked Steve. It’s not pertinent, no matter how it boosts Steve’s ego.)
Steve immediately jerks, his hips searching upwards, and Tony hides a satisfied grin with a filthy open-mouthed kiss, corralling Steve’s wild tongue with his and stroking that same nipple once more, twice more, the pad of his thumb as light as air as the skin pebbles up and pushes back. It’s amazing and he’s brightly aware of Steve pinning him to the door, hand lifting off his thigh in acquiescence, and Tony pauses the bruising kiss long enough to divest Steve of his shirt entirely.
“You could’ve done that earlier,” Steve says, and it’s unnecessary because they both know it. He says it anyway, and Tony responds anyway.
“Maybe take a break,” Tony admits before he realizes how honest he’s being, but finds he doesn’t mind. “I’m getting too old for this.”
Now it’s Steve’s turn to be disappointed, only that rapidly turns into acceptance. He still isn’t exactly sure of what happened last night, doesn’t know if he ever will, but he knows that he’s grandly overstayed his welcome and has a job on the east coast to get back to.
When he settles into bed for the night after helping Peggy with her nightly routine, she strokes the back of his hand. It’s not as certain as it used to be, but has the same effect as always.
Serena magnanimously allows her hands to be squeezed within an inch of her life as Steve cleans the shallow wound, and Christina howls in childlike pain. He winces but keeps going, dabbing on Neosporin with a cotton swab and reminding himself to thank Denise for keeping the first aid kit stocked. Just as he’s handing Christina the box of Disney Princess Band-aids, letting her pick who she wants plastered over her knee, the phone rings.
Tony’s face is plastered all over the screen, press photos of him on red carpets mixed in amongst the newscasters’ serious expressions.
But Tony knows Steve. He knows that he’s heard every word, and he knows without seeing that despite Steve refusing to slow down, he’s got that special quirk to his mouth. It’s a gift and a curse, knowing Steve so well, but he wouldn’t trade it for the world.
“What, go to a funeral?” Steve asks, and he’s sitting on the front edge of his desk so that when Tony looks up, his mouth goes dry at the elevated angle of his spread legs. “I thought we agreed we weren’t giving him one, and I’m kind of hoping we won’t be losing anyone else for a very long time.”
Rogers makes a noise as he eats, and Tony can’t tell if it’s surprise or pleasure or shocked disapproval. He feels like he’s on the edge of his seat as he waits for a verdict.
“I know what I’m doing,” Tony says, but there’s no hint of a protest. Steve’s fingers go to claw at the foreign object in direct opposition to his screaming conscience a split second too late to have any kind of effect, because Tony is wiping at his saliva-slick mouth with the edge of his hand while clambering off Steve’s lap with far more elegance than anyone who’s seemingly consumed as much as he’s appeared to has any right to. It leaves Steve bereft, that icy sensation leaching from his capillaries into his muscles and his skin. “
They sit together for what feels like seconds and eons, wound together, utterly unconcerned with anything else.
Acceptance has given Steve the ability to breathe. He reads articles with a steady heartbeat and scans magazines in checkout lines without dropping anything. Pictures on the news don’t bother him, and occasionally he feels a flicker of tightness in his chest when he’s confronted with that familiar face, but that’s it. He isn’t angry, or lovesick, or heartbroken. Maybe he’ll never really be
“What do you think?” He asked his Dad, turning the phone to him. Tony gave it a quick glance before nodding his approval.
Steve’s growl cut Clint short. “I mean in a totally platonic way. As friends.” He continued on, not wanting to get on the bad side of a protective Alpha.
Bucky looked back down at Tony. “Why would you be upset over that? It’s perfectly normal for Omega’s to be naked.”
Tony really, really didn’t want to give in to this and it was completely selfish why he didn’t but he knew that what Peter said made sense as well. This would be a better way of letting the world know about him while keeping him completely safe and out of the camera’s harsh glare. He did have a few rules for it though.
I know. It's been forever. I'm sorry but I didn't realise how long it was going. Hope you like it. Please read tags on the story.
Steve settled back to watch Tony on the dildo, he looked amazing riding it. His tanned skin with a light sheen of sweat coating it, the movement of his subtle muscles in his arms and legs. His head thrown back, not caring about the audience he had. It was funny, he mused, that not even an hour ago he didn’t want to go around the tower naked and now he was sitting with the rest of his team not caring who was watching as he milked the fake cock.
“It’s not a baby seat Harley, it’s a Peter seat. Something designed just for him.” Tony cut Harley with his eyes, telling him to shut his mouth, and quickly. Harley glanced back at Peter and realised how distressed and upset he was getting by his crass comment.
Tony and Steve shared a look as the two little boys cried their hearts out. It was going to be a long day full of cranky boys after this. Tony just hoped they could be bribed with ice cream.
“C’mon kid. If you don’t get up all the good stuff will be gone.” Peter shot up, quickly realising that he still had trick or treating to do.
“I don’t think so baby but he will be staying until Sunday night. He’s starting MIT soon so he’ll be spending a lot of his weekends here with us.”
Bucky took the blanket greedily and shoved it between the headrest and his head, turning so he could shove his face into the blanket for comfort. It only took a few minutes of driving for Bucky to drift off, his little snores filling up the car. Peter wasn’t far behind him, all it took was giving him his iron man plushie and he was out for the count as well. It was lucky too. The drive was around 2 hours long. This was the best scenario he could have hoped for.
“Now or never Tones.” Steve grabbed his hips as he pounded into him, and Tony could feel the come coating his insides. It was enough to send him into his own orgasm, a big enough one that it left him shaking afterwards. He felt Steve’s knot tying them together once more and sighed, he was never getting to his lab.
Tony looked at his science bro, appalled that he threw him under the bus without the blink of an eye.
Was Captain America Daddy? How? Why? Where in the heck was he? He whined and buried his head further into Mr Stark’s neck.
Tony shrugged, “We don’t I’m going to make ours before we make yours. I’m putting your account on alerts as well so anytime you’re mentioned both of us will be notified.”
“So tomorrow I was going to go out and meet a few friends in the evening if that’s okay with you?” Harley said, bringing Peter’s attention back to the conversation.
“Please.” Tony whimpered when Steve repeated it for the fourth time. He was clutching onto Steve’s arm, unsure if he wanted him to stop or continue. “Please.”
Steve lifted Tony’s face up so that he could give him a proper claiming kiss, their tongues warring for dominance before Tony relented and allowed Steve to take control. Most Alpha’s would be enraged that their omega would do something like that but Steve liked the little bit of defiance in Tony. His whole life revolved around him being in control, Steve understood it, without being in control he would have lost Stark Industries years ago to the board. Now that they were mated though, Steve would have fun watching Tony realise that he didn’t need to have control all the time. Going to visit Clint and Bucky would be the first test he’d have, somehow Steve didn’t think Tony would enjoy being fucked in front of anyone at any time but that’s what this week was all about; getting Tony over his initial embarrassment. During his heat was one thing but Steve was sure Tony wouldn’t be too happy for Clint and Bucky to see him fucked during the visit. Steve smiled and bent down to give Tony another kiss, he couldn’t wait to see Tony’s blush.
Harley opened his mouth and closed it again, shaking his head. He didn’t know what to say. Tony got that. He wasn’t sure himself.
Tony took the sleeper that Steve tossed him and manoeuvred Bucky into it and had handy buttons at the bottom for when it came time to get his little boosters. Once he was sitting back against Tony comfortably Cho began the mental exam.
Steve raised a brow. “I think I’m being very lenient. I could take it back and have you go naked the all the time. I could also lock your cock and keep your hole full all the time as punishment for arguing with your Alpha?” He asked conversationally.
“Not going to find them there and I think we both know you need to say the magic words.” Bucky teased.
This is a link to my twitter if you want to follow. It's updates on when I'll be posting new chapters and what story is being updated next.
Steve looked at his upset Omega up and down. He couldn’t see the issue. It was the third day into Tony’s heat and Steve felt stable enough that he might not kill the others around his Omega. Tony looked amazing, tousled hair, sleepy eyes, flushed cheeks, tanned body, his mating bite on full display along and his cock standing proudly up.
Steve grinned as he watched his omega carefully standing while trying to ignore the plug that was sending delicious sensations straight through him.
Steve and Tony shared a look and nodded, before Tony took his original seat beside Natasha while Steve went and settled beside Bucky, giving him a gentle smile as he put a comforting arm around his shoulders. It made Bucky clench his teeth but not say anything, well used to how Steve was to know he’d be hurt if Bucky tried to know his arm off.
Peter shrugged, “I suppose. That’s a Mama and Papa problem and not a Peter problem.” He said cheekily as he sat down on at the table and tucked into his Dad’s homemade lasagne. He didn’t need people on Twitter to approve of him all he needed was his parents and he’d be okay.
“Better. I think Bucky loves it secretly. He gets to get cuddles, and everything is done for him without having to ask. He’s pretty shy, so this is an ideal situation for him. Peter is just as bubbly as he always is.”
Peter bit his lip, unsure if he should ask, “ Well, I- Do- Do you…” he trailed off not sure how to ask. What if Dad got super annoyed at him? Or decided to ground him for asking? Peter’s breath began to speed up as he thought of the worst case scenario’s that could come out of asking. He hated asking things like this of his parents. They were so overprotective that it always leads to an argument.
Peter swung his legs back and forth as he waited for his parents to get ready, laughing when Papa gave out about wearing Ugg boots.
Clint nodded and made sure his focus stayed on Bucky and no one else, even when he heard Tony whimper and Steve laugh he didn’t turn his gaze away. It wasn’t hard to keep his focus either because somehow Bucky was turning this into something sensual. Clint’s main priority was staying soft which was a battle he was losing quickly. Bucky had his chest bared extremely quickly and gave a pinch to both his nipples before he moved to his belt, getting an involuntary moan from him. His hand flew up to cover his mouth which made Bucky and Bruce laugh.
Well, no rest for the wicked; Tony and Steve stood up together and linked hands while they went to get their youngest. Peter would be asleep a while yet. No matter how tired they were, they wouldn’t trade this life for anything.
“It’s okay, we’re going to get you tested and then figure out how you’ve hidden your classification for so long. Once that’s done we’ll see about getting you some relief. Only if you’re good though.” Clint wanted to groan. Of course, this would happen to him. “Lift your leg. And the other one. There we go, now, c’mere.” Bucky said grabbing hold of him so that he was sitting back on his lap. Thankfully he was sitting sideways with his sore bottom hanging in between Bucky’s legs. He watched Bruce warily as he came forward with a needle.
“Papa and I monitor your twitter feed. Once the account is set up then I’m putting in some muted words and accounts that I don’t want you looking at and you’re not to take them off. Karen and Friday will be both monitoring that part of it. You also put it on your account bio that we’re monitoring it and you follow both of us.”
“Here, use my phone to set it up. That way I won’t have to log in after, it’ll be ready to go.” Tony rolled his eyes but took the offered phone, letting it read his thumbprint to open it, throwing his other arm around Peter’s shoulders, bringing him in close so he could see the setup. “God forbid you have to type something.”
“Looks like someone finally decided to wake up Mama.” He commented, “Come up here to me, your poor Mama needs to pee.” Peter grumbled but didn’t kick up too much of a fuss, cuddling into his Daddy’s chest when he was close enough, earning a laugh from the captain.
“There you go, good boy. You better keep it that way for me.” He gave his cock one last stroke before letting go and unstrapping him from the bench.
“Yes, we’re looking for it to be as quick as possible, Bucky isn’t going to like it one bit so we just need the physical, the little boosters and blood tests.”
Peter was sitting on the bed in his pyjamas, knees up against his chest, hair dripping with excess water and eyes red-rimmed.
Steve gestured to the corner where an ottoman was placed for decorative purposes. “Could you open that and take out the blue box and bring it to me? I don’t want to move Tony just yet.”
“Is Tony okay?” He asked, looking Tony over. There didn’t seem to be anything wrong with him. He was constantly squirming on Steve’s lap as he milked his cock. He could still see the sheen of slick on the dildo that was on the chair beside Steve so he was just off it. He glanced at Tony’s cock that was hard and flushed but didn’t look to be overly red.
Predictably, Peter fell asleep, straight after having his snack. Tony glanced at him in the rearview mirror, as he took the turn to take them to the airport, smiling at how cute he was when he slept. Not that he wasn’t cute when he was awake as well but when he was asleep he wasn’t getting himself into trouble. Glancing at the clock he saw that they were still a half-hour out before Harley’s plane came in, which was good, he could let Peter sleep a little while longer. He was sure that he wasn’t going to go for his usual post-school nap when he got home, afraid he’d miss something with Harley.
By the time his Dad finally came to get him out of his seat, Peter was pouting in full force, ignoring his Dad’s raised brow. He didn’t want to talk to either of them right now. All he wanted was a cuddle off Papa. Dad and Harley could have all their fun together and ignore Peter somewhere else, Papa would never ignore him.
Bucky barked out a laugh, ran an affectionate hand through Tony’s hair while ignoring Steve’s warning growl. “I’ll get out of your way now. The rest of the team are asking about him so I wouldn’t stay cooped up in here too long or you’ll have a lot more visitors than me. Tony all you have to do is tell me if he’s not treating you right and I’ll sort the punk out for you, okay?”
Peter nodded, trying not to worry about everyone seeing him out and about. He knew that he posted a photo of himself and his Dad right before they left for the airport, he was just hoping that people would be more distracted by that rather than seeing them in person.
“Ah, gotcha. Your order will be here soon Mr Stark.” She smiled once more at the rest and left to hand the order in.
“Sure am darlin’. You and Clint will be able to give out about us together. You start his training yet?” He asked Steve as if Tony weren’t even there.
“Noooo!” He whined, clutching with all his might to Mama. He couldn’t be left with these people. Sure he knew them in the other world, but the only kind of and not enough to be left vulnerable with them. Mr Stark was his only constant between the two worlds and he was not about to leave the safety of those arms. This world was pretty scary, especially because he seemed to be going in between being fine with it and being freaked out by it. He put his face into his new favourite place, his Mama’s neck and started to cry, unable to help the fear that was overtaking everything else.
Tony rolled his eyes. “My heat is over.” He felt the need to point it out so Steve would get the picture. It didn’t seem to work though because all he did was quirk an eyebrow and begin to move his hand up and down Tony’s shaft, sending Tony into a spiral of pleasure.
“That’s a question for me. Bucky has been hiding his classification and we weren’t able to approach him about it until today for reasons I am not able to disclose. He’ll have a nursery but he’ll be sleeping in the room with us for a bit while he adjusts, most likely in a bassinet we have for Peter for when he’s sick.”
Steve sighed and rolled them so that Tony was under him and pushed his hips in closer so that Tony would feel more of his knot. Tony spread his legs as far as he could, groaning at the feel of Steve, he knew what Steve was doing but it felt too good at the moment to try to stop so he could work.
Peter all but skipped over to where they were sitting, making sure to say hello to everyone individually. It was something he always did, not wanting any of them to be upset. “Hi aunt Tasha, hi Uncle Clint, hi Uncle Thor, hi Uncle Bruce, hi Uncle Bucky!” He said, sitting beside Bucky.
“I ask that you don’t ask any questions until I finish because a lot of it is explained as I go.” He looked between Bucky and Peter, waiting to get nods of confirmation off both of them before launching into what he knew.
That would be the biggest test for Tony. Peter Parker for all intents and purposes was Tony’s kid. He went between his aunt’s house and Tony’s, only leaving when Tony had a heat. He was due back tomorrow and the little omega would be mortified at seeing Tony naked and hard. Tony would be the same but he’d have to get over it. Steve knew that when he was taking Tony on as a mate he’d be taking Peter on as his mates child. He had already discussed it with May who was more than happy to raise Peter in a traditional sense, which meant that the poor omega would have to go into chastity until Steve found him a suitable mate. That was a topic for another day though.
Steve stopped the buggy to let Tony undo Peter’s straps and take him out, bouncing him in his arms when Peter dived for his neck.
Tony was happy that Bucky submitted so easily to the physical. He stayed on Tony’s lap but allowed Cho to do her thing. He kept his death grip on Tony the whole time though, showing a small bit of his nervousness in the matter.
“I’m just going to take a small bit of blood off you Clint and then we’ll do the physical.” Bucky held him securely around the waist as Clint watched Bruce with beaded eyes. He hated blood being taken, something Bucky knew from the last time in medical when they tried to take blood and he ended up knocking the doctor out. In his defence, he was trying to hide his classification.
He had been paranoid over it since they were in a crash years ago and the doctors told his Dad that the only thing that saved Peter was his car seat.
“Please, stop – Ouch! Bucky! Okay, okay I won’t lie again! Please!” He squirmed, trying his bed to get out of Bucky’s hold. Bucky didn’t stop though and Clint knew he wouldn’t until he was satisfied. He’d seen it too many times with Tony it always made him roll his eyes when he heard him plead with Bucky. He now realised why that was. Bucky’s flesh hand was solid as it came down on his rear again and again. The only saving grace was he hadn’t pulled his pants down to do it. The spanking went on for what felt like an age and by the end of it Clint was laying limply over his hard thighs, and felt more grounded than he ever had before.
“Sir, may I suggest you move to your room before the symptoms get any worse?” Jarvis’s voice made him jump. He always was less aware at this time.
“Do you think they’ll fall asleep in the car?” Steve asked Tony quietly. He didn’t want either little thinking they were going for a nap. It would be a sure way to keep them awake.
Mama sighed really big and shook his head, moving Peter so he was on his hip instead of clinging to his front like a koala bear, using his now free hand to take the pacifier out of his mouth and place it back into Peter’s. He was kind of relieved that he got it back to be honest. He kinda thought his Mama would figure out how amazing it was and want to keep it for himself.
“Shh, it’s okay Tony. I get why you’re asking. I asked the exact same question. Clint consented to it all. I’m not sure what happened between them but going by Bucky’s texts, they're both over the moon by the mating. I did tell him that you’d be down to see Clint once you were over your heat, so they’re expecting you. Do you want to go now?” Steve knew that Tony wouldn’t be happy unless he saw Clint was safe and unharmed with his own two eyes. Tony popped his head up from where he was hiding it in Steve’s chest.
Mama stopped laughing abruptly when it was pushed into his mouth and looked at Peter, who smiled back innocently.
“Hey, my big boy. Did you have a nice bath?” Peter nodded shyly, opening his mouth for the applesauce which tasted really good, opening it more eagerly for more. He was taking his last bite from Dada when he heard a weird noise coming from Jamie. He and Dada both looked over in time to see Jamie vomit all over Mama who just looked resigned. There was a beat of silence and then Jamie let out a wail. Oh boy.
Steve’s brow creased at his son's blasé words. He hated that Peter just accepted that he'd be teased in school over not having parents. Maybe it wasn’t the best idea to hide that Peter was their son? He’d have to talk to Tony about it later when Peter was asleep. Right now though, he changed the subject and made small talk until they got back to the tower. When it came into view Peter was practically vibrating on his booster. His endless questions beginning.
“He hit his head off the bars and was crying when I went in. Friday alerted me to it because I was closer.” He heard Mr Stark respond. “Can you take a look at his head for me? He was too upset when I got to him for me to take a proper look.”
Okay. So the car seat had 3 points in favour of the car seat. The only thing he had in the con section was that he was not little right this second so he should have to go into the horrible contraption. He just knew once he was buckled in the only way out would be if someone undid the harness for him. His Mama was a genius for a reason.
“How about this? During your heats, you go naked.” Tony opened his mouth to protest but Steve held up a hand to stop him. “Let me finish.” He waited until Tony closed his mouth and nodded. “During your heats, you go naked but the rest of the month, if you really feel uncomfortable, you can wear one of my shirts.”
As much as Peter loved Harley he just wasn’t used to sharing his parents with anyone else, in particular, Tony, which made him jealous.
Natasha poked her head into the living room, “Lunch’s ready.” She said before disappearing back behind the door.
Bucky let him lay over his thighs to catch his breath, rubbing his lower back and not rushing him. When he felt ready Clint wiggled a little bit and let Bucky help him stand up. He felt like a limp noodle after that, all the fight gone from him.
“No, no sweetheart, you have to stay awake or you won’t sleep tonight.” His Daddy bounced him gently in his arms, which made Peter whine and kick his legs in displeasure. “Less of that now little man, you don’t want to go into time out do you?” He admonished gently, and strangely enough, it brought tears to Peter’s eyes. He didn’t even
“Yeah, Where are we?” Peter usually slept for a bit longer and was completely disorientated from it.
He turned the car off and waited a minute until he could see Peter starting to stir. When he was sure that Peter was awake enough he finally got out and went around to unbuckle him.
After Bucky basically broke down Peter was taken out of his nursery and brought back into the living room where the rest of the Avengers were still lounging.
Tony managed a nod while trying to hold back a whine as Steve continued to stroke him into full hardness.
Tony huffed out a breath, “Who are you telling? I’ll never take peeing alone for granted again.” He loved his kids, but he’d instead, they never got sick again.
Cho nodded, “I’ll have to do a slight mental one as well as those. It’s required by law.” Tony sighed, he was hoping to skip them. Bucky was not going to be willing to talk to Cho if the way he was trying his hardest to burrow into Tony’s neck was any indication.
Okay so short chapter I know. The next one is going to be super long though so this is just a set up chapter really. Let me know what you think. Comments and kudos are much appreciated as usual :)
“Come on,” Tony mutters, gripping Steve probably too tight and it’s unrefined, unable to keep a perfect rhythm as he feels himself slipping on the fringes of coordination. “Come on, I’m right here, you’ve got this - ”
“It hurts,” Christina says, fat crocodile tears rolling down her puffy cheeks. “I just wanted to say hi to the puppy.”
“Okay,” Steve says, confused. And then, face going soft - “Okay.” He brings a hand around the back of his knee to join Tony’s.
The kids and their approximate ages, because I know it can't be easy to keep them all straight, and I referenced this endlessly: Manny (17), Zeke (16), Bonnie (16), Beth (15), Elliot (15), Crystal (13), Hannah (12), Lance (11), Ben (11), Alexa (10), Charlie (8), Jackson (7), Serena (7), Christina (6).
“Keep still,” Tony reminds him, and he can’t help but nudge his own cock up against the junction of Steve’s ass and thigh, the friction just barely enough to whet his own desire for the moment. “I don’t want to hurt you.”
“You would have seen him as me,” Tony supplies, and Steve nods earnestly. “He was just a kid, but you would have expected him to fill whatever shoes I’d left behind.”
“But then I saw you,” he forges onward, “and I knew that I could not be in your life. I did not want to impose any expectations on you. In my universe, in my timeline, you died quite unexpectedly. I wasn’t ready for it, and there was a lot I would have liked to formally resolve that I never got the chance to. I didn’t want to inadvertently place any kind of expectations on you.”
“Have fun with that,” she says, nodding towards where Morgan is already outside, the door slamming behind her. “Here I was, hoping she’d take after me and not Tony, and look where that got me.”
She holds him until he stops crying, but it doesn’t do much to quiet his mind. He lets her think that he’s crying for them, for what the universe seems to be denying them. Truthfully, he’s not entirely sure what he’s crying for.
He’s been working his way through the information that Bonnie compiles, scouring the Internet for anyone in the area who could be looking for one of their kids. It’s not particularly difficult work, but it wears on him as he reaches out and is disappointed more often than not.
It works, because over the course of the night, Tony’s proven that he likes to talk. About himself, about his hyper-competent assistant, about the awards ceremony he’d skipped out on in favor of extending the interview past the initially allotted time. Steve’s mind catches on that for a minute, remembering the dark-skinned Colonel and barrel-chested executive. They’d momentarily crossed paths back in the casino, after Tony had won back his hefty chunk of change but before he’d whisked Steve off to a central booth in a cocktail bar with fantastic ambiance where they’d grown overheated enough to have Tony suggesting a dip in the pool within an hour.
“Just a moment,” he mutters to Tony, who nods and sits, immediately politely directing his attention elsewhere.
He doesn’t say what he’s really thinking, which is that he hasn’t heard from Tony since that disastrous phone call, and he’ll put the big important superhero-billionaire on hold for forty-eight hours if he wants to.
“Yeah,” he exhales, relieved that she can fill in the blanks when his own tongue fails him. “I don’t know what to do.”
“Speaking of humble and days in your life,” Tony says, looking sideways at Natasha and trying to gauge whether or not she’s actually planning on falling asleep. He lowers his voice and beckons Steve closer, pleased when he bends his knees to lean in and listen. “That old man of yours is something else. We’ve got to talk about that.”
“I can go,” Steve offers, knowing an out when he sees one and pulling himself together. He reaches out a hand, ready to snag his phone, the pad of his finger hovering just above the end icon. “I’ve gotten enough to work with.”
“Don’t worry,” Tony is quick to say with a single sharp shake of his head. “You’d think I’d have learned by now, huh? Don’t touch Steve Rogers without his permission, never goes well - ”
He casts a look around, trying to remember what the hotel room he’d checked into at Caesar's Palace had looked like, because this is decidedly
“Because Denise and Josie always tell us not to talk to strangers,” Serena says, legs locked around his midsection. “And Beth just let him inside without checking, because Josie’s upstairs and Beth didn’t want to get her.”
“Alright,” he says, making his way down the front steps, immediately diverting off the path and crossing the admittedly well-maintained lawn. “The point is - I don’t know, the point is that I want to support him, and I don’t know how to. Saying goodbye like this is never easy, and I know I’m supposed to let him go through the grieving process however he sees fit, but…”
“Sorry,” she says, normal this time, for normal human ears. Steve wipes his palms on his jeans. “Your friend is here.”
“No,” Steve says, and he musters up a smile that Pepper doesn’t bother to return. “Just...thank him for me, will you? I really appreciate the opportunity.”
“There’s more in the box underneath,” Tony calls, and when Steve looks up, Tony’s definitely staring. He rubs at his chin, comes away with nothing, then shrugs it off and opens up the box underneath. He finds two more chocolate glazed there but makes Alexa and Charlie split one, especially after Crystal informs him that they’ve already had two apiece. Charlie nearly smacks his sister for that.
“I get the analogies,” she cuts him off. “When’s the last time you had any reason to use a shopping cart?”
“But really, I do have to go,” Tony says, and Steve knows the earnest regret there isn’t being faked. “Take care, Steve. And let me know if you ever need anything.”
It’s the right thing to do, no matter how long Steve’s been ready to tap out. He might be dangerously close to his boiling point, is dreadfully suspicious that it’ll be too late for room service nachos by the time he gets back to his hotel, and knows that there’s a selfish part of him that wants to soak up every bit of Tony’s company while he’s got the chance. For all he knows, they may never see each other again; it’s the same perspective he’s held every time they’ve crossed paths before, and it hasn’t worked out too terribly yet.
“Should it not matter that people swooped in and leveled an entire downtown?” Tony’s eyes had met Steve’s momentarily, shadowed and dancing madly. “Regardless of intent, what’s been done has still caused irreparable damage to thousands of households, and that’s without getting into the death toll.”
But Steve’s expression doesn’t falter, even as he gives in and lets Tony grab something that promises to nourish and renew the skin. It goes like that up and down the aisles, including the clothes section where Steve spends an inordinate amount of time comparing packs of underwear.
There’s a minor misunderstanding over the menu at a benefit sit-down dinner, and Steve is too nice to put up a fuss but barely picks at his duck until Tony takes pity on him and swaps for his filet mignon.
Eventually, the clearing of a throat separates them. It’s Rogers, of course it is, holding the shield.
“I know you only drink that crappy coffee because everyone expects you to be as dependent on caffeine as the rest of us,” Denise says, and she’s right that he loads it up with cream and sugar because the taste has never done much for him either. “You don’t have to entertain them, you know. You’ve been through as much as they have.”
