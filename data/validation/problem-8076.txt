Bucky bent down and hauled Tony off him, finally allowing Steve to get up, massaging his dead arm. Between them, they carried Tony into the bedroom and lowered him onto the bed. Steve tried not to look around, or imagine being in that room under different circumstances He tried not to blush.
They could do this. It would work, they would find a way to be together. After all, it was meant to be.
So Steve did, gently but factually, a soldier giving a report. How Tony had killed Osborn, attacked Shield, trashed the city to lure Steve here, and how they had eventually gotten Venom off him. Tony closed his eyes, trying to fight off the nausea, trying to ignore the prickling of his arms, objecting to being exposed to air for the first time in years.
'See that it doesn't. Well, sweetheart, I have to go. I'll pick you up for dinner tomorrow at 8. Wear something slutty.' He winked and left, and Steve couldn't even
'Plus consultants, anaesthetists, the medication, the time I was in hospital recovering, the-'
'Hi,' Steve said. The stranger was only wearing one wrist band, a tie-dye effect one that Steve couldn't immediately decode.
‘Peter, this is really important. You aren’t in trouble, but you need to tell me the truth!’
'Yeah, making
'What's happening? What's that thing?!'
'There's no evidence at this point, but it's possible.'
'No, I'm okay,' he said. 'They were nearly empty anyway. It sucked.'
'We don't have time for this! Peter could be...' He trailed off, unable to finish. 'We need to get in there!'
Tony turned to smile at him. 'No problem. Any friend of Steve's...'
'It's like, super weird,' Peter said. 'I tried getting the cops to evacuate people but, you know, they were all like
it ever came back!'
'Worked out 'okay'?! Everyone you ever loved?! Gee, Steve, that makes me feel so special!'
'Well. I want a job. I've never been idle. I know Fury would never clear me to go on missions and, um, I don't want to do that yet. I don't think I want to do that yet. But there must be something useful I can do around here.'
'Well, they aren't exactly transparent. I doubt they even tell you-'
'Steve, he says he's Howard Stark. As in Stark Industries. His son's worth is estimated at twelve-point-four
Tony cut him off with a kiss, and this time Steve responded with enthusiasm, which made Tony think he'd got the memo. When they finally broke, Steve was smiling.
'Don't,' Bucky said, 'Just doing what I should have done in 1938, and trying to make you happy, whoever you love.' He fixed Tony with a sceptical look, which made Tony's heart flutter, because if he was saying what Tony thought he was saying, then it would mean... Bucky smiled and turned to leave the room again. 'Merry Christmas, Stark. Merry Christmas, Steve.'
'Yes sir.'
He rode up there as fast as his horse could take him, before leaving it to rest and graze at the mine entrance. Unhooking his paraffin lamp from the saddle, Steve headed inside, cautiously calling Pietro's name, not daring to be too loud in case he brought the whole thing down. He was sure Wanda would have already tried it anyway, but reasoned the kid could have been unconscious before and awake now.
talked about it. He had been in his twenties when it had finally occurred to him that his mother's end-of-the-month 'headaches' were probably not headaches at all. At thirteen, Bucky had told him about how ladies got 'monthlies', but Steve hadn't really been sure whether or not to believe him. It had sounded so strange, almost unearthly, the idea that women- all women- were secretly bleeding once a month but going about their business without a word. He'd half-suspected that Bucky was making up stories to gross him out again, except after that he had started to notice women in the drug store asking for 'you-know-whats' or 'supplies' and being discreetly passed packages already in paper bags. He had no idea what was inside the mysterious packets, and neither had Bucky. They'd tried to find out once, Bucky cheekily telling the druggist his Ma had sent him to get her 'you-know-whats' and getting a clip round the ear for his trouble.
Tony did not like it when he wasn't listened to.
Startled, Tony finally took in what he was reading. 'Next most likely location is Osborn's house.'
it could have the whole city in chaos by the end of the day. Never mind the odd plane or building crashing down on them, no-one wanted to re-experience their worst moments. His heart clenched,.
Steve took a deep breath, huffing it out in a short burst. Once more.
, because he knew Peter was happier than he had been possibly in the entirety of his short little life. He would have had dinner with Stark every night for the rest of time if it would keep that happiness going forever. Once was nothing. It was just dinner.
'You gotta be reasonable, Sheriff,' he'd said. 'I'm already gonna be walking with a limp, here. A man can only take so much. It was only a little drunken misdemeanour.'
Peter's voice was getting quieter and quieter, and Tony didn't like the sound of it. He turned away from Steve slightly, putting his back between Cap and the kid.
, he, Tony, had remembered and got ready for their dinner date when
Steve said nothing.
'What the crap have you done now, Rogers?' He demanded. 'You know when people say their best friend would help them hide a body they're usually being metaphorical.'
They were discovered too soon. They hadn't yet worked out a way to regulate the power to flow evenly from the arc reactor to all parts of the armour without burning out in seconds, and in normal circumstances Tony would have ditched it as a power source altogether and replaced it with solar panels or something. There was certainly more than enough sun here, on the rare occasion he got out to see it. Unfortunately, he didn't have any solar panels. Or any decent tools. He was working with a soldering iron he knew for a fact was older than he was. It was a miracle the armour worked at all.
'I think a royal blue for you,' Tony mused. 'Or maroon. Something a bit bolder.'
Bucky groaned, pulling a hand down over his face, his expression changing from anger to resignation. 'It's what you want?' he echoed. 'Steve, you're a damn stubborn idiot.'
'Now you're just making words up.'
'Nattie,' he said, quietly. 'You don't need to do that. Even if we want kids. We could adopt, there are plenty of kids out there needing homes.'
'Anytime,' he said.
It wasn't an invasion of privacy, exactly. It was just that Steve was a perfectionist and Tony... well, if he was honest, Tony was a lovestruck fool. So yes, secretly going through his boyfriend's waste paper basket before he let the bots take it to recycling probably wasn't the
Peter was a good five feet up the side of the wall, holding on with nothing but the tips of his fingers, and the bare soles of his feet.
'I don't mind. It's fine. Bubble tea woke me up.'
sort of smile. He started walking down the stairs again, taking his time.
'We're both well. Mary's still reeling from those awful fishcakes they served yesterday.'
It wasn't a closet, exactly. It looked to be another alcove of the cave they were being held in, only closed off with a thick wooden door, chained and padlocked. Sometimes Tony thought he could hear something moving inside it. He eyed it sceptically, worried there was some poor person trapped inside.
'So,' Natasha said, breaking the silence. 'Was that a proposal?'
'I know. I think it's time I did something to earn it, don't you?'
. He went back to his own drink, slurping hastily, scanning the skyline. Maybe he could see the tower from here. But no, there were too many high rises in this part of the city.
Midnight came too soon.
That said, if Steve and he had been here all alone – but Tony couldn't let his thoughts go any further down that route. Even if he was irrationally convinced that
Because he didn't want to be this Steve. He didn't want to be the version of him where things had gone so wrong. He didn't want a dead Tony. He didn't want any of the other worlds he'd glimpsed either. He wanted his. And that meant he couldn't let himself be diluted down, driven mad. It meant he needed to get himself off the table.
Tony hadn't wanted him to go. Steve could be gone
and the words were changed just in case anyone – horror of horror – thought he was gay. No-one knows about your version. No-one's going to be able to find the recording.'
And the Captain America thing was annoying too. Maybe Tony saw his armour as part of himself, but for Steve Captain America was a role he put on just like he put on the suit. If it was Captain America Tony wanted, of course he was going to be disappointed by plain old Steve Rogers. It wasn't Steve's fault if Tony was ten steps ahead of him. He couldn't help how he felt, and it would be worse if he lied about it.
He woke up already fighting, his body struggling on autopilot against the creatures holding him down, clamping him into heavy restraints. One of the Skrulls smiled nastily.
At first it talked about 'scientific consultancy', dealing with transports, computer systems, tracking devices, threat detection, communications, and all other non-weapon aspects of a shady intelligence organisation. But then he turned the page and saw a single paragraph that, he suspected, was the real reason they had set this up.
Feeling his heart sink, Steve took the proffered papers, knowing before he even looked that they would all be perfectly in order. He hadn't appointed a Deputy since losing Bucky, and didn't plan on doing so.
. He found he was feeling the warm spot on the back of his neck again. This time, it felt like a whispered promise, like someone breathing
'It sounds like you two have a lot to talk about,' he said instead.
A huge thank you as always to everyone who commented! Your remarks keep me going (and make me feel guilty when I haven't written a chapter recently). Apparently my 'big reveal' last time was not as big as I thought, but this chapter should make everything clearer. You all rock my socks :) A special shout out has to go to devillygirl- You got it.... ;)
His dad laughed at the joke, and Peter laughed too, because it felt funny feeling the laugh vibrate in his dad's chest.
Steve had caught up with him shortly after the court broke up, and told him he'd received orders to continue as Tony's 'handler' and await further instructions. And as Steve's place was tiny – if Peter grew any taller they wouldn't both have fitted – all three of them had moved to the tower. Since then, there had been nothing from Shield.
'Ah,' Steve had said, at the pile of snow that had built up two thirds of the way up the door frame. That was all he had said. They were stuck.
'Only Mr Stark is authorised to operate the sound system.'
, and neither of them had managed a solo nappy change yet. They couldn't figure out how you were meant to hold the baby and deal with the diaper with only two hands. Besides, Steve was meant to be on leave for months yet. So Tony had grumbled, but he hadn't really fought. They both knew he didn't want to leave them. They both knew he had to. So Steve grabbed his kit bag and left with Natasha, and Tony watched Clint swing Peter around and make him laugh, and tried not to feel like anything was missing.
Tony did not appreciate this.
'Nope,' Steve frowned. 'I've just been getting groceries on the way here. That bag is full of broccoli and sprouts.'
'He's upstairs, I can
Tony pulled a face. 'I'm not, I'm smarter than most of-'
'Whatever you want, Cap,' he said, his own voice cracking and strangely high pitched. He risked letting go of the counter to pluck at the sleeve of Steve's sweater, testing the ground, ready to move higher and lower, to explore the rest of Steve's body if he was allowed.
'I'm not interested in-'
'You've been doing that since the day he was born. How long?'
to go through that again, Steve. If you get hurt – if you
And Tony's phone started ringing in his back pocket.
'Still fine. You? How's Mary?'
'I shouldn't be doing this,' Barnaby said. 'I'm supposed to be... but I don't care. I just...I need to see you. Please.' He sounded like he might cry. He sounded drunk. Steve was already on his feet and heading out the door.
applied to most of the shop's patrons. The only reason he knew Stark wasn't here already, not recognising him, was that Steve was the only one sitting alone.
'What's wrong with briefs?'
And his brain, his brain was all he had, his brain
Stark glanced at it, then snorted in amusement before going back to his phone. 'He doesn't have a future as an artist, does he?' He laughed.
'What does the bastard look like?' He asked. The stranger looked at him in amusement.
‘Because maybe colours aren’t as important as shape and structure,’ Steve said. ‘Or, you know. I can
Steve couldn't help it, he laughed. Then he took Tony's hand. 'Then our cover is blown. Come on, Bar.'
He found tears were in his eyes and blinked them away, embarrassed. ' ...'s a good song,' he sniffed, trying to cover.
Steve sipped again. He was not a big fan of wine, put off by the vinegary taste, but this didn't have the after burn of some of the cheap stuff. 'But you shut down your company, what, three years ago? Even your money's got to run out eventually.'
Peter skulked away, ducking into an alley at the side of the tower, looking up at it doubtfully. It was still really, really tall, and he needed to be at the top of it.
'Huh, I thought it would be more.'
'An open mind? Tony, what?' But it was too late for the question. Tony had already fled off in the direction of the forge at the back of the house, forgetting, again, to get properly dressed.
because if those muscles were anything to go by the serum had been crap-full of testosterone, so if anything Steve's legs should have looked like rolls of carpet.
'My heartiest congratulations!' Thor boomed as he entered the room, startling the poor Captain. The others were already assembled in the living room of Stark Tower, drinks in hand, but Thor had paused to go and get the ledger, which he had left on a table near the door. With both hands thus free he was able to clap them genially on the shoulders – barely causing the Captain to sag but nearly knocking Stark off the bar stool – and pull them into a tight hug. 'Your wedding will be a day of such celebrations the cries of joy will still be heard a hundred years hence!'
With a last distressed squawk from the bird, the line cut off. Tony went back on comms to Steve and sighed heavily.
Looking uncertain, but nodding anyway, Steve retreated to one of the guest bedrooms. Tony took a deep, wobbling breath, kneading his eyes. He had to do this. He needed a friend right now, if he had any left.
'Jarvis, open a programming terminal,' he said, and in front of him a holographic screen opened up, showing the complex matrix of code that made up Jarvis, along with a complete set of keyboard and input options, ghostly blue in the half-dark of the room. He had no idea what time of day it was, what the date was, he wasn't even sure of the year. He didn't know how long he had been Venom. But he did know that Jarvis had tried to warn him, and that, even when he had been lobotomised, he had found ways to resist, to stretch the strict boundaries of his programming right to the limit, to get Peter inside, to help him get the music going, to help Tony.
In the end, they never reached the playground. They'd just passed through the park gates when a car rolled to a halt on the street behind them, pulling over right on the double yellows, and Stark stepped out.
The voice inside him roared with displeasure as he walked away, giving up his shot of seducing the Captain whilst he was an easy mark. This wasn't how Tony Stark did things. Tony Stark put his wants over everyone else's needs. He did not let the things he wanted pass him by when they were sitting there just waiting to be taken.
'Captain Rogers is currently attending a public relations seminar at Shield. The one you are also supposed to be at.'
and playing with the infant on his lap. A grandchild of either Wanda or Pietro, Steve wasn't entirely sure which. He was ashamed to say that at his age, they all blurred into one.
'Mmmuph,' Tony said, mostly as an excuse to move his lips and tongue over Steve's palm. Well, when an opportunity presented itself... Steve took his hand away and wiped it on his trousers. Charming.
stuck here. Mr Stark wouldn't put up with this kind of thing, Peter was sure. Mr Stark would probably have been able to make some machine out of his blankets and the glass of water on the bedside table.
'I loved the list. No translation needed.'
being pressured into it. I got the feeling he just wanted us to be the ones to pull out rather than him.'
'Steve,' Peter said, 'I'm finished!' He proffered up the cereal bowl. There was still more than half left.
'Barbara?' Steve repeated, mortification uncurling in his gut. He shouldn't have assumed. He should have checked pronouns or something -
'Oh,' Steve said. So they'd been acquainted. He was a friend-of-a-friend. Steve guessed that would explain why Stark had noted his long absence. But the way Tony had said '
For a moment, there was silence. Then, at last, Bucky sighed in defeat. 'Alright. Let's find you a millionaire. And you'd better cancel your haircut.'
'Da,' Peter said, looking him dead in the eye with a serious expression and, oh heck, Tony would actually die if his heart kept swelling like this, 'Da.' He tapped on Steve's knee.
what he should be thinking about at their wedding breakfast.)
Tony threw his hands up in frustration. 'Except I didn't think any of them were perfect!'
They probably weren't bottled. Now that he looked properly, the little bottles seemed to be the deodorants. This did not help very much.
'No, nope, time for you to tap out. We'll find it. You stay here and keep guarding the perimeter.'
'Whatever you say, James.'
take you for their undergraduate programme in the Autumn.'
'Would you mind finishing up here?' Tony asked, and his own voice seemed very far away. 'Thanks.'
'Uh...' Tony looked at the man, and the mop, and had no idea who he was. 'Do I know you?' His voice was rasping, hardly recognisable as his own. Damn, he needed that tea.
'Okay, thanks,' Steve said. 'I'll get juice.' He shook a glass questioningly at Tony, and at his nod took a second one from the cupboard and made his way over to the fridge. This was Tony's chance.
‘Sorry Cap, you can’t argue with the evidence.’
'You make him call you 'Steve'.'
obvious manner. The box of tampons, along with most of the other groceries, crashed to the floor; and with the part of her brain that wasn't completely taken up with Steve, Natasha thought maybe he was right. She was strong. She was strong, and so, so much happier than she would ever have thought possible.
'You're right,' Stark interrupted him. 'It should have been you at school.'
They punched him. He still shook his head. They hit him again.
Except, of course, he wouldn't. Peter getting bigger wasn't going to be a problem. So he smiled, told Peter to put his ever-present phone safely into his coat pocket and set off.
Steve pointed at a vacant seat. 'Sit.'
The town square, when they reached it, was transformed. The market stalls were out, festooned in flags and garlands of summer flowers, piled with trinkets and souvenirs, mingled with the bright colours of carnival games and the odours of a dozen different kinds of food. In the middle, a space for the dancing was marked out by wooden posts, the band up on a scaffolding-type stage at one end, already playing. What made it magical, however, was the electric lighting strung up all around.
'Cider then.'
to marry your son in exchange for the money you promised? In which case, yes, I am, unless you have some even richer friends that are single. How much does she get paid, by the way?' He pointed at the door through to where Ms Potts sat. 'She is a delight; and if you undervalue her she'll definitely stab you through the balls with her shoe.'
Sure, it was annoying and painful, ridiculously impractical in evolutionarily terms, and if it had happened to men medical science would have found the off-switch years ago; but Natasha Stark wasn't going to let it stop her. She took painkillers, took the pill, managed her periods just fine. Work saw her through, or ice-cream where that failed. If she ever found it hard, she didn't let it show. Natasha Stark just got on with life, no matter what punishment her uterus was trying to inflict on her.
Fury, understandably, was not happy.
'I've tried, believe me. Nothing works, he's obsessed with you. I think it's because he likes the science behind the suit. He draws all these pictures...' Steve fumbled in his pocket, sure he had brought one. He found the piece of paper and unfolded it, so Stark could see. On it were some red and yellow shapes, mostly crude rectangles, with a smiley face. Next to them were some blue and red scribbles, loosely arranged in the shape of a person. Beneath it, a staff nurse had written 'Iron Man and his sidekick Super Peter'.
‘He’s my friend!’ Peter sobbed. ‘I wanted to go!’
'Five more years? Not too bad then. I just want to give him a solid foundation, you know? I'm not trying to ruin the kid's life. Besides, the tragic widower angle could work after you-'
‘Hey, buddy,’ Steve said, as normally as he could. ‘Want some toast?’
'Apparently not.' Tony couldn't hide it any more, and he started to laugh. 'Were you trying to
'What? No I'm not.'
'It's a dead celestial,' he said, as if Steve needed reminding. 'I didn't exactly get the blue prints. But sure, keep nagging me Cap, I'm sure I can find you a room near the anus.'
'Yeah, fine, I'll, uh, leave you to it.' And with that, Steve left without even offering to help with the clean up. Something was definitely going on.
felt better, and he was
Instinctually, Tony drew back. 'My flight suit,' he said, guardedly. He didn't want Steve to ask him questions about that. He didn't like it when people asked him about that.
'If you're fine, why are you lying on the couch moaning instead of blowing things up in the lab?'
, according to his dad. Her grandparents were old friends of Jarvis' family, apparently, and so when she had come to do her year abroad she had come to the old gamekeeper cottage in the grounds of the Stark Mansion pretty regularly. Tony had liked her immediately. 'My year is almost over. I don't want you to be lonely when I'm gone.'
the tradition,' he clarified, quickly. 'I want to keep the tradition. I really, really want to. I've wanted to for months. Please. Thanks.'
but now-
'And the candle,' Steve said, pointing to the candle at the top, 'Is to remind us that Jesus is the light of the world.'
'Alright, alright, so what do I call you? Steve? Captain? Captain Rogers? Captain America?'
'Peter?'
'Okay,' Steve said. He was back to sitting on his bed, in paint stained pyjamas, chest heaving with exertion, staring at the painting. It was just an abstract swirl of colours, but -
He opened his eyes. He was lying on the longest couch in his lounge, and on the smaller one, a book in hand, was Steve. He noticed Tony was awake.
He wasn't sleeping. Was avoiding the news. He'd given strict instructions that all flowers and letters of condolence should be redirected, donated, stored. He didn't want to see them, or think about them. Denial was his only hope of functioning. He needed to pretend that Steve was still just away on a mission, or the weight of it would crush him.
'I assure you, it won't go any further.'
On the morning of the third day, they were sitting at the table eating said pancakes, and Tony was trying to mentally map out the limits of Peter's powers – he could stick to stuff and clearly had some sort of super strength. Tony was less sure about Peter's insistence that he now had super speed or 'the power to jump really far' – when Jarvis announced Director Fury was coming to see them.
Soon after, Osborn became head of Oscorp too, and all deals were off. There were more drinks, more parties, more girls, and the satisfaction of his stocks trashing Osborn's. It was never quite enough. Tony tried to ignore it. By then, he was old enough and sort-of mature enough to realise they had just been stupid kids, that if he had been in Norman's position he might not have confessed either, and that a revenge trip wasn't going to do him any good.
'Yay.' The Captain echoed, and Thor could wait no longer. He dashed over to the table and back, bringing the enormous ledger and setting it down with a satisfying thud between them before turning to the appropriate page.
Steve went even redder. 'They aren't a lady's.
'Another boy. He was upstairs.'
He had to kiss him. He had to try. If Barnaby wanted it as badly as he did.
'I think so. He said something about a rift. Though I swear, if this is just about some damn
'I can see that,' Tony found his voice at last. Steve had left a trail of pine needles behind him.
They didn't marry Angela or her
But it had been a dreadful night. After a few moments of hope, it became clear that the pain was not subsiding. Peter was in agony, burning up at his touch, twisting around in his bed, slipping in and out of conciousness – and there had been nothing Steve could do. He'd wanted to get a doctor right away, but Stark had blocked the door.
I hope to get the epilogue up soon - I'm going to try and power through to the end.
'Let him in,' Tony said, trying to finish the particular bit he was working on, knowing Steve would wait for him to be done before saying whatever he wanted to say. It turned out, however, that this wasn't a business call – Steve entered the room silently, smiling at Tony as the mechanic glanced up at him. He was bearing a plate of pasta and a mug of coffee, which probably meant he had missed dinner again. Tony grunted his thanks and directed his attention back to what he was doing before he lost his thread of thought. Steve wouldn't interrupt him just for small talk at times like this; he was good like that. Or maybe he just didn't want to yell over the still-loud music.
'I'm sick of seeing that stupid expression on your face, Steve,' Pepper said, into the silence. 'Just, just, I don't know. Sleep with him or marry him or do whatever you need to do so you can get your brain out of your pants and not go around attacking housekeepers for him.' She turned back to Tony. 'I think I can keep this out of the courts and the papers, but I hope you realise you are putting
They made their way across the front entrance hall and out of the hole where the front door used to be, right into the middle of a ring of black-clad agents, each and every one of them pointing a gun at them. Steve tensed, then relaxed as he recognised the Shield uniform. They must have heard about Osborn, come to help.
Everything would ache, especially his head, which would ache inside and out and feel five stone heavier than it had the last time he had checked. His throat would feel like it had been scratched to ribbons by the hunger clawing its way out of his stomach. He usually had the urgent need for the bathroom, too, but didn't this time- which was not a very good sign. It meant he hadn't taken in enough food or liquids to have any to spare. He realised, suddenly, that despite the heaviness, he also felt light headed, at the same time. He needed food, drink and bed.
'You're allowed a night off. Come on, we'll drink-'
, that this was the only option, they finally got to work on his listing. They were going to put it up on all the websites they could, and hope someone bit. The notes they made were not encouraging.
'I know, but-!'
'...Excuse me?'
'Fine,
Tony turned the card over, not because he needed confirmation, but because his hands needed something to do. Sure enough, on the other side, looking innocently up at him, was the Oscorp logo. Instead of a name and a telephone number, though, there was nothing else but a small insignia, a picture of a demoniacally-twisted face, like some sort of Halloween mask, or a goblin straight out of Christina Rossetti. Tony had no idea what it meant, but it had to be Osborn.
for the millionth time. Steve did not get it, at all. He'd paid some level of attention to the film the first few times, if only so he could talk to Peter about it, but these days he usually watched Peter watching instead; especially if they'd put it on because he was feeling tired or sick or unhappy, trying to see if he was comforted. Today, though, it was all he could do not to sit there staring at his watch instead. When was Stark going to come?
'Tony,' Steve said, softly, stopping his words. And that was all he needed to say. A moment later, he was in Steve's arms and they were fulfilling the tradition very thoroughly indeed.
‘Oof, there he is,’ Stark said, patting Peter’s back and untangling himself. ‘Yeah, okay, hi, that’s enough. Go get dressed, we’re going out.’
'Romanov, what the hell is going on?' He asked. 'I thought you said he was done with Stark. I thought he understood.'
'Nothing. Just that my legs are stronger than my arms.'
Steve hesitated outside the door to the bar, more so he could tell himself he had than out of any sense of indecision. Six months ago he would never even have considered this, but it was not six months ago, and time was running out. This might be the only chance he had.
Tony had no idea what the origins of the insult could have been, but he was delighted with the expression it produced on Osborn's face. Apparently unable to answer, Osborn and his cronies slinked away.
'This,' Stark said, and his voice was no longer his own, an impossibly long, red tongue lolling out from between large, jagged jaws, 'Is going to be fun.'
'You fool,' Tony said. 'Steve. Sweetheart. Darling. Listen to me very carefully. I'll marry Angela, and Angela has a friend for you to marry.'
Smirking now in his lop sided way, Steve rubbed his back, making Tony arch closer to him. 'Oh, can I?'
He was right.
'What?' Tony asked, hunting around for something to mop up with, and eventually settling on a sweaty shirt that had been bundled up in the corner waiting to go in the wash for weeks. Given his distraction, it was Jarvis that answered.
'Nothing,' Steve said, reassuringly. 'I just hope the doctors come back with your results soon.'
'He is! And he'll come save me and get you!'
Days passed, followed by nights in turn. Tony's pallet was nearest the locked closet. Some nights, he dreamt he could hear a voice whispering to him from behind the door. Most nights, he didn't sleep.
'From the changes in your behaviour and personality, sir, I can safely say your actions were from the Venom symbiote, not you.'
'That much,' Barnaby said, pointing further down the hall where Steve could see a few empty bottles; one that had probably been wine, another looked like Vodka, and the last was a half of scotch or something similar.
'Just tell me what's wrong. There's no point trying to hide it if you're hurt.'
or make a joke about him buying the wrong brand of tampons, but her throat seemed to have closed up. She coughed. It didn't help.
He'd only heard of tampons since coming to the future and seeing adverts on the television, which all seemed to feature young, attractive women at parties or on beaches with young, attractive men, other girls, and slogans about empowerment and doing what you needed to do. Steve had assumed that it was about sex. Everything in the future seemed to be about sex and getting as much of it as possible as quickly as possible, and he'd somehow wound up assuming these 'tampons' were some sort of condom for girls. Possibly because, he realised now, the words were sort-of similar.
‘He said it was a secret!’ Peter wailed, his voice rasping as it always did when he tried to raise it. ‘You can’t tell him I told!’
He ruffled Peter's hair, wanting to say more, but knowing there wasn't time. He would just have to make sure he came back. From somewhere down the hill, car alarms started to sound. Steve ran towards them, not looking back, because if he did, he might stop.
Maybe it had been a mistake after all. Stark was clearly insane; and while he seemed to be taking some twisted pleasure out of the constant rejections, Steve had to wonder how long this could go on for. Would Stark get fed up and leave them in peace? Or would he go the other way, and try to get what he wanted by any means necessary? Was he putting Peter at risk by refusing Stark’s advances? He knew he ought to talk to Shield.
'Are you taking it?' Steve asked. He kept rubbing her back. She tried to match her breathing to his rhythm, trying not to let it catch and stumble on the memories of Afghanistan.
'Tony?'
'That's some view,' Steve said, leaning out for a closer look. He'd always fancied trying skydiving, imagined it would feel like flying, but even if they had been able to afford it he would never have passed the medical. So he stepped up onto the bottom rail of the barrier, boosting himself up on tip toes, leaning out as far as he could, feeling the wind on his face, and thought it must be pretty close.
disagree,' Tony replied, finally getting a grip on himself. He hadn't been laughing at Steve, it had just been a laugh of relief and joy. Now, however, he had more pressing feelings to deal with. Now they were no longer charged with emotions and negative connotations, he was able to analyse the underwear more critically. He stretched them out again, looking at Steve through the lace work, who groaned at the sight of them.
No breathing.
'You feeling okay?' He asked, and she nodded, reluctantly moving away. He squeezed her hand.
But sometimes, you didn't want a customised item. You just wanted something basic to do the job, and you couldn't find it. Today was one of those occasions.
'Steve,' Peter said, hesitantly. 'Love you, Steve.'
ago.'
Bucky's face softened slightly, even as he said, 'And you don't have any friends to help you? Like me? How come your pride can take becoming a dime bride but no, asking for help is too much?'
Steve snorted. 'At an event for rich white people in 1943?'
Steve nodded a little cautiously. In the back of his mind he was wondering whether maybe, maybe Barnaby was about to invite him to his apartment. And, damn, Steve wanted to go, except there were two problems. One, most importantly, he was lying about his name and his availability; and he wasn't going to sleep with someone, even Barnaby,
At least they got it right sometimes.
'You mean my
things. Not some girl scout arts and crafts crap.'
While he had been gone, Tony had looked after the domestic crises, and Steve knew Iron Man had been in a few scraps of his own. Somehow, though, Tony had still found time to decorate every inch of the tower; meaning that now they could cuddle up on the couch under a throw and watch the lights on the tree twinkle, just enjoying being back together after so long apart. This, Steve thought, was how Christmas Eve ought to be spent.
'Anything else?' The cashier asked him. He had been nervous, getting served by a lady, thinking she would tell him off for picking up women's things, but she didn't seem to care.
Burying his face in his hands and slumping into a chair Steve groaned, 'This is the most humiliating moment of my life', which was not the confession Tony had expected. Only, as usual, his brain was three steps ahead, and it had reached a conclusion – the only real logical conclusion, if Tony was ignoring his insecurity – that was making warmth spread through him.
‘Why do mine never look any good?’ Tony complained. Steve was barely listening. Tony had told him this was his last day of school before summer break. Tomorrow morning, he would be flying out to spend the vacation with his mother at some European resort and wouldn’t be back until school restarted. Which meant Steve needed to get his number, today. Except every time he tried to ask, he lost his nerve. Besides, Tony hadn’t asked for his either, so maybe he didn’t want it. It couldn’t be shyness; Tony usually oozed confidence. Except when he was holding a handful of mismatched flowers that were already wilting because he’d forgotten to keep the ends wet.
Within quarter of an hour of Mr Stark's arrival on US soil, this publication received an invitation to an urgent press conference. Less than two hours later, Mr Stane announced Mr Stark to a room packed with the hastily assembled media. In many ways, Mr Stark looked unchanged; still impeccably dressed in an Armani suit, his beard and hair neatly groomed and presented. However, having visibly lost weight and with his left arm in a noticeable sling, it was obvious that his ordeal had taken its toll. Nor did Mr Stark present the customary charm we have come to expect from him, forgoing his usual easy-going friendliness in favour of a firm, authoritarian manner as he made his statement without allowing for questions or interruptions until the end.
, after this-'
'Yes,' Barnaby said, looking embarrassed. 'Yeah. My dad got a court order. He's not allowed anywhere near me. It seems to be working, I haven't seen him for months.'
‘Stark? What are you doing here?’
'I'm fucking furious with you,' Tony said, bluntly. 'Open up.'
'I thought I'd lost you,' Steve replied. 'You were the one getting married.'
'I mean it, Tony. Caltech said if you put a toe out of line the agreement is void.' She looked around the lab. 'The facilities should be better for you, anyway. Maybe you'll even find someone over there who has the slightest idea what you're talking about.'
'I bet he will,' Dr Moore smiled, then settled her face into a more neutral position. 'Steve, when you first adopted Peter, you told me that you always wanted me to be straight with you about Peter's health and his condition.'
'Steve,' he said again, not sure where he was going with this. '...Were you going to tell me?'
, but then he realised to his horror that he was wallowing and made an appointment with a counsellor the same day.
'No, don't worry,' Tony said. 'You, uh, finish up. I'm heading out.'
'Why is it always amputation with you?' Tony had demanded, which wasn't really fair. It was true the surgeon had removed Bucky's arm shortly before his death, but the limb had been crushed in a nasty fall when they'd chased an outlaw too near to the edge of a cliff. There had been no saving the arm then, and, Steve had been fairly certain, no saving his now. The feeling in it had already almost gone.
cards-'
'No,' Peter moaned. 'Come on, it goes DO-LA-DA-DA-DA, DA-DA-DEE-DA-DA-DA, it has guitars and-'
'Are you okay?' Steve asked.
'Right.'
He was down the steps and in front of the dumbfounded cops before anyone in the audience realised that he was done. One of them finally stepped forward, cuffed him, probably read him his rights, but the room was too loud with shouted questions and excited reactions for Tony to hear. It was a relief when they shoved him through the backstage door, into the relative quiet.
There were too many types. Different brands, but with all sorts of descriptions. Some of them seemed to have a gauge made of tear drops, but it was not any sort of scale Steve recognised. Some of them were described as 'light' or 'heavy', and they were all different colours and he didn't know if that was significant.
'Why?' Steve said. 'Come on, Stark, I'm begging you.'
either.'
‘I’m going to check on Peter.’
Steve buried his face in his hands. 'Can we please just never speak of this again?' he asked, his voice muffled.
'Yeah, though technically it's bullet resistant. So?'
'No, I was out sick,' Steve replied.
'Only Mr Stark says you're a hack,' Peter continued, because Mr Stark
'Peter. Go back inside.'
'Let me take you through it,' he said, unable to keep the gleam from his eyes.
,’ Steve snapped. ‘Why not, Romanov? Worried Pete will die? Because let’s just say worrying about that is a little redundant.’
That day, he was working in the lab, finally making progress on some new hearing aids for Clint, trying to work out a better way to combine it with their communicators, when Jarvis interrupted him; pulling him out of the zone to tell him that the others – two floors above, with sound proofing in between – had requested he turned the music down.
. Honestly, that wasn't sounding like a bad idea either at the moment.
The rest of that month, Tony spent a fortune on bouquets. Steve found himself watching the clock, waiting for 4PM to roll around, knowing – hoping – that it would bring Tony soon after. He spent longer and longer in the shop every day, talking and laughing with Steve, telling him about some invention or experiment, because science was basically his hobby, and trying to learn the basics of putting together a flower arrangement. It did not go well.
Impatient, he brushed the thought aside. He didn't care about the kid. There was nothing he could do about it, so it wasn't going to become part of his life. The kid was just a means to an end. Of course, Tony had realised the Captain wasn't going to play ball and sleep with him on the first date, but he didn't mind toying with him for a while. It might even make a nice change of pace. He had started having dreams again in the last few days; not necessarily bad dreams, but an unsettling change from the years of empty sleep he had enjoyed. A little challenge in his waking life might be just what he needed. He'd have the Captain in the end.
'Anyway, hers was

is considered. The wealthy family is expected to provide proof of their income and assets, whilst the poor family is permitted to dwell more on the candidate's personal skills and attributes.
Maybe it wasn't the song itself. Maybe it was the lyrics, and the crass commercialism they betrayed. Maybe Steve was just shocked by someone being so demanding. Then again, he seemed to be dealing with it. Just the other day, when Tony had asked him what he wanted for Christmas, he had sighed theatrically and asked for
'Yeah,' Steve said, sitting back down next to him. 'Yeah, it is. I'm really sorry, Tony.'
'Sorry, mom.'
'And you call me old-fashioned.' Steve got to his feet, decisively; a movement Tony had seen too many times to be fooled by. When Steve started taking firm action in a situation like this, it was usually just him trying to take back control of a circumstances he felt were beyond it.
, if you answer one first.'
'Fine, I deserved that.'
run, if he was doing it for Tony – but held himself back. He was already coming on way too strong; there was no need to do it with the force of a hurricane. So he paced instead, waiting, trying to get rid of some of his excess energy.
and that it couldn't wait for something as silly as lunch, but the teacher seemed to read it in his expression, sighing and standing inside. Tony scurried in before he could change his mind.
'Sit down,' Steve said again, laughter in his voice and mischief in his eyes. He could get like that, Tony had discovered, up for practical jokes or teasing as long as nobody got hurt. He'd evidently decided that it would be the height of entertainment to see Tony sticking stuff in an orange in the name of Christmas.
and tapped at the screen a few times. Then he lifted it to show Peter.
'6...5...'
'You are intruding,' Jarvis repeated. 'The wall will become electrified in 10... 9...'
'They're the worst,' Steve said, turning to look back at the view. 'That and adult responsibilities.'
The engagement ring had arrived next, delivered by a man in a suit and the sort of face you couldn't remember if it wasn't right in front of you. Steve had put the black velvet box on top of his dresser, and stared at it, rubbing absently at the cold patch of skin beneath the blemish on the back of his neck. Given that it had only been a couple of days since the meeting between his mother and Stark, and that Stark hadn't been interested in knowing about him as a person, it obviously hadn't been chosen with him in mind. They'd probably bought the ring ages ago, ready to send out to whoever would take it.
'So I just wanted to... check.' Steve finished.
The meeting had gone okay, she'd thought. It had been brief, only twenty minutes or so. Stark had had notes. He had asked a little more about Steve's and their family's medical history, had tersely explained terms – Steve would be expected to be the model trophy husband, basically, faithful and obedient to the family, and in return his debts would be paid, he would be fully provided for and his mother would receive a generous monthly allowance – and then had seemed to consider the conversation closed. He hadn't been at all interested in who Steve was as a person beyond Sarah's (not entirely truthful) assurance that he could 'toe the line'. When Sarah had asked what his son, Tony, was like, Stark had dismissed the question with 'He's fine, he'll do as he's asked'. He had not asked about blemishes, presumably not thinking it was important. Sarah had not liked Howard Stark one bit.
At that, Steve’s brain completely short circuited. As they’d debated, they must have been getting closer and closer together because now Steve could practically
But as soon as they shut the front door, Peter started crying and did not stop until he eventually cried himself into exhaustion and fell asleep. Realistically, sensibly, Steve thought that babies just did that sometimes, and that Peter probably would have been exactly the same if Richard and Mary had been there. But deep down, where he could never voice it aloud, he had known the simple fact was that nobody, however well intentioned, could substitute for loving parents.
Tony swallowed. Right. They weren't supposed to call her by her first name, at least not to her face.
'Can you send him a message? Tell him everything is fine and no-one's hurt, but ask him if he can come home right away.' Tony hoped that they could avoid Steve realising what was happening until he was safely home. It was going to be hard enough for him to hear it from them; it would be worse if he came across the recording unexpectedly.
And Tony suddenly realised just how close they had been standing this whole time. He realised it because in one easy movement Steve turned, putting down an arm either side of Tony, trapping him against the counter. Tony looked up at him, heart thudding. He'd had dreams that had started this way. Steve leaned in toward him, pressing a hand to Tony's cheek. Tony shut his eyes, opening his lips, but the kiss he expected didn't come. Instead, he felt Steve whisper into his ear, so close that he could feel his breath, feel the ghost of lips on his ear and cheek, making his stomach flip and his body shiver.
'No, no,' Stark said, 'Well,
'Thanks for not freaking out,' he said, giving Tony's hand a squeeze. 'I hope it won't bother you when you're sober.'
So Peter did, rolling back and forwards on the bed, and his dad even showed him how to tuck his head in better so it didn't hurt his neck and kept him going straight so he didn't fall off. It was the most fun Peter had had in

This was the best day of Peter's life.

'Nice,' he said, and stood up. 'Oh, this is your birthday present, kid.' He tossed the phone back to Peter. 'Enjoy it. It has
So, fast forward from that day at the hospital, and here he and Steve and Bucky all were, in a cabin in the mountains that Tony had inherited. Bucky was doing much better, but the bustle of Christmas in the city had proved to be somewhat overwhelming, and so they had dropped him off here, literally in the middle of nowhere, to spend the holiday period alone. The idea obviously made Steve uncomfortable – it made Tony uncomfortable too, and the condition of Bucky being allowed to use the house was that the therapist signed off on it first – but Bucky had seemed to be looking forward to a peaceful Christmas on his own in the beautiful scenery of the mountains.
Steve looked at him, his face set in a too-neutral expression of polite confusion. His eyes gave him away, still red, redder even than when his Ma had died. He looked like he hadn't slept since the war.
‘Ten?’ Steve asked, taking a bite of his own food in the hope of encouraging Peter to do the same. If past experience was anything to go by, though, Peter would be so distracted by whatever they were talking about that the toast would be stone cold by the time he got round to it.
of this. If things had been different, they – but things weren't different. They weren't.
‘I kind of lied to my mom,’ he said, wincing. ‘And I’m pretty sure she’s going to have found out by the time I get home.’
'I love you,' he said, and kissed her. He pulled away, just enough to speak. 'Will you marry me?'
'Thor,' The Captain began, made awkward by his generosity.
This addition to the note probably went some way to explain why Tony Stark was currently not in his kitchen, nor anywhere else in Stark Tower. He was, in fact, out in the Iron Man suit, busily breaking into a secure research facility most people had no idea belonged to Norman Osborn.
, he obviously didn't feel the same about Steve as Steve felt about him.
He smirked, and that smirk was the last thing Tony would remember clearly for some time.
Stark shrugged. 'It's honest.'
‘Uncontrollable.’
be telling about this. Otherwise, the job was great. The old couple that owned and ran the place, Mr and Mrs Flynn, were friends of his mother’s, and had approached Steve to see if he wanted the job for a few months. They knew all about his health problems and were quite happy to let him sit down while he worked, which was more than could be said for every other store Steve had tried to work at. He usually lasted about two days before his traitorous joints locked up so much he couldn’t even get out of bed. They were fine with him using his inhaler, even in front of customers, or stepping out for air if the pollens and the scents got too much. The colour blindness was more of a problem, but they had given him a chance anyway, and Steve had soon got used to identifying flowers and plants by their shape and scent, even if they weren’t the same colour in his eyes as they apparently were in everyone else’s. Steve had gotten pretty good at arranging bouquets, their beauty in the shape and sculpture and arrangement of them. By Steve’s second week, Mr Flynn had looked at one of his bouquets and laughed, saying there was nothing more they could teach him.
(On the morning of the wedding, Steve would add Venus fly traps as an accent to Tony’s buttonhole and bouquet, as a last minute surprise. He would imagine Tony’s face when he saw them, and smile.)
'This little feud is going to get the both of you into serious trouble someday,' Meredith said. 'You know, he's the next smartest in this school after you.'
Peter loaded his spoon up as high as he could – he was not the sort of child who would have tried to cunningly pass a small mouthful off as a big one – and shoved it into his mouth. Steve forced his face to remain neutral so Peter wouldn't see him thinking
When Steve finally returned to school, there was a welcoming committee waiting by his locker. As soon as they saw him, his friends started whooping and cheering, stamping their feet, and generally making as much of a scene as they possibly could. Grinning despite himself, Steve slid his way between them towards his locker, his cheeks turning pink.
all Bucky's, only a few had his chin or Clara's eyes, but what was he meant to do? Leave a kid out on the street after their Pa didn't come home from the war and their had Ma passed; or let them go into care somewhere in a neighbourhood where nobody knew them? Or let them starve for food or love in a house somewhere where they weren't wanted? Not on his watch. The Barnes would take in anyone who needed to be taken in, end of discussion. Even if the neighbours complained of the noise, and made nasty comments about him and his wife just because she was the one going out getting a wage, or worse, made veiled remarks about the kids, just because they had the black ones and the white ones living together as family. Shock! Horror! Scandal! Ugh. Bucky had bigger things to worry about, especially at this time of day. He'd managed to get them all out into the front yard, nearly to the gate, but Katherine's braids just wouldn't go
. Unfortunately, Steve struggled to tell certain shades apart, and he had been the one to refill the containers with fresh blooms that morning. Which was, admittedly, a flaw in the plan. ‘Sorry, I’ll just…’
Peggy cocked her head, thinking. 'Tall, yes. Curvaceous, no. Legs, not particularly noticeable. Brunette with a cocksure grin and plenty of swagger, laughing eyes...'
'I'm sorry,' Steve said, putting his key into the lock but not turning it yet. 'I wasn't expecting anyone.'
And that was it. They shook hands again and Steve left, thinking that getting cleared to leave would be easier than he had thought.
He made it all the way to the tower without anyone stopping him. He ran up the steps and tugged desperately on the door, sure his dad and Mr Stark had to be inside, but the doors were locked. Despite all his new strength, he couldn't make them budge even a little. Frustrated, he took a few steps back, craning his neck to try and see another way in. When Mr Stark had told him about the tower, he'd said he lived right at the top. Maybe he'd left a window open or something. But Peter couldn't even see the top floors, the tower was so tall. Not sure what else to do, Peter went back to the doors and wrenched as hard as he could.
Bucky hissed through his teeth. 'You didn't tell me. How much?'
So he turned his face away from the painting and into his mother's shoulder as if he was seven years old, and he nodded.
He didn't know at the time how true it was. Just over a week later, she would introduce him to her friends, including Steve Rogers; a road which would lead Tony steadily to the best and worst days of his life.
'Got no plans to,' Tony said, letting Steve go anyway so they could move in to give their own hugs and congratulations. Tony had booked them all into a fancy restaurant for dinner, but Steve had absolutely no intention of going. He eyed Tony hungrily. He preferred his own plans for celebrating.
'How did you get it? Steve demanded. 'It wasn't supposed to be recorded.'
'Never,' Tony said. 'Sorry, Cap, but no. I'm going to treasure it the rest of my life.'
'Stand back from the door, please,' the officer said. Tony stepped away.
The practice of Charity Marriage was very common for several centuries, believed to account for around 40% of marriages in the US at its peak. Charity Marriages became a symbol of status, desirable for the aspiring middle classes, who would sometimes arrange marriages with people only slightly less well off than themselves. The practice began to decline soon after the end of the

Sometimes, the natives of the planet – humans – came to the cave and tried to kill it, to hurt it, to cast it out with fire and knives and shouts. The creature did not like that. The creature defended itself. The creature killed them. And because of the way it killed them, with a short, sharp shock like a poisonous sting that didn't leave a single mark, the locals had started calling it
'Please.
Steve almost felt like sighing. He started to walk forward. 'You know,' he said, conversationally, 'I feel like I'm always coming across monsters who claim to be the evil-inside-man. But I fought the Nazis. I've seen the evil in mankind, and it isn't you.'
The bastard knew exactly what he was doing. Tony had been turned on ever since he had heard Steve singing, and now Steve was making his voice all husky and breathy and
Steve's breath hitched. They'd talked about kids, and she knew he wanted them, but it was always in a playful some-day-far-away sense. Except she couldn't help thinking maybe someday was now.
Bewildered, Steve checked his coat pockets. They were deep and as he dug into them he discovered the paper shoved into the bottom that he had assumed was a receipt when his fingers brushed over it earlier was in fact a small bag. He pulled it out and opened it to find it was in fact full of sugar cubes. He felt his jaw drop open slightly.
She let him go. Sometimes Steve just needed space.
'It's only the three months where you were sick,' Natasha said. 'I bet the other months are still in there somewhere, it'll come back to you.'
A tread came on the stairs and his head whipped up in hope, but it was only Ms Potts, surveying him as she came back.
. Steve ran to the table, removed the tube, and set about undoing the straps. A moment later, Stark came and began bandaging Peter's wrist, impossibly gently. The extra tentacles had gone now, and somehow, there wasn't a spot of blood on him.
Tony groaned. 'If we must.'
, apparently he was so far ahead of everyone else there a lot of his time was self-study – the thought made Steve realise how late he was to class, and how much make up work he was going to have to do, and his feet itched to leave. So he smiled and nodded to Stark, and would have walked away if he could, but Stark was still speaking to him.
Then the darkness swallowed him, too.
he had survived. The
'You are not authorised to enter,' the door said, politely. 'Please desist or action will be taken.'
A moment later, the young man was quietly and efficiently hustled outside by two of the wait staff who looked more like hired goons. His phone was left abandoned on the table. Nobody touched it. Stark resumed his leg stroking until Steve 'accidentally' kicked him in the shin. Stark laughed.
And then there was Afghanistan, and the end of everything.
'Wait, can we back up here?' Bruce asked, walking over to them with a smile breaking out on his face. 'That was a
Thor was very proud of his ledger and felt the others would surely be very impressed. Particularly as it would save Stark and the Captain so much time in planning their nuptials, and give them more time to engage in what Thor was certain would be very lively and creative lovemaking. The ledger was full of every kind of wedding, but the one he had planned for them was particularly well-developed and, Thor was confident, perfect.
It hadn't taken them long to get to Barnaby's office building, which turned out to be just a few blocks from the diner, in the business district in the heart of town. The building was dark when they got there, tall and shadowy, but Barnaby manage to unlock it and get them in. They had made their way through the wide lobby, shoes echoing on the immaculate marble floor, Barnaby taking Steve's hand to guide him through the gloom, holding it, holding it, holding it as they got into the lift and he punched in the request for the top floor. The doors had opened into what looked like a cafeteria space, in a kind of glass conservatory, but Barnaby was still holding his hand and had led Steve right through and out of some sliding French doors. He had released Steve only then, leaving Steve to step forward alone and look around.
From where Steve was, it didn't look like there were any signs of life. But the only way to find out was to go closer.
'You trust me, don't you?' He asked, gently, pulling Barnaby close, feeling rather than seeing his nod. 'Arrange another meeting. Please. Promise me.'
'What is this?' Steve asked.
Peter smiled gummily at him and Tony took the opportunity to shove the spoon in.
Snorting with laughter through his wheezes, Steve couldn't speak, just buried his face in Tony's shoulder again. He didn't ever want to move, but Tony pulled away a little, looking at him with concern.
For a moment, Peter thought the countdown had stopped. The gap certainly seemed longer before the computerised voice said, '4... 3...'
Steve takes the first step, cupping Tony's jaw and pulling him up into a real kiss. Tony's arms slide up around his neck, so really what's Steve to do other then what he does. He picks Tony up, clean right off the floor and carries him to the window. Tony's legs wrap naturally around his waist, but he's clearly entirely comfortable with the new position given the way he licks into Steve's mouth. He was beautiful, he really was. Like the stars in the sky or waves on a beach.
"Hey, Steve," Becca says, stopping next to them.
"I.. she... she found something." Steve tangles their fingers together. "It's... you should... ok, if I have video evidence of bad news, would you rather hear it, or watch the video first?"
"It's about him. And Bucky." She holds out her tablet, tapping at it, then setting it on his lap. "The Winter Soldier killed his parents, Steve. I feel like that should come from you."
There had to have been a reason that he hadn't done this sooner. Something right on the edge of Steve's fogged up mind.
Steve leans into the pull, his lips parting. "I'm yours. You know that."
"Only a few minutes. If you want to see me do the renegade that bad, I could just do it for you," he pouts, looking over at Steve with wide brown eyes while they're stopped at a red.
"Certainly, sir." The robot in the ceiling had taken a while to get used to, but with useful features like that, what wasn't to love? The lights dim before going black, basking them in a darkness, broken by the streetlights down far below.
Steve opens his eyes, nodding his head shakily. Tony caresses his jaw gently, running his hands down to shoulders, then to his arms, pulling them out of where they were locked together. Once that is relieved of him, he sags backward against the wall.
"Well, Amy, there's our answer," one of the women from earlier says, the screen panning out back to them. The microwave starts in the background. "So. Thoughts?"
"I know that. But you never found his body. He's still alive."
"Tony," Steve interrupts, a flush blooming on Tony's cheeks.
Steve breaths in and out shakily. He looks like shit, probably worse than Tony has ever seen him, sweat occupying every spare inch of skin. "You good?"
Steve looks down at his spaghetti, feeling a blush creep up his cheeks. "Would you like to get dinner?"
"How can I. You're taking all the stupid with you," his voice is cold, but he doesn't resist when Steve pulls him in for a hug. "I'm gonna miss ya, Buddy."
If only he could get his aching heart on board with the new plan.
A shiver goes up Nat's spine, and Steve rubs her back gently. "Right. Well, long story short, we found it. Nat sacrificed herself to it and then I sacrificed the stone to get her back. Apparently, it's okay with overstepping, because it gave her powers. Now there are shadow people. Don't know what that's about."
"Anything for my beloved boss. Even if I find it hard to believe that neither you or Bucky recognized the Tony Stark."
"Are you fucking kidding? I'm gonna punch that bitch out myself, and I don't even know the story." That was one of his favorite things about Tony, he was fiercely protective of anyone and everyone, especially people he liked.
"Sorry, wait. You thought I was getting married?" Tony interrupts and Steve nods like a madman.
Bucky follows suit, and they sit like that until he looks up at Steve, to wrap his arms around his neck. "Thank you for coming."
"Ten fifteen what?" Steve asks, furrowing his brow at Tony.
"I love you Tony. If this works.. I love you." Then it's Steve racing towards the cliffs edge and Tony left behind crying. Tony starts after him, but stops at the edge, staring down at his falling figure. Whatever Steve was going to try, he had to let it happen.
"I know."
"Sure? I mean—Bucky?"
"I can ask J to turn up the AC if you need Tony," Rhodey says, earning a stuck out tongue, because apparently Steve was dating a 2nd grader.
touché
"It wasn't him," Steve pleads, sitting forward, ignoring the strain in his sore muscles and the stitches. "Tony."
Sam sits back down, adjusting his tie. "Well, I guess that's... okay? Tony's going to take care of it?"
"That's not very nice... even if it is true," Tony says walking up next to him. He sighs. "I did assume that. I've never made a cake before, but I don't think that's the right texture." It was rather watery.
And boy does Howard deliver. By some miracle, he finds the same broadcast Steve had woken up to all those years ago (from now?), and they get Nat into a just questionable enough 40's nurse outfit and stick the thawed Captain America in a 40's hospital room. All that's left now is to wait for him to wake up. Nat taps her foot, standing next to him and watching the footage through the tiny embedded camera focused on him. Bucky was sitting deadly still on a cushioned velvet chair, waiting with a nervous silence.
"And what're you gonna do bout it?" He had challenges back, trying to wrestle out of Bucky's grip.
This was the actual painful part though. All that had just been a precursor to having to set the bone. One handed. Alone. In a Hydra jet. Tony leans back against the floor, staring up at the ceiling, before directing his attention to his arm. Okay. He could do this. Yeah.
A month passes before they get a call. Steve answers the phone because he was closer; he doesn't recognize the voice on the other end of the line, but it implores him to meet it at an address he quickly scrawls down along with Natasha. Then the other end of the line is dead, hung up before he could ask a single question. When Nat and Steve leave, Tony is sitting in the front room, his Captain America action figure in his mouth. They take Howard's cheapest car up to the specified location, which turns out to be a Waffle House, the W flickering at them as they pull up. "Well darling, here we go." Steve says, helping her out of the car. They enter the Waffle House, and somehow Natasha instantly identifies the person they are supposed to be meeting with. Must be a spy thing? She slides into the booth across from him, allowing Steve the space to sit next to her. "Anyone sitting here."
Steve considers her and the question. "I love Tony, and I don't know that I ever won't, but... I'm alright. He's gone, but he's right here, and he's going to be great, so I guess I'm fine."
"Mhm." He was admittedly very pretty like this, his blonde lashes fluttering softly over his rosy cheeks. "My best friend." Yeah, Tony was way too old for this.
Tony perks up, walking back over to Steve. "Like I don't have enough reasons, I mean, really." He reaches out and squeezes Steve's arm.
"Gee, was it my birthday today?" Steve teases, looking around at the penthouse, covered with red white and blue decorations. Tony pushes him out of the elevator and towards the crowd, made up of all of his friends and a few of Tony's. "Wait, who's working the bakery?"
"Well, I'd be honored."
If there was ever a doubt in Steve's mind, let it be settled that he would have no trouble falling in love with Tony Stark. None at all. "Do you wanna sit down, Bucky," Tony asks, leading the willing man towards the fountain. Steve lets himself have one moment to watch them walk—his best friend and his.. boyfriend?—nothing but a gentle sort of understanding between them. Then he starts after them, swinging around on Bucky's other side, resting a gentle hand where his prosthetic met his shoulder. "So, I don't think I've seen Sam before, you wanna tell me about him?"
"I'm sorry I—I don't know what that was," Steve says, leaning back as not to crowd her. He feels his cheeks turning bright pink with embarrassment. Seriously, what was he thinking.
If he had never left, he might be happier, but he also knew that Sam would've had his ass, and rightfully so. Morning shifts were always the worst.
"No, you probably don't need me here. But I can be here anyway, alright. Can you tell me what's wrong, pal?" Steve sits in Clint's recently vacated seat, leaning backwards.
Bucky looks over at him inquisitively. "This is for Steve?" Tony nods. "I can help, if you want."
"You're the face of the company, not me. Clint will lend you a tux." She says quickly. Clint yells something he can hear through the phone and Nat mutters something angry back at him that causes him to quiet down. "Perfect, it's decided. Bye Steve."
Dinner goes on without a hitch, that is, until Peggy suggests they do this again while she was still in town.
He drifts away, sparing Steve a momentary glare. The woman on his arm gives Steve a once over and a smile before following after the old man. Natasha pinches his hand hard and he winces. He already knows what it's about, but he's not that sorry. "Vanya, do you want to go find some food?"
She shrugs. "Fine." Her eyes dart over to Steve's doorway and light up. "Happy birthday, Steve!"
Steve rubs his back. "You shouldn't have to thank me, Tony. That's not why I'm with you." Tony nods again, and it's beyond words, because Steve can understand exactly what he meant. Exactly why Tony had said what he said so quietly.
"That's true. Nothing is definite until we get an official statement from Captain Rogers himself."
"He.. um.. he ran away last night. I mean—I know where he is, I called Ned's mom to check, but he um.. he definitely left."
"Good. I wouldn't want to have chased you off so soon," he teases, taking another bite slowly. His eyes slip shut in a satisfied look. Seems like Steve would just have to learn to make tiramisu.
"Strawberry with gold and coral fondant flowers. Kinda like that one in the case." He points to the purple flowered display cake, currently in a darkened display case.
God Tony really did never shut up.
"I know.." Tony cuddles closer into his side. "Does anyone want to watch shitty old movies?" He asks, once the hubbub dies down.
It had been five months since Steve and Tony's first official date almost exactly, which meant it was also five months since Sam and Bucky were engaged. Peter was coming as Tony's +1, and really it was hardly even weird because Tony had received his own invitation. After all, Tony was the one who fitted Bucky with a brand new prosthetic arm that worked a thousand times better than what he had been using before. Hell, Bucky had even started cooking (the first time had been a disaster, he was picking dough out of the grooves for a week, so now he wore plastic gloves). "Peter, you should be more polite," Tony scolds, not detaching himself from around Steve whatsoever. He had been on a business trip for the past week and a half, so this was the first time they had seen each other in person for a long time.
"I can't get drunk," he says staring blankly at the drink in his hand.
"Vic's not here, is he?" Tony walks into the kitchen, grabbing the bagels as he passes.
Realization dawns on Tony and he puts his head in his hands. "I knew that."
"Steve." Tony says once. But Steve looks back at him with clarity in his own eyes.
"Tony. You're going to be ok. We're going to be okay." She sets her hand on Tony's shoulder and Strange steps out of a portal with Peter. "Friday."
"That's sweet Vic," Pepper says with a smile.
But far be it from Tony to deny Steve anything he wanted. Steve knew that too, that Tony would understand, and that he would get whatever he asked for. He changes his demeanor minutely back to the jealous boyfriend, upset with the transgression. "You may try to prove it," Tony pretends to concede, pulling Steve just a little closer by his tie. "If you think you can."
She jumps out of her skin, pausing it. "Fuck. Hi.. hey Tony. Sorry. I thought you were Steve." Tony lets out a good natured laugh at her expense.
"Oh. Cool." She looks at Steve with scrutiny. "Why are you... uh, tiny?"
The bride arrives five minutes later on the dot, and indeed it looks like she's floating on a cloud. That thing had to weigh a thousand pounds in tulle alone. However, the confusing part about how she arrives was that she arrived with a man who was certainly not Tony on her arm. More confusing then that, is when they kiss and the crowd begins to cheer. Steve looks back to where Tony was and sees him clapping too.
"Have fun weirdo." He walks back out and nearly runs right into a woman it takes him a moment to recognize. She's wearing a lavender dress though, so he's sure she's in the wedding party. "Oh! Sorry."
"You're not asking." His voice has a finality to it that Steve knows means there was no talking him out of the obscene number. Tony kisses him on the cheek. "Now do you wanna get out of here or what?" Tony runs Steve's suit jacket between his fingers with a suggestive glint in his beautiful eyes.
Tony looks over at him and smiles. Sure, they were both worse for wear, but they were alive and together, against all the odds. Against the universe itself. Now, they might actually be able to settle down somewhere. Together. Alive. "You can sleep too." Tony says, looking back at the, indeed, mostly asleep group of teens, and even Happy.
"Um..." Steve blinks. "We can just have leftovers. It is his day off." He didn't know what he had expected, but it wasn't this. He had suspected Tony to mop up the mess, then take off, back to wherever he had been before coming back to the tower.
"My my, is the great Tony Stark propositioning me?" Steve says, letting his control melt away as he sets the half finished glass on the counter and uses his how free hand to grip Tony's thigh.
He blinks, looking back at Tony, and then to Steve again, nerves obviously taking over. With every second of stretched silence, Steve could feel Tony's panic increasing, and by god Peter better say something soon. "Thanks. I'm.... no, I'm not in trouble." Something sad lurks behind his eyes. "I'll call her and tell her not to wait up." Peter retreats to his room quickly, before Tony can pull himself together to say anything.
She laughs, clinking their bottles together. "Weak ass American."
"Oh yeah! Are you saying Tony flew all the way back to New York just to take care of Steve Rogers. Gosh, that's so sweet."
Tony's eyes snap open and he rubs away the swelling tears, looking at the figure of a nervous Peter Parker. "Nothin to worry about Pete," he says, displaying an award winning press smile.
She giggles, setting a hand over her mouth. "So, no Ms. Rogers? I take it? "
Bucky nods, looking a bit bewildered. "C'mon terminator, I had my robots clear out a floor for you," Tony says, leading Bucky around them. Steve's gut twists. He didn't know why, but it felt like loosing both of them.
Howard opens the other door, and Steve steps out of his and into hers, picking her up off the floor. The last time he had had to carry her, she had been inches from death on a mission gone far too wrong. Fury had sent him in to extract her and Clint; Clint has been conscious enough to walk, but in no state to carry his partner, bleeding out on the prison floor by the time Steve arrived. If he had arrived minutes later, she would've been dead, no matter how much Clint mustered himself to do. The situation had made so much more sense after the fall of SHEILD; the two of them had been sent directly into an ambush where they had been pushed to the brink of death and locked in a cage not unlike animals. Steve had only been sent to check if they were okay because Fury was a paranoid bastard and expected nothing less than constant updates. He couldn't complain much though, Clint and Nat were alive today because of it.
"What?"
Tony smirks, bracing one hand on the wall, using the other to grip Steve's floppy blond hair. "Good boy," he says, before bottoming out in Steve's mouth and holding himself there, letting Steve gag around him he savors the feeling of the slick skin of Steve's throat constricting around him tightly. "Steve," Tony gasps as he begins to thrust unwaveringly, feeling Steve struggle for air around his cock, spit dribbling onto his chin. Steve makes an odd assortment of noises, everywhere between sobs and moans as Tony fucks him. His arms don't move an inch even when the blindfold over his eyes turns dark with tears and he backs himself up against the tiled wall, truly a mess like this. "You need to be—ah—fucked like this every day? Will this stop you... from flirting with anything that..... fuck.. moves." Tony says, the words coming out staggering as he looses himself.
"Yes. I think he's blocked me. How much space is too much?" Tony sniffles, swallowing loudly.
Tony shrugs, a breeze blowing through his soft brown hair. "You don't have to decide now. It's just an offer. Even if you just want the current prosthetics."
"Please," Tony says, peeking up at the mention of Peter. It was good to know he was ok, and apparently hitting it off with Princess Shuri. He would have to remember to tease Peter about that later. She walks away, leaving Tony alone with his thoughts for only a few minutes before Steve bursts back in, also missing an arm. Tony blinks, before he feels an arm squeezing tightly around his neck and the weight of heavy breath against his neck. "Steve."
Steve jr pulls away, keeping a hand on the metal arm. His eyes find it. "That's new. And then.. me with long hair."
"—but we'll go," he makes sure to layer on his fake Russian accent, almost positive that that is why they were being kicked out. 70's America wasn't exactly the most receptive to Russians.
"Goodnight Tony."
He nods, looking back up at Steve after a moment with a dazzling smile that makes his heart do backflips. "Do you do weddings?" Suddenly, Steve feels like he's rammed himself headfirst into a brick wall. He didn't see a ring, but then again usually the person that proposes doesn't get a ring. Of course. This was exactly his luck.
"Thank you, sassmaster3000," Steve says, flipping him off, but going to take care of the playmates and crumbs left at table 3.
Behind him, Howard shifts. "Um, cap, I don't know if you... remember, but Barnes is long gone."
Peggy inhales sharply. "I'm sorry, that's very interesting, but how did you live until 2023? You died. I was there."
"I didn't hate it!"
He would like to think that the look on Tony's face is hurt, but that was surely his twisted mind playing tricks on him. "Can I have a cake box?" He asks quietly, stepping away from the counter. Steve sets the box on the counter, then ducks into the back room, trying to calm his beating heart. He was a terrible person. Steve was a terrible person. He kissed a man who was trying to buy his wedding cake. Never in his life, would he have thought himself capable of something so terrible. Something so inherently wrong. When he gets himself back under control and peeks around the door he finds nobody, only an empty bakery with several sample cakes abandoned at an empty booth. He picks up the slip of paper left on the counter, finding a check for... no, there was no way that was right. Three thousand dollars? Three thousand dollars. What the hell?
"It's kinda niche, yes."
But the smile on Tony's face when he looks up at Steve is enough to eradicate his common sense. "That would be nice. Thank you so much." Steve goes back around the counter, trying to ignore the man who was ruining his composure. He is, however, pretty fucking surprised when he turns to find Tony leaning across the counter next to the cash register, a plate of raspberry chocolate cake in his hand. "So where'd you learn to bake like this," he says, taking a large bite.
"You're in a recovery room in New York," she fiddles with the leaf of the potted plant, feigning nervousness.
"So.. your body will combust in the way that Lady Jane's would've?" Thor asks, looking very suddenly concerned for his friend.
The judging and concern increase exponentially. "Not.. really. Not unless you give me a reason. Sam and I are having a date night, remember."
"Steve," Pepper says with a smile, her eyes twinkling. "This cake better not be strawberry," she teases.
Tony takes a deep breath in, clenching his teeth. "It's been 70 years. Neither do you." He turns to grab his jacket from where he had draped it on a chair. "I'm going to get some air."
Pepper laughs, breaking a tension that maybe wasn't there in the first place. "That certainly sounds like a story."
It's Nat who's standing next to Steve when they finally all get up to the front of the church, Sam and Bucky standing in the middle, gazing into each others eyes. Sam was wearing lavender, and Bucky was wearing white, and the balloons cast the perfect shadows over the whole crowd as the sun continued to set. They kiss and everyone cheers, and Steve wouldn't admit to crying a little even in front of a court.
"You can't cook for shit Tony," Bruce says, patting his back. There's a murmuring if agreement from Pepper and Rhodey.
He takes it between two deft fingers and salutes to Steve with the card. "Pleasure doing business with you sir, I'm sure we'll meet again." Even though it wasn't exactly ideal circumstances (of course it wasn't, he was engaged), Steve can't help but feel excited by that promise. The stranger tucks the card in his front pocket and turns away, flipping his sunglasses back down out of his floppy brown hair.
Sam was a good employee and a better friend. One of the perks of being a young business owner is that you can straight up hire your friends, or in Sam's case, befriend your employees. Bucky had come right out of high school and he left for the Army. He returned 5 years later with only one arm and a haunted look in his eyes. He moved to New York to stay with Steve, who had just been starting his business at that point. Bucky hadn't been the same man he was when he left. He was quieter at first, and he would sometimes wake up screaming. Once Steve made the mistake of waking him up in the middle of a nightmare and ended up with a knife to his throat before either of them knew what was happening. After that, Steve put Bucky to work in the shop. There was less time to dwell in the terrible things you did if you were painting walls. Bucky had stayed on, and even though he wasn't great in the kitchen, he could do the front work just fine with one arm.
"Ridiculous," Nat says, standing up and grabbing her purse harshly, creasing the leather. "Yelp will be—" she falters, her mouth snapping shut. "Come on Vanya." She turns, her hair fanning around her dramatically, her cup vacated on the table. He grabs both cups, sliding out of the booth and following after her. Once they're in the safety of the car, Nat begins to laugh, taking her cup from Steve, who also laughs. "God, that was the easiest time I've ever had getting away from a bug."
Nine months into their infiltration, Captain America is the news on everyone's mind. More importantly, that Howard Stark had found him, and sent a team to the Arctic to explore the fallen Valkyrie before removing what was believed to be his remains from where they were frozen. Clearly though, that was a front presented by Howard to explain why he wasn't going to thaw him right away. To Steve and Nat, it was a poorly veiled call for them to reach out and tell him what to do, how to explain all this to Steve.
"The one and only." Natasha says. It's obvious to Steve that she's slipped behind a mask, but nobody else seems to notice.
"Kinky," Bucky says. "But we still have a real problem here."
He keeps his press smile on his face just in case. "How can I help you?"
Morgan takes Peppers hand, and Pepper squeezes it. "Let's head inside." Steve gets the door for them, and mother and daughter walk in, Pepper sitting on the couch next to Happy and Morgan situating herself on Pepper's lap. Steve goes to stand behind them, next to Thor, who was also apparently here. Pepper pushes something on a remote, and Tony appears, sitting backwards in a chair. Rhodey shifts in his seat, his hand clenching the arm of his chair. Steve remains as still as a block of wood, the only sign of agitation a tightening of his jaw.
"You did good today," she says quietly but out loud.
Tony shrugs with a smile. "I don't know, his phone is connected to my servers, so it's possible. I mean, I'm sure I could stop him now that I know it's something he can do."
"I mean, I don't think we can exactly jump to conclusions here."
Tony turns the TV off, and Steve can feel his intense eyes searching over his face. "You're not resigning, Rogers. I know you spent a good chunk of time in the freezer, but it's not like than anymore. There are people... a lot of them.. who will probably call for something to that effect, but it's not happening. As far as damage control goes, I don't think there's really much to be done. We can try getting out ahead of this, if you feel comfortable. I know it's not fun to get outed... especially, I assume, by snooty historians. Do you want me to have them fired? I can if you want. Maybe I—"
"How are you here?" She says, holding herself with an air of confidence that Steve would bet he could blow over.
Eventually he brings himself to rejoin the conversation, but it's not the same. It never is. Then Peggy and Daniel leave, Howard and Maria take Tony upstairs, and Steve collapses weakly onto the bed. "You'll wrinkle your clothes," Natasha says, rubbing his back.
"Sure, but she's on bed rest right now, so dinner will have to wait." He turns back towards them. "Anything I should know about these?" He points to the stones, laying in their open case.
Tony blinks at him. "You're telling me, a good looking guy like you can't get anyone in a city like this?"
"My... son?"
Steve stands up, walking towards the TV, stopping to stand right next to Tony. "What are they...?"
Yeah, sure.
"On it, boss."
"Him and the princess of Wakanda."
Steve, for what it's worth, adapts quickly, closing his lips around the digit and sucking gently. "-Ony," he says through the thumb. "Eed yhr bick. Pease." Tony trails his thumb down, letting it catch on Steve's lower lip.
Steve and Nat make eye contact, and Steve, fiddles with his weapons belt. "That's what we're trying to do sir."
The corners of Bucky's mouth twitch up. "Fair enough. Lead the way." Tony leads him back into the private elevator, hitting the button to take them up to the first floor of the lab, setting his thumb on the control panel. Really the panel was for show, he knew Jarvis was doing full body scans of both of them right now, but fingerprinting was fun.
"I didn't realize we were sleeping together," Steve says quietly, hoping to all hell that Tony didn't feel the increase in his pulse or the tightening of Steve's hands on his hips. It was a nice thought, even if it might end up splattered for everyone to see. Also, apparently Tony was famous or something, which was maybe something Steve should look into at home where nobody could make fun of him for not realizing that he kissed a celebrity.
"You're my best friend Bucky. Now come on, let's go find Sammy, ok?" Bucky nods, and Steve pulls both of them up to their feet. There were certainly plenty of perks to being incredibly strong. Steve waves Tony over, who shuffles closer awkwardly. "Hey Buck, I'd like you to meet Tony, yeah? He drove me."
Tony digs his heel into Steve's thigh in response, not ceasing his attempted bruising of Steve's lips. Steve moves to suck at his jaw. Tony bares his neck, breathing heavily into the still elevator. "JARVIS, can you.. penthouse."
Don’t worry, we’ll see more of Tony soon ;)
"Will do." Howard presses his palms together, turning to face them. "Just so you know, you have my full power backing you in whatever you need, so don't hesitate to ask. We're in one of the secret labs under my New York mansion right now, so the government doesn't know you're here, unless they found you out while you were stealing the tesseract, although I think they would've called me in on that. I can get you out of here in secret, or you can walk right out the front doors, or you can stay for a while and get your things together to find Barnes. Now, I have to head upstairs, because Maria might kill me if I'm not with her any longer, but you're welcome to stay down here, or in our quest room. I'm afraid she won't want to see you until after the baby is out, she's a little bloated."
Bucky brings back about a dozen plates of cake balanced on his arms and Tony just about has a heart attack. Somehow, he doesn't drop any, and they all get their cake safe and sound. It's surprisingly good for something Tony had a hand in cooking, and frosted like the American flag.
"Damn," Peter says.
"That's fine. My driver can take my car up to my place." Tony hooks his arm in Steve's.
Making it home is the easy part, Steve is sure of it. They only end up getting in one more fire fight with HYDRA and Steve is able to get Howard to send a boat to pick them up in Europe. Easy train ride right?
ya I'm good
Halfway through his shift, he gets a text from an unsaved number that only serves to widen his smile.
That doesn't exactly help Steve erase the visions of him waking up in Steve's bed, between soft sheets with one arm tucked around Steve's waist and—NO! Nope, nuh uh, that's not what he's thinking about. Steve squeezes his eyes shut, trying to ground himself with the feeling of the wet cloth under his hand. There was a task at hand. An important task. Like cleaning the counters. They weren't going to clean themselves. Steve lets his eyes open back up, keeping them firmly focused on the counters and later the glass furthest away from the stranger. What the hell did he even want? He was just standing on his phone in front of the cakes with that perfect hair and those ridiculous sunglasses.
Sam smiles gently, closing his eyes, final tears leaking out. "Thanks."
Steve feels his cheeks heat up. "N- no, I love Nat, but she's just a friend. It's just... been a while since I've seen her."
He looks into the mirror and sees the tears streaming down his face, such a contrast from his impeccable suit. With shaky hands, he brushes away his tears, the cuffs of his suit getting wet. He looks away from the mirror, walking away, to the kitchen. Everything here looked like Tony, the sleek lines of impeccable architecture, the huge windows, the lights he knows run on Ark Reactor power. The kitchen is mostly empty, upon first glance, but upon further observation he sees a small army of ants marching towards a bagel. Scott was here. The kitchen was never empty. Nat was always here. That was her knife on the counter, the peanut butter she always left out, the mission reports hung on the fridge, notated in her handwriting.
"Really?"
Steve rolls his eyes to avoid any more of this weird awkward small talk crap. "Congrats guys. But it that's all for tonight, we kinda have a date to finish." He had promised Tony a drink after dinner after all.
"Boss," Nat says, bumping his hip with hers and looking up at him through her lashes. She's holding a tray of chocolate peanut butter fudge destined for the display case, but she apparently felt the need to interrupt Steve's pining with a teasing smirk. "I think you might need to remember to blink," she teases, continuing on her trip to the display case.
"I was fucking surprised!" She takes a step closer., pressing her finger to his chest.
And there were people waiting for him. Bucky was waiting for him.
He laughs, which is an unexpected outcome. "Oh honey, I'm paying people a lot of money to clean up for me. I'm talking a lot."
"Yes. That is a great idea. See you guys later." He also looks like he wants to praise god right now as he darts past Steve and out the door.
Steve doesn't bother trying to unravel what the hell that meant, because it's at that moment that Tony reappears, looking just as gorgeous and put together as he always had. "Steve can you come here for a moment," Tony says pleasantly. Unfortunately that was a smile that Steve recognized as Tony's well constructed press smile, hiding something Steve couldn't identify underneath.
"Amen," Steve says, letting go of her.
"Deal. I love you."
Steve peeks out at him from the bathroom, his skin shiny with water and a smile on his face. "You made me stop, sweetheart."
"Yes right. I got you this," he holds out the rose. Steve takes it delicately, twirling the rose between his fingers. "Pepper said you would like it , so I don't think you're at serious risk of her killing you anymore."
He frowns at that. "Bye bye?"
"I'm sorry Buck, I can't.. I'm not what you need." Steve sits next to him, neither facing each other. "I have to go." His mind reminds him of the look on Peppers face when she told him the world needed him to be strong. She was right.
"Ok but sir.." Betty says. "How do you know us?"
The light switches and they walk out into the crosswalk, only two blocks from the tower now. "Tony!" Oh boy. "Tony Stark." Tony stops walking, turning to face the woman.
It was good to see Bucky back on his feet like that. When he started working, he would hardly say a complete sentence to a customer and would only speak to Steve when necessary. Yeah, Steve wouldn't mind going to Bucky's wedding soon. It was written in the stars, as soon as these two assholes got their shit together. He was almost ready to start placing bets on who would propose first with Nat. She said it was going to be Sam, but Steve wouldn't put it past Bucky to grow a pair, not with the way he looks at Sam.
But it could never stay like this. Steve couldn't stay here. There was going to be another Captain America around here soon, and Tony would have a new Uncle Steve. If they were gone in a timely manner, Tony wouldn't even remember him. Tony sticks his fingers in his mouth, staring up at Steve with huge brown eyes. "You're going to be amazing, Tony."
"M-Mr. Stark?" Peter asks shakily.
"Will you stop it," Steve says, swatting at his hand. He sighs, rubbing at his temple. "Sorry. Sorry."
Pepper purses her lips at Tony, and the brunet shrinks back into his chair, crossing his arms over his chest and mouthing something that Steve can't make out. "Thank you for the cake, Steve, it looks wonderful."
Instead of trying to say anything (there was nothing to be said), Bruce nods. "Thanks Steve."
Her gaze redirects on him and she deflates with the realization that this was still her wedding and they still had an audience. "You—I—ok. Thank you. I like dark chocolate. Tony, I'm still going to beat your ass," Tony winces, "but I'm not going to kill you anymore, so take what you can get."
"That's really sweet. From what I've seem, you did a great job." Steve says, squeezing his hand as they step out the sliding glass doors onto the street.
Bucky puts his head back in his hands. "What if... what if I make a fool of myself up there in front of all those people? Or what if Sam doesn't like being married to me? What if—"
Luckily, if you could call it that, it seemed that the bone was still in his arm, so... fuck anyways.
Steve holds up the recently collected plastic bag containing one reality stone. "That's the one. We had to borrow it, but you can have it back now."
"Wait, it's real?" Nat says, her mouth hanging open.
Tony blows a raspberry at him over Steve's shoulder. "Not my fault you're jealous."
"Steve Rogers. I must say, I never expected to meet again." The voice belongs to a creature Steve had never expected to meet again. Johann Schmidt, the Red Skull. The head of HYDRA that got away.
He lays back against the rock and looks up at the expansive blue of an endless sky framed by trees and buildings alike. This was good.
"Alright, perfect," Steve says, regretfully letting go of his hand to go around to the passenger seat. Tony climbs into the drivers seat, starting the car up.
At that moment Maria walks in, Nat next to her, and Tony on her hip. "Evening Peggy, Danny."
"What's up with you?" Steve asks, pulling him away from the fridge and kicking it shut. Tony was always weird, but this was funny behavior, even for him.
Steve sets his drawing board to the side, and his pencil atop it. Perhaps tea would ease his mind. He rubs his forehead, trodding over the sleek floors towards the kitchen. He had the tower all to himself today, if only by coincidence. Clint was out—probably feeding stray dogs—as were Nat and Bruce, working a case that somehow nobody else had the clearance to know details about. Steve suspected they were actually doing something else, but he didn't know what. It might still be for SHIELD, but he wasn't sure. Thor was off world, and Tony was... well, he didn't know where Tony was, but that wasn't unusual. He was usually holed up in his lab, doing god knows what. It was better that way, in Steve's opinion. He liked Tony just fine—a little more than just fine if you ask the more deprived parts of his brain—but there was nobody else on the planet who had such a knack for pissing him off. Sure, they were capable of civility, until either said something the other deemed irritating, and then it was back into the fray. The rest of the team liked to place bets on who would piss the other off first on any given day.
"What about now?" He asks, batting his eyelashes. Before Steve can reply, Tony darts around him to open the fridge. "Mm, that cake looks so good. What if I—" Steve grabs his wrist where it is, reaching out towards the cake. Tony looks at him with wide eyes.
"I'm fine now, and I'm powerful as hell."
"You know we could return the rest of the stones, then come back?" She says, knocking her foot against his leg.
"Please. I need you to go back to New York," Tony says, standing next to his car, with Steve's hand in his.
"I wouldn't put it past him. He was pretty concerned about how your 40's sensibilities would mix with the 21st century." She pulls out two expensive looking bottles of vodka and jumps up onto the counter next to him, slipping into a crisscross position.
Natasha stands across the room holding a glass of red wine. She's wearing a high necked, sequin covered black dress with an open back and sides, laces holding it up and obscenely massive silver hoop earrings. Somehow she's also managing to keep her balance in 5 inch torture devices. She looks at ease, smiling and laughing and talking in a luscious Russian accent; the opposite of how Steve felt. The heads of HYDRA mingle around them, all as immaculately put together as a puzzle. Steve sets his shoulders and saunters over to Natasha, a dangerous smile on his face. As soon as he's in reach she has a kiss planted on his cheek. "And I'm sure you've met my darling boyfriend, Ivan," she says to the older man she had apparently been conversing with. He has a young woman in a skin tight dress on his arm, and she looks fairly bored, but judging by the diamonds Steve doubted she would be bored enough to leave.
wouldn't you like to know weather boy
"Hi Peter." Steve waves back, his arms stiff from still being pinned down.
She tilts her head at him, raising her brow in a way that almost reminds him of Tony. "You're welcome?"
"Well, did you consider." Tony's crying too. "That I can't live another day without you either!" Tony lets himself slump forward resigned to the hug no matter how mad he was.
"Yeah. It's the only place that reminds me of real Italian food. My moms Italian, and she would cook for me sometimes. God she made the best pasta ai fiori di zucca. It had these zucchini blossoms in it.. I can't really describe it without making it, but I'm afraid I'm not much of a cook. I have the recipes though, so maybe I could get Bruce to make it," Tony muses, getting a wistful took on his face at the mention of his mother. "Oh, Bruce is Victors dad, I don't think I said that." Tony could probably talk for hours, Steve thinks. He was a genius or something, so that brain of his had to be running a mile a minute, even over something like zucchini pasta. "I actually don't like most Italian anymore, but this place is good. Ma might even approve." He blinks once, stopping his train of thought. "I was rambling, sorry," he apologizes with a grimace that Steve wants to kiss right off his face. Oh wait... he could.
Tony blinks up at her. "Yes.."
God, he hopes Pepper knows just how lucky she is.
Chapter two! Meet the supporting cast, lol. Some of them won’t really appear in this story, but might in later installations if I can’t control myself and keep writing in this universe haha. Enjoy!
"I learned from the best," she says, patting his arm.
"No, my turn. Steve, look. I know that you loved Tony—"
"Happy Birthday," Tony says, pressing a gentle kiss against Steve's lips. As soon as he was finished with the cake, Tony had hurried to Steve's apartment for a full night of sweet kisses and easy touches.
The party proceeds as if nothing was wrong. As if there weren't a massive elephant in the room. Peter always keeps at least one person as a buffer between him and his dad, and Steve doesn't leave Tony's side, their hands intertwined. As the night progressed, so too did Tony's fidgeting.
Also on the 6th day, Natasha finally breaks down crying. The whole trip, she had been trying to get control over her new powers and was no closer then than she was when she began. "Did you learn nothing in Siberia?" She says into his chest, his shirt damp with her tears.
He inhales deeply, just now realizing that he hadn't been breathing. So that's why his lungs felt like they were being crushed. In for four counts, hold for four counts, out for four counts. In. Hold. Out. The room comes into sharp focus, and he's quite frankly delighted to see that nobody was staring at him like he grew another head. Other then Nat, not a single eye was on him. He offers up a thin smile, and she returns it. You ok?, she taps
They land a little less then a mile from the base, it's metal gates imposing on them. He knows that Tony—his Tony was just here. But that wasn't his mission. He.. couldn't. "Now what?" Her voice is gentle, like she knows, although he hadn't explicitly said that Tony was gone.
Wooh! Here we go! Steve FINALLY realizes his mistake, but what’s he going to do about it? Well, probably be a disaster, but that’s obvious, isn’t it.
Tony smiles too. "I know, Rebecca. Walk with me?" He offers her a hand and she takes it, allowing him to lead her away.
"Hi everyone." Steve gives a little wave to the camera, feeling a light pink creeping up his collar. "Ok um.. so there have been some things being said about me in the past few hours that are... not right. Morally. I am proud to call myself a Christian, and I would like to make it very clear that those who preach hate do not adequately follow the Lords teachings of kindness, and disgrace his good name." Tony gives him a little thumbs up and Steve can't help his smile. "That being said, the journal found and displayed by the Smithsonian does indeed belong to me, and it is saying exactly what everyone is thinking it does. I'm not going to bullshit you with something about how we had different ways of spreading affection and I was hyperbolizing. It wouldn't be true. I am, as Tony helped me word it, very happy to be gay." An honest smile flickers into Tony's face. "So I guess you can count this as me coming out. I have a lot to learn, and a lot to unlearn, but I vow to all of you at home that I will do my best to become more educated on our shared history. Tony told me that I should go to Pride this June, but given that I'm not exactly sure what that is yet, I'm going to hold off on making any commitments. I hope you all have a good rest of your day. Spread love, not hate." Steve gives a little salute to the camera, looking up at Tony and grinning, watching him turn the recording off. "How's that?"
