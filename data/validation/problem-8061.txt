“What, you don’t like Cap?” Tony said a sad look in his eyes as if Steve had killed a puppy right in front of Tony, and of course Steve almost turned red from blushing, the nickname was new, no one had every called him Cap, or at least his fictional alter ego.
Steve’s paintings went up for auction once a year for the next four years, they funded recovery projects, but mostly they funded orphanages like the one Morgan had come from. The reason was that Morgan was the one that had finally pulled Tony away from his guilt over the decimation, and it was something that he was grateful for every day. To the kids, Steve was Pops who helped them with training if they asked, self-defense, or in Miles’ case, just being an ear for art projects that he was interested in. Tony was Dad, he cooked everyone’s favorite meals, made them gagets, and was homework monitor.
When he made it to the front, a small crowd had gathered, because of course Tony is one of the most well know people in the city, but then he heard some of them call him Professor and Steve wasn’t sure what that was about. Yes, they had talked during dinner and in the hours afterwards, but it had been mostly about what they both liked and Tony was a wealth of information, even really random pop culture references. He quickly directed the police to the back, sending Natasha with them before turning his attention towards Sam, who had called Bucky over from the door. Clint was standing guard, which was strange, but maybe he could ask Thor for a job.
Steve stood there watching as Tony walked off, he wanted to follow the other man, but instead he opted to greet their new visitor, Rhodes and Nebula next to him, Nebula looking at Tony’s retreating figure like she wanted to follow him as well. There had been something in Tony’s eyes just before he walked away, and Steve couldn’t bring himself to ask what was wrong. It was still all too fresh in their minds, and he was sure that somewhere he still wasn’t forgiven for all the wrongs that had happened between them. That morning had been a surprise, the fact that Tony had felt comfortable enough to relax around him after Siberia, after the decimation around them, but it was still a fragile bond and one he didn’t want to push too far.
“They were trapped in one of the underground parking lots at Stark Industries out in California, apparently the snap caused a plane to fall, luckily they got back into the building but couldn’t get out until crews started digging,” Natasha told him as she sat on one of the plastic chairs next to the bed. “We’re finding people, and the ones connected to us are being brought here.”
He could hear Sitwell talking in the elevator, although his words are muffled, he knew that they were getting ready to transport the stone to wherever it was they had taken it before it ended up with Von Strucker. The moment the elevator opened; he could see the surprised look on their faces as Steve walked onto the elevator.
Tony couldn’t stop the surprise look on his face, even exhausted he was sure that he wouldn’t be able to hide that look. “Really?”
“Then sit on my face and I’ll get you all sloppy,” Steve said, his voice in control but his eyes were roaming up and down Tony’s body. Tony felt himself twitch at the words, he’s never thought twice about having Steve open him up, but without the use of his hands, and just his tongue, had Tony shivering just to start.
“Maybe there’s somethings that are more permanent than others,” Bruce told him. “We’re all here, we all care about you.”
Sometimes everything that once was, will not always come to be
“We got really lucky,” he said and Tony knew this, even after everything they’ve been through over the years, they had gotten really lucky in finding each other.
Steve couldn’t believe what he was hearing, he looked over at Nat as if they had found something that they wouldn’t have thought possible.
Steve looked at his best friend in shock, he wasn’t sure what the hell was happening, “What, Buck no, she wanted to, but I pulled away.”
“Tony,” Steve called out worried, but Tony didn’t listen, he couldn’t, he watched as Thanos took the glove from Carol headbutting her, fighting her until he had the glove.
“It’s Thanos,” Rhodey said and Tony snorted next to Steve.
“So, you know about me, Ms. Potts,” he said feeling shy all of a sudden.
“I currently don’t have her whereabouts, my systems for the compound are down Boss,” she said and he could feel his heart breaking. He found Steve but without FRIDAY, finding everyone else is going to take a little work.
“Call me Pepper, and yes I do, I wouldn’t be one of his closest friends if I didn’t,” she said to him and he nodded, there was so much of his past that was intertwined with Tony’s and he hadn’t even known that much. “Just so you know, he’s a good guy, his parents wanted him to take over the company, and they’ve been grooming him towards it, but he fought them tooth and nail just so that he could teach part-time, he loves teaching and his students are always interning at Stark Industries because of it too. They’re all very bright, but there had always been one place where he had never stepped back from, and his mother knows this because he once told her, when he had been twelve, that he was going to end up with you.”
Getting up he walked back to the counter and tried to figure out what kind of coffee he wanted, the first one hadn’t been strong enough but Natasha had ordered it for him, so this time he wanted five shots of espresso added to it if he had to. Plus, it gave him a reprieve from hearing Natasha and Jan talk about their love lives, or at least Natasha talk about Bucky. Although it had been nice to have more information that she had for once. When it was his turn to order he was greeted with the very familiar smile of Steve behind the counter.
“Nat,” he called out to her as she reached him. “I’m going to go with Mr. Stark to the hospital now, you and Bucky are in charge until I get back.”
If there was one thing that Steve wasn’t expecting it was Bucky telling him and Tony was on his way, he worried that Tony would get into an accident on the way there. He had almost told Bucky to tell them not to worry
“Do I have to,” he grumbled into the pillow. “I didn’t sleep last night, this bed was too hard.”
“Seriously Scott, that’s what you’re taking away from this,” Tony said feeling exasperated because someone other than Steve was smelling him... even if it wasn’t exactly him. “Yeah, I had it for emergencies. Relax. Can we focus here?”
“If I tell you what happens, it won't happen,” Strange answered and Tony wanted to throttle the man. They had lost everything, it had taken so long to get to this point, when all the man had had to do was turn back time five years ago, or find a way to send them to Wakanda where Steve had been fighting.
It had been raining on opening day, and Tony had rushed into the store just a few hours before closing, his hair a mess and his glasses on because he hadn’t bothered with his contacts after his last class was over. Ordering his favorite coffee from the counter and sitting down to look at the stack of books he had picked up, trying to figure out which ones he wanted. Mrs. Rogers had sent him an email telling him to catch up on his reading before she came to visit during Christmas, so that they could talk about them. He wasn’t going to argue with the little old lady, especially since she was the reason, he had started reading romance all of those years ago.
“Fight first, answers later,” Steve said as he fought through the hoard.
“You’ll be fine,” Steve told him patting Bucky on the back. “Just treat her right, and don’t do anything stupid and you’ll survive.”
Tony called Steve the moment he had gotten the papers in front of him, with two excited teenagers in tow, the Stark family had been complete. The house was big enough for all of them, after a year of work, Clint and family were going to move in the next week as well. Tony knew that if Natasha, or any of the other Avengers were going to show up he would find a way to build them homes as well. This was the best way for them to rebuild their lives, but finding each other and becoming a family.
Everyone in the room groaned at Scott’s question, none of them wanting to answer, instead Bruce turned to Clint and pointed at the platform, indicating that he should get going before they diverged into something in even more ridiculous.
“I just wish that we had the time to fix what Hydra had done to him, for him to remember me, for none of this to have happened, we all lost so much but I gained a family when we became the Avengers,” she told him and while he knew that she was trying, Riri had given her something more to hope for.
“You’re crazy, your fucking nuts,” Scott said and Tony could see the worried look in Steve’s eyes, but it was the only way and they both knew it. It was the perfect distraction, and no one would notice someone who looked a lot like Tony walking off with the stone, mainly because he would also be in SHIELD gear.
“Oh... okay, and if you get cold you and your guest can sleep inside,” she said before he could hear her muffled voice, which meant she covered the receiver on the phone. “Anyway, is this person special to you or is it one of your rowdy baseball buddies?”
Tony let out a sound that let everyone in the house know how excited he was, he had woken up Peter and Harley, Natasha and Bucky came in from the kitchen where they had been making some food for them, and Thor walked behind Bruce looking around at the pictures that were nestled everywhere.
He remembered once, a long time ago, what feels like another lifetime ago, when they were all standing in the Tower’s living area, when they had all joked about being able to lift Thor’s hammer. He denied feeling the power flow through his hands all of those years ago, even now after everything he’s put them all through, he doesn’t think himself worthy, but if it would save them all he would try. There was something about Mjölnir, it called out to those who were worthy of wielding it, it was pure power, and even when he denied it, he could feel it’s call. He saw as Thanos was fighting Thor, as Thor’s own weapon was used against him. Steve reached for that part of himself that he had denied so much, he reached out for Mjölnir and saw the hammer floating up before it flew towards him.
“Okay Pops, I hear you,” Miles said his shoulders slumped and Steve knew that it was more about getting caught over actually using his powers. Both he and Tony had encouraged the kids to learn more about their abilities to test their limits, but only within a controlled environment.
“Do I want to know?” Natasha asked before Tony told her everything that Steve had just said, talking so fast and sometimes in three different languages that no one but Thor and Natasha could understand. “Really, you’re not lying, Rogers if you lied to my brother, I will kill you where you stand.”
“I eat, I swear, also I finished the majority of the coursework over the summer, I was bored and did everything, so I’m actually freer than you think, it’s just my writing class that I have work for, other than that I’m tinkering or writing.”
“Stop bickering,” Bruce said, a smile still on his face.
“Go ahead,” it was now question and answer time, which was better than hiding from Steve all together. It’s nice to have a full conversation with Steve and not worry about whether he was offending Steve by saying the wrong thing.
“Not yet, she’s really good at taking care of herself, and technically she’s older than me, but our brothers might say something if you get to that point in your relationship.”
“They’re too much sometimes,” Steve said to him as he wrapped his arms tighter around Tony, honestly, it’s Steve’s fault if he never wanted to get up from that position ever again.
“Well, I thought that’s what we were doing,” Clint said, which was what they all thought that they were doing.
“So, does this mean that you’re dating Tony Stark?” Bucky asked and Steve knew that they were curious, but Steve wasn’t sure about the logistics of it either, because while they talked and had fun, they hadn’t kissed so it couldn’t be considered a first date.
“Steve,” Bucky said from the other side of the door, and Steve knew that he wasn’t ready to talk to anyone. “We need to talk for a sec.”
The zeroes and ones were a carefully coded word, and it was weird to write it because he still wasn’t sure about Steve’s feelings but he thought maybe confessing this way would help him avoid the heartache that would come later. When Steve was walking over, Tony threw the bill into the jar and walked towards him so that he hopefully wouldn’t notice what Tony had done. Tony could feel the heat rising on his cheeks but he didn’t want anyone to notice so he tried his best to act like it was nothing.
“Can I get a little space here,” Bruce said pressing some more buttons, but Steve was starting to get worried about the whole thing.
“Good work,” his professor said before walking off to another project.
“I’m not going to ask questions about your life Steve, or about who your mystery man here is, all I want to know is if you’re happy?”
“Come on,” Bucky called out. “We still have to pick up Sam, and you know how he is about where he sits in the damn car.”
“We know that you and Dad are trying to get everyone back,” Riri said looking at him and he knew she was trying to get out of being in trouble for this. “When dad dropped us off at Aunt Pepper’s we had already known.”
Also, my grandparents are actually seven years apart in age, this was common especially after WWI, because a lot of men had died so there was actually less men than women in some regions, so it was actually normal for older men and younger women to get married. (a little history for you)
Natasha looked over at him surprised by this, “And if James was going to drive down with Steve it means he’s there as well.”
“I should be the one who’s sorry, I distracted you,” Stark said to him and Steve really wasn’t sure whether or not he was hallucinating, because after weeks of Instagram posts on the store he was sure that he had someone stalking him. Although Stark could just be there trying to verify why someone was using his name to post pictures of a New York bookstore.
“According to what I overheard it’s was Nat, so I’m guessing it’s short for Natasha or Natalie or something,” Bucky answered a grin on his face. “She’s perfect Steve, I swear it, but I’ve never had to work this hard to get someone’s attention, so I’m afraid that all this work would go to waste and she won’t like me at all.”
Nebula starts walking towards them when Rhodey lands in front of Lang who drops the rest of his taco.
“Thanks,” she said smiling at him.
“Okay,” Rhodey says reluctantly before cutting the call.
“It was an infectious garbage scowl.” Nebula said and Steve could hear her distain, Steve wanted to laugh, even when Nebula was away, she had picked up enough of Tony’s quirks that it showed when she had any kind of emotion. Tony worked for a long time to get her to come to terms with her past, Thor, Bruce, and Valkyrie even more, when she went to visit them in New Asgard. Nebula had made friends with all of them, and was fiercely protective of Tony, which was good.
Gathering everyone took more time that they had anticipated, mainly because they were all scattered around the known universe, Carol didn’t show up until late at night, Thor and Valkyrie somehow ended up showing up with Bruce and Rocket, but it was Natasha and Vision’s return that had spawned a huge fight, when Lila Barton, who had snuck her way back into the ship with Bruce started yelling at her father, much to the surprise of everyone in the room.
“Come on Steve, let’s go... wait where’s your car?” Bucky said looking around as Steve started the mini-van. “I’m not going to this thing in your dad’s mini.”
The only other people who had known he was writing these stories were his two best friends from school, Pepper and Rhodey. Though they laughed at him for writing them, they let him have his fun since he rarely got to do anything outside of the preapproved Stark extracurriculars. They were the only people outside of his family that he had been close with, Pepper had gone off to NYU to be with her girlfriend who lived in Queens and had also gotten into the school, and Rhodey went to MIT, where Tony had originally planned on going but in the end decided on a smaller school in a town that hadn’t been invaded by his brothers.
“Anyway, rules, you guys can kiss but please keep it PG I don’t want to walk in on something that I shouldn’t be seeing,” Bucky said shivering as he said it, almost as if the thought of Tony and Steve doing anything would scar him for life.
“You’re not going to stand there and pine over whether or not Tony was going to walk through the door,” she said with a smile, but Steve could only glare at her.
“If I told you that we’re from the future, and you would be my aunt, would you believe me?” Tony said with a small smile, he was sad and shy and Steve just wanted to kiss it out of him.
They were at it for a little while before the cradle sent a shock through the system, Tony thought it could have been an aftereffect of Thor’s powers, but it ended up electrocuting Bruce, and sending out the Hulk for the first time in weeks. The problem with that was the Tony had been right next to him when it had happened, and Bruce had knocked him into the wall on the far side of the room. He didn’t hear the doors open, all he knew was that one moment he was trying to breathe again, and the next Steve was standing in front of him.
He tried really hard not to throw up from the whole Quantum leap that they had just done, but everything came out anyway, right onto the rubble from the Battle of Manhattan, while the Avengers fought the Chitari in the background.
“I have a life, I have three kids in college, and one at home, who is probably blowing something up with her father right now, because Tony had that manic look on his face this morning, even though I told him to take it easy before I left,” he said sighing as he thought about the crazy things that his husband was probably up to. “Honestly though, Nat, you need to let go of this, at least for a little while, have Rhodey take over and just take a vacation.”
“We try and move on,” he said even though it hurt to say it out loud. “We get ready for the next threat, and you become the Queen of Wakanda and you help your people, because that’s what they would have wanted.”
There was nothing better than the feeling he had at the moment, with Tony by his side, his family there, he was happy. Hours later, after his parents had kicked them all out of the hospital, Steve sat in the living room with Tony at his side. They had all changed into more comfortable clothes, Tony in one of Steve’s hoodies, his contacts out and his glasses back on. He looked comfortable, but Steve wished that they had had the chance to dance at the party, hell he wished that he had been able to go to the party.
“No one,” he answered but he knew that she knew that he was lying, especially when she was staring at him the way she was at that moment. “Fine, the first thing was that one of my stories for class wasn’t a hit with the professor, because I was dumb enough to give him one of my own fanfics, and then.... well my writing partner turned out to be an ass who made me do most of the work and then decided he was going to hand it in as his final project without giving me credit for the work.”
“In all my years of conquest...violence...slaughter... It was never personal,” Thanos said as Steve looked up at him. “But I'll tell you now... what I'm about to do to your stubborn, annoying little planet... I'm gonna enjoy it. Very, very much.”
“The A.I. in the story is real,” Tony told him with a smile. “Right now, it’s in its first stages, but I want to create a full interface A.I. one day, though I don’t think that the world would be ready for something like that when I’m finished, no matter how advanced technology is.”
Back by popular demand, it's a good thing I know things about working at a bookstore..... too many things
(See the end of the chapter for
“No Tony, you were down there since yesterday afternoon,” Pepper said giving him a look that he only knew about when she was angry at him for working too hard. “So, after you both eat, you’re going to bed, and neither one of you can say otherwise.”
“See now you’re nervous,” Steve said kissing his forehead. “We could meet each other’s families, and if we survive that we can survive anything.”
“Why is that thing so complicated, I don’t even know how to turn it on,” she said as she slid it into his pocket.
“You can go back,” he said pulling away from Bucky and turning towards Tony. “And... Tony I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have been in there alone,” he felt bad for running Tony off, especially since Tony had been right about it also being his room. Bucky waiting outside looking around for him before spotting him, Steve held out his hand telling Bucky to give him a minute.
“She suspected that Nebula wasn’t our Nebula,” Steve answered, “You’re not thinking...”
“We can take that off your hands,” Sitwell said as he took the scepter from Natasha, if they had known that the stone had been inside, they would have been able to prevent so many things.
“Joseph Rogers, so help me I will throw something at you if you don’t stop hovering, I want to meet Steve’s boyfriend and you’re not going to stop me from doing that, I’ve been sitting around all day, I can walk for a little while.”
“No rest for the wicked,” Tony said and made to move again only to be pushed back by Steve. “Come on Steve, we need to work.”
There was something about watching the Avengers work, they were still only half of a team, Rhodes was off getting Clint, Nebula, Rocket and Carol were all on their way, Thor and Valkyrie were driving down, Bruce had told him that Thor had taken the last fight horribly and they had been trying with him.
“See, even Steve understands.”
“Tony you don’t have to....” he had started to say before the door slammed shut, he felt bad all of a sudden, he knew that he had been invading Tony’s space, but Bucky had told him to wait for him in his room and then shoved the key in his hand.
The car was mostly silent, Tony liked it that way, it ran on clean energy, he worked on it like crazy. So, when he saw Steve standing outside of the facility, he couldn’t help but drive by as fast as he could before stopping in front of his husband who looked like he was just tired of everything that had happened.
“I hadn’t even known that it was mom who was in labor, my boyfriend was driving his brother up here,” Bruce said before pointing out Tony and Natasha who were standing next to a very tall blonde man, who Steve knew should be familiar but there was too much happening at that moment.
“Please Peg, don’t ask things I can’t really tell you,” he said but before he could stop her, she walked over to where Tony was standing and looked right into his eyes.
There was a moment as Steve watched Tony gather his stuff and shove it into his bag, where Steve was certain that he had messed up somehow.
“I think we’ll be here for a very long time,” he answered, hoping that the owner of the building wouldn’t raise their rent too much in the next year.
“It’s okay, I know how much you hate being stuck in bed, well not so much as being stuck in bed because otherwise we’d be doing it on the floor, but I know that you hate being injured.”
Tony watched as he took out another couple of fighters, with a little help from Pepper, then he saw Strange and he wondered if this was it, if this was what he had been talking about all those years ago.
“Yeah I know that Sharon wanted to date Sam too, but we all thought that he was pining over Bucky, so we never put two and two together, it just shows how bad we are at matchmaking,” she sighed and looked Steve right in the eye. “Don’t hurt Tony, he doesn’t deserve it, not after everything he’s been through, and if you do, I have a pair of four-inch Jimmy Choo’s with steal heels waiting for your balls.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Tony said even though they hadn’t established actual boundaries in their so-called relationship, they did go on dates and did all kinds of things together, not just the stuff in the bedroom. Tony had been afraid of actually saying the words I love you after the accident, he was afraid that the moment he said them that Steve would vanish and cease to exist. He was afraid that if he said them that Steve would die and Tony would be alone, and he hated it, his biggest fear was losing Steve. Not just if he died but also if he got bored with Tony and didn’t want him anymore.
“Come on Morgoona, let’s go eat and then we’ll make something together,” Tony said and his little angel girl squealed at him. She knew that she had him wrapped around her little finger, there was no denying how much he loved her for how happy she always was, even as he remembered just how sad she had been as a toddler when he had first met her.
“Yeah well you kind of did,” Tony said sighing as he sat down on the same bench but far enough away from Steve that they weren’t touching. He wasn’t sure if he could touch Steve again and never stop.
"Don’t you already know enough about history?”
During this time, Maria begged Howard for another child, a little girl, because while she loved her boys, she didn’t like being out numbered, and she wanted someone to go shopping with and teach things too that Howard didn’t allow the boys to be taught, because men don’t dance in a ballet. Though she often told him that it was a lie, but he was set in his ways, and while Loki loved the arts, his taste was more about producing than performing. So, they started the process of adopting a little baby girl, she was from Russia, her parents had passed away the day she had been born. Though they hadn’t known it just yet, but Maria had been pregnant with Tony at the time.
“He looks cute as a teenager,” Hope said smiling.
They did get that picture on the wall, somewhere between eating and sharing their basket of fries, the waitress had taken their picture and posted on the wall, even giving them a copy. Steve hadn’t even seen the flash go off, but it had happened when Tony had been eating a fry and Steve bit off the other end, both of them were smiling while it happened, even if they hadn’t seen the picture get taken.
Tony walked over so that there was someone there in case she needed a hand, because the guy was a perv if Tony had ever seen one, and he was almost certain that the man had been jerking off right there in front of a bunch of kids. Tony did the only thing he could think of, he started ushering the kids towards their parents before walking over to where Natasha stood as she tried to pull the man out of the chair.
“You get a reading on those tremors?” Natasha asked Okoye, pulling Steve out of his thoughts, Okoye looked like she was speaking from Shuri’s lab in Wakanda, which made Steve wonder where the Wakandan Queen was at the moment.
Even with his wish to go to bed and actually sleep, it had been a week of first classes, and a tired Tony, because his roommate came in at all hours of the night, the guy worked part-time at one of the restaurants off campus, so he also smelled like freshly baked bread for some reason. Tony usually got a few hours of sleep in before his roommate came in a jarred him awake by kicking down the door as he came into the room, and because Tony is the kind of person that once he’s up he can’t go back to bed, well the whole thing messed with his already lacking sleep schedule. So, he was happy when Thursday came, and his first writing course was well on its way. Because he wore contacts and was well groomed when he took press photos with his family, no one in class or the school knew he was the same Tony as his public persona. Blame it on his unruly hair, and the glasses, he’s was blind without them, and though his mother and sister had both told him that he could get Lasik eye surgery, Tony had a thing about people putting needles or knives of any kind near his eyes. He was now very grateful for having to wear them, people didn’t point at him, hell the only person who had realized it was him was James, or Bucky as he liked to be called.
“I’ll be here waiting,” Steve said kissing him quickly before pulling away.
“Oh, yeah,” he answered trying very hard not to have a flashback, as he saw his father standing in front of him.
“I would love to hear more about it, maybe we could collaborate, I’ve been working on projects that would help third world countries get better medical care,” Bruce said with Thor beaming next to him. “It’s actually how I met your brother, he was at a fundraiser that my company had put together, I work for a nonprofit, and Thor was there as Stark Industries liaison, we started talking about a town in New Mexico that had been hit pretty badly by some gas explosion and how he wanted to help.”
“Okay, we’ll go out this week, just you and me, get to know each other better too, maybe next weekend I could take you to meet my parents and you can talk to my dad about Iron Man.”
“Yes, Darling,” Tony answered while scissoring Steve open, “Is there anything you need?”
This was supposed to be short..... it kind of got away from me
He was too shocked to noticed that he hadn’t fully put the shelf back on correctly and the thing fell down and hit his foot, “Fuck,” he yelled out, jumping up and down.
They had gotten married the next day, Riri as their only witness, after he told Tony about how they had met, and how they had bonded, Steve feeling like an overprotective Uncle. The judge had to sign an NDA considering who he was marrying, but it would become public record, that Captain America and Iron Man got married one year after the snap. As for Riri, they had asked her if she would like to live with them on the months she wasn’t in school. Steve didn’t want her to be alone, and she said yes, happy that she could learn from Tony, they brought her back to the lake house, they became her foster parents weeks later after she had told Tony about what had happened to her parents. Because for Tony, who had lost Peter, he didn’t want her to be alone in the world, he didn’t want anyone to be alone. That was when their little family started to grow, and Steve wouldn’t have traded any of it for the world.
“Are you suggesting that we have an intervention with a God,” Natasha said as she slid into one of the seats across from them. “Because if we are, then all of the Avengers are going to need some kind of therapy.”
“I know,” he said holding onto the man that just a few days ago he swore to keep close to his heart. “But we owe it to them to keep trying.”
“You already said that,” Steve said to him but it only made him want to say it again.
“Hey,” Tony said but Steve smiled.
“They’re our kids,” Steve said smiling as the family played around the yard, Kamala and Miles both getting ready for college. “You’ve done good with them.”
“What did you notice?” he asked genuinely curious about what Carol had seen that they all had missed, though now that he thought about it, Nebula hadn’t been seen since they returned. Usually she would be with Valkyrie or Tony, but he hadn’t seen her come near them at all which was a little odd for her, and he knew that she was strange as it was.
“Sorry,” he said holding onto to her hand for a moment, “We’ve got enough for one round trip each, that’s it. No do-overs. Plus, two test runs,” his hand accidentally pressed a botton on the suit activating the particle and shrinks down, Hope sighing next to him before he grows back to his normal size. “Okay one test run.”
He turned to Steve, knowing that he needed to say his peace, especially with what could possibly be the outcome of their lives from this moment forward. “Steve, we’ve got a shot, a real shot at getting these stones, but I have to tell you my priorities, to bring everyone back, definitely yes, but I also want to keep what I’ve got, what we have, I have to at all costs, because I can’t lose you or those kids. And maybe we should try not dying in the process because honestly, I’m sure they would resurrect us just to beat the living shit out of us.”
“Yeah, whatever,” Steve’s father said before kissing his wife and ushering her towards the kitchen. “Come on Steve, let's make some drinks and you can both tell me and your mother about how you two met.”
“I never thought of it that way, I was always just being myself, I never thought to think about what Bucky would be feeling,” Steve had this look on his face almost like everything was revealing itself to him, and Tony wondered if he had opened the box that would bring Steve back towards his former love. “I guess we were different after all, he’s more open here than he had been at home, whereas I’m still the same person I’ve always been, but he’s still my best friend.”
The store was busy the whole day as more and more students realized that they were open, so they came for coffee and to order school books that they didn’t carry. He hadn’t seen Tony all day and Steve wondered if he had thought too much about their so-called dinner. Instead of dwelling on what could have been, he watched his staff help the customers. He also watched Clint ask Darcy out in Clint’s own special way, which was a little over the top, and involved the guy shooting Darcy with what looked like an arrow with a heart on it. The whole thing was cute and weird at the same time, but Darcy loved it so Steve was just going to let the whole thing go.
“Yeah except for the part where nothing happened,” Steve told him not even getting up from the bench he was on. Tony could tell that Steve was cold, almost as if he had been sitting there for so long just waiting for him to get out of the library, because Steve knew where he went all of the time. “Tony, I was rejecting Sharon when whatever it was you saw happened, you can ask Bucky, hell you can ask Natasha because she slapped me thinking that I broke your heart.”
That was another thing about his life, his family, as crazy as they were, they took care of him, made sure he went to the best schools in New York, made sure he smiled and had fun, even when he had blown up his workshop in the garage and had gotten a three hour lecture from his father about safety protocols and making sure not to mix chemicals. That was the thing about being a Stark, you had to be the best of the best, and when you messed up, well you got lectured for it.
“We have a book club, well not anymore since she moved, though she sends me recommendations, but anyway, she was the first real friend I had when I was a kid, she always told me to read something other than those science journals or the mechanic books I read.”
“Hold on!,” he heard Scott call out. “That wasn’t our only time machine.”
Steve looked at him like Tony had physically punched him in the face, for some reason it reminded him of the first time the mind stone had messed with them, “I needed you, I needed my family with me, I told you all that this was coming, and nope no one listened to me, Bucky was more important, your freedom was more important, I wanted to put a suit of armor around the world and protect what was precious to us, because that’s what we needed.”
“What are you calling it,” his professor asked as the bot followed his movements.
Tony nodded, giving Ty a smile before going through the pages and pages of dialogue, quickly typing it into his laptop, every once and a while he adjusted the whole thing to better fit what he was writing. It was second nature for him to fix and adjust things, he did it with his stories and he did it with whatever he was inventing, his own phone had been created by him, there’s only one in the world, because he had hated what his mother had given him. The only thing in there was the chip for the phone company, everything else came from his need to fix and adjust, so he used the same on the dialogue that Ty had given him.
“I didn’t really, I just knew that there was something bigger that we had to deal with, I know you and Tony have your issues, hell Tony’s issues could fill three hundred books and still not be enough, but I knew that we needed to start somewhere,” he said to Steve and he knew that it was the truth. “Honestly speaking, you two can’t function without the other, the fighting was inevitable, but in the end you both end up gravitating towards one another.”
“Sam likes you Sharon, he’s asked me a million things about you, but for some reason when it comes to even trying to ask you out, he starts to talk about everything but,” Steve was almost certain that when it came to Sam actually saying something, it was more along the lines of how Steve couldn’t really say anything to Tony for a long time, well until he found the one thing that Tony could help him with.
He didn’t wait for a reply, he just walked off, just the thought of him not being able to be a real leader anymore, the thought that he had let this all happen all because he hadn’t told Tony about his parents, that he hadn’t listened to Tony at all after the whole Ultron incident. He needed to make amends with it all, but he also needed to forgive himself for his past mistakes and he knew that it was going to take a long time to do so, and that wasn’t something that they really had a lot of.
“Language,” Tony answered only to earn a glare from Steve.
“Loki will be answering to Odin himself,” Thor said and Tony was glad that he had been taken back to Asgard along with the tesseract, because if Hydra had had two of the stones who knows where they would have been.
“What was that about,” Bucky asked him as Steve sat down on Bucky’s bed.
Tony sent her a thumbs up on the last one, ignoring the rest, god he was so tired, but he pointed at Steve so that the blonde could talk about what had happened. Steve took his hand in his and held the phone in the other while looking at Pepper.
“Sure, why not,” he said as they made it to the second-floor bathroom. “Now stand here while I get your bath ready, and please don’t tell your pops about what happened.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Tony said before getting back into the guts of the machine.
“Well, I want to know about Iron Man, but also... um... well I have an exam coming up and Bucky and I usually study together but he’s been a little preoccupied... with... well that girl he’s seeing, so I was thinking about something and then...,” why couldn’t he say anything, it was too much to just ask for help, or was it that it was Tony that he was talking to. He took a deep breath and just asked. “I hoped that you could help me.”
“Take the stairs,” Thor said, and Tony knew now that it was Thor’s little revenge for the Hulk hitting him during the battle.
“Steve, it’s freaking freezing outside we would die if we went camping tonight,” it really was, in the city it would be warmer than where they were, it always got colder the further upstate you went.
They were walking down the hallway when he noticed Tony sitting in a corner near the stairs, as if he had been waiting for Steve to leave. Their eyes met and Steve was certain that if he could have asked the guy out, he would have, there was something drawing him towards Tony Stark, but he could also tell that he was making the guy uncomfortable. Maybe Steve would try and become friends first before trying anything else, since it was better to fix the small problem that he had caused before attempting anything else.
“I’ve never seen anyone like it, I mean a character like it, so I found it a little interesting,” Steve told him and Tony smiled, it was different to have someone ask about Iron Man who didn’t know a single thing about the character himself.
“What, this is the warmest sweater I have,” Tony said in his own defense. “You said to dress warm.”
“I left yesterday,” he called out in his defense. “Sam, Sharon, this is Tony.”
“What was it like? Meeting Bucky’s parents?” Steve asked and Tony was actually curious about this, because Natasha hadn’t met anyone’s parents before.
“Anyway,” she said looking between Miles and Steve. “You already know her... I mean... well Miles was the one who introduced us, but for now we want to keep it quiet, because it’s new.”
“Oh my god,” Hope said getting ready to do what Bruce told her as baby Scott get sucked back into the machine.
“So, what does this mean, that he’s going to use his family’s name and money to get a better grade just because he helped me, what the hell,” Ty’s voice started getting higher and higher. “Where’s the fairness in that Professor, I’ve worked just as hard as he has, so he can’t take this from me.”
“Yes,” Hulk grunted at them, nodding at Thor who had backed down. “Bring friends back.”
“Boss, Shuri’s on the line,” FRIDAY said forcing the two of them to stop their own conversation.
“Why are you tell me this Steve?”
“Sir? I don’t understand,” Sitwell said, and he knew that this was the moment where he would hate himself for what he was about to do to his other self.
“Got to hustle, Winghead,” Tony said as he watched them pack everything up. Tony couldn’t help but marvel at how much everything had changed since that moment.
Tony was never sure about how much Rhodey remembered from that day, but he had let go, dated some random girls for a while that suspiciously looked like Carol and tried to move on. It wasn’t until he had heard about her dying that the man broke down crying once again, he was glad that she had had a happy life. Tony tried his best to be there for him for that, because he had been there for him when his parents died, and even more when Jarvis had died. That was when Rhodey had lost the happiness inside of himself and threw everything he could into his work. He had even become friends with Maria Rambeau and her daughter, who had been his last links to Carol Danvers. Even with only the memory, Tony remembered that there were times that Rhodey would just disappear, he would visit the Rambeau girls bringing them gifts and they would hang out, Rhodey usually helping out around the house, or at least that’s what he had told Tony.
That was the moment when the whole disaster of his life came crashing down, it was one thing for Steve and Bucky to know who he was, for his professors to know and keep it secret so that he could just be a regular person. But Ty knew, and Tony wasn’t sure why, but it hurt him even more, probably because he thought that for once in his life, he would get the chance at being normal, but of course the universe had other ideas.
The chairs were already set up when he walked into the room, Miles was in the corner setting up the drinks table, usually filled with whatever coffee beans that Tony had given them at the beginning of the month.
“Why would you try that?” she said as she stood up from where she was and walked over to him. “Why try so hard to bring him back when there’s nothing but pain in his future.”
He walked her to the quinjet and got her started when Vision joined them, “I would like to accompany you Ms. Romanoff,” he said, it was the first time since they got there that he spoke. Steve knew that Tony would want to talk to the android, but there was something in Vision’s eyes that told him to let the android go.
She nodded but curiously looking between the two of them, “I think as much as I would have wished you had been around all of these years, you no longer belong with us, do you?”
“Why is it complicated then?”
The sound of the door slamming against the wall alerted him to Bucky’s arrival, “Alright punk, let’s go,” Bucky said as he held the door open with his foot.
“I’ll be in the lab, most likely we’re going to test out that gauntlet the moment they finish, so I don’t want to be far from them, but yell for FRIDAY if you notice anything suspicious happening.”
“I know,” he said wondering where everything had gone wrong when it came to Clint. “Where are the kids?”
“I thought you couldn’t come,” Peter added as he rushed to meet his brother throwing his arms around Bruce.
“Like you’re one to talk,” she said and laughed at the redness rising on his neck. She knew for a fact that he still hadn’t done anything with Steve, he had told her that he wanted to wait just a little longer. Steve had been okay with it as well, so most of the time she just found them cuddling on the same bed from the year before, because instead of moving in with Steve, Tony had decided to stay in the same room as Bucky.
“Guys, what's up? What is it?” Scott asked looking between the two of them.
“Someone, who,” Harley said before his eyes landed on Tony. “Who’s the shorty?”
"Please.”
Bucky let out a frustrated huff after a few minutes, “I’m getting nothing,” he said dialing the phone again. “I’d never expected any of them to be without their phones.”
“Can you go with me to my family’s Christmas Gala?” Tony blurted out, it was weird, but in his heart, he wanted this he wanted Steve to meet his family.
As everything moves into place, Steve and Tony don't know where to move from here
“How does that tie up with your life Tony, how could you create something like that,” Steve looked a little horrified at the prospect that Tony had some kind of past that would inspire him enough to create something like this.
“Yeah, she took it when Bucky and I were together,” he said feeling a little embarrassed about it. “I was hoping that she would take our picture and put it up there too.”
“Bucky gave me a key,” Steve said that smile still on his face, his blue eyes distracting Tony enough before the words that Steve had said could sink in.
“Oh, it's just a book,” he said but Tony grabbed it and turned it over, seeing yet another history book.
“Mr. Stone, I am not nor have I ever been one to favor someone’s ability to pass my classes based on their family background, Mr. Stark is an exceptional student, as one with multiple majors is, his work is something I enjoy reading, I have also referred this to the dean of the English department, who has read through both stories as well as all of your other work and she has said that there are too many similarities for this to go unnoticed.”
“Need help,” Steve asked as he walked towards the genius, who looked like he hadn’t slept this whole time, which worried Steve a little.
“Well now I have to take you to the hospital, so it can be our second date,” he said without thinking, because he had really thought about the other night as their first even though they hadn’t kissed. He had wanted to, but he hadn’t been sure if Tony would have wanted him too, and permission was something that Steve valued.”
“Well it was a good punishment, but you’re not me, remember I’m a master tactician.”
“In the Hudson?”
“I know you don’t really want to see me,” Steve started, and Tony wasn’t sure if he could run fast enough to get away from Steve and this conversation. Steve well, one he was taller than him and he was also very athletic if the feel of those muscles the week before had been any kind of indicator. “I have to tell you something.”
“I’m allowed, I’m family,” Rhodey said to Tony before turning to Steve. “Trust me I’m not as bad as Pepper’s going to be when she hears about this.”
“He was in there for five hours,” Hope added to the conversation, “But when I pulled him out the timer on the suit said that he had only been inside for five seconds.”
“About an hour ago, I got a message from Nat saying that you were at home all alone tonight, and probably for the whole weekend, and that I should come save your stupid ass.”
“Give him some space and maybe on Wednesday you can come over, since it’s the one day he’s always been at the dorm, mainly because that’s usually when you’re there, so hopefully he’ll try and be there.”
In his head Tony was screaming, hell he was punching Ty in the face because that’s what he actually wanted to do, but he couldn’t have a scandal on his hands, he didn’t want to get expelled from school, instead he closed his bag and said “Goodbye Ty, I hope I never see you again.”
“Don’t worry Tony, they’re just clothes,” Steve said with a wink and Tony automatically made a mental note to buy the same set three times over just so they could be ripped off multiple times.
“You’re pretty,” he said and he knew at that moment that he was doomed but it felt nice just to say that to Steve so it didn’t really matter. “I liked you ever since I was twelve... did you know that you’re two years older than I am... everyone is older than me.”
"What, you gonna get a new haircut?” Rocket said and Steve knew that this was going to diverge quickly into a fight if they weren’t careful/
“Who picked their names,” Bucky said and when Tony just rolled his eyes at him, he continued. “Sorry but they sound more like Norse gods than regular rich kids.”
“Yeah, Thor played football in college, almost went pro too, he started up a company team and everything, so if you hurt her, he would actually tackle you to the ground,” Tony said with a smile, because it was one thing to do it for fun and another when Thor tackled someone when they pissed him off. Clint had broken his arm once because of it, but that was one of the hazards of being in their house.
“You know I wouldn’t have said anything if I had known someone would have heard about it,” Tony told him before they sat down at the table.
Dinner that night had been a loud and rowdy affair, mainly because they had a full house of people, friends and family alike. Tony was worried, Steve knew this because he felt the same way. They had both put a picture of their family in their suits, close to their hearts, because they needed the reminder of why they were trying to do this. Tony needed to bring back Peter for May Parker, Steve wanted Sam and Bucky back. Shuri, Hope, and Nebula wanted their families back, Natasha wanted her second chance with the man who had gotten away. Thor wanted to write a wrong, and Clint just wanted his wife back, as for everyone else, they were fighting for the family they had built together and lost at the same time. There was no turning back, not for any of them, they had invested their time into making this happen, and they were going to make sure nothing went wrong.
If there was one thing that Steve was certain of, it was that he wanted to take Tony out on a date, and with the semester winding down, he knew that they were both busy with literally everything. They hadn’t seen one another since that night, and he hated it, but Tony was stuck writing some massive paper, and Steve had work and his classes. He should have been angry about not being able to see Tony, but he was still flying high on the thought of Tony and him doing anything together, even if it meant that they were meeting each other’s families.
“Well, that didn’t work out now did it,” Steve said and it almost felt like he was going to fight back, as the other man stepped closer to him. Tony was so tired of fighting but it was just another reminder of what they were going to be to one another no matter what.
Quickly placing a kiss on Steve’s thigh, Tony moved to fit himself between Steve’s legs, his supplies placed just under Steve’s leg. “First, let’s give mini Cap his present before he gets to big for it,” his eyes meeting Steve as he said the words.
“Carol thinks Nebula isn’t who she says she is,” Steve said and Tony couldn’t believe what he was hearing, he knew something was off but he hadn’t gone that far. “And the kids showed up when I was talking to her, they were hiding in a closet.”
“Later Punk,” Bucky called just as the door closed behind the couple.
It had been two years since, and while Steve had only dated a few people, he couldn’t find someone he really liked, though Bucky had fallen for everyone, and broken a few hearts, he had said to Steve that it was a growing experience. To find and lose love, and he was looking for someone that interested him and would share the same experiences as he would, travel the world, eat at food stalls without getting sick.
Steve only smiled and said, “Okay Tony,” before taking his husband to bed.
Sighing, Tony went to his office area and sat down, pulling up the specs for the machine that Scott and Hope had been talking about. FRIDAY helping him generate model after model of the machine.
“On it,” Steve said over the comm, “Head to the lobby.”
It opened before he even got his keys out as two teenagers rushed out of the house tackling Steve and nearly toppling Tony over the porch steps. The two of them started talking a mile a minute and Steve couldn’t really keep up with them.
The birthplace of Captain America was something to behold, mainly because the bunker hadn’t existed when Steve had been there, but it was still a place that would change their future in more ways than they could have thought of. He wished at that moment that he could tell them that Hydra had infiltrated SHIELD but with everything that happened when they had gone to 2012, Tony wasn’t very keen on changing anymore of the past than was possible.
“I’m a mother Joe, I need to know so that my boys would be protected, if I left it up to you, they’d run wild like some crazy beasts of the wilder woods or something.”
Before he could chicken out, he put his hands on Tony’s face feeling a small bubble of happiness form in his heart, only the moon and the stars lighting up those beautiful brown eyes that have haunted him from the moment they met, the same ones that always looked at him with glee whenever he got a question right on one of Tony’s study sheets. He could feel the slight roughness on Tony’s face, that little bit of stubble that had grown because Tony hadn’t shaved. He felt Tony’s breath hitch, but there was no turning back for Steve, he couldn’t keep pining for Tony and second guessing himself, not when he was so close to what he wanted the most. He could see a future in Tony’s eyes, it was crazy and stupid, considering how different they were, but there was something more that he would get from it.
They didn’t talk about if for the rest of the night, Steve saw the look on Riri’s face when they had gone into the family room and sat down to watch the movie, the worried look in Kamala’s eyes as they ate dinner. The only one out of the loop was Miles who had gotten there just as dinner was being served, but Steve knew that his sister would tell him about what was happening. Secrets rarely stayed secret in their house, it was a rule for them, something that Steve had learned after Siberia, secrets weren’t allowed for any of them.
Steve couldn’t help but laugh, even when it felt like he was being judged but it was good that Tony had people who would stick up for him. “I remember that when he first started here, he was living off of iced coffees and whatever he kept in his mini fridge.”
“It’s a lot to think about,” he said to his husband. “We can’t mess it up or those timelines would be changed, like Bruce said their past would become our present, we don’t know just what we’re getting ourselves into.”
When he looked down, even with the little moon light coming in from the window, he could see Tony’s face on his chest as the genius snuggled into Steve. He couldn’t help but smile at the way Tony’s face looked so relaxed, and he could swear he could hear him mumbling though what he was saying was lost in Steve’s shirt. He didn’t know what had woken him up, but it was worth it just to see Tony so comfortable in his arms. He stared at him a little longer, before trying to snuggle into Tony’s hair, taking in the scent of Tony’s coconut shampoo, wanting more but he was honestly afraid of what would happen if he even tried to kiss the Tony.
Steve usually took morning duty on the weekdays, making breakfast after his run, waking the kids up for school, and driving them there before going to work on another project, usually painting or heading over to NAF to talk to Natasha about their progress, before heading back and picking the kids up on his way home. Tony was on night duty, cooking dinner, helping with homework, as well as Morgan duty, who was a happy toddler now that she had people around her to care for her. He knew that the orphanage tried their best, but with so many kids it was a lot harder than anyone would imagine.
“off course, how can we help?”
“I know you got a lot on the line. You got Cap, Nat, even a daughter. But I lost someone very important to me. A lot of people did.”
“not at the moment, no”
Her question cut short with Steve coughing and he grabbing his drink “sorry, noddle went straight to wrong hole” he let out two more cough before emptying his drink
“no” she snuggled closer
“Alive and otherwise what we needed was a suit of Armor around the world! Remember that time? Whether it impacted our precious freedoms or not?
“Steven” Sarah tried her best to calming her son “take a deep breath. Let the doctor speak”
“No telling. He has the Power and Space Stones, that already makes him the strongest creature in the whole universe. If he gets his hands, on all six Stones, Tony. We need to find Vision”
“is that what you really want to do?”
“Tony what are talking about?” Steve looks at him, an unreadable expression on his face.
The hologram of Rhodey looking at her reluctantly before he nods and signed off. Leaving her alone in the room silently chewing her tears and eat her feelings through the sandwich. She sniffled and quickly wiped her tears away when she hears an abrupt little patter coming to her.
“not yet”
“ooh, this is your daughter” Steve passed her to Happy but Morgan squirms
The screen showing a man with robe waving his finger throwing huge tornado on the street clearing the dust and winking at Tony, Showing a begrudgingly amused Tony for a split second. Natasha grabs the remote to rewind, zoomed and slowed the screen.
“oh damn it, I am so sorry, oh shit I just said damn. Oh crap, I mean…”
“that must be scary”
A young boy standing at the door, panting “I had to go back, you leave the door car open” he waves the car keys on his hand
“I found a good one for me and my kids” Steve smiled
For the first time in his life Steve saw Natasha looked so surprised and out of words. Well, that’s new. To her credit its only last for a second or two and she’s back to her usual calm and collected self.
“Consequences?”
“can we focus on the mission first and commenting about my ass later?”
“thanks” Steve whispered when tony give him his drink “is everything Scott just told us is really possible?”
Smiled amusedly at his boyfriend antic, Tony glanced at the dog who are walking toward him and sniffing his shoes, tails wagging hard. Tony kneeled in front of the dog to and carefully pet the head, and to both Tony and Steve surprised, the dog snuggled closer to Tony’s lap and rolled his belly asking for rub.
He turned behind him and took Anthony’s right hand and kissed the knuckles. “Shall we head out my darling?” Steve spoke in a way that had a drawl in his voice and there seemed to be a lot of contractions in his words.
“Wait. That opening.” Hope said softly.
As soon as he gets down the stairs into the main lobby, there’s a dog barking that Anthony sees that looks like his dog that died recently.
“Steve...I still can’t believe that Howard is finally gone. I don’t have to live in fear anymore.” Tony spoke as his hands shook a little
Soon, Anthony gets a text and call from Scott which gets his attention.
“Uh...Steve, how will everything you said go?” Anthony asked as he stared at the butterfly still on his finger before looking at Steve.
Shadows: Hey everyone! Thank you all so much for all the lovely comments on the first chapter. I hope you all enjoy this next one. Happy reading!
Steve turned to the man with the cape. “And you are?”
“Right,” Tony replied, all business. There was so much that needed to be said between them, but this wasn’t the time or the place. At the moment, they had a job to do. “Guess we’d better get inside and start planning.”
, he thought to himself. Steve looked down at the ring on his hand. He realized the suit he was wearing had also come from Tony. Maybe that was why he continued to wear it, despite its ratty state. He wondered what Tony would think of them if he could see them now. Would he tell them they deserved it and to accept the consequences of their choices? Would he help them? Would he be at all willing to accept them, accept
Having jobs kept the pack busy and satisfied. But even though everyone was busy, Tony and Steve still noticed that there was something going on with their pups.
There was one incident where they were spending a few days in an old cabin on the outskirts of Pittsburg when they caught whiff of HYDRA. The only reason they were even staying in a place for more than one night was because Tony hadn’t been feeling well. Tony’s health and wellbeing had to come first.
After the meeting, everyone heads off with Steve and Tony heading in the direction of their bedroom.
Shadows: Here’s some fluff for the Endgame anniversary. We all need it. Enjoy!
The question threw him for a loop. His team still needed to assess what just happened here. He also knew he could be arrested on setting foot back in the States, but he trusted that Tony wasn’t setting him up for a trap.
“Tony...I’m so sorry and I should have reacted that way to you. I already feel so shameful.”
“Now come with me Anthony, there is a matter we must get to.” Steve whispered into Anthony’s ears as he caressed his neck with one of his hands.
After they all had a quick after school snack, all 7 of Tony and Steve’s kids finally found the courage to talk about what has been happening at school.
Tony spotted a hardware store and went inside. He went up and down the aisles picking up a 9 piece wrench set, a 50 Phillips head screws set with some screwdrivers to match the head, work goggles, face masks, and safety gloves. After checking out, Tony headed to a nearby store to get some food for the cabin. He picked out some fruit, vegetables, bread, milk, and other foods that everyone wanted in the cabin. After he checked out with the food, Tony started making his way back to the cabin.
“I know, but I want to. For you. If you want to.”
That’s when Tony decides to take matters into his own hands. He looked around the room and found an excellent sword and made his way to the stables. When he arrives, Tony finds a horse that is currently tied up, gets a saddle on the horse, climbs on, and rides off to go help Steve.
Steve was about to respond to Natasha further when he noticed it. It was Wanda and Vision, and it appeared something was attacking them. Something...not of this world. He gave Nat and Sam a signal, and they all got in position to attack.
The past 3 months of traveling had been crazy. With Tony now pregnant, he had to be careful of what he was doing. Thankfully he had a strong mate and packmates to protect him from harm. It definitely made things easier that was for sure.
“Just delete it, okay?” Hope said before the phone hangs up.
“He’s unmated. What claim do you have?” snarled the other Alpha who was dark in color. He too crouched down and prepared to pounce.
Shadows: Well… this is just about one of the strangest things I’ve ever written. I really have nothing to say for myself. I tried. Beware the smut below. Chapter title is from
Emmie: Here’s to another chapter guys. Hope you all enjoy it.
“It feels so relaxing and a calm thing to look at Steve.”
Although that was looking less and less likely the more Tony complained about the little pains he was feeling.
Anthony watches the T.V. coverage a little bit before deciding to head out.
“Tony. My name is Tony. What’s your name?” said Tony while rubbing his head on the golden wolf’s.
“Tony can’t shift back to his human form and I’m scared,” fretted Steve as he cuddled his mate close to him in his human form.
“How soon can you get to New York?” Tony asked, without a hint of pleasantry in his voice.
“Please Steve, Please. I want this so bad.” Anthony said as he arched his back.
His eyes felt heavy and watched Steve sit above him before leaning down to say against his ear in a whisper “You’ve made me very happy dear, I’ll see you when you wake up.” before he couldn’t keep them open any longer and felt his vision fade into darkness.
“You can’t just hole up in your room forever. Come out and help with some cleaning before guests arrive.” Maria said outside of Anthony’s door.
When he gets back to the river, Rhodey and Pepper had caught quite a number of fish and Happy had found a few things that could be useful to them.
“That’s really not necessary.”
“Tony’s pregnant,” said Bruce in a calm manner while he looked back down at Tony.
Shadows: Happy Pi Day! Enjoy this chapter and stay safe and warm out there!
often, before.
“Oh god.” Tony said when he looked at what was in front of him.
Steve’s emotions were too strong for him to speak as he watched Tony slide the ring back on his finger. Tony stood up and brought Steve in for a kiss. The kisses became more fervent, and soon Tony’s mouth was all over Steve’s face and neck.
“Anthony.”
“These two kids are Pietro and Wanda Maximoff that we share classes or activities with,” Rowan spoke.
But if Howard had his way that would never happen. In the middle of the night, Tony shifted into his wolf form and disappeared from the house in the blizzard coming down. With the heavy snow and winds, Tony tried his best to navigate the terrain but it was getting difficult. He was also starting to get hungry. But hunger wasn’t new to Tony. He’d know it his whole life, so he continued to trudge on.
“We meet again King Howard.” Steve says, showing no sign of weakness.
Steve and his team were checking on Wanda and Vision. The last communication from Wanda implied they were in Scotland, which was why they found themselves there now.
“But Steve, there’s something that I want to do. Since you wanted to treat me like I’m a rare jewel, I want to do something for you.” Tony said as he slid down on his knees and looked up at Steve from where he was on the floor.
Tony shrugged. “Well, Peter was already a good kid when I met him. That’s a little different than raising a kid from a younger age.”
“And you’re the wolf that responded to my howl.” said the golden wolf as he rubbed his head on Tony’s. “So what’s your name? Now that I’ve found my mate, I want to know who they are.”
Here's the song that inspired this chapter a little:
“Alright guys, time to move out,” Rhodey said as they got into formation. Rhodey and Pepper lead while Tony and Happy followed behind them.
“Not that I’m not happy for you,” T’Challa added, “but perhaps you should save that for later? I can even provide you with your own bedroom.”
“Thank you Steve.” Tony said with his back turned. That kind of made Steve’s heart sink. He was trying to help make up for the past few years, which wouldn’t be easy, and he just felt like Tony was ignoring him in slight ways like this.
“Your majesties, King Howard and his army are coming.”
It’s Junior rising star skater Harley Keener from the United States.
Pepper then bursts into his room.
“But mommy, it’ll make the skater internet so happy!” Cassie said.
“Tony, are you ok?” Steve spoke, feeling worried.
Every chance Steve had, he would be cuddling Tony and trying to lick and sniff his belly. The fact that he was going to be a father brought him so much joy still. He wondered how his parents would feel if he told them that they would become grandparents. His mother Sarah always told him that there was an Omega out there for him and the time would be right when he would find that Omega for him to be his mate and have pups. His father Joseph was proud of his Alpha son even if he was small at first because he knew that his Steven would become something great and that no one should judge an Alpha, Beta, or Omega by their size.
“We have a wedding to plan Anthony, let us be on our way.” Steve said as he took Anthony’s hand and led them over to the door.
Someone who was watching the video of Anthony performing the routine was Steven himself who was sitting on his couch with his dog. Seeing the way Anthony skated has Steven’s interest peaked.
After they departed from the cabin earlier in the day, everyone besides Happy, who was driving the truck, was walking alongside when they got on the highway and continued their journey to the east coast.
Not even 2 minutes later, Anthony and Pepper come through the door of the villa and Maria sees the two.
“Everything looks fine but I would advise that you eat and rest well to see if things will improve.” The healer said while helping Tony stand up and guiding him over to Steve.
“I do?” Tony responded, more curious than anything else. “What makes you say that?”
“What’s wrong?” asked Tony as Steve came over and started checking him over and scenting him.
‘What a clown. Why doesn’t he retire already?” Harley said as he watched the video with his coach, Nick Fury, yelling at him.
“I would like for you to call me Tony, it’s much easier to remember.”
While all 9 pups in the house were working themselves throughout the school year, the adults in the mansion were also working.
“Well my dear, you are now a vampire. You were asleep for 13 hours here while your body changed. You took everything very well and it made me very happy.”
“Ok, “Me, Tarzan, You, Bitch.”” says Happy as he read the first white card which IMMEDIATELY brings laughter among everyone. “Me, Tarzan, You, A bag of cats.” says Happy as he read the next white card which brings out a little laugh among them. “Me, Tarzan, You, A sad fat dragon with no friends.” says Happy as he read the last white card which brings out more laughter than the last card but not as much as the first card.
“I...I...I’ve never done anything like this before Steve.” Anthony spoke in a soft demenner.
Emmie: I can’t believe I typed this much, it’s a new record for me. Anyways, thanks for all the love for this fic. Also, we’ve decided to tease something for a future chapter in here. Can you guess what it is?
Tony is riding carefully through the woods, being on the lookout for Steve or anyone. Soon after he can hear sounds of shouting and swords clashing. Something told Tony that Steve must be nearby. After emerging from the woods, Tony can see the battle going on and is disturbed by all the bloodshed he sees. But something that Tony sees something that changes his tone immediately.
They did spend time discussing it, as each of them had concerns about the potential quality of their parenting skills, as well the danger of their jobs. In the end, they came to the conclusion that they both wanted to raise a family. They just weren’t sure how. Adoption? Using a surrogate mother? It was Thor who came up with an interesting, if unorthodox solution. He had overheard the two of them discussing their options, and told them of an ancient Asgardian spell that would allow one of them to become pregnant. Thor assured them it would be safe and only temporarily alter the anatomy long enough to carry a child.
“St… Steven… Why are you here?” Anthony spoke while in shock still.
“My sweetheart, are you alright?” Steve asked, worried about his bride.
Pretty soon, Natasha walked over to them and said: “Hey guys, it’s time for bed. We got to keep moving tomorrow.”
“I think you might be selling yourself a little short.” Steve didn’t want Tony to feel pressured if he didn’t want or wasn’t ready for a family yet, so he continued, “It’s okay if that’s not something you want right now, but if you ever do, I’d love to start a family with you.”
Steve had sent Tony a burner phone and a letter, letting him know that Tony could call him if he needed Steve for any reason. After all this time, the phone still had no calls on it. Clearly Tony was doing just fine without him.
And can you guys take a guess at what the beginning part of the next chapter will be? You'll just have to read until the end. Have fun!
Steve reached over to one of the dressers by the bed and pulled out a bottle of oil. He opened it and poured a little on his hands before rubbing it on his penis.
“Hey there Tony,” said Bucky as he got close to him.
After their babies went to school for the day, Tony and Steve just sat at the table in the dining room with cups filled with coffee. They were both just staring at their cups of coffee before Steve decided to speak up.
Tony considered that for a minute. “Tell you what, we’ll talk more about this later, yeah?”
The fight got violent quickly. Sounds of swords clashing can be heard very clearly and the sounds of agony are heard as people are being cut, stabbed, and mortally wounded. Steve then has his eyes set on King Howard, who sees him as well. They charged at each other knowing that this could very well be the deciding factor in the battle.
Emmie: This is it everyone, the final chapter. Hope you all will love it. Song for this chapter is from H2O: Just Add Water:
"Well then, I hope I'm not misreading this," Tony replied as he got down on one knee, holding the ring out to Steve. Steve held his breath, his heart pounding so loud he was sure Tony could hear it. "Steven Grant Rogers, my dearest beloved, will you marry me? And we’ll make it stick this time?"
In the aftermath, Steve gets up, still clutching his slide, and stares Tony in the eyes.
“Sorry, we’re closed. You can come back tomorrow.” said Hope Van Dyne who was putting away some ice skates.
“While I’m upset that you didn’t stay where I asked you to, I’m grateful that you came out here and saved my life.”
“”I won, didn’t I? So who really cares? Quit nagging me already.” Harley said as he walked with Steve over to their coach Nick Fury.
I apologize for nothing new as I got a job and it's been taking me away from writing since I like to have a lot of personal time to write so I can put out the best stuff I can write. Also writing down from the subtitles of each episode is hard so if there's an easier way of finding where to look and transcripts of each episode of Yuri on Ice, that would be really helpful.
“A few hours probably. We just-”
“Leave me alone, I’m not interested in you Alpha,” said Tony as he’s was getting very uncomfortable from the Alpha in front of him.
Emmie: The pups are coming in this chapter guys, be ready for some fluffy cuteness. Warning: this chapter does describe the graphic birth of the pups so if you get grossed out, skip to the end.
That wasn’t the case.
Shadows: Well, this is the end. It’s been quite the journey. I’m really happy with how this turned out. It was a pleasure working with Emmie throughout this. I hope you all enjoyed this little story of ours. Drop us a comment and keep an eye out for any of our future works! I know I’ve got a few going! Thank you for reading!!!
Today is the day, today is the day that King Howard and his army will attack the Hydra kingdom and try to take back Tony.
“I’d love to, but is it still coming down hard?” asked Tony, still reeling from when he nearly died in the storm.
Steve definitely felt a tear or two trail down his face.
“Darling, I want to see you open your eyes.” Steve spoke softly which Anthony does and looks at the way Steve towers over him. He saw how Steve’s hands and cock were shiny with something.
“Morgan. I like it,” Steve replied with a smile. “I was thinking of Sarah, after my Ma.”
“What is it my sweetheart?” Steve said as he took hold of Anthony’s hands.
“But Steve, there is something on my mind. I’m still nervous about being a parent after everything that has happened.”
As soon as the healer announced the news, Steve felt like he could fly to the moon and back. He pulled Tony into his lap and started kissing him like there was no tomorrow.
After I finish this fic, I'll be working on my next fic project and school. See you guys in the next chapter. Enjoy!
“Ah-ah!” The priest said jokingly, stopping them before they were able to do so, “Wait for me to say the words this time.” He paused and made them wait while the congregation laughed. “You may now kiss your husband.” At that, Steve wasted no time drawing Tony in.
After the meeting with Steve’s army, Steve is cuddling Tony, who is crying, in their room together while whispering sweet things in his ear.
“Whoa! Did you see that jump? No, make that two jumps.”
“We are my dear Tony, I just know you’ll be a wonderful mother to our future child.” Steve said as he came up from behind Tony on the bed and hugged him from behind.
“Really? You don’t mind?”
Emmie: The triplets are 1 year old now. YAY!!!
Emmie: Get ready guys, there’s going to be some juiciness to this chapter towards the end.
Tony then turned to Steve, “You guys probably need new gear, yeah? Steve, you first. Follow me.” Tony turned and Steve followed him down to the workshop. Looked like he was finally going to be alone with Tony for a few minutes. Steve wondered whether that was good or bad.
“This is far enough Howard, you are not going to harm Steve any further and I’m not going back to be married off to someone I don’t love.”  Tony says fearless with his eyes glowing slightly red.
Steve and Tony excused themselves to a private room where they stripped naked and immediately started passionately kissing. They moved over to the bed where Tony landed on his back with Steve on top of him.
Tony was already 3 months along when they entered the next state on their journey: Illinois.
Tony bares his fangs and eyes flash red as he whips out his sword and stabs Howard in the neck which results in said person clutching his neck and falling to his knees
This led into a brief explanation from Bruce, Tony, and Strange what the Infinity Stones were and who was after them, along with what he planned to do with them.
“Hey. I’ll be competing in the senior division next year. Maybe it’s time for you to retire. I don’t think we need two Yuris in the same bracket. Loser!” Harley speaks before heading out of the bathroom.
As the figures got closer he closed his eyes again. The last thing he felt was safety and warmth. That wasn’t such a bad way to go out.
“Isn’t the creek a beautiful thing of nature Anthony?”
Emmie: Time for a chapter with the babies. Here’s the song that this chapter title shares with:
“Don’t worry my dear, you will be a wonderful mother to our children. We must tell the kingdom at once ” Steve said as he kissed Tony on the lips before he helped Tony back into his dress. They then left the room of the healer fairly quickly.
‘Are you staying in Detroit?”
Emmie: Hope you guys are liking how the fic is progressing so far, be ready because there’s more to come.
After much discussion with Steve, Bruce, and Helen, Tony did agree to the spell that would allow him to carry his and Steve’s child. Bruce and Helen would be expecting Tony and Steve for regular visits as the pregnancy proceeded. Steve did everything he could to help Tony out as he got farther along. Tony kept a low public profile and mostly stayed at the Compound to avoid any prying eyes that could find him in the city. They were elated when they learned that they were actually having twins, two girls.
“Steve, I care about you and I was worried about you and couldn’t bear to wonder what might happen to you.”
After 1 hour passed, the candles burned out and Steve watched the smoke rise from what remained of the candles and patiently waited for Anthony to wake up.
“I’m ready your Majesty.” Anthony spoke as he put his hand on Steve’s waist.
“I wanted to look around the forest and then I saw this wolf on one of the cliffs nearby. Didn’t get to talk to him but he looked beautiful. Had this amazing golden coat of fur.” said Tony as he got right next to Rhodey.
Tony hadn’t mentioned the ring again since he first noticed it, but Steve caught him continuing to glance at it. Whether that meant Tony was considering his feelings for Steve or working up the courage to ask for it back, Steve couldn’t tell. He knew Tony wasn’t totally relaxed around him yet, despite their earlier shenanigans in Shuri's lab, however Tony’s somewhat friendlier attitude toward him since discovering the ring gave him hope.
Steve thought about it for a minute. “I’m actually not opposed to the idea. We would probably need Dr. Cho and Bruce to keep an eye on us if we went through with it, just in case.”
“This Omega is protected. Back the FUCK OFF!” snarled the golden Alpha as blood ran from his mouth. Tony looked up and saw that the darker Alpha had a large bite wound on his shoulder and was panting heavily. The golden Alpha appeared completely unharmed,
“You bet I do”, Tony responded, looking at Steve. “Because I’m not half as good at anything as I am when I’m doing next you, and that’s the truth.”
“I remember when I was an intern, she overheard Justin Hammer called me a nurse because I’m the only girl in the surgical program. She made him doing scut work on ER for a week with no help from other nurses.”
“Tony –“
“that explain why she told me to bring this food” Steve holding up clear plastic bag with colourful containers stacked inside
like what Tony used to do when we all playing Mario Kart”
“until your ears bleed”
“how vague?”
“Five years ago, we lost. All of us. We lost friends... We lost family... We lost a part of ourselves. Today, we have a chance to take it all back. You know your teams, you know your missions. Get the stones, get them back. One round trip each. No mistakes. No do-overs. Most of us are going somewhere we know. But it doesn't mean we should know what to expect. Be careful. Look out for each other. This is the fight of our lives. And we're gonna win.” Steve can feel the look Tony gives him. How bad he wanted to hold the man standing next to him, giving him the giddy optimism smile that Steve missed dearly. Staring back at the chocolate orb he once called home “Whatever it takes. Good luck.”
“Well, it looks like we're improvising.”
“Just open the door, Steve. I want to meet the other guy in your life. Making sure the competition wasn’t too rough” Tony smirked at his boyfriend.
“poor girl, one moment you’re on swing and the next you’re on the ground with open wounds”
“will he turn red and breathe fire?” Rhodey guard is up when hearing the word “Extremis”
my food? Come on, Dodge”
“Oh baby, I could easily replace you with a vibrator. It can make me come and didn’t even talked back at me” Tony smirked when he saw a small frown start forming on Steve forehead. He wrapped his hands on Steve’s neck and pulled him closer for another kiss
“be careful, Morgan don’t just run like that” she can hear Steve exasperated sigh being ignored by his own daughter. Wiping out her excess tears from her face she greeting them
“pull the pin, now!”
“Alright, alright! Calm your horses, Dodge. Food is coming” Tony laughed at the dog antics “sorry soldier, your demanding son is hungry” he leaned on his tip toe to give a quick peck on Steve lips before walking to the pantry with Dodger behind him, wagging his tails.
he bit his inner check trying not to let out -not-so-manly high pitch giggle, when the blonde man start to blushing furiously, face all red. “it’s fine. it was nice actually to talk to someone who aren’t going to ask for funds or checking a mole once in a while”
“I’m… I’m fine” he exhales and falls to the gound
“F.R.I. lock the room”
Steve gulped and moved forward pouring him water and tilting the straw to his mouth
. I had a long talk with Nat, and Sam. I get it now, I can see everything from your side. I can see how I hurt you. I was trying to find way for all us are fine, but I get it now, it doesn’t work that way. I want to… I want to fixed everything. I want to fix us… if you let me” Steve reached for his hand but stopped halfway. Unsure what to do, he settles with lay his hand touching the bed. Their fingers almost touch. Steve glance at Tony, already back to sleep. He just sighed and leaned back at the chair, resting his eyes.
“thank you for the pep talk Lilliputian, you really know how to boost morale” Tony looked back at Steve “do you trust me?”
“I'm not getting that shield back, am I?”
“a closure?”
“why did Tony hide her?”
“still beautiful as the moment we first met.” Steve tried to smile, but only comes out as wistful grimace
“oh my god, I am so sorry buddy. I was in panic”
Steve clenches his jaw and exhaled the breath he’s holding
“No. He lived in Toronto. Were you even paying attention?” Tony looking at the screen “F.R.I.D.A.Y. show us the first time that Squidward came to earth. I think we secure enough city cam from the internet. It was on his necklace”
“good morning Rogers, we’re here to do rounds. Number two, you can present the case”
Scott is cutting his orange slices next to Natasha who sitting next to him writing notes on the progress. The best part of being the brain in a group project is you got to tell the muscle of the group to do stuff. Looking at the other guys grabbing the big metal board, panels, and cables. Watching
thanks for reading
“SHIT”
“positive”
“you too Rhodey” Noticing his leg braces, feeling a pang of guilt in his stomach “listen I-“
“oh hello Big Rogers –“
“is he
“Peter and Shuri are friends now” Steve shudders “together with Morgan are becoming the terrible three”
“there’s been a change of plans. I just got a call from the Secretary. I'm gonna be running point on the sceptre.
Tony looking around at the avenger tower feeling nostalgic, hand sliding and touching the surface. Scanning the interior of the living room
Before Tony himself had become Iron Man, he remembered the day that Rhodey had gotten a frantic call from Monica Rambeau, her mother had gone missing during a mission, like with Tony, Rhodey searched for Maria, she had become a sister to him and he didn’t want to let Monica down, the woman’s body had been recovered soon after. He had lost a friend after that, and Tony had been so involved in himself that he hadn’t been there for Rhodey. Tony wasn’t sure what had happened to Monica after the snap, but the reappearance of Carol Danvers was going to throw so much of the man’s equilibrium out of place that Tony wasn’t sure about how his friend was going to survive this new development.
“I knew,” she said smiling at her boyfriend picking the broccoli off of his shirt and eating it. “But then again Tony is too smart of his own good, so it was good that he held back, plus the undergrads aren’t allowed to stay in the labs overnight, only the Grad students were, so how you didn’t put two and two together I can never figure out.”
“A time heist?” Scott said, admittedly embarrassed by the whole thing.
“For now, let’s take care of the Thanos problem, we’ll figure out the rest as we go,” Steve said before touching the side of Tony’s face. “Don’t die on me today.”
“Take care of them,” he said watching as the others were standing out in the hallway, suited up and ready. “I’ll be here waiting some food when you get back.”
“Look, I know that I'm way outside my paygrade here. But she still isn't here, is she?” Clint said defensively, Tony knew that this could go south quickly, with the pain of her death too fresh in their minds.
“Oh god that was real,” he said as the memory of Steve staying with him came back. All of the things he had said, he really should have had a muzzle on his face.
“It’s Quantum Physics Steve,” he said, and he knew it sounded childish while he said it, but Steve just smiled at him.
“Tony, I get it. And I'm happy for you, I really am,” Natasha said as Steve walked over to him without saying another word. “But this is a second chance.”
“Yesh,” he said before pulling out his phone, he remembered the night before how Steve had looked at the thing in awe, mainly because it was the only one of its kind, Tony had made it for himself alone because he hated the way most smartphones looked. Tony pressed a couple of buttons before the screen lit up with the call and handed it over to Steve, who was even more surprised when Pepper’s face popped up.
Sometimes.... things happen that are beyond our control, and other times Steve has to stop Natasha from killing someone, even when Tony gets hurt in the process.
“The Aether,” Shuri said motioning towards the display. “Tell us about it.”
“She was in love with Bucky,” Steve said walking into the room, taking in the scene in front of him. “She told me during one of those days when I had stopped here, hell she told me the day you came back on that ship looking like you hadn’t eaten or slept in weeks.”
“Let me please because if I know anything, it’s that this whole thing is one giant misunderstanding.”
“You always have help,” Hope answered.
“It’s Iron Man,” Tony told him, though it feels like he’s revealing something about himself. “I created him a long time ago, I write stories about him and Captain America being friends and helping one another.”
“He’ll be alright,” Valkyrie said next to Nebula. “He needs to let out everything he has inside of himself, everything he’s been holding back. So, this was actually good for him.”
He couldn’t help but panic at the thought of losing his kids, his breaths were labored as he thought about them being crushed under all of the rubble. Then he thought of Steve and whether he would have survived something like that and he could feel something inside of him break a little. He couldn’t lose all of them, not like this, especially not knowing what the hell had happened. He started hyperventilating, he couldn’t help but panic because after all they’ve been through for this to happen. It took him a moment to get his breathing under control, he couldn’t afford to lose his mind at the moment. He needed to assess the situation and figure out what happened. The last thing he remembered was Carol yelling something over the com line to Steve.
As everyone says their goodbyes, Steve is getting ready to move forward, except Rhodey’s still there and Steve’s worried as he hears them talking about Clint leave a pile of bodies in Mexico, Steve had seen the man with his kids not too long ago, but he hadn’t seen them since and now he was worried.
It was the train wreck that this was his life, he had worked on this and now someone was taking it away from him. Just like him and Steve had been close to being something and someone took that from him too. He couldn’t figure out where he had gone wrong with everything, or why this kept happening to him. Taking his laptop from Ty, he sent the story off to him, he didn’t care about it anymore, it would just be a reminder of something else that he thought he had with another person, someone he thought of as a friend, Ty could have it.
“Did you understand that?” Tony asked him and Steve said yes, he had the notes Tony had written up for him so he could just study them later.
It was a few hours later, as he looked at the device in the back of Scott’s van, with Hope there calibrating the whole device, Bruce and Shuri working around Tony’s theory. Where Steve was wondering if it was a good idea at all.
“What does your mom do now that you and Natasha are in college?”
“I am actually, it’s new but I know that he won’t hurt me,” Tony said, and he knew in his heart that it was true. “And before you ask why I’m so sure of this, well look at Bucky, who even after their break-up Steve would still want to be friends with him.”
“I feel like my family does nothing compared to yours.”
“Mr. Stone has had problems before, mostly with certain situations that I am not at liberty to discuss, he was on his last warning, what happened here would have reflected poorly on him if not for what you said. You are a very wise young man Mr. Stark, it reflects itself in your writing and even in your fanfiction,” Professor Coulson said with a smile and Tony couldn’t believe what he was hearing. “I am a fan of what you’ve written, even though I don’t allow that kind of work in the classroom, but you have the ability to create something not only from original characters but existing ones, it’s a gift.”
“Fine, but I have the right to ask you for the most expensive pair of shoes for Christmas,” she said pouting. “And a necklace for May.”
“What,” he said fixing his glasses and pushed the little curl away from his face. “I’m blind without them, and I like that no one notices me, it makes it easier to just be me, and not what my father wants me to be.”
“No not really, Tony was just going to help me out with some stuff for that math class, so you can take it,” Steve said and Tony didn’t want to think too much about them being alone together, not after the conversation they had just had. They were just friends nothing more.
Somewhere in the compound, Tony knew that there were other couples having the same conversation, they were all on a preverbal suicide mission. They all had people who loved them and cared for their safety, Tony wasn’t sure if he would survive if something happened to any of them. They were his family, the one built from scraps. Losing wasn’t an option, not anymore, because they had already lost, and once had been enough for all of them.
“Fine, I’ll tell him,” he said admitting defeat. “But now you have to help me clean up the mess in the garage, because I’m pretty sure DUM-E and U made it worse while we were showing.”
“Anyway,” she said turning to Bruce. “Guys, if you pick the right year, there are three stones in New York.”
“I want to stay,” he said looking over at Tony, still a little worried about his nose. “I don’t know if he’s told you.”
“I mean, he helped me edit but I wrote the story,” Ty said defending his work. “He only did maybe twenty percent of the work.”
Tony couldn’t help but notice how long Steve had been gone, Carol had pulled him aside and Tony knew for certain this had something to do with Nebula. There was something off about her, she had become friends with Natasha over the years but hadn’t reacted to her death, she hadn’t shown any emotion at all even though she had grown over the years. It was a little disconcerting to him to see her acting that way, it was almost as if she had become another person.
Shuri’s face blinked into life in front of him, she smiled at him and he could see nothing but glee in her eyes. “He’s awake,” she said and Tony felt himself stiffen.
Steve couldn’t help but sigh, they had grown up in a small town in upstate New York, the population was miniscule compared to other parts of the state, so they dated, though once they went off to college Bucky had realized that there was more to their lives than their small town and the two of them decided to break up. Bucky had dated around since, and so had Steve or at least he tried, they both grew from their experiences and realized that they were better as friends over being in a relationship. Much to his mother’s delight, because while she had been happy that Steve got to date, she didn’t think that Bucky was the best choice, not because she didn’t love him, she just knew that it wouldn’t have worked out in the end.
“Steve, we got word that King Howard from the Stark kingdom has found out that Tony is here and is mobilzing his army to take him back.”
It was at that moment when he was still trying to catch his breath that Steve’s phone went off, showing that Tony was calling him. He nearly dropped it in his haste to answer.
"What?" It had been a few weeks, and the Avengers and rogue Avengers had been working at cleanup in Wakanda. Steve thought that they had been making progress at getting back together, especially after their escapade from a few nights ago, but now Tony wanted the ring back?
“Tony, what's going on? Tell me you found that cube.” Steve heart raced when he heard the loud bang and Tony cursing “Oh, you gotta be shitting me.” He groans looking at his old 2012 self standing in front of him.
He opened the box to find
“I think you did more than better”
“somebody better be dying!”
he wants to run, great plan”
“remember when we were kids and avoiding girls thinking we might get cooties? I’m telling you, it was a lot more fun taking it out and playing with the cooties”
She nodded “want dada”
“oh my god Mr. Stark I don’t need to hear that. Morgan, let’s go” Peter rushed in panic and dragging Morgan with him. Leaving Tony and Steve chuckled when Morgan demand Peter to explain what’s the meaning of
“hi squirt” he waves back, not moving from the door “I know I’m the last person you want to see, but I got pardoned and my court mandated therapy suggest me to making amends, so I will start with you. Just two minutes, and then I will be gone from your life for good. My name is James Buchanan Barnes, I’m no longer The Winter Soldier, and you’re my part of making amends. So, I’m sorry. For your father”
“and now the table has turned. Consider this as holiday, we needed the break, since… everything”
Steve went back to his bedroom to grab his hoodie to search the neighborhood and stopped at the sight in front of him, a sleeping Dodger hugging Tony’s abdomen. The relieve sigh turned into scowl when he saw dodger is sleeping on
“Papa said we won. Daddy saved the world. Happy said daddy is kicking bad guy butt”
“hi Mr Stark”
“no dada?”
Sanctum Sanctorum
“Morgan, right? Hi again. I’m Steve”
“slipped out?” Tony let out thin smile “its ok. How’s your head? With all the crying you must be dehydrated.” Tony give him the water on the table “come here” he pats a spot next to him “can we talked about yesterday?”
“bye Steeb” she waved at Steve and they leave the room
Tony grab Morgan’s hand and twirled together off beat. His moved stopped when they saw the pairs of eyes watching them “oh hi, you guys are back” out of breath, he turned the music down “what?” he looking at them confusedly
“What happened?” Tony looked at him worried when Dodger come closer to his leg between them.
“I may not looked like it, but this position put me in pinch too, I hate this as much as you are,
Tony opened his eyes, felt groggy and not adjusted to the light. Try his best looking around, to find Morgan napping at the couch near him. Gosh I missed my jellybean, he sighed.
“I saw a kid Buck, in New York”
The dog only looks at him and lay his head on top of his lap
“What were the insults said?” asked Steve worriedly. He really hoped they weren’t that bad.
“Look, Anthony. I’m really sorry. Cassie uploaded it and it’s gone viral.” Scott told him over the phone while Hope is being upset with Cassie in the other room.
“Steve...I have to be honest with you. I’m getting tired of being on the run. It’s been 2 years and I don’t know what to be doing anymore.” Natasha said feeling exhausted from all the evading they had been doing for the past 2 years.
Emmie: Some crazy stuff is about to happen in this chapter. Only 1 more chapter before the end of this fic. Enjoy!
“Your wish is my command my darling.” Steve purred as he then slid home inside of Anthony’s hole. Steve grunted as he felt Anthony’s warmth clench around his member. Anthony felt his whole body quiver with each thrust from Steve into his body. He was thankfully for the stretching that Steve did beforehand and by GOD was the entire experience just full of ecstasy.
They decided they would travel up to 20 miles at a time each day so they would have enough time to eat, rest, and hunt.
After getting the horses back in the stables, Steve, Tony, and the council head to the meeting room.
“Nah, don't worry. How long are you staying, anyway? Are you going to help out with the villa resort?”
After putting on the dress, Steve stared in desire at how the dress is form fitting on Anthony’s chest and pushes up his breasts to give them some form and saw how the skirt flowed around his feet. Steve then brought over a pair of slip ons that were of the same color that had lace on the side and heels that were 0.5 inch tall.
“Anthony, will you let me squeeze your neck?” Steve said with the look of doe eyes.
“Put that down! Looking at the news won’t do you any good.” Says Ho Yinsen, Anthony Stark’s coach.
Before he could continue on with talking, a tiny girl’s head popped out from the side of the rink with Hope.
“Hey, Bruce.” Natasha called out softly.
“Every other tapestry will be red or black with the royal crest in gold.”
Steve watched Bruce as he got to work on examining Tony. Bruce put his ear up to where Tony’s heart would be, stretched out his limbs, and looked inside his mouth. So far, Bruce doesn’t notice anything wrong but he decided to one more test that’s usually for Omegas only to make sure he can diagnose Tony’s condition. Bruce puts his hand on Tony’s belly where his womb would be and presses down. As a response to this, Tony let out a whine and tried to curl up into a ball. Bruce put his ear to Tony’s womb and felt confident with his findings.
Steve and the others arrived back at where the army is. “King Howard is refusing to back down. This is the moment that we’ve been anticipating men, show no mercy to Howard and his men. This is a fight to save the queen.” Steve spoke as he fiercely eyed Howard and his men getting ready like they are, and unsheathed his sword. He then points it straight forward.
Tony’s eyes shone at that. “Morgan and Sarah it is then.” Steve leaned over and kissed him, feeling nothing but happiness.
“Are you alright?” said the golden wolf after he walked back a few steps.
Steven gets up and out of the pool and Anthony sees that he’s TOTALLY SO NOT NAKED right in front of him.
Steve laughed and leaned over to kiss Tony as well he could with babies in each of their arms. His eyes caught the rings on each of their fingers as he drew back. Symbols of the love he and Tony had for each other. And now they had two daughters as a result of that love and the promise they had made to each other.
Seeing Steven look at him makes Anthony slightly panic.
With a heavy heart, Steve slid it off his finger and dropped it into Tony's open palm. "Listen, I know I don't deserve it anymore, but it was my only reminder of you, of what we had, of when we were happy."
Both of them were traveling in the quiet forest. There wasn’t any noise except for the hooves of the horse trotting through the forest. The weather around them was a peaceful low morning fog. The trees around them were full and a beautiful green color. There were also some animals they saw and heard like the beautiful sound of birds chirping and squirrels chattering.
Shadows: By popular demand we’re here with a little bonus chapter! A little something extra for these weird ass times. Enjoy!!!
Emmie: The gang is on the road now. Any guesses on where they’re going?
“Well, I bet you came to skate, huh? Go right ahead.”
“I’ve seen how you are with Peter, Tony. I think you would make a great dad.” Steve had noticed that while all of them liked Peter, the bond he had with Tony was almost that of a father and son.
Tony, Rhodey, and Pepper eagerly watch Happy as he looks between the 3 white cards, trying to decide which one was the best.
“Steve, I’m scared about being a parent.” Tony said, feeling a bit worried.
It’s been a week since Steve and Tony went to the healer and he wasn’t feeling any better. Steve decides that they needed to head back to the healer so he and Tony get dressed and headed to the hall where the healer is.
Emmie: New chapter guys, enjoy some drama that will happen which includes someone returning from earlier in this fic. Here’s the song for this chapter:
One night, Howard called Tony to the living room of the place the pack lived in. The man in question was sitting by the crackling fire, a vintage whiskey sitting in an even older glass was held loosely in his hand.
“Leave him alone you bitch.” said the golden wolf as he got between Tony and the Alpha. Looking at the golden wolf between him and the harassing Alpha, Tony realized that it was the golden wolf he’d saw on the cliff of the Rockies when he was out with Rhodey, Pepper, and Happy. “Back off if you know what’s good for you. If you want to take this further, I’m ready and it won’t end pretty for you.” The golden wolf got into a strong stance against the other Alpha with the intention of protecting the Omega.
Shadows: I wrote the little fight scene in the middle but the rest was all Emmie. Gib her all da Luvs!!
“Dearest Anthony I chose you because when I smelled the scent of your blood last night, it smelled like sweet cinnamon and pine. It was like an intoxication that I couldn’t resist. When you are crowned queen, we will be ruling as equals.”
It was hard to believe that their 10 year wedding anniversary was coming up after the school year is over for their kids. They were together for 7 years beforehand and the wedding they had was further proof of how much they loved each other. Before they’d both met each other, they’d never thought they would find THAT mate that would complete their souls. They couldn’t wait to celebrate their anniversary in June with their whole family.
“I’ve been thinking, we should all go out in wolf form and maybe do a little hunting. What do you guys think? We’re starting to run a little low on food after that big storm. It’ll be good to go out and stalk up.”
His eyes were trained on the window, but now they slid back to Steve.
She leaned close to him and whispered, “Ryder took it off of you when you were unconscious. He used your fingerprint to take it off.”
“I do understand this, but you all know that if we hold him any longer Eva is going to get suspicious. Things will be eventually tied back to us and we can’t afford that to happen. I’m only saying what needs to be done,” Fury said.
Ryder had not been with him sexually, but that is not to say that he hadn’t tried. Ryder had tried on many occasions, but Tony had remained steadfast with his decision to not let Ryder ever have him that way again. Ryder sometimes hit him as though physically proclaiming his disapproval. After the first few times, he apologized. He stopped shortly after when Tony would turn his face away.
Tony smiled at the softness spoken in the words. He rested his head on the chest and turned further into him. He tried blinking his eyes open again to look at Steve once more before he fell into complete unconsciousness. He wanted to see that face and thank him. Thank him for coming for him.
This time it was on purpose.
“And I have told you many times to stop thinking like that,” Karen told him. “Where’s Peter by the way? I made him the apple cobbler he’s been consistently asking me about.”
“By the candy,” Miles sniffed. “I tried to run Aunt Natasha.”
“How do you expect me to do that?”
Though he thought maybe he could go back to being Tony if he finally resolved his issues with Rogers and fellow company. He just could never actually pick it up and call.
Tony shared his exact sentiments. Honestly, Tony would have thought this was something that Harley would have said. Peter’s eyes widened and his face paled as though suddenly realizing what he had said. Instead of apologizing, his lips thinned and he crossed his arms stiffly over his chest.
He tried with a therapist, a young woman who in his honest opinion was very nice and attractive. Unfortunately, the woman also saw this as a chance to get her cash in and spiel to the tabloids what Tony had revealed to her.
“Your brother,” he repeated again, “Was in a relationship with Tony Stark, yes. It was not a healthy relationship.”
Thanks again to everyone who commented, gave a kudo, and left a bookmark. You all continue to make my day :)
Tony slumped in his chair, face almost meeting the top of the table. “Nooooo.”
Tony had warmed up, desperately happy that he had finally done something to please Ryder. Gradually, that night Ryder had become softer with his words and ministrations. The way he clung to Tony was like a moment of relief. Tony felt so loved as Ryder whispered assurances that he was so strong not to need Dr. Sana and that he was so proud of him for listening to him.
“I never said thank you for that day. Thank you for helping me in a moment where I didn’t want others seeing how bad things had gotten,” Tony admitted. “And thanks for still being here, when I need to talk.”
“Oh, I most certainly do,” Tony said finally giving in to Steve. It wouldn’t hurt…and if secretly Tony had been hoping this for almost his who life no one would ever know.
The two of them broke apart briefly, after hugging and Steve clasped his hand warmly on Peter’s shoulder and taking one of the two bags from Peter’s hands.
“Okay, okay,” Natasha said, moving away from Bruce and sliding her hands out of his. “Okay, that’s fine. Whatever you need. But maybe let’s just get out of this room, okay? I don’t think anyone of us want to look at Ryder, right now.”
Clint narrowed his eyes. “Little black widows?”
Miles shook his head and leaned up. “No, baba! Come on hurry! We have to get ready!” He jumped out of his bed and bounced on his feet, while holding Snuggles in one hand.
“I heard that,” Wanda asserted. “And we’re not doing it.”
Another hit against Steve’s chest.
“Not, now Fury. Please just…” Tony said, sliding into the car.
Miriam tied her hair in a bun. “Again think long and hard. What did you do wrong?”
“So he took over and started working on how genetic coding could be transferred into another person and mirrored so essentially the two would have the same DNA sequence. Tony somehow found out about this string of research after he came back from Afghanistan. Something was in his dad’s notes about this and Tony accidentally threw them away as a purging of anything related to his father’s weapons. Don’t know how he got his hands on it, but he did. Ryder was furious because once again Tony was dictating his life. Of course Tony never knew it was Ryder behind the research.”
Thanks my love for all your wonderful comments, bookmarks, and kudos. I love all of you for your support and thanks for sticking with this WIP.
Miles seemed to think about this for a second.
Steve came in, followed by Bucky. Tony turned his head to the two and the hazy expression was back in them.
Tony shook his head as Steve held up a package of bread. Steve raised an eyebrow at him and pointed to the price. Sure, it was cheaper seeing as though it was the grocery store’s brand. He appreciated Steve with his serious price checking, despite how many times Tony had enforced that he didn’t need to do it. He suspected that Steve took price checking as a small challenge. It was somewhat endearing.
“I won’t leave his side.”
She came upon her husband, lying in a hospital bed blank expressionless eyes looking at the tv in front of him. She ran to him and wrapped her arms around his shoulders.
Pepper raised an eyebrow. “I figured you should do the honors.”
Wanda looked hopefully at Steve for permission. Steve knew that Wanda had missed the presence of Vision something great. However, he was still wary of leaving Wanda out of his sight. Vision took this hesitance of Steve’s approval.
“I’m so tired Steve,” Tony confessed against his chest. “I just want to have one night of sleep, without waking up. I don’t want to take any more sleeping pills…I just want to sleep on my own and not have him there waiting for me in my dreams.”
“Stop staring, punk,” he joked easily as if this was something he know did. “I’m pretty sure the building will still be here tomorrow.”
Harley and Steve arrived at the hospital just as visiting hours were starting. Immediately, the lady at the front desk greeted them. Smiling at the two she held out the forms for them to sign and pointed them to the waiting room. Steve followed her direction, but allowed Harley to be led to his mom’s room. While waiting for Harley to finish up visiting his mom, he grabbed a magazine and begin to flip through it. Finding nothing worth his interest, he placed the magazine down and settled on observing the people in the waiting room.
century.
Steve’s mind went to Harley. He didn’t know when Tony would be coming back and maybe he could help Harley to see his mom more than once a week. “What would it take to foster a kid?”
She turned to Rhodey, wanting a little assistance. Rhodey perked up at Pepper’s insistence and picked up where she left off.
Steve didn’t bother turning around to say sharply, “You’re right. It’s going to take time and he will not be the same as he was.”
“We’ll come back to visit every week, but your home will be with me. I’ll be your baba forever and always.”
“Yes, my bracelet Ryder. Where is it?”
Tony shook his head, smiling briefly at Steve’s consideration. “No, I’m fine. You get some rest in. And I’ll talk when I’m ready, but there’s no use in talking when one of us is heavily sleep deprived and the other is so emotionally drained I make Eeyore the donkey look like an excitable child.”
Tony let out relief sighed, kissing Peter’s temple and buried his face oh Peter’s neck, closing his eyes before shoving his hand and punching Peter’s arm
“sorry kid, you just got out of surgery, no coffee until next week. Or the next five years” The Doctor nodded at the interns to continue
“Steven, take a deep breath. Easy” she soothed her son’s back “she’s a strong girl, she can get through this. Blood clot happens during surgery”
“I’m fine. I just… how?”
“you looked like hell”
“genius here just got hit in the head with the Hulk. You said that we had one shot. That was our shot. We shot it. It's shot. Six stones or nothing. Six stones or nothing–“
“papa is on venger’s duty. Kicking bad guy butt”
Tony’s blood start to boil. All bottled rage, pain, and guilt suddenly starts to explode out “And I needed you. As in past tense. That trumps what you need. You know what I need?” he stands, pushing things off the table with a clatter. Everyone winces at the noise. He yanking the needle out from his vein ignoring the pain and blood dripping from his arm “I need to shave. And I believe I remember telling all of you-“
“Your dad won’t come home until next hour or two. Want to watch Mandalorian with me?”
“are you going to keep staring like that?” his throat rasped, hurts from the dryness “can you give me the water?”
“well… let’s just focus on the war first, little girl later, go ahead, we are going to be here for patrol”
“hello, is this thing even on?” Scott pointed at his own mouth “Guys, what's up? What is it?”
The girl just waves and look around and raising her hand “up”
“We will be fine. Just do your work and we can have our date later. Now if you excuse me. I need to watch Mandalorian on your TV. Bye” and Tony hung up the phone.
“no, I mean yes, I don’t know maybe? I know this sounds crazy”
“ok tin man, flick me” Scott squatted and Tony flicked him to the 2012 of himself
“I’m not” okay, maybe it comes out a little louder and harsher than he intends to.
“I may not the expert, but I don’t think your appearance is the style of the current year”
“Oh, good god. Dodge! No. Bad dog!” Steve comes back and pulled the laptop out of Dodger’s reach. Wiping the screen with some tissue nearby.
“you want me to kill him?”
“hey jellybean, what are you doing here?”
“hey ma, is he… is he hitting on you?”
lost someone important for us Scott. So no, I’m not going to help you build a time machine”
“I can see that” Tony tried to cover the girl open wounds that’s almost cleaned with the chart on the table. Shielding it away from his handsome father’s vision.
“I can assure you, Raggedy Ann. I am a real doctor. I have three PhD to show you”
“dada, no” she squirms and tried to get down and tried to grab one of the stone again
“fine” Tony huffed. Steve swears he can hear Tony’s eyeroll “come on, ratatouille, its go time”
“how’s my jellybean? You been good to aunt Peppy?”
“me too”
“that’s a dollar in a jar” Morgan point at the jar filled with money on the corner of the room
“Sorry babe, you just turned into the side chick since day I met Dodger” Tony laughed and wrapping Dodger in his arm before going back to sleep.
“I keep telling Clint, I’m the glue that hold this super secret boyband together.”
“I can’t do this. I can’t lose anyone anymore. How am I supposed to tell Morgan that her Auntie Nat who braids her hair, who teach her ballet, who give her snacks is gone? I can’t Tony, everyone leaves and they all dying. And for what? I’m fucking tired. I gave up. I – I –“ Steve choked up and blinded by his own tears, he felt Tony’s hand grabbing him tight, Steve just buried his head on Tony’s neck. Sobbing between Tony soothing hold wrapping his back falling into the source of the warmth.
Stephen Strange sighed in exasperation
“no one loved like them both. Come on, we need to test the time travel suit”
Tony notices a black Audi pulling coming to a stop a few meters away from where he standing. Steve, Nat, and Scott get out of the car. Tony sighs. He is not looking forward to the discussion about to take place.
“you miss her” they both know it’s not a question, Tony raised his hand to Steve’s. fingers tangled together
“Aunt Peppy give me cookies for dinner”
“Aunt Peppy bake me cookies. Why you never bake me cookies?”
“maybe”
“auntie Nat!!” the little girl dives head first to her hug
“this is sad, Dad. so painful to watch”
“You let him sleep on my t-shirt?”
“tell me to stop and I’ll do it”
“how you feeling today?” Steve leans in and kissing his check
would be a great time for us to meet the other guy”
“we will wait at the waiting room. I will be expecting someone to updating me every ten minutes” she is sighing and giving him and his intern a pointed look
“what just happened?” Rhodey muttered “F.R.I.D.A.Y update on the compound, how is Happy and Morgan?”
“You know, your mother actually saved my life too. When I was nineteen, still on med school, I heard about my parent’s accident. I was a wreck, start skipping class, going to parties. I ended up on ER three times that year. I got heroin overdose, it stopped my heart for thirty second and she’s one of the nurses who help bringing me back”
“aunt Pepper give you cookie? Did you eat your greens today?”
“He can’t stop whining the whole night. And the next day when I’m folding my laundry, he keeps digging on your T-shirt so I just let him. I will get you another one, I promised”
“I’m on it”
“Decent poker face Dodge, but I don’t think you should eat this. But you can have my chicken” he picked one of the chicken bits and feed Dodger, which he obliged along with the left dog treats on the table. Steve watching the whole thing with annoyed look on his face.
“are you sure Boss?”
Котёнок = Kitten
“Scott, are you alright?”
“DADA”
“what happened?”
“I’m fine. Just… aliens”
what we needed!” ragged breathing, he almost swore he can hear his ears ringing
Nebula help him walking down the stairs when he feels a strong hand grabbing his side. Shock would be an understatement, he thought. Glancing at Nebula, eyes bewildered changing a look. Tony grips Steve's arm as he joins him, Steve pulled him on strong hold buried his face on Tony’s neck.
“that… doesn’t help my case”
must did something wrong”
“Tony Stark, I'm Doctor Stephen Strange. I need you to come with me. Oh, uh, congratulations on the baby, by the way.”
“oh God” Steve just sat on the ground turning over Vision's bleached corpse looking shellshocked
“I know” Tony said, almost believed his own words. He reached the pocket on his trouser reaching for the dog tag, rubbing his finger on the cold edges looking for comfort on his own words, unsure who is it that he’s trying to convinced.
“But I don't wanna see you gone. We need you, Cap.”
“I’m not even twenty and they said I had to use pacemaker my whole life? I was terrified, and alone. Everyone recognized my last name and their attitude change, too afraid to do something. But not Nurse Rogers, everyone know I needed a spanking and she’s the only one who delivers. She looked at me straight in the eyes and told me
“you sleep for a really long time”
Their shield clanged in deafening sound, Steve tried his best no to hurt his old self and just docked his attacks. And then he felt kick on his stomach throwing him few feet’s away
“she had that effect on everyone” Tony smiles “she had your eyes”
“who could find him then?” Stephen Strange cut his rambles
“god forbid she’s joining this circus” Rhodey grimaced “you guys looked like crap by the way”
“byee” Morgan eyes shines when she hears a prospect of new snacks for her
Steve walked in his kitchen finding his daughter and his boyfriend decorating cupcakes and having karaoke session with soup ladle and whisk as microphone. Morgan twirling on his three days old princess costume which she refused to washed no matter how much everyone begged (mostly Peter), bribed (mostly Tony) and forced (mostly Steve and Sarah).  Tony painfully rolling his back in his saddest attempt trying to twerking to the song, neither of the two aware being watched.
“dinner it is”
“hng...” Tony stir half asleep at the sudden movement
“holy shit. Nurse Rogers, a little warning next time, heart condition” Tony pointed at his chest
“I have eyes on Loki. 14th floor.”
It was bright. And strangely smells like antiseptic. So, this is what hell feels like, he tried to focused his vision when a familiar shriek greets him.
“Morgan Margareth Rogers, come to ER yesterday with open ulna fracture. Post-op charts show a little fever, treated with antibiotics”
Howard Stark actually acted before he was a father? If it was the latter then it must me who turn him into an awful parent I remembered.
“uh... He's from space. He came here to steal a necklace from a wizard.”
“No. Don't . . .”
Tony just chuckled at her claim. Rubbing his temple, he sighed “I could keep it in a box and dumped it on the lake, stop everything”
“she’s almost two, quite stubborn, and a great runner” Happy sighed “you done running around by yourself?” Happy tickled her side
“Boss’s signal still offline since the first invasion in New York”
Tony rolled his eyes when he hears his daughter happily repeating all the words “you see what you did? You’re shouldn’t be allowed near my daughter anymore”
" I'll be damned, Ariana Grande was right, God
“oh yeah, you’re new around here. That’s what they do, before… everything” she grabs an orange slice on the plate “if you asked Steve how they do that, he might answer something like ‘dating anyone is literally better than him’ cause he’s an idiot like that.”
“you’re killing me”
“I appreciate the gesture, but fuck that. My father was an asshole”
Steve stopped dead on his track and staring at his boy, who are now grinning
“DADDY!!”
“no Ma, it’s Morgan. She’s … She’s on her Taylor Swift phase” Steve sighed and step inside the room, walking through the source of the music
thanks for reading
“few months” she took a chair next to the bed “if it wasn’t because of the extremis injected to you, you probably already kicked the bucket now.”
“you know, I used to have nothing. And then I got this. This job... this family. And I was... I was better because of it. And even though... they're gone... I'm still trying to be better.”
Tony smirked and gather the charts “I will post the charts and grab the sharpie for Baby Rogers, I will be back later”
Tony can’t help to hold his satisfied grins to himself. Sliding his hand to Steve waist, he tried to pull his clothes.
“no” she jumped from the couch and run
“only if you promised to visit her as a family member and not as a Nurse. That means not coming near the charts or any nurse stuff, capiche?”
“how’s Tony?”
“four years old? That sucks”
“he’s a single Dad of two”
“that’s a non-negotiable”
Steve chuckled at his comment “how did you do that? Even I couldn’t convince her to go home”
“this is why you’re my favourite, Sugarplum. Will you turn down 117 countries for me?” Tony smiled
“I got you cheeseburger”
“we have all the time for us” for the first time in seven years, Steve smiled the wildest and let out his toothy grins before kissing Tony again
“I'm gonna have to call the Director.”
“how are you doing Buck?” Steve smiled and hug the man
“hey hey, its ok. Take it easy” a voice tried to calm him, grabbing his fingers
“Daddy, I got you cheeseburger”
“Tony…”
“Excuse me... hello” Scott waved at the two starting get annoyed for being ignored “Cap. Captain. Steve, sorry, America. Rogers. Buddy. Sir. Look, if you do this, and this doesn't work, you're not coming back.”
“oh... I am so sorry about last night. I just... it just… –“
“I don't understand.”
“auntie Nat been teaching me Ballet while you sleep. She said I can show you when you wake up”
?” the dad shrieked
“god I love this place”
doctor or doctor like Tony, doctor?”
“did he really need to looked like that?” he muttered under his breath
“well –“ Tony stopped when he saw Steve and Nat come with takeout containers on their hand
“says the man who constantly wearing clothes two size smaller than his own build”
“promised me you won’t die?”
“Boooorriiinnggg” Tony whine at the screen “I saw someone that looked like Ryan Gosling in coffee shop nearby, so that’s a plus I guess” he shrugged “how about you?”
“Secretary Ross wants you both prosecuted. Had to give him something.” Tony shrug
Bucky glance at Sam sharing a look and looking back at Steve “so… what’s the problem here?”
“mine? Which one, the robot or the disabled one?”
“how’s Malibu?”
“it was a big thing for me. Thank you, Tony. I appreciate that you’re trying. He also told me that you believe someday I will leave you.”
“I just saw my dad”
“Auntie Nat are you crying?”
“you’re going to remind me that every day?”
now. I don’t know what that mean but I’m blaming Peter and Shuri for that”
“there would be weird if New York didn’t have any kid, Steve” Sam just chuckled at Bucky’s comment
“it’s ok papa, he looks hungry”
“You just lost a blowjob privilege tonight. Another word about my clothes and you’re sleeping on the couch” Tony smirk and leave a kiss on Steve cheek
“oh wow, Doctor Carol Danvers, I did not know you have that mischievous in you” Tony mused
“Dinner would be more romantic” Morgan nudged her father with her healthy hand
“wow, sugarplum you hurt me” Tony bite a piece of chicken “he’s an Ear-nose-throat meets rabbit from a hat. He shouted ‘flourish’ for every hand gesture or two”
“Barnes”
“I’m retiring. I’m done being Captain America, I just want to stay home and raising my daughter”
“I didn’t use cheat code, I hacked the game so I can always have the golden mushroom with me”
“why are you just telling us now? Why not aying anything at the compound?”
“Doctor Strange”
“hi Bruce”
told me not to fucked this up, everyone think I will ruined this like I would fucked up everything I ever had, I mean obviously, look at me and Pepper, Ultron. Everyone give me the shovel talk, tell me ‘don’t hurt him, poor guy had been through enough.’ Well look at him now, Captain Perfect is war criminal, a fugitive hiding in I don’t know which country of the week, and everyone still kiss the ground he stepped on. You know what, maybe Pepper was right, maybe
“Oh my god” Tony moaned at the food in front of him “moving in with you is the bestest decision I ever made. This is so good” Tony scooped another spoonful of rice pilaf on his plate
“so, we are going for a little detour, and Scott can take the sceptre back to the compound”
“sure, I will draw flowers and unicorn for you”
“that’s Steve?
“I’m not arguing with you” face flushed and he wrapped his hand on Tony’s waist. Cradle him to sit on top of his lap. Steve let out a small groan when Tony kissing the side of his neck
“am I in hell?”
“Sam, the girl...”
“I'm sorry. That must've been a very long five years.”
“I will give you cookies, Rhodey said you like those”
“oh my god, Ma. I am so sorry for being late, I have to picked up Peter first. how are you baby?” the blonde hunk frantically apologies to her mother and the daughter.
tony tried to hid his amused smile, he cleared his throat “like I was about to say. Miss Morgan here, have open Ulna fracture. That means she broke her arm and it puncture an open wound right here” he pointed at the wound on her arm “I’m going to perform surgery to fix the bone back to its place and put her hand on cast.”
Tony can feel his brain rebooting when he saw a handsome blonde bumping him aside and running to the bed. Mouth gaped and ears ringing, couldn’t stop staring at the handsome frantic man with a body to die for looking at his own daughter. It took everything in his willpower not to climb him like a tree. Shaking his head, he tried to focus back on his patient.
“you’re alive. Oh, thank god”
“most of them it was empty, operated from the compound, months after her birth, sometime it was operated by me. It’s a group project”
Scott pulled the pin and climb out from the arc reactor, kicking the suitcase toward Tony disguised himself as one of the bomb squad. Leaving everyone gathered around the 2012 Tony Stark gasping for air and fall to the floor writhing in pain.
“well magic of course” the stranger pointing at the portal behind him “we need your help, the fate of the universe is at stake.”
“then you can call me Just Tony, Steve” Tony smiled “she’s stable. No blood clots. woke up, watch cartoons, eat some pudding and went back to sleep. no interns coming near Sarah Rogers’s granddaughter and I will personally be monitoring her overnight. I made sure of that before your mother agreeing to go back home to rest”
“yeah… she’s bossy like that. Wonder where did she get it from. Will you keep that a little quiet?” Tony pointed at the shield “I didn't bring one for the whole team”
Tony stopped when the machine next to Morgan starts beeping rapidly and the girl become unresponsive.
“Space. Reality. Power. Soul. Mind. And Time.” Each stone glows when Stephen Strange said the stone’s name
“hey Tony, whose kid is this? Oh my god are you and Pepper… wait… no way, but last time you were with Ste..”
Tony rolled his eyes, oh great. We’re fighting aliens and the other angry guy is having performance issues.
“I think you look great” Bruce walking at the opposite end of door “hi Nat”
“Cap, we have a problem”
“anything for my
Tony sitting cross legged on the floor, hand reached for his helmet turning it on. Groaning and wincing at the pain at his bruised abdomen.
“I’m sure he will let you in her life”
“Oh, did I?”
“you sure?”
“time travel”
“Morgan, stay here. Let me call Helen”
“she’s not crying but I’m pretty sure she’s in pain. And she’s only accompanied by the day care staff. Parents are on their way. ”
“yeah, I’m fine. I’m just… “ Steve wiped his eyes with his finger, laughing and hug his boyfriend “I love you, Tony Stark”
“No, just saliva all over the screen”
“Dad, hear me out. If I can drive, I can help you pick Morgan from kindergarten. It’s a win-win”
The dog only barked and moves closer to lick the screen.
“moon sound alright. Morgan learns the word
“pretty much, yeah”
“what’s going on?” Tony woke up and looking at the two in front on him “Steve, what happened? Go back to bed”
“good morning Doctor Stark” the little girl waved at him. Her father sits on the couch clicking on his laptop, smiling at the doctors.
They lost, some of them are vanished, collapsing into ashes. Steve walked over to the ground where Bucky ashes evaporating in the air. Looking for everyone else nearby, so confused and disoriented
“I’m nurse on duty, boy”
“Naah it’s ok. I missed you too, I’ve been wearing your hoodie since last night” Tony turned the camera to show the said hoodie hanging on the hanger near his suitcase
“I promised her to not eating junk food for a month if she went home” Tony let out sheepish smile
“her name, her name’s Morgan”
“nana went out to get coffee for us”
“great, I will be back in a sec, I need to pack something”
“I talked to his mom, Tony. She’s the head of ER Nurse. Peds got paged on ER every time”
“oh please, so does Ortho. I don’t dabble on straights”
for not listening to me. Yes, I’m petty like that forgive me, I haven’t had my breakfast yet”
The last time Steve stepped on Wakanda the weather was in the middle of raining seasons, all the rouge team was trying to call this place their new home. But it never was, Clint and Scott finally take the deal with the government. Wanda and Vision trying to steal some time together meeting in secret, part of Steve hoping he and Tony could have at least half of what Wanda and Vision had. His train of thought were interrupted when the Quinjet finally landed and Sam opened the door showing T'Challa and the Dora Milaje waiting for them.
“oh yeah... Bleecker street. Not Manhattan nice, but it’s alright”
Tony turned off the helmet and resting his eyes thinking about the last sleep he would have when Nebula walks over him and carrying him to the seat near them and lies him there when they saw light blinding their visions.
“she insisted to scrubbing in, I almost tackled her from entering the OR”
Steve joined the laughed and let out a relief sighed
“Thank God I'm here. Regardless, I fixed it.” Tony holds up his right hand, showing a device on his wrist “A fully functioning Time-Space GPS. Turns out, resentment is corrosive, and I hate it.”
“Bruce?” Tony looked so surprised and step forward hugging his friend
The thing about living in Malibu is the heat. Everything is hot and humid it makes his hair swell and doubled the size. The good news is, there will be tons of high profile celebrities with scandals and big news everyday so less paparazzi around Stark Mansion.
“I can’t lose her ma. I can’t” Steve hyperventilated and sweating on his seat
“yes!”
“sounds like a promise” Tony smirks
“Technically, it's the government's property. Wings, too.” Tony almost can feel the smugness ih Natasha’s voice
Tony made face and looking at her daughter still napping
“and you can visit him all the time, I will make sure about it. My legal team will help with anything he need”
“It’s fine, Steve. I don’t mind waiting in your apartment.”
“I can do this all day.”
“here’s the last box” Steve lift and walked to their bedroom to place the box with the word “socks” written on the side “are you seriously have a whole box only for socks? How many socks did you own? You only have two legs”
“I can be ballerina president”
“did you know who just saved your magical ass?
“Consequences? You bet there'll be consequences. Obviously you can quote me on that 'cause I just said it. Anything else? Thank you, sir.”
“see you in a minute” Nat sharing a knowing smile at Steve excitedly
“any idea how to… nailing this thing?”
“You're gonna be fine, you know? We’re all going to be fine”
“not at four. Not this young. I can’t even remember what I did at four” she frowned “suction” she moved when a hose coming at her direction “how is Nurse Rogers handling her granddaughter in OR?”
“and see a friend, let her teach my daughter ballet”
“no Peter, I’m not part of this”
“let’s do plan number one then, attack”
“for now? Yeah. I’m done with New York, we need a change of scenery. And someone need to keep an eye on my Platypus’s therapy session”
They sat in silence for a moment, Steve’s hand running along Tony’s healthy arm. Tracing the visible veins in his forearm, giving Tony goosebump and link their fingers together
Meeting your already-dead-for-thirty-years dad is awkward. Like chatting with someone and not knowing who they are but you still tried to playing it cool awkward. Is it deja vu, or is it really
“No, no, no. There are no other options. There's no do-overs. You said it yourself! Yo –” Scott scowling. A vein almost popped from his forehead
Steve about to open his mouth when Morgan starts to groaning “Daddy” she waved half asleep
“Hey Tony, you alright?”
“so, Morgan really is Tony and Steve’s?”
“I am” Steve kissed the top of Tony’s head “it looked better on you than me”
“I understand. I know it’s hard, but appreciate it that you’re trying. You don’t have to, but you did.”
“fine, I will choose you” she sighed in defeat and face her granddaughter “you’re in good hands, pumpkin. It’s going to be fine” she smiled and kissed the tip of her head.
Tony swore he can feel something is punching his gut “huh… well… so here’s the thing, about Vision..”
“we’re on our way”
“oh wow, if it wasn't awkward before…” Sam whispered
“That wasn't supposed to happen, was it?”
“the Boss Baby and Happy are fine, but most of other staff are vanishing from the compound”
“wha… it’s not that easy. Gosh we haven’t caught up haven’t we?”
“no, I’m the day care staff. Her father is on the way, he said her grandmother works here”
“that’s fucking bullshit. That idiot fought the world for you. He was broken for months when you were lying here in coma. He keeps telling me he just got you back. He was so scared of you leaving him.  I didn’t love him like he love you. Wrong genitals and all. No offense”
"Yeah?"
“he’s… different. He’s easier to talked to. Not that all my daddy issued are suddenly resolved. But, if this is what he was before, that
“what a pompous ass” Tony muttered and he looked at the flip phone “I don’t know which is more insulting, he said that the avenger is mine or this stupid outdated phone.” He fold the letter “is it weird that I prefer him sending me his wedding invitation than this stupid ass phone?”
Tony rolled his eyes and letting out a dramatic sigh “I was trying to move and gaining control on my body. Adjusting the prosthetic” he pointed at his red prosthetic hand
“no, I didn’t tell her. I… I wasn’t sure Tony would allow me in her life, so I just uncle Steeb for her”
Steve tensed at his words
Steve smiled so brightly it almost blinding his vision, Steve moved forward and kissed his lips
“wow, bribery, there’s one way to do it” Natasha came from their behind
“it’s Morgan” Rhodey startled him
“… tell me about it”
“who is that?” Sam finally found his voice and looking at everyone in confusion
“I think we going to need a rain check on this” Steve exhaled and kissed him again. Shorter and nipped at Tony’s lower lip
Tony stared at the man and inhale a deep breath “can you move closer?”
“he did wha –“
“I know. You should ask him out”
“fine, I won’t ask about the car for now. But, can you buy me the new xbox instead?”
“I can’t. this traitor won’t let me” he huffed in annoyance pointing at the dog
“she’s the new avengers member?” Natasha, the only one who looked like able to managed her composure the whole time asked
“that’s mean. But I like your idea”
stay safe everyone
“Yes, this is--this is Tony "Stank". You're in the right place. Thank you for that! I'm never dropping that, by the way. Table for one, Mr. "Stank". Please, by the bathroom.”
Taking another breath, he continues “you will choose her and stayed, out of obligation. Leaving everything behind, and you will hate yourself, and her” Tony gulped “I grew up with a father who hates my guts, who stayed and told me that I was a burden. I can’t do that to her”
“come on, let’s change to your pjs, don’t you want to go to sleep?”
Steve is trying his best to wipe the shit eating grins on his face when he walked out from the elevator. He can hear the Tony and Scott’s soft gasps on his earpiece.
“we’re almost heading towards earth. Try not to throw up on the ship”
“how bad you want to rinse your mouth with soap saying that line, Cap?”
“where’s Steve?”
“cap, the sceptre is in 80th floor, your turn”
Steve just realized something, he also didn’t know what to do with kids. He turns to Natasha
“I don’t know man, no one said anything. I somehow see the resemblance but I don’t know” Sam just shrugged and looking at the sky “guys, we have situation here”
“for research, or buy new toys. the S from the S.H.I.E.L.D Hospital stands for Stark. That let people know I’m one of the board members. And they will come up to me to fund something, or worse, people corner me at parties to asked me checking the weird mole on their ass.” Steve just snorted at the comment.
“no, no. that’s one of our doctor’s name. the girl won’t need a hammer” Tony let out amused smile
“among other things, yeah”
“I tried make you once when you were younger, the oven burst into flame”
“Morgan is sleeping, let’s get you inside”
“Got it. I'm going to the elevator now.”
. He sighed and feel the edge of the mirror shakes. He adjusts the mirror to stop the shakes, and one minutes later it shakes again, harder and longer than the first time. Grabbing the clothes laid on the floor he runs to the yard to find Carol Danvers, the flying woman who asking for Fury two weeks ago carrying a spaceship.
“uncle Bucky” the little girl spot him from the end of her father bed, she let out her toothy grin and waves before back watching cartoon again
“just a little”
“no, you’re not”
“Doctor Stark, is there anything to reduce the itchy? Any meds or something?” her dad standing next to the bed frowning at her hand
“we were kind of… broken up” Tony shrugged “well the avengers, I mean”
“I’m here. I’m not going anywhere” Steve smiled with teary eyes, hand never leave Tony’s hand. Gripping the fingers afraid it might slip away.
“please tell me you’re not going to do anything stupid in the pool”
“I want you to know that you are free.” Tony wiped the tear stains on Steve’s face with his thumb “That it’s ok if you want to go back to be with Peggy.”
“… wow… okay, I’m awake now. Are you sure?”
“I’m on it”
“Tony, listen to me, Thor is gone, you are our only hope”
“Nat” Morgan runs to her and raised her hand asking for pick up
“oh Steven, how are you married?” she laughed
“ok, jellybean we’ve been over this, if you eat all of your broccoli, I will give you one cookie”
“yeah, I think it’s time”
Steve enters the elevator joining the agents, eyeing the sceptre Rumlow is holding.
“I was in the middle of a field trip. No big deal, what’s this guy problem?”
“Uh, Mr. Rogers. I almost forgot that that suit did nothing for your ass.”
“we need to find Vision”
“please?”
“come on Danvers, you told me you never broke a bone, ever?” Tony raised his eyebrows “scalpel” he raised his palm to the scrub nurse
“Did he give you any clues, any coordinates, anything?”
“Uh, not bad, for the end of the world” he shrugged “what’s wrong? You looked like shit”
The three of them stopped when they hear a loud music from the inside
“is that the famous Nurse Rogers Baked Pasta? Gimme gimme” Tony waved her fingers
“you alright Cap?”
“depends on what you did to have 117 countries to go against you”
Steve’s heart broke when he heard those words. “I couldn’t hate her, or you. I would always choose her, I would always choose
“maybe, but… now I’m here. I think we can do this. We can go back and get it all back, we can bring everyone back”
“uh no, it’s Bruce, we need your help”
“you read my mind kiddo, this is why you are my favourite” Tony kissed her temple and rose from his seat “I wish you'd come here to ask me something else. Anything else. Honestly”
“what?”
“everyone is coming back”
“thanks man” Steve nodded and rushed to the castle leaving the two men alone
“You will have my Kingsguard, the Border Tribe, the Dora Milaje, and-”
“like the Beatles broken up, or...”
“what’s with your head?”
“I’m afraid not, and no scratch –“
“You're only giving me a mild cardiac dysrhythmia. It’s nothing” Tony can hear Steve on the earpiece shrieking “a mild WHAT??”
“she is going to be fine. the surgery went well, I manage to reduce the swelling and hopefully no scar on the future. She requested a pink cast and quote
“he got nice place on the village though” Bruce scooping the ice cream tub on his hand
“you can ask her later yourself when she woke up, Little Rogers” Tony winked at the kid
“Cap, prepare on your position, they are going to finished soon in here”
“yes, I mean no, I mean… I’m in charge of her until... whatever this is done”
“Well, it's still fire, isn't it?”
Steve just snorted at the comment, waiting for everyone rush back to castle and leaving Steve, Bucky and Sam alone
“no Mama Rogers today?”
“ugh stop touching my face” Tony groaned next to him
It took all of his willpower not to throw up on the Quinjet. I almost killed her.
“From the dawn of the universe, there was nothing. Then, boom! The Big Bang sent six elemental crystals, hurtling across the virgin universe. These Infinity Stones each control an essential aspect of existence.”
“I didn’t know that”
“and I did find a whole new family for me”
Tony hesitated, sighing exasperatedly pulling out the flip phone from his pocket “stupid outdated flip phone” he muttered, flipping the phone showing the only contact saved on the phone pressing the call button only to stop and look at Stephen Strange
“sounds like a deal” Steve reached out his hand which tony replies with a handshake. Both tried their best to hold the leftover tingling sensation inside them before Tony broke it of and walked to the trunk pulling something out. Steve looking at the round object with hesitation written clearly on his eyes
Exhausted, Tony falls to the ground. Out of reflex Steve grabbing his hand, holding him steady
“Tony” Nat cut Scott when he tried to open his mouth “We have to take a stand.”
“Steve, and him, it was not like that”
“more like having some questions being finally answered, actually. But that too” Steve let a sad smile “We really should go, they were looking for us” He adds before they set the coordinate on the GPS again.
“okay” Rhodey sighed and went inside oh the house
Steve jumped down from the building holding the sceptre and his shield looking around their meeting point looking for everyone when he spotted Tony and Scott sitting inside the broken car
(See the end of the chapter for
“We've been hunting Thanos for three weeks now. Deep Space scans, and satellites, and we got nothing. Tony, you fought him”
“Tony, I… I don’t know”
“okay” Tony whisper to himself and took a deep breath back to his previous position in the pool
“time heist” Scott beamed, trying to hide his pride and failed
Steve washed the blade on his hand, rubbing his chin checking the shaved beard. Looking at his own reflection staring back at him, wishing his mother were there to help him.
“Papa!!” Morgan jumped from the bed and dived to Steve legs asking for pick up
“wait, They were there at a– I might have a vaguely exact idea.” Tony cut him off
“I fall from the swing and hurt my hand”
Peter blinked twice before stuttering “I… I didn’t know what you’re talking about”
,Tony. I’m still choosing you. I let you go once. I’m not doing it ever again” Steve grab Tony’s wrist, leaning for his touch, kissing the pulse on his wrist “five years ago, when you’re just woken up, when I got back from killing Thanos, I told you I would always choose you. And I want to fixed everything. If you let me. I still mean it. every word of it”
“Yeah, put him through.”
“A semi-stable, 100-year-old man” Bucky walked past the kingsguard taking care of injured Vision
“okay, so in school. We have a classmate name Brad, last time I saw him he was like this tiny little skinny boy, and them boom, now he’s older and taller than me. I mean, what the hell is going on?”
“she’s sleeping. It past two. Save your strength, Tony.”
“ok Tony, reel it in with the self loathing, you are Tony Freaking Stark!
Tony fold the letter for the millionth time, undoubtedly memorized word by word from the letter
“which is I found out was not a pseudonym by the way” Tony shrug “I don’t get it either”
“nice try, bud” he opened the door letting his mother come inside first “the answer is still no –“
Steve chuckled at her antics “I call you when he woke up”
“I wouldn’t even let you touch the stirring wheel, leave alone have you picking Morgan with a car” Steve shakes his head
“whose
“I'm not Loki. And I don't wanna hurt you.”
The girl just nodded and waved goodbye at everyone and exiting the room back to Happy who running at her. Steve still staring unable to looked away just waved back at the closed door
“daddy, you’re funny. How is the
“got one too” Carol adds
“Dude…” Peter looked at him at pity and drop his bag on the counter
“Ste… Steve?” Tony let out a breathy gasp. It took all of his strength to say his name
“haha, I remember the time you’ve been awake for 48 hours straight”
At least they tried to, when Thanos ship attacking the compound.
Tony is lying on top of Steve’s body, kissing the man furiously. He slides one hand under Steve’s shirt rubbing the tip of his nipples, a small gasp let out from Steve’s mouth.
“There's another way. To retake the Tesseract and acquire new particles. I know for a fact they were there–“
“okay, now, Rogers –“ Tony just lost it at four pairs of head looking at his direction “I’m sorry. I forgot all of you are Rogers” he laughed “Baby Rogers” he pointed at the girl “Little Rogers, Big Rogers” he pointed at the son and the father “and old – I mean Mama Rogers” he cleared his throat when her menacing glare pointed at him.
“if he send me their wedding invitation I will kill myself and personally drag him to hell with me” he muttered to himself. He sighed and finally ripped the top of the box and find a letter addressed to him.
“don’t you ever do that again!”
Natasha Romanoff is gone.
“Nana, a little help here?”
handful, maybe this is why she left. You know, aside from Pepper, Steve is the only longest relationship I ever had. I was really really happy, I thought I was done. All the bar dive, galas, parties, i was completely done. I should have known, I’m not Bucky, when someone said my name it won’t make Captain America lost focused and make him back to his 16-year-old kid again. I wish i have someone to fight 117 countries down for me like Bucky had. I could kill someone to have some drinks now”
“rule is rule. You need to sit on the waiting room. Besides, you’re not a scrub nurse. I will let you choose the doctors and the staff for the OR. But if you pick Hammer, I will riot”
“teenagers” Tony rolled his eyes
“Will you find out where he's going next?”
“we are visiting Mama tomorrow, Tony said we should make cupcake to celebrate Mama’s heavenly birthday, so we make cupcakes”
“He won’t listen to me anymore. That just great” sulking at his plate
“am I dead?”
“what?”
“ooh your dad also have beard?”
“you did? When?”
“what is she didn’t make it? oh God”
“were you two flirting in a middle of a fight?”
“What I'm saying is, time works differently in the Quantum Realm. The only problem is right now, we don't have a way to navigate it. But what if we did? I can't stop thinking about it. What if, we could somehow control the chaos, and we could navigate it? What if there was a way to enter the Quantum Realm at a certain point in time but then exit at another point in time? Like... Like before Thanos.”
They both groaning at the sudden movement – and the fact that Dodger are now half seated on Steve’s chest – “ughh… right on time” Tony huffed “Dodge, I enjoy the affection but come on, those abs been calling me since – wait, what’s on your neck, Buddy?” Tony grabs a small velvet pouch hanging on Dodger’s tag. “uhm.. Steve. what is this?”
“such an affectionate company” Tony muttered and grimaced at the pained abdomen
thanks for reading <3
“oh… guess what, Ms. Ellie gives us homework, what am I going to do when I grow up, I said I want to be ballerina like my Auntie Nat. Papa get me ballet shoes, it’s pink like yours” she waves her new pink satin ballet shoes
(See the end of the chapter for
Until he has to come out from the water and gasping for air.
“your mother then”
Steve sighed and looking at his shoes “you did”
Tony frown in disgust
They both turn their head at the window when one Fedex courier knocked and searching for Tony Stank.
“ugh.. do you?” Tony tried his best not to make a face on that line “look at me, I’m talking to myself, no one should be this desperate. Pull yourself together, Stark!”
“Peppy give cookie”
“you were in Denver taking the attending exams. Sometimes, when the ER are slow, after peds round we share a coffee and chat. You know, like normal human being”
“we got blood clot, I had to cracked her cast.”
“Tony” Steve rose from his seat, stopping him and grabbing his hand “I get it. And I'm happy for you, I really am. But this is our second chance.”
Morgan nodded, still looking at Tony
“the doctor said you shouldn’t remove the cast in for another two weeks”
“we managed to get the blood clots and now she’s stable. Need an overnight observation and we changed her cast”
“well… he kind of, um.. turned off his transponder, he’s offline”
Scott Lang is pacing in circles, looking so confused and keep glancing at Steve and Natasha and back to Morgan who are sitting on the chair eating sandwich.
Steve opens the door and looking at his surrounding, his tv is playing a green baby Yoda. He walked closer to find his boyfriend curling on his couch napping and drooling on his couch. Biting his lips to hold a smile he grabs his throw blanket from the floor and spot his dog snuggling under one of his boyfriend’s arm.
They talked got interrupted when a screen pops out showing Scott Lang waving at the camera
“I’m so sorry babe. My meeting takes longer than it should. I will be home in an hour top”
“Nurse Rogers, you know the rule, family members do not treat family members”
is also jeopardizing me, us, my company, many lives are on my hand if this go south.”
“she’s going to need
I missed you”
“Tony, I'm gonna need you to focus.”
“Tony, what happened?”
“hello Doctor Stark. I thought only interns who are monitoring patients”
“not sure boss”
“I found out about her in Germany, when they are checking my hand, insisting a blood test. I was already on the plane before the result comes out”
thank you for reading <3
“quoting Star Wars won’t work on me… I just... we’re not on speaking terms, he’s probably on his honeymoon in god knows where’s the country of the week they stayed. he didn’t even know about Morgan” he glanced at his daughter who now playing with the tip of the red cloak handing her the glowing stones so she can play with the stones on the floor “look, how am I…”
“scouts honour, Mama Rogers” Tony saluted and grab the chart
“but you can’t stop thinking about it”
“I’m trying to explain the death anniversary concept, so we use heavenly birthday and the next thing we know we’re making cupcakes. Don’t worry, I will clean this all up later”
“Scott, I got emails from racoon, nothing is crazy anymore”
“ugh, don’t remind me”
“yeah… he was on your prosthetic trial. Works wonder on him. On us. Thank you for that by the way.” Steve let out a tired smile before a revelation hits him and eyes open wide in shock “oh my god, I just talked your ear off, didn’t I? I am so sorry.  I tend to blab. Especially when I was nervous and you were just being nice and couldn’t care less about my problems. Jesus this is awful, please make me stop talking” he winced.
“I lost the kid”
“I know”
Steve fought Nazis, kicked alien’s asses, hell, he fought 117 countries for his friends. But parenting is
