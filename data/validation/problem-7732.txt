Then his lips met Wade's and it was like an explosion, like fireworks and like the whole world just snapped out of existence and only Wade and Peter were left. Only his lips on Peter's mattered, only their fingers intertwining. It was glorious, it was everything that Wade had imagined and more.
He saw a button labled distress signal just out of reach. Where would the distress signal lead? Home? Avengers tower? The avengers facility upstate? It didn't matter, Peter had to try it.
"Which is?", Peter asked. Now that he thought about it, he had no idea what his own birthday even was.
His instincts set in and without even thinking about it he opened the door of the still moving vehicle and launched himself out of it. He landed a few feet away from the highway, on his feet, his whole body trembling but uninjured.
"He's dead.", Wade breathed out.
5 sounds he could hear. Bucky's snoring, the AC in their room, a couple talking down the hallway, a car driving outside, his own heartbeat.
"Good. I'm glad that you're doing better, that you're alive...And that you're not into drugs. I don't know if I could've handled that. ", she then said and it seemed like this was just as hard for her to talk about as it was for Peter.
Gwen looked frustrated and guilty and Peter didn't know what to do with that. She let out a heavy sigh and sat down on the couch next to them and Peter followed.
. Why was he explaining this. Bucky himself had no fucking clue about romantic love, how was he supposed to explain it to Peter?
"How many are there? It's not like I do much.",Peter pointed out.
"It's complicated. Things happened, it wasn't their fault."
Tony was furious and heartbroken, distraught and confused. What had they done to his boy to make him into this broken man?
A part of Peter thought, that Tony wouldn't be too mad at his request. That Tony wanted what was best for him, that he wanted to make Peter happy, that he would let him go if that would help Peter in the long run. That part of Peter, that voice, sounded a lot like Wade. It was a product of his time here. A tiny bit of hope that Peter developed lately. It was nothing compared to the years of painful experience. Peter was still largely convinced that Tony would be furious.
When Peter returned to Bucky, he gave him a smug smile and once they actually got into their room, Bucky had this stupid smile on his face as he asked:"Made a friend there?"
"What he deserved.", Gwen replied cryptically and Peter heard Wade curse on the other side of the line, promisisng Gwen very inventive and gory ways in which he'd seek revenge, if Peter was harmed in any way.
"Look at Petey-Pie, a man of many talents! He can even juggle!", Wade smirked, pushing their shopping cart along.
"Should I be worried? ", Wade asked, fully awake now.
"What did you mean?" Peter lowered his eyes for a second and Wade could tell that he was contemplating if bringing it up, whatever it was, was worth it.
Afterlife, everything light and painless and better, yadda yadda, whatever. The typical crap that Wade didn't care for.
"He's managing our emotions, or at least I think that he thinks he's doing that. He does whatever we say, never protests anything, ask for nothing, and have you noticed how he forces his emotions down whenever he almost freaks out. It's almost like he's constantly waiting for us to blow up into his face and he's trying to put it off for as long as possible. No scratch that. I'm pretty sure that that's exactly what he's doing."
"Uhh... yes, yes I'm good. That's actually what I wanted to talk about. ", he said before looking down at his hands in his lap. Wade only now noticed a few red streaks along the inside of the boys arms but he turned them away from Wade's sight before he could observe them further.
was found in the arctic. He saw pictures, though, heard stories, of the good times. A face showed up before his mental eye, little Peter, 9 years old, messy dark curls and equally dark eyes, still a little chubby, soft in a way only kids are.
"That.", Peter said, not avoiding Wade's eyes, not backing down.
"You're not safe by yours-", Tony started again but his voice broke off when Peter focused his big terrified eyes on him.
"Nah, not personally. Met a few of his teammates, though.", Wade replied.
"We have a large age gap, so what?", Bucky asked. A thoughtful expression made it's way onto Peter's face. Bucky preferred it to the void.
"Let's pretend I don't. ", he said, instead.
"I'm not some stranger, I'm his father!", he snapped.
"What are we doing right now?", Peter asked and Wade faced him again. His hair was pretty curly right now but it was still wildly hanging in his face and had no definitive length or style.
Natasha didn't leave the mansion, she didn't plan on letting two of her friends get themselves killed over some stupid sentimentality. This wasn't a fairytale.
He tried to inspect the damage but he couldn't focus on the pain. It was too much, everything hurt, all of it. Peter wasn't sure if he was actually injured or if his poisonous soul was now finally eating away at his insides. He couldn't tell if his body was damaged but he knew that he was. Too damaged, too twisted,
The kid smiled crookedly, his eyes downcast, before looking into the camera again. "I forgive you... but also, my robotics team could use a dontation.", he said cheekily.
"It's a bit late for that, Â don't you think?", he asked, his voice sharp and challenging.
"I don't know what a crackhead is.", Peter admitted and he expected her to smirk or tease him like she usually did, instead she just stared, and there was something so sad about her eyes. "What's that look?", he asked.
"I appreciate the sentiment, but I think my issues would've caught up with us eventually.", Peter stated. It didn't make Wade feel any better.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Peter-?", Wade asked, his voice shaky but Peter had turned his head to one of the agents. "I think we're done here." An agent stepped up and pulled back Peter's chair so that he could get up.
"For what?", he asked because he wasn't sure what exactly Peter ment.
"Sorry to break it to you but you're stuck with me.", Wade smiled before something unpleasant reminded him of the truth. "Until I get you to your dad.", he added before turning to the three jeeps.
Peter rolled with his eyes but still cracked a smile. A beat of silence followed and Peter glanced away. His smile faded but only a fraction, the amusement made way for something softer.
"They are just people, they don't matter. ", she told him, not letting him out of her sight.
"I warned you, Wade. You never learn, do you?", she then asked, and her voice was sweet but it made Wade's dead heart skip a beat.
. Like Peter was the monster in this, the weapon, the danger. Bucky scoffed. He was the only one that had an idea of what Peter was going through right now.
"Yes, I am.",Tony nodded. Back at SHIELD he had seemed incredibly confident, that confidence seemed gone now.
"I suppose.", Bucky nodded along. "So we have a shit father?"
"What?! Why?", Wade asked at first before it dawned on him. Peter wouldn't just leave on his own. Not when he was well. Sure, he had ran in the past but those had been moments of emotional turmoil for him.
"Dr Seine is specialized in your kind of issues.", Steve continued, his voice steady again.
"I'll be a good boy...", Peter breathed out, hoping that it was the right thing to say. The man pulled a face, apparently not.
"How did you like your road trip?", Wade asked with an amused grin.
"She sounds like she was very special. ", Peter commented, diverting his eyes once more, glancing around the room, at anything but Wade.
"Aww, Spidey! That's so cute!", he exclaimed with a wide grin and Peter raised his eyebrows.
(See the end of the chapter for
Also, as always, I hope you enjoy this chapter, the next one's going to be more irondad focused again.
It had the opposite effect. MJ's head shot up again and her eyes widened. "It is? Oh god! I'm an asshole!", she exclaimed, running her hands through her hair now.
It was time. He had to go to sleep, and in Wade's case that ment that he had to die.
"You remind me of Tony. I mean you look alike but you just sounded like him, too.", Steve smirked but Peter seemed to shy away even more, suddenly looking at the floor.
"That's right!", Peter yelled from the other room before opening the door to the kitchen. Tony had gotten used to Peter's superhearing by now.
, Bucky knew what he ment. He himself had left the Avengers because he needed space to get better by himself. No matter how well-meaning people sometimes were, they could also give you the feeling that you were a problem. The bomb in the room, the issue, the tragedy. And when you snapped, when you lost it, when you had setbacks, they were devastated and that only made you feel worse about yourself.
"Peter, I can't hide you forever.", he stated and suddenly Peter looked up at him with this manic look in his eyes.
"Are you okay?", She then asked and Peter hated how sincere she seemed, how concerned. Peter hated how everyone was always so fucking worried for him.
"Peter. She thought that you would
Roughly a week had passed since he had last seen Gwen. Since she kidnapped him and almost killed him. Peter must've passed out sometime after her torture. The last thing he remembered was thinking that he was going to die and then Wade's face. And then, nothing.
For a second Tony thought he couldn't speak, his throat closed up and that was it. He pushed through it though. "Yes, this is real. You're home."
"What's up?", Peter asked with a frown before noticing the phone that Tony was clutching in his hand
"You know James would've wanted for someone to stop him. You know he wishes that he could've gotten rid of the programming earlier.", she argued and that was the part that hurt the most. That in some way, she was right. But not when it came to Peter.
It all came flooding back. Wade, their road trip, the Tower, Steve, Tony, their fight...
"Speak to me FRIDAY, how far are they away?", Tony asked, starting up the ship.
"Has this happened before?", Tony asked worry in his voice as he crouched down next to Wade.
in the moral sense. He seemed to equal
He looked up with a raised eyebrow. God, the kid looked nervous. "Uhh, sorry sir, but... are you being kidnapped? Should I call the cops?", he whispered carefully and Peter almost smirked. He had to look quite worrying with his sickly appearance, the scrubs and his bare feet.
Now he had a bed and food and warm baths and even if he didn't have Gwen, at least Wade was here. Still, his thought patterns didn't change. If he behaved he'd get rewards. Like not being watched all the time, like alone time, like not being treated like a time bomb.
It broke Wade's heart, how could it not? Of course he loved Peter, of course he wanted him to know that.
Peter didn't get to reply because Gwen yanked him out of the chair. He tried to fight her, placing a kick to her gut that made her gasp and landing a punch against her jaw that would surely bruise but he was still a little slowed down by his concussion and in the end she overpowered him, throwing him to the ground and aiming her gun at him. How predictabel. Three deafening shots exploded through the silence and Peter didn't bother to keep in his scream.
that I'm concerned about. "
When they were back in New York it already seemed bad enough but at least Peter seemed to function somewhat. Tony wouldn't want to admit it but he later figured that it had something to do with Wade. Once they left for Malibu Peter turned into a shell. It was heartwrenching. Tony thought it was bad when Peter screamed and lashed out but the apathy was so much worse.
They'd catch him and take him back. They'd punish him and he'd get strapped to the table again, or worse, the chair. He couldn't go back, he couldn't-he-
Peter's heart was racing in his chest. He could hear MJ's panicked breathing, could see Karen shake as she tried to keep her composure. He needed to do something and he needed to do it soon.
So Bucky picked the boy up as carefully as possible. "Hey, kid. I'm gonna take care of you, okay?", he mumbled more to himself as he gently placed him in the back of his car.
"Okay, why are you so agitated right now? If you don't want to see me just say so, no need to get all pissy about it. After all, according to the Tinman you asked for me.", Wade said, pretty irritated by now but it quickly faded when Peter's mask of anger fell, revealing confusion and then something like shame.
"No. I don't mind you.", she stated and Peter felt like she was surprised by that herself. Peter didn't question it, though. Â He really didn't want to go back inside so he sat down at the edge of the pool again.
He was surprised to find the lights on but less surprised that it was Tony who was sitting at the kitchen counter with a whole coffee pot that he held, as if it was a mug. He assumed that he might be genetically predisposed to being an insomniac. "Are you drinking straight out of the pot?", he asked with a smirk and Tony gave him a surprised look.
His chest ached with a bitter sweet pain when he thought of it and Peter knew exactly what it was. It was Wade. Peter was missing him. It was awful and yet relieving at the same time. The distance hurt but it also brought Peter certainty. Certainty that once he was ready he'd still want Wade in his life.
MJ's expression softened at that and she gave in which Peter was thankful for. He really didn't want to make her mad, or anyone for that matter. "Fine, you dumbass.", she agreed but she smiled so Peter could relax a little.
Okay, so obviously Peter knew of gay people. His father and Steve were two men in a relationship, after all. He just hadn't Â known that there was a specific word for it, Peter had sort of assumed that people just dated whoever they fell in love with, unrelated to gender.
"The world thinks you're dead!", MJ pointed out, as if Peter heard that for the first time.
Wade had a weird day. Something about Gwen... bothered him.
MJ seemed to have a pretty guarded demeanor, but once she opened up a bit she was very sardonic, sarcastic and pretty fucking morbid. She said exactly what she thought, not mincing matters and Peter seemed to love it. Bucky thought that it might've had something to do with Peter's annoyance at everyone treating him like he was made of glass.
"Okay. When can we see him?" Wade closed his eyes. This wasn't right. But nothing was anyways.
The boy hesitated, then he shook his head slightly. Right, Bucky knew that feeling. "We met- once. I used to be HYDRA's marionette. I trained you once, you and a girl. They called me the Winter Soldier." The boys eyes grew even larger, if that was even possible, but he still didn't say anything, so Bucky just continued.
"Okay, I've had enough of this. Put your clothes back on.", she ordered, already moving to the door of the studio.
Bucky stared at Peter for a long moment before letting out an even longer sigh. "God, I'm such a bad influence.", he groaned before handing the cigarette off to Peter. He put it between his lips and took a deep breath like Bucky had done. His lungs filled with thick bitter smoke, making everything feel too tight and claustrophobic. Before he knew he was doubled over, having a coughing fit while Bucky laughed at him.
The agents sat Peter down on the chair. They had changed him into blue scrub-like clothes, he was barefoot. Tony thought about someone stripping Peter against his will and he wanted to puke. But that wasn't Â it. They had put Peter into a straitjacket and put a collar on him. Tony recognized the technology, it neutralized Peter's powers.
"You're gorgeous...", Death grinned before waving Wade over to her.
He couldn't think of something less satisfying.
His throat grew tight at the thought of being alone with Steve and Tony. He knew how irrational and maybe even insulting that was but he couldn't help it. He was terrified.
"I don't think that he'll return, pretty sure that he was just a crackhead. ", she then added.
"No. What's your fucking problem? Why can't you let me have this?! Okay, she hasn't talked about her escape in detail yet. So what? Maybe because she isn't ready yet?"
"Peter!", Wade called after him but Peter already slammed the door shut.
' but '
"Does this hurt?", Keipon asked curiously, snapping Peter out of his thoughts by pressing his finger into the bullethole in Peter's shoulder. White hot searing pain shot through him and Peter couldn't keep in the scream. It was agonizing.Â  "I will set you free.", Keipon said with a grin, stepping away from Peter.
A loud bang rang through the room followed by a horrified scream, it took Peter a second to realize that MJ had screamed, and another one to register the bullet wound in his stomach. He pressed his hand against the growing dark spot on his shirt and it came away red. The pain was bad but still manageable. He needed to act quickly, though.
He stopped juggling immediately. Peter wasn't exactly sure why he told Wade that. It kinda just slipped out and he already prepared himself for the inevitable tension but Wade just laughed it off.
"Yeah?", Peter confessed weakly.
"I was just talking to her.", Peter defended himself.
"Don't mention it.", Peter shrugged. He didn't really recognize the person he was back there, he didn't hate it though, he felt good because he helped someone, because he was more than just a problem for once.
"No... nevermind. I'll figure it out. Is that all?", he asked, sounding exhausted. Pepper bit down on her lip for a moment before straightening up a little bit.
"Okay... But you need to promise me to not touch me.", he whispered, his voice shakier than he'd like it to be.
To his surprise Tony started to laugh, softly but it seemed genuine. Peter wasn't sure if he had ever heard him laugh before. "God no. If you turn out to be nothing like me at all, I'd be fine with that. There aren't a whole lot of great traits that you could inherit from me.", he then replied and Peter expected anything but that. What was even more surprising was that it there was no trace of bitterness in his voice. He said it like a fact, which was definitely worse.
Death smiled, or at least Wade thought so, it was kinda hard to tell when she had no skin. "You know I can't let you in."
"Okay... first, where's my dad?", he asked.
He kneeled down next to him and cradled his head on instinct, wiping away some of the blood from the countless cuts on the man's face. Then he froze.
"This isn't funny.", his voice was cold like steel and as sharp as a knife.
a) He could get back in the car and pretend this never happened.
he was strong. But Wade could also see blood where the glass of the screen was cutting his hands. Peter's eyes were squeezed shut and he was trembling.
Alarm bells went off in Wade's head in the form of his boxes laughing manically. "Trust me, you don't wanna see my ugly mug.", he only smirked but Peter didn't let it go this easily.
He didn't, though. Instead Tony gave him a soft look before turning his eyes towards the sky, too. He looked pained and tired. His eyes were rimmed with red, he looked a little gaunt, older than when they first met. Peter realized that he was doing this. "You have no idea how often I've felt that. The thing is, there aren't any easy options. It wasn't easy for Bucky, it was just his only option. If you wanna try SHIELD's method we can do that. But is that really what you want?"
"And after we kissed she was absolutely sure that she never wanted to kiss a guy ever again", Peter explained with chuckle and Vanessa smirked in response.
"Yeah, I think so. Sorry.", she mumbled and she actually sounded guilty which Peter couldn't fucking take. Why would she feel sorry for something when she couldn't help it? It wasn't a big deal?
"What are you doing here?", Peter asked a little breathless. How had he not noticed her when he came out?
"Is HYDRA searching for you?" A nod.
That was unusual. Normally the Fake-Peters were super confident in their heritage. Steve never understood what they were thinking. That they wouldn't make a DNA test? That they'd just believe them? Were these people all delusional?
"Fuck.", Peter hissed in pain, regaining all of their attention. Bucky knelt down next to him, once again taking over for Peter who just leaned back and let the pain wash over him.
Wade could ignore White and Yellow. But there was a third voice. It was the darkes most disgusting part of him, the one he liked to pretend wasn't there. Now it made itself known. Red.
"But you didn't feel anything either. It's fine.", Peter finished for her. Peter got what she ment immediately. She wasn't into him and now she thought that he'd be disappointed. Little did she know that he hadn't enjoyed it much himself either.
Kid didn't flinch, he stared Bucky down. Then he did something Bucky would've never seen coming. "Peter.", he said and his voice was weak and cracked from not being used, but it was much cleared than when he spoke in his sleep. Bucky was absolutely baffled. For a second he thought that he had imagined it and then the boy cleared his throat before saying:"I'm called Peter."
"Look, you can order whatever you want as long as you eat it. ", he stated calmly. Peter didn't react right away. He was staring at the closed menu, gnawing on his lip. With his metabolism he had to be starving.
Even now, when he was sitting in the back of Tony's car, Gwen tucked against his side, her arms wrapped around him, her head resting on his shoulder, it felt unreal.Â  He couldn't stop staring at her, he felt like if he diverted his eyes, she'd dissolve into thin air.
"Peter-", Wade sighed, about to start to argue. He didn't like people bullshitting him. He was aware what he looked like, he had put up with it a long time ago, he didn't need people lying to him about it. But Peter wouldn't listen to him.
"I want to actually start living but I don't know if I can take it." His confession stood between them like a boulder, it demanded all the space, all the space in the room and suddenly Peter was short of breath and so was Wade, like it was suffocating them.
Lots of Peter and Bucky talking in this one! It's also supposed to give a better idea of Peter's petsonality after Shield. A little rougher around the edges, a little harsher. He'll need some time to work through that.
"What am I supposed to do with it?",he asked, glancing at Bucky.
"And- and did you like it?", Wade stammered. This conversation was a fucking rollercoaster.
"I won't say another word. ", he nodded but he was still grinning like a Cheshire cat.
"Why do you sound do sad?", MJ asked, branding a sad smile of her own.
This one turned out longer and fluffier than expected, my evil evil plans were moved back a little but they are still on the horizon.
"I mean, I used to cut Stevie's hair back in the 40s. Been a while since then but I think I'll manage.", Bucky simply shrugged and went to the bathroom. He stepped out with a pair of scissors and clippers.
"No, I don't think you do.", Steve replied, equally as calm as her but there was something behind his tone, a nuance, a wiff of danger, like an oncoming storm.
"That's all very admirable of you and it would be great if we weren't talking about HYDRA here. Who knows what they've done with him.", she returned calmly and now Steve was the one to argue with her.
"Us?", Peter asked. Thus far he had only talked to MJ and he only ever saw her by herself.
This memory was different for some reason. It wasn't as sharp as his other ones, but it wasn't as chaotic either. It was calm. Peter needed a second to realize why that was. Â That this was a memory from before. That the man in it wasn't a HYDRA agent, but Tony.
Amazingly, Peter actually seemed to calm down. His trembling got weaker and he stopped gasping for air and started to breathe semi-normally again. Wade continued to repeat his words until he was sure that Peter had completely calmed down, so much so, that he actually fell asleep.
"Tumblr. With an R.", Wade corrected him.
Peter's first though was that HYDRA found him, the second was that he really shouldn't focus on who shot at their car but the fact that they were currently hurling through the air.
"What don't you understand about 'behave yourself'?", she asked and if looks could kill Natasha would be six feet under by now.
"I wish we could've met sooner.", he admitted and the smile on MJ's face was something heart breaking.
. Sundays are for self care, you know? And there was nothing that made him feel better about himself than bathing in Nazi-blood.
. He was

for a second, trying to come up with the right words. "It's so loud and hectic. It's a lot. This is less...exhausting." Peter glanced over at his father to find a fond expression on his face, a relief.
Gwen landed the plane not long after that. Peter tried to see where they were landing. It didn't seem to be a HYDRA base. It looked pretty broken down, actually. Maybe it used to be a factory or a power plant or something but it had to be long abandoned, Â if HYDRA was holed up here.
, that was definitely worse. Wade thought back to Vanessa and that one time she told him about one of the other hookers she was in contact with. She had a 'permanent arrangement' with a loaded John.
"Are you having a crisis?", she asked with a raised eyebrow, but her smug grin didn't fade.
"As in you can't swim or you don't like it.", MJ questioned.
"No, I'm Deadpool. And I'm sure you're disoriented from playing frosty the snowman but I definitely don't belong to HYDRA.", his tone was chipper.
"That's because I can't.", Peter attempted to joke and MJ let out a snort before turning around to pull the door to the driver's side of the car open.
. They had arrived.
"Where- What happened to him?!", Steve stammered, looking up at Deadpool. The stranger reached into his backpack and pulled out a file that he pressed into Steve's hands. Bile rose up on his throat when he saw the HYDRA logo printed on top.
To their surprise Peter just shrugged slightly before nodding. "Sure."
"Uhhh! Spidermom is finally gonna meet the Spiderson?", he asked excitedly and Peter frowned.
He wasn't dealing with that, though. Not now. "Yeah, yeah, I know. I do listen during my daily talks with Bucky. By now I know his whole speech by heart. About how I'm not what they made me and that it isn't my fault and that I can heal. And that Natasha's is only one way to go about it but I can find another one and bla bla blahh.", he said and maybe sounded a bit more flippant than intended.
"I'll think about it.", Peter said, his tone clipped and Bucky didn't mention it again.
He had stopped pretend-reading and pushed away the tablet, narrowing his eyes at Wade now. "That's not what I ment.", he stated and Wade raised an eyebrow.
"Bullshit, Tony. You don't do vacations. You're an insane workaholic. I'm convinced that you couldn't even rest, if you were dead."
Peter didn't remember dying, he also seemingly didn't remember admitting his feelings and now Wade didn't want to spring the topic on him in case Peter wasn't ready yet.
Peter let out a sigh, stroking through his hair nervously before quickly unfolding himself and jumping from his seat. He started to pace, three steps to the right, three steps to the left, repeat. "No?", he then said, giving Wade a questioning look, not stopping his movement. "I don't know, man. That's the issue. I can't predict when it'll be too much and when I'll be able to handle it. Anything could be a... What you call it again?", Peter asked, snapping with his fingers as he tried to remember the word.
and could continue to live his life normally and Peter? Peter would get by somehow. He had to.
"Yeah, like romantically interested in each other. Are you and MJ-", he started and understanding flashed through Peter's face. The boy then promptly cut him off, releasing Bucky from his misery.
"I don't know what a meme is.", he replied.
Tony didn't lose hope, not for a second and that was the first truth he discovered. He couldn't, not now, not when he just got his son back.
"Of course, I think it's a pretty universal experience.", his father replied simply.
They just stood like this for several minutes, just clinging to each other like their lives depended on it. It hit Wade in that moment that he'd never seen Peter so fearlessly vulnerable with someone. Sure, Peter had broken down in front of him in the past, but it had always brought a load of shame for him. There was none of that now and Wade realized that that was because Peter trusted Gwent unconditionally, completely, something that no one else, including Wade, had achieved yet.
His eyes were focused on Wade's masked face and for a while that was the only thing he did, stare at Wade silently. It was really intense in a weird way. Then:"Can you take off the mask?"
Gaunt, sickly looking, dull eyes, almost cadaverous. It was a huge contrast to the fact that the man, or boy, was wearing a bright colored Hawaiian shirt.
Peter wasn't thrilled about the prospects of meeting new people but he could see why it was a necessity. Their secret was out, at least partially. The other Avengers knew of his existence and wanted to meet him, Peter would comply. Thankfully they kept it all manageable, no huge groups, they didn't force him to talk and everybody stayed far away from him except for Wade, who he didn't mind.
"So you're into girls.", Peter stated. It wasn't a question but MJ still nodded.
Their first meet up was scheduled for the next day. Tony didn't sleep. He spend the entire night curled against Steve's side, staring at the ceiling. He felt like he did the wrong thing but he also had no idea what the right choice would've been.
Gwen looked at Peter and he made a point to take a big bite off his sandwich. She then did the same, daring to eat more.
Tony didn't know what to think of this Deadpool guy. On the one hand he had the feeling that he wasn't taking this seriously enough. His mood was too upbeat, he cracked jokes and stuff. On the other hand he rescued Tony's son,Â  brought him home,Â  and genuinely seemed to care about him.
Peter didn't sleep anymore. At least it didn't feel like sleep. He didn't get tired and he didn't feel rested afterwards. He just went to bed and when his mind shut off he found himself in the same dream. At least he thought it was a dream. It somehow felt more real while also making absolutely no sense.
"I guess so. See you later, Peter." With that she turned around and left through the entrance of the motel.
When it was all done he sat down beside Gwen and started to eat. Today she didn't reach out to him. She just stared at the food in front of her, not making a move to eat it.
"Rogers, I'm concerned for the safety of civilians. If that sets back one man's recovery for a bit, I can stomach that. "
"I don't know, you two seem very close. Not saying that you gotta be. If you're not, you're not.", Tony simply shrugged. He didn't seem bothered by it at all, so Peter felt like maybe it was okay to talk about this.
After careful delibiration, as careful as a panicking mind could delibirate, Peter charged forward and slammed his hand onto the button, hopefully activating an alarm or something that would alert his family.
"He never forgot you. ", he told her because it was true and he felt like she might like to hear that.
"So you want me to leave?" The words just burst out of him and he hated how panicked he sounded.
Peter continued to get his bed ready as he replied:" She asked me if I want to go out for a movie and grab some dinner afterwards." Peter sounded so nonchalant about it, that Bucky figured that Peter didn't know the implications of that. He could be wrong but it sounded like MJ asked Peter out on a date and Bucky wasn't sure if he liked it.
Bucky had a question on his mind, he had a lot of them actually and he wasn't sure, if now was the right time to ask.
"For a spy you're a shit liar.", Peter snapped but it wasn't as sharp as he probably intended. He leaned his head against the window again, staring outside once more. Bucky didn't want him to get lost in his head again, didn't want him to drift to the places that Bucky couldn't reach. But he also didn't know what the right thing to say was. He had no idea.
Peter would've probably charged at her, if Bucky hadn'tÂ grabbed a hold of the back of his jacket. Instead he settled on yelling at her as Bucky held him back.
Peter was in quite the mood when they returned to their appartment in the avengers facility. He quickly crossed the livingroom where Wade was laying on the couch and disappeared in his room, slamming the door behind him.
"Who knows about him?"
"You're her. Lady Death. ", he realized and fake-Wade grinned before his skin and flesh started to melt away. Suddenly Peter was sitting next to a skeleton that was dressed in a black coat and he was looking into empty eye sockets.
"I'm coming but it'll take forever to get to New York. ",he replied.
Peter wanted to cry at that, he couldn't even define the feeling she gave him. "I love you, too. "
"What do you mean?", Peter asked. He didn't sound focused or curious or upset. He sounded...wrong.
I know I said this already but we are pretty much through the worst of it for now, things go uphill from here. Welcome to the Bucky/Peter road trip part of the story with a few adventures and a bunch of angst and fluff and HEALING.
Still, Wade knew that Peter wouldn't like this and just like he predicted the boy gave him a sharp look in response before saying:"I thought I made myself clear. I'm not talking about this. Though I am curious what you mean by 'as well'?"
Wade didn't hang around for long after Peter left. Would've felt weird to stay with the superdads while their son was cruising the country on a self discovery trip. So he bounced, took off back to NY in another one of Tony's seemingly endless cars.
Wade knew that, he knew that she warned him but he was stupid and desperate for love so he did this to himself and now he needed her help.
The strangers voice was distant, like Peter was under water and soon it became hard to listen. Soon, all he could hear was his own wheezing breath and a song. It was one of Wade's, the ones from his car. The dark and melancholic ones. Peter wasn't sure if it was playing or if he was only remembering the words but they rattled through his mind.
Wade didn't start the day planning for it to go like this. Well, kinda. He did plan on infiltrating a HYDRA base and killing everyone there to the sound of '
Bucky tried to process all of this. Somehow he had a kid now, a kid that was on the run from HYDRA and maybe someone else. A kid that either didn't want to or couldn't talk to him, a kid who's name he didn't even know. A kid that was fucking terrified.
"Yeah, I didn't get much sleep last night, sorry. ",Wade yawned, stretching a bit and it would've been quite cute if he didn't say that every day.
"Uhh... I have a couple conditions but otherwise, yeah, you can go. ", Bucky finally nodded and a small smile spread on Peter's face.
. Peter collapsed on the floor, staring up at the stars. The concrete floor was still slightly warm from the sun, and even now, in the middle of the night, it wasn't that cold.
"Okay. ", Tony finally said and Peter raised his eyebrows in surprise. He hadn't actually expected this to be so easy.
'"Hey, Peter, listen to me. Everything's going to be fine!", Peter could hear Wade's voice but it was like someone stuffed cotton balls in his ears or like he was under water. It was far away and the alarm bells in Peter's mind were so deafening that he couldn't focus on the words.
Wade chuckled at that. "Yeah, but Janna can't be bothered with realism so consider me a young prodigy. I'm the Mozart of killing people." That reply didn't clear anything up for Peter but he also felt like he wouldn't get a satisfying explanation, even if he asked so he dropped it.
and worry
Wade gave him a nod and pulled out his katanas. Outside the guards were dropping like flies and when they finally stepped onto the courtyard Tony had cleared the way to the entrance.
"Let's pretend that I don't. ", Peter replied carefully but MJ was already beyond baffled.
that was intoxicating, Wade would never deny that he enjoyed it. Killing for the right reason was a thrill and what could be a better reason than Peter?
I hope you enjoy the chapter and leave a comment!
our journey to your Tinman daddy tomorrow."
Death chuckled and it sounded like bones rattling together.
"You see, I didn't really plan on stumbling into you. But even if I did, low profile isn't really my style. If it was I wouldn't be wearing this bright-red full-body-condom every day.", Deadpool, or Wade, smirked.
"I prefer to not look at myself. Describe it to me.", he said before letting his hands wander through it.
A deep breath, an even deeper sigh and Peter closed his eyes. "Nevermind.", he shrugged but it sounded so fucking pained that it crushed Bucky's heart.
"No...", he whispered, his eyes still wide with fear.
He turned his head even though it hurt and there was a man up front, driving the car. The stranger turned his head and glanced at Peter but Peter couldn't read his expression. "You're awake. Stay with me kid, okay?"
"He- he flipped, ran out the room I think.", Wade croaked out before getting to his feet and helping Tony up as well.
, he hadn't missed this kind of pain, concentrated and intense.
Anyways,  I hope you enjoyed this one and leave a comment!
(See the end of the chapter for
The door to the room was slammed open and Ironman and his team piled into the room. "Peter-?!", Tony yelled before freezing, his eyes on where Wade and Gwen were hunched over Peter's lifeless body.
- plea- Gwe- please-"
Silence filled the space between them, thick and suffocating. Wade was the first one to break it. "And you signed that shit?!"
Wade didn't really think about where he was taking Peter. It was a given. Bring the boy back to his father. That didn't mean that it wasn't thoroughly discussed by his boxes. A conversation he tried to tune out to the best of his abilities. "Shut the fuck up.", he finally spat at Yellow just to realize that Peter was not only awake, but also staring at him.
"Because I promised to stay until you feel ready to be on your own.", Wade replied truthfully. No, it had absolutely nothing to do with the fact that he was growing attached to the Spider-Boy, no, nada.
"Right now someone should watch you, you may seem non-violent but that can change rapidly." Wade noticed how Bucky addressed Peter directly, not talking over his head. Peter didn't seem to appreciate it all that much.
"Peter?", his fathers voice called out for the first time in months. He sounded hopeful, Peter was too tired to make an effort.
"It has come to my attention that my team has not been forthcoming about the Loki incident. Particularly concerning our certain man out of time." He looked at him then.
Persuaded by Tonyâs words, Steve finally seemed to get the message and progressed in making quick work of stretching Tony open. Steve always loved spending time just working Tony open, he used to say it was one of his favourite parts, but that was not what Tony wanted now.
No, there was simply nothing left for him to do.
Time Travel was tricky, but as Bruce had explained to him after his discussion with the Ancient One, he had to make sure that the stones did not leave the timeline for more than a split second. He had already returned the time stone to the Ancient One at the exact moment Bruce had left with it, but had to re-time his return of the mind stone to the moment Scott had left.
"But look, that's what I was looking over. In the first battle, you recall how Wanda had destroyed vision?" Steve got out. He needed to get Bruceâs attention before he turned the whole conversation into making sure Steve didnât blame himself. This wasnât about that.
âTony... Tony, let me do it.â Steve got up, gently easing Tony off his dick, and bringing him in for another kiss. Tony went along with it, deciding to give in just a little. Steve's fingers had always felt better then his own.
"You're not leaving yet are you?" Tony also got up in alarm. "We still haven't come up with a contingency for if or when this Thanos guy comes here."
Tony sprang from the couch and just like that, Steve had brought him back into chaotic action.
Steve opened his hand to reveal an old baseball, and Tony saw Steve take a sharp intake of breath at the site of it.
"Okay first of all, I know for a fact that you're supposed to be handing in your tech designs today for S.I., because you've been complaining about it non-stop for a week now. And second of all, we both know that school's not really the issue here, you could do the course work in your sleep."
âOkay, wait. I can explain!â Tony started to clamour out. âThere is totally a justifiable reason why I have a room filled with your things... I just need to find it.â
"Hey, we're family." He said to her. A look of warmth spread across her face then, and Steve finally felt like everything was going to be all right again. He was going home.
âNo way, Steve donât lie to me, if you donât feel the same way just tell me. You donât need to pretend with me, I know that there is no possible way that you would like me baââ This time Tony got cut off by Steve pulling him in for a kiss.
Tony couldnât help but shudder. He was utterly useless when Steve used his bedroom voice with him. But he shook his head, as if to clear his head from the heat that had started to build up. He had to get this out. For Steve.
â... and Iâm so sorry, Tony.â Steve had finished saying, as Tony tuned in.
Once he received affirmations from the group, he indicated towards Bruce, and they promptly left.
Steve had found himself smiling then too, it looked like they were on for a second time heist.
Tony was just finishing up with the specs for the latest weapons tech he had crafted for Stark Industries, when he got the call from Rhodey.
But then in perhaps an even more of a surprise than Future Steve wielding the Hammer, he said âGod Tony, I just-â before he grabbed and pulled Stark into a hug all while he then proceeded to cry into his neck.
âOh, oops. I just thought it was a regular baseball.â
"She was the one to propose it, yes."
But as with all things that Howard possessed, he eventually abandoned both his search for Steve Rogers and the collection. And as with all things that Howard abandoned, Tony was quick on the uptake.
Stark himself also seemed to been taken aback by this, as he halted and blinked back at Future Steve.
"But bringing them back here would still affect that timeline and create a divergence." Bruce started with a contemplative look. "However, it may be possible for extraction if it seemed as if there was no extraction in the first place."
They quickly made their way up to the Quinjet dispatch area and boarded the plane.
Steve went back to kissing Tony, pushing him back onto the bed, getting in a few more thrusts before he came as well. He kissed Tony a couple more times for extra measure, before slumping in complete exhaustion.
âTony, what do you mean?â
Everyone then sort of ended up looking towards Steve as the only one left who had yet to say anything and whom had had a very pinched look on his face.
His team consisted of himself and Clint, where they had to go back and retrieve the reality Stone from Jane - again. On second thought, Steve did envy Bruce, he clearly had the easier task.
Steve picked up Tonyâs hands and rubbed the back of them as he continued on.â And people who have a room filled with things of mine because they understand who I am, and being close to that comforts them. Tony, even if I didnât love you before how could I possibly not love you now knowing how much you care and completely get me?â
Tony placed his hands down onto Steveâs pecs, and lifted himself off Steveâs hard dick. Come dripped out of Tonyâs hole and back onto Steveâs dick, coating it in a sleek shiny white layer.
âTony, I, just, thank you,â Steve finally settled on. âThis means a lot to me.â
âWow okay, so you can control Thorâs Hammer, thatâs pretty impressive there Houdini, but how does that prove we should trust you.â Stark walks up from behind them and Steve- Future Steveâs whole body visibly tensed before going slack.
Tony didnât finish his statement, because he went right back to kissing Steve again, as if he couldnât bare to spend too long without kissing the man. Fingers tangled themselves into Steveâs longer slicked back strands, and Tony moaned at the feeling of running his hands through them.
Suddenly, he felt so overwhelmed by everything that was occurring. He felt a creeping sense of panic building up upon him. Please no, he didn't need this right now. He needed, he needed -
I can't love, shot full of holes
"You what!" Tony screamed. He felt his heart rabbiting in his chest.
"I will need the reality stone now, please step back and I will begin the isolation process."
Up front was the uniform that Captain America wore when he went on his first ever heroic mission to rescue Sergeant James Barnes. At least, thatâs what the auctioneer told the crowd.
It wasn't fair. That he was still here and those that had only just started to live their lives, wouldn't even be able to live them to their fullest.
. . .
Looking up, Tony saw that the item was definitely something to behold.
And surely, Tony stopped. Turning his head to look at Steve, now displaying wide eyes of his own; disbelieving but daring to hope.
Luckily, seeing Tony all flustered had brought back Steveâs confidence.
That had been an important moment in Tonyâs life; after obtaining this particular item at the auction, Howard had begun to search for any item pertaining to Captain America. Tony hadnât understood why at first, but he was always eager to see what particular item Howard had brought home that day. It wasnât until later that Tony found out Howard had collected those items in the hopes of keeping the memory of Steve Rogers alive and provide motivation to find him.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yes."
To say that Tony was shocked, was an understatement. He couldn't believe all of what would happen to him and the rest of the world.
"I'm going to have to agree with Clint on this one as well, having you here would help us to avoid past mistakes Captain."
"Oh, ya... Ha! Yes! You got me. Just trying to..." Tony had trailed off, running his hand through his hair. "You know,â He waved his hands in the air, âbreak the ice so to speak."
"He must have suspended the reality around Vision at a singular point, and then altered the time only within Vision's body." Bruce had excitedly cut in, seeming to now grasp what Steve had only just begun to understand.
"You know we'll always worry Tony," Rhodey said with a soft voice, "but yes this will help."
The collection had actually been started by Howard. After his death, there had been two major things that Howard had passed on to Tony. The first being his favour for the bottle, and the second his dedication to Captain America.
This was it, this was the moment that Tony knew he couldnât go back. Steve would leave taking everything with him, and Tony would finally have to learn to cope without him.
One of his fingers drew a lazy circle around his entrance, causing Tony to bite the lobe of his ear in impatience. âAnytime this century, old man.â
Tony was sleeping. The trip back had been a little too much for him; he had promptly passed out upon their return.  Steve freaked out of course, but Bruce had been there to reassure them; picking up Tony and looking him over enough to deem it was due to fatigue and residual power convergence from the stones. Whatever that meant. Steve just relieved that Tony would be fine after some rest.
"Steve," Bruce cut in. "This wasn't all on you, we lost together."
After everything I've ever learned
He could feel the beginnings of Steveâs arousal too, as it was still inside of him, and he entwined his fingers into Steveâs hair to hold him there, as he sucked on Tonyâs chest.
Steve, who had been carrying a bag full of paints and a canvas under his arm, had barely been able to keep everything under wraps upon hearing the bold words.
He looked to Tony then, eyes trailing over the sleeping manâs form.  Steveâs heart broke at the fragile sight the man presented. Ever so tentatively, Steve reached out and grasped Tonyâs hand, holding it in his own. He couldnât erase the past, and he wouldnât even if he could; it brought him here to this point in time where he now fully understood this man and how far he could go for the people he cared about.
"Okay, what!? Sharon and Cap had a falling out?" That was news to him. "When did that happen?" Last Tony heardâaccording to the fan pages that he definitely did not followâthose two were still cozing it up on the daily.
For so long he had operated on the basis of the next mission, the next life to save. The next, the next, the next.
"What?" Tony blinked. He hadn't expected that response.
If only they hadnât left so much unresolved...
âLetâs get back,â Steve smiles, â I canât have you staying out so late on the first date.â He gives a wink and tentatively grabs Tonyâs hand again, while he starts to walk them back to the Tower.
"So you don't really have much of a reason to not give it a try, Tony. You might as well audition, the worst that could happen is that you don't get it. Even just auditioning would be great for you. I know how much you miss singing. Besides, you really need to get out for a bit and have some interactions that aren't with machines. Pepper called you know, she's worried you're gonna spend the whole month holed up in your lab."
He kissed along it, his rough beard leaving red scrape marks along the sensitive part of Tonyâs neck and collarbone.
The point was, that despite the battle they had just won, Tony was well aware they would still have to face a greater foe from up there. It was disappointing to learn that he had been unable to prepare for it regardless.
âHey, Iâll leave you to take a look at everything, you know, check it all out.â Tony tried to inch away. He wanted to leave Steve with his things, thinking that he might prefer to go through it all without Tony breathing down his neck.
"Oh." Well he didn't have much to say to that.
"So you're telling me, you want to go back to the past and use the time stone to save Nat and Tony?" Bruce spoke in between bites of his egg, while seated at their local diner. The disbelief was apparent on his face.
It was a deep kiss. Steve had one hand entwined into Tonyâs hair tilting his head, while the other was curved around his waist, holding him close.
It had shown up on his doorstep via delivery man in all its sleek metal grey glory, looking like it had come to life straight from Steveâs fantasies.
He needed to feel it back on his skin, roughing him up.
Tony dug his hand back into Steveâs hair and pulled back, only to push him back onto his nipple, letting out a simple command to
And that was just so like Tony wasn't it? For him to still be the one to help Steve find a home, despite being gone.
They had formed two teams for the infinity stone retrieval. Bruce and the Doctor were being sent back to 2012, to ask the Ancient One for the time stone - again. Steve did not envy them in their task.
"Not the first time around." He tried to state plainly, but a little bit of resentment might have shone through, if Bruce's furrowed brow was to be believed.
It was only when Steve had walked towards the room and started opening the door that Tony had realized.
âY-yeah.â Tony croaked out, He tried to build up his nerve to break the news to Steve, but it was extremely difficult when you were being cuddled by the man you love. Especially when he had clearly just come out from the showerâ probably to wash away the sweat from the workout he just did, and didnât that give Tony a whole new set of imagesâ smelling like a fresh breeze and something so distinctly Steve.
He gave it a tentative lick, before engulfing it whole. Back then, he couldnât do this as easily as he could now, it was a skill he had acquired only after spending an obscene amount of time on it all those years ago. He stopped that trail of thought.
âOkay, J.â Tony said with a little panic in his voice. He abruptly swept away the files he had been working on pertaining to Ultron. He wasn't ready to share the idea with anyone else other than Bruce until he was sure that he could get it to work.
"I know, Tony." Rhodey softly spoke, affection evident in his tone. " But that's precisely why I signed you up to audition for lead singer at your favourite rock band."
"Not really."
Strange however,  still seemed to need more convincing, so Bruce had tried a different approach. "Strange, I know you don't know us very well, but you did fight Thanos up there with Tony. Surely you must have seen the type of man he was. The world's not ready to be without Tony Stark."
"Uh, sometime last week, I think. There's not much information as to why, just a brief statement released about respecting privacy and that they're holding auditions this coming Wednesday.â
But I want love, just a different kind
By this point Tony had completely zoned out. He had perfected the look of appearing interested while actually running calculations or developing designs in his head.
It had all started when Steve a little desperate for cash had agreed to paint a nude portrait for an acquaintance of Natasha's. Steve was an art student at the neighbouring community college, while Tony - the subject of the aforementioned painting - was a bright young PhD student at MIT.
âStill going commando, huh.â Tony said more to himself then to Steve, but Steve still responded by saying, âGuess, old habits die hard.â
âUh did this guy just say his name is Ironman? Like thatâs his actual name?â Clint exclaimed, up from his spot at the end.
Steve blinked. He had not been expecting... whatever that was.
"Ok, now I'm not following." He sent Bruce a look of confusion. Steve had a feeling that he was getting way in over his head.
Tony didnât know how to respond to that, other than you know completely bursting into tears, again. Seriously, it was beginning to annoy him just how emotional he was being today.
âTony, I do love you, this isnât me saying it to appease you. When I first woke up from the Ice, I was so lost. I had nothing and no one left from my past. Tony, you were the first person to give me a home. Not just some place to live in, but a place where I could be myself and was surrounded by people who cared about me. People who didnât just treat me as Captain America, but Steve Rogers. People who went out of their way to make sure I knew how every little thing in the 21 century worked. People who spent so much time sending me adorable puppy videos and funny messages so they could make me laugh.â Tony let a small smile slip out at those words, he couldnât help it, he was guilty of always sending Steve a ton of shit so that he could get a cute response.
They stayed like that for a couple minutes. Tony sitting on Steve erection, rocking it into a straining bulge, while Steve hugged him and buried his face in Tony's neck.
So many impossible things have happened in his life, but it seemed that no matter what, he was doomed to be forever mourning his past.
It was a good thing that Steve had confronted him in Tonyâs room, because he didnât think he would have had it in him to not just fuck Steve wherever they had happened to be, location be damned.
Finally,  Nat opened her mouth and said, "Well not all at once boys." The dam broke, and all at once they were rushing up to go and hug her.
Steve had propped himself up on his elbows then, eyes straight on Tony, a look with unsaid emotions running between them.
âI, er, was wondering if I could take you out some time.â Steve sheepishly repeated while rubbing the back of his neck. âFor dinner.â he added.
Letting go of Tonyâs nipple, Steve brought his head back up and gave Tony a filthy kiss, his tongue finding Tonyâs, while he moaned into the kiss. âCould just keep you under me and fuck you for days Tony. You feel so hot and wet for me.â
â Hey Tony, J.A.R.V.I.S. told me you wanted to see me for something?â Steve said, while he walked right up to him and wrapped his arms right around Tony. His fingers curled right around Tonyâs waist and he pulled him in for a tight squeeze. Caught off guard, Tony still felt himself melt into the hugâallowing himself just this tiny bit of comfort before he had to do the inevitable.
Tony grabbed the front of Steveâs shirt and proceeded to walk himself backwards towards his bed, dragging Steve along, all the while never breaking their kiss.
Fuck, it was still so fucking big. The length wasnât too bad, just slightly longer than his. It was the girth of it that had Tony pressing a hand to cup his own cock; easing the edge off at the thought of Steveâs cock stuffing him full.
I want love, won't break me down
Steve was brought out of his inner thoughts, when the door to the meeting room he and the rest of the team were at was opened and in walked Nick Fury and Agent Hill.
Tony yanked Steveâs head down and kissed him as deeply as he could. Steve stood there dumbstruck, taking all of Tonyâs ferocity as he kissed him senseless.
And that was how they spent the rest of the evening. Going through all the items Tony had obtained throughout the years, while Steve shared his memories of them from before the ice.
Steve should have known better than to believe anything Loki had to say, but the comment had come out of nowhere and had completely thrown him for a loop. Loki had said Bucky and it was like Steve was that little kid from Brooklyn again.
Steve who had felt the same guilt that Clint was, didn't bother to convince him otherwise. Bruce had given it a shot, talking about how his family needed him, and not to worry, they would come back with Nat in tow, but Clint stayed put.
He was shocked to find that he was starting to get aroused again. He hadnât had this fast a refractory period since... since a while.
And Steve now knew that Tony hadnât moved on either. The proof was in way Tony had looked at him when he finally had managed to pluck the courage to go visit him. It was in the way that Tony had ripped his heart out and given it to him after calling him out on not being there for him. It was in the way Tony had admitted heâd missed Steve, hiding his true feelings in the plain sight of his witty comments.
Tony gave the signal and music started to play, and a deep baritone voice filled the room.
Tony was abruptly brought out of his longing gaze towards the Captain, when he saw those deep blue eyes turn to meet his dark amber ones.  He quickly avoided Capâs gaze and brought his attention back up to the front, and was startled to see the girl who had signed in just before him make her way down the stage. He blushed as he realized that they had actually been calling his name to come up on stage and he had been too engrossed in his thoughts of Cap to pay attention.
Despite the warning, Steveâs eyes went wide. The earlier words had him hoping, but to hear them so vividly in the moment for the first time was too novel for him to not be anything but completely stunned.
"I too am in accordance with the Hawk Man,-â âDude, itâs Hawkeye.â -you must stay and assist us in this endeavour to rid the planet of this Thermos. "
âOh, well, you can have it all back if youâd like. Itâs all your stuff to begin with,â Tony told Steve. He was still a bit mortified at being caught having a room filled with all of Steveâs things, but the man just seemed to be happy to see something familiar for once. Emboldened by the thought, Tony took a step further and added, âBesides, if you move in like I offered, you wonât even have to go through all the hassle of moving everything!â
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve was ready to call the whole thing a bust, gather up his shredded dignity, and try approaching Sharon to give them another go-when Steve noticed that the final auditionee had yet to approach the stage despite his name being announced. He turned to take a look around the now sparsely occupied room, only to find dark amber eyes staring directly at him.
I want love on my own terms
But he's back, and he's reported that the stones have been successfully returned, and now there's nothing left. No new world to go explore and get acquainted with, no new recruits to train, no Bucky to find and save now that he was back to his old self; well as much as he could be. But Bucky had Sam now, who for some reason had formed a grudging alliance with his best friend.  And to be honest, Sam was much better equipped to deal with the sort of trauma that Bucky would need help with.
Even before the serum, Steve was always doing his best for everyone. Despite his small stature he was always standing up to bullies, ready to fight for what he believed in. He didnât have much to his name, but he still helped those less fortunate and always volunteered at his local soup kitchen every Wednesday without fail. Steve was very much a good man, and he made Tony want to do better, be better.
They had done it. They had rescued Nat and Tony! And it had all gone down without too much difficulty.
So ya, dating, not something Tony excelled at, and frankly, not something most people wanted from him anyway. Which was fine, because if he had the option he wouldnât want to date himself either. So you can see how it came as a huge shock when Captain America asked him out.
There were sudden collective gasps and a few people getting up from their chairs in excitement and then quickly sitting themselves downâas if remembering to maintain some semblance of their esteemed reputations. His father himself was one of these people, and that was what brought Tonyâs attention back to the front.
"Steve, I - what?" He spoke, confusion laced his voice. What had happened? Why was he here? Hadn't he died with his final act as Ironman?
But Steve surprised him when, he said he would actually prefer if they went through everything together. He said he wanted to share his memories of the items with Tony, and maybe even find out where he found each item. He also figured it would be nice, after all the effort Tony went through in order to get it all.
As a boyfriendâand didnât that still send those thrills down his spineâSteve was practically perfect. He made sure Tony got some sleep every now and then when heâd been up for too long. Took him out on dates whenever they could find the time in between missions. But most importantly he let Tony also have his space and time to do what he needed. Not that heâd ever admit it, but a small part of Tony had been a little worried that Steve, like Howardâand a few past ârelationshipsââwould find it necessary to dictate what he could and couldnât do with his time. God knows Howard had done nothing but turn his mother into a puppet since they got married. But his worries were unfounded, Steve seemed to completely understand Tonyâs need for both company and space.
They made their way over to the top of the cliff. Past Clint had just left the scene, and they stepped up to look down over the cliff.
âMy brother is a gifted sorcerer yes, but master of midgardian technology is not one of his many talents, he must of had help.â Thor added.
'Well that explains why Cap had turned to look at me' Tony thought, as he was now the last person to in the room left to yet audition.
He slid down Steveâs body then, inserting himself between Steveâs legs and opening his pants just enough for Steveâs dick to spring free.
Resigned to his fate, Strange gave a sigh, and breathed out, "I'm going to regret this."
The flattery, or slight mockery depending on the way you took it, seemed to work, as Strange contemplated the possibility.
He ran his hand over one of the tables in the roomâa wooden one, that had a rickety leg--he said he remembered it from way back when he and Buck used to eat on it in their younger days. Apparently Bucky had always complained about it and said that they should fix it, but they never quite got around to it.
âI Love you, too, Tony.â
Kissing Steve is like nothing heâs ever felt. He feels warm, secure, and just happy.
â...â
"Gasp! Nat agrees with me, I want this day written down in the history books!" She whacked his head at the comment.
The event had started out as they all normally did. There was expensive jewelry that once belonged to a queen, a gold record signed and dated by a famous blues singer, and various other belongings of famous and important people. It wasnât until the end when they released their biggest item of the day, that things got really interesting.
An Elton John song, but Tony had sung the song with such a raw emotion and desperation that Steve almost believed it had been written specifically for him. It was not easy to take an Elton John song and make it sound like your own, but Tony had managed to do it. Steve was impressed. If they had a voice like Tonyâs to work with, Steve could almost imagine the new direction they could take their music and lyrics...
The words shot straight to Tonyâs dick. Steve being filthy in bed wasnât too rare a sight back then, but paired with the fucking rugged caveman look that had started this whole fucked up occurrence in the first place? Had Tony whimpering. He quickly made himself spread his legs, exposing his entrance before Steve could say anything more.
Steve grabbed the lube once again, and slathered it onto his dick before crawling over so that he was now lined up right against Tonyâs hole.
"Hey Honey Bear, you miss me already?' Tony exclaimed with a false cheeriness to his voice. There was also a hint of betrayal unnoticeable to most, but Rhodey unfortunately was not most.
Well there was no better time than the present. Tony figured that if Steve wouldnât dump his pathetic ass, Tony owed it to himâand heck the rest of the worldâto do it for him. Steve deserved better, he was just to stubborn and loyal to realise it. Sure it would break Tonyâs heart, but what was one more broken heart in Tonyâs lifelong collection. He would rather a broken heart than living with the guilt he knew he would always feel knowing that he was the one dragging Steve down. Steve would be upset initially, but once he got over it and actually put himself out there, heâd realise how much of a dead weight Tony actually was in his life. Really, Tony was doing Steve a favour.
âWhat? What is it!?â Tony eagerly said as he peered over his shoulder. âOh, itâs your baseball. I used to play with it all the time in this room.â
Steve hadnât realized he had a Sugar Daddy, until Bucky pointed it out to him. Although to be fair, Steve didn't think you could have a Sugar Daddy who was both younger than you and who received no sexual favours whatsoever in return.
âName, age, and occupation.â
âI love you, too.â
The doors opened revealing himself; clearly Loki was not yet done pretending to be him.
Steve however, continued his lazy prodding, which made  Tony grab a fist full of Steveâs hair to pull him back, giving him a deep but quick kiss, before breaking it and speaking against his lips. âCâmon Steve, stop teasing me, or Iâll do it myself.â
Extracting Tony had required exact timing and precision. They could have stopped time, brought him back to life and taken him back home, but that would have mysteriously left no body for the rest of them to mourn once they were gone.
So much had happened since the Avengers first met on the quinjet. Many ecstatic victories and heartbreaking losses. And at the centre of it all was their relationship. The dynamic between Tony and Steve had always shaped the team, and nothing had ever felt right since his departure.
âWhaâSteve?â Tony asked, he was at a total loss as to what was happening.
âI canât believe...I justâI thought Iâd never see it again. I thought Iâd never see any of these things again,â Steve said, in supposed awe of the many things dispersed in the room.
Steve spoke up then, "Only we don't want to prevent their deaths, just reverse the effects death had on their bodies."
Sitting at the left end of the table facing the stage was the drummer of the band who was known as Hawkeye. He was notorious for doing tricks with his drumsticks and throwing them with scarily good precision at fans who were being terrible. Despite the antics he had quite the following as he played both the drums and electric keyboard beautifully even while needing hearing aids for being nearly deaf in both ears. Tony felt a strange kinship towards him and couldnât quite help but like him.
He has to report that he's completed the mission; the procedure is ingrained in his entire being.
Steve starts leaning in, and Tony finds his brain short circuit. This is it, heâs about to kiss Captain America, his childhood hero, now teammate and maybe something more. Just before their lips touch, Steve pauses and whispers against his lips âCan I kiss you?â And Tony just closes eyes and nods against Steveâs lips, a hairâs width apart.
âGlad to see you two slow pokes finally made it!â Clint yelled out.
âI hope Iâm not being too forward.â He says, as he gestures towards their entwined hands, Tony feels his face heat as he shake his head, and Steve beams at him.
Steve disregarded their conversation and stepped up onto the platform; looking around to the people in the room. He stated the plan.  "We go back, retrieve the stones, and then jump to the specified time at Volmir."
Steve looked at him completely scandalized. âTony, this isnât just any baseball, this is the baseball the Dodgers used when they scored their home run hit back in '41!â
Maybe that's why he was still here. There was still a Tony Stark in this universe and by god if he had been given a second chance to do right by him, he was going to give it his all.
, started to enter him then. The slow burn giving way to both pleasure and pain. But fuck, if this wasnât what Tony wanted. No, needed.  God, how he missed this. Just him, Steve, and this slow build up of sensations until eventual oblivion was reached.
âSpread your legs for me Tony, I want to see you open yourself up for me.â
Once he was satisfied with his collection and done what he could, Tony had a whole room to house it. He still had J.A.R.V.I.S. notify him if anything new popped up, but for the most part he was pretty content with everything he had obtained.
âWell, considering how he's capable of making anyone his personal flying monkey, I wouldnât be surprised if there were still a couple of people under his control from the sceptre.â Clint piped up from his spot, casually upkeeping his bow with a concentrated focus. Steve could tell the thought of people being out there still under Lokiâs control was not a comforting notion to the man.
"Uhh," had been all that Steve had gotten out. The whole thing had been so over the top that Steve could only think that it was some sort of an elaborate joke.
"Tony," Rhodey sighed. "I'm only going to be gone for a month. It's the standard amount of time served, plus you know I already turned them down on their early offer, so I'll be back for start of semester."
âJust, you know...â Tony shrugged, not really giving an answer. Steve let it go for now, instead he seemed to bring his attention back to the things in the room.
âThatâs not...â But Steve trailed off, unsure as to what he was trying to say.
âYa, Iâm gonna have to agree with Legolas over there, so you got anything else for us fake Cap?â He turned back to face Future Steve, quirking a brow to urge a response to his words.
Bruce got up from the table then, and made sure to leave a hefty tip plus the cost of the food at the table - Bruce was doing well these days now that he could safely stay in one place long enough to hold a job - and Steve got up to follow him. He made a mental note to find some time later to pay Bruce back. Right now they had someone to meet.
The room itself was pretty grand. It had two large grid windows on either side of the room with heavy ornate burgundy curtains alongside them. The floors were of hardwood with rich oak colours to give the room an elegant feel. The items themselves were placed in such a way that contrasted with the elegant architecture.
âOn a date.â  Steve confirmed, while looking Tony in the eyes and giving him a firm nod to further confirm his words.
The words seemed to affect Strange as well, which piqued Steveâs interest. He wasnât aware that this man knew Tony well enough to garner such a reaction. "For the few moments that I knew Stark, he was full of himself and an arrogant prick. However, that was only on the surface..." He trailed off, perhaps in thought his past encounters with Tony, when they were up in space. Steve swallowed around that odd feeling that always showed up whenever he thought about Tony up there in space without him.
âOoh, whoâs Goose I gotta know if it can manage to make Mr. Eyepatch here thunderstruck.â Tony perked up.
Steeling his nerves, he brought forth his signature Tony Stark public persona and took the last step towards the mike.
The man-Tony, as Phil was announcing in the mike-seemed to all of a sudden come to an awareness that Steve had met his eyes and abashedly turned his head. His interest piqued, he watched in amusement as the flustered man flung himself up and all but dashed to the stage.
"Ya, they aren't particularly looking for a female. Just anyone with a unique or distinctive sound. Apparently they are using this opportunity to reinvent and change up their music."
Steve handed him the stone, and the rest stepped back, while Strange began his magic. They watched as Strange floated down, and knelt next to Nat's broken body. It was even harder to see now, so Steve looked away, and a moment later there was a flash of red light followed by a flash of green.
âUgh, fuck, Steve... it feels so good when you suck it with your beard rubbing my chest.â Clearly, Tony had a kink, and this kink would be the death of him. He needed to shut up already.
âWords, Rogers. I need you to say it.â
The final member at the table sat beside Winter and had the odd stage name of Captain America. It was a name that only a man like him could pull off.  The man carried a presence that captivated the attention of everyone around him. He had an inane talent for inspiring people with the words he wrote as the main lyricist of the band. As the lead guitarist of the band he was probably the most popular (but honestly that could just be Tonyâs bias speaking). Cap-as fans often called him-was the man of Tonyâs dreams. Tony could tell from the songs that he wrote, that Cap was an earnest person, who laid his heart on his sleeve and was just so very good to the core. Tony hadnât met many good people like that in his life and couldnât help how drawn in he felt by Cap.
Steve finally,
âStop right where you are Loki.â Steve warned him, and to his surprise he stopped.
I'm ready for the rougher stuff
âIâm sorry, but Iâve had Loki in my mind for the better half of this whole damn thing, so Iâm gonna need a little more than this guy being able to control some special hammer.â
The words caused him to flich, as the memory flashed before his eyes. God. How could he have let down the man that had always meant so much to him.
His hands fisted at Steveâs pecs, leveraging himself while he rode Steve. Steve started pushing up everytime Tony pushed down, and they rapidly built up a speed.
The first course of action had to be to talk things over with Tony. Sure, they had put their differences aside over these past 5 years, but the past still lingered behind them, bitter and desolate.
âSo what was it that you wanted to see me for hm? You got any plans for us tonight?â He gave Tony a sly smile. âIâve been dying for some time alone to be honest. Just. Us.â Steve spoke, emphasising the last two words with a heavy intent in his voice while sliding his hands from Tonyâs waist to the curve of his ass.
. . .
He let Clint and Nat have their moment, he could imagine the relief that Clint was feeling upon seeing Nat alive and well again. He looked over to Strange standing just past them and gave him a nod in thanks.
God, he couldn't even stomach the thought of it being true.
to just move on. Only they didnât move on, not really.
This was it. This was what Steve was waiting for. Tony had such an unexpected voice, but it was a voice that was so unique and mesmerizing that you couldnât help but get lost in it. But most importantly he had a voice that Steve knew he could work with. He was already imagining writing lyrics for that voice to bring to life on their stage.
Nat turned to look at him, and he immediately brought her in for a hug.
"Step back, Steve. Your crowding him."
â About that..., Steve Iââ
âWhat?â He felt the blood rushing in his ears. âWhat do you mean since the beginning?
Steve sighed in relief, it was a long shot when the thought had initially occurred to him: he didnât actually know if it was possible to bring them back. But if Bruce thought that it was then that opened a realm of possibilities.  "Well, since we can't change the past, why can't we just bring them here to our present?"
âWe want to avoid messing up the timelines. Interacting with past Steve will be a greater divergence then popping in and out for a brief moment in the past." Bruce answered, in a manner that depicted a man whom had become used to repeating himself. He was setting up the time portal, going over any last minute calculations.
"But Steve, you know that anything we do to the past won't change our future. It'll just create an alternate timeline where they never died."
Now here they were six months later, with Steve hanging out at Tony's more often than not. Steve hadn't been asked to draw anything specific for Tony for quite a while, but Steve had found a muse regardless. Namely various anatomical features of the aforementioned man.
For as long as he could remember, Tonyâs life had always involved Captain America, small in some ways and big in others. As a child, it was easy to latch on to the Captain. He was a popular hero, and all the children had been in awe of him.
âI love you.â
â...â
Just before approaching the mike, Tonyâs posture changed and exhibited a confidence to his stride. Steve raised a brow-the change further piquing Steveâs interest.  As he walked the last couple of steps to the mike, Steve decided to get the ball rolling and immediately stated,
Steve was bored. His day had started out well enough, what with his morning routine of an early jog and some quality time at his favourite cafe getting a couple of sketches completed. But it had all gone down hill when he had sat down at a long table with his fellow band members to listen to a series of dull and unoriginal auditions. The auditions themselves werenât bad per se, just lacking that unique flavour of sound that he was looking for.
Decided to add another chapter cause I felt guilty. But it's so shit I feel even worse for posting it. I'm having such trouble with tenses. Sigh.
"I'm not following."
It wasnât until Steveâs 23rd birthday that he actually realized what had been going on.
Howard wasnât one to get excited easily, so whatever had caught his attention was going to be something to take note of.
âHow did you even get all thisâ¦?â Steve trailed off, he let Tonyâs previous answer slide and resumed perusing the items throughout the room.
Steve kissed him then, âShh, baby, Iâm sorry. I got it. I got what you need.â
One of his hands gripped Steveâs cock, while the other made quick work of his pants, pushing them down once he had them opened. He grabbed the lube that he had gotten earlier, and hastily got his fingers slicked, reaching around to open himself up.
So he was quite shocked when Steve pulled him to his chest and wrapped his arms back around him.
After Steve- Future Steve? Well, after he calmed down he had then ironically sat down and proceeded to explain to Tony and the rest of the team their supposed future.
Now, sitting so that Tony was straddling him once again, Steve grabbed both of Tonyâs cheeks, spreading them so that Tony had greater access to his opening.
It was hard. Seeing Nat there, Bruce had to look away. Clint just stared, stone faced. Steve could feel the burn of his eyes, and turned to look at Strange. Strange looked back, a flash of understanding appeared across his face.
âTony?â Steve had said, after a full on minute had gone by.
Glaring at Steve, he marched angrily towards him.
He could feel Tony swallow from the movement he felt through his fingertips, and he prepared himself for what it could be that had Tony so nervous.
He was looking at Tony then. All sad puppy dog eyes, and long slicked back blond hair with that rugged fucking caveman beard. God, he needed this man fucking inside of him, like yesterday.
After Nat had left with Tony, Strange had stayed behind to enforce the illusion that Tony was still there. Steve was just glad that he had left right after Tony, god knows he'd seen enough of his loved ones dead; he didn't need to see their replicas too.
âNow I have you hot and wet for me, ready for the taking.â Tony cocked a smirk towards Steve, and all Steve could do was look back wrecked, and in awe.
"Fuck your code." Bruce clenched his fists as he spoke. "Natasha and Tony sacrificed their lives for us, if there's a chance that they can be saved, we owe it to them to try." Echoing the words Steve had said earlier.
"Fury, I see that your still making sure that eye of yours sees everything. Oh and speaking of, how's Goose?"
It wasnât so bad after that. Apparently Tony needed a figure portrait for some sort of charity auction at a client party. It had sounded absurd, but then Steve wasnât being paid to judge, so he had simply accepted the reasoning and asked Tony to lay in a more modest position before beginning to paint.
Gone.
At the end of the applause, Steve carefully spoke. âThank you for the performance Tony, weâll get in touch with you when we come to a decision.â
â Let Steve know Iâd like to see him once heâs done Jarv.â
Tony felt himself wince. He'd been avoiding Pepper due to that reason for a while now. He knew that she had been trying to get him to engage in some 'healthy human relations" that didn't just consist of old men more than twice his age, that he had to meet with in order to appease Obie and the board. He had to suppress another wince at the thought. It was difficult to build relationships with people his general age. He was underage for one thing, and smarter than everyone else for the other. It didn't help matters that almost everyone knew who he was, so deciphering if people wanted to friend him for his fame, wealth, and intellect or were actually genuine was always an ordeal. He just thanked the stars that he had Rhodey and Pepper-who despite being his PA, cared just as much about him as Rhodey.
But Tony replied as if Steve had.
"I'm not saying anything definitive but it could be a prospect, yes. But you would need both the time and reality stone for it to even remotely have a chance of working. Reversing time on small objects is a lot simpler than reversing death, the reality stone would be needed as a stabilizing agent..." He broke off then, seemed to realize - probably at the huge smile on Bruce's face - that he had pretty much confirmed he would be willing to give it a try.
Oh man I've seen so much traffic
The rest of his band mates were clapping in evident enjoyment, and Clint even let out a âDamn, dude!â, so he was confident that his team was on the same page as him. However, they did have to come together and discuss specifics before he could proceed or say anything to Tony.
It isn't until after he's returned the infinity stones and is back to the present that Steve finally has the chance to deal with everything that has happened.
"Well only the sceptre really, your Loki actually did escape with the Tesseract. So Tony and I-" And damn if the way Future Steve said his name didn't speak to level of closeness they had clearly managed to achieve. "-had to go back to the 1970s to get the Tesseract there."
That's the love I want, I want love
Natasha had then stepped up, walked past them and up to Loki. âWhat do you mean youâre from the future.â
But heâd been so focused on his drawings and the man behind them that heâd miss the fact that when they stopped to eat, it was Tony who ordered and paid for the take out, or that when he offered to whip up a quick meal, it was Tony who had bought and stocked the ingredients beforehand.
"Ok. Fine. I'll go. If for no other reason than to get you two off my back for a while."  If pepper was involved the easiest thing for him was to just agree and get it all over with.
Steve, however, wasnât phased by the crying at all. He simply pulled him back into his arms and let Tony cry it out. Tony guessed that said something about how well Steve knew him. He knew that they still had a lot left to discuss, but he figured that they were headed in the right direction now, so he simply enjoyed being held by Steve.
Toughening up around my heart
"Look, there isn't much I can do to help you out here. I've already given you the Sceptre. and you now know about the other infinity stones a lot sooner than we did. Maybe this time around you should all listen to Tony when he says we need to prepare for the threat up there and you might just win without any losses this time around."  Future Steve spoke with a set jaw and a fiercely protective look that made Tony swallow around something strange.
"These infinity stones, that's why you came here for the Tesseract and Sceptre." Nat stated, while shooting Future Steve a look for confirmation.
The date itself goes pretty well. Pretty amazing actually. Steve is the perfect gentleman of course. When they get there, they already have a table reserved away from prying eyes. Not that anyone pays them much attention. Steve tells him they are pretty used to him now, so he doesnât usually get too much attention here anymore. They know when to leave him alone. Itâs one of the reasons he brought him here, and Tony canât help the warm feeling he gets in his stomach at Steveâs thoughtfulness as well as the tiny bit of relief that he wonât have to continuously put on a show.
He tried to push back the feeling of nausea that had slowly creeped up.
He pushed back the voice in his head saying that a one time fuck would never get it out of his system. Sex with Steve always made him crave more. He told himself this time it would.
â Will do, sir.â
To create an AI peacekeeping program on a global scale required a powerful energy source and extensive amount of coding, capable of handling such high scale information processing. The intelligence matrices had to be as complex as the neurons of a brain. The program required state of the art artificial intelligence and Tony was determined to find a way to create it. Needless to say Tony still had a lot to work on.
âSo, why did you go through all the effort of tracking down all these things? I mean, I know you said that you were a fan but...â Steve trailed off, as if hoping Tony would fill in the rest.
Some of the strands from Steveâs slicked back hair fell in his face, and Tony reached out, sliding them back into place. Steve watched him as did so, and Tony looked at him for a beat before turning his head to the side. He couldnât handle the look Steve was giving him.
âHold that thought Tony. We got work to do.â
The words seemed to bring Stark out if his slight stupor and back into the conversation.
Damn Rhodey. Having a best friend who knew you well enough to call you out on your bullshit was another thing Tony noted, that sucked. But he did secretly love that someone knew him so well.
âSir, Master Rogers has been notified and is currently on his way.â
âHmm, this is nice. We should have a night in today.â Steve softly spoke as he hugged Tony close.
Clearly he needed to get his head checked, cause there was no way that Steven Rogers, Captain America himself, was asking him out on a-
âAnd that right there is why Point Br-â Tony was saying, while pointing at the screen to some long blonde muscled man, before Steve blurted out, âAre you my Sugar Daddy?â
switch-hitter32: get laid yet, cap?
âI didnât break you, did I?â Tony asked, leaning closer. Steve wanted to tell him he was a little too close, but he couldn't bring himself to open his mouth and say the words. Tonyâs face was open, more open that Steve was used to seeing. His brown eyes were studying Steveâs face intensely. âHey, I got a car coming, so get it together. You look like you need some sleep. Do I need to actually parent your Internet hours?â
âI just wanted to see you,â Steve replied, giving DUM-E a light pet on his sensor before focusing his attention on Tony.
Which was horrible, because he wasnât ashamed of Tony or anything. He just didnât want this part of his life broadcast toward the world. And he swore if switch-hitter32 called him a coward one more time, he was going to...well, do nothing, since he didnât really know the guy beyond that stupid name that he didnât even understand.
âHey, sweetie, calm down, breathe,â a high, but soothing voice told him. Steve looked up, meeting warm, concerned brown eyes. He immediately recognized his waiter and started fumbling for his wallet, apologizing as he goes. âOh, hun, you are either new to the land of gay or you had no idea you were in this side of town, huh?â
âI just wanted to let you know, as a friend,â Tony said slowly, rinsing off the last plate and resting a damp hand on Steveâs shoulder. Steve fought to focus on Tonyâs face instead of the heat filtering through the cotton of his shirt. âItâs okay if youâre gay.â
It was quick and Steve could really only feel a tingle against his lips than actual touch, but it was perfect. He was afraid to open his eyes as he pulled away, but when he did he saw Tony staring at him. Tonyâs eyes had always been captivating in how they showed his every emotion and right then they were large and showing something soft and caring.
switch-hitter32: awwwwwww, come on, donât leave us hanging! right, guys?
So Steve, noting this usually happened around the same time of the day, starting ensuring the coffee pot was full and Tonyâs favorite pastry was sitting right next to it, ready and primed for him. Tony adapted to this little treat pretty easily and never said thank you, but Steve didnât mind. It saved him the headache of watching the man freak out every morning.
âYou canât tell me what I feel,â Steve pointed out, wondering why he was indulging in Tony right then. Everyone knew that Tony got a little ornery when he was tired and stressed.
Other times, Steve would be minding his own business, only to have Tony sweep through the room in a stressful rush, dressed to impress in one of his power-suits and holding his phone to his ear. The man would be talking a mile a minute, hand waving around, and just looking in need of a hug or a muscle relaxer, something to get him to sit down.
He kept one hand in Tonyâs hair, at one point tugging his head back to expose his neck. Steve never thought the idea of just marking someone would actually be enjoyable. It had seemed like something a caveman would do. But he actually had to grab Tonyâs hip with his other hand to pin him in place when Tony let out a whine sound and arched up with quite a bit of force when Steve bit down on the curve of his neck.
âHuh?â Bruce replied, looking confused himself. âYou and Tony. Arenât you two together?â
Steve felt utterly numb by the time he is sitting in a small office, a glass of ice water with a couple of mint leaves sitting before him. He looked up at the man who had helped him, noting that he was giving Steve a suspicious look that should feel familiar, but Steve was just too tired to worry about it. âIâm sorry, I can pay. I just need to get my wallet to me.â
âYou saw the footage of what I looked like,â Steve said nervously.
âI know that, too,â Tony replied with a soft smile, which made Steve feel warm all over.
The actual truth of it didnât hit hard until the next afternoon. Steve was in the kitchen, making a grilled cheese sandwich with the full intent of trying to get Tony to eat something, when the man in question stumbled into the room looking like one of those zombies in the horror films Natasha liked to watch with all the lights off. There the man was, bed head framing his face and actual engine grease streaked across one cheek, stumbling over to the coffee maker with an intent only known to the desperate.
At this point, Steve had no instruction to go on. So he went with his gut. He didnât respond, knowing he'd make a fool of himself if he did. He pressed a kiss to Tonyâs lips, which were already swollen. He couldnât help bringing his hand up and first gently holding his jaw, quickly then sliding his hand to cup Tonyâs head. He let himself fully press down onto Tony, finally letting Tony take his weight. Then he thrusted.
âYouâre a little...snot,â Steve told him.
Steve knew he was often confused about things, it wasnât something he could actually help. SHIELD was probably the worst help in the world when it came to getting a guy used to a whole new century. Fury had tossed him a report on the key events of the last few decades and left Steve to try to decipher why tearing down a wall had anything to do with a man named Hasselhoff. Natasha had said that Fury had put that in there as a joke, but Steve thought it was a little cruel to put jokes in an information packet provided to a man who knew absolutely nothing about everything around him.
Captain-40s: That is none of your business.
Tony shot him a big smile, the kind that lit up a room and no one could tell Steve otherwise. âYeah, I got a minute or even more for you.â
âHey,â Tony mumbled, veering off for the kitchen.
He needed to turn the thing off permanently. It was like every time he was on the website switch-hitter32 was. It wasnât a pleasant experience, but the mommaâs boy in Steve dictated he be polite and at least answer.
âI didnât know it could feel like that,â Steve admitted, his hand now gently caressing Tonyâs side.
âIâm not,â Steve said, immediately getting defensive.
Then, it was straight to his computer. He had learned to not just type things into the search engine and trust what was provided for him. Besides, he figured typing âmy boyfriend likes to be manhandled, how do I get him to let me do it in other ways?â would not get good results. Especially since Steve wasnât sure if he was ready to see that stuff showing the actual act. Again.
Steve could have said no, but his vibrant blush would have given him away anyway, so he figured he might as well stay silent. Steve decided it was best to ignore the man and reached out for the phone, before he hesitated. âUmm, I donât know Tonyâs number off the top of my head.â
âOh yeah?â Tony replied, his smile getting smaller, but not less bright. More like he was now waiting for something unknown. Steve was fully aware of how Tony didnât like surprises.
Steve stared at him and reached down, sliding his hand along Tonyâs hip and long his thigh. He gripped Tonyâs right thigh and tugged him down further on the couch, enjoying the hitched sound to Tonyâs breathing. Tony immediately slid his legs along Steveâs hips, curling into a hold. Steve had to admit, heâd never seen Tonyâs face like that before, face flushed and hair wild even though Steve had yet to run his fingers through their strands.
switch-hitter32: okay, cap, hereâs what we want you to doâ¦
He stayed in his room for the rest of the day, avoiding looking online to help him with what he planned to do. The guys told him to go with what he wanted. But after telling them heâd never experienced it, they gave him tips. So, he felt at the very least that he was prepared to try it. Naturally he went to dinner, because Tony would make an appearance and Steve didnât really want him to notice him hiding away like an idiot.
âItâs okay,â Tony whispered. He leaned in and kissed Steve again, only this time it was soft and almost delicate. âItâs getting late, and you always get up so early.â
Steve lowered himself and kissed Tony, whose whole body almost seemed to tremble. Steve could feel Tony grab his shoulders, nails digging in. They were just kissing, Steve pressing down onto him, but Tony made it sound like it was wonderful. Tonyâs hand slid up, fingers sliding through his hair. When Steve realized Tony was enjoying himself, he reached down, his other hand keeping him from actually squashing Tony, and grabbed Tonyâs thigh and pulled it closer to him.
Well, he still looked around every corner because no matter where he went, Tony was always there, making Steve feel...strange. And the man had no idea he was doing it.
Steve blushed and with a smile tugged Tony into a kiss. âMy favorite, too.â
To be honest he was kind of hoping no one would notice.
Eventually, Bruce brought it upon himself to comment on Steveâs actions, in what was probably the rudest way possible. âIâm glad the two of you found each other.â
After around thirty minutes Tony set down his tool and looked over with a bright smile. âWhatâs got you in here, Cap?â
Suddenly Tonyâs hips rocked up without any sense of rhythm. And Steve watched as Tonyâs eyelashes just fluttered, the man biting down on his lip.
They were three dates and exactly five and a half kisses - Steve accidentally hit Tonyâs nose that one time, it was his fault for trying to kiss him while he was talking science - into their relationship. Steve felt his stomach do a weird drop, shudder sensation, because he was still a nervous wreck about the entire thing. He had managed to start calling himself gay in his head, the gay online forum, and even Tony! But he hadnât spoken a word to anyone else.
âWhat?â Steve asked, confused.
Sighing, Steve moved over to his bookmarks and away from the Cosmo article he had stumbled onto about how to please his man. It wasnât helpful. In fact, Steve was pretty sure Tony would break up with him if he tried half the things in that list. The other half was simply unsanitary. He was back on the forum he had become attached to before he even had the conscious thought to be so, but then it was at least likely to give more realistic advice than Comso was going to.
The Internet had cooed over the image for weeks. Steve still wasnât sure if he forgave Tony for that one.
âIâve noticed youâve been spending a lot of time on the Internet lately,â Tony said, âand, uh, Bruce came to me the other day thinking he upset you. Now, Iâm not saying I peeked at your browser history to make sure you werenât having a big WASP-like homophobic freak out on me, but, well... I kind of peeked at your browser history.â
Steve stared at the instructions given to him and bit his lip, partly in confusion and partly in arousal. Because, okay, that was something heâd always be willing to do with Tony. Did Tony want it, though? When he mentioned that fact, all three forum members reminded him that stopping is always an option, with a heavy emphasis on consent.
switch-hitter32: LOL, yes! letâs go with 90 on the safe side, guys. be easy on the old man.
âNo,â Steve replied.
âMy...what?â Steve asked, trying to figure out what Tony was talking about, though he could figure out it was about Bruce thinking Steve was gay from the context clues. Which Steve still didnât think was true, no matter what username switch-hitter32 kept saying.
âShit, babe,â Tony rushed out, reaching up to drag Steve down into a deep kiss, more tongue than they had ever used before. But with the way Tonyâs legs started tightening their hold around his hips and pulling him closer, Steve couldnât bring himself to complain. They gave no room for Steve to do more than grind himself downward, but it was enough to feel fireworks up his spine.
Tony looked conflicted for a moment, before he smiled. âI need coffee, but I promise to be back. Whatever you want to watch, Capsicle.â
âYeah, he told me,â Tony said, giving a half-smile. âThat canât be whatâs caused all this.â
Eventually, Steve pulled away. âSo, uh, are you working on anything immediate?â
âBut youâre not gay? Cause thatâs the part thatâs keeping me from properly reacting to this,â Tony said, shaking his head. âIâm not going to send you into a huge spiral of self-hatred just because you might have a few feelings. So, what do you want to do? Itâs your life, but I have to say that claiming to be one thing and then spending all your time surrounding yourself with that very thing is a little bizarre. Itâs like youâre punishing yourself.â
He realized pretty quickly that he forgot, once again, to turn the chat function off.
âWhat?â Tony asked, before letting out an actual squeak as he had to grab a tight hold onto Steveâs shoulders as Steve gathered him up and walked toward the couch on the far wall. âOkay, wow. You took my manhandling comment seriously and...not gonna argue with the results. I mean, this is very--oof.â
âSo, what, people who like the man-love arenât American or canât be soldiers?â Tony asked. He looked away from a moment, frowning. âI thought you appreciated my abilities in battle. And who here used to walk around basking in the glow of weapon making or practically represents the utter definition of capitalism? So, what, because I like men I canât do those things well?â
âThatâs what you took away from that?â Tony asked, looking flustered. For a moment, Steve thought Tony was going to fly off in a huff and leave him there in the process, but the man just let out a long sigh and disengaged his suit. He stepped out, hitting a button to cause it to collapse into its little suitcase. Outside of it, Tony always looked small. Not tiny or anything, just smaller than Steve. Like Steve needed to protect him, even though Tony would probably punch him for saying it. âOkay, Mitchel, get me some pie. Steve, I need you to tell me what is going on in that ridiculously sculpted head of yours.â
âOkay, you are about to freak out the locals with your panicking,â the waiter said, grabbing his arm and attempting to lift him up. Steve, of course, doesnât budge. âOh, my, you are sturdy. Now, come with me, Iâll get you a glass of water. Up, up.â
Tony let out a low rumbling sound, hips jerking up, trying to match Steveâs steady movement. The man was a ball of energy on his best days and finally Steve had to chuckle. âYou trying to buck me off?â
âWant to watch a movie?â Steve asked, hoping to actually keep him in the room for a bit, instead of letting him go back to his workshop to drown in whatever project he was working on. Steve sent him a sad look. âIâm kind of lonely.â
âRight,â Steve breathed out. He dived back into the kiss and let the instruction he had been given fill his head. His hands slid down, to Tonyâs hips and then sliding just under his thighs. Tony let out a soft sound, before it turned into a full blown groan as Steve lifted him up and turned, resting Tony on just the edge of the work table.
Captain-40s: Weâve kissed six and a half times.
Tony, he had found out, was a major cuddle bug. Once he was given permission to touch, he went all out. Not that he over stepped boundaries, but he now had no problem pressing into Steveâs side, throwing his legs over Steveâs lap and resting his head on Steve's shoulder. It was there he just seemed small - something Steve would never say out loud - and it was adorable. âI love this movie.â
âTony,â Steve said, exasperated. He walked back over to the kitchen and grabbed a napkin, wetting it briefly from the sink. He made his way back over and, while Tony was watching him with wide brown eyes, he leaned in and began to clean off the grease. âHow do you get this stuff everywhere?â
So that left the Internet. It was probably one of his better ideas, as well as one of his worst.
Tony narrowed his eyes. âI saw the porn site buddy. And not to be all parental controls on you, but you should be careful. I donât want you giving that poor computer a virus looking at stuff like that.â
âDonât be absurd,â Steve huffed.
âGood night?â Clint asked, leaning over the counter to watch Steve make his breakfast. âAwful lot of eggs.â
He did his best to ignore the actual sexual part of the scene, though the thrusting was somewhat hypnotic and he couldnât understand how any of that could be pleasurable, but the smaller brunette in the video seemed to be having the time of his life. And he kind of looked like Tony.
Slowly, but surely, everyone developed their own level of residence in the Avengers Tower. They liked to joke that Steve was the first actual resident, but that was due to him actually getting mail. He argued that a Discover credit card offer didnât count and Bruce had been navigating the labs for three months before Steve fell asleep on the couch that first time. He had woken up four hours later - his standard - to find himself covered in an Iron Man throw blanket and an Iron Man plushie in his arms.
black-sabbathrules: Not at all, sass. Not. At. All.
Mitchel turned out to be the man helping Steve and the guy wasn't worried at all by Tonyâs narrow-eyed expression. In fact, he was practically swooning when Tony stomped his way into the cafÃ©. âOh, this is so beautiful, you came to rescue him so fast, and he wasnât even in any danger. He didnât even finish his pie!â
So Steve, sighing affectionately, would scoop the smaller man up in his arms and let Jarvis control the elevator, so he could carry Tony to his own bed. Heâd take off the manâs shoes and tuck him in. Heâd even make sure there was a glass of water and aspirin next to him for the morning, because he knew Tony had either been bent over a computer or drinking and would end up with a headache either way.
Captain-40s: Thatâs grotesque.
Steve might have dropped Tony onto the couch a little too hard, but knew heâd be making up for it. He crawled onto the couch, hovering on his hands and knees above Tony. âYou okay?â
Eventually, he knew something was going to happen to ruin it all. Naturally, it had to be Tony.
It made Steve realize how much he needed Tony around. His online companions eventually grew tired of him ignoring what was right in his face and laid down the facts, only presenting it in a way that made him realize how stupid he was being. Halfway through explaining to switch-hitter32 on how his sister was clearly in love with her best friend, Steve sat back with what could only be the biggest realization of his life.
Steve walked away from that conversation even more confused than he was when this all started. And naturally, in true Tony fashion, the man thought it would be a good idea to help Steve out. Everywhere Steve went, he kept finding pamphlets about how it was okay to be gay. Random books about historical figures from Steveâs time who turned out to be gay kept popping up on his bookshelf and, oddly, in the bathroom.
Steve pulled back, not shocked that his breathing was a shallow pant. âWait.â
âI have a phone in the back,â the man replied, guiding Steve along.
Captain-40s: There is nothing to share. Besides, this is hardly appropriate for a conversation.
âI just need to call my friend. Tony can pay for me.â
Steve chuckled. âItâs fine.â
Thank God, in all His mercy, for Tony Stark.
âA grilled cheese,â Steve replied, unable to stop himself from reaching out and guiding the half-asleep man to a dining room chair. Tony slumped down, letting Steve set his coffee cup safely to the side. âWhat have you been doing down there? You look like crap.â
âYeah, can I finish my pie?â Steve asked. âOh, and did you bring my wallet?â
Steve wasnât sure what that meant, which meant he then began to obsess over it. First, he didnât actually remember all the manhandling he had been doing. Apparently it was a lot. Heâd shift Tony to where he wanted him, lift him if he needed to be into that space. He could even remember the times he had done it before they got together. One of the ways he had subconsciously told Tony he liked him had been picking the man up and carrying him to bed.
âThat was an accident.â
âHush, Iâve seen your interviews,â he replied. âThe way you look at each other is so sweet.â
Steve stared at him.
âDo you realize how long Iâve waited for you to do that?â Tony whispered.
âOh, you love me,â Tony said with a grin, tilting his head back to look up at him.
Because he wasnât an idiot, he was just scared.
Tony gave a small laugh, before frowning. âOh, youâre serious. Okay, fine, do whatever it is youâre doing. But you know Iâm here for you, right? Itâs okay to be gay and all that crap. Iâll even make you a rainbow shield for Gay Pride, if you want.â
Steve grinned and reached for the remote. He set up The Iron Giant, knowing it was one of Tonyâs secret favorite movies. The fond look on Tonyâs face as he returned told Steve he had made the right choice. Steve was pretty sure he was getting good at this whole dating thing, despite having no prior experience. No girl wanted a scrawny, sick every other week kind of man back before the serum and now...well, he was still kind of confused about how this all happened, but he was definitely happy.
âThatâs as good as I can get it without soap,â Steve said, tossing the napkin in the trash and looking back down at Tony. Then, not even thinking about it, he leaned in and kissed him.
The corner of Tonyâs mouth twitched up, but he didnât say anything.
If he occasionally glanced back at that one particular porn site with the brunette it wasnât a big deal, it wasnât like he was dirtying himself over it. According to the forum, curiosity was normal and didnât have to mean anything.
So Steve started taking more showers, to keep his sweat and work-out smell from bothering Tony so much.
The clear doors on the workshop allowed him in without him asking. Tony was soldering something on a disconnected foot of his Iron Man suit, which made Steve know to not startle him. Instead he sat off to the side and spoke softly to DUM-E, knowing the noise alone would let Tony know he was there without making Tonyâs hold on the small, but still dangerous tool in his hand harmful.
A small piece of bagel hit his temple, dead on, and he turned to frown at Natasha. She grinned and gave him a shrug. âSorry, you looked like you were stuck in a reboot. You are flesh and blood, right? Tony didnât create his own Steve?â
Steve nodded to himself. He could initiate an actual interaction with Tony. He could do that. He should probably get a good nightâs rest and solid breakfast first, though, because this was going to take some focus.
Steve stood up, biting his lip as he walked closer. âIâll make it quick if you want me to.â
âSteve,â a soft voice said. Fingers slid through his hair and the legs around him squeezed like they were hugging him.
And that was how Steve Rogers found himself registered on an online group dedicated to young men who were questioning their sexuality and afraid of what those around them would say. It was oddly liberating. No one on there knew he was Captain America, and it was almost like he was actually making friends.
Tony just grinned, grabbed his collar and pulled him into another kiss. It was deep and Steve almost couldnât handle the intensity of it as Tonyâs tongue entered his mouth. Tony pulled away, nipping him lightly on the lower lip, causing Steve to let out a weird grunt-groan sound. âI had to let you get your head on right, popsicle, and make sure you really wanted this.â
âYou are very cute, too cute to be wandering around here like a lost puppy,â the man said with a tsk. He tilted his head at Steve. âYou know if I didnât know any better, Iâd say you look like Captain America. Boy, would that be crazy, Captain America in my little gay cafÃ©, surrounded by rainbows!â
Tony reached up and pressed his hand on Steveâs chest, ignoring Steveâs quick intake of air as he slid it down and grabbed ahold of the hem of the shirt into a fist. âYeah, Iâd say Iâm very, very good.â
Tony chuckled, then hummed like he was content. âOnly in the best way.â
âYes,â Tony replied in a voice almost breathless. âPlease, continue.â
Steve looked up at the man, knowing his breathing was even worse than before with his even newer realization, âI donât have my wallet.â
âI know youâre not ready for much,â Tony said in an odd, almost breathless kind of voice, âbut when you are, yes. Totally into all the manhandling youâve been doing.â
Tony glared at him, before clanking his way over and stealing Steveâs fork. âYou and I are having a long talk when we get back to the Tower. First youâre looking up gay porn, but youâre not gay. Then youâre joining gay support groups online, but still not gay. Hell, Steve, you carry me to bed and take a shower every time you see me, but oh, no, not gay!â Tony paused to take a bite of the pie. âWow, this is good. So, now what? Is this going to be your new hang out? Is not gay you going to get a not gay boyfriend?â
âI donât take a shower every time I see you,â Steve protested.
rg-sassbitch: seriously, you got a piece. Share!
âI know,â Steve said softly, wrapping an arm around Tony and just enjoying the feel of him.
âYou were going to say shit,â Tony commented, finishing off the sandwich with a ridiculously large bite. He grinned up at Steve. âYou donât love me, and you were going to call me a shit.â
And that sent Steve over. His first orgam in decades. He could feel his teeth biting down on flesh, a whimper leaving him, before he slumped down on top of Tony. Hoping he wasnât squishing the man, because he was barely even able to see shapes, just white happy spots. There was no way he could move.
Asking Tony seemed like a good idea until he realized the whole problem started because Bruce was under the impression that Steve thought that way about Tony and something in Steve was utterly terrified of Tony finding out about that.
âSteve?â Tony asked, face already blushing just from Steve walking up between his legs.
Steve had seen nudity before, of course. He did go to war and had rolled his eyes as naked images of women were passed around his troops. He never saw the appeal in them and had endured Buckyâs teasing as a result, but he did take a second to actually look. So he wasnât utterly clueless.
âYeah, I do,â Steve said softly, not even caring that he basically gave himself away. âEat your sandwich.â
rg-sassbitch: oh dear god in heaven, yeah, I canât help this poor little soul at all. sweetie, you need to pin that boy down and go to town, but...damn, he doesnât know what that means, does he?
âHey, so, Iâm making new spider bites for Nat, I was kind of hoping you could help me test them? In a totally, not abusing your boyfriend kind of way,â Tony said. He paused. âExcept I would be throwing them at you. Theyâd knock Clint out for an hour, or Iâd use him.â
Tony's POV
"We got the first stone after Thor watched Loki die, the second one after Sarah died, we need to see the person die before the stone is visible". Steve gulped "Natasha...do you...?". She just walked away.
I quickly jumped to my feet and ran over to the fight. "Thor it's not on there, where else would it be?". Thanos picked up Loki in his fist and got a tight grip around his neck. A moment of clarity came across his face "It's in Loki's dagger!". I looked at the waist band of the god struggling to breathe and seen the blue glow of the infinity stone.
I whispered dirty thoughts into his ear, and when I pulled away his whole face was pink "T-tony..." I rolled my hips "Yes Captian" "you are so damn hot". He placed his lips over mine and began to pull off my t-shirt, then his. We had a little roll so I landed on my back and he hovered on top of me kissing my face and neck. At some stage I lost my pants and it was just me and him. He looked into my eyes "Tony you are so beautiful, and smart and...I love you". He went back to kissing my chest.
She smiled "Sorry for disturbing you...I just brought you a sandwich, I was hoping we could talk". I pushed all my bits and bobs to the side "What's up". She sat across from me and slid the sandwich across the table.
â¢After the meetingâ¢
"Sharon, can we talk?" She smiled "Of course, just give me one minute, talk to Bucky and I'll find you when I get back from the lady's room". She kissed my cheek before running off. I turned to Bucky "What's going on Buck?" his laugh brought back memories "I see you have a girlfriend" I just shrugged "Apparently I do, I think there's just a misunderstanding somewhere" "Well I don't think it matters she's very fine, just go with it". I looked down "she's not for me, but if you want I can set you two up?". Something about the way he looked at me told me he knew "Nah I'm not looking to date right now". I threw my arm around him "If you ever decide to start, get a haircut first".
"There you are boys" Natasha appeared "We're waiting for you two, Bruce you didn't do a great job at finding Cap, he's already up there". Bruce laughed "Tony is just such a handful!". We started walking behind her "Speaking of Tony being a handful, did you and Steve work things out?" my breath hitched and she noticed "Eh yeah, we're getting there".
It was not re assuring one bit "Tony are you stalling? Are you waiting for us to break up so you won't have to deal with the media?, Do you see a future with me?". He turned around and stared blankly at me, I sat up on the bed "Tony I need to know that we are going somewhere, I can't be in a dead end relationship, do you see a future with me".
Eventually the music changed tone, it was slow, Tony wrapped his arm around my waist and took my hand, his head rested on my shoulders and we swayed. It was the most peaceful moment I had had in a really long time, I closed my eyes to take it in.
She brought me over to the table and opened up a leather bond Stark Industries book.Â  I scanned over the pages, they were plans to sell high tech weapons to countries in middle east. Tony's signatures were all over the documents. My heart was pounding extremely hard.
Steve's POV
The cold air hit my face, he pulled down my tie slowly. We were on a rooftop, but there were fairy lights and roses, a comfy sofa, and a hot tub. "What is this Tony?" He smiled "It's my secret little relax area, no else knows about it, except for Peter, I set him up for his date here". I walked over to the edge, of the roof, you could see the lights from the city but not the noise "what are we doing up here".
I took out the reference book and then my cheque book. I strutted down to the end of the table and put three cheques on the table, "That's for your share", I slip the cheque to the woman "that's for yours" to the man "and this is for yours" I leaned over and placed the cheque into the older mans pocket, the one who had called me a faggot.
I left the two of them alone and started to make some food for the drive. Tony came down a little while later in a suit "That kid will be the cause of my death someday" I smirked "You love him", he rolled his eyes "I hope one of those sandwiches has tuna on it". I packed the food into the bag "I guess we'll have to wait and find out". I pecked his lips and headed for the door.
I had been battling the thought of Tony for a while, the truth is as soon as people started to disappear I thought of him. I couldn't stop wondering had I missed my last chance to make up with him. The ship was no guarantee that it was Tony, Bruce had told the team Tony ended up on one of the ring ships with some wizard and Peter. My heart was sinking further and further into my stomach as I walked towards the Wakanda castle.
"Just making sure Tony was awake", Tony discarded him "Kid, it's a wedding, wear a suit" he laughed "Well I knew that! But do I wear it tonight or tomorrow?" Tony rolled his eyes, but I knew he was only acting like he was annoyed, he really loved helping Peter "You wear one suit tonight, without a tie or waistcoat, then tomorrow you wear a three-piece suit, with a tie" "I thought as much, but you see, I only own the one suit, unless you count the spiderman suit, but I don't think Ms Potts would like that-" "There are like at least ten suits in your wardrobe".
We had gone spend the night in the secrete rooftop hot tub. I woke up next to Steve, he had a smug smile on his face while he was looking at my tablet. I moaned and sat up "I'm surprised you even know how to use that". I took it out of his hands and rubbed my eyes, opening up the daily news for him and handed it back, "Thank you". I snuggled up next to him and rested my hear against his chest.
More wedding shenanigans went on up until three in the morning. The whole team stuck together as we stumbled up to our rooms. "Night everyone!" Tony yelled when we got to our door. He was quite drunk.
A V E N G E R S F A C I L I T Y
Steve's POV
Wanda was wearing a red strapless beaded dress, the heavy material stopped at the top of her tight, but it was lace from her waist to the floor. Vision, in his human skin, had his arms around her waist, he was wearing a black suit and red tie.
We strolled through the first trail, it was calm, the only sound was the birds and our footsteps on the concrete path. Steve stopped once we got to a beautiful clearing, there was an arch of flowers he mumbled: "they do weddings out here sometimes". I strolled underneath the arch and looked up at the sky.
I climbed onto the bed and spread his legs apart, a hand on each of his knees. He was hard again and was chewing on his lip "Come on Captian I know your not done with me yet".
Before Steve could say anything, our Natasha went up to the man "I'm sorry Papa". Bang. We had only turned around and she already had the glowing red necklace in her hand, and tears falling from her eyes. She crushed it with the but of her gun and wiped the tears away.
Steve's POV
"He's gone, Tony". Tony's face was always kind of clenched, I noticed it very early on in our friendship, I think it's because he always has some sharp snarky remark to make but once I said that the tension in his face was gone. I sat down on the floor, he swung his legs off the sofa and rested a hand on my shoulder "I'm really sorry Cap, but you know we're going to get them back, all of them, Peter, Strange, Sam, Wanda, T'Challa, that little tree guy Thor was telling me about, and Bucky". I stood up, wiping his blood off my hands and into his shirt.
I kissed Steve on the lip, got off his lap and put on my shirt, but it hung open because the buttons were scattered all over the floor. I opened the door and closed the door behind me. "What's going on Rhodey?" "Come on down to the bar".
It only took him a second to cross the room and crouch down next to me, he can take much bigger steps than me. I wasn't too phased by the bleeding but he was. He just let his hands hover over my abdomen, I smirked and took off my t-shirt. He took the bottle from my hand and poured some of it onto my balled up t-shirt before pressing it to the cut "Outch" he smimed "Sorry, I probably should have told you that it would sting" "Well you probably should have told me a lot of things...".
He went back to his chair and stretched out, Steve rubbed my shoulders "I'm going to get ready for bed, I suggest you do the same". I stood up and walked away from Peter lightly holding Steve's hand, I whispered: "I'm sorry, I couldn't just send him away". Steve kissed my forehead "I know, it doesn't matter, we have a gorgeous suite booked for tomorrow night".
He stood up and turned around "I'm going to go take a shower" I cocked my head "now?" "Eh yeah," he swiftly moved across the room and into the bathroom. "Okay then" I mumbled to myself, it was two in the morning, and we had to be awake by nine. I sighed and got into one of Steve's hoodies. I sat down on the couch with a cup of coffee. I glanced over at the table and picked up the DVD case, Steve came out of the bathroom, I turned around "Cap, where did you get this?" He turned kind of pink "oh uh Sam gave it to me..." "why?" He sighed and sat down next to me "...because... apparently the whole team thinks I need help in that area...with you".
I got over to the ship with my new shields at the ready. The door was open, I slowly walked in and took a look around, it was deserted. I got a horrible feeling in my stomach, it felt like my insides were being pulled apart. Printed on the wall, in clear white writing 'Stark Industries'.
I turned away from her and smashed the glass of water "Two fucking years, right, I'm going to kill him" "Tony-". I was gone out of the meeting room and was on my way to the lab. Pepper stood at the meeting room door, shouting down the hall "At least I had the balls to tell you who I was sleeping with!". I got into the lift and headed for the lab.
I pulled the screen away from him and placed it on the nightstand "I think we could be doing something a little more fun". I started to kiss him slowly, his arm wrapped around me and moved up and down my back. Then the door opened "Hey Tony I know you're-". Natasha was standing in the doorway holding a tablet and staring blankly at us.
"Pepper did you give birth already!?". She bit her lip and whispered, "No, Tony, I lost the baby". My jaw fell open a little "God Pep, I'm so sorry, I didn't hear, are you okay?". She sat down "Yeah, it's okay, we're moving on". I sat down and wrapped my arm around her shoulder "you'll get your chance, and when you do, James is the best guy you could have done it with". She took my hand "I am sorry, the way things turned out between us, I wish it was different". I sighed "It's okay, I should have been honest with you". She smiled "Let's not get into who was the worst, how are things between you and Steve?". I smirked and looked down at my feet "Really, really good". "I'm glad your happy Tony" she rested her hand on mine, I leaned in and pressed my lips to her cheek "You are going to make a beautiful bride".
Tony's POV
As soon as I landed in Wakanda the Kingsguard came to greet me. They brought me up to a packed meeting room. Thor was sitting talkint to a Racoon, I assume he was the missing member from Quill's team, Bruce was bugging Natasha, and Rhodes was lookinh down at his phone, but Steve wasn't there. Surrounded by all these people, and I had never felt so alone.

I sat down next to Steve at the table with a cute smile. He looked down at his lap as if I had done something stupid "Natasha told me some things". I scooted in closer to him "Good, I have more things to tell you as well". The band started playing something soft, all the couples at our table got up to dance, even Stephen, Wong, Sam and Bucky had found girls to dance with. I stood up and straightened my jacket, I stuck my hand out for Steve to take "Care to dance?".
He went back to my tights, getting me worked up, then thankfully he shoved three fingers into my mouth, I covered them in my spit as fast as I could, he blew on my hole, causing shivers to run through my body, he let a pleased sigh out and pressed two fingers past my rim "Ahhhh Steve!" I pulled up a little, away from his fingers but he moved them back up "Fuck" I couldn't process anything anymore, just the plessure of him working me open.
"He seen me getting beat up by one of those guys in the back alley, saved my ass. After that he took me boxing everyday for like six month". I laughed thinking about those days. When I looked up at Tony he was staring at me. I closed the space between us, and glaced at his lips. The tiny movement I made caused our lips to brush off each other in a sweet kiss.
I found myself trapped between Steve's massive erection and a door, I made the best choice I could and kissed him. We ended up back on the bed. He started at my neck, sucking and biting, cause me to moan "ohhh Steve" he ran his tongue around my right nipped then bit it "Fuck!" He moved to the left nipple and did the same, getting the same reaction. He carried on, marking my whole body lightly with bites and kisses. He moved a bit down the bed to in between my legs, my cock was aching for attention but he sucked at my thighs, marking them too.
I was sitting at the table in the kitchen while Sam was making breakfast. "Sam that smells great, what is it?" "Pancakes" I took a big whiff of air "Seriously they smell great". Natasha walked straight by the table "Morning boys". Sam mumbled while I froze up "Mor-morning Natasha". I face palmed when she was out of sight.
Steve's POV
I answered the knock on the door, it was Happy, he was surprised to see me, "Steve, hey, could you give this to Tony" "Come on in". He stepped into the room and placed the suit next to Tony on the bed. "So Harold, did you bring May?" He looked at Tony "Yes I did" "oh yeah, and how are things going there?" "Great, Peter isn't too happy about it though, how about you two?". Tony looked at me and smiled "Excellent, a lot better if you could get some time alone-" "I'm going to stop you there, I don't need to know any more, just get your ass dressed and then get Rhodes up" "yes sir".
I rubbed my hands down my face "None, but I have new gear for the team" "All the team?" I laughed "Yes even Steve" he jabbed his head away from me "I was talking about me but whatever, I guess your newest interest is more important." I was kind of shocked and stopped in my tracks but he kept walking "Jesus Bruce, your dick belongs in your pants, not in your personality". He turned around with a hint of anger, "And you know what Tony, Steve's dick belongs in his pants, not in your ass!" he was whispering but in a very aggressive tone.
Natasha sat me down in a circle for a game of seven minutes in heaven. I grumbled "Oh I'm sorry I forgot we were all twelve years old". Natasha was leading it "I'll go put items in the bag to represent everyone and then everyone will pull an item out of the bag".
We landed in the middle of a green field god knows where. The team got off and we waited for instructions, Thor spoke up "This is what we identify as the centre of your earth, it has unimaginable power, more than the infinity stones".
I turned around and placed my fist against the wall he was standing in front of, next to his head, trapping him "I don't need you're protection Stark" I moved away and picked up my jumped "and don't expect me to be here when you get back".
