“Rather depends on the risk they’re taking though, doesn’t it?” He began wearily. Thinking of how to explain the realities of being immortal without falling down a rabbit hole with it-
And he
“I’m stranded on an alien planet, with Tony Stark, and I’ve been dosed with a truth serum,” Steve reminded him. “Ideally, I would like to think about sex as little as possible.”
“But maybe we’ll see you at one of the second-floor parties tonight?” She asked, by way of a goodbye. “We just sort of float between them, it’s the best way to do it.”
be for each other in human terms. How much better his life might be with just some of that support, and understanding, and genuine affection for something… To recognise that part of the draw he felt to Steve, or the light-headedness he felt around him, had nothing to do with being a vampire. That part of the calm and confidence Tony was feeling, in spite of this enormous event, was simply because
“And I still don’t know what sort of boyfriend I could possibly be,” Tony went on – pausing to smile at the way Steve’s face lit up when he used that word. “I mean, even before you get into the vampire stuff… I haven’t been outside this house in twenty years. I keep weird schedules and I have no idea how to take care of myself and I have a whole host of family issues that we haven’t even gotten into yet… And I want to try, with all of that. I want to do better for you, and be the best partner to you that I can be… But I also want to do better for me. Because I

to explain the drugs. Obviously. That was a mission thing. A basic safety thing. A… protective, thing. He couldn’t let Steve get gassed by a cloud of endorphins and aphrodisiacs and not even warn him – even in this state, Tony knew that one…
...What if this meant uncontrollable and horrible changes to both of them? What if it turned them into something they couldn’t even conceive of yet?
If he could just get through this conversation without Tony telling him
The elevator dinged cheerfully, and the doors slid open. Tony saw Steve take a little breath and set his shoulders before he dared to look at him.
… and not much else…

“But substances such as herbal teas, or biological functions such as… a fit of the giggles, wouldn’t be considered ‘inebriating’, as such?” Freddie enquired.
Something stirred in Steve then. Something dark, and dangerous and… Good.
It gave Steve a warm, secure feeling - the complete opposite of what he might usually feel.
The recognition that Howard

He’d thought that Tony was angry with him, for the risks he took and the mistakes he’d made and the secrets he’d kept.
was watching them
“Are we sure that I’m even invited?” And, as expected, Bucky responded by collapsing back against the easy chair and groaning theatrically.
...What, just accept that sometimes he fell into an all-consuming, physical urge to be good for Steve, and offer himself up for Steve, and let Steve take care of him… And that was just… Fine?
So, obviously, he

Steve hearing that news, and not freaking out. He could imagine Steve listening, calmly, and kindly… he could believe that Steve would still look at him the same way afterwards.
“…I don’t think this is how people would naturally behave, under these circumstances.” Tony answered, his tone cool but not aggressive. A complete answer, but without any unnecessary words. Enough that no one could say he’d ignored Steve. Not enough for Steve to make anything of.
Which was especially off putting, when Tony was making such efforts to be nonchalant about it.
He saw Steve – no surer or firmer than

And it was wonderful.
At moments like these especially, Tony could appreciate that there was nothing lesser about having Pepper as a best friend. That maybe he

And bearing his neck for Steve…
To be honest, if the fate of the world weren’t hanging in the balance - and if it wasn’t quite so difficult to find time to work on it - Tony would have been quite happy to spend the whole evening just staring at a wall.
Steve realised there was no way he’d be able to work out exactly who ‘Talleroy Communications’ were, or what they were planning, from the clues in this dingy basement – but it didn’t matter. It was obvious that they weren’t allies, that their purposes weren’t legitimate… that, whatever the specifics, he and Bucky were better off
“The Guardians are dealing with the Mallamens, and their staff” Rhodey short-handed “I think we might have to leave them here for a few days and then come back for them, but, that’s fine…”
But he had to build up to it first.
By now, Steve had softened into a warm, giddy intoxication, where everything was happy and comfortable and faintly amusing…
That he’d started out with a rule that he wouldn’t think about the future, because he wasn’t sure he could handle the existential crisis that would surely come with it.

“Oh, I don’t deny, I’ve taken a particular interest in you both, since you arrived.” Adam answered, taking a lazy step into the room. “For all sorts of reasons. There is a great potential in you two – really, that’s why I allowed you to come in the first place. I knew your referral was false, obviously … and, of course, it occurred to me that you might therefore have nefarious reasons for being here. Or, maybe you were just curious. Maybe you wanted to see this place, and couldn’t get a referral… you see, I didn’t

The flyer Steve had given to Tony along with the blood. Pinned up back-to-front, so that he could see the last minute notes he’d scribbled.
He was basically confident that he’d made the right choices - even if he was still slightly uneasy about the drawbacks that he couldn’t avoid.
Tony felt his mouth fall open.
, for hours, you don’t answer the phone, SHIELD can’t even get in touch with you - what did you expect me to think?”
“It’s okay, I know” Tony cut him off, struggling awkwardly to get out of Steve’s lap. Trying desperately to hide the fact that he still had an aching hard on – although why he was bothering with that, when he was just grinding against him-
– other than it just coming out all wrong… But I am sorry Tony. I am so, so sorry, for everything. If I could take it all back, I’d do anything, if I could just go back and tell you the truth from the start – if I’d known how you felt at the start, all this time…”
But his brain was momentarily stuck on the idea that he and Steve were essentially being dosed with a truth serum – or a speech serum, at least, because Tony still wasn’t convinced that any of what he’d said
Maybe it was only that reading paperwork seemed more manageable than trying to deal with his own thoughts. At least he could push through that. He could

. Too iconic an image for Stark Industries to bother removing, maybe – or too obviously useless in identifying him now. It certainly didn’t help Steve to imagine what he looked like today…
But he absolutely knew, on that desk, in amongst all the meaningless clutter, there was a tube of silicone oil-
“We’ve gotta go wider on the public awareness campaign,” Pepper interrupted his train of thought over the headset. “You need to do some press. I'm in DC tomorrow-”
, or…
But Tony just carried on smiling, and closed the gap between them completely, his chest
He should know how they got from one room to the other…
Even in this imperfect mirror, Tony could see how pale and sallow his skin looked. Last night's clothes were now creased and bunched in the most unflattering of places, and strands of his hair were clinging to the film of sweat on his forehead. The bags under his eyes were so dark that he could see the city skyline through them.
On another night, it might’ve been different. Steve might simply have put his head on Tony’s shoulder, knowing that Tony understood, and cared, and maybe on another night that would’ve been enough.
How beautiful Steve would look, laid out on this bed…
“I thought that couldn’t happen?” Tony breathed, looking Steve up and down.

him thinking it –
“Uh, well, like I say, I don’t have to breathe at all… As long as I drink blood. But I didn’t, tonight. I… got distracted.” Tony muttered, aiming for light-hearted and simply ending up awkward.
Everything was so
That he couldn’t comment on
Tony coughed a joyless laugh. Well, that figured.
Now, Steve could so clearly see how fragile Tony was, how hard he was trying, how brave he was being… he couldn’t understand how he’d ever missed it.

He had to force himself to pause. To remind himself,
But he smiled.
He wasn’t responsible…
And, even if Tony had been listening, Steve was suddenly very aware that he probably wouldn’t care about a political argument in another timeline, or a physical fight that would never happen now, or the actions of a team he hadn’t even met yet…

There was a hollow pause in the air around them. A tension gathered, pulling both Sam and Bucky into more upright positions - and pulling Steve in on himself.
That there could have been some part of this that Steve could look back on, without remembering such horrible fear…
A little advance warning of the unreliable narrator at the start of this chapter - Steve is still very much trying to figure himself out here, and sometimes he's a little hard on himself (Tony's view of the situation is far closer to the truth IMO :-D)
…And Tony didn’t know if he’d managed to, or not.
But he let Bucky make it. Just like that.

him. If Tony judged Steve by the same criteria as he did anyone else, then he could clearly accept an apology and lessons learned as enough for Steve to be welcomed onto the team again, for Tony to move on from what happened. The fact that Steve loved him, and the fact that Tony knew it now, didn’t
And then he heard the squeal of tires.
Steve jolted to a halt, as every instinct panicked and screamed at him,
It mattered that this gesture made Steve feel cared for and prized, rather than exposed or exploited.
That piece of advice had come from Sam, originally –
Then, he took the marker pen - designed by Tony Stark himself to be permanent on any surface - and wrote in clear, block capitals along the sleeve of Other Steve’s uniform-
“Oh, I was meant to get you for dinner,” Rhodey remembered.
Steve’s expression twisted in distaste, as he decided that wasn’t really the right word for it… But he

They’d spent most of the drive in silence. Steve had answered all of Sam’s well meaning questions as politely - and as briefly - as possible, until eventually Sam stopped trying.
“I love you.” Steve whispered, pressing a kiss to Tony’s forehead.
As he and Tony had discovered on their subsequent trips to the planet – there was a reason Anni Vara had been chosen as the site of The Facility. Yes, the owners of The Facility had warped the Varians culture, and commercialised it, and amended it for the tastes of their human clients… But it was obvious which parts of it had interested them in the first place.
Learning that Vampires almost certainly existed as recently as four hundred years ago, and that they probably

At least forty years of nasty, judgemental voices, and they all still knew their cues, they knew what they were meant to leap in with now… But, oh, they were all consumed by doubt, now, and second guessing each other and arguing with themselves… they didn’t fit anymore, they couldn’t argue back… until all of that had just faded into a nonsensical noise…

He smiled, and set his phone down on the bedside table, and ran through one final checklist.
“Doing my best” Tony smiled back.
Of course, he’d been anxious the entire time Steve had been at SHIELD.
And, God help him, Tony wanted to laugh.
And then the specific memory of Tony teasing him about his PSAs - the playful smile that Tony could barely contain, as he leant his weight on Steve’s desk and mimicked,

certain of all of that.
1. As I hope is made abundantly clear throughout, Steve is in a very bad place and is reacting partly out of grief and trauma. As such, not everything he says is entirely fair or rational - and neither is it an accurate reflection of his balanced views. I hope the chapter also makes clear that this is out of character for Steve (that is kind of the point, in fact) so please don't take this as a reflection of my view of Steve in general.

“...Every inch of you is perfect. Everything about you.
“So, what do you do with them?” Nat enquired.
Steve’s breath hitched pitifully as his cock throbbed hard again, grabbing hold of the sheets with his free hand, gripping so tight that his fingers went numb. Trying to disperse some of this agonising intensity.
And then Steve caught his breath, his eyes dark and still locked on Tony’s when he whispered,
“Can you imagine” He started, theatrically, “If the Varians – or, even us, if

At least this gave him something immediate to fix - something he
So, Tony let Steve grab him by the waist and pull him on top of him, immediately surrendering to Steve’s kisses, accepting the messier, more frantic pace that he was setting. Moaning low in his chest as Steve ground up against him, the sound muffled against Steve’s lips. Tony dropped his head to kiss Steve’s neck, sucking softly against his skin, creating a trail of little red marks along the column of his throat that faded far too quickly. Steve’s hands swept excitedly over Tony’s back, grabbing erratically at his shoulders and waist and hips, stroking over the curve of Tony’s ass just as he rocked up to meet him. Tony dug his nails into Steve’s skin as a hot friction curled tightly in the core of him, pushing a desperate gasp over his lips.
It would undeniably have been a happier line of thought.

And he thought of all the people he’d been fighting with, before these epiphanies… the fact that they would’ve just been in the compound for the last few days, unaware of any of this…
And yes, that included a very detailed recap of the time they’d spend in bed together… and in his workshop… and in various other places, including the couch in the breakroom…
Tony scowled at him, instantly unimpressed with that answer. But before he could force the issue, Nat cut in,
...And it had never felt like that.
“Some hard evidence that SHIELD was infiltrated by Hydra not long after it was created,” Steve breezed, slowly rising out of his seat. “Alexander Pierce works for Hydra. Senator Stern works for Hydra. In fact, damn near everyone you’ve ever worked with, or trusted, is doing it all for the great Nazi world mission - and you have no way to know which ones,” he maintained his friendly demeanour as he walked slowly around the coffee table, coming to a stop just a foot in front of Fury. He liked the way Nick shrank back from him. “Which means,” he dropped into a more ominous tone for the big finish, “that when you were sending a former Red Room assassin into spy on Tony Stark, you were doing it because the Nazis told you to. That’s the big justification.”
He had no reason what-so-ever to think that the ‘consort effect’ was anything like that. He didn’t actually know what a consort

He hated it.

as he rocked his hips into him-
situation felt even more painful than reality usually did.
“So, may I introduce you to Mr Rousseau May, and Mr Rousseau Taylor, the directors of the festival,” an unfamiliar voice announced…
With a heavy sigh, Tony leant forward and picked up that same piece of paper again, groaning internally at how
He turned to look, and had a fleeting moment of panic because, at first, he thought it was a child –
“Hey, while we’re waiting, and since everyone’s here, why don’t we have a toast?” Scott suggested, somewhere between earnest and hysterical now. Bruce and Thor took their glasses too enthusiastically, Clint and Sam took theirs dutifully, while Rhodey and Bucky moved robotically-
He did it on purpose.

...No, really - just think of what he could say, if he tried to say anything.
...And there were
And that was before any of the other, day-to-day anxieties fully hit him. Steve had only just realised that they’d not even talked about… what happened, yet-
Even as the thought was still forming, Steve was already making the point, stroking a firm palm along each of Tony’s legs, pushing his thighs further apart, bidding him to lift his hips-
Steve. He felt like he could guess Steve’s opinion on topics they’d never discussed, that he could predict his reaction to things that had never come up – that he just knew what sort of person he was.
Steve didn’t even know why he’d snapped, in the end. He honestly couldn’t remember thinking anything, when he finally rose to his feet and marched out of his room without so much as a backward glance. It was more like a chemical reaction finally coming to fruition; the objective moment that everything reached critical mass-
...Other than ‘letting him in’ to that Bunker again
Thinking about it now, that was probably a good way to sum up the crisis that Tony had fallen into since he last saw Steve – he didn’t know whether he wanted it to have made things better.
“I didn’t watch much of it,” Tony explained. “Only enough to see what it was… But it’s footage of Hydra...

And he kissed him.
And he just needed a starting point, a way to cut through the noise-
But he likes the way that Tony speaks…
Steve recognised all of this. It all came together to form one of many reactions that he was used to having around Tony…

fell into the same routine, on nights like this. The same running order, the same positions, hitting all the same beats every single time. Having Bucky do something else conflicted with a subconscious expectation, a corporal assumption. Like walking into somewhere very familiar, and finding that first step just wasn’t there anymore…
So, he nodded. Enthusiastically.
Not that it mattered. This was beyond his control, now. These words were just flowing.
Tony might’ve still been staring at his phone, the whole time Steve was in the med lab.
he warned himself not to-
“I’m sorry, that was a stupid thing to say” Steve said, so sincerely, suddenly looking up at Tony with wide, blue eyes.
“Farewell Johann, Son of Martha.”
“I’m sorry?” Bucky raised his eyebrows.

But then his eye caught on the little glint of light at the back of the room – reflecting off of the body armour that he’d left sitting on one of the desks.
...Or possibly in his memories.

“It’s, I say what I think, and they say ‘whatever you say Cap’ and… how can I complain about that, I’m not complaining about that, I just – you can’t ask someone to not be
“Could you, just, uh…” Tony waved him quiet, screwing his face up against the frustration of thoughts. “...Could you just give me a minute here, please?”
Years pass and the grief ebbs. It turns into something manageable.
He knows it should hurt as she walks away, but all he feels is a slight tinge of sadness around the edges. He doesn’t feel much of anything anymore.
“Okay…” Tony says and he pushes himself up so he’s sitting against the pillows.  He feels woozy and sweaty, and he can’t help asking, “He didn’t cry again, did he? Because…because that’s not a reputation I need right now.  The guy who makes the Captain of the Howling Commandoes cry.  There would be a lot of hexes focused in my general direction and I’d have to wear the armor all the time.  That’d be inconvenient…and sweaty.  I should think about installing some sort of interior air conditioning in that thing.  Make a note of that, Pep. Internal AC.  Mandatory upgrade.”
“Peggy Carter,” she says around an impish smile. “I don’t think we’ve been properly introduced.”
It doesn’t take a genius to realize that every house has its share of jerks – Justin Hammer of Hufflepuff, anyone?  But it’s disconcerting how well Tony gets on with the Ravenclaws.  There’s a guilt that burrows right into his chest when he hangs out with them, but he can’t help himself.  Bruce is the only other student in his year who even understands half of the stuff flying out of his mouth, even though Bruce’s real expertise is in Potions and not Transfiguration.  And Pepper isn’t a genius, but she’s quick on her feet, adaptable to any situation in a way that has saved Tony’s impulsive ass more than once.  She reminds him of that on a daily basis and he doesn't dare disagree.
“Okay…” he murmurs.
Steve smiles.  “Yeah.”
After that, it’s like Steve can see through Stark’s armor – an armor Steve hadn’t even been aware of before. He sees it when Stark makes a cutting remark about a classmate’s potion but then proceeds to help them do it right. He sees it when Stark beats his duelling partner in Defense, but then makes sure to give them wand-handling tips. He sees it when Stark transfigures a red and gold suit of armor and insists to James as they walk through the halls that the colors are in honor of their friendship. And He sees it when Stark bows to the Hippogryph in Magical Creatures and it bows back, gaining the beast’s trust in two minutes flat.
“Why don’t you ask Rogers out to the Yule Ball?” Pepper asks him one day in the library, because she has clearly gone completely mad.
“Oh…” he doesn’t look at Steve, but he can tell the guy is a bit surprised.
“Yeah…uh…I need to focus and…” he trails off with a wave of his hand, like that explains everything.
“Luckily, Rogers caught you before you hit the ground,” Bruce offers.  “It could’ve been worse.”
That summer, a friend of his mother’s contracts Steve to work on his farm. Cleaning out horse stalls full of excrement definitely helps put things in perspective. And the hard labor changes him so much that one day he sees himself in the mirror and has to do a double take. He shoots up several inches by summer’s end and his body, once thin and weak, is now defined by muscles he never thought he’d have.
She gives him a look like he’s grown another head.  It’s intended to make him feel small and stupid and he’s ashamed to realize it works.  “You really are an idiot.”
The fingers stop moving for a moment, but then Tony whines and they move again in wider circles, rubbing his scalp like a massage.
“A woman after your own heart.” Bucky smirks. “C’mon. Let’s blow this popsicle stand. It smells like moping and sweat.”
“Shuddup, Bucky.” Steve’s stomach swoops at even the thought.
Rogers looks up from his drawing and his face flushes.  “Uh…yeah.”
“Why?” Tony asks before he can stop himself.  He’s equal parts concerned and hopeful even though he knows he has no right to be.  “Has his girlfriend dumped him?”
Something changes in James’s expression. “I’m not so sure he deserved it.”
“I advise you to get him where he can’t escape. Somewhere where he’s comfortable. The dude’s skittish.” Sam takes another bite of his apple. “Do you know the place?”
After that, everything is relatively smooth sailing. Steve loves Tony and Tony loves Steve. Even when Tony tells all of their friends about what they do together in their private time.
Steve grins. “Of course.”
He may or may not make grabby hands. Then he passes out.
So it doesn’t help that Rogers corrals him in the halls a few weeks later and apologizes to him on behalf of himself and his friends with all the sincerity of a kicked puppy. His eyes are all huge and blue even in the orange torch light and he's got this pout that is only enhanced by a plump lower lip, which Tony has never really had cause to notice before. Tony doesn't even know how to counter the  pathetic picture Rogers makes, so he just pats the boy's pointy shoulder and mutters a half-assed "no problem" under his breath.
Steve doesn’t mind. He pulls Tony in, his hands skirting up and under the hem of Tony’s t-shirt so he can grip the bare skin at his sides.
“Yeah…thanks…”
So, it feels like a punch to the gut that this is the day Tony tells him to leave him alone for a while. Tony won’t even look at him as he says it, and Steve knows now with crushing clarity that there is no way Tony reciprocates his feelings. That he’s probably been making Tony uncomfortable with his own obvious adoration. He leaves that afternoon and never comes back. His heart aches, but he tries to move on and give Tony the space he wants.
Tony nods, but his tongue feels heavy in his mouth, a weight settling in his gut.  “Did you take anyone up on it?”
Tony's legs go limp and he nearly topples off the stool. But by some miracle he manages to keep his head from greeting the floor and stumbles his way over to the Slytherin table. The Slytherins clap politely, hardly the roar of welcome the Gryffindors belt out, but he finds he likes it. Slytherins have class.
Steve really is the best.
Tony does a double take when he notices him and Steve finds he can only nod back with a hesitant smile, his ability to speak completely leaving him.  Steve takes a seat at a desk by a window and Tony stares at him for a terrible moment. Then he nods back, and Steve pretends to sketch the things he sees outside on the grounds. But it turns out Tony is more interesting, and he ends up sketching Tony’s hands flying through the air as he molds magical three-dimensional schematics. It’s more than beautiful what Tony does. It’s a work of art. Something that no other wizard could do. Steve’s heart swells at the sight, overwhelmed.
“Uh…sure?” Tony replies uncertainly. As far as he's aware, Rogers has already been doing exactly that for weeks without a formal request. But Rogers just beams at him and takes a seat at one of the abandoned desks.
“What is that?”
“Thanks.”
He bumps into Tony a few times in the Halls after that, his hands clammy and his heart in his throat, but Tony always looks like he can’t wait to escape. Maybe Steve’s been coming on too strong. Maybe Tony knows. Steve decides to back off.
Steve let’s Tony’s voice wash over him, fascinated.
It isn't his fault that Rogers is allergic to magic.  What self-respecting wizard is allergic to magic anyway?  How does he survive at a school that literally teaches witchcraft and wizardry?  Rhodey has to interrupt him mid-rant to clarify that Rogers is actually allergic to the pollen released by his tentacula hex, but whatever.  It isn't his fault Rogers is laid up in the Hospital Wing for weeks.  The rest of the school has been treating the entire incident like some sort of Greek tragedy.  Even as a midget, Rogers has a ridiculous amount of admirers beyond his House.  And his Gryffindor posse, the Howling Commandoes (seriously?), all rally to his bedside like he's some sort of war-hero and not an enormously stubborn, trigger-happy idiot.
When he wakes up again, he really is an invalid.  He’s alone in a bed in the Hospital Wing and something is holding him down.  He can breathe at least, which helps him not to panic, but the rest of the room is dark and it’s a little hard to feel his limbs.  He closes his eyes because he can’t really hold them open, and the next time he does open them, the room is bright with shafts of sunlight and he isn’t alone anymore.

“Where’re we?” He croaked, as he surveyed the room with bleary eyed confusion.

So, begrudgingly, he stopped himself from doing it at all. He waited as patiently as he could, until at last Steve took the phone from him, and smiled at it, and then brought it to rest in his lap with both hands clasped around it.
But there was nothing he could do about that now. Tony

Tony felt a queasy little turning in his stomach that he wasn’t sure he liked. The distinct feeling that he was experiencing two reactions that couldn’t happen together. Somehow, he’d managed to half talk himself out of liking Steve. He’d reminded himself of all the hurt Steve had caused him, and still there was this deep, empty longing… His body didn’t know whether to melt at how soft Steve’s lips were or harden at the memory of Steve
And it was complicated.
He let those words echo through his head like a pleasant melody as he melted into Tony again, letting him stroke his hands over Steve’s neck and shoulders, slow and firm and affectionate… The space around him seemed to stretch beyond its own limit, his surroundings floating further away from him until he felt like he and Tony were the centre of purely theoretical universe. Time lost all meaning. Steve didn’t know if it was minutes or hours that he lay there in Tony’s lap, letting Tony caress his way down Steve’s back, and over his arms, and through his hair… Moving him effortlessly, bringing him to lie on his back so that he could look up at Tony, while Tony stroked his palms over Steve’s chest.
“Steve.” He corrected. “His name’s Steve.” And then, in a bid to amend his tone. “He mentioned you, I think.”
“You know what Scott, you’re right. I
Tony sighed, pleadingly – and Steve loved that sound. He loved Tony’s voice, and his smile, and the way he held himself. He loved Tony’s body, the way he fit so perfectly against him, he loved the way Tony moved.
So, even though he was worried about Steve, and even though he still felt for Steve, and even though he didn’t feel like this was a good option… he still knew it was the best option, when he just winced, playfully, and said,
And Steve had promised himself that he wouldn’t talk over Tony, that he’d listen to him…
But, when he lurched forward, attempting to beat Adam to it – Adam didn’t go for the phone. He threw himself forward and went for
The comfortable way he’d been sitting, how much better he felt for relaxing his shoulders for a while.
The final of the folk dancing competition was being held on an outdoor stage in the centre of an enormous field, in the grassy outskirts at the edge of the city. Somehow, Tony and Rhodey had weaved their way through the tightly packed crowd and found a little space right at the front. Behind them, excited revellers waved banners and chanted their favourite’s names and jumped up and down to the beat, like the audience at a music festival. On the stage, several heavily-sequined men were throwing increasingly aggressive shapes at one another, while an intricate laser display played out behind them.
Somewhat reluctantly, Tony sat up so that he could unfasten Steve’s belt, and tug his clothes down over his hips. Steve arched his back to help him, doing everything he could to kick his legs free, parting his thighs just as soon as he was able-
“You’re the woman I saw…working, in the bar?” Steve asked, and Zan sighed, sadly.
Tony’s other hand sliding up to the back of Steve’s head, grabbing a fistful of Steve’s hair in a searing grip,
The discomfort of it wore off gradually, minute by minute, until Steve found himself asking why he’d ever felt obliged to make conversation in the middle of his personal trauma. Until he’d started to feel bitter over the years he’d wasted trying to be better than human, when it had never been necessary, and never been possible-
there to meet you halfway… I mean, I
“... Kind of?” Steve squinted, trying to think back. “I mean… I don’t know why I would be… And that lady might be right about the flowers, because thinking about the things I’m scared of is weird right now… But, I don’t know, I think maybe he sort of… Unnerved me?”
Steve looked over at Tony, a familiar expression on his face. Tony looked back –
onto that particular experience in the first place. You have to think of this place from their point of view.”
He was momentarily so overcome with hurt that Tony would think that way, and guilt that he’d ever played into it, and a pained desperation to make it right, that he forgot all the reassurances he was trying to make.
Oh, God, why wasn’t this working?
bad one, but still.
He loved the feeling of Tony coming inside him-
Tony’s mouth on his, devouring him, thorough and determined and desperate and messy.
He actually giggled at himself, as the heat flushed his face and the butterflies dive bombed the bottom of his gut-
Only to walk in and remember what a complete fucking mess he’d left, when he gave up on it the night before.
...What about in a thousand years? Would Steve even remember him? Would those forty years of slow decline seem significant to him, by then?
He was
That eerie feeling that something had already changed beyond recognition, and possibly in scary, unpredictable, hugely consequential ways - and he was going to carry on existing here…
...Well, any time Steve felt bad for the terrible sleep Nick would be getting for the next week and a half, he could think back to Tony’s nervous panic that they’d bugged his house -
about all this… and… I don’t know if you’re thinking that I listened to all this from Steve, and not you, or if you’re wondering why I’m prepared to go outside for a guy I just met, and not you…”

long it had been, there hadn’t been a single word in Tony’s head. There was just the rhythm of his heart… or possibly Steve’s… running all through his body, the sweet taste of the air, the gentle ebb and flow of release rippling through his muscles. Like his whole being had found that sweet spot in the middle distance and was simply floating there.

“Scanning now,” JARVIS informed him. “However, there are over 400 Petabytes of information to sort through, so this may take a while.”
That was the sort of thing that should snap Tony right out of this mood, and trigger all sorts of terrible fears… probably.
As he’d finally started to unpack everything that had happened to him in the last twenty-four hours, Tony had been delighted to realise that so many of his questions had real answers now. His vague anxieties had been given context and explanation. He had a structure through which to think about things - a genuine starting point, after all those false alarms.
, and the chemical reaction that we were trying to stimulate when we kneaded it, and what was taking place when we left it to rest, and the effect the saran wrap had during that time…”
That particular issue especially panicked Tony. It complicated and frustrated so many other things, sometimes threatened to unravel him completely. Those moments when he really thought he might be getting somewhere, on just one small element of it – an article in a medical journal that sparked an idea, a passage in some ancient text that helped shape how he was feeling, a train of thought that threatened to actually lead somewhere – and then suddenly he’d just hear it,

His limbs slumped into a heavy surrender, all the tension draining out of his body as he lost his resolve. As it turned out, his unhinged level of focus had been the only thing keeping the exhaustion at bay. Now, along with everything else, Tony was forced to confront the aching back and nagging headache that he’d apparently been ignoring for hours…

And it suddenly Tony found himself thinking how things would have gone, if it weren’t for Zemo. What would have happened if he’d just found out one day that Steve had kept that secret for him – the way normal people get to discover these things, on an otherwise uneventful Tuesday, when you can at least focus on that one revelation…
“Uh, yeah,” Pepper nodded at him, “but could you give us just one minute?”
Or even just a chance to work with Tony, maybe start building some of the foundations that could
And Tony kept trying to tell himself that this couldn’t possibly be real. That these daydreams would clear as soon as his head did, that he’d be able to think of all those anxieties and contingencies when he wasn’t high.
“No, it’s fine,” Tony cut in, somewhat surprising himself and then having to rush to catch up, “I mean, whatever is going to make it easier, in the long run – if he’d rather have you here… or, if… you’d rather be here, or whatever – I don’t mind, either way.”
wasn’t for him. It was, in fact, the very opposite of what had interested him in the idea in the first place.
And he didn’t want to leave him-
Wow. What a mess.
“So, before we go out tonight, we should probably talk about…what might happen.” Tony spoke as though the words tasted bad. And there was a peculiarly exciting rush of horror as Steve realised what Tony meant. A strange bracing feeling in his stomach.
...And then it all got a bit fuzzy.
“Steve – I’m sorry.” Tony breathed, lying under Steve now, looking up at him through those impossible lashes-
The peculiar look that would cloud his father’s features whenever someone mentioned Steve, or Operation Rebirth - the mix of guilt and fear that Tony could never name, but seemed so obvious now.

If I’d pretended I was going on a date, Nat would still be asking me questions

Of course, it was ‘less inhibited’ that Steve picked up on - but, by now, he could only really recognise it as a familiar reference. An in-joke with the universe.

place. That, in all his years of having this argument, with Tony or with the memory of him, Steve had never yet tried being honest like that… Whatever it led to, it wouldn’t be the same rhythm that they’d run through so many times that it was etched on the inside of his skull. There was a giddy sort of release, simply in that.
He knew it didn’t really fit… Captain America, chained down and begging Tony to fuck him…
The groups of people walking through the streets wearing elaborate lingerie…
...But that was still easier said than done.
HE WAS CAPTURED BY HYDRA
So he made himself look down, to where Steve was still just lying quite comfortably, his eyes soft and his hair all messed up…
And now, suddenly, this whole thing felt even more…
He had to remind himself that he was out of practice when it came to human interaction. That he was trying to
Instead, he’d detailed the Battle of New York and the discovery that SHIELD had been infiltrated by Hydra and the events of Sokovia… And then simply said that he’d made a horrible mistake, and that he and Tony had fallen out, and that he would explain all of that once he was done telling the wider story, he promised… before picking up with what happened in Wakanda the first time Thanos came to earth, and the five years after…

have to worry about how uncomfortable it’s going to be, because the doctor won’t,” Bucky seemed to work it out as he was saying it. “But, I don’t know – I think I just trust that this is going to be as good as it can be. That he’d actually explain stuff, and ask me before he did anything, and try to make the whole thing less shit. So, I guess… now there’s no point worrying, or something.” He shrugged again, like it wasn’t a big deal.
“I knew you’d look beautiful like this,” Tony purred, watching as Steve relaxed into the sheets. Steve glanced up to meet his eye, that dreamy expression still softening his features. A light blush coloured his cheeks, somehow making him look even prettier, as he asked, shyly,
God, all those things Obie said to him, that he’d blocked out for so long. Things he’d decided were creepy and ridiculous and nonsensical when he was 21… But, what if-

Steve sighed, and brought Tony’s hand to his chest, resting it over his heart. Tony could feel the rhythm of it beating against his palm.

He looked up just in time to see Bucky hurling the back of the chair at one of the guards, knocking her prone. Her partner was still in a state of shock as Bucky took two strides forward – bits of the chair still tied to each leg – and hit him once right between the eyes.

“There’s no rush,” Tony went on, in that same voice.
And then Tony pulled free of him.
“He didn’t say anything - he barely said anything throughout the whole mission,” Nat informed him, with an unimpressed look on her face.
Without the benefit of prior focus, it all seemed like a mess of noise and motion, at first. Bucky, hands already held up in front of him, backing towards the swimming pool with an exhilarated grin on his face. Tony darting in between groups of people in swift, jumping motions, as though he was looking for somewhere to hide. The low murmur of the people around them looking up and asking what the hell was going on…
For as long as he was being brave, and thinking about things… Tony had to acknowledge that biting Steve felt like it simply
But he didn’t know when exactly he’d worked it out, or even how long it had been true for.
Nick Fury and Alexander Pierce and anyone else who’d known about this ridiculous, 1940s policy and decided to let Steve run with it - even after all the additional trauma he’d gone though.
And then, with the flick of a button, he was gone. Clicked out of existence, as though he’d never even been there - already washing up on a windy beach frequented by dog walkers, a few hours after SHIELD had expanded their arial search for him.

Tony Stark loved him…
It was just him.
It took him a second for his eyes to adjust, and the first thing he scanned for was anyone that might’ve seen them…
And Steve immediately knew this was a code.
“Why?” Steve added.
And leant up, and kissed him.
And then his eyes met Tony’s, and for a second everything froze.
And he knew that Steve was feeling the same anxiety.

“Yeah! Um, yeah, sure – what, now?”
And then he saw Adam move – just wiping his face again, actually, but it was enough to trigger Steve into responding. He was on his feet in one fluid movement, suddenly glaring down at Adam, his fingers still curling and uncurling as he fought his bodily hatred of the man. He saw Adam still, his eyes widening at the sheer speed with which Steve could move, his body melting away from the physical presence of him. For that brief second, Adam looked entirely different. Smaller. More human, when he dropped the mask of a calm messiah.
Steve considered him for a second, while that burst of inspiration articulated itself

Tony had told himself that this was the least worst option. That he’d made his peace with the fact that Steve wasn’t sorry and would never be sorry. That, even if his heart had been irreparably broken, it was better to be broken hearted with a team of people to help him defend the world. But every single day there was a moment when Tony could’ve snapped, and said it all anyway. At least one moment when he couldn’t pretend he didn’t care, that it didn’t matter. Tony had spent the last few months waiting for the spark that would blow this tinderbox, the minor disagreement that would start them fighting about

To be honest, it was nice thinking of Tony getting to relax, at all-
A waitress appeared at their end of the table, a customer service smile on her face.
But Tony snatched him up by his lapels, and lifted him two feet into the air, and held him there as he told him,
“Hm? Oh, yeah… I think so…” Tony mused. “Well, I think I’m a lot of things, at the moment…”
Now, everything he’d spent so long telling himself suddenly
Tony wouldn’t let himself remember that night. The night Obie decided
“Okay…” Tony heard himself answer, very softly. And then there was a moment of thick silence… not uncomfortable exactly, but very

Maybe it was just how awake he was. Maybe, until now, he’d just been too worn down and weary to properly feel exactly how furious he still felt. His blood ran hot with it now. His eyes stung. He remembered how angry he’d been when it first happened… he felt that same rage now. Anger at Steve. Anger at himself.
The green man walked out into the room first, striding confidently, his otherwise human features arranged into a showman’s grin. A young woman followed behind him, scurrying, her eyes shining with nervous excitement. She was wearing a pearl pink shift dress that shimmered when she moved, and her candy pink hair was tied up in neat pigtails… And Tony could no longer tell if her skin was a subtle shade of pastel blue, or if all the vibrant colours were playing with his perceptions. What

Tony hated himself for even asking that question. It felt disloyal and spiteful and completely ridiculous to ask that question.
He really shouldn’t…
And even more reassuring was the realisation that… it would have been very different, if he’d killed Jesse.
Steve nodded, struggling to think over the arguments shouting for attention in his head,
It wasn’t a no.

to decide which parts to leave out.
“And who brought us here, you?” He asked, even though he hadn’t processed the answer to his first question yet. “Why? How?”
“Oh God, Tony, fuck,” Steve whined, working himself off against Tony’s grip. Tony let his robe fall open, relishing in the abrasive burn of Steve’s uniform against his skin, the teasing hint of contact against the base of his own cock.

impossible for Tony to get close to someone. Dismissing certain interpretations of this, because obviously he ‘couldn’t get close to people’. Carrying that assumption even as he was dressing for a date, or while Steve was cooking him dinner, or when he was telling Steve that he could have a photograph… After all this time assuming that he

And then, out of nowhere, a thought occurred to him.
Steve literally had to take a moment, to recover from the release of that… And when he looked up, still smiling, he saw Tony smiling back at him- a little hint of a thought around his eyes.

But he just kept going.
His eyes fell on the champagne bottle as he strolled by it again, and this time he mindlessly picked up the card. As expected, it was the name of the hotel embossed on the front of it. Tony opened it, and automatically translated the handwritten message inside,
“Well, people do a lot of stupid things,” Steve answered with a smile. “They’re just people.”
“You don’t seem very sorry,” Tony noted, with a still-breathless grin. “If I didn’t know better I’d say that was on purpose.”
“You can still help people,” Steve tried to keep his voice level, as he inched ever closer. “Believe me, whatever trouble you think you’re in right now, it’s nothing compared to what half the Avengers have come from-”
…Oh, God, what had he said?
He couldn’t believe he’d been so unaware, so
“And you’re sure of that?” Tony asked, kindly.
Up until that point, he’d been lying in a state of dazed happiness, his mind completely silent and his limbs still throbbing with satisfaction. Tony was lying against his chest, sighing softly as Steve played with his hair, a constant source of amazement and comfort that Steve didn’t have to think to name. It was simply everything, and it was good…
Right now, it was really very tempting to lean into that. To allow himself the sense of injustice and self-pity, to be consumed by his own pain and be entitled to it…
He was
Steve could hardly breathe. It was like there just too much excitement flooding through his body to leave room for mundane things like air. Tony was moving so urgently, so completely lost inside his own body, separate from the world. Somehow disconnected from Steve even though he was so impossibly focused on him. Steve couldn’t work out how to meet his movements, how to make sense of this frantic, animal urgency. He
? And Steve had to scramble to think of what he
“Oh, uh, yeah,” Steve answered, still dazed, nodding at Tony,

Tony felt his feet stutter to a halt underneath him, his body jarring to an awkward stop.
And then, after however long, Steve finally thought to wonder where he was…
There was an impatient tug up along Steve’s back, a gathering of tension in uneven, ugly waves throughout his core.
Tony heard it in Steve’s voice, his hips rocking up into his hand involuntarily, as the scene unfolded in his head.
“Oh, God, Oh-fuck-oh-fuck-oh-fuck-” Tony panted, his voice getting higher and tighter and more desperate as that feeling inside him built and sharpened and,
“...You think that’s what would make Steve happy?” Bucky asked, trying to keep the scepticism out of his voice. “If you

“Is there any way we could
And it occurred to him-
“I’m sorry,” he said again, glancing away until he was sure that impulse had passed.
And he couldn’t even begin with the more existential question of

And he might’ve found himself thrown by that, and ended up floundering - and who knew how many of those timelines existed, and how badly Steve put his foot in it each time, and how things worked out from there…

He couldn’t just walk away without saying
And Steve didn’t even have chance to lose his breath before Tony had engulfed him completely, taking him right to the back of his throat.

And a brand new little voice speaking up in the depths of his own mind,
And, given that he was so immediately overwhelmed by the place that he’d forgotten how to blink, it seemed only
he’d been that he’d held Steve to a different standard to everyone else, that Steve hadn’t deserved such harsh treatment simply because Tony had fallen in love with him.
By then, Tony’s little networking tour had taken them to sleek looking bar – all silver and black, with low couches and coffee tables, and a grand piano that no one was playing. Steve had watched Tony effortlessly engage another stranger in a conversation, almost as soon as they arrived, and realised that it really wasn’t necessary for him to stand awkwardly at the back of it. He wasn’t even sure that Tony had noticed him wander over to the bar. He could probably leave the room altogether and it wouldn’t matter, he thought, somewhat bitterly…

or whatever…” And then, as Steve was trying to find words for how amazing he was, Tony glanced down at his feet and asked, “speaking of which, are those the Operation Rebirth files?”
“Oh God yes, please yes, please,” Steve answered immediately, still grinding back against his fingers. He bit back a shout as Tony moved his hand away, that same desperate entreaty repeating over and over in his head,

Steve spoke so naturally; it took Tony a second to recognise that it wasn’t an answer to his question.
The head of Steve’s cock pressed hard against his rim-
Steve smiled, casting an eye over the workshop before he stood up to leave-
There was no chance for Captain America

Steve was so close now-

And then, as the last of the aftershocks had finally trembled through him, and his muscles at last settled into their resting place, one single voice spoke up very clearly through the haze.
Until Nick Fury strolled in.
“We could just take them with us.” Steve suggested. “Wait and see if we think we need… or if we think that’d be better than whatever we find…”
He couldn’t help feeling like this was a step backwards. Tony really thought that he’d moved beyond this overwhelmed, physical reaction to Steve. Their last few appointments had actually been enjoyable,

“So, what do you think, is this a back up situation?” He sighed, still talking to the back of Steve’s head.

The point was, Steve was barely talking to Tony as it was, so he could hardly strike up a conversation about sex, of all things. And he couldn’t exactly start a serious conversation about anything else, while they were both trying to pretend that they weren’t at an orgy.
But… This just

The fear of wanting Steve’s blood… of not being able to control that.
That was probably a concerning development.

Jesus, had it literally been seven years since he last relaxed his shoulders?
Tony felt Steve arch up against him, somewhat tentatively - like he was making sure he was allowed to. Tony responded by rolling his hips, deliberately grinding into him-

Maybe it would be

But he just didn’t have the mental energy to care that deeply right now.
Tony walk him back toward the bed as being genuinely unable to fight him. Steve stumbled back those three broad steps, his eyes still locked on Tony, his attention focused
“Bucky-”
” Steve pleaded, half muffled by the pillow he was screaming into, as Tony pushed the tip of his tongue past Steve’s rim, his fingertips pressed hard into the sensitive flesh above his hipbones now, adding sharp little sparks of pleasure to the low, rolling heat of his mouth. Steve whined, and begged mindlessly, tears leaking from the corners of his eyes as he writhed helplessly in Tony’s hands.
He’d only just realised how
Looking into Howard Stark’s work history, and early research, and personal relationships… all of that had to be fair game, surely? Seeing as it was
And Steve had been waiting for
And then a petite woman shuffled shyly up to Steve’s shoulder. He might not have noticed her at all, if it weren’t for the fact that her bright purple hair caught the sun so dramatically. But when he looked down, he recognised the expression of someone courteously waiting for a pause in the conversation.
Steve wasn’t entirely sure how they made it to Tony’s bedroom. He had the vaguest recollection of Tony leading him up the stairs – specifically, he remembered the way Tony’s thumb seemed to caress against his wrist… But not much else.
They were both thinking the same thing. That there was no option to go back to the room and think about this, no way they could carry on covertly gathering intel, no chance their cover wouldn’t be blown in a few hours, one way or the other. Now, they had one simple choice. Decide to intervene themselves – or get out of the situation, and hand it over.
“You know how to do that?”
…He could not believe he’d developed a

She nodded a silent thank you, and she left.
“Hi,” Tony grinned - casually waving the hologram away before he stepped over to meet him.
He could interpret Clint so differently, depending on whether he was thinking of the Clint who had so bravely joined the Battle of New York moments after being brainwashed, or the Clint who’d sided with Steve in the worst decision he’d ever made, or the Clint he’d argued with at that final BBQ… And, when he wasn’t thinking of any of those things - when he was trying to decide how he felt about the man simply standing in front of him…. Steve wasn’t sure he could tell.
And then the darkness closes in on him again, heavy and cold - and he is afraid.
He had never been able to put together a comprehensive map of Bucky’s movements in the first timeline, but Steve was almost certain that he should be in the States by now - he was
And then his head was on Tony’s shoulder.
Tony physically manoeuvred Steve over to his side of the car, mostly because it seemed natural to carry on touching him… He warned himself to maintain a little bit of concentration for the road, as he got into the driver's side door and fastened his seatbelt.
He’d spent so much of the last two days worrying about never seeing Tony again, he’d rather forgotten to worry about what would happen when he

Steve was readying himself for some final jump, and Tony just wanted to
But then a low, feral moan escaped Steve’s chest, his shoulders tightening against whatever sensation Tony had just sparked in him - and Tony simply couldn’t bear it any longer.
Steve, those flawless blue eyes wide and shining, looking at Tony with such intensity – such naked, unashamed desire. Tony could feel the desperation coiling in Steve’s muscles, he could see every tiny little movement that Steve was struggling so valiantly to contain.
And he tried to think about it. He tried to remember the context of this reaction, the objective outcome of any interaction with the sun. He

Bucky cast another furtive glance in Sam’s direction. And then, before either of them could find a way to continue the conversation, Tony took a deep breath, and sat himself up, and carried on talking.

He glanced at his watch again. Five more minutes.

The happiest memories were the most painful, now. These were usually the memories he flinched from, the moments he had deliberately buried under layers of righteous anger. But now Tony thought he might prefer thinking about last Christmas, if it meant he got a break from endlessly rehashing what had happened
He couldn’t believe he’d actually let those feelings put Tony in harms way. That he’d let Tony walk into a mission that he

And as soon as he stepped into the hallway, he knew.
. A lot of it would have to wait –
Tony scanned the group to look for Steve. By then, they’d walked a little way across the wide, paved plaza in front of the hotel; the sort of place that Tony expected to see dancing fountains. He was very briefly distracted when he recognised the soft pink and purple glow that seemed to bathe the courtyard - or, rather, by the observation that he couldn’t see the source of it… And then his eyes caught on Steve.
And he was
there like that… But Tony could still see them.
Pepper certainly deserved more than to be subjected to
In reality, Tony was becoming increasingly comfortable that they’d made the right call. And increasingly pleased that they’d actually made a call, come to that. That they’d finally acknowledged that their relationship had changed since he hired her to be his PA, even if that didn’t make them a good match romantically. To find and name those acts of kindness and concern and commitment for what they really were.

He’d made it as far as the hall before he paused, and, as though it was an afterthought, added, “is there anything that you can tell us about the Tesseract that we ought to know?” Without missing a beat, Steve replied,

And Steve just sort of… dissolved with it, for a moment. He didn’t know whether he’d actually passed out, or just been out of it. But there were a few minutes – he would never know how many – where Steve just floated on his feeling, his vision blotted by purple clouds now, his head just

“... Are you real?” Steve asked, as his smile pinched into a frown. But the guy didn’t answer him. He just stared through Steve for a few seconds longer, and then… wandered away…
And then Tony felt him surrender into that same heavy afterglow, a delighted smile washing over his face.
A few hours later and Steve was still lying on the couch, staring up at the ceiling, a dreamy smile on his face. He’d been in that same position since he’d kissed Tony goodbye, watching a reel of wonderful memories and excited plans play in his mind-
Which was a huge revelation, sure, and something he’d no doubt spend the rest of the week over-thinking… But, in the moment, it made it much easier to talk.

The thing he’d feel bad about, when he was capable of feeling bad again.
Tony was pretty confident he was smiling in the right places. Putting the right items of banal small talk in the right gaps – the women he was talking to seemed to be pulling the right faces. He thought.

He would sit down and read these papers, one at a time. He would not start thinking about what they said. He would not allow himself to run away with unanswerable questions, or get carried away with endless What Ifs. He would simply trudge through them, the same as he had with so many uncomfortable, confusing briefing packs in the past, until he was finally worn out enough to sleep.
After a moment Steve had to break away and gasp for air, still holding Tony close, his hands caressing gently against Tony’s skin – like he was still trying to convince himself that Tony was really there.
“Oh, I think they will,” Steve outright grinned. “
“Because

Steve reacted instinctively – he actually took a little step back. He knew his shock and horror was probably completely clear on his face-

Within moments, it was actually painful to maintain his pretend-relaxed posture. His eyes stung with the effort of it, his legs burning with desperation –
And, oh, suddenly he felt very guilty…
Steve placed his hand over Tony’s, gentle but firm, and guided him to lay his palm over his heart. For a moment Tony just absorbed him. The rhythm of his pulse, the rise and fall of his chest, the warmth of his skin…
come to think that… maybe he
Tony felt like he’d lived a week at least, in the five hours since Steve called. He’d been through every possible mood, existed in every possible perspective, run through every thought it was possible to have.

But he still really wished that everyone would just… not.

The nagging,
And then, as though to illustrate that very point, Tony began to move against Steve’s cock – never once pulling back entirely. Working Steve off against his throat in sharp, shallow motions. Steve let go of a wordless, primal moan as his head fell back against he pillows, his shoulders falling limp as all his tension began to collect in his hips. He thrust up sharply, his hand firm to the back of Tony’s head, hardly able to comprehend what he was actually doing-

“This is comfortable,” he grinned. Steve hummed an agreement.
And it was heartbreakingly endearing, for Steve to apologise for not thinking of that-
He’d say he’s surprised by Stark’s attack when Steve confronts him in the midst of threatening that Hufflepuff boy’s life, but...he really should’ve seen it coming. After all, he might have magic, but that doesn’t mean his immune system has gotten any better. Trust Stark to use that fact to his advantage. The pollen from the Tentacula hex sends him straight into anaphylaxis and the last thing he sees before his vision goes dark is Tony leaning over him with panic in his eyes.
“Well, you’ll be happy to know the whole school is on your side,” Gabe reports.
It happens at the end of fifth year, when the House Cup is at stake, of course, and the deciding factor in the race is whether Slytherin or Gryffindor wins the last Quidditch match. Tony and Steve go head to head as their House’s respective Seekers.  Of course, Tony is a better flyer, but Steve is small with quick reflexes in the air and less wind-resistance.  It's physics. Everything goes to shit, though, when Tony is hit by something very hard and very heavy to the chest. The next moment he opens his eyes, he’s looking up at Steve Rogers's tear-stained face as the boy cradles him against his smaller body like Tony's some kind of invalid; like Tony's worth crying over.
He denies it, but she knows it’s a lie. He can see it in her eyes.
“Don’t speak, Tony,” Steve warns, his voice isn’t as rough as Tony is expecting it to be, given how puffy the kid’s eyes are.  His tone is even and deep and reassuring.  “Just…we’re gonna get you to the Hospital Wing.”
Tony winces the moment the hat falls onto his own head. And he has to remind himself to breathe when his world goes dark behind the worn leather.  He focuses on the fact that the hat smells like sweat and patchouli oil (“A bunch of hippies,” Howard sneers in his mind.  “I’d never ship you off to that school if it wasn’t for Slytherin.  So don’t mess this up for me, boy.”).
Tony narrows his eyes at her and frowns, wounded.  “That’s cruel, Pep.”
“Okay…” Tony utters stupidly, and then they both go silent.
But then the letter from home comes one morning and it’s hard for Steve to see much of anything anymore – through the grief.
“Still breathing.” Tony coughs, and that just turns into a thing that won’t end until Bruce hands him a goblet to sip.  Tony lets the water soothe the ache in his throat, before he asks, “what happened?”
“The right partner,” Steve replies, with the sinking feeling that there’s a disconnect between them that he doesn’t have the courage to bridge.
Tony is good enough to tuck him back in and Vanish the evidence, before Steve turns them around and drops to his knees.
“I hear you’ve been asked to the Yule Ball,” Tony blurts out one time when he's grown too exhausted to filter himself.
“Get yo man,” Sam cheers and slaps his arse.
“Oh, God,” Steve gasps.
When their lips meet, it’s like fireworks go off in Steve’s core, burning him up from the inside. Tony’s mouth is plush and soft, and he gives as good as he gets.
“Oh, and Gryffindors always follow the rules?” James retorted. “Your girlfriend slapped him in plain sight of a professor and got detention for it.”
Natasha finds him skipping rocks across the lake a week later and kicks him in the shin.
“Yeah.” James nods. “So maybe you should cut Tony some slack. Whatever you think he is, he’s not that.”
Steve goes silent, in shock.
Tony scrunches his eyes up and bites the inside of his cheek. His panic rises in the form of a metallic tang at the back of his mouth.
Tony doesn’t breathe out until he leaves, and then he makes sure to keep his hands moving, his mind jumping through calculations that don’t involve the hitch in Steve’s voice when he’d said goodbye.
“Steve?” He pushed, gently, when Steve didn’t say anything. And Steve brought his focus back into the room with a little shake of his head.
was supposed to wear those chains, for Tony.
Tony didn’t want to spend the whole evening going through exactly why his life was so shit. He didn’t want to suffer through a specific list of things he could never have, he didn’t want to have to think about why he wanted those things so badly. He preferred being able to take that for granted, to never have to look directly at it… to not think about it at all.
But then a beat later the realisation caught up with him -
probably correct a few details, when he got to them… but, mostly, Tony just felt like he could see
Tony shook the memory away.
to where the smartphone was-
But Steve had to admit, for the time being, it was sort of fun…
It was probably just a sign of how isolated and lonely he still was, all these months after coming out of the ice. Steve could only assume that he wouldn’t be fixating on meaningless interactions with co-workers, if there had been anything meaningful in his life at all. But as it was, he didn’t have any real relationships. He didn’t have any affinities or loyalties of his own, no personal investment in this new world. Nothing harmless or human to think about, when he was done with his responsibilities and trauma for the day… Except for his petty arguments with Tony.
He didn’t know where that thought had come from, and he didn’t have the capacity to analyse it greatly - but he felt it…
“…So, my best guess is that it
And then they both changed position, so that they were standing side on rather than with their backs to the door…
He still hadn’t moved beyond his improper - possibly unethical - focus on Steve’s needs, but he’d finally started to
Technically-
He didn’t know what it was, exactly. It might just have been the simple human niceness of watching someone who was so very in love, or being happy for people he cared about. Maybe it was partly that it was a conversation that Bucky felt more included in.
of irritation that he’d never been sure where to aim. And suddenly, it was all so obvious…
Maybe Steve had just felt so sorry for Tony, and so angry on his behalf, that he’d confused it with feeling something
And paused, when he found a handful of USB pens and a stack of loose papers, tinged brown with age.
He almost felt obliged to be happy in this relationship, rather than be that person. Which was also ridiculous, he knew. But he couldn’t help thinking he
Steve was cut off by a shout, as Tony hit his prostate, sparking a more urgent pleasure in him.
“I assume,” Tony smiled.
…And he might never stop asking himself if there was a
And in its place, there was only this warm, heavy feeling of total comfort, washing through him like water. Tony’s body collapsed from under him, falling as a dead weight into the couch. And for an endless moment, he just felt as though he was floating, suspended in this thick, heady sensation.  Everything felt good. Every inch of him throbbed with pleasure, every shapeless thought that drifted through his head was happy.
Tony dropped Steve’s wrist, his other hand caressing lower, down to the curve of Steve’s waist. He watched Steve’s throat tense as he swallowed, hard, his eyes dropping to focus on Tony’s mouth. His fingers curled tighter into Tony’s hair, sending a sudden static shiver down the back of his neck. And then Steve moved his other hand, bringing it up to the side of Tony’s face-
And no one had
any super soldiers, now. And, when it first happened, Steve had realised all of that, and he’d felt terrible about all of it, and he’d tried to accept the consequences of it…

Because, of course, he wasn’t going to be inviting Steve along.

He forced himself to take a breath and unclench his jaw. He counted backwards from five, slow and even. And then, purely for the sake of asking, he glanced up and said,
Steve got the impression that they knew exactly why he was dragging Tony away… Which he liked, very much.

Steve jumped to attention, looking over to the source of the commotion just as Tony sprinted out behind him, with a delighted yelp of faux distress.

“Come here,” he smiled instead, reaching out to pull Tony into his arms. He was weightless, in the water, his skin slippery against Steve’s…
It had all fallen into place in one horrible, vivid instant – even before he read the title on the other side of the flyer, now visible through the damp paper.

Tony fought the queasy stirring of connection. He did everything he could to smother his instinct to nod, to throw his arms out, to tell Steve,

He held his breath for a moment and strained to listen for sounds of movement on the other side of the bathroom wall, but the water was loud enough to drum out all but the sounds of his imagination.
But biting Steve?
He’d always wanted to be included in Tony’s jokes, to be able to laugh
But Steve’s attention was snapped away from them when he heard Tony stand up, and then take a little half step towards him. The hair on the back of Steve’s neck stood on end, his breaths coming fast and shallow as he waited. He could feel Tony running his gaze down his back. He could
… And this was just what he’d done instead.
A muted alarm sounded in Tony’s head then. Or, no, maybe alarm was too strong a word for it – he was still far too spaced out to be
…He was sure
Steve swallowed the stomach acid that was pooling under his tongue, and gave a perfunctory little nod. He would have dearly loved to be comforted by the gentle way that Tony was talking to him, but Steve could barely hear him over the imagined sounds of Bucky screaming-
And then there was a nauseating jolt, as Steve laid Tony flat on the floor. An abrasive tug and a shock of cold air, as Steve peeled his bloodstained shirt away from his skin.
Tony he overthought and analysed… With his subtly different temperament, and his different collection of opinions - some of which might already have been shaped by the fact that Steve had been here-
Slowly, Steve began to piece himself together. He realised that his chest was heaving, his legs were trembling, his back was sheened with sweat. His head was still spinning.

“Hm.”
But he didn’t recognise the city.
the finishing line. A tremor of aftershocks ran though him, his muscles tightening and releasing erratically, his breath catching in his throat. And Tony just held Steve firm against him, supporting all of his weight by now, as it ran its course. Until at last every part of Steve had been broken down, until every last drop of tension had been dragged out of him, and he just fell loose and heavy into Tony’s hands.
He doesn’t even know if they’re friends, but Rogers always seeks him out after a few days and the routine starts over again.  It’s definitely torture, but he can’t bring himself to make it stop.
She exits their carriage and Bucky claps Steve on the back. “Maybe your sweetheart will notice you now, eh, Stevie?”
Tony pulls back, his cheeks flushed and lips red. He casts a Silencio and his fingers find Steve’s zipper. “Can I?”
“Purebloods?” Bucky asks from Steve’s other side, voice muffled by a mouth full of mutton pie.
Bucky shoots a finger gun at him. “Got it in one.”
An image of Stark leaning down at him with tears welling in his eyes flashes through Steve’s mind and he shakes his head. “Well, I hope she gave it to him better than I did.”
“I don’t need your pity, Pepper,” he tells her and he starts packing up his books.
Peggy greets him with a raised brow, obviously amused, which is probably better than protective and homicidal.  So he’ll go with it.
“I don’t have a girlfriend.” Steve runs a hand down his face. “D’ya mean Peggy?”
Luckily, Rhodey looks composed, although there’s a note of disapproval in the line of his frown.  Nothing Tony hasn't seen before.
“You accused Peggy of stealing me,” Steve explains.
Steve rushes to carry him the rest of the way to the couch and lays Tony’s head on his lap. He’s concerned, but Tony is definitely still breathing. He looks like he’s only asleep.
The first time Steve sees Tony Stark, the kid is buried under the Sorting Hat and Sam mutters into Steve’s ear, “If Stark isn’t in Slytherin, I’ll eat my own hat.”
Bucky claps him on the back as he sits on the couch in the common room and stares into the fire. “He doesn’t deserve you, Stevie. He’s a jerk.”
Steve doesn’t have the heart to argue. But Tony isn’t a jerk. That’s his armor, the person he projects to the world. But inside, he’s infinitely kind. And that’s why his rejection hurts so much.
Steve points at the center of the holographic armor. “What’s that?”
Luckily, that’s the end of any comments about Rogers and Tony is released from the Hospital Wing later that day; well, technically, he sneaks out earlier than he’s allowed, but no one drags him back from his dorm room that night, and Headmaster Fury doesn’t even give him the stink-eye the following morning, which is more unsettling than the alternative, really. So…point for Fury.
Tony blushes all the way to his ears. “Of course you do. I do pilates.”
“That shouldn’t take long,” she observes, and then she flounces away.
They take their places across from each other, Ty smirking and the Slytherins taking the piss out of Steve – hurling insults.
“She’s not my – “
But he can hear the scrape of Steve getting out of his chair.  “No…yeah…I understand.”
“Sarcasm is a thing, you know,” he retorts.  “Is that all?  I need some time to re-inflate my ego.”
“Will you go to the Yule Ball with me, Tony?”  He’s actually blushing again, which is so adorable it’s unfair.  It’s like he actually thinks Tony will say no, which is mind-blowing and flattering in a way that Tony just isn’t prepared for.
“You crashed through a window in the second-year girl’s dormitory,” Steve informs him, and his lips are quirked like he finds this fact amusing.
“Call me Steve,” Steve says before he takes Tony in his mouth.
“Something tells me you’re going to give it to me no matter what.”
He thinks to be embarrassed but Tony’s pupils are blown and he mutters under his breath, “So hot.” Like it’s a secret.
Tony jumps at the sound of his voice and fumbles his wand. “Um..this? It’s a schematic. For some new armor. Mandatory upgrade. AC you know? It gets hot in there and sometimes the joints stick in the shoulders…Why?”
Steve stares at him. “He’s a Slytherin.”
Pepper has the gall to laugh and Tony shrinks into his seat.  Ouch.
Sam notices Bucky stiffen and puts a hand up. “No offense! It just means there’s a lot you guys don’t know.”
“You gave us quite the scare,” Natasha says, cocking a brow like this observation means nothing to her, but he can see the way her eyes track him, more focused than usual.
“And your girlfriend beat Stark up for you,” Bucky adds.
"...And that's how our darling Steven lost his virginity."
Peggy touches his pec reflexively when she sees him again, a blush high on her cheeks. “Well…right...I should get back to my car.”
It doesn’t matter that Justin Hammer had been trying to steal Tony’s ideas and cheat with them, apparently.  Barely anyone agrees with Tony that his actions had been justified.  And yet, they flock to Rogers’s side for hexing Tony without cause or provocation. Tony can admit, even to himself, that he can be a jerk a lot of the time; that he can be sarcastic and annoying as hell when he wants to be; especially when he’d told Rogers to "stay back and let the big-boys handle it”; but Rogers’s hex had clearly been an overreaction.
At least she isn't glowering at him and mashing one fist against the palm of her hand the way Barnes is.
Sam takes a swig from his goblet and tips it toward their table. “They’re all Purebloods. Slytherin was the only Founder who cared about blood and money. And Stark has both in spades. The Dark Lord was from that house. If you ask me, you guys dodged a hex by getting placed in Gryffindor.”
“Steve,” he coughs out, nonsensically.  He can’t really breathe. That could become a problem. Not enough oxygen to the brain, probably. Which isn't ideal, because he likes his brain.
Steve sets his feet and proceeds to take Stone down easily with a well-timed Stupefy.
But then he looks up from his food one evening in the Great Hall and spots Peggy Carter leaning down to kiss Rogers on the cheek like it’s the most natural thing in the world, and his world crumbles around him.
”He’s been a right jealous berk,” Peggy informs him with a twitch of her lips, amused, as she levitates Tony’s limp body down the stairs. “Crashed into the girls’ dorms and demanded I give you back.”
The moment she walks away, Bucky turns around to face him. “Wow, I’m invisible. It’s like I’ve become you.”
“You know he sleeps with anyone who moves, right?” Bucky asks him one night after he catches Steve staring at Tony across the Great Hall. “Why don’t you just ask him to do it with you?”
Steve frowns, confused. “The entire House is full of bullies. Purebloods and rich kids who would rather skirt the rules than do the work necessary to get ahead.”
Clint has a worrying habit of hanging out in high places throughout the castle and dropping down in front of unsuspecting first-years, so Tony shuts up and spends a manic 48 hours transfiguring some protective armor for himself.  The armor is beautiful – red and gold with moving parts that glimmer in the torch light - and when Clint inevitably tries to shoot him with one of his hexed arrows, they break apart across its surface.  Clint grumbles about the color choice, but Tony insists it’s perfect and flashy with no affiliation to a certain House That Shall Not Be Named.  Clint and Natasha both side eye him and then each other, but Tony ignores it.
Steve grimaces and blushes.
“Oh…”  Tony utters.  “Uh…so…”
"That's why you're my favorite, Brucie."
“Okay,” Tony mutters.  That’s a bit…yeah.  “Great.  Good.”
It’s almost comical how awkward Stark is when Steve finally approaches him to apologize. Steve gets the sense that he doesn’t get apologized to very often or maybe he isn’t especially great at dealing with emotions. Steve tries that assumption on for size and finds it would explain a lot.
What if he
And then Tony
Steve felt the tension ease out of his ribs, his shoulders lowering slowly as one second became two… and then three…
They’d never once talked about it, but they’d always just acted like the other person knew… There were times when you tensed every muscle, and there were times when you could crack a joke in the middle of a firefight, and there were times when you sat there and chatted, even while you were checking the exits. It just had to be that way.
Her monologue was cut off as the waitress appeared beside the table, and Vanessa turned to order breakfast for all four of them – in spite of the fact that Andrew clearly didn’t want anything. Tony took the opportunity to throw Steve a sceptical look, and Steve pinched his lips,
“It’s nice.” Steve smiled politely, putting the empty glass down with the others. And the man looked at Steve for a second too long before he smiled back.
it fairer to say that the air was actually sobering him up? Freeing him from irrational emotional impulses that he’d never had any control of, before now?
he looked, how innocently amazed and openly excited… genuine human emotions, deep and important emotions – the parts of Steve that Tony had so longed to be let into, for so long…
...And at least the first of those impulses was easy to identify.

He didn’t know whether that would actually be
“You, uh, you know about the Howling Commandos, right? You know who Bucky Barnes... was?” Steve began, over a growing lump in his throat.
Of course, there was never any chance of Tony going back to bed. In fact, by the time he got out of the shower, he was beginning to think that he’d never sleep again-
He wanted to help Bucky, and he didn’t want to help Bucky.

what it had all been for. That everything he’d ever been through, however unfair or unnecessary it seemed at the time, had led him here.
But the far more concerning part - the bit that turned his stomach and tasted of bile - was the creeping awareness that he just wasn’t happy in this relationship.

“I have no fucking idea” He answered, honestly.
Or pointing out that, seeing as standing there like the cardboard standee from a customs checkpoint apparently hadn’t worked, it might be time to try something else-
And Tony very nearly answered him,

He didn’t even know if he wanted that, now.
He considered arguing the point… But he was looking to get out of this interaction, and this tent, as quickly as possible - and he could tell that the assistant was just

Steve felt all the tension leave his body, the air evaporating in his lungs, every thought in his head stopping dead and disappearing.
He was here now.
“Hang on,” Steve ordered-
Tony wasn’t the only one having a (possibly drug assisted) moment of enlightenment, right now.
Bucky smiled for that, in spite of his rising anxiety.
There were so many ways Tony might’ve misinterpreted that, a day ago
“Go on then, you can tell them.”
And he stepped aside, so that Steve could see the construction of the cradle, in which the Tesseract already sat, just waiting for the final components to be put into place.
The sweet things that Tony had whispered to him as they laid there just… being together…
When he watched Tony work, Steve wasn’t looking for mistakes or oversights. He was just watching Tony’s hands. Beautiful hands, fast and delicate…like an artist…

That instant in which Tony’s instincts kicked in, intense and immediate and all encompassing, his whole body pulled towards Steve-
“I’m thinking that, firstly, this should help us find any sources that SHIELD didn’t,” Tony continued in that same animated patter, “but, you know, also that it might uncover anything SHIELD were trying to hide, or

“Oh Tony please,” Steve panted, that tantalising hint of the stretch that he needed melting away from him, as his body relaxed to let Tony in. The same teasing hint that flared up and burned itself out, as Tony slid a second finger into him, and
A few of them were looking now. Some of them intrigued, some of them smiling amiably…
“I love you too,” he smiled. He saw Steve go to say something, clearly struggling for words and still struggling for breath.
“Oh Tony…” Steve breathed, his thumb still tracing over Tony’s cheek, his eyes shining with emotion. Tony felt it pooling in his stomach; something so familiar, even though he’d never felt it before. A warm sense of total security and perfect happiness, simmering with excited promise - an anticipation without tension, without limit…
, of everything that ever went wrong, and everything I ever
All of his previous fantasies had been shadowy and ill defined and… scary. He hadn’t known what it was that he wanted, not really. He could never quite imagine how it wouldn’t be messy and painful - even though it already felt like it wouldn’t be… Tony had never been able to work out how that feeling would look. He’d only ever had brief glimpses and shots from a distance-
But Bucky let go of a resigned sigh before he could.
“Oh, right,” Scott croaked, nodding too vigorously, “right, right, cos I was only an Avenger in 2016, when I was risking everything to help you -

“...But you
he felt free to have his say….
And as the heat of Steve’s fear was about to melt into a tearful sadness, Tony looked up at him again.
He took the chance, while Steve was sitting up, to push his shirt back over his shoulders, caressing his palms over every inch of Steve’s arms as he went-
Some possible foundation for a train of thought.
And then the door opened, and there was Steve - smiling at Tony as though he’d been waiting all his life to see him…
The fact that someone,
There is

He was Zemo, explaining the rules by which Steve deserved to be punished.
The impotent anger he felt at the very suggestion.
That he didn’t have to be guilty for that, in and of itself.
Steve just heard it, loud and unambiguous in his head. No way to unthink it. No way to deny it. So, he simply acknowledged it, stoically, and waited for the wave of frustration and confusion that must surely follow. Telling himself he should at least
“If I could take myself out of it, if I’d never met you and was watching a film of you, from a distance… You would just be this kind, patient, brave, annoying stubborn man – who just has a problem with this Tony Stark guy. Hey, doesn’t everyone? Someone who likes all but the most unlikeable, is patient with all but the most infuriating… someone who just doesn’t trust Tony not to fuck it up – which is how everyone feels, by the way.” And Tony looked away, his shoulders suddenly heavy, his voice more tired, more resigned when he carried on “It’s not a flaw of
Still, he was almost running through the Tower in a bid to get to his next appointment on time, with the exact same anxiety he used to get when he was late for Sunday School-
“That was nearly fifteen years ago,” he huffed. “And JARVIS is programmed to handle that now…” But he trailed off as he realised what she was getting at.

And then the hot press of Tony’s hand over his mouth. The tingling of the tape stuck fast against his skin.

Which then became a thrilled gasp, as Steve pulled him up onto his knees and tugged his shorts down over his thighs.
And then Steve’s resolve
And then, just as he was about to round the corner into the main research bay, Steve was stopped in his tracks-
That same shard of hurt twisted in Tony’s chest, and a thousand irrational, emotional thoughts came pouring out of the wound-
him thinking his way through the next few weeks. Tony could see the worry, and the determination, and the optimism, in those subtle little changes on his face. It made Tony want to reach out to him. It filled him with a sudden urge to help, to make this better.

Because that’s what it feels like, what it would be if… But it’s not going to be like that, because I’m going to live for a thousand years… which is just… One of the things that makes it all so different, me saying that-”
Steve waited.

By the time Tony was standing with him, calmly waiting for Bucky to come around, Steve felt a genuine contentment that he hadn’t felt in a long time.

This was
“Yeah, everything’s fine,” Tony replied automatically, “and I’m sorry to call so late, but something’s come up, something important, and I’m going to need a ride.”
“So…” Steve announced, nervously, as he put the grocery bag onto the counter. “I have brought tinned tomatoes,” he pulled each item out of the bag as he named it, “a bottle of soy sauce, a bag of rice, some granulated sugar, and a can of corned beef.” And, as he was saying it, Steve was again panicking that this had been a really bad idea… But Tony laughed, kindly. That laugh that Steve always felt a little bit proud to have gotten out of him.

It all sounded so forced.

be explained by a chemical reaction… or a shift in his thinking. Maybe he’d just gotten it into his head that this was something eerie and supernatural, and stopped looking for the logical explanations. Maybe, if he looked again, he might realise how silly and superstitious he’d been about things that could easily be understood.
“Okay, well, I think we’ve just finished clearing every floor” Rhodey began, his voice pulled just that little bit tighter, like it always did when he was in the middle of a mission. “A couple of awkward fuckers, obviously, but… well, the point is, if
Not as strong as it was before, and certainly not as clear… but still there, maybe…
Hm… The image of Steve, naked and openly displayed for him, his arms still held obediently above his head as he begged Tony to fuck him…
“Well, that was the plan,” he nodded. “Although, to be honest, I don’t really care what they think they know - as long as Hydra don’t get their hands on Time Travel, which I don’t think they can, now that the Pym Particles are all gone…”
“Because you never tell him what you’re thinking, and you clam up and run away every time a conversation gets too personal, and you never invite him to spend time with you, and you’re scared to laugh in front of him, and you’re always picking at him and second guessing him, and then when you had this huge news and this massive crisis you went to everyone else in the world
And then reached over and took Steve’s hand in his, stroking his thumb over Steve’s palm as he carried on,
“Well, the effect varies, actually, depending on who drinks it, and when.” Maribelle announced, sounding pleased with herself. And Steve
Together, he and Tony reached that tipping point, and then everything was yanked out from under them in a rush.
And they had no choice but to go up…

“And I don’t really know how to be the old fashioned one, when everyone actually used to think of me as the forward thinking one. But I’m almost embarrassed to say that now, because I can’t back it up-”
Tony shivered.
Tony giggled, and then glanced up at him.
“Which meant we couldn’t even pretend we were going to be late for something else,” Steve carried on over-explaining.

sparkling social life… But at least he could say he had one, now. He had date nights with his boyfriend, he had people over for drinks occasionally – he even had a more social relationship with Rhodey and Pepper, now that he had something to talk about besides ‘how’s the company going?’ and ‘yes, I promise I’ll eat better’…

The idea of using terms that Tony would find offensive, or giving an impression that Tony would think false, or saying anything that Tony wouldn’t like – about this, of all things – filled Steve with a sense of dread.

He heard Bucky grumble as he came to the same conclusion, and shrugged his way out of his shirt. So, Tony huffed, and did the same.
he shouldn’t, but he couldn’t help it – he couldn’t stop himself from actively thinking of all the things that scared him, all the things these feelings could attach themselves to-
He really wasn’t lying, when he told Tony that he understood the difference - he’d spent so long
But the only other outcome was that Tony carried on down this oblivious, self-destructive path. Talking to Steve without thinking it through, walking around without his guard up – letting himself get carried away in daydreams about Steve, without ever preparing himself for the day he lost him.
A deeper, more vivid feeling, like everything up until this point had just been foreplay-

“You’ve not even had a drink yet,” he joked, as he sat down and dropped his legs into the water beside Steve’s.
Followed immediately by Peter, who was soaked from his head to his waist, a playful look of determination fixed on his face…
But he’d been allowed not to know it the first time around, because, as it so happened, she hadn’t had the chance to do it to him.
With that, Steve’s thoughts drifted to a different picture - to the life he now shared with Tony, and everything that meant…

He carried on with his original plan like he was playing along with it – because, hey, what else was he going to do?

And then his eyes caught on Tony, looking down on him, one eyebrow raised in an expression of warm amusement.
Steve felt his chest swell up with a sudden panic, a
“…Yes, like every Thursday,” she answered, in that secretary-voice she only ever used to mock him. “So-”
now, like there was less gravity or something…
“Okay, well, I’m going to go and deal with this…” Steve muttered, gesturing gingerly to his shirt – the wet stain across the front, from whatever Tony had thrown it into-
It wasn’t that Steve was any less furious at the people who had wronged him, just because things had worked out for the best. It wasn’t that he suddenly thought these injustices and awful crimes were vindicated, because they’d
could think like that all of the time, that he really didn’t have to be
“Steve.” Tony cut him off, firmly. “Okay, you asked me a question, and – no. I am absolutely sure, it would not have been better if you’d died in that crash.”
“Well, we have a huge raft of tests to run today,” Tony sighed, waving a hologram into life. “A couple of scans, a bit of bloodwork, a few basic reaction tests – I’ll have to put you out again, for about fifteen minutes or so, just to test your resting and subconscious responses. And then it depends what the results are. It might be that there’s still some minor tweaking to do… but I’m
Suddenly, Steve wasn’t sure how much of this arrangement was a secret. Whether Tony would expect him to conceal even the fact that they’d met-
“I’m sorry I yelled at you, when I got back from space. I was just… delirious, and dehydrated, and hurt, and, its no excuse. I’m sorry I tried to make you feel bad, for not being on the team when Thanos turned up. Like it was your job to be there, or something, like I had any right to assume… and you turned up anyway, and I never said – and I’m just, sorry…”
“Oh God,” he gasped, forced to close his eyes-
else, then this place probably wouldn’t have been an issue at all.
That was all that being a vampire meant to Tony, now.
And then an entirely different thrill ran through Tony’s body, and he had to freeze and bite down harder to keep himself from coming.
But he wouldn’t. Of course he wouldn’t… That’s why Tony loved him so much.
Should he simply

. So in love that it made him feel powerful and peaceful and pure…
When he glanced up again he saw that Rhodey had fixed him with a more serious expression, clearly having realised that there was more to Tony’s mood than whatever was in the water.
He could feel the velvet tug of Tony’s lips, searching along the vein in his neck.
And the nervousness, and the stirring of discomfort…
In the first split second, that just registered as a shock.

for the first time in twenty years. What should’ve been the unavoidable, natural reactions to this situation were of no use to Steve, and therefore just weren’t there.
Steve would’ve liked to have been in that moment with him. After all those years of torture and pain, all those months of anxiety and uncertainty, it seemed like they’d finally achieved what they’d set out to do… But Steve was just too consumed by the next crisis to celebrate the end of the last one. He
“Oh?” He asked, as casually as he could manage.
With a high, keening cry, Steve came hard over his chest, a disorienting rush of pleasure that rolled into a wave of overwhelming relief… That just kept pulsing ever lower, pulling from deeper and deeper within him as that sensation rolled on, and on… He felt Tony’s stuttered attempt to come to a halt, his breath hitching as Steve clenched around him - and then breaking, as Tony tumbled after him into his own release.
. You made an effort not to do it again – and you never did. That’s the hard part about being sorry… and you did actually do that… and I never even noticed, because you didn’t say.”
It was like a nagging feeling of anxiety, an irritable fear that he’d done something terrible or forgotten something important. A feeling that permanently distracted him and set his body in a state of constant tension. It made it almost impossible for him to maintain any train of thought, which only added to the feeling that he was missing something…
now. Like waking up from a trance.
Either way, he felt like he was controlling himself as much as he could… and still feeling inadequate over it.
Steve’s internal crisis had come on much hotter and faster than Tony’s - and consumed itself far more quickly.

They won’t forget who they are, or what they knew, or who they love – just that these plants haven’t always been a fact of life. They’ll forget that they weren’t working on the full potential of these drugs, before.”
None of that was distinctive proof of anything…

“…What?”
“JARVIS,” Tony announced, throwing himself onto his feet with pointed determination, “where did I put my dad’s old research file?”

Reiterating to himself that there was never any nice way to do any of this. That Tony was
He just looked at the bed.
He’d smiled when he walked in, and traded a bit of casual small talk, much more relaxed than he had been just a few weeks earlier… but Tony still felt like there was something. Something Steve wasn’t saying, some other train of thought that he was trying to ignore….
And then he felt the dull press of Tony’s fingertip against his hole, every nerve exploding as Tony caressed possessively over his rim, and then pushed into him maybe half an inch.
“Amazingly, no,” Bucky sighed, “I must’ve had everything

He aimed an uppercut right into Adam’s gut – and Adam dropped to his knees like a sack of wet rags. When Steve’s vision finally focused again he saw Adam, red faced and wheezing, and still blinking blood out of his eyes, a foot away from him.

Just as Maribelle parted company with the little group she’d been talking to, Tony was able to stroll nonchalantly by her – spritzing her with the ‘intimidate’ spray while everyone was distracted, and continuing coolly to the bar… No one noticed.

He couldn’t help himself. He’d been the same since he was a kid – always looking for patterns in strings of numbers, or trying to work out the mechanics of things, or trying to translate things in his mind.

Tony understood what he was looking at immediately. Without words, without any processing-
And he knew that Steve was thinking the same thing.
And just as he said it, the song hit the chorus – someone yelling that they were not okay, over and over. Steve threw Bucky a sharp glare.
Tony didn’t really come back into himself until half way through the ride home… when he seemed to suddenly find himself on the back seat of the car, semi-shielding himself from the sunlight, his hand resting over the still-tender skin where the bullet wound once was…
“Hey,” Tony smiled, his eyes soft and dark. Steve let it wash through him like warm water, before he answered, quietly,
He was undercover at an orgy.

The odd thought that it wouldn’t matter what he discovered, seeing as he didn’t have anyone to share it with.
Whether it was fair or not, even if it didn’t fit with any social or moral structure Tony had ever known, no matter how impossible it seemed… The choice in front of him was still the choice in front of him.
And it occurred to him to wonder why Peirce hadn’t suggested it - or at least asked how he felt about it…
It would be uncomfortable, and it would be uncertain – but he

But it seemed to be going okay.
“Great, okay, well, Joost and Zoe will be just outside if you need anything – just give them a call.” She smiled, gesturing to the doorway. “I’ll probably be passing this way again in an hour or so, so I’ll check in again, and see how you are.”

Eventually that feeling overwhelmed him, and, in a moment of reckless exhilaration, Steve decided to just throw his arms around him. As Tony was still talking, Steve stepped behind him and wrapped his arms over his stomach, letting his head rest in his hair…
Steve let out a surprised little squeaking noise that he really hoped Tony hadn’t heard.

“Fair enough” Steve answered, with a little shrug. “You want to ask anyone about extended stays?”
He heard the soft hum of approval from Steve, like a balm on his skin. An immediately soothing sound that managed to settle the trembling.
Because,
And then he found himself reading Italian place names, and realised that he’d done it again - he hadn’t been listening to any of what he’d just read.
He settled himself more firmly, pulling Tony close against his chest as Tony pinned Steve’s hips between his thighs – kissing him the whole time.
Tony felt a little spike on interest. A physical jolt, like he’d literally been
He didn’t even know what he was feeling bad
Maybe that he’d always known some of this.

And Steve actually nodded, absent-mindedly, as if to say,
And, okay, Steve’s regular, everyday brain was beginning to panic, slightly…
It was positive proof that Obie had been wrong. The moment Tony discovered the truth behind all of Obie’s self-serving lies and distortions and exaggerations. The moment he could say for sure that his instincts would never find pleasure in killing, never give him an insight into who was ‘ready to die’, never
And then they’d been sent undercover to investigate an alien sex resort.
And then his phone vibrated in his hand.
Steve fumbled slightly in his haste to unfasten his zipper, the hint of friction already burning through his groin. A jolt of heat cut through his hips, as he wrapped his fingers around his cock and immediately began to stroke himself with rough, fast motions-
And Tony was just staring at
“Fine, of course, just name the time.”
he was supposed to have a plan, that he was supposed to be responsible - that he was supposed to
have wanted that, in the forties. Everyone on his block would have wanted that.
Bucky took a moment to sort through that random assortment of recalled images…
But what instantly overwhelmed Steve was how very
And, of course, once Steve realised what he was doing, he realised it wouldn’t work. That no amount of paperwork would make him feel any more prepared, or any more in control – or any less anxious. That nothing he did tonight would make tomorrow come any quicker. That he wouldn’t feel any more relaxed right now, however much admin he got done.
Thankfully, Tony breathed another good natured smile...
careful, he could nudge it open an inch and look…
Steve glanced down at Tony, regretfully, and saw a similar expression on Tony’s face… which then melted into a smile.
This problem only gets worse as time wears on, but Tony is a master at burying his issues beneath layers of narcissism and sarcasm and one-night stands.  Rogers is always so damn nice to him, though, even when Tony tosses barbs his way during joint lessons or in the halls.  The shorter boy only looks at him, like he can see right through his armor of bullshit and appreciates every last part of him. Tony is left swallowing around a lump in his throat, because Rogers’s smile is bright and warm like the sun rising over the Mediterranean at daybreak.
“You can call me Tony.” Tony smirks and takes Steve in hand, calloused fingers running along his length.
He isn’t too sure how it starts – Bucky will say it’s a reference to Dum Dum going commando and yowling about it when he’s drunk on smuggled firewhiskey one night – but the moniker, Howling Commandos sticks to their ragtag group to the point where the whole school starts calling them by the name. And Steve becomes the unofficial Captain, sometimes said with reverence sometimes with scorn, because he can’t keep his nose out of things – according to Bucky.
Of course, there’s no way Tony could feel the same. So, Steve visits him in the Infirmary when he’s still unconscious. Just to make sure he’s still breathing, and to keep the nightmares - Tony’s body being lowered into the earth at the funeral instead of his mother’s - at bay. He passes Barton on the way out, who side-eyes him but doesn’t say anything.
“Okay.” Tony nods and swallows, because he doesn’t know what else to do.  His face is heating up again and his heart is beating its way up into his throat, and he genuinely doesn’t know how to proceed at this point, because -
“If you ever need a shoulder to lean on, I’m still your friend.” She pats his chest, just over his heart.
“Ah,” Steve murmurs indulgently.  “That explains it.”
Steve just grins. He thinks Tony got the underlying message, anyway – Steve loves more than just Tony’s ass, and he can tell Tony feels the same way about Steve. Tony Stark still wears armor, even around him, but it’s fine. He can see through it easily enough.
But he doesn’t really get it and she doesn’t elaborate any more than to say, “Just think about it, Tony.”
When he comes to, he thinks he must be dreaming because Steve’s upside down face is hovering over him and there are fingers running through the hair framing his forehead.
Catching Tony and holding him breaks something open inside of him that he had forgotten was there. And in that moment, he knows with terrible clarity that he’s in love with him. He’s been falling in love with him since the Tentacula incident in first year and it was only his mother’s passing that had clouded the feeling growing inside of him for a while now. The sharp sting of loss that had cut through him as Tony fell to earth is was good a wake-up call as any.
“Please stop.”
James Rhodes approaches him in the common room later that night when it’s nearly empty. “Look man, I’m sorry about Tony.”
They stare at each other for a long moment and Tony fidgets.
After that, the Captain moniker really sticks.
Tony cracks an eye open and peers up at him.  Steve's eyebrows are worried, but his lips are smiling softly and his fingers are tracing Tony’s cheek bone like it's something precious and…and that’s when the reality of the situation crashes down on him like a ton of bricks, because it feels real and none of that makes any sense. Tony stiffens then scrambles to sit up, but Steve holds him down with a hand on his shoulder and Tony goes still, his heart beating a mile a minute.  “Um…”
“Ouch.”
“Mmmm…” Tony moans and he turns his head to bury his cheek into the small space between Steve’s thighs.
Anyway, it’s that night in the privacy of his four-poster that he tries to sleep and realizes he may have a problem.  He can’t stop thinking about Rogers and his stupid, pouty lips.  Or his dumb, earnest face.  Or his calm, deep voice in the middle of a crisis.
“Yep,” Tony replies stupidly, his mouth dry as the memories flood his brain.  “Too much Firewhiskey.”
And unlike the kids at his old school, his Housemates take to him despite his frailty. It doesn’t hurt that he seems to be a natural at dueling and charms, which is exhilarating after a lifetime of only excelling at more quiet pursuits like reading and sketching. Magic unlocks a strength in him that he never knew was there, but he loves it. After a childhood of getting beaten up on the playground and back alleys, he finally feels like he can make a difference.
Steve Rogers, however, is the worst.  Ever since first year, Rogers has been the president of self-righteousness.  And even at three feet-whatever-inches, the kid goes out and hexes Tony for “bullying” Justin Hammer of all people.  Of course, Tony hexes back, because what the hell else is he supposed to do?
The hat’s voice pushes into his skull like it has every right to be there, and he has to tamp down on his own instinct to push back.
"Shame," Tony muses. "He has really pretty eyes. Especially when they’re glassy from -  "
